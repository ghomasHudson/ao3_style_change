When Harry looked up from the paper Draco was looking at him, “It’s cool right?” Harry nodded and looked down at the page again, “That’s the stone you gave me,” and pointed at the picture of the stone that he was constantly wearing nowadays, “yeah,” Draco sighed, “Was this the- uhh, the research you did?” Draco suddenly straightened himself, “No, that- this is a compilation from all the research I did, there’s- there is a whole book on wizarding families in England, this is just a summary I made,” Harry smirked, “and when was this book released?” Draco shrugged, “2000,”
After what felt like a half an hour everyone settled down again, Ron now with a protective arm around Hermione, “two then,” Molly concluded happily looking between Aubrey and Hermione, “How long have you known?” Ginny asks, now very interested, “I’ve known since early November” Hermione said with ease before looking up at Ron, “Well, Hermione is a little shit and kept it from me for a month,” Ron said grumpily, “So I didn’t know until early December,” He concluded looking around, “Sorry,” Hermione said quietly to Ron, “No problem, love,” Ron whispered back and turned back to the family, “And in case you all are wondering we made Harry godfather,” Ron turned to him and Harry smiled back at him,
Draco winked back to him; Kevin rolled his eyes. “Can we stand with you guys?” Harry asked, visibly shivering, “Of course,” the group replied and made room for the golden trio who quickly were added into the conversation, Draco standing between Harry and Kevin he was having a silent conversations of hand gestures and raised eyebrows with Kevin, just before the count down he heard Weasley comment, “What are they doing?” as they were still having said conversation.
Deciding to take a nap he tries his best to fall asleep and not get the pain in his neck get the best of him. Then he sleeps for one and a half hour, he wakes up by yet another pling in his phone.
“I don’t,” said Harry defensively, “it’s not my business who you love I was just wondering” Dean nodded, Seamus too, his arm was around Dean again. “personal?” Harry shrugged helplessly and laughed, “at this point, I don’t know,” Dean reached out and grabbed his wrists, “we got you,” he said softly, Seamus' hand was now joining Dean’s on one of his wrists, “thanks,” he smiled weakly, tears in his eyes. “If you EVER need to speak to anyone, we’re one floo call away,” Dean comforted, Harry nodded, biting his lip, “Harry,” Seamus said which made Harry look up at him, “where are we?” Harry laughed despite himself, he was crying now, he couldn’t help it, “where are we, Harry?” Seamus asked again, his hand gripping his wrist slightly harder now, “a floo call away,” his friends smiled at them, Seamus other arm was still around Dean and he realised that almost everyone around him was together with someone and just a crippling sense of loneliness washed over him, he wasn’t alone, he knew this, he was loved, he was out with friends but something was missing and it made him miserable.
“Were you showering dear?” Draco nodded violently. “Obviously” he stated. “Anyway” His mother shook her head getting back to the subject. “Andromeda has asked us over for dinner tomorrow afternoon, care to join?”  Draco gave her a questioning look.
When Harry woke up on the 24th of December and felt the breath of Christmas up his nose. His neighbours were baking some delicious Christmas food and he could smell it two floors up. His covers were warm, and he knew the rest of his apartment was cold. Forcing himself out of the bed he stretched and yawned. He walked over to the kitchen, making sure not to trip over the pile of Christmas presents, and made himself some scrambled eggs and toast, preparing to get all Christmassy and go over to Andromeda's house to celebrate Christmas with Teddy. Harry had never spent Christmas anywhere else but at Hogwarts and at the Weasleys and didn’t quite know what to expect and therefore he’s also is very nervous. He’s going to spend the 24th with the ancestors to the Black family, which he was pretty sure he also was a long-lost ancestor of but still.
“But if the earlier wearer can’t wear it anymore, it is passed down to the oldest son, even if he’s not married yet. But he can’t put his name down until he is,” Harry’s eyes fell to his stone, he read
, he thinks but complines. “I’ll get ready at home and come right back, alright?” Harry studies Draco and thinks that the invitation most likely comes from him being high off his sleeping meds.
Well at the house Draco shrugged off his jacket and went straight for the kitchen serving as a bar, he had clearly been here before. Harry shrugged off his jacket as well and followed him to the kitchen. “Hi,” he said to a guy with blue hair he recognized from somewhere who was on his way to the dancing area with another guy behind him. “Sab,” he heard Draco say, “Alcohol,” and he watched a blonde girl pour up vodka and something else Harry couldn’t tell in a glass before giving it to Draco.
“Does it mean anything in particular?” He asked, but she started to walk down the stairs, “Well,” She stopped, “It can, but thinking that they were in Knockturn alley, or that’s what he says anyway, we can’t know for sure, he can just be returning them to their right place but then again…” She cupped her chin and looked at him in wonder, “Draco Malfoy is a strange man,” She concluded and walked down the rest of the stairs. “Wait,” Harry rushed down the stairs to where Ginny had stopped at the end of them, “Does the Weasleys have one?” Ginny crossed her arms and nodded, “Well, first of all we have two, just like you,” Ginny sassed and Harry rolled his eyes, “but dad’s the youngest of three boys so there’s no way for even Bill to get it,” Harry nodded, “The stone is kind of orange,” Ginny said in thought and lifted her hair, “I wonder why,” which made them both laugh and together they walked to the living room and joined the others again.
To say the least, Malfoy got scared when he tapped him on the shoulder to tell him they were closing. Malfoy nodded and packed his stuff but stayed back from leaving.
“Sup” Pansy nodded at in her direction on the couch before turning towards Draco. “Potter followed me on Instagram.” Draco raised his eyebrows, “Is that what you came over for?” Draco asked in an annoyed tone. “Well, yes, and other things but mostly that. Anyway.. has he followed you as well?”
There on the other side of the stone named in scripted and Harry scanned all of the names but stopped at
His heart raced as he stared at Harry who still was fast asleep and despite himself, he smiled fondly at him, picking up a spare hair strand that had fallen onto his face and put it behind the other boy’s ear. While asleep he looked so innocent, unbothered by the cruel world that had raised them.
They landed on his living room floor and Harry felt his nausea coming for him, and this time he wasn’t sure if this one was because of the apparating.
“Can we talk then? About the trip, you know, I’ve been thinking all day… Can I pick you up in one and a half hour then?”
Teddy was the only child that liked him really. But that’s maybe because he still was very young and hadn’t heard all about the war yet. He had babysat Teddy numerous times. To him, it’s surprising that aunt Andromeda even wants anything to do with him, or his mum for that part.
The next day Harry woke up, the exact same way he had the day before, with Christmas up his nose. Except for this time, it was loud as well. He groaned as he got out of bed to get breakfast running. He had to be at the Weasley’s for lunch and so on but for now, finally, it was time to wear actual Christmas clothing and not some fancy-dress robes. Harry looked towards his bag where he knew the stone lay waiting for him. How long had Draco had it in his possession? Did he go out looking for it for Harry? Did he accidentally stumble upon it?
“Might I suggest to not insult the Weasleys nor Ms Granger, not in front of me, Teddy nor Draco but especially not in front of Harry, they’re his family just as much as Draco is yours.” Narcissa got immediately quiet, then whispered, “Why is he even here?” rather aggressively. “Excuse you! He is Teddy’s godfather and has more of a right to be here than you!” He saw Andromeda turn and heard water starting to run. Narcissa tried to say something but did get to because Andromeda yelled, “Final!” deciding that he’d heard enough he crept back to the living room where Teddy and Draco were still sitting, now reading a book together.
Someone must’ve started the light effect because suddenly the light was flashing red, green and white. The music was loud but he still heard the crash, everyone was gathering around a corner on his right, he only needed to see a glimpse of him to know who it was, Draco. Harry immediately stood and pushed through the crowd, Draco had formed himself into a protective ball, hugging his stomach he was shaking had cried on his knees, Harry knew exactly what this is. “Turn off the goddamn lights!” Harry turned around and yelled at the crowd. Someone did and he turned back to Draco. Now Parkinson, Kevin and Craig around him, they all looked at each other before Pansy turned to the crowd behind them, “and what are you all staring at? Carry on,” she then turned to Kevin and Craig, “We’ll handle this Kevin, try to keep everyone away yeah? Don’t let anyone talk shit” Kevin nodded and led Craig away towards the kitchen.
“It means,” She looks around nervously before starting to lead Harry away from the door as well as the crowd. “I’m,” she takes a deep breath “I’m pregnant” Harry stopped, mouth agape as he stares at her. “But-” he stuttered, having problems with actually forming a sentence.
Harry had met the rest of them outside the pub, it was a muggle one which was all Harry really cared about. They waited for Neville to show up while they chatted about lord knows what he didn’t care, the bookstore Draco worked at was around the corner.
Pansy followed and scoffed beside him, “So anyway, Potter followed me on Instagram.” Pansy repeated. “What about it? Is that bad?” Pansy stood stunned as Draco relaxed into his desk chair and took out his phone. “Well, no, but Draco he follows like 20 people on there”
“What are you gonna do?” He asked then, they were still young, mere 25 years old. Not only that but Ron’s trust issues are still something looming over them. “I don’t know” She sighed before continuing, “I know times aren't ideal at the moment, and it certainly wasn’t planned but, at the same time, it’s all I’ve ever wanted. I’m not sure if I knew it before but it just feels so right now that it has happened, oh Harry, what do I do?”
Several drawings and a dinner later he and Potter had been left at the dinner table as Andromeda went up to up Teddy to bed and Narcissa had gone home. Potter was staring out the window where the previous rain had turned into snow and Draco was twirling his wine glass around. The silence was very tense, neither of them willing to break it.
“It’s fine darling” Hermione held Ron’s face him her hands before slowly leaning in a kissed him, “I love you,” Ron told her when they pulled away. “I love you too, I would never hurt you like that,” Hermione smiled.
They arrived at Harry’s apartment, just before he opened the door he remembered it was a mess, “my uhh, it’s a mess, sorry,”  Draco shrugged, “I’ve been at my friend Max’s place, I couldn’t see the floor,” Harry grinned before opening the door, looking self-continuously at Draco, realizing he’s never been to Harry’s apartment before. Walking in with his shoes on he picked up some clothes and walked into the bathroom to change, leaving Draco waiting for him by his door.
Deciding to look for Draco he ventures out on the dance floor, not really feeling for dancing anymore, he never really did in the first place. It was mostly because Draco wanted to that he went to this party in the first place. He looks around if he walks just a meter or so he’ll be met by dancing, or more like jumping bodies, he braced for it and walked through the barrier of people, walking towards the sofa in the corner. He saw Parkinson there, sitting on top of some other guy’s lap and decided to sit down next to them, “hiya,” he almost screamed in her direction, she raised her eyebrow but screamed “hello,” back, “you seem lost,” she says pointing at him, still sitting on the other man’s lap. “I lost Draco, so yeah, I am,” Parkinson giggled a little at that, “famous Potter, spending time with Draco Malfoy on valentine’s day huh,” Harry felt like he should argue, because this isn’t spending time, it’s the last thing it is really, but he simply shrugged. “It’s either that or spend time alone in my apartment and I think this is better to be honest.” beside him Parkinson nodded and took a shug of her drink. “Y’know,” she clicked her tongue and leaned closer to him, “you can have ANYBODY you want, wizard or not. Draco can’t,” Harry raised his eyebrows, “why not?” Parkinson rolled her eyes at him, “his family name mate, his family name and all the things it represents, and listen to this,” she continues. “If you hurt him, and I mean this, I don’t care if the evilest wizard ever wasn’t able to kill you because I will,”
“Am I allowed to take his place?” He asked the remaining crowd who made place so he could sit down. “How are you?” He whispered to Hermione which he now sat next to, she gave him a weak thumbs-up, “I’m puking all the time and my feet are extremely swollen but what’s new,” She whispered back. “Do the other’s know?” He said, still whispering, Hermione shakes her head in response.
“The Potter family,” Draco read for him, “A very old family, direct descendants from none other than Ignotus Peverell, the third brother from the child's tale, the deathly Hallows and Linfred of Stinchcombe nicknamed ‘the Potterer’ from which the surname has sprung from, a pioneering potioneer whose today credited with creating many original medical potions.” Harry stared at the text that Draco was somehow reading upside down, “And here-” Draco pointed at a line, “Ever since the 12th century the Potters have been from Great Britain or Ireland until Fleamont Potter (1892-1979) married Indian Euphemia Khida (1890-1980) and had James Potter (1960-1981) possibly making him the first biracial Potter since its founding.” Harry read out loud, “Go on,” Draco egged, “James Potter then went on to marry muggle-born Lily Evans (1960-1981) and had their first and only son Harry Potter (1980-present) possibly making him the first half-blood Potter in centuries.”
Draco can’t help but smile at the sad emoji attached to Harry’s message. If he only has one shift that must mean he’s definitely texting on the job.
The entire time they were walking towards Draco’s apartment they were quiet. They walked side by side, although Draco did notice the look on Potter’s face and how he kept looking at him like he wanted to say something, finally on the last set of staircases by grabbing his jacket sleeve.
Harry smiled at him and Draco slowly let the flask to his lips and drank its contents and Harry visibly signed in relief, “we can’t apparate from here can we?” Harry whispered towards Pansy who shook her head, “we’ll have to wait it out for a while to get him outside,” pansy whispered back. Harry sat down beside Draco who visibly had calmed down, “Hey there,” Harry said sitting down as close to Draco as he dared, Draco turned his head towards him and smiled a strained smile, “you’re okay, we’re not going to leave,” he whispered as Pansy came up to sit on his other side.
This day turned from normal and boring to shockingly weird. Harry thought as he walked towards the closest bus stop that’d take him home. If he was honest he was a little worried how Ron would react but, Ron’s no moron, he’d do fine, probably. If everything went as planned, Harry might be an uncle, having to stand still to do that math he realised the baby would come around his own birthday.
And besides, Harry wasn’t gay, for sure, but he knew when a man looked good and damn, Draco did look incredible.
“Hero complex” Draco cooed which was when Harry turned around and left, Draco jumped out of bed after him, “Hey, where are you going?” he asked when he was greeted with Harry putting on his shoes, “My shift starts at 12,” Harry muttered, “okay, then you still have one and a half hour?” Draco leaned against the wall, not really wanting Harry to leave.
Much to his surprise, Sabrina did not break into his house but rather, attack him when he got to work, much exhausted from not sleeping enough and Pansy being with him the whole day. “Good afternoon Mr Grinch” she greeted him cheeringly when he came through the back door and into the shop, he glared at her, causing her to giggle before going back into the main shop to help customers. Not before she could tell him to take the cashier though. Draco sighed as he clocked him, put on his polite smile and stood himself in front of the cashier.
“Hm, you celebrated with the Malfoy’s yesterday, right?” she asked him, probably trying to start a conversation. “I was,” Ginny rolled her eyes at him, “Well, then, did you have a good time? Where they way too fancy for you or did you secretly like it?”
Well there he was greeted with hugs from every angle and it was practically impossible to get away, but he was home again, so it was fine. He was surrounded by people he considered family anyway.
Harry wondered think back to all of his crushes, Cho, Ginny and… no one else. Obviously. Harry signed deeply and leaned his head on the sofa and closes his eyes.
A loud cheering boomed within the huge crowd and Pansy set off the fireworks to join the rest of them that were not lighting up the sky.
The bus ride to his apartment lasts 20 minutes, 10 that he has to go by himself. He called them the procrastination minutes. Where his mind drifted away and he could imagine that everything was fine.
“A child?” Harry asked, his mouth full of potatoes, “No, no, unless you’d like to bring Teddy of course, but girlfriend,” she said pointedly and let herself glance towards Ginny, who groaned, “No mum, not happening,”
Finally putting on his glasses and trying to make his hair somewhat flatter he then exited the bathroom.
When they’d gotten their food they ate in silence, until a thought struck Draco, “Did you know most English pureblood houses come from different countries?”
Harry stared at it for a moment. It felt too real. This was a step in a life so far from him. He chuckled a little bit “I’m surprised you went so long without knowing.” and she nodded.
I wanted to come on here and thank you all, every read, comment, bookmark and kudos reminds me of how lucky I am to have you all. I am incredibly grateful for every single one.
Being out trying to help people out in such a small space when there’s so many of them were hard. He was also sure he had some girls in the corner staring and giggling towards him, it was uncomfortable, to say the least, and he regrets coming in, in the first place. “I hate this” he whispered towards his coworker at the cashier as he walked by and she laughed quietly at him and smiled at the customers as they walked by as well.
“So you’re going out from work soon then?” Hermione asked hopefully. “If I can, I’ll ask the manager-” looking up from the phone he looks up at his manager who’s staring at him, after 10 seconds of intense staring he gives Harry a thumbs up before turning back to his computer. “He says okay”
Pansy stayed with him until his bus came, saying she was going to go the Hermione and Ron’s place to hang out/have lunch. Draco was totally fine with her having more friends than him. He did too. He’d invited her to the party and she’d agree to come, saying she should leave Ron and Hermione alone for most of the evening since it was valentine's day after all.
“Well yeah, I’d gotten a glass of wine and he had made himself a cup of coffee or something. We were talking about reckless decisions that are made in… the situation we were in as kids, right?” Sabrina nodded and leaned closer. “Aaaaand?” Draco turned his head towards her, their faces just being 2 inches apart. “And he said ‘here’s a reckless decision. Let’s travel Europe this summer’ or something like it.” Which to Sabrina squealed once again hitting his arm. “It’s happening!” Draco rolled his eyes and looked up at the ceiling. “I don’t know, I mean it’s a half years until summer, he or I, might change our minds.” Which to it was Sabrina’s turn to roll her eyes, “Come on, Draco? That won’t happen. You guys are friends now, why would he cancel?”
Draco wanted to snap but didn’t, Harry sighed, “did we cuddle?” When Draco turns around Harry has one hand in his hair, like he was in the middle of combing it with his hands but stopped mid-way. Draco didn’t know what he should say.
“Why are you being so cold to me?” Pansy now stood on the right to Draco hands on his desk, staring at him. Draco only glared back. “Because…” Draco started but never finished the sentence he just looked back at his phone, up at Pansy and then stood up and walked over to the kitchen. “Because of what?!”
. The thought of it makes him jerk out of Harry’s hold. Harry stirring slightly at the loss of Draco around him. Draco stared out the open window, hugging his knees, “fuck,” he whispered. He rose from the bed, retrieving his phone and putting on a sweater he checked his emails, getting greeted with both his professors say that their lectures would be cancelled, they were rumoured to have a love affair and Draco wouldn’t be the least surprised if that was the reason they’d both cancelled. Putting on a pair of pyjama bottoms he wobbled out to the kitchen, getting tea started, slightly afraid to rise Potter from his peaceful sleep.
“Fuck,” Draco sighed to himself as he tried to stand up and flex his neck, and grunted when it brought him nothing but pain.
“Alright, but they don’t have that in the summer though, do they?” Potter sighed beside him and the pouted. “No, they don’t,” Draco smirked at him, “I’ve heard Sweden is beautiful though, we can go there too if you want?” Draco asked and Potter nodded beside him. “Alright so, the Nordics. Do we go to Finland?” Potter nodded “Sure,” Draco then stood and walked over to his desk, returning with pen and paper. “Okay, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Poland, any more you can think of?” Draco asked looking up at Potter who had the Europe map in his hands and was studying it very intensely. “Iceland.” Was all he said, and Draco nodded and wrote it up. “How about Ireland?” Draco suggested and Potter nodded beside him, “Sounds nice, write it up,” Potter answered. “If we visit Denmark as well I’ll create an easier route to follow where we wouldn’t need a lot of flying everywhere,” Potter said without looking up from the map, Draco nodded and wrote it down. “Germany as well, then?” He asked Potter nodded.
“What?” Harry asked he was mopping the floors. He looked up at Malfoy that moment. And Harry was not sure to believe Hermione when she said that he’d changed. Studying Malfoy in silence before continuing to mop the floor. He heard Malfoy take a sharp breath, “Do you-” He started and Harry stopped his mopping once again to look up at Malfoy, “Do I what?”
“Never thought I’d hear Draco and gay pornography in the same sentence, yet I just did, hello, can I help you with something?” A woman rounded the corner looking Hermione up and down with a smile, before turning to Harry, probably to do the same but stopped when she saw his face in full view.
“Oh nothing,” Ginny waved and walked back to the family, “What.” Harry mouthed to himself before following her.
Sabrina took her hands out of Draco and Pansy’s to dry her tears. “How do you know they’re dead? How do you know they’re in prison? How do you know that they aren’t out there roaming the streets? Huh?” To which Draco looked up at Pansy and looked around the room and then back at Sabrina and then at the floor. “Sabrina there’s only one legitimate death eater, you know, who took the mark, that is out roaming the streets.”
Harry had gone home to take a shower, it’s not that he lied to Draco about it, he did take a shower, his shift did start at twelve. But it did feel like he was lying, to whom he did not know. Perhaps himself or worse, to Draco. Draco doesn’t deserve that. But when Harry stood in the shower thinking back to Draco in trackies and a jumper, quietly reading while drinking tea, so what if he got hard by the sight of it? Doesn’t necessarily mean he’s gay, especially not for, for Draco fucking Malfoy, not that it’s anything bad being Draco Malfoy but, it’d be weird, Harry’s mind decided.
They weren’t supposed to use that much flour but it had simply ended up everywhere, Teddy’s eyes were bright, flour on his nose, he’d smacked Draco’s cheek, his hand full of flour and Draco couldn’t do else but roll his eyes at while Teddy giggled mischievously. While the cake cooled Draco ran him a bath so they could get all the flour out of Teddy’s hair, Teddy hadn’t helped, laughing while changing his hair colour to the same as flour, looking up, trying to see his hair in excitement, only to make Draco sigh while laughing tiredly. They made an easy dinner and Teddy ate before demanding he could eat the cake. They ate the cake and Draco put Teddy to bed. He’d read him a story, Teddy fitting just right against his chest so that he could read with him slowly. Draco tugged him a sleeping Teddy around 20:30, his hair now his natural curly brown and Draco ran his fingers through it,
Potter nodded as well as he could from the angle that his neck was currently in. “Here’s a weird impulse…” Potter started.
“I still hate that you’re so much taller than I can I just say that?” Harry started, “That’s one way to start a conversation I guess,” Draco replied and sniggered. “No like, I JUST thought about it, fuck you, tallboy,” Draco snorted and patted Harry on the top of his head and jokingly saying, “Later, maybe,” by which Harry became RED, “I- I’m not-” Harry began but were interrupted by Draco’s laughing, “I was kidding,” Harry made some sort of face of realization and said a quiet “oh,”
“Now that you're all here you can stop being so quiet” Teddy commanded and sat himself beside Potter on the sofa, turning his hair black to match Harry's.
When they went inside they met up with the rest of their friends, Draco walking up to Kevin, grabbing him by the arm and whispering “My medicine isn’t out yet, can you share your notes with me?” and pulled away, “Yeah, sure,” Kevin said and they walked together into the lecture hall.
I'm just saying, I'm sorry but you'll have to have patience with the next chapter as well, school workload is heavily increasing and I have no idea when I'll be able to sit down and actually write.
Beside him, Hermione choked on her water, but no one paid much attention to her at all, most of them looking over at Aubrey.
“The trip,” Potter confirmed and an awkward silence spread between them as they just sat and stared at each other. “Oh goddamnit!” Draco exclaimed and walked over to the bookshelf aggressively, pulling out an atlas and returned to the couch, finding the Europe map as Potter stares intensely at him. “You said you wanted to go to Norway, yeah?” Draco asked as he scrolled. “Yes,” Potter replied. Draco squinted his eyebrows as he tried to think of a route to take, “Anywhere else?” Draco looked up at Potter as he studied the map. “How about… Poland? I want to visit Auschwitz, and also, I’ve heard they have an ice hotel in Sweden, like, completely made out of ice and stuff.”
I promise I haven't abandoned this fic, the process is just going, very slowly. I've learned my lesson though, I'm not gonna post until I'm completely done with a fic to 100% so I won't have to make changes and stuff. I'll keep posting this whenever I get done with a chapter but... ehhh, not the other ones I'm writing.
“Café, Draco!” Ava called from the other side of the lecture hall the next day. “Keep dreaming” He yelled back. His good friend Craig accompanied him on the way out. A difference from the others he didn’t constantly nag him about going to café Cursed beans. He didn’t go there unless he really needed to. AKA for group projects. However, Craig didn’t take the bus and couldn’t shield him from Sabrina.
Harry stared at the name, his grandfather. It must be, even though the numbers were very far apart. He goes up another row,
Harry cleared his throat to get Draco’s attention before saying, “I’ll be on my way then,” Draco looked up at him and nodded, “I wouldn’t go out in those clothes if I were you but then again, I am not,” he opened a drawer to look inside, probably for a pyjamas. “No matter how much you’d want to be,” Harry smirked, and Draco turned to glare in his direction. “Bye, thanks for the stone, again,” Harry scratched his neck turning around towards the door. “No problem,” Draco said, now standing in the doorway, pyjamas in hand. “I’m leaving now,” Harry announced, “Really? You don’t seem to be,” Draco teased and rolled his eyes. “Okay now I’m really leaving,” Harry said, slowly walking towards the door, and opening it slowly, “Bye,”
, Draco thought when he’d closed the door, returning to his bed, he had to be at Andromeda’s at 4 pm but that was a while until.
I'm so sorry this took months, again, finals have treated me badly and then my family decided that a family trip to a place without wifi for three weeks was a good idea, it wasn't. Oh well, here it is anyway.
And now, he was out eating dinner with Hermione and Ron and Malfoy was with his friends on the other side of the restaurant.
“Well, that was a different turn of conversation than I expected,” Pansy said after the door had shut behind Sabrina. “Oh shut up,” Draco said and went back to sit down by his computer.
“Coming to the café today Draco?” Sabrina asked as they walked out from their last lecture of the day. “No thanks, I’m going to my mum’s again today” He answered as he put on his winter coat and Sabrina raised her eyebrow slightly. “But what about that cute barista you can’t keep your eyes off?”
One and a half hour came and went faster than Draco would have prefered. And he didn’t remember that Potter had come over to tell basically tell him that he was going to pick him up after work until he saw him outside the shop in the cold. “Fucks sake” Draco mumbled and took out one of his earphones that was playing music as he walked up to him. “Hi” Draco then proceeded to greet him tiredly. “Oh hi!” Potter greeted back and took out both of his earphones, “So… your place?” Potter asked and Draco nodded, “This way,” Draco said and started walking towards his apartment.
By the way, I am trilingual (Swedish, English and French, ish) so, I would say that I'm qualified to say that, that's an accurate representation of knowing several languages, don't come at me.
“What you feel is right I suppose. If you want this... This baby, then, it’s your decision to make, I think Ron would want it too you know” Hermione looked up at him before reaching into her handbag and pulling a Clearblue pregnancy test that with bold lines said:
“He hates killing, even has a problem killing mosquitos” Pansy sighed. “Who is it?” Sabrina looked up at Pansy a look between sadness and anger on her face.
“So,” Draco sat down and clasped his hands together after he’d gone taken the water of the kettle and preparing a tray of different teas as well as sugar and milk. “The trip,”
“You know, you should get a driving license,” Harry says then and Draco looks up at him again, “why?”
“Gosh, um, Do you have any contact with the magical world?” Harry raised an eyebrow to that and began to mop unconsciously. “Not really no, Hermione said you didn’t either?” Malfoy shook his head, “The only contact I have is through my friends and mother” Harry nodded. “Do you ever? Miss it?” Malfoy pressed on “Sometimes, but not really,” And there they stood in silence and looked at each other. Until Harry coughed and asked if there was something else, Draco said no and left. Leaving Harry to question his life choices.
“I’ll go home and tell him now,” Hermione said, carefully putting the book down in her bag before taking a deep breath “Wish me luck” She hugged Harry goodbye to walk towards the actual apparition spot.
Opening his own apartment door and seeing the dark apartment he took of his shoes and coat at the door without turning on the light. Not minding to put his laptop to charge he brushed his teeth in the darkness and dropped down on his bed. He stared at his bedroom. The colour theme of white, grey and emerald green could barely be seen in the darkness. He crawled under the covers and took out his extra pair of headphones from his nightstand not even reacting when the brightness of his phone lights up the room. As he put on some calm but sad songs he felt himself go on overload. Maybe it’s the wine, maybe it isn’t, he doesn’t know. It wasn’t that today had been bad, quite the opposite really. It had been very good. But he was tired and he could almost feel the bottle where he bottle up his feeling are tripping and then it spills. The tears almost go unnoticed as he drowns himself in the songs playing in his ears.
“Do you want some tea? I can put the kettle on,” Draco asked, again trying to start a conversation, and while he kind of succeeded it was very awkward. A “Yes, please,” could be heard from the other side of the room where the sofa was. After putting the kettle on Draco turns around and sees Potter on the other side of the room, sitting in his sofa, uncomfortably. Draco walks over to his sofa and sits down beside Potter. “You do know my mother thinks this is very cheap and insisted that she’d give me access to our vault,” He says, taking in the one bedroom apartment that he was currently living in. “You don’t have access to your family’s vault?” Potter asked, raising an eyebrow. “Do you really think I’d be working if I’d have access to a vault with enough money to support me as well as several generations after me?”
“Is it time to go already?” Andromeda walked downstairs as Potter was putting his coat on, still talking to Draco who was leaning against the wall with his hands in his pockets. “Yeah, sadly, I have work tomorrow.” To which Andromeda crossed her arms. “On a Saturday? Harry James Potter” Potter snickers and Draco couldn’t help not to join in. “Yes, cafés are open on Saturdays as well, I’ll walk to the apparition point. Have a good night,” he waved towards Andromeda and then nodded towards Draco who nodded back.
, Harry realizes, “I’ll see you tomorrow then, Potter,” Draco waved and walked onto campus and Harry didn’t move until Draco had walked into a building,
An hour later Harry sat with Draco and Teddy in the living room playing a board game, Andromeda and Narcissa in the kitchen cleaning up, though Harry suspected that is was just Andromeda who was doing the cleaning. Suddenly Harry hears voices being raised and looked up at Draco who stares back at him and mouths “Go,” nodding towards the kitchen and then looks back to the board game and Teddy. Harry makes an excuse that he has to go to the toilet and tiptoes towards the kitchen.
“And people wonder why I own a heating pad,” he sighed as he penguin walked over to the kitchen to warm it, when it was warm he put it on his neck and did that same penguin walk over to his bedroom, plugging in his phone to charge. “At least I have no lecture to attend today” He collapsed on top of his bed, grunting at the pain in his neck.
Draco woke up with a mild sense of confusion. Mostly due to the fact that there was someone else in his bed, he was positive he hadn’t brought anyone home from the party Draco slowly breathed in the other person’s embrace and actually found it comforting,
Did I say I'd post more regularly? Well... no, didn't happen. Exams really be like that sometimes :)
Now all eyes were on Harry who were beaming, “Harry actually knew before you did,” Hermione said to Ron who turned back to her with a surprised glance and looked back at Harry who shrugged, “She called me and demanded I went home early so I could help her decide how to tell you, mate,” Harry said cheeringly and shrugged, smiling at both Hermione and Ron.
They were quiet for a bit before she looked up at Harry again and whispered. “Do you really think he’d want it too?” Her voice sounded of both doubt and hope and Harry nodded.
“Harry!” Ron violently ribbed up the door, “Huh?” Harry paused his cooking to stare at Ron in surprise. “Harry you’re not going to believe it!” Ron took off his coat and shoes in a rush to be able to go and shake Harry like he was a maraca. Harry looked at him in confusion as he did this. “What?”
“Yeah,” he decided one after a beat of silence and Harry cursed under his breath. Suddenly offended Draco stared at him for an explanation, Harry got out of bed, stood and paused and Draco watched in confusion when Harry turned to walk out to the living space, turning around again, “I’m sorry if I crossed any line last night I-” Draco stared and slowly put his book down, “Potter unless we shagged last night you really haven’t,” something flashed across Harry’s face at the use of his last name before his cheeks tinted red at the mention of shagging, Draco felt his cheeks heat as well but felt no shame in it. “We, uh, didn’t,” Harry said and Draco gave him a thumbs up. “Great, that’s way less embarrassing,” he smiled at Harry. “Thank you for everything you did last night though, and really, if you’re hungry you can just.. take whatever,” Harry was holding the door frame, “it’s nothing really,” Harry said.
Hours came and went, customers came and went, but Draco stayed. He’d gotten done with his essay around 11 and stayed to chat with Harry during the last hour of the shift and saying hello to the next employées coming in to replace Harry.
“That’s what I wondered as well, he said that he stumbled upon them in a store in Knockturn Alley, but what would they do there?” Harry wondered out loud. Suddenly Ginny’s eyes lit up from nowhere, “Wait here for just a moment, I got to ask dad a thing,” She said rushing down the stairs where Harry sat still, waiting for her return.
“Of course, he has” Draco smiled at the floor. “I’ll join, I suppose” He tried to look posh looking back at this mother like she didn’t just see him smiling down at the floor when she mentioned that Teddy missed him. “Something else?” He asked.
The bus stopped half way where Sabrina said goodbye and walked towards the cafè ahead. Draco watches her go and as she walked into the cafè he sees Potter by the cashier, he was taking orders and smiling at his customers. Draco hopes Potter doesn't see him through the huge windows. As the bus starts he looks away from the cafè and down on his phone. Music would be very welcome at this moment.
When Harry got home he crashed on his bed with thoughts of Dean and Seamus smiling and then of Draco, Draco in trackies and a jumper, Draco reading in the soft morning light and the feeling of belonging, he slept well.
“I just really don’t like the Weasleys why is that so bad?!” He hears Narcissa claim. “Even if you don’t like them doesn’t mean you have to tell us that constantly, the world has changed Cissy,” the nickname coming through pained. “Changed to what?” She bit back, he hears Andromeda sigh before saying, “Look, if Harry were to insult the Malfoy family you would be completely outraged, wouldn’t you?”
He remembers being 17 years old, he remembers Hagrid carrying a dead Harry Potter in his arms and Voldemort’s army march towards the fallen castle. He remembers the battle so clearly, it could’ve been yesterday. He remembers the feeling of relief when Potter turns out to not be dead. Because maybe hope wasn’t lost.
Harry suddenly thought about the stones, “Hey, Hermione!” Harry suddenly said, “What?” she asked, confused. “Can we speak, like in private,” Hermione ducked her head in response, “Is it super important?” She asked. “Yes,” Harry grabbed her hand in a rush. “Can’t we wait until after dinner? I’d rather not stand,”  she says, a shy smile on her lips.
They’d gone downstairs again, tea gone cold they sat at the kitchen table enjoying each others company.
Waking up on your sofa the next day to find yourself with torticollis from having your neck in a weird angle sleeping on the sofa, isn’t the nicest of things. Nonetheless, stinking breath and the smell of ice cream remains that’d been there all night isn’t much better.
Listen, I know what I said and it didn't happen it's just... I'm not gonna go on excuses... HOWEVER, this one is pretty long and I had a difficult time writing the party which is why it took so long.
The third chapter might take a while to get up, but I do hope I get some time next week to write but as it looks atm I'll be pretty busy. I've been knew that I posted two chapters the same day but listen, I didn't want to wait with the second one plus the number of words looked and still looks, too small so...
“Yeah, I'm trying something new” he breathed sitting down beside her. “You've never seen him like that?” Harry asked, looking up from where he was colouring with Teddy. “Not since he was a baby, no, I think the last time was when he was Teddy's age” she hmed. Potter snorted, “What's so funny?” Teddy now also looked up.
“I mean it was a while ago but in school, we came to the subject once, you know what he said?” Hermione shaking her head gently, still staring down at the test. “That he’d like to have kids, not as many as his mother was an important note I remember, already back then he said that” Hermione nodded again. “But that was before the war, wasn’t it?” Which to Harry nodded and hugged her. “Everything doesn’t change with war Hermione, even if it was the thing bringing you both together then, the only thing you’d have to work on is his trust issues, but we’ve dealt with them before, haven’t we? If he goes on being a jerk about it, you can come and stay here for a while but I doubt that he will be a jerk about it.”
I got a writer's block after writing the dinner with Ron and Hermione lmao. I also wanted to say that I don't know how the amount of writing will be looking during the summer. Both my parents are healthcare professionals and I have no idea if they're going to get any vacation at all. Therefore it is unpredictable to know if I'll be home to post or not since we don't have any wifi at my summer house, just a warning I guess... Now! Enjoy!
“I got to know two days ago” and Harry hmed trying, and failing, to choose words that are some kind of comfort.
“Alright,” Draco said to Teddy when Andromeda had left, “wanna bake?” he asked, not even looking at Teddy, rather the door in the front of them. “Yes!” Teddy jumped, took Draco’s hand and walked them into the kitchen.
“You look horrible, has something happened?” She said, a matter of factly at the same time as she managed to look and sound, concerned.
“Why a barista?” Draco asked a half an hour and two glasses of wine later. Potter shrugged, “Seemed fun” Draco huffed, “Sure, but you could’ve chosen ANYTHING and you chose to be a barista at some muggle café, really?” Potter shrugged again, “I guess it’s simple, but why do we choose anything in life really. Most are just impulses of things aren’t they?” Potter leaned back into his chair and looked up in the ceiling, looking blankly at the shadows that the lamp left on it.
“Potter I don't know if you know but we have plenty in common” Draco kept twirling his wine glass around without looking up. “Like?” Potter asks doubtfully. And Draco side-eyed him.
“Well then,” Harry says, stuffing his whole face full with food, “I’ll be there, sooner or later” Ron gives him a thumbs up and Harry keeps eating.
Harry’s gaze shifted back to Luna’s dresser, a framed wizarding photo, it’s summer, a much younger Draco has a flower crown on his head, blowing white flower petals from his hand, beside him Ginny, who also wore a flower crown on top of her head, laughed. Harry picked it up, ran a finger by the edge of the photo.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked the obvious question because why did Potter even know where the fuck he worked, not only that but why the fuck was he there. “Um, I, when do you get out of work?” Draco stared at Potter on the other side of the cashier counter. “In one and a half hour... Why?”
“Yes? Please hurry up my warm shower is waiting for me, mother, and my bill is rapidly going up I suspect.” His mother chuckled at that. “Harry Potter will also be joining us” Draco stared at his mother. The world has cursed him he decided. “Okay,” He said casually, though he suspected it sounded rather strained. “Okay, go continue your shower darling” Narcissa waved as she disappeared from the fireplace. “Fuck,” He said to his apartment as he stood and walked towards the bathroom to continue his precious shower.
Harry, ignoring her, sits down next to Ron on the sofa, “What ya watching?” He asks him with a mouth full of food. “I don’t know Harry, something”
“I guarantee you, because, if this is Colin Creevey we’re talking about, which I’m pretty sure it is?” Pansy waited for Sabrina to nod before continuing. “He died a hero’s death, I know it doesn’t make it any better, you still lost him,” Pansy looked up at Draco who smiled a sad smile. “A lot of death happened that day, I know nothing can justify what that death eater did to him, but at least they’re dead...or in prison...”
“Will you guys ever stop bullying me for not being able to cook?” Hermione shakes her head and the other two just laughed. “I guess I have my answer there,”
Harry carefully placed the coffee mug beside Draco’s books, Harry smiled, “It’s on the house,” Draco glared, “If you give me free drinks how am I supposed to use up that gift card you gave me?” Harry shrugged, “You can go to a different café, or not come in stressed as you did just now,” From somewhere Harry fished up a wet cloth and started wiping down the counter. “Then why give me free drinks?” Draco repeated, Harry, still wiping the counter, smiled and then shrugged. Without looking up at Draco he said: “To make you come back?” Draco’s mind stilled for just a moment before straightening himself up and remembering he had work to do.
“I need your help to decide on something so I was wondering if... You’d like to go out shopping a little, yeah? Before you say anything, I know you hate shopping, but this is REALLY important” Harry feels himself raise an eyebrow when hearing that, “Alright, I’ve worked over time anyway, I can go home now, we have enough employees here anyway.”
Draco, bamboozled, couldn’t do anything other than stare. “With you?” He repeated just to be sure he heard it right. “Yeah” Potter let out a breathy laugh. “I have always wanted to see Europe as well, but it’d be weird to go by yourself, would it not?” Potter turned his head and smiled at Draco who smiled back. “I guess so, let’s to it.”
“So anyway, RON” Hermione coughed on the side from their little pillow war that immediately stilled. “What?” Ron peeked out from behind a pillow. “Oh, I just thought we were going to tell Harry about the thing we talked about on the way here no?” upon hearing those words Ron scrambled up from his current position on the sofa to a much more formal one and Harry suddenly got very worried about their as well as his own well being. “So, um, Am I supposed to?” Ron gestured to himself and then Hermione, “Yes Ron, if you want,” Ron then nodded and turned his head towards Harry, “So we, um, Harry…”
As his phone restarted it started to pling like they were in a war situation. Message upon message upon message. Draco groaned from his bed.
The next time Harry met Malfoy was while he was working, Malfoy along with some presumably muggles wandered into the café talking loudly trying to decide on their orders. Today, however, Harry couldn’t hide in the back while Malfoy was there, he was working cashier. “If you’re ready I can take your orders” Harry called out rather impatient one from the group coming forward to give him an order. And slowly they all got their orders, all of them getting different hot drinks and some of them getting a pastry as well.
Being in Draco’s apartment alone, even if it was for just a couple of seconds was nerve-wracking. He felt afraid to touch anything even if it wasn’t fancy. He hadn’t noticed before how many plants Draco had, but they were everywhere, on the walls, on the floor, on top of tabletops, desks, shelves and counters. This was a small space yet there must be like 50 different plants.
Everyone filtered out to the field close to the place the party was held in Pansy herself climbing up on the roof to reveal several boxes of fireworks, there everyone stood, probably over 100 people in one place, standing close together to not freeze to death, chatting about their evenings and lives, most of them at least slightly intoxicated, Draco turned away from his friends to try and see if Sabrina was present, but he couldn’t find her anywhere. A little disappointed he turned back to the rest of his friend group and decided that her being mad at him shouldn’t ruin his evening.
He remembers being 17 years old, Voldemort is back and everyone knows, he is one of them, his followers. He regrets it. And he can admit now that he was just a teenager, doing everything to stay alive through this war.
“You need to let loose Dray,” She said, a smile on her face before she left for the crowd currently dancing widely, in the main room. Draco goes and fills a cup with more vodka before exiting the barroom and onto the main one, he had unbuttoned two of the buttons on his shirt and were wearing black high-waisted jeans, he glanced in the mirror he concluded that he did look quite hot, the scar that was left behind from the death eater mark, now a mere scar was also making an appearance since he had rolled up his sleeves to right below his elbows. The room he entered had a lack of air and smelled like sweat from people jumping and dancing together, the music deafening. Seeing a couple of tables in a corner he walked over them, seeing as to in comparison to the rest of the room it was just as packed,
“Draco!” Pansy face showing up through the fireplace, making Sabrina, whom Draco was hanging out with at the time, jump up from her place on top of his sofa and scream. “DRACO THERE’S A FLOATING HEAD IN YOUR FIREPLACE!”
” Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco who just shrugged. He opened it to find a very red stone lined in silver in addition to a silver chain, to his surprise, he looked over at Draco who smiled, “It’s emerald,” Draco told him, “Uh, thanks?” he said, sounding confused as to why Draco would give him a red emerald stone. Draco rolled his eyes at him. “No stupid, here,” He said and took it from the box and put it on Harry’s robes. “It’s supposed to represent from which house you’re from, that’s the Potter one, believe me, I’ve done my research.” Harry’s mouth formed an o as he watched Draco secure it on his robes, he couldn’t help but smile fondly at him. “Is that the Malfoy one then?” Harry asked and pointed at the bright blue stone decorating Draco’s neck, “It sure is,”
As he walked into his bedroom to get his pyjamas he glanced up at the top drawer on the left side, it was a very special one, containing his wand. Amongst other small magical things. He hadn’t held it since two years ago when he got it from Gringotts. A sudden feeling of longing to hold something magical again overwhelmed him as he opened the drawer and picked up his wand. His life had been surrounded by the magic he was holding in his bare hands at that very moment.
“So what was that?” Sabrina said, pointing at the fireplace where Pansy’s head had just disappeared. “Uh, magic?” Draco said though it sounded more like a question.
“I think you do understand exactly what I mean,” He said after he had composed himself, glaring at his mother who raised her hands in defeat. “Now, now” Andromeda calmed them.
“But Draco and I aren’t together or anything,” Harry said, now defensively, “I’m not gay!” he exclaimed but Pansy just hm: ed and turned back to the guy whose lap she was still sitting on, “keep telling yourself that, tell him hi when you find him,” she waved as she dragged the guy towards the middle of the dancing floor.
“So how’s school going Draco?” Harry hears Narcissa speak to her son gently, watches as Draco glances at his mother before looking back at his food, starting to slowly chew again. After swallowing he slowly says, “Stressful… but fun,” Harry watches him, he guesses that he’d waited for his mother to comment something rude about muggle schools, but instead she smiles at him and tells him, “Well, that’s good,”
“Well then don’t stand there like a fool, come in,” Draco said from the kitchen. And Potter walked carefully on the floor like it was made out of glass.  “This unexpectedly more… middle class than I imagined,” Potter commented on his way over to the sofa. “Is that a compliment or no?” Draco asked.
With his bag packed and fancy coat thrown over his black turtleneck, he shugs a glass of water, turns off the lights and exits his apartment. He jogs down the stairs while pulling up his app for bus times. Next one coming in 2 min. He jogs faster, out and around the corner and run straight into someone, Pansy. “I’m sorry Pansy but my bus comes any second I gotta go,” Pansy almost jumps up and run after him, “Where you going?” She asks. “Harry’s job” Pansy give him a sideways look, “why?” Draco rolls his eyes and walks faster, “Merlin Pansy, do I have to have a reason for everything I do?”
With his backpack on his pack, he walked towards the bathroom and locked after himself. He took off his glasses and then his jumper and stared plainly at his chest in the mirror. There, in the middle of his chest where a lightning bolt. Identical to the one on his forehead but newer and hidden to the world. He ran his fingers over it before sighing and putting on his dress robes in a hurry.
Harry realised he didn’t know and it wasn’t like he was just going to go over there and ask, that’d be super weird. He made lunch and apparated to Luna’s deciding to not give it further thought. “Hi Harry,” Luna said, opening the door for him to go in, Luna had, together with her father rebuilt their entire house since the war and it almost looked the same. “It didn’t quite expect you yet,” Harry raised his eyebrows, “why not? the clock is two isn’t it?” Luna nodded, “oh yes, but you always tend to be five minutes late,” Harry blushed in embarrassment, “do I really?” Luna nodded, “almost always,” she led them into the kitchen where the kettle was on the stove already. “So what’ve you been up to?” Harry asked, for lacking anything else to say, “oh, I painted quite a lot just now,” she pointed upwards, towards her room he guessed, “would you like to see it?” Harry nodded absentminded.
“I do keep up thank you very much, now I got to go back to them talking about, eh, pride next year I think? Bye Potter, thanks for the latte” Harry nodded in response and shot Malfoy his have-a-good-day barista smile. To hear an “OMG DRACO YOU’RE SO GAY” from a girl in the group and laughing to himself before shaking his head and going back to work.
For just a couple of minutes later his doorbell rings. He’s in the middle of an episode of Friends and not only that but also in the middle of his breakfast and the doorbell rings. Curse it, he thinks as he stands up to open the door.
“They had to see where you’d end up?” Draco rolled his eyes, “Maybe that’s part of it.” Harry raised an eyebrow, “So, where’s the Malfoy family in this?” Draco shrugged again, “I didn’t include it.” Draco closed the folder and put it back in his bag, not looking at Harry. “Well, what’s the book called?” Harry urged, interested in reading said book, Draco glared at him, “Britain's magical families, past and present,” he muttered and Harry made a mental note. “Thanks, buddy,” He patted Draco on the shoulder and stood up, “I’ll pay, when does your next lecture start?” Harry watched Draco look down on his phone and make a face, “In 45 minutes,” Draco said and stood up as well, putting his phone down on the table and reached for his coat, that second a message popped up and Harry couldn’t help but read:
It kind of freaks him out. He’s in Draco Malfoy’s apartment, in his bedroom, in his bed, under his cover, which he was also sleeping under. This is so not straight. Harry realized but isn’t majorly faced by it. Because after all, this situation might be kind of wacky he found that he didn’t really care what it looked like.
“Draco?” Pansy asked nervously after they’d sat a while in silence eating ice cream on Draco’s couch. “What?” Draco sighed back. “You know, you are not a bad person, right? I saw some quote on Pinterest, is it called that?” Draco nodded and she continued “It said ‘who we are and who we need to be to survive are two completely different things’, or something like that.”  Draco sighed again into his ice cream. “Those quotes are bullshit you do know,” Draco looked over at her and smiled, not quite genuine but one of those small little innocent smiles that you share with friends in happy times.
“Is it okay if I stay the night? I dunno when the trains go and I don’t have my wand with me so I can’t apparate.” Andromeda hmed back, “Why don’t you just go with Harry then? Of course, I’d love to have you but, muggle trains seems like a lot of work when you’ve drunk an entire bottle of wine,” Draco sighed “Do you mind?” He asked Potter who was about to open the door but stopped abruptly. “No, not at all,” He stepped in again as Draco put on his boots and jacket, said goodbye to his aunt and they were out the door. “Why don’t you bring your wand with you, I’m not against it, of course, I’m just curious.” Draco blew out some air creating a cloud of smoke in the cold air. “I came directly from school, didn’t have time to pick it up on the way” He answered easily and Potter nodded. “Should I apparate you directly into your apartment or outside or?” Draco rolled his eyes at the question. “Just aparate to outside your apartment or something, I think we live in the same neighbourhood.” Potter nodded, they fell silent after that. They just walked alongside each other until they reached the apparition spot when Draco grabbed Potter arm and he apparated them outside his apartment building. “Thanks,” Draco said as he let go of Potter, and started to walk away. Behind him, Potter smiled a little smile before entering his own apartment.
“If someone talks bad about Draco or Lucius you’d be completely outraged, right?” From the corner of his eye, he sees Andromeda put her hands on her hips as she speaks. “I would, but I still do not see how that matters in this situation,” Narcissa says again.
However, Draco did not have the energy to care. He was up for one reason and one reason alone. To get this goddamn essay in before tonight. Technically it’s not due until Wednesday morning but since he was going to go to that party he knew he simply can’t wake up tomorrow morning to do it.
Neville arriving took him back to earth, they went inside, got a table, drink, all while chatting loudly. Harry would’ve skipped but this was the first time all five of them had gone out drinking in a long while.
Also how many damn times have I just lied in my bed going "I wanna write something but FUCKING WHAT?!"
Conveniently enough the bus came and they sat down at the far back, Draco burying his head in his scarf. “I got my father to buy the brooms for the team to make me shut up,” he muttered, Harry looked over at Draco and tried to hold in a laugh, “Don’t you dare laugh at me,” Draco threatened but Harry couldn’t hold it and Draco sank down where he sat. “At least I admit to stalking,” He muttered hoping Harry wouldn’t hear because he was laughing too loud. “Sorry,” Harry said, taking hold of Draco’s jacket, as he calmed down.
An hour later Narcissa thanked for herself and flooded back to her manor, Harry and Draco staying to say goodnight to Teddy.
“Oh and another thing. I’m hosting kind of a friend Christmas thing, muggle style and I’ve invited all your muggle friends and stuff, the 25th, is that okay. I spoke with your mother and she said you’d be celebrating with her and eh, the rest of your family the 24th anyway.”
“Okay so a question, do you have Draco’s Instagram?” Hermione took out her phone before looking expectantly at Harry. “No? Should I have?” Hermione rolled her eyes at him. “If you’re going to travel Europe with him, yes.” She opened her phone searching for something before handing him her phone. “It’s his profile, just Draco Malfoy in one word. Follow him, I dare ya. Goodbye” Hermione quickly took her phone out of his hands and walked out the door. “Bye” Harry barely had time to say before the door shut behind her.
“I don’t know, I kinda want to go to a restaurant in like… Diagon Alley, but I didn’t know if you were comfortable with that so I… let you decide?” Draco shrugged, “We can go to Diagon Alley, I haven’t been there in a while,”
“I feel like I’m forgetting something,” Draco said as they stepped out the door, “Do you have your phone with you? Keys? Card?” Nodding to all of them Harry couldn’t see what he possibly could’ve forgotten. “Maybe it wasn’t important?” Harry tried and Draco shrugged. Locking the door behind them, “I’ll probably remember it later, I’ll just run back and get it then,” Harry nodded and walked down the stairs slowly as Draco were on his phone, “what are you doing?” he asked, curious, “Messaging Pansy, she’s also coming,” Harry nodded, “You know, sending her the address and stuff…” When Draco put down his phone he walked quicker down the stairs, “don’t run,” Harry yelled after him, almost slipping to be able to keep up Draco’s speed, when he did stop to look behind him Draco grinned at him, “Idiot,” Harry huffed when Draco kept walking. “You too,” Draco yelled turning around and walking backwards.
“Mother, long time no see” Draco turned towards his mother who was looking at him curiously. “What?” he said as he noticed Potter was looking at him, a little-amused smile on his face. “Your hair is curly, dear,” his mother told him.
“Well, before you dated Ginny and then you dated-” Harry burped Seamus name and pointed to him, “who’d that work?” the conversation had gotten serious now, Harry could tell, Seamus had climbed of off Dean’s lap. “Well I’m bisexual, thought that was obvious,” Dean said, he sounded nervous, “I don’t know how it works, I kind of just like the person, it doesn’t matter if they’re a girl or a guy y’know,” Dean shrugged, besides him, Seamus looked uncomfortable, “listen if you have a problem-” Dean started,
“All the potential talent,” George said dramatically, coming back from the kitchen, three baby plates, glasses and cutlery walking over to the kids' table neatly placed in between the kitchen and the living room.
Harry apparated them to Draco’s apartment, they stood there for about 3 seconds before Draco, gagging doubled over, letting go of Harry’s hand, “oh my god, are you-” Harry didn’t have time to finish his question before Draco puked all over his white rug. “Holy shit,” Harry signed softly before slowly patting Draco’s back in comfort, “I’m sorry,” Draco whispered and Harry hugged his from behind to the best of his ability since Draco was still hunched over. “It’s fine, let’s get you to bed,” Harry took out his wand, vanished the vomit and led Draco the bathroom, “you can fix yourself up, right?” Harry asks and Draco nodes, “Do you need anything?” Draco shrugged at him, “makeup wipes maybe but I think they’re in here,” Draco rises to stand from the toilet but almost falls down again if Harry hadn’t had quick reflexes. “Okay, so I’m gonna do that I think,” Harry concludes, sitting Draco down again “which cabinet?” Harry pointed towards the sink, “the right drawer,” Draco sighs. Harry find the makeup wipes and sits down on the bathtub beside the toilet, “alright, gimme your face,” Harry says and Draco leans closer, it takes Harry longer than it probably should’ve to clean Draco’s entire face which Draco later will blame on Harry being too goddamn gentle, but it’s Harry’s nature and he can’t help it.
“Listen I already knew you were a horrible teenager but damn okay, I’m not mad, just disappointed, thanks though, I think I’m going to go home and process all this. Umm, you guys have a good time, I guess?” Sabrina said, it is quite obvious that she was hiding shock and sadness, she quickly assembled her stuff and was out the door before you could count to ten.
“Oh Harry, how did tea with the Malfoy’s, Teddy and Andromeda go?” Hermione asks two hours later as she and Ron put on their coats on their way out. “It went smoothly. I and Malfoy were both intoxicated by the end of it.” Harry claps his hands together before awkwardly putting them in his pockets. “Did something happen?” Ron asks above Hermione’s careful eye, “Not really, I guess we randomly planned to travel around Europe, together, this summer…” Harry says carefully shifting his weight from his toes to his heels
“I literally just had my usual mental breakdowns, stop worrying so much, I’m fine,” Draco said into his cup of no-so-hot-anymore chocolate. “I don’t believe you but alright, I won’t mention it.” She stared right at the tv in front of them, without really looking at it. Draco didn’t mind her being here, she’s one of his best friends, what could he do.
“What are the muggles not entertaining enough?” Harry asks as he gives the latte to Malfoy. He takes if and warms his hands on the cup. “Oh no, they are, it’s just a little overwhelming sometimes.. you know how it can be” Malfoy nervously laughed. “Yeah, I get that. Here to study? Again? You keeping up good?” Harry asked teasingly and got a tsk sound back.
“So Potter, are what the rumours are saying true?” Narcissa addressed him again, attempting to make conversation, “Harry,” He corrected her kindly before continuing, “What are the rumours saying? I’m not really following them,”
“Her?” Molly said and raised an eyebrow. “Yes,” Ginny responded, looking very done with the discussion at hand. “Congratulations,” Harry said to her from across the table and she gave him a little smile, “Now, now, Molly, let’s settle down and eat, yeah?” Arthur calmed his wife and slowly but surely the small talk to up once again.
“Hi,” He said to everyone before turning to Draco and the blue-haired guy, “Are you okay?” he asked Draco, Draco waved him off, “Why does everyone keep asking me that?
