Draco had no idea what to do once he sat on the bed, the thoughts in his head were rushing around a million miles per hour; making him slightly dizzy. He tried his best to ignore them as he sat crosslegged and against the headboard, his entire body shaking like a leaf during a storm.
They ran back to the classroom, stopping as they came to the door. Harry peaked through the window before slamming himself back against the wall.
“He a good kisser, ay Ron?” Fred joked, throwing a bunched up piece of paper at him to catch his attention.
“I-I’m not pretty.” He really had nothing else to say, he could not get anything other than a retort out of his mouth. He also knew that he sounded like a child with the way he was attempting to argue back in order to stop getting hard, this made Potter chuckle once again.
“It’s getting late and I’ve got some stuff to do.” His eyes an acid green as they burned straight through him, but Draco picked up on how they shimmered a ruby colour which could barely be seen from the stygian presence that overpowered his irises.
sorry for the shorter chapter, i didn't want to post to big of a chunk but i will be updating this again soon as i've already got a big portion already written (before i had my motivation stolen lmao) but i'll hopefully be getting some more written soon. thank you for reading :)
“We didn’t have a full class then, Malfoy.” He made sure to glance at Harry. Either he was the best matchmaker in the world or it was his goal to embarrass him until he died. Draco groaned in response, the potion not being the main source of smell anymore. Now, he could smell it directly on Harry. Fuck, it was intoxicating.
Draco’s breath hitched at the vulgar language that slipped so easily from Potter’s mouth, he made sure to ignore the sinful thoughts that were starting to dissolve into his head.
Draco's left to prepare for his meeting with Harry later on, surely it'll go along smoothly until then.
Draco let no other words spill from his blubbering mouth, he wouldn’t allow himself to talk himself into not cumming. His body ached for it after having not cum earlier in the day, he did not want to have to wait any longer.
“I remember all throughout the day, Harry was just sweating constantly. Looked like a bloody waterfall, kinda like how he does now. I literally had to bring his work up to the front when he was finished so people didn’t see the huge boner showing through his jeans.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The words made Draco want to sob as he felt his hair get yanked backwards, pulling him off for a moment. His first instinct was to cough after having something so large not there anymore, slurping obscenely in a way that deepened the colour on his cheeks but only made Harry more turned on.
Harry nodded at Draco’s words, keeping his eyes locked onto the blonde - enjoying how he knew the other would probably begin to feel unnerved.
He didn’t know how long he’d been there, towering over his cowering frame as his eyes were locked on the ground. Feeling the combat boots at either side of his curvy hips start to put against them, squashing them against his flesh in some sort of warning. That still didn’t make him look up, he didn’t fucking want too but some part of him did.
He didn’t really want to do this for Draco’s first time with him, in his fantasies it was more than fine but since the other hadn’t given him head before he didn’t want to push him too far. But of course, Malfoy had to go and exceed expectations in a way Potter thrived off.
And Draco, well, all he could do was gulp. Potter had just done wandless magic. Wandless magic. It turned him on way more than it should’ve, it was shameful how much it turned him on. He realised that watching Potter’s show of power was incredibly arousing to him, dear merlin.
Draco whimpered, his hips twitching into Potter’s pleasuring hands. He hadn’t even realised that he’d been leaking precum until now, his cheeks scolding as they emitted a crimson glow.
“You were imagining, weren’t you.” Hermione’s tone told Harry that she already knew full well where he’d been inside his head, they had already experienced this after all.
Those thoughts were definitely new too, he never once cared about if anyone would be pleased with him - bar his father. But even now, he stopped caring a long while ago. Ever since Lucius was locked up in Azkaban, he had left his craving to please people who didn’t deserve it in the past.
“We-We have experience in this, it’ll be okay.” All three of them made eye contact, utterly flabbergasted that this was happening again.
“We didn’t know that it was going to last 24 hours until I finally found the description of the potion in a book, we did not expect that. We thought we could deal with horny Harry for a couple hours but a whole night and day, amateur mistake.”
Draco still pondered on whether or not to even try speak, he wasn’t sure that his voice would come out at all.
Obviously, he would still probably get irrevocably embarrassed in the next 5 minutes but it wouldn’t be the bad kind. It would be the kind that he secretly got off on, well not so secretly since Harry quite clearly knew.
Potter’s voice, that sounded a lot deeper than normal, broke him out of his head. Sending a tingle of warmth throughout his lower stomach. God, what was wrong with him. He felt the sensation he usually got before getting fully turned on rush throughout his body. He didn’t know whether to despise that it was just a voice getting him this worked up or just to focus on the fact that it was Potter’s voice!
“I agree. It only started because I was a stubborn little child who lashed out when I didn’t get what I wanted.” Draco felt guilt run through his veins, the regret showing on his face.
“Please don’t.”
“The effects of the lust potion have almost ran out, however, what’s remaining is still putting up a good fight - though now it’s controllable.”
He was shocked by the way he enjoyed feeling the lace on his skin, he never thought he’d say it out loud though. Of course, Pansy saw the look on his face and had asked questions. Draco could not lie to her, she was his best friend and could tell instantly.
The tone in his voice made his words highly unbelievable but he was using everything inside of himself to cling on to the little remaining pieces of his control. It was a losing battle, he let his eyes slip shut as he took a deep breath. He ignored his friends’ disbelieving expressions and focused, however, he was soon gritting his teeth.
“Now that we agree on that, we should stop beating around the bush.” Harry could tell Draco was about to speak so interrupted, looking down to the ground.
He ruffled his hair a little before deciding that it was good enough, he did look good. Walking over to his dresser, he sprayed on the minimalist amount of cologne. Draco didn’t want the other to think he was trying too hard but his brain was also beginning to stop working as he realised that it was now 9:55pm, he needed to go.
Draco had his eyes squeezed tight before he remembered what he’d been told, he opened them to see a dark gaze penetrating his own. He once again, couldn’t help but whimper as Harry pushed even more of his cock into his mouth. All he could do was let his tongue slide against the underside of Potter’s hard on, the sheer size and girth allowing him no other movement - he could barely hollow his cheeks but tried his very best.
“Well it isn’t hard to miss, you can’t hide that at all.” Ron tried to say it cooly but snorted at the way it sounded as it came out, cracking up the others slightly.
“Could you give everybody a reminder?” Ginny giggled at how Harry rolled his eyes, her brother’s shared her grin.
Draco’s cheeks blushed at the pet name and he cursed himself for finally showing how the other was making him feel, the look he was receiving was dizzying.
thank you for reading! i hope you enjoyed and if so the upcoming chapters will be posted soon :)

“Excuse me.” Harry uttered out the words to the girl he recognised as Pansy, usually she was full of things to say but this time - she said nothing. All she did was slide to the right and out of his way, not throwing one bit of spite his way. Harry didn’t want to admit how much he got off on it, being in control in a safe way always made him feel high.
“Well, you made it a lust potion completely by accident. Those weren’t even the ingredients for the potion, all that was needed was one spoonful - right?” Pansy tried to make sense of it as she wracked her brain, audibly stating the facts in hopes that she would somehow understand it better.
“You kinda were.” For a moment they got lost in each other’s eyes, never having been this close unless they were fighting. As cliche as it is, it felt like they were looking into each others souls.
“I’ll see you outside the Gryffindor dorms in 2 hours then, I can’t wait to get you alone, Draco.”
“We’re weirdly close.” Ron chuckled as he shook his head, resting his head on his hand.
“Don’t you lie to me, a warning.”
“Please t-touch me, do anything. Hurry up and f-fuck me, please.”
A stinging sensation across his right cheek was what brought him out of it, his head snapping to the left from the pure force.
“Yep, Harry thinks he’s been slipped one.” Ron chewed on his nail as he spoke, stopping swiftly from the look he received from Hermione - practically hearing her voice telling him to stop the habit.
Draco wanted to sob at not only the words, but as the fingers on his bare arse got infinitely tighter. He honestly didn’t think his hold could get any tighter.
“And what did you wear underneath?”
Fucking their friend with his eyes, the damn expressions on his face and not to mention that undeniable bulge that pushed obscenely against his pants. It was as if they had been watching a show of aggressive flirting and teasing, they had to admit that it was kinda hot.
Draco couldn’t help the sinful thoughts that were swarming inside his head, whirling around like a tornado of horny had struck - this was not the time for shitty similes.
“F-Finger me, hard. P-Please, Harry.” His voice was unstable, as he knew it would’ve been, coming out in a squeak rather than actual words. It was enough for the Gryffindor though.
Potter tightened his grip on the bare skin of Draco’s cheeks, revelling when he felt the other’s knees buckle again.
He absolutely revelled in the way Draco’s head was bowed to him, he knew that it wasn’t intentional. The other was just too scared to look up and meet his own pitch black gaze, full of lust. He needed to see those beautiful, pale blueish, grey eyes. Encased in fear and his own need and want, clear by the boner in his pants.
“What the hell?” Pansy queried, she related to the pure confusion she saw on Draco’s face. All of them were grossly invested in what Hermione was about to say. The other’s were sat in silence, straining their ears so hard to listen that they were probably going to pop a blood vessel.
Harry was supposed to be the one with the lust potion, not Draco! The blonde could feel his thighs tingle at Potter’s dirty words, and they weren’t even directed at him. The sultry tone had made Draco’s heart start pounding in his chest, he was still in slight shock that Harry was the one causing the spill of arousal as it slowly made its way throughout his whole body.
“Walking with a limp? Fuck that, he’ll be in a wheelchair!”
Harry spoke in a slight condescending tone, no actual cruelty in his words; just joking around with his best friend. Ron mumbled an apology before snorting discreetly, well, what he thought was discreet anyway. He didn’t miss the way the corner of Harry’s mouth twitched either.
“Harry! Don’t joke about him!” Hermione scolded but was holding off from laughing, what her friends didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them.
“I also know that none of you would want to be known as “snitches” but if anybody ever shit talks you for something you can’t change, tell a te- never mind. Tell Pansy.” That was the first time they’ve seen the professor smile properly in a long while, it was strange to see. They knew he had a heart but his behaviour in their previous years had made them try think of him as a monster. Now they were older, everything was a lot less cloudy. They also were all kinda shocked that he had just swore in front of him.
“Hey, I wasn’t any better. I could’ve put a stop to it.” Harry placed a comforting hand on the other’s shoulder, he smiled.
“4 minutes? It felt like bloody hours. Not like it was a bad thing though and I’m definitely not complaining.” A smirk that he did not consent to, played on his lips in a teasing manner. He gained eye contact with his friends before swiftly breaking it and rubbing his temples, this fucking potion.
He felt eyes on him in an instant and he rolled his eyes dramatically.
“What if they’ve heard everything…”
Potter’s eyes dropped, so easily, to his mouth. Where his bottom lip was still caught between his teeth as he chewed on it from habit, his tongue swiping along every so often as a way to distract himself.
After weighing his options and how much time he had left, he was just gonna go with no underwear. He grabbed the jeans and pulled them up his slender legs, immensely struggling once it got to his upper thighs.
Immediately after Potter had left, Draco had desperately tried to breathe properly again. Only just noticing how uneven and shaky his breathing was, his lungs ached for him to take a proper inhale. His heart still hammered away in his chest as he urged for it to calm down, he definitely did not want to have a heart attack before he got the golden opportunity to go and meet with Harry.
“I promise, I wouldn’t lie to you about that. That bubble body wash you use that somehow smells like bubbles, I can explain all sorts of spells but I cannot even start on that. How bubbles have a smell.” Hermione giggled, going on a small tangent.
He chuckled, it was in now way one of laughter though. It was guttural and harsh, it sent a bone-chilling, icy chill, all the way down Draco’s spine - a hand made of bitter ice dragging its fingertip down the entirety of his back.
“Yeah, I know. And he only thinks about kissing one.” Ron sent a wink to his best friend, laughing more at the way Harry groaned at his crush being mentioned again.
Harry let out a noise that resembled both a scoff and a chuckle, shaking his head as he burnt the other with his gaze.
Draco prayed that his eyes didn’t show the lust that he was engulfed by, he did not need his friends seeing that. As their gazes collided, he felt his heart stutter violently in his chest. Almost as if it had stopped for a moment before viciously remembering its job and started again, the eyes of his friends were full of curiosity.
Harry felt sweat start to collect at his nape, using all his self-restraint not to fuck Draco’s mouth until his head bashed against the wall. He wanted to do this gradually, which was hard to do with the way the other was constantly whining around him - sending vibrations of pleasure shooting up into Harry’s body.
“Fucking hell.” Pansy was the first to speak up, breaking Draco out of his head at the tone of pure bewilderment coming from her. He heard Blaise mutter the same words as he took a brave look up, wrenching his gaze from where it comfortably rested on the ground.
“You wanna know about the one where I imagined fucking a guy over the desk and leaving the door unlocked so that anybody could walk in and see what a slut he was for me?”
“God and that blush. Makes you seem so innocent when really, I know different. I’m gonna really enjoy dirtying you up, corrupting you.”
Harry turned to face Draco’s still cowering figure, he knew the other could feel the eyes on him as his gaze slowly lifted until they collided. His bottom lip was shaking again but was swiftly caught between his teeth, a way to try control it.
It really felt as if he was talking, he knew for a fact he wasn’t. The risk that he was actually speaking out loud apparently wasn’t a big enough problem for him to care about, he just loved the visuals he was seeing and let himself get lost in them.
Draco and his friends stopped dead in their tracks, all looking shaky as they shared a glance that was full of fear. Oh no.
“Draco, look at me now.”
He let out a defeated sigh, moving over his cauldron to inhale. His senses were filled instantly, for a second he considered lying but knew that somehow Snape would probably figure it out.
Harry allowed himself to let go as he nipped at the milky skin, gradually increasing in harshness. He bit down, earning another moan that went straight to his crotch - that was gonna leave a mark.
His “enemy” had just helped him out that, when he didn’t need to do a thing at all. He was so fucking grateful and thankful to Harry for helping him, from the bottom of his heart.
Pushing the embarrassment that was surely to follow to the side, Draco nodded his head - more desperately than he would ever admit. When he heard the man towering over him tut, he knew he was done for.
He gradually opened his eyes to be met with Harry’s own, now looking less concerned than they were before.
Snape was gonna have their necks, they were late again. For the third time this week! Ron and Harry gave each other worried looks as they halted their run as they approached the door.
“Right. I thought you were good at potions, how did you manage to turn a love potion into one of lust.”
He also knew that his words were a lie, he knew for a fact that it had already began to kick in. Maybe he just said that to make his friends be less suspicious that he was about to start jacking off under the table or something, that did sound kinda interesti-fuck.
Hermione’s words faded into nothing as Harry felt the potion hit hard again, feeling momentarily lightheaded as the feeling of pleasure rushed its way back into his body. He still had a boner, it had gone down slightly in the midst of talking to his friends. Still, he was half hard - which wasn’t an ideal situation.
“You want me to fuck your throat?”
“Did you not pick up on him saying he wanted to fuck ‘a guy’ over the desk earlier as well, pay attention, C.” Pansy giggled playfully, nudging his shoulder softly to make sure he heard. He had in fact heard and chuckled back.
Ron gave her an exasperated look, he had only just started studying for the test tomorrow! Let alone the test for next week.
“Obviously. It’s better that way.” It was Ginny’s turn to roll her eyes as she dropped her fist on the table, Ron decided that she didn’t need to know about the cooling charm. Another thing that he could wind up his sister about, oh how he loved annoying the girl.
Draco's already worn out - in the best way, of course - but little does he know that Harry hasn't even begun with him yet.
“Speak, now, princess.”
All he knew was that the same Harry Potter was causing his heart to hammer in his chest so hard that he could feel it in his ears and turning him on like nobody ever had before. And he fucking hated how he enjoyed it. Loved it, even.
Then he heard Potter clear his throat, that wasn’t unintentional. He knew that for a fact, his boots starting to squash his skin a little harder - pinching his skin a little. The slight pricks of pain it caused just rushing straight to his prick, he cringed at that. Guess this really was the day of self discovery.
The Slytherin’s were in shock, they couldn’t quite believe what they had just heard. The vulgar and filthy words that had poured from Harry’s mouth so easily like honey mixed in with liquid gold. To Draco, the words sounded like they fit perfectly coming from the other boy’s mouth - like they belonged there.
Draco tried to lean back before he realised that he couldn’t move any further, he was backed up against the door. He was trapped, his body tingled in anticipation.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione’s eyes locked again. Unless they were imagining it, they were sure that Harry smelt like that.
He also felt his mother’s hand rubbing his back up and down softly, even though she didn’t know how to handle the situation - he appreciated her greatly for still helping.
Potter yanked Draco’s hair again, pulling him completely off his cock. The boy sputtered and his hands fell from where they gripped Harry thighs, to the floor. His jaw and mouth, somehow, hurt even more now. His whole head was in pain at this point but all it did was mingle delicious with the ever-growing pleasure in his gut.
“Harry, oh fuck, is it..?” Ron’s voice shook with nerves as he looked up at his friend, pure and crippling anxiety clouding his senses.
Despite the vulgar situation, Draco found himself blushing more. Not from the gorgeous cock being stroked in front of his face, or from Potter’s earlier words - they would add to it later no doubt - but from the compliment. It may have been a strange thing to get all sentimental about but after dealing with such harsh confidence issues, it made him feel a lot better.
Draco had barely heard it from how soft the other had said it, a drastic contrast to how his voice had sounded before. Potter had his wand pointed towards the bed side table, where an empty glass stood. The blonde hadn’t even noticed its presence but watched as it was filled with icy water, it looked tempting.
“This is so fucking frustrating!” His voice came out louder than he expected it too, his heart hammering harshly against his chest.
He had heard that it was a gift from his godfather, Sirius - he had good style so it didn’t surprise him. Potter did too, his clothes were mostly simple but he had a thing of making anything look good. Harry was currently wearing a plain black t-shirt, the same coloured jeans and he still looked like a damn god. No matter whether he was dressed down, dressed up or other - Draco would still drool over him.
“Now.” His voice sounded almost animalistic, a deep growl vibrating throughout his chest, through the table and eventually - through Draco’s own body.
Potter then yanked his hair harshly as he thrusted brutally into the other’s throat, he growled when Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head as a loud but muffled moan vibrated around him. Tears now pouring down that pretty face, it made Harry hot all over.
He briefly imagined, not just how it would stretch his lips to the absolute limit, but probably choke him to his death. He felt his cock ache in his pants, his mouth now full of saliva. Pure from the fact that he’d been thinking about Potter’s cock in his mouth, the more he thought about it the more he craved it.
It felt like he had been standing there for hours, not daring to meet eyes with Malfoy. Harry could only squeak out the word “fuck” before bolting for the door, he would’ve feared his teacher’s reaction to him swearing if he hadn’t just exposed a crush he didn’t even know he had!
From the angle that he was in, he had the perfect view of the prominent and intimidatingly large bulge that resided in Potter’s jeans.
The way Malfoy was reacting to his dark gaze had him questioning whether it was really all that shocking to think that he wanted him back. Regardless, he loved teasing him.
The table behind them, unbeknownst to the Gryffindor’s, strained their ears as they tried to listen intently.
“It’s okay, by the way. Liking guys, I do too. Nobody in here cares either and Pansy threatened that if any of them were to say something, she’d fuck them up - to put it simply.” Harry could barely believe it, Pansy would stick up for him?
“Yeah, I’d still love to fuck his brains out.” A dark smirk played on his lips as he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. He once again scanned the room, his eyes growing darker when he saw the source of his sexual frustration.
“This is gonna be so fun to listen too.” Draco and his friends were already thoroughly amused, eager to hear more.
“You just had a panic attack, I’m gonna take a guess that it’s your first proper one.”
All he knew, was that he was growing hornier for the man in front of him every single second. He needed to at least try and persuade Potter that he still had a little fight left in him, that he hadn’t completely melted into a puddle of arousal on the floor - even if Draco didn’t believe it either.
Against his consent, Harry’s hips thrusted forward - shoving his cock deep into Malfoy’s throat. He was about to pull back to apologise when he felt the vibrations of a long, drawn out moan come from the other.
From not having cum all day, Draco’s body and mind were extremely sensitive. Harry knew that and took joy in playing with the fact.
As his gaze differed, he let out a heavy breath. Now looking at those curvy hips of his that he wanted to grip tightly between his fingers, leaving bruises of his own fingertips. The boy was driving him crazy.
After some quietness as Hermione tried to finish off her studying quickly, and more prying from the twins who were extremely curious about who Harry had a crush on. Hermione, Ron and Ginny only smirked at them which aided in their annoyance.
Draco heard himself whine again, even though he had attempted to do it quietly, he knew for a fact that Harry would have heard it. He couldn’t see his reaction though, after his absolute failure of speaking - his gaze had shot down to focus on the floor.
“Hey Draco it’s OK if you don’t love me. You don’t have to love me. OK just take some deep breaths and calm down a little.”
thanks for reading.
After a few more seconds of staring at each other, Harry smirking, Draco sneering indignantly, Harry broke the silence by saying “You take really long showers,” then as an afterthought, “unless you weren't exactly showering the whole time, and I see you've taken care of your little problem, though to be fair it’s not really that little.” he raised his eyebrows twice before saying. “If you get what I mean” Draco did get what he meant but that didn't mean he liked it, OK he kind of liked it but that didn't mean that Potter was allowed to say it.
The two boys didn’t last much longer, Draco came first, Harry expertly bringing him off. Harry finished inside Draco coming undone when Draco clenched around him and came over both of their stomachs and Harry’s hand. Harry licked the cum that had gotten on his hand when Draco had finished, making Draco’s sensitive cock stir. Harry then cleaned them with a few quick charms and rolled onto his back, exhausted. Draco, who was also exhausted at this point, curled into Harry’s side. Draco looked up at Harry, who smiled back at him, and said, “I love you.”
“Or maybe his jawline?” Draco carried on. “It’s very sharp, and he needs to shave a little more often. I wouldn’t want to get a rash from his scruff, you know?”
Harry grinned to himself and sent Draco a sultry wink before he finally turned and walked out of sight. Once he was alone, his hand covered his mouth and he laughed out in shock at his own recent brazenness.
"I get it," she said. "Really, I do. It's part of the reason I wanted to come and find you, and make sure you were okay, you know?"
Hermione bit her lip and took his hand. He squeezed her fingers in his and she let out a breath.
Hermione was still a little salty about that. Whoever the
As Harry was about to turn away again, another Slytherin – Harper, one of the substitute Seekers in case Draco was injured – piped up. "Do you guys always practice in your game day robes?" he asked. Harry looked around at what all of the Slytherins were wearing, noticing that they were mostly in casual clothes that they wouldn't care if they were ruined during practice.
“Seriously Cresswell? That’s the third bloody time this week!” she screeched. “If you can’t learn to control your incantations then I’m going to stick your stupid wand somewhere it doesn’t belong!”
” he asked. Harry’s eyes widened in shock and he blushed slightly. Now his body felt hot for a whole different reason. He looked over at Draco from the corner of his eyes to see Draco looking half nonchalant and half shocked that the words slipped from his lips.
Hermione sent Harry a soft smile. "I thought your heart was set on him being the bad guy?"
"Uhhh, no, dude. You guys are booked for tomorrow. We've got the pitch today," Urquhart said. However, his voice wavered slightly and he seemed a little unsure of himself. As much was to be expected, I mean – people didn't just show up in competition robes for no reason.
She made sure to announce her arrival so as not to startle him.
“I was wondering how that happened to him,” Harry laughed. “He said he tripped and fell down the stairs.”
Harry and Hermione were crowded around a small cauldron in the Room of Requirement. They were in here most nights working on the potion to make sure it turned out just right. Right now, though, they both were enjoying the benefits of a free period.
Harry smirked up at the taller boy. His white blond hair was in his eyes, which were sending a harsh glare Harry's way. Despite the boy's words, his cheeks were still flushed and his eyes were sparking with something that Harry just couldn't put his finger on.
was, well, Hermione was annoyed that she didn’t have the advantage that Harry did.
squirm for once after all the grilling he’d given her about Ron.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Pansy pouted at Draco for his lack of response. She lifted a hand and put it on his forearm to get his attention. Harry felt hot all over when watching the action – angered for a reason not clear to him.
, he thought.
"Oh, wow... That's uhh... That's actually not a bad idea..." Urquhart said as he tapped his chin thoughtfully, seriously considering the idea. Harry internally gave himself a facial high-five.
As Harry made his way onto the Quidditch pitch, the Slytherin team looked up from their huddle to give him odd and confused looks. Harry spotted Draco on the edge of the group, blushing as he took in Harry's uniform.
said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
followers, Draco had never expressed a desire to join them.
Hermione rolled her eyes at her friend.
Harry grabbed his Firebolt from the Gryffindor broom cupboard and made his way to the Quidditch pitch. He adjusted his game robes as he walked. Draco may have been right about his pants being a size too small because they were at that moment giving him an almighty wedgie.
“You too.” Harry sent her a mock salute as he darted off down the hall. Hermione grinned to herself and then kicked her butt into gear, heading off towards her class.
“How long is it going to take, do you think?” he asked as they walked towards Defence Against The Dark Arts. God forbid they be late or Snape would only have another reason to take house points from Gryffindor.
His voice was high and incredulous and Hermione just rolled her eyes.
He couldn't believe what he'd just done. And he had no idea what it meant for him and Draco now, but he was more than excited to find out...
One lunar phase (about 28 days)
"Okay, well I'll, uhhh... I'll just be going then. Good luck with your practice, guys. Sorry again that I interrupted..." he trailed off. He gave them a wave and picked up his Firebolt.
? Second of all,
"I'm thinking... I wanna do it again," Harry smirked up at the other boy, who's eyes widened in shock before Harry leaned up on his tiptoes and pressed his lips against Draco's gently. Harry cupped at the other boy's jaw as he kissed him sweetly.
“And we are not stealing from Snape. He could do a lot worse to us than docking house points,” she added on in case he hadn’t deciphered her stern look.
It wasn't a complete lie on Harry's part. Wood had always liked doing extensive drills when he'd been at Hogwarts, but under Harry's captainship, they hadn't done nearly as many.
Hermione was sitting at a table in the Great Hall, eating her breakfast porridge quietly as she tried to ignore Ron and Lavender snogging right next to her. It was six in the morning for heaven's sake! Hermione was concerned that Lavender might one day end up sucking Ron's entire face off.
Potter repeated this many more times, successfully covering Draco’s neck in nasty/cruel looking bruises. All the while, the Slytherin had been moaning - what he had thought to be - quietly. The blonde not only welcomed, but craved the pain.
Putting his mind to work, he put the last of his focus on ignoring his half hard arousal and finishing off his potions evaluation.
“And why is that, Draco?”
The blonde couldn’t hold off any longer as he shuffled even closer on his knees, his hot breath hitting against the monster of a cock in front of him. He grabbed the base tightly as he stuck his tongue out, licking around the tip. His heart hammered so hard against his chest that he was sure Harry could feel it too, he needed to get a hold on his breathing before he passed out.
He didn’t even get to finish his pathetic excuse of a reply as Potter interrupted sharply, the words coming from his mouth sending his mind into a swarm of lust.
Harry tried to hold in his annoyance, knowing that Snape would very gladly take more points if he felt like it. The boys shared a look as Ron rushed to his seat, luckily near the front so they wouldn’t have to do the walk of shame to the back.
Draco managed to snap himself out of his thoughts as he looked up at the clock, 9:45pm. How had it been 15 minutes already?!
Potter’s chuckle made the air around him thin, his lungs couldn’t take in enough air - his whole body erupted in goosebumps. Draco felt freezing, whilst at the same time overwhelmingly heated. He struggled to understand how one person could affect him so much, he didn’t even want to try to think about it.
It started with his face, he guessed that Potter had already taken notice of the grey colour his eyes were from the intense eye contact that they had shared before.
Potter’s hand moved to push against his cock, he didn’t let any pleasure show on his face though. Just that same teasing expression, he knew what he was doing.
“It’s a little disturbing at how much my brothers are entertained by this.”
“Potter.”
All it did, however, was distract the boy he now realised how kinda had a crush on. Fuck.
Then his length, fuck. He couldn’t tell just from looking through his jeans but he had to have been at least, oh god. His brain had stopped working, turning to must and sliding out of his ears. He had seen Potter naked before, yes, but had always been too shy to look down. Harry Potter was hung like a fucking horse, his body refused to stop shaking.
Harry’s eyes were a captivating mixture of a metallic blood red and the darkest pitch black he’d ever seen, he’d never seen eyes quite like them. He’d never seen Potter’s eyes like this, he couldn’t find a piece of himself that wanted to look away. A prickling warmth that spread through his entire, shaky body - ending in his groin. He so badly wanted to let the moan that was forcibly stuck in his throat out but he couldn’t bare to humiliate himself further.
“What do you want me to do, Draco?” He drawled out the words, staring at him and catching his gaze - he knew his own eyes were dark and swarmed by lust.
“So Goyle added four instead of one. For a love potion, you only need one. But for a lust potion, you need six drops. The lust ingredient has clearly taken over the entire potion, it isn’t a love potion now. Definitely just lust. It shouldn’t last 24 hours, I’m unsure of the correct time though.”
“When can I go check on Harry, sir?” Snape thought for a moment, a thought fleeting across his head as he almost chuckled.
“He always drilled in me to be perfect, the best at everything. My mother helped a lot, butting in when he went too far. But many times, she got scared and didn’t.”
“Nox.” Quickly shutting the door after extinguishing Harry’s wand, they weren’t too far from the classroom. Hopefully, Snape was still in his decent mood. She didn’t miss Harry’s worried gaze around them, as if the whole class was gonna jump out and poke fun.
This wasn’t what was meant to happen. After friends of Draco’s; Pansy, Goyle, Crabbe and Blaise had heard Ron and Hermione discussing Potter’s crush, it had sent their minds into overdrive.
“O-Okay.” Even to Draco’s own ears, his words sounded weak. He sounded so submissive already, Potter hadn’t even been towering over him for that long and he was already moulding to his will, his own cock was begging for touch - his ass screaming for something inside of it.
Harry could instantly see the questioning expression on Malfoy’s pretty features, he decided to explain now just so he could get it out of the way.
After finally making it up the staircase, he had tried to lounge around and lean against the wall. The Gryffindor’s painting of the fat lady was seemingly asleep, he hoped so anyway. He knew that the paintings here were a whole hell of a lot smarter than they let on, it wouldn’t surprise him if the fat lady was just pretending to be asleep.
Draco knew what that gaze meant, he still had not answered him. Potter was just circling his fingers around his rim, so damn teasingly. He wasn’t gonna do a thing until he answered, but Draco didn’t know if his voice would allow it.
“N-No, I-I jus-“
Then Harry’s fingers moved down from his cheeks, finding their way to the holes in the jeans - just where his thighs met the curve of his arse.
“B-Because it’s not m-mine to touch.” The words could barely leave his mouth.
No matter how embarrassing it was to show the other how much he wanted him, needed him, craved him - he knew that he fucking loved it.
“It’s just because he’s horny, I think.” Fred contributed as he chuckled along with his brother.
All Draco could do was let out a choked sound that he couldn’t quite decipher, it was embarrassing nonetheless. Potter’s words came out in a pernicious manner, it shook him to his core. The words were so cruel sounding yet they turned Draco on in ways he couldn’t believe, he never thought he’d get turned on from the harshness.
“Thank fuck that he’s finally made a move.” Ron cackled as Ginny, Hermione, Neville and the twins all nodded in agreement - all of them thinking the same thing.
Draco tries to decide what to wear, time flies and he finally meets up with Harry.
“I already read mine out though, sir.” Snape held back a grin.
“I just need a moment, fuck. I have the worst luck ever. First Voldemort and now this!”
Draco didn’t say anything back straight away, he didn’t trust his voice after the words that had come out of the Gryffindor’s mouth. It took him a couple minutes to finally speak.
Harry knew how much power surrounded him, both him and his magic wanted to ruin the boy beneath him. And he would, in due time. He also knew that Draco would fucking love it.
“Touché.” The two of them replied, finally shutting up and turning their full and undivided attention back to Hermione. Remembering what story they were about to hear.
“You better remember to tell us after you-“
thank you so much for reading! any feedback is welcome, i'm interested in what anybody has to say or any way to improve my creative writing :3 i hope you have a good day! :)
His thoughts were then cut off as Harry smirked viciously at him, Draco had an idea that the words about to come from the other’s mouth were going to make him tremble.
The demanding tone had Draco squeezing his thighs together, attempting to stop the hard on in his jeans from hardening anymore. Of course, Harry felt it too. Feeling from where his hands still lay, gripping his arse. Draco’s cheeks heated up in an instant.
“May I?” His voice matched his caring eyes, he had stepped forward to hold onto the blonde’s shoulders. Draco immediately gripped Harry’s forearms, grounding himself without even knowing it.
His eyes then wandered to his friends, who also had wide eyes. Some of amazement and some of shock, just like Draco’s friends.
Draco lost focus on his inner monologue as Harry had moved his left hand to rest on the top of his jeans, it didn’t surprise him when a toothy grin appeared on the other’s face. He was just lucky that Draco enjoyed being teased with.
Draco downed at least half of it, the freezing liquid refreshing against his incredibly sore throat. He knew that his voice would still be fucked, water couldn’t fix that, but at least now he was hydrated and eased the slight pain - he still liked the pain as it was a constant reminder of what he’d just had in his mouth.
Harry gripped the flesh of his thighs once more, with such force that it made the other’s eyelids flutter. He knew the boy got off on pain, which made playing with him all that more fun.
Harry held his arm out, to which Draco looked confusedly between the other’s eyes and his outstretched arm. Potter raised a dark eyebrow at him, almost in a challenging way.
“I like you too. I’ve liked you for a long time, it’s weird to know you like me too. For a while, I know this is no excuse, I was terrified of my father.”
The taunting yet arousing names were turning the Slytherin into an even bigger mess, he had no idea how much things were about to escalate.
Hermione’s words were soft and comforting, very different from all that Harry was feeling. But he appreciated it nonetheless, he shot back a soft smile. That was until Ron decided to pipe up.
“Would you prefer for me to start jacking off right here? Because I will.” He revelled at his friends’ faces. Most in particular though was Draco’s, as he allowed his eyes to observe the boy once more.
That made him whip his head up, so fast that he wouldn’t be surprised if he gave himself whiplash. The dark tone that underlined the Gryffindor’s words had Draco’s entire body tensing up, he had no control of it.
“I did not just fucking say that!” The words were muffled under his hand but still audible, Hermione looked sympathetic but with an underlying gleam of amusement flashing in her eyes.
“Anyway, I wanted to prove that they worked. I was also curious of how they’d affect a person in real life rather than just reading about the effects on a piece of paper. After some secret ingredient searching we finally made the potions. Ron had the love potion and Harry, reluctantly, the lust potion.”
He could feel his friends’ and Potter’s friends’ gazes all over him, watching the situation unfold right in front of them. He had an urge to run, but he knew Potter would catch him. The thought made his body wrack with shivers, making his body shake and cower even more as he expertly avoided both the intimidating mans cock and his demanding eyes.
Draco could tell instantly that there was something underlying his words and it scared the shit out of him as his cock throbbed in time with the beat of his rapid heart.
“You okay?” He recognised Pansy’s voice as he nodded, not even bothering to look at her face as he ran a hand through his soft locks. If he had looked at her face then he would’ve seen the shit-eating grin that played on her lips.
The class, once again, went silent.
After Harry made his way past him, an evil smirk appeared on his lips from how the other reacted. He hadn’t even meant for his cock to nudge Malfoy, but it satisfied him how utterly fucked the boy looked already. He hadn’t even begun.
Their eyes were, at first, stuck on the blonde - shocked at how he looked. Draco looked a mess already, a dirty mess. It only made the itch on his skin from the pure craving he had for him, that he now knew for sure that the other reciprocated, increase. His body language and literal boner was one thing, now he had verbal consent to do all of his dirtiest fantasies to him - he couldn’t fucking wait.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest at the audible confirmation, he still had many doubts though. Surely he wasn’t the only student to smell like that, he was probably just confusing him for someone else. Malfoy’s scent was now starting to burn his senses in a really good way, his mind was starting to go fuzzy.
Draco had come up with the idea but didn’t want to be the one to make it, his excuse being that “it would be way too obvious.” It would’ve made sense for him to be the one doing it; since he was the best at potions. Regardless, his friends listened to him and Crabbe had made it.
“Harry.”
He had always been modest about it but in this moment, he was so wound up from the potion that he didn’t mind showing off. Honestly, he was kinda proud of how big his cock was - but maybe that was the lust potion talking.
“Hey! You little dick, I was drinking from that!”
“I hope we get fancy coffins for our funeral.” Harry tried his best to keep his laugh in at Ron’s word, he really shouldn’t find it funny when they really were probably going to get murdered.
“Why really? Am I that obvious? How could I not know?” Harry was genuinely shocked. Well now the longer he thought about it, the more it started to make sense.
“I-I-um-I need to-“ Before he could make anymore of a fool of himself, he was interrupted by Pansy; he was secretly grateful.
“So-“ Pansy interrupted him, the grin growing wider on her face.
“Now can you two shut up so you can actually listen to what Hermione’s about to say, she’s not even got to the good parts yet.”
“Oh yeah. Never thought it’d take kissing my best friend to fully realise.” Ron added, sharing in the chuckling.
The blonde sputtered, no words getting close to leaving his mouth. His mouth opening and closing like a fish, he knew he must’ve looked ridiculous but he had no power to stop it. Potter chuckled, it sent an icy chill through Draco’s body.
“You are pretty. However, at the same time you are such a fucking brat.”
Harry’s tongue licked across Draco’s bottom lip, he gave him access immediately. The blonde was melting into every touch, the way Harry sucked on his tongue before going back to nipping his lip made him moan contently.
He was ripped out of his thoughts from Harry laughing softly, sounding much different then when he regarded the blonde.
“I’m never letting you go.”
“Oh, we know who you were pretending it was, Harry.” Ginny grinned as she gave a 0.1 second glance towards the Slytherin table.
The realisation couldn’t be hidden from Draco’s face as he forced his gaze, from where it had fallen to the floor, back to Potter. He hoped that the message of ‘please say this is the truth’ and ‘please don’t let this be a lie’ was understood by Harry.
Harry broke out of their eye contact when a familiar voice peaked up, he moved his attention back towards the Gryffindor table.
He looked towards his friends, the darkness residing in his eyes crystal clear - they read his message and their eyes widened a little at what was about to happen.
Draco inhaled a shaky breath, his frame trembling as he cowered away from the intense gaze he was being shot. His body buzzed from the anticipation of what Harry’s next words were gonna be, he had a feeling that they’d push him over the edge.
His hand was then being taken off the other’s forearm, Harry moved his hand to press against his chest. He held his larger hand over Draco’s from where it rested on his chest.
Draco did the best he could at saying ‘mhm’ around him, it sounded more like a needy moan but Harry understood it. A rough groan leaving his mouth as he placed one hand at the back of Draco’s head, whilst one remained wrapped in his hair.
Whilst half of his friends were contemplating what the fuck Harry was gonna do to the snakes, the other half were looking at him with an eyebrow raised; still wanting a proper answer to Ginny’s question.
Harry muttered a wandless lubrication spell, his fingers now evenly coated in the slick substance. He couldn’t help but let himself smirk at the other’s whine, he knew it was because of the wandless magic he had just done.
That was Ron, he listened as the two shared a quiet laugh. He always admired how Harry’s friends were there for him, constantly ready to face death because of their love for their friend. Draco had never shown it, hell, he had been awful to them - he was already planning on his apology, after tonight of course - but he respected their friendship.
Draco was still doing it on instinct until his eyes caught the way Potter was looking at him, transfixed on his mouth. The blonde wondered if the other was thinking such filthy thoughts right now as he had voiced before. He then caught himself locking gazes with him and that answered all of his questions, purely from the scolding look he was receiving from the boy-who-lived.
“Good thing your mouths already open, best hurry up before flies go in there.”
here we fucking go, i don't apologise for this sin and it's only gonna get worse lmao. also i'd like to remind you that i wrote this purely to work on my descriptive writing so if it's almost 'too detailed' i know and if it's cringe oh well lol. anyway, hope you like it!
“Am I really gonna be forced to answer.” He rolled his eyes to show his annoyance, exhaling loudly as Snape stared him down.
Draco’s incredibly pale complexion did nothing to save him from the dusting of red covering his cheek, goddamn Snape.
They both snorted, completely unaware that Draco was listening to every word. The blonde’s blush only deepened and he questioned how much more red his cheeks could get, he knew that Harry could probably make the worse.
He laughed a little humorously, Harry confided in the other laughing at trauma. Hopefully now instead of using that to cope, they could confide in each other.
Everyone started gathering their belongings, standing up and heading to the door.
He felt the raven haired man grin against his skin, he shook from the simple action. When he felt the heat from the other fade away, he almost allowed himself to show his disappointment before remembering where they were.
“Y-You, am Y-Yours.”
The blonde’s heart pounded in his chest as he looked back into those obsidian eyes, shaking like a leaf. He had fucking seen.
The blonde boy was squirming on the small desk, unable to do anything more. He knew he wasn’t allowed to touch himself, he was just doing his best to obey the rules.
“Okay, that’s fine. Go do whatever you need to do.” Draco felt relief overtake his body, physically relaxing as he wouldn’t have to come up with a sorry excuse for a reason.
Draco couldn’t hold back the moans that flooded out of his cock filled mouth, not only was it the harshness and the throat fucking but how his hair was being pulled so cruelly. Every strand yanked sent electric shocks of pleasure from the roots, all the way down to his aching prick. He loved it all.
His eyes then found Draco’s as he maintained eye contact, his eyes were soft and careful.
It was interrupted by both Pansy and Blaise giggling, sharing a look with each other and then putting their attention back on their friend. Draco shot them a questioning look, utterly confused.
Draco had to hold back a whimper at the pure darkness that lined Potter’s tone, Harry did nothing other than look the blonde up and down in an agonisingly slow way. He really didn’t want how much he was being affected to show but he also knew that he couldn’t hide it very well, he was transparent when it came to the man in front of him.
Draco swore that he could’ve cum on the spot, a needy whine escaping from his ajar mouth.
“Hey, just look at me. We either stay out here or have our entrails hanged on the outside of Hogwarts for not coming back quick enough!”
They jumped when they heard tapping at the window, it was Snape ushering them away. Draco sighed, getting ready to speak.
“What are you talking about?” He had asked, bewildered. His friend had just taken his hand and pulled him, he had no idea where they were going. He didn’t even bother asking either, Pansy just wouldn’t reply.
Potter’s large and heated hands then moved from his hips to his ass, squeezing the pudgy flesh ruthlessly.
“So good, kitten.”
He felt his heart stutter in his chest at the other’s tone, he didn’t know how he was going to speak again after the absolute train wreck his last sentence was.
He was so wrapped up in staring at Potter’s fucking cock, he didn’t sense the heat of his person coming closer to him. He jumped out of his skin as the other’s hot mouth was at his ear, angling his body away from the many gazes and licking the shell of it slightly. Draco felt like he was going to explode.
“Why don’t you go deal with it?” Ginny looked up at him curiously as she absentmindedly rubbed the back of her neck, it should’ve been weird with how nonchalant the group were about it but somehow it was just a “normal” thing.
This only added to Draco’s blush, however, his body quickly contradicted his momentary embarrassment as he opened his legs more on instinct - clearly more than eager to have fingers inside of him and stretching him open.
“I just wanted to know for sure that I liked kissing guys, if that meant kissing Harry then that’s just what I had to do.” Ron pouted at the expression on the twins’ face, so obviously teasing. Well, what brothers would they be if they didn’t tease the second youngest sibling.
Potter started thrusting, slowly at first as he wanted the other to get used to it. Draco was already whining like a bitch in heat and it had him subconsciously quickening his pace, the fingers dug into his thighs from how much Malfoy struggled to stay stable.
Draco jumped slightly, whipping his gaze up to meet Harry’s. He took a shaky breath in at how intensely Mark was looking at him, now he didn’t trust his voice even more.
“What? Is everything ripped?” Draco had asked worriedly, his first pair of muggle jeans and he’d broken the damn things.
The boy shook in his place as his eyes dropped straight down to Harry’s hand’s actions then back to his eyes, he repeated that for as long as Harry allowed himself the touch.
“Damn fucking right. You belong to me now, you’re mine.”
“And you wonder why I call you a brat.”
“This is Amortentia, Harry. It smells differently to everyone according to what attracts them.”
He’d love to fuck Draco deep and rough, right here and in front of everyone. Letting everybody know that Draco was his, that he belonged to him. The thought made him groan quietly as he reluctantly averted his eyes away from the gorgeous boy, hoping the other had felt the feverish strength of his look.
Every shock of pain that Potter’s teeth on his neck caused, shot straight down to his swollen prick.
His stutter undermined the intent of his words terribly, he cringed inwardly. He knew that Harry would pick up on it, probably tease him for it. And Draco could not believe that being teased turned him on so much.
Harry started a brutal pace, adding another slick finger without Draco even noticing. That was until Harry chose to leave his prostate alone to massage his inner walls with all three fingers, the noise the boy let out was indescribable - it made Harry’s cock pulse with a need to be inside him.
Harry then hissed out in pain again as he increased the tight hold he had on his forehead, scowling at nobody except the pain this potion was giving him. This hadn’t happened last time.
An hour left to shower, that’d be easy. He stripped his clothes and tossed them on his bed, looking down between his legs to see that his prick was still half hard. Reliving the memory of Lucius’s trial had worked wonders, the panic attack mixed with the wholesomeness of his experience with Harry and his mother being a big help.
“This is already sounding-“ Fred started,
Goddamn Potter, his body shook more than he wanted to admit from how the Gryffindor was messing with him.
Harry slammed both his hands down onto the table, causing both his friends and the Slytherin’s - who were entranced in watching the Gryffindor’s - to jump.
Hermione grinned like a cheshire cat at the crimson red of her boyfriend’s cheeks, he really couldn’t hide his embarrassment well. Ron swiftly snapped out of it and snorted at her words.
“Yeah?” He was melting under Harry’s gaze, the butterflies were back. He could barely breathe at how warm and inviting his hand was.
The smile that graced Harry’s lips, eventually, turned into the grin that he had before. Draco felt a chill envelope him as it tickled his spine with bitter coolness, he identified the feeling as power; Potter’s power. It rolled off the other with ease, in a way that had the Slytherin squirming in place.
Draco stayed like that for another minute or so, momentarily forgetting where he was. He quickly found out when his ears zoned in on the low and heavy breathing coming from above him, he could do nothing more than squeak and drop his hand back into his lap.
“You told us that you just grew the balls to ask her out-“ George intercepted,
“Because, naughty little whores get punished.”
Draco’s jaw ached from having to be open so wide for so long, his lips burning from the pure stretch that Harry caused. The girth and length of the mans cock was gonna be the death of him, but Draco fucking loved it.
“I-I would not. You know I w-wouldn’t.”
Even though Harry was now awake and very aware of his actions, he couldn’t stop his gaze from wandering to the blonde haired Slytherin sitting at the table across from him. He may not have been stuck in his mind anymore but his thoughts about the prat were still just as filthy, he just had to look at him for a moment.
The hot breath on his earlobe that travelled down to his neck made Draco’s eyes flutter, his chest falling and rising in a rapid pace as he tried to ignore that his and Potter’s friends were watching him intently. Seeing how he melted, the tough and hard exterior that he’d worked so hard to build was shattered in seconds - all from the Gryffindor.
“Don’t ask how it came up because we can’t remember. We were wondering how good of a kisser Harry was and made a bet, whoever kissed Harry would be asked if he was a good kisser.“ Fred started.
The words the came out of the Gryffindor’s mouth next had Draco’s body threatening to orgasm as he clenched his thighs tightly, not being missed by the other’s watching eyes - nothing ever did.
Potter walked over to where Draco’s cloak was hung up, taking it off to reveal a black leather jacket - he had not noticed that. His mouth watered slightly from when he’d seen the other wear the jacket before, it suited him disgustingly well.
“Did I hear the words ‘lust potion’?” She was very interested in hearing what had to be said as she tried to hold back her grin.
“How interesting.”
A deeper look into Draco's feelings for Harry and where they could've possibly stemmed from.
“Colloportus.” Draco heard the lock click and it made breath hitch a little, he had seemingly forgotten why he was there. The sound reminded him though, Potter didn’t want them to be disturbed.
“Now, say it.” Harry’s words were like venom as he dropped Draco’s hand and stopped gripping his chin, he raised a dark eyebrow.
“I-I had a c-cold shower, I didn-“ Potter’s grin and expression made him shut his mouth, his bottom lip shaking slightly.
Draco felt like he was going to fucking explode. The absolute vulgarity pouring from Potter’s mouth, mixed with the pet-names, was a perfect cocktail that’s only purpose is arousal.
“The noises dripping from your slutty mouth tells me everything I need to know.”
“Aren’t you glad that I used a muffling spell, wouldn’t even surprise me if it didn’t work - considering how you’re already on the way to moaning like a whore.”
Draco’s eyes had widened as he saw himself, the jeans had ripped. But not in the places he had expected them too, he just thought they’d ripped normally and that he looked like a prat.
The way Malfoy was reacting to his actions and words, had his cock straining harder against the material of his jeans. Even though he could clearly see that the other that Draco was more than fine with the situation, his heart hammering, sweating and shaking profusely, how he kept reverting to nibbling on his lips to keep those delectable noises in, and especially the boner that had risen in his pants - he still wanted verbal consent.
“Because, before that, I have business to do.”
Harry shook his head, a menacing chuckle leaving his lips unintentionally. He didn’t know why he was laughing, the Slytherin’s knew that meant they were in trouble though.
“Can’t wait to see you writhing on my cock, screaming out my name.”
Draco fiddled with his hands, fully aware that soon he’d be swallowing down the other down. He wanted to touch him but felt was too awkward to make the move, it felt strange doing it with being demanded first. Merlin, he was in deep.
He had whimpered pitifully, embarrassment causing his cheeks to burn. When he saw Potter grinning at him, it only made it worse. His stomach twisted in shameful pleasure as he swallowed around the other, his other hand that still gripped Harry’s thigh twitched - wanting to touch himself.
Draco’s face heated up in seconds, not only his face but the whole of his body heating up so much that he felt like she should be burning from fire. Being this close to his rival was like adding fuel to a flame, the heat oozing off the other and adding to his own heat - reigniting the flame deep inside his groin as he felt his cock become a lot harder than half hard.
“Since you asked like such a good boy.”
It felt a little strange to him, being obedient. He liked it, he liked it a lot. Potter wasn’t here right now, nowhere near. Yet Draco was following his orders like they were all he knew, he hoped that the other would be pleased.
“‘Mione! They can probably hear you!” He stopped for a moment, before a horrified look grazed his features.
Harry still hadn’t fully realised what had just happened as he glanced around nonchalantly. That was before he slapped his hand over his mouth, his eyes widening in shock.
With a broken whimper, still quiet enough so only Harry’s ears could pick it up - he could bet that the boy was hoping that only he himself could hear them when really, his sounds were music to Harry’s ears.
He especially didn’t trust it when he looked up and for the millionth time today, caught Potter’s eye.
Harry only sniggered, mirroring Draco’s actions as he crossed his own arms. The blonde had gotten distracted from how muscular the Gryffindor’s arms looked, how his veins were popping out more than usual. His breath hitched in his throat, catching himself and looking back to his face.
Draco didn’t full trust his voice so he just nodded, sending a questioning gaze to the other as he hoped the other would understand.
“Now.” The assertiveness that oozed from Harry’s words like silk made Draco whine, his back arching up as it searched for friction that the other was not allowing him. He fucking loved the way that Potter tortured him.
“I know, sweetheart. You want it so bad, don’t you. I don’t hear you begging for it though.” His words and condescending tone made the boy bite his lip in an attempt to stop any more embarrassing noises from coming out, Harry hated that.
“How Ron solidified his sexuality questions by making out with Harry.” Ginny shook her head, how her brothers remembered anything was a miracle.
The whole Weasley clan did and it made Harry feel so genuinely happy, any time any of them mentioned it he couldn’t help but want to sob with joy. Obviously he didn’t but he always felt like it. His friends made him feel like that too, he knew he was unbelievably lucky to find such love from friends. Before he got all mushy and sappy on everyone he shook his head and concentrated on what the twins were going to do or say.
The way Harry said his name had tingles shooting throughout the whole of Draco’s body, his quiet and low voice had him staring up at him helplessly desperate.
Harry noticed, taking his hand off of himself and reaching down to grab Malfoy’s shaking hands. He placed them on his muscular thighs and let go, placing his hands atop Draco’s head. For now, he played with the snow kissed strands - the soft hair tickling his fingers.
“Damn fucking right.”
Draco’s heart dropped at the words. At this rate he’d be hard again in no time, Potter really did have a dirty mouth - the Slytherin loved it. He was a little confused by the end of the other’s sentence but quickly caught on from Harry’s next word.
The Slytherin blushed a dark shade of crimson, he was honestly surprised that his cheeks weren’t permanently shaded with pigment at this point. His breathing was incredibly uneven, the breath being knocked out of him from the question. Instantly, Draco averted his gaze to the ground - staring pointedly at their shoes.
“Evansco.” The glass residue then disappeared, he heard a muttered ‘thank you’ from his ginger haired friend.
“It doesn’t match the weather, either. It’s enchanted only for the night sky, thought it’d be nicer that way.”
Harry snorted, despite the circumstances. He shook his head slightly, before he felt the effects of the lust potion as it once again smacked him straight in the face. He couldn’t escape the bloody thing.
Harry took Draco’s chin and forced him to look up so that they were making eye contact, forcing him to look into those alluring and stygian eyes.
“-do you speak of?” George finished.
“Fuck, Draco.” Her mouth was slightly agape, not that the other could see as he had his back turned to her - ready to be encased in embarrassment before Pansy spoke.
“Honestly, can you believe her.” Ron looked over to Harry from Hermione, his eyebrows raised with an incredulous expression.
“Hey! You don’t know how insufferable it is to try get turned on by a girl! It’s incredibly frustrating!” The look he received from Hermione made his mouth stop running. “Okay, maybe I’ve been questioning and experimenting for a while…”
“You know what. So, I’m gonna prove my point.”
Their eyes then met again, that malicious smirk of Potter’s sending his mind into overdrive. His half hard cock threatened to rise even more at the fact that Harry had actually seen it, he had seen his hard on. He knew that, easily, just from the look in his eyes.
“Why?”
He noted the way that he was shaking, hands so tense in his lap, the sweat beginning to pour off him, the way his was gnawing on his lip and most interestingly to Harry - the one that really made his cock throb harshly - the bulge restricting against the fabric of his school trousers.
“Draco listen to me OK,” Harry waited until Draco was looking at him then went on, “I don't care that you did a few questionable things during the war, hell I killed a few people, I almost killed you-”
“OK, I'm not going to say this again, fuck off.”
Yes this would work, if Draco could just explain to Potter that he has had a change of heart, that he wants to help and that he’s sorry for all he’s done in the past, then maybe, just maybe Potter would forgive him. Draco looks back at Potter, so peaceful, and trots onto his stomach, curls up and falls asleep, content with his decision to formally switch sides of the war.
“Just make sure he doesn’t have rabies or something.” Hermione added sounding bored but concerned.
Harry did in fact still have Draco's wand from when he took it in the war. He'd kept it in either his draw or pocket making sure that he always had it with him. Harry didn’t know why he did but he just felt like because it wasn't his he should take extra caution over it’s wellbeing. Luckily or rather, unluckily Harry kept to his previous need to keep it near him and had it in his pocket. He didn't want to give it back, he'd gotten used to its weight in his pocket, having the constant thrum of magic against his thigh or in his robes (which is where it was now), so he was reluctant to give it back but Harry couldn't morally keep Draco's wand, could he? No. It would be wrong. So Harry reached into his robe pocket and produced Draco’s wand, wordlessly gave it to Malfoy and then picked up his pace to catch up to his friends.
“Well when I told the others that you two were shagging, we made a bet of when you would tell us about it, I said you would shag so much that it’d be days before you even came out of your room.” Ron laughed.
“Actually would it be ok if I-” Draco didn’t want to make Harry uncomfortable.
“I don't know, I guess it's just funny to me that we’re studying together. Like a week ago you still hated me.” Harry shrugged.
“Oh, sorry” Draco said, sheepishly releasing his death grip on Harry.
When both boys had caught their breath Harry moved back up the bed to kiss Draco. Draco moaned at the taste of himself in Harry’s mouth. Harry's hands roamed around Draco's stomach, reaching down and back to Draco's prick feeling it get hard again, Draco hissed from the sensitivity of his cock. “Is this going too fast?” Harry asked as he started stroking Draco's dick again.
“That was rude.” Harry said as he opened the door. Draco kicked himself for not locking it.
Draco apologied to Neville first, for all the years of bullying and unnecessary torments. He made sure to make it utterly clear that he was very sorry for everything that had happened and that he would work hard to make things right.
The two boys moved to the couch, Harry wrapped the blanket around Draco and put his arm around his shoulders to pull him closer. They sat in silence for a while, Draco quietly crying and Harry comforting him.
“That's still pretty good.”
That was all the thought he could give it because his erection was becoming painful and required wanking. So, Harry got back to bed pulled his pyjama pants down (they had little snitches on them -- Ron had given them to Harry for his birthday) and also his boxers, seized his cock, said a wand less lubrication spell and started to rub his throbbing prick faster and faster -- thinking about Draco doing this to him or sucking him off or a whole lot of things -- until he came in his fist. He laid there for a few minutes revealing in his orgasim before he cast another scourgify on himself. He went to sleep thinking about Draco and his wand, then thinking about Draco's actual wand and if Draco would confront him about it again tomorrow.
“I didn’t say anything because I was waiting for you to say something first. I came up here to give you the chance to say something, when you didn’t I realised that I would have to, I just wanted to give you the chance to tell me.” Potter got up, “Well I guess that’s it then, I’ll see you later.” Potter started walking to the door and Draco got an insane idea.
“No, I'm not being sarcastic.” Harry noticed that Draco was actually smiling.
Draco is already drifting off, but then he hears a familiar voice, “Where is Draco?” oh no. Pansy and Blase cannot see him, not now and not like this. Luckily Potter also doesn’t want to be in the company of pansy or Blase and says, “Lets go to my room, you can have a nap there.” For some reason this made Draco’s little ferret heart beat fast, really fast. He hoped Potter wouldn’t notice.
Draco could barely pay attention in class, even the ones he usually found very interesting could not capture his attention. He'd have to ask if he could borrow other people's notes. Draco shuddered at the thought. However, he was able to come up with a way to tell his mother about his new relationship, and apologise for not telling her sooner while also explaining why he hadn't.
“Stop playing games Malfoy. I know it was you. I knew the first time I saw you, no ferret is that white, also you changed back in the middle of the night. Not all of us have the luxury of sleeping properly, some of us, have what’s called trauma which gives us insomnia. I can’t sleep through the night, I knew it was you.” Potter didn’t take his eyes off of Draco.
“What bet?” Harry glared.
Draco was so shocked at what he had just heard that he said, “Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.”
Most people were either still asleep, studying or at breakfast when Draco got back to the dorm. He‘d turned back in the corridor, making sure no one saw him and made his way up to his room, uninterrupted. He was able to shower, change and get ready without any disturbance from others. That was the good thing about being in Slytherin, most people knew what personal space was. People would generally keep to themselves, knowing that if they disturb someone, they would get hexed.
“Don’t be sorry.” Harry said and he kissed Draco, his joyful air gone, now replaced with a serious one. Draco was so startled he didn’t even know what to do, he froze. After a second the shock wore off and he felt tingles all through his body, every nerve lighting up. He kissed Harry back with so much passion that Harry let out a surprised moan that was muffled by Draco’s now hungry mouth.
Draco felt slightly sick after eating too much for dessert, this however wouldn't be a problem because Draco would just throw it all up later.
“No, never mind it’s fine.” Draco said.
Harry started to move his tongue quicker, fucking Draco as deep as he could, trying to find that sweet spot that made Draco shudder with pleasure. Coaxing moans, pleas, whimpers and muttered cusses from Draco as he fucked him with his tongue, hitting that spot as often as he could. Eventually when even Harry couldn't take the teasing any more he got up onto his knees behind Draco and, having already stretched Draco with his tongue, Harry positioned his cock at Draco's entrance, whispered a quick lubrication spell and finally pushed in. Both boys moaned in relief as Harry sank all the way into Draco. The warmth of Draco one thousand times more intense now, surrounding Harry's cock, buried deep in Draco. After a few seconds of not moving Draco nodded and pushed back slightly, trying to get more. Harry got the idea and started to pull back out.
Both boys had gotten quite a bit of homework, so they mostly just spent their afternoon and most of the night (they had to get dinner in between) getting it done. This meant that they just curled up together that night. They talked for a little while but they were both tired from a full day's work and just wanted to sleep.
It was a Saturday morning and no one had classes on Saturday so both boys got to sleep in. This was good because they were both tired from the events of the previous night. They ended up sleeping in until about eleven o'clock. Draco was the first to wake though he didn't want to move so he just lay there waiting for Harry to wake. When Harry did wake up a few minutes later he looked at Draco and smiled, then said, “Hey how are you feeling?”
“Good, good. Wait you're not being sarcastic are you?”
Then the two were kissing again, more intensely and passionately than before. Harry broke the kiss to ask, “How do you want to do this?”
“I’m staying.” Potter said in a way of explanation.
When Draco opens his eyes the room looks bigger, everything looks bigger. He trots over to the mirror, but jumps back when he sees himself. I did it! He thinks, I’m a fucking ferret. Draco looks around him, notices a lack of clothes. Damn I really hope I can get those back. Draco decides to change back, just to make sure he can, he does in fact get his clothes back, then he opens the door to the ROR and changes into a ferret to test out the best ways to sneak around.
Harry just sighed and continued chuckling as he got back into his chair.
“OK cool, take your time, I'll just sit on your bed.”
“Right sorry, got caught up in the moment.” Harry said sheepishly, still blushing.
Back to my dorm Draco wanted to say but, he couldn’t say anything, just squeak indignantly.
“It’s creepy is it? Well you’d know, seeing as how for the past few nights a ferret has been sleeping with me, a ferret that looks a lot like the one Moody turned you into in forth year.” Potter looked smug but Draco kept his wand raised. “Would you consider that to be creepy?”
“Thanks.”
Harry was so surprised by his hair that he felt like if he touched it or looked away for the mirror it would spring back to the mess that it was when he entered the room. So, still looking in the mirror, he said to Draco “Wow, this is amazing! Draco a those years of being a stick up ponce about your hair have finally become useful.”
“Aww your blushing, it must have been very good if you're blushing.” Draco teased.
“I- you’ve been sleeping with a ferret? Yeah I’d say that’s creepy Potter also, too much information. There are some things you really should keep to yourself, especially, who or what you sleep with.” Draco hoped he sounded incredulous.
“It’s ok, Draco.” Potter whispered.
“Oh, oh, ah, stop laughing, it hurts, please please it hurts.” Draco tried to stop his laughter, only to start up again at the sight of Harry laughing.
“Yeah…” Draco also didn't know what to say, “Sorry for bringing it up.”
“Oh yeah it was good, in fact it was similar to what we're doing now, just with less clothes.” Harry sat back, straddling Draco's hip, and swiftly took his shirt off. Draco, having seen Harry shirtless before was not completely stunned by the sight of Harry with a bare chest. But because the sight of Harry in just his boxers is one that Draco associates with some particularly erotic memories, he found himself so lost in the sight that he didn't even realise that Harry had started kissing him. This was not a bad thing for Draco, in fact it was really good. Harry, it seems, is a really good kisser after he's just been woken up from a particularly dirty dream.
“Yeah mate it was pretty obvious, what with all the staring longingly at each other and hanging out together. Like, seriously I came by your dorm earlier and either I heard you two going at it or someone else was in there. Next time use silencing charms.” Ron said. Both boys looked at each other, wide eyes and pink cheeks, Harry shrugged apologetically.
However, his plan did not go according to plan.  He had to pass Potter’s dorm room on his way to the bathrooms, and, as he did Potter walked out, in such a hurry that he ran into Draco. This unfortunately made Draco drop most of his clothing and his towel, which exposed his still very noticeable erection. Both boys stopped, stared and then Potter started to laugh, again! Draco just picked up his clothes and continued on his way to the showers.
“You don't need to thank me, in fact I should have given it to you earlier, I don't know why I didn't.” Harry said a bit sheepishly.
Draco shook away the memory of when he first realised that he was somewhat attracted to Potter. There were other occurrences where Draco had been aroused by Potter but all were accompanied by the knowledge that Harry hated Draco and that it was most likely the result of his hormones and the conflict between him and Harry. But now the conflict had been resolved (mostly) and they were on the fast track to becoming friends. This made Draco unironically conflicted. Did he like like Harry or did he just have a lot of mixed emotions and hormones that were making him feel this way? Well either way he knew that he would have no chance with Harry anyway. They could be friends but nothing more. Harry probably wasn't even into guys.
Draco finished his food and abruptly got up, all eyes turned to him, “Um, thanks for being so kind to me, I know I don’t deserve it, so thanks. I’ll be leaving now though, I’ve got a lot of homework to do so I’m going to go to that now. Anyway, um, bye.” Draco had never felt so inarticulate, so vulnerable, he didn’t know what to do so he just left, as swiftly as he could. He didn’t want those eyes on him anymore. He definitely didn’t want Potter’s eyes on him anymore, finally looking at him like a friend. So long he wanted Potter to look at him like that, so long that it didn’t feel real. Almost like it was forced, or imagined.
Though right as he was about to change, the door opened. “Draco?” he heard the familiar sound of Potter’s voice.
1. He couldn't stand there all day and
“OK, spread your legs then.” Harry said as he moved back. Draco brought his knees to his chest and spread them apart.
This was not part of the plan, he was going to sneak into the Slytherin dorms and change back then come up with the best way to utilize his new skill. Now that plan has been intercepted by Potter and utterly ruined by his exhaustion. Well he’ll just have a quick nap and leave when Potter falls asleep.
“Really?” Draco said incredulously.
“Says the person who can do 15 fucking wand less spells.” Harry said faining irritation.
“Two.” Draco added
“Great idea Draco.” Harry copied Draco.
Draco was cut off by Harry saying, “Neither did I.” he smirked at Draco, then brushed back his hair and kissed him again, just a short sweet kiss and said, “I like your hair a lot better like this: free. It looks so much better on you, and I’ve been dying from the urge to brush it out of your face, to run my hands through it.” he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair then as if to prove his point.
“Hmm, yeah you're not too bad yourself.” Draco mused.
“Ok well,” Potter scratched the back of his head, “just, I don’t know, apologise to ‘Moine and Ron as well and you’ll have to make an effort to prove that you really are on our side. I believe you, but I don’t trust you.” Potter could be very mature, when the occasion called for it, Draco thought.
“What the fuck do you think you're doing?” it wasn't really a question.
“Ha ha, what's it going to take to get you to stop calling me that?”
They spent the rest of their walk just talking about everything and nothing, discussing homework and how the first years are so much shorter than they were when they started. But soon they were being reminded by their stomachs that it was time to head in and go to dinner.
“Well fine but I deserve you, and I deserve you at your best so I'm here to help you.” Harry was not going to let Draco go that easily.
They’d been dulling, as everyone else in their Dada class had been, and somehow Harry had ended up stradling Draco’s hips. They were both tired out from the fight, panting and sweating. Harry leaning over Draco -- who had been disarmed by Harry -- with his wand aimed at Draco’s chin, if one of them just moved a few inches toward the other they would have been kissing. Harry had clearly won the fight but he wasn't moving off Draco, so Draco did the only logical thing, he bucked his hips to get Harry to move off of him. This however only served to show how both boys had erections.
Hoping was too much to ask for. Draco was too distracted to properly make his potion, getting an A for Acceptable where he’d usually get an O for Outstanding. He was also too distracted to focus on the notes for charms, Flitwick snapping at him to pay attention. He got the transfiguration spell wrong because he was too busy watching Potter, luckily he was able to salvage it before McGonagall could get too irritated by his incompetence. He was also hopeless at lunch, unable to follow any conversation because all he could do was look at Potter. He would look back at Draco occasionally, scowling each time he locked eyes with Draco, but Merlin, a scowl looked good on him. How had he only just realised that Potter looked good?
“You’re doing a better job than I am,” Draco smiled at Harry and sat up, he spun around to face him and said, “I mean I practically worshiped you throughout my childhood, all I wanted was to be your friend. So long I imagined us meeting, Father always told me that people would respect our last name, I just assumed that you would want to be my friend because I’m a Malfoy. I imagined it for so long that it felt real, I was just a boy and you were my only friend, I’d tell you everything. I used to write you letters, I never sent them obviously, but I wanted to. I never had any proper friends so I had to invent one, and you were famous, the best of the best, you were the only one good enough for me. So when I got to finally meet the real thing and you rejected me, it was like my only friend, the one person I trusted most in the world, had just dumped me for someone I was always taught was less, unworthy of someone like Harry Potter, I hated you then. My best friend.” Draco looked at Harry’s astonished expression.
“Right, well you can stop fretting I’m just having a nap, apologising is tiring.” Draco tried to sound like he wasn’t hurt by the fact that Potter didn’t trust him, he knew that it was reasonable for Potter to still be untrusting but it hurt none-the-less. “But Potter, if you don’t even trust me then why call me ‘Draco’?”
Draco was beyond embarrasses, he was completely mortified. His first night spent with Harry and he had to go and vomit all over it. He'd ruined it. Harry would never want to be with him after this. And now he was here with draco, rubbing his back and helping him through it. Though when Draco finally finished Harry handed him some toilet paper and helped him up. Draco wiped his mouth then went over to the sink to rinse his mouth out since he'd forgotten his wand and was too tired to do any wand less magic. Harry stayed with him the whole time, running his back and saying “It's OK Draco.” or some variation of that over and over. Draco hadn't told Harry about his eating troubles and so as soon as he could speak again he started to apologise and explain to Harry but Harry just said “Draco, it's OK you have nothing to be sorry about and you can talk to me in the morning. Right now you just need some sleep, OK?” Draco just nodded and let Harry guide him back to bed.
“No. Look I just wanted to apologise to you. Not just about this morning, though definitely about this morning, but also about these past couple of years.” Harry paused to take a breath, “I just wanted to say that I shouldn't have done that, any of that, and I'm sorry if I annoyed you or hurt you and I'd really like to start over.” Draco looked dubious so Harry added “I'm serious, I want to start over with you. I don't want to be ‘enemies’,” -- he used air quotes when he said “enemies” -- “any more I want to be friends or at least I want us to be friendly toward each other.” he looked up expecting Draco to punch him or hex him but what he saw was, what looked like, Draco considering it.
“Ha, it takes more than just food,” Harry twirled Draco around, “it also takes you being so damned hot and adorable and romantic and just overall amazing.” Harry said as they started to sit down.
“Well stop it, it's getting on my last nerve.” Draco was only half serious.
“You know?” Harry said incredulously.
Draco turned back into a ferret, still snuggling into Potter though. He went back to sleep in Potter’s arms, one of the better sleeps he’s had in so long that he can’t remember his last good sleep.
“yep.” Draco answered.
“Um, well,” Harry paused to rub the back of his neck with his hand, “I guess so, I just didn't really think that I should break it, like I said before you don't deserve that.” he shyly smiled at Draco,”And, well yeah I do like you, as a friend,” he hurried to add,”so yeah I made sure that your wand was safe.”
Harry walked into the bathroom and heard a sound that he recognised as someone vomiting. He quickly ran to the source of the sound and found Draco kneeling over the toilet and vomiting. Harry knelt down behind Draco and rubbed small circles on Draco's back to ease his sickness. Harry also muttered some encouraging words, ‘It's OK.’, ‘You're almost done.’, ‘Take some deep breaths and try to calm down.’ etc.
“Wow, great one Draco I think that's the best insult you've ever given me.” Harry sassed back.
Draco shook his head and pulled back again, “No, it’s not ok, it never will be. How can you forgive me, I was going to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts to kill Dumbledore, I still have to. If I don't He’ll kill them, He’ll kill me. I’m so sorry, Harry, I’m so sorry.” Draco stood up and started to run again, too ashamed of himself to stay.
“One.” Harry said.
Hermoine gave them a look that said “You’re late” as they sat down at the end of the Gryffindor table to have breakfast, still holding hands. Harry returned the look with one of his own that he hoped would say “I know, but I don’t care”. She went back to eating her breakfast and reading from ‘The Prophet’. After a few moments of silence Draco spoke up and said, “Can I read that when you’re done ‘Mione?”
But as hard as he tried he couldn’t pay attention to his best mate. Since the war he's felt empty, except for when he was thinking about Draco or wanking while thinking about Draco. At first he had been startled by his new feelings toward the blond but now he takes comfort in it. He imagines life with Draco, kissing him, cuddling with him, being loved by him, making love with or to him. Though he generally thought about the last one while he was wanking. His feelings for Draco were an escape for him, they gave him something to focus on, something to hope for, something to fill his dreams other than the nightmares he has where Voldermort comes back or when he doesn't save Malfoy from the fire in the room of requirement. He's watched Draco strip for him but he's also watched draco slip from his grasp and fall into the fires below.
2. Ron had started dragging Harry by his right sleeve while Hermione one scolded him for standing around.
“No, no I’m so sorry, for everything.” Draco pulled back to look at Potter through teary eyes.
“OK, maybe it wasn't nice that you kept it but it was nice that you didn't break it. And you did give it back.” Draco felt the need to reassure Harry that the whole wand situation was forgiven.
“Don’t play dumb Malfoy. I know about your animagus.” Potter said, motioning to Draco.
“OK good because I don’t think I can stop now.” Harry went back to kissing Draco. He kissed and licked down Draco’s neck and chest. He stopped to suck on each of Draco’s nipples. Draco moaned at every kiss, lick and suck from Harry. Harry continued kissing down to Draco’s stomach playing with Draco’s nipples at the same time. When Harry reached the top of Draco’s boxers he teased the edge with his fingertips and when Draco lifted his hips impatiently Harry gave in and took them off slowly. Harry revealed Draco’s cock (which was definitely above average) and wrapped his hand around it. Draco moaned so loud at the feeling of his cock being touched.
“OK, I like it a little but it's still really annoying.”
Out of breath but finally sure he was alone he slowed down to a walk again, he always came here when he needed to be alone. It was his only sanctuary, the Room of Requirement, full of everything and nothing at the same time. It was whatever he chose it to be, all he wanted right now, a couch. He’d brought a book but what he wanted, needed more than anything was a nap. Draco put his book on the floor next to the couch, draped his blanket on it and layed on the couch curled up under the blanket.
“I know, you already apologised for everything, and it’s ok we all forgive you.” Potter said to Draco, pulling him back into a tight hug.
“I do love you but if you don't send a letter to your mother then she will probably come here and kill me.” Harry brought one of his hands to cup Draco's cheek.
I really struggled with this chapter so sorry if it's bad.
Harry moved beside Draco and they looked at each other in the mirror. Both boys were silent for a bit then Draco broke it by saying, “That's a bit of a mood killer huh.” Draco laughed bitterly. He had never hated himself more than he did right at that moment.
But now that he’s thought about it, it’s happened before. Draco has been aroused by other boys, which was fine, but he has also been aroused by Harry before.
“I meant what the fuck are you doing in my room?” he emphasised the word ‘fuck’.
Harry wiped away Draco’s tears and hugged him. After a few moments Harry pulled back and kissed Draco’s cheek, forehead, nose, chin, then finally his lips. His hands came up to cup Draco's face while he kissed Draco with a slow intensity.
“But I cursed that girl, I was the reason Dumbledore died. I became a fucking Death Eater!” Draco pulled up his sleeve to show his dark mark, then continued, “I'm not innocent in this Harry I do deserve to live like this, what I don't deserve is you.” Draco finished sadly.
“That's not what you said last night.”
Draco knew that Harry meant it, so with exhaustion creeping up on him he replied simply, “Love you too.” and they were both asleep, snuggled into each other.
“Right well anyway we have transfiguration in about 10 minutes so we should probably go.” he said as he pushed himself off the sink.
“Yeah it is a bit, but let's just go back to my room and we can talk do whatever.” Harry put his arm around Draco.
“Look, no one knows about this, not Ron, not ‘mione, no one. So you have to promise not to tell anyone.” Harry said very seriously.
As soon as Draco got back to Harry's room he started to take off his clothes and put another of Harry's T-shirts on then got back into Harry's bed. Harry watched as Draco did this then he also got changed back into his boxers and a
Not that it mattered anyway, especially with what he did during the war, he deserved this. It was his punishment for becoming a Death Eater.
“Fine, but just so you know I will resent you for this.” Draco said, walking over to the desk in Harry's room.
“Yes, I was just teasing you,” Harry put his hand on Draco’s cheek, “it's fun to tease you, you get all red.” Harry laughed and leaned in to kiss Draco's forehead.
“Yeah.”
“Sorry can't do that, you look like a tomato.” Harry was laughing again now.
“Yeah, he does.” Potter answered.
“I love you too.” Draco realized that he did love Harry and that he always had.
Harry got to Draco’s door and knocked on it. It seemed that Draco was in the middle of getting dressed because what Harry saw when the door was opened aroused him. Draco was standing in the doorway on just his boxers and socks,hair mussed and sticking up every which way. Harry had never seen Draco this way, so casual and vulnerable. Harry almost turned around and left in fear that he wouldn't be able to stop himself from taking Draco right at that moment. Though Draco saved him the trouble by saying, “Oh, sorry, I'll just put my clothes on and I'll be ready to go in a minute.”
“Draco, come on I know you're hungry too so just come on. Then I promise I'll spend the rest of the day with you.” Harry bargained.
“OK, boyfriend.” Draco said,“Kiss me boyfriend.”
Though now that he was going back to Hogwarts and he would have classes and homework and assessments and N.E.W.T’s. Well hasn't exactly excited about that but at least it resembled something normal and everyday and mundane. It also helped that there was no longer a raging psychopath trying to kill him all the time. It gave him a piece of mind. Though with years of being conscience of Voldemort trying (and failing) to kill Harry every year it was hard to shake that he would be safe from Voldermort. However there were still the Voldermort sympathisers who might be lurking around the corner waiting to get revenge and bring justice and an unsuspecting Harry Potter.
“You ready to write to your mother?” Harry asked, voice muffled due to his lips still being pressed to Draco's head.
“I promise, no one but me will know.” Draco said making a cross over his chest with an index finger.
“I'm sure that you would have found some other way.” Draco didn't want praise for his actions during the war, everything he did was selfish even helping Harry was selfish.
“N-no- Merlin that feels so good Harry. Keep going.” Draco moaned at Harry's hand on his sensitive cock.
Though both boys wanted to avoid the subject they ended up talking about the war. About their roles and what Harry did when he was a fugitive on the run. About what Draco did while Harry was a fugitive on the run. They talked about all the horrible things Voldemort did to both of them, though mainly Draco as he had to live with Voldemort. Draco explained the reason as to why he cursed Katie Bell, why he tried to kill Dumbledore. He also talked more about his vomiting, when and why it started. How he hasn’t been able to keep a meal down for months. Draco then vomited into a bush, he’d tried not to eat too much for dinner as he’d found that he was able to keep it down longer if he ate less. Harry changed the subject then, talking about their potions essay that was due in on Thursday.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know-”
“G’night, Draco.” Harry said as he stroked Draco’s back.
This brought Harry back to reality, the one where he wasn't with Draco and where he still hadn't come out to his friends who were dragging him onto a train.
Draco cut him off saying, “And if you did? What then? Would you have been kind? That’s not the point, Potter, I don’t blame you, I was an arrogant prick, I know that now, but back then that’s all I knew. I know better now though, I’ve learnt from you, how to be good. I’m better because of you and if after all these years you’ll finally reconsider my offer of friendship?” Draco looked to Harry, hopefully, expectantly.
“I-I” Harry stuttered, not knowing how to reply.
“What? No, you can't!” Draco was still lying down but he had his arms outstretched towards Harry. “Please Harry come back, keep kissing me.” Draco was begging Harry.
Draco woke up in a foul mood. He had not only wanked to the thought of Potter but he had dreamt of him and Potter doing intimate things with each other. Just thinking about it now sent a shiver down his spine, but it also made him hard. He was hard because of Potter. Potter! Of all the people in Hogwarts it had to be Potter.
“Yeah good idea dumbass.” Draco had started to walk toward the door and Harry followed him.
The sun was starting to dip down, almost touching the horizon. The sky had turned a pinky color and Draco decided that he liked the way it made Harry's hair look more like a halo, the setting sun turning it gold at the edges. Draco had always wanted to touch Harry’s hair, ever since the day he’d met him, ‘now’, he thought, ‘he could’. Not being able to resist any longer, Draco brought his hand up to Harry's hair and ran his fingers through the strands. Harry looked up at Draco then, and slowly brought his lips up to meet Draco's.
“Why are you so good to me.” Draco looked at Harry.
“Well yeah but still…” Harry trailed off.
Draco had only ever heard those words from his mother and occasionally his friends, though having Harry tell Draco that he loves him, well, Draco had never thought that the day would come. But there it was. Harry had said those words. Harry loves Draco. Does Draco love Harry? No. Maybe? No, he likes Harry sure. OK he really likes Harry. Like really really likes Harry. But does Draco love Harry. Well he definitely loved hearing Harry say that he loves Draco.
“But what if she doesn’t? What if she hates me?” Draco half sobbed into Harry’s chest.
“Maybe, but you still helped us even if it was just so I would win, that was still really brave of you to do, hey maybe you should have been a Gryffindor.” Harry was trying to change the serious convocation back to joking again to ease the tension.
“Well no, but it wasn't just you I gave as good as I got.” Harry felt just as bad.
“15 really? I can only do about 3 myself.”
The two boys say at the slytherin table with Draco's friends, Pansy Parkinson and Blase Zabini. They knew of Draco and Harry's new friendship so they weren't really surprised when Harry sat with them. Conversation came fairly easily, after a few quick apologies about past grievances they were able to get along quite well. They disagreed on a few things and quarreled over them but mostly they were civil. They avoided talking about the war and manly talked about Quidditch and homework, but it was nice for Harry to have someone else to talk to about these things. Having only Ron, Hermione and a few select others in his small group of friends it was good to talk with someone outside his immediate group. Though it was still the same generic answers, ‘we have too much homework’, ‘we should only have to go to class for two days rather than five’, ‘the teams for Quidditch are really good this year’ etcetera, etcetera.
“Yeah, Yeah. He’s fine.” Potter dismissed her.
“I said you’d tell us in potions tomorrow.” Dean also looked down at his food.
After a bit more back and forth with Draco calling Harry different things and Harry threatening to kill Draco if he ever called Harry that again, they saw that it had got red quite late and Harry went back to his room. Harry got into his pyjamas, brushed his teeth, had a quick wank then went to sleep. It was the first good night's sleep he'd had in a long time.
“I'm talking to you.”
He was awoken by movement behind him. Potter was getting up, slowly and carefully almost as if he was attempting not to disturb Draco. At this his heart melted and sped up simultaneously. But Draco quickly put his feelings aside and jumped off the bed, still a ferret thank Merlin. Though as soon as he made a break for the door Potter grabbed him up, brought him close to his face and said, “Where do you think you’re going?”
“Sorry,” Harry did mean it but he couldn't resist poking fun at Draco, “it is funny though, especially when you try not to get annoyed by me. Like if this was from before we were friends you would have already told me to fuck off.”
“Your not a fuck up. You went through something traumatic and your having trouble dealing with it but I'm here to help you now OK.” Harry reassured Draco.
When they pulled away they stood there, silent, for just a few moments and looked into each other’s eyes. In that moment both boys knew that no matter what, they would always be OK. Harry smiled and pulled Draco back towards him, this time, though, it was for a hug, one that they both needed. Draco buried his face into the crook of Harry’s neck, breathed the scent of him in, attempting to memorise the heady, uniquely Harry smell there.
He could smell the smoke and when the train finally pulled into the station the smoke stung his eyes. Or at least that's what he told Ron, when he'd asked why Harry's eyes started to water. Truth be told Harry wasn't sure if it was just the smoke or if he was crying with the relief of getting to finally go home.
Potter grabbed Draco’s arm, pulling him back into a hug, “I’ll help you, ok, you don’t have to do anything, I’ll help you Draco you’re not alone.” Draco didn’t realise how alone he’d felt until Harry said those words, until he suddenly didn’t feel so alone anymore.
“Yeah, take all the time you need.” Harry did not want Draco to take any time, he wanted an answer right now, but Draco had already gotten up and was walking away. Harry sat there and finished his half of the food, thinking about what he'd just done and how he had potions with the hufflepuffs in about ten minutes.
He of course apologised to Luna, ginny, Seamus, Dean and the others at the table, he wanted to make sure that everyone knew that he was sincere in his apologies and that he'd make up for past grievances.
“Ha, I know all about your reputation and it’s going to be changed right here, right now.” Draco said proudly.
“Nah, I’m just annoyed ‘mione won the bet.” Ron sulked.
Potter ran over to Draco and pulled him to his chest, hugging him, “Hey, hey Draco, it’s ok, I forgive you. I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” Potter whispered, soothingly and stroked Draco’s back with one hand, the other running slowly through Draco’s hair. Draco hugged Potter back, clinging to him for dear life.
“Well since I was thinking of using you as a pillow I don't really mind.” Draco said.
“‘Cause they're a piece of shit that's why.” Draco spat.
“Ha, like I wouldn't have been thinking about you anyway.” Harry said without thinking, so he added, “Because I'd be thinking of how I hated that you had my wand.” it was a feeble attempt at a save.
“Pansy.” Darco said, imitating her tone.
“OK, I know we have an unspoken agreement about not talking about my wand but I just have to know, did you keep it in a good condition because you like me, like because you wanted to be friends with me?” Draco decided that it was safe enough to ask this now.
Harry so desperately wanted to go over to him and tell him that he would always be there for him and that whatever draco needed Harry would provide him with it. Harry wanted Draco full stop (period).
“Fucking hell Harry you can't just say things like that.” Draco was on his hands and knees instantly.
“Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.”
“I’m happy because I get to kiss you and tell you I love you.” he kissed Draco’s forehead to prove his point.
“C’mon,  you can stay in here today. It’s too cold outside right now, stay in here where it’s warm.” Potter said as he walked back over to his bed, Draco squirming the whole time attempting to escape Potter’s grip. Potter put him back on his bed, smoothing back his fur and said, “If you stay here I’ll bring you back some breakfast.”
“No it's not. You're just a fucking prick!” and at that Draco stormed away, back to his room harry assumed.
“No, Draco I shouldn't have fired that curse. I should have helped you then but I didn't. I can help you now though. I want to help you because I care about you.” Draco looked up at Harry again, “Draco please let me help you, if not because you deserve it then because I'm the saviour of the wizarding world and I need to save you.” Harry finished with a bit of a joke.
“No, I hurt you and I should love you.” Draco sobbed harder.
“Hey little guy, where did you come from?” he’s utterly insufferable, but his hands are so nice and warm. Draco realises just how tired he is, the books did say that he may experience symptoms such as tiredness after the first change, but he didn’t think he’d be this tired. Despite it being Potter he decides, fuck it, I’m tired and I’m going to sleep, Potter even lets him. “Aw, are you tired?”
“Just you, I mean, you’re an animagus, which by itself is amazing, but you’re also on our side now. Assuming that you are telling the truth.” Potter looked at him, serious.
“What’d you mea- oh right, well I don't care anymore so just go, would you?” Draco remembered the events of the previous night.
“It’s ok, now why don’t you do what you came up here to and have a nap, and you know what I’m going to nap too, you can sleep on my stomach, if you still want to sleep in your animagus form.” Harry said, as he started to lie back.
“Your welcome dick head.”
“No you’re not. Look Potter, I know that you think you can do anything because you’re the chosen one, but really you can’t. And you can’t just sit there and watch me sleep. For one thing, it’s creepy and for another, it’s creepy. Now leave before I make you.” Draco pointed his wand at Potter.
“Fine then, Harry, why don't we hard down to the great hall.” he emphasised Harry's name.
“I'd do anything for you, but I'm not writing to your mother about our relationship.” Harry said, bringing his hands to Draco shoulders and looking him square in the eyes.
That was until Malfoy bumped into Harry’s shoulder on his way past, turned around to look at Harry and said, “Oh look, the saviour of the wizarding world doesn't even know how to walk.”
“Oh, that. Yeah I just wanted to apologise.” Draco said, trying to sound as sincere and sorry as he could, it was difficult seeing as it was not an interaction common between himself and Potter.
Harry sat up and looked at Draco, “Draco, I- why didn't you say anything? I could have helped you.”
“Draco, I'm not fine.” Harry said.
Which was exactly who Harry was thinking about right as Draco strode through the entrance to the platform and walked over to board the train that had just pulled in. The sight of draco stirred Harry’s thoughts in a different direction. They went from pondering how soft draco's hair would feel to how lonely, tired and empty draco looked at that moment. Still he had his pride and walked with his head held as high as he could get it without him seeming arrogant. Harry admired him for his ability to hide his pain but was also sad that he had learned it so well. Though Harry knew what pain looked like and he also knew draco (if not personally then from years of “casually observing” him) and Harry could see through draco's mask straight through to his pain.
“No. Don't remind me.” Draco whined, “Can't you just do it for me?” Draco looked up at Harry then.
The kiss ended and Harry pulled back to look at Draco. Harry knew he shouldn't have said that to Draco. He'd known that Draco's feelings for him weren't as strong. He'd known that and still he had to tell Draco that he loved him. Draco looked like he was having an internal debate of whether to lie and say he loves Harry too or to tell the truth and say he doesn't love Harry. But Harry has been in love with Draco for a long time now and Draco has only just realized his feelings for Harry, so Harry decided to say, “Draco, it's OK if you don't love me back. I just needed to tell you.” Harry smiled sadly.
Potter didn’t take long, he was out seconds after Draco. They looked at each other, Potter questioning and suspicious, Draco open and sincere. Potter sighed and said, “I knew it.”
But the sight of Hogwarts lifted his spirits, and the sight of the feast made him want to eat for the first time in months. However, sitting there now at the end of the slytherin table thinking about everything he just ate and knowing that it would not stay down, at least not all of it. So Draco resigned himself to never eating a proper meal again. He wanted to, but he just couldn't.
Draco grabbed his wand off the floor quickly asked permission to go to the bathroom and ran out of the classroom, leaving Harry standing there shocked and helpless (and horny).
“But it is my fault, ever since the war I haven't been able to eat anything and if I try I just end up throwing it up.” Draco explained.
“Draco how many times do I have to say it, you didn't do anything bad, you don't deserve to live this way.” it was like talking to a brick wall.
“Well to start you'll have to do all of my homework, you'll have to feed me, do all of my cleaning basically you'll be my slave.” Draco was mainly joking.
“Do you still want to go to sleep?” Harry asked, breaking the silence.
Then they were kissing. Slowly at first, just testing the waters, then Harry liked Draco's bottom lip asking for entrance. Draco happily gave it to him, opening his mouth to let Harry explore it with his tongue. The boys just melted into one another, kissing and running their hands over the other. There was no pressure for anything more in that kiss, just the movement of lips and tongues. Draco pulled away first, needing to take a breath. Both boys were panting from lack of breath but they were smiling at each other. “Wow.” Draco said.
“Fine but you better keep your promise.” Draco agreed.
The two boys spent the rest of the afternoon and night sitting on Harry's bed just talking and kissing every now and then. It got quite late and Harry said “You know you don't have to go, you can just sleep here tonight.”
Draco walked through the open doors, looking behind himself only once to make sure no one was watching. When he was sure he was out of sight, he ran. Ran all the way to his dorm. When he got there he grabbed a book and a blanket from his trunk, then he was running again.
When Harry got to the bathroom he made sure that no one but Draco was in there then closed and locked the door with every locking charm he knew and dashed over to the stall Draco was kneeling in. Then feeling a great sense of Deja voo and remembering the events of the previous night he knelt beside Draco. Harry rubbed circles on Draco's back and brushed the hair out of draco's face. He whispered the same encouraging words he had before. When Draco was done Harry once again handed Draco some toilet paper to wipe away anything that had missed the toilet. Draco flushed the toilet and went to the sink to rinse out his mouth again, like he had done last night, and so many other times.
“Really, I'm pouring my heart out here and you're just gonna say that I'm ‘not too bad’?” Harry asked.
“Thank you.” Draco said.
“Keeping your wand from you wand nice?” Harry would have thought the opposite.
“Of course, because then you couldn't use it without thinking about me.” Draco was laughing too.
Harry said as he walked over to the bed.
“Yeah? Oh Merlin, what time is it?” Harry looked around, then he reached down beside the couch to retrieve his glasses.
“Let's have sex.” Harry repeated.
“I can’t. It’s not even that funny.” Harry said laughing even harder.
After breakfast with the slytherins Harry had charms with the hufflepuffs and Draco had herbology with the ravenclaws. So they went their separate ways. Harry sat through his charms class for the full hour not taking a single thing of the theory in. He tried but he could only think of Draco. He thought of the dream he had and how Draco looked in just his boxers and socks. He thought of Draco's hands in his hair,  how he wished Draco was there with him, playing with his hair, joking with him, anything. God, Harry thought, when did I go from hating Draco to fucking wanting him? Somewhere over the course of the war. Sixth year maybe. He'd felt so bad about delivering that curse to Draco. Though thinking about it now Harry didn't remember seeing any scars on Draco’s chest where the curse hit him. Maybe the damage wasn't that bad. Maybe if Harry kissed Draco there it would be OK, maybe it would make up for any damage Harry had caused Draco. Harry just really wanted to kiss Draco. Then he couldn't stop thinking about what it would be like to kiss Draco. He was so caught up in thinking about kissing Draco that when Draco appeared in front of him he got such a shock that he actually jumped back. “You OK mate?” Draco asked not without sympathy.
“You have to get up ‘cause if you don't then I won't get up, then we'll both get in trouble for being late to class.” Harry pulled Draco closer to him.
Harry kissed Draco again, not for show or just because he wanted to but because he needed to, it was the only way to show how truly happy he was in that moment. Draco loves him and he really couldn’t be happier. Despite everything Harry was happy, all because of those four words. He knew that everything would be OK just from hearing Draco finally say that he loves Harry.
“Ha, your so easy.” Draco glared at Harry's reflection. “But seriously, thank you, Draco. This is amazing.” Harry said as sincerely as he could.
The two boys decided to have a picnic at lunch, they had different classes in the morning so they were unable to spend much time together, but Harry had the idea of lunch outside, a picnic, this appeared to be a great idea, one which Draco was very enthusiastic about. Draco put a whole buffet of food together for their picnic, he conjured a rug and cushions for them to sit on. He was allowed out of class early so he set the whole thing up while Harry was still in class. When Harry came outside after returning his books to his dorm he smiled, picked Draco up and kissed him. After putting Draco back down Harry said, “This is why I love you.”
Harry bent down to leave open-mouthed kisses on Draco's lower back. He continued kissing and sucking until finally he got to Draco's puckering hole. Harry slowly inserted his tongue into it, feeling the warmth of Draco and tasting what Harry could only describe as sweet, salty and purely Draco.
“That's exactly what I'm going to do.” Draco seemed too excited.
“Yeah, better than I expected.” Harry agreed.
“Fine.” and Draco closed the door to his dorm in Harry’s face.
“Sure, why not?” it was a rhetorical question.
“I didn't make that any easier for you, did I?” Draco thought back to all of the times that he teased, hurt, hexed or just annoyed Harry over the years.
“Hey, it’s what I do.” Harry laughed and hugged Draco tighter. “C’mon, let’s sit down.”
“OK.” Draco said and then added, “You got anything I can sleep in?”
“You’re more annoying.” Draco quipped back, “And you're stupid too.”
Harry just shook his head and laughed again. Soon both boys were laughing. “Hey, why did you get so freaked out when I asked you why it mattered?”
“Well actually He's not a girl.” Harry said stalling for time to make his decision.
“Well firstly, I said you take long showers, then I said that your cock is--” Draco cut him off before Harry could finish.
Potter gets into bed next to Draco, is this really creepy? Draco thinks, well it’s only as creepy as I make it. Draco decides. It was Potter who brought him here anyway so really he’s to blame, bringing random ferrets into bed with him, it’s like he’s trying to be the dumbest ass in the whole of Hogwarts. It’s surprising, really, that The Dark Lord hasn’t been able to kill the prick yet. Also, who cares, Potter is his own personal heater. Draco thinks, So really it’s just all about warmth, not Potter, no one is taking advantage of Potter, nope, just maybe the situation. Besides, Potter never needs to know.
“Well yes I would like to know, that's why I asked.” Draco deadpanned.
“Draco, I already did, friends?” Potter held out his hand.
The throwing up started during his sixth year. After becoming a death eater and having the Dark Lord live at the manner with him and his family, it became impossible for him to keep any food down. He'd thought that it would stop once the war was over, that he would go back to normal, be able to eat and dream and sleep and just be happy. He should have known better. He hadn't been able to eat, sleep or stop the nightmares after -- and during -- the war.
The kiss got more and more passionate and Harry and Draco moved to lie back down, Harry on top of Draco. Their lips moved together and it was the best kiss either of them had ever had. But Harry broke it to start kissing down Draco’s jaw to his neck. Kissing, sucking, nipping and liking all over Draco's neck. He started at the spot where Draco's jaw ends, just below his ear, Draco moaned at the feeling of Harry's lips there. Harry moved down and started on the place where Draco's neck met his shoulder, Draco’s moans got louder. Harry stopped to put up some quick silencing charms before he moved to Draco's left side. He repeated what he did which made Draco moan and squirm under Harry.
Draco had no real desire to see Potter dorm, he had no reason to. But as soon as they entered Draco felt a bubbling sensation flow through his body. He couldn’t place the feeling exactly, it was a cross between nerves and excitement, almost as if his tiny ferret body couldn’t handle these new emotions. Potter was carrying him straight to one of the beds, Potters Draco assumed. He murmured things to Draco all the way to the dorm and was still murmuring to him now, things like, “You’re so tiny” and “aw, look at you, so adorable” it was sickening really. His voice was too many octaves higher than usual, still Draco couldn’t help but love the new attitude that Potter had toward him. It was so much better than the usual hatred in his voice, in his eyes, his stance, his whole being. Now a kindness replaced it, a warmth that Draco assumed Potter only reserved for those he cares about, someone who is not Draco. He almost resented Potter more because of it. At least until Potter said, “C’mon baby, I’m tired too, let’s sleep on my bed.” Then he really did resent Potter. How dare he be so nice to a random Ferret but not an eleven year old boy who just wants to be his friend. No, Draco let that go, he does not dwell on past grievances, he is a Malfoy, he has dignity. He is sleeping in Potter’s bed, with Potter, as a ferret and he has dignity, who is he trying to kid.
“Are you sure?” Harry stopped his hand and looked at Draco for confirmation.
Though these days there was someone else on Harry’s mind, three guesses who, yep, you got it, it was Draco Malfoy.
Draco lunged forward, knocking Harry’s hand out of the way to hug him, he squeezed Harry so hard, scared that he would change his mind, or that he wasn’t being serious, “You’ve no idea what that means to me, no idea.”
“OK time for breakfast.” Harry said as he moved off of Draco and got out of the bed.
Soon the two boys were kissing each other and rubbing their hips together. Draco had rolled over to get a better advantage. This proved to be mostly fruitful though it still was not enough for either boy. Harry was the first to acknowledge this by snaking his hand down the front of Draco's shirt and to his boxers (both boys only wore a T-shirt and boxers to bed) where he reached his hand past the waistband and began stroking Draco's cock. Draco already moaning from just rutting against Harry was reduced to whimpers and pleads for more. Harry indulged Draco by removing both of their clothing and kissing Draco's chest whilst still stroking Draco's cock. Harry continued his way down Draco's chest and stomach until he reached the skin just above Draco's prick. Harry then licked the head of Draco's cock, earning a loud moan from Draco. Harry feeling a little neglected started to stroke his own cock as he started sucking Draco's. Both moaning at the sensations, Draco's becoming louder though because of the vibrations Harry made along Draco's cock. Harry sucked Draco's cock deeper into his mouth, he moaned again and again, reducing Draco to whimpers and pleads. Draco was too close to cumming and he didn't want to cum just yet but it felt so good. Harry however, made the choice for Draco by removing his mouth with a pop and kissing the tip said, “Don't worry love, I'll make you cum, just not yet.” Draco just whimpered his reply.
