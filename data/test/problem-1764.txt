“I’ll ring my aunt and Ley.” He told Neville when he kindly offered to go with him, though Hal knew he was looking forward to desert, which hadn’t arrived yet, the way he’d restrained himself in Honeydukes earlier. “Thanks, though. I’ll see you guys later.”
“Get some rest.” She said with a long suffering sigh.
it with stupid Lockhart and his stupid books and his stupid re-enactments. One day he would snap, and he would
He wasn’t sure how Anthony’s family would receive him, but he figured he could at least have a rest stop there, get something to eat if they felt generous enough, renew his charms, maybe use their Floo to book a room somewhere. He wasn’t expecting them to let him stay with them for the next three weeks before term started, even if Anthony himself had clearly wanted to be supportive, it was a lot to ask. But he was hoping he’d find at least a little kindness there, before he was on his way. Anthony’s parents seemed alright, every time he’d talked about them.
And then they’re wondering who Ley is and if he’s also “super cute and, I hear, super rich as well” and Draco turns around:
“For the sensibility of retreating, acting wisely and fast in a time-sensitive situation and recognising that asking for help isn’t a sign of failure, twenty points to Draco Malfoy.”
“Thanks.” Draco finally looked up to meet his eyes, and gave him a faint smile. Emboldened, or maybe just wanting to shift the attention from him, he asked: “What about you?”
“Looks that way.” Hal replied, blinking a few times. “Is everyone okay?”
“Yeah.” Sirius laughed. He had a fond, wistful look on his face a second later as he added: “We called ourselves the Marauders.”
Hermione let out a small huff of frustration.
Ron grabbed him in an awkward one-arm hug. “She’ll be okay.” He said in a tone that clearly told he was also trying to convince himself. “She’ll be okay.”
“Mate…” Ron tried to placate him again.
“Oh.”
“Yeah.” Ron snorted. “You were too busy lecturing Parvati about how nobody knows what a Boggart looks like when they’re alone.”
Hal rolled his eyes, but he let Sirius mess up his hair again and give him a warm hug.
He wasn’t going to give Flint the satisfaction of looking scared or asking him to step back. He was still expecting to get punched, but Flint leaned right into Draco’s personal space, and his voice dropped to a conspiratorial tone.
“Thanks?” Hal tried to sound grateful rather than highly suspicious, even if he wanted to shove the thing back at the teacher and say
“Darling, darling. Shh, you’re fine, everything’s fine.” His aunt tried to appease him, taking her seat next to him again and making him stay still with a hand on his chest, another disappearing in his mop of dark hair.
“Well.” Hermione winced. “They obviously know something happened to me, the school had to warn them. But they downplayed it, I think. They didn’t want all the parents rushing in, so they said it was temporary and they had an antidote coming and not to worry, basically. I think they might have said we had to be in a sort of quarantine, to justify why they couldn’t come and see us. I’m not sure what they would have done if the mandrakes hadn’t worked out, they must have been pretty confident, though I suppose maybe it was best not to alarm them before they tried. So yeah.” She sighed. “They basically think I had a bad bout of… chickenpox, or something. They’re relieved I’m okay now, but I don’t think they were ever overly worried.”
“Quite right, Mister Malfoy.” Lupin nodded approvingly.
“Hermione.”
“You don’t have to do anything with this, just keep it, just in case… If something happens to us, we want the baby’s godfather to take care of them, but we don’t know how that’s going to go, he’s not related by blood, and something might happen to him too, and… This is a precaution, we just, we don’t want to leave our child with no plan B. Or, C. Sirius is already plan B, of course plan A is not for anything to happen to us and raising our child, but… Anyway I digress. There are details for a Mu-... a, a bank account in one of your banks, that would be for you, if, if… in case that’s where they grow up. Otherwise, there is a letter in there, for them. There is a key to our bank vault for the rest of our savings on the Wizard side. And a… photo. It’s, it’s a magical photo, so. Err. Just, keep it? And if they’re with you, please give them the box. When they turn eleven.”
them. Like you said, he can smell them. They need to know where to expect him.”
The bird had landed on his arm – the one not wrapped around Draco’s waist – and was gently tugging forward.
“Wow.” Hal held up his hands. “How did we get there?”
Hal frowned. He could almost her Hermione’s voice telling him to stop riling up dangerous murderous people who had already announced they wanted to kill him, but on the other hand, how could it possibly make it worse?
seemed exoneration enough, it was unthinkable for a follower of the Dark Lord to imagine that a half-giant could be related to the great Slytherin.
“Unless Hogwarts is starting a new tradition, I don’t think the likelihood of encountering a troll two years in a row is very high.” Hal argued.
I obviously completely invented the process and legalities around transitioning in the magical world to suit my plot. Hope it doesn't cause anyone offense and is close enough to the conflicts real people have to deal with.
“Okay.” Hal frowned. “But then it was safe, and it became a lot easier to take it from
It was true, though he decided not to mention he’d never felt pain like he felt through his scar at the time. The headache was gone now, there was no need to worry her even more.
“Are you kidding.” Anthony deadpanned. “That’s the best part.”
“We could get expelled!” Hermione added, which sounded a lot more significant to her.
“Hal said you outgrew yours.” He explained, clearly nervously waiting to see whether or not Ley would like and accept the gift.
Hal had a weak laugh, and turning around to get a good look at him now their respective guardians weren’t in his line of sight, Draco realised he really did. He sat up for their friends, but he was pale, his eyes sunken and several bruises visible (Pomfrey always said magic wasn’t the best solution for bruises, the body did a perfectly nice job on its own, and it was better to leave them as an indicator of natural healing, which was just as important as spells and potions) and an angry red stripe along his neck from Lockhart’s rope.
“Picked up a stray.” Hal announced himself and Draco. “Hope you don’t mind.”
He proceeded to muttering about the wands he had sold James Potter and Lily Evans when they were children, sometimes so barely audible that Hal decided to assume he was mostly talking to himself, rather than try to follow the details – he didn’t think knowing what core his father’s wand had had would really be important, anyway.
She looked down at the last beetle Hal had transfigured taking a little spin before it reverted back to its mineral state, and then at Hal thoughtfully. Draco didn’t think they had done anything wrong, it was pretty harmless magic though transfiguration always came with a warning, but Hal did that innocent smile and wide eyes thing that fooled exactly no one but still made people go soft, and in the end she shook her head.
“Maybe.” Hermione explained, taking a breath. “If Slytherin was you ancestor, both yours and… You-Know-Who’s – and I know, those are two massively hypothetical
, mate, are bloody good. You could be as good as Krum.”
“You’re right, sir.” He repeated forcibly.
“She’s got a point.” Draco piped up. “I think Dumbledore would probably let other staff use the school for something important, but it’s more likely to be his.”
“I’d deny it.” She snapped. “You can’t use it against me.”
Pan raised an eyebrow at him. “Do you watch each other naked a lot?” He argued.
She walked away, and Hal wanted to tell her not to go, but Nils’ other hand was suddenly on his hip, and he couldn’t say a word. The boy kissed him again, soft but insistent, and Hal could feel the tip of his tongue this time. He drew back again, smiling, lovely as anything.
’d the parchment, pressed his fists to his closed eyes and refrained from screaming. After a few steadying breaths, he thought maybe he should – find Hermione, that is.
“I know the end of the school year was hard on you.” His mother said, smiling still, but with sadness and a lingering fear in her eyes.
She raised a brow. “From the dog?”
made the front page, but he was sharing it with one Sirius Black, who hadn’t been off it since he’d broken out, seeing as the Ministry was still nowhere nearer catching him, and Hal’s eyes latched onto it as soon as it landed in front of him. He put a finger on it, just as Draco’s hand twitched to snatch it out of his sight – it was too late.
“It’s his last year, so he wants to make it count.”
“I didn’t write a book, though.” Hal added to defuse the situation. “I’m obviously not nearly as cool as Newt Scamander.”
Hal could only blink, blinded by the flashes and completely unprepared for this turn of events. Fortunately, maybe, Lockhart did not seem to notice or care about his reaction, because he just blabbered on.
It only got worse when Hermione whispered ‘Oh, Ginny…’, having more of a chance than Hal did to look at their surroundings and guessing who the most mortified of onlookers looked to be. Hal only turned his head – away from staring in frozen horror at the creature pinning him to the floor – in time to see her red hair bounce behind her as she fled the scene.
“Relax.” He told her for the fifth time, feeling his voice bordering on hysterical.
That was so much worse. Draco couldn’t completely grasp what had just happened, but he thought the word was
, because his mother had forgotten and made other plans he’d had no choice but to tag along for. Hal and his cousin had organised a combined party mid-July, with common and new friends, and Draco had been so excited to go, until suddenly he wasn’t going.
On one such occasion, Hal actually met the man’s eyes just as he was looking his way, and a blinding burst of pain shot through his head – through his scar, more specifically. He gasped and clutched the side of his head, squeezing his eyes shut as if that would help it go away. It didn’t.
“It’s reaaaadyyyy!” Ley’s cheerful call sounded from downstairs.
school in the whole of the UK for kids aged 11 to 18.
him, you know? I wonder if he like, remembers his face? Like obviously not clearly or anything but somewhere in his deep memories.”
“I remember Lily liked potions.” Petunia smiled, echoing the thought.
“Werewolves are obviously extremely dangerous to humans, on a full moon.” Hermione explained. “But I’ve read they don’t present a danger to animals. It even helps them to retain a bit more of their consciousness, to be with animals, that’s why werewolves usually live in packs – keeps them sane. Other animals won’t have quite the same effect, but they help. So maybe they wanted to help.”
They had fun evenings with Dean and Seamus in the common room and dorm as well, but the two had become fast friends, and spent all of their time together, to the point that their friendship became a little exclusive, with a lot of private jokes. Hal knew how it had felt to the rest of their friends, now, when he and Ley got going.
fitted with a new dress, Pan knew he had to talk to his parents.
“You’d be safe, Longbottom.” Blaise said drily.
“Crying shame, that.” Anthony sighed. “You would have done so well.”
It was a little of an exaggeration when it came to Hufflepuff, where he was friendly as best with a couple of them, and probably even more when it came to Slytherin although he could distantly count Pan and Blaise. He wasn’t sure what to make of either of them yet, if he was honest. But anyway, the kid didn’t need to know that.
“What?” Several voices rose.
“But what if something
“Okay, now it’s creepy.” Hal said, but he was still laughing, and Draco was irrationally pleased to see he felt better.
“She approached him, apparently.” His aunt replied. “On Valentine’s day, she gave him a card. They talked, he invited her to the cinema, then they seemed to both decide it had been a date.”
“I’m not the only one people think could be the stupid Heir.” Hal muttered.
“Yes.” Black asserted. “He-”
“So?” She raised an eyebrow to show she was not impressed.
“I love it.” He beamed with a satisfied sigh, once they had successfully plated a vegetable stew and nice grilled chicken strips. “It’s like Potions, but without Snape on your back, and you get to eat the results.”
“We must stay in this room until further notice.” He told the assembled audience. “Nobody is allowed to get out to the corridors. We stay in, keep the door shut, and stay quiet.”
“The voice?” He asked. When Hal looked up and frowned, he added: “Ron told me you thought you heard a voice.”
“Oh, Hal makes sense.” She whispered to herself, and blushed when she saw his raised eyebrow. “Sorry, I heard your brother call you that and I wondered what it was short for.”
McGonagall’s remained speechless for a few moments, blinking helplessly, before she gathered herself.
Hal felt his throat close up. “What will happen to them?” He asked in a small voice.
“Guard dogs.” Anthony nodded thoughtfully, putting on a serious face – it didn’t suit him. “Hmm.”
“We can make this much worse for you.” Flint carried on and threatened. “What’s a little money to you? You wouldn’t want us to find your friends in our way, would you?”
Madam Pomfrey rushed to his side to examine his arm, casting a few other charms over it – cleaning and diagnosis, Draco guessed – and turning it this way and other.
“He’ll know where to find us if he isn’t already there.” Hermione agreed.
Hal realised that the man was scared. Whoever the voice belonged to, wherever it came from, that was who was pulling the strings, and Quirrell was scared of them. It gave him the nerve to simply give the man an unimpressed look.
Severus swore under his breath. “Who’s in there?” He asked next.
, in front of Hal!’, though he suspected he only succeeded in appearing demented.
From the look on Percy’s face, he didn’t know whether he was joking or not. From the snorts from his three brothers sitting nearby, they did.
It hadn’t been Oliver’s opinion, at all, and he’d been working them ragged in practice, which hadn’t helped, but Hal was regaining confidence that he was a good Seeker, and there wasn’t much else he could have done in this particular game.
“If fucking Lockhart hadn’t done that…” Anthony started.
Next to him, Hal had a sort of shocked huff, but he sounded perfectly casual as he spoke next.
“I’m transgender.”
Parkinson Hall was – in Draco’s humble opinion – a monstrosity. The house itself had originally been a grand sixteenth century mansion, probably quite alluring at the time, but each subsequent generation had made alterations, most of them ill-advised, and the result five hundred years or so later was something in very poor taste, both inside and outside. The less that was said about the topiaries, the better.
*             *
He clearly had already thought this through.
“Because I’m a boy.”
With combined efforts, they both rather pathetically got to their feet, and Draco took in their surroundings, growing paler again. He looked positively ghostly by the time his eyes landed on Hal, and the blood covering him.
didn’t get themselves killed.
He peered behind his aunt, and could only see an empty bed through the gap in the curtains, so Ron must have gone.
Was Draco… like him?
“Sure.” Anthony said softly after a moment.
“So should she be.” McGonagall retorted sharply. “You were very reckless, Mister Potter. You are lucky neither you nor any of your friends were more seriously hurt.”
“Thanks, guys.” Hal told them both.
This one's a longer one! Some more exposition, and then some of the plot kicks off. Some headcannons/liberties about magic and spells along the way.
“At that point, they were going to close the school.” Blaise carried on. “But a student apparently caught the culprit, who was letting a monster loose in the school, and so it stopped.”
The mother pulled a
“What did I do to Mister Potter this time?” He asked with a hint of sarcasm.
“You’re the Boy-Who-Lived, mate.” Ron pointed out. “You’re always going to be.”
An hour in, Ley had broken a knife trying to cut into a swede, Hal was picking lentils off the floor (and from his hair, somehow), the kitchen smelt of burnt potato and there were smears of tomato purée all over the wall behind the cooker.
“Hal.” Draco grabbed his arm urgently.
you.” Draco retorted.
Petunia might have gotten into the habit of berating Hal and Ley for expressing obvious displeasure every time Marge came to visit, but it did not mean she enjoyed her sister-in-law’s presence in her home any more than they did. She would much rather have, that evening, spend a nice evening with her boys as they told her all about their adventures playing with a dog in the park and hunting for potion ingredients. (Even though Hal wasn’t to do magic over the holidays, he’d argued potions did not count as you didn’t need your wand. It was like cooking, he assured.)
Hal had spoken to Sirius, briefly. His godfather was being questioned at the DMLE, ‘just a precaution’ apparently, but he'd sneaked his his mirror and had managed to quickly contact Hal when he’d been allowed to use the toilet.
Anthony had drawn Hermione, and he got her a set of books that two seven-year Ravenclaw girls had created, called
“I missed you too.” Draco smiled easily – because things always came so easily, with Hal, and it was never weird. Draco didn’t want to make it weird, even if he has had a crush on him.
“I don’t know.” Hermione sighed in frustration. “But they all say he’s been weird.”
“How’s is he?” He asked, clearly expecting the news was unlikely to be good.
“So, hum.” He stopped at a reasonable distance, as they all looked to varying degrees like their would very much reach out and touch him if they could. “What would you like me to…”
He gave a wide twirl of his wand, and bir… bats, actually, flew out and around the room. A few students shrieked, but the little creatures were quite harmless and most of them settled somewhere in the ceiling almost immediately, as Lockhart started miming wading through the jungle.
“Ron…”
As she approached, Hal was alarmed to find he wasn’t feeling any more energetic than when he’d first woken up. He tried to bat her away, his arm moving slowly and only meeting air in a pathetic attempt at anything defensive. He couldn’t do anything when she reached him and helped him up onto unsteady feet.
I found no report of the Goldstein names so I invented them!
“Junkies, that’s what they were.”
“First years too, right?” The redhead asked. “I’m Ron.”
, but he supposed he had to take the victory of none of them being in trouble, and earning their Houses points instead. It did say a lot however, in this opinion, about this school’s take on health and safety and child endangerment.
“Urgh.” Pan replied.
“No, Hogsmead is a strictly Wizarding village.” One of the Aurors answered. “It is possible the suspect avoided using her wand on purpose, but that would imply a degree of premeditation that does not match Mister Black’s account of the attack. Resorting to physical means is very rare for experienced wizards and witches. We think she might be a Squib.”
Once Hal was able to catch a glimpse of him, he knew what Fred meant. Hollyhock looked like someone had taken a Michelangelo marble and given it life. His smile was sincere, he didn’t sneer like the rest of his team – he even exchanged a few words with Hal as they crossed path in-between their respective practices, asking how he felt about the season.
The girl behind the desk gave him a pinched smile – he knew his tone was dry and entitled, maybe he’d need to work on that, but he couldn’t give a toss right now, he was not exactly having a good day – and looked at the address.
“Use it wisely.” Fred winked.
The pain did fade after a couple of minutes, though he was left feeling nauseous. And a little paranoid – after Snape, it was a bit much to think
Harry nodded slowly, still wary about it all. And then he remembered something strange.
“How long’s it supposed to last again?” Harry asked, positive he'd asked the question before but couldn't remember the answer for the life of him.
“Well, I don’t blame them, to be perfectly honest,” Draco replied.
“I like you the best, Ginny, you know that,” Luna said serenely, smiling at her.
Harry looked away, afraid he was going to start crying. Hermione must have sensed this, because she gripped his arm tighter.
Draco stiffened just a bit. “What about it?”
Draco and Harry waited in tense silence as they heard footsteps retreating and the unmistakable sound of a door closing shut. Draco sighed and deflated against Harry’s chest. Harry groaned tiredly, closing his eyes again as he rested his head back on the pillow.
“Say goodbye,” said Ginny cheerfully, and began pouring out the contents into the toilet.
Pansy and Patil had recently struck up an unlikely friendship, sparked by their mutual adoration for certain magical creatures.
“I know. I was four years behind you two. Both of you were common gossip even among us underclassmen.”
Draco decided that he would appeal to Granger and Weasley first and see if they could convince Potter to stay longer. If that failed, he’d go to Scarlett.
Draco’s confusion seemed to amplify Potter’s own.
“For their sake, I hope not.”
“Yes, of course,” Kathy smiled. “For those of you who weren’t here, or who don’t remember, it’s called the four-seven-eight breathing exercise. Follow along if you want.”
“Nothing. Don’t worry about it,” Leonel said, a slight smile on his face. “See you later, Healer.”
“’What’s up’ is that I’m still your superior, Leo, and I can’t allow you to speak to me that way,” Draco told him with no real anger.
“I think you know what kind,” Malfoy said, actually sounding a bit sorry, “And I wouldn’t be asking if I really didn’t need to know in order to treat you.”
“Do they hurt?”
Draco hoped and prayed that his surprise (and delight) wasn’t too obvious on his face, but he knew very well that he was flushing given the way his temperature had suddenly gone up at least ten degrees.
“Oh,” he said, and reached out to wipe them away.
had revealed that it was an interesting combination of poisons that was causing Douglas’ condition. Ira being the innovative Potions expert that they were, Draco guessed that they would have some idea of how to counteract the effect the combination was having on the man.
He entered Draco easily, but Draco still winced as Harry’s cock pushed into his arsehole. He relaxed as Harry pulled back slowly; Draco mourned the fact that he couldn’t see Harry’s face as he did so. His head was bowed, looking down and focusing on what he was doing, his chest rising and falling lightly. Draco was about to ask what was wrong when Harry thrust into Draco again, harder and faster than the first. This time, Draco couldn’t contain the low moan and it escaped, deafening in an otherwise silent room.
Simply admitting it in his head was difficult. Draco'd been trying to repress most of his memories of Hogwarts, several of them having to do with Potter and his pathetic obsession with him, just because it was easier that way. And he was doing a fine job of it too, until just a few days ago.
One of the Healers, a tall, lanky individual, shook their hair from their face and exhaled. There was a small shiny badge on the front of their robes, which read 'Ira White - they/them.'
“Hey, Gin.”
“Hm,” Draco said, not knowing how to reply.
Harry laughed and took Draco’s hand. “Come on.”
When Harry and Draco came in through the Floo, Ron’s eyes nearly popped out his head. Hermione dropped her spoon. Her brown eyes jumped from Harry, to Draco, to Draco’s (Harry’s) jumper and jeans, and back to Harry.
“I’m scared, I guess? I don’t really know what happens next, I mean, he’s told me he doesn’t like one-offs, but still. He basically spent over a year rejecting me, so what if he just changes his mind again? And never mind he’s the first person I’ve shagged in years – like, actual years, Gin.”
Ginny flushed and mumbled something to her girlfriend under her breath; Harry wondered. He tried to remember if he’d ever made her that flustered (other than when she was eleven years old). Probably not.
“Draco, that was – you’re,” Harry placed a sloppy kiss on Draco’s forehead, “Amazing. Beautiful.”
Malfoy turned round to look at him.
It's suddenly occurred to me that many fic writers keep to a regular posting schedule and now I feel bad about posting so infrequently and sporadically. Not saying I'm going to change anything, but I want to say thank you thank you thank you for still reading after all this time. I really don't deserve it.
Draco knew this, but he didn’t want to admit it. Still, he sighed and avoided looking right at Leo.
“I’m glad.”
Harry nodded and beamed. “One more for good luck.”
“Now that you mention it, we didn’t get to fuck yesterday,” Harry murmured and sucked on Draco’s soft skin.
“I understand, love,” he said quietly.
Harry rubbed at his eyes. Draco smoothed away the hair from Harry’s damp forehead, his chest tight with anxiety.
She led him to his bed and sat themselves down, all without letting go of his hand.
“Draco...”
And with horror, Draco realized that Potter’s eyes were wet. He froze and stared wide-eyed at him, too shocked to do anything else.
“Ah, right,” said Harry. He passed Ginny’s latte over to her and took his own, holding it in his hands as he tried to figure out the best course of action. “I, er…”
A knock at the door brought their attention to Leonel, who stepped inside, a grim look on his handsome face. He didn’t look at the parchment in his hands before he spoke, choosing instead to meet Granger’s and Weasley’s worried eyes.
“Yeah,” Harry gasped, “Yes.”
“It never even occurred to me that it was something out of the ordinary - being attracted to blokes, I mean. It was just, I was attracted to women and sure, I’d get the same feelings for men but I just brushed it off.”
Draco swallowed thickly, his gaze on his lap again.
Harry simply gasped in response. Draco’s fingers dug into Harry, and he thrusted harder, finally getting what his body had yearned for.
“I’m surprised you haven’t been assigned to the case.”
“’Everything’s a lot,’” Draco announced to the air. The alcohol was certainly taking an effect. “Wise words by Potter, savior of the wizarding world. Really, your wisdom is unrivaled.”
“Potter, if you don’t talk to me, I can’t help you,” Draco said in a quiet voice.
“I’ll be returning to Wales at the end of the month,” Blaise put in. His hooded eyes studied his girlfriend. “I’m assuming you won’t be back in New Zealand by then.”
“Someone might say the same about us,” Harry pointed out.
“Leave it,” Draco huffed, only blushing further.
“Since we started spending more time with him,” Hermione said. At Harry’s bewildered face, she elaborated. “When we go out with Ginny and Blaise, when they’re in town, anyway, Draco’s also there sometimes.”
Harry scoffed. “Whatever.”
Draco fought the smile that threatened to burst from his face and chastised himself – what was he, a third year? He distractedly watched Harry give the hostess his name and followed as she led them to their table. They sat down, and the hostess left.
"Thanks," said Draco quietly. He followed Potter into the room and shut the door behind him. He felt awkward, off-balance. He'd never been inside Potter’s dormitory before, and he'd yelled at him during their last conversation. "I wanted to apologize for everything I said in the bathroom. And in my dorm. It wasn't fair to you, and I'm sorry."
“I’m not – not weak, Draco.”
didn’t like. He still looked at Draco with that strange, worried, confused expression, and he still tried to get Draco to talk to him. And really, Potter should feel lucky that he’d gotten any information out of Draco at all. It was no easy feat – Pansy and Astoria could attest to that.
“About what?” Draco asked, trying to keep his voice steady.
Over the past month that she’d been living with him, Harry had taught Ginny how to order take-out from small Muggle restaurants. She had become quite proficient at it already, though it still took her a bit longer than normal to count out the change.
“Doesn’t make it any less true,” Potter began saying before going, “Malfoy?”
Harry was sat on Johnny's couch, having been waiting for him to return from his dealer. Johnny had just come back a few moments earlier, shrugging off his heavy jacket and joining Harry on the couch.
of the Floo going.
"You keep telling yourself that," Draco said smugly, but then grew serious. "Was it alright, though? I know I said we'd take it slow…"
Sober Harry might’ve gotten mad, but drunk Harry laughed instead. “It’s not oversharing, you prat, it’s literally group. You’re meant to share.”
Harry guzzled it down, not having realized just how thirsty he was, the cool water soothing his parched throat. He saw Draco hesitating in front of him, and Harry set the glass down on the table, now half-empty.
He couldn’t; he couldn’t hear any justification for the ugly mark on his arm that represented death and torture and prejudice and hate and the dozens of other horrible concepts it was linked to.
“On your back,” Harry told him, and Draco obeyed, switching spots with Harry and drawing his legs up.
“Morning,” Harry returned and walked inside, though his brows were furrowed. “Did I wake you?”
Mildly intrigued, Draco watched the back of Potter’s head for a good minute before turning his attention to his Transfiguration professor.
But then Leonel’s Patronus bounded in and said in his voice, “Come to Mr. Potter’s room immediately.”
“…Potter and Malfoy. Your potions are due in 90 minutes. Good luck!”
“Fine, yes. I’ve been doing better,” Draco huffed. “Thanks for noticing.”
“They do, don’t they?” Samuel mused.
“You’re getting way too sappy on me, Potter,” Draco told him even as his cheeks flushed.
He climbed back into bed and put his hands over his face. Draco kept talking.
“He proposed to Hermione – she said yes!”
how good Draco’s fingers felt in him and finally, he felt loose and open enough for what he
“Wanna talk about it?”
“You did,” Potter said, giving a strange sort of smile. “See you around, Malfoy.”
and improved.”
He was much thinner than Harry was, and certainly not as muscular. His pale skin contrasted with Harry’s, and the scars from that fight in the bathroom stood out, slightly raised. But worst of all was the Dark Mark. Even though Harry had seen it earlier today, now it was out in the open with no chance of hiding it.
Harry bit his lip. “Do you want to finish the game?”
Ginny let out a loud laugh. “How scandalous!”
Draco’s eyes were fixed on Kathy. “Thank you.”
Potter’s brows drew together in concern, and Draco’s heart ached. “What happened last night?”
Astoria opened her mouth, but Draco spoke before she had the chance.
He was adorable.
“Then what is it?”
But before he could go any further with a messy explanation, Cait and Malfoy came stumbling forward. Cait had an arm around Malfoy’s body – Harry thought that she must’ve been aiming for his shoulders but she was too short to reach them. But what really grabbed Harry’s attention was the fact that there was a smile on Malfoy’s face. An actual smile.
Confrontation really didn’t work well with Draco. It just made him irritable (or rather, more irritable than usual) and uncomfortable. His heart thudded as he gathered the nerve to speak.
“Alright.”
Draco scoffed. “Hello, Potter, I know I’m not obligated to care for you anymore but here I am anyway? Oh, and I know you think I hate you and perhaps you hate me all over again too, but the truth is I’ve just fancied you since I was a teenager and still do today which is fucked up in several ways.”
Their faces were
“Yes, thanks. Sit down, you two. Molly’s made enough food to feed an army.”
Harry nodded. He heard Hermione mutter the Patronus charm and felt the unmistakable warmth appear and disappear. They were only waiting a few minutes before there was a soft knock at the door.
“Sorry.” Draco felt warmth reach his cheeks. “It’s been a long week.”
“I can’t
“Ready?”
He thought, then said truthfully, "I mean, I miss it sometimes. But sure, it's great."
Harry nodded, mortified, and walked out the room with Malfoy at his heels.
“G’night, Draco,” he mumbled.
“Good,” Draco said. Harry glanced at him, who matched his gaze.
"I didn't have to be such a prat to you though. You were just trying to help."
Draco cursed under his breath, releasing the bottom edge of his shirt and walking to the front of his closet. He unbuttoned the shirt and let it drop to the ground before grabbing his pajamas and putting them on. They were looser on his body and allowed him the peace of mind that his school uniform couldn’t afford him.
beautiful.”
He laid flat on his back again and let out a loud sigh.
“Really.”
God, if only it was that simple.
Harry wondered if anyone who’d ever told themselves ‘just this once’ had actually done it just the once.
. The photographs in the paper had hinted at the fact that he’d looked better, but it was nothing compared to seeing him in person. Potter’s skin had a healthy glow to it – he no longer looked so sickly, and though he still bore a beard, it was neat and complemented his face rather than distracted from it. He could admittedly still stand to gain a few pounds, but his form was still a far cry from what he’d looked like a year ago, haggard and wasted.
"Of course I am, Harry," Draco said, molding his voice into the chripy yet earnest voice that was Kathy's. "I'd like you to tell me what's wrong."
“I’m sorry, Harry,” said Draco, “But this is something I won’t change my mind about.”
Harry smirked. He took his glasses off and placed them and his wand on the bedside table behind the curtain. Harry was always handsome, that was undeniable, but without those glasses obscuring his face…
“Welcome,” said a voice, and Harry jumped.
He led them to his office, opening the door and allowing Granger and Weasley to enter and sit down first.
“Hm,” said Wolff, writing something in her notes. “Was it difficult to have Healer Malfoy as your Healer these past two weeks? Considering your history…”
“Hmph,” said Ginny, and she dumped them down the toilet.
“Aren’t I always?”
She slinked away.
Potter grinned. “I can accept that.”
Harry’s hand moved up to caress Draco’s face gently. Draco closed his eyes at the touch, and a second later, Harry’s warm lips were on his own. Draco kissed back though his chest was heavy and he couldn’t get the image of Harry’s dejected face out of his head.
“I don’t know about nice,” Leo put in. “Definitely interesting. I just don’t think he ever warmed up to me the way he did to you two.”
"Draco," said Harry, his heart falling, but Draco kept going.
Draco gave a weak chuckle. “I suppose.”
it felt.
“Who’s ‘our’?”
“I should really splash this on you,” said Ginny, though she didn’t actually sound upset. “December 2003. Come to think of it, our split-versary is coming up soon. Three beautiful years without you.”
Draco’s mind wandered to the inevitable: what was this? They were friends, yes, but that was their label before they began all
“Good evening, gentlemen. Have you ever dined with us before?” Harry shook his head, and Malfoy nodded. “Lovely. My name is Natasha, and I’ll be your server tonight. Could I start you two off with something to drink?”
“What?” Draco asked defensively.
“Er…what do you think?”
Draco felt lightheaded as he sat there, his stomach aching and hands shaking. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been there at this point, but he didn’t want to come out for fear of running into Potter. He didn’t understand it, but Potter had an uncanny ability to find Draco no matter where he was, and he wouldn’t be surprised if he was standing outside the loo doors at that very moment. In fact, Draco had half-expected Potter to come pounding on the stall door within minutes of Draco arriving himself.
He pulled off his own school jumper, revealing the white button-up underneath. Harry’s hands reached for the buttons and began undoing them as quickly as he could. Draco pulled it off when Harry finished, suddenly feeling very self-conscious.
“You’ve changed it,” Draco said suddenly, making Harry jump.
“They sound really special.”
Pansy exhaled, and they watched the smoke dissipate in the crisp air.
“That was by far the most humiliating experience of my life.”
“Oh, come on,” Harry said, his grin slipping a little. He nudged Draco again. “You can’t blame me. I was new to the Wizarding world, and when I met you, you made me feel so clueless, and you insulted my first friend! I didn’t have a great first impression.”
Hermione flew over to the bed and hugged him tightly, her bushy hair in his face.
“What, I’m bent too, aren’t I?”
“Ron! That’s amazing!”
“Could you classify those potions and take a look at those ingredients? See if anything reacted badly with another?”
“Yeah, alright,
He felt like crying when Harry’s lips pressed onto his own. Draco’s face burned as he opened his mouth and Harry did the same. They kissed slowly, carefully, like they were testing the waters. Uncharted territory. Harry’s lips were slightly chapped but still so soft, so perfect. He could get lost kissing Harry like this.
“Fair enough.”
“War, yes,” Leonel finished for him. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to drudge up such an uncomfortable subject.”
Daphne Greengrass sat down next to Pansy and smoothed her hair down.
Draco had woken up, taken a shower, and eaten breakfast before Flooing to work. He’d looked over paperwork that had come in overnight and made his rounds. He spoke to Leo, about both work and personal matters. They were doing well again, having put the past behind them. Leo had stopped making advances, finally resigned to the fact that Draco really was over him. He chatted with Betty, now a full-fledged Healer. She’d passed her exams with flying colors and was doing extremely well, somehow now more determined than ever. And he had coffee with Ira, who still managed to fit time in their busy schedule to listen to Draco’s many lamentations, big and small.
He had no-one to give the third-, fifth- and seventh-year books to, but he supposed he could keep the third-year ones for the following year, if they were still on the list. The third pile, with fifth and seventh, he wasn’t sure what to do with yet. Which was why he thought Mr Weasley looked more touched than it warranted, when Hal gave him the books. Really, he was doing him a favour, taking them off his arms.
Remus – Professor Lupin – was standing near the door, and took a few cautious steps towards him.
Binns had told them a little more, reluctantly, about the legend of the Chamber of Secrets, when Hermione had brazenly asked. Rumours had then started spreading like wildfire, and everyone was whispering suggestions about who the Heir of Slytherin could be. Hal seemed to be a strong contender, on grounds obscure to him, to his mounting frustration.
“Harry Potter?”
“A word with Millicent, if I may.”
– as a reference to the fact that he was a millionaire apparently – which had been vetoed too for being terrible puns. They had argued for days, and it was only after Christmas that they’d settled, after reading through the illustrated hardback edition of
They moved through the rooms easily once more, and by the time Severus had levitated them through the hatch, Albus was casually waiting for them.
“Oh my god!” Anthony squealed as he barged into the compartment, having just found them. “Did you get a cat for Christmas?”
spell she had learned the day before and the corridors were starting to look familiar again.)
“Do you think Flint is gay?” Hal asked his friends over breakfast one morning –
“Do you want to show me?” Sev asked softly.
, to treat you-” as they reached the table, he snapped his fingers at a man Hal realised was a photographer. “-to my
“I would advise coming our to your friends as well.” Sev added. “Obviously you have told Draco…”
In the meantime, it was a good five-hour drive without stopping, so they’d been on the road all day – which was also cause for great enthusiasm. They had stocked up on sweets, games and burned CDs for the journey, and Petunia really couldn’t fathom what seemed so entertaining about being stuck in a car on the motorway for several hours, but she supposed it was a bit different, being the driver. And if they were happy, she was happy.
She looked down, almost as if to make amends.
“What are
Draco couldn’t help but snort, albeit joylessly. “Fuck off, Flint.” He said instead.
“Prison.” Draco replied quietly.
He had mentioned the bizarre conversation and subsequent invitation to his friends.
guide book out of her bag and handed it out to him, quickly followed by a pen.
1.	Okay so Draco’s not very kind to Hagrid, but come on, he is a bit of an idiot when it comes to magical creatures.
I decided Anthony had a sister because it felt weird that most characters are single children, and suddenly Ron has 6 siblings. I don’t know if it’s because JKR did not see the need to expand family trees, or that would have been too many characters, but just a mention wouldn’t have done any harm? Yet to my knowledge the wide majority or Harry’s generation, at least the ones that we get to know, don’t seem to have large families. I can understand why a lot of parents would be cautious during the first War and avoid having too many kids (apart from the Weasleys apparently), but surely for example for Pureblood families who are all about carrying on their precious lines, having more than one child would be the sensible thing to do? Guess a lot of them were too busy being Death Eaters. Anyhow! Anthony has a sister and I made her much younger so she won’t be coming to Hogwarts anytime soon.
“Can we take a picture!” Louise screamed, louder than she had excepted going by how she then clasped both hands over her mouth.
Hal turned a curious gaze on him.
“Hm?” She hummed airily, still focused on her book.
“I have your map.” Hal said.
“Excusez-moi.” He saw them startle, and they both looked at him like deer caught in headlights. “C’est un peu gênant, votre conversation.” He told them with a tight smile. “Parce qu’on comprend, en fait.”
Neville seemed to fare decently well throughout the day, but Hal felt like he was sleepwalking into each hour. By the time their last class rolled around, he was all but dozing off at his desk.
“But he’s good.” Oliver carried on, oblivious of Hal’s discomfort at the memory. “So you watch out, alright?”
“Stop it.” Pan suddenly poked his arm.
“Totally deserved win, given how they played in the second half.” Ron argued.
“I won’t lie and say it’s not nice.” She admitted. “But I’m not into girls. I just hope we can be friends.”
“I am not telling Hal I’m in love with him.” Draco shook his head. “Not now, not in the foreseeable future. Please leave it.” He made a last bid when Pan opened his mouth again, trying to convey in one look that this was final.
Hal nodded, and willed his throat to unclench as he started talking.
“Oh, Hal, you can’t miss your train. How else are you going to get there?”
“God, Neville, I…” He didn’t know what to say to that. What did one say to that?
On the third day, he even accepted an invitation to come play games in the Slytherin common room, and he found himself having a lot of fun. They were drinking light sparkling wine that Daphne’s father had shipped her disguised as potion supplies – it wasn’t uncommon in Pureblood circle for parents to facilitate that, they had all been drinking low percentage alcohol since they were about eight – while alternating hilarious rounds of Guess Who with bits of parchment stuck to their foreheads and ludicrously competitive games of Exploding snap.
“Sev wouldn’t do that.” Draco defended.
I can’t remember in the series when Harry actually finds out about the prophecy, but I figured people must have known enough to understand that the Potters were targeted for a reason… so he knows the “power to vanquish the Dark Lord” part, but obviously the part about how “neither can live while the other survives” is not public knowledge.
He only realised the unintentional pun as it left his mouth, and bit his lip to stop himself from laughing and discrediting the whole thing.
Hal blinked again, coughed – it hurt like hell – and sat up with some difficulty.
“Hal!” Came a whisper to the side.
Dumbledore looked at him and nodded, before turning to Hal.
“Everyone okay?” He called out in the darkness.
He didn’t sleep for long, startled awake by a door banging loudly somewhere nearby maybe twenty minutes later. He’d dreamt of his family – his parents, both alive, his little sister just like he’d seen her in the mirror, except at one point she became his big sister, and then he realised she looked exactly like McGonagall and they found out she was their long-lost aunt. And then Draco was there, for no reason, telling him he should go to the shops.
“We just thought-”
“Hello, Mrs Malfoy.” He turned to Draco’s mother in the meantime. “It’s very nice to meet you.”
“I’m here about my friend.” He announced.
Draco met his eyes, and they both cracked up, only laughing briefly as Hermione smacked the back of Hal’s head.
After ten minutes, Draco (who looked like he had a wasp up his arse) left to look for her. When he didn’t come back after another ten, and Hermione hadn’t shown either, they started to worry. They waited another five minutes, before Neville went to see if he could find either of them.
“That’s where my godfather grew up.” Draco mentioned.
“I have magic?” Hal spoke after a moment of silence, bewildered. To Petunia’s surprise, he then turned to Ley, looking ecstatic. “I
“Potter.” He spat out. “Come to play hero? What does it take to be rid of you?”
He briefly glanced over to the other side of the room where Lockhart was gesticulating to the older students, most of them looking dismayed, and everyone heard the unspoken addition of
The old man considered him for a moment, and he was really starting to make him nervous when he finally spoke again.
“Halloween.” He mumbled.
“Is Esther magical?” Pan asked, hoping it wasn’t rude to ask.
Anthony turned back to Pan with a wide grin.
“He ran off towards the third floor.” Rolf added.
The conversation was interrupted as Snape returned with McGonagall, who took Hal back to Gryffindor Tower. She walked in determined silence on the way up, but kept him in front of the Fat Lady’s portrait for what felt like ages to lecture him at length when they got there; and she did deck twenty points from Gryffindor (ten for punching another student, ten for jinxing another student) and gave him a night’s detention, details to follow.
Sadly, it didn’t take. The woman pulled a chair up to his side, picked up a bowl and spoon and set out to feed him. Hal turned his head like a reluctant toddler.
“You still mad?” He asked him.
Also, in the book… Nothing the fuck happens for a while at this point?? The timeline is actually really confusing when reading recaps (sadly I don’t have the actual books with me to check if it’s clearer), because the next big event is Hermione’s attack, which in some summaries happens just before the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff game (?) and causes it (and every game after that) to be cancelled, but that fixture is at the start of March, and according to other sources Hermione and Penelope get petrified in *May* (followed by Fudge’s visit to Hagrid and Dumbledore’s removal)… Which makes more sense in terms of the timings, otherwise what, things are at a standstill for another three and a half months, with no further attacks? Students go home for Easter and then come back?
. It was only possible, however, if a registered and authorised guardian cast a specific spell to allow it – all magic within it would then not trigger the minor’s Trace, but it had a time and space limit on it, set by the caster. A sort of permission ring.
“Hang in there, Harry.” The man repeated.
now!” Hal barked, having had enough.
He set out to do just that, but he hadn’t counted on the fact that having remained shut for years, it was going to resist him. Next thing he knew, he had lost his grip on the stubborn handle, and he came crashing backwards into the bookcase. The rows of books rattled, and for a second Draco thought the whole thing was coming down on his head, until he realised the panel had simply moved a few inches towards him, revealing not the wall behind it, but the dark damp space of a room beyond.
Draco wasn’t sure he would be able to sleep, or eat for that matter, but he was willing to give it a try, if only for his mother’s sake.
“Draco. Hal has told me a lot about you.”
He didn’t get a chance to find out, as there was a shout behind them.
“No, it was alright actually.” Draco smiled. “I think he’ll be nicer. I was just thinking that Hal has already grown quite a bit since I first met him.”
And the man recognised him, too. Faced with the double front of status and celebrity, he fidgeted from one foot to the next and finally decided to turn around and politely interrupt the three other wizards’ conversation.
At least, as far as he’d come to understand, flying broomsticks were used to play sports, and not as a means of transportation, and the pointy hats were really only stout little caps with a pointy top that were mostly used for formal wear, but wands seemed to be an actual thing that everyone did magic with. Grown men and women waving a stick in the air looked ridiculous to Hal, but he supposed he’d have to get used to it.
She grabbed the two potions she had identified as the right one, and tucked one into Hal’s hand.
“They’re going to pin this on Hagrid again.” Hal guessed.
“I think I’ll take my chances with Quirrell rather than that dog.” Ron piped up.
“But what strong moment did I…” He started saying, thinking out loud, before snapping his mouth shut abruptly.
“I know.” Ron said sombrely.
Hermione had had what she deemed a perfectly normal and pleasant Christmas, and what Anthony deemed a very boring-sounding one. Every time she described something – the tree, the presents, the crackers, the pudding – he marvelled at how everything was so
Upon a warning look from his mother, however, Ley did not voice his obvious disappointment, and they said their goodbyes to their friends promising they’d meet up again soon enough.
Anthony gave him an encouraging look – so far, Pan had been all over trying to make his presence as helpful and the least disruptive possible, helping around the house and offering all kinds of ways to ‘compensate’ for his imposition, despite the Goldstein’s assurance that it was their pleasure, so Anthony thought that was a nice change.
“We’re having a family reunion of sorts.” He said. “The Court’s decision on whether to restore my assets to me is on the fifth of May, so whatever happens, we thought it might be good to discuss it between us remaining living Blacks. And it will be nice to catch up. Cissy’s invited us all to the Manor on the eighth, she got Draco a special dispensation to be allowed to go home for the weekend, and Andy and her family are coming over from France.”
“Yeah, you know him.” Pan smiled. “He’ll pretend he’s not interested and he’s only helped me because Draco asked him or something. But he cares in his own cold way.”
teacher would have it out for him personally, but he couldn’t help but think he’d been proven right once, even though the Potions master’s attitude towards him had minutely mellowed.
Draco could swear there was a moment of stunned silence as McGonagall lifted the Hat off his head, before the clapping started. His feet took him to the Ravenclaw table, a girl there – fifth year, maybe sixth – smiled at him and said “Welcome”, and he smiled back in a haze, not sure what, the actual fuck, had just happened.
“Oh, no, it’s okay. I have a kit, I’ll sort myself out. This does happen a lot, you know.”
Rolf murmured something about the dog that Draco didn’t quite catch.
“Sure.” He said.
“I think she said something about him rising again.” He added uncomfortably.
“He hurt you!” Hal shouted.
stirring something uncomfortable inside him, though he couldn’t put his finger on where he’d heard it before – and it was his turn.
“You’re already fast.” Oliver had said in a rare moment of unworried glee. “But on this as well, the other Seekers don’t stand a chance!”
“Yes.” Hal said.
Hermione pursed her lips, like she was trying not to beam, but Hal could take she was chuffed, and she gave in and broke into a laugh when he grabbed her for a one-armed hug.
“Oh thank God.” Petunia breathed. “Thank you.” She told the nurse.
“Hey.” He said more softly, putting a hand on Hal’s shoulder so he’d look up. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.”
Great, Draco thought as the group left, leaving him on the floor with his legs still locked together. Persecution, just how I wanted my school year to turn out. Sighing to himself, he pulled out his wand and cast the counter curse, then got up on wobbly legs. Several parts of his body were aching and stinging, but he didn’t think they’d done any serious damage.
“Let’s go back further.” Anthony pressed on methodically. “What happened before she ran off?”
“Ugh, it always smells here.” Hal commented. “Letter for your mom?”
“Okay, that sounds like a lot.” Hal breathed. He turned to Draco slightly helplessly. “Is that a lot?”
“Flint is related to the Blacks?” He asked coldly.
“Oh, what a relief.” Hermione sighed. “I don’t know
“He’s signing books!” He cried.
“Wise.” Draco huffed a laugh. “Alright, then. Take care of yourself for me, okay?”
“Oh my God.” Hermione gasped.
And yeah, that made sense, if he’d been around him for longer than two minutes, he’d have learnt a lot of ‘fun facts’ about dragons. Draco remembered him being
“Back there…” He said hesitantly. “Did you call me Dray?”
“I did.” The man did not deny it. Taking a breath, he explained himself further. “I did not think it would be a good idea to have Lord Voldemort appear in the classroom.”
“There you are!”
“How are you doing?” His aunt then asked.
“You should eat and drink something.” She advised. “And then more rest, natural rest would be best if you can manage to sleep.”
“Honestly, Petunia.” Marge said to her as if she’d had the poor taste to pick him out in a home furnishing store. “Are you sure he’s even British?”
“Sure.” Draco nodded. He had no idea if Severus knew anything at all about these things, but he certainly would be able to provide at least some moral support. He did feel very protective of his snakes. “Yeah, we can go talk to him when we’re back.”
When between a mouthful of eggs and a sip of her coffee, his mother suggested a trip to Diagon Alley to get
“Ah.” Hal chuckled, a little embarrassed and a little pleased. “You've heard about that?”
When the kitchen was clean, they went to sit in the front room, and Petunia handed Harry his letter. He looked a little puzzled, but he opened it without asking what it was, and read it quietly. Ley was fidgeting opposite him, but he stilled when he saw how serious Harry’s face had gone.
Surely everyone else could see right through was he was doing, right? Was casting doubt on every detail of what he’d said really a tactic that worked?
, and as it became clear some students were catching on quicker than others, he beckoned a couple of seven-years over to take over with the ones that were struggling, while he shared a few more spells with the rest of them.
“Actually-” Sirius started, but the lady continued to rant.
, though he recovered quickly when Hal shoved a dozen of gold pieces in his hand with a grin and told him it was his to use.
It left Anthony, who had actually held Pan back when they’d gotten off the train in June, and had slipped him a piece of parchment with his Floo coordinates. He hadn’t said anything, but Pan had seen his serious look, before he’d said something goofy or other to Ron. He hadn’t meant as a light ‘write to me’.
“Don’t.” Ron winced.
“That’s alright.” He mumbled, slightly uncomfortable.
“Okay.” He could hear the smile in his aunt’s voice, and she sounded satisfied with his promise. “You stay safe, darling.”
, which was how his aunt had been referring to Draco’s mom last time they’d been in contact, to
Before anyone could mope over that fact – or maybe point out that it really shouldn’t be up to them to figure it out? – the door to their compartment opened, and a recognisable ginger head peered in.
“Almost immediately.” Draco said. “My father was terrifying enough and I guess I felt silly after his intervention. And didn’t really think about all of that again for a long time, but… yeah, I guess I knew already.”
Fred and George had a different theory, or at least an additional one, which was that Oliver did not feel
“Here’s to breaking my dad’s heart.” She snorted. After a pause, she said with a wicked smile. “Zabini is going to be
“He’s not dangerous.” Hal snapped. “He didn’t kill these people. He’s my godfather.”
“I know what’s in the Chamber of Secrets!” She told him excitedly. “And I may know where to find it too!”
There was a brief moment of silence, which Neville broke in a timid voice.
While Quirrell panicked, Hal pressed his advantage, and palms up, pushed the man’s face right out of his way. Quirrell screamed, blisters erupting all over his face, and Hal wasted no time scrambling to his feet. But another, higher and shriller sound joined the screams – the small part of Hal’s brain that wasn’t in fight or flight mode was reminded of the Ringwraiths from the
“Is this a joke?” Harry asked.
“I am very sorry for your loss.” James Potter had carried on. “I know we don’t know each other, and you and Lily have fallen out, but she would really like to get along again.”
He missed as Quirrell diverted the spell with a slash of his wand, and raised it towards him – but he hesitated as his parasite hissed at him to
“Can I help you?” He asked coldly.
“They’re keys.” Anthony noted.
“How are you holding up?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t.” Hal interrupted immediately.
“I don’t think I need a new dress.” He first tried to bide his time.
to have you, she’s beside herself that we’re mates.”
It would have been incredibly easy, and while he didn’t condone stealing in any circumstances, and didn’t think he’d ever find himself in a situation where he had the urge to do it, he wasn’t sure if four overexcited teenagers sneaking around in the night in the basement of the best sweets shop in the vicinity could really be expected not to.
“Hal’s been having a hard time, you know.” He said. “He puts on a brave face all the time, but… You know, there are the ones who think he’s the Heir, and there are the ones who call him a hero with superpowers. He hates both. So…”
“I believe the mirror only responded to the enchantment it was placed under, to protect the stone.” The headmaster exposed. “A little twist on its original magic. It is a very special mirror, you know. It shows you what your heart most deeply desires.”
Hal’s aunt had joined them and introduced herself to Mrs Malfoy, and was offering her tea, which she politely refused.
Hermione stopped dead in her tracks. “Rolf, your cousin?” They had seen him around a few times, as Anthony greeted and talked to him. “His grandfather is Newton Scamander?”
They exchanged looks, the same question on everyone’s minds, but it was Hermione who eventually volunteered to ask it.
The rest of them followed him – Hermione trying to tell him it was rash and irresponsible and Neville whimpering vaguely, but they followed anyway. They quickly reached the forbidden corridor on the third floor – the stairs were very compliant with where they wanted to go, for once – and found the door ajar, a rumbling sound within.
“It’s open.” Hal called back.
Hal flushed, which Ley thankfully did not seem to notice.
Anthony, Neville and Pan had wandered nearer Hermione and the group of latest arrivals to see what they knew, figure out what exactly was going on and what the plan was, but Ron and Draco turned to him.
“That was on her eighteenth birthday.” Sirius told them, as they stared at the picture – Hal and Ley having gathered round Petunia to look it over with her.
Draco humoured him. “Like what?”
“What is it?” Hal prompted, kind and unworried, and Draco already hated himself for being the bearer of this shitty story.
“Harry Potter.” He breathed.
He smiled at her, genuinely. “I’m fine. I need to speak to a bully.”
wouldn’t have lasted that long. So unless someone invented a spell that Dumbledore cannot counter?”
“Why am I right?” Flint pushed.
Another smile flashed at the photographer. As he reached Hal, he flung an arm around his shoulder, and more photos were taken.
Hal looked down, burying his fingers in his cat’s fur for a minute, trying to cling to something normal.
He didn’t know how long they stayed like that, Neville crying his heart out, and Hal only managing to not crumble because he felt like he had to hold it together for his friend. He wondered, for the first time since learning about the wizarding world, just how many children were also orphans of the war, like him, and for all intents and purposes, like Neville.
“Twelve.”
It didn’t help matters when they made an alarming discovery one day at the dinner table. The Hogwarts elves had clearly decided to be a little creative, and amongst the usual offering or roasted meats and veg, were dishes of seafood risotto. Delighted, Luna revealed she’d never had seafood before, as her father absolutely abhorred anything fishy, and helped herself to a generous portion.
Hal glanced over at him and couldn’t stop a wry grin from forming on his lips. Growing up with Ley as the kids with more dead parents between them than the rest of their class put together had taught him things were usually much easier if you could find the funny side.
try to kill me during the last Quidditch game.”
He thought back at it.
at the cinema, and a massive chocolate cake with a pile of presents waiting for him back at home when they returned. It was, all in all, a good birthday.
“Ron, it’s snowing.” Hal grumbled back.
“Cowardly bastard.” Ron commented.
Hal dropped his spoon, which clattered on the table, splashing ice-cream everywhere. Terry actually drew his wand, though he sat back down (looking almost disappointed) when he was satisfied nothing nefarious was going on. Hal was simply gaping at his godfather, who frowned worriedly at him.
“Has that scar been bothering you, Mister Potter?” Madam Pomfrey asked insightfully.
“Blood magic.” Hal repeated cautiously.
“It makes me sad thinking about it.” He confessed. “Not because I want a sister.” He added quickly. “But… because I have you, and Auntie, and we’re happy, you know? I’m happy. And then the stupid magic mirrors shows me that, which is supposed to be my truest desire or something, and what am I meant to do with that? I don’t want to be told I should miss something I never had, when what I have is perfectly fine.”
“I guess…” He echoed. “Yeah, I guess I’d like us to date.”
, Hal briefly thought (not for the first time since he’d been at Hogwarts) as Hermione casually advised him not to die, and as he drunk a small potion to walk through flames and go against a grown wizard who may or may not want to kill him, to stop him from stealing something they had no idea what it even was. Probably, if they hadn’t ready the whole thing entirely wrong.
When the spell returned nothing, Draco grabbed to book and brought it back to the study to look at it in natural light, leaving the rest of the room to potential future exploration – for now, he pushed back the shelves, which clicked shut seamlessly. You’d never suspect they were anything but shelves.
Also warning for a passing racial slur.
“Don’t worry too much about it, it’s not personal.” Fred said.
It had been a move. He cared a lot for Hal now, as a person, regardless of whatever history they were both tangled in, but originally, yeah. He’d wanted to be his friend because he was
“One of the most protected places in Britain.” Pan echoed, somewhat scornfully. “Where so far we’ve had, let’s see. A three-headed dog only vaguely kept out of the way. A teacher possessed by the Dark Lord himself. Students getting petrified. A bloody giant Basilisk in the pipes. Another teacher with no qualms about attacking kids. A presumed murderer casually walking in. Exploding cauldrons. An abduction.”
Draco looked briefly over his shoulder, as if to check it still looked the same. His mother and Hal’s hand where exchanging a brief hug and starting to chat already. Draco had never thought of the house as impressive, having grown up here, but he supposed it was quite grand.
“Do you think there’s some intelligence behind it?” He wondered out loud. “As opposed to it being completely random.”
“Yes.” Anthony smirked. “Apparently the two are not mutually exclusive to Blaise. Or Cassius and Bridget.”
“Sounds good.” Draco said honestly.
Either way, Blaise did not have a father whose reputation in political circles depended on how his offspring behaved at school (his father, in fact, had died when Blaise was three years old of a bout of “bad health” that may or may not have been poisoning).
Behind them, the girls were continuing to comment both Hal and Draco’s qualities as potential future husbands, and wondering who Ley was and if he was also
“What?”
“I know.” Hal assured. “And I don’t want to just be like Oh, alright, convenient, let’s go with that then. I’m still… figuring myself out.”
“Must be lonely.” He let out.
“Salazar Slytherin lived in the 10
Hal had gone back to the mirror only once, to draw it. He didn’t want to let himself get stuck staring into the friendly faces of the family that would have been – he knew it wasn’t real. Getting wistful about seeing his mom and dad seemed ungrateful to the woman who had raised him like a son. Laughing at Violet’s stubborn pout felt like distancing himself from the boy who was in every way like his brother. And while he knew the Weasley and Longbottom families had been close to the Potters, would he have been friends with Hermione, Draco, Anthony, had he not been orphaned?
a common magical creature then there must be Muggle reports in other legends across the world, between the ancient Greeks and now.”
“Now, the spell I’ve just used on Professor Lockhart is a simple disarming spell.” Snape told the large gaggle of first, second and third years gathered around him. “Simple, but essential. It is actually a hard spell to block if you perform it well and quickly. The wand movement is less showy and therefore less predictable, and your adversary might expect you to open up with a more aggressive spell. In fact, a lot of duellists scorn
While a lot of kids met their families on the platform, Hal and Hermione went back through the barrier to find theirs waiting for them. They quickly exchanged
Draco had to swallow, twice, past the lump in his throat, before he managed to say a weak “Sure.”
“Let’s see.” The man breathed out as he pulled a large ledger. “P, Parkinson… Pince… Podmore… Potter! Main account holder, Potter, Harry James, other access to vault…” He looked up with somewhat of a wince. “None.”
.” The door opened with a click and Anthony beamed like he hadn’t actually expected it to work. “Neat!”
Snape left the room, and Hal started to rethink his relief that he hadn’t gotten detention. McGonagall might still decide otherwise. But as he sat there, he realised he didn’t care. He’d do it all over again if he had a choice. He looked sideways at Draco.
Draco took a deep breath. “He was arrested after one of his spells killed twelve Muggles and a Wizard.” He could see Hal get even paler. “He was running away after… It was just after You-Know-Who…”
“That’s cool.” Pan nodded. After a moment’s hesitation, he added: “I had a favour to ask your dad, actually. Well. A question first.”
“I have just one question.” Blaise raised his hand nonchalantly.
. It was always nice to be reminded of her priorities.
“Your aunt…” Draco trailed off, realising he knew nothing else about Harry’s current family situation.
“Oh, Malfoy!” He called out with a nasty grin. “Not greeting your betters? How rude.”
Pansy’s dad got her literally everything and anything she asked for – she was spoilt rotten, Narcissa had once said about her.
“Come on, Hal.” He nudged him. “Let’s go sit down somewhere, and wait for news.” He looked up to his professor. “You’ll let us know right away, right?”
“Yeah.” Remus looked up again, forcing a smile for his friend. “You’ll write?”
He didn’t know how long he cried, but he fell asleep in her arms.
“Wait.” Hal tried to say.
He’d never heard that before – unsurprisingly, Muggleborns being rarely discussed at all in his circles – but it was interesting. It made sense. He
Apart from that, he seemed nice and funny – so did his cousin, but also a real handful, especially when the two of them combined their efforts. Dora could tell Petunia was a rather formidable woman, to keep these two in check.

, he almost expected the disgusting face to say in its best villain voice, but he didn’t need that to abruptly be keenly aware that he was looking at the man (
There was definitely a voice, Hal could hear it clearly even if Ron and Hermione were straining their ears and shaking their heads. It was moving away, and Hal started after it.
“So what will you do if you see him?” Ley wondered.
He had just been speculating about what had happened to Harry Potter next, presuming he would surely be at Hogwarts this year as he thought he was their age, and Hal didn’t think he could face coming clean just yet.
could have died.”
“We trust you.” Hal told him seriously, before pointing his wand at the roof. “
“They’ve been telling me how busy things have been with the dental practice.” Hermione added. “It’s so… normal. But then I look around, and everyone’s doing magic, and that’s normal too, you know? Sometimes I feel like… my life is so different now. Like there’s a part of me they’ll never really see, never understand.”
*             *
. Hal was just happy to try as many flavours as he possibly could.
He stopped himself,
Lockhart was swishing about, apparently telling a story to bewildered-looking students, looking completely unaware that he had lost his charge on the way back from London.
After the class, Ron and Neville went straight for food, while Hermione ran to the library as if the books were going to fly off if she didn’t get to them fast enough. They met with the Ravenclaws on the way out, and Draco declared there was no time like the present and went to find Snape in his office. Hal and Anthony had consumed a humongous breakfast that morning, after challenging each other for who could eat the most hash browns, so they elected to make their way to the Astronomy tower where they had their next class together.
Hal took a short, shaky breath. He wanted to keep arguing this wasn’t fair, really, but she had a point.
“Lack of imagination.” Hermione said. When everyone else raised an eyebrow at her, she sighed and explained. “You were already high profile. You’ve survived You-Know-Who, twice. It stands to reason that you’ve either got special powers, or you’re a target. Either way, it puts you in the limelight.”
“Your dad had cool shit.” Ley commented. “Beats the Smeltings memorabilia my dad left me.”
“I am not sitting with you.” This last boy spoke. Hal saw him spot them, as they were pushing their suitcases as out of the way as possible. “Still space in yours?”
He wanted to be only angry at the boy, but in truth, he couldn’t help but worry – he
Severus missed the iciness in Draco’s voice as he continued to vent.
“I didn’t mean you.” Ron started, but Hal raised a hand to stop him.
them before they could turn around. “Making fun of Myrtle, are we? My favourite! Myrtle!”
“Oh my god.” Anthony breathed out. “It’s a Basilisk.”
“No, no.” Hal shook his head. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Oh, how else am I meant to take
“That’s Sirius Black.” Dora answered quietly. Draco didn’t think he could have found his voice.
“Here.” He held up a hand so they would stop fighting. “
The rest of January was… uneventful, compared to the first term. As the time since the last attack got longer, the pressure seemed to ease, people breathing a little more easily, walking a little less warily, eyeing Hal with a little less suspicion. Only Fred and George seemed to think that joke wasn’t getting old, and kept curtseying when they saw Hal and heralding him through the corridors if semi-hostile crowds still formed. It actually did wonders to defuse the tension, efficiently highlighting how ridiculous the whole idea was that little Hal, flanked by the goofy gangly twins, could in any way be a purveyor of great evil and petrification.
“He was on the team, right?” He asked.
“I don’t know exactly what happened.” Hal said, frustrated. “But he sure as hell wasn’t trying to help, and he’s dashed to the third floor. Whatever is kept there, I’m going to hazard a wild guess and assume it falling into the hands of Quirrell is
3.	Metaphorical shit is about to hit the proverbial fan.
“A Dementor.” Lupin replied.
know how big they grow?” Draco blurted out.
They made plans to discuss plans with their respective guardians, and Draco went to get Pomfrey to see if it would be alright for Hal to get out of bed (hiding Sil in his robes, the cat miraculously staying still and quiet as he did so). The matron came to check on him, and – seemingly reluctantly – agreed to let him go.
“Aw, come on.” Nils complained. “It’s no big deal.”
“Was it weird for you growing up?” Ron suddenly asked. “I mean, with your aunt, with your cousin being her son and you being her nephew…”
“I saw you write it in a few times.” Hal confessed. “And I thought it was just a diary, or notes or something, but knowing that it’s
explain these.” Anthony countered. “What happened?”
“It’s quarter to ten.” She brought to their attention. “We should go.”
“No, I mean, I get it.” Pan shook his head. “Not everyone can be as accepting as you guys. I’ll always be grateful to you for that, and I know I can’t expect it of everyone.”
“Right…” Ron said slowly. “And so, what’s up with Draco?”
“I wish I could do magic.” He said this time.
He tried to nudge Hal’s glasses off his face, but Hal evaded him, and glared back undeterred.
Ron’s Christmas had been as typically chaotic as usual, and he mostly talked about how much food he’d had, and all the amazing things his mom could make. She usually went all out this time of year, to her children’s great delight, and there was so much left over at the end of it, Ron had actually warned them all in advance not to take any food for the journey, and had brought each of them a complete lunch box with sandwiches, homemade lemonade and lots, lots of sweet treats.
“I’m dead serious.” Pan replied levelly. “I’ve changed my name to Eitan Parkinson, you’ll hear it in class, and I’ll be staying in the boys’ dorms.”
“Okay.” Hal said weakly. He had no idea what company that was, either.
In the end, the opportunity presented itself on that month’s Hogsmead weekend, as Hal discovered the wizard version of Truth or Dare. The principle of the game was the exact same as its Muggle counterpart, only in this one, mild compulsion and honesty charms were used to make it more binding. They were harmless spells, and fairly easy to resist if one put their mind to it, but if you let yourself be carried away by the atmosphere (and more often than not, the Butterbeer, as was the case for them when they decided to play as they sat around their booth in the Three Broomstick) you would find yourself truthing and daring with a lot less inhibition than in a usual state.
The classroom was disused and dusty, most desks pushed against the walls, and at the far end was a tall frame. As Hal got closer, removing the cloak and bundling up in his arms as we walked up to it, he realised it was a mirror. He’d thought it was a painting, because he could see several figures in it, but he could now definitely recognise his own reflection, moving as he did.
going to dwell on that image, because if that was his deepest desire, it was pathetic.
“Well.” George piped up – Hal could tell it was him because at some point during the game, the twins had shouted each other’s names before getting into a quick mud fight, and he remembered which one had had the truest aim. George’s forehead was still smeared. “The altitude, speed and angle weren’t of professional-class proportions, sure.”
“You’re taking this very well.” She commended him.
Ron had never really said anything, and Hal had never really thought about it, but now he did, he could see all the little clues, and really it made sense, having to raise seven children on one salary – Hal didn’t think Molly worked, and fair enough, even with magic to help around, she must have her hands full keeping up that household.
“A lot of the charges don’t concern us.” Hal expanded. “But they want me and Draco to testify regarding the attack. Obviously there aren’t really any other witnesses to his previous offences since he’s Obliviated them all.”
. These sounded like they dramatically lacked privacy, but when Hal and Hermione challenged the rest of them to send each other Muggle postcards and see who could find the most horrendous one, they all had to agree.
“Yeah, the Board of Governors is
Of the less canonical classes, I suspect Hermione also takes Magical Theory, and Hal is in Art – it might not crop up in this one, but his drawing skills will definitely make further appearances in later years. I had it in my mind when first starting this verse that Hal would be drawing excellent pencil sketches, not sure why, but I’m sticking with it even if it’s not prominent in the plot!
Draco and Hermione both frowned at him, because, who was Edmund? But they decided not to ask. It was often better not to ask, with Anthony.
“She was always right.”
“Really?”
“I see what you mean, actually.” He recognised. He gave a small contended sigh. “This is so cool.”
card.”
“Mister Potter, you are awake.” McGonagall stated.
Hal had resigned himself to spending the afternoon in the dorm playing with Sil, after a first year had started crying at the sight of him in the common room, until Ron cuffed him over the head and told him to stop moping.
“But he’s dead.” Ron said, in a way Hal could tell he was trying to convince himself as much as others. “And the philosopher’s stone was destroyed.”
*             *
“How about a godmother?”
. Hal just nodded, figuring the headmaster (as was usual) knew a lot more than he was letting on, and probably wasn’t going to start sharing secrets and theories with him anyway.
Pan snorted. “I have a fair guess as to how my father would react.”
“And you didn’t like my dad.” Hal completed, because his aunt had always been honest about that.
Deprived of an insight on his father’s collection, and of something to distract him, Draco sat at the desk with the notebook in front of him, dejected and bored.
Draco froze again, on instinct, but he relaxed minutely when he saw nothing but amusement, understanding and curiosity on the other boy’s features.
“I don’t think she expected everyone to know my name. Bit weird, that.”
There was a moment of silence, which Anthony broke.
“Oh. Right.” Draco blinked at him.
For plot purposes, Divination/Arithmancy/Muggle Studies are held at the same time, and Care/Runes. Guess for their year nobody (but Hermione) was taking classes in a combination that didn’t work with that ;)
“I didn’t sleep well, to be honest.” Draco sighed.
Either way, however much money Hal would have to his name, it was a helpful start in life. She suddenly felt newfound respect for James Potter. It was morbid to prepare for your possible death to the extent he had, but it was clear it had been with actual grounds, and it left his son with something for the future.
*             *
His godfather has been surprised enough by the question to drop his sneer.
Draco had spoken to her only a few times, since the train after Christmas, but that was enough times that he knew she didn’t like to talk about the bullying that was still going on at regular intervals, though she also didn’t like to lie about it either (unlike himself, Draco was always uncomfortably reminded. Whenever he thought about it, he always determined to tell someone immediately if Flint ever tried anything again). Her way around that was to outdo herself being particularly cryptic and evasive.
“He’d have made a much bigger deal of it than it needed to be.” Hal smiled. “I’m glad it was you.”
Hal had thought, after three months of stomaching classes with Lockhart, and the man’s apparent obsession with dragging him into the limelight, that he knew and had fully experienced the meaning of the word
Over the next few days of finding the diary, he had had long conversations with Tom. It was liberating, thrilling and addictive to have someone (or at least an illusion of someone) he could tell absolutely everything to, with no fear of revealing too much, of offending or of being judged.
He fully opened his eyes, helped in the process by someone – Neville, once he could see – placing his glasses on his face. Ron was indeed at the foot of the bed, peering at him anxiously. On each of his sides were the rest of this friends, Hermione holding one of his hands, and Draco the other. A few feet away, Mrs Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall were standing talking quietly, and they stopped and came nearer as they heard the others make happy noises.
.” She announced. “He’s playing the
It felts comfortable, even if they didn’t speak, as the boats started to glide on the water and the castle came into view, and there was too much awe and surprise among them to carry out a conversation. Even Draco had to admit the pictures did not do the school any justice. So he had time to think about the train journey.
Funnily enough, as he was righting himself, he saw the Snitch hovering lazily a little distance away from him, heading for the Hufflepuff rings. He couldn’t go after it, what with the whole ‘fighting with his equipment to potentially stay alive’ thing, but he didn’t think the other Seeker had spotted it either.
“This sucks.” Hal groaned, burying his head into his arms.
“So what do you want to do?” She asked.
“You bloody fools.” Severus snarled, but Draco knew him well enough to hear that there was more worry than anger in his voice.
“Something happen?” He asked.
“Your aunt has been informed.” The professor told Hal. “She has been invited to visit you, should she wish to.”
“I think you’re meant to be there.” She blurted out.
“He did.” Hal confirmed. “He was quite impressive, really.”
brothers.” Ron bemoaned, ignoring her intervention. “And a sister, though she’s younger than me. I’ll tell you though, I’m not believing a word of what Fred and George told me about Hogwarts, so I reckon I’ll have to find out most of it for myself, same as you guys.” He nodded to their suitcases, upright metal and plastic contrasting with his battered, century-old-looking leather chest. “Muggleborns, I take it?”
But Draco could see through her bored attitude, into her insecurity.
“Harry.” Someone spoke his name, in a soft breath of surprise, as he emerged onto the space between two carriages, where he knew – thought – nobody would be.
At the bottom of the staircase leading to where the Defence office was perched, he spotted Anthony’s cousin staring at the wall. They had spoken to the boy a few times, throughout the year, and he always seemed to be on a different planet.
“Mate, that was brilliant.” He slapped Draco on the back. “Didn’t know your French was so good.”
He fell asleep without even realising he was drifting off. He was floating on a cloud, which was very comfortable. The cloud turned into a ship flying in the sky. Then the ship was on the ocean, but there was a tempest raging. It was less comfortable. Lighting struck – and it was as if it had struck Hal and pierced right through his head, blinding him with pain.
A resounding roar cut him off as it filled the corridor, echoing around them.
“It’s not
Dumbledore chuckled. “Yes, I suppose it was.”
“You guys are both insane.”
“He’s right.” Draco agreed. “Your mom was Muggleborn.” He gave Hal a tight smile, before turning back to the rest of the group. “So if Hal had Slytherin blood, James Potter would have had it too.”
He didn’t let it spoil the mood as they joined the others. Ensued the most hilarious and chaotic game of Quidditch – if it could even still be called that by the end of it – that Hal had ever played. It ended in a water fight, though Hal thought it was much too cold for that, and didn’t really fancy getting ill again this year; but that was counting without Mrs Weasley casting a spell that felt like she’d turned a giant hair dryer on the lot of them, efficiently drying and warming them up when she called them in for cake.
“Is that a
Draco didn’t let that sting, he knew she was probably right. They tolerated each other, and she’d just opened up to him for some reason, but they weren’t really friends. However, that didn’t mean they couldn’t be.
“Yes.” Lupin confirmed, as he took a seat at a nearby desk. “And Harry, there is nothing-”
“And I’m not going to.” Draco repeated. “So drop it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s mother collected the used Portkey they had owled Hal for him to travel, and put it back on the mantelpiece – it was an old clay vase Draco had made when he was six, shortly after his father’s death, and he had no idea why she’d kept it, it was hideous. She kept saying it was useful to charm into a Portkey at a moment’s notice, but really she could have used anything.
The school had not only accepted his change of name, but also his request to be moved to the boys’ dormitory, so even if nobody paid attention at the start of any class when teachers would take the register, they would hardly be able to fail to notice that.
“It’s important.” Hal intervened.
“Really?” Anthony seemed surprised.
“It’s my fault.” Draco said brokenly.
There was a rush of footsteps behind them, and Neville appeared with McGonagall in tow.
“Excellent!” Nick took that as a yes. “I am looking forward to it, my young friend.”
flavour in particular was to die for, and as they came back and back again, Draco showed partial to pink grapefruit while Ley tended to gorge gorging himself on
He did, a little. He remembered it being a lot lonelier, and cold, like he wasn’t shown much love, like his aunt and uncle only touched him to perfunctorily tend to his basic needs or remove him from their way, and like Ley was barely there at all. He was glad he didn’t have any concrete memories, really.
There was a pause, before she turned to face him, giving him a solemn look.
“Oh, I’m on the team!” Hal realised he had completely forgotten to mention it in his letters. He was going to, but then figured he would need to explain Quidditch, and what a Seeker was, and reassure his aunt that broomsticks were quite safe really, and he’d decided to come back to that later, and hadn’t remembered.
“Being sure isn’t necessarily better.” Draco pursed his lips.
“I wish you’d focus on how talented with magic they were.” Hermione added.
“I prefer
Then the man was shoving sticks in his hand, and looking at him expectantly before snatching them away again, sometimes having asked him to wave them around a bit. Hal was glad Petunia had stayed out of the cramped little shop. She had very little patience for shop employees (or in this case, owners) who did not behave to her standards. What those standards were, Hal had never fully determined, but he was pretty sure the grumbling and manhandling would be quite outside of them.
Hal huffed, unimpressed at himself. “I didn’t do it consciously. I froze.” He admitted. “My wand was like a useless stick in my hand, I had no idea what to do, I just thought… I just thought we needed protection, I guess.”
They had gone through the door to a small room, at the centre of which stood a table covered in vials, and a roll of parchment. Hermione had taken it upon herself to solve the riddle, and she had gotten distracted thinking it was just another ‘challenge’ that was conspicuously suited to Hal and his friends’ knowledge and abilities.
“You’re past the point of being coy about this.” Draco added.
Draco supposed he did. He remembered seeing the Potters’ pictures from news records. Harry was looking at him with a little frown that Draco had seen a lot before: that was the face of someone wanting to figure out if you were trying to make a fool out of them, or get one over them. Ronald Weasley had once told Draco that was because he talked like he was better than everyone else – but Draco really couldn’t help it if he’d been raised to have perfect elocution, could he – and because that was exactly what Lucius always used to do. That one had stung.
“So, third year?” She grinned at Harry and Draco. “You’ll get to go to Hogsmeade!”
“’Ow did yer find out?” He asked.
“Come on.” Ron nudged Blaise’s leg under the table. “Don’t be a dick.”
“Use them to bring me cool stuff back from the Magic Kingdom then.”
He pointed his wand at them again. Hal shifted, his hand slipping from underneath Draco’s, only to turn and grip it better.
“Dudleykin!” Marge squealed as she enveloped Ley into a great big hug.
– come on, it was a little bit funny) he turned to his other side, where Ron’s brothers were seated. They’d at least snorted.
“He’s not here.” Rolf said.
He sent an apologetic look towards Neville, who shrugged. The first time they’d discussed how the person responsible for pretty much making Nev an orphan was Draco’s aunt, it had been painful. Now, they were acting like it was all water under the bridge and they were over it. Totally over it.
“Is that news to you?”
“Alright, well.” He said, fidgeting on his chair. “I should probably get going.”
His mother smiled knowingly, extending her arm and the owl towards him. “You can name her.” She said by way of confirmation.
Even briefly entertaining the possibility it could be a ghost (how many ghosts were in the castle that they didn’t know about?) at least served the purpose of distracting him as he remembered Halloween was getting near.
He threw the piece of wood, but in that time the dog had placed himself between the two boys, and he didn’t budge, only giving him Nils was seemed like an unimpressed look. Nils held out a hand for Hal.
“Harry-” Hermione’s use of his full name always announced a lecture, but Hal cut her off.
Hal had no doubt who – what – this friend was.
“Third floor?” Hal frowned. After a moment, his jaw clenched. “Okay.” He said determinedly. “We’re going to see Dumbledore.”
James had ambushed her – It was the only way to think of it – right at the end of the wake, after all the guests had left the venue, and Petunia herself had only popped to the loo before the drive home.
“Isn’t it?” Hal retorted, ice cold, looking straight into her eyes.
, she’s much better prepared.”
“From what I know of Draco.” Petunia smiled. “You’ve taught him plenty of good things. He wouldn’t have grown into the boy he is without you.”
“Can’t really blame you there.”
Ron snickered. “Mate. This is him
“No she?” He picked up. “There’s a he?”
“I thought you understood me.” He did really sound hurt, and Draco felt like his heart was breaking.
Hal diligently scribbled inside the cover,
“Oh my god, we’re moving.” Hermione jumped to look through the window and wave frenetically at the crowd, even though her parents had stayed on the other side. “Here we go! Did you know magical locations don’t actually exist in a parallel space? They’re just, in a space next to the Muggle space. The spells mean people without magic won’t notice them, but it’s not like, out of thin air, even if it looks that way.”
“Hermione can go first.” He decided.
He was still wearing his gear, because you never knew, and he had to sit on the bench anyway so he had to look the part, but it was extremely rare for something so drastic to happen that a player couldn’t continue and had to be swapped.
He dropped the cloak in question in his trunk, and upon seeing Ron’s face, he added with a laugh.
-	This isn’t exactly a Nice!Snape fic, but he is Draco’s godfather, and Draco and Harry are friends, therefore some of his nicer sides are shown.
The comment had come from the doorway, where a familiar lanky blonde stood. His hair had grown too, slicked back in a neat half-up style. His cold grey eyes were only accentuated by the deep bags that hung just below them, and his skin seemed almost paler than usual. A bandage wrapped around his left arm, right where the dark mark he used to brandish so proudly used to sit. Harry wondered if it was still there – if Malfoy’s mark hadn’t faded into a scar like everyone else’s. Or if it was just that he was ashamed of who he used to be.
It was his first year without a lot of people. He wouldn’t be able to send letters to Remus or Tonks anymore, or be harassed down the halls by Colin Creevey and his little brother. No Snape around every corner enacting revenge for his father’s misgivings either. Even Crabbe would no longer stalk down hogwarts’ halls.
The curtain wasn’t the only thing to go though. A majority of the weirder, more wizardy things he’d handed over to Arthur, as he knew he’d have a field day with them. Overall, he’d made such a dent in the house during this time that it was hard to recognise it in comparison to what it once was.
As the train came to a halt, and the familiar whistle of the train blew, Harry stood up, mustering up every ounce of courage he had.
“Well, I’ll be off. See you round.” A grin, and then he was gone.
“Who was sent by Malfoy.” Finished Ron, looking at Harry incredulously.
The excitement started to bubble around the platform, and heads turned and the crowd grew louder, everyone trying to clamber over themselves to get a glimpse of him.
But how do you discuss those things with your best friends, when all they said was that you’d done the best you could? Like…. Yes. But also it wasn’t enough to pacify the guilt that had him bedridden for days at a time.
They’d been through so much, the three of them. He reached out to Hermione with his right hand, the one that had
“Yes, you heard me correctly. I’m
Harry remembered the days he would count down until the summer break ended, the years of abuse hurled at him by the Dursley’s, and his once famous attraction to adventure.
But this summer would pass, and the world would return to normal. There were people who wouldn’t even know how many wizards and witches died during the battle. He knew wholeheartedly, that he wouldn’t be able to set foot in the astronomy tower ever again. He’d made peace with it.
In the time they’d spent catching up – they’d already reached the castle. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to face what awaited. Every part of him wanted to run as the train pulled into Hogsmeade station. To where – he didn’t know. It would be as easy as grabbing his fire bolt and taking off. Higher and higher and further and further. Maybe he could take after Sirius and just
If even the building could decipher that he wasn’t a girl, nobody else could argue that, right?
Harry didn’t have much to tell them himself, given that he hadn’t done a whole lot since he saw them last.
Hermione started; “Goyle sent us-”
The other boy scoffed, before resting his head against the doorway, looking at Harry quizzically. “Thought you liked the fame, didn’t you?”
The pitch Mcgonagall gave him was that it would complete his studies, and he could say a proper goodbye to the teachers and school that he had called home for years. And of course, there was always the quidditch tournament. One final hurrah.
He’d taken the advice like gospel. Hence the house restoration. But oftentimes, it wasn’t enough, and nights would be spent with eyes wide open, contemplating every little thing he could have done better. Every other path he could have taken. He knew no other plan would have worked. Nothing else could have been done.
. The words ran like a damning chorus through his mind every night.
carved into it like a promise.
Maybe Hermione was right. Maybe Hogwarts wouldn’t be so bad after all. Maybe it would be his biggest distraction yet. Maybe this was what he had been hoping for. He chose to believe that it was.
you, Potter.”
“Overwhelmed, Potter?”
But times had changed since then, and things were going to be different now. He could only hope it would sill work out alright. Being trans was the one secret he had managed to keep from the wizarding world, and he intended to keep it for as long as possible. He hoped whoever was in the dorms this time would respect that too.
It was time to face the school again, for the first time since the war ended.
for Christ’s sake. He was trying to cope with everything the best he could. But with no one to confide in, there was only so much he could accomplish.
“So. You know how I’ve said I’m totally fine, and nether of you should worry about me?” He started, before Hermione cut him off.
“I wouldn’t ever, Hermione, not after everything.”
you know? It’s bad enough to think that half of the bloody Gryffindor house knows. Imagine the whole senior cohort-”
“Hey, I was thinking.” Anthony leaned in towards them, clearly not interested in the Slytherin’s showdown either. “Your godfather told you they were really close, right, him and your dad, and Pettigrew, and Professor Lupin.”
Hal snorted. “Mate, I don’t think I saw you unrelaxed at any point.”
“Thankfully…” George repeated, winking exaggeratedly.
. Draco had no use for brawn, he would rather spend his time with someone who was at least capable of a conversation slightly more ambitious than monosyllabic answers.
“Seems a bit reductive.” Ley noted.
as something to explore later. “Well that’s just great.” He sighed.
“How old were you?” He asked softly.
“My mom’s trying new things.” Ron muttered. “You should see Percy’s.”
“You have nothing to apologise for, my precious boy.” Narcissa said softly, rubbing soothing circles on his back. “You are safe, you are both safe, that is what matters now.”
“Who’s that?” He asked demandingly.
Pan looked down. “No.” She admitted.
This time there was a longer pause. Draco hadn’t meant to sound accusatory, but he didn’t understand why Tom hadn’t said anything.
They went back to the dorm, and Hal didn’t cast another spell to tell the time, but by the time he finally to go back to sleep, he reckoned it must have been gone three AM.
“Oh.” Hal realised – he wanted to fly them up. “Alright then. Hang on tight.”
Hal wasn’t entirely sure how they’d all ended up lying on what felt like a shrubbery, looking up at a small square of light up ahead. Well, all but Rolf. Hal thought that was how they’d ended up there. Anthony’s cousin had said something like “I can play the flute” and pushed them all into the gaping trap door, which was closer than the exit out of the room. Or, at least, not currently barred by a lot of big fangs. Either way – they had not been eaten by a giant dog, which Hal would count as a small victory.
Pan responded with the adequate wince.
Hal nevertheless resolved to not mention the subject again, and to keep his deductions regarding Oliver and Flint’s feud to himself. At any rate, the result was the same: Ollie hated Flint’s guts (although who didn’t, really), beating the Slytherins was an all-encompassing obsession and nothing else mattered to him when that was on the line. On the morning of the game, he literally told Hal to catch the Snitch, or die trying.
*             *
“That is not shady at all.” Draco added dryly.
“Ay, the escape goat.” Hagrid nodded gravely, and in spite of himself, Draco had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from laughing, and he could see the same pinched expression on Hal’s and Anthony’s faces.
“I’m sure I will when I’m out of here.” Neville said, nipping that in the bud. “Thank you.”
“I think you should tell him.” Pan assessed.
“Will it?” Hal challenged.
“Right away, Master Draco!” The creature said enthusiastically, before another crack, and it was gone.
“It’s not like it’s that surprising, Ron.” Anthony interrupted. “A lot of the school thinks we’re all queer.”
Hal’s mouth dropped open, and he only swallowed back the words
Pan opened his mouth, then closed it, and shook his head. “Actually, I’d rather not comment on that.”
“I’ll be okay.” Hal assured her. “I just needed to rest, I’m not hurt or anything.”
“Can we see her?” Hal asked, interrupting her as she said she would take them back to their common rooms.
So yes, as much as he hated to admit it, Severus Snape was worried about the current wellbeing of Harry Potter. It had been unclear how Quirrell was in contact with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, but if Albus’ theory (one he had formulated as the year went by and they observed the man) was correct, Harry could very well be facing the Dark Lord himself, by way of the Defence teacher.
“I don’t think it was all luck.” Draco noted, looking appreciative.
“Unless you’ll think he’ll laugh at me.” Pan started to backtrack defensively.
“Yeah, I saved the day, go me.” Hal said gloomily, sitting up and dropping his arms, dejected. “How is that fair? This shouldn’t be on me. I’m
“Everyone was looking at
“But you’re still a girl.” Theo said, clearly not quite processing.
“Hi.” She smiled at him again. “I’m Hermione.”
“Want to talk about it?” Draco offered.
“Yeah.” Hal managed to answer in a breath.
Hal rolled his eyes. “We’re the same age.”
“Now, that’s not fair.” Theo tried to argue. “She’s only saying-”
“Do you have any idea what it could be, then?” Neville continued. “Or who?”
, and he wasn’t, he most definitely felt like he’d rather eat a pot of bat livers.
“Hal.” She repeated thoughtfully.
“Aww.” A voice sounded behind him as he hung up. “Isn’t that sweet.”
“I need a haircut, by the way, can I get one when I come home for Easter?”
He only seemed slightly out of breath from his run and subsequent spellcasting, while Draco felt just about ready to cough up a lung. He really needed to work on his cardio.
He finally broke down into a sob, and impulsively, Hal lounged forward and pulled him into a hug, holding him as if they would float away, or dissolve, without each other to anchor themselves to the stone.
“Should we go and sit down?” Hal suggested. “It’s actually baltic in here.”
“No, not just them!” Hermione insisted. “I have heard several older students saying he was very different when he taught Muggle Studies.”
, he wanted to say.
His friend was gay.
Just the six of them – to everyone unspoken and slightly guilt-tinged relief, all the Slytherins were sticking to their own quarters. They were getting along better, truly, but they still weren’t exactly thick as thieves, and having Pan hang out with them, let alone Blaise and occasionally Daphne, Vince and Greg, still felt like a bit of an intrusion.
“Never mind,” Granger interrupted. “Harry, are you
Harry was breathing hard now, wholly aware that they were causing a scene but not caring in the slightest. He just needed Draco to respond, say something back, but all he was doing was staring at Harry with wide eyes.
“I did all the work!”
“The longer you deny it, the harder it’s going to be to accept.”
“I want them to be happy about it though,” Potter said. “They’re just letting the past get in the way.”
Harry’s throat tightened.
“I’m not ignoring it,” he said sharply, snatching his hands back from her. Her eyes widened, but he kept going, driven by his own shock. “How could I possibly ignore it, Pansy? I know he’s not perfect, I know we’ve got a fucked up past, even before the war. I can’t forget the bad things he’s done to me, and I certainly can’t forget what I’ve done to him. But I’m not forgetting the good, either. He’s saved my life repeatedly when he never needed to. He’s been a decent person to me when he has no reason to. I’m not ignoring anything.”
Pansy gasped, scandalized, as Blaise shook his head.
“Good morning, Healer Malfoy,” she chirped.
Potter smirked slightly. “You think about me calling you Draco?”
They walked inside; Harry plopped himself down next to Samuel, and for the first time, Draco sat beside Harry. Samuel cocked his head at them, his dark eyes flitting between Harry and Draco.
“You know, there are other ways to get one’s attention,” Draco grumbled at the ground.
He took his glasses off to wash his face, though it barely made any difference.
"That's - that's great, Draco. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me," Potter said finally, his words kind and genuine.
“What?” asked Harry defensively, crossing his arms.
Samuel stared at him, stared at Malfoy, then stared at Damien again. Harry’s head was spinning too much to do much of anything. Malfoy, gay?
“It was good,” he said cautiously. He didn’t think he’d tell them about Malfoy, though he burned to talk about it with someone. But there was group confidentiality and all that. “The facilitator seems nice.”
Draco kissed him, overcome with affection. It was still hard to believe that Harry, the famed Chosen One, wanted him, someone known for being a cowardly, arrogant Death Eater.
He wet his chapped lips and gulped tightly, trying to focus on Ginny's words instead of the mere fact that she'd said them. But what was he supposed to say?
could hardly bear to lay eyes on it.
Draco made a strange desperate noise before rounding on Potter again. “What about me needing space? What happened to that?”
But he was interrupted by a knock at the door. It opened a second later and in came someone Harry didn’t know. She was tall – her heels adding to her height, and had a well-practiced smile.
“Yeah, sure,” Harry said. “Though I hope you’ll tell them in person soon. It’s been a while since anyone’s seen you. Ginny and Zabini are back, you know.”
“Come on, Potter,” he said when he stepped away. “We’ve got to go.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Are you still keeping tabs on me? Oh, what am I saying, of course you are, Potter,” Draco said as if it were obvious. He smirked. “Your inner stalker is showing itself again.”
All in all, Draco was excellent company and Harry never wanted it to end.
“Yes. Merlin, Harry, this shouldn’t be news to you.”
“You’re up early,” he commented.
Draco nodded, heart beating wildly beneath his chest.
“I was just asking cos – I, well...”
Draco swallowed and nodded. He quickly spotted an available room for Potter.
“This,” Draco said as he picked up his bent cigarette. “I may be many things, but I’m no litterer.”
“Good morning, Potter,” said Malfoy calmly. “Are you ready?”
“Bye, Harry.”
Potter wasn’t deterred. “Just saying hi.”
She was doubled over now and Harry could do nothing but feel his face growing hotter and hotter.
"I have," she responded calmly, "But I'd like to fill in the gaps by talking to you."
"How are you feeling?"
have been pity and withdrew his wand.
If Draco had to guess, he’d think that she was jealous of Astoria or Potter, or both.
As Harry tied the note onto Noc’s leg, Draco rolled to face him and asked, “Who’s it from?”
“We’re ready to start the cleansing procedure. Unfortunately, I am going to have to ask you to leave. We can only ensure the best results if we’re sure there’s no distractions while we’re performing the procedure.”
Potter gave a small smile. “If you really want her to, I could ask her.”
“Oh,” said Draco, and read it again.
"Thanks."
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He took a sip of his latte, which had gone cold. Wrinkling his nose, he set the mug down and looked at Potter.
No, that wasn't right.
reporters, and Merlin forbid, Rita bloody Skeeter.”
"You were probably thinking something like 'I've never seen such a fit American before, I need his cock up my arse right now,'" Ira said with a smirk.
When they pulled apart, Harry tasted salt on his lips and saw the redness in Draco’s eyes.
“Because I made his life hell,” Draco retorted. “You don’t get to conveniently forget everything I’d done to him, especially when I was always worse to him.”
Harry was a bit surprised. “No. I mean, no. Yeah. I don’t want to. But…”
Harry paused, listening to her words with fascination. “I went to Hogwarts with him. He was, er, a bit of a prat.”
Mitchell’s eyebrows drew together for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure.
They stood in comfortable silence for a moment. It was times like these when Draco wondered why they broke up in the first place, but it only took a few minutes to remember the reasons. They were infinitely better as friends and colleagues; their overwhelming passion burned them out so quickly that they grew bored of each other just as fast.
“But I didn’t. I couldn’t.”
Harry stood up and half-glared at Malfoy.
Hermione stood and rushed away, no doubt to write a long letter of congratulations. Ron watched her walk away, a fond smile on his face. He drifted away, his gaze still on the spot where Hermione had disappeared into their bedroom. He seemed to remember that Harry was there, and turned, his ears turning red.
“I think they thought it was Ginny for a moment, but then she came sat down at our table with Zabini, so those hopes were dashed,” Harry chuckled at the memory.
“And for me as well,” said Malfoy.
He didn’t make the same mistake of sitting up right away, and instead felt around for his glasses. They were on the bedside table; he put them on and observed his surroundings.
“I’m –“ he began to apologize, but she shook her head.
He backed away on instinct, his hands coming up to defend himself. Ginny was still coming towards him, though, and with a panic Harry realized that she had her wand in her hand.
“I was worried about how you’d react,” Draco admitted nervously. “I’m sorry, but to be fair, you have never been the biggest fan of him.”
“It’s just me,” Draco blurted out. He wished he hadn’t; Potter’s frown deepened.
Malfoy looked up then, seeming to feel Harry’s presence (or maybe his gaze), and gave a small smile.
“I’m glad you decided to come back,” said Samuel. “Loads of people come in once and never return. Too daunting, I guess.”
Betty blinked in surprise. “I’m sorry?”
“Oh, I saw him. He looked incredible, naturally. Better, really, in every shape of the word. I was hoping to just get him out of my system, but the opposite happened.”
At this point, Harry was shaking with the need to be filled – it was so close to happening and it
"Seeing as it's my house," Harry finished for him. He walked towards the two of them. "Good morning."
“Your ex. I was thinking maybe that’s why it’s harder for me with Ginny now, and –” Potter was saying, but Draco cut his rambling off short with a scoff.
,” Harry teased, smirking just a bit. His eyes were flashing in the light and he seemed so youthful, so full of life – Draco wanted Harry to look at him like that forever. “Not here for a lecture, you know.”
It’d been two days since that night. He and Harry hadn’t gotten much of a chance to talk since then; last night, they met at the same place by the lake. This was where Harry insisted that Draco call him Harry; this was where Draco agreed, and this was where they spent the next half an hour kissing, shielded by the dark of the night.
Astoria had returned and was looking back and forth between him and Potter, clearly confused.
He caught Malfoy huff out a breath as he walked towards Estrada.
“They haven’t noticed?”
"Fuck, god yes," Harry gasped, amazed that he didn't come just from Draco asking that question.
His shirtsleeves were soaked by the time he heard footsteps coming into the room again.
“You just need more time.” Pansy squeezed his hand. “There’s no shame in that.”
“Last night wasn’t too bad, was it?” Pansy asked in a low voice.
“No, you’re definitely not going to do that,” Harry said, a smile tugging at the edge of his lips. “Really though, thank you for trusting me enough to tell me that. I’m honored, even if you threatened to Obliviate me just now.”
“Why are you so good at chess, anyway? You never struck me as the type.”
“I didn’t mean to offend,” Draco said truthfully. “You don’t need to go. I don’t mind.”
“Potter…I…”
After wallowing for a few more minutes, Draco drew the curtain back and got out of bed. He glanced around the room. Blaise had already left for home, it seemed, and Draco had the room to himself. Gathering a fresh jumper and a pair of trousers, he left for the bathroom.
I had a great time writing this, even if it did give me a few headaches. It was cathartic in a way, and it's kind of bittersweet to be done. I really hope you enjoyed this story. Thanks for sticking around til the end <3
“Is that you?”
Estrada glared a bit at Malfoy, albeit playfully.
“Brilliant,” said Malfoy. “You’re at 37.2°C, which is just bordering on healthy. I’m glad that the potion’s worked.”
“Then why do you look like you’re telling me that you’ve accidentally killed someone? As long as the both of you had fully consented, then that’s great news! You’ve only been fawning over him for ages.”
“No, you didn’t,” Harry shrunk back, not looking for a fight, “But you’re even mates with Malfoy now.
“All right,” Malfoy said. “Well, Potter, am I correct in saying that you’ve changed your mind since our last conversation?”
“I’m not trying to disarm you or anything, Harry,” Draco said with a frown. “I have to carry myself differently at work; I’ve got to be a professional and caring for people is in my job description. I suppose it might be unsettling for me to move away from that…persona, since that’s really the only side of me you’ve seen in a while.”
“Oh. She’s not?” Potter blinked. “I just thought – fourth year, and you were always so close.”
Draco swallowed thickly and crossed his arms.
Though he knew Potter was joking, it stung. He bristled.
“What do you mean?”
– and soon his eyes were blinking open. He gave a sleepy
Draco swallowed.
He shot Harry a look that plainly said ‘shut up.’
Draco turned to Harry and sighed.
“See, there he is,” Blaise was saying as Draco walked up to them. “You needn’t worry about him.”
The waitress came with their drinks and took their orders. She bustled off again and Harry leaned closer over the table.
After group was over, Harry bid goodbye to Samuel and hung back outside, waiting against one of the brick walls of the library exterior. A few moments later, Draco exited the building, Cait in tow.
“What brought you here?” she prompted.
Before Harry could respond, Draco said, “Merlin, is this how you all really talk? I’m surprised you all weren’t sorted into Hufflepuff.”
“Have I done something wrong?” Draco asked.
And then break was over.
“Didn’t know you smoked,” Potter said after a moment of silence.
“None of us do, Harry.”
“No. You’re still a lower rank than me, a year younger than me,
Potter laughed shortly, and when he spoke, it was in a self-deprecating tone. “Yeah, that might be true.”
“No, I’m fine,” Harry told her again, guilt blooming inside of him. He focused on maintaining eye contact with Ginny, who still seemed skeptical. “Really.”
“I’m just wondering if you still stand by that decision,” Harry said, his lips quirking into a smile. He wanted to open his eyes to see Draco flush, but he was much too comfortable for that. “Like, if it was still worth all the effort to make them.”
“I’ll check up on your vitals and we’ll see if it’s improved,” Malfoy informed him as he drew his wand.
“Hey mate,” Harry was greeting Weasley with a one-armed hug. He did the same to Hermione and patted Rose’s head. “Sorry I’m all – like this. We were making the bed.”
“I was there. In the astronomy tower.”
He waited another ten minutes before emerging from his nest of blankets. It was November and snow had fallen a few days ago, but Draco had already been cold for months.
And they did just that; Harry followed Kathy’s soothing voice, finding it easy to fall into a state of relaxation. He let himself loosen his muscles and listened to Draco’s measured breaths next to him. Their thighs brushed against each other and Harry had to grip the edge of his seat to avoid feeling Draco up in the middle of group.
“Insomnia is another common symptom of substance withdrawal,” Malfoy explained. “You have to tell me everything, Potter. Every little thing may count.”
“I’m very happy to hear that, but it’s early days yet,” Draco replied calmly. At Potter’s sour look, he sighed. “At any rate, you’re not letting me finish. I feel badly about how it all went down at Mungo’s, and I want to apologize. So I’m sorry for goading you into revealing something you could’ve kept secret from me. I shouldn’t have pushed you, even though I really
“As usual.”
Draco stared down at his half-finished report on Potter. Mitchell needed it by the end of the week, and for Draco, this
"Yes, well, the things we do for love, eh?" Blaise said, glancing down at his girlfriend.
As he straightened up from the side of the bed, his eyes caught on the shiny black card that Malfoy had given him yesterday. It was sitting on the bedside table innocently enough, but as soon as Harry’s tired brain processed what it was, he felt nauseated all over again. Annoyed, Harry snatched the business card and glared down at it.
Harry just smirked at him, not falling for Draco’s trap.
Draco smirked teasingly. “Is that all I’m good for?”
He had crossed his arms and was making his way to Draco in a roundabout manner.
It was on a Thursday evening that he’d gotten back from Johnny’s (telling Ginny he was headed for the shop) tipsy and high. It was the first time Harry had drunk alcohol since waking up in St. Mungo’s and it was fucking
“Yeah, er, I can see that,” Harry said. He glared at Ginny, who shrugged sheepishly. “Since when?”
“Oh,” Harry said, unsure of what to think.
“Of course not,” Harry frowned at him. “Of course I wouldn’t tell them, Draco.”
Harry clearing his throat shocked Draco out of his reverie. He flushed; how long had he been staring? But then he saw the way Harry was looking at him, not with disgust or displeasure, but with curiosity. His green eyes seemed to gleam in the dark and Draco shivered.
Draco combed his hair back with his fingers, uncertain of how presentable he looked. If Harry was any indication, he must’ve looked a disaster.
Malfoy looked at Harry impassively. “I’ll advise you to lie back down, Potter.”
What Draco Malfoy was doing at a Muggle mental illness support group meeting, Harry did not know. Malfoy crossed the room and sat down directly across from Harry, apparently not spotting him, but as soon as he looked up and caught sight of him, Malfoy’s grey eyes widened fractionally.
He got it from the back pocket of his trousers where it had almost fallen out, and did a quick lubrication spell. Draco got to work, sliding it over his fingers and cock as quickly as he could.
“Er – “
He put effort into saying Potter’s name as nastily as possible, finding it easier than he would’ve liked to slip into his old childhood persona, and it paid off; Potter flinched and withdrew from Draco an inch. But then Potter gritted his teeth and leaned forward again, glaring at Draco with those bright green eyes.
And with that, Luna skipped away, her basket swinging wildly from her arm. Harry watched her, a small smile on his face.
“I – “
“Good. Like I’d said, it’ll be fine. You said Lovegood and mini Weasley were fine with us dating, didn’t you?”
When they’d run out of air, they parted though their hands remained where they were. Draco’s breaths were heavy as he stared up at Leo and became aware of his growing erection. He took his hands back and glanced away, embarrassed, and felt his face and neck go hot.
He’d finish it later.
“Will you,” Draco began to ask hesitantly, “Tell them about…you know?”
He passed the parchment and quill over to Harry and transfigured the other visitor’s chair into a small desk. Harry put the parchment down on the desk and began filling it out – his street address, his emergency contacts, and Harry was surprised to find a line for a phone number. The wizarding world was really evolving, thought Harry with wonder as he filled in his own mobile number.
“No, no, I wasn’t,” Draco said quickly. He frowned down at his untouched latte. “I was just surprised. I would’ve never thought that you’d…I
“I, er, suppose? I mean, I still like girls too, but I’ve just realized now that I like blokes the same way.”
“What will you do, then? Tie my hands back and force food down my throat?” Draco saw Harry’s eyes widen but he kept going, “Even the great Harry Potter can’t do that.”
He made his way there, trying his best to avoid stony gazes and rigid shoulders. Draco clumsily opened the door to the balcony and stepped outside. He shivered as he looked down, white fingers gripping the railing tight. Seven floors up. He wondered how long it would take to meet the ground from here.
“Gin…”
With a start, Draco realized that Astoria had caught him looking at her and felt his face warm. Astoria gave him a sly smile before turning her attention back to her sister and Pansy.
“Does it have something to do with me?”
Draco’s mind was pulled away from Potter at Leo’s irritated voice. He looked at Leo expectantly, and Leo looked at him right back.
Harry felt a sudden rush of affection for them and had the impulse to leave to just see them, to just tell them how important they were to him. He didn’t think he expressed it to them often enough.
“She doesn’t get out much,” Malfoy answered. His grey eyes were on Kathy. “I think it’s the opposite with her. If she stays in the house, it’s like nothing’s changed outside.”
Draco didn’t really believe him, but he nodded anyways, remembering their conversation out on the balcony.
He felt pathetic. Harry groaned aloud, wishing he could Obliviate himself and rid himself of the memory.
“So…are you two…?”
“She’s my sister, mate,” Ron said. “I can tell whether she’s dating someone or not.”
Draco gave a surprised smile but complied, smoothly taking off his turtleneck in one motion and revealing more pale skin marred by long, thin scars and the tattoo/Dark Mark.
“Well, there’s the common denominator.” At Potter’s questioning look, Draco said, “You also told me while you were drunk, remember?”
“Malfoy’s a git,” said Harry before he could stop himself.
“Oh, I will,” Draco breathed, and kissed him.
He didn’t think he could ever get used to Potter calling him Draco.
Malfoy rose an eyebrow, his eyes gleaming with interest.
The tension in the air was palpable, and Harry desperately wished that everyone else would leave. Instead, they remained and glanced nervously between Ginny, still standing her ground, and Harry, who would've liked it if he simply ceased to exist.
“And those really are mine,” Draco added, pointing at the cigarettes, “So could I have them back?”
Ginny was also the one who had gotten him to wean off the dreamless sleep. She’d noticed just how much he was taking, and just how frequently, and confronted him about it. Harry tried to deny it at first, but she could see right through him. She had known him too well and too long for that. She helped him stop even though he was scared and angry and he begged her to let him keep using them.
"We're all fucked up, Potter."
“But then,” Wolff continued, “I recall seeing something in the papers about you testifying at Healer Malfoy’s trial, ultimately helping him evade Azkaban.”
“That’s fucking rubbish, Draco, and you know it,” Pansy retorted. “After all those hours – those
He met Harry’s gaze, steady and warm. Harry leant in to kiss him, slowly, savoring the feel and taste of Draco, and the way Draco kissed back almost carefully.
“I hope so. That would be lovely, wouldn’t it?” Luna smiled. “How are you feeling, Harry? You look different. Better, even.”
"I was scared, all right?" Draco burst out, snapping his head up to glare at Harry. "I've got to look out for myself."
Had he ever seen anything so breathtaking?
ago, that you’d gone back to Hogwarts too, but…I dunno. I reckon I stopped paying attention at some point. To everything, almost.”
was the one who was obsessed,” Draco teased.
“I think we all know what I’m doing,” Harry said, his voice tight. “So just – get whatever you came here for and
Draco cursed inwardly and looked down at his table. Everything was too different and too similar all at once. This classroom, one he’d spent countless hours in, was being filled with new presences when the old had barely left. He still half expected to hear Professor Snape ruthlessly berating Longbottom or Potter even though Snape was long gone, from both this classroom and this earth. Draco wondered idly if Slughorn would be back to teach Potions. He couldn’t see why he wouldn’t.
“Well, I’ve only had theories, of course, never explicit declarations of love,” Ira said thoughtfully. “So I suppose I never
“Don’t call me that, you bint,” Daphne growled, but Astoria had already gone ahead and snuck her arm through Draco’s own.
“Nice to meet you, Sam.”
It was Saturday. He was going to be released the day after tomorrow, even though he felt so unbelievably far from ready. The only thing that gave him the semblance of hope was that Ginny was going to be with him and making sure he wouldn't relapse. It made him nervous, funnily enough, to think about living with Ginny again. It'd been years since they had before she'd broken up with him and moved out, leaving Harry to his own devices.
“Wait,” murmured Harry, and he took his glasses off, tossing them onto the nightstand.
“Fine.” He kicked a rock near his feet; it flew into the lake with a loud splash. “Ron and Hermione still aren’t convinced that we should be friends.”
He had his answer already. He’d been imagining leaving this damned place for the past two weeks, and he’d known for a while that he only wanted Ginny with him when he left. Less chance of attracting attention that way, and less people fretting over him.
, and there was Harry, twenty-five and wasting the life his mother had sacrificed herself for.
“I need to talk to you,” Draco admitted. He felt his eyebrows pinch together. “About non-work-related matters.”
They were sat in Ginny’s flat – clean, sort of minimalistic, with open windows and little flower pots along the windowsills. Artistically scattered about were articles and photographs from past games, little trophies and souvenirs as a reminder of her accomplishments. Ginny herself was wearing an overly large sweater and her hair was wild, like she’d just finished flying (but no, she’d just gotten out of bed, thanks to Harry’s panicked firecall).
“Of course. I’m not the type to forget things while drunk. And you’re welcome, though it wasn’t for you.”
Draco studied Harry, trying to see if he was taking the piss. Harry, a Slytherin?
“Look, you don’t need to believe me, Malfoy. But I know what I know,” Potter said. “You think you know my friends better than I do?”
“I think you’re being overly optimistic in thinking that Finnigan won’t care or won’t notice.”
“Maybe we should reschedule the official meeting for another time,” Harry suggested. “Like maybe when I’m not in hospital. Does he even know what I’m in here for?”
Potter looked up at him and grinned sheepishly. He did as Draco asked, and Draco cast a cleaning spell to rid Potter’s hands of the juice.
Potter trailed off, his body relaxing as he stared at Draco with a strange look on his face. Draco stared back in retaliation, praying his face wasn’t turning pink.
Draco was already painfully hard and that scared him. He’d never had sex before, never even done anything past snogging. He pulled away, his face flushed and lips swollen. Did Harry want more? Did he expect more? Had he had sex before? He must’ve.
Well, everything was different. Draco was officially fucked in the head, and Potter certainly wasn’t the picture of health either. He used to be so expressive, wearing his heart on his sleeve and barely caring what anyone thought of him. Now, though, he was guarded and closed off. It was rare that Draco saw anything slip through the cracks, and he feared what lay underneath the surface. The emptiness that he caught in Potter’s eyes on rare occasions was unsettling enough.
He had apparently chosen to keep his hair at the length it had grown into during his absent year – it nearly reached his shoulders. Who’d have thought perpetually messy hair looked better longer? He had also filled out his robes better than he ever had in all his years of schooling – Draco would know, he had spent six consecutive years glaring at his classmate. Potter laughed at something Weasley said.
The words stung even if Draco knew what he meant. It must’ve shown on his face, because Potter quickly added, “You look ill. Worse than you did in sixth year.”
Harry pointed at the bedside drawer; Draco got it wordlessly and uncapped it with steady fingers. Harry watched, his mind foggy, as Draco covered his fingers in it. Once he’d finished, he looked up at Harry.
Draco released Harry’s finger from his mouth and licked his lips, his eyes watching Harry trace the pattern.
“Yes, just like that,” Draco murmured, his hands playing with Harry’s hair. “So good.”
“I see,” Wolff was nodding. “You don’t need to feel badly about it, Harry. It’s quite normal that you find yourself with too much time on your hands now, given that much of your time before was likely spent using or buying.”
It turned out, however, that he couldn’t sleep.
Harry was slowly becoming infatuated with Malfoy.
“I – “
“I’ve got some slots for you,” Malfoy said as he withdrew a slip of paper from his clipboard. “Unfortunately, she didn't have any openings until next week. She can always make exceptions for emergencies, however, if necessary.”
“Ira,” Draco was saying before he had even fully opened the door to their office. “You’re attractive and charming, right?”
After breakfast, Draco went to drop off his mother’s wand in his dormitory and take a shower (much to the relief of Pansy). The hot water and clean clothes were, truthfully, a soothing relief after all the activity from the previous night.
Just thinking about all the hours of meaningless interaction and schoolwork and lectures made him want to go back to bed and sleep forever. Draco made his way over to his wardrobe and began picking out the clean set of clothes he would wear that day.
my feelings for you at the same time.”
mention the attempted murder, right?” Draco asked. His fingers shook as he lifted the cigarette to his mouth, and he doubted it was because of the cold. “I think that might trump torture.”
He was wearing that black hoodie again, though his sleeves weren’t rolled up like last time. It was too cold for that now. His hair was messier than usual (bedhead?), and it blew gently in the wind. There was a look of determination on his face. Draco shivered.
“Someone’s staring at you,” she said quietly in a sing-song voice.
He wondered if he should tell her that he’d slowly been getting obsessed with Malfoy all over again. He honestly didn’t know how she would react.
“No,” Draco said, flabbergasted. “You can’t just order me around,
and the rest of the Death Eaters were trying to kill you over and over again. It was a noble cause, but me? It was just so
Harry nodded, unable to speak.
“Of course I do,” Harry sighed. “He wrote me a letter on Christmas Eve and I responded, of course, but it’s still not the same as it used to be. He feels so far away now. He doesn’t even know we’re dating,” he added almost as an afterthought.
Potter’s mouth was open and his brows were furrowed.
Harry grinned.
It was 4 pm by the time Draco felt confident that they were doing all they could for Douglas and that he could move on to other patients and do his rounds. He saved Potter for last – because of nerves, perhaps? Or maybe because Draco wanted to spend more time with him.
“I know, I know,” Harry sighed.
"No," Hermione bit her lip and her brows drew close. "Well, perhaps a bit. But not at all."
Draco raised his eyebrows.
“Thanks,” Ginny mumbled.
Harry ordered five pints and he leaned back against the bar, crossing his arms and smiling at Draco.
Harry
**Rating upped to E just in case***
The other Healer was a young woman with a long, black braid and white Healer robes – perhaps she was of a lower rank. Her badge simply read ‘Bethia Burke.’
“Hi, Malfoy.”
the bastard.”
“It wasn’t a threat, it was simply an offer,” Draco countered, though he was now fighting a smile as well.
“Oh,” said Draco again.
“Betty, could you fire-call his closest contacts? They’re most likely Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.”
“Please.”
“Mhm,” Harry said.
They got to the staircase without incident and climbed up the steps. When they finally reached the top, Harry opened the door and peered inside the room. A moment later, Harry pulled Draco in and closed the door, beaming as he did so.
Potter broke the uncomfortable silence.
"What the fuck do you know about me?" Harry asked as the ache in his chest grew tenfold. He knew Draco was right but he couldn't admit it.
Malfoy glanced over the files at the end of the bed and nodded, apparently pleased.
Ginny sat down in one of the chairs. “How are you doing?”
“Er, no,” Harry frowned. “I just wanted to talk to you.”
Harry nodded and exhaled shakily as he felt Draco’s cock enter him, tight and thick and perfect.
They’d gotten to Malfoy’s office without incident and Harry slipped inside after Malfoy.
“But no, I didn’t know Harry’s relationship with Draco had progressed,” Luna told Ginny as she intertwined her fingers with Ginny’s. Harry looked away – he never thought hand-holding could be so intimate or gentle. “He looks happier, doesn’t he?”
For the rest of the day, Draco’s mind drifted back to Ginevra’s letter. He couldn’t help but entertain the idea of having lunch with Potter (and her). It
“Um, yes, I have,” answered Draco unnecessarily. He glanced at Harry, who cocked his head, and then looked back at Hermione and Ron. He took a shuddering breath and added, his words fast but clear, “Good morning. Thank you for having me; I’m well aware that I’m not your first choice of a houseguest – I’m more likely your last.”
“I’m only a walk away,” Harry said, pointing vaguely in the direction where he thought home was.
“I forgot you’ve seen it before. I mean, you’ve even touched it before,” Potter said conversationally. He put it down on the table and went back to gripping his tea.
“Right.” Draco thought for a minute. “Let’s try
Draco laughed too, trying to picture it in his head.
“And I reckon you wanted to see me, too,” Potter added with a slight smile.
Malfoy left without another word, his only goodbye the soft click of the door as it closed.
“All right?”
He took Draco’s hand and led him into his bedroom through the dark. He climbed into bed first, then beckoned Draco to join him. Draco made quick work of undressing Harry, pausing only to press hot kisses onto his newly bare skin. Soon, Harry was naked while Draco was still fully clothed.
“Are you gonna go after them?
“I realized I’d forgotten my favorite quill here, and doing research feels quite different without it,” Luna said, now threading her fingers through Ginny’s long locks. Ginny blushed deeper. “But I regret interrupting your conversation. Harry, are you feeling better? Ginny can always make me feel better when I’m not feeling well.”
had lit this particular fire…
“To the Weasley-Grangers.”
Once he had gotten over the initial shock, Draco hurried over to the shocking sight. Trainee Healer Bethia Burke and Healer Leonel Estrada were running the stretcher and casting diagnostic spells.
The door flew open and Leonel stood behind it. The smell of Indian takeout wafted out as Leo smiled at Draco. He had evidently just gotten home; he’d only taken off his Healer robes, revealing the white shirt and dark wash jeans he had worn beneath them.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“I want to say sorry, Malfoy,” Potter finally said when the silence had become suffocating. Draco's eyes widened. “For being such an arse when I first came in. It's obvious that you've changed and I...understand now.”
“N- what do you mean, stayed dead?”
Harry nearly laughed from the absurdity of it all, but instead replied, “I'll admit it wasn't one of your best ideas.”
"Harder, harder," Harry babbled.
Harry was about to rebuke this fact, but Ginny beat him to it.
“Right,” said Malfoy with a note of finality, “I will now check your vitals one last time. Afterwards, we’ll contact Ginevra and have her collect you.”
Harry gave a smirk before he licked – oh
“Huh?”
“Well, yeah,” admitted Harry, “But I want it even more today.”
Draco glared and followed along as Harry completed his tour, waiting only for the moment their visitors left so they could pick up where they had left off.
“I don’t know if you do, though,” Samuel said lowly.
, thought Draco, and he touched Leonel’s cheek lightly. Draco met Leo's eyes, and an unasked question hung heavy in the air. Leo’s eyes flickered from Draco’s own to his lips.
“I just constantly feel sick to my stomach,” Samuel answered with a frown. “Normally, when I’m anxious, it goes away after a while, but it hasn’t been going away lately. I just can’t calm down. My stomach’s always twisting and my brain is always going, so it’s - it’s not fun.”
He rolled his eyes. “Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I know where it is. I don’t even know when the last time I saw it was.”
After much deliberation, he read and reread the summary that was on that support group’s website. It was another week before he emailed them, saying he was interested in joining. When they emailed back, saying they’d love to have him and providing all of the information, he read and reread that too.
“What?” he said defensively, taking in their expressions. “My dad’s uncle abused potions when I was a kid.”
"And...Zabini?"
He put the letter down on his coffee table, stood up quickly, and promptly began pacing nervously around his flat.
Mitchell interrupted Draco’s silent musings.
“I’m on ‘till seven.”
“This is real, this is – oh,
“Wonderful. That’s very reassuring.”
Hermione was looking at him with concern in her eyes. Even Ron looked worried, all the tension in his body gone.
Potter looked halfway between a laugh and a scowl. “No, we definitely don’t do that.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry Potter look up at Pansy’s words. Draco rolled his eyes, shooting a momentary glare at Potter before turning a bit so his back would be to Potter.
Draco could only nod, his throat tight, as he watched Potter leave.
And then Potter woke with a gasp, eyes wide and face covered in sweat.
Malfoy smirked at the bemused look on Harry’s face.
“I’ll be going,” Draco said, sticking some bread in his mouth. He chewed and swallowed. “But I’m going with Potter and his friends.”
“Where to?”
Draco set the bottle down and looked around Harry’s room. He’d only been in here a few times before.
“Harry,” Kathy said, and his eyes snapped to her. “These caretakers, were they your parents?”
“I should. But…I dunno. We’ll see.”
Malfoy and White stared at him with identical expressions: worry. He couldn’t stand it. He’d had enough years of people just staring at him, watching him, needing him, asking things of him.
Oh. The Fidelius charm. Harry took Draco’s arm again and they walked towards 12 Grimmauld Place. When Harry reached the first step, the earth began to tremble.
How could he have let this happen to himself? Although, he thought, some part of him had wanted this, right? Fine, he was in trouble last night – he could admit that. But he didn’t need to stay here and “recover.” He just needed to get back on his feet and get out as soon as possible. He felt nauseous just thinking about the media getting ahold of this – Harry Potter reemerges in St. Mungo’s after…how many years was it now?
But then he figured it was only a matter of time before Potter went back to ignoring him. It was too good to be true, really; Potter wasn’t meant to be socializing with someone like him.
"Tell me something about yourself."
“Oh, nothing. That’s it. That’s all I wanted to tell you,” Draco said, still feeling faint.
“It is, I promise.”
Draco complied, unbuttoning Harry’s trousers and pulling them down enough so Harry could kick them off.
Draco woke up the next morning with the unusual feeling of someone else pressed against him. He opened his eyes and was greeted by the sight of Harry, fast asleep and with his mouth drooped open, his face an inch away from his own. He looked up, saw bright red in every direction, and last night came back to him at once.
worry about it, Harry,” Draco hissed, sitting up. Harry sat up too and stared at him, challenging him even in silence. “Even though you’re apparently refusing to acknowledge your problems, I won’t. I
“I know,” Draco said, and he did. “I’m just not used to her not speaking to me so much. After seven years of always having her in my ear, it’s…strange.”
, too.”
Heartened by this show of faith, Draco took a chance.
In terms of low points in his life, Harry thought he had to rate that one in the top five. Harry still remembered with a gut-wrenching clarity the way Malfoy had looked at him after his outburst. The shock on his face said it all, and as if it couldn’t get worse, Malfoy had dismissed his feelings entirely. He could only imagine what Malfoy was thinking. Was he repulsed? Or did he find it hilarious?
“D’you mind if I sit?”
"No," Harry sighed. "Thank you, Betty."
looked so hurt when really it was Draco who should be looking that way.
“But I do,” Potter said, and Merlin help him, he sounded genuine.
just be a mark to you.”
“Let them watch.”
He scribbled the answer onto his parchment and smiled a little too forcefully.
He and Pansy had drifted off after the war and trials. Draco had chosen to return to Hogwarts and work on becoming a Healer, while Pansy left for Spain to escape. They still wrote at the time, however, and became each other’s only confidants. With his father in Azkaban and his mother cooped up in the Manor, it was up to Draco to repair the image of the Malfoy name, if such a thing were even possible.
“So you were doing exactly what you’re accusing Granger and Weasley of doing now.”
“No, it’s not that, you prat,” Potter rolled his eyes aggressively and finally met Draco’s gaze once more.
Harry sighed. “Why not.”
“Wait, is that why – oh,” Leo said, his voice suddenly full of understanding.
And then he strode off, leaving behind a cold latte and Potter, a confused expression on his face.
“You ever heard of aromanticism?” Pansy asked, leaning forward with a smile.
Samuel raised his eyebrows but didn’t push. Harry decided that he liked Samuel.
“I agree with you, mate,” Ron had said as he went back to work. “I guess we really do need to catch up with the Muggles.”
“Er, yeah, nice to meet you,” he said, a bit intimidated by her judging eye.
ed and strode off, leaving Draco to return to Pansy and Harry.
“Who’s the smug fuck now?”
Draco chose this moment to slip his hand into Harry’s trousers, and Harry gasped as Draco took hold of his throbbing cock.
“Harry.”
But Ron just gave him a look and Harry shut up. Hermione sighed and put a hand on his arm.
Potter gave a short laugh. “Obviously. Who
It was Ira and Betty once again, approaching the two men with matching smiles. Draco’s face warmed at the thought that they had seen Draco ogling Leo. They didn’t say anything about it, however, and instead ordered drinks.
“No worries,” said Samuel (who was still too good of a human being to be friends with Harry). “I just figured you had too much to drink.”
Enjoy xoxo
Draco stopped dead in his tracks, a resolute crunch of the ice only exaggerating his point. Harry was looking at him hopefully.
“Not now, I know,” Draco said calmly. “But when?”
“It suits him,” Luna said, coming to his defense.
“Care more?” Potter filled in for him. Draco nodded slowly. “Maybe. But then what? They’d tell me they’re sorry and that they’re here for me, and then they’d just go back to their lives. I’m not a priority.”
Draco took a deep breath. “I don’t think I’m quite ready for everyone to find out yet.”
“Ignore all that, if you would,” Draco said, forcing a light tone of voice. “In fact, would it be alright if I Obliviated you? And then I’ll do the same for myself. Just say the word, Potter, and I’ll do it.”
They were sitting by the lake, and it was daytime for once. Absolutely anyone could see them.
What a loaded question. Harry exhaled and looked away, trying to think without getting unnerved by Wolff’s intense gaze.
“I’m very talented at sicking up. Although,” Draco continued despite knowing very well that he should stop, “I have to say I prefer doing it myself. Or rather, making the choice myself.
and fall happily in love with this charming, clever, ridiculously fit bloke who was obviously still into him? It would be so much easier than pining over some complicated git with whom Draco had so much ugly history with.
Harry couldn’t gather the will to do it himself, so he followed along miserably as Ginny marched around and collected assorted bottles of liquor and potions. Her arms were full as she led them to the bathroom.
"Back to Malfoy, now, are we?" Draco drawled, a hint of interest in his voice. It reminded Harry painfully of Hogwarts.
On Wednesday, Harry waited outside room 142 to pull Draco aside, catching him by surprise.
“So are the potion levels,” said Leonel, frowning at the red swirling shapes in front of him. “I’ll have to determine what potions are in his system.”
Clearing his throat, Draco asked, “Is this a bad time?”
“How about this,” Draco sighed. “You tell me this again tomorrow, when you’re nice and sober. Then maybe I’ll believe you.”
Draco finished a sentence and stopped, putting his quill into his ink pot. He shook out his cramped hand as he tried to force his brain to cooperate. He was so exhausted that he wasn’t even really certain of what he was writing. His vision blurred slightly as he started down at the parchment. Blinking furiously, he stretched out his back and relished in the feeling of his spine being straightened. He exhaled sharply as several loud cracks broke the empty silence.
Draco hummed in response.
"Are you sure there's nothing else bothering you, Harry? What made you want to drink in the first place?"
After he’d gathered the courage to leave his bed, he walked steadfastly past his mobile and into the kitchen. He sat there for a while, absentmindedly drinking a cup of coffee.
“Draco, I…” Harry began, running a hand through his hair. He was nervous all over again, remembering the moment they’d had before Hermione and Ron had arrived and wanting to know what it meant. “Do you…”
“I know,” Betty nodded. “I was just getting my things when Healer White and I started talking…”
“If you want it to,” Harry said softly, playing with the collar of Draco’s button-up. He avoided his eyes.
“I know, smoking kills,” Draco said as he put the box back where it belonged. He felt their eyes on him, and he desperately wanted to leave. He turned to Harry. “Should I just leave you all to sort this out? I don’t think I need to be here.”
“It’s already forgotten, Leo,” Draco said, waving the apology away. “Don’t worry about it.”
“Fine. One thing?”
“You’re not going to treat me any differently,” Potter explained, apparently unaware of how awkward Draco felt. “Like I’m a different person, or need to be handled delicately, or – or like I’m going to have a mental breakdown any minute.”
“Is this…is this what the Dursleys told you?”
He could tell Leo was trying not to roll his eyes.
“No, I want to do this. I really do,” Draco said firmly. “I just have to – I don’t know – stop thinking of worst-case scenario. Just think about the best-case one instead.”
Draco raised his head and looked up, wanting to know whose hand it was. He met Leonel's dark eyes, and Leonel smiled gently.
“Of course he wouldn’t.”
it won’t be so crowded since it’s a Monday.”
Three glasses of wine later and Draco was feeling rather buzzed. He gave up on watching the true crime show (they were on their third episode by now) and instead chose to lie back on the sofa’s armrest, cradling his fourth drink in his lap.
Harry thought, and then cringed at how melodramatic he was being.
“Look, not to put my Healer hat on again but do you know what you’re getting yourself into?” Draco asked critically. Harry sat up straighter, rising to the bait. “Is this what you
"I'm your new, free, but less experienced Mind Healer," she told him seriously. "So tell me."
Draco pulled back and grinded into him again, his sweaty body hot and firm against Harry.
When Draco had first walked into her office and given her his name, she barely blinked before asking him kindly if he’d like some tea or coffee. Of course, this may have been because she wasn’t British and hadn’t been in the country during the war, but something told Draco that even if she had been, she wouldn’t really care all that much.
“I thought I’d imagined that part, but it seems I didn’t.”
He nearly dived into Ginny, who wrapped her arms around him without hesitation. He clung to Ginny’s warm body and sobbed like he’d never done before, the tears flowing freely for the first time in ages. And Ginny just held onto him like she’d never let him go.
Once again, there was no use in wondering how she knew all of these things.
With their lapse in silence, Harry could now hear distinct woops, laughs, and yells over the music and Malfoy’s smooth, sensuous voice. (Where the fuck did that come from?)
“So Harry,” Wolff said, clasping her hands together. “How was your week?”
Draco was still stunned into silence when Potter let himself out and shut the door.
"Me neither," Estrada cut in, his hand climbing up Malfoy's torso and settling at his chest. Malfoy's neck had started to become flushed as he glanced down at Estrada's hand and back up to his face. "But that doesn’t mean we can’t fuck anymore."
“I want you even more, you arsehole,” Draco said quietly, losing his strength. He looked away, unable to face Harry.
“We haven’t all been together in – what, since the end of fifth year? No, that’s not right. I can’t even remember. Fuck, Draco, why did I think this was a good idea? Is it too late to cancel?”
“But here,” Draco emphasized, “With me.”
“What? It’s a compliment. You could’ve become a songwriter, really,” Harry went on, a smile on his face. “You had so much talent at age fifteen.”
“And how are you feeling now? Any changes in symptoms?”
That was the first time he'd been really alone in his life. Even with the Dursleys, he'd been isolated emotionally, yes, but there were still always three pairs of eyes on him. He'd gone straight from there to Hogwarts to being on the run with Hermione and Ron to moving into a flat with Ginny. And then she'd left him.
“I knew we should’ve gone shopping yesterday,” Ginny grumbling, getting up from her spot on the floor. She looked down at Harry, her hands on her hips. “D’you want take-out? I can go pick up.”
“Have you started that paper?” Draco asked, gladly falling back into their usual rhythm.
“Forgive me, I’m just having a hard time believing that Granger and Weasley would push you aside so easily. I mean, if
The next night, Harry and Draco decided to drink. There was nothing better to do, and there was still leftover alcohol in Seamus Finnigan’s trunk from the holiday party. Draco watched apprehensively as Harry pulled out a half-full bottle of the muggle version of Firewhisky.
"Thank you," Draco said quietly.
“See,” Potter said. “You just laughed.”
“You look good, Harry,” she said kindly, “And I see you’ve finally gotten out of that hospital gown.”
It was break time and Harry stood awkwardly by the food and drinks table, slowly sipping his lukewarm coffee. Samuel had gone to the loo, leaving him alone.
“Are you alright, Potter?”
Draco just about melted in Harry’s arms. It was almost pathetic (and really quite scary) that Harry could still make him feel like this, even after two and a half years.
It took a moment for Draco to register what Potter was saying, and another moment to respond.
In fact, all was well until noon.
Potter’s eyes found Draco’s, and Draco’s thoughts got mixed up.
“So how did you sneak up on me so well?”
“So what kind of work do you do then?”
He shook his head again.
Draco thought that even if he didn’t tell Ira, it would make no difference. They were perfectly right in saying Draco only had one patient who’d been in Draco’s care long enough for him to develop feelings in the first place.
“Draco?”
“You interrupted me before I finished,” Betty sniffed, turning away and looking up at the ceiling.
“Luna?” Harry asked incredulously.
As she walked away, Samuel glanced at both Damien and Harry in turn.
“Yeah, ok,” Leo nodded. “I get it. It’s just – you’re…anyone would be lucky to have you.”
“Harry…”
“Any nausea?”
“You certainly don’t have to, it’s up to…” he trailed off, his eyes shifting over to Harry.
“They’re mad, the both of them,” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
“Hermione, Ron,” Harry said, his voice scratchy. He didn’t even know what to say. “I’m – I’m so sorry.”
Harry grinned. “Sure. I’ve never gone before.”
It was infuriating how Potter could still manage to get under Draco’s skin after all these years.
They all cheersed.
“I was just walking with Astoria,” Draco answered evasively.
There was a brief, heavy silence. Harry thought Draco might have gulped.
I also wrote the majority of this on my phone so please bear with me as I fix the formatting errors. Thank you!
“Think on it, at least.” Malfoy took his wand out and checked Harry’s vitals again. “Your heart rate has accelerated a bit. How are you feeling now?”
Ginny and Luna were glowing, it seemed, and it made Harry happy to watch them be so happy, so in love. They must’ve been – even if they hadn’t said it around him, Harry could tell.
Harry led the way into the kitchen, Draco following him like his life depended on it. True to Mrs. Weasley’s word, Hermione and Ron were sat in the kitchen, snacking on the gigantic spread of food before them. They looked up at the noise and grinned.
“Of course not,” Draco said sharply. He heard Potter suck in a breath and saw his jaw clench, which was interesting. Still watching Potter, he added slowly, “Though I find that talking about it to
“Well
“Fine,” Potter said, his green eyes flitting upward to meet Draco’s. “I haven’t relapsed, if that’s what you’re asking.”
“Don’t worry, Harry,” Draco said gently, and Harry’s face warmed. “I’m not working right now, and I don’t have any prior engagements.”
“Oh, ok,” Harry frowned. He stood in the middle of the room and fixed his eyes on Draco. “You alright?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “You’re so dramatic. It was just a simple warning.”
Harry was already out of bed and standing, having been pacing for the past five minutes. Malfoy looked Harry up and down, noting his street clothes. Malfoy’s mouth quirked.
When Granger didn’t respond, he turned his gaze toward Draco.
Draco pressed his soft lips to Harry’s neck before sucking gently, swirling his tongue and eliciting a soft moan from Harry. He held onto Draco tighter, fingers pressing into the other man’s back as Harry felt himself yielding and his cock hardening. Draco trailed his tongue up the side of Harry’s neck and Harry shuddered.
He quickly tidied up, sending things back to where they belonged – dirty robes, old socks, empty mugs and dishes. He made his bed haphazardly, grunting in frustration when one of his pillows fell off to the side.
guarded standing a foot away from him.
Draco gave. Draco responded readily, his hand still on Harry's cheek as he melted into the kiss, persuading Harry's mouth open. Harry was sure Draco could feel his erection through his pants but found that he couldn't care less.
“I see your detecting skills have gone unused,” said a familiar voice. “I expected better from you, Malfoy.”
Pansy sighed again. “Ok. Like I said, I believe you.”
“Did you spend the night again?”
“Well, you only have a day left, so best of luck.”
“Oh,” said Harry, who was suddenly feeling like a rubbish friend.
"Some other time, Draco. It won't take me long to tell you this: if you sincerely think he's in a good place now – both physically and mentally, then I think you're fine. You have a good sense of judgement and if he's looking and acting healthy, I can't find any reason to not do what you'd like. And you haven't been his Healer in over a year, so there’s no more pesky power imbalance. It's very good of you to worry, but I think in this case, you're perfectly alright."
He hadn’t encountered many other students in the corridors as he made his way to the Owlery, but he kept his head down as he walked anyway. He couldn’t meet the eyes of those who hated him, those who were disgusted with him, those who ignored him. He didn’t want to force them to have to look at him. But by doing this, he’d almost missed Potter as he passed by.
So now he sat around Grimmauld Place, where he’d been living in since the Battle. On the days he was especially restless, he’d go through and clean the house, looking through it and half-hoping he’d find something interesting of Sirius’. Kreacher would chase him around, telling him to lie down and rest.
with each other.”
“Oh,” said Malfoy, his mouth turning into a frown.
“Harry,” she whispered, her voice thick. “I’m…”
His gaze fell to the oval-shaped scar on Harry’s chest. He touched it delicately. Harry shivered.
“So, what’s wrong?” Ginny asked.
St Mungo’s. Of course.
Granted, it was almost only when Draco had skipped a meal or had gone to the loo to throw one up, but Potter was speaking to him. He continued to corner Draco, sometimes coming into the bathroom like he had the first night, which Draco
“It’s to do with Harry. Potter,” he added nervously when he saw her face. “I know you don’t really approve of my friendship with him, but it’s important to me, and obviously, you’re important to me, so I need to share this with you.”
“I visited my mother over the weekend,” Malfoy said. His voice was softer, less sharp - different from what Harry was used to. Even during the trials his words had had some bite. “At my old home. I still don’t feel comfortable there. Mother thinks I just need more time, but I don’t know if it’ll ever feel right again. It’s difficult because I love my mother, and I want to see her, but I still want to separate myself from that house, my family…and my past. Not entirely, of course, but it’s even harder to move on when I’ve got to go to that house so often.
Draco stiffened. Harry was incredibly close now; he could smell the alcohol mixed with something else that was uniquely Harry. He could see his chest rise and fall with every breath.
Harry’s eyebrows rose, and then he smiled.
Malfoy visibly relaxed, brushing away strands of hair that had come loose. Harry took this time to study Malfoy, his hands, his hair, his sharp face –
“You saved me.”
Remembering Ginny’s words, he walked inside the restaurant. It looked quite posh, all sleek and black and modern inside. The maître d’ perked up at the sight of him.
Draco decided to go with the straight-forward approach.
And without another word, Draco left the bathroom, going as fast as he could without actually running, leaving Potter gaping and still kneeling on the dirty, tiled floor.
“No, that’s not – you don’t need to do that. It was nothing.” Harry tried a smile. “Let’s just drop it.”
“What, just like that?”
“This is already very helpful,” Draco reassured. Granger nodded, though she didn’t look too convinced. Draco pushed on. “Did you ever notice Potter drinking excessively?”
Draco chanced a glance at Potter. He seemed surprised.
A heavy weight slowly permeated Harry’s chest through all the alcohol.
Potter kissed enthusiastically, passionately, just like Draco always imagined he would. Draco kissed back, open-mouthed, trying to put as much feeling into it as possible; he rested his hands tentatively on Potter’s chest, the cloth soft underneath his fingers and palms. Potter was warm and he felt good, tasted good, and he forgot what they were even arguing about a few minutes ago.
