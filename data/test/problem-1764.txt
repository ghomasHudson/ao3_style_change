“It’s so lonely you know?” Harry sighs in sudden false sorrow, buoyed by his success. “Hermione has a date she’s all in a flap about, being so secretive and all… If Seamus and Dean don’t go together I might just reevaluate everything I know—and Neville and Ginny!” he cries, placing the back of a hand over his forehead dramatically. “The betrayal! I thought I’d be all alone! With Ron, of course.”
“By the way,” Ron says as they sit down for dinner, “Hagrid asked me to tell you to meet him at his cabin at midnight. With your cloak.”
“Enchantingly nasty,” Dumbledore replies. “I especially enjoyed the description of my senile incompetence. Very succinct.”
He barely remembers getting back to the dorm that night, but man do his feet feel it when he finally gets into bed. Not even thoughts of dancing and snogging and strong hands and painted lips can distract him from his exhaustion, and his consciousness ends up drifting quickly away to the sweet serenade of kitten purring and Ron’s snoring.
Dennis’ guess is the best they get before the unidentified looming object draws close enough to be discernible. Rather than a house or a dragon, the Beauxbatons’ transport is a ginormous horse-drawn carriage, the horses of which are both winged and absolutely
There’s a much more noticeable tug this time, and the widest anaconda Harry’s ever seen bursts through. It doesn’t quite have the length of the python, which truly is
Harry licks gravy off his bottom lip and thinks about that, and definitely not his newly understood attraction to his rival. His rival who just admitted he was thinking about going to the ball with a man. Ron makes a choking noise opposite, but otherwise doesn’t say anything.
“You have robes over here.” Cedric points to a set of Gryffindor red robes, suspiciously similar to his seeker’s ones. Harry hums.
Sirius’ box is the most exciting. Inside is a small penknife, chrome and with a dark wood grip, including tools to unlock any lock and undo any knot. In the lid of the box is a note and a small photograph. On it reads,
The fourth and closest dragon is a sleek, oil-slick purply-black, petrifyingly menacing and reptilian and making the most horrendous screeching noise.
Neville’s baby tree-climbing moles chirrup noisily a few places away as Parvati feeds them bits of sausage.
Malfoy opens his mouth but Daphne Greengrass beats him to it. “Oh, he palmed them off on my sister, didn’t he!” she giggles. “She isn’t feeling well tonight and wanted to rest so she took them upstairs.”
“I was just coming to look for you!” Harry hears him say. He laughs to himself, slipping through the silent, well-worn corridors of the castle.
“Dobby!” he cries, shuffling backwards so quickly he almost falls out of bed and smacks his head on his nightstand. “What are you doing here?”
Harry braces himself for the incoming tirade, feigning occupation when Cassiopeia tries to latch her claws into his jumper sleeve to climb out.
“Where else?” he asks, though he has no idea what he means. Are they sure butterbeer is non-alcoholic?
“All right, Potter!” George Weasley shouts in his ear. Suddenly, he’s hoisted into the air and sitting on his shoulders.
The grounds are cold, and Malfoy was right to wear his heavy cloak. Harry’s is usually up to the job, but he still shivers every time the wind picks at them with its daggers. The whispers and mutterings of the forest sprawl over the grounds. Something chirrups nearby, but it’s too dark to see what.
The front doors swing open behind them. Everyone in the Entrance Hall turns to watch as the Durmstrang company stride through. Krum is out in the lead with a gorgeous girl in blue robes that Harry doesn’t recognise.
“I’m sure you’ll be fine,” Hermione sighs. She’s holding open the door and smiling in that way that means she thinks he’s funny.
It crashes into the spot Harry was in just a moment ago, leaving behind a gaping maw of broken slate and splintered wood. He ducks and rolls again as
The five tromp around the castle walls to stand beneath the Gryffindor dormitories. Looking up, the tower is dizzyingly tall. He can barely make out his open window until Neville leans through and sticks his arm out to wave.
figurehead leader. (Harry does not even think to include himself on such a list, despite his regrettable fame.)
Harry stumbles and adopts his most earnest innocent bystander expression. Behind him he can hear Malfoy muttering, but he’s more concerned about Ron’s death grip on his arm.
“Make sure you don’t stay up all night worrying about me,” he smirks, handing over the box. He leans in and taps the noses of all eight kittens. “You look after him, all right? Wouldn’t want to harm his delicate complexion.”
He doesn’t particularly care about them—expected it, really. No, it’s the Ravenclaws’ distaste that becomes so disheartening. He thought, as they had no particular allegiance other than to Hogwarts, they may want to support him too. Unfortunately, they don’t like the idea of such an important artifact being tricked, or the idea that Harry is trying to earn himself more fame.
“Cool do,” he tells Nott, who has finally been relieved of door duty. He nods, and hands Harry a chocolate frog from the table.
He hums and twirls it around his fingers. It emits a number of beautiful pink and gold sparks that flicker and sparkle. Squinting, he stills the wand to examine it.
“Hmmm… Dragons can fly, can’t they? But I don’t think Dumbledore would let them loose around so many people, he’s not
“Luck of the draw, probably,” Ron says, crunching into another biscuit swiped from the dessert selection. If Madam Pomfrey finds him, on his head be it.
Harry gets down to dinner with plenty of time to tell Ron, Hermione, Neville and Gin all about the ceremony, but mostly what a cow Rita Skeeter is.
is the best way to go, even as the severed head of his haddock drops with a dusty thud to the flagstones. “This is a traditional celebration of the Triwizard Tournament, and a valued opportunity to socialise with our foreign guests. The ball will be open to those at fourth year and above, though you may invite a younger student if you so wish.”
After barely half a minute of dancing, she says, “Oh, there they are,” and switches to Millicent Bullstrode.
Shrieks and yelps of “Where?! Where?!” and “Ouch Ron! That was my foot!” rise up around Harry. He grins and turns his head with the crowd. Arthur Weasley’s words from the World Cup campsite come floating back to him—”Always the same,” he’d said. “We just can’t resist showing off when we all get together.”
“I told you he likes screaming,” says Theodore Nott, an unexpectedly vicious member of the snowfight and in the middle of wrestling Neville off his back.
Harry takes several huge breaths of air, letting the cold sting his lungs. He holds out his wand and yells into the din.
“The first task is dragons,” Harry says in a rush. “I saw them last night, and Charlie said he thinks we only need to get past them, but—”
“All in working order,” he declares, holding it out for her to take. “Mr Diggory next, if you please.”
The others nod in gleeful agreement, deciding suddenly that they actually aren’t tired at all. Harry turns back to Dobby and tries to give him his kindest smile.
“I would have said yes, promise,” Ginny snickers, “even if it’s because going with you is better than not being able to go.”
Behind the door is a small classroom with most of the desks and chairs pushed to the walls. Five have been lined up top-to-tail in front of the whiteboard and covered in red velvet, and the middle of the room is empty. Sitting at one of the desks is Ludo Bagman, who is chatting away to a witch in magenta robes. Fleur, Krum and Cedric are off to the side, talking and laughing pleasantly.
Cedric is grinning, quite visibly trying not to laugh. Harry’s chest goes tight and suddenly his neck is too hot, almost sweating.
Harry stands up and steps forward, smiling and nodding slightly to Viktor. Viktor gives him a tiny smile in return, and it’s more encouraging than any of Gryffindor’s cheering has been all week.
“Okay, well, thank you very much for telling me,” Cedric says. “You know you didn’t have to, right?”
“Yeah, let’s,” Harry agrees, if only because his mind has gone completely blank of all other words to say. They stumble into Ron and Blaise outside the Entrance Hall and Harry only barely has awareness enough to tease about it. Ron, thankfully, is too distracted himself to notice Harry’s preoccupation.
Beauxbatons ends their display in front of the head table, bowing deeply with a flourish of silk and fluttering paper flowers. Harry watches one float down in front of him to land on the new tablecloth. They’ve somehow matched the colours to the houses, and he must admit that it’s rather impressive.
“Harry!” Hermione calls, some time later. Their Quidditch talk has attracted Angelina, Fred, Katie and several others, so as well as Ginny having made herself comfortable partly on Harry’s lap and Malfoy sitting on the back of the sofa, swinging his legs, they have a small gathering on the floor at their feet.
“You have glitter on your face,” Harry tells Draco when he reclaims his seat. Draco rolls his eyes so dramatically Harry thinks he’ll strain them.
Cassius makes a show of rolling his eyes and doing exactly the opposite, flying straight over to Alicia, Ron, Maxine and Cho. Malfoy mounts his broom.
“Just in case, Potter,” he says, louder, for people to hear. “Wouldn’t want you seen crying those precious tears of yours.”
He swerves under the viaduct bridge and keeps low, forcing her to go over the top. The chasm offers him no protection so he heads towards the castle, flying from tower to tower. She lands on their rooves and sends tiles skittering to the rocky ground. She smashes windows with her claws and her tail leaves feet-long gouge marks in the stone. She bellows into the sky and holds onto the chase.
Harry can feel Malfoy’s breath tumbling over the backs of his fingers. Harry’s other hand has found itself holding his side to steady them both, just beneath the curve of his ribs. He feels a flicker of something warm as Malfoy—the absolute
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you. Good night, I’ll see you tomorrow.” Harry swishes the cloak over Malfoy’s head. He appears in the corridor, disgruntled and blinking and with flyaway hair. Harry turns and makes sure to scuff his feet as he walks away.
“You all right, Hermione?” he asks. She and Ron pick their way over, minding the number of people they’ve collected.
At the bottom of the stairs they’re met by a refreshed babble of excitement. Harry spies Ginny over by the fireplace in something pink and odd-looking which Lavender looks to be assisting with amending. Parvati walks straight up to Angelina Johnson and taps her arm, indicating Ron and Harry still hovering by the dormitory stairs. Angelina quirks a brow at Harry but wanders over anyway, looking quite gorgeous in sleeveless mulberry velvet.
“What kinds do you ’ave ’ere, Charlie?” Hagrid asks. He’s gazing reverently at what Harry assumes is the horntail, one of the ones Charlie was talking about over summer. Its yellow eyes are still open a horrifying slit.
“Careful, Potter,” he says. Harry bites his lip and stamps down the urge to tell anyway. He catches Malfoy’s gaze and winks.
Harry goes to bed shaky and clammy and wakes much the same. Ron throws his socks at his head (Harry realises he’s been trying to pull his hat onto his left foot) and pulls him into a tight hug.
The horntail roars and lands on the other side of the tower roof with a bone-aching shudder. Her claws screech and her tail whistles through the air.
Shaking his head, Malfoy flicks his wand at each one. “Why on Earth you thought this was a good idea…”
The parchment isn’t signed, but in the corner is a small pink star. Harry brushes his thumb over it and smiles when the words
They stand around for almost half an hour. Harry’s wand arm is aching, and he’s sure Neville is tired too, pulling the broom up and down between them. It works, mostly. About half the time.
The water twists, tornado-like, and grows both towards the floor and the ceiling like roots and branches of a tree. Harry realises, a second late, that a tree is exactly what it is. The branches shatter into an explosion of leafy canopy, throwing rippling shadows onto all four walls.
Harry, hovering at the edge and leaning on the side of Hermione’s chair, picks up Asclepius to try to hide in his fur.
At her recommendation, both Harry and Ron drop a spoonful of the stew next to the rest of what they’ve piled on their plates. The golden lion handle of the serving spoon roars under Harry’s hand, making him jump.
“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” Fred asks, presenting the platter with a hell of a flourish. Harry watches as she looks from Fred to the tarts and back to Fred, utterly unimpressed. Fred, the loon, grins.
“Most impressive,” Mr Ollivander repeats. “I’ve never used Veela hair myself; I find the wands they make are rather temperamental. However, if it is as fine as this… To each their own.”
“Of course, you’ve stared death in the face before, haven’t you? Would you say that’s affected you?”
“It’s not meant to, is it? She does insist on blathering on about things no one understands, but she’s harmless once you realise that’s just how she is.”
Draco clicks his tongue, but Harry can see the red rising to his cheeks. “All the Weasels are here, it must be time to brace for impact. I’ll go and find Cassius for you, George, shall I?”
“Harry Potter is very welcome!” Dobby squeaks. “I have to go now, we is making Christmas dinner.” He disappears with a sharp pop, and Harry looks over to his friends and their presents.
Hermione lifts her nose from her books at that, smiling widely. Ron looks greatly taken aback, and the eyebrows on both twins have climbed their foreheads. No one around is listening, keeping the moment blessedly private.
to our humble Hogwarts School this evening. Please be sure make yourselves at home and enjoy your stay to the fullest. The tournament will be officially opened post-feast, so I say: dig in!”
Hermione huffs. “Cedric’s not an idiot, you just don’t like him because he beat us at Quidditch. I’ve heard he’s a top student,
“Yeah,” Harry says, steering Malfoy inside with him. He steps out from under the cloak but keeps hold of it. “What did you want me for? Is there anything I can do for you?”
Harry realises that the other Slytherins are also wearing the badges and sneering at him. He grins and taps his own, thoroughly satisfied by the flashes of shock over their faces.
“They rely on magic to survive,” she explains. “Mr Crouch letting Winky go was an abhorrent thing to do, with that in mind: he could have killed her, if she hadn’t ended up here. No one wants to hire a disgraced elf, because allowing them to live on their magic makes them too vulnerable to take the risk.”
Harry, pulled farther and farther into the crowd, grins around at all of them and holds the egg aloft. “Who wants me to open it?” he yells. The response is deafening, but he keeps them hanging on anyway. “Huh? Shall I do it? Are you sure?” Neville throws a cushion at him and he laughs, finally twisting the catch and letting the thing fall open in his hands.
“Ron, the new popular man?” Seamus shouts. “Get the news while it’s hot! And I really do mean smoking!”
“We brought this down from your room!” Seamus says, handing over the heavy, gleaming golden egg Harry’d won from the dragon. “You haven’t opened it yet, have you?”
. Harry gets jittery, tapping his fingers against Malfoy’s ribs and shifting from foot to foot. Malfoy turns his head ever so slightly to scowl, so he stops. The gaze pins him to the wall, uncomfortably hot, pressed into the shadows as they are.
“Don’t trip me,” Malfoy replies. Harry rolls his eyes but says nothing, leading them down the steps of the castle.
“There!” shouts one of the older students. They wave their hand in the direction of the Forbidden Forest, and the whole school turns to look.
Ron is, in fact, building a card tower on a table in front of the common room fire with a pack of exploding snap cards. It’s like building a normal tower, but with the added thrill of the possibility of it blowing up at any time.
“…When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished,” Dumbledore is saying.
“Any bigger and Hagrid won’t be able to handle any of them,” Harry says. “That’s if he hasn’t already been attacked by something.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, and clears his throat. He turns back to Draco and suddenly finds the need to look anywhere but at his face. He’s embarrassing himself.
“Bagman said it was February twenty-fourth,” Harry replies, half-distracted by the conversation between Hermione and Fred. “At least, I think he did. I hope so.”
Harry turns and summons the dragon book to himself. It, too, after a little encouragement, takes an unrefined leap towards him. He decides that as long as it gets to him, he doesn’t really care if it smacks him in the face.
There’s an outcropping on the other side of the stadium that Harry knows the dragon can’t reach. He dives for it and gets a claw-graze to the back. He thanks whatever the hell will listen that it isn’t worse and tumbles to the ground behind his cover, broom in hand.
He keeps his head down, ducking between Ron and Hermione to avoid extra attention. Buzzes of mutterings follow him everywhere like a swarm of unsettled wasps.
Hermione flusters and tries to hide herself back in her papers. “Nothing of the sort.” Ron and Harry exchange surprised glances.
She hoots lethargically, dips her beak into his goblet of juice, and takes off again for a good long sleep at her perch.
“Excuse me, I am nothing like our a lovesick fool of a brother. I, for one, have some pride and decorum.”
“This is good,” Malfoy says. “You have a good chance of it working when you need it to, as long as you remember to focus on intent.”
“D’you think it’s those blast-ended skrewts?” Ron asks. “They were looking on the large side on Monday.”
Harry flinches and releases Draco’s hand hurriedly. His sweaty palm burns with the remnants of sensation.
From a distance the students had looked to be built much the same as Crabbe and Goyle, though nearer Harry can see that the majority of their bulk is thanks to the thick fur cloaks they shoulder. Each one is well kept and worn with pride, but a single sleek, silver pelt stands out from all the rest. A tall man with matching silver hair strides beneath it, right up to Dumbledore to take his outstretched palm.
The third is dangerously red and spiny and trying very, very hard to spear the stars on each burst of fire. Its body roils and undulates, liquid, and its scales glint with magic.
“Blimey, look at those spines,” Hagrid says. Harry peers forward and does indeed see dozens of razor-like spines all along the dragon’s tail. Horntail indeed.
“All right Hagrid?” pants Charlie Weasley, coming over to talk. “Should be all right; we gave them sleeping draughts before we left. We
Harry doesn’t bother to point out that no one else knows he’s been helping, and, actually, are highly unlikely to doubt anything after one look at his grades.
“Stand back there, Hagrid!” yells a strained but familiar voice nearby. “They can spit fire twenty feet! I’ve seen this horntail do forty!”
She waves her hand about vaguely. “We ended up busier than expected, I got distracted, and Draco refused to join me most of the time. What is the news with you?”
The door flies open, buffeting them with air. Cedric stands in a halo of light, bright white light, like Harry’s guardian angel sent from… Uh… Hufflepuff.
Harry holds open the door for her and smiles widely as she passes. She rolls her eyes and taps his own robes a few times with her wand. The black shifts minutely to a dark bottle green.
“Come on in, then, there we go,” she says, ushering him inside and onto a cardboard box. She upturns a bucket to sit herself on before closing the door and plunging them into darkness.
“Anyone who wishes to enter the Tournament need only write their name on a piece of parchment and drop it into the goblet. It shall be placed in the Entrance Hall tonight, to be easily accessible, and aspiring champions have twenty-four hours during which to submit themselves. Tomorrow night, the goblet shall choose whomever it deems worthy to compete for each school.
“You’ve gotta catch us first!” Seamus grins and hares off across the grounds. There are a lot more magical projectiles in the air, after that.
The doors to the Great Hall creak open, and the inward procession begins. Harry waves to Ron, who looks a bit like he’s going to be sick with nerves. He and Blaise wave back. Malfoy stalks past, gawks at Hermione, and then to everyone’s surprise, nods to Harry. Even Harry would have passed it off as a greeting to Fleur had he not met Harry’s eyes as he’d gone by. Aren’t they all full of surprises tonight. Harry’s beginning to feel bloody boring in comparison.
Hermione frowns for a moment, but stashes the galleons back where they were. “Never mind. What were you saying, Fred?”
To his intrigue, Harry feels his t-shirt straighten, press itself, and then tuck itself into his jeans. The jeans then begin to shrink and change, pulling up to a proper length and fitting more closely to his thighs and calves. She seems to have kept them slightly loose still, how he likes them. Lastly the jumper shrinks in, morphing from moth-bitten and a bit lumpy to sleek and new and sticking to his ribs.
Harry feels as if his wand is more of an extension of himself than a tool at this point, but he isn’t going to say anything.
They set off through the castle, out over the lawns and to the lake. The morning of November first is a cold one; mist is rolling down again from the mountains, curling in drifts around the forest, wrapping tree trunks with cotton. The air is frigid and a little on the icy side, but it’s refreshing and comforting and relieves Harry of his newfound claustrophobia.
Harry looks over to where Nott is pointing, catching sight of Neville talking to a pretty blonde in an orange and green dress by the fireplace. “Yeah, looks like it.”
“Potter,” sneers a dreadful, drawling voice from a few paces behind them. “What are you doing, skulking about?”
“Now now, Viktor!” Igor Karkaroff says, cutting across a genuinely interesting description of life at Durmstrang.
“We brought you this,” Hermione says, holding out two chocolate croissants wrapped in a napkin. “Maybe we should eat somewhere else.”
Hermione looks up and meets their eyes shyly. Harry feels like breaking all formality and shouting across to her, but manages to settle for grinning madly (again). Parvati seems to be vibrating out of her skin, nodding encouragement despite her obvious shock. Hermione laughs and relaxes into Viktor’s side, and Harry is happy for her.
“Hermione and Ron both have mystery dates they’re not telling anyone about,” Harry says gleefully, passing her a bowl of beef stew. She digs in gratefully.
Harry leans as far forward on his broom as possible, heading for the rocks at a terrifying speed. “Molliare!” he yells, pointing his wand at the ground. He pulls up tight and slips off his broom, ducking into a roll on landing that almost turns his ankle. The horntail screams, and he’s on his feet before he catches his breath.
“I don’t think they’ll miss me, somehow,” he agrees. Draco hums again and sets his glass down on the table, shrugging off his outer robe and tucking it over his arm before strolling towards the large, open doors. Harry’s brain stammers and he follows automatically, enticed, he tells himself, by the bite of the breeze that skims its way through towards them from outside. He wonders if there was something he didn’t know about in his drinks.
“Do you think that the trauma of your past may have made you more keen to prove yourself? To enter the Triwizard Tournament—”
“Mmm,” Hermione hums, not looking up from her revision. “You don’t exactly seem to be pushing yourself, though.”
Harry remembers that day in Ollivander’s four years ago with incredible clarity, what with the way he had waved nigh-on every wand in the shop. That means he also remembers what had been so curious, and he rather hopes Mr Ollivander is not about to announce it to the whole room. Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement.
The tile he’s holding onto slips and Harry goes with it, picking up speed even as he scrabbles to catch hold of something.
“Right then. Meet me in the Entrance Hall tonight,” Harry says, making sure he’s quiet this time. “Get Zabini to watch the cats or something.”
He thinks of Cho, then, and the way Ginny looks at him sometimes when she sees him enter the room. As previously established, Hermione is one of his most invaluable friends, but still objectively very pretty. He thinks of Ron's easy laugh and the way he scrunches his brow and chews his tongue when he concentrates. Now that he thinks about it, he decides that Dean and Seamus seem to at least fancy each other a little bit—the tiniest bit, so quiet, the kind that comes with loud public proclamations of love in the corridors—and that Cedric
“Just get past them, I think. At least I hope so—they asked for nesting mothers, which is suicide in my opinion. But no one did ask our opinions.” He sighs. “I wish Harry hadn’t got caught up in all this. I pity the one who gets the horntail, and with his luck…”
Harry collects the kneazles from Hermione’s makeshift playpen and places them in their soft little beds.
There was a fiasco with a cockatrice in 1792, but if you want to know more, then you can go and read it yourselves. Though, that book isn’t
In robes of dark bronze that make his eyes swim like molten metal, Florence stands at least a foot taller than him, even with only a short afro and Harry’s tragedy of a mop. He gets them about a quarter of the way around the floor before he finds who he’s looking for and winks to Harry.
The last and only time Harry had felt this way at Hogwarts was in second year, when the school thought that he was the one attacking them. The Slytherins throw barbs at any opportunity, some enterprising third-year starting the increasingly common shouts of
“Ronald, Harry, Hermione!” Fleur greets, sitting herself opposite, between Ron and Dean. “It is good to see you all.”
"I'm not famous anymore." Harry almost laughed, a twitch at the corner of his mouth despite the evident tension throughout his body. "Not like that, at least."
Draco stood up challengingly and Harry mirrored him, his wand in his hand before he knew it. His eyes flicked to Draco's hands which were still wandless, but his face told Harry that he wasn't making an empty threat. A shiver went down Harry's spine at the pure ice he saw in Draco's grey eyes, and it made his stomach drop uncomfortably.
"I…" The man couldn't seem to get a grip on himself. He was looking at Draco as if he might get hexed at any moment, and Draco hadn't ruled it out yet. "I can't be sure."
Students are piling out of the stadium entrance, all of them cheering and chattering excitedly. Harry can hear the Gryffindor chant in the distance.
“I almost died!” she protests, swatting at his shoulder. “You’d’ve been crying too if you’d been me!”
Harry turns with Parvati around the floor at much the same pace as the others. She smiles and he manages to keep off her toes, and they take the lifts with an awkward fumbling even if they do manage to land them, in the end.
Regardless, Harry, Ron and Hermione are very much not looking forward to their next class. Wandering around trying to avoid as many of their year as possible, they make their way through the clocktower courtyard. It’s Malfoy’s day with the cats, and Harry’s wondering if they shouldn’t start taking a few each and sharing the load every day.
Beside Harry, the Weasley twins stand suddenly, each lobbing something straight up into the air. Two large sparks zip from their palms across the hall, leaving a trail of shifting colours as they arc and swirl, crack and spark and set off the occasional firework.
use transfiguration as a punishment! Surely Dumbledore explained this to you.” She swishes her wand and the Malfoy they all recognise tumbles back into existence.
“Come on,” Hermione says. “We need to get back for Charms. And after that you’re writing to Sirius, Harry. He’ll want to find out from you and not the paper, I’d think.”
A shimmering blue magical shield swishes over everyone’s heads and forms a tunnel down the centre of the hall. Into one end steps sixth-year Roger Davies from Ravenclaw, just as Slytherin’s Adrian Pucey steps into the other. They stride towards each other, wands out, and bow, turning and taking their steps away. The school choir stands and launches into an epic ballad. Pucey and Davies take their stances, shout once, and throw themselves into their duel.
As usual, the table in front of them suddenly finds itself laden with a multitude of dishes. It seems the house-elves have really outdone themselves tonight, with the array of foods Harry leans in to look over. There are pies and casseroles and escallops and pasta dishes and potatoes done every which way, and he’s fairly certain that no two platters are the same and half of them he’s never seen before. Looking over to the other tables, he sees even more mouth-watering foods.
“Who knows,” he replies, eyes wandering around and looking anywhere but at him. “So, has the great Gryffindor champion found a suitable partner?”
“Go on, now, go see Madam Pomfrey before you get your scores,” says Professor McGonagall, shooing him away.
“That’s pretty out-there, Harry,” says Seamus. Harry feels very lucky that his dorm mates have finally come around to believing him. “Good job on gettin’ away with it, at least.”
“Well I’m glad you’ve actually done something yourself, Potter, but we’re hardly any closer to finding a strategy.”
“Shame.” Malfoy takes a drink from his own goblet. Each of their silences seem to be getting more awkward, as if that were possible. “Are you leaving the cats in your dorm yet? I think they’re old enough. Granger said something about it.”
He says it loudly enough for Ron to hear, but he doesn’t give much of an indication that he’s listening.
Harry flies up, up, as fast as he can, away from the stadium. With every glance over his shoulder the horntail gets closer and closer still. His broom tail is smoking gently.
Their professor gives them one of her looks before resettling herself and taking another breath. “Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age, I would like to talk to you all about the upcoming Yule Ball.” Several of their classmates visibly perk up at the mention. Harry decides that
“Shall we go?” Parvati asks hopefully. Harry, shamelessly copying Fred, offers her his arm. She smiles and takes it, and they make their nervous way down to the Great Hall. Hundreds of students are already milling around the Entrance Hall waiting for eight o’clock when the doors would be thrown open. Parvati almost runs quite literally into her sister, who twirls about in matching robes of turquoise on the arm of Terry Boot. They hover around, chatting to passing friends and gaping at some of the weird and wonderful and gorgeous sets of robes that flounce by.
Hermione’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Really? Not that I’m complaining, but you don’t usually like to accompany me to the library.”
“Behave yourself,” Harry warned lightly before pinching Draco’s arse. Draco responded by spanking Harry on the arse before running ahead to avoid further retaliation. When they made it to the stairwell, Harry watched as Hermione strode down the stairs two steps at a time.
Things had been so much easier and straightforward when he had just hated Harry. These other feelings...being friends with him...it just made things more complicated. The last thing that Draco needed right now was to make his life any more complicated than it already was.
“Obviously,” Ginny drawled. “It is a romantic tragedy, Harry. What did you think you were going to do—duel him?”
Harry turned to Draco and gave him a wicked grin, “Well, I’d have to spend the night before I could make my mind up about that one way or another.”
“Well, I can’t bloody well see them from here, can I?” Harry laughed, moving closer to Draco. He screwed up his eyes, the better to see, and leant forward until his and Draco’s faces were only inches apart. Draco held his breath and felt his heart beat harder in his chest. It was strange, having Harry so close to him like this; usually one or both of them would have their wands drawn by now. But what really took him aback was Harry’s eyes. Draco had never noticed how green they were before. They were the hue of the Forbidden Forest, dark but much more inviting. If they were anyone else’s eyes, he might have even said that they were beautiful. Draco didn’t dare move as Harry moved even closer, so close that Harry’s breath tickled his lips.
“Just curious,” she replied lightly. “We went to school together, you know. He was a couple of years ahead of me but I knew him through the Slug Club. And we’ve crossed paths from time to time at the Ministry.”
“Traditionally, Muggle Studies has focused on the history and daily lives of Muggles and how they are able to live without magic. This year we’re going to apply greater emphasis on understanding Muggle society from a historical and sociological perspective. There will also be more practical elements integrated into the course; combining both these written and practical lessons will be essential to passing this course…”
Harry shrugged. “Dunno. Maybe they’re talking about the play, they’ve got a few scenes together, don’t they?”
“That wouldn’t be doing it the Muggle way, would it?” Liv pointed out. “This will be ideal to use for rehearsals until the construction of the real stage is completed. Now, if you could all follow me backstage, you’ll find work stations where we can create costumes, set pieces and scenery.”
“Sorry,” Myrtle replied mildly. “After you’ve been dead for a few decades, you can’t help but let your perspective on life—or death, whatever—become a little morbid.” Myrtle slid off of the cistern that she had been perched upon and floated down in front of Draco. “Don’t take this the wrong way but I’m sorry that you didn’t die during the battle.”
“Is that the one who had his photograph on the back of the book?” asked Harry. “He looked a bit like Beethoven?”
Liv hesitated a moment before admitting, “If I’m completely honest, at that point in time the First War was escalating and I wanted to get as far away from it as possible.”
“Out of her favour where I am in love,” he replied, casting another furtive glance at Draco as he spoke. Ginny tsked and slapped him on the arm with her script.
Minerva gasped as the desk burst into flames and the parchment quickly shrivelled and turned to ash. Liv slashed her wand through the air again, causing several jets of flames to fly across the small office space, exploding on impact as they hit cardboard boxes, sending paperwork, ash and red hot sparks flying in all directions. As she raised her wand to strike again, she paused as she heard loud banging and angry, muffled voices coming from her office door.
Harry flipped desperately through his script searching for the scene in question, hoping that this was Ginny’s idea of a terrible joke. “I’ve been pretty busy lately in case you haven’t noticed! Where’s this scene that you’re talking about?”
Harry felt a swell of irritation rise up inside of him then: she was the one who had asked to see him, so why was she playing games with him? He managed to keep his voice even when he replied, “No, Professor.”
“What did I say, Hermione? We can’t leave Harry unattended for more than a few minutes without something disastrous happening to him,” Ron joked. “Who’d have thought that crossing paths with a lion would be the least dangerous encounter we’d have today? Those fire seeds should come with a health and safety warning!”
They spent the next hour practising and Harry slowly started to improve. As the evening grew darker and clouds covered the moon, they were suddenly plunged into darkness. Draco cast a Wand-Lighting Charm, bathing them both in pale white light and suggested that they call it a night. But Harry, feeling confident, insisted on having one more shot.
“Because, as you pointed out yourself, I’m more than qualified for the position,” she reminded her. “I possess a unique combination of skills and experience that others can’t bring to the role. I have over twenty years of experience in Muggle Liaisons and I have faced a lot of unique and challenging cases, but as I’ve already demonstrated, I’m adaptable to any given situation.”
“Yeah, I kind of am,” he laughed, walking in step with Draco. “Is that true? Were you going to leave Hogwarts?”
Ron grumbled something incoherent in response before he squared his shoulders and turned to face Harry. “Alright, I can’t think of any other way to improve this monstrosity. Let’s make tracks and get this over with.”
“I’m joking, Potter,” he smirked as Harry blushed furiously. “Don’t get your knickers in a twist. See you later, Scarhead.”
None of the professors looked in Harry’s direction as he approached; instead, they were listening intently to the Patronus (a nightingale, Harry realised), which stood on the Headmistress’s desk as it spoke in Madam Pomfrey’s booming, authoritative voice.
Liv’s heartbeat quickened as Hestia took a step closer to her, reached over her shoulder and pulled a book from the shelf behind her. Her heart sank when she saw the front cover of the book Hestia had picked up—another copy of
“I swear, that toad will be the death of me! I suppose he’s doing well enough, he’s still escaping at every given opportunity. Thankfully, I’ve got him safely locked in his tank at the moment,” he said nodding towards the glass box stowed in the overhead compartment.
“You lot sit here in your ivory tower, telling us that we ought to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and get on with things,” Dennis spat. “That’s be easy for you to say, especially when you haven’t lost anything. People lost their homes. Their entire families. The right to do magic. My brother
While Hermione chattered away about her ‘promotion’, Draco (and by the looks of it everyone else) quickly tuned out. Just as he was beginning to regret coming over here, he felt Harry’s hand brush against his own. He cast a furtive glance at Harry, whose attention was focused on his plate as he finished his breakfast, toast held in his right hand while his left one tentatively reached for Draco’s under the table. Draco’s heart thudded so hard in his chest he was surprised that nobody else could hear it. Slowly, Draco intertwined their fingers and Harry gave his hand a slight squeeze in response. If anyone walked past the Gryffindor table right then, they would see the two of them unmistakably holding hands, but all he could focus on was how warm and smooth Harry’s hand felt against his own. Okay, so secretly holding hands might not constitute a public display of affection in Myrtle’s book, but they were taking baby steps.
“This is a hospital, not a frat house!” she fumed, pocketing her wand. “Either you both behave in a civil manner or I will enforce lights out before supper. Is that clear?”
“Has she lost the plot?” he hissed, running in after her with his wand drawn, closely followed by Harry, Neville, and several other curious students who kept their distance and remained close to the exit.
The noise in the Great Hall faded away as Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, casting her stern gaze across the returning students.
“Well, whatever I am, it hasn’t made finding a girlfriend any easier,” she joked. “Mind you, with everything that’s been going on the last couple of years, I haven’t had much time to look for anyone.”
“You really want to tell them about us?” he asked uncertainly. “Because yesterday you didn’t seem all that keen. Don’t get me wrong, I understand why, and I’d love to tell them about us, but...Draco, what’s the matter?”
Draco nodded. “And when you took my wand, I felt like a part of me was missing. I wasn’t able to get a replacement, so I had to master the basics of wandless magic, but it was difficult because I’d grown so accustomed to channelling my magic through my wand. So…” Draco picked up Harry’s quill. “I had to improvise. I imagined that a quill was my wand and that I was channelling my magic through that. Once I learned to do that, I discarded the quill and now I can do wandless magic with my eyes closed.”
like it!” Draco jabbed Harry in the chest. “Kiss me like your life depends on it! Because if you don’t, we’re going to fail this class and we’ll both be up shit creek without a paddle!”
“How have you been getting on, Myrtle?” he asked, his eyes fixed on Draco as he performed loop-the-loops above their heads.
It may have been a small and childish rebellion, but his options at this point were limited. Hogwarts, loath as he was to admit, was probably his best option. He knew that his mother believed that she was acting in his best interests, but he would have appreciated being consulted in the decision-making process. But then Draco had seldom been consulted about what he really wanted, all the big decisions in his life being made for him. He supposed that he should be used to it by now. That realisation depressed him immensely.
“We’ve just met and I’m trying to convince you to kiss me.” He cleared his throat and began to recite his lines, “If I profane with my unworthiest hand, this holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.”
Dennis drew her an incredulous look. “The fact that you even need to ask that is part of the problem!”
“Uh, yeah. Just...give me a minute to warm up,” he’d said with a nervous laugh. But try as he might, he could not rise to the occasion that night. Ginny had been understandably disappointed but Harry had brushed it off simply as his nerves getting the better of him, sure that next time would be different. But it wasn’t. After their third failed attempt at intimacy, Ginny had sat Harry down for ‘a chat’ and asked him if he had something that he wanted to tell her.
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. Harry suddenly realised then that the shouting had grown quieter. He peered out of the canopy again to see his friends heading back towards the castle, the argument still in full swing. He turned back to Draco to tell him that the coast was clear, but Draco was staring off into the distance at nothing in particular, his expression serious. Harry gave him a light shake to get his attention.
Neville snorted with laughter at the shocked expression on Draco’s face. Although Harry knew Luna better than most, she still had the unique ability to leave him speechless from time to time. He and Draco looked uncertainly at one another before turning back to Luna, who continued to stare back at the pair. They had expected the topic of their not-so-secret relationship to come up at some point, but certainly not before they had even reached Hogwarts. Luna, however, was more intuitive than the average witch; knowing her, she probably knew what was going on between Harry and Draco before they did.
“Alright, I didn’t realise you were so sensitive about it,” Draco teased. “I suppose your hair isn’t all bad. The permanently unkempt aesthetic rather suits you.”
Dennis rolled his eyes and turned back to the task at hand. “It’s a balcony covered in ivy. And no, I don’t need help, certainly not from you.”
“True,” Draco agreed, keeping his tone even. “I must learn to accept that my reputation is in the dirt. My family name is in ruins. Despite remaining considerably wealthy, it seems unlikely that we will be able to buy our way back into high society’s favour this time around. But it may have escaped your notice, Potter, that I don’t give a shit what anyone thinks about me. Most people didn’t like me before the war anyway, so what difference does it make if they’ve got the balls to say it to my face now instead of behind my back?”
“If you really believe that, then you’d best remove Severus’ and Phineas’ portraits from these walls.”
“I do,” said Hermione enthusiastically. “I mean, Shakespeare wrote the part to be played by a man, so I think it would be interesting to keep it that way but in a more literal sense.” She looked expectantly between the two boys. “So...what do you think?”
“It’s not as if you gave me a choice!” he snapped, tossing his bag onto the floor and flopping down into the seat in front of him. The script glided over his head and plopped onto his lap, appearing quite benign now. Liv took a quick swig from her mug of tea before holding out a plate of turkey sandwiches to him.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked, leaning in. Blaise leant back in his chair, crossing his arms over his head.
They both started to the school, wands in hands and looking around the grounds for signs of danger in case someone decided to attack or Filch appeared.
It's Harry's turn to snort at that, a small beginning of a smile at the corner of his lips. "Wanker."
" then got jabbed in the ribs by the Slytherin's pointy fucking elbows. He hissed and stomped on Malfoy's foot.
"Severus left a few minutes ago. Said he'd be back soon." Sirius said to him, letting go of Harry with a ruffle of his hair. Harry was beaming at the man, and the tension in Draco's body melted away slightly at the sight.
Draco aimed, note between his fingers, then threw. The note whipped through the air aerodynamically, so fast he almost lost sight of it's path. Harry's arm immediately shot out to catch it, not even having to have looked at it first, to Draco's dismay. He should have expected it from the best Seeker in the school besides him, but it still stung his pride anyway.
The air immediately felt sucked out of his lungs and he could tell Umbridge felt the same. He suppressed the tightness in his chest, constricting his lungs and threatening to stop him from breathing. Right now, he felt almost as if he’d been split into two people, the one speaking and the other deep inside him: much more genuine to his true self and growing in horror at what the one who was speaking was saying. He just had to get through this, though. Just a bit more time…
"You may all collect your materials and begin the first steps of the Potion." Snape drawled, snapping Harry's attention as people around him begun to get up and collect ingredients. He nudged Ron next to him, whom unfortunately looked as out of it as Harry was.
“It’s worse than yesterday.” he heard Ron mutter when he examined Harry’s hand, but other than that, there were no other complaints or objections.
" Ron echoed him with great pain. The only thing keeping Ron going was Harry's hand around his arm dragging him to the Gryffindor Tower. Harry relied on muscle memory alone to get him back to his dorms, and only once they neared the portrait of the Fat Lady did he finally realise something was missing.
“First Year, remember?” Harry rambled hurriedly, “As soon as I touched her, my scar stung, I swear, Ron.”
in the other. He nodded and absently picked up a croissant and bit in to it, barely tasting it. Blaise, luckily, seemed busily involved in simmering in the aftermaths of his outburst and didn't take notice of Draco's attempts to move his head around in search of Potter at the Gryffindor table. Of course, the table was all the way at the other end of the hall, but that never stopped Draco before.
"Yeah, er. Well we started fighting first, then I said some thing about his father, and he started on the mudbloods, blood-traitors bullshit again."
"MALFOY!" Harry yelled, startling the boy awake with a harsh snort. His eyes immediately found Harry and he
"So I stopped watching Malfoy, and I started watching you, Harry." Hermione said, "Of course, you had the Tournament so I couldn't fault you for being a little distracted and…odd at times, but something about you and Malfoy seemed off even back when you told us about the Ball. I could tell then that you weren't saying something, but I decided to let it go thinking it didn't matter since it was...well, Malfoy."
"Yes." Harry said noncommittally, shoving it into his lap. Draco's hands immediately went to grasp the soft fabric, seeing his hands disappear beneath them. "Just until after the task. You can use it to come see me afterwards, since you're so worried I won't come back."
He felt Ron’s hard gaze on the side of his face and didn’t have the heart to look him back in the eyes. Ron sighed resignedly at his hesitance, and they continued the walk back in silence.
"I…erm." Draco trailed off, looking the most inarticulate Harry had seen him yet. "Right." He said bluntly with a hint of fake nonchalance, "And why would they…not care, exactly?"
Ron smiled, thankfully unbothered by Harry’s forceful cheer. In fact, Ron almost looked as tired as he felt, but he looked content, which made Harry feel so, too.
"Mhm. Which shade?" Ron asked, still working. Hermione just shrugged vaguely, walking back to her table.
"I know, Draco. He was in Hogsmeade and he practically lives in his Animagus form, so he's alright for now." He assured. "He wanted to talk about the Tournament, and then he spoke to me alone after - Ron and Hermione were there too by the way."
"What's got you so chirpy this morning, Theo." Blaise prompted. Theo just shrugged, but looked excited Blaise had asked anyway.
"I…" Harry started, then looked around. The twins and Ginny her busy talking, but he glanced at Hermione and signaled to the door for them to leave. Hermione understood immediately, her eyebrows shooting up and getting out of her chair. When Ron begun to protest in confusion as they filed out, she pinched him on the arm and he let out a yelp.
"Thank you." Harry murmured in to the boy's shoulder after a moment of fragile silence, and he meant it more than anything in the world.
"I was the one that got her out." Harry said simply, but he didn't want to talk about himself at the moment. He looked at his watch and saw they had been gone for an hour and nobody seemed to have noticed. All the better for him, he thought. The Ball was a drag.
"Don't throw the books! And both of you, stop messing around!" Hermione yelled, and all quickly turned back to their respective tasks dutifully.
"No, mate. It's okay. I understand. It's like being back at the Burrow." He siphoned their questionably coloured potion in to a vial, "I love my brothers and Ginny, and Mum and Dad," He said, "But living with them sometimes drives me up the bloody walls. Especially when Percy comes to visit. It doesn't mean I still don't love them - even Percy. I just can't be around them all the time." He put a stopper on the vial and held it out to Harry to carry to Snape's desk, where the man himself was looming. "So I get it. Okay?"
Not every night, but the good majority. He thought that Voldemort would be the one to haunt his dreams as he slept, but instead it was Cedric's lifeless body. On the nights he managed to sleep, he would see him, clear as day as he lay on the ground of the graveyard. It was always the same moment. The split second when Harry's eyes had flicked to Cedric's body before the pallid green light of the killing curse had even left. It crawled over Cedric's skin, reflecting in his eyes. Harry had felt his own skin tingle from the malevolence of the magic that he was horrified to feel felt
"Hey, was it you who laughed at my joke during Potions?" Harry asked, now feeling daring and confident speaking to the other boy. He saw Malfoy flush and look away, and Harry knew the answer.
Had Draco been a more prideful sort person, things may have gone differently after that night. Much to his father's distaste, however, Draco had always had his mother's demure, more sensitive attributes in him than his father's ruthlessness and strength. Not that his mother wasn't strong, but his father tried his very best to change those parts about Draco the most in his childhood. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't act how his father wanted him to for a very long time, and he was often stuck in between being himself like his mother, or taking the role of who his father wanted him to be.
Luckily Pansy was still in the Common Room, chatting to Bulstrode and Blaise. Without stopping, Draco called out, "Parkinson, Zabini. With me." And he disappeared in to his dorm room. He knew they would follow.
"I take it the egg is being no good?" Draco asked, hoping Potter wouldn't lash out at him like he assumedly did to Granger and the Weasel.
The door knocker sounded. Walburga's painting gurgled something indiscernible. It was probably Harry!
“You mean that as in, where Level Three is meant to keep archives safe away from others, Level Two is specifically meant to just be kept away?” Blaise asked. “As in hidden?”
last line is the image of Harry smiling at himself in the mirror despite having been sick and looking like shit on old shit. Cruelly, and unforgivingly.
Ron and Hermione nodded dutifully. Draco stiffened, but his face became softer and eyes grateful. "Thank you." He whispered shakily.
Draco took the opportunity to rip back the curtain fully. For a split second, Harry thought they were looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being tortured. Draco backed away immediately as the woman, drooling from the corner of her mouth and screaming with her yellowed face stretched taut, placed her eyes on him. It was then that Harry realised it wasn't a window, but a life-sized portrait. One of the most realistic, yet unpleasant he'd ever seen in his life.
"This is good." Theo muttered as he looked between their parchments and made adjustments. Draco saw Blaise gesturing out of the corner of his eyes, and side-eyed him.
," He shouted at the room full of adults, "You can expect none of my cooperation about anything important for a very long time!"
"Yeah, of course." Harry said. "But aren't they the adults? They're literally the Order itself, at that. Maybe we should just trust them?"
"Alright! Look. I asked him to the Ball to make himself look like a fool. I never even fathomed he would have agreed, Ron, I swear. I'm sorry about Parvati, I really am." And to hopefully calm Ron down a bit, he added, "And I'm sorry we aren't going to go with the twins together."
"Yes, and?" Harry couldn't help but snap, and Ron quickly looked back down at his plate. Harry looked down at his own as well, having forgotten he was at breakfast. There was food on his plate, but he hadn't put it there. He reckoned it was Hermione who had, but she never knew what he really liked.
Draco shivered, wondering why Albus Dumbledore was trying to tell him he was merely as mortal as everyone else when he was supposed to be the strongest. The reason why Voldemort was still where he was and not ruling the wizarding world.
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech. The sudden sound, now next to Harry through the draped curtains he'd eyed the day before, caused him to trip and fall over one his feet.
, "Please just let me do this, Harry." He shut his eyes tightly, willing away the way they stung when opened, "I can do this. I need to do this. I don't know who I'll become otherwise, so
Turns out that Blaise’s mum’s new husband worked in none other than the Department of Magical Archives, as what Draco later discovered was the position ‘Head of Archival Organisation’.
"Watch it, Scarhead." He spat, almost wincing when he remembered Potter telling him how his scar hurt sometimes, "Not everyone has to move aside in the halls for the Chosen One." He successfully garnered a few looks from people around him. He fought the urge to look back at Potter as he walked away, but heard a weak, "Fuck you, Malfoy." just before he turned the corner. Draco felt a stab of worry at the lack of conviction or strength in the boy's tone. It was a pathetic response, and Draco wondered for a moment if Weasley and Granger had something to do with it.
He looked like a completely different person to the one he knew for the past three years. It's almost like the boy grew up in to someone else, and it made Harry feel very strange.
And it took a moment for Harry to realise that it wasn't his own voice in his head saying those things. It was an amalgamation of his Aunt Petunia's and Uncle Vernon's, so clear he would have thought they were next to him. Coarse voices sifting through the slits of a cramped cupboard under the stairs.
The day after the Ball, Harry had sat down with Ron and Hermione in the Common Room while everyone else was at breakfast. Harry sat on the floor in front of the fire and Ron and Hermione were up on the couch in front of him. He spent a good ten minutes trying to get Hermione to comprehend the fact that he went to the Ball with Malfoy willingly.
"I should have just taken the cup." Harry drew back, looking up at Harry with a tear stricken face and haunted eyes. "He killed him because of me."
"It's not your fault if he'd done some sort of Dark Magic ritual on you or something like that." Ron said, smiling back. "But Hermione stopped me before I could go get you when we figured it out. I was almost about to use the map before you gave it to Moody."
“Shit, Pans, let's round up the little brats.” Draco hastily got out of his seat, choking down one last mouthful of juice down his throat as Pansy followed.
"I'm sure, Harry." Draco glanced at his watch. "Now you need to get up, or Arthur will be late. You have a hearing later, I hope you remember."
“I’m not saying we should.” Draco snapped angrily, “But we can’t exactly let him get whatever it is, especially if it’s for Voldemort.”
"Me neither." Harry matched his awkwardness unfortunately, and cursed himself for looking like a prat with his hands shoved so far deep his trousers they might as well be peeking out the hems.
Draco sighed next to him and turned over, his hands cushioning his head. He murmured something in his sleep Harry couldn't decipher, but found it amusing just the same.
"What if he messes it up? Slips up when it matters most and makes a mistake? Being in the position that he is…"
Harry woke up in the same position he'd fallen asleep in hours later, and the sun was just beginning to disappear in to the Lake horizon. He looked over and saw Draco still on his side facing away from him, hushed, even breaths marked by the steady rise and fall of his shoulders.
, this year. I’m not just going to let you get into trouble, especially for my sake. That wasn’t what we discussed back at Grimmauld.”
to seeing Harry. "He's…" The man paused, trying to find the right words. "He's been hurt. Don't make it any worse. I'm hanging on to the trust Harry placed on you, so don't disappoint me. Alright?"
“Look at today!” Ron whined. “History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day!
" He screamed, a burst of white light forming a radiant stag from his wand. The Dementor immediately coiled away, and the stag fought it off with it's antlers. He watched it wane away with his arm outstretched in anticipation, blood thrumming with fear and the last remnants of declining despair the Dementor had brought with it.
Before he knew it, it was dinner time and he barely had time to spare a meal before detention at five o’clock. He wolfed down some well-needed sustenance for the evening ahead of him. Hermione seemed to have forgotten her ire with Ron and was now vehemently discussing - or lecturing by the looks of it - the importance of time management. Harry’s stomach gave a lurch as he heard them mention homework, thinking of the pile of undone assignments he had upstairs in his dorm.
Harry tried to act naturally but knew he was failing. He plastered a hopefully genuine smile on his face.
to Harry. Did that night at the Ball really have that much of an effect on him? Harry decided to keep his guard up regardless, however. Merlin knew what motives he had.
“Oh, I will!” The woman replied excitedly. Draco flashed her a smile that always had his mother’s friends gushing over him and turned to leave, Pansy following sullenly behind him.
Snape's eyes flashed maliciously, then he leaned in and whispered infuriatingly, "Think about that next time,
"Gay?" Remus filled in for him, and Draco nodded. "Well, not quite the term I'd describe the two of us."
Harry woke up to Hedwig tapping on his window, and he immediately jumped out of bed. He quickly scrambled to throw on his glasses on to his face, and barely suppressed a whoop of joy when he saw a letter in her claws.
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?”
Umbridge hesitated for a moment, probably running through their conversation from the day before. Harry knew what he’d said, but he hoped that maybe if he acted like he hadn’t then she might just let it go…
Harry smirked, jostling Ron back with a shoulder, "And how much of that stuff you said was Hermione?" He asked.
Harry's brain seemed to short circuit, and it took all of Draco's willpower to keep a straight face.
"Right." Hermione said, unconvinced. She glanced at Harry, and for some reason he didn't want to look at her, and probably not Draco either. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk. There was something bubbling inside him as he'd watched his friend's joy. It was burning, almost painful and in complete contrast to how he should have been feeling. It felt insipid and hateful, and it's voice almost reached out and grasped hold of him.
"Oh." Draco said dully, "Where's the rest of it." Snape coughed suspiciously in to his sleeve next to him and Draco looked back down at the paper, "And what's this for?"
Draco patted him on the knee, "We'll have time to talk about it later. I won't make you go over it again."
"Sweet boy." Draco remarked, quirking an eyebrow at Blaise. The boy's eyes followed Theo as he went.
"I won't. I'll be back." He said back, the words he'd said to Draco the night before echoing out of him after having spent the entire day with them clattering at the forefront of his mind.
Harry crushed the note in his hand and stuffed it in his pockets again, making his decision. Malfoy hadn't given him a reason to doubt their ceasefire just yet, so Harry resolved to honour it and humour the boy tonight. He wouldn't tell Ron and Hermione just yet, but if things didn't go well tonight he'd put an end to things and never bother with it again. Why would Malfoy want to see him, anyway?
"I don't give a toss, Harry! You just told an ex-convict-" He ignored Harry's scowl because damn him, Draco was the one who should have been angry at the moment, "-that I was, what? Defecting? A spy? A complete idiot for trusting you?"
Harry couldn't quite get anything through his head. All he kept seeing was Cedric's limp and lifeless body laying on the ground in his mind's eye.
of the time, but he absolutely despised the fact that the man was a direct line between Hogwarts and his meddling parents. Why couldn't he left alone for Merlin's sake? Draco shuddered at the thought of his father hearing about the Potter situation. He'd have to convince Snape somehow tomorrow not to tell them.
After a while, there was a steady trickle coming from the wounds and his hand was throbbing enough to hinder his ability to hold the quill. He fumbled with it a few times, cursing when it fell out of his grip.
"Right." Harry said slowly, "So what's the secret going to be? It's got to be right, otherwise…I don't really know. I'm kind of confused right now."
"Harry, it's me, Draco. You need to get up, you're going with Arthur to the Ministry." Draco tried to say as softly as possible, mindful of the snoring Ronald behind them. Merlin knew how Harry got any sleep at all with how the ginger practically
"Snape's got points to take off of me, so let's hurry!" He called out behind him, and was promptly followed by Ron and Hermione, whom were very confused indeed.
Ron's grip loosened over his arm when Snape was gone, "Blimey, Harry." Ron muttered. "I wouldn't put it past him to actually slip you some one day."
Blaise thought for a moment. "Depends." He said, "Do you want to keep the scary Malfoy Heir act up, or do you want to keep going wherever it is you're going, and start changing how people see you."
“Bugger.” Pansy sighed, twirling her quill in one hand with her empty parchment in front of her. “I almost even agreed with the Gryffin-idiots yesterday. Merlin, she’s
Harry's eyes shot up to his in surprise, and Draco raised an eyebrow. Without a word, he picked up his bag and left the class in front of Harry and Weasley without looking back.
Harry turned around triumphantly, looking to share his great joke with someone who understood fine humour, only to see none other than the last person he possibly wanted to share this moment with.
"I trust you know what occurred that night when the Diggory boy perished?" His father inquired casually, and Draco's heart almost stopped.
Harry brought out his cloak from his pocket, horrendously balled up. "Keep the cloak for me." He said, handing it to him.
Without a word, acting as if nothing at all had just transpired, he retracted his hand with the same smile. “Mustn't start any rumours.” he said lowly, leaning in as if sharing a secret with the woman.
Draco winced at the sheer vehemence in Blaise's tone, but didn't feel too bad for Nott because everyone in Slytherin knew about Blaise's infamous temper. It wasn't that the boy was particularly dangerous when he got angry, but once you pushed him far enough, you'd almost wish you were
"But you have to agree to never insult my friends again. You can't call Hermione a mudblood and Ron a blood-traitor. You'll keep your bigoted views to
"Oh for God's sake. We have OWL's next year!" Hermione exclaimed. "The Ocular Replenishing Potion looks differently in colour according to the individual looking at it. It takes on a colour the individual's mind finds most appeasing, or relaxing. It's developed to soothe your eyes just by looking at it before you even drink the potion." She explained impatiently. Ron and Harry's eyes widened at each other, and they immediately started crossing out lines and replacing sentences in their notes. Harry heard Hermione sigh audibly and he praised the day they fought the troll together.
“It’s probably not even the weapon itself.” Draco said, “Just information. It’s technically my job to collect it anyway. I knew my father’s been planning something like this for a while now. It was bound to lead to this.”
Blaise stayed silent, and Draco did too after that. They both sat pensively as Draco gathered himself.
Glancing around the room, he predictably saw Harry and Ronald seeming to be playing some game on a piece of shared parchment, but what drew his eyes quickly was the sight of Hermione Granger not slaving away at the assigned work like he would have expected her to be. Instead, her eyes were fixed on Umbridge and her hand was ramrod straight up in the air.
Draco felt his knees go weak. At the threat of them collapsing under him, he walked back to the chair he’d been sitting in earlier and sat on it.
“That’s splendid,” Umbridge said, bringing out a stack of papers, presumably to mark. “Off you go, then.”
Harry averted his eyes from the close proximity between the two, but Draco saw the imperceptible shake of his head.
that?" Harry asked from the floor, breaking the tense silence as Mrs. Weasley stunned the last portrait and Tonks returned downstairs while muttering something about a Troll's leg.
"What type of punishment do you have in mind, exactly, Malfoy?" Ginevra said cheekily, the attempt to tease him not getting lost on him.
. Put him in your meetings where it concerns him, or I'll make sure everything that comes out of my mouth for this Order is a damn Celestina Warbeck number! Tch! And you call yourself adults?"
." He heard, and could clearly imagine the smug little sneer Draco probably had on his face to go with it. Prick.
First off, Draco thought, what the fuck . Draco didn't show it, but he was completely and irrevocably confused as to what Potter was playing at. Asking him to the Yule Ball? He was still struggling to process it, and his immediate reaction would have been to reject the boy outright with generous disgust. Of course, he had sort of walked in to the situation all on his own, if he thought about the conversation over again. Potter had hinted at it and he took the bait- but why even ask in the first place?
Draco felt his face heat, and he looked away. "Welcome." He gulped. "Mind if I ask you something, too?"
"…Harry?" Ron's voice jolted him out of daydream and he looked at the boy irritably. He hadn't even done anything wrong. He was just…there. Existing with no Golden Egg or Merpeople fantasies.
Remus was quiet for a moment before his hand on Draco's shoulder squeezed him briefly. "Then shall I only send you one in case he doesn't? Before school? Just in case, of course."
." Draco hissed. He stood up again, immediately drawing the attention of all the Slytherins as well as some students from the Ravenclaw table next over. Addressing everyone at the table in his most commanding, no-nonsense voice, he said,
. All he seemed to be doing was looking down, shoulders hunched, as he listened to Granger speak and the Weasel look on pityingly.
Snape's face softened just a fraction, "You need not worry about that right now. Just be vigilant, and for Merlin's sake, leave Potter alone. The only thing him and his family are good at are at getting killed." He went back to his potion, stirring mindlessly, and Draco took it as his cue to leave.
"Yeah, here." Harry handed it from his side to Ron, who stared chop and crush the Evergreen leaves. Harry adjusted the heat on his cauldron, looking around the room as he waited for Ron. As he leaned back on to his desk, back to his cauldron, he caught the glare of Parvati Patil from across the room. She was shooting straight daggers at Harry and his skin jumped. He turned back around, "Uh, Ron?"
Draco wanted to melt into his seat. Why had she made him come inside with Harry? He was just sitting there, for Merlin’s sake.
potter." Malfoy drawled when he finally managed to regain his cocky composure, "Like any Slytherin would go with you! Whoever actually agrees to go with a plebian Gryffindor like you could be the biggest fool in the school!" His composure was once again slightly slipping - Harry could tell.
"He threw himself in front of me when I was about to be cursed. I owe him my life." Harry said resolutely. Was this the same person crying in his arms a while ago?
It was Mrs. Figg, and Harry almost recoiled away. Flashbacks on uncomfortable days with her babysitting him flashed across his eyes. She was
"Thank you." Harry swung his legs on to the bed and mirrored Ron, staring up at the ceiling where the black wooden boards looked worrying to be underneath in terms of stability. His chest felt settled from resolving things with Ron, and he sighed contently, basking In the silence of the house.
He heard stomps from the top of the flight of stairs, seeing Draco doubling back to see him with the most shell-shocked look on his face as Harry lay flat on the floor.
, Blaise. Why would he keep me in the dark? For what gain? I had to admit, I was happy the Chamber had been opened. I thought it might get the muggleborns and such to leave, but I didn't know what was
you anything, Malfoy." He said with a glare, "Now shove off before I feel the need to summon Professor Moody over."
She looked down at his hand, breath hitching. Harry reflexively tried to pull away but her grip was too strong.
"Just stop worrying, Draco. That Potter's influencing you a little too much." Blaise patted his shoulder.
"What are we doing here, Harry." Malfoy whispered next to him, the sound of his voice almost a direct echo of the way Harry's thoughts had felt like just the moment before. Harry was sure if he had verbalised his feelings from earlier, his voice would have had the same wistfulness as Malfoy had done then. At that current moment, it felt as if him and the Slytherin were somewhere else than the rest of the people in the Hall. Like they were behind a glass wall and people were too blissfully immersed in themselves to notice.
"Regardless of anything I conclude over the night, Potter, how you steer a broom with two left feet is beyond me." He finally settled on, although the words didn't seem to have their usual heat.
"Right." Draco wrung his hands some more, and Harry felt a moment of irritation when it looked like the other boy
Draco shrugged. "I told them everything I knew. About this past summer and such, then they started discussing you. About the events leading to your leaving your relative's house. How you have a court hearing soon and how they might go about getting you acquitted. Useful stuff if you were even there."
"I…I don't know, Hermione." He sat back on his haunches, withdrawing his arms and letting them hand at his sides. He looked down, focusing on the faded fabric of his jeans. "I could never have imagined we would get along this well. I never imagined that he was…like this. After the Yule Ball and that truce, it's like he didn't have to pretend anymore, so I actually saw
"Don't even start." He bit out, but was only met with a chuckle. Did anyone take him seriously anymore? He was reconsidering his decision to go ahead and build himself a new reputation out of mutual respect rather than fear. It was Blaise's idea, of course, but now he had to
"Fine." Draco said resignedly, face indifferent and eyes closed off. "Just go." He turned away from Harry, and it only made him angrier that he was being brushed off so easily.
“You okay?” Ron asked next to him. They were squeezed on the same armchair they’d sat in on the night of the Yule Ball. Harry was pretty sure it was a much tighter fit than last time, accredited mostly to Ron’s large growth in height as opposed to Harry’s lack thereof over the last few months.
, Harry. It was just an idea I had, and it's barely even backed up by the author of this thesis. I'm just saying we still have time to keep looking-"
Harry emptied whatever was left in his stomach into the sink. When he was done, he shook his head for Ron to see, who was standing frozen at the entrance to the bathroom. “M’ fine,” he said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “Go back to-”
Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face. “Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”
“Well a little Inter-House Unity wouldn’t be too harmful, now would it?” Hermione said. She leant over the table surreptitiously so they both could hear her as she whispered, “And this thing with Draco...Do you think it has something to do with it?”
"Ugh-" Blaise bumped in to his back. "What is it now- oh, for Merlin's sake." He swore when he spotted the compartment. "Draco, no-"
“I….” Umbridge said, smoothing over a single wrinkle on her sleeve primly. “I do recall...something about...”
, lighting the two boy’s faces in front of each other. Harry looked down at the letter in Draco’s lap.
pile, but his arm was stopped just before he could place it down. "Don't touch me." Draco sneered at Weasley's grip on his forearm.
Harry just laughed at the blatant lie, but didn't say anything more about the subject. He knew Malfoy liked the spot as much as he did. He wouldn't have been out there studying if he didn't.
"Harry, go!" Draco hissed at him, not looking back from Moody. Harry didn't quite understand. Draco wanted him to leave? Harry didn't want to leave. Would that mean Draco would have to die?
"That's a bishop." Ron muttered back immediately. Harry sat back and decided to leave the game to Ron to win, and watched Dean whisper something in Seamus's ear, whom smiled a bit as if they weren't talking about chess at all. Dean's eyes flicked to his and he gave Harry a once over.
terrible things to muggleborns and about muggles for majority of his life. He'd gone as far as singling them out, bullying them-
"- And I also realised Malfoy had been oddly…unprovocative towards any of us since December. In fact, he seemed to be ignoring not only the three of us, but I never saw him have a go at anyone else in the school either. He's completely stopped being…Malfoy."
"No. I'm glad I know. He might have just kept lying to me until the Dark Lord showed up on our doorstep one day as the guest of honour." He saw Malfoy shudder, and Harry shuddered too. "I'm sorry I said those things about
“Wow!” Draco gasped, looking at Blaise to share amazed looks. “It’s much more complex than the Archives are given the reputation for.”
In a spiteful haste to get back at the woman, Harry hit the ground running at the start of the evening and went through three sheets of parchment (written double sided, as courtesy of the toad) by the half-way point of his detention. At that point, though, he was starting to feel light-headed so he slowed down. The pain in his hand was astounding by that point, leeching all the way up arm.
"Uh…What's wrong exactly?" He asked wearily. Ron was already blooming in colour, his complexion now clashing with his dreaded maroon robes. He turned on Harry angrily, and Harry fought the urge to take step backwards.
Shaking, he straightened his body out. Buckbeak rose again, and beside him stepped Harry. He bowed slightly, gaining an accepting bow from the bird, shorter and more curt than the one it had given Draco.
He buried it deep down, where memories of a long corridor and cold skin lay unbeknownst. They settled together, waiting, biding time. Coiling like a snake ready to strike…
"Good." She said. She walked up to him, holding out a hand to shake. "Call me Hermione from now on, then."
"Good. Merlin knows you'll actually have a chance with her around to help you." Harry bristled at Malfoy's tone because it was so often used to antagonise him and his friends, but now it was almost like…he was complimenting Hemione.
A sense of despair then settled on him that wasn't far off from the feeling he'd get if a Dementor were near. What would he do now? He was
"See you tomorrow." She said without looking back. He quirked his head. Merlin, she wanted to see him for tea
"Oh-" He heard after a moment behind him. "Buckbeak! There you are!" Harry said gleefully. The damn thing screeched happily, and Draco swore, shutting himself in the nearest room.
He still couldn't believe it an hour and some later when Harry finally emerged from the depths of the Lake, bringing with him his ginger friend and another blonde girl.
"I know." Harry said. "It'll be fine. If they really want to attack me, they'll do it tomorrow if anything."
Both Remus and Sirius smiled sadly, and it made Harry want to look away. His friends around him watched on with looks in their eyes that just made him angry, as if he were some sort of injured animal.
She stared at him for a moment before nodding and leaving him alone in the kitchen. He itched to go and see what the news was about Harry, but his knee had begun to throb, and it stung every time he tried to put pressure on it.
He clenched his hands tighter to his sides, his back feeling like it was stuck with a bloody iron pole. They continued in silence again, and Draco had never felt more uncomfortable in his life. Was the whole summer going to be like this?
Draco came down the stairs to the landing where the curtains were screaming, Harry noticing his wand drawn. The boy peered at the curtain as it threw senseless, guttural cries.
They still had five minutes left, so Harry took the time to scan the crowds. He saw a few familiar ginger heads among the crowd, and he smiled to himself. After that, he spotted a spot of white amongst darkness, contrasting deeply with the dark night they would have to navigate the maze in.
"There's another war coming." Draco said, ignoring Blaise's question. Blaise didn't seem to notice, "What? A war?" He gasped. Draco nodded gravely.
Draco strode to the Dungeons with his usual Malfoy regality, all the while is heart was hammering in his chest. The weight of what he had just done was starting to painfully sink in.
"There. Just have a few pieces. It's alright with me, really. I'm full from this." He said surely, holding up his apple then taking another bite. He watched Potter nervously stare at him in shock for a few seconds then look at the food again. Thankfully this time, one of his hands unwrapped from around his knees and reached towards the food hesitantly. Draco held his breath as Potter seemed to contemplate the action thoroughly, then breathed it out in relief when the boy reluctantly picked up a small piece of the croissant. Without a word, he turned back to the sun and munched quietly on it, taking small bites as if he was savoring it.
"You're lying!" He gasped, and Potter just shook his head smugly while obviously trying to hold back a laugh, "That's insanely unfair! Bloody Hufflepuff's!" And Potter finally let out a loud laugh at Draco's dismay.
"Well I don't bloody seem to be getting anything out of it, so what's the point." Harry said angrily. He spun Malfoy again, just managing to refrain from letting go of the boy and hoping he spun all the way in to a ditch somewhere.
.” Harry snatched up the letter and stabbed a finger at it, “Be realistic, Draco. There’s no way we can do both. I’m here to help you, but we really can’t do anything like this when you’re throwing out every possibility you think of. What’s more important, stopping Voldemort from getting that weapon or getting Umbridge off your scent?”
"He's not here." Draco replied tiredly, but opened his eyes anyway and saw Harry standing over him looking obviously worried about something. His eyebrows were furrowed slightly and his hands were clenched at his sides. "What's wrong." Draco said, eyes narrowing. Harry started, then stuck his hands in his pockets.
“Two days…” she muttered horrifiedly, staring at his hand as if it were diseased.  “It should have been alright...It should have been covered up…”
"Oh, aren't you two darling?" She said, picking up an apron and drawing it around herself. "Then since you're both here, Harry, you can start on the eggs while Draco and I make the batter."
Harry held out his hand evidently and Ron frowned at it, thick eyebrows furrowing. “It’s ugly.” he said, making Harry snort.
"Erm…By the way." Draco started, reaching the last few steps with Harry and halting him as the others went inside the kitchen. "Mrs. Weasley…She looked mad at me earlier. I'm not sure what I did."
"Ah, you're awake. Finally." A voice drawled next to him. Not just any drawl. Harry squinted at the figure next to him. He was sitting down with a book open on his lap not far away. That explained the paper sounds. He didn't know if it was better than just being his own books flying away to Malfoy sat primly next to him.
"Oh god. What will my friends say?" Harry realised with horror. He touched his head as if it might get up and walk away.
"Your things are already on the train." His Mum informed him, his father standing stiffly at her side.
for expecting a normal year without Harry Potter for once." Malfoy laughed, and Harry scowled at him. "But how on earth did it happen?"
He was also a member of the Order, which was why Hermione explained Ronald’s theory (yes, their Ronald. Who would have thought?) that Podmore had been framed by the Ministry itself. Given Draco's current opinion of what the Ministry stood for, he wouldn’t have been shocked if that were the case, and reluctantly agreed with the theory.
"Fine." He turned around and started digging inside his bag some more. "Just keep the door open. And here-" He tossed her his wand. "Just in case anyone walks in and thinks I'm going to hex you."
"Oh. Alright then." He saw the boy flush and cross his arms over himself, and Harry could tell he caught him off guard. "I won't."
"Enter." His father's voice sounded from behind. He exhaled quickly, then opened the door before he could scare himself out of it.
"Blimey, trust Malfoy not to have a sense of humour." Ron muttered and Harry wacked him with his textbook.
Harry stretched languorously and rolled to Malfoy's side with an elbow propping up his head, "I don't wanna go up there." He rolled back on to his back. "I like it out here."
"Sit down, Potter." She said when he entered the kitchen without turning around. "I have much to tell you."
"Hermione - who are you going to the ball with?" said Ron. Harry and Hermione surreptitiously shared a look behind Ron as he strode out the Great Hall between them, his gaze kept forward with a forced nonchalance that had Harry rolling his eyes behind his back and Hermione smirking in return.
" Draco said sharply, rising off the chair. "Let's go to bed." He beckoned Blaise up and waited for the boy before walking to their dormitory together in silence.
"Right…" Sirius said, looking between them. He sighed deeply, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Always something with you, Harry." he said resignedly, turning away and leaving to guard again and leaving them alone again.
"For a Malfoy, you're quite keen." The man said. Draco swallowed nervously, a lump in his throat. Moody stepped in and locked the door behind him.
It didn't occur to him until two weeks in to the holidays that he and Draco, were in fact, still actually friends. A lot of things didn't occur to him these days, so it wasn't that surprising. Some nights after a nightmare, as he lay awake in the darkness, he might sometimes manage to convince himself that some things were true while some weren't. He might even switch facts around, like on one night when he'd woken up believing Ron was still mad at him for the tournament, but Cedric was still alive and well. It wasn't as if he had anyone or anything to talk some sense in to him, except for when he pulled back his shirt sleeve to see the jagged silver scar on his arm, and realised the latter wasn't true.
"The Dark Lord will not have blood-traitors serving him. You are a disappointment to your family name, Malfoy. How
“Harry.” Ron exclaimed, out of breath as he slid down to Harry’s side. “We- The Keeper tryouts just finished and I saw
an idiot for a while now. What’s going on with you? All you do is get angry nowadays. It’s one thing to be it with your friends and classmates, but a teacher? Really?”
"But you're not really playing along on our side." Harry added. Draco nodded and Harry finished, "You're actually on our side, but you're pretending you're not so you can get information from
"Didn't Harry tell you what?" Harry asked, suddenly beside Draco with a bag of Doxies in hand. "What did I not tell him?"
Draco said again without looking back. Harry didn't reply, and ended up standing there and looking out to the lake until a grey cloud obscured the sun from it’s direct glare. He looked back, having been deep in thought, and found the other boy curled up in the same spot, sleeping. Still barely thinking about anything at all, he watched Draco until the cloud over them passed through, and the sun began to shine down on them again. Harry's shadow no longer cast over Draco, so he was suddenly bathed in an ethereal light that had Harry looking away quickly, as if being caught looking at something he shouldn't have.
"I gave them my Triwizard winnings last year." Harry said, picking up fallen Doxies off the ground and putting them in to the bag.
Ron stared at him suspiciously from a moment and finally nodded, looking back at Hermione. The girl was seething, and Harry could understand why. Why did Ron have to be such an arse? It was absolute horrible timing.
He also felt a stab of something sour in his gut from the letter. A complete contrast of the warmth it also brought him. It was when he'd read about Draco's training with his father. Harry felt…jealous? Why would he feel jealous about that? Draco was literally being trained to become a Death Eater, to possibly kill…
Harry considered throwing himself in to the fire very seriously at that moment. It genuinely had no downsides except agonizing pain. No Tournament, no Parvati, no dancing and most of all, no Malfoy! Harry sighed dreamily at the thought.
“Are...are you done? Can you sit down now?” Ron asked carefully when he showed no signs of being any sicker. Harry felt hands around his upper arms, pulling him away from the sink and leading him to sit on the sill of the single green-tinted window in the bathroom. He briefly wondered where Myrtle was, as there had been no sign of her for the last two days.
"Exactly!" Sirius exclaimed, eyes brightening at Draco. "The man's a nut, I tell you, Draco. I've no idea how you lot deal with him as Head of House. Must be a bloody nightmare, let me tell you. Is it true he does random checks on the boy's dorms for the Slytherins?"
He tilted his head, “I don’t think you get it, Professor. It was just me and Cedric that night, but it wasn’t me who killed him.”
Draco subsequently stopped being able to cry by the time he was eight years old. Even if he might have wanted to, he would repress it almost immediately and the urge became almost non-existent. It was like his body had been dried of tears completely, and so he tried to compensate for the lack of feeling by lashing out. He begun to mimic his father's anger and barking tone. He found himself getting jealous of others and irritated much more often. With everyone except his mother, Draco began to become his father and rid himself of his heart.
"Second year? Diary?" Harry prompted as if it was obvious. Malfoy just continued to stare at him curiously.
, not a child. There was no reason for her to look so proud about anything at the moment, and it chilled Harry to the bone at the sight.
"I don't have time to explain it." Draco said, not caring if he sounded desperate and pleading, "But something's not right. Please just believe me."
"You're already pretty threatening to the rest of Slytherin, Draco. You might just end up petrifying a First Year, if anything. Everyone thinking you're also the Heir of Slytherin won't be gaining you any favours."
He went to his drawer and dug out a few owl treats before giving them to her and finally managing to extract the letter from her grasp. Draco blamed the fatigue completely for the way his fingers shook as he opened the letter.
His body felt as if on fire as it kicked in to a fight or flight response while also adjusting to the frigid temperature invading upon the room. He heard a faded scream in his ears, but it was so familiar to him that he didn't even have to remind himself that it was from inside his head. His mother's cried filled his head as he felt himself slipping further in to the abyss in his mind, and panic gripped him so hard he felt his fists grip the sheets of his bed.
"Regardless!" Draco chimed in, "Why on earth are you here?" He pointedly ignored what Potter said, and tactically ignored that he ignored it.
He felt a pang of sadness that he locked up inside so it didn't show up on his face. He said nothing, and continued staring at the fire.
Cho was Cedric’s girlfriend. She can’t seriously like Harry after that, can she? Even if she did, it would be weird if he even initiated anything. Things between them felt weird, anway…
Harry blew out a tired exhale, slumping back against the headboard of the bed. "I do know that." He said resignedly.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” There was a cold edge to her surface-level sweet tone.
"Wait, you don't…you know, agree with everything your father says?" Harry said, turning to Malfoy quite confused and deciding not to pursue the dickhead comment for the time being.
Harry's eyebrows rose, amused, "Ah, I see." He stood up, brushing off his jeans. "Fine. I'll do your portion of the cleaning too, tomorrow."
"Not really, I mean he really just told me we would talk about it. We were almost about to start a fight in the middle of the bloody dance, so I had to agree."
Ron followed him without a word, then without a word patched up his hand like the day before. Harry let him, his chest warm at the trouble that Ron was going to just for him. He also felt slightly guilty, remembering how the boy had covered for him during breakfast.
"I don't hate Granger and Weasley all because of their blood. And I don't actually hate all of the mud-muggleborns in our school." He took a deep shuddering breath, "But you have to understand who I am. Who my family is. If I don't think like them then I'm just as good as a squib in their eyes. I…" He broke off, looking more and more lost as he spoke. His white robes stood out brightly in the darkness, and the moonlight seem to favour him specifically, to Harry's chagrin. "I know my father was…one of them. In my family, it's an
“I’m glad. Not spreading anymore of those nasty lies again, are we?” Finally, she reached into one of her drawers to bring out the quill, holding it out.
"Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” Draco drawled, sweeping away a stray strand of hair that had fallen over his eyes. "Wouldn't want our golden boy to get punished on the first day, now would we? If we're going for a track record, however, that may be one of
At Harry's quirked head in confusion, Draco explained, "The newspapers talk about you. Not good things. They don't believe you or Dumbledore and are rapidly trying to denounce him to the public."
"That's not what I mean." Draco waved a hand flippantly. "Think about it. Has Dumbledore ever asked you what
"They'll expect Polyjuice before anything else, so we'll be fine." Draco said with a tentative smile, finally glancing at Harry.
"Well I had help for most of it, you know? The first task I had Hagrid showing me the dragons, then Cedric and you for the second task. Even Moody's offered to help."
Before he knew it, he'd peeled the sweaty clothes off his skin and showered once he'd gotten back to his room. Wincing the whole way, he changed in to his night clothes and limped in to bed. His body buzzed with fatigue, and he knew he'd be in much more pain tomorrow.
"Then eat, you daft bugger." Draco said, and added cautiously, "And this way you won't have to go all the way to the Hall for breakfast." Potter looked back at him curiously for a second, then back at the food. "Go on. It won't bite unless you do." Draco said a little more softly. He felt a moment of horror when he found he sounded somewhat like his
The buzz from the Great Hall grew more eminent as they approached, and Harry begun to observe the slow trickle of Yule decorations leading to the hall. Small charmed snowflakes began to fall elegantly around them as they neared, and Harry saw the champion lining up at the entrance.
They stood in front of a dreary row of houses, all desolate and pressed closely together on the lane of a muggle street in London. Draco's stomach churned uneasily from the press of Apparition just moments before. He let go of Professor Snape's arm as soon as they landed, and Snape started towards the houses without a word.
"Draco, wait." Harry said, halting the boy's talking. "We have class soon, but could you tell me about it later?"
"Right. Well, Sirius was my Godfather." He looked at Draco curiously, "I'm not sure if that was public knowledge or not."
“Oh, because you’re...you!” Hermione snapped. “Harry knows what i’m talking about, right Harry? At the end-of-term feast last year...”
"Wow, Malfoy! Just wow!" Harry begun to fake clap, "Another orphan joke! How do you do it! I had no idea!" He stopped clapping and took a threatening step towards the boy, looking down at him with nothing but seething hatred and getting the same look back up at him. "Don't you
"I don't want you to think that you have to figure everything out. That you have to know what's going to happen next." Harry said.
Harry couldn't help but let a small smile waver over his face. "I meant that I was sorry that you had to…you know. Be here. See it."
Then to Draco's horror, Snape told him about the ritual. The bone of the father, unwillingly taken. The flesh of the servant, willingly given, and the blood of the enemy, forcibly taken.
He started to sweat beneath his sickly coloured dark robes, wondering if maybe fake-Moody left a mark on him somewhere that didn't get healed. Was there a scar on him he didn't catch before leaving Hogwarts? He knew his mother's aversion to marks and scars on his body for some strange reason. It never really seemed odd to him until he started Hogwarts. If she saw something now, she'd surely know something was wrong. He started to pull his arm away, but her hold didn't relent.
"Sirius!" Draco called out. "Would you mind coming inside for a bit?" His smile turned in to a smirk, "Harry needs your help with something."
Malfoy dropped his quill and rustled with something on the side Harry couldn't see. A moment later, he brought up a napkin and placed it between them without a word. On it, were some pastries and the same single apple similar to last time. Harry watched Malfoy continue his work as if nothing much had just occurred, trying to gauge any sort of indication of what the other boy was thinking.
"For someone to see Harry Potter walk in and Draco Malfoy walk out?" Harry asked skeptically, raising an eyebrow.
, and his father would realise it if wasn't so blinded by his own beliefs. The belief that magic was better, that they were better because of it. Even that those born from those without were something to be scorned rather than welcomed. Had Draco really wanted to be like him for most of his life? No, Draco
, Potter? Well that means you've got a date to the Ball. The champion must be drowning in requests to sweep them as their date." He prompted, making a sweeping motion with his arms. Harry readjusted his grip on his wand, his hands unexplainably sweaty. He knew he had asked Parvati not long before, but he still couldn't get used to the idea of actually taking her, and at this point was seriously considering feigning sickness on the night of the Ball, or worse, just taking Ron. Harry glanced at the boy next to him, his face red and looking at Malfoy like he was the very scum at the bottom of his cauldron. There was nothing wrong with taking Ron to the Ball, but Harry found the idea extremely off-putting every time he remembered Ron's dreadful dress robes, so he never voiced the option to the other boy. That was Padma's problem now, fortunately for him.
Blaise did roughly the same thing - some lark about their families having tea -  and they were off. Being Slytherin’s, they did get a bit of leeway to come and go between the school. The general rule had always been that if Snape agreed, then all was well.
"It won't." Was the only thing he could say, shutting his eyes tightly. "I have you, and Ron, and now Draco too."
"What are we doing here, Potter." He said, the words coming out in such a hoarse whisper he was unsure if Potter even heard them. Something flared in his chest at how plain the words came out, as if they might make a trail to something vulnerable inside Draco if someone knew to follow the path. Potter didn't look like he heard, but said after a moment,
Draco would have counted up the entire night as a hazy fever dream if he hadn't told Blaise about some of it. He wouldn't be surprised if things between him and Potter were the same as they had always been the moment he stepped foot in to the Great Hall.  Some strange part of him almost didn't want that to happen. After what he heard last night, he really did feel like things had to change. One of those things was being an enemy of Harry Potter.
“Wow…” Draco murmured, before coming back to reality and realising where he was. Dumbledore was watching him in silent thought.
Harry’s eyes fluttered as the stabbing in his head caused all other senses to fade, leaving it the only thing his brain could comprehend. It almost felt like the Cruciatus, except that the majority of the pain was focused on his scar. He genuinely thought his head might split open all over the floor of Umbirdge’s classroom.
"I will." Another lick of flame wove itself around them. Harry felt the sensation under his hands becoming more and more prominent.
“What’s going on?” asked Harry, announcing himself. Ron and Hermione looked up sharply at him in surprise.
“She said that it’s compulsory, Ron,” she pointed out, flipping through the pages of her own copy. “Whether you like it or not doesn’t matter: if you refuse to participate, you’ll fail the class and you won’t get your Muggle Studies qualification.”
Harry made to bypass the Halloween party for the Grand Staircase, but the noise within made both he and Draco pause. The music was no longer playing and there was a lot of shouting and screaming pouring out of the Great Hall. Harry and Draco shared a concerned look before they both hurried over to see what was happening. As they pushed open one of the heavy doors to the Great Hall, the sight that met them was one of absolute chaos: the room was packed with students and teachers, and it seemed like everyone was either shouting or crying. Several people had both hands covering their mouths but seemed unable to stop talking, their eyes wide with alarm.
“You and your bloody principles,” muttered Andromeda in a low, shaky voice. She jumped to her feet and stormed out of the kitchen, tears streaking her pale face. Ted stared after her, looking despondent, but he didn’t go after her. Liv shook her head in disbelief.
“What is the meaning of this?” cried Mrs Weasley, stepping between the trio and the goblins’ spears. “Is this how you treat all of your customers?”
A satisfied smirk teased the corners of Liv’s lips but it fell just as quickly. Sinking back into her seat, she looked around her office, looking contemplative.
“This isn’t really an appropriate place to discuss the matter,” Sir Nicholas replied evasively but not before casting a disparaging glance in Draco’s direction. Draco just rolled his eyes; he knew that he should be used to everyone being openly disdainful of him by now, but it still got on his nerves from time to time.
now, is it? So, it only took my untimely death for you to speak to me in a manner befitting my position.”
“It is a little bit,” Draco argued. “Look, I’m not particularly thrilled about it, either, but let’s be realistic—how many people actually read
“It is?” Ron sighed in relief and tore off his school robes. “Oh, thank Merlin for that. I couldn’t be arsed with classes today anyway.”
“Speak for yourself,” Draco scoffed, giving him what Harry thought was supposed to be a disparaging once-over. But, if he didn’t know any better, he’d say Draco was checking him out. He dismissed that possibility almost as quickly as it had entered his head.
“What about Professor Slughorn?” asked Hermione. “He fought at the final battle, he and Professor McGonagall duelled Voldemort together!”
“Based on the accounts of several patients, it is my belief that a combination of alcohol—Ogden’s Old Firewhisky, if I’m not mistaken—a poorly brewed Babbling Potion and a potent dose of Veritaserum was added to the punch bowl in the Great Hall...”
Draco sauntered across the classroom to sit next to Harry, looking incredibly impressed with himself. Harry scowled at him.
Harry nodded in understanding. He knew that he should just drop it, but he had to ask. “Does it have something to do with what happened in the Room of Requirement?”
The classroom stared blankly back at her and she waved her hand dismissively. “Not to worry, we’ll get round to talking about their contribution to Shakespearean theatre another time. So...who would like to kick things off today? Any volunteers?” She scanned the reluctant faces of her students for a volunteer and, finally, Harry raised his hand. Liv smiled at him, “Excellent! Mr Potter, would you and your group come stand in front of my desk, please?”
“These three,” said the goblin, pointing accusingly at Harry, Ron and Hermione, “are not welcome here!”
“Holy shit,” Harry’s head was swimming now, his breaths becoming increasingly laboured as he edged closer towards the point of no return.
“He was only yawning!” she argued. Shaking her head she turned to Harry and said gently, “And to be fair, Professor Sprout did warn us to be careful with the fire seeds. Oh, Harry, it isn’t like you to get so distracted like that!”
“Alright alright, I’ll lay off,” she said casually, turning back to her own script. “Well, since you’ve made it abundantly clear that you don’t fancy Malfoy, then you won’t be bothered about your upcoming kiss scene with him.”
Of course, Harry’s school experience had been nothing like what he had expected it to be. It had been magical, yes, but it had also been more challenging and dangerous than he could ever have imagined. His years at Hogwarts, as difficult as they had been at times, had helped to shape him into the man he was now. As he was about to embark on this next great adventure of his life, he couldn’t help but wonder what kind of man he would be when he finally returned home.
“We rehearsed while we played cards,” he countered, glad that he had the magazine to cover his atrocious poker face.
The door creaked open and when Harry turned in his seat to see who it was, he was shocked to see Hestia Jones enter with Dennis Creevey by her side. What the hell was going on?
“He's not good enough for you!” he cried, pointing accusingly at Theo. “He’s a no-good Death Eater and I trust him as far as I could throw him.
“I’m not saying he wasn’t,” said Harry mildly. “Still, he did save my life, more than a few times. And he was on our side.”
When the words left Harry’s lips, he felt an invisible tendril shoot from the tip of his wand straight towards Neville’s head, only to be met with some unseen resistance. Neville screwed up his face in concentration as he tried to keep up the magical barrier protecting his mind, but with a slight push from Harry, the barrier crumbled and fell. Suddenly, Harry’s mind was filled with memories that were not his own, flashing across his eyes like a film reel of random scenes haphazardly spliced together: Neville tending to exotic plants in a large greenhouse...Harry and Neville on the train to Hogwarts talking about Asha...Neville beheading Nagini…Luna pushing Neville back onto a bed and straddling his lap—
“Merlin, Potter, are you as blind as you are stupid?” he snapped, slamming the toilet door shut behind him. “Watch where you’re going!”
Draco couldn’t help but feel amused at how furious Ron looked when he said that because they both knew it was true. As much as he enjoyed winding Ron up, he decided it was time to wrap things up. “So, when you’re done moping about feeling sorry for yourself, can you please talk to him? Because he really needs to talk to you.”
Harry took a step back then and turned to Draco. “I don’t feel comfortable listening to this. Let’s get out of here before they find us.”
Draco lunged forward and pushed Harry flat onto his back, knocking his wand out of his hand in the process. The connection between their minds was instantly severed and Harry looked around disoriented, sprawled across the grass as Draco loomed over him on his hands and knees, looking panic-stricken.
“Not before you take me out on a date first,” he joked, laughing at the angry blush that spread across Harry’s face. Harry tossed another ball, this time at Draco’s face. Using wandless magic he managed to stop the missile mid-flight and toss it back at Harry.
“I can manage this just fine on my own,” Harry grumbled. He glared at the feather on his desk with the utmost concentration, but try as he might, he couldn’t make it move. Draco watched Harry with growing amusement.
“And Blaise?” Harry asked, nodding towards the other Slytherin who he just realised had a large bandage across his normally handsome face.
“Alright, I’ll meet you outside the Great Hall after dinner. We should probably do it somewhere private.”
Suddenly, there was a loud rap at the door. Professor McGonagall kept her gaze fixed on Harry as she called, “Enter!”
“Ted and Dirk were on the run at this point,” Liv explained as they watched her memory-version lean close to the radio, chewing her lip worriedly. “Doctoring Dirk’s paperwork bought him time but eventually they found out it was a forgery.”
“Yeah, I’ll count my blessings that I was partnered with Zabini. I’d choose that pompous git over Snape any day,” Ron relented. “Zabini was a tough one to crack but I managed to get past his defences a couple of times. Honestly, he’s just as vain as people think he is—most of his memories consisted of him admiring his reflection in the mirror and fixing his hair.”
“Professor…” Liv said slowly as Harry slammed the oak door shut behind him. “I may have an idea with regards to Mr Creevey’s punishment…”
“Not every night,” she replied evasively. “You look tired, Draco. I’ll let you get some rest. Goodnight.”
Harry moved closer to Draco, pressing their chests together. He could feel Draco’s heart beating as hard and fast as his own. When he spoke again, he spoke slowly and with care, knowing what weight the words carried and what they’d have to do next.
It made her so easily manipulated, just like this. Such a woman, cruel and unforgivable, and yet she was somewhat still a child.
Just like the day before, he started to run through the halls with abandon. He needed to get away, and get away
He remembered the words suddenly, from a particularly stifling Sunday afternoon at Hogwarts when he walked up to their spot by the lake and found Draco already curled up on his side, facing away from him. The sun was blazing mercilessly, and Harry stood there for a moment staring at the other boy before he reluctantly moved so his shadow blocked the rays off of him.
Draco sighed at the address at the front, ripping open the envelope. "Got to hide this from my dad."
Harry's eyes flew open, seeing Ron's ginger head hovering above him, looking concerned. Shit. He'd fallen asleep without changing his clothes. Bloody Malfoy.
"Potter's own words." Snape simply said, then continued. He spoke to Draco about the duel between Harry and Voldemort, how the path of their spells met and Priori Incantatem occurred. Draco had only read about it before, being extremely rare, extremely lucky. Harry had been extremely lucky.
I've been writing ahead lately and wanted to be legit and post chapters once a week, but i'm incredibly impatient!!! Here's another chapter and another may be coming soon because i have no self control.
He pushed in the parlor room with a little more force than necessary, and slumped in the lounge chair across his mother without caring if he'd get reprimanded for it. Luckily she said nothing from where she was sat across him.
"It's like Potions, so you should be fine." Harry said conversationally, glancing at him as he worked. "You should roll up your sleeves, though." He gestured to Draco's long sleeves then back to his own rolled up ones.
"Yes, sir." He answered anyway, because he had to. It still burned in his gut every time he did. He didn't know if it was because it was such an alienating term for his own father, or the forced demand for respect placed on him that just made him feel like he was telling blatant lies the whole day.
. They were immediately bathed in darkness again and silence permeated the air, the lapping of the lake and a distant owl hooting the only sounds between them.
"Dick." Remus muttered to him from the corner of his mouth, then said louder to Harry. "Sirius hasn't been able to get out as I'm sure the general public wouldn't take well to seeing a wanted fugitive walking around."
"I know." Draco said apologetically, "I'm sorry. I don't know what's gotten in to me." He pressed on his temples tiredly, massaging them in slow circles. He probably just needed some sleep. It was probably late. Maybe by morning, the anger might have gone away…
work for the Dark Lord and I will oppose you and your side. If I don't have this role, my place in this war will seat itself next to my father, so
“Hm?” Draco’s eyes snapped to his from deep thought, then looked away quickly with a short shake of his head. “No, nothing. It’s just…” He ran a hand through his hair again, “Lots to think about, that’s all.”
"Who's embracing air now." Harry muttered in to Draco's shoulder, and he felt a slight huff of laughter.
"Hullo George, Fred." Harry said dully. The two snickered about something obviously no one else was privy to. One of them - George, Draco presumed - finally landed their eyes on Draco, and nudged his twin.
"My hand, Potter." He said, gesturing to it with his eyes. Harry quickly complied, grabbing Draco's right arm with his own with a tight grip. Sirius touched the tip of his wand to the point where their hands met, and he felt a thrum of magic he was too distracted to think about because of Draco grimacing in front of him.
“Right.” Ronald thrust his hand in the air, letting his chair rock forward so it was fully on the ground with a loud thump.
"Psst!" A voice hissed. Harry quickly pocketed it his wand, scrambling around to the source of the voice. "You! Potter!"
"You can't have help from non-competitors. Why not ask Cedric or something? He's a Hufflepuff. I'm sure he'll spill it." Draco said simply.
"Francis? Fell in to a furnace and died." Blaise said apathetically. "One of the apprentices took over and half the royalties go to Mum now."
"Er, hi." Was all he could say. He took the time to glare at Sirius behind them, whom was grinning maniacally like a smug bastard.
"Er, right. Sorry. Then I started thinking about Potions for once - rather the class and not the homework - and I realised something felt off but, I couldn't tell what. Then I realised that it was Malfoy's snobby arse not in our faces all the time. I realised I hadn't seen much of him all the way since the Ball, and so I asked Hermione if she'd seen anything-"
"Let's go now. By the Lake. Who knows how much time we have." Harry said, trying to coax a reaction out of the boy by telling him what to do. Malfoy, however, just nodded again. Harry cocked it up to something spiked in the Pumpkin juice, and nudged the boy to start moving. The glassy quality in his grey eyes disappeared, and Harry felt something in him stir. Hoping Malfoy would follow, he moved quietly out the Hall and prayed nobody saw them leave.
He lowered himself in to his chair as gently as he could, his heart feeling entirely out of place in the room as it hammered violently in his chest. The atmosphere was like glass, tense and very carefully controlled between breaking on the crux of a narrow point. The seat was cold under him, and it felt smaller than before. Maybe he really had grown over the year.
"And not only that, but your magic's been entangled not just for life, but until death. I'm sure you can infer the difference?"
, Draco. I told him because he wanted to know about my life, and he looks so lonely, you see, so I ended up telling him about it. And he doesn’t speak to anyone - ever. I promise you can trust him." He slowly took his hand off Draco's mouth as if expecting his head to be bit off. Draco had the right bloody
"I am bloody well not! That's besides the point, though. It was a good joke." Harry said, siphoning his half-ruined potion in to a vial to give to Snape.
"Shit." Harry said under his breath. "Fine. We'll talk after lunch - all of us. Ron and Hermione are in on it, too."
His Godfather's face immediately surfaced in the coals, and Draco had never been so glad to see the man's sour face before. He crouched in front of the fireplace, ignoring the twinge of pain in his bad knee.
"Er.." Harry mumbled, not knowing where to start. He looked back at Ron, whom was still involved in his game.
"Don't bother, Potter." Draco cut him off with a raised hand. "Don't worry about me. I can handle him."
"There will be no need for that." A breezy voice announced. Albus Dumbledore was waltzing in, a definitive look at Draco having him lowering his wand. "Good morning, Professor." The old man twinkled. Snape barely held in a scowl as Dumbledore turned to regard Draco.
Then the apparent resurrection of The Dark Lord from the use of the potion from which Harry's blood was forcibly taken.
He snuck through the house and made it outside without meeting anyone on the way. Luckily, the weather was as warm as he'd hoped it was when he saw from inside, and he was glad he'd forgone an outer jumper or coat. A warm wind sifted past him, and the inside of his white cotton shirt cooled with it. He wasn't quite used to such sunlight, and his mother surely wouldn't have approved, but he couldn't see anything bad about it at the moment as it beat down on his skin and fought away the chill he got from the Manor's dark halls. He made his way across the grounds, closing his eyes and turning his head up to the sky. He felt the tip of his nose warming, and his fingertips buzzed as they thawed. He never realised how cold he got inside the Manor because he'd grown so used to it over the years.
The boy's eyes opened slightly then closed, fluttering through a haze of fuzzy wakefulness. Draco watched his eyebrows furrow and a frown settle on his face. His fringe was curled over his forehead, almost plastered with sweat.
He clamped his mouth shut, forcing himself to write and separate himself from the pain. The room stayed silent as time went by, and he didn’t dare look up to the clock on the wall lest Umbridge saw him do so or the sight of the vile cat on its face set him off into an irreversible rage.
He just wanted to see his Patronus again. That was it. The blazing stag was something he could never forget, but seeing it each time was also as if seeing for the first time.
, then any future of it is out of the question. I need Umbridge off my arse, so…” He looked down, eyes glazing for a moment before they snapped back to Harry with resolution, “So we’re going to focus on Umbridge first. Whatever happens with my father can happen, but we’re going to find a way to have both sides of the coin.”
Potter shifted beside him, reminding him the boy was still there. He seemed to also be lost in thought. He looked so unguarded, as if he forgot Draco was there. Potter still had some height over Draco, and from where Draco was, he looked…relieved. It was a look he never saw on Potter. The boy was always moving, eyes wide, taking in information and acting on it. But now, for a few moments, he was just there. For a few moments, he just existed, like Draco had been too, gazing at the walls. Draco looked back out at the crowd.
"Yes, mother." He said with a curt nod. Her gaze on him didn't falter, and neither did her grip on his arm. He made no move to leave it, and they stood there for a moment in silence, as if waiting for the other to say something.
Blaise suddenly looked very serious, staring off thoughtfully, "And…what did you say?" He asked, his voice quiet, almost cautious.
He didn’t have time to ponder too much about Harry. His first priority was that letter and he had a vague idea how to get it.
." Ron spat. "I was able to tolerate you and Harry being friends because it wasn't my problem, but now you're here, and you want to think you can be good, but you were
"Wh-?" Harry started, but was silenced by Molly placing steaming plates of food in front of the both of them. He turned to glare at Draco, but the effect was dampened by his still crooked glasses and mussed hair that stuck in all directions that shouldn't have been possible.
But his train of thought was cut off when the curtain swished to the side and Draco appeared, clutching his stomach and slightly hunched over.
Once settled at the breakfast table with Sirius, Remus, Tonks and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, barely even minutes later did Harry come barreling in. His clothes were obviously haphazardly thrown on and of course his hair was unbrushed. Draco would've bet Galleons the boy didn't even own a comb.
family. He tried to look for any loopholes that might help Harry, but the hedges were practically impenetrable when fully grown, both physically and magically. The textbook barely even said how they could be grown, so Merlin knows how the school procured some so easily.
Harry smiled weakly at them, wanting to tell them not to worry and that it wasn't difficult. That he really was alright. He wished he had the energy to talk to them normally again or have a game of chess with Ron.
Draco sighed at that, slumping back in his chair, "It's going to be long, I just know it. Any meeting with Snape is bound to be hours long."
Seeing the rest of the Hall, Draco realised they were the only couple still on the floor. Face heating in embarrassment, he quickly made his way off, making sure not to look at Potter. He ignored the many stares from people around the room and made a show of getting a drink from one of the tables and sipping languorously like he did it all the time. More casual music started to the play, and the comfortable hum of chatter regained itself in the Hall. Draco sighed in relief, a tight feeling in his chest but a rush of adrenaline still lingering. His pulse was racing, he felt, as he pressed his fingers to his neck.
"And I get what you said earlier, about the blood purity. It's the most eloquent I've ever heard you speak actually. I always thought you and Weasel communicated in grunts and hand gestures to be quire honest-"
” Harry slammed the table with his fist again, and the room went silent again for the next few seconds, the only sound was the heavy breathing of Harry himself.
Draco obeyed, and barely jumped out of skin as his father grabbed the arm that was suspended in front of him and positioned it forward.
McGonagall looked back at Draco, question in her eyes. He silently flashed her his prefect badge, then she nodded understandingly. Being a member of the Order, McGonagall was aware to some extent of Draco’s allegiances. He’d even seen her flit in and out of Grimmauld Place a few times over the summer and he vaguely remembered being told she’d been one of the few teachers on the scene back when fake-Moody tried to kill him and Harry.
Draco gritted his teeth and ran through basic arithmancy formulas in his head. "You've got your hand on my
"Exactly. You're not him, and not responsible for what he does. You're making your own man. You being here proves that, don't you think?"
"It's basically this map that let's me see everyone at Hogwarts and where they are - I'll show you later when I get it back. But for some reason that night, I saw the name Barty Crouch on the map down in Snape's office. It shouldn't have been possible. Why would he be here?"
"You!" He bellowed, stomping forward and grabbing Harry by the collar of his nightgown. He shook him roughly, continuing to spit on Harry's face as he yelled, "What did you do, you devil? What was that just now?"
The next morning, Ron acted as if nothing had changed and Harry dutifully followed. In fact, it almost felt slightly smoother between them during breakfast, which in turn put Hermione into a brighter mood.
"Felt impressive. I feel way better." Harry stretched his arms up and laid back down. "Wish I could stay here all day."
He stopped by the Great Hall, which was somehow already full of food despite there being only one teacher and Draco. He grabbed a few croissants and an apple and left again, cradling them in a napkin precariously and begging himself not to drop them.
"Enough about Potter for the moment!" She cried. "Everyone was bloody watching you two just now. They were
There was a pause of silence in the room for a moment, punctuated only by the constant, pathetic ticking of a clock on the wall.
"No, you tosser. My scar's been hurting lately. And I get these strange dreams…" Harry explained the dreams he had been having over the summer at the Dursley's, as well as how his scar would flare up whenever Voldemort was near. It felt strange telling Malfoy all at once when he could barely even tell Ron and Hermione a few months ago. He knew Malfoy wouldn't tell him to go see Dumbledore or anything else just as useless like Hermione might have forced him to. He really loved his friends, but sometimes they didn't understand and got riled up over the drop of a pen on Harry's part. It was well-intended sentiment, but Harry didn't need that when he told them, he needed
“I find I quite agree with you.” she said, propping her chin up on a hand and leaning on her desk. Her tone was less sickly and fake now and more serious. Cautious, even. “These ideas...of yours…” she trailed off, waving a hand through the air in circles.
Finally, they reached. Draco noted that, while not outrageously long, it still took a considerably longer time to reach the sixth floor than whenever he’d rode the elevator before in the past. Then again, those were the times when he’d only gone as far as the fourth floor with his father, but it still made him wonder what the Ministry held in its deeper levels.
He heard Draco scoff above him, “And this Blane Witherby bloke?” the sound of crinkling parchment sounded as if Draco had shaken it pointedly. Knowing the dramatic bastard, he definitely had. “Ever thought he could be one of
She was a small, old woman, he first noticed, as he could only really only see her large updo until they both walked a little closer and more of her figure was revealed. Next to her desk on the floor was what looked like a large hatch in the floor, but it was closed, so he couldn’t be sure.
“We, erm, talked about Umbridge.” Harry said, unsure of how else to explain everything else. The memory of the conversation only blurred together even more after a full night’s sleep. “He said he'd write it down for us. It was a lot.”
"I already apologised for it." Draco said through gritted teeth, "We both already sorted out what I did to him in the past."
“Alright. Let’s go.” Draco peered out of the Portkey station, unsurprisingly finding the atrium empty as it was far past the morning work rush hour. Confident they wouldn’t run into anyone unsavoury, he led the both of them towards the elevators hurriedly.
He stood, his hand burning from both the cuts and her repulsive touch. Gathering his bag over his shoulder, he hesitated a moment, clearing his throat to get her attention.
Before she could finish, Sirius and Tonks managed to force the curtains closed, and along with them the old woman's screeches died and an echoing silence fell.
"He's my competitor!" Potter exclaimed,  "I have to keep tabs on him…and stuff." He trailed off, looking at their feet as they danced around Viktor and Granger. He snapped his eyes to Draco, "Why were you looking at me then?" He challenged.
His smile fell, however, when his eyes saw the food in front of him. Draco watched him carefully, about to coax in to eating some of it before voices rang out from behind the curtains.
"Sorry." Malfoy said with a mischievous grin. Harry snorted and couldn't help but start laughing afterwards. After a moment, he heard Malfoy join in. The sound of it put an image in to Harry's mind of light that filtered in through windows during the day. The kind that was golden and clear, illuminating every speck of dust flying through the air. He then recognised it from Potions earlier that day.
As the quill scraped over the paper, the same seemed to happen to his hand as the letters, one by one, were cut into his skin before his eyes. His hand seared with pain but within a moment, the wounds on his hand healed over as if nothing were ever there. He glanced at the words on the parchment, their glossy sheen reflecting off the light coming from the window next to him. It took a moment before he realised that Umbridge really did expect him to supply his own ink, not with saliva but with his own blood.
He quickly looked away, not wanting to see Draco open it, even if he did. It wasn't much, just a short note he probably should have spent more time on, but hadn't known what to say when it came down to it.
The three of them gathered at the front of the Manor, Draco's mother shrinking his trunk until he would be at Platform 9¾. His father held out both arms, and Draco begrudgingly took one while his mother took the other, although he made sure to only touch him sleeve with a few fingers.
“Shit!” Draco jumped, grabbing over his chest where his heart was pounding. “Don’t sneak up on me.” He quickly glanced around, seeing that Chang was gone and they were finally alone.
"You will become my Secret-Keeper," Draco said, "And in turn I will swear an Unbreakable Vow. To you."
“She’s the new Defence teacher.” Draco said casually, careful not to let on that he knew more than he should.
Malfoy snapped the book shut and held it to his chest, "I thought about it the whole day, Harry. The more I looked at these notes…maybe it's not such a good idea. What I said was completely theoretical.
“Hypothetically, I’m going to do it anyway.” Draco bit out sharper than he intended. He sighed, massaging over his eyes with one hand. “Sorry. That was rude of me.” he said more quietly.
In short, the Organisation department was the only other access point into the lower levels of the archives apart from being an Unspeakable or the bloody Head of the DMLE or something. It explained why old Lancaster got compensated so handsomely and probably why Blaise’s mum married him, the poor soul.
