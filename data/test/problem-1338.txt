and Harry tries it. It opens to a room cluttered with a hotchpotch of different things, ranging from cabinets and armchairs to clocks, books, quills, and teapots. Several things move around or float through the labyrinth of less agile objects on display, and Harry senses at least a few
.” Harry slipped the gold band onto his finger, and a few couples even stopped eating to clap in celebration. It slid easily past Draco’s knuckle and fit like it was a part of his finger. “It feels warm against my skin,” Draco marvelled, holding his hand up to admire his engagement ring.
the month it was legalised in Muggle Britain. Ambroos, Draco’s ex-husband, was one of their guests, and he made a cheeky comment about history repeating itself, but without any sarcasm in his tone. When Harry’s whole body was sore after partying all day and pleasuring each other all night, Harry told Draco he understood why he fell in love with Ambroos, how freeing someone that easy-going must’ve been right after the sombre times of the war. Draco replied that he didn’t know what love was, not really, before Harry.
He felt like a spectre, roaming the treeless grounds, the deserted streets of Hogsmeade. It was only the train station—
That night was as much of an emotional rollercoaster as the night of the battle. He’d come to leave and leave he did, only that he became

Dear journal and future self.
" asked Harry, the two of them sprawled across the bed. Harry's fingertips travel Draco's bare chest, over the juts of his ribs, and down his lithe body where he can't resist the temptation of stroking over his flaccid penis and idly holding onto it. “
“Yes, yes,” Draco interrupted impatiently, leaning over Harry’s desk. “I know all about your cases, Harry! I’m the one who has to argue them in the Wizengamot.” He frowned at the piles of parchment that littered the surface. “And I happen to know when you, my dear, are trying to change the subject. So, as I was saying, The Chimaera’s Den. It’s newly opened on Artemisia Avenue, the chef is a wizard from Paris and, most importantly, Pansy has heard that the food is to die for.”
Draco’s grimace deepened. Of course, if he wanted to say it like that…
“I reckon you haven’t got the opportunity to talk to him yet,” Draco said.
Draco smirked as he grabbed Harry’s face. “If you think this will be enough for me to forgive you, you’re fooling yourself, Potter…” he whispered before kissing him back properly.
In the end, Draco came up with a new version of the scar removing salve by the beginning of February. Snape let him test his invention on him and Draco hadn’t expected his Head of House to have so many scars. The result exceeded expectations and Snape offered him to put him in contact with the patenting committee of St Mungo’s. This would surely help his internship application next summer! But Draco had other plans for now.
Draco rewarded Harry with a deep kiss which has every other people in the room beam over them.
A strange laugh strangled him, and he turned around to flee as quickly as possible.
“How would I know?!! He didn’t tell me either, okay??!!!!” Potter yelled back.
to know… They’re your friends.”
“I should go see a psychiatrist, shouldn’t I?” he mumbled in a whisper.
“Does that mean you give up on talking to Teddy?”
“As a reserve player,” Granger commented. “And he has yet to play any match. And he had been captain of the Gryffindor team for 4 years! In comparison, Harry could be Captain for a maximum of 2 years and that only if the team accept him next year! Additionally, I heard that seekers are changed far less frequently than keepers so, except if one of the team loses its seeker in exactly two years, I doubt Harry would have any chance to get picked!”
“Anyway. In the end, he said he should try to seduce Creevey, because I quote ‘
During the first breakfast of the term, Granger and Weasley came to see him which drew a bit too much unwanted attention since, for once, Teddy wasn’t with him – he learnt later that it was very much intentional on the Hufflepuff’s part. After their uninspired menaces which included lines such as ‘
And Harry, who was just that away to go back to Potter in Draco’s mind, didn’t only leave him there! He started avoiding him in the next few days. What was he supposed to think about that?!!! Harry had been the one to take that step by kissing him! He couldn’t just ditch him like that, could he???? And what with the avoidance?! Wasn’t he supposed to be a Gryffindor?! How could that be qualified as bravery????
“You’re not old…” Draco smiled at her. “Here the book list of the year… and of course the reminder about the rules, and oh! My Hogsmeade visits permission form if you’re kind enough to sign it…”
“So?”
Teddy groaned, rolling his eyes. “Please don’t!”
“I don’t think you’re pathetic!” he sprouted. “They are the ones who are pathetic!”
“I missed you too,” Draco answered back. He tried to deepen the kiss, but Harry stepped back.
“Don’t ask me, she told me they had broken up,” he said. “And, it’s not as if I had to force her to do anything too…”
“Draco…” Harry warned.
“I saw how you two act during Potions… I mean, if you’re not going out yet it will probably happen soon…” the dark-skinned boy said.
“That you’re sharing a dorm room with your ex, but you failed to mention it during our 10-month relationship?” Harry asked. “Why would I be?”
“No… It’s just that I happen to know what you look like when you feel aroused…” the boy smirked.
By Draco’s 4th year at Hogwarts, the boy couldn’t see his life without Teddy by his side anymore. Sure, most of his fellow Slytherins had accepted him back in since his 1st year. But knowing what real friendship looked like through his relationship with Teddy put every other one in perspective.
“But he was left alone at 11! He’s supposed to have an extensive loving family. They were all his godfather’s best friends and none of them has even looked for him in 5 years!”
“You mad?” Draco grimaced.
“Bye~” Draco beamed, and Teddy waved him goodbye as he was leaving the room.
“So… what’s my punishment?” Draco asked, pretending that this was a casual question.
“No… you’re Teddy’s brother. I would never do something like that to you if you don’t want me to!”
“It’s been so long, I don’t remember right, maybe…”
“Why? We would just play some Quidditch! What are you afraid of? It’s not as if I’m going to jump on you…”
When he went back to the pitch, Harry sent him a disbelieving look.
“A decent person!” Draco answered the rhetoric question angrily.
seems like a pretty good goal – except the wrongly imprisoned part for 10 years, of course… And it’s true. I don’t say that I would never work… just… well, I don’t
“Don’t be like that Harry. You know you aren’t even remotely as obsessed by Quidditch as Wood was…” she said. “I mean, we all know you’re a wonderful player Harry… it’s just… not serious. So, you should think about a back-up plan, I think…”
,’ the two Gryffindors went back to their table and Draco was left alone to answer the solicitations of his dorm mates.
about sex not being only about who put what in who?” Harry teased.
“The son of a Death Eater,” Draco spat bitterly.
“Tell me, Potter…” he asked while approaching him slowly. “Do you wish you could touch it… my perfect skin, I mean…”
Draco eyed Teddy, to see how his friend was reacting. It was the first time the three of them had really spend time together since Teddy learnt about Harry’s and Draco’s building relationship.
“Harry…” Draco tried to talk but Harry refused to meet his eyes.
“I… I don’t know! Why would you ask me out?!!”
Draco ignored her. “He’s my best friend, it’s my business. And don’t pretend, you did it on purpose, you knew he was patrolling tonight, you wanted him to find out! Otherwise, you could just have found a hidden room here, in the dungeons!”
But Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to force that type of encounter on himself. If Teddy wanted to see him, he knew where to find him…
Draco smirked. He would take that as a ‘no’.
“Because I fucking fancy you!!”
They both just watched the sky for a moment until Malfoy cast a wordless
With a grin on his face, Malfoy takes a moment to carefully select one of the fancy pralines he laid out for them. Some of them are covered in a metallic shimmer, others are topped with nuts or dried fruit. He takes a very dark, square chocolate with coarse-grained salt on top, biting off half of the tiny treat. He frowns at the cross-section of the chocolate pinched between his thumb and index. “I
“I’m not sure a man as short-sighted as you is allowed to comment on what can and can’t be seen,” Draco answered, though there was no heat to his words. “And I’m barely gorgeous,” Draco groused. “
“You needn’t be,” Draco answered snippily, wrapping his arms around himself. He’d left his coat inside, and it was cold, but he wouldn’t go back inside, not for a vault full of gold. “Needed some air and now I’m fine. If you’d kindly let me be?”
, by a floor-to-ceiling window that looks out into the garden. Another wall full of built-in cabinets. A door to what Draco calls an
“You look just like your father, dear boy,” a voice says, undeniably that of an anciently old lady. Harry leans against the wall, listening closely. “But the honest work you do! None of that wheeling and dealing young Lucius was entertaining. May Salazar bless him.”
Or that, perhaps, it’s an absence of feeling that has carved this chasm inside of him, rendering his body an instrument of his physique, fuelled with the half-remembered remnants of a long-lost spark. That, perhaps, he’s just like a star.
Anyway, Harry went on about how rare wizard pregnancies are and inquired after St Mungo’s appointments which I don’t have. He looked a bit panicky when I said that I wasn’t sure whether St Mungo’s could even help me. “We ought to try,” he insisted. He generally slipped into saying “we” which gave me more than a little hope. And a ludicrous amount of Wrackspurts fluttering about in my belly.
It’d been a Crup theft, rather a violent one, and the arguments as to whether the criminal deserved a month in Azkaban had continued for over an hour. Sat frustrated at the back of the courtroom, Draco had watched the minutes tick away. The likelihood of getting his article in the evening edition had grown increasingly slim.
“But Snape is still patrolling, he’s just outside your common room right now…” Harry sighed while looking at something on his lap.
“Well, at least, he gave you a full sentence! It’s better than what we get nowadays…” Harry argued.
They kept on flying around for almost an entire hour until they finally retreated to Gryffindor changing room. They were both panting but couldn’t get rid of the smile on their face. Harry’s hair was even worse than usual and Draco grimaced when he noticed how pink his own cheeks were. They looked ridiculous…
See you~
“We won’t do anything naughty! I just want to talk!”
“We have.”
“You talked to Black, then?” Draco inquired.
It was nothing compared to what Harry gave him though.
“What?” Draco asked dangerously.
“Draco didn’t say that to blame you, Ted’,” Harry said softly. “And for the record, I don’t know what you planned to do with Tracey but the two of us haven’t had penetrative sex before very recently, actually…”
“Fine, we’ll move to my room then…” Draco sighed.
And he had to share him with Potter… which sucked. But unlike what Draco had expected, Potter didn’t try to drive Teddy away. By the end of that year, Draco and Potter had made a deal. Never would they ever do something that would force Teddy to choose between the two of them. Teddy didn’t deserve something like that. And if one of them was worried about Teddy, he would tell the other.
Narcissa talks me through everything we need to get ready by tomorrow night, and by the time Jamie cries from their cot, I feel like I have some idea of what I’m getting myself into.
“Don’t come.”
stings more than Draco thought it would. Draco wishes he didn’t remember those details. Picking the coffin, the tombstone.
Draco is now what he had always wanted to be at Hogwarts. The most desirable, best looking thing. A prize to claim, a trophy to have; and every night men are drawn to him like Icarus to the sun.
.  Most importantly, Potter and his tiny
Draco tries to move towards the voice.
The look in Draco’s face makes Harry’s cock twitch happily.
And Draco’s
Bright and crimson as hell itself, Harry’s blood. It’s only a little line, blood bubbling to the surface like lava in a volcano, but Harry moans when he looks down.
“Just this?” Harry asks.
Harry lies on his back and Draco straddles his waist.
He’s alive, and that in itself is a miracle. He’s allowed to live. And live he does, even if Pansy doesn’t agree with his concept of living. For all her qualities she can be quite blind when she wants to be. She coddles him, asks him casually why he doesn’t charge if fucking is all he does, why he doesn’t take a full time sugar daddy. He doesn’t want to have to explain that it’s not money he needs. It’s the attention he wants. The eyes that fall on him with love and lust and need. The eyes that don’t see how ugly he is inside. Under the rose-tinted sunnies of a drunk stranger, Draco is a dream. And only Draco gets to go home and laugh himself sick about how Wilde had it right. In The Attic, Draco is Dorian Grey come to life; he is the shiniest, plumpest piece of fruit on the tree that no one knows is rotten and full of maggots under its unbroken skin.
“You’re drunk,” Draco says as Potter stumbles into his house, knocking into Draco’s arm with his shoulder as he does.
“Yeah?”
Draco must be reading my mind when I approach him by the fire, because the back of his hand brushes mine reassuringly. “I feel a bit odd that Pansy isn’t here,” he says. I smile.
Harry Potter loves like he once knew Draco. In the past. Not
Ron is red in the face, eyes crinkled with worry, lips already ragged and bitten through as always happens by the end of a tough case. Mavis looks like she is genuinely about to cry, and that is a terrifying thought for everyone watching the scene. Harry has an expression like thunder, all despair and fury, like a swooping storm about to take everything down with him, and everyone knows that he can.
, the hopeless silence of grief like a stain no one can wash off.
Harry is thirty-seven minutes late when the owl comes. Draco’s heart beats in his throat, threatening and quick with worry until Luna unfolds the note and Draco recognises the messy handwriting. He leans over and reads over his friend’s shoulder:
“Anything, Potter? Then make me come. Make me come, and maybe I’ll let you.”

They’re not in the kitchen, but it’s still Harry, it’s still his Harry against him and it feels good to finally do this, to not have to hide behind friendly smiles and leave separately even though they’ve been sleeping in the same bed for almost two years.
Harry approaches, but not close enough, not even close enough for Draco to grab at him.
“Not really. I imagine it went exactly how you wanted it to.”
“Don’t come,” Draco says again, with a mean little twist of his wrist that Potter repays him with a whine.
I call for help, voice straining with the weight of the heaviest net I’ve ever pulled.
In an unusual move, he splits his next Apparition into two jumps with a quick stop in Germany to preserve energy before he lands on the steps of the familiar villa. The late-Spring heat of Crete is too much and he starts on his waistcoat buttons as he lets himself into the house, checking the pool and the balcony first and finding them deserted.
Harry’s eyes never leave Draco’s hand as he cuts the cake. One slice, and then the other. Draco watches him back: eyes wide, surveying every movement of Draco’s hand.
He won’t. They both know he won’t.
Harry’s warm hand wraps around Draco’s and squeezes.
“I think I was. I didn’t realise it then, not when I started dating you. I didn’t mean to hurt you,” he confesses, quietly, because they’re standing at Harry’s grave discussing a relationship that was dead long before Harry.
, but we are going to take the weekend as we’re a bit shaken from the whole ordeal. We’ll fill the paperwork in on Monday, we love Ronald very much, and he’ll be just grand holding the fort down for us,” Draco explains, in between kisses on his way back up Harry’s torso.
In the end, it was laughter that brought him back.
Point being, here I am, a half-eaten bit of peach between my thumb and forefinger halfway to my mouth, looking at my own husband with an expression I reckon is as dumbfounded as the expression I had at eleven when I asked Hagrid, “I’m a
When both juniper and seawater blessings have happened, they’re held by both godparents, who whisper their names almost as if it’s a spell. I’m hit again by a barrage of emotions, anchored by Draco’s hand in mine — hit by the idea that Sirius once held me like that, that Sirius once whispered
“But—“
Potter is, as promised, good. He’s so fucking good Draco is a little worried he may get used to this. Accidentally. If it keeps happening.
she says, voice far away.
When it finally clicks, it’s like a torrent, like a dam breaking. Ron is standing against the small patch of peeling paint on the wall between the Head and Deputy Head Auror’s offices. Harry spots him first, and sips his tea, smiles over the rim of his mug. Mavis isn’t sure if it’s Ron’s concerned expression or the distinctive blue-ish light of a sealed crime-scene around the office door that makes him implode, but, by Merlin, he does implode.
Fleur comes in next, holding a beautiful teal-tinted bottle full of seawater. She hugs me tightly and suddenly I miss Bill. I miss Ron, I miss Hermione, I miss Ginny. Every Weasley has been there for every big moment of my life until now. But this time it’s just Fleur.
“Hello, Draco.” Cool as always, almost as if she expects him to be there. Not likely, since Draco hasn’t been in the country for over a decade.
cw: dubious consent due to identity issues
She coos at Jamie, half asleep in my arms, and I trade her the baby for the bottle.
“Yes.”
Draco raises an eyebrow at him, but doesn’t ask for any clarification.
“See ya, Malfoy.”
He’s way too familiar with the way his Auror partner works not to know it’s him when the strong arms wrap around him and pull him up. “Oh, Merlin,” he hears. His eyes flutter back open for a couple of seconds and he can tell he was right, even if it’s all blurry: red robes, orange hair, worried blue eyes.
All while he rubs himself against Potter, shamelessly. All while he lets Potter ravage him, touch him all over, kiss his mouth, his ears, his neck.
Harry rolls over and mumbles something that sounds like “morning.”
Draco feels his pants getting stickier with precome at Potter’s words. Potter
“You don’t want to anyway, do you?” Draco continues.
“How do you mean?”
“Christ, you’re burning, Draco,” Potter says, a gentle hand pushing his damp hair off his face before relief comes in the form of a wet flannel and Draco laughs and laughs and laughs until he’s sick. Luna Lovegood is a Healer these days. She comes by and looks at Draco with a sad but kind smile. He hears her telling Potter he’s doing “really well,” and isn’t sure if she means Potter or himself, but he doesn’t think he’s doing well at all because he keeps repeating the Apparition coordinates to Daryl’s place because Daryl is the one who would always give Draco the good stuff at the club, and would never ask for anything in return.
But he hadn’t. Against all odds, Draco is happy. Twenty-seven. He’s got friends, a flat, a job he loves and he’s good at. He’s no longer spat at on the streets. He survived, he made amends, he managed it all. Most of all, he had managed not to die.
Draco had his suspicious Potter would be a size queen, at this point. Or hopes, maybe. Who knows, really, at this point? Who would have a spare thought in their brain when
I don’t even get time to dwell on it, my mouth opens and the words finally tumble out, ending the nervous tense silence.
the one time we want them up in the middle of the night would be the one night they’re sound asleep.
The forward net on the starboard side of the Nimbus starts weighing us down shortly after sunrise. It’s not early for the nets to start to feel full, but it’s certainly not an usual thing. It is not unheard of either though. Wouldn’t be the first time a rock or something equally heavy has gotten stuck amongst the fish.
Harry pulls a joint out of the depths of his coat and lights it up on the second of May 2003, as they sit by a cliff, coats billowing in the wind, after dinner at The Burrow.
,” Draco repeats, as if repeating a word that is completely unfamiliar to me will make me understand it.
Harry doesn’t remember laughing before Hogwarts. He doesn’t remember laughing
he thinks.
By Draco’s box, Harry means the trunk upstairs with all the sex toys and other paraphernalia. There isn’t a lot that Draco doesn’t have in that trunk and that piques his curiosity.
“Fuck Potter, wait, I’m— shit, I’m gonna come,” he says, and Potter pulls back, sits prettily on his haunches and
in between them, every moment where Draco considered blurting it out, saying what was on his mind. The Christmas Gala as he towered over Harry and fixed the little chain on his robes for him, and that night at that dingy club for Hermione’s birthday where they’d stared at each other for forty minutes and when Draco had decided he couldn’t take it anymore, he found out that Harry had left. Or just last month when they’d gone out to buy a housewarming present for Luna and ended up eating leftovers on Harry’s sofa, exhausted from people and walking. There are too many. Too many instances of hesitation, too many “
They stay like that for a while. Half sprawled, half spent. And Draco feels a little sorry at the sight of Potter’s red weeping cock, but Potter seems happy. Satisfied, even.
He says “guilty,” clear as a bell.
“The sun will be up soon,” he tells me. A whisper. A gentle caress of his lips against my skin. I lean into it. He looks at me, then at the basket, then at the people we have chosen to take care of our children should anything happen to us.
It’s not hard, really, for my mind to wander as Father praises Astoria’s many wifely attributes. A lovely girl, really, Astoria. Problem is I’ve always wanted what I’m not supposed to have. A crup over a kneazle. Treacle tart over expensive chocolate. Quidditch over Potions.
“What is your name?” he asks.
And I say nothing because my stomach flips at the way he says my name. I say nothing, even though I mean to say
, she’s a stubborn fuck no one can get rid of. The day she was told point-blank she was no longer fit to serve as an Auror she’d announced immediately she would be staying on as someone’s secretary, she didn’t care whose. But she would only leave the Auror Department in a coffin, and that was final.
takes his shirt off.
Seeing the shake of Mavis’ hand makes Ron move quicker and as soon as he reads the note, he’s barking orders to anyone in the close vicinity of his office. “Stevens, get me the head of DMLE, ASAP. Tell them I said it’s urgent.” “Richardson, I need you and a whole squad from the Investigation Department.” “Mavis, before you say anything to anyone, for Merlin’s sake, find me Harry.”
But the siren before me is the realest thing I’ve ever seen. Realer than that first cup of tea in the morning, realer than the first ray of sun poking from behind the horizon, realer than my mother’s rough but kind hands brushing my sweaty blond curls from my forehead, realer than the first spoonful of fish soup on a cold day.
Harry —
It’s Lucius’ jawline, but Narcissa’s persistent curls. Eyes like Sirius’ — stormy and bright, and a smile like Andromeda’s — warm and inviting. The boots he’s certain are borrowed from Blaise, and the blouse is definitely Pansy’s.
The first time Draco steps into Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley’s home and is treated as a worthy guest, he ends the day with a breakdown that cracks the enormous wooden table in Harry’s kitchen almost in half. Harry mends it, but leaves the crack visible. Draco thinks of it as torture, but as time passes he realises it’s a reminder that things can get better.
I spelled the door open, looked right into his surprised face.
, and there’s not one single ghost to be found there. But it’s . . . Have you been there?”
He sighed. “I haven’t even managed to tell my mum,” Draco sniffed, incredulous that he was having this conversation. “I can’t think about things like that. Not yet.”
hasn’t done anything wrong. But he can’t lose the feeling that Tarquin and John didn’t only fight about Tarquin dropping out of his master’s programme, but that it might also had to do something with Harry himself.
” Ron was really pensive for a moment, creating a pregnant pause in between them, before he answered, his voice slurred with a few Firewhiskies too many, that he feels the same way about his kids.
Written there, I don’t think that looks too ghastly. We’ve all got the right to a private life, haven’t we? I mean, the idea of it feels a bit jarring. Before today, Harry J Potter wasn’t the type of man to buy sex. That was the preserve of old, ugly wizards who creep out to the rough alleyways behind Knockturn Alley to cheat on their wives. Young, vaguely good-looking blokes shouldn’t have to buy sex. For wizards like myself, sex shouldn’t be a transaction.
Harry wakes with a headache, unsure of where he is or how the night went. But then he sees a bloke that he thinks he remembers, only that, in his memory, he wore a shaggy beanie and an expensive woollen coat rather than sleeping in the nudes right next to Harry.
conduct for the Muggles of London. I can’t believe that wizards partake of such behaviour.” He shook his head, likely realising that he had gone too far. “I have to ask - and I assure you, Mr Malfoy, this isn’t because of some prurient interest of my own – but do you prostitute yourself because you are addicted to Muggle drugs? You must realise that they are incredibly dangerous to your unborn child, and I do have to warn you: I wouldn’t have the slightest hesitation in telling the Wizengamot if you were addicted to such substances. Wizarding children can’t be allowed to remain in substandard care–“
Demonstratively, Harry draws his cocaine-filled vial from his breast pocket, wiggling it in front of her eyes. “Enjoying life to the fullest.”
Fear, real and visceral, coiled in Draco’s belly. He still didn’t have his wand – a quick
“It’s a
I gulp in a breath, emerging from the magic-induced revery, and Harry’s hand is on my wrist, trying to be supportive, but I shake his confining touch off, gasping for air.
Draco doesn’t speak. He catches up and walks next to him, close but not touching. The anticipation of the touch sends a weird jolt up Harry’s spine.
a bottle of Pansy’s favourite Pinot Grigio Rose and his favourite Dragonhide boots. If he were forced to suffer the most excruciating meal of his existence, then at least he’d be jolly comfortable whilst his life galloped to hell in a handcart. Gathering together all the loose ends of his courage, Draco dragged in a deep breath. He swished his wand in a wide arc, and Disapparated.
It’s Harry who Apparates them, who takes Draco by the arm and Side-Alongs him.
Draco walked out then, and the silence that he left in his wake was more deafening than his shouting or the sound of the plate breaking. The pain of knowing that Draco would leave, if he only could, is exquisitely sharp.
Draco felt off-kilter. He hadn’t touched a drop of alcohol since the party, but the room was spinning. The world that he’d known had shifted, and he was running,
The Healers took one look at Draco, and they began frantically casting spells and enchantments. They hadn’t time for onlookers, and one of them shoved me into a side waiting room.
A dry sob escapes Harry’s mouth. With a start, he presses his lips shut, and straightens slightly, concentrating on drawing in even, calming breaths.

Harry wonders, “Why don’t you hate me?”
fingers of whisky which he downs like a shot.
The highlight was the Christmas pudding. With a twist of Andi’s wand, the dessert burst into bright blue flames. All four of us cheered at the sight.
“. . . no less than twenty-seven confiscations. And it was only speed-restricting charms we were controlling. Not the steering, not the acceleration or the stopping distance and time
With a groan, Harry sinks deeper into the settee and concentrates on the sounds against the windows, watching the clouds rush past.
“I think she hates me.”
Harry didn’t need to finish his question in order for Draco to understand. He propped himself up above Harry, kissing him and spreading Harry’s thighs with his own. Their eyes found each other’s again, and without Draco verbalising a question, Harry nodded, his hands on the small of Draco’s back.
Harry puts purpose into the kiss that seals their promise, Draco can feel that. Like most things about Harry, it tastes like a strange mixture of dread and dedication.
his pyjama top and pulled it over his head. He slid under his sheets and
Malfoy gives a dismissive sound. “Been married.” Malfoy looks thoughtful for a moment, but then an odd smile dawns in his face. “What an awful,
Even so, Draco still wasn’t sure. The idea of handing the bump over, of leaving St Mungo’s without them, made his heart pound and his skin clammy. The idea of the bump not being
When I noticed that, I was determined to see him completely undone that night. It would both serve my quest to make him a regular, but it would also satisfy my curiosity. Truth was, I wanted him to fuck me with complete abandon. I wanted him to be so much into it that he would lose his notion of careful consideration.
The two of them accidentally trapped a breeze inside the charms and it’s gently wafting about, occasionally catching in Harry’s hair. Sitting outside with the rather large family feels less crowded, the conversations freer. Teddy, Draco and Harry are sitting together at a round table with a multi-coloured tablecloth. Harry know he will never tire of the way Teddy seems to love Draco. He always seeks him out, engaging him into conversation instead of hanging around with the Weasley kids.
do on his own. “You know what you’ll get when I’m back,” Harry quips weakly, shoving his hips against Draco’s. But Draco doesn’t let him get away with a half-hearted innuendo. Instead, Draco kisses Harry, very thoroughly, and just when Harry parts his lips with a moan, melting into Draco’s touch, Draco wrenches himself away from him, breathless and with a smirk on his beautiful face. “You’ll have to come back for more,” he says, an odd plea in his eyes which linger on Harry’s own just for a fraction of a second too long, as though he
Harry would have shown Pansy the door and never forgiven her, had that have been Draco’s wish. That wasn’t what Draco wanted, though. Pansy had been Draco’s best friend since they were tiny and in spite of everything, Draco missed her. “It won’t,” Draco answered. “Nothing could. I can’t hide behind the walls of Grimmauld Place forever, Harry.” He looked down at Daisy, sleeping blissfully, innocent as her name. “I’d like to talk to her.”
We sat sideways after that, exchanging deep kisses and had our eyes only on each other. Not even the beautiful view we had up there on that cliff was more worth seeing. Harry said that he loves me too. That he enjoyed yesterday, and he asked, "Does it mean that you can forgive me? That I'll get a second chance?"
. Harry hadn’t thought about him in a long, long time. “Er- When was that?” Harry asks, the unpleasant feeling of memories that don’t feel like they can come back molesting his temples.
“You kept saying ex! It’s not my fault that you didn’t explain this little detail about your ex’s prick.”
Harry’s jaw hurts. His chest is tight. Harry is lightheaded and his legs are trembling. Panic starts to crowd his thoughts. The muscles in his throat, in his stomach contract at the repulsive process.
It’s quiet for a moment with nothing but the sounds of porcelain on porcelain in the air between them. When Harry finally looks up from the depth of his Earl Grey, Malfoy looks much more relaxed than he would’ve thought. He’s leant back in his chair, legs stretched out before him, and looking very much like he’s enjoying his cup of tea in silence rather than being chastised about Harry.
“Your story. You frequent this bar quite regularly if I may say so. Trotting along with the aspiring youngsters of our branch. Yet still, there’s something rather different about you. That certain
“Perhaps we should go out,” Harry suggests because he misses Draco’s smile. “The night is clear—cold though it is. But I happen to know a certain someone who’s very adept with Warming Charms.”
Draco looks quizzically before realisation dawns on his pointy features. It takes a whole minute of precisely loading his fork with grilled vegetables and chicken until he replies, apparently only to buy more time. “You mean to the bonfire?”
“That’s been playing heavily on your mind,” Draco observed. “The unicorn horns.”
Freezing, but too faint to stand, Harry sinks to the ground, eyes to the starlit sky. Where the luminaries are ever-moving, inexorable and unbothered. Where gas, a million miles away, might have exploded and dissolved into nothingness decades ago while its shine still travels and travels until Harry’s lens refracts it against his retina, disregardent of its source’s demise.
Draco jostles him, his arms looped around Harry’s middle, holding him when he leans in and Harry arches towards Draco’s knees behind him. He feels weightless and light-headed with an idle euphoria.
The conversation ebbed and flowed as we ate. Teddy asked us questions about Hogwarts – I think he’s beginning to get excited about the prospect – and told us stories about some of his school chums. Andi talked about her village friends, and the New Year cake sale that the local Witch’s Institute were planning. Draco said very little. He picked at his dinner and looked to be in a world of his own.
The ceremony and the party were intimate and simple. Harry felt bad for not inviting Nick who talked to Harry on the phone occasionally, only once or twice a year, but whenever they did, they did for hours on end. But Harry had no wish to introduce him to magic. Despite that, Harry would’ve liked to keep the ceremony even smaller, but he couldn’t cut off half the Weasley’s because they were his family and Molly still had a hard time forgiving him for spending years and years away. For the sake of harmony, he invited them all. For the same sake, he reminds himself to visit them at least once a month even though their company often feels oppressive. “
The wait feels impossibly long as he watches Malfoy’s jaw work and his cheek slightly bulge where he possibly licks his teeth. “Okay,” he says as though he’s just won an argument with himself. “Okay, sure, why not.” Malfoy casts a
“That’s good. I’m happy that you somehow found your way to him.”
Draco pushes himself up a little, lips ghosting over Harry’s neck, his jawline, his lips. “Then eat.
“You kissed my arm,” Draco points out.
, then all I’d be doing is proving Draco right. I’d be proving that I believed I knew better than him, which I blatantly do not. I’d be the thoughtless oaf that he already believes me to be and I’d likely scare him into the bargain.
There’s been nights where I’ve dreamt of Draco too. Dreamt of the way his brow furrowed when he looked at the wine list, unsure of which would go best with the pasta. I’ve dreamt of the flush of his cheeks when Draco laughed and how youthful he looked. How he looked like the teenager he was never allowed to be. I’ve dreamt of the confidence movement of his body, leading me, as we danced under the glowing lights. Those nights are the ones where I wake to cum-wet sheets and tears stinging my eyes. I’ve never once Scourgified myself. Those nights I lay there, my nighttime emission sticky on my skin, because I don’t deserve any better. I’m a mess of jealousy, lust and want, and
But anyway.
Draco chortled at the cheesy chat up line, but he felt complimented nevertheless. He could smell the posh scent of Fitzgerald’s aftershave, and his muscles beneath his palms were as hard as iron. Bloody hell, but Draco was half-erect already. He hadn’t wanted a man as much as this in quite a while.
Harry agrees, but points out how Tarquin used to make fun of him for that, for picking the safe e road, and not having the balls to find a work that truly fulfils him; something that isn’t just elusive numbers and presentations about profit, but something with an actual effect on himself or other human beings.
I told him that whenever I need his magic, I expect him to come into my room. That I’ll undress my shirt, taking my sweet time. That he will lay his hands on my skin and we will both feel this intimate, sensual, arousing prickle of our combining magic, and that he can pine after my prick and my arse all he wants.
“Now that’s someone speaking from experience.” Harry grins. “How did you get into drugs anyway?” It’s one of the things Harry kept wondering about. He half curses himself for asking now instead of later when they’d both be excited and talkative.
“Draco,” she said, “whatever is it? You’ve gone as white as parchment, and you arrived looking like a ghoul. Talk to me. You know I’ll wheedle it out of you anyway. Spit it out.”
“Draco, stop,” came a voice, and it wasn’t Fitzgerald. Thank fuck, it wasn’t Fitzgerald. Standing beside him on the dewy grass of the Malfoy Manor lawn was Harry Potter, wearing ill-fitting formal robes and an expression of worry. “I’m sorry I surprised you like that. I thought for sure you must have seen me. I saw you make for the door and I was worried.”
? But- What?! You’re a bloke, how can you . . . ?”
evening is about to get better!”
, but we can’t go on like that. You
And right now Draco wanted Stuart Fitzgerald.
He didn’t even have the decency to keep this verdant thing we had, whatever it precisely was, a secret from outsiders because, obnoxiously enough, he had to share every last one of his thoughts with his friends! We saw Ron and Hermione and the git sat close to me, kissed my shoulder, my cheek, and that was that. And I didn’t even dare to tell him that I didn’t want everyone else involved while we hadn’t talked about anything. As long as our arrangements weren’t completely clear.
I haven’t told him that I’m the plum’s father yet. I know I have to – and I want to, I do, more than anything! – but what we’ve got here, what we’ve found together within the walls of Grimmauld Place – well, it’s magical. Days that just seemed grey and dull before? They’ve brightened and seemed to be lit up with sparkling colour.
“Saved me again,” Draco murmured, sounding wistful, looking over towards where Ron was still standing. He’d been joined by Hermione, and Ron had wrapped his arms around his wife's waist. “Look at those two. Love’s young dream. Romance doesn’t come quite as easily for the rest of us, does it?”
,” Harry confessed to Ron once, his lips feeling sensitive where he tasted hops on the soft skin. They were talking about love and marriage because Ron felt a bit neglected ever since Hermione became Minister. “
One night, Draco was adamant while he was talking to Ron and Hermione who had come over to have dinner with them; adamant that Rosy and Daisy would be great friends and that there wasn’t a too soon for a sleep-over between besties, and while Draco told Hermione all about Daisy’s habits and her predilection for morning cuddles, Ron wiggled his eyebrows at Harry, and Harry felt his cheeks heating in response.
If the Mediwizard was shocked at Draco’s lack of treatment during the first months of his pregnancy, he didn’t voice it. Instead, he told Draco that he’d done exactly the right thing in coming to the hospital when he had and being brave enough to seek help. Draco was grateful to Harry too. The Auror was a fantastic advocate during their time in the examination room, and he explained to the St Mungo’s staff that Draco had endured trauma. “Please communicate about everything you’re doing, and explain the reasons why,” Harry asked them, using a forthright, authoritative voice that Draco didn't think he had heard before.
“And I you,” Harry replies, locking eyes with Draco. With moments like these, Harry thinks, watching Draco in the blushing light, the dark moments don’t seem brighter. But dragging himself out of the chasm seems so much more worth it.
Then I close my eyes, remembering every detail of the most enjoyable night I have ever spent. Every night my brain is a mosaic of images. The jut of Draco’s skinny hips beneath me. His tidily trimmed public hair, the gold of it darker than the hair on his head. I remember the way that Draco’s lips parted as he orgasmed, slick, bitten, and how his whole body trembled, melting into mine. It was a work of art, more glorious than anything hung in the National Gallery.
Harry loved the predictable domesticity their small family shared. The hours of the day, the days of the week, all neatly split up into lovely schedules. Draco, Daisy, and he all knew where to be and what to do. Harry liked it that way. Their life was family dinners, and bath time, and Saturdays with Teddy. It was coffee in the mornings, tea in the afternoons. It was finding Draco’s eyes and asking if it was alright to kiss him and it was Draco’s hand being held out for him to take, an invitation to loop his arm around his waist or rest his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry had brought his broomstick to give Teddy a few little flying tips. The boy has hardly done anything else between the holidays, according to Aunty. I watched the two of them, sat under Andromeda’s thorough warming spells on the patio, drinking away my tea. I had ginger and lemon tea – Andi already started giving me quizzical looks, I ought to tell her soon.
“I’m surprised they’re allowing phones at a school,” Harry muses.
beginning diary, though I’m fully aware of how awful Draco must be feeling if James Evans is the other father of his baby.
are involved in Harry’s relation to that particular woman.
Harry scowls at the food on his plate. Cottage pie. It’s stodgy and thick; the potato is greasy with melted butter. He imagines how it’ll sit, lodged in his belly; how heavy and nauseated he'll feel.
I interrupted my ramblings real quickly because very ridiculous tears were welling up, and I intent on fully putting the blame on my hormones acting up.
. Bloody git, come here.” Then Ron’s arms wrap around the two of them, rough and gentle all the same, and it makes both Harry and Hermione give a laugh that might as well be a sob.
The rest of his friendships had collapsed like a house of cards. It was hard, Draco supposed, to maintain attachments when you felt anxious about leaving the house. There were so many places that Draco couldn’t go anymore. Not to Diagon Alley, or to the pub, or to watch Quidditch. Fitzgerald might have been lurking those places, so Draco couldn’t visit any of them. Greg and Cormac had visited, and they had sent owls, but Draco’s increasingly petulant refusals had put them off. The invites had lessened, and then they had stopped entirely.
Harry shrugs, eyes and thoughts on Draco’s collar. Harry’s hands follow his gaze, stroking fabric and the delicate skin of Draco’s neck.
“I was just about to come and get you,” Draco managed, after a couple of seconds had passed. I- I think it’s time to Firecall Healer Bartsch. I think- I know this is it. The plum. It’s time.” He took a couple of deep breaths before standing up again. “I’m terrified, Harry. Not sure that I’m strong or brave enough for this.”
The Ministry guy is currently regaling them. “Thing is, shops buy them when? In autumn, of course, because what idiot buys a broomstick when all there is is rain and thunderstorms, right? But then they are stored there, untouched for pretty much half a year. And when people start buying them again-” The guy licks his lips and starts gesturing with his hands for emphasis. “Let’s say as a little Easter pressie for their kid. Let’s say, a wizard wants to get a broom for his son, but all he can afford is one of these imports that were bought all these long months before. And the thing is, the charms are all worn out and rusty.” Percy’s colleague gestures, looking around for approval. “That’ll get us in a fine mess then.”
It doesn’t matter that he
Harry turns around in his chair. “What?”
Although I would’ve loved to agree with all his suggestions for our dates, I told him that I can’t do overnight stays. I simply don’t want to. He’s a nice chap, Kayden, but I’d miss dinner with Potter all the time. And he has taken to cooking all the things that I like. After every meal he wants to know what I enjoyed and didn’t enjoy, and he tells me to be blunt with him. He’s a great cook. I never used to think much about food, just needing some small meals to sustain myself, but eating together has become sort of a ritual.
“It’s just . . .
Again, Harry nodded, desperate, and his throat was thick with suppressed want. That was all Draco needed to move his fingers that were trailing against Harry’s abdomen before they reached lower, tightening his grip around Harry’s shaft, right below the hand, and Harry couldn’t help the pleased groan escaping his mouth.
all the time.”
It occurred to me just now that I had never slow danced with a man before. I have slow danced with Pansy and Daphne for fun before, but that’s not quite the same for obvious reasons.
That, dearest Harry, was how you managed to convince Draco to accompany you to the Weasley bonfire party. If ever, in the future, you happen upon these words again, be reminded that tonight was, without a shadow of a doubt, their finest party yet.
Draco clears his throat and continues, slow and careful, “After my father had been arrested?”
A loneliness seizes Harry, one of the sort that has been absent for the past months, for there had
But Harry doesn't run when it gets too much. Or when he does, it's with Draco's fingers entangled with his own between the chairs at the Burrow or pushing their way through crowded venues. Harry took Draco to Gorgoroth and told him that the vocalist is gay. After the first few minutes of shock about the music and, “
, but odd nevertheless.
“Harry,” he introduces himself. He fists his hand in his coat pocket, feeling torn between shaking this bloke’s hand and just nodding at him. He goes for the latter, naturally feeling stupid right after.
hates everything that’s even remotely sex-shaming, and he went up to her and told her to watch it. The bloke she was with didn’t like that, and he and Tarquin sort of had a stand-off there. The guy shoved him, but I talked some sense into him. Got him out without having any punches thrown.”
Watching Draco, Harry leans his head against him. Nothing warms him like the look in Draco’s eyes, riveted by the beauty of the sea. “I could get used to seeing you like this,” Harry says.
“Pardon?”
They obsess about the The Killers and the singers new solo album, one of which tracks plays next, somehow ending up talking about how tired they are of listening to Katie Perry which Draco dryly comments with, “The merits of a lonely life, Potter,” and they tease each other about the Potter-Malfoy-dilemma again until Harry can see the change in Draco’s whole posture, his composure dissolving into half-sung-half-whispered lyrics, shoulders and foot dangling from the peak of his knee wagging to the beat in light, insinuated movements.
“I can arrange that, darling,” Draco murmured, and then he kissed Harry, deep and slow, while guiding him back to lie down, head on the soft pillow.
“Pardon me?” Draco cut in, feeling his jaw drop, scandalised at the image that Harry had painted. “My friends wouldn’t ever do such a thing! They’re my family!”
Reluctantly, Harry returned to his seat. “I love you,” he said, reaching across the table and taking Draco’s hand.
I must say, it feels odd to be back at Shell Cottage. The last time I was here wasn’t long before the battle, and every nook and cranny of the place reminds me of the past. The same sea-glass and shells are fused with magic to the walls, and the place is as weathered as it ever was all those years ago. I’ll take Draco for a walk on the dunes this afternoon and buy him an ice-cream from the cafe in the village.  The plum has already shown us how much they like it. Every time Draco eats a Cornetto in the deckchair, they give him the most dreadful kicking. Last time, I swear I saw the perfect outline of a little foot.
Eventually, Harry swallows.
“I’m good,” Draco says casually, and then he promptly draws his wand and summons a bottle of Hendrick’s Gin and two bulbous glasses to the table. With another waft of magic, the glasses suck the clear liquid from the black bottle. An ice cube added to the glass emits a dulcet succession of chimes. “Lemon, cucumber, thyme?”
Making a MoonStar from scratch in slightly less than a fortnight wasn’t a small undertaking, especially when the height of the Christmas rush was hitting, and Diagon Alley was full of busy wixen, all of them ready to spend their Galleons and entirely bereft of patience. The days passed in a blur, and I didn’t see hide nor hair of Draco.
” Harry admitted, a whisper in between Draco’s sheets. “
“I’d rather not,” Draco says, coolly.
for thinking all these things, it becomes so unbearable that he can’t fight the tears and a dry sob that he muffles by biting into the side of his hand.
“Sanctimonia, purity. Grandfather Abraxas had always thought it meant
In fact, we had our first row about that the other day. Draco is adamant that he won’t visit St Mungo’s even though it seems like the natural course of action to me. I know I’ve been nagging him a little (make that a
“ Draco turns to the aunt- “you are the most pretentious- No, I’m not talking to you. We’re leaving.” Draco turns, cheeks heated with a whirlwind of emotions, heart pumping. “Harry, we’re leaving, we’re leaving.”
But how wrong he was, Harry thinks when he remembers the night following the battle. He woke long after darkness had fallen over a castle like a Stasis. The debris and destruction were devoid of screams and spells, making Harry feel like walking a museum. The Great Hall, a crypt for that night, mourned with a peaceful gravity, a hundred stars in their silent vigil above the dead.
insisted on trailing along, Auror Potter.” He can feel Potter’s eyes on him, only briefly, but it’s enough to make him regret speaking with him with such a cold professionalism. It’s his sacrosanct rule on the job, and Draco has a hard time letting go of his self-imposed rites.
“I will write to Teddy,” Harry finds himself mumbling, voice slurred with brandy and sleep. “She’s right, Andromeda. I should try to explain that and tell him I’m here now. Tell him I’m not going away again.”
“It’s fine. It wasn’t working, what I tried. Might as well come back to it with a fresh mind.”
Boring, straightlaced Potter, who had listened and had believed him. He’d never once let Draco down, and he hadn’t asked for a thing in return. Draco looked up at Harry through eyes that smarted and a head that ached. Draco nodded his consent, and let himself be held in arms that were warm, protecting and solid.
In the dark room, the covers pulled up to under his chin, Harry digs through the quilts until he finds the familiar heat of Draco’s body. He is scared to be lying there alone. Draco takes his hand and squeezes the way he sometimes does, firm and lingering as though he’s afraid that Harry might slip away, and Harry totally gets that because gloomy thoughts lurk in the corners of his mind; thoughts that make him feel restless.
Everything in Harry screams at him not to confide his thoughts but right here and now, he feels compelled to be honest with Draco. He says, “I don’t think I deserve it. Love and care.” After a moment, Harry adds, “I’m starting to feel guilty again when I’m with you.”
Everything was all planned and prearranged for the twenty-sixth of June. The bags were packed, and waiting by the door, the film was waiting in the camera, and Andromeda had made sure to pack a dozen pumpkin-flavoured energy bars to keep Draco’s strength up. Yesterday was a very quiet, sedate day. Astoria and Blaise came over with ice-cream, and the four of us lazed in the garden, enjoying the early summer sun.
“We could try to restore it,” Harry finds himself suggesting, not meaning the Doxy-infested curtains but rather the whole Manor. He can’t get over the gleam in Draco’s eyes while he talks about these things, and if there’s anything he can do to keep it there, Harry will do it.
And while Harry was perfect at providing a sense of rationality and safety, and he was great at being considerate with Draco, at all times, Draco was just as great at finding excuses to indulge them a little. When Daisy was playing, he’d settle in behind Harry and massage his shoulders. When Daisy was taking her afternoon nap, Draco would lead Harry into the bedroom where he’d straddle Harry’s lap and kiss him for at least ten minutes straight. And sometimes in the morning, Draco would ask, “May I?” and he would shove his hand down Harry’s boxer shorts to rub his morning wood into a blissful orgasm.
It was bizarre, really. Once the idea of buying sex had entered my head, I knew that I had to follow through with it.
“I think that it can be fun from time to time. But I do get the idea that you do this every day.”
And so, Draco did. He loved sex, and he was good at it. Draco was free with his body. He had adventurous sex with whomever he fancied. Sometimes Draco let other people watch. Sometimes he performed for his lovers and indulged their kinks. When Draco topped, he was generous and patient with his paramours. When Draco bottomed, he made sure his boyfriends had a brilliant time.
Fitzgerald talked throughout, inane bosh about how well Draco was taking his cock, and how sexy Draco looked. Fitzgerald’s thrusts were erratic, and made a loud groan as he climaxed. He pulled out seconds later. Ejaculate spilled out of Draco and across the sheets.
I believe he is, at least. If I had to bet all the Galleons in my vault on it, I’d willingly do so. Something instinctive – something in my gut – is telling me that he’s expecting, and maybe – it’s possible, I think – that the baby could be mine.
Harry wakes, covered in sweat, the distinct images of eyes—blue? or were they brown?—in his mind. He whirls around to properly see the other side of the giant bed, but it’s empty, the sheets crumpled but cold. It takes him a moment to recall the hotel suite he booked this time, so similar and yet so different to the last one, to realise that the low murmur probably comes from within the suite rather than the neighbouring one. Determined to calm his breathing, Harry sits still, eyes closed. He decides to go out onto the balcony where the twilight lacerates into the dawn of a golden autumn day and a couple, possibly a few years younger than him, are making out by the untended bar.
Maybe it was the effort of Flooing – I’m not sure for how much longer he’ll be allowed to do it – but Draco was exhausted, and his magic almost completely depleted. As always, I followed Draco up the stairs at the allotted time and entered his bedroom. Draco stripped off his jumper, and the two of us lay face to face on top of the sheets. His bump was between us, rounder now, a curve under my palms. Magic thrummed through me, and I could tell that our little plum was ravenous for it.
Teddy is still the person towards whom Harry feels the most shame. He needn’t be, he knows that. Teddy, who wore his hair a beautiful chestnut-brown for Christmas, is a quiet but happy-seeming boy who likes to share his thoughts with Draco. Harry was happy simply listening to the two of them speak, and every time Teddy glanced at him, failing to be furtive about it, Harry smiled at him in an attempt to seem friendly and approachable.
“I’d think that you give yourself quite enough of that. I’d rather remind you of all the world-saving you’ve done.”
Malfoy arches his eyebrows, glimpsing at him. “I bet you are. You must be.” For an odd moment, they smile at each other. Harry snuggles his face into the crook of his arm, head and chest light with a pleasant tingle. He thinks that, maybe, Malfoy’s smile looks flirtatious or maybe the way Harry snuggles into his own arm crook is.
His bump has dropped in the last few days, which the Mediwizards tell us means that our little one is getting themselves into a good position, ready to be born. It’s an exciting sign. Our plum is a proper little wriggler. They kicked for the first-time during week twenty-six, and I’m not going to fib: both Draco and I were more than ready to experience the movements of the little life that we have made.
. Wait a second—
I thought Draco looked very young in the picture. It was sunny in the image, and a breeze caught in his hair. I watched a little peacock pecking his way around Narcissa’s feet. Draco must have caught me looking, because he nodded to the picture, wanting to draw my attention onto it.
And Harry tried to explain why it became unbearable to spend his evenings after work as an Auror at Grimmauld Place where every shadowy corner bore a memory about either deceased people or being penned up with Ron and Hermione before the Horcrux hunt. He didn’t want to start talking about everything that’s wrong with the Aurors which would lead him to talk about their awful way of handling press briefings and the way the
“A conservationist then,” the other bloke, the one with the beanie, chimes in, and Harry affirms that, muttering how that is exactly why he needs a break from his studies, and the group chuckles with amusement for some reason, maybe just to be in on the joke. The kick of lying mixes thrillingly with the spirit as they keep on talking, making plans to find a bar or, perhaps, a club.
If I told Draco the truth, I could cease all of his fears in a single moment, but then I would lose him, and the plum forever. I’m not sure that I’m ready for that.
Harry tells her how beautiful her hair is and starts running his hand through sleek strands of fiery red hair, for some reason in his blurry mind wishing it would be much longer than shoulder-length. They talk about hair and somehow, the flow of the conversation leads them over brushes to a talk about animal rights, and how Aanya can’t fathom the idea of ending another life only to sustain hers. “Who am I?” she says, gesturing towards herself, eyes full of emotion. “Who am I to be indirectly responsible for, let’s say, the death of a chicken? Have you ever seen a chicken? Like, have you ever petted one? Felt its warmth? Or watched it walk around and peck seeds?”
either. And when I see you- When I
So, this is the story as it currently stands. Mrs Zabini cottoned on very quickly to Draco’s expectant state. The older woman’s senses are very attuned to the magic of the people surrounding her – I think she may have some degree of Veela inheritance – and she very quickly turned against Draco. I don’t doubt it would have been a different issue had he been courting, and worn a handsome diamond on his finger, but he could neither name the other father, nor explain the circumstances of his pregnancy.
Inspiration hit him. Draco tried to roll out from beneath the other wizard. If he could only get on top, then maybe he could switch things up a bit. Sex should be a pleasure and a joy, and right now, Draco felt like nothing better than a fuck toy. That wouldn’t do at all. He tried to writhe and fight out from beneath Fitzgerald’s grasp.
, Harry thinks—that harboured another sleepless soul that night. They were found as though they had been looking for one another; freezing to the ground at the sight of an unmistakable silhouette in the distance, before wordlessly meeting on the platform. They stood there, side by side, faces to the sky.
But he shook his head instantly, scattering more kisses across the strained skin. “You’re so handsome,” he said. “And you’ve practically been glowing since you became pregnant. You look beautiful.”
Draco nods.
“It was just you,” Draco snapped snidely, amazed anew how his friends could turn even the most enormous – and yes, most fabricated! – gossip of his short life back on themselves. Well, he supposed they were both Slytherins. Self-centred came with the territory. He grumpily ate a peppermint Every Flavour Bean before he spoke again. “We needed somebody to copy our homework from, Nottster. Why else do you think we kept you around? I assure you, it wasn’t for the witty repartee!”
back then. And I also don’t refer to coke as
talents. Care to share a few of them with me?”
rather than a bloody Jinx.
I’m utterly beside myself all the time. Both Pansy and Blaise keep telling me how tired and pale I look. I couldn’t even focus on hanging all the garlands in the ballroom for the Yule Charity Ball that Pansy is organising. It felt like I had to double the effort to wield even a spark of magic. She watched the disaster, thin-lipped and with her eyebrows raised, until she dismissed me with the comment that I was doing more damage than I was helping.
Draco nodded, his cheeks pink. He was biting his bottom lip, one of his anxiety tells. He allowed me to lead him over to the bed and he carefully climbed on. The Mediwizard looked down at him, giving him a moment to get comfortable. “If you could lift up your shirt for me,” he said, “and wriggle down your trousers, so I can reach your lower stomach, that would be excellent.”
“Hello stranger,” Ginny said, holding up her glass in a slightly drunken gesture of greeting. “If it isn’t Draco Malfoy! The lost Crup, returned to society! Everyone’s been talking about you, Malfoy. The gossip columns are as dull as ditch water without your antics!”
So deep was Draco in his tangle of thoughts that when he felt a hand touch his arm he nearly jumped from his body. Fuck, but he was
For mother the bump would be family, would be
And the best thing about these bands is that it feels like they are highly unpopular. They are nothing like the stuff they show on the music channels in the telly, or the stars they write about on the front pages of newspapers. With their fake smiles and their fake personas. With their pretentious sneers and their bloody self-importance, readily selling every last bit of their dignity for a minute of screen time or a big headline. All it takes for the whole world media to have a field day with you is shaving your hair off and proclaiming You Want a Piece of Me; it’s pathetic.
Draco let himself be Side-Alonged back to St Swithin's Crescent with Harry. He was in a state of raw shock, and so he let the other wizard cosset him, wrapping him in a blanket and bringing him hot, sweet tea.
Harry grins and continues his teasing, turned on by how hard Draco already is for him. He rubs his cheeks against Draco’s rock-solid erection, feeling and taking in the scent of the leaking precum that wets the dark fabric. Eventually, Harry takes mercy on Draco and tugs at the pants until Draco lifts his hips so he can free him of his last clothes.
The way Malfoy says it, sincere and factual, eyes on Harry, and his hands folded in his lap as though he’s nervous- it annoys Harry. “Well, yes. You’d be bloody dead without me,” he says, trying not to look at him because he’d see how insecure Malfoy looks.
“Better get working then, Potter,” I said, and I saw in his eyes that he’d try.
Harry laughed rather heartily at that, and he commented, “You can be the judge of that when the plum arrives. You haven’t seen Teds before he was a crafty little toddler. I have an inkling that you’re about to change your mind in just a few months’ time.”
, the man recalls Draco’s words in mockery. And the woman scrutinises their shoes as they take a few steps into the narrow hallway, past the Dursleys.
I have two things I need to digest somehow.
All Harry can think about is to get into a horizontal position as he stands up, feeling shaky on his knees. Still, he’s well enough to find his way to the couch on his own, and he tells Draco so.
“I didn’t mean that. Sorry if I phrased that poorly,” Hermione concedes, cautious. "Quite the contrary. I meant that if you
“There is someone indeed but, you see, it’s not meant to result in progeny.”
Potter’s owls kept tapping on Draco’s window with notes asking him to drink awful tea in Muggle establishments. The two of them went for walks around Muggle parks, and gazed at the Christmas lights hung up in their high streets. Draco never spoke much on their outings, and Harry didn’t push him. Instead, Harry would tell tedious stories of the bike rides that he and Teddy had taken, or the criminal cases he was investigating, and Draco would listen.
And Harry spent half a minute laughing and squeezing Draco back before he said, “
Journal, deep inside, I’m a weak and simple man. Do I believe such high-aimed promises? No. Do I need someone to carry out my fights or help me off a bed as though I’m in invalid? No. Do I want Harry to say these things to me? Fuck, yes.
“I can see you guys, you know?” Teddy sighed deeply.
“You don’t?”
Draco Malfoy had always been very sure of what he wanted in life. Of course, what he wanted was not always possible, but his father taught him that, in that case, he should surround himself with people who would make it possible. Draco’s father had always told him that that was what relationships had always been based on – need, usefulness, and power. People like to put fancy words on that like ‘
But Teddy was more important. Even if he lied or at least did his best to hide the truth, Teddy was still Draco’s best friend and the Slytherin felt like Potter had breached their truce by stealing Teddy over for the next two months of holidays.
“Okay! I’ll tell Sirius and Remus! Thank you.”
“Come on, Edward. Would you, please, close this book and join us for an Exploding Snap tournament?” he asked, annoyance clear in his voice.
Harry sighed deeply again and turned his head to show him the scar behind his right ear.
“What’s going on?” Pansy asked curiously.
Draco was too shocked to react. He certainly didn’t except Pansy to come up and slap the girl in the face.
This time, Harry turned his head and let him access his lips. It was soft and calm. Harry put an end to it by pushing a hand against Draco’s chest.
“Ok… I’ll talk to him…” Harry’s voice mumbled.
Harry got up and turned the mirror so Draco could see too. He came closer to the door and open it.
“Okay, I guess. What about you?”
Harry nodded but once again, he hesitated.
“It’s Tracey… she… last week, during the party she wanted to… well, you know.”
“Cheers!” everyone else responded.
“We have nothing in common…”
“Teddy! Wait! It’s not what I meant!” Harry tried to stop him, but Draco grabbed his wrist before he could run after his brother.
One day, Teddy had asked Draco to meet him on the Quidditch Pitch on the early morning and at first, Draco had been worried something might be wrong with his friend. Then Draco had seen that Potter was in the Pitch at this unholy hour too, and he had felt betrayed.
But that wasn’t very convincing and both Draco and Teddy gave him a disbelieving look, so he started sulking.
“Hum… Can you lock the door, please?” Harry asked nervously.
“No, I’m not!” The Gryffindor denied immediately.
“As she should be,” Granger nodded. “It’s not a very serious career choice! Only a handful of people can do that. And maybe you’re good here in school but professional competition is a whole next level!”
But Draco wasn’t listening. The tears were burning his eyes and Draco never cried! It wasn’t up to the Malfoy Heir standard at all!
“Oh, so Nymphadora was the one to break the family tradition?” Draco joked.
“He knows,” Draco told him. “He was just messing with you…”
Someone – probably a Weasley – spanked the punch and Harry had been even more handy than usual that evening so they finally did it… Not in Teddy’s bed! Mind you! But well, a transfigured desk in a deserted classroom was as comfortable as anything and they didn’t really have time to think about that anyway!
Draco had learnt his lesson well. He knew most of the people around him were kind or mean to him depending only on what they thought about his parents… or more often what their own parents thought for younger people. So, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested for being a Death Eater and couldn’t get his way around it, Draco knew immediately that his own world was finished and nothing he ever wanted would ever be possible anymore…
Draco snorted. He didn’t know how to deal with that kind of emotion.
“I get what you mean… But seriously, if he’s with Snape right now, he’s probably on the best hands he could find in the Castle!”
“Why don’t you go find Hermione if you’re that unhappy not to be in a relationship Ron?” Teddy asked pleasantly.
He took his head into his hands and dove into those watery emerald eyes.
Teddy grimaced.
“Well, I certainly don’t see him naked as often as you do, but he does spend some time at my house every now and then…”
“What?” Draco choked.
“We are just wondering if everything alright,” Draco explained – Gryffindors could really be useless sometimes. “You seem a bit down lately…”
“No way I’m sleeping with that! You find a way, but I don’t want to hear you!!”
“Do you think I’m strange?” Teddy continued. “I mean… I’m a boy, I should be eager to just… do it? No?”
Next, Harry showed him a burn on his forearm. “Six too, let the bacon burnt because I was… probably thinking about something else… My Uncle was already late…”
Silent greeted them again. Yeah… awkward.
When he entered, Harry was still in his quidditch uniform, his head on his hands, slightly groaning.
It was strange to say all that out loud. So not worthy of the
“Sorry, I don’t want to…” Teddy muttered without even looking up.
Potter frowned.
It was okay. They could make this work… Draco thought. Most of his doubts about Harry’s willingness to keep their relationship hidden were long gone.
Draco didn’t have much time to smarten himself on the mirror though as Harry was pulling his arm to catch into a long kiss.
“Thank you, Draco! Thank you so much!”
“The many others…” Draco nodded but received a glare from Harry in return.
“What’s wrong with you?” Draco sneered back.
“What is it? Was it bad? Are you uncomfortable?” Draco inquired.
So, Potter told Draco how Teddy seemed to have been through a break down on Christmas Day. And Draco told Potter when he noticed, despite Teddy always talking about his large and loving family, none of them seemed to ever owl the boy. Not even his godlike godfather who didn’t seem to have time to spare on his beloved godson, even for Christmas or for Teddy’s birthday. Draco was mad at the man even if he didn’t know him.
“No! Good night.”
“I can’t seriously suggest Zabini, could I?”
Draco looked at him carefully. Wasn’t he aware of who Pansy was?
“Aren’t they cute~” Teddy teased comfortably seating between his guardians.
“Now, you’re staring…” Potter growled.
“Well… I can certainly see you right now so I might not be blind…” the girl answered dreamily.
“Not everyone! You can talk to your friends, obviously. I mean, Teddy knows but… I don’t want everyone to know… I… please?”
In the end, Draco had asked Harry if it was okay if he talked to Black about what was going on and he agreed, as long as he wasn’t there. So, Draco asked Lord Black to meet him for the next Hogsmeade weekend. Harry was forbidden to go anyway – he apparently had to get back on his Defence against the Dark Art essay urgently.
“Yeah? Well, he just screwed Teddy’s girlfriend and, apparently, Teddy’s best friend too! So, no…” Harry snapped.
Black had listened and said nothing for a long time. It was just as Draco started wondering if he should just go that the man spoke.
“She promised to come over to Grimmauld for New Year Eve. We were mostly okay last week, before the exams… I don’t know where she is…”
“And do you really think it can wait… now…”
” he cast on the door. “Don’t worry, I won’t touch you…” he mumbled next to Draco.
Teddy: this scene happened between chapter 24 and 25
“Draco don’t…” Teddy tried to stop him, but the spell was already on his lips.
“Let me just tell my friends so they don’t worry, okay?” Draco said.
“What would you say about coming over tomorrow to play some Quidditch?” Draco found the courage to ask eventually.
“They’re my family and I love them anyway…” Harry said but he turned a little more serious a few seconds later. “Did you tell your mother yet?”
“Draco knows that, once he will be done experimenting, I’ll be waiting for him…” she said, matter-of-factly, putting an overly manicured hand on Draco’s tight.
And Draco looked at his big perfect emerald eyes. He wanted to kiss him, to lean on his shoulder and let him tell him that everything would be okay. But they weren’t there yet, were they?
“What about him? They are his guardians too and he didn’t seem to mind…”
“How would you know…”
“Edward?” he called. He couldn’t get bored of the grimace sprouting on his friend’s face when he called him by his proper name. “Can I talk to you?”
“No, the match is only two weeks away, I don’t want him to slither around anymore!” Johnson ordered firmly.
“Yeah, too bad, I’m not into girls…” Draco sighed, pushing Teddy off his lap. “I’m only into the Harry.”
“Well, we sure had had time to think,” Draco started but bit down his tongue at Harry’s sharp glare.
Draco sent him a quizzingly look.
“I love you too. Take care of him.”
Draco frowned. “You want to break up?”
“Teddy! Teddy, do you hear me?! What is it?!!!” Harry’s voice resonated in Draco’s ears and he jolted to see the Gryffindor trying to get a reaction from the crouched form of Teddy.
It had been a good game though. Draco had felt that he had hardly ever flown that well before. The full year of almost professional training and the additional effort he had put with Harry since the beginning of that year had given them some new moves.
“I was five or six, dropped the plates while doing the dishes… they broke… They were my Aunt’s favourite… wedding gifts and all. She hit me with a frying pan…”
“No!” Harry almost yelled. “I… no. I don’t!”
“We… shouldn’t…” Potter croaked.
“What do you mean? Of course, we are! You asked me out!”
“… oh, but you definitely have second thoughts, haven’t you Draco?” Pansy mocked.
Harry stayed silent and for a moment Draco wondered if he was pissed.
Teddy was clearly uncomfortable and looked away again.
“Did I wake you?” Harry asked softly.
A silence.
“Wicked…” Harry muttered, and his voice echoed in Draco’s mirror.
Teddy told him that he envied Draco’s and Harry’s relationship because it looked so real. Of course, the boy was going out with his 3rd girlfriend that year, but he told Draco that it wasn’t the same and that they were merely playing around while Harry and Draco weren’t.
Harry sniffed loudly in his arms. Draco held him tightly.
it coming, right?
Draco smirked softly. “Maybe the disappearance of two 5th year prefects, one of whom was supposed to be on duty tonight, didn’t go unnoticed?” he offered.
That night, he sat down with his friends in the Slytherin Common room. He was just back from his Prefect round; he had switched place with Pansy so he could be with Teddy for a change. The boy had been going out with a Ravenclaw girl, but Draco doubted it would last.
“Shagging you until you forget how to ride a broom…” Draco confirmed, and Harry’s lips were on his again.
At least, Teddy was no longer burying himself in his endless studies about changing the world and he seemed truly happy, so Draco was happy too. Even if those girls would never be good enough for him. Draco agreed with Harry when he mentioned Granger’s crush on Teddy… The two would be good together. But it wasn’t his business and if Teddy didn’t see the girl like that… well, too bad for her.
“Harry, you’re late,” Teddy only said. “I’m waiting for you outside.”
“Because you wanted to know!” Harry said defensively. “You’re always touching them! Don’t deny it, I noticed it, you know!”
“Come on! Don’t make me call Black to know!”
“Because, your punishment is, that you will have to listen and not question and accept that you can’t do anything about it, okay?”
Draco and Potter had watched their friend recollecting on the edge of the Black Lake. Then, they had walked him to the Castle as Professor Sprout had asked to see him and Draco had left when they met Sirius Black – now Lord Black – his mother’s infamous cousin. Draco’s mother had talked to Draco about the man in her letters that year. She wasn’t sure how they should act regarding him yet. He was a wild card. So, Draco decided to keep it as neutral as possible. The man clearly had prejudices against him already and, even if Teddy defended him, he didn’t want to stay near the man longer than necessary… So, he had left Teddy with Potter and went back to his Common Room.
“Well… at least, it’s clear now…” Teddy mumbled, he even tried to smile but his two friends could see how dull his turquoise hair had become.
“It’s rude to keep an old woman waiting…” Narcissa said evenly when she understood that he was very purposefully taking his time.
“Do you want me to ask you out?”
“You… You’re disgusting,” she spitted. “How dare you?!!”
Harry sighed. “It’s Teddy, alcohol made him quite sad…”
On the 1st of September, Draco arrived early at the station as his mother needed to be somewhere else at 11 but still wanted to go with him. It was ridiculous as he was 15 now, but who was he to deny his mother?
Teddy looked at him before looking away.
“That could be an idea, yeah…” Harry agreed while yawning.
“I see…” Blaise said while playing. “Muggles are stupid,” he added.
Teddy was doing so much better. It seemed that he had completely given up on his research mission. Which was good… Draco thought.
“Sirius! They’re only fifteen! Narcissa, say something!!” Lupin tried to engaged Draco’s mother who was already holding her own flute.
They had been riding for two hours already when Draco got sick of it.
Draco froze. “You’re kidding, right?”
“Thank you! I am so excited! Do you know what our position really entails? I tried to find some more information on Hogwarts History – Prefect edition, but I think the book is incomplete.”
“No,” Harry answered, far too serious.
Harry jolted up and almost fell on the floor if it was not for Draco catching him before it was too late. The Slytherin glared at Teddy who was waiting by the door, a smirk on his stupid perfect face.
“Do you want to know about my skincare routine?” Draco continued speaking in a really slow space. “Magic can do wonder, you know…”
Draco shook his head. “Why are you only suggesting Gryffindors?!”
“I know, I won’t tell…” Blaise sighed, understanding his silent thoughts.
“Oh? Should I offer you my shoulder?” Draco said, turning his hand slightly so Harry’s fingers would cross his.
Teddy was nothing like anyone Draco had ever met. He was kind and funny, yet he could scheme and tease. The boys knew things… too many things for his own good. Yet, he didn’t seem to use this knowledge to lure people around him. Draco’s mother had always said that knowledge was power. She had been the perfect wife to his father for years, listening and laughing pleasantly to his partners’ dubious jokes while silently taking away crucial pieces of information. And when the time came for her to save herself and her son from Lucius Malfoy’s disastrous choices in life, she used those pieces of information wisely.
Draco watched as Pansy gave Theo a kiss. Circe, but they really were nauseatingly in love. That had been half the reason Draco had fibbed. Everyone he knew was paring off and finding happiness, and all Draco had wanted was a little slice of that for himself. He knew he’d made some bad choices in the past, but was that really too much to ask for?
Average income this month: 185 per hour, but I also worked less than usual.
The other children used to talk a lot about what Santa Claus might bring them, be it the latest game, or a brand-new bicycle. I was always wise enough to keep my mouth shut. I wasn’t foolish enough to think there'd be anything in my stocking apart from hard work.
But the heat Draco radiates from resting his head on his shoulder is all Harry can focus on. He rubs his cheek against Draco’s, determinately scratching the stubble that’s starting to sprout into a full-on beard over Draco’s smooth-shaven skin.
I’m so relieved that we’re back to sleeping with each other now, that it feels right for me. Circe, I can’t wait for tonight. I hope that I won’t be as tired and exhausted as I’ve been the past few days because all I can think about right now is that I want him inside of me. When he fucked between my thighs yesterday, it was so easy to imagine him rocking his hips against my arse instead, and I hadn’t known until then how much I craved that feeling.
A shudder jolts through Harry’s body as he leans on the balustrade, ice-cold on his forearms, and lets his head lull forward, closing his eyes against the sadness that slowly buds inside his chest. The feeling sprouts, tightening his throat and inevitably stinging his eyes. He needs to change everything. The coke, the risky sex with complete strangers, the heroin—definitely the heroin—and when he’s being really honest with himself, even the drinking. He recognises the symptoms; the insomnia, the tremor that sometimes seizes his whole body and makes him unsteady on his feet, the disorientation and paranoia and memory loss and potency disorder and-
“What Tee is trying, and failing very miserably to express, is that we’re both really pleased for you, love.” Pansy said, twisting a lock of Theo's hair around one of her glossily painted fingertips. “We’ve all been driven half out of our wits listening to your rhapsodising about Harry. There’s never been anybody else for you, has there? Even when we were at school? I knew you were done for during second year. Remember when I found you doodling ‘Draco Malfoy-Potter’ in your book of Basic Transfigurations?”
They have both been surprised how the vast stretch of the land tugs at the bond that is woven into their wedding bands whenever Harry is in the garden and Draco in the atelier. It’s not a strong bond; they don’t feel pain when they’re apart, but the rings pull towards each other inevitably. When they first noticed that it happened within the borders of their new home, Harry had Apparated to Draco, laughing but also close to weeping for a feeling that he didn’t dare investigate further. They kissed and kissed and kissed until they ended up christening the workshop and after that the not-yet-finished terrace below the drawing room, just outside the kitchens, because it was a warm day and Draco pointed out that the whole estate is for only them to use in whichever way they want.
to pop concerts,” he repeats in mockery.
Draco never cared; he never felt anything but impatience or, frankly,
He doesn’t understand why he’s feeling so low. In contrast to Draco who despises the summer for its heat that he doesn’t deal well with, and loves it for the long hours of daylight, Harry enjoys the warmth on his skin, hopeful that it will permeate through to bones that feel so dead-cold at times, heavier than Harry thinks people ought to feel in their late twenties.
Goodness, but I recall the things that I said to him. Did I, in all honesty, call him my Saviour? Having his media name cited back at him will hardly be something he’s happy about. But perhaps that misconception might be better than what I truly meant. He must think me a sappy imbecile.
Draco doesn’t feel much like speaking or explaining anything to the Muggle. He’s not worth his time or his insights, not worth of
As he typed, Draco heard raised voices on the other side of the newsroom. It was Ginny and Cormac, having one of their periodic fall-outs.
It starts to sound as though Malfoy knows what he is talking about. As though he didn’t need his explanations about Muggle drugs. Harry frowns, his gooey brain trying to catch up with this situation. “Yes, well,” Harry feels silly and ineloquent. “See, I’ve learnt a spell to extract that.” Now he feels silly for confiding in Malfoy. There’s no reason why he should feel obliged to explain himself, no matter how unyielding these grey eyes are staring at him. He ploughs on anyway. “I’m extracting it after I come down to . . . not get addicted?”
In a single fluid move, he placed his wand in Draco’s hand and then he backed away.
on most of them, explaining the peaceful quiet of the room.
before I get to call myself a father.”
Harry didn’t speak for a minute. He sat quietly, and seemed to consider what Draco had said. Harry didn’t shift into Saviour Auror mode, insisting that Draco accompany him to the DMLE to make a statement. He didn’t make threats against Fitzgerald, and he didn’t shout that he was going to curse him into ashes. Best of all, Harry didn’t ask for clarification, or demand sordid details, or tell Draco he was right to blame himself; that he’d been drunk and wearing a revealing shirt.
“I didn’t mean to make you worry, Harry. Nothing’s the matter,” Draco said quickly. “Daisy is with Teddy and Andi. She said it’d be alright if she watched after the two on her own for an hour or two.”
you how sexy you are?” I asked and Draco nodded his consent. I slipped to my knees in front of Draco, my pulse racing, my knees pressed hard against the floor of the shower cubicle.
Harry lets himself be held.
handles press briefing, Jesus Christ.
My belly lurched. Of all the nights in my life, the one date that Draco had suggested was the only one that I absolutely couldn’t do. Monday was November the fifth, and I’d already committed myself. I’d promised to buy fireworks and bring my patented Potter fruit punch to the party. If I didn’t turn up, Ron would be weeks before he could bring himself to forgive me.
After that a myriad of questions followed. How long have you known, what have you been eating, have you taken vitamins, do you get enough sleep, and so on and so forth. I didn’t even need to ask for her to tell me about the teas that helped her when she was pregnant with me, and how ginger had made her feel less nauseous.
Harry swallows and nods. “I snorted it though. Regretted that as well. It’s just not the same when you don’t . . .” Feeling a bit helpless and stupid, he gestures to his arm. Draco cups Harry’s cheek with his cold hand and rubs his shoulders, his arms as though Harry might just vanish.
The footsteps pound a heavy rhythm onto the floorboards,dictating Harry’s heartbeat in a fast pace, the door opening, and then closing. Then Malfoy is beside him, clearing the table of their cold tea with a waft of what must be house magic, and putting a copper basin on the table instead, slow, almost reverent, with a slight but unmistakable tremor. It’s big enough that he needs to use both hands. The metal looks time-honoured but polished. A stick is rising from the middle of the bowl, and another horizontal one comes off the peak.
“Harry, these are very old scars. You needn’t . . .” But Draco lapses into silence while Harry shoves the shirt over his bony shoulders and helps him undress his torso completely.
whipping from his tongue like curses. But that was precisely what Harry got from Malfoy.
“The baby looks healthy,” the Mediwizard said, “and a good size for the dates you wrote in your notes Mr Malfoy. Would you like to hear the heartbeat?”
“But of course,” Harry said.
Draco looks at Potter who looks at the ground, face seeming indifferent, mind concentrated on the tip of his boot. Draco hates it when he does that.
Harry holds his breath and clenches his fists. He can’t look at Malfoy now. He stands there and speaks, calm and collected, so Harry glues his eyes down at the gleaming hardwood floor and sucks his teeth. A thousand things he could say stream through his mind, but he presses his mouth shut.
They are in Potter’s home. A crooked house with large windows and a charmingly overgrown back garden. It might as well be Draco’s home. The light feels too bright, the house too silent. There is no one near them, no one who has thoughts and memories and urges, and Draco wonders why Harry seeks the same seclusion as he does, wonders what his reasons are for finding people so obnoxiously loud.
Irritation flares in Harry at Draco’s rueful expression. “Don’t apologise. I’ve been an arsehole and I left like a petulant child. You shouldn’t say sorry for that.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asks when Harry starts to unbutton his shirt.
Harry stands there in the middle of the kitchen, left alone with the lemon scent and his pumping heart. Thinking of just Apparating before Malfoy gets back. Despite himself, curiosity and an odd feeling that obliges him to decorum get the better of him. He waits, eyes on the gently dancing flames in the hearth, the only movement in the room.
Several muscles in Draco’s jaw and throat work before he answers. “Yes, Norma Crabbe. She’s Vince’s great-grandmother.”
Draco didn’t mince his words. He marched to his room and locked the door against me, spending the rest of the afternoon holed up.
“He must’ve felt like he owed his parents after they bailed him out of prison,” Draco muses.
I did as I was told. The Healer told me to give them a shout if Draco woke up. He closed the door behind him quietly. My vision swam with tears that I didn’t deserve to shed, and I wondered how my heart could still beat when it was broken into pieces.
It was at that moment that I suggested he should make one specifically for Teddy. I was surprised that the thought, apparently, hadn't even crossed his mind. I felt a little bit like Potter wasn’t even aware that his hands were able to forge a broomstick that was good enough to be a present for his godson.
“Back in the years after the war, I needed money. Lady Zabini took me in, but she made it clear that she wouldn’t do it for free forever. Also, I had all these reparations to pay for my family. Most of them were paid with the vault that runs under my name, but the fortune did not cover every last Galleon the Wizengamot asked for. So I tried finding work on Diagon, but I was actually too depressed to be working in a retail emporium.”
I’m feeling horrible. I didn’t even drink that much, but I’m feeling so hungover I might as well have drunk Potter’s fruit punch all by myself. I couldn’t even take up on Lady Zabini’s offer to join her for breakfast – the smell of the cooked eggs alone had me gagging.
“You know, I was very,
“I wouldn’t,” Harry answered. “I won’t tell a soul, I promise.”
, tells Harry that Draco doesn’t need words to understand him. In fact, Harry finds that Draco and he have so many things in common that he’s sometimes surprised that he never looked at it this way before. The idea of Draco sneaking through the wizarding world with a glamour wrapped around him won’t leave Harry’s mind, just like he can’t stop imagining a Draco, insouciant and free of the stigma attached to him here in Britain, having the time of his life with his ex-husband while they examine the paintings in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam while tripping on shrooms.
down on the kitchen table and smooths his hand over the paper, feeling the odd texture of the ink under his calloused fingertips. Draco had his elbow on the table, his head propped on his knuckles. He watches Harry apprehensively.
Draco had the most neat and most perfectly pert little belly that I’d ever seen. Merlin but it was entirely beautiful. It took everything I had not to touch it.
Talks ensue under the dim light of a streetlamp, and Harry tries to figure out whether the bloke he’s talking to might be bi-curious or not by running a hand down his own body and grazing his crotch, where his half-hard prick is pressing pleasantly against the rough jeans, and watching the guy
The woman looks amused at that. “Is that so?” She takes a long drag, eyes on Harry. On the back of her hand, the skin looks waxen and covered in age spots, like the hand couldn’t belong to her taut, impeccable face. “Now, what is it, darling? What’s your story?”
“Harry. Or Potter. It’s- It doesn’t make a difference.” Breathing gets harder.
“It’s not the debt that Draco was angry about,” Mike said, twiddling with the soft feather of his quill after I’d finished explaining my long, sorry tale. “I’m sure that there is a part of Draco that is pleased to be free of the burden. It’s your lack of communication that he would have felt bitter about.” My Mind Healer sighed. “I think there’s a couple of big issues going on here, Harry. First is your impetuousness and your tendency to make big choices without consulting the people around you. I think that’s an aspect of your personality that served you in a good way in your younger life. It enabled you to vanquish He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. However, I’m not sure that it translates well to your current existence. Real life is collaborative. It requires communication. Requires compromise.”
Draco was in your nursery, little Cassie plum. He was looking at the big mural of the night sky that your Aunty Luna painted for you when your daddy first moved into Grimmauld Place.
“You sobered me up,” Harry points out, leaning back into the settee. He assumes that they both know it will just take a few minutes to kick in. He glimpses at Malfoy, seated right next to him now. This is so surreal. Beyond surreal. Their eyes meet. He looks . . . somehow the same as he used to but in a different way. He’s still skinny, pale and pointy, and still has the silky-white Malfoy hair which is long on the top and short on the sides. Naturally, he isn’t in a Slytherin uniform, and he also doesn’t wear a black suit, but a simple black dress shirt and these Muggle jeans that for some reason can't help but attract Harry’s gaze.
First, he thought his wallet was broken. It’s a Muggle-esque looking, black thing, magically enhanced to exchange his Galleons into British Pounds, directly retrieving the money from Harry’s vault. It was a gift from a goblin, one who had wanted to rise in favour with the DMLE in order to get a beneficial deal for successfully carrying out sentences against tax evaders and money launderers. The goblin had been more than ready to disclose discrete information, regardless of a probable cause. And while the DMLE would have welcomed such a deal with open arms, counsellors and barristers were always at their necks, possibly righteously outraged by Law Enforcement considering unlawful surveillance fair game for the easy money it makes. And it’s less work and much less of a risk than field work too, insignificant though it feels, at least to Harry.
“Not me,” Harry says, his temple resting on two fingers. He sits slouched into the corner of the settee, affectionate eyes on me. He can sense my interest. Not that I was trying to hide it, but he knows me better than I know myself. And just as visceral, I know what Harry is going to say before he opens his mouth again. But I let him say it. “I’ve had enough prophecies.”
So instead, I tried to stop thinking and just enjoy myself with Potter. I moaned his name (Harry was very responsive to that), and I loved how it sounded so different from the way I normally say it.
Of course, Draco knew that as well, and he cast a sneaky Notice Me Not over the three of them when Harry haltingly started to talk about Teddy’s dad. The boy listened intently to Harry’s every word, very much with the same curiosity Harry always bore for stories about his own parents. “He was empathic,” Harry says when trying to narrow it down to one trait. “
Harry takes a breath and obliges. His lips find Draco’s and he rolls back on his side, trying not to cringe with the way his lifeless prick dangles about before Draco’s fingers are back there, holding firmly onto it, which feels pleasurable if Harry lets himself in for it.
He doesn’t know how long he stands there, listless.
Harry frowns. “When?”
I almost told him then how scared I am of everything. Both, the option of things not working out so well just as much as the reality of having to care for a child. I’m turning twenty-six only shortly before the plum will arrive, and I have no idea how people like Greg and Milly, Daphne, Ronald and Hermione – they all of them have become parents even younger and they don’t seem to struggle at all.
Draco looked like he was about to weep. A sense of pride bloomed in Harry; whether he felt proud of Draco for acting so autonomously or whether he was proud of being able to help Draco- Harry wasn’t sure. But one thing he was sure about was that the most important part about their family was respecting each other’s wants and thoughts, and to dwell in them the more so if they fit together in a perfect synergy like they did tonight.
“That’s not true.”
The elderly wizard nodded his assent, obviously well used to his clientele drinking away their difficulties. With a flick of his wand, the amber liquid poured from the bottle into a mercifully not-too-filthy glass. Tom slid it across the bar to Draco, and he knocked it back straight away. The shock of it burnt his throat and made his empty belly churn uncomfortably.
, and she prescribes a few vitamins and potions against his lack of concentration, and some herb-based pills against nausea and the still occasionally occurring erectile dysfunction. But if her mood is all that Harry has to deal with in order to receive not one odd glance or remark for being
A tight knot lodges in his throat, a fission of nostalgia and regret overcoming him as he draws in a breath. It’s too cold outside, only dressed in a wee towel, and Harry thinks of doing another line of cocaine. Or maybe he should go out and have some fun. Some MDMA rather than blow, just like in the good old times. Meet new people instead of dealing with all these mentals back in the suite
This year’s birthday is hardly different from others. He had hid away at home for the last two weeks, avoiding company like Dragon Pox. On the very day of his birthday, however, not even Draco lets him spend the day secluded. Instead, he’s served a huge pile of pancakes and is then shoved into the shower whilst he hears Draco rummaging through their bedroom.
liked to pretend it was.
we're understanding the other on a deeper level than we actually are. Not because we like each other.” Harry feels like punching him. Draco has at least the decorum to reel, adding an uncertain, “Do we? Because if you only-”
There wasn’t a shag on the planet that was worth accommodating such
“It’s a bedroom,” Harry says softly. “It’s nothing but a bedroom. I can’t feel anything Dark about it. It still smells like sulphur but that's probably because of the curses. But other than that, there’s nothing but a bedroom in here.”
Pushing open the cracked wood of the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron, Draco crossed the threshold. As always, the pub was filled with the less salubrious side of wizarding society, and Draco pushed past them to find a seat at the bar. It was as sticky and as smutted as ever, and Draco sighed. Why couldn’t his life ever be easy? “A shot of Firewhiskeey, Tom,” Draco said to the bartender. “No, scratch that. Make it a double.”
at something in the other room.
But I told her that I felt hardly nauseous anymore, and that she really needn’t worry about me.
I dried the pair of us with a charm, and then the two of us padded through to their bedroom.  “Lay down,” I said, as he propped a couple of pillows behind Draco’s shoulders. “
Wet behind the wand I might be, but I wanted my date to enjoy himself. I believe – I
, his features emotionless and colourless in the white light.
His eyes swivelled onto mine, a little spooked. I doubted many other people would notice – Draco has a very good poker face – but I could see he was frightened.
that’s been missing from his life for quite some years, he realises while getting a few things done around the house that would allow him and Draco more time just for the two of them without responsibilities or work on their schedule.
And he starts to wonder whether he’s empathising with someone he once was or whether the feeling has always been there. That, perhaps, is why it’s been so hard to make out, for perhaps it is ever-present.
. He’d let himself be alone once again, and Fitzgerald had followed him out of the Manor. He wheeled around, scared out of his wits, his hands flying down towards his wand pocket.
“What’s on your mind?” Draco asks, tilting Harry’s head up. He starts shaving his throat and parts of his jawline.
“Yes,” Draco croaks next to him, then he clears his throat. “Yes, your grandfather Fleamont. And his dad, Henry, he’s the one who had the Potters being cast out of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
They end up on the stairs where Harry turns Draco around, shoves his jeans down just enough to bare his arse, incredibly pale between his dark clothes and in the dim stairwell. Harry grins as he takes in the way Draco, neat and quiet Draco is panting, frantically bunching his pressed shirt up so that it’s not in the way when Harry conjures lube and enters him there and then, awkwardly swaying on the steps, both their hands against the rough material of the plastered wall.
Draco would have liked to have locked the door to St Swithins Crescent and never left again, but real life wasn’t like that. Every morning the sun rose, and the world continued, just the same as it always had before. Draco’s life had to continue alongside it.
It was a stupid, pathetic fantasy, and as stupid and pathetic as he was. He was nothing but a stupid, pathetic cockslut, with a reputation that he’d done nothing but live up to.
“You can stay as long as you want, Harry,” John says with kind eyes. Harry regrets telling them his real name. The offer sounds very much like every wixen on this planet, desperate to please Harry, because even while he was still wearing his Auror robes, most wixen still addressed him with Harry and gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder.
Before they leave, Harry makes sure the little bag with the three remaining pills is in his jeans pocket. He tells himself that he’ll only tell Tarquin about it if the night turns out to be really, really good and needs some enhancement to properly enjoy it. Or if the show is complete shit and they end up wandering the empty streets which would be so much more fun with the increased urge to talk, laugh, run. Harry doesn’t argue with the voice inside his head that tells him that they will take the pills tonight, no matter what.
When Harry sits up again, he takes off his shirt, watching the way Draco’s eyes sweep down across his chest, his fingers following his gaze. Usually, Harry doesn’t spend much time ogling or being ogled, but he can’t help enjoying the feeling. This is special. Perhaps because it’s a wizard or someone he’s known since forever. Not someone, but Draco Malfoy who he’d always found infuriatingly attractive, his pallor against the staid mass of students like a magnet that he could never help but follow, like a magnetic pull.
It all would have been perfectly lovely, except that I soon noticed Draco was a little quieter than I was used to. Usually, my friend is buoyant at Christmas, chatty and gossipy about the festive seasons that he’d lived through as a younger man; telling big, extravagant affairs where Lucius would wine and dine the elite of wizarding England. Draco told me last year that, for all the luxury and decorations, the Manor was often a lonely place during the December school holidays.
When he unlocks the door to their dark flat, his gaze goes straight from the little vestibule across the hall, through the combined kitchen and living area, all the way to the window front and their little balcony where Draco is standing, back to Harry, face to the sky. It’s this view that they fell in love with when they first set foot in this flat a few months ago; you come in and you see just as much of your home as you see a framed snippet of today’s sky.
Usually, my pride would have been in the way of agreeing so easily to such a generous offer. Especially since it’s Potter who offers and Hecate knows he’s done enough for me. But I won’t reject anything that will secure the plum’s safety and well-being. I will stay at Grimmauld Place while I’m expecting, and if Harry insists, it shall be the first home that the plum will know.
“Seriously—imagine that they had hated me for that rather than for being the Boy Who Lived. And I’d
. We would have been there for him, would have helped him, right? With whatever he wanted.”
he does, but he can’t fight it this time; the sting behind his eyes, the painful constriction in his throat that only seems to tighten with every failed attempt to swallow all the moisture building in his mouth. A dry sob escapes, and he tries to suck it back into his stomach which suddenly feels very much the same as being starved for several concussive days.
, Draco pointed out—that it looks like the most natural thing for them to wake up and start moving about. Their lifeless eyes are somewhat creepy though.
When later that night people split up, Harry sticks with Carol who’s invited to a house party. The place is ridiculously posh, posher than most places Harry has ever been to, with huge entertaining rooms full of seating areas, unused pianos, and stables beyond the vast spread of pool and garden.
the bottle and only stopped himself at the last moment. He snatches the glass bottle from the middle of the table and pours himself some fizzy water. He drinks. Breathes. Wonders whether he’s forgotten his morphine. Then he thinks about Draco and remembers to his great embarrassment that he told Draco about the morphine and about
Without needing to discuss anything, I got up and lay down on my side. Potter was behind me in an instant, pushing back inside as though he couldn’t bear a few seconds without fucking me. And the thought turned me on so much. Just the urgency of his movements, his deep, pleased groan when he entered my body again, lips right by my ear.
“Merlin. That feels so brilliant,” Draco exclaimed, when I finally found my treasure. I licked and lapped at the head of Draco’s penis, careful not being too rough, knowing how oversensitive the pregnancy hormones had left him.
—Harry thinks that he'd like to listen to him forever. He can’t help but compare the Draco he gets to know now to the Malfoy he used to know and again, he wonders whether Draco had had such vivid interests, such a vivid personality, back in the war or whether that facet had thrived only after, perhaps
Okay, onto the second thing I ought to mention.
“I won’t. You’ve got my word.” He gestured towards the entrance. “Shall I go in first?” he asked. “Then you can see me. You can watch my every move and I promise not to come close. I’m not going to leave you though. I meant what I said back at the Manor, Draco. I’m worried about you.”
“Sorry that I . . . needed to get away.”
Draco looked and sounded decisive, as though he’d planned this exact moment in his head and had played it through over and over again. “Darling,” Harry said softly, feeling the need to slow this down a little. “May I kiss you?”
But back to my one concern: if he’s a wizard and if he’s a Londoner, chances are that I know him and he will certainly know me. I wouldn’t even mind if he was too shy or felt guilty for fancying an ex-Death Eater, but I fear that he has powerful knowledge about me now. No one blackmailed me and there was no news or headlines in the
Malfoy manages to make this situation more awkward by saying, without any kind of preamble, without a fair warning or even the decency of clearing his throat, “I owe you my life, Potter.”
him, and Draco could get onboard with that. The man was into him, and that was a turn-on. Even so, they needed to inject some calm. Everything was suddenly too heated; they'd burn each other if they weren't careful.
“I think I know where it might be,” Potter says. His quiet voice is meant for Draco only, his posture open as he finds Draco’s eyes and holds his gaze for a moment. Behind them, Vernon Dursley wonders whether his nephew is bent on top of it all.
with an amused smile, not stopping jerking Harry.
Before I thought about the consequences of my actions, I typed an email. ‘I like your pictures,’ I wrote without thinking. ‘I’ve gotten hard just looking at them. I imagine the real man would be even sexier. I’d like to spend quality time getting to know you better, Drake. I promise to make it worth your while. James Evans.’
In fear of starting an argument that would only lead to Draco being quiet and too-agreeable for the remainder of the night, Harry tries to get away with silence. Draco downs his drink, eyes fixated unseeingly somewhere behind Harry.
“I suppose you don’t need to know how an Unlocking Charm exactly works in order to cast one.”
– and he’s looking forward to their being here in the world and becoming a dad.
“And I’ll worship every one of them,” I found myself answering, the pads of my fingers walking down from the stretch mark to rest on the taut skin of Draco’s pelvis. “I don’t care if you get a thousand stretch marks. You would be a single Sickle less attractive to me.”
The bedroom is veiled in a blushing shade of orange when they stand in front of the white-sheeted bed, hands on one another’s waists. Harry presses one lingering kiss on Draco’s lips then sits him down on the bed. He stands between his angled legs, reaching in his back pocket for his little vial and snort a spoonful, shuddering with a huge grin erupting on his face. When he composes himself, Draco’s face has lost some of the expectant intensity that his gaze held before, eyes rather obsessing when he turns down Harry’s offer of some coke.
of talents, Malfoy,” he answered. “Though I think if I talked about them here, we’d be on the front of the Prophet, rather than the back. Maybe I’ll give you a practical demonstration, one of these days,” he added. He stared at Draco like he was the only man on earth.
“Forgot that we’re wizards?” Draco says, running a tender hand through Harry’s hair, fixing his fringe by sweeping it backwards.
– would make what was happening to him real, and Draco still couldn’t quite believe that it was.
Harry listens, fascinated, and he fancies to note the exact moment Draco starts to get a bit tipsy because he starts gesturing and his explanations get more excited and colourful. But Harry wouldn’t be surprised to find out that Draco is just genuinely gushing about the possibilities of charmwork.
- to get Draco talking, but what? One thing we haven’t done is buy Teddy’s Christmas present yet. I’ll suggest doing that later this week and ask him to call into Phoenix while I’m working the late shift. If I’m really lucky then I’ll manage to convince Draco to visit The Leaky with me afterwards.
Seeing Draco look at him like that, eyes full of blatant want for him, for shoving this toy inside of him . . . It’s more than a little arousing. And just when Harry thinks that this might be all he needs to have nice sex, even without getting himself erect, the toy moves rather abruptly and causes Harry to jolt. Draco holds him, one hand at Harry’s arse, the other one, arm buried under Harry’s waist, is on the small of his back.
"Right." His brows are furrowed and for a moment, he looks down into his tea. While he takes out the mesh strainer, darkened with the black leaves, he asks, "What do you
Draco wasn’t about to fuck anybody that believed such outdated nonsense.
It couldn’t be
“That will be it if you don’t have to say anything to Harry.”
Harry had never voiced this accusation before and somehow, he found the right words to tell Draco how saying this felt right and simultaneously so terribly wrong because all Ron and Hermione had ever wanted was for him to be okay. That they might have needed his help as well, but all he did was evade them whenever he had a good enough excuse. “
“Er- was okay,“ Draco says, most of his attention on a spell he performs. "I’m owling with a new customer, and I’ve got two more- Well, look at this shit,” Draco groans and implies an Exploding Charm with a flippant gesture of his wand at the cooking pot. “This is the lowest quality copper I’ve ever fucking seen in my- Merlin’s tits . . .”
“Let’s leave it,” Draco said, trying to extricate himself. “I’m knackered. Another time?”
Then there are Harry’s memories, screaming to be seen. A splinter of glass in an impossibly young-looking Harry’s cheek. Shame and guilt, so much guilt and unspoken formulations of apologies to the people who give him a home. Dull pain on the jawbone. A wish to be left alone versus the wish to be hugged and laughed with, just like the other kids.
Perhaps I should talk to Potter about that. He never fails to make me see myself in a different light. We’ve been talking about my work a bit more. I’ve seen the stares he gives me whenever I’m Flooing out to meet a client, so I felt compelled to ask him again whether he was alright with what I’m doing.
Best of all were the number of people he danced and drank with. Everyone was giddy and playful. Fitzgerald was nowhere to be seen, but that was no matter. Draco could find a good time anywhere he went.
a potion for Harry. “I’m not sure what went through my mind. I didn’t mean to stay out for this long, and I didn’t want to scare you. I was so happy that you were home and then I just . . ..”
He gives a stifled laughter then makes himself stop by pressing his lips together and clenching his fists. But the longer he looks at Malfoy, his wiry, tall figure, veiled in black and with that impossibly pale hand that rises to stroke some hair out of his face,
When Harry falls into the lap of a stranger that night that leads him to his knees in the grimy confines of a graffiti-lined bathroom stall, in between
Fitzgerald pushed a finger inside, thick and prying, and he felt his whole body tense up. Draco hadn’t been given a warning, and it didn’t feel pleasant. It felt like a violation, and then Draco knew. He knew that there wasn’t some deep dark secret behind Fitzgerald’s actions. There weren’t any excuses. It was as simple as a first-year charm.
After a few seconds, Malfoy’s stony features are rearranged into a confused expression. “You are not an Auror,” he deadpans. “Who are you? Show yourself.”
say that word, not ever again. Not to anybody else. Fitzgerald could bring you up before the Wizengamot on charges of slander." She looked at Draco with an expression that brooked no disagreement. "Don’t let this have happened to you, Draco. Don’t let one man ruin a life you’ve worked so hard to make."
“It just slipped out!” Draco snapped. “The two of you are shacked up here like love’s young dream while my romantic life is drier than the sodding Sahara! And then, yesterday, when you asked me if I’d made any effort to find a date, it just slipped out.” Slumping his shoulders, Draco sighed. “After that I couldn’t bear to tell you the truth. I lied, and then I roped Harry into the lie as well. I’m sorry.”
“Could you go now?” Draco asked Harry finally, needing nothing more than to be alone.
prizewinning smiles up to his hosts.
, Harry wants to argue, but as the words are on his mind, on his tongue, he feels like that’s the whole point. He takes Draco’s face between his palms to make them look at each other, and he finds agitated despair in the other’s eyes. Harry feels calm and, for once in his life, certain when he says, “I can’t promise you that I’ll never feel the urge to run from my life again. But I’m tired of it, tired of making the same mistake over and over again by running away because I feel ashamed or like I’m not enough. But these doubts, Draco . . . they only lurk in when we’re apart.”
myself. Fuck…
Draco remembered how he’d believed her, and how he’d taken her words to heart. It didn’t sound like Harry was particularly pleased to see Pansy either. His voice was muttered, and furious, and Draco could only make out snippets.
On one wall, Harry finds a few photographs, and in a burst of bravery, he takes a close look at a brown-haired boy, grinning and waving both his arms at him, and he knows that there’s no way that it’s not Teddy Lupin. Harry’s mood doesn’t shift as harshly as he anticipated. Instead, he breathes calmly and moves his face even closer to watch the way Teddy’s eye colour changes while he waves his arms excitedly. From a deep warm brown to something pale. Harry wonders whether Draco took the photo and if Teddy‘s eyes match Draco’s in the end.
Scrutinising this feeling, he recognises it as something very familiar to the way he felt when Ginny started to follow her dreams and left to play for the Harpies, and the day that Ron and Hermione decided to move in together, only two months after the final battle, because the Burrow was too empty and too full all the same over that too-hot summer. Harry doesn’t mention any of that to Draco, but he’s almost sure that he will at some point, and rather sooner than later.
With a huff, Draco asked Tom for a second double shot. What did it matter if he were drunk and a liar, destined to remain a boring bachelor for the rest of his days? Harry would never want him, not with the dreadful Mark that ruined his arm and his shoddy family name. The two of them moved in different circles, and Draco was wrong in every sense. Harry would never, not in a million lifetimes, look his way.
Oh Merlin, I wanted to reply. I wanted to tell Draco that he could tell me anything, and that I’d love him anyway but that was the exact moment that the sky exploded into a blazing spectacle of Wheezes fireworks. Lions and dragons chased and danced through the sky on a background of rainbows and rockets.
is a fucking masterpiece. They can think it as posh and gay as they wish.” Harry shrugs, pleasedly watching the smirk rise on Draco’s face. He looks beautiful with his eyes trimmed somewhere below Harry’s mouth, concentrated as though nothing in this world is more important than to get this right. It reminds Harry of the way Draco does most things
I felt like I had seen through him by then. He didn’t want a quick dirty fuck, and he didn’t want to own me. So instead of granting him his wish to lay eyes upon my prick, I nodded at him daringly. “Get out of that suit,” I said, and almost as an afterthought, I suggested, “And let me help you with that.”
He ought to be hungry. Harry remembers hunger. He remembers how it gnawed at his insides when he was small and locked inside his cupboard. How he’d dug desperately through the Dursley’s bin, looking for any crumbs that they’d left behind.
"I want," he takes a bracing breath. "I want that you can be
Draco couldn’t speak. He couldn’t move. He felt as trapped and impotent as he had when Fitzgerald had… when Fitzgerald and he had sex, bad sex, and nothing more.
Draco felt a little miffed by that answer. Was there an undercurrent of judgement from his old schoolmate? Draco wasn’t sure, but he let himself feel irritated by Harry anyway. “You’re twenty-two,” he answered, swiping the drink back from beneath Harry’s nose and purposely taking a big gulp of it. “You fought in a war. Saved the bloody world, far as I recall. You ought to enjoy yourself once in a while. Let that untidy mess of hair down for a bit.”
Macintosh read Draco’s statement back to him at the end of their interview, and the two agreed on the facts of Draco’s accusation: that, on the 23rd August 2002, Stuart Fitzgerald had raped him.
“Firewhisky?” Harry asked, nodding to the glass. “I wouldn’t have thought you’d be a whisky drinker. I’d have had you down for drinking Champagne or a glass of expensive plonk in some posh wine bar, not getting sloshed with the plebs.”
“Probably has nothing to do with why the charm isn’t working,” Harry observes.
It takes a very long minute before Draco speaks. “I’d be very happy if we were
Moving his head to follow Malfoy’s gaze, Harry saw white dots against a black veil. Suddenly the sight reminded Harry of the same sky, a different night, a reflection in unseeing eyes. “
He's just nipped for a shower, to freshen up after travelling all the way from Grimmauld to here.
Learning over, I gave your daddy a kiss. “You did the hard work,” I said. “Thank you, so much. For letting me love you, and for giving me another chance. It’s more than I deserve, and I’m going to work hard, every day of my life so you never have any regrets. Thank you for putting up with me and thank you for my family.”
“I believe you meant to offer your nephew a cup of tea,” Draco suggests, his voice a cloyingly polite threat.
They are quiet while horizontal. Draco guides Harry’s head to his own, and for a while, all they do is kiss to the tunes of 00’s pop-rock, beats thrice the tempo of their languorous kisses.
She SQUEALED. She squealed, momentarily raising the attention of the guards and the other visitors, muffling the sound by covering half her face in her hands, but without taking her eyes off me. She asked me – several times – whether I was fibbing.
if you care to know. And those taxes you so grudgingly pay? Hardly any of them go on the single mothers, the asylum seekers and the pride celebrations you worry about so often. And
Draco was seized by indecision. He wanted to trust Harry, but could he really? Potter was an Auror, and a dedicated one at that. If he told Harry his grubby, sordid little tale, then he would be under oath to listen to it. What if Harry didn’t believe him? What if he laughed, or worse, what if he didn’t? What if his face turned dark and taunting? What if he chastised Draco, and told him his words were lies? Pansy’s words danced through his head.
“We’ve heard quite some bollocks tonight;” Harry spits.
Due to the website’s policies, I can’t contact James directly without him leaving me a message. Not all hope is abandoned that he might still reach out for a date again. But I quite frankly doubt my luck at this point. I’ve been to the hotel twice in hopes of seeing him. I know how vanishingly small the chances are, but the chances of finding him amidst the hustle and bustle of London are even more abysmal.
could still swing it with a bit of luck,” Draco muttered pointedly, pouring himself another shot, “but,
, the man, Vernon Dursley, means Potter. Panic on the other side of the door, a conspiratorial glance to the left, to the right, across the street. “Come in, come in,” he says, suddenly hectic.
“A hug on a plate,” Harry would call them, as he served them up. “You need to look after yourself,” Harry would say. “You’ve got your baby to think about. You're eating for two."
. There’s this heartfelt rock-ballad that Harry fancies to recall as a song that used to play on the Muggle radio when he was a child. And as he watches Tarquin and John croon along with abandon, he could cry from the odd mix of emotions that stir inside his chest. For a second, Harry is astonished about feeling so overwhelmed, thinking that he hasn’t felt anything at all in quite some time without realising it—okay, he thought about it, but he didn’t
Everything felt very strange, like right now was already a memory, locked inside a Pensieve. Everything felt blurry, like Draco was outside his body; an observer, unable to change his fate.
“It is,” Draco replies. He draws a big phial from the inside pocket of his Muggle-esque travel robes; the Muggles become uneasy the moment his hand vanishes behind the fabric. He takes his wand too, holding it out before him into the open room of the small confines that once housed a little boy. A jolt goes through his wand, zooming up his arm with such a powerful force that, for the fraction of a second, it feels like his arm burns up from the inside. The pain is replaced with a pleasant thrum as soon as he starts murmuring an incantation to conceal the magic.
The blanket that Draco had wrapped around himself had fallen to the floor while he was asleep, so I bent down to retrieve it. I was just about to place it back over Draco when I paused, astounded by the sight before me. If I hadn’t seen it with my own two eyes, I doubt I would have believed it. My friend’s shirt had ridden up, and where I’d normally have expected to see a dip beneath Draco’s ribcage, instead there was a subtle rounding.
. Singular. The other one belonged to her niece; your other . . . to Dorea Potter. Who was your great-great-“
, and all Harry can feel is the addictive tingle in his balls that crawls up his prick as he thrust into Draco, again and again, eyes glued on his red prick vanishing into Draco’s body. He allows himself to thrust harder with Draco encouraging him by pushing back at each buck of his hips.
“He did what was best for him,” Tarquin says, repeatedly.
Sometimes people were vicious about Draco, but he didn’t give much of a shit. They called him a cockslut, or said that Draco was living proof that all Malfoys were good for was taking prick. Sometimes people said that Draco had saved his family by sucking the cock of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
“This one.” Potter’s voice is still quiet when he nods at a house, the same as all the others. Their eyes are directed right at the 4 next to the door. Draco Sees, very loudly, how a person scrubs at  a floor, disgusted by the footprint that’s smeared on the white tile. Yellow rubber gloves. Relief when the smears come off, the reward a cup of Lady Grey. And then another person. Indignant about the sound of a lawnmower, partly because it’s loud, partly because they’d have a properly neat lawn first. Then news in the television, more indignation about uncapable politicians allowing all kinds of riffraff in the country, wasting taxes on the lazy shirkers while they have to work until they are old and grey.
“Yeah, but I think you might have the better cards in this one.”
And in this case, it’s hard to tell. If looks are anything to go by, Draco does look a lot like he used to, back at  school. He’s still ridiculously young in appearance, eyes, skin, and hair pale against his black clothes; if Harry didn’t know that they are born the same year, he would guess that he has a couple years on Draco. His shoulders are broad and taper down to his narrow waist and hips, incredibly skinny in tight jeans. Does he look or dress or talk like he could be gay? Harry can’t tell. But in his experience, most disinterested would have firmly, politely lost the touch had he laid a hand on their shoulder.
“Are you sure you’re alright to be alone?” Harry asked. Draco could see that he didn’t want to leave. His movements were slow and hesitant, and there was indecision on his face. Even so, Harry still listened. He got to his feet. “You know where I am,” he said. “Anytime you want me, send a Patronus. Whatever time, day or night. It doesn’t matter.”
Part of me wishes that he’d just look me dead in the eye and tell me what a ridiculous, pathetic attempt my approaching him was and that I had better not try anything so loathsome again.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I shouldn’t have rushed off to work on that stupid food tray.”
Erroneously, I’d imagined that his reparation payments had ceased with the sale of the Manor. That every penny of the five grand I’d paid had gone into the Ministry coffers was a shock, and not a pleasant one.
Whatever happened between Draco and I, I decided that it was imperative that all debts were paid before the baby arrived. How I was going to achieve that, I had no idea then, and I’ve no idea now. Most importantly, I want Draco to know that Grimmauld is his home and his safety net.
Draco had half-smiled in lieu of an answer. He’d followed Pansy up to her private suite of rooms, and it’d been pleasant. Draco had been in desperate need of a good laugh. He allowed himself the luxury of pretending, for a short while, that nothing in his life had changed.
Draco stopped visiting the pub with his colleagues on a Friday. He stopped eating his lunches in the
, that it means- You never think about it much, do you?”
Kudos and comments are very appreciated!
I was busy telling my friend all about the different woods that we use and how the process of making a broomstick is close, in some ways, to making a wand. Draco humoured me, of course. I’m sure that he can’t be interested in my ramblings about the different charms we set and which materials make the speediest brooms.
away. A look of confusion washed over the Healer’s face, followed rapidly by a look of anger. “I was the wizard that Draco slept with,” I explained, feeling more sordid with every word. “I used an adulterated Polyjuice potion that I brought under the counter in Knockturn Alley and hair that I stole from a Muggle stranger.”
I’ll fucking raise Hades if he did it on purpose. Did he
It doesn’t take too long until he feels almost sober. Tarquin says that’s normal and together, they take another pill, denying John’s half-hearted attempt to persuade one of them into sharing. They think about finding another dealer, just in case they want another high that night.
“Shut up,” Harry stifles a smirk.
It was a mercy that Bill and Fleur had fitted Shell Cottage with the big two-person shower that they had, for I doubted that two strapping wizards and the plum would have fitted otherwise. Draco gave the heat of the water a moment to adjust before stepping inside. “Merlin, but the water feels fantastic on my hips and back. It’s been twinging all afternoon.”
It took them months of fucking for Draco to finally witness Harry coming, but Salazar was it worth it.
And it certainly didn’t escape Draco’s notice that the last time they were made to duel, he’d ended up on the floor, with Potter’s hard prick pressed against his thigh.
And Draco has his work cut out for him. He alternates between pulling on the necklace, gently — Merlin forbid he
I know better than to lie. I have made my bed by betraying everything I was taught, by doing magic, by deciding to stand by him instead of the people I grew up knowing, trusting, loving.
Theo says he’s on a collision course with life. Whatever the fuck that means. All Theo does is read — and snog Blaise (who doesn’t have an opinion besides agreeing with everything and anything that comes out of Theo’s mouth) — and learn. He learns about muggle drugs and recites facts to Draco and reminds Draco painfully of Hermione Granger. Draco’s head swims with too much information for one second before it completely erases Theo’s words and his many statistics about addiction and the death rate of drug users.
Now he climbs over Harry as soon as she’s gone and tastes her on Harry’s lips.
that looks so out of place, bright and stark against Potter’s skin and the dark shirt, that it’s… so
It doesn’t help that Draco keeps getting partnered up with Potter since Weasley walked out. He doesn’t want to complain — no one else in the Auror Training Program so much as tolerates him. Potter is his best option. And they’re well matched. They’re well matched working case files, they’re well matched interrogating, and Salazar, they are well matched dueling.
Draco doesn’t know what Potter’s game is at this point, not that he’s complaining. But if Potter wants Draco to break him, he will.
Vincent and Greg’s families have always been fishing people, too. Their fathers before them and their father’s fathers before them. Just like me. It’s just the way it is in Slytherin.
Draco isn’t sure why he is here or how Potter even knows where he lives, but
I do learn that we don’t even have to leave the house — tradition requires an open space big enough for a bonfire and where you can watch both sunset and sunrise from, the closest possible to the house where the children are to grow up. Luckily for us, that’s our garden at Grimmauld Place, which has apparently seen centuries of Black children’s Sain rituals.
Draco preps himself with the practicality of a desperate man. One finger, two fingers, three fingers,
“Come on, Malfoy, I know you’ll make it good for me. I’ll blow you again.”
Draco comes in his pants, suddenly and hard, heart beating in unison with the music, when Potter says “fuck, yes, fuck, I’ll be thinking of you, please, Malfoy.”
He laughs when I say I thought I’d need Occlumency for something other than keeping the Dark Lord from seeing memories of moonlight trysts and the delicious slide of Harry’s body against mine.
Draco watches me from above his cup of tea and takes one long sip. The baby in his arms wriggles a little and then settles again against Draco’s chest.
Harry grimaces.
Draco can’t help but think about that now — about Potter’s hard-on rubbing against him — as he watches him. Potter and his tight grey jeans and his black shirt with too many buttons undone for it to be considered
He finds a Boggart inside a drawer in Blaise’s bedroom. No one can get rid of it, and while the Zabinis aren’t exactly regarded as the scum of the earth — not like the Malfoys are, anyway — Blaise can’t get a Curse-Breaker in no matter how hard he tries. Draco looks his fear in the eye and realises just how deep it is as the Boggart struggles to keep to one form. Draco’s terror is so deep and so heavy that even the creature can’t pinpoint exactly what it is. Draco’s fear wears many faces:  his own parents, the Dark Lord, Greyback, aunt Bellatrix. Sometimes it takes the faces of the dead. Vince. Greg. Sometimes it takes the face of the victorious. Potter. Sometimes it takes the face of the innocent. That first-year he’d Crucioed under Amycus’ watchful eye. More often than not, when Draco looks at the Boggart, he stares at his own face and weeps. After, a tall man with dark hair and beautiful eyes pushes him against the bathroom door at someone’s house (he can’t remember whose or how he got there) and smiles the most dangerous looking smile as he holds up a little baggie full of white powder. Draco finds relief like this, for a few hours.
With a few quick moves of my hand, both Crabbe and Goyle are asleep. I search the very back of my brain for the right words, hoping I get them right. I whisper “Obliviate” twice and any memory of the oddly heavy net and of the merman currently staring at me is gone from both my friends’ minds. I turn to face the siren, then.
Draco doesn’t really acknowledge Harry’s tardiness until it crosses over the half-hour mark. He doesn’t actual notice it in the first ten minutes — probably a combination of a well brewed tea, his favourite biscuits and Luna’s incessant chattering. He does get a little fidgety after twenty minutes, but it’s Harry, so he lets it slide.
And Draco likes that. He’s nice enough when he’s like this, straddling Draco in his bed, holding something behind his back that Draco can’t see. When he tells Draco, “I like that you don’t let me come sometimes. I like that you have control over that. And I come so hard when I fuck myself at home and I think of you.”
“Fuck. Yes. All the time. Please, Malfoy,” he says, in gasps.
He only gets a high pitched “hnnngg” as a reply.
Despite it all, Draco burns. And it does the job, for the most part. There’s something about it. The music drowns out the cries of grief that play in his brain on a constant loop, the whiskey (he’s no longer fussy; at first he hated anything that wasn’t Firewhiskey, but now even bourbon will do) loosens his body, the drugs clear out his mind. It’s easy to lose himself for a few hours in the attention and the hot touch of random men.
), but Harry’s pants get quicker and quicker and his erection never flags.
He gets a rush when Harry looks at him, something wild and fiery at the pit of his heart. It’s almost as good as cocaine euphoria and he likes it. He allows himself to like it, he lets the burn slow down but not go out. He’s no longer a wildfire, he’s a hearth in midwinter, he’s a bonfire in the height of summer, he’s a bluebell flame floating inside a jar in the night.
He drops the
golden and it reflects off the well-meaning, if cliché, words on the tombstone.
Draco flips them over on the bed so he’s on top and kisses down Harry’s neck, his chest, his waist.
Then there was the incident at Hogwarts. He still felt the sharp talons on his skin way after the hippogriff had struck him. As he bled, holding onto the gashes on his arm he announced to the whole class, “I am dying, it’s killed me!”
“Marina and the Diamonds,” Draco answers in a levelled voice, looking somewhat nervous. “What kind of music do you usually listen to? I can change to something else if . . .”
was the blaring headline, and Draco read on, feeling his rare upbeat mood drop down into the pit of his belly.
“Yeah, mate,” Harry says, feigning defiance. “Even all the mainstream shit.”
“I won’t be able to keep your secret Mr Potter,” he said curtly. “Witches and wizards swear the Hippocratic Oath, exactly the same as Muggle doctors.
“We talked that day because of our trip, and we really—for the first time we
I trailed a dozen tiny kisses led downwards, and my lips trailed over taut, stretched skin. Each of my caresses were teasing, too much, but still too little, all at the same time. It made Draco fidget and plead for his satisfaction. It made him impatient for his pleasure.
Salazar, but I ought to be more self-confident. I know that it’s just a job. I have tons of good reasons to sell sex and my body. All those prejudices he holds, they are naught but that: inflammatory tales that the bloke probably even gets off on when his wife isn’t looking. And on top of it all, there’s nothing wrong with me enjoying it sometimes. I needn’t suffer or feel repulsed by my clients, quite the contrary. I’m allowed. It makes me better at my job.
“Do you feel that?” Draco asks with a small shudder. “Doesn’t it feel . . . Dark?” Harry doesn’t feel anything except for Draco’s fear. They stand on the threshold to the room, leaning to both sides of the door frame. Until Harry pushes himself off it and slowly walks into the room, feeling that the memories lingering there—Hermione’s screams, curses soaring through the room, Bellatrix’s maniacal shrieks—it’s all nothing but that. Memories.
All of a sudden, Draco felt strangely breathless. He liked to be able to move during sex. He loved fondling his partner, and making them feel good. He liked to stroke rib cages and squeeze bottoms. What Draco didn’t love was the feeling of being caught, but that was exactly what he was, as surely as a bug pinned to velvet.
Draco nods. “Anything that’s charmed or has otherwise magical properties. No wands though or things crafted from wand material. That’s very different from what I do. Whatever you try, they never work. They're almost unmendable.”
The only problem was that Draco’s boyfriend wasn’t real.
Draco nods along and laughs in disbelief. “Harry Potter, an actual petty crook. The-“ Draco makes himself stop speaking, eyes flickering over Harry. “And you’re an Auror as well.”
Draco did indeed, I stepped forward, and peered cautiously at where Draco’s was pointing, and there it was. A small shiny line, three or four centimetres in length, a stark pink against the pale skin of his bump. An unmistakable stretch mark, positioned just below his navel.
Draco smiles, but it doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “That’s hard to imagine. My parents weren’t exactly fond of you.”
I have postponed this for forever now. But the thing is, we had a second time and then something in between getting off into each other’s hands but not quite, and then a third go. The third time was exactly what I had set my mind on earlier.
“Your ex-wife? You said you’re a divorcee.”
“That was brilliant,” I said, smiling broadly. “Shall we get out and rest on the bed? Our hosts are going to be out for hours yet, and we’ve nowhere that we need to be. Might as well have a little lay down.”
Carol shrugs in response. “Could be fun.”
Time goes on, relentlessly, just as Harry’s heart keeps on beating.
I loved this conversation. It felt so easy to be honest with Harry out on that bench under the open skies. I think that it was a splendid idea to spend a few days outside of London. I feel like I’m having an easier time concentrating on what I want with Harry, not what I think I should or should not want. If I learnt anything today, it’s that we both should stop assuming that we know how the other one feels and what the other one wants. I think about some things so much that I feel like I’ve said them a thousand times already. And Harry can’t be much different.
But I ought to stop writing about Mother. Something exciting happened today.
, and he makes it sound as if Draco liking Muggle stuff has saved his life somehow. But he doesn’t know how to say any of that. His mind spins to coke or mephedrone and how they'd let him express whatever it is he’s feeling so much better. He notes Hermione’s eyes on his hands, and then his hands pinching his jeans and the skin and hair below. He makes himself stop.
“You like that,” Draco observed as he ran his fist up and down Harry’s prick, tight and fast, just like Harry would do it himself, but it felt so different, for it was Draco’s touch that made his balls tighten with lust.
“I don’t want to,” Draco breathed. “Please. I don’t
Andi wasn’t fibbing. Draco looked absolutely stunning. He was wearing tidy black trousers and a very fitted grey jumper, both of which emphasised his svelte, graceful figure. If anything, Draco looked ever better than on our date. His hair was ever so slightly longer than it’d been back then and had the slight wave it always gets whenever it reaches his ears. I longed to touch it, to card my fingers though its silky softness.
Draco came to me late at night on the fifth of January with the majority of his belongings shrunk down to fit in a large cardboard box. It’d been a few days since the two of us had been sitting in the Weasley-Granger’s garden, seeing in the start of 2006, and to tell the truth, I was still reeling from everything that he had told me.
The grand finale, ultimately, is his own birthday.
Oh, I know I’ve brought the fantasy, hook, line and sinker. Drake the sex worker was very, very good at his work, and I believed it. Diary, when I was there, eating dinner, and dancing, and fucking, a voice whispered in my head that this was a real date, and that when Drake asked me to accompany him to his room, it was because he really wanted it.
Harry thinks for a moment, starting to feel restless. He grabs the water and takes a sip before he answers, keeping the bottle in hand to fiddle with the cap and pick the corners of the label with his nails. “This and that. Some friends stayed, others went away. It’s really just- It feels different than it used to. Do you know that feeling that nothing really changed, except it absolutely did? Like- Suddenly you feel like a stranger around the same people, and then they start to notice you’re . . . distant? changed? . . . and then
Draco nodded, and the wizard waved his wand, frowning a little as he wordlessly cast the magic spell. Bright green sparkles filled the space, and I felt the flutter of it tickling my skin. “My heart is racing,” Draco admitted, seizing my hand. “It feels really odd. I can feel the pressure, and, oh… Harry! Look! That’s the plum! Oh Merlin, look how small they are!”
“Mother would love it here,” Draco said, taking a bite of his Crispy Seared Silken Tofu starter. He unfolded his cotton serviette and laid it on his lap.
Harry is starting to ponder whether to ask someone despite his trepidations or simply Disapparate when he finds it; an unobtrusive sign that reads
you make threats of legal action? You haven’t got even the slightest shred of proof that Draco would be an unfit parent! All you’ve got are a series of half-baked, inflammatory prejudices colouring your opinions.” I tugged Draco’s hand; I could see that he was very visibly upset by what the Mediwizard had said. His face was ashen and his whole body was trembling. “Come on,” I urged him. “You don’t have to listen to this. Nobody is taking your baby from you, Draco. I wouldn't let that happen."
“Only professionals,” Percy’s colleague answers the metaphorical question.
A familiar wave of nausea and revulsion coursed through his stomach, and he placed his own Cauldron Cake back on the plate. All of a sudden it tasted revolting. Draco thought he must have been pulling a curious face because Pansy furrowed her brow in his direction.
Harry takes a deep breath,  tasting the sweet acidity of the red on his tongue. He purses his lips, feeling annoyed at the topics, and what people have to say. The way they discuss. How outraged they sound at all the bollocks. And how utterly predictable and boring it is that the living room is divided like that. As if not one single witch was interested in politics, and as if not one bloke was affectionate with kids. And still, this was all so infuriatingly real.
Harry hates him more than ever in this moment. He tries to take a deep breath, every muscle strained, and close to snapping. “I was dead,” he finds himself saying. “You can’t know that, but I was dead. I died. Well, maybe you
So yes, I’ve brought sex. Fact is, I’m randy. It’s been months since I split from Adey and wanking in the shower, while delightful and all, isn’t quite the same as having a man in your bed, all muscle, sweat and
But I know how to cast that blasted charm! I watched Pansy and Daphne practise it a gazillion times back at Hogwarts, and I even watched when they taught Astoria. Circe, I had to cast it with them because they are an impossible bunch of witches, insisting that I’d never know when I’d finally decide to lay aside my pureblood conservatism!
per se. Anyway. Here is also Adelia’s niece, Dorea Potter. Born into the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.” More lines unfurl, and they connect all the way over to Sirius and to Narcissa, and also over to the Potter family. He tries to picture that this was one of his direct ancestor’s aunts—Adelia’s niece!—and his head starts spinning.
” and Harry swore that he’d never leave Draco again as long as Draco would be willing to keep him.
A man in a turtleneck and a blue suit jacket seems to be their host. He laughs amiably and is very charming with the ladies, kissing hands and handing out drinks. A few blokes are getting ridiculously high in the corner of the room, laughing and making all kinds of weird noises, bawling songs, completely off-tune and off-tempo. Harry would have a bloody brilliant time if he was on the same stuff, he reckons.
Draco hums softly in agreement. They just stand there, wrapped around each other and into the woollen blanket, Draco’s lips resting against Harry’s forehead. After a moment, Draco says, “Love didn’t save us in the end, did it?” He takes a sip of his whisky, redolent of oak and caramel, hiding a mirthless smile that Harry knows is there.
“I like the long hair on you,” Draco whispers. He cards a hand through it, denied halfway by the strands trapped in Harry’s bun. When he pulls off the hairband, the knot untangling into a mess of shoulder-length black strands, Draco starts massaging his head with both hands and,
Okay. I’m starting to calm down a little now. Writing in here helps, I think. Draco is still upstairs, locked in his bedroom. I’ll go up and check on him in a couple of minutes or so.
Sometimes in his sleep, Harry dreams of being dead. Not dying but being dead. Greeting his final breath in a familiar embrace, persuading himself that he remembers what it truly felt like in the forest, at the mirage of King's Cross . . .
I’m sure my aunt would cut ties with me, and Lady Zabini might throw me out. I actually wonder if Harry would stay friendly with me. He seems a bit twee sometimes. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had thought my occupation more of a dating service than actual fucking. But he’s so friendly, so good at heart. What’s it to me if he’s a tad naïve? I bet he wouldn’t judge me.
Draco cast a cleaning and drying spell over me, and I felt my skin goosepimple as I felt his magic wash all over me. Bloody hell, but it felt so good, all warm, tingly and intimate. Magic dried the starchy cloth of my jeans, and the fabric of my boxer shorts beneath them.
Draco nods and stands, stretching and rolling his shoulders, still slightly swaying to the beat of the Gorillaz song playing on the wireless. “How about we go to the local pub?”
A day before his hearing, Tarquin tells Harry, “I don’t deserve you,” and when Harry wants to say that he’d always be there for him, Tarquin interrupts him with a mirthless laugh, saying, “The worst part of it all is that you had to meet my parents. Hope it was only my daddy?” He sounds sad and caustic, and Harry can hardly bear how pale Tarquin looks. For the first time Harry explicitly  thinks that, maybe, he might be in love with him.
The idea is completely hilarious, at least in retrospect because it did feel like mobbing rather than pranks. On the other hand, Harry gets why other students or especially Draco might have hated him, with his constant meddling and Dumbledore’s favouritism. Indeed, several professor’s favouritism if he is truthful.
Night air.
Harry shivers.
“Student?”
“Let it play, then,” Harry prompts.
“Tosser,” the man, Trinh, laughs along, and then he thanks Harry again in a quiet voice that’s only for him.
Hermione whispers something into Ron’s ear, and he looks over to Harry then, giving him a smile as well. Harry thinks that he looks so happy. His eyes gleam and his cheeks are a scarlet colour. When he looks away, he loops his arm around Hermione. Rose is playing with something on the ground. Fleur and Percy’s wife sit with her, limbs and toys sprawled across the busy pattern of the brown carpet. Molly watches them from her wingback chair, a somewhat wistful smile on her face.
Draco’s palm is warm and steady on his back, unmoving, much like he doesn’t say anything for a while. When Harry finally musters up the courage to look up, their eyes lock onto each other’s. Draco gives him a reassuring smile, an almost unnoticeable upside-twist of his mouth corners.
“Thanks, matey,” the guy says, still breathless and red-faced. “I owe you my life.”
Draco gives a laugh, his eyes kind. “I don’t think the war has been fair on you either.”
It’s a matter of minutes before they sit on a step together, their backs against either side of the wall with cum-stained trousers crumpled in their knees, both of them gulping for breath and smiling, satisfied.
“But we just took- Okay, it doesn’t matter, just . . .” Okay, Harry can do this. There’s no reason he should allow Draco Malfoy to get a rise out of him. That would only ruin his high. Jesus, but he would talk—he always gets effervescent on mephedrone, and it doesn’t sound like a good idea to be talking about interests and emotions with Malfoy. Which might mean that Malfoy thinks it’s a splendid idea, seeing that he offered, sniffing his fare before Harry even had time to process what’s happening.
But Merlin, there was so much to learn last week. He told me about contractions and how I’ll be able to recognise them. “If you have any contractions, we’ll have to get baby Malfoy-Potter. There’s no way around it, the baby has nowhere to go. And he explained about the operation and informed us about a few risks of the Anaesthesia Charm.
Sometimes I’ve fucked into Draco’s new, plushy arse cheeks, my hands gripping his belly as I buried myself, deep as I could.
He seemed genuinely interested and ever so open-minded. So I tried to answer these questions, telling him about this one time that someone refused to pay me and I sort of had to run out of the hotel. But I also said that this was once in possibly a thousand clients that I've had over the past few years and how, normally, everything goes well, and most blokes just want sex or a BJ, and some even want a sneaky cuddle afterwards.
“That’s good news,” Draco said dryly, a smile ghosting over his thin lips. “Love myself a faithful boyfriend.”
He lights his next cigarette, not with his lighter this time, and pulls his coat tight, his chest deflating with silvery puffs of air and burnt ashes, gusting past him as he walks. Lacking ideas, his feet carry him towards the next Tube station, his gaze searching for the right kind of distraction along the way. There are pubs with fogged up windows, heavy doors shutting in bass and sweat. A few blokes stand outside on the pavement with their hands buried deep inside their coats, passing a bottle of liquor between them without talking.
. Or you,” I add after a smile, thinking that it’s the same anyway. The smile is returned, faint but there, and Harry toasts me with his glass as he sips his whisky and I chug down the potion.
A woman laughs with all her heart at a joke she is told, her hand finding a man’s arm. The woman next to her watches, unseeing, with glassen eyes and empty glass in hand. A man lights a smoke, closing his lids fluttering shut with pleasure for the briefest of seconds with the first inhale and the coil of smoke through the stagnant air. His friend stumbles back, bumping into another group, but the general exchange of
“Wrackspurts in my belly,” he said, tapping his feet on the floor and steadfastly not meeting anyone’s gaze. He kept my hand on his own, resting on his thigh. His bump was really showing now, his black shirt clinging to the soft swell of his tummy. “But I’m glad I’m here. Thank you for nagging at me to come, Harry. Thank you for looking out for me.”
“Exactly.” Teddy nods vehemently. “I’ve heard that they are always in search of Aurors with good glamour skills for undercover investigations. I wouldn’t need a glamour so there’ll be no spell that would wear off after a while or would be discovered by a Legilimens.”
I think, perhaps, that I should have been more honest. I should have been more open and been straight forward from the very beginning. Should I have confronted Draco once I’d seen his online profile? The Harry Potter that I’d
When I arrived, I was giddy with tension. I’d spent half the day convincing myself not to go through with our date, and the other half daydreaming of the nude pictures that Draco had posted on the website. Indeed, I nearly turned around and walked away when I locked eyes with Draco in the hotel lobby. My confession was close to my lips. I only swallowed it when Draco gave me a smile, one that was real and reassuring. It was the same smile he gives Teddy when he stumbles over a word in his reading book or falls from the Muggle bicycle that I brought him for his birthday. ‘It’s okay,’ Draco’s face spoke loudly. ‘Trust me.’
He hadn’t had any substances—apart from two glasses of wine last night with Draco—for the last six days. And, six days ago, everything in his system was magically drawn out of his body in a frantic attempt to apologise to Draco for everything he had said about mending and the Vanishing Cabinet, about yelling at him and just generally being such a pathetic coward who leaves every time he’s sobering up.
. And in this moment that Harry looks at himself in the mirror, the light yellow and homely, Harry realises that they don’t care about his real self. His ideas and thoughts and insecurities. What they see in him, he isn’t sure, but it is all about them and not about him. For a cruel, horrible moment, he thinks that even to them, he’s the bloke who peaked at life when he was seventeen and more or less fulfilled his prophecy. All he wishes is for Molly and Arthur to have a talk,
I ran my hand through Harry’s hair, and the touch lifted his trance. He raised his head into the touch, closed his eyes, and looked very much like he was enjoying it. When he brought his head back down after a moment and pressed a kiss on the swell of my bump, I could only do as much as give an incredulous laugh.
When Harry mentioned that to Ron and Hermione, Ron shook his head and slapped his shoulder approvingly while Hermione looked a bit worried; the same look she wore when Harry asked what she knew about Bonding Charms. But that’s okay. His two friends mean well, and Harry is perfectly aware that not everyone understands the way Draco and he work, how they get each other through life. “
“So were you, and you did the right thing. We were in a war, I give you that much. But it would’ve been easy for you to hate me. Grow to like me, love me even? You must’ve forgiven me at some point. It took a while, I suppose. It will take time. I like where things are going at the moment.”
Merlin, but Draco has the most gorgeous prick. It’s long, and skinny, and the glans is the most delicate pink. It’s an odd thing for a bloke to say, but it was elegant. I couldn’t help but lick and kiss it through the gauzy material of Draco’s underwear. I’m not in a minute of doubt that this was odd behaviour from a client but in the heat of the moment, I couldn’t bring myself to care. All I wanted was to give Draco pleasure.
“It really wasn’t that bad,” Harry reassures him, not sure whether it’s true. But it doesn’t matter when Draco nods—maybe agreeing to the broom ride, maybe letting go of the rotten words they had for each other a few hours ago,—his eyes endlessly fond in the dim light, and Harry falls in love anew. The feeling perfuses his whole body, rendering his features earnest and his heartbeat skittish and fluttery like a young bird’s first flight as they kiss under starless skies like it was the first and the last time.
Harry hadn’t moved from his seat in the waiting room, and when Draco left Macintosh, he stood up to meet him. “How was it?” Harry asked, a look of concern across his face. “You've done the hard part now, and you've been so brave. Let's get out of here. Let’s get you home.”
“Mm?”
“I had no idea that charms get into such . . . complexity,” Harry says, leant forward on the table, the delicate stem of the gin glass pinched between his thumb and index finger. Encouraged by the way Draco’s eyes gleam with earnest exhilaration, Harry dares to ask the question now, the one he didn’t know he’d like to have answers to. “You said it belonged to my grandmother?”
"It'd be so much easier. Imagine the lyrics would just float somewhere instead of flickering over this little screen." Harry rests his head on the backrest.
“Grimmauld is the same,” Harry mumbles.
Now, Draco laughs a little, his cheeks pink from the cold December day that creeps into the confines of the Manor. “Shut up, Potter.”
Gods, I can’t be pregnant. How do I even check? Does St Mungo’s take in pregnant wizards? It’s so darn rare. Fuck, I’ve never even seen a pregnant wizard.
Despite my words, Potter looked at me with sad, worried eyes, so open and vulnerable that I wanted to scream at him that he ought to despise me. But when he spoke, his voice was a whisper. “None of that is true, Draco. Not one part, except that I am glad that you and Teds are related. Because otherwise, I might have missed out on the chance of getting to know the real Draco Malfoy.”
I must say that I saw a new side of Harry today. The sex was great, it really was. He’s a thoughtful and gentle lover. However, I have the feeling that he’s unsure of something. Perhaps he’s a bit shy. Perhaps he doesn’t know what he likes. Or perhaps he wasn’t sure if shagging me was the right thing to do. It’s hard to picture. I was glad that he stayed afterwards and didn’t flee the bed at the first available opportunity.
The last glass or porcelain rings into silence while Harry catches his breath, panting as though he’s just ran a mile. Draco’s eyes glisten with hurt and worry and disappointment. Something cruel wants to take a hold of Harry upon the sight, upon thinking that, finally, all his dreams are confirmed, finally he drove the one bloke away that he had fun spending time with. Again.
“Fits you well,” Draco observes, smoothing the robes down on Harry’s chest and his shoulders.
Everything was hunky-dory until it wasn’t.
—sitting across from him in a broad armchair, his legs and fingers crossed, an emotionless expression in his pointy, pale face.
Draco smells of woodsy cologne and his lips feel like velvet. His lips look thin and his whole posture rigid, but as soon as Harry takes off his spectacles, and they shift closer to each other, his body against Harry’s own
Well, and that’s how we got on the dancefloor together. I was glad that I could finally get my hands on the man. I feel far more competent with my body language when it comes to romantic interactions than I do with words and small talk. I held him, getting into his personal space immediately, but not too close. James didn’t seem to be the sort of guy to get too handsy in public, and we were still in a restaurant, not in a gay club.
As always, my eyes closed in on Draco’s hair. Most of it had been obscured under a hat, but the bottom of it peaked out from beneath the rim. His white-blond hair still shone as bright as the morning sun, but the rest of my friend looked very different to how he usually does.
Everything looks neat and tidy. There’s a shelf full of intellectual looking books, some of the spines are fading, the threads of their time-honoured binding loose, others are bright with the Penguin Classics emblem on them. A potted plant lives on the top shelf, its stem bowing in a graceful curve towards the window. It must be magic; in Harry’s peripheral, he sees how the tip of the tendril curls in on itself, looking very much like it might go to nap for a bit.  On the coffee table in front of the seating area, there are a few low-burnt candles and an issue of
stayed.” A lump lodges in Harry’s throat, but he nods. He’ll ask Draco to watch all these memories in a Pensieve, the good and the bad ones; he knows he won’t be able to stop himself from that.
Shoving his spectacles on top of his head, Harry rubs his eyes, sniffing with every forceful inhale. “I don’t know why I’m so-“ He gives a laugh that sounds pathetic in his ears. “I don’t even
errands concerning the estate, and then I opened the doors to customers.”
“But they called you Potter,” another one says.
He tried to keep it together, he really did. But when he didn’t have to put on a face and be
And this was all good and well. A bit sad that I hadn’t found him yet, but I would’ve dealt with all that. That is, until I learnt that I needed the other father to be strong enough to sustain our baby.
His mind wanders to the coke, to the morphine, both vials just a wave of his wand away.
“Ever tell you how sexy you are?” I murmured, my voice rough with arousal. I didn’t think that Draco knew how wonderful he looked, shining with health and radiance. Even if I lived another hundred years, I doubted I’d ever see a vision so perfect again.
“Are you interested in buying one of the antiques?” Malfoy asks. “If not I must insist you owl me for an appointment. And if you don’t want that either, I want to exercise my right as the landlord of this property and ask you to leave. Seeing that neither of us has a witness, I declare my consent to my memory being used as evidence.”
Draco’s breathing changes, and Harry wants to prolong this pause they have, so Draco would have a moment to adjust to the feeling. But the wizard gets down on his arms and knees again, moving his arse back against Harry, spurring him on to keep going. Harry rocks his hips in short movements, feeling himself get deeper and deeper behind the tight ring of muscles with each careful thrust. They angle their hips, their legs until it’s
