“Because I’m not your servant!”
Lifting his goggles up, Draco looked down at the finished esters. “Alright, now you just write the papers. Write them well, Potter. Some of us have dreams beyond this sad institution.”
Draco laughed and looked over to them and their horrified parents. “Think they’re Prophet photographers in disguise?” he asked Harry in a hushed, conspiratory tone.
“Amen,” Seamus agreed solemnly.
Ah, of course. The classic ‘you know’ when they meant ‘queer as a three-dollar bill’. Draco would never understand why straight people could dole out anti-gay slurs left and right and then when it came to talking to a person who actually identified as gay they couldn’t even say the word.
The Velvet Lounge, Ron had said. That was as good a place as any to start. With newfound determination Harry picked up his quill and began his reply.
Draco pressed his fingertip to the spot that made Harry’s eyebrows furrow. “Sensitive here, are we?” Draco mercilessly rubbed up against his prostate.
Shocked by the entrance, Harry’s head snapped to attention. He’d been busy fretting on the edge of the bed before Draco burst in, and had been planning to fret and anguish for several more hours before seeing Draco again. “What—?”
“So,” he said, leading her out of the house and locking the door behind himself. Lucius’ spells had kept the press off of their front lawn much more effectively than Draco cared to admit, but it was refreshing to step outside without hundreds of cameras flashing and rude questions being thrown at him. “Enjoying the neighborhood?”
He could profess his love to Harry in private, even in front of neutral parties like Lovegood and her audience, but saying it in front of the Weasley clan? The loving family that had lost a son to Death Eaters? It made Draco sweaty, and he hated being sweaty.
Harry made a guttural noise as the back of his throat connected with Draco, gagging and pulling back slightly only to have Draco pull him forward again onto it with his other hand.
Oh, brilliant. Though welcomed by Molly, Draco was quite positive he was walking into a trap. An orange, tackily-dressed trap.
“I—I sent you pictures of myself!” she ranted on, her eyes wide with anger. Ruth looked likely to pounce on him at any moment and rip that tacky fedora to shreds, but Harry remembered how Kingsley had mentioned physical fights were inadvisable.
Gathering his sleeping robe around himself over the shirt and long pants Draco made his way down the grand staircase like a lady holding her skirts. Draco had always loved that about wizards getting to wear robes, even though he did find the time to appreciate a good muggle suit, like he had last night. Potter cleaned up damn well—oh, wait, yes, they were using first names now.
Draco knew that on the other side of the camera they spoke into that Pansy and Theo were sharing mimosas and truffles in her living room with hearts full of envy and pride. Harry knew that on the other side of the camera Ron and Hermione were eating pretzels and sipping butterbeer, too.
Quietly, Harry cursed himself for even trying.
Woo! I made this like a couple weeks after the war ended so it's where the deaths haven't all sunken in yet and people are just super stoked to have survived two wizarding wars.
“I dunno. I was thinking we could have our first dinner here alone,” Harry shrugged. “Y’know, light some candles and make it fancy for you.”
After handing over Draco’s sugary delight Harry crawled back into bed with him. “Any time, love.” He sipped from his mug and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Do you know when you’ll be home tonight?”
Still, the use of his family’s money made Harry twinge with guilt inside for what he might use it for. Even if James and Lily approved of him being gay—a big ‘if’, for things were different when it was one’s own child—they would likely never approve of what Harry wanted out of being gay.
“Sounds great.”
“Getting warmer…” Draco grinned, still resting against the brick wall.
“Oh, please!” Draco scoffed, crossing his arms. “You think I don’t notice the way you look at me? You think you’re so damn holy, but you judge and you observe and you love what you fucking see.”
Harry and Draco, interrupted from their melee, snapped to look at the screen.
Not in gay way! No, his dads were the gay ones. He liked women. All sorts of women. Lots of women who flirted with him across the tables in the Great Hall. Aiden wasn’t gay. He so totally wasn’t gay because he was straight because his parents were gay. Right?
“She’s here!” Draco said with the most pep he could muster after having baked under the stage lights just a little too long.
Ten minutes had never passed slower in Draco’s life. It was more like nine and a half by the time he began his ascent up to the third floor.
Harry curled his fingers back into Draco’s hair. “Maybe you don’t need to ‘get over it’. Maybe you have to let yourself have an emotion for a few days.”
“—and your father—“
That little blow was only to throw him off, though. When Harry least expected, Draco cracked the flogger down like a whip against his erection. “Sir!”
“Tell me all about it,” Harry encouraged, sliding off each trouser leg and leaving Draco in nothing but his underwear.
Colin gripped to his boyfriend and the lie as tightly as he could. He would point Harry and Ron in the right direction for the case afterwards. In that moment, he was content with showering Theo in tulip petals and laughing when he swatted them away.
“Yes, I know, my love,” she laughed, pressing a soothing palm to her husband’s shoulder to placate him. “In the end you were mine, and proposed to me at a joint-family dinner. My parents were thrilled, and so was I.” Narcissa took her hand back and admired her wedding ring, a massive diamond-encrusted thing.
“Pansy!” Now it was Draco’s turn to be red. Between the three of them Ginny was looking absolutely delighted at this madness unfolding around her. “Excuse her, she’s terminally unable to mind her own business,” Draco said to Harry.
“Hospital,” Lucius nodded, nudging his son.
Harry followed Draco into the walk-in closet and tried desperately to ignore the implications of doing that. What was going on? Who had told? “Who could have possibly—?”
“Yes, yes.”
*** *** ***
“Need me to what?” Draco prompted, spreading all three fingers wide.
The idea that this abstract, beautiful man could want him was overwhelming. It made Harry feel naïve and inexperienced, too. Like somehow there could be something he was missing in his equation of this Magical and Perfect Man, but Harry wasn’t sure what it was.
It’s time to turn the pressure up on these two. I’m so bad at updating slowbuild fics—which you all know—but it’s really just so hard to imagine any world where Draco and Harry aren’t already together. Also, this may sound strange, but I have something in the works that I think all of my readers will really enjoy. It’s not fanfic—it’s an RPG centered around Drarry. I’ve started development for it now and I’ll update you with my progress until it’s playable. TW for mentions of Harry’s physically abusive childhood with the Dursleys.
“Daddy!” she yelped with a gigantic smile on her face as her light-haired father picked her up off the ground and kissed her pudgy cheek. In seconds, her papa was in on the love fest, too.
“Hey! At least I didn’t get you sick!”
The fear of what was to come could be excruciating in tense moments, but for the most part Harry was able to talk himself off the ledge. He was dressed, his breath smelled good, he was freshly shaved and showered, and he was going to meet a bloke at a bar. Even if nothing happened from here, or something disastrous happened from here, he’d still tried.
Hell, life with Harry was comfortable. It was soft, and sweet, and would Draco really mind if it lasted forever? Forever was kind of scary when said outside of the heat of passion—forever meant ever on, meant the ‘M’ word and it wasn’t ‘Malfoy’. Would it be Malfoy-Potter? Draco actually really, really liked the sound of that. “Thank you, Harry.”
“Sounds perfect.”
“I’m helping you with the house,” Harry offered.
“Never. If anything, the kid gets a dragon,” Draco huffed. They were really the only animal he could stand, and you could ride them, too. Nothing like that giant chicken that had assaulted him in third year and Draco was even named after a dragon.
Pressing his head harder into the wall Draco undid Harry’s tie, slipping the silken fabric off and grabbing one of his wrists. “These are my hands. I say what you do with them.”
“Double-shot espresso, three sugars—“
“Remus,” Narcissa sighed. “That’s not necessary.”
Harry missed that train. He’d almost died on it more than a few times but it would always hold the engine sounds and smoke stack close to his heart. The first time it took him away from the Dursleys had been so good it made up for all the bad memories he had on it. That first taste of freedom was too precious to forget or let be tainted by other incidents.
“Yeah,” Olivia shouted back before turning to Alex conspiratorially. “So you’ll convince them to let you come to the party, right?” She really wanted to see him again.
“Goodnight, Daddy,” Harry wished him, turning him on his side and coming up behind him so he could be his big spoon for the night. “Sweet dreams.”
The second floor was too dark to see much with no light through the windows and no lamps or candles in sight. Harry figured that Draco liked it better that way, not having to see all that empty space it was his duty to fill. Harry had always been jealous of Draco’s life—his wealth, his parents who loved him—but it seemed being a Malfoy was a heavy burden to shoulder.
Draco tried to recall where he’d seen the woman last. “Being famous and signing brooms, probably.” Her Quidditch career had really taken flight (pun intended) when she signed with the English National team.
They kissed, and at last their twin hearts knew peace.
“What?” Harry asked again because he was still processing this in waves. Where was Draco going?
“Of course,” Draco agreed. “And because I like you in tight little numbers that show off your arse.” He cupped Harry’s cheek and rubbed the soft, soft skin there near-obsessively in his inebriated state.
“I’ll see you at breakfast, then,” Harry nodded, eyes flickering like he held something secret. “Goodnight, Professor Malfoy.”
“Apologize, Malfoy.”
?” He hadn’t known his mum was sick.
Ruth smiled, thank fuck. “Let’s go.”
Occupied with chewing on some cannoli’s that had been placed down when he wasn’t even looking, Harry used a full mouth as his excuse to keep quiet long enough to think. It was so hard to think Draco looking at him like that—like he really and actually cared. His velvety voice, the smell of baked goods, every sense of Harry’s overwhelmed with the most saccharine of stimuli.
“Sure?” said Harry.
“I’m from MTV’s upcoming show, Catfish, but that’s not really important. What is important is that I’ve been talking to a bright young lady named Kennedy, and she would really like to meet with you. I know it hasn’t been possible in the past—“
“Er, nice to meet you,” Harry tried. “I’m—“ He stopped himself. No real names, but these were Susan and Justin from what he could recall of Pansy saying before. Wait, as in Susan Bones and Justin Goldstein? That strawberry blonde hair of Susan’s gave her away even years later. “I’m having the single strangest night of my life and I’ve been back from the dead twice,” said the savior of wizardingkind.
Harry cried out against each blow without fail, creating a rhythm that was music to Draco’s ears. “That’s what you get,” he panted from the strain of bringing his arm up and down so hard.
Not even Ruth’s giggle could unfix Harry’s eyes from Draco.
“I am.” Harry turned in to trail kisses up his neck and rested on the soft blonde hairs near his temple. Slowly, his hand curled around Draco’s thigh, rubbing the silky fabric of his pyjamas.
“That’s my boy, so sweet, so submissive for me,” Draco breathed, fucking him with reckless abandon. The water in the tub sloshed and threatened to spill over the sides. “Takes anything I give him.”
“Yes. Ten two year-olds, ten three year-olds, and ten four year-olds. It’s a class of thirty altogether before they get glowing recommendations for private kindergartens.”
Harry’s belt buckle hit the floor with a satisfying ‘clack’, and from there Draco was free to unzip his pants and wrestle them off.
“There,” Harry said, moving to open it.
“Shut up. You don’t know anything about me,” Draco growled. “Your Weasel and Granger aren’t wide-eyed innocents in this and neither are you. You think that your freaky threesome is above your own moral standards.”
Their apprehensions, hopes, and dreams went on to their next generation. Now it was Draco and Harry who wanted to do right by their kids. Grace wanted to do right, too. That was why she would give the baby to the two most likely to raise it right.
Harry’s smile and blush broke out at once. “Well, we’ve already got the bedrooms down, the kitchen, your bathroom, the ballroom…”
“It just tastes better, okay?”
“That’s right,” Draco growled. His hips had sped up, losing all sense of rhythm to blindly push forward into the lubricated heat around him. He knew he was leaking inside of Harry and didn’t have much time left himself. “Come on, one more time: Who’s your Daddy?”
“That,” Draco repeated, feeling like he was going to heave. The door slammed shut behind him. “
Draco nodded. He usually loved it when Harry was right, mostly because it involved a gratifying ending, but this time was bitter in his mouth.
“Load up the bag, Kenny,” she said to the next child, tossing them a sack. She had red-framed sunglasses on but Harry could catch glimpses of her eyes shimmering beneath them. Uh-oh, indeed.
“You aren’t,” Narcissa nodded sagely.
Draco wasn’t even at the hospital by the time Harry’s letter arrived.
“Prat,” Harry scoffed before continuing. “I can’t believe that all the stories about your worrying parents were about, well,
Draco was about to let his own eyes shut when a disturbed grunt came from behind them.
Harry cocked an eyebrow.
“Thank you,” Harry replied with a smile and sat down next to Draco on the bed. The bed they’re jerked each other off on. Harry tried not to think about that, and put Draco’s laptop at a comfortable typing distance to check the Catfish emails.
“Is that the one with the silly color-coded outfits?” Draco asked idly as he tried to envision where he would put the couches he had planned for this room.
“Thirteen, fourteen,” Harry choked out, two new handprints on his inner thighs. Draco, sadist he was, was making sure to get every single patch of skin under his blows. “Fuck! Fifteen,” Harry whined when he spanked his already-red cheeks.
“There you are, that’s it… You’re almost ready for me.”
Draco smiled. “You are simply the sweetest man I know, do you know that, Harry Potter?” He leaned against the bathroom counter to stare at Harry a moment longer before turning to brush his teeth.
Harry nodded in agreement. “You are a terrible date, but I’m just glad this one didn’t end in me having to wear ear-plugs tonight.” It was a mutual agreement that being sexiled was bad roommate manners, so they both had charmed headphones that silenced the world around them.
That changed in an instant, though, when the crop collided with his arsecheek.
Next came Draco’s belt, undone in a flash with the level of skill Harry had come to in disrobing Draco after all this practice. Two months and fourteen days together—and each second of them had been complete bliss aside from their outing.
Draco had half a mind to admit he was training Harry to be the perfect submissive, how to walk in heels and talk like a proper posh darling. Wouldn’t that grey Lucius’ hair even faster. “We were getting reacquainted,” Draco tried, but it came out as unfortunately sexual as the truth was. “I was showing him all the work that needed to be done on the Manor,” he tried again.
“Well, Harry, I believe that is entirely up to you. Now that I am sure you’re sober as the day you were born I am open to hearing all about your ideas, too.”
“And what did the Seer say?” She finally asked
“Tippy!” He shouted. A loud crack filled the room as a house elf appeared spontaneously. She had large grey blue eyes and long pointed nose with large floppy wrinkly ears. She was dressed in a pink pillow case that had oil and other miscellaneous stains on it. “Yes, Sir?” She quivered out.
Draco nodded before asking “He?”
“ Yes, Father” Draco replied.
“About that are you still friends with the Headmistress of the Wizarding Charm School in England?” He asked. “Yes, we still speak.” Narcissa responded “Good get in touch with her and let her know that we found Draco a Fiancée and want him to be educated to become the perfect wife. This will also give us total control over his education learn anything dangerous.”
“ Have she responded yet?” He asked.
Lucius watched as the boy slept peacefully. It had been about fifty-three hours since Hadrian had originally lost consciousness. He could already detect the physical difference in the boy’s appearance. His skin had gotten a lot paler and softer. The scars from his previous abuse had also disappeared and since his memory was gone his mental ones would be as well. Soon he would be waking up and he and Narcissa would have a lot of explaining to do. Of course they had to explain things to Draco first. Lucius wasn’t exactly sure how his son would respond to having a Fiancée, especially at such an early age. After all Draco was only 11 but this also wasn’t odd for Purebloods to be Betrothed at such an age. The odd part was going to be explaining Hadrian his situation and the position he would have in Draco’s life. Hadrian wasn’t meant to be a traditional Malfoy wife, with an impressive education and High Society Pureblood background. No he wasn’t meant to navigate political or business situations. If Lucius could have it his way Hadrian will never have to think critical or deeply over anything. Hadrian while Draco’s spouse will be nothing more than a glorified pet. He will of course have the standing of a Malfoy in name but no more than that. He also had to make sure that Draco understood this as well. Hadrian existed for Draco. He would molded completely to his wishes. Actually, he should probably go explain things to Draco now before Hadrian woke up.
“Yes Harry you will be coming with me. So why don’t you go and grab your things and we can head out?” He confirmed. Harry just shook his head. “I don’t have any things, Sir.” He confessed. “Well we’ll leave now then and get anything you need once you get settled. Does that sound ok?” Mr. Malfoy while holding out his hand for Harry to take. Harry paused for just a fraction of a second before nodding and grabbing his hand. After all he wasn’t going to miss an opprotunity to get out here even if it was being offered by a stranger. As soon as he stepped out the door there was a jerking sensation and pop. Just as quickly he felt his feet slam into the ground and would have fallen if he hadn’t been holding Mr. Malfoy’s hand.
The room he had landed in was very opulent everything was colored in shades of grey and white. The bed in the middle was holding grey silk comforter and off white silk sheets with a whole mountian of pillows. The floor was light grey plushy carpet that matched the cream colored walls perfectly. There were also three other people in the room a woman and two men. The woman began moving towards them first with a worried expression on her face. She had black and white hair and brown eyes. She wore an all black dress that was floor length and swayed as she walked.
“ Yes. She is asked to set an enrollment appointment so she can talk to us about what she expects. Also she told me to inform you that Draco needs to have an idea of he wants Hadrian to become so she begin working on him.” She explained.
“Yes your fiancee is a male.” Lucius informed. “ His full name is Hadrian Malfoy and because of extenuating circumstances he is now your fiancee. Don’t worry about the why. As if this moment they do not concern you. Understand?”
“How about Hadrian?” He asked. “That works. Hadrian Malfoy.” She stated finally.
“Good.” Narcissus replied.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucius walked towards the informal sitting room. He hoped Narcissa would be there as he had much to discuss with her about the future of the Malfoys. Stopping at the door he took a moment to knock and then proceeded through before receiving a response.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
“Yes. The world is your oyster so to speak.” Lucius responded. Draco nodded and took a quill and blank sheet of paper and began writing. Lucius took this as him beginning to figure out he wanted Hadrian to be raised for him. He got up and left the room to go find his wife and see if she had heard back from the Headmistress.
“Tonight. I’ll go grab Harry once I’ve informed Severus of the situation and contacted the Goblins about the Blood Adoption. Then once  we have everything with Harry settled I will inform Draco of his betrothal and the responsibilities that come with it.”
“Alright I’ll go contact Severus now.” He said as he got up to leave. He was excited he had a solid plan and he couldn’t wait to watch it work.
Lucius nodded in agreement. “ I will go back to watching Hadrian then. After all he should be waking up soon.” He stated while getting up and heading towards the door to leave.
It took him four hours but he was finally done. Harry went room that was in the closet under the stairs and decided to rest the last half n hour he had before having to make dinner. Heading out of his room to the kitchen to begin preping dinner, Harry heard a knock at the door. Pressing himself closer to the wall to avoid being run over by his Uncle he tried to listen to what was happening at the door while preparing dinner. He gave up when he realized that he wouldn’t be able to hear anything over the clanking of pans and decided focus on getting it done quickly so he could rest again.
Narcissa beamed at him, as if he had just bestowed upon her a gift, and she lifted his hand to her face and kissed it once more. “Well then, Harry, I insist you call me Narcissa.”
“Draco,” Snape drawled, “were you aware that you owed a life debt to Mr. Potter?”
Harry just rolled his eyes. “I’ll take that as a yes. Luna, since, er, me and Malfoy have to stay together, would you go send the owls while we head to the library?”
“Harry, look out!” Hermione screamed, and Harry turned just in time to see a tower of books, quickly becoming engulfed in flames, collapsing toward him.
Hermione had decided not to return to Hogwarts in favor of accepting a job at the ministry, and Ron had been offered a spot in the Auror Academy without even applying. At first, Ron had been a bit miffed when Harry had told him he would not be joining the Aurors right away, but he had understood once Harry explained that he just wanted one year of his life which would not revolve around dark wizards. One year in which he could go to school, do well in his classes, and live his life as normally as possible.
You'll see.
Still at the fireplace, Nic cleared his throat, reminding Harry with a bang that he was, in fact, staring at Draco again. The brunet looked exceedingly uncomfortable, especially as he said, “Uhm…okay then. Anyway, I’m sorry if I came at a bad time, I can leave again if you want—”
He’d been waiting for an hour now, and, yes, alright, Pansy had told him they’d be a while—well, strictly speaking she’d simply said, thankfully quiet enough only he could hear, ‘Just look at him, darling!
There was a beat of silence.
It was then that another wave of pain swashed over him, so deep and cuttingly it became hard to breathe for a moment, and he bowled over again, coughing up more blood, his vision going dark. He thought he felt something on his back, and he could have sworn a voice spoke then, a voice some deep-rooted part of his mind recognized. But then another coughing fit smashed through his body, and he forgot all about the voice.
Which was just unacceptable, Harry thought with a new surge of determination. This was his bloody birthday.
“Oh, I don’t know,” she retorted. “Maybe because you hated us all through Hogwarts? Maybe because you are and always have been a bully? And maybe, just maybe, because you were a
Concern pushed itself up Draco’s throat again, and he, too, asked, “Harry? Is everything alright?”
up. So back to confusion it was.
full of shit, I’ll have you know. But, fine!
Guys. You didn’t honestly think I would ever kill off Draco, did you? To quote my beautiful cinnamon roll Blaise: It’s wounding. Consider me wounded. I admit there may be a decent amount of angst in this fic, but at the end of the day it isn’t out to hurt you, promise. Howeverrrrr, while Drarry is 1000% endgame, their journey is far from over. I’m really sorry to all those who were looking for a (relatively) quick read, but brevity has never and likely will never be a strong suit of mine, especially not regarding writing. Please be patient with me, I promise it’ll be worth the wait in the end!!
Ron blinked at him a few times, eyes wide. Harry felt distinctly uncomfortable lying in his hospital bed, unable to so much as sit up but at the same time painfully aware of half a dozen pair of eyes boring into him.
Either Harry was still sleeping and this was all an incredibly realistic-feeling dream his exhaustion-addled mind had whipped up…or that really was Draco Malfoy looming menacingly over a bowl of chocolate cake batter, clad in what seemed to be Hermione’s old pale pink apron, flower and melted chocolate coating his hands and sleeves, looking equal parts furious and fanatical as he glowered down at the innocent batter.
Blaise had been right; it wasn’t just Draco and Harry, even though it sure as hell felt like that sometimes—it was Draco and Harry and the rest of the world, and in said world, things often weren’t controllable, not by anyone, regardless of power, fame or standing.
when said Weasley was Harry’s ex-girlfriend.
Blaise studied his face, frowning and all in all not looking entirely convinced. “You sure, mate? Like I said, I could understand if you did—”
Draco turned to Hermione. “If I head over to the Ministry now, I trust you’ll stay here?”
“What happened?” he asked immediately, heart already picking up on speed. “I—why am I here? I can’t—did something—” And then, just like that, all his thoughts stopped dead in their tracks, leaving room for only one horrific realisation.
But then her dark, kohl-lined eyes landed on Harry and Draco, and her eyebrows shot up so high they disappeared under her dark bangs, Draco’s question forgotten.
“I didn’t
within him that he’d been barely able to function, let alone healthily dismantle his grief. Then had come the pain, and afterwards—and only afterwards—the tears.
Draco, however, didn’t stop squirming in his seat. If anything, he looked even more nervous.
Draco groaned, dramatic enough Harry just knew he’d be covering his face with both his hands right about now if Harry weren’t so firmly holding on to one. “Salazar’s balls, Potter, I don’t even know what that
Harry smiled and gestured towards the door. “Go. I wouldn’t want Gerhard murdering you because of me. One murderer is more than enough to deal with.”

just minutes before, wouldn’t even look at him anymore. Instead, he stood as well, quickly dusting off his suit and offering a terse nod. “Of course. After you.”
“Or what, Potter? You won’t do anything, not as long as I’ve got good old Draco here with me. If you try anything, you’ll hit him, and I’ll simply make my escape and leave you to clean up the mess.”
, had no place in Harry’s mind, not here, not now, not at all.
“Your father is a very…prideful man, Draco, as you very well know,” she said softly, cautiously. Wise move, Harry thought as he felt his boyfriend stiffen, jaw clenched. He gripped Draco’s hand tighter. “In his eyes, you don’t deserve his help, not after you renounced the Dark Lord and then proceeded to ignore him for three years. I’m not saying you acted wrong”—she added quickly when Draco opened his mouth to protest, eyes stormy—“but, in Lucius’ opinion, you abandoned him. Therefore, you’ll have a hard time getting him to be of any assistance to you, particularly if it has anything to do with Harry.”
“Here,” he said as he gave the owl the letter. “Make sure this gets to Head Auror Robards as fast as possible.”
It was simply impossible.
Because he
Enter realisation numero two: Harry was so truly and royally fucked.
Whatever it was, though, it didn’t last very long, for at that particular moment a bolt of such intense pain thundered through his stomach that he had to double over, teeth gritted so hard it hurt, in an attempt to stifle a pained little whimper, the likes of which Draco refused to let two Weasleys and his concerned best friend/Trainee Healer hear from his lips.
Except Draco was a coward, always had been, always would be, and so, needless to say, he didn’t use a single one of those replies.
Pansy grinned. “Save for snogging Draco, of course.”
So I somehow managed to write nearly 7000 words in the past two days.
“I’m sorry, I can’t say things aren’t that bad,” Draco whispered, and standing there, so close, the scent of his soulmate filled his nose, like sandalwood and cinnamon and something else, something citrusy, all combined into one, warm and wonderful and so very Harry. “I can’t say everything will be fine. But you’ll manage, understand?” He pulled away, just enough so that he could look his Gryffindor in the eyes. “You’ll manage just fine, because you’re Harry bloody Potter, and that’s what you do—you endure.”
Plus, ever since he'd moved out of Privet Drive, birthdays equaled parties which equaled get-togethers, and Harry hadn't seen everyone in so long that that something worth celebrating all in itself.
I'm a sucker for a jealous Draco sorry not sorry
A rustling sound sounded from inside the changing cubicle, followed by an indignant huff, and then the door opened, revealing Pansy, who stood clad in a black dress so tight it was a wonder she was even breathing in it. Oh, wait, scratch that. Judging by the painful set of her mouth, she likely wasn’t breathing at all.
Draco watched silently as a handful of Aurors zipped up Yaxley’s lifeless corpse into a body bag, knees drawn up to his chest where he sat on one of the grimy, dust-covered windowsills across the room.
“I’m going to be honest with you now, okay?”
Indeed, Harry stammered and stuttered, until eventually he just averted his gaze, glaring down at his plate, and muttered petulantly, “That’s rather private, y’know.”
Because Harry had trusted Draco to take him as he was, flaws and all, to support him, to not hurt him in the way he had—and, in return, had gotten his heart trampled rather mercilessly.
So this chapter is, once again, solely in Harry’s POV. I switch in between his and Draco’s depending on whose perspective is more fitting / central to the plot in each chapter. However, I promise there’ll be much more Draco Chapter 13.
He cleared his throat. “Look, I fucked up, and because of that, my best friend might die. That’s on me.” His eyes locked on to Draco’s, and when he spoke again, they shone just as fiercely as his sister’s. “But Hermione had nothing to do with it. You hear me?
Draco grinned sheepishly—which only flabbergasted Harry more, because since when did Draco do
Draco awoke smiling, and he got up and out of bed without missing a beat, and he pulled on his clothes humming a French lullaby his mother had always sung to him as a child.
Harry. Oh Merlin.
He was cut short as Harry’s lips crashed back against his. The Gryffindor threw his arms around Draco, his
When Draco had then let his friends in, the reactions had been more vocal, but, much to Draco’s everlasting gratitude, all in all just as comforting as his mother’s. Not a single one of them had been disgusted or horrified or angry, and Pansy had gone as far as saying they really shouldn’t be surprised, what with Draco’s painfully obvious crush on Potter during their time at Hogwarts, which had in turn made Draco blush furiously and mutter under his breath that he had

, three fucking years after the war had ended, and could very well die any instant now.
“I’m going to be honest with you,” he repeated, but it was nothing more than a whisper, as soft as the touch with which he tucked a stray lock of silver-blond behind one of Draco’s ears. “Because you deserve to hear the truth. It’s true, I used to hate you. I used to think you were the most arrogant, cruel, horrid arsehole I’d ever had the misfortune of meeting, and that’s saying a lot seeing as my cousin Dudley practically tortured me up until I entered Hogwarts at age eleven.”
“—sorry, my bad, you were saying—”
Harry opened his mouth, already prepared to play the peacekeeper. But before he could, Ginny spoke first, her eyes filled with blatant animosity as she glowered right back at the blond.
“Oh Salazar,” he breathed, and suddenly the room seemed to be spinning all around him, spinning and spinning and never slowing down. He raked a hand through his hair. “Oh Salazar, Salazar, Salazar. The soulmate bond. The
But this, it seemed, was not the right thing to say. Immediately, a scowl overtook Ron’s face. “Don’t give me that bullshit, Harry! You know that’s not what I meant, so don’t even try to downplay you almost dying—
He nodded. “Alright.”
Draco, however, was straining his neck for any sign of Harry, the pit in his stomach growing bigger and tighter and more agitated by the second. Pansy wouldn’t leave him behind alone, would she? No, there was simply no way. But then why wasn’t he here?
When Draco had sent off the letter to Azkaban almost a week prior, he wasn’t sure what he’d expected. Lucius Malfoy was and always had been a difficult individual, prideful until the very end, not to mention stubborn as hell. Draco couldn’t possibly count how many times he’d been told how he was ‘just like his father, bless him’, however far from the truth that might be—Draco took after his mother in all the ways that mattered.
“That’s all?” Snape asked. “Be absolutely certain, Draco. Did you say anything? Perform any spells?”
Hermione dove into the paperwork, shoving papers only briefly under Harry’s nose when he was needed to sign. His hand began to cramp after some time, and he let his mind wander, tuning out Hermione’s occasional mutterings in favor of wondering exactly what he had gotten himself into.
“Night, Potter.”
The Malfoys were whisked away soon after that, and Harry headed home to prepare for their arrival. He had told Ron and Hermione to head home, sure it would be easier for the Malfoys to acclimate without their presence. After Hermione had extracted several promises from him to “behave himself” around Malfoy, they had flooed home, and Harry headed to Grimmauld Place.
For want of something to break the heavy silence, Harry turned to Draco, whose gaze was fixed on Harry’s hands clasped within his mother’s. “You can still call me Mr. Potter, Malfoy.”
“I’ll be fine,” he insisted. “I’ll use the map to find you guys once I’m done.”
An hour later, the boys lay side by side on the Quidditch pitch, lit only by the stars and the dim lumos of their wands, trying to catch their breath.
“Night, Draco,” Harry whispered, Draco’s eyes opened just a bit to see Harry’s still wide open, fixed on him.
“What do you care, Potter, you should be thanking me! He’s a bloody death eater!”
“Draco, it is very good to see you awake,” McGonagall said, “you must have many questions.”
“You’ll be stuck with me for quite a while then, as I think that I'm in love with you, too, Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled and looked into Draco's grey eyes, and could have sworn he saw his future reflected back at him.
As if on cue, he realized with growing horror that tears were forming in his eyes, and a snitch-sized lump had taken up residence in his throat. Merlin help him, Draco would not cry in front of Harry Potter.
“Don’t interrupt me, boy,” the professor snapped, black eyes glinting dangerously. “If you would be so kind as to let me finish, I was going to say that a tutor will be assigned to you for the time being, so that you can continue your Herbology training. I understand that you take that class with the Ravenclaw seventh and eighth years, yes?”
“Very well. Give me a moment to fetch aurors to accompany the Malfoys to collect some belongings. After that, they will go directly to your home. Is that acceptable?” He looked around the room and the occupants nodded back at him. He turned and left the room without another word, murmuring under his breath all the while.
? Draco, you summoned a fully corporeal Patronus today. I haven’t done accidental magic in ages. The bond is through.”
Harry nodded. “We can’t leave them!” He shouted to Ron and Hermione. “Get out of here, destroy the diadem, we’ll be right behind you!”
The weekend passed without major incident. Harry was becoming increasingly exhausted as his nights passed with much tossing and turning, and little sleep. The trio spent a vast majority of their time in the common room, since it had become a chore to go almost anywhere within the castle.
not me. I’ll be joining my father at the Quibbler, of course. I’ll get to write about all sorts of magical creatures and plant life. It’s going to be quite exciting.”
“Classes?” Draco asked, the first thing he had asked since all the chaos had begun.
interested in the faint dusting of pink that climbed up Malfoy’s neck and spread across his cheeks. He didn’t even look when Draco swallowed hard and his Adam’s apple bobbed enticingly. Draco stared down at the pen with an inscrutable look on his pointed features. Finally, Draco sneered and responded, “Malfoys don’t write with these muggle things,” before walking away. Harry saw him slip the pen into his pocket as he left.)
“Minister Shacklebolt,” Harry started, trying to still his shaking hands. “This is absolutely unacceptable. You heard my testimony! You know I wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for Draco and Narcissa. They don’t belong in Azkaban.”
Harry emerged from the castle a short while later, flanked only by Draco, Hermione, and Ron, who could not be talked into leaving his side.
“Potter,” he said on impulse. Harry turned back to him, surprised. “...Your hair is ridiculous.”
“Understood.”
He pulled away just a fraction. “I love you,” he whispered, lips ghosting against Draco’s. When he opened his eyes, Draco’s own were red and fixed intently on him. “I love you so much, so don’t die, okay? Promise me you won’t die.”
“Well then, shall I go first or do you want to?”
Draco stopped in his tracks. Surely Harry had not been so affected by his trip to the bathroom. He had hardly been gone ten minutes and he had been just down the hall. This had to be about something else.
Sirius closed the door once Olivia and Alex walked out of sight and turned around in Remus’ arms to kiss him. “Want to know what my other tattoos mean?” he said with a sleazy grin, since none but the moon on his back and the wolf on his ankle meant anything at all.
“Draco,” Harry said again, this time arching up into his touch. “Mm, as much as I would enjoy a round two…”
“If you want to back out of this and stay here this summer, I won’t be angry. I wouldn’t ever want you to be somewhere that you didn’t want to be,” Remus explained quickly. “I would never take it out on you—“
Closing his eyes Harry smiled, nudging closer and closer until he could rest his nose on Draco’s big, handsome one. Harry could lay here forever. “That I am, Daddy. That I am.”
Everyone had to grow up and out of their purism fast when the War ended, but it still took Pansy nearly a decade to grow out of the hatred she’d been taught. Everything changed, though slowly, from interpersonal relationships to the kind of furniture she picked out.
“But I’d love to fuck you, butterfly,” Harry countered.
Malfoy was gorgeous. He had a crop of blonde hair that looked so tempting to grab that Harry almost did it once. His frame was thin, his arse was fit, and his eyes did that smoldering thing Harry had only seen models do.
“It’s beautiful, Draco,” Harry whispered of the ring.
Draco’s knees quivered slightly to hear Harry speaking once more with the conviction of a man in love. “Well then, if you’re serious…” Draco said, smoothing back Harry’s hair and giving his forehead a kiss. “Shall we go tell mum and pop we’re off for a fuck?”
After slipping her his credit card Draco returned his full attention to Harry. “Well, are you ready to cross the rainbow, Harry?” Draco motioned with his spoon, a sherbet-eating grin on as he dug in.
“Yes, but—“
He panted wildly. They’d done it. They’d really done it.
“And don’t you forget it,” Hermione chuckled, finally allowing herself to try a taste of the drink before them. “Mmm. Excellent choice in wine.”
“I’m watching Hell’s Kitchen,” Theo informed him as if that granted him the right to be left alone in Draco’s home.
“Yes, er, of course,” she nodded and just when Draco thought he was home clear he heard her pipe up again. “Um. Head Healer Pye said he was looking for you.”
“And upon further inspection I must admit I do really like these,” Harry nodded of the lavender undergarment. He kissed the bulge in them experimentally, happy to hear a slight hiss from Draco when he did. Harry wanted to be worthy, wanted to prove himself skillful enough to keep around. “I think I might like them better off of you, though.”
“You just be careful when you’re cuttin’, or you boys will be crying up a storm into that stew. Trust me, regular sea salt preferred.”
?” It had been Theo all along. It was bad enough that the sod was dating Colin. Colin had even been convinced that Draco was a decent human being somehow.
“Wound
Harry rolled his eyes fondly and opened his mouth to snark back at him before his lips were covered in Draco’s. At once Harry’s shoulders relaxed and he leaned forward, returning the kiss tenderly in spite of the pain in his arse. “I’ll be thinking of you—how could I not be when you have me walking so funny?” Harry teased when they parted for breath.
“Please,” Harry started begging immediately, finding it hard to have his usual cloak of shame over him when thrown on his back in a bra and socks taking cock like he was born to. “Please, Daddy, I want to come.”
The call wasn’t a complete failure though, Draco and Harry at least got to see she was serious about having a father who needed help—or she was just one hell of a vigilant liar. “Listen, we’ve been down here talking to Kennedy and she wants to meet you,” Harry cut to the chase. “She loves you, and money isn’t an issue. We can provide for travel.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Harry chuckled, still searching for a shirt for himself to get some work done in.
“Probably not,” Ron grinned before grabbing ahold of the other boy for a side-along apparation. “We were a bit busy back then.”
Harry was weighing his options of recapturing the tower or going after whichever unlucky bastard had captured the flag—yes, that was what the battlefield and fight for dominance among warring factions boiled down to in a PC game, capturing a flag—when the decision was made for him.
“Yes, that’s perfect!” Draco snapped his fingers. They both took off down the hall towards Harry’s room, a bit neglected these days but still a comfortable spot to retreat to. Along the way Harry pulled on the trousers and t-shirt because wherever Draco was going, he was going, too.
Harry entered with Draco trailing slightly behind him. The room they entered was full of bright colors and stained glass windows letting in even more colored light. It was a rainbow room, with bits and baubles hanging from the ceiling and gently spinning as Luna walked by them.
“That’s not very sassy gay best friend of you,” Harry teased and earned an elbow to the gut for it.
Could the email have been serious?
Harry had never accepted a deal so fast in his life.
, I’m just trying to prevent another Malfoy meltdown.”
“I have my father’s genes to thank for that,” Harry nodded of his darker skin. Lily Evans had been white as snow, but the Potter family had ancestry across continents. “But even then I’ve never really liked summer. I suppose I never got over the connotation that when summer came it meant leaving the castle. For all the peril I faced at Hogwarts I always felt safer there than with the Dursleys.”
The decision rested on a single question, then. “Are you not happy?”
Harry huffed. “Of course I trust you, but you’ve only found bullshit in the past before because you’ve been looking for it! You always expect the worst.”
you?” That was appalling to Draco. Maybe it was his pampered upbringing or the way his friend Theo’s father used to treat him, but hurting children set his blood on fire. It made him feel dangerously angry and he didn’t even like kids that much.
Lorraine was taken aback. “
“Really.”
At least the glamour spells covered up Hermione’s scar. Harry had never even tried to cover the one on his forehead.
“You know how hard it was to get father on our side for the wedding,” Draco pressed on. “I don’t want this to be a step backwards. I’ll try and break the news that we’re not jerking off into a turkey baster for a child with something he’ll at least appreciate. Pureblood, white, and blonde to make sure that father doesn’t slip some pernicious potion in our drinks.”
It was a stupid thought to have, but Draco wanted to curl back up in his bed with Harry right then and there. He wanted to kiss away every line of abuse that had been hurled at him as a child and tear down every bar that haunted his windows.
“Red it is, then.” Draco called over their server and placed the order for an expensive vintage. It made no sense to start sparing expenses now when he had people to impress.
“You can’t control them like this—“ Sirius began.
“Forever,” Harry echoed before drawing Draco in for a kiss. Forever his, forever happy, forever kept.
“Thanks,” Draco mumbled, remembering his courtesies before popping the lozenges into his mouth.
“Hm?” Draco kicked off his shoes.
“You stuffed the kitchen boxes full,” Harry shrugged, moving some specially-selected earth-tone chairs into the dining room adjacent from the kitchen.
That was certainly a concerning prospect, considering how fond Harry was of Draco’s eyes. They were stormy and commanding and soft all at once, and he wanted to drown in—
Draco was mostly just surprised that things were going so smoothly. He’d been able to avoid press attention and persistent questions, and Grace hadn’t done anything deplorable yet. Much better than expected.
Though it took a bit more coaxing on Harry’s part to get Draco sitting in an upright position, they pushed on with their latest possible Catfish.
“Wanna split a milkshake after this?” Seamus asked Dean with little hearts in his eyes. Well, metaphorical hearts, but still. “Or are you in for extended detention this time, too?”
“I’m trying, I am—“
The network wanted the show to wrap up filming as soon as possible so that they could get it into production and work out the nuances of what would hopefully be a hit. There would have to be a formula to each episode: meeting the individual who needed help, researching their online lover, and then arranging a meeting with them. That meeting would be filmed as well, and Kingsley was glad that would be different every time.
“Yeah, actually. I saw him about a week ago, ran into him when I needed help with Suzy.”
“Healer Malfoy?” rang a familiar voice just as Draco reached for the doorknob to his office. Merlin’s fucking arse.
“No,” Draco sighed in reference to the email Harry had read.
“Mm,” Harry mumbled under him. He’d never intended it to come out as a word, so he was happy with the results.
“Sadly,” Theo grinned, glad for the change of topic. “Even I’m not that good.”
Draco wriggled his trousers the rest of the way off along with the shoes he’d worn in, their clothes as sprawled out on the floor as the pair of them were.
Pansy’s living room made use of metallic and modernism in a way she would have never thought to experiment with years ago. Modern was muggle, and that used to be unacceptable to Pansy Parkinson.
The warm, glowing sensation was unparalleled. Screw being a resistance leader, a vampire, a wolf, a hero, or anything else if that was what being an average bloke snogging Draco Malfoy felt like.
“Perfect,” she chirped. At least she hadn’t committed a major faux pas like she had almost every other time Draco and Harry were involved. Well, she hadn’t committed one yet.
“Ahhh,” Draco sighed. “Breathe deep, Harry. We stay in here for ten minutes, or until we’re really sweating.” Draco sat down on a wooden bench, back leaning against the wall as he continued to take deep, cleansing breaths.
killed Fred—“
Harry had offered in reply.
of defying your rules, Daddy,” Harry grinned cheekily, mouth tugged right after into a gasp from how fast Draco began the pace of his thrusts.
“Yes?” Kingsley asked before taking the card for himself. “Oh.”
Draco kept his voice hushed. The crew was trying to get dramatic shots and Draco and Harry didn’t want to distract them. “I didn’t screw both of them—don’t look so scandalized. There was a gay one and a straight one and Pansy had the straight one in her grasp from the moment he looked at her. She’s an evil temptress,” Draco remarked fondly.
Agh, I’m 17! What the hell? Growing up is ridiculous. I am now officially driving places, and I got cast in a music video. TW for slurs and talk of menstruation.  Anyway, this one’s for eloyellow! You’ve left such touching reviews but I haven’t got a chance to reply since you’re a guest. You’re lovely.
“You’re very welcome. I knew today would be hard for you, so I wanted to make sure you had something relaxing to come home to,” Harry said from his place tucking his head the crook of Draco’s shoulder. “May I undress you?”
He’d read somewhere that withdrawing from social events out of anxiety was probably a warning sign that something much, much bigger was going on in Harry’s head, but thinking about that only stressed him more.
low standards. It’s highly realistic and even a little self-deprecating,” he snarked.
“That’s before you were you! I only knew half of the story!”
“So now you want to be my friend because it makes you look Saintly for talking to a Slytherin?” Draco teased to see if that was still allowed in this tentative agreement.
Colin was glad he understood the nuance. “You better learn how to change a diaper,” he teased just to see the horror flash over Theo’s face before their side-by-side apparation.
“She’s beautiful,” Harry said quietly, feeling a pang in his heart when he realized Dudley had kids before him.
“Theodore,” she said sweetly like she had the first time they met. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“Sounds good. I would want to go back to my flat sometimes, too.”
Harry chuckled to himself, and for a moment he couldn’t even hear the sweet-talk between Dean and Seamus behind him.
“That’s Harry’s job,” Draco declared.
“Who refuses to speak to us until we emotionally scar his kid.”
“Yeah, I said early on you should bring a date. Bit unexpected who you chose, but sure, Harry,” Ron gave his blessing once he saw Hermione was fine with it.
“Maybe that’s what the ‘scream’ bit is about.” The ‘scream’ bit could have also been the ramblings of a crazed killer, but if they were treating this like it was a clue, then Ron figured he may as well consider all the options.
Draco fished his wand out of his discarded trousers and cast a spell to cover his hand in lubricant. “Something like that,” he grinned, trailing a finger down Harry’s cock and balls to reach back towards his hole. “But I’d like us to be even closer, wouldn’t you?” Draco eased in a finger and sighed at how warm he was.
Harry gave his friend a hug. “Congratulations,” he told Colin before patting his back and pulling back. “I think you two are brilliant together.”
“And?”
Ron was flabbergasted. “Harry, do you realize how calm you sound right now?”
“Right down the hall. Get behind the desk!”
“Remember what that feels like,” Draco instructed, taking some mental notes on Harry’s reactions down to the little arches in his back when he wanted more. “Because you’ve been bad enough to earn Daddy’s hand
“Now,” Draco wheezed, still thrusting without a care that he was growing soft. He could feel his come dribbling down out of Harry’s hole, wide and used. “Now, Harry, come for me.”
He beat her down the stairs, giving her another warm and comforting smile. Maybe if he tried enough of those, then Olivia would give up the notion of working for her keep like a tenant.
Draco rolled his eyes fondly, confident that neither of them knew a single thing about growing up. There wasn’t one way to do it, and they’d get to watch their own children give it a shot one day.
Draco offered him a small smile, one that wouldn’t crack his face mask. “Then you can date Flint. I know how you like my sloppy seconds.”
Harry kicked his legs up onto the desk. The motion reminded him of what he had done to Draco the night before; another intrusion of Draco into every aspect of his life. Maybe Draco would soon fill every corner of his brain, and then Harry could live his days blissfully unaware of his diminished capacity. “Scream,” he said again in spite of the fact that it also brought back memories of the night before. “Where do people go to scream?”
“I am,” Harry assured him. “And happier than I’ve ever been.”
“Ron,” Harry greeted him and put on a smile. He was happy to see his best mate, but smiles just didn’t come that easily anymore. They embraced with a tight hug, Ron giving Harry a few pats on the back.
Draco cocked an eyebrow, shifting in Harry’s arms so he could get a proper and full view of the ‘bitch please’ face he was making. “Our little Lily Narcissa Malfoy-Potter is not going to be some blindly courageous heroine. She will be clever, manipulative, and a true leader.”
Though hesitant, both the older and younger man put their fists out.
“Ellie!” the boy cried and reached for the figurine before Draco could swat his hand away.
Draco Malfoy approached his table, students clad in greens and blacks just like him.
“They were so pretty I couldn’t look away. Lace, and dresses, and silk sheets… It bothered me for a long time until I realized I didn’t want to be
Draco rolled his eyes. “And you had to come all the way here to tell us that? What about the friend you were staying with?”
“Thank you,” Wesley said again, his face framed by his poor-quality webcam. “She always said she couldn’t chat on camera, but I’ve heard her voice on the phone, ah, I’m rambling. I thought this was a hopeless cause, is all. Just—thank you. I can’t wait until this is all over.”
“Yeah,” Pansy and Blaise answered quickly, standing on their wobbly feet to pad their way over to the fireplace.
Harry immediately looked to Draco for help, but he seemed to be absorbed in whatever pictures Colin was showing him with his high-definition camera. Dammit. They’d done the whole corsage prom picture deal at the steps and taken at least a hundred photos that Harry was blinking in half of. Narcissa’s family camera had one hell of a flash, which Harry suspected to be on purpose. “Uh.”
Draco pulled out the chair and sat down, silver eyes flicking between Hagrid and Potter. There had been a time where Draco opposed Hagrid’s professorship and livelihood at Hogwarts—did he want the same for Draco now? Maybe the half-giant was one of his many detractors.
“Okay,” Colin agreed as if there were any question in the first place. He was proud of Theo for handling this so well.
“Fuck,” Draco gasped to have such hot, wet walls close around him. His arms were shaking slightly now, and he had to fight to keep propped up and looking at Harry.
*** *** ***
Total lie. He’d measured it before and made a fake yahoo answers account to see if it was average.
“As opposed to not sex-sex?”
Draco left him and their gossiping, chattering friends behind with a brand-new phone in his hand. He’d even bought Harry a case a little while later—no point in getting him an upgrade if Harry was going to be careless and scratch it—with the Alliance insignia from World of Warcraft on it.
“Smile for the camera, Malfoy-Potter!”
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy.”
Shit. The poor thing sounded on the verge of tears. “We haven’t made our decision yet as to who we’re selecting,” Draco clarified, not wanting to get her hopes up. “Just tell the clerk that you’re there for the Seaside Meeting Room and then we’ll talk, okay?”
While Harry was busy sulking about how insane his life had become because of a man in a video game, Draco was trying to figure out what was on his mind. All he knew was that Harry looked displeased.
“Thank you…”
Sirius shrugged. “Girls develop faster than boys. Maybe when I’m sixty I’ll have the maturity level Lily Potter had at twenty. That seems about right.”
The non-gingers positioned themselves behind the desk in the pitch-black classroom. Someone’s elbow was in Harry’s side and he had no idea whose. Life was just dandy.
It took three showers in the employee locker room and several angrily-muttered spells, but Draco’s hair was finally clean enough to be up to his standards. He’d nearly scrubbed his scalp raw in the process, but it was all worth it to have that goop smell off of him.
That was another thing. Harry had asked Chris to call him back, but he got a text. Why didn’t Chris want them to hear his voice? It was only more evidence against his existence.
“Thanks, mum,” said Draco.
Carefully, Grace walked towards the source of the shouting. It was just around a corner and in the kitchen, where she was finally able to peek in on the chaos.
Next came Draco’s trousers, falling in a pool around his ankles once he undid the button and zipper. He wore nothing but tight black briefs and decided quickly he couldn’t live with those on either. Shedding his last layer of clothing, Draco let it fall to the ground without a care.
“Damn,” Draco echoed in an effort to pretend he had been paying attention. “Now would be the time to call, then.”
“This’ll give you about three meters of track to start out with, see how it forms the loops nicely on the back?” the clerk demonstrated, pointing to the pictures illustrating the many features of this train. “You can buy more cargo attachments in aisle three, and that row we passed to get here will give you enough foliage to really make the scene come to life. Aisle four has buildings and stations, and five has miniature figures. You can paint them yourself, if you like.”
Shifting his weight but ultimately unable to move, Harry had nowhere to lean but into the pinches, yelps and all. He teetered on his heels with nothing to do but take it, just as he’d wanted. “It’s you, Draco, you’re so good at this and you make me feel safe, like, like everything is okay. Even when it’s not, and... Hits have always felt like kisses from you.”
“Harry!”
Harry sat back down, hands trembling. Hermione leaned over Ron and whispered to him, “Harry, are you sure you know what you’re getting yourself into?” Harry nodded firmly, trying to convey much more confidence than he felt.
Harry stilled, gaze darting between Draco and Luna as they carried on a quiet, amicable discussion on how best to sift through the immense amount of information in front of them. For all Harry had watched Draco this year, he had never looked quite so comfortable. The slight upturn of his lips, the ease with which he was speaking with Luna. It was the first glimpse of pre-war Draco he had seen, and it had been Luna to bring it out of him.
When he had first started trying to summon a Patronus back in fifth year, he had imagined a silver swan bursting out of his wand, graceful and elegant, like his mother’s. After months of relentless practice, the most he could do was conjure a silvery shield in front of himself. He knew it was most likely because he wasn’t using powerful enough memories, but, pathetic as it was, he just didn’t think he had anything happy enough at his disposal.
“After insulting my godfather’s home.”
It had been a long year for Draco, though it was not yet half over. Really, it had been a long several years, but somehow this was shaping up to be the worst, despite the constant threat of war no longer looming over his head.
.’ But he hadn’t been able to gather the courage, and before long, Draco was back to his books.
Draco very much resembled a caged animal at that moment, eyes darting about the room, shrinking away from Harry as though he might strike. He looked
A long moment passed, and when Harry’s breathing finally evened out, Draco released his hold on him. “There we are,” he said, “no need to destroy my room with your dramatics.”
Draco knew he must have looked rather stupid, mouth agape as it was, but he couldn’t help it. He wanted to remark on something, but had no idea what he was expected to say. In the end, all he was able to choke out was, “You were
It took him three tries to put out the lights with a Nox charm. By the end of it, his aching body was absolutely begging him to rest. He laid back, placing the wand reverently in its spot next to his bed, and was asleep within moments.
The halls of Hogwarts, however, proved that much had changed. Draco was one of the very few Slytherins who had returned, and that was simply because he had nowhere else to go. It was immediately clear that, though the Wizengamot had cleared him of all charges, the student body was not so quick to forgive.
“Oh!” Harry had, after all,  completely forgotten. He grinned sheepishly, shifting awkwardly so he could grab the wand  from his back pocket. Their shoulders brushed, and Harry noticed that Draco did not recoil. He held the wand, taking a moment to appreciate what it had done for him, and then presented it to Draco. “This is yours, I think.”
His stash of muggle writing supplies lasted him through roughly half of the second year. It was with no small amount of regret that he threw his last eraserless nub of pencil into the rubbish and picked up one of his emergency quills. He snapped the first cursed quill within the hour.
McGonagall was looking back and forth between Harry and Draco. “Oh, dear,” she murmured. “Oh,
Harry took a step forward. “Draco, of course I trust you. I’m sorry. You’re right.” I’m only worried for you, he almost added. I couldn’t bear it if you were hurt, he thought.
“Well,” Snape said, voice dark and low, “I suppose that proves our theory.”
Draco settled into bed, and after a moment’s hesitation, he grabbed his wand from the bedside table. He had not attempted any magic since the failed levitation charm in the hospital wing, and the thought of trying it made him acutely aware of the hollow pit in his stomach where a soothing, whirling
It was hours later when Professor Snape sent for them, and the only thing they had gained from the piles of books were headaches. Draco snapped the book in front of him shut, feeling distinctly grouchy. It certainly didn’t help that the only thing he had eaten all day was an apple, and it had to be approaching late afternoon.
Draco forced his eyes open just a fraction, enough to see the exceedingly worried faces of Madame Pomfrey and Harry Potter hovering above him. Draco’s eyes snapped to Harry’s forehead, but the only mark was the famous lightning bolt scar, as if nothing had happened in the corridor at all.
A heavy silence followed, and Draco felt as though Harry could probably hear his heart racing, for it was deafening in his own ears. It was the most he had spoken about himself in a long time. When it became practically unbearable, Draco cleared his throat and said, “Oh, and the only pets I’ve ever had are those dreadful peacocks. Horrible pets, quite mean. Your turn.”
Draco sighed and fell back in his bed, scooting closer to the wall and pulling back the comforter on the other side. “If it means you’ll stop talking and let me go to sleep, then have at it. Git.”
Snape sighed and turned a somewhat softer gaze on Draco. “I’m sure it is frustrating that we do not have all the answers, but do try to be patient.”
Draco hadn’t left, nor had he offered a word or hand in comfort. He had simply scooted a bit closer to Harry and remained silent, doing Harry the great favor of not looking at him. After what felt like an hour but was probably only a few minutes, Harry’s heaving sobs turned into quiet, sniffling crying, and he scrubbed his face with the ragged sleeves of his sweater. He took in a deep breath, counting to ten as he held it, and then blew it out again. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Draco watching him cautiously.
Luna nodded. “Yes. One to my father, and one to Hermione, as we discussed.”
Harry snorted and rolled onto his back. “Tell me about it. I never thought I would be at Hogwarts without Ron and Hermione. Never thought I’d miss you shouting insults at me from across the courtyard, either. But here we are.”
At once, Harry sighed deeply and the air around him lost its charged quality. Draco’s fingers tightened reflexively on Harry’s arm and his breath caught in his throat as he realized- physical touch helped to calm Harry. Not just any touch,
“There’s nothing we can do, Draco. I’ve got to die, or Voldemort can’t be killed.”
“Poppy!” McGonagall cried again, just as the mediwitch scurried out from the back room, tying her robe tight as she ran over.
“Hello, old friend,” he murmured.
“She’s lovely, isn’t she?”
Harry flushed and averted his gaze for the first time, reaching up to scratch the back of his head awkwardly. “Er… right. Maybe- um. Maybe not so much. Anymore.”
“Of course you won’t, because you are an unmannered boor.”
He stopped abruptly as an entire shelf of mason jars filled with various potions ingredients along the wall behind him exploded. Draco jumped and looked at Harry in alarm. The air around him seemed to be vibrating, and he was flushed with rage. He barely seemed to have noticed the destruction he had just caused, so fixed was his hard glare on Snape. Acting on instinct once again, Draco reached out and laid his hand on Harry’s arm. “Hush, Potter,” he said softly. “No need for the dramatics.”
Color rose in Harry’s cheeks. The look suited him, Draco thought. “You don’t have to be a twat about it.”
“No,” Draco agreed. “He didn’t seem to want to… Which means that this is all my fault. If Professor Snape had just let the Dark Lord kill me-”
Snape was beginning to lose his patience, but was working hard to maintain his composure. “Please elaborate. What exactly did you say?”
Harry nodded solemnly. “Yes. If you do this, if you come with me to Dumbledore, then you’ll have me. I’ll support you, protect you, give you a place to stay. Whatever you need. I’ll make an Unbreakable Vow if that’s what you want.”
Draco clenched his jaw reflexively and fixed his gaze at the starched white blanket on top of him.
In the ruined remains of the castle he had loved as his home for the past eighteen years, Harry found out that Draco had, in fact, kept the pen. (“Did you try writing with it?” Harry asked, fingers carding absently through silky blond strands of hair. Draco scoffed, leaning into the touch. “Malfoys don’t write with muggle inventions.”) Draco kept the pen like a talisman, something to hold onto when smoke seemed to fill his lungs and he couldn’t close his eyes without seeing a green flash of cursed light. Harry didn’t mind seeing him write with the ridiculous eagle quill, even when there was a clearly superior pen only inches away.
“Wait!” Draco’s panicked cry stopped Harry short, and he followed Draco’s gaze toward Crabbe and Goyle, perched atop an unsteady tower of debris, terror plain on their faces.
The voice of Draco Malfoy broke him from his reverie. Harry grinned and obeyed, stepping back and turning to face his friends. Hermione and Ron were holding hands, and Hermione was beaming at him. Draco looked positively exhausted, dark circles marring his pale face.
Draco was grinning at him. Not smirking, not sneering, but actually grinning, and Harry had to respond with a smile of his own. “You finally get my jokes,” Draco commented with a touch of approval. “After all those years where I thought maybe you just were born without a sense of humor.”
Harry had done as he had promised. He had finally spoken on behalf of Draco and Narcissa Malfoy. He tried to maintain his self-assured and imposing posture, but the longer the Wizengamot deliberated, the more he wished he could tug at the collar of his dress shirt. He dared not look at the Malfoy family, who were seated several feet away from each other, hands bound as if they were common criminals.
Draco looked up at the sound of his surname and spared a moment to think about how that was the second time Harry had asked him that question in as many days, though he had never once asked in the seven years prior. He nodded quickly, glad to find that they had reached the potions master’s office.
“Oh, this must be Narcissa and the young Draco Malfoy. It is very good to be meeting you indeed,” he croaked, bowing as low as possible. “May old Kreacher be taking your bags to your rooms, esteemed guests of Master Harry?”
“Good morning, Draco. There’s some fruit on the table there if you’re hungry,” she said, disarmingly kind. He nodded at her warily. They hadn’t spoken since… well, since the Manor.
Draco glanced down at his grey slacks and dark green jumper and smirked. “You would think these are ‘fancy’ clothes.” He eyed Harry’s well-worn jeans and tee-shirt with disdain and Harry struggled not to snap at him.
Draco sighed. “What’s got your knickers in a twist, Potter?”
Harry slid out of bed at once, turning back to Draco with a weak smile. “Thanks for letting me stay here last night.” Draco caught his gaze flick down to his chest once more before he turned and quickly left the room.
Everything had happened very quickly. Harry had seen Smith pointing his wand at Draco’s retreating back, and he had acted on impulse, shoving Draco out of the way. It was typical for him to have not been able to regain his own balance, crashing into the bloody statue face-first.
The room went silent as they all waited for him to respond. Draco felt uncomfortable under the gazes of so many people. He tried to focus his attention on Snape, one of the few people whom he was comfortable speaking freely with.
He nodded and slid into bed. The air between them was too tense, too charged, Draco felt he could barely breathe in it.
Harry sat at breakfast on the fourth morning in which Draco’s seat was conspicuously empty. He poked halfheartedly at his eggs, feeling discomfited. He hadn’t known what to expect, but this continual silence was making him feel very uneasy indeed.
He had never felt such anger toward his two very best friends in the entire time he had known them.
Draco looked up, pale and small, at Kingsley. “I agree.”
like that, but. Well. Yeah.”
“I wouldn’t go that far, Mother,” Draco drawled, looking bored.
Luna smiled kindly. “Of course, Harry. I’ll meet you there.” She handed him the large slipper, patted him on the cheek, and was off. As Draco watched her go, he heard her mumbling nonsensical numbers under her breath.
A huff of annoyance, and then, “Well, one day I was a baby hanging out with my parents, doing baby stuff, I imagine, when this lunatic-”
,’ he wanted to say. ‘
He shrugged. “Things change.”
Draco’s face was bright with unsuppressed glee, an expression so vastly different from what it had been moments earlier. “Harry, how absolutely
“You’re quite right, Harry,” Luna said, now petting the slipper as if it were a large cat. “My father knows quite a lot about obscure magic, I’ll owl him and see if he’s ever heard of something like this happening before.”
Draco turned around, looking equal parts apprehensive and relieved. “Potter.” Harry was momentarily stunned. Who would have thought this moment would ever come? Draco Malfoy looking relieved to see Harry Potter.
Madame Pomfrey pushed him firmly back down to the bed. “You’re feverish, Mr. Potter. Wait here, do not move from this bed.” She rushed off to her potions cabinet, grabbing two vials and returning to Harry’s bedside. She waited as he gulped them down and shuddered hard. The candles in the doorway were back to normal, but the space around Harry still seemed charged.
“You okay, Malfoy?”
,” he said, loudly this time. The glass fell over with a resounding ‘
You don’t see me spouting off trivia about Colin Creevey, do you? Nor you about Theodore Nott.”
“Draco, stop,” Harry interrupted. “He would have found a way to make Snape do it no matter what, you know that.”
“Malfoy!”
Shacklebolt sighed. “I give you far too much leeway, Harry. Honestly.”
“Er.”
“I’m sorry that this happened.” Harry looked so sincere that it made Draco’s heart lurch and tears blurred his vision once more. After a moment had passed, Harry asked softly, “Why don’t you talk anymore?”
Though Voldemort was still at large and his godfather was still dead, his sixth year at Hogwarts was the first time he felt like he could breathe in over a year. It was also when he was sixteen that all of his friends accused him of being obsessed with Draco Malfoy. This was completely and categorically untrue. Sure, Draco was no doubt up to something nefarious, and of course Harry was most interested in learning what it was. Yes, he had been tracking him on the Marauders Map at night and sometimes between classes, and
Snape’s lip curled in distaste as he glanced pointedly at Draco’s hand, which was still on Harry’s am. “If it were up to me, Mr. Potter, you would be locked in the hospital wing, unable to do damage to any more of this school or its inhabitants. Draco has the unfortunate burden of being tied to you, however, so we will be forced to make the best of the situation until it is resolved.” Harry clenched his jaw, and Draco moved his hand down, circling Harry’s wrist and moving his thumb in what he hoped was a soothing manner, stroking the soft skin near Harry’s racing pulse. “You are free to choose whatever tutor you’d like. You will, however, have to accompany Draco to Arithmancy and Runes.”
“That question you wanted to ask,” Draco said as if he were reminding him. “To Martha.” Draco gestured to a woman sitting in the audience smiling ear-to-ear.
“So good to see you again,” Harry said after his hug with the victim of their first Catfish case. “Tell us how you’re doing since filming.”
Draco pursed his lips in a tight smile. Yes, he could talk about the date, perhaps… Ah! This was how she always got him! “Well, I’ll have you know I took him on a date. Bar to meet, then tailor to a tailor to get him a decent suit—“
“Weren’t you the one just saying this was invasive?” Hermione poked fun. “You can’t resist being an Auror about it.”
“Hey,” Tiffany said, holding the applicator brush in her hand. “I do not appreciate the name-calling right now.”
“I’m a Gryffindor,” Draco said between kisses along Harry’s stomach. He liked how soft the skin was and how Harry wasn’t some burly gym-rat. He also liked how Harry had allowed him to lose himself in their world rather than deal with the real one. “I like treacle tarts, saving the world, and sucking men off.”
“Sure we do.” Sirius saw it as an opportunity to bond over food, which was his favorite kind of bonding. “How about tomorrow night, hm? Just give us an address and we’re there.” He paused. “Sorry that there’s not too many kids on this street. Or the next street over. Or the one after that. Hey, at least that makes you the belle of the ball if we ever have a block party!”
A breath of relief and annoyance came out of Potter. “You—you really had me going for a second there,” he admitted, shaking his head. “That was cruel.” But he said it with a smile.
“What’s wrong with your food?” Harry had asked at one point. “I know you like steak and kidney pie.” He actually froze with his fork halfway to his mouth when he had said that, realizing far too late how bizarre it sounded. How would he know Draco liked steak and kidney pie, if not for the way he had stared at him across the Great Hall, watching for seven whole years? Draco merely raised an elegant eyebrow in his direction before returning to the apparently all-consuming task of moving bits of food around his plate.
The use of his proper name startled Harry out of his own panic and the wind died abruptly as Harry finally tore his gaze away from the scar to meet Draco’s eyes.
Harry nodded tersely. “Yes, sir.”
It was another morning in the astronomy tower. Harry and Draco sat in silence, looking out over the grounds as they had countless times in the past year. This time, everything was different.
“Rest with us, Draco” Luna said quietly. “We’ll keep you safe.”
Suddenly, his hands burned as unexpectedly and severely as if he had touched an open flame. His eyes flew open and met the wide, startled green eyes of the boy who had only moments before been unconscious.
Hermione's arm shot out to block Draco. “No,” she growled, and Harry had never heard her sound so fierce.
Draco and Harry both stared open-mouthed at Snape. After several excruciatingly silent moments, Harry closed his eyes and frowned. “Now that you mention it, my magic does feel… different.”
“So, Professor,” Harry started slowly, “Malfoy was able to heal me because of this... life debt. Thing. Right?”
‘I could never love you,’ it whispered savagely. ‘You’re nothing more than your father’s son, Death Eater scum.’
“Er, right…” Draco could hear him scuffing his trainers against the floor. “Malfoy, I’ll come see you tomorrow, okay? I’ll bring some books from the library, we can figure this out.”
Kingsley narrowed his eyes in his direction. “What is the meaning of this, Mr. Potter?”
Harry had never seen a fire burn so hot, nor spread so quickly.
“Completely normal,” he answered immediately. “What is going on?”
“I know,” Draco answered quietly, thinking about a dank basement in a cold house, and Luna’s warm, forgiving smile.
Harry could watch no more. He slung his bag over his shoulder, grabbing two shiny green apples from the serving tray in front of him. He rushed off toward Draco, despite the bewildered protests of his friends.
What a bizarre thing, Draco thought. Harry Potter wanted to know about his childhood. As if they were real friends, and not just forced together by some strange bond. He was not above taking advantage of the situation and enjoying it while it lasted, though he knew it would only be all the more painful when it ended.
“The sooner we start,” Draco cut in, after having been conspicuously quiet throughout the night, “the sooner we can stop living in filth. Honestly, I’m pretty sure I've got asthma after walking through all the dust in this place.”
“I don’t remember you being very skilled with wandless magic, Harry,” Luna said.
McGonagall stopped the assault of the books and sent them all back to their shelves with a wave of her wand, looking distinctly startled. “That will be quite enough of that, I think. I would thank you both to calm down and continue on with the story. Smith, are you injured?”
“Besides,” Harry pressed on, “you don’t really want to start tomorrow, do you? There’s not any rush. You could take some time to get settled, if you’d like.”
Draco opened his mouth to respond, then caught the sight of three other openly curious faces in his periphery. His jaw shut with a click and he nodded.
Harry kept his eyes closed, seeming to be thinking hard. “It’s difficult to explain. Less… settled, I suppose. It feels strange.” He opened his eyes and slid his own wand out of his pocket, eyeing the glass Draco had tried to levitate. He pointed his wand at it. “
Kingsley sat back in his chair, staring at the Malfoys curiously and with deep skepticism. “I want you to understand that these are far from the usual hearings. That Mr. Potter is being so good as to make this offer on your behalf shows he has a trust in you that you should not take lightly, nor should you take advantage of.” After another moment of quiet contemplation, he stood. “The Malfoy sentences are as follows. Draco Malfoy will spend two years in house arrest under the custody of Harry James Potter. Narcissa Malfoy will spend five years in house arrest under the custody of Harry James Potter. Lucius Malfoy will serve twenty years in Azkaban, allowing for monthly visitors. Now, unless anyone else has something to add…” Kingsley shot Harry a significant look, and Harry grinned sheepishly. “This concludes the Malfoy family hearing.”
Harry Potter hated quills. He hated quills since Hagrid had taken him to Diagon Alley for the very first time, back when he was eleven years old. (“I’m going to need some pens and pencils,” he had said to Hagrid, the picture of naïveté. Hagrid had stared at him in confusion while he described the writing implements, then he had broken out into a grin and handed him an over large feather. A
Harry stood on the precipice of the bridge leading to the castle, surveying the destruction of the home he so loved.
————-
“Ah, yes, Mr. Potter. My name is Penny Greene, I’m Minister Shacklebolt’s new assistant. Come this way, please.” Without waiting for a response, she rushed down a nearby hallway, walking impressively quick in her outrageously high heels. After exchanging brief glances, Harry, Ron, and Hermione scurried after her, catching up only when she stopped in front of a door near the end of the passageway.
Harry shrugged and hugged his knees to his chest. “Well, he was just protecting you, wasn’t he? I think he and Dumbledore both knew Voldemort would be after you if he didn’t do it. Snape, he… He didn’t look like he wanted to do it, did he? He looked upset.”
“Bravo, Mr. Malfoy, bravo! That is quite a fine stag indeed! Finer almost than Mr. Potter’s, even, though the two are remarkably similar.” He beamed up at Draco, as though he were not actively ruining the boy’s life, then turned to Harry. “Harry, my boy, would you care to summon your own Patronus?”
“It was just a tripping jinx,” Smith protested hotly.
“Potter, this Draught of Peace is atrocious. I am tempted to have you consume it so we could all witness what effects this disaster would have on the human body.”
“When Madame Pomfrey found you boys,” Professor McGonagall started, “Harry was perfectly unharmed. You, Mr. Malfoy, could not be awoken, and, as she told you, you remained unconscious for two days.”
from an unknown Hufflepuff. He had gaped at it, tore it to shreds, and held his eyes open until they watered.
“Stop being so dramatic, Malfoy. Let’s go get the cloak and my broom.”
Harry appeared to be exercising great restraint as he responded, “Yes, Professor. I’m sure Luna Lovegood would be happy to tutor me.”
Red light met green as they cast simultaneously. Harry could feel the presence of his friends, his family, at his back and was endlessly grateful they had come with him.
In the ensuing silence, a growing sense of dread and unease began to take up room in the pit residing in Draco’s stomach. He had used his ‘magical essence’ to heal Potter, Snape had told him. How much, exactly, had he used?
Draco came back to himself quickly. “I’m not bad at it.” Luna smiled serenely at him and Harry nodded, as if that settled the matter.
“What happened?” He rasped. Madame Pomfrey rushed to fetch him a glass of water, which he took gratefully, finishing it in several quick gulps.
“You mean you’ve been joking with me all this time?”
Draco felt like rubbish. Maybe worse than rubbish, since at least trash was usually contained in a bin. He felt like he was tearing apart at the seams, exhausted beyond belief, fatigued and aching and hollow. He had become very comfortable with his solitude, and the past few days had worn on him tremendously. It was proving harder than he would have anticipated to rejoin the world of the social. Not that he ever anticipated needing to rejoin it at all.
He had brought Draco to Dumbledore as promised, and had been quickly dismissed with a wave of Dumbledore’s hand. “Me and Mr. Malfoy have much to discuss, Harry, if I am not terribly mistaken. Please leave us.”
Twenty minutes later, Harry was casting Scourgify on every surface of the kitchen, trying to clear the worst of the grime which had accumulated. Household spells were not his strong suit, and he was sweating by the time his doorbell rang. He glared at a particularly stubborn and mysterious purple-ish stain next to the sink, threw a hand towel over it, and rushed to get the door.
Kreacher wrung the filthy pillowcase he wore between his knobbly fingers. “It cannot be… the sister of Bellatrix, living here?”
Draco stared at him for a moment and scooted over in bed automatically. He watched as Harry climbed into his bed, feeling comfortable enough to tug a bit of blanket off of Draco and onto himself. Draco took a moment to appreciate the ease and familiarity of the gesture. The intimacy of it.
“Hmm, yes,” agreed Luna. She unfurled from her place beside Draco on the sofa after patting him softly on the hand. He spared her only a glance before staring off in the direction of his bedroom. Luna padded over and stooped down to kiss Harry on the cheek, then went off to her room, bidding them goodnight as she went.
, deserve a Saviour that looks the part’, then promptly proceeded to drag one helpless-looking, pleading-eyed Harry out of the café by his shirt sleeve.
Draco stared at him for a long, long moment. Harry half-expected him to start yelling, half-suspected the blond might just get up and leave; he certainly didn’t look to be Harry’s biggest fan at the time being.
Pansy shook her head, running a hand through her perfectly slick bob. “Fuck.”
The words came tumbling out of Harry’s mouth before he even realised he’d opened it. However, he didn’t regret them, not one bit.
“Honestly,” sighed Harry. “Enough with the paranoia already. Everything’ll be
Before the Death Eater could finish the sentence, Draco had leapt to his feet and thrown up a ‘Protego’. And when a ‘Flipendo’ shot from the tip his wand, slicing through the air before it collided with the distracted Death Eater and sent him flying backwards into a particularly ugly umbrella stand, Yaxley had never seen it coming.
Draco snorted and shook his head. “Salazar, Potter, relax. I’m not offended.” His face softened. “Quite the opposite, as a matter of fact. Do you really believe that? That I
He glanced around the room, as did Healer Hodkinson. To Blaise, who still stood leaning against the doorframe, arms folded, looking completely calm and in no hurry to leave; to Pansy, legs crossed and shoulders back, who simply watched the Healer under raised brows, nose wrinkled in obvious distaste; to Draco, who may not be clutching Harry’s hand anymore but hadn’t moved an inch from his chair at the side of Harry’s bed, now fixing Healer Hodkinson with the type of glare that promised a slow and painful death.
, Potter. Absolutely not.” Whereas he’d usually smooth any loose strands back into place instantly, he didn’t even seem to notice them this time, too busy shaking his head some more. “No, no and
. There’s no reason you should be out in the open like this, not when Yaxley has proven himself far more resourceful than anyone could have predicted. He obviously has allies in high places, otherwise there’s no way he’d have escaped the platoon of Aurors Robards sent after him the other day. And if thirty-something Aurors can’t hold their own against him, I doubt a disgraced heir, a fashion designer and a Healer-in-training will do you much good, Harry.”
Hermione, again, rolled her eyes. “Twenty-one, Ronald, not twenty-five.”
Hermione was grinning now, the triumphant sort Draco had seen more than enough times back at Hogwarts, when a teacher praised her for knowing the answer or she got full marks on an exam. Back then, he’d hated her, and he’d hated her grin.
Harry blinked at the blond, taken aback. Yes, Malfoy was still sneering, his expression once again that of the spoiled rich kid from Hogwarts. But underneath all the open hostility, Harry thought the sentiment might have been…sincere. As though Malfoy genuinely didn’t want him to die, guard-duties aside.
And then he understood why Draco had stopped; bloody hell, he was
And before Draco could even fully process those words, process what Yaxley had done to the woman he’d loved, to his soulmate, the Death Eater spoke again.
This little detail was enough to vanish any lingering amusement the blond might have felt up to this point in time, and instead replace it with dread, the sort that sent a bolt of alarm up his spine and had his eyes narrowing into slits.
Yaxley tutted. “I can’t just go spoiling everything, now can I? Where’s the fun in that? No, I think I’ll let you figure it out yourself, and by the time dear Mister Potter meets his untimely demise, you’ll know what I meant.”
However, sitting there in his messy living room on the faded yellow sofa he’d bought from Ikea when he first moved into the apartment, clad in sweatpants, Mrs. Weasley’s maroon Christmas jumper and one sock, hand clasped around that of his boyfriend who—even in a simple pair of trousers and a grey jumper—looked like he’d just fallen out of a magazine, seated across from said boyfriend’s mother, who put muggle supermodels to shame…
…and then promptly froze again when Draco realized just where he was.
It was astonishing, really, how much the mere sight of the man’s gaunt, twisted face made Draco’s blood broil, his chest prickle with something sharp and venomous, his fists ache and itch just to lift up and collide with the side of Yaxley’s jaw, to hear that sickening crunch and wipe that revolting fucking smile off his face.
“No, Roxanne,” supplied Ginny. “That’s what they’ve decided on naming the baby. Mum’s looking after Fred right now.”
Potter had said something similar earlier, Draco recalled. Except this time…
The bushy-haired Gryffindor winced ever so slightly, and not even the dark brown of her skin could hide the blush furiously blooming on her face. As a matter of fact, Draco noted even through his bewilderment, she looked almost
Yaxley’s screams came to an abrupt stop, and the man was left panting and wheezing and whimpering on the dirty floor. His eyes were wide once more, only this time there was anger in them, anger and rage and…
“You’re supposed to protect me, right? And you can hardly do that if you’re distracted. So, spill.” When Draco remained silent, Harry grinned, and added, “I distinctly remember you promising me only yesterday that you’d talk to me more. So, here’s your chance. Talk.”
Point was, the closed door blocking Harry from the stupid Slytherin prat seemed a lot thicker than it should, a lot more definitive, and he found himself oddly on edge just standing there, waiting, hands itching to reach up.
And Harry didn’t even take offense at that less-than-desirable comparison, because Draco had called him
He rolled his eyes again, crossing his arms. “And that’s why you’ve decided to make a surprise trip to London, is it? Because you’ve missed me so?”
Harry’s eyes went wide, and even Draco seemed to forget his anger for a split-second.
Or settle things once and for all, depending on one’s standpoint.

to meet you. There’s absolutely no need to worry, we’ll have you back on your feet in no time!”
However, the Gryffindor didn’t rise to the bait, and Draco was left feeling both mildly disappointed and…unnerved. Yes, definitely unnerved.
Again, I’m sorry this chapter turned out so long, there was just a lot a lot to fit into it, as you have now witnessed first-hand.
Ron and Hermione had been basically living in his hospital room for the past three days, so when the Weasleys had all gone back to the Burrow, Harry had talked them into going, too. He was glad when they’d finally agreed; they deserved some peace and quiet after all the stress of the last couple of days.
thoughts had infiltrated Harry’s brain. Because Harry knew, and that was more than enough.
Hello my lovely readers!
Harry was surprised once again when neither Malfoy’s snooty sneer nor haughty tone triggered the usual wave of anger. But, no. The schoolboy rivalry, the insults, the sneers, that was all strictly in the past. They were both capable, responsible adults now.
Harry finally blinked and averted his gaze, feeling his face flush but unable—and, maybe, just maybe, unwilling—to pinpoint exactly why. “Err, sorry, can you…?”
Draco folded his arms as well, tilting his head to the side ever so slightly. “
Granted, the Gryffindor-ness of it all
. It felt like someone with very sharp claws had shredded his abdomen, ripped out all his intestines, trampled over him, danced an Irish jig or two, and then went on their merry way. Harry might have wondered if this was what death felt like, were it not for the fact that he knew perfectly well what death looked and felt like, thank you very much, and this sure as hell
. Is he doing here,” he gritted out, and it was then that Harry and Nic noticed his arrival and turned to look at him from where they stood by the kitchen door, no more than a foot or two of space between them.
“Right then,” said Draco, having had enough of this. A perfectly good flat was waiting for them, where it only took one quick locking of the Floo and they’d be safe from unwanted company for as long as they liked. “We’d best get going now. Surely you have…
No, not just affection. Not anymore. Not when all Harry wanted was
Yet that relief was muffled by the sheer trepidation he hadn’t been able to shake since Weasley had crashed out of the fireplace a wide-eyed, dishevelled mess, and burst out without preamble of any kind ‘Yaxley’s gone!’. A tension deep within Draco, a fear, one that had admittedly been mollified at the sight of Harry safe and sound and without so much as a scratch on him.
He frowned. Nothing.
Except, Harry was fairly confident Draco Malfoy did not, in fact, hate him, and that knowledge brought a large smile to his face even as he pushed the heavy coffee table up against the wall.
“We need to know what happened to properly attend to him,” hissed Healer Preedan. “Not to mention, the
“Oh, stop being so pessimistic,” the Gryffindor said with another flash of perfectly white teeth, and Draco gently set down his own chocolate éclair. After all, if he was going to make sure Yaxley didn’t murder Harry today, it’d do no one any good if he accidentally choked to death because his soulmate was just too bloody gorgeous.
circumstances. You
“Draco didn’t—” Blaise began immediately, ever the loyal friend, and even Weasley started, “Ginny…”
“So what,” he said, and he couldn’t hold back the cold anger seeing into his tone, “you came here just to insult Draco and me?”
Harry inhaled deep, willing his heart to stop pounding like crazy. He needed to think, to somehow formulate a plan that’d get him out of this alive. Right now, Nic had him cornered, and his wand remained on the other side of the alleyway. The only two options he had were either an unreliable attempt at wandless magic, or just full-out tackling the man and hoping for the best.
left her soulmate. And Draco—
He didn’t know who he’d expected to see; perhaps some poor, unassuming nurse on her way to see a patient, or an exhausted Trainee Healer running on nothing but caffeine and the alluring promise of (eventual) sleep. But it was neither of those two options that stood on the other side of the corridor, eyebrows raised sky-high, eyes wide.
Draco turned to look at him, too. “Harry,” he said slowly. “They’re
“Not to mention,” added Blaise, “Mr. Potter should be resting, anyway. After he and Auror Malfoy have their talk, there’s no need to bother him with any further questions. We should let him sleep the day’s stress off. It’s the responsible thing to do at a time like this.”
Draco didn’t like violence, never had, never would, especially not after all he’d seen first-hand during the war. He didn’t like hurting people and he certainly didn’t like having to kill. It was one of the only qualms he’d had about becoming an Auror—he still had nightmares sometimes, even three years later, of screaming and crying and begging echoing through the Manor’s halls, of Bellatrix’s manic cackling or Voldemort’s cold laugh before a flash of green.
“What
“What the—” came Nic’s startled voice, and Harry could only echo that sentiment. He’d heard of the idiom ‘speak of the devil’ before, but never in his life had he seen it implemented so very literally.

complaining about your décor is bad? Pansy’s set on becoming an actual fashion designer. Forget the murderer, she’d kill you herself for this atrocious array of eyesores.”
The Gryffindor’s eyebrows shot sky-high, and he crossed his arms, coming to a complete stop as he turned to face Draco. “Oh
Luna giggled. “Oh,
“Smith!” Draco shouted, the loudest noise he had made in months. The boy finally looked at him. “Pomfrey. Now.” He nodded once, turning and scurrying away.
The blood that trickled steadily from the gash on Harry’s temple was forming a dark halo beneath his head. Draco crawled over to him, heart drumming a tattoo against his Adam’s apple. He leaned over Harry, pressing his hand to the wound in a meager attempt to quell the bleeding.
Luna glanced up, saw him standing there, and smiled vaguely. She looked back to Harry and brushed a sweaty lock of hair behind his ear. She leaned closer and whispered in his ear, one hand on his lower back. Draco bristled and walked over quickly.
Kingsley turned his gaze, for the first time, to the Malfoys. “And you, Draco and Narcissa Malfoy? Do you accept these terms? You may, of course, refuse, and serve your original sentences in Azkaban if you’d prefer.”
Narcissa was watching them with a bemused smile. “Now, boys,” she said, gently chiding. “I’m quite tired, I think I shall head to bed. Please do try not to bicker for much longer, I think a good night’s sleep would serve us all well.”
The first month back had been bizarre. He had not only to cope with the new living situation, in which all returning eighth years had been placed together in one dormitory regardless of house, but he had to do it without Ron and Hermione for the first time ever. Harry kept mostly to himself in those early days, since a great majority of his friends had opted not to return. Then, one day when he was sitting in the eighth year common room working on a Charms paper, Luna Lovegood had situated herself beside him on the couch and began talking to him in that dreamy voice as though they had already been in the middle of a conversation. He still missed Ron and Hermione, of course, but Luna turned out to be very good company, and he quickly grew to love her.
Harry had his eyes opened just the smallest, most imperceptible fraction, just enough to make out the small crowd gathering before the Dark Lord. It was all he could do not to let out an audible sigh of relief when he saw Draco, Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Ginny standing at the front of the group. Alive. They were all still alive..
Had he made a terrible mistake? Would he be able to manage two years living with Draco, and five with Narcissa? Would they hold Lucius’ sentence against him? Would his home become a place he dreaded going at the end of each day? Harry had always been impulsive to some degree, but thought that this was probably the most reckless decision he had ever made.
“Harry,” Narcissa said gently, placing a hand on his arm. “Please look at me.” Harry forced his gaze up, and her ice blue eyes were warm and happy. “You have done us a great service, bringing us here. Trust me when I tell you that even on this home’s worst day, I would have my son here over Azkaban in a heartbeat. Draco and I will be glad to help you clean it up.”
It had been a long time coming. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had let himself feel so completely, and he found that once he started, he couldn’t stop. He cried for Colin Creevey, the heroic little boy who had only wanted to help. For Fred, who would never again light up the world with his laughter and pranks, and for George, who had lost a part of himself when he lost his twin. For Tonks and Lupin, who had only just become parents, and Teddy, who would grow up without a mother and father. Even for Severus Snape, whom he had so loathed, but who had loved his mother so deeply that he had protected and guided her child for seventeen long years after she had gone. And he cried for Draco Malfoy, the proud boy who had offered his hand in friendship when he was eleven and had been rebuffed for possibly the first time in his life. The boy who grew up in a stifling environment with toxic belief systems. The boy who made all the wrong choices.
Draco looked as stricken as Harry felt. He swallowed thickly and turned his gaze out to the quiet grounds once more.
The other boy shot straight up in bed so abruptly and looked so alarmed that Draco actually glanced about the room to see what had happened. Harry’s green eyes were wide and fixed on his chest. He looked down and groaned, remembering that he had foregone a shirt the night before in the warm room. “Don’t make a thing of this,” he pleaded, though he knew it was useless when the blood drained from Harry’s face.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment, caught off guard. Harry must have been speaking of Luna, but his eyes remained fixed on Draco. Draco felt as though he were being tested, but for what, he wasn’t sure. His gaze flickered to Luna, whose plaited hair glowed golden in the firelight. Her flawless skin, her delicate features that belied the fierceness of the girl within. Draco felt a surge of protectiveness and affection wash over him.
“I don’t know how she can stand to look at me,” Draco whispered, throat tight. “After what happened. I must remind her of the worst thing that has ever happened to her. How can she stand to be near me?”
thing I have ever done.” Harry’s eyes were blazing. Draco heard, as if from a great distance, the sound of the candelabra on his nightstand clatter to the ground.
“Harry, can you tell us what happened?” McGonagall looked worried, and Draco thought perhaps a bit alarmed.
Draco glanced over and was unsurprised to find Harry’s gaze fixed on him rather than Snape, who was vanishing the potion with a wave of his wand. He looked quickly back to his own potion, which was rather lighter than it was meant to be. He sighed in frustration and set about trying to figure out what he had done wrong. It was nearly impossible to focus during class when Harry Potter was trying to burn a hole in the back of his head with his relentless gaze. The prat had spent the entire year thus far watching Draco, no doubt convinced he was planning something nefarious.
“Potter,” Draco snarled, whirling around and swiping at his eyes furiously. “What do you want?”
of time to figure it out. A whole lifetime, I imagine.”
Harry forced himself to walk down the stairs to the Hogwarts entrance for what he now knew would be the last time. Ron, Hermione, and Draco stood together on the stairs, filthy and exhausted, but flushed with their victory over Nagini.
Harry’s jaw snapped shut with an audible click and he stared off, embarrassed, into a corner of the room.
“But… you still sleep in here,” Draco looked skeptical. “Don’t you still get ill when we’re apart?”
Harry ran his hands through his already unruly hair. “Well. I’m going to sound a bit of a prat but-”
Narcissa smiled, but she looked vaguely troubled. “Yes, that’s right. I’ve been to this house only once, when I was a girl.”
Draco’s face betrayed him then, shock and disbelief, and maybe a bit of hope, plain on his pointed features. “Why would you do that for me?”
Draco nodded and swallowed hard. He stared at it in Harry’s outstretched hand as if he were a starving man and Harry was offering him food. Though it must have pained him to do so, he shook his head. “You keep it, Potter. They’ll only take it away from me.”
They tumbled together out of the Room of Requirement, joining Ron and Hermione in the hallway. Ron quickly tossed the remains of the diadem into the fiendfyre behind them as Crabbe and Goyle took off without so much as a word of thanks.
When he entered the dining room with their sixth course, a treacle tart that smelled absolutely heavenly, Harry laughed. “Kreacher, we’ll be eating leftovers for a week, at least.”
Draco seemed momentarily stunned out of his grief. Harry suspected he had never had friends so fiercely loyal.
“A life debt is a very serious and tricky bit of magic,” Snape continued, looking even more tense and surly than he usually did. “It is not completely understood by even the most learned of wizards. I have a suspicion of what may have transpired, but first, I must ask you to tell us what happened in that corridor before Smith brought Madame Pomfrey to you.”
