“Absolutely, and I’m not letting you out of bed for the duration except for trips to the loo. I have two words for you, Harry. Room service.”
That didn’t stop his mind from betraying him on a regular basis by doing things like offering up delightful commentary on how good Harry looked in his Auror robes or reminding him how warm that familiar lopsided grin was when directed at Draco, the one that was reserved for his friends and reached all the way to his eyes in a way those wider and more patented smiles for the general public did not. Draco’s breath hitched as an image flashed through his mind, one like many he’d had before but usually only entertained in the privacy of his bedroom at night.
“Take those off, and get up here before I start without you.”
“That’s it, Draco. Just like that, you’re so good. Hnn.. fuck, I’m so close. Just a little m-more, and uh, I’m gonna come all over you. Make you mine, yeah? Would you like that, Draco? My come on you? Not gonna let you use a cleaning charm after. Everyone’s gonna know you’re mine.”
Harry had removed his fingers part of the way through Draco’s rant and replaced them with his cock, positioning the head at his entrance and pushing insistently past the tight ring of muscle, causing Draco to devolve into wordless gasping as he sank deeper into him. It didn’t take long for the blond to come back to himself enough to take over, however, and soon he was placing his palms flat against Harry’s chest to give himself the leverage to start riding him in earnest.
Draco looked at him like he’d lost his mind, but Harry was already crossing the room to his own desk, grabbing the letter from George and opening it to give it a more thorough read before explaining that the chocolates were laced with an aphrodisiac and that, “—it says here that it’s not coercive. It just feeds off the feelings you already..” Harry looked up from the letter to meet Draco’s gaze as the truth hit him full force “have.”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. This was it; this was the moment. He had to tell him, but how would Draco react? Would he be happy? Would he be mad that Harry hadn’t said something sooner? Some of the panic must have shown in his expression because the next thing he knew, Draco was pulling him down onto the bed beside him and wrapping Harry up in strong arms, one hand cupping the back of his neck and cradling it gently as he urged him to rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, hugging him back tightly and trying to take deep breaths to calm himself. His voice was a bit muffled as a result, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to look up yet.
now we’re engaged, we’ll be one of those boring old married couples who feed each other sausage rolls.” They looked at Ron and Hermione, who was perched on her husband's knee and had a container of picnic food in her lap as they chatted to Seamus and Dean.
, don't remind me,” Ginny said with a rather dramatic- and frankly insulting- retch, “I prefer
“Stop looking at me like that, you’re making me want to kiss you again, and I think we need to give these poor sods a break.”
Harry chuckled, leaning down to kiss him. Draco curled both arms around Harry’s neck, making a small noise of satisfaction as he reciprocated eagerly.
", and another, to the other side, before trailing his lips across his jaw. Draco tilted his neck, giving Harry access, who peppered more tiny kisses down it, each one containing a silent plea.
“Yes, I’m serious, you daft git. But you have to promise me.”
Snorting, Harry gripped him tighter to keep him from collapsing as he cast the subtle charm over Draco’s groin, rubbing his back in gentle circles when he shuddered from the instantaneous effect.
“Well, there fucking
Force of habit, nothing more.
Trailing off- and with a sudden urge to pop to M&S- he stood up, planting a kiss on Draco’s head and laughing to himself as he was dismissed by an absentminded hand, Draco once again transfixed by the screen- and bugs- in front of him.
"So we're ok?"
, Harry.”
, you should have bought me some decent clothing.”
”Ok, ok. I’ll round everyone up, and we’ll apparate to the usual spot, yes?”
“Yeah?”
Why didn’t you tell me?!” She squealed, letting him go to punch him on the arm.
“Is that a yes?”
Hermione snorted, before promptly dissolving into more tears. "Oh, gosh, I don't- I don't know what's
“Yes, I’ll think about it. But I’m not making any promises.”
“That doesn’t mean I want the rest of the bloody world to see you
“Well, he must have a pretty impressive-“
“I’m pretty sure I passed out.”
- yet all of those things paled in comparison to how terrifying the task ahead of him felt.
, Ron- oh, Harry, I'm so
“You’ll let me see it, right?”
“Sorry?”
Harry nodded, running a hand through his hair.
“Harry- oh fuck, Harry, please-”
“I’m not telling you!”
“Yes, ok, we
” Draco gushed, beaming as he glanced back through the wards. “I’ve never felt so...Merlin, I don’t even know. Exhilarated? Happy? I didn’t expect it to be like this at all- why the fuck didn’t you bring me sooner?”
“I’m so very happy for you, Harry,” Luna said, appearing at his side, her face lit up with a gentle kind of happiness only she could radiate. “Your engagement is the second best thing to happen this week, isn’t it, love?” She stood on her tiptoes to kiss Harry on the cheek as Ginny released him with one last squeeze, wiping away what he assumed was pink face paint with her thumb.
“Got it bad today, huh?” She said with a grin and he scowled, eyes back on Draco. "Blimey, I’m gutted I’m the only one here who hasn’t seen him with his kit off, if this is the reaction he gets with it still
“No, he thinks you’re hiding something.”
Head spinning, he planted his feet more firmly on the ground, arm thrown out to steady himself against the kitchen island. There was no counter spell he could cast, but he willed himself to ignore it, knowing he just needed to get out of the room- some fresh air and a glass of water would help, as long as he avoided Draco at all costs. Simple.
- in 1939, so really quite recent. Isn’t it funny, how often I used to watch that growing up, yet still had no idea I—”
. I hope you know what you’ve gotten yourself into.’
The look on Ron’s face suggested he wasn’t joking in the slightest.
Harry, on the other hand…well, he’d been so busy trying not to die for seventeen years that he hadn’t given marriage much of a thought, and even when he had it had seemed so wildly unattainable that he’d brushed it off as a passing notion. A pipe dream. Something normal people do, not people who have to break up with their girlfriends so they can run off to win a war.
Harry laughed, tilting his chin up to kiss him gently. “I’m so happy you’re here.”
! That’s
he wouldn't let him get away with such a request without torturing him first- he’d entered with absolutely nothing else on.
“I’m not letting you twirl me, Potter. Don’t push your luck.”
“Oh, yeah, I’m fine,” he insisted, rolling his eyes at Ron’s look of disbelief. "Really, Ron, it’s ok. I didn’t even realise he was here.”
“You’re thinking too hard again- just say what comes to mind. Tell him how you feel. Tell him what you told me five minutes ago!”
“Draco,” he murmured groggily, breathing heavily through his nose, “what the fuck are you doing?”
“You want me to leave it on?”
Fuck.
brilliant outcome.
- Draco was coming to Pride, and not just ‘in spirit’ like usual; he’d confirmed (somewhat begrudgingly) the night before that he ‘
“I don’t like what this is insinuating, by the way,” he said suddenly, looking back at Harry, “I’m getting you a ring too.”
Draco gaped at her in shock, watching them all for a second before twisting round to stare at Harry, hand gripping his leg.
, are you even- oh, you fucker.“ Draco scowled when Harry sniggered, kissing him again.
Harry cursed under his breath, feeling ridiculous- despite his efforts, Ron was just as appalling when it came to
Ron’s eyes widened as he gaped at something over Harry’s shoulder, who spun to see what had rendered him speechless.
” Harry said loudly, covering his ears with a grimace, “point taken, you can stop.”
Ron tutted, sounding very much like Hermione.“You- never mind. That’s not what I meant, anway.”
“I’m not freaking out, I’m just…fuck.
child, I’d be worried. Bloody handsome Muggles.” He looked Harry up and down, Hermione’s snort of laughter going unnoticed, his extra fury brows furrowed. “So where’s your cape then?”
“Uh…”
Harry had been trying- and failing- to convince Draco to attend London Pride with him and the rest of their friends for almost seven years, and every year fell short of changing his mind. He'd been forced to wave his flag all alone, watching as his loved-up friends celebrated together while
“Isn’t that Pansy twirling Hermione over there? By that lamp post?”

“We compromised with the green…Muggles
"Yes, fuck yes, rightthereHarry
the lengthy split up her thigh, but because her pale, freckled skin had been charmed a shockingly lurid green.
“I’ve bought you something,” he said and Draco raised an eyebrow, blowing on his glittery nails.
Harry laughed, whether from relief or joy he didn’t know, eyes blurry as he tried to keep his own hand steady and not drop the ring down the drain. He slid it perfectly onto Draco’s finger, throat burning at the small choked sound Draco made, unable to tear his eyes away from Draco’s hand. As soon as it was on, Draco broke out of his grasp and flung his arms around Harry’s neck, laughing and crying and clutching at Harry so tightly he felt like his whole entire world had been reduced to just the two of them. The urge to start shouting with glee at the top of his lungs was so overwhelming that all he could do was pull back and kiss Draco, ignoring the cheers and whistles from their friends, his lips salty with tears he wasn’t sure were Draco’s or his own.
Thick cobwebs had been draped over every bookshelf, small tables laden with flickering pumpkins, the ceiling swirling with dark, enchanted storm clouds. Red candles cast a low, warm glow over the room and its occupants, who swarmed in front of him, a colourful sea of unidentifiable people. The air buzzed with sound; guests were drinking, laughing, dancing (although that was just one woman, her leaf-tangled blonde hair sweeping the floor as she spun), their identities obscured by scarily realistic, magically enhanced costumes.
?” Harry replied, looking at Ron, who turned bright red and began to choke on his water.
“- Harry- hey, Harry-
Harry laughed, pulling her into a tight hug.
“It’s actually very interesting,” she began loudly, and Ron groaned, burying his face in his hand (or, paws). “Theories date all the way back to fourth-century China, where the hats were supposedly first discovered, but the green originated from The Wizard of Oz-
“Do you?”
“No, you idiot,” Harry laughed, “I just mean...here.” He gestured around, pulling Draco closer as a large group of people pushed past them, screaming an awful rendition of a song he didn’t recognise.
“Twat. I was being serious.”
Harry huffed as Draco raised his eyebrows expectantly, holding his gaze for a couple of seconds before grudgingly relenting and retracting his hands.
He broke the kiss, gazing at Harry slightly dazed, before glancing down. “Oh. Your hero cock didn’t come.”
“Oh, hello Harry! It’s lovely to see you,” she said, smiling serenely, “what an
“Distract me from what?”
—————————————————————————————
“Whenever you’re ready, then,” Draco panted, interrupting Harry’s inner thoughts as he rutted his cock against thin air, “it’s not like you to take so bloody long—”
Harry sighed, staring beseechingly at Draco’s back as he dropped a tea bag into his mug.
Dropping the plate he was washing, Harry grabbed his wand off the kitchen table and dashed into the front room, stomach dropping at the terror in Draco’s voice.

“- too soon?”
Harry grasped his waist to hold him steady as his feet touched the ground, wobbling slightly.
“Hermione, stop fretting,” Harry laughed, squeezing her shoulders. “You do this every year, and we’re always fine.”
planned?”
, which after a couple of years became so tedious they’d decided it best to give themselves a bit of space to enjoy the celebrations without having to worry about any slip ups. While not entirely legal, they weren’t doing any harm, and the odd Muggle-repeller here and there was much less risky than having to explain where Seamus had conjured an entire roast turkey from.
“Fucking hell, I’ll personally be avoiding the both of you until the big day- you’re going to be unbearable.”
Making a mental note to buy the record, Harry grinned at a zombie who was stood near the punch bowl chatting to a bloodstained, red-headed priest-
Draco rolled his eyes when Harry grinned, flapping a hand in his face.
“Expensive?”
I was fine—”
“Sorry, mate, sorry, but...blimey. This is
strange, aren’t they? The only green witch I’ve ever met was Gwen, and that’s because she ate a dodgy sausage sandwich ten minutes before a game, and there was
Slytherins are terrible voyeurs.”
“Potter, will you hurry
“I thought I was getting my present afterwards?”
Draco spun them to an abrupt stop, sliding his arms around Harry’s neck, drawing them close together. Sliding a long, heeled leg between Harry’s, he began to undulate slowly in time to the music, light fingers playing with the hair at Harry’s nape.
“A Snidget nest, Harry. They’re very rare birds, and a symbol of great fortune. Oh! That’s good news for your upcoming nuptials, how wonderful.”
Harry scoffed, dropping into the seat next to him. “No, that colour doesn’t wash you out and yes, you absolutely are. Did you shrink these?” He asked, adjusting himself through the ridiculously tight jeans Draco had picked.
“Don’t say anything, alright? He doesn’t have a clue. At least I hope he doesn’t.”
————————————————————————————
Trust Draco to bloody curse him the first time they’d been in the same room together since…well, since the day he moved back into the Manor, Harry supposed...although it
Harry decided to let the hero comment slide, instantly distracted by Draco’s firm, slow stroke. He moaned as Draco adjusted his grip, fingers now curled around them both, and slipped a hand beneath Draco’s thigh to hook it around his waist, restricted slightly by the tight leather that still clung to him.
“I wouldn’t say no,” Dean retorted, grasping Seamus’ chin to kiss him soundly as Harry dropped down onto the grass beside them, tugging Draco down to sit between his legs.
Wanted to see the eyes he’d missed so much.
. It’s been nearly seven years, babe, and I want to celebrate
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, pressing a light kiss to Draco's lips. To his surprise, Draco slid a hand around his neck and pulled him back in for a deeper kiss, sliding his tongue into Harry’s mouth with a soft moan. Harry’s cock twitched embarrassingly, the press of Draco’s…well, everything…through the extremely thin material of his shorts frustratingly tempting. Pulling back with a wet smack, Draco grinned cheekily, winking at someone over Harry’s shoulder.
The steady, sultry music rose to a crescendo, where it broke, as did Harry’s restraint. Releasing a hand from Draco's waist, he slid it into his hair, tugging his head far enough back so that he could smash their lips together. Harry heard Draco groan as he thrust his tongue inelegantly between his plump, glossy lips, and Draco surged against him, kissing back with just as much force. In retaliation, he bit down, feeling Draco’s bottom lip crunch under his teeth.
Draco blinked.
After patting Harry on the shoulder, she led Ginny away, leaving him to round on his baffled- but somehow still smug- boyfriend.
He stepped back, summoning his wand and handing it to Harry, who stuffed it into his back pocket with his own. He slipped his hand into Draco’s, squeezing lightly before disapparating them both with a loud crack.
His whole body lit up, nerve endings on fire, cock instantly, painfully hard. The force of it propelled him backwards, arse colliding with the counter behind him, all the air leaving his lungs at once. His skin
“Eugh,
Draco sighed again, lowering himself onto Harry’s lap, careful not to spill his tea.
“I think Harry just wants you all to himself, which we understand,” Luna said with a smile, pulling Ginny’s hand into her own. “Come on, honey, I want Pansy to paint my face before we leave.”
“I’m happy to be here.”
“What? What is it? What’s wrong?” He shouted, eyes darting around the room frantically before landing on Draco, who was sat on the sofa with his arms wrapped around his knees.
And another.
“I think you mean
“You’re the
Harry hummed in agreement and Draco smiled again- wide and bright and so, so perfect that a part of Harry wished he wouldn’t so he could remember how to breathe.

“If you stop whining, I might show you the first page, but I’m not making any promises.”
Harry’s argument was cut off as Draco kissed him, soft and sweet.
, you’re
“Yes! I mean yeah, yes, everything’s fine. I’m glad you’re having fun- what were you and Luna shouting about?”
He heard someone gasp as he opened the ring box but couldn’t take his eyes from Draco, who was still stood happily watching the parade and oblivious to the commotion happening all around him.
“To think that while
Draco groaned, head rising to stare at him through the mirror in front as he fucked himself on Harry’s fingers. “I don’t…
“There’s nothing I can do to convince you? Not at all?”
Harry, biting his lip to hide an amused smile, paused.
Draco’s eyes softened and he twisted around to place his mug on the table, turning back to cup Harry’s face and kiss him softly.
, why do I miss you so much? God, it hurts just to look at you, to see you out there, especially when you look so good, my brain wants to fucking explode because I know you’re here alone, rather than with me, and I swear to God, Draco, I didn’t feel like that before I saw you tonight—”
Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “I- yes?”
.” He punctuated his words with a hard press against Draco’s prostate, earning a sharp cry from him. Harry leant forward, bracing himself against the sink, his other arm pumping so quickly Draco’s arse began to lift.
Ron looked like a deer caught in headlights and Harry’s neck began to burn, neither of them saying a word as they stared at one another and then back at Draco, silently willing the other to speak. When Ron began to splutter uselessly, Harry turned his back on him and gave Draco what he hoped was a reassuring smile, kissing him on the cheek.
Harry grinned triumphantly, taking that as a
Harry laughed, bumping her with his elbow. “Idiot,” he said, grinning when she elbowed him back. “I thought you were being serious.”

He snorted, picturing Draco with a mixing bowl full of bugs. “Ooo, some lovely beetle biscuits, or a

“Yeah, I know,” he said, dropping a brief kiss to the top of her head. “I think we did fucking fantastic. It’s crazy, really, isn’t it?”
“You’re serious? You’re not messing around?”
“Yeah?”
“Then why have you got that look on your face?”
“Yes.”
Ron trailed off and Harry could feel his eyes on the back of his head as he scanned the room, finally landing on Draco, who was leaning casually against the mantlepiece. As if he could feel Harry's eyes on him, his head jerked up and Harry looked away quickly, cheeks heating.
With a rough growl, he pinned Draco against the vanity, ignoring his yelp of surprise,
“Harry, I’ve never…” he gasped, stumbling into Harry’s side when he stopped walking to let Draco take it all in. He slipped his arm around Draco’s waist, kissing him on the cheek as Draco turned his head to look behind them.
‘For what? Getting my cock out with Draco?”
“Yeah, sorry about that. I don’t know, mate, it’s just good to see you happy. That might be the glittery shorts, mind, but I’m glad all the same.”
“Draco, sweetheart, we’re not alone right now.“
He kept his gaze steady on Draco as he took another sip of water; the way his face lit up with laughter at something someone said, his glitter-dusted skin shimmering every time he moved, his long legs bare and milky pale and so soft and God, Harry just wanted to sink his teeth into-
Draco grinned, smoothing his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip. “Quite right. So what is my present?”
“It’s just a Muggle entertainment show, Draco, they-”
“It’s a sticker, babe, look,” Harry chuckled, taking it from him, carefully peeling it from the backing paper and holding it out on one finger. “Where do you want it?”
“Shut up, I am
sorry” he chuckled, giving Draco another- very brief- kiss, which he reciprocated without complaint. “Are you feeling ok?”
Draco’s hands moved up and over Harry’s shoulders to bury in his hair, and fuck if that didn’t feel divine, and
“Oh, no, Draco, that’s fine, I can just-”
“If I’d known my attendance would get me one of those, I’d have agreed years ago. Was that my present?”
“I’m getting
Harry grinned, opening his mouth to ruin Ron’s day when he cut in with a groan of disgust.
He knew Draco had waited his whole life for this, had been preparing for his wedding since before he could walk, had given up all hope of it ever happening after the war because he didn’t think anyone would- or could- ever love him enough.
“We don’t have room for a big one,” Draco said with a scoff, but Harry could tell his defences were beginning to crumble.
, gorgeous.”
He kissed Harry lightly on the cheek, giving his arm a little squeeze.
“Not a thing.”
were the ones who were forced into hiding? When Muggles are out here, eating bugs and...and...
He stopped speaking when Ron coughed pointedly, lowering his voice. "Do you have any idea how fucking hot you look?”
you there, it’s not that I
To Harry’s surprise, Draco blushed, eyes panicked as he looked at Harry before glaring up at Blaise.
“H-harry, fuck! It’s good.. so good. Like your mouth was made for my cock. I’m going to come, and you’re going to take all of it, aren’t you?”
bicep with one hand, the other cupping his cheek, thumb sliding along the curve of his cheekbone in a mindless caress. He’d never be just Potter to Draco ever again. His voice softened, concern taking over from incredulity in an instant at any sign of distress from his bonded.
Harry chuckled lowly and peered up at him, leaning back on his hands and tilting his head up to properly meet Draco’s gaze. The moon was out and very nearly full, casting enough light to make out the contours of the other man’s face. He gave a little shrug of his shoulders along with his reply.
He halted mid-sentence when Draco held up a hand and flushed a dull red as he met his gaze, licking his lips nervously as he waited for his response. The blond had ceased attempting to dry his hair while listening to Harry’s rambling apology, and the scowl was also gone from his face, now replaced with a look that was half exasperated, half fond.
“Merlin, you’re amazing at that. Come here.”
Draco sighed and dutifully answered Toussaint’s instead.
“They’re Hermione’s favorite I’ll have you know. There’s nothing wrong with shortbread. You’re such a snob, Malfoy.”
Gritting his teeth against a groan, Harry gripped Draco’s hips and rocked with him, unable to tear his eyes away from the sight of Draco, skin slick with sweat, his hair for once wild and unkempt. He watched the smooth line of Draco’s throat move as the blond threw back his head, babbling mindlessly as he moved atop Harry, every line of his body taut with tension as he sought his release.
Fuck me, want you to fuck me, Harry. Please..”
Harry woke up to the sound of the shower running. Blinking blearily, he groaned and sat up, stretching his back and rolling his neck to work the kinks out of it. Looking longingly at his pillows piled behind him, he contemplated just rolling over and going back to sleep, but he knew he wasn’t going to. He’d spent enough time yesterday being avoidant. No, he was going to apologize to Draco this morning, no matter how much the thought made his stomach heave with nerves. Shaking his head at himself, he got up and made a half-hearted attempt at making himself presentable without access to the bathroom, gave it up as a bad job, and flopped back down onto his bed to wait for Draco.
Harry barked a laugh as he grabbed a towel and moved past Draco toward the loo, talking over his shoulder as he went.
“I didn’t realize.. couldn’t have imagined you wanting me back. Gods, Harry, if you don’t touch me soon I think I might go mad!”
He heard a soft intake of breath not his own, almost a gasp, perhaps, of pain quickly stifled, and then he was moving before he was even fully aware of what he was doing, driven by an instinct so strong it might as well have been automatic. Draco couldn’t have stopped himself had he wanted to. His hands dropped away from his face, as he moved forward to grasp Potter’s.. No,
He finally pulled back and yanked his joggers down on one side, not all the way, just enough to bare his soulmark for Draco’s perusal. Draco went very still then, his gaze riveted to the mark on Harry’s hip, and it was a moment before he reached slender fingers out to trace the letters slowly, touch lingering a bit longer than strictly necessary before withdrawing. Harry’s expression turned bewildered as a choked laugh escaped Draco, but the blond was shaking his head, already opening his mouth to explain.
Severus sighed. This was going to be harder than he thought. Harry was afraid to do anything, speak or eat without permission. He thought back to the circumstances that would cause a 6 year old to act that way and felt another surge of hatred for Lily's sister. How could someone do that to an innocent child.
A little while later, Narcissa and Severus came up to Draco's room. They could have sent one of the house elves,  but they wanted to see how the boys were doing. As they got close to the door, they could hear the boys giggling together. The adults stepped in the room to find Harry and Draco sitting on the floor. Harry was absolutely covered in tiny figurines, who were all cuddling up to Harry. Draco was picking up the tiny toys that wouldn't fit on Harry and exchanging them for ones that were on top of him. As soon as the toys were separated from Harry, they went back to acting like the original spell had designated.
Late the following morning, Severus looked at Harry's head in dismay. He hadn't thought about it the past few days, but Harry's hair was AWFUL. No matter what Severus did, it stuck out in every direction as if Harry had been crawling through bushes. Severus sighed.
“Of course! We would be delighted! Can we plan for around one?” Severus nodded, and bid Narcissa good evening. Severus sat back on one of the wing back chairs and called for Tippy to bring him a glass of his favorite wine. It had been a long day, and now that Harry was starting to get a little comfortable Severus was starting to worry. He was worrying about everything. The Dark Lord returning, Harry and Draco's impending introductions, Harry's recovery from his trauma.  Severus was starting to realized that part of being a parent was going to be worrying to the point of exhaustion.
“Father, why did you stop?” Severus shook his head.
“I was there when he was born! He’s part of me! Please, Severus, don’t keep me from him!” she could hear Remus pleading with Severus.
“A little bit like that. But more like… if you met your cousin when you were an adult, would you still think that he was spoiled and a bully?” Harry nodded, making a face. He was getting better about talking about the Dursley’s, but he still disliked it when they were brought up.
“Master Snape!” Tippy called him quietly from the door of Harry's room. Severus ran to the door, worried that Harry was hurt. Severus looked around the room, but didn't see him. He looked back at Tippy, who gestured towards the wardrobe. As Severus moved closer towards the wardrobe, he heard a muffled sob coming from inside. Severus's heart broke, hearing Harry cry like that. But this time, he knew he could help.
“I think that's perfect.” Severus went back to reading until he was sure that Harry was sleeping. He marked a page back, just to make sure that Harry didn't miss too much of the story, and placed the book on top of the bookshelf. He turned the light off and left the room, closing the door save for a few inches in case Shadow wanted to wander.  He made his way over to the Floo and threw in some powder.
Albus had advised that Harry hadn’t been happy or thriving with his Muggle relatives, and that was why Albus had Severus fetch him and bring him to Hogwarts. He had stated that Harry was fine, and a perfect example of a child his age. But Madam Pomfrey, on the other hand, had a very different story to tell.
“Absolutely.” Severus placed his hand on Harry's shoulder so that Harry could continue to stroke his new toy, and realized that Harry wouldn't pick out other toys for himself. He thought that they were only getting the one. He realized that he would get the chance to get all the things that he had wanted as a kid at one point in time, and began to head towards the books to start. He wanted to get books that Harry could read on his own, but also books that they could read together.
“Hey, let's go set your things up in your room.” Harry and Severus gathered up the bags and took them into Harry's room. The books and games went onto the bookshelves, and most of the toys that Severus picked out went into a chest at the end of Harry's bed. The dragon figurine went on Harry's bedside table, and the large stuffed dragon went onto Harry's bed.
Albus looked up as the monitor device on Harry began to spin and shriek again. Not truly concerned that anything was wrong, Albus walked over to the fireplace and threw in a pinch of Floo powder. If he didn't have to go into the Muggle world he would rather not, and he had a pawn under his thumb that would be perfect for checking on the situation without getting involved.
Harry makes new friends, but they aren't what you are thinking.
“Father, what am I going to be learning at Draco's house tomorrow?” Severus set the book on the bookshelf.
Severus looked at the clock on the mantle. He knew it was time to head to lessons, but he didn't want to. He walked over to the bookshelves that lined the living room and pulled out three books. They were a little advanced for a 6 year old, but they had lots of pictures of animals and places around the world, and he hoped that they would keep Harry occupied for the afternoon. He grabbed a journal with blank pages and a box of colored pencils that he had received as a gift but never used. He brought them over to the table and set them in front of Harry with a pencil sharpener. Harry blinked at them and then up at Severus.
He missed him?
“What did you mean, then?”
“Hi.”
, like millions upon millions of tiny needles were puncturing his heart, a large fist crushing his lungs, making it near impossible to breathe. His hand dropped from Draco’s throat to his shoulder, desperate to hold onto him because fuck, he never wanted to let him go.
“What kind of present?”
rare- so no I did not spell them white. They are white. You can’t cast spells on clothes this expensive. Well, you probably would- but you shouldn’t.” He sighed dramatically, twisting in Harry’s arms so they were facing each other once again, before leaning in close, soft, pink lips just mere centimetres from Harry’s.
for twenty years.”
“In public?”
“You can do this!”
It was so ridiculous it was almost unbelievable, and maybe Harry wouldn’t, if his arms hadn’t been wrapped so tightly around Draco’s waist that there was no doubt it was really happening.
"Sorry, what?” Harry asked, gaze snapping to the hand waving in front of his face.
Wait.
, love,” he said, giving Ron a pointed look, “just…uh...discussing the parade.”
“Wait- let me-" he guided Draco’s free arm to the smooth surface behind them, sliding his own on top to hold him steady. With his other hand, he reached beneath the curve of Draco’s arse, easily sliding three fingers into his slick, swollen hole, wasting no time in finding his prostate and jabbing at it intently. Draco’s head dropped back, eyes drifting shut, trembling against Harry.
Clumsily, he shoved two fingers into Draco’s open mouth, who began sucking on them instinctively, cheeks hollowed, eyes shut. But Harry wanted to
“I know, gorgeous. Maybe next time don’t kiss me like your life is depending on it when we’re surrounded by so many people?”

It seemed he had a lot to think about, too.
"And we can do whatever we'd like?"
On cue, Ginny squeezed her way into the group, two glasses floating in her wake. She looked beautiful in a black, backless gown, it's dainty straps highlighting her exposed collarbones, silver beaded bracelets decorating her wrists. Harry did a double take: not because of the extremely low cut of her dress
Thankfully, Harry was saved from justifying his cape-less attire by the arrival of Luna, who'd drifted over from the dance floor. In addition to the lengthened, leaf-strewn hair he’d noticed a few minutes earlier, her ears had been transfigured so they were pointed at the tips, and she wore a gauzy white dress that brushed the tops of her bare feet. A string of what looked like sprouts dangled around her neck, which for once Harry thought complimented her outfit quite nicely.

if he wasn’t still completely and utterly in love- curse or no curse.
“What? Oh, the shorts. I mean, yeah, can you blame me?” Harry snorted, grinning at the look Ron gave him as he took a swig of his own water.
“Ginny is a lesbian, Harry,” Ron said seriously, as if he was presenting brand new information, and Harry rolled his eyes.
“The spell! Whatever spell, or curse, you’ve put on me, to make me- to make me feel like this, to make me
“So…no spell then? Not even a little one?”
He heard Ron retch dramatically.
“But Draco -“
“That- he- you-

“I…yes, I’m sure we would, but…you know how it is with Muggles, sweetheart, being…”
“It’s
Draco smiled fondly at him, smoothing his thumb over Harry’s cheek. “I know, gorgeous, and I love you for it, but no. While a large, non-magical parade of Muggles is not as appealing to me as you make it sound, it’s not what’s keeping me away. I just don’t want to go, ok?”
“Straight people? Never.”
“I get it, mate...Draco’s your Hermione.”
. When should I do it? Should I wait for-“
“Fine. After. I know what you’re like, and I’m not letting you sneak out of this one if I’m spending half my fortune on you.”
Fuck.

“Do you?”
“Something bad
“Hi,” Harry replied, stepping close enough that he could smell Draco’s coconut shampoo, gently brushing a knuckle across his glittery cheekbone. “You look...fuck. Breathtaking. More than.”
“- Bisexual, yeah. Although I’ve not been near a woman for nearly a decade, so I’m definitely out of practice.”
Draco, seemingly startled, shook his head. “I- what? What spell?”
“Are we

It was daft, really- all he’d done was ask Draco a question and put a ring on his finger. Nothing had changed since that morning, or a day prior, or the week previous.
with arousal, and the overwhelming impulse to yank his trousers down and have one off in the middle of the kitchen was so strong he had to shut his eyes, taking deep breaths to calm his racing heart.
Draco hummed, looking between Harry and Ron with a small, slightly suspicious smile. “If you say so. I’ll leave you to it, then, shall I? I only came over to check you were alright.”
Draco gave him a smug little smile, toying with the hem of Harry's t-shirt. “Don’t I always?”
“What is?”
Harry grinned, kissing him on the cheek. “Yeah, we can do that.”
later on- if I’m even wearing any, that is.” His teeth grazed Harry’s earlobe and he groaned quietly, hands tightening on Draco’s waist.
, Harry!” Ron cried, flinging his arm around Harry’s shoulders to yank him across the bench and into a tight hug. “Bloody brilliant, I can’t believe it!”
“Arse. Will you at least think about it?”
“Yes. If you don’t now, you never will.”
Yet, oddly, it was a good sort of terrifying- less ‘I might die’ and more 'this is the greatest decision of my life'. It felt good to be walking into something so scary, but with an outcome so brilliant the fear was almost unnecessary.

“A big one.”
And not only had Draco entered he room in hot pants, gliding down the stairs and through the open door like a fucking supermodel- because of

“That’s rather fitting for today, don’t you think?”
“Is, yes, but they’re not really a reflection of everyone, unfortunately. See those people over there?” He pointed to a group of wardens across the street, laughing together as they had their photo taken.” They’re keeping us safe, ok? And the Muggle police are here somewhere, so they will be too.”
not getting engaged," Ron said disbelievingly as Hermione sniffled, pulling a tissue from her pocket to dab at her eyes.
“Yeah.”
They lapsed into contented silence, relishing the afterglow, until Draco turned his head, pressing a kiss under Harry’s jaw. He shifted, fingers hooking through the belt loops in Harry’s now-ruined trousers, and Harry felt his eyes on him.
“- You can spare us the details,” Harry snorted and Blaise rolled his eyes.
“What are you thinking about?” Draco asked softly, breaking Harry’s train of thought as he twisted round to cup Harry’s face.
At least he would have blended in.
“Draco-“ Harry started, cut off instantly by Draco’s tongue in his mouth and forgetting whatever it was he’d been planning on saying. As Draco buried his ring-clad hands in Harry’s hair to angle his head for a deeper kiss he decided it didn’t matter anyway, not when Draco was kissing him so fiercely, not when they were
secret, he, uh-“
“You really think so?”
gay, thank you.”
Thrusting lightly- to Draco’s contentment, if the happy little hum was anything to go by- he gripped the sink behind Draco’s head, orgasm building rapidly. His arms shook from the self-control it was taking not to slam his hips forward, to fuck Draco’s mouth like he so desperately wanted to; instead he continued to roll his hips gently, watching, wide-eyed and slightly dizzy, as his cock disappeared in-between Draco’s reddened lips.
Draco took the mug back from him, eyes suddenly much sharper.
"Good?”
‘You. Always you.”
Snogging.
?” He hissed, trying to push Draco back out the door as their friends began wolf-whistling.
Hiding a grin and leaving Hermione to deal with Ron, Harry turned to find Draco leaning against the doorway, watching him fondly. It was ridiculous how the sight of him still made Harry’s heart swoop and stomach flutter all at once, unsure if he wanted to snog the living daylights out of him or paint a picture of his stupidly gorgeous face.
,” Draco panted as Harry reemerged from under the covers, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
“I’ve always wanted to marry rich, you know that,” he wept, despite the huge smile on his face, running his thumb along Harry’s cheek to catch a tear and ignoring the many still rolling down his own.

“Oh, for goodness sake, will you leave him alone? He’s only just got here,” Hermione chided, swatting Ron on the arm as she situated herself in between the two of them- or at least tried to, the skirt of her huge satin gown taking up more space than the three of them combined.
, then- I would never cast anything on you, you know that, not to this extent anyway. Not only would that be a complete breach of your trust, of your privacy, Merlin, of your
“Good. As you should be.” His gaze slid from Harry’s to his own fingers resting against Harry’s cheek, happy expression morphing into something more ruminative as he cocked his head.
“There’s normally an arsehole or two on there as well, I think...”
“You’ve never kept a secret for longer than five minutes!”

Subtle.
, everyone will be too pissed to notice they aren’t glued on. As long as we all stick together and don’t accidentally hex anyone, we’ll be ok.”
“Of course I miss you, you idiot,” he murmured against them, tracing a finger down Draco’s cheek. “I didn’t want you to leave in the first place.”
Or, rather, Harry stood; Draco was slumped against his chest, lips parted, cheeks flushed. Their eyes locked in the mirror and the spell took control once again, forcing Harry forward so that he had Draco pressed against the bathroom unit, head still spinning, desperation creeping in.
Harry’s arms hung limply by his sides as his  cock
“Oh, shut up, you jealous bint, just because you can’t decide who’s bits you want to settle down with.”
They separated, Draco smiling gratefully, sitting so that their backs rested against the cool tiled wall. Harry reached over, pulling Draco’s hand into his own lap, playing with his slender fingers until Draco curled up against him, head resting on Harry’s chest.
“You love me.”
Apparently, that included dancing.
,” Draco said loudly, cutting Harry off before he’d even opened his mouth. ‘Right?”
There weren’t many times in his life where Harry had been so stunned he’d been incapable of producing a single coherent thought. Sure, there’d been the odd occasion- the majority during fourth year, and some since he’d learnt what new abilities Draco Malfoy could put his mouth to- but none that he could pinpoint too specifically.
“- Absolutely not. Although you could always wait for it to-“
one more time...”
“You have to! She gave it to you!”
“Yeah, thank God that didn't happen,” Harry chuckled, gaze sliding back over to Draco. “Fuck, I’m really going to do this. When do you think-”
“Checking out Draco’s arse again, Harry?” Ginny asked, appearing from nowhere to clap him on the back. “I’m not surprised, it looks-“
“If I come to Pride with you, you’ll buy me a ridiculously expensive present?”
Then two things happened at once.
“Going fuck you, Draco,” Harry assured, “Going to make you
“What the fuck just happened?” Draco asked, looking from Blaise to Pansy to Harry with an expression of pure shock. Harry laughed, leaning forward to kiss him on the cheek.

“You think so? You don’t think I’m mad?”
“Stop what?” Draco grinned, before sinking slowly to his knees.

“Yeah, and I'm starting to regret that decision.”
“C’mon, at least ask him before you start freaking out.”
Unfortunately, Draco had said

“Your point?”
And then this morning...well, Harry couldn't deny that his excitement had made him a little more enthusiastic than usual, but that could only be expected from a man finally getting his way after seven years of failed attempts.
“You’re getting married.”
thinking about the amount of time I spent in my youth with your tongue in my mouth. And speak for yourself, my gay heart is fucking
Because yes, maybe Ron had been right to doubt him.
Voice cracking, Harry continued. “I really- I didn’t, I was ok; I’ve only just packed the last of your things away, and the sheets, they’ve only just stopped smelling of you, and when I saw you tonight I just- I thought it was going to be easy, but then this bloody curse—”
“Tell me about it.” Harry blew out a long breath, laughing incredulously as he dropped back onto the bench. “Shit. We nearly fucked that one up, didn’t we?”
He felt, more than heard, Draco’s startled gasp, which tore him out of the mortifying burst of desire; stumbling back, he wiped a hand across his lips, tasting blood. Body thrumming with arousal but trembling with anger, he grasped Draco’s wrist and began to drag him across the room. Draco, thankfully, was silent, stumbling along behind Harry as he pulled him through the tight circle of people- all eyes awkwardly diverted- and down the hallway until they reached the bathroom, unceremoniously shoving him through the door and knocking the light on before slamming it shut behind them.
Harry began to choke on his drink, spluttering embarrassingly, ready to explain that dentists wear lab coats, not suits, and that he
anything, it’s just a gift. Here.” Harry pressed the sticker to Draco’s chest, smoothing it down with two fingers. “It’s holographic, so it’ll change colour in the sun. It’s cute!”
“Fuck. Fuck!' Harry laughed incredulously, scrubbing a hand over his face. "Ok. Yeah, ok. I can do this.”
“Oh, stop it, you idiot,” Draco chided fondly, but made no attempt to move Harry and looked incredibly smug as he craned around him to look at everyone else. “Well, you all look
person I could have told, everyone would have known before I’d even picked out a ring.”
“No, not planned…I didn’t know where you stood, if you’d even want to talk to me- Merlin, if I’d even want to talk to you. In saying that, I hadn’t forgotten your preference for leather- ” Harry chuckled, eyes drifting shut, arm tightening around him, “- so I suppose it was less planning, more amenability. I think Mother knew what my intentions were though, I dare say better than I did.”
In his defence, it was impossible to hide, because Draco had situated his leather-clad arse right against Harry’s groin.
Draco looked at him for a second longer, expression unreadable, before he snatched the bottle of nail varnish off the table with one hand, crumpled the hot pants in the other and stood abruptly.
,” Harry hissed, sliding his hands round to grip Draco’s arse, giving it a rough squeeze and ignoring Ron’s exasperated complaint. “That right belongs to me and me only.”
that bad!” She exclaimed, one octave away from stamping her foot.
“Yeah, that’s brilliant, Luna,” Harry agreed, feeling embarrassingly overwhelmed when she gave his hand a little squeeze before wandering back to the rest of the group.
“Why? What did I do?”
“Christ, Ron,” he laughed weakly, downing his water and crumpling the empty plastic bottle in a desperate attempt to focus on something other than the overwhelming urge to cry, “some warning before you start waxing poetry about my love life?”
Because fuck, Draco looked good.

you just broke the statute because you turned me on in public.”
“Everything ok, darling?” He asked, bopping Harry on the nose.
Harry looked at him incredulously. "Clark Kent. You know, Superman? The glasses?” He gestured to his suit and tie. “Surely you know Superman?”
“Merlin’s
"Speaking of, I’m expecting you to de-glitter mine later on,” he murmured with a wink and Harry’s mouth fell open, frustrated and slightly horny and unable to do anything about it as Draco began to laugh.
He’d never been happier.
“It must have slipped my mind,” Draco replied, feigning innocence, before leaning in close. “If you don’t untwist your knickers," he whispered, "you won’t be seeing
“I know, I know, but I worry about them all around this many people,
Reassured, Draco stepped further into the shop and spent a few moments browsing idly. The sound of a door clicking shut caused him to look up. Eyes alighting on the impeccably dressed figure of Sebastien Toussaint himself, Draco allowed himself a small smile as he straightened from his perusal of a rack of trousers and moved toward the back as the tailor caught sight of him and nodded at him. That deep, rumbling voice rolled toward him pleasantly in greeting as he was waved toward the back half of the store.
Draco smirked at him, lightening the mood significantly with a return to their usual teasing banter.
. It was a picture..no, a drawing, and a rather good one at that. The gift giver had even had it matted and framed, but Draco barely registered this as he was so caught up watching himself throw back his head and laugh.
After pausing to put on his trainers, he followed a meandering path through the dunes and down to the beach, where he plopped down onto the sand and tilted his head back to look up at the stars. Harry liked to do so when he couldn’t sleep, and he’d made a habit of slipping out of the castle during the past year at school and just wandering the grounds. He’d often ended up walking around the Great Lake, and the waves lapping against the shore of the beach reminded him of that now. He’d found it soothing back then, too. As his eyes traced over familiar constellations, Harry allowed his mind to wander.
Draco huffed and tossed his hair out of his face as he said airily,
“Then perhaps a distraction is in order…” he trailed off, losing the thread of his thoughts as he tilted his head and leaned just a little bit down to brush his lips lightly against Harry’s. He pulled back slightly to gauge the other boy’s reaction, only to be startled into voicing a rather undignified squawk when Harry seized him by the front of his robes and hauled him back in for another kiss, this one much less coordinated but also much hotter and wetter, with open mouths, tongue, and a lot of breathless gasping in between from the both of them.
“If any braid would do, why do you think I would be attempting to do
. Harry broke off to nose along Draco’s hairline, murmuring nonsense and panting into his ear before taking the lobe into his mouth and sucking on it.
Draco eyed him suspiciously, and Harry laughed and shook his head at his lover’s antics as he replied, tone rife with amusement.
, you can’t do that here! We’re at work!”
“What is it; what’s wrong? Are you hurting anywhere? Talk to me, Harry.”
“Merlin
He let his tirade trail off as Harry just gaped at him for a moment before shutting the door and then shifted from foot to foot nervously, seemingly at a loss for what to do with his uninvited house guest. Some slumbering instinct must’ve kicked in after a moment because Harry suddenly reached out and gestured toward Draco with one hand.
, you lunatic! How long does that stuff last?”
He remembered the night depicted in the drawing vividly. The whole gang had been out together at a bar for one of their infrequent pub nights, and at that particular moment Draco had been just a little bit tipsy and feeling carefree. Blaise had been telling everyone a rather salacious story about a former paramour, and the artist had apparently been inspired by Draco’s amusement. The level of detail was actually quite impressive, and his eyes kept getting caught on little things like the objects scattered across the table or the curve of Hermione’s cheekbones, as she’d been sitting to his left and was also in the drawing as a result.
“Of fucking
And of course he missed Harry’s soft chuckle and the look of utter devotion he bestowed upon him as he whispered into the sudden quiet of their bedroom.
“Quite. And don’t you forget it, Potter.”
That had garnered several interested heads turning in her direction, but Seamus had interrupted with cheerful enthusiasm for the initial suggestion. After that planning had begun in earnest, a date set, and the Room of Requirement decided upon as the perfect location due to the versatility of the space. And so it was that Harry found himself stuffed in a broom cupboard two Saturdays later after being bullied into playing Seven Minutes in Heaven along with anyone else who wasn’t currently dancing or already making out on various different bits of furniture the Room had provided.
“It’s you,” Draco breathed, his eyes wide in a face drained of color. “Of course it’s you. It always has been. Merlin, I’m a fool.”
Harry chewed his lower lip as he tried to backtrack, wanting to make his meaning clear. Taking a deep breath, he tried again, tone softening toward the end.
Harry swallowed, throat clicking as his breath hitched, pupils dilating at the implication behind Draco’s answer. “I can be good. Dinner first, maybe?”
Draco shook his head in sharp negation before cutting Harry off by covering Harry’s mouth with his own. It wasn’t quite how he imagined their first kiss would be (and Salazar had he imagined it plenty, despite never in a million years thinking any such thing would actually happen), but it was perfect all the same. Harry’s lips were soft and slightly chapped, parted a bit from being caught mid speech, and Draco took advantage of this when Harry made a low, needy sound and clutched at the back of Draco’s shirt in his hands. He slipped his tongue in, where it slid hotly against Harry’s as the other man surged against him.
Draco was going to kill her. Just as soon as he could figure out a way to do that without anyone finding out it was him, that was. Eyes narrowed dangerously, he jerked to his feet and practically stalked over to the tree and picked up the next gift, and the torture continued through Millie unwrapping some sort of contraption involving her beloved cat, Hermione’s rare first-edition of a book no one else in the room had likely ever heard of, let alone read, ad nauseam until there was only one present left underneath the tree. Picking it up he paused to admire the rather elegant job whoever had gotten him had done wrapping it before making his way back to his chair and settling in to open it.
“Oh, this is just sad. Here, take mine.”
want to tell Harry why he was here. The wanker had the nerve to laugh at him, so why should he? Nevermind the fact that Harry wasn’t actually laughing, and that his brief hint of amusement was quickly giving way to a helpless sort of confusion that Draco found incredibly endearing. And damn it if he wasn’t right back to sneaking glances at him between sips of his tea while pretending to be offended. This was not going how Draco had pictured at all.
It was worse than he’d anticipated. Damn Blaise and his scheming! Harry
This couldn’t be happening. Not
“I’ll get you for that, Potter. Just you wait.”
Harry snorted as Draco picked up his cup and inhaled appreciatively before taking a sip. He hadn’t neglected the two spoons of sugar Draco took in his tea, though how the man’s teeth hadn’t rotted out of his head ages ago was beyond Harry. Draco liked sweets. A lot. After taking a gulp of his own tea, he eyed his uninvited visitor and ground out, “What do you want, Draco?”
Draco got up and stalked around the island, gaze fixed on Harry as he boxed him in with a determined air, placing himself squarely in front of the other man so he was trapped between Draco and the counter behind him. Plucking the teacup from Harry’s grip, he placed it haphazardly to one side and answered with a huff of impatience.
“We’ve been friends for years. Of course I know how you like your tea. Wanna tell me why you’re here yet?”
Okay, so Harry couldn’t entirely suppress his natural tendency for sass. He wasn’t a saint, no matter what some of those ridiculous articles in
“Potter, what in the name of Merlin’s saggy bollocks are you doing out here at half-past one in the morning? I’ll have you know I was perfectly comfortable where I was before waking up to realize you needed fetching. If I knew I was going to be spending half my vacation minding you, I’d have gone somewhere with room service instead and left you to your own devices.”
He felt Harry shift him so that he was lying on the bed on his back before his husband started to carefully and thoroughly massage the feeling back into his arms, checking to make sure that blood flow was restored properly and that Draco was comfortable. When Harry seemed to be satisfied that no harm had been done, he removed the blindfold as well and bundled Draco up in a blanket and spooned him from behind. Draco sighed tiredly and snuggled back against him, reaching one hand out of the blanket to clutch at Harry’s arm slung around his middle. It suddenly occurred to him that Harry hadn’t come. Frowning, Draco turned his head so he could look back at him without shifting his position any further.
Harry answered the door looking somewhat disheveled and only slightly out of breath, a hand raised to brush a stray curl that had escaped his messy bun out of his face as he took in the sight of his unexpected visitor. He’d been so absorbed working on his latest painting that he hadn’t heard the knocking, which had then turned into banging accompanied by irritated shouts of his name.
There was suddenly zero distance between their bodies, and Draco moaned softly into the kiss as every part of him pressed against Harry from shoulder to hip. The hand that had been cupping Harry’s face sank into his hair instead, twining in the wild black curls as if to anchor him there more firmly. They explored every inch of each other’s mouths before pulling back just enough to catch their breaths, foreheads pressed together as they watched each other with new eyes. When Draco finally found his voice it was an octave lower than usual, thick with want and things he wasn’t quite ready to voice.
“Hush, love. You’re tired. We have time,” Harry’s voice warmed with a hint of amusement as he continued, “You did plenty for me just now, believe me. You were perfect.”
, and his breath gusted hotly against the skin of Malfoy’s cheek, causing the other boy to shiver against him.
Harry had finally had enough and fixed Blaise with a severe frown and began speaking. Draco abruptly closed his mouth and leaned back in his seat, mildly curious to see how Harry would handle the whole thing.
Draco swallowed convulsively, his gaze locked with Harry’s as he took this in. When he managed a reply, it was a harsh whisper, the hand in Harry’s hair tightening as he drew him close.
The blond shot him a teasing grin and elbowed him in the side lightly, and Harry growled and gave Draco a playful little shove. This led to a small tussle, and before they knew what was happening, the two of them were rolling about in the sand vying for dominance. Eventually, Harry’s slightly higher mass won him the advantage, and he found himself straddling Draco’s hips, grasping the blond’s wrists and holding them stretched out above his head. They were both laughing, chests heaving slightly from exertion, and Harry looked down into Draco’s face, their gazes locking as their laughter slowly ebbed away to be replaced by a silence that felt charged with a new kind of tension.
“Not at the moment, Potter, but I’ll be sure to let you know if I change my mind.”
“I’m fine. Now where were we?”
“Oh, Harry, didn’t you sleep at all? Here, have some tea,” pausing to hand him a cup and start loading his plate with things she knew he liked, “Was it really that bad, rooming with Draco? I thought you two were getting along now.”
He wasn’t sure what part of Draco he loved more, his mouth or his hands, but right at that moment the hands were probably winning as one wrapped around his length and started to stroke him roughly. The other slipped further down to cup his bollocks and give them a gentle tug. Harry grunted as he started to pump himself through the tight circle of Draco’s fist, one of his own hands cupping the back of Draco’s neck and angling him the way he wanted so he could deepen the kiss even further.
“Why didn’t you ever say anything? Here I was thinking it was just me, and we could’ve been doing this all along.”
Draco cut him off abruptly by squeezing in past him with a huffed out exclamation.
Harry gave Hermione a wounded expression and opened his mouth before Draco could get there.
Ron let out a snort of laughter, and Hermione beamed up at him. They exchanged knowing looks before moving on to chatting briefly about their mornings together. It wasn’t often they got the chance to spend time together at work, so they savored the stolen moments that remained of their lunch breaks before promising to see each other at home and parting ways. Ron headed back to the DMLE, leaving Hermione to her stacks of paperwork. She was quickly climbing the ranks in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and had already made incredible inroads when it came to drafting and seeing to the enactment of policies in favor of the fair treatment of other sentient Magical Beings. She was going to be Minister one day. He just knew it, and he couldn’t be more proud of her if he tried.
He could feel the blush heating his cheeks and knew that Harry would see. There was no way to miss it with his coloring, and not for the first time Draco lamented his own pale complexion for betraying him.
“Which is
“What’s that, love? You’re gonna have to be more specific.”
“Monsieur Malfoy, this way if you please. I took the liberty of setting your purchase out for viewing. You will tell me what you think of my creation.”
Unfortunately for him she was having none of it and interrupted him mid-sentence.
Harry tried to keep the smile out of his voice, but from the way Draco’s head jerked up and mercurial grey eyes narrowed dangerously at him he figured he probably hadn’t quite succeeded.
“Race you there. Last one in owes the winner a forfeit!”
And that was all it took to send Draco spiraling over the edge. He came with a hoarse cry, spilling himself between them in hot, wet splashes that coated Harry’s hand and both their stomachs. That and the feel of Draco clenching around him tipped Harry over into his own orgasm, and he leaned in, biting down on Draco’s shoulder to muffle his groans as his body jerked once, twice, three times before he sagged against him, just barely managing to catch himself on his elbows before he squished Draco beneath his dead weight.
Toussaint tsked at him and circled him once slowly, as if taking his measure. Finally, he spoke again, and this time it was as if he were issuing a challenge.
The thing most of the wizarding world didn’t know, however, was that underneath Draco’s impeccably tailored robes (and the occasional 3 piece designer Muggle suit) hid some of Harry’s most gorgeous works of art. Draco had volunteered to be his own personal canvas, and he guarded this secret jealously. Only their families and closest friends knew, and Draco preferred to keep it that way. He treasured each tattoo like they were a gift Harry had given him. In fact, most of them were. The dragon that curved along the right side of his ribcage was for his birthday one year, the spill of narcissus, pansies, lilies, and molly flowers across one shoulder on Mother’s Day to remind him of all the best mothers in both their lives, the constellation that bore his name forked through with lightning cradled in a crown of stag antlers sat directly over his heart was from their first dating anniversary, and quite a few more, besides.
The same hand you refused
Draco, who’d made a face and sauntered off ahead, probably to make sure he got first pick of the beds.
“Remind me to thank George for those chocolates, hmm? We’ll send him an owl later.”
“Always, Harry. I’m afraid you’re rather stuck with me now.”
Harry froze as Draco’s words registered, and his eyes, which had been locked with the other man’s, flickered briefly to his lips before jerking back up again in time to catch Draco’s smirk and the arch of one slender eyebrow. He couldn’t even manage a token bluster in response before Draco was back across the room and grabbing his swim trunks and vanishing into the bathroom with a parting, “See you on the beach, scarhead.”
Harry cut the other man off there, shifting to give himself more leverage to thrust up into Draco, an arm around him to steady him as his other hand slid between their bodies to grasp Draco’s erection and begin to jerk him off in hard, fast pulls. He was murmuring reassurance into the blond’s ear as he urged him on.
anything. We’re not..I’m..I mean, you—”
Harry stopped behind his chair and blinked down at him, his brow creasing in a frown. He glanced at Pansy on Draco’s right and then at Blaise on his left. After a solid minute of just standing there and frowning, heads started to turn in his direction. Blaise glanced over his shoulder and then arched an eyebrow before looking to Draco, then pointedly back to Harry.
“There’s a plate of leftovers for you in the cooling cupboard. You’re fucking welcome!”
“Well, it’s about bloody time! I was beginning to think we’d have to dose you two idiots with something before you drove the rest of us mad.”
Harry swallowed reflexively as he watched Draco unwrap his gift. It was taking everything he had to keep the anxiety off of his face, and he was able to relax marginally when he saw how stunned the other man looked. So he wasn’t offended. That was good. Harry made an approximation of the same wondering noises everyone else was making as the picture was revealed to the room at large, but meanwhile he was keeping a sharp watch on Draco out of the corner of his eye. He might’ve been the only one in the room to catch the hesitance before he gave up his grip on the picture as Hermione took it from him.
“What?
“Thanks, and yeah, er- no. Wait.. didn’t sleep much. New place, maybe. We do! Get along. He-it’s fine.”
The smile gave way to a smirk instead as Harry nestled Draco closer and leaned down to press a kiss to his hair before answering.
above Draco’s heart as the blond nodded furiously, throat too tight to respond any other way at first. It didn’t take Draco long to find his voice, however, and he twitched and gave a little gasp as Harry’s head shifted to the side and he took Draco’s nipple into his mouth and sucked, teeth nibbling lightly at first and then slightly harder when Draco clasped his head in his hands and held him there.
Draco undid the fastenings of his trousers and hooked his thumbs underneath them and his pants both, arching an eyebrow at Harry as he began to slide them slowly down his hips. Face flaming, Harry jerked around, giving Draco his back as he tugged down his joggers and pants, stepping out of them one leg at a time, stumbling a little as he did so. He heard Draco snickering at him as the other man finished shedding the last of his clothing.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Me working you over ‘til you were begging for my cock? Because I can make that happen..”
He gripped Harry’s shaft at the base and gave it a few pumps that left Harry gasping before lowering his head and taking the tip into his mouth. As his tongue dipped into the slit, Harry’s eyes rolled back in his head, breath escaping him in a low moan as he sank his hands into Draco’s hair, careful not to pull it. Draco pulled off for a moment to flash Harry a devious smirk.
“You wish!”
Biting back a growl of frustration, he allowed his gaze to roam over the other man as Harry gave a bashful grin at something Longbottom was saying. Draco had to dig his nails into the cushion of his chair to keep himself from leaping up and crossing the room to strangle the plant-loving oaf. Potter was
“Well we wouldn’t dream of denying you the chance to whinge about it, darling. All the while you get to be the center of attention, of course!”
“Draco..are you sure this isn’t too fast? I want it. Don’t misunderstand me. I’ve wanted you for ages, but that..this isn’t…”
“I’m in love with you, you great oaf, so yes, of course it’s more. And I knew all that already. Did you think I imagined just anyone could give me that sort of present and not have it
“I said, do you want biscuits, too? I have chocolate and plain shortbread ones, so pick your poison.”
The soulmate bond was often said to be triggered by significant moments in the pair’s lives. Of course, that was only one theory. There were many theories on the whys and hows of the awakening of the link, but none had been proven fact. It was said that they researched soulmate bonds in the Department of Mysteries, but none of the fruits of that labor had ever been made public knowledge.
no one else has ever been.
for years, but his rejection in their first year and the subsequent rivalry that had followed had sort of derailed his initial intentions. Nevermind the whole ‘Dark Lord, being on the wrong side of a war’ thing. That needn’t be mentioned ever again as far as Draco was concerned. He’d survived all of the awkward apologies and had thought all he could hope for was the uneasy truce they had all come to, but this? This was an unexpected windfall, and if he had to use the excuse of a stupid party game to make it happen? Well, never let it be said that Draco Malfoy wasn’t an opportunist.
Harry blinked at the abrupt change of subject but was unwilling to push their newfound truce any farther just then. Rubbing the back of his neck, he considered the other man for a moment before nodding toward the bathroom.
private session only a few weeks before their wedding day. No one besides Harry would ever have the privilege of seeing that one, and Draco had had to beg for nearly a year before Harry had relented and permanently etched the words in his own untidy scrawl onto Draco’s skin,
know. Only the two of you could possibly put up with each other. Circe’s tits, I deserve a medal for this!”
Luckily Draco was rather quick on the uptake and hastily yanked his loosened tie over his head and tossed it aside before making short work of the buttons on his shirt and wiggling free of that as well. Harry barely gave Draco time to settle back down again before he was sliding his palms up the other man’s thighs, pushing gently to widen Draco’s stance as he went. He dipped his head and wasted no time in wrapping one fist around the base of Draco’s shaft as he took the head into his mouth and gave an experimental suck.
Draco rolled his eyes and proceeded to toe off his shoes and peeled off his socks, next starting on the buttons of his dress shirt as he eyed Harry hungrily.
“What were you thinking of, I wonder? That is, I’m assuming you’re capable of rational thought. Perhaps I should remember who I’m talking to.”
the bastard couldn’t resist sticking his nose in where it wasn’t wanted. He’d handed out room assignments and a bloody itinerary when everyone had arrived at the house (more like a mansion if you asked him) and slithered off before Harry could make a grab for him after seeing that he’d put him with
“Yes, I
Harry was breathing hard, eyes still sparking with temper, and as Draco watched him, his own eyes a bit wide, he couldn’t help but think it was probably one of the hottest things he’d ever seen in his life. He must’ve made some sort of sound, a small needy sort of thing, surely, for Harry refocused on him intently and smoothed a hand down his back, some of the tightness leaving his expression as he spoke again.
He swallowed thickly, waiting for some kind of reaction, and Draco didn’t leave him hanging too long because he was suddenly kissing him fiercely, one hand cupping the back of Harry’s head as Draco’s tongue plundered the depths of his mouth. A bit dazed, he blinked his eyes open slowly to meet Draco’s gaze as the other man pulled back from the kiss to smile at him fondly.
Ron had apparently escaped this lecture and chose that moment to plop himself down on Harry’s other side and start loading his plate with an assortment of small mince pies. Grinning hugely at such a windfall, he startled Harry right out of his musing and interrupted Luna mid-story to exclaim,
but of one thing he was very certain. Whoever had drawn this
Draco went white and then red, jerking to his feet from where he’d been sitting at the breakfast nook. Harry watched him slowly advance on him, noted how his grey eyes darkened, turning stormy with fury. The other man’s tone was harsh and rose in volume the closer he got to Harry.
It was some time later that Harry found himself kneeling in the sand and scooping the stuff into a plastic bucket with a little hand trowel Luna had handed him after roping him into building a sandcastle of all things with her and Millie. He still wasn’t quite sure why he’d agreed to this, but it was Luna, and he had a hard time saying no to her for some reason. Apparently most people did. Maybe it had something to do with her inherent sweetness and the way her eyes went all large and earnest when she spoke to someone. Or maybe Harry was just a pushover. He gave up trying to reason it out in his head and packed the sand tightly as he’d been instructed (ordered, really) to do before flipping the bucket upside down where Luna indicated and carefully lifting it off to leave a crenulated tower of sand in its place.
He had flushed and stammered out an apology before grabbing his own towel and barricading himself in the bathroom, the sound of Draco’s laughter chasing after him. The other man hadn’t been quite as amused when Harry had emerged nearly an hour later (he’d dithered hoping Draco would be asleep, no such luck) only to bid Draco a hasty goodnight before diving into his bed and spelling the curtains shut. He’d then spent a mostly sleepless night tossing and turning while plagued by the memory of Draco’s nearly naked body, not to mention the soulmark bearing his first word to Draco on the other man’s chest. It was so vague that Harry was positive Draco didn’t know who his soulmate was. In fact, he’d heard Draco lament that very fact several times during their last school year.
“He’s adjusting as well as one can expect, given his previous situation.” Severus certainly wasn’t going to inform the Headmaster that his son was brilliant and soaking up as much as he could like a sponge, nor of how magically powerful his son was. Especially considering that Harry was more powerful than the two of them combined.
“People will think that the Promised King has to do certain things, or act a certain way, in order to be what they think he should be. In order for them to believe that he is the Promised King. If he doesn't act that way, or do those things, they may say nasty things about him.” Harry thought about it for a minute, but didn’t really look less confused. Severus sighed. He was sure that Harry would understand when he was a little older, and explanations could be more in depth.
With a sigh, Harry got to his feet and shuffled along after Luna and Ron as the rest of their friends made their way into the next room. Easing along the wall once he’d slipped through the door, Harry was angling for one of the armchairs near the fire. Much to his dismay, however, he was waylaid by Pansy. She looped her arm through his and made a great show of leading him over to an elegant settee as she grinned, almost shark-like, and yanked him down beside her while managing to make the motion look graceful and entirely like she hadn’t just strong-armed him into sitting with her against his will. He was just about to ask her what she thought she was up to when Hermione’s voice cut across the low hum of conversation from her place on the sofa between Ron and Millie.
He fidgeted under the blond’s regard until Draco relented and grabbed a fistful of Harry’s shirt, tugging him down til his face was level with Draco’s and murmured, “You’re damn right it is.” And promptly kissed him senseless.
She gestured to the presents under the tree and flashed Draco a smile Harry swore was almost mischievous, but he was distracted by Malfoy’s put upon sigh and dramatic flounce as he got up from his chair and moved to do as she bid him, complaining all the while, naturally.
“Potter, if you don’t put your cock in my arse now I’ll hex your bollocks off. Specific enough for you?”
Harry had opted for sitting and had settled himself on the side nearest the shepherd’s pie, of which he was currently enjoying a generous slice. Luna was sitting on his left and sharing details from her latest trip abroad to search for some obscure (and possibly imaginary, Harry was never quite sure) magical creature. He nodded along and made appreciative hums in all the right places to indicate he was listening while actually doing nothing of the sort. Instead he was brooding about whether or not Draco would actually like his gift. He’d been up half the night before worrying about just that and had nearly fire-called Hermione at two in the morning to beg her to say he was ill and couldn’t make it.
Draco blinked and jerked to attention as Harry turned around and looked at him oddly before repeating his question.
Nearly twenty minutes later, he was practically thrumming with impatience when the lock on the bathroom door clicked, and Draco strode out in a pair of trousers, a towel around his bare shoulders that he was using to scrub at his damp hair. Harry was beginning to suspect that the universe was having a laugh at his expense with the sheer number of times he’d been subjected to seeing the object of his affection half-naked in the past few days. Swallowing, he jerked his gaze from where it’d been traveling steadily south of Draco’s collarbones and winced when met with the other man’s scowl. He bounced to his feet in a rush, speaking fast in the hopes that Draco would hear him out before he hexed him into oblivion.
felt like that before Draco had closed the distance between them?! He’d felt the pull, of course, urging him to touch Harry, to acknowledge their connection and close the loop, but it hadn’t been anything as frightening as what Harry described he’d felt in the instant that their bond had flared to life between them.
“I love you, too, you numpty. Now go to sleep.”
But Ginny had surprised him by gently explaining that she’d moved on in the year they’d been apart, that so much had happened, and really, they were neither of them the people they’d been before the war. He’d assured her that he understood, that they’d always be friends, and that maybe it was for the best. He
Shuddering at the very thought, the hand that was gripping Harry’s arm shifted to encircle his waist instead, needing the reassurance of both holding and being held in turn. Draco sighed as Harry pulled back a little to meet his gaze evenly, those familiar green eyes, so vivid in spite of the horrid oval frames that had become almost as recognizable as Harry’s scar watching him almost carefully as Harry voiced a question of his own.
Harry flung open the door to their shared office with his usual lack of care, a complaint on his lips that was completely lost to the sight that greeted him as he barged into the room. Mouth falling open in shock, he froze for a split second before whirling around and slamming the door, hitting it with a number of locking and privacy spells almost without even thinking. As soon as he could be sure no one else was going to walk in on them, he turned back around to be met with a view he’d half thought he was only imagining before.
“Shut up.”
You like to comment on
Harry paused as he caught sight of himself in the mirror. He’d just gotten out of the shower, and the now familiar script of his soulmark curved along his right hip bone,
catching Snitches, grasping
Swallowing nervously, Draco hastily stopped doing just that, shaking his head and clenching and unclenching his hands in a futile gesture as he pleaded mindlessly, “No, no, please! Fuck, Harry, don’t stop! Don’t- oh
Draco pulled Harry closer at that, kissing him fiercely, and for a few minutes they got lost in exploring each other’s mouths. When they finally came up for air, Harry smiled down at him and grabbed a pillow from the pile behind Draco, tapping one of his hips with a fingertip in a wordless command for him to lift up. Draco complied and let Harry stuff it beneath him to aid in their next endeavor while Draco spread his legs and brought his knees up to his chest. He inhaled sharply when Harry scooted toward him on his knees, and he felt the hard length of him pressing against his arse.
, because he squeezed Harry’s forearms bracingly and spoke in a much gentler tone than Harry had been expecting.
Draco’s head snapped up as the realization came to him. It was Potter. He must’ve been watching as he came back from the bar.
Harry stumbled back against the island when Draco pushed him, a hand gripping the counter to steady himself as the other man swept out of the kitchen. He blinked, a bit stunned by both the force of Draco’s outburst and the fact that even though Draco was mad at him, he’d still made sure that Harry would get dinner. Sighing at the realization that he’d really screwed this up, he ran a hand over his face and slowly puttered over to the cooling cupboard to retrieve the food and warm it with a charm. There was no point in chasing after Draco just then. He’d probably get something thrown at his head for his trouble.
Harry snorted and muttered something about ‘shameless cheating’ under his breath, receiving a hard poke in the sternum from Draco for his trouble. Rubbing at the spot, he eyed the other man balefully (it was for show; he couldn’t have managed to be annoyed at the blond at that moment even if he tried) as he responded.
He liked it much better when Malfoy smiled, even if it was never voluntarily at Harry without that mask falling back into place as soon as he realized what he’d done. Harry wished he knew what the prat was hiding from. It’s not like anyone really expected them to be at each other’s throats any longer. Well.. nobody who mattered at least. He chewed his lip in thought. Okay, so maybe Malfoy’s parents. At least his father, but that bloody tosser was in Azkaban where he belonged. Narcissa was always perfectly cordial to Harry whenever he visited the Manor with everyone else, however. He rather suspected that had something to do with saving her son from a grisly death by fire, but hey, he’d take what he could get.
Harry startled so badly he dropped his cup, splashing tea across the tabletop. Cursing, he jumped up and grabbed a dish towel and began mopping up the mess with it. “Why haven’t I
Blushing to the roots of his hair, Harry dove onto his bed, yanked the curtains closed around him, and hid his face in his hands, taking deep breaths until he could calm himself back down. It was only the first day, and he was already in so much trouble. After he heard the bathroom door click open and made sure of Draco’s retreating footsteps down the hall, he hastily changed into his own swimwear and emerged from the relative safety of his bed. Taking a moment to glance over Blaise’s ridiculous itinerary, he saw that they were indeed scheduled for ‘recreational beach time’ now. With another sigh, this one accompanied by a massive eye roll, he slowly ventured out of the room to join everyone else on the beach.
“I knew you’d be bossy.”
Draco had always loved Harry’s eyes, even back when they were still framed by those hideous round spectacles that took up half of his face. Thank Merlin Hermione had talked Harry into replacing them the year after the war. Now Harry’s glasses were sleek and nondescript, accentuating his features rather than overwhelming them. Draco would never admit it to his face, but he rather liked them. His thoughts were wandering again, and this time the tailor had noticed and was giving him a distinctly impatient look. Wincing, Draco admonished himself silently for mooning over someone he couldn’t possibly ever have and resolved to focus on the task at hand, not whom it was for. He was doing this to uphold his title of best gift giver, not win over Potter. He would have to remember to stop referring to him as Harry in his head. It would only make things harder in the long run.
He could’ve seen it now if it weren’t for that pesky blindfold. He didn’t have much cause to complain, however, when he felt Harry pull his hand away to cast a wandless
Sometimes he thought he should join her for the whole stretch, but he’d miss his friends, his work. Granted, he didn’t strictly
“What gave it away, Potter? Was it the begging you to touch me? Or perhaps my cock in my hand when you came through the door?”
“You would latch onto that, you tosser.”
, part of him screamed, but he shoved the voice to the back of his mind desperately before anymore of it could show in his face or in his actions. There was no signature, however, and Hermione tutted in disappointment before ferrying the picture across the room for everyone clamoring for a closer look to take turns examining it themselves.
I love it when you get like this, but maybe not when we're on a tight schedule, ok? Save it for later.”
“Seen so many…people like us.” Draco’s eyes found his and he smiled, shaking his head in wonderment. “I didn’t know- I didn’t realise- is this what Muggles are like?”
Harry huffed a laugh, looking over at Hermione. “Yeah, I suppose he is. Hey, how’s that marriage thing working out? Recommendable?”
“Promise.”
“It’s got me this far.”
“So…I can kiss you? Here? In the street?”
Following Ron into the kitchen, where he’d already begun devouring a finger sandwich and piling a load of Muggle buffet food onto a paper plate, Harry wondered if Clark Kent hadn't been such a good idea after all.
the point,” he said faintly, making eye contact with Draco, who frowned and excused himself from Pansy.
Stuffing them into his back pocket and hoping Draco wouldn’t hex his balls off, Harry hurried down the stairs, realising with a start that he’d forgotten to put a top on.
himself across the small space between them, throwing himself into Harry’s arms.
Harry couldn’t quite stop the bitterness that surged through him, scolding himself inwardly, knowing there was no need to be jealous- after all, both Draco and Pansy were as bent as a rainbow, so very unlikely to be coupling up.
“So, what the hell are you supposed to be?”
“Harry?”
,” Pansy drawled, the sting of her words softened by her flushed cheeks and happy smile as she flopped down onto the grass beside them.
you’re ok?” He murmured in Harry’s ear.
Harry kissed his thumb with a smile. “Good. I love you too.”
“The only bits Harry is interested in are
“He’s over there, mate,” Ron said, gesturing with his water bottle. Harry settled back against the bench when he followed Ron’s direction and found Draco had moved further down the street with Luna, each waving a flag as they watched the parade. “And I was joking, by the way.”
“Did you- did you spell these white? I don’t remember these,” he asked, plucking at Draco’s waistband, trying hard to remain casual and trying
Luna smiled at him in a way that suggested she thought he was being incredibly slow, playing with Ginny’s hand on her shoulder. “We were accessing our magical cores, Harry, the most natural, primitive aspect of our beings. Surely you understand that materialistic items such as clothing would have hindered the process…I didn’t realise you had such a problem with nudity.“
- before edging round Zabini, who didn’t appear to be dressed as anything at all. His maroon velvet suit put Harry’s to shame, and he scowled, unsure why the pretentious git had been invited anyway.
Except that wasn’t true.
"Within reason, yeah, as long as it's legal- which, actually, the Muggles have been working on quite a bit recently."
"I’ll admit- I haven’t been quite as put together as one might assume,” he murmured, and Harry snorted wetly. “But Potter, I would never—”
“Clearly, Potter,” Draco bit out raggedly, and Harry groaned, throwing his head back, hips snapping frantically, uncontrollable, like a man possessed.
Severus left the door to Harry's room partially open, and spent the rest of his evening researching curses and long term effects of curse scars.
“She said that she would never bite anyone unless it was self-defense or to protect her Master. And she said that she would never hurt another creature unless to eat. She said that she knows that Shadow is young, like she is. They may play, but she won’t hurt him.” Severus sighed.
“Harry, I am going to use my wand to scan you. You won't feel anything, but it will tell me if anything else needs to be healed. Are you okay with this? I am going to do something similar when I scan your eyes.” Because of his experiences, Poppy wanted Harry to feel a little more control about what was going on. Harry nodded at her, and Poppy waved her wand and cast the diagnostic charms. Harry giggled.
“Malfoy Manor.” Draco said, a hiccup in his voice. The fire turned green, and he stepped through and disappeared. Harry felt bad. Even though the little boy had sounded like Dudley, he didn't mean to make him cry.
Harry loved everything about his new life. He had a pet that followed him around and he swore sometimes acted like it understood him. He was constantly learning new things about magic and the world he now lived in, and no one hit him or yelled at him. He once accidentally broke a vase at the Malfoy’s house when he and Draco was playing, and Draco was very concerned when Harry had cowered against the wall and was sure that he was going to get in trouble. Narcissa had come and had a house elf fix the vase with magic, then had pulled Harry into her lap and explained that no one here would ever yell at him unless it was to warn him that he was about to do something dangerous, and that NO ONE would ever hit him again if she had anything to do about it. Draco had held Harry’s hand and agreed, although he did say that he might yell if he got excited or punch him in the shoulder, but that he would never hurt his best friend. Then they had hot chocolate, which made Harry feel much better.
He made sure to stay away from the kids, but he kept an eye on Severus and Lucius to make sure that they were nowhere near the kids or him when he made his move. He kept his wand behind his robes and aimed it at the buffet table. Rowle started moving towards the corner with the kids as there was a loud crash. The dishes of food started to slide onto the floor, and ladies started screaming as their beautiful dress robes were stained with the mixed food. Severus and Lucius made their way towards the table, and all of the kids turned to see what was causing the commotion.
“I am sorry, Minerva, but I am afraid that I can't leave Harry at this time. He's had a bit of a scare. I am going to have to cancel the rest of my classes for the day.”
“These are yours. The journal is for drawing in, or writing down your feelings. The colored pencils can be used to color whatever you like. I prefer to use watercolor paints, but those are a little bit harder to work with.” Harry took the book and pencils reverently, as they were the first things that he had ever had that were just his. “These books have pictures of animals and places around the Wizarding World. I thought they would keep you occupied until I get back.”
From behind a hedge, Harry saw Remus Lupin step out, quickly followed by Lucius and his father. Harry couldn’t help but cry out, wanting to protect his father.
“Father, look! Nala is an Occamy, and she can fly, and grow to whatever size she wants, and when she has eggs they are going to be silver, and she’s really rare!” Harry chattered, sounding a lot like Draco. Nala lifted her head to look at Severus from the chair where Harry had been sitting, and Shadow came trotting up from somewhere else in the room, chirping hello.
“So mote it be, by the Ancient Laws. Alligatus Magicae!” The gold and silver light swirled together faster and faster until, in a flash of bright light, they disappeared. Minerva blew out a deep breath. She had been around children for almost her entire life, and she had never seen such strong magic in such a small child.
“Do you remember how I told you that your parents died protecting you, and that they were very brave?” Harry nodded. Severus sighed again. This wasn't a conversation he thought that he would have to have so soon. “They... they were killed by a man. A very evil man. And the story about that evil man is very complicated. But that man was very powerful, and very charismatic...” Harry gave him a questioning look. Severus tried to think of an easier way to explain the Dark Lord to a 6 year old. “The man was very good at talking to people and getting them to believe what he said, even when what he said was very bad or lies. For a while, Lucius believed the things that man said. But that man started hurting people, and Lucius knew that following the man would put his family in danger. So he stopped following the bad man, but some of the things that Lucius believes are still true. I wouldn't say that he doesn't like you, I would say that he is... worried about protecting his family.”
“Are you alright? We don’t have to stay in here. It’s a ridiculous game, anyway. I’ll get Theo back for this, rest assured.”
Pressing his forehead into his arm, Draco keened and shuddered under Harry’s ministrations. He was slowly coming unraveled, and Harry was enjoying every minute of Draco’s mounting desperation. His hips moved mindlessly, eager for any sort of friction on his aching cock and finding none. It was that that finally broke him, and his breath coming in sobs he spoke, voice muffled with his head buried in his arms as it was.
Draco blinked at him slowly. He’d
“I do believe I’ve bested you a second time. Is the Chosen One losing his edge? My, your adoring fans will just be crushed. How sad.”
to know who’d done it. Who had drawn him like that? Given him something so achingly personal? His gaze paused on Potter. Could it possibly be..? No, no, Draco was being foolish. It wasn’t possible. Harry was a terrible liar. There was no way he could keep something like that a secret for any length of time. But still…
Harry watched as shock flashed across the other man’s face before Draco’s gaze focused on him, and he was seized roughly by the front of his shirt and hauled in for another scorching kiss. Harry let Draco have his way for the time being and leaned into the kiss, hands sliding up to card through the silky strands of his hair, tightening reflexively when Draco nipped at his bottom lip before sucking on it.
When they’d begun this, he’d asked why they couldn’t just do it with magic, and Millie had just snorted while Luna laughed and said, “But Harry, it would be over in a moment. Where’s the fun in that?” Well, she wasn’t wrong. It was certainly taking longer this way, though he was still dubious as to whether or not it was actually much fun.
“Yes, my lord. And would His Majesty like to claim anything else while we’re on the subject?”
“He’s not
“Asked me out, of course. What else? And honestly, Harry, are you a wizard, or aren’t you?” Draco rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand, vanishing the mess and banishing the dish towel, which now hung limply from Harry’s slacked grip as he stared at Draco. After a minute of tense silence, Harry shook himself and finally met Draco’s gaze evenly.
Eventually, he couldn’t help but notice that Draco was looking at him. Harry quickly attempted to avert his gaze, but it was too late. Draco was already fixing him in place with the heat of his stare, and there was a glimmer of determination in his eyes that made Harry doubt his chances for coming out of this encounter unscathed. He was proved correct all too quickly when the gorgeous prat opened his stupid mouth to comment on Harry’s apparent exhaustion.
