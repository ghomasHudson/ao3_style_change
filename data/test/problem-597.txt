Malfoy elbowed Harry in the ribs. “What Potter here meant to say was congratulations.” Malfoy glared at Harry. “He just lacks the tact to do so.” he added under his breath.
Harry manoeuvred them through the pub and out into the street. He turned them into the alleyway to the apparation spot, with Ron’s arm around Harry’s shoulders. The tall ginger head leaning down onto Harry’s. “Ready?” He asked.
Draco tuned him out.  He knew what he was about.  He also knew he had Potter to thank for his leniency in the sentence.  Two years on house arrest, the first of which was to be served without a wand.  Potter had to deliver him from London out to Azkaban where the tracing charms would be placed.  From there Draco was on his own. Wandless for an entire year. Not allowed out of his flat for two.  The idea of being so vulnerable for so long made him ill. He didn’t see why they couldn’t just place the charms on him after he’d been sentenced at Wizengamot.  Draco strongly suspected the trip out to Azkaban was strictly for intimidation purposes. A test, of sorts, to see how far he was willing to prove his good will. He couldn’t prove it though, and he was in no position to make a stir.
They laughed, a little awkward, a little anxious and unsure. The tension hadn’t quite dissipated.  Draco dragged Harry into an awkward half-hug, which Harry blamed on the champagne.  They went back into the party as though nothing had happened.  As though their friendship hadn’t just taken a turn. Harry didn’t know how he felt about it.
.” It flew into his hands. Draco loved magic. The sounds of janglings keys and the scraping of the lock came drifting down the hall and Draco stuffed his wand back into this trouser pocket.
“No!” Malfoy spat at the same time Harry said, “Fantastic!  Cheers.” She smiled indulgently at him and patted his cheek as she passed.
Harry shrugged the shoulders of the body that belonged to him. He knew the body belonged to him.  But it didn’t feel right. Nothing about this day felt right. It was like he was watching Malfoy shake someone else’s shoulders who wasn’t Harry.
“Of course you plug it in.” She said patiently. “I just didn’t think I needed to say that part. On second thought. Let’s just get you some Nescafe. Start you off slow. I don’t think you’re quite ready for all this yet.”
“Where were we?” He asked as he slid into the seat.  He began unwrapping his sandwich. “Right, you were just telling me you were a virgin.”
There were a few double takes at Draco’s appearance.  Each time Harry caught him tugging his left sleeve down. No one said anything untoward but that might have been due to Harry’s scowling presence at Draco’s side.
Murmurs began spreading through the onlookers. Draco distinctly heard the words “Death Eater scum” and “Azkaban” in the lot.
“Oh? You watch Bake Off, yeah?” Olivia said excitedly. “Be honest, how badly do you miss Mary Berry?”
He laid a hand firmly on her knee and squeezed gently.  “Ah yes, Priya. But I didn’t marry her. I married Elizabeth.”
“Er, not Malfoy Manor.” Harry said quietly, not meeting his eyes. “She means your old flat, apparently.”
“I’m not sure if you’re aware, Potter, but music and films are two very different forms of culture.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “You. Are. Mistaken,” he said in the most intimidating posh voice he could manage.
A round of cheers went up around the table. Harry grinned around at his former team members and made for the bar. The whispers followed him all the way there. He placed his order and tried not to make eye contact with anyone as conversation picked back up. That is until drunk bloke at a barstool swivelled right into his path.
Her mouth pinched tight, and she made a small disapproving noise. “Come and join us in the kitchen, you cow.”
“Er, yeah. And while he was sorting it out, the Magpie seeker caught the real snitch. Ref called the game and Farraux lost it. Started throwing hexes.”
“You don’t have to publish it, of course. I thought it might have more therapeutic value than anything else. Although if you pursued publication, you might get more space from the public at large.”
They glanced at each other, like they knew he would say this. Draco scoffed. They didn’t know him as well as they thought they did. No one did. He was unknowable. He looked down his nose at them.
“I feel fine, honestly.”  Draco straightened his apron and adjusted his posture. “I’m thirty one now and I want more out of a relationship than what he could give.”
“Careful, mate. If you don’t find some way to occupy yourself, Hermione will draft you into helping her with research.”
Harry wandered through Grimmauld Place absently. It never truly felt like his own. The renovations helped a bit, he supposed. Harry settled at the table in the kitchen with a disappointingly tepid cuppa. He half expected Snape and Sirius to break into an argument at any moment. Or for Remus to bluster in robes a mess. Perhaps he’d hear Mad Eye’s loud clomping gait. Instead, there was only silence. None of them were here any longer. Harry trudged up to the drawing room in search of some Firewhisky.
Draco made his way to the back corner table as he had done all week. Just after he sat down, he heard shouting coming from the kitchens. Olivia caught Draco’s eye and made a curious face. She peeked her head through the swinging doors and immediately ducked, covering her head. A metal baking pan hit the door where her head had been just a moment before.
Draco’s back ached. He was distracted this morning and burnt the croissants. He’d had to redo them and it threw off his workflow. Rav was in the kitchen with him all day today, which meant Draco couldn’t use magic. It left him exhausted.
Harry snorted. Then groaned as his head throbbed in response. He took a deep breath and threw his legs over the side of the bed. Harry waited a moment before trying to stand up fully. He heard, rather than saw, Ron leave the room and return a few moments later. At which point Harry felt a hangover potion shoved in his hand. Forget what he thought before. Best friends forever. Never had he loved Ron more than this moment. Harry necked it immediately. He waited while the steam came pouring out his nose and ears. Then heaved a sigh of relief and flopped back onto the bed.
Draco spent more time in the muggle world than he did in the wizarding one.  It wasn’t a situation he’d ever thought he’d be in. He had a muggle job, lived in a muggle part of London, and oddest of all wore muggle clothing.  It took a bit of getting used to. The trousers fit more snugly than flowing robes. He found the ease of throwing on a v-necked t-shirt ever so much easier than the layers required to dress for wizarding outings.  His father would be appalled, he thought happily.
If Draco had to watch Potter manhandle his girlfriend for a moment longer he was going to sick up.  The stupid Auror had the Weaselette pushed up against the train platform wall, snogging as though oxygen was a luxury and not the very basis of life.  It was disgusting. Uncouth. Draco wouldn’t be caught dead in such an unseemly position, in public no less.
Draco swallowed. He didn’t know if Potter had told Granger and Weasley about their.. Recent interactions. It terrified him to find out. Was it better or worse that Potter kept him a secret? Which Draco suspected he did because of the surprise and suspicion with which Granger greeted him.
The door opened and a muggle couple came in.  Pansy grabbed her own apron and trotted over to the table where they sat. Draco marveled at her ability to work an eight hour shift in heels. It was inhuman.
Harry didn’t know who this person was in front of him.  Gone was the little shit who looked down on the Weasley’s plethora of children.  Now it sounded as though Malfoy wanted to be a part of them. Harry didn’t know quite what to say. A small warm feeling began to grow in his chest.  Like his first taste of butterbeer, or the moment he first took off on a broom.
“Who?  Oh.  He’s alright.” Ron flipped the jewelry box over.  “It’s not technically a curse, so you could bring it to Hogwarts.  It’s permanent ink, though, innit.”
Olivia’s gaze bounced back and forth between them like she was at a tennis match. Jacinda wore an expression of bored acceptance. She got out her mobile and began tapping away at it.
A house-elf answered the door, looking just as drawn and haggard as the rest of them. The little elf led them silently to a room on the far side of the house. She didn't ask who they were or offer to take their cloaks. She didn't fall over herself to tempt them with tea or biscuits. She simply stared and then started down the entrance hall, through the dining room and portrait gallery, and expected them to follow.
points for the Firestorm Spell, which I'll be teaching this year, but I'm not surprised you either don't know it or didn't dare use it in a classroom. Alright, Miss Evans, have a seat. Let's see… Mr. Rosier, you were so enthusiastic earlier. Why don't you come try your hand next?"
His mother didn't like to fight. She had even given Draco her wand during that final battle at Hogwarts just to keep him safe.
Remus had grown up to be an exceptional wizard. During the Battle of Hogwarts… there had been so much going on, all of it so fast and so unpredictable. Harry didn't know what had happened during Remus and Dolohov's duel, but he very much doubted it was anything like the controlled conditions of a dueling club.
"Gosh-darn and blast it all," said Bowie, shaking his head. "They're not speaking either! We shall need fourths, if you are so cowardly that you wish to pass along your regrets for challenging me. I name Remus Lupin!"
"You're just a figment of my imagination," Harry told Draco, bracing himself. "Unless, of course, you died at the exact same time as me, and we're both here at the same time… which might explain Knockturn Alley, at least, but is also highly unlikely…."
As he made his way over to Harry, Harry couldn't help but remember the first time he had visited Ollivander's as a child. Ollivander had remembered James and Lily's wands, sold so long ago.
"Correct," said Bowie. "The Shield Charm will repel all but the Darkest curses, and it's always good to disarm your opponent first chance you get. Five points to Gryffindor. Alright, Potter, have a seat. Miss Evans, you're Head Girl, let's have you next."
"I don't think that's quite it," said Remus, once James had trailed off. He looked thoughtful. "He said he and Mallory weren't friends. I rather got the impression they were like you and Snape, actually." He nodded at James, who scowled in a Pavlovian response at Snape's name.
not to watch Sirius chase off his potential fellow Beaters with a bat that gives people wedgies unless they hold it
Upon seeing Harry, the Lestranges' faces twisted into taunting sneers, but Dolohov's went slack and pale.
Lost in the dementor's misery, he had forgotten Malfoy was there. He'd forgotten where he was— in the past, in front of the only people in the world who would recognize his Patronus's form for what it was.
"Hey, Ferret-face!" Harry shouted into the fray. "Quit taking the piss and finish him already! His arm movements are too big, and he keeps leaving his left open!"
"Right," said James. He clapped Sirius's shoulder and drew away. "I've got your back, Pads. We can do this. We're going to do this. Together. We'll be okay.
Much like Harry, Snape had been one of Dumbledore's tools in the war. They might have even been his two best tools.
"Alright, Mallory," said Sirius, raising his wand. "Your sense of humor is abysmal. Let's see if your wandwork is any better."
Malfoy and Dumbledore had insisted upon the change, given how much he looked like his father, who was now the same age as him, and they feared going red would draw too much attention to how much his eyes looked like his mother's.
Harry was far more closed off than any of the Marauders, including even Remus himself, and getting to a peaceful acquaintanceship with him hadn't been easy.
"I'm going to cast an illusion," said Bowie, "of a Dark creature or wizard. They will attack immediately. Defend yourself!"
"Me?" asked James, though the brightness of his answering grin might as well have lit up the whole hall. "I don't know why you'd think I would do something like this. Why, as Head Boy, I know we aren't supposed to
Sure, Potter Senior looked like a downright idiot, dumping raw eggs on the whole Slytherin table and getting into a fish-hands slapfest with his equally idiotic friend, but Draco couldn't see why Harry wouldn't like him. Harry was, in Draco's not so humble opinion, just as idiotic.
The war hadn't touched this Hogwarts like it had his own. Everything here was so easy, so simple, so safe.
It took Sirius a moment to stop shoveling blackberry tarts into his mouth to catch it, but when he did, he cast James a surreptitious thumbs-up beneath the table. Cheeks still as full as a chipmunk's, Sirius gave Remus's toe a stomp next to him, and Remus jolted.
"Ew, gross, no, no more of that," said Harry, pressing his eyes behind his glasses as if that could rid the image of Snape waxing poetic about his teenage mother from them. "Besides that, I'll still pissed at you. What were you thinking, casting that spell at Sirius? I've only ever seen Voldemort use that one. You could have
"Hey!" she called sternly. "Whatever you boys are arguing about now, cut it out! I'm not cleaning up another of your messes this early in the morning! Don't make me take House points!"
Malfoy glanced away, for all appearances unruffled, but his jaw was clenched and flexing. He still looked strange with his chestnut-brown hair. Instead of slicking it back like his usual platinum blond hair, he allowed it to fall loose, free around his face.
with Harry," said James, eyes brightening as they landed unerringly on Lily. "You didn't invite him as a…."
Sirius wielded his wand like a sword. His arms were a blur of sharp flashes, jabs, and parries. He advanced, step by step, never pausing his spellcasting even when it meant ducking or leaping over a jet of light. He was a raging storm of motion, never hesitating, never letting up.
"I will never regret challenging you, you gormless worm!" said Flitwick. "Harry Parker shall be my fourth!"
As the mismatched Gryffindor trio left, Harry turned to Malfoy and said, "You're not allowed to have a crush on my mother. I can barely handle Snape. I might really spring a leak if it were you, too."
The room was a small study about the size of a professor's office. The walls were lined in bookshelves and the odd magical trinket here or there, and the main desk sat facing the two large windows overlooking the gardens. There were no spare seats for guests.
"Done with your library work already?" asked Remus, glancing at the stout grandfather clock on the mantle.
And even though Harry hadn't been able to stand up for Snape in that awful memory in the Pensieve in fifth year, he was standing up for him now.
How could Draco Malfoy understand the cost of winning? How could he understand the responsibility and the guilt that had been laid at Harry's feet from the moment he turned eleven years old?
brought him the Prophet. He didn't know how he would react, especially sitting in the Great Hall of Hogwarts where he had spent six years watching for Hedwig with the morning owls, if some other owl started bringing him the paper instead.
"No," said Draco, and the word was bitter on his tongue. "It hasn't escaped their notice that… well, my ideals don't align with theirs."
Harry followed with a sense of resignation. It was going to be hard to hate Snape properly as a teenager, knowing what he would grow up to do. And— no, maybe Snape wasn't perfect; he hadn't exactly started off great, only wanting to save Lily from Voldemort's interpretation of the prophecy and forget Harry and James, but… but he had come around. Even knowing Voldemort would kill him if he ever found out, he'd done what he could to save the people he could.
Just as he would remember trying desperately to heal Sirius back in their dorm, too afraid of getting caught as unregistered animagi, too afraid of being forced to abandon Remus on full moons, to go to Madam Pomfrey. There had been a lot of blood.
"He does only seem to have two volumes," observed Malfoy, smirking. "Even in the common room. He's either the picture of a soft-spoken, well-mannered pureblood heir, or a screaming banshee. There's no in between."
his addled mind remembered Dumbledore saying of the shriveled, wailing baby under a bench at King's Cross Station. Was this another person's soul being tormented with which he wasn't supposed to interfere? Was this a representation of
reign. Gertrude died back in the seventies, while she was still a Hogwarts student, and then You-Know-Who wiped out her sister's entire family a few years later. The
"I'll come with," said Harry's mouth, before his brain caught up. He didn't know what look he had on his face— hopefully it wasn't as embarrassing as he suspected— but Malfoy stared at him, giving a single blink of surprise. Then he looked Harry up and down calculatingly.
He didn't know how he would react to a stupid Quidditch game. He didn't know if he would be able to keep himself grounded, if he'd keep his head and remember it was just a game.
James didn't know what to think, and he wished Remus would stop asking questions about every detail because that only gave Sirius more opportunities to cast Harry and Mallory in a negative light.
With great dignity, the lion hopped to the ground. His shaggy, golden head high, he sauntered away from the Slytherin table and straight up to the teachers' table. Remus provided the enchantment to make him purr, deep and rumbling in his fictional chest. And, like James's mother's dearly beloved cat, the lion slinked leisurely up to Professor Dumbledore and butted his massive head into the headmaster's chair, demanding pets and adoration.
Malfoy let out a startled laugh, and then he said, "Merlin, the sad part is I think you actually believe that. Was there a single year that went by
"Oh," said Harry, remembering. "Well, you shouldn't have said that about my mother, should you? Or Ron's."
Harry found himself fighting a blush of embarrassment as James glanced over at him, seeing he'd made no progress at all.
James nodded, already rummaging through his robes for a spare bit of parchment and a quill, Harry thought. Either that, or he was patting himself down very indecently in public. With him, it was usually a toss-up.
Tonight was the night Dolohov was set to meet with his contact at Everest Wands. (Draco wasn't stupid. He had decoded the parchment before surrendering it to
"Well, then, if you've got all the answers, where are we?" asked Harry. He didn't want to stand up to get a better look around, therein also giving Malfoy a better view of his ass. He wondered why robes hadn't appeared for him at his first thought, as they had the previous time.
An hour or so later, Harry found himself in Sirius’s old room. It was the room he avoided most. But tonight he couldn’t get the image of Sirius out of his head. Harry and his Firewhisky, the pretense of tea gone, explored the room he’d never touch while sober. The muggle posters of girls and motorcycles were the same as he remembered. How Sirius must have hated living at Grimmauld Place. Trapped by his family. Miserable. Alone. At least he had the Potters to escape to. At will. No bars on the windows here. Harry sighed and topped off his mug.
Harry ignored Malfoy’s comment. “Er yeah, Magic.” Dudley flinched. “Sometimes it skips a generation, but yeah. It runs in families a lot of the time.”
The bickering halted and three heads swiveled around to face him.  Harry gestured to Pansy and Roger.  “Just like this.  We were so excited to get our own place.  We got new furniture, decorated the flat.  And then..”
“Look Draco, you don’t have to stay in London. Blaise said your mum has invited you to France. Why not go see her? Get out of the country for a while.”
“Have you never done the shopping before?” Potter’s gaze was intense, as always. The green eyes twinkled at him. Draco found himself a bit warm, before the words sunk in.
“I’m just having trouble wrapping my head around seeing Draco Malfoy at Tesco. I seem to recall you saying something along the lines of ‘If you’re wondering what that smell is, Mother, a mudblood’s just walked in.” Draco had to hand it to Potter, that was a spot on impression of him. “Or do I have that wrong? Was that a different Draco Malfoy?”
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about running into Potter last week. Potter crept back into Draco’s dreams, something that hadn’t happened since adolescence. Draco dreamt of being chased by Potter. And when he finally caught up instead of fisticuffs and flying hexes, Potter shoved him against the wall and stared into Draco’s eyes with fiery intensity. Just before the dream got good, he woke up.
She gripped Draco’s shoulders and physically turned him round.  “What I was trying to show you is Harry Potter standing at that table” she whispered aggressively.  “Pretending to look at a book and he keeps looking up at you every five seconds.”
“Why can’t we get them something from Diagon Alley?” Draco asked.  The shop around them was completely baffling to him.  Something called Argos.  It was a strange mixture of vaguely familiar and utterly confounding muggle items. White boxes with stationary images packed the shelves.  There was the occasional grey box or black box.  Those ones had brighter stationary images on the front.
Harry’s head snapped up and away from Malfoy. He hadn’t even realised he’d been leaning in. Somehow, they were centimetres away from each other. He cleared his throat while Malfoy studiously refused to meet his eyes.
Harry shook his head. “I’d best be heading home.” He pushed himself off the wall and handed the glass back to Malfoy. “Give me apologies to Olivia and the other one, would you?”
They were in front of a fireplace.  Draco was holding a bouquet of flowers.  “When did you get those?”
The Cookbook had been Hermione’s idea, of course. Harry had always loved Mrs Weasley’s cooking. It seemed like home to him in a way Aunt Petunia’s never had, probably because he was allowed to eat his fill. Even when he cooked for himself with Ron and Hermione, it didn’t have the same atmosphere. It was The Burrow, surrounded by the sound of bickering (albeit lovingly) Weasleys, delicious smells wafting out of the kitchen. The way Hogwarts felt before the war. Home.
“You’re eating out of that pastry case?” asked Draco after she’d sauntered away. “Are you sure you’re not a Gryffindor?”
Harry rattled off his order, hoping it was enough for the Weasley clan. Mrs Weasley was providing most of the luncheon. Harry’s only job was to pick up the pastries to serve with tea.
“Why don’t we ever have mash?” Victorie asked Fleur, who was sitting beside Bill at the other end of the table. Harry couldn’t remember exactly how old she was now. Surely she was starting primary school?
Outside Harry began pacing.  Draco leaned elegantly against the door, watching him.  Harry could feel the judgement rolling off him in waves.
The rest was white noise.  Draco didn’t remember the end of the phone call.  Somehow there was a drink in his hand and a knock at the door.  Suddenly Potter was rubbing his shoulders and Draco was in the midst of the breakdown he promised he’d never let himself have. He’d not cried this much since sixth year so of course Harry Potter was there to witness it.  Harry Potter was always there when Draco was at his worst.
He needed a muggle to speak with. There was nothing else to it. He glanced around the cafe. More time must have passed than he realized, because it was nearly vacant. Empty table after empty table. Then a couple arguing about kindling or firewood of some sort while showing each other smallish black rectangles in their hands. Draco glanced behind the counter and found the woman from the previous day wiping down the pastry case. The thought of speaking with her was too mortifying. She caught him staring and quirked a small half smile at him. Draco lost his nerve. He downed the last of his coffee and tossed his rubbish in the bin on his way out the door.
Harry didn’t even remember standing.  Yet here they were inches away from each other. Both shouting now, breathing heavily.
“No.” Draco cut in.  “Just-”  What were they doing here? Other than drowning in mortification, that is.  Shopping.  They were shopping for Pansy and Roger.  “Shopping.”
“We were sweethearts.” Herb added.  They spoke nearly in tandem, the familiarity of the story flowing easily between them.
Harry moved down the line. He made note of the items that looked familiar either from Hogwarts or The Burrow. By the time he reached the register, Harry was fully prepared. And no longer worried his contribution would be underwhelming. Was he going to his ex-girlfriend’s engagement brunch? Yes. Was she marrying one of his closest friends? Yes. Did Harry know what an engagement brunch was? No. But that’s what Hermione was for. All he had to do was bring the pastries and convince everyone he was fine. Because he was. If he was lucky, Harry might convince everyone to play quidditch after. Although, now that Ginny played on a professional level.. Harry thought she may not want to spend her only day off the pitch back on the pitch.
“And you, Draco Malfoy, shall acquiesce to a tracing charm being placed on your person for the duration of the journey until such time as the DMLE is able to carry out the sentence given at the time of your trial.  This, given in good faith that...”
“Naturally,”  he said.  Draco himself was in a tight charcoal herringbone suit with black velvet lapels and piped pockets.  Draco was born to wear muggle suits, Harry thought.
Harry flipped him two fingers and set to work following Hermione’s minuscule and detailed instructions on toadstool fairing rings. He tried not to think about how out of place he felt in The Burrow. He would have never thought Ginny would have wanted a fairy themed engagement party. Harry supposed that was one of the many reasons she was marrying Neville and not him.
Pansy was still whinging about the dining set her married lover purchased with his wife.  Draco shook his head again.
Harry flooed to Grimmauld Place. The list of things Harry should do was extensive . He should write that article for the Daily Prophet Shacklebolt had asked him to do. Go over the schedule MaybeBridget sent home with him. Respond to Charlie’s offer to come visit Romania. He should go to bed, if he’s honest. Harry climbed the stairs to the top floor he’d converted to the master suite.
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan showed up with dates and stared daggers at each other.  Their breakup six months ago had been a loud row in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron.  Harry was a little surprised to see them both behaving civilly.  Another round of champagne smoothed over any lingering tension.
“My marriage was arranged, as most pureblood unions are.” she said.  Her voice was soft but firm, almost like a disapproving librarian.  “The women of the Black family had their spouses chosen for them if they desired to remain in the family.  You did as you were told or you were out.  That was the way of things.”  Narcissa paused and licked her lips and she shifted slightly in her seat.  “That’s not to say I wasn’t nervous.  My sister Bella found out who I was going to marry before I did.  She taunted me that he was hideous with warts, boils, and worst of all that he was of muggle lineage.  I knew it couldn’t be true but I had to see for myself.
Guilt spread through Draco like spilled milk. Not only had Blaise agreed to be the face and name of their venture, but he was letting his obligations to Draco encroach on his dating life.
You'd rather be in a passionless, political marriage than live with the man you've had the best shag of your life with?”  Harry wouldn’t put it past Malfoy, he was a Slytherin after all. “Just because of his job? Because he runs a bar? What? That’s not posh enough for you?”
“So what was Draco like at school?” asked Olivia, her eyes bouncing between the two boys. Malfoy slid into the round booth beside Harry. The pale blonde glanced up at Olivia when she asked her question and then stared daggers at his pint.
You want me to tell the public you’re doing the right thing. Pop in and show them we’re having a good time.”
“Fine.” Draco glanced around as well, hoping Pansy would rescue him.  He had no such luck. “I hear he’s fine.”
Neville smiled nervously back at him and nodded, his hands stuck deep in his pockets. Luckily, they sat nearer Fleur and Bill than Ron and Hermione or himself and… himself.
“I’ve always been funny.  You’ve just always been too much of a prat to notice.  Those Potter Stinks badges were brilliant.”
Harry grinned at him ruefully.  Draco came back in a moment later.  Harry watched him cross the room toward them and ignored the pounding in his chest.
Jean smiled at him like Draco was a child asking too many questions of a tired parent.  “Drake, this ticket cost me a fortune, don’t be ungrateful. I’ll meet up with you after.”
“How’s Jean?” Potter asked, his eyes darted around as though waiting for Jean’s sudden appearance.  Never mind the fact that Potter had obviously been watching Draco and Pansy for a few minutes prior to his approach.
One of the best parts of wizarding flats was their commonplace brewing stations. Blaise’s was spacious and, best of all, empty. He was too busy pursuing conquests to spend any time brewing. And if he was honest, he knew Blaise was shit at Potions. Always had been.
Weasley stood, evaluating the drawing board.  “How were we meant to get Merlin from a chocolate frog?”
“Right. Sorry.” The doors on the lift slid shut. Harry glared at the folder in his hands. Fucking Shacklebolt. He shoved the folder in his bag and glanced at his watch. Half past seven. Ron and the other Aurors would already be at the pub, celebrating. Fantastic.
“I am Draco Malfoy. Purchaser of chocolate buttons.” He grabbed a bag of said buttons from the shelf, threw them in with his shopping and strode off to the register, his head held high. He left Potter gaping after him in the aisle.
They stared at each other for too long. Somehow Potter had become more fit. Auror training must have helped him fill out his physique. Draco had been too shocked to find him outside the cafe the other day to appreciate Potter up close. His t-shirt fit significantly better than Draco remembered at Hogwarts. His jeans fit more snugly too, though he still had clearly never been to a tailor. The bottoms of his jeans draped over his worn out trainers, the backs of them torn to shreds from being stepped on constantly. Draco realised he just fully checked out Harry Potter and snapped his eyes back up.
“This is amazing, Mrs Weasley.” Harry said as he reached for thirds. She ruffled his hair as she passed by to refill the plate of rolls.
A smile crept up Harry's face, fond and awed.  He kissed Draco again.  It was the rough slide of lips and stubble.  It was the thousandth time Harry kissed him.
It was Lee Jordan announcing, of course.  Potter gave a little wave and the screen moved on.  Draco took some satisfaction in Potter’s discomfort at being singled out but it was short lived.  Just before he was off screen Draco saw Potter do a double take. Fuck. He’d definitely been seen.  The shaggy black hair turned about in the seat to face him directly.
Merlin, it was only a one day transport.  It’s not as though their trip would take Potter from his girlfriend for months.  Draco tapped his foot loudly.
What Harry remembered from that day was Malfoy’s reflection in the window.  Draco looked on the outside the way Harry felt on the inside. He thought about it every time he accompanied a convict to Azkaban.  The emptiness in his breathtaking eyes. Harry’s mind dwelled on the image periodically through the years. Particularly when Ginny was traveling, gone for days at a time and Harry found himself staring out windows, waxing maudlin.
"I don't think you fully understand wizarding relationships with muggle utilities, Harry.  I would hazard to say Arthur Weasley is the exception to the rule."
Granger and Harry shared a significant glance and laughed together. There was something odd going on with Draco's chest.  He made a mental note to make an appointment with his Healer.
“There’s nothing to talk about.  Potter was there, we didn’t get on.  And you know my history with the war.”
“Oh, yeah. It was mental. Got into it with a referee. They were playing the Montrose Magpies and one of the Magpie fans bewitched a fake snitch. Somehow it got past security and the Magpie fan made it fly down Farraux’s trousers.” Ron sniggered.
Olivia reached over and squeezed his knee. “Don’t worry, love. I’ve texted the owner. Do you think we should call 999?”
Harry’s stomach was fully in knots. Ginny took a nervous breath, glanced at Neville and with tears in her eyes, announced, “We’re getting married!” She stuck out her right hand to show off a beautiful ruby engagement ring.
The date was a girl this time, blonde and posh. Her eyes were, disappointingly, vibrant blue. It went fine. They chatted and flirted a bit. Normally, he’d at least have gone back to hers, but Harry felt uncomfortable about it for some reason. An unknown reason that had nothing to do with a pair of all-consuming and distinctly grey eyes that haunted his dreams. It was a mystery why Harry didn’t go home with her, really, if he thought about it. Which Harry didn’t, obviously.
Hermione joined Ron on the sofa and he shifted to lay his feet on her lap. The coffee table in front of them was covered with parchment and stacks of books.
“They were bloody terrified.  Looking between us. Finally Ginny realized I’m not going to let it go. She’d booked them a week ago.”  Harry took in a shaky breath. “I’ve never been so gutted.”
“After the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, I saw Vera again.  I was with some woman at the time, I can’t recall her name.”
“Bisexuality?” Malfoy asked, supremely unhelpful. He slid back into the booth with three pints of lager.
Draco coughed. “Ah, yes. Well…” He stood up and snatched them out of Millie’s hand. “Must get to the shower, if you’ll excuse me.” He fled the room, ignoring their snickering.
“Neville.”  Harry said, too brightly.  “I’m not a child you know.  I don’t have a problem with Neville.”
“This is precisely why I don’t date married men, Pansy.”  Draco finished up the bar prep and went over to his custom drinks board.  It was his favourite thing about Mood.
Draco caught his eye “Destiny is killing me” Harry grinned at him.  Draco felt like a helium balloon about to burst.
“Come now, Harry. You can imagine how helpful you would be. A little positive press for us, an enjoyable night of amusement for you.”
it was their own fault when their ears bled out. Draco certainly felt no compunction to warn them. Everyone with a cursory knowledge of wizarding history knew Caractacus Burke loathed music.
“I don’t want to be alone anymore.”  Malfoy continued. “I want to visit relatives and have family gatherings.  I’m still on the fence about children, mind you. But I know I want to be part of a family.”
Harry bit back a smile and was glad Mrs Weasley had joined the others to greet Ginny at the door, lest she hear her cooking was too hearty. He stayed at the table with Bill.
He sighed and rubbed his eyes under his glasses, waiting for Shacklebolt’s newest undersecretary to catch up with him. He tapped the door with his wand to lock it behind him.
“I had the, er, Unity Coalition meetings to attend during the Rookwood operation. Very important, unity.” Harry tried to sound believable. “They really need me to spread the message. It helps that I’m me. Speaking to the press on their behalf…” he trailed off, pushing his veg around his plate with his fork.
“You can be your own person, Harry.” She added softly and reached out to put her hand over his. She squeezed gently, “you can be whoever you want. It doesn’t have to be an Auror.”
“What?  When!” Pansy whirled on him.  She poked his shoulder with her red painted fingernail.  “When was this??”
“I think I’ve got to cut back on the drinking, to be honest.  Can I still work for you if I don't drink?"
“I get them too, you know?” Malfoy leaned his head back on the wall. If Harry turned his head, their noses would be touching. His heart started beating faster.
“Well, maybe when you were a child.  That’s not who you are now.  You have a muggle bar for christ sake.  You’ve covered your mark with pretty flowers.”  Harry's voice made Draco feel more solid.  Less like he was crumbling and more like he was being steadied.
“Did you say flatmate?” Potter shoved his glasses up by the bridge on his nose and crossed his arms. “You have a flatmate?”
“If you have any questions, just pop into the front. You are a lifesaver!” With that, she flounced back to the register to help the knitting ladies.
“With Martha?  It was alright.”  Uneventful, if Harry was honest.  She thought he was a street magician.  An assumption he failed to correct.
Harry allowed himself to be dragged by the elbow.  “London is huge, millions of people live here.  It was going to happen.  Inevitable, really.”
“I won’t do it,” Harry said. “I’m done! I’m a live human being, not a bloody mascot.” How long had it taken for nothing to change? Harry wanted to scream or cry in frustration.
His last thoughts were of a familiar pair of grey eyes boring into his own and an entirely different kind of heat overtaking him.
“You’ve already made that remark.”  Malfoy drawled. “I see your conversation skills haven’t improved over the years.”
Ron arched his eyebrows.  “Your brooms? Mate, I’ve been riding this Cleansweep since I was your age.”
Ron shook his head and shoved the journal back at Harry. He opened it and flipped through the pages. Shit. They were spot on. He’d basically written every thing Malfoy had ever done or said to him first year. With drawings. Drawings of Malfoy being a shit at Madam Malkins. Drawings of Malfoy being a shit on the Hogwarts Express. Malfoy being a shit about Neville’s remembrall. Malfoy’s shock at Harry getting a broom. He’d drawn that one four times from four different angles.
Dudley’s head swivelled between the two of them. “Have I stepped in it?” he asked, mild concern spreading over his dull face.
Draco waited until the doors stopped swinging before sliding his wand out. He started with the smoking oven. He vanished the smoke as soon as he had the door opened. Then he used a cooling charm on the tray so he could slide them out. Another flick of the wand sent the burnt tarts into the bin. The kitchen was spotless and in order within a matter of minutes. He looked around at the gleaming space, proud of doing something kind for a muggle. If it also benefited him, well, that was hardly his fault.
“Saint Potter, come to save the world. Saint Potter: only first year on the team in 90 years. Saint Potter, to whom rules simply do not apply.” Malfoy sneered. “Saint Potter the Magnificent who never gets detention.”
Ron vaguely nodded and tried to stand up straight. His eyes found Hermione and lit up. “Mione!!” He shouted.
Harry realized they were standing very close together.  Much closer than he anticipated. With Malfoy halfway down the step in front of him, Harry was ever so slightly taller than Malfoy.  The nearness of him threw Harry off balance. He lost the trail of their bickering.
Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry and inclined his head toward the entrance.  Harry nodded and began weaving his way through the patrons to the door.
Harry sent Kreacher to Hogwarts. He couldn't figure out another place. It wasn’t fair for Kreacher to stay on at Grimmauld Place, taking care of only Harry. Plus, he wouldn’t be lonely at Hogwarts, with the other house-elves there. It had nothing to do with Harry’s aversion to being constantly scrutinised.
Harry put out his cigarette and followed George’s lead by vanishing it. Unlike George, Harry flicked his finger at the cigarette to make it disappear instead of his wand.
“Wow, er. I..” Granger looked at his muggle clothing again. Eyed his muggle friend. “I suppose we could do that.”
“Don’t be silly. Have a cuppa.” Hermione said. She tossed a pillow at him. He shoved it under his head. “I’m so very tired, Harry.”
“I’ve had relations, Potter.” Malfoy looked around to ensure they were still alone.  “If you must know.”
Harry sipped his Firewhisky as he made his way to the glass wall and sat himself down in the claw footed chair. The back garden was overrun, to be sure. He should probably call Neville. Add that to the list of things Harry ought to be doing. He debated heading to the ground floor to retrieve his bag of loathing. Or he could summon it, he supposed. Breanne! That was her name. Who knows how many hours she’d put into his schedule. He really should give it a proper going over. Instead, Harry got up and poured himself another Firewhisky. He watched the rain beat down on the window that was also a wall.
Draco exited the room with the portrait and started walking quickly away. Harry watched closely where he was going. Draco’s name moved across the old parchment towards the astronomy tower, where he stopped. Draco stayed in the astronomy tower until Harry fell asleep.
Harry had tried to talk to Ron and Hermione about how ridiculous it was, but they were taking a different approach than Harry about coping with the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War. Where Harry was trying to avoid the limelight by more or less becoming a hermit in Number 12 Grimmauld Place, Ron and Hermione must have been making up for lost time or something because they usually had their mouths occupied by things other than Harry’s qualms with portraiture. Because he couldn’t get any backup, Harry begrudgingly agreed after many a conversation and owl correspondence to have a portrait made but with a few terms: The portrait was to be hung in a broom closet on a side hallway and nobody was to be told of its existence until Harry was graduated from Hogwarts after his eighth year.
They were sitting very close to each other. Harry felt like he was in a dream. He realized this was the first time he had ever talked to Draco without fighting. Suddenly, Harry felt even more brave than he had when he first came up the stairs. He turned to face Draco and put a hand on his chin, turning it towards him.
The eighth year dormitory was set up similarly to Gryffindor tower, but decorated very differently. The common room had a much more neutral color scheme and had the Hogwarts crest on the walls instead of the Gryffindor lion. Most of them weren’t paying the room much attention, and were instead focusing more on the fact that they now had to share a dormitory with students from other houses.
The two of them had tried to make it work again after the war, but it became immediately evident that it just wasn’t happening. Where Ron was coping with the loss of his brother by attaching himself to Hermione, Ginny didn’t want to deal with a relationship on top of her grief. Harry didn’t blame her at all and he himself was also not in a place for a relationship, so they mutually called it off and ended on good terms. That didn’t mean that things weren’t awkward between them, so he had seen little of the fiery red head since then.
“Harry! Playing in the big leagues now, even got yourself a portrait!” Seamus Finnegan half-shouted, patting Harry on the back.
Of course, rumors about Harry's portrait continued to circulate the school. After a few weeks of searching without any success, some of the younger students started trying to get answers out of Harry himself.
“Why is it always Malfoy? But anyway, I saw you! I didn’t hear anything but I got flashes of you in the doorway when you came in. Maybe tonight I’ll dream of whatever you told me?”
“You don’t get it though. You were always right. I was always wrong. People didn’t just think I was a monster, I was a monster! I still am!”
They headed up to their rooms to crash after the long train ride. Harry was struck by how normal it seemed sharing a room with Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. Harry relaxed into the easy banter with Ron, and into Dean and Seamus endlessly flirting, and soon found himself drifting off to sleep.
Eventually Hermione convinced Zacharias and the others that the only option was to try to be civil to everyone. Harry was surprised by how much she agreed with him, given her history with Malfoy, but thought that maybe she had come to the same conclusions as he had over the summer.
Ron left Harry sitting alone by the fire in the common room. Harry started to work on his Potions essay hoping that his friends didn’t decide that Harry was in fact just going insane. Suddenly, Harry saw red hair in an open doorway. Not clearly, but as though he were remembering it. He got a couple more flashes of a ginger while he kept working on his essay, not sure if this made him more or less sane.
“I can see everything that portrait sees. I can hear everything it hears. I get flashes during the day and then I see everything in my dreams.” Draco was silent, as if he was realizing just how much Harry knew.
“It was weird, mate. It was like talking to you, except not. It looked like you but only said what someone who didn’t know you very well would think you would say. It tried to disarm me when I came in! I didn’t do anything and there he went! Expelliarmus!”
“I don’t hate you, Draco.” The name felt strange on his lips after years of calling him by his surname. “I don’t blame you, you know. I probably would have done the same thing in your position.”
Now that Harry thought about it, maybe this was nothing new. He definitely hadn’t let himself think about it during the war, and he was busy dating Ginny anyway. But before that, Harry realized how often he watched Draco in the Great Hall over the years and how much the two of them had gone out of their way to get on the others’ nerves. As long as Harry was convinced that Draco was evil he didn’t let his mind go there. But now that Draco was repenting for everything he had done, Harry was finding himself in a surprising place. Draco was certainly very attractive.There was one problem, though. Harry didn’t like boys. Although now that was sounding like further and further from the truth.
“Whether you want to acknowledge it or not Mr. Potter, you have done more for our school and for the wizarding world than most any other wizard this century. It would be a pity for our school to not have you memorialized on its walls. Besides, our portraits can meet for tea every fortnight if they wish; it would not be lonely!”
Hermione got back from the library after an hour or so, seeming triumphant with a stack of books in her arms.
After that, school mostly went on as normal. Normal meaning like actually normal, not normal for Harry which usually involved facing Lord Voldemort or nearly dying. Eighth years weren’t able to play quidditch, but he made sure to get out on his Firebolt as much as possible. He usually played with Ron, and Ginny had even started joining them. In the eighth year common room, there was still tension between the Slytherins and most of the other students, but nothing had happened that suggested any shower jinxing was happening. Zacharias was always sure to broadcast that he was putting wards on the Hufflepuff room and that if anyone tried anything he would make sure there were repercussions. Harry wasn’t sure how to tell him that he was the one being ridiculous, and that the Slytherins were keeping to themselves.
“Harry’s right, we all have to get along somehow! Everyone’s just here to finish their NEWTs and I doubt anyone wants to keep thinking about the war.” Hermione added
Most of Harry’s ideas on what Draco might be doing had something to do with mocking Portrait-Harry or trying to get information out without talking to the real Harry. He had not imagined that in his dream he would be watching a teary-eyed Draco delivering a disjointed, emotional apology to Harry for all the terrible things he had done. Harry wasn’t able to recall every detail, but it was something along the lines of that Draco didn’t know who else to go to since he didn’t have any real friends and that Harry hated him anyway so he wouldn’t listen to him. He apologized for being a death eater and for doing Voldemort’s bidding and for being a prat all those years.
The next few days, Harry tried his best to avoid seeing Draco for fear that his face would reveal too much. Were people able to tell that every time he walked into a room Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off of him? He thought he was being subtle.
“I don’t even know why you’re so upset about the stupid portrait. You saved the entire bloody world last year so people would be talking about you, portrait or not. I doubt most of them even care about it.” Ron added, sitting entirely too close to Hermione.
A few weeks after Ron’s experiment with the portrait, Harry got another vision of an open door instead of the normal dark cupboard. He stopped reading his transfiguration textbook and looked up at Ron.
“Because I’ve been there. I have thought I was a monster and had people think the same of me. I have had my name slandered and my friends turned against me. I know how much it hurts. You need help. I can help you.”
“Well how about we hear it from one of them?” Zacharias shot another glare at the group of Slytherins
Harry placed his lips on Draco’s and kissed him. Draco jumped but then leaned into it, wrapping his arms around Harry and pulling him closer.
Harry’s head breached the floor of the highest tower in the school. He was struck by how different yet similar the scene was to the last time he was in the astronomy tower with Draco. Both times featured the blonde crying, but this time he seemed so much more vulnerable. Draco was curled in a tight ball sitting against the wall, sobs shaking his skinny frame. Harry walked up the final steps and made his presence known
“I welcome each and every one of you to Hogwarts, and this year more than ever I am so happy to see all of you safe. These past few years have been devastating for so many people, and I hope that finally we will have peace enough to begin to move on. I know that this year is going to be a process of growing, healing, and rebuilding for all of us. I ask that we remember those we have lost and the sacrifices that were made, but also that we do not dwell in the past. We must keep moving forward and to do that we must eliminate past grudges and understand that we are all rebuilding together.” Many wary eyes fell on the Slytherin table, who were significantly more subdued than Harry remembered them being in his younger years at Hogwarts. “I also ask that you treat everyone as equals and remember that everyone here is here to learn, regardless of their name or accomplishments.” At this, most of the eyes turned from the Slytherin table to Harry instead, where he stared into his potatoes. “Many changes have had to have been made this year, firstly I am your new Headmistress and Professor Flitwick the new deputy headmaster. We have new teachers in Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Muggle Studies, as well as changes to accommodate the lack of instruction received last year. Curriculums have been revised, and as many of you have noticed, there are many returning to finish their NEWTs. All eighth year students will not be living in their house dorms, but instead in the new eighth year dorms constructed in the South Tower. This will be a wonderful opportunity to get to know students from other houses, and it is imperative that you do so because we must stand together in order to rebuild. Division is what caused the war, and unity is the only way we can ensure we do not make the same mistakes again.”
His eyes darted to the fifth floor near the prefects’ bathroom and found the cupboard where his portrait was kept. Eyes widening, his suspicions were confirmed. Draco Malfoy, the map read. Harry wasn’t sure what to think. What could Malfoy be doing there? Harry figured he would just have to wait until that night to see what business Malfoy had with Portrait-Harry.
The next night, Draco was back. Harry sat on  his bed with the Marauder’s Map open in front of him. He wasn’t sure why he cared so much that it was Draco talking to his portrait. He wasn’t sure why he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Draco since he woke up that morning. He wasn’t sure why he was so fascinated by his shirtless body and how his light blonde hair fell in his grey eyes while he was in class. He wasn’t sure why it took so much effort to avoid him and to stop thinking about him. Bloody hell. Harry knew why.
“Well I’m sure glad I’m not crazy but that doesn’t make it any less weird. Thanks for looking though, Hermione, what would I do without you?”
Harry avoided Draco for the rest of the day, purposefully sitting as far away from him as possible in classes and trying not to look at him in the Great Hall.
That night, the dream was even more clear. This time, Draco started apologizing again but soon sacrificed words for silent tears before leaving for the night. Harry woke up feeling so much sympathy for him. How could he help him?
“Left you? What do you mean he left you?" She asked. She honestly looked confused, like she didn't know if I was telling her the truth.
Harry just grinned again and went back to playing with his phone. No matter how much Hermione pestered him, he merely shook his head, refusing to say whom was coming on our little adventure. As she continued to question him, I noticed that baby Rose wasn't in sight.
We drove in silence for about twenty minutes, before she finally pulled to a stop in front of a small brick building. As I climbed out of the car, I looked at the small building, feeling the magical tingle of wards that had been erected to keep Muggles out. “I'm guessing that this is a wizard bookstore?" I asked. Hermione nodded briefly, before pulling open the door.
He was right; I was close to my orgasm and with a few more strokes of his hand, I was spilling myself on the bed beneath me. Harry thrust into me a few more times before I felt him spilling his seed deep inside me. He collapsed over me for a moment, before he rolled onto his side without disconnecting from me and then he gathered me in his arms. He pressed a gentle kiss on the top of my head.
As we crossed the pavement towards the double doors, I looked around at the building. The building was a brick building, with yellow and black paint around the doors. On the glass of the doors, there was a logo of some kind of animal with a wing sprouting from its back. I was confused, as I had never seen anything like it. I glanced at the words above the doors. “Buffalo Wild Wings? What kind of a place is this?" I asked Harry.
“Blaise kissed me and Harry broke up with me," I said. Tears filled my eyes again and I buried my face against her shoulder.
“Well, you've said it yourself, nobody seems to trust you. Well, I trust you Draco. I want you to Top me," he whispered. His voice had gotten pretty husky. He reached up with his free hand and pulled me down once more. He kissed me again, catching my bottom lip between his teeth and pulling gently.
“You call that the easy way? Draco, Voldemort would have killed you and your family if you hadn't joined him. You know that. Nothing about Voldemort was ever easy," Harry said from behind me. He gently rubbed his hand across my back.
Unfortunately, that's how Ron found us. As Blaise ran his tongue across my lips, trying to gain entrance to my mouth, I saw Ron out of the corner of my eye. I opened my mouth and when Blaise swept his tongue in, I bit down as hard as I could. Blaise jerked away as blood spilled from the corner of his mouth. I quickly brought my knee up, catching him in the gut.
I wasn't aware of how long we sat there until Ron and Theo came up to us after getting off the ride. “Is everything okay?" Theo asked.
Draco's cheeks pinkened as he caught the meaning behind my words. I finished driving to the Manor in silence.
I glanced around the lift, but there was just the two of us. “Don't we need a member of the staff to operate the lift?" I asked.
“Get used to them,  Potter. Your moving into Malfoy Manor and we pride ourselves on our appearance. And since I know that Mother will have breakfast waiting for us, it won't kill you to look good."
“That's not something I want to see again," Ron said. I glanced over at him. He turned his back and placed Rose in her baby swing. He set the swing in motion to rock her to sleep.
I dropped my arms from around her as she turned to Harry. She held out her arms to him. He hesitated for a moment, then stepped into the circle of her arms. Like she had done to me, she smoothed her hand over his unruly black hair. I fought back a laugh, as his hair refused to lie flat. They dropped their arms about the same time.
I made my way to the bedroom. I pushed the door open and walked into the familiar room. I picked up a few of my things from the nightstand and the top of the bureau. I laid my things on the bed and turned to the wardrobe. I pulled open the doors and began to look through the items inside.
We sat there and talked about a bunch of different subjects. Harry and Blaise started a conversation about what they missed from Hogwarts. No surprise to me that Harry missed Quidditch the most. Pansy rolled her eyes at that, then launched into a tirade about why she had always hated Quidditch.
That seemed to break the tension around the table. Suddenly Pansy burst out laughing and I couldn't help but join in. It was like all of us, including Harry, had been friends forever. As we dug into the nachos, we all couldn't help but laugh at the way the cheese clung to the chips. As we ate, Josie was constantly bringing fresh drinks when they were needed; although, Harry and I weren't drinking ours as fast as the other two were.
I looked up at my arms and found that my wrists were tied to the headboard with a dark green cloth. I tried to move my legs and discovered that my ankles were also tied down. I looked at Harry to find him grinning wickedly.
“At first I said no, because I was sure he was still in a relationship. When he told me that him and Charlie broke up, I agreed to the date."
“Are you really that thick? Harry won't have a beautiful life with Jolene because he's GAY!!!" Charlie yelled.
“Absolutely, Mr. Potter," he said. He waved his wand and the lift shot downwards. Within moments, the lift came to a halt and the door opened. I emerged from the lift into the reception area. The medi-wizard began to walk away from me, going about his job. Before he got too far away, I caught his arm. He looked down at me. “Do I know you? You seem familiar."
“I'm gonna go make us some tea," I said as I finished tying my shoes. I left the room before I was tempted to pull him back to bed. I walked down our hallway and through the living room before reaching the kitchen. Walking over to the stove, I flicked the burner on underneath the kettle. While I waited for the water to boil, I pulled down two mugs from the cabinet. I reached up on top of the fridge and pulled down the box of instant tea. The kettle started to whistle and I flicked off the burner. I poured the water into our mugs and added in the tea. I flicked my wand to make the tea stir itself. I added just the right amount of sugar and milk to both mugs as the tea continued to swirl around.
I sighed. “I slept with Draco Malfoy. It was a mistake on my part, but I don't really regret it. If you don't believe me, here's a little proof for you." At my words, I caught the side of my shirt collar and pulled it to the left. Draco's little “D" shaped hickey clearly visible. Without waiting for him to respond, I twisted on the spot and disapparated.
“Narcissa, if Lucius was abusive to Draco, why didn't you ever take him and leave?" I asked, turning to look at her.
He turned his head and pressed a kiss to my forehead. “I love you too, Draco. Happy birthday," he said. We laid there just holding each other.
I slowly rose from the sofa, casting a quick glamour on my wrists. I left the others in the room as I walked out. I made my way down the hall and into his room. Harry was propped up against his pillows, his head dropped against his chest.
I took a deep breath, before I placed my left hand on his hip. He gasped at the flash of pain my touch brought, but he didn't pull away. I closed my eyes. I concentrated on my magical core and channeled all my energy through the palm of my hand that was on Harry's hip.
“In answer to your question Harry, I found out last week, when I got a burning, itching sensation in my groin."
“Because you and him need to have a serious talk. I know you don't want to hear what he has to say, but I want you to listen." She motioned Draco forward.
Hermione smiled at us, while Ron looked away from us. We sat there for a while, all of us just talking about anything that came to mind. Hermione finally got up from the couch and disappeared into the kitchen to make dinner. Draco snuggled closer to me, his hand burying underneath my hair. I rubbed my hand up and down his back. Draco didn't move from my lap, until Rose started to cry from her playpen.
I turned from the room and went back to the kitchen. I walked straight over to the door and grabbed my cloak from the hook. As I swung it over my shoulders, Charlie came into the room.
“That queso dip sounds good," I said, glancing down at it on my menu. I let my eyes travel over the menu. “Man, everything looks so good. I don't know what to get."
“Sure, unless you know someone else with the name Potter," Marko answered. His hand was still poised over the Firewhisky, waiting for me to decide if I wanted it.
“I thought that was my present. If not, can we have sex instead of a real present?" I asked as I forced myself up against the headboard.
“I was there to visit my mother. She'd been having nightmares and I took her to St. Mungo's to help her get better. I knew she wanted to talk to Harry, so I invited him up to her room with me," Draco continued.
“Why did you say it was alright for me to be with someone else? That seems kinda stupid," I said, folding my arms against my chest.
“Someone's excited about something," he said, placing his food on the small coffee table. He grabbed the apple from the air and placed it on top of his sandwich. He waved his hand and cast a Stasis Charm over his food, before he straightened up and turned to face me. “Why are you so happy?"
We finished up our meals, Ron practically shoving it all in his mouth, which was what he normally did. Draco got me to finish my food by threatening to literally feed me like a little kid. The waitress brought the bill over. I glanced at the price, then put down the correct amount, leaving a couple dollars for her tip. Just as the three of us rose from the table, Ron's cellphone began to ring.
“Too bad. You said you wanted to apologize to him and that's long overdue in my opinion. You should have apologized to him the next day, not a week later."
“Shut up, Potter," I answered. There was no bite to my words, which just made him laugh harder. I couldn't help but to laugh with him.
At that moment, the waitress reappeared with our food. She didn't even look at me this time, but placed our plates on the table without a word. She walked away as soon as she was done, her cheeks red.
“I didn't mean those words. I was very upset when Seamus told me that you had been in St. Mungo's. Draco, I don't want you to die, especially if it's because of me."
I let out a heavy sigh, and raised my head to look at him. “Well, Harry, right now I don't think there should be an ´us'," I said. Harry looked down, crestfallen. I reached out my hand and gently cupped his cheek, tilting his head so he would look at me. “Now, hear me out about this. I'm not saying that I don't want us to be together. I mean, come on Harry, I've wanted this since we were thirteen. But I was thinking earlier that maybe our problems developed because we jumped into being a couple too quickly."
Before he could kiss me again, I rolled out from under him and sat up on the edge of his bed. I kept my back to him as I spoke. “That Mark signifies what I am Harry; a traitor to the wizarding world. I took the easy way out, becoming one of his minions without a thought to myself. Without a thought to the pain I would cause others."
Draco turned his attention back to Charlie, the evil look on his face getting bigger. “You're in pain, aren't you Weasley?" He asked, sounding like he was enjoying himself.
“I really don't see how you can use that. It makes no sense for a twenty-six year old wizard to use Muggle things. Your phone, your car. Harry, I just don't understand it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper so we wouldn't draw attention to ourselves.
“I just cast a Muffalito spell. No one will be able to hear anything that is said in this booth. We need to talk."
“How about we tell you later when Hermione's around? That way we don't have to repeat ourselves," I said.
Suddenly, Josie stepped up to the table and set down a large plate of nachos. “Here darlings, my uncle said that these are on the house."
I looked up at him as he took the phone back. I stared at the fresh scars on his wrists, seeing them for the first time since I had moved back in. I looked up at him, meeting his eyes. “Where did you get that message?" I asked.
“Everyone at this table. I taught Draco how to use one and I know he taught Pansy," Harry said, a grin splitting his face.
Harry rolled over, but didn't wake up. I walked around the side of the bed and sat down next to him. I reached out my hand and gently shook him. He opened his eyes slowly, blinking hard. He sat up and looked around. He seemed slightly confused. When he reached up to rub a hand across his face, I realized what was confusing him; he couldn't see without his glasses. I reached over and plucked them from my nightstand.
“We’ll have it at the end counter in just a mo’ Mr Potter. Any coffee to go with?” And that was it. No hush fell over the room. No one turned about in their chairs to gawk at him. Beautiful. He breathed a sigh of relief.
They glanced at each other as though confirming a suspicion. Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “I guess I lost track of time a bit. I’ve been writing, though. Like you said.”
“I’m trying to move on, you know.  Why do you think I’m doing this?” he raised his right arm to Potter where the blue ministry seal was glowing mildly under his skin.  “I’m turning myself in for sentencing. I could have fucked off to France with my mother, you know. But I’m trying to do the right thing here.  I’m trying to start over. And you come in with your accusations!”
Draco felt his cheeks heat. “I appreciate your concern, but I’m perfectly fine,” he said, suddenly finding the sleeve of his coat terribly compelling.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d gotten Top Box seats at a quidditch match.  The Bulgaria v Ireland World Cup perhaps? Draco shuddered. He tugged the sleeve of his jacket down on his left arm and followed Jean to their row.  There was only one empty seat at the end of the row, the rest of the box was packed. Draco looked to Jean.
“Malfoy?” It popped out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop it.  It was definitely Malfoy. Jean had introduced him as Drake and he was dressed in muggle clothing but it was him alright.  “I thought that was you.”
“No, that’s not it either!" Draco half-heartedly shook Potter in exasperation.  "He called, and I knew what he was going to say.  We don’t keep up.  There’s no reason for him to call.  I knew precisely what he was going to say and I took the call anyway.”  Draco took another deep breath and sat back.  Harry gently wiped a tear from his cheek.  Draco scoffed.  “Merlin I need a tissue.”
"I'll have a chamomile, please, Hermione." Lovegood chimed in.  "It's excellent for attracting Flerble Moths."
“You sound like a bunch of Hufflepuffs.” he sneered. “I don’t need to be mollycoddled like a simpleton. I will be fine. I didn’t go to Azkaban with my father and I refuse to flee the country like my mother. I. Will. Be. Fine. Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he cast a quick tempus charm, “I must be going.” He straightened his robes and strode out the door.
Draco evaluated the clipboard with the baking schedule on it. He knew how to make about half the things on the list. It was only half ten in the morning and the clipboard showed the shift ended at noon. All that was unfinished for today was the steak and Guinness pasties. Surely he could handle that. He found a plastic folder with the method and ingredients listed. It read just like a potion, only a bit easier. Something bright and joyous began to grow inside him. He could do this and do it well. Maybe he’d get on as a muggle after all.
He nodded. There was no hiding now. She’s seen him. She’d addressed him by name. She was eyeing his trousers and t-shirt, his clearly muggle friend. Draco felt like an insect pinned to a wall under the severity of her gaze.
Shit, had he? Even so, if Malfoy felt anything toward Granger, it was guilt. And shame. And remorse. And very begrudging respect.
“Let’s go to the kitchen.” Blaise turned, headed out. Draco stirred his cauldron anti-clockwise eight times. He cast a timing charm to let him know when ten minutes had passed before he followed Blaise to the kitchen and his now empty wine glass. Blaise refilled it but didn’t pour one for himself.
“Er, no. We’re just..” He glanced at Malfoy ordering. Former rivals. Enemies. Pawns on opposite sides of a war neither signed up for. What was Malfoy even doing here with Harry? “Friends, I guess.”
Harry sighed. After all, he knew it was coming. He hated disappointing people. But Hermione was right (as usual.) He’d spent his adolescence as Dumbledore’s unwitting and then very witting pawn. He didn’t want the same for his twenties, though they were mostly gone.
“I didn’t mean Auror specifically, I just meant,” Draco gestured with his hand. “People integrated with society.  Aurors, journalists. Are you friends with any-” Draco stopped himself. “We don’t need to be friends. Forget I said anything.  Potter and I aren’t friends, end of story.”
“Alright, let’s get on with it.” said Potter, turning to Draco. “Hand me your wrist.”  Potter slid his wand out from his sleeve and tapped Draco’s wrist. He felt a cool tingling settle into his skin where Potter’s wand touched.  Potter unfurled a roll of parchment and read out the terms of Draco’s voluntary surrender. Years spent in litigation before his case finally went to trial before Wizengamot led Draco here, turning himself in. He tried to ignore the small crowd gathering around them.  Potter took longer to notice, but once he did, he put a stop to it.
“I told him I wanted all of it.  I want to get married. And while I may not come from the epitome of a wholesome family, I’m open to the idea.  At the very least, I want to be in a family. It was always just my parents and me.” Mafloy looked out the darkening window.  “I was so lonely growing up.” he seemed to come back to himself and gave Harry a chagrined half smile. “That must seem strange to you, but I was.  My parents had to pay people to get their children to play with me.”
Luc met Draco at his flat so they could Floo in together.  “You look lovely,” Luc said and kissed Draco’s cheek.
“Come lie down, have a nice cuppa,” she said. Harry traipsed behind her, over to the sofa, and tried not to feel terrible. Hermione’s eyes had dark circles beneath them. She was too tired to even remind Harry to remove his shoes. He did it anyway.
He could have sworn Malfoy’s eyes dropped to his lips for half a second before he disappeared.  Then he was gone and Harry felt as though he missed the last step on a staircase.
Harry nodded dejectedly,  “Which is just brilliant. So I asked her."  The crowd around them cheered loudly.  Harry waited for the noise to die down a moment, "she said she doesn’t know that she’s ever really loved me.”  Harry felt weak and tired, like he hadn't eaten in a few days.  He sighed and buried his hands in his hair, resting his elbows on his knees.
“Why do you keep following me?” Draco got out his pen and crossed tiger rolls off the list. “Are you lost? Is there a Granger and Weasley somewhere I can return you to? I didn’t realise it was even possible to separate you. Yet here you are, badgering me and they were nowhere to be seen.”
Ron stumbled over and slung an arm around Hermione.  “Happy New Year Malfoy!”  He glanced at Harry.  “Blimey!  You look posh!”
Potter kept his eyes on his trainers.  He gave another shrug, “What can you do, eh?”  he looked up at Draco, his green eyes intense.
He stood up and Harry followed him to the bedroom.  “Jean called and as we were talking it felt fine.  I knew he didn’t matter to me any longer.  I was well rid of him.  No romantic attachment left.”
“I’m an Auror and you’re turning yourself in for war crimes.” Potter went on, completely unnecessarily.  A simple “no” would suffice. No need to add insult to injury with further details. Draco hated Harry Potter, though not as much as he hated himself for still wanting the man’s friendship.  The stupid oaf spat another grape seed into the bin.
“Abused?  His parents bought his entire quidditch team new brooms!  He’s been spoiled his entire life! You were literally abused, Harry.  It’s not the same, mate.”
Ron scratched the back of his neck. “We, er.. We weren’t sure you’d be up for it, you know? Crowds and that.”
Harry could see his old Auror Team crowded around a couple of tables shoved together in the corner. Ron, with his new partner, O’Dogherty. Moran, Shepherds, Peterson and others lifted their pints. Harry could hear their cheers muffled a bit by the glass. Ron flushed and hung his head while O’Dogherty slapped his back. Harry chewed his lip. He should be in there celebrating with them. He would be in a minute, but it felt off. Harry hadn’t actually helped bring in Rookwood with the rest of them. No, he’d been at the opening of the new DMLE wing at the Ministry thanking the public for their contributions. Standing beside Shacklebolt and pretending his grimace was passing for a smile. Harry caught his reflection in the dripping window and saw the same look on his face now. Shit. He tried for a brighter smile, with any luck, one that wouldn’t be mistaken for nausea, and pushed the door open.
“I know you are. And I appreciate that, but don’t be. It’s fine. I’m fine. The situation is fine. Everything is fine.”
Draco waited until she was out of sight before rolling his eyes. He trudged after her to the kitchen, where she sat beside Blaise at the table like two disappointed parents who caught their teen sneaking out at night. Disappointed parents were something Draco was all too familiar with. Though the reasons they were disappointed in him were more severe than sneaking out. More along the lines of muggleborns beating him in every class at Hogwarts. Or showing revulsion in the presence of other Death Eaters at their cruelty. You know, normal teenage drama.
“Next day she’d thought about it and wanted to separate.  Just for a bit. While she’s away for the European circuit.  Then when she’s playing matches in the UK we can try going on dates again.” Harry struggled to keep from shouting.  “Wasn’t the whole point of marriage to stop dating? Why would I want to start over when we already love each other?  That’s bollocks!”
The crowd around them stood up cheering at the Cannon’s recent goal.  Harry and Ron remained seated, Ron gawping at Harry. Harry staring at the floor.
Harry shook his head rapidly, like a puppy just in from the rain.  He took a deep breath and finished the drink in his hand. Harry stepped away toward the door frame and Draco let his hand drop.
They were quiet a moment, and let the music wash over them. A few feet away Seamus grabbed Dean Thomas by the face and planted a giant kiss on him.  Draco spun them away when the kiss became intimate, chuckling.  Draco Malfoy was laughing at the drunken antics of his very Gryffindor friends. Something warm fluttered in Harry’s chest.  He thought again of the butterfly that had landed on Draco's shoulder at the start of the night.
Ron shook his head, still grinning. “I can’t believe you gave Harry homework. He’s only just quit his job.”
Hermione handed him the scroll. When he unrolled it, Harry found it was actually two pieces of parchment. One was a list titled Ameliorative and Productive Outlets for Harry. He smiled at it fondly.
Draco threw the door open and snatched the potion out of her hands. He downed in a matter of seconds. “Merlin, I needed that.”
Harry’s eyes found Malfoy’s and instead of the mocking he rather expected, there was a sad, knowing look that hit Harry right in the gut. Malfoy knew about nightmares. And he reckoned a little something of guilt, too. It was a lot for Harry to take in. Nothing about this day seemed real, least of all Malfoy’s empathy.
By the time Harry got to Mood freshly showered, there was only a half hour remaining before Draco was free.  He decided not to go for the Potion specialty of the Cheery Cherry Bomb and opted for a pint while he waited for Draco’s shift to be over.   Harry enjoyed being known at this place more than anywhere in Diagon Alley. Here he was the broody friend of the owner instead of The Chosen One.  It was a nice change. Fewer adoring fans and gobs of personal space.
“GINNY’S HOME!” George yelled. The Weasleys turned to the clock and saw that Ginny’s name was indeed at Home. George and Mr Weasley dashed out the front door to greet her.
“No, I was just getting it out on paper like you said.” Harry shrugged at the intensity of her gaze. “I dunno. Why are you staring at me?”
“That’s healthy, is it?” Draco said nastily.  “You’ll fuck anyone standing so long as they don’t know you!  And it doesn’t seem to help you get over Ginvera Weasley.  Why should I model my behaviour after yours?  You’re pathetic!”
“Oh.” he said.  Surely there were other words in the English language.  Why couldn’t he think of them? Harry ran a hand through his hair.  Draco was going on dates. Dates with people. “Er, yeah. That’s brilliant.”
“Malfoy.”  He said, tracing a finger along his jaw.  Harry’s eyes were even more green without his glasses. Green and brilliant and more intense than Draco had ever seen.  “Draco.  Tell me to stop.”
“Perplexing? Been to the library lately? Did hanging around Granger finally influence your vocabulary?”
“Oh, I’ve got a phone.” Granger answered hesitantly. She looked at Draco curiously, “Do you have a mobile?”
Honestly, Draco didn’t know which part was worse. That Potter had so valiantly spoken on his behalf or that he wouldn’t meet Draco’s eye afterward. It was almost a relief that Potter avoided looking at him. Almost. Draco didn’t know what he would see in those green eyes. But it wasn’t hatred, not anymore. And Draco didn’t know what to do with that.
Malfoy looked as though he had developed an acute headache, but Harry didn't see how that could have happened in the two minutes that had passed since he sat down.  Malfoy closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.
Draco peeked his head into the kitchens. The man he assumed to be Franc was shouting at his mobile. The area was an absolute disaster. Tarts splattered on walls, dough slid down the front of the industrial sink.
Harry found himself walking beside Draco Malfoy through Diagon Alley yet again.  It wasn’t what he’d set out to do that day but there they were. Harry had just left Ron and Hermione at a cafe with some other Ministry workers when he’d come across Draco leaving Gringotts.
Harry hadn’t even realized the match had started.  He could have kicked himself for letting Malfoy distract him.  One of Krum’s cousins fell ill and Viktor had sent Harry the ticket.  He never let on to Ron how much he and Viktor had kept in touch. Especially since Viktor never married and asked after Hermione each time they saw each other.   He’d been delighted for a seat in the Top Box. Harry normally balked at any sort of public special treatment or fawning. But Krum was a friend. And Harry loved quidditch.   Sodding Malfoy distracting him. Malfoy who looked incredibly fit in a t-shirt of all things. Christ, that blue hair.
The whole pub was watching them now, Harry realized in horror.  The server at the table behind them dropped her pen without noticing.  Draco threw his head back and gave one last satisfied, positively vulgar groan.  Slowly he opened his eyes to smirk at Harry.  Draco leaned in and whispered, “How certain are you?”
Draco foolishly let Harry choose the location which is why they were at a Wetherspoons instead of fine dining.  They ordered burgers and opted for bottled beer which was safest according to Draco.
The baby started making terrible noises. Granger heaved a sigh. “I’ve got to get home.” Draco caught her eye. “I’ll wait for your letter, Malfoy.”
Harry grinned at Malfoy again.  He wasn’t sure he knew all his letters at age five let alone spell the word family. “She’s doing better than I was at that age.”
“You pity me and you feel the way to save poor wretched Draco Malfoy is to come onto me.  Despite the fact that you’re in a heterosexual monogamous relationship.”
Granger’s sharp gaze flicked to Draco. “I was named after the daughter of Helen of Troy and King Melenaus. Are you a fan of Greek mythology?” she asked, still no smile.
Forty minutes later found him in front of the condiments, trying to suss out the difference between two seemingly identical bottles that had a 90p disparity in price.
Potter chuckled, darkly this time.  “Not great, as it were.” He stuck his hands in his pockets and gave an odd sort of hunched over shrug.  “I'm getting divorced, actually.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “I thought we’d say it was your application. And my name wouldn’t be on it.”
Draco reached out and put a hand on his shoulder to stop him from moving about.  “I’m so sorry, Harry.”
“Former criminal, you said.”  Jean got a weird look on his face, one that usually precedes an argument.
“Oh?”  Draco would never date his friends' relatives.  He’d seen what a nightmare that had been for Blaise.  Although Blaise was handsome enough that he pretty much never brought out anger in people anyway.  He could smile a way any ill will. Draco was not so lucky. He’d learned to stay clear of entanglements of that nature.
“Franc’s always had anger problems, especially when he’s on the outs with his girlfriend. But this is too far, even for him.” She finished hitting the mobile and slid it back into her pocket. She looked up at Draco in their crouched position behind the counter. “Think I should try to talk to him?”
“I understand your concern, sir. But it’s something I’ve got to do for myself. I’ve made my final decision.”
“Kreacher has Master’s breakfast.” “Oh. Right.” Harry ran his hand over his face and reached for his glasses. “Come in, then.”
For some reason, Potter wasn’t angry with him. Challenging, yes. But there was humour in those deep green eyes instead of the repulsion Draco conditioned himself to expect.
A hand at the back of his neck forced Harry to bend over his knees, the table shoved out of the way.
Draco hung his head and shuffled his feet, but allowed himself to be manoeuvred. “Think less ‘schoolyard bullying’ and more ‘torture by way of attempted genocide.’ I’m not sure a chocolate button quite hits the mark.”
Draco debated answering the call.  He could blame it on magic.  Mobiles were unreliable around magic, everyone knew it.    The phone buzzed again.  He could ignore it, couldn't he?  Draco tapped his fingers along the table.  It buzzed again.
“Really, this is too much, Potter. You can’t keep following me everywhere.” Malfoy drawled. At the mere sound of his voice, Harry felt as though a thousand doxies were let loose inside him. He looked up and found Malfoy leaning on the bar beside him, close enough that Harry could smell his cologne. It wafted over him and sent a shiver down his spine.
Right. So. Muggle London. Draco could do this. There was no doubt in his mind. He’d dressed Muggle. Sleek trousers with something called a blazer instead of robes. Draco had to admit a blazer sounded much cooler than robes. And he looked damned good in it, too. The dragonhide shoes he kept, as they were not too dissimilar to muggle shoes. He paused and glanced at his appearance in a cafe window. He did a half turn to see himself at another angle, proud of how muggle he looked. Proud of how muggle he looked.
Harry opened the door to let a couple of biddies encumbered with knitting things. Harry recognised the paraphernalia from seeing them strewn about at The Burrow. A few ladies turned into many. Which then turned into an entire knitting club. Harry found himself at the receiving end of a line of ladies. They patted his arm, telling him what a nice young man he was. While he appreciated the sentiment, it was throwing him off Hermione’s time table.
“Olivia?” he called out. No answer. He dug his wand out of his trouser pocket and cast a scourfingy. He was too tired for an actual shower. After he kicked off his shoes and spread out along the entirety of the sofa, Draco looked about for the remote to turn the tv on. The damn thing was on top of the tv. Too far to actually reach. The idea of sitting up to get it was unfathomable. Draco reached for his wand again, without moving his body.
“Michael Corner?” Pansy asked.  “I personally would never. But you haven’t got a problem with messy hair.  You love it.”
Pansy rolled her eyes.  “Of course you think that.  You’d wear clothes out of the bin if Draco would let you.”
“I’ll take that as a no.” Malfoy wrapped Harry in his arms, and Harry let it happen. Malfoy appearated them to a door front. It wasn’t Grimmauld Place.
Shopping. Shopping was easy. He could do it in his sleep. Nothing to it. Or so Draco kept telling himself. Next thing he knew, muggles surrounded him in a horribly bright shopping centre at a complete loss for what to do.
Harry didn’t know which of those answers would have been accurate. Cedric was a student who should have lived a long, full, and happy life. But instead he died and Harry couldn’t stop it from happening. He wondered again why on earth he was having this conversation.
They sat a few moments, appreciating the silence. Harry was halfway through his cigarette when George spoke up.
“Diggory was murdered on school grounds in our fourth year.” Malfoy said, as Harry floundered. “He died at the hands of a madman.” He paused and slid his leg under the table until their thighs were touching. “Potter here is mistakenly under the impression that he is at fault for Diggory’s death.” Malfoy’s leg gave a nudge against Harry’s. “Which is simply not the case.”
Bulgaria chasers had the quaffle.  They tossed it between each other, easily dodging the keeper and shot it through the post.
Ron shrugged. “So? Where else is he going to go? I reckon the Malfoys aren’t exactly welcome in Diagon Alley.”
“No takers?” Harry edged out of the booth and got himself another pint. Malfoy and Dudley sharing a pint was a bit much. Let alone swapping stories about Harry saving them. He didn’t understand their admiration. Harry was just doing the right thing. What he was supposed to do. He wasn’t anything special for doing that. Surely his two childhood tormentors would see that. They were the two people who saw the worst things about him. This meeting was a terrible idea. Why did he agree to it at all, let alone drag Malfoy?
Potter glanced at the watch on his wrist.  Potter had never accessorized before and Draco didn’t recognize it.  He must not have worn it at Hogwarts. Though, he may have worn it during the Battle of Hogwarts by the look of it.  Scuffed and tarnished, Draco would never wear such a dreadful thing. Were those scorch marks?
“Stop doing that.” The words escaped before Draco could tamp them down. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. No need to snap at one of the few people who still tolerated his presence.
Harry was entirely uncomfortable with the direction this conversation had taken. Never in his life would he have thought Dudley would be grateful to him. He wasn’t quite sure how to handle it. So he downed the rest of his pint. Like any normal, healthy person would.
“No, you’re always breaking the rules in the most mental way possible.  You rode a bleeding dragon out of Gringotts for pity’s sake. And now you’re going to, what?  Get married and pop out a few children? Buy a nice cottage in the country?”
“You’re not even using them.”  Harry plucked them from Malfoy’s lap and had a go.  He zoomed in on the other team. Their lineup was about even with Bulgaria’s.   Krum had more clout to be sure. It was guaranteed to be a wild match.
Indeed he was.  Potter ran a hand up the back of his neck into his mussed hair.  The shadow of a beard Draco remembered from the last time they saw each other had grown to a full beard.  Not too long, and it seemed much better groomed than his mad hair which stuck up all over, much as it ever had.
She brushed the fringe out of his eyes. “Bless you, Harry dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and let him be.
He heard Millie ask Blaise where Draco was headed before the door shut behind him. The truth was, he didn’t have an appointment to keep or a direction to head. One thing was clear: the Wizarding World was done with him and he with it.
“Realistically, do you think he’d actually throw the knife? Or..” he made a stabbing motion with his hand.
Granger blinked at him. The baby strapped to her chest began to ooze from its mouth. She absently wiped it.
“It started out with a kiss. How did it end up like this.  Harry?  Potter, I’m singing, you idiot.  You got your wish what are you-”
“I will gladly take this fiver,” she said, imitating his posh accent. Then she winked at him, “I’ll bring it over in a mo’.”
It bounced off the cushion onto the floor. Harry scooped it up and turned the tv on. He put the volume down low.
“I dunno, he just…”  Hary trailed off and dove for the snitch.  It was flying up around Ron's ear. Ron looked quickly around and tried to snatch it out of the air.  Harry knocked him aside and they both tumbled off their brooms a foot or so to the ground, laughing.
Not that different, indeed.  Draco glanced around the shop but no one was paying them any attention. He sighed and took the microphone.
Harry acquiesced to Hermione, setting him up with another muggle who she knew was a distant relative of some friend or acquaintance. He was going to have to have a serious talk with her about this new hobby. Harry didn’t think he could handle another rubbish first date full of small talk and partial truths.
“Draco, you’re such a prude.” Millie said. She was nothing of the brutish girl she’d been at Hogwarts. She’d grown into her body and Draco had to admit, it was impressive.
“Er, maybe?” Harry vaguely remembered an owl earlier in the week. To be honest, he hadn’t read past the words Engagement Party. The only reason he knew about the pastries was because Hermione mentioned it after he and Ron came back from the pub the other night.
“You’re fine, love.” he said, placing a kiss on Draco’s cheek.  They’d been seeing each other for a few weeks and it seemed to be going well enough.  Draco erred on the side of caution, but was hesitantly optimistic.  He was much more fit that the last date Draco had been on.  Luc’s dark brown, nearly black hair was perfectly tousled, a technique Draco envied but had never been able to achieve himself.  Luc also had beautiful hazel eyes.  In some lights they shone green and Draco was captivated.
Olivia cackled at him. “Tesco is only a few blocks away. Take this with you.” She passed him a folded up plastic shopping bag. “It should all fit in there, but if you need another one, they’re only about 50 p.”
“Course I am.  Most people in my position are.  People only want to sleep with me for the novelty of it.”
Obviously.” Malfoy was incredulous.  “Do you think pureblood marriages happen because of physical intimacy?”
Fully caffeinated and dressed, Draco and Olivia stepped out into London to get Nescafe. After his first disastrous run in with Potter, he’d stopped going to Tesco and started going to Sainsbury’s. But he let Olivia lead the way.
“Did I tell you I’ve been to Draco’s bar?” Harry mounted his broom and took off into the air.  The Cleansweep wobbled a bit and Harry had to be very firm in directing the handle. He should have brought his Firebolt.  Or at least get Molly and Arthur a set of new brooms for the grandkids to play on.
Draco looked up and found the window he had been admiring himself in belonged to a cafe. Filled with patrons. Who had just witnessed his odd behaviour.
“Yes, Harry, Yes!” He punctuated each yes by hitting the tabletop with his fists, each one louder than the last.  “MMmnnngh”
“YOU FUCKING CUNT.” Franc had a knife and Draco’s stomach plummeted. Was he going to throw the knife?
The cafe door opened and a group of old ladies with knitting supplies trundled in. They set their bags of yarn on the large table in the opposite corner that Draco normally sat in and began unbuttoning their coats.
Harry glanced over his shoulder and Mrs Weasley and Hermione sitting side by side. Mrs Weasley dictating and Hermione getting it all down. He felt a smile spread across his face.
Of course he knew them personally.  Potter had probably told them loads of humiliating stories about Draco and they all had a good laugh at his expense.  Naturally. Draco noticed the way their eyes wouldn’t meet his, the slight curl of the lip when he passed. He threw back his shoulders and put on the most contemptuous look he could summon to precede Potter into the private car.  Draco ignored the set of seats with shackles built into them. He strode to the back of the car where there were bench seats and sat by the window. Potter did some checks along the perimeter and spoke briefly with the other Aurors.
“He used to live by himself when he first got to London.” Olivia said, “Found himself a nice setup in Knightsbridge.” She leaned in and Harry mirrored her.
She stared at him and blinked. Her eyes looked about five times the size of a normal person behind her glasses. Harry was strongly reminded of seeing Professor Trelawney for the first time.
Ron and George spared Harry further admonishment by tramping through the back door. A line of freshly cleaned tree stumps followed them.
“Happy New Year.” Draco said.  They were a few inches apart and the space between them was soft and delicate and gathering heat.  The sound of people singing came wafting out through the open windows:
Jean and Draco were of a height, which made them an impressive pair when they went out.  All the more reason to look as muggle as possible. Jean was dressed in casual robes with his Daily Prophet badge pinned above the breast pocket.
They turned back toward the registers, and Draco stopped in his tracks. In the middle of the aisle was none other than Hermione Granger and her progeny. The child was strapped to her with some sort of cloth wrap. Granger’s hair was up in a wild bun. She looked nothing like the sleek attorney she was the last time he’d seen her.
“ALRIGHT NEVILLE?” from George in the kitchen, followed by Neville’s laugh. Harry sighed. He wanted desperately to be at Grimmauld Place with a bottle of whisky. And then immediately felt guilty for wanting escape instead of face his replacement like an adult. He was the one who couldn’t maintain an adult relationship. He shouldn’t avoid Ginny and Neville. It wasn’t fair to any of them.
“Actually, sir, if we could just go over a few of the dates. You are double booked on the 7th and 16th.” She flipped open the file in Harry’s hands and started shuffling through the parchment. “I’ve really got to go, actually.” Harry snapped the folder shut and stepped around her, headed for the lifts in the Atrium.
“Hogwarts.” Harry replied. His ears were assaulted by the scratching needle of the still spinning gramophone. He flicked his hand at it to stop the damn thing from moving. It didn’t work. Harry glanced around for his wand and got it from the dresser beside Sirius’s bed. He waved the wand, and the needle stopped its abhorrent scraping.
“Thanks for dragging me with you Harry.” Draco said.  Not an ounce of disdain or derision. Harry was struck again by how much Draco had grown as a person.  How lucky he was to have Draco as a friend.   “This was...” he trailed off and Harry realized he was staring at Draco's lips.
“Right.”  Harry said, and climbed the steps.  He found Pansy and Roger sitting on polished chrome bar stools in front of their white marble bar, each drinking a vibrantly green smoothie.  “Sorry about that.”  Harry said and scratched the back of his neck.  “I’m having a rough go today.  Shouldn’t have let it get the best of me.”
They stepped through the floo to the very modern flat Pansy and Roger had purchased.  Everything was clean lines and either white, chrome, or concrete.  There were no photos of loved ones, but there was an occasional piece of modern art placed in a corner.  And in the most prominent corner, by the enormous wall sized window was the most bizarre piece of workout equipment Harry had ever seen. At least he thought it was workout equipment.  There were two brown slats that could have been skis.  Some sort of pulley contraption.  Pansy Parkinson and Rodger Davies were standing in front of it clearly in the middle of a row.
Blaise was kind enough to let Draco impose upon him for a few months after the Manor was taken by the Ministry. Draco knew it couldn’t be a permanent situation, even though the flat was owned outright and money wasn’t technically an issue. He felt uncomfortable having to ask for assistance in any way. It felt wrong to owe someone, even a friend. But Draco had a plan, one that Blaise wasn’t entirely sold on.
“She went out with him first. Since the Yule Ball, actually. I dunno.. I think maybe we were looking for him in each other. And it was… too much.”
Molly sat down beside Arthur on the couch.  They smiled at each other in the way people who have spent their lives side by side do, communicating entire paragraphs in the blink of an eye, a half hidden smile.
“It started out with a kiss” Harry sang at him, a smile on his lips. “How did it end up like this? It was only a kiss.”
Draco did not explain there was just one head of messy hair that he found particularly compelling.  He thought of that quidditch match. Standing an inch away from Potter. He’d been furious with Jean for humiliating him.  And just reckless enough, he’d nearly thrown it all away. With Jean’s recent departure Draco began to regret not snogging the life out of Potter while he had the chance.  What would Potter have done? Hexed him on principle? Or shoved Draco against the wall and...
“I don’t think you do,” Harry said. “I think you want what’s best for everyone other than me. I’ve given a lot to rid the world of Voldemort and his followers. It’s no longer up to just me. It’s time for you to do your jobs and stop relying on me to gaslight the community into thinking you already are.”
The floo chimed from the main room of his flat.  Draco threw on his leather jacket and tucked a stray hair back under the beanie.  Just as Draco closed his bedroom door he heard Jean call out.
“Malfoy, want to get us another round?” Harry asked and pulled his wallet out of his back pocket. He slid Malfoy twenty quid and nodded at the bar.
“Oh, that must be it. Another school mate, eh? Sounds like Draco was quite a little berk at school.”
Malfoy’s eyes went to where Harry’s hand touched his shoulder and narrowed his eyes.  Harry sighed and let his hand drop.
“Yes! Back in a mo’!” she darted into her bedroom and dropped off the book bag she’d been carrying. A few minutes later Olivia came trotting out in comfy looking sweats. She shoved a pad of paper at him.
“Of course."  Harry averted his eyes.  "If  we’re both single next year you’ve got a date for New Year then too.”  Harry meant for it to come out casual.  But the words felt more significant when said aloud.  Somehow, without noticing, they’d moved their bodies closer together, dancing cheek to cheek.  Christ, Draco smelled good.  Harry had to physically stop himself from nuzzling into Draco’s neck, which didn’t seem like the kind of thing that friends did.  He’d certainly never had the urge to nuzzle Ron.  He heard Draco sigh contentedly and Harry's heart skipped a beat.
Creevy’s eyes widened and half a second later the shock became rage. Creevy’s hand went for his wand. Draco dared not reach for his own. In an instant Draco was up against the wall, bricks digging into his back, wand tip singeing his throat.
Once through the door, Harry ran right into a straggling knitter. Her yarns tumbled onto the pavement.
Draco tapped his wand against the slate board.  Glowing white lines shot out into a shape that very little resembled the image he was going for.  He pursed his lips and tapped again, a few little squiggles were added.
The smiles vanished from their faces. They helped each other up and stood to face him. Draco glanced around the cafe and found it empty. Franc’s shouting must have cleared out the other patrons.
“What do you mean you get tired of it?  Wait- you and the Weaselette split up?” Malfoy sat up in his seat.
Ron shook his head slowly and popped another bean into his mouth.  He chewed once before he cringed and spat it out. “Vomit.”
Kreacher’s sombre eyes bored through Harry. He cleared his throat. “Well, alright then. See you later.”
Harry smiled slightly at his retreat and turned toward the staircase. He took the steps two at a time up to his room on the top floor. He made quick work of his Auror robes and changed into his muggle clothes. After he ran back downstairs, Harry apparated from the steps to the alley beside The Drunken Doxy. Rain drizzled down and he cast a quick wandless
Millie arched her eyebrows at him. Draco was impressed by the difference addressing the unibrow made in her face. She looked, well, feminine.
“There you are, sir.” The young lady skittered to a halt outside Harry’s office. “I’m glad I caught you.” She huffed a couple of breaths before handing Harry a folder. “I’ve just got your schedule for next month”
“Jean and I never wanted to get married.  We’d talked about it a few times, mostly how abhorrent it seemed.  Married couples always seemed to be in a spat of some sort, most often about children.  Theo got married, you know. As soon as he produced offspring he and his wife stopped having sex altogether.  He told me they were too exhausted. Nappies everywhere. Waking up at all hours of the night.”
The hour of Blaise’s arrival came and went. Draco portion out the potion into 200 ml bottles and line them up on a shelf. He grabbed his wand and cast a tempus charm. Blaise should have been home thirty minutes ago. Draco wandered out to the kitchen. After having a glass of wine, he supposed he’d better start on the next potion.
Harry’s eyes roved over Malfoy’s somehow (magically, that’s how) perfect hair. His well-fitting muggle clothes.
They watched suburbs of London fly past the windows.  If Malfoy was so determined to be a prat Harry would leave him to it.  They could sit in silence for the remainder of the journey for all Harry cared.  Draco Sodding Malfoy and his complete misunderstanding of one of the greatest films in existence.
“You went a bit daft there for a moment. Just wanted to make sure you weren’t about to collapse or nothin.”
Potter’s eyes caught the badge above Jean’s breast pocket.  “I’ll take you over Rita Skeeter any day.”
Harry smiled hollowly at Ron. “Not this time.  It almost feels inevitable. My whole life has been a one catastrophe after another, why wouldn’t my marriage.”
His second week of leave he thought about Hermione’s lists again. He dug the Ameliorative and Productive Outlets for Harry list out of his desk drawer. Go for a walk. Harry glanced outside at the rain falling pitifully down. Pass. Do a puzzle. Get a book of sudoku. He skimmed down until his eyes caught on the Memoir line. Obviously, he wouldn’t publish it. Too much dark magic. Too much personal business. But she had a point. The mind healer he’d gone to after the war recommended journaling as a coping mechanism.
Olivia snorted with laughter. “Course not. This one didn’t even know what a mobile was! Can you imagine?”
Draco heard footsteps and spun to look over his shoulder in case Potter and Weasley came from the other end of the aisle.
A few moments later, he sat with this pastry and his coffee in the farthest corner of the cafe. Draco barely tasted them. His mind was racing.He had a sense of urgency rumbling beneath his skin. He had to make this work. How did muggles go about securing employment? What kind of paperwork was involved with letting a flat? In the wizarding world, it was a simple magical signature cast by a wand. Without a magical signature, how would they know who he was? Perhaps it was better that way, he thought. Did they cover this in muggle studies? Not that he’d have been allowed to take it at Hogwarts. So many questions and no viable resources.
“I’ve just thought- well.” She ran a hand through her mad hair and bit her lip. She glanced at Mrs Weasley. “I mean, I could help you, of course. I’d love to! I’d need to take notes.”
Olivia showed him the layout of the kitchen and the clipboard where the day’s baking schedule was kept.
No, Draco spent most of his post-trial years thus far tending to his mother. Looking after the Malfoy estate. Ignoring his lack of amorous opportunities. After a few years of back and forth between the Ministry and his solicitor, they’d come to an agreement about what the Malfoys would be permitted to keep. Draco still had that odious task to look forward to this week.
Creevy cast Draco one final scathing glance and then turned to leave. He strode off without another look. Draco finally looked up and met Weasley’s steady gaze. In full Auror kit, even Draco had to admit he was quite a sight. No longer the tall and gangly ginger he remembered from Hogwarts. Weasley had filled out, now broad and intimidating.
Draco sat at a table in the corner, near the back. He had a view of the entrance, but the place was dim enough that no one could see him looking out. Knockturn Alley wasn’t the most glamorous place to have coffee in Wizarding London but, Merlin forbid, he tried to appear in Diagon Alley again soon. Today showed just how poorly that worked out. At least none of the hexes landed this time. Draco tried to get into Gringotts last month and nearly had his arse hexed to pieces. Knockturn Alley, it was.
They smiled at each other and Kingsley turned to face forward again.  “Of course. So I left Roberta after the ceremony was finished.  Vera and I went for a drink.” Kingsley’s smile grew to encompass his entire face.   He gestured openly with his hands. “We were married after a month.”
A few hours later, with the party in full swing, Harry found his usual escape spot behind The Burrow occupied by George, who was packing his cigarettes.
Olivia and Draco stared at each other and burst out laughing. Draco knew in that moment they were friends.
"We were together for five years and marriage only came up once.  And that was during the breakup."  Draco practically shouted through his sobs.  "All this time I was fine because at the end of the day I wanted a family and he didn’t.  He said he didn’t want a family.”  Draco drew a deep breath and wiped his eyes. “But that’s not it.  That’s not it at all.  He just didn’t want those things with me.”  Draco felt wretched.  Like every fear of rejection from his family, from society was wrapped up and delivered in the most gutting rejection of them all.  "He didn't want me.  No one wants me, not really."
“No tea, then?”  Harry huffed a soft laugh, “Alright, darling.”  He wiped the tears from Draco’s face and kissed him on the forehead.  It was the third time he’d kissed Draco.  Harry didn’t pull back right away.  Draco looked up, a heat sparked between them.  The air was thick.  Harry’s face was hovering above his, a breath away.  He kissed Draco’s cheek like a question, lingering and hesitant.  Draco’s heart pounded in his chest.  He was sure Harry could hear it.  Draco turned his head to bring their mouths closer together.  Harry leaned in and this time Draco closed his eyes.  Harry’s lips were softer than he expected, firm and warm on Draco’s own.  Draco reached a hand up and pulled him closer.  His fingers sneeked into Harry’s unmanageable hair.
The remaining furniture seemed only to highlight how much had been taken. Most of Draco’s life spent either at Hogwarts or at The Manor, and he was likely never to see either again. Though, in his opinion, Malfoy Manor, much like the Malfoy family themselves, was tainted. Forever. Walking through the Manor now made Draco feel hollowed out. Gone were the days he could be delusionally proud of his heritage. If Draco never stepped foot on the place again, it’d be fine by him.
Harry managed to keep a believable smile on his face for most of the night. And anyway, the Aurors got too pissed to notice if he slipped up. Once Ron stopped being able to form complete words, Harry figured it was time to go. He slipped his arm around Ron’s shoulder and hefted him up.
Draco felt more comfortable at the Granger-Weasley residence each time he visited.  After his humiliating breakdown in front of Granger so long ago, Draco felt a small and delicate bud of friendship growing between them.  He’d never admit it out loud, but he’d always been something of a swot.  It was nice to have another like minded individual to discuss literature, philosophy, and magical theory with.  Honestly, his latest concoction at Mood had stemmed from Granger’s insistence that alihotsy leaves were more prone to producing mania in potions when they were harvested by those with a sunnier disposition.  Where as a melancholic worker harvesting alihotsy leaves brought the sweetest joy imaginable.  It had revolutionized his aptly named Giggle Water.
Draco nodded and took a quick peek in each of his cauldrons.  He’d hung up a chart beside each one with a detailed schedule of when each step of the potion needed to be added next.   So far everything looked on track.
“No. You were bloody perfect.” Malfoy replied almost accusatively. His voice went a bit odd, somehow both reverent and sullen. A heavy silence fell over the table as Malfoy’s words sunk in. He was studying his pint again.
Harry felt guilty about his “bed days.” They occurred more often than he’d like. He silently reprimanded himself for allowing his behaviour to slip so noticeably. “You didn’t have to do all this, Kreacher. I was headed down to the kitchen, honest.” Harry lied.
“It does?”  Malfoy paused for a moment thinking it over, then his confidence came back. He smirked at Harry, “It does, doesn’t it.  I am nothing if not resilient.”
Draco didn’t want to ruin this amicable conversation.  He cast around for something to ask, “How’s married life, then?”
Merlin, if they stayed here any longer, clothes would start coming off and imagine the papers, then.  “Auror Potter Attempts Procreation at Kings Cross.” Draco bit back a smile. As much as it would serve the tosser right, Draco couldn’t afford to miss the train.
Blaise leaned back in his seat to watch the young lady show off her ample behind. The amount of wiggle was more than strictly necessary for retrieving pastry. “It doesn’t look so bad from here.”
“You did.  And you said we couldn’t be friends.  So I don’t see why you’ve inserted yourself into my life again.  I can assure you, Auror Potter, that I am not ‘up to something.’”
“Amazin, it was. Course he didn’t know it was you till it come out in the papers later. A bleedin Dragon! Out of Gringotts!”
The server came to take Blaise’s order, and he bravely asked not only for a coffee but a cheese danish as well. She simpered at him and batted her eyelashes. It took ages for the words to make it from Blaise’s mouth onto the pad of paper. Draco wondered if she had brain damage of some sort. Blaise positively preened under her gaze.
I lowered my hands and placed them against his chest, pushing him back slightly. “Harry, wait. We're not dating right now, we shouldn't do this," I said, reluctantly.
“Oh, I think you and Harry would have gotten together eventually. I just thought I'd give you two a little push. So tell me, who's Charlie?"
I walked over to my sofa and sat down on the soft black leather, my damp hair dripping down my back. A slightly cold breeze slid across the back of my neck. I shivered, raising my hand towards the fireplace in front of me. “
“Why won't he talk to me?" I asked out loud. I wasn't expecting an answer; I had asked the same question several times over the last few days.
I took a breath and moved to the end of his table. He didn't acknowledge that I was standing there. “Hey Potter, what are you doing here? Wouldn't think someone like you would know about this place," I said in my usual sarcastic manner.
Ron rose to his feet and walked over to her. He sat down next to her on the couch and pulled her into his arms without a word. He mumbled something to her and rubbed his hand up her back for a moment. Hermione buried her face into his shoulder and let herself cry.
“I told you not to eat two and a half orders of chili cheese fries when we had lunch," Hermione's voice said from somewhere above me.
That got him to look up. He slowly lowered the book into his lap. “I guess I forgot about your healing abilities, even though you saved Rose's life yesterday."
“Hot chocolate," Draco and I said at the same time. All three of us, Charlie included, burst into laughter over it.
The choking sound coming from Rose's tiny throat increased slightly. Her little mouth opened. She gagged a moment, then out came what had been blocking her airway. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw...a ring fall to the floor from Rose's tiny mouth. Draco turned Rose onto her back and cradled her against his chest. Her cries quieted down. I summoned her bottle from the kitchen and handed it to him. He took it from me and when he offered it to Rose, her little mouth latched on to it easily. It looked so natural for him to hold her. Draco's own breathing was slightly ragged.
I smiled to myself, knowing he was talking about Harry. The chair on the other side of Connie was pulled away from the bar. A man sat down and said, “I would like a Royal Waterfall, on the rocks, shaken, not stirred."
Silence fell around us for a moment. Rose finished her bottle and Draco raised her to his shoulder to burp her. “How are you so good at taking care of a baby?" I asked him.
“Well, for one, Draco did just save our daughter's life. And for two, I've kinda been anticipating this since we back in school."
Harry has decided to move into Malfoy Manor. He also returns to Charlie's place to get the rest of his things. Draco tags along and helps Harry bring his stuff to Malfoy Manor. Harry gets a little shock about Charlie in the process.
Harry groaned, then he grabbed the bottle of lube and squeezed some onto his fingers. He leaned down and kissed me as he parted my legs a bit. I felt his lubed up fingers at my entrance. He slid a finger in and my muscles contracted around him. As he moved his finger in and out, I let my hand continue to apply the lubricant over his growing dick. I gasped as he added a second finger. He moved his fingers around my hole, stretching it wider. A third finger joined in and I about screamed with pleasure.
He grinned before pulling me into a quick hug. He pulled back and dropped his arms. “Good to see you Harry. You know, I was surprised to read that article about you in the Prophet. Never guessed you would be gay," he said.
I grinned. “Well eventually, I think we'll only have to worry about waking up in one bed." I reached out my hand through the curtains and grabbed my glasses from the nightstand. I slid them in place and reached my arms above my head and stretched. With a small groan, I fell back against the pillows. With a wave of my hand, I opened the curtains around the bed and let the sunlight pour through.
I wasn't aware of him climbing out of the bed, but the next thing I knew, his hands were on my waist and he was turning me around to face him. Without a word, he leaned down and gently pressed his lips to mine. I hesitated a moment, then I leaned into the kiss. Our lips moved gently against each other, soft and warm.
“I've done nothing wrong. You've got nothing on me, Hermione," he said, but there was a spark of fear in his eyes.
She led me into the bar and through the building to the bartop. I chose a seat at the very end of the bar, knowing I would be able to watch Harry better. Connie chose to sit next to me, not that I minded. There were two ladies behind the bar, one that was younger and didn't seem to know much about being a bartender. As the other lady began to pour a drink for Connie, the younger one stepped up in front of me.
Sanders raised her head and looked at me, then turned her eyes to Kingsley. He nodded at her. “Well, Lucius Malfoy managed to throw Auror Jensen against the wall and took his wand. He had somehow slipped out of his cell when Jensen found him. Almost made it to the end of the corridor before he was stunned by me," she said.
Neville helped me to my feet and I headed back towards my room. “I'll call Seamus and tell him you'll be late this morning," Neville said as he headed back towards the living room. I walked over to my wardrobe and pulled out a set of robes. I also pulled out a shirt and a pair of trousers. I dressed quickly, then headed out of my room. I met Neville by the fireplace, fighting nausea the whole way. Neville grabbed my arm and apparated us out.
With a groan, I pulled away from him. I reached for the bottle of lube that he had dropped on the bed. I squeezed it onto my hand and began to rub it over my fingers. Harry shifted his position a bit, giving me access to his entrance. I traced my finger around it, still not quite sure of what I was doing.
“Well, you must be in that rare category where you are naturally fertile. Your body is equipped for having children, and your magic is strong enough that you don't need pregnancy potions. Congratulations by the way," Dean said.
Sorry for the long delay. I've started work on another story, and I was dealing with a bit of writers block. I'm going to try to update more often.
“Kingsley will have a portkey ready at three thirty this afternoon," I said, shamelessly letting my eyes travel over his naked chest. Draco smirked.
He raised the glass to his lips. I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed. My heart seemed to speed up a little in my chest. He lowered the glass. “Whoa," was all he said. He slid the glass back to me. We sat there in silence for a moment as I raised the glass to my own lips. He shifted again, and I felt another brief flash of pain. I didn't say a word, and we finished our drinks in silence.
“Actually, yes I did. I couldn't resist because I don't think I could've lived with myself if you had died."
“It's only an eight year difference, Charlie. I don't care that you're older than me," I said, drinking more of my tea.
Hermione apparently followed my gaze, then let out a soft chuckle. “Who would have thought that we would find something created by Muggles that Draco and Pansy would enjoy?"
“Back off, Steve. He's mine, and I don't share," Harry answered, looping his arm around me in a possessive manor. He was still grinning, so I knew that the man was joking.
Harry and Draco go on a date. Draco finds out that Harry is living at The Leaky Cauldron. He makes him an offer that Harry can't believe.
Harry's voice pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked several times before I could raise my head to meet his gaze in the mirror. He was watching me curiously.
Ron and I followed his finger and saw Bill and Jason kissing deeply. Bill had Jason's shirt pushed halfway up his back, his hands roaming everywhere. Jason's hands were pushed up under Bill's shirt “Oi! Bill, knock it off!" Ron called out. Bill and Jason jerked apart, Bill quickly yanking down Jason's shirt. Jason looked around, saw everyone watching, and buried his face against Bill's shoulder. Laughter echoed through the room.
I opened my mouth easily as if our time apart had never happened. Harry groaned against my lips as he slid his tongue into my mouth, sliding it across my own. The taste of his mouth was cool and crisp, like the apple he had taken a bite out of. My breath hitched in my throat when he pulled me flush against his body as I boldly slid my tongue against his, then swirled it against his cheeks. When I pulled away to draw air into my lungs, Harry shifted lower and latched onto my neck, sucking on a spot just below my ear that made my knees go weak. His hands slid around to the front of my robes and he began tugging on them to undo the buttons.
“Minister Shacklebolt, yes it's been awhile since we last saw each other. And yes, I'm well. Are you?" I asked.
I raised my hand and gently touched the spot where his lips had been. I glanced at the bed and my heart filled with sadness now that he had left.
I tightened my grip on him and apparated us into his bedroom. I sat him down in the chair in front of his desk. He stared at me, his green eyes glassy and out of focus. I untied the tie around his neck and placed it on his desk. I reached out again and undid the buttons along his collar. I undid the few hidden buttons on the bottom of his robes before pushing the robes from his shoulders and then pulling them off over his head. I let the robes drop to the floor. I then reached down and tugged his shirt out of his waistband.
Harry said goodbye to Tom, then he turned around, caught my hand again, and tugged me out the door. “Let's go home," he whispered into my ear. A strange little shiver slid down my spine at his use of the word ´home'. I tightened my grip on his hand and twisted on the spot.
“Kingsley, who I date in my private life isn't up for a discussion right now. Just know that I'm happy and you know I haven't had many chances of being happy since I was one."
Harry rolled his eyes, but slid his belt through his belt loops. He fastened his belt, and placed the matching navy blue tie around his neck. I couldn't resist walking forward, grabbing the ends of his tie in my hands. I looked up into his green eyes as I tied his tie for him. I adjusted the knot against his throat, and stepped back before I could kiss him. He looked at me for a moment, then picked up the navy blue vest from the bed, the last piece of his clothing that I had laid out, besides his dress shoes. He slipped the vest on and buttoned the two buttons. He held out his arms. “Do I pass?" He asked, jokingly.
I watched as he stiffened, before slowly turning his head around to face me. “How much of that did you hear?" He asked me.
I read Harry's note several times, before I glanced over to where Draco and Chase were standing by the jukebox. I watched as Draco reached out and began to play with Chase's ponytail. I shook my head and turned back to the notebook.
He chuckled softly, pulled me down and kissed me gently on the lips. When I pulled away, I snuggled myself against his chest and settled back down to sleep.
He spun around to face me. His blue eyes were blazing with anger. “Why are you so determined to figure out where my bruises come from? And why are you accusing me of cheating anyway? Trying to protect yourself because You're the one cheating?" He snapped.
“I appreciate the offer, but no thanks. I'm not going to lie to him. I'm just gonna come clean. I just don't know how he will react."
“Still don't believe you," I said. I glanced around and noticed that the tavern was clearing out a little bit.
“Dra..Dra..Draco! St..st..stop it," he choked out. He was laughing so hard that I knew he was running out of air. He raised his hands, trying to push me away. I gave up tickling him as I caught his wrists and pinned them down to the sofa above his head. Before he could catch his breath, I leaned down and kissed him, easily sliding my tongue between his parted lips. Harry responded by sliding his tongue against mine. He tried to tug his wrists free from my grip, but he gave up and relaxed against the sofa cushions.
Harry spent lots of meals and time in the common room watching Malfoy and how he had changed. It was odd seeing him without Crabbe, and Harry felt sorry for him. He had lost a friend but nobody showed him any sympathy. In the hallways there were whispers wherever he went, the words “death eater” echoing in stone corridors. There were also jinxes sent at any Slytherin students with death eater ties, despite McGonnagal’s best efforts to make them stop.
One time, just after Harry dodged another question from a young Gryffindor, he realized something. He kept seeing the inside of a broom cupboard, which was probably where the portrait was being stored. What was strange, though, was that he had never gone and seen the portrait where it was hanging, yet he seemed to be able to see and hear what his portrait did. Harry didn’t know much about the magic of Hogwarts portraits, so naturally he went to ask Hermione.
Harry followed Draco around through the corridors and up the stairs all the way to the astronomy tower. He stopped at the bottom of the stairs and listened. Draco sat on the floor, sobs escaping his mouth after holding it in the whole way there. Harry stood and listened and debated what to do. Did he just stay and listen? Did he leave and give him privacy? Or did he go and talk to him?
“I- are those- did- I” Harry stammered, tearing his eyes from the boy’s stomach and up to his tired-looking face.
“Yeah I checked that the coast was clear before I went in. When I came out Malfoy was walking by but that was it. If he heard anything, at least he probably won’t go around telling any first years.”
The start of the school year was as normal as it possibly could have been. Harry went to class, which was different because he now had a lot of classes with the seventh year students. One thing that Harry had not predicted was the number of teenage girls who hoped to take advantage of the fact that Harry was single and ready to mingle. Apparently, being the savior of the whole wizarding world made him somewhat more attractive to adolescent witches than he had been considered in the past. Part of Harry wanted to say yes to them, but as Hermione often told him, “they only want you because you're THE Harry Potter, they don’t even know you!”
“Come on Smith, the war isn’t over until we stop fighting it.” Harry said, even though he was still slightly wary of some of the other Slytherins.
“You’re right, it wasn’t okay, but that doesn’t mean you can’t come back from it. The war is over Draco. I forgave you. It's time you forgave yourself.” Harry said, nearing a whisper. He was sitting down now, with his hand on the other boy’s back.
Harry had tried- really tried- to change her mind about this because he “just wanted to be normal now” and he “already had his name in enough history books and news articles that nobody would be forgetting him any time soon,” but McGonnagal was adamant.
Harry woke up dumbfounded. How could Draco Malfoy, the death eater, be giving tearful repentance to a talking portrait of Harry Potter? Harry wanted to talk to Draco about it, but then he would have to reveal that he had seen, which was the opposite of what Draco probably wanted. Instead, Harry decided to mind his own business and not embarrass Draco. That didn’t exactly go as planned.
Instead of reacting, Malfoy and the other Slytherins just glared at Zacharias and remained huddled together at the back of the group.
From what Harry remembered from his dream, Draco wanted to talk to Harry in person but he didn’t think he would listen. Harry decided to muster all the Gryffindor courage he had, take off the invisibility cloak, and climb the stairs.
“I think I might have heard of that happening somewhere! I’ll go to the library and ask Madame Pince for any books she has on magical portraits!” Hermione scampered off to the library, leaving Ron and Harry in the common room.
“I don’t know about everyone else, but I don’t want to have to share a bathroom with some people,” announced Zacharias Smith. “How am I supposed to have any peace of mind when I could be hexed in the shower?” There were noises of agreement from some of the other students.
The portrait was kept a complete secret, so naturally the whole school knew. The moment Harry stepped onto Platform 9¾, he knew he was right to worry.
“But how? I was terrible to you for years! I was a prejudiced piece of shit! I was a fucking death eater! Nobody else believes me that I regret everything! Why should you?”
“Oh you know, people talk. I think it's incredible though! I can tell my kids when they go to Hogwarts to say hi to Harry for me, imagine that!”
“Relax, Harry. Everyone will have forgotten about this by next week! Besides, you’ve dealt with much worse and you know it.” Hermione said after they found an empty compartment on the Hogwarts Express as an escape from the looks of awe and admiration from younger students in the corridor. One Hufflepuff third year had actually asked for his autograph as he was climbing on to the train, which made Harry walk swiftly in the other direction, leaving the poor thirteen year old empty-handed.
Where Harry was able to mostly block out the memories of the war while he was awake, he had never mastered the art of clearing his mind through occlumency so the nightmares still came full force. Harry got flashes of the Battle of Hogwarts and of his friends dying and every awful thing that he had seen during the war. This was nothing he wasn’t used to, and he took solace in the fact that these were just dreams and all of it was either in the past or just created in his own head, not by any intervention from dark lords. Harry had one strange new dream though. Nothing happened in it, just a clear vision of the inside of a broom cupboard. He could hear the voices of people walking by beyond the door, but he could do nothing to open the door or touch anything in the cupboard. Harry awoke the next morning thinking that that was a very strange thing to dream about.
“No it's not that- well, it kind of is- um just don’t think I’m crazy, but I think I can see what my portrait sees.”
Draco frowned and, after a moment, pulled out his wand. He approached Everest Wands slowly, at an angle out of direct view of the front windows. Hesitantly, he weaved his wand around himself in a disillusionment charm. Maybe the Aurors had closed the street after the arrest? But it didn't hurt to be cautious.
The tunnel behind the one-eyed witch statue leading into the cellar of Honeydukes was getting too small for them now, but James hadn't been able to think of another place Harry Parker was unlikely to interrupt them— the dorm, the bathroom, the Great Hall, the
He screwed his eyes shut and pressed the heels of his hands into them, trying to force the pictures out from behind his eyelids, but it was no use. He could still see Ron and Hermione. He could still
He crashed through the plates and half-eaten dishes, and his momentum saw him tackling Lily to the ground from behind.
"Yes, I believe so," said Draco. "It's not his handwriting, though. He wouldn't be so stupid as to write something like that down, anyway. It was probably his last partner, Watters-or-what-have-you. He'd have been tortured for not being able to keep up the information network in Dolohov's absence."
"What— what are you doing?" demanded Harry, struggling, as Dolohov turned away and surveyed the wreckage of the shop.
Malfoy's jaw clenched. He straightened his shoulders, the muscles going taut, and deliberately lifted his chin as he marched up to face Sirius.
Harry could see it the moment Lily understood the sensitive ground she'd stumbled onto. She had opened her mouth, bright and curious, then stopped as it clicked. If Harry didn't live with his parents, there was probably a good reason. And there was a war on— a war where Muggles and Muggle-borns were prime targets, and Harry had just admitted his mother was Muggle-born. Even if his father was pureblood, he had married a Muggle-born, and that made him a blood traitor, just as bad in some people's eyes.
How could he, a Slytherin, a bearer of the Dark Mark, trust and confide in Albus Dumbledore? It was ludicrous. It was…. He was starting to think it was
The Aurors had placed Anti-Apparition wards around the block so that Dolohov wouldn't be able to escape and, with Hermione's help, they'd made them one-way, so that wizards could still Apparate in but not out. They hadn't wanted to cut Dolohov off before he arrived, nor had they wanted to prevent their own backup arriving if they needed it.
Regulus ghosted from Harry's side to take charge of his Slytherin team candidates, directing them and the equipment toward the center of the field.
Malfoy might have been the biggest brat in all of Hogwarts' history, but he wasn't a threat. He didn't even register on Harry's danger-scale after having faced Voldemort and Dolohov.
"Oh, no you don't! Don't think I haven't noticed the state you're in, young man. Hop into that bed there. Quickly, now, if you please!"
"Nothing," said Lily, smiling. "You know, there's a Quidditch shop in Hogsmeade. Not as big as the one in Diagon Alley, but we might be able to find you a broom if you'd like."
His sacrifice, made from love, would ensure the Death Eaters upheld their end of the bargain, though. They wouldn't be able to kill Ron, just as the defenders of Hogwarts had been protected from Voldemort after Harry's death.
James knew he would remember the sound of breaking one of his best friend's ribs for the rest of his life.
It would be raging in 1978. That had been near the height of the Dark Lord's first reign. His father would already be a Death Eater. There was nothing Draco could do to change that.
"Not bad, Mallory," huffed Bowie, ending the dementor illusion. The whole class breathed a sigh of relief. "Five points to Slytherin for the save. Rosier, looks like you need a bit of practice. Knowing the incantation isn't enough if you can't perform the spell. And Mr. Parker,
It was either that or Remus was a target, too, for his role in staging the duel under the professors' noses.
Miraculously, oxygen rushed into Harry's lungs, and he drew a deep, invigorating breath. He let it out slowly, finally able to breathe without laughing, though a lingering giggle or two escaped. Exhausted, he nudged Malfoy and mumbled, "Him. Do him, too."
"If you thought turning down your first offer of alliance would be a show of power," said the Greengrass girl, "that was a poor choice. Rosier and Wilkes— those prefects— are at the top of the hierarchy. They'll make you pay for that."
, when Mulciber walked in, drawn by the shouting. Mulciber stopped dead, took in the scene, sniffed the air, and then abruptly howled in laughter.
, the three of them. Mysteries like this were their bread and butter. He'd never had a problem like this before without having Ron standing right beside him, a staunch supporter, and Hermione running several steps ahead spouting information at them as fast as she physically could.
"Come on, Pads," said James quietly, taking Sirius by the arm even as he gave Harry a concerned look. "They're about to start…. See you, Harry…."
The lightning struck the shield like boiling water crashing into ice. Steam billowed around them, scalding and thick. The force of the blow knocked Harry backwards almost into Sirius, but he ducked his head against the pressure and held his wand in both hands, giving the shield everything he had. Eventually, his feet stopped sliding backwards, and he felt the pressure bearing down on him lessen.
. Surely Madam Pomfrey will have something to set you right. What did she give you last time when you were going on about Dumbledore being naked in King's Cross Station?"
The breath caught in Harry's throat, and he took an involuntary step back— Dolohov's laugh, raising his wand—
Just like it was his fault they were all dead— his parents, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Mad-Eye Moody, Fred…
Peter sniggered as he twitched and flicked his wand, going after a girl who had called him a dunce on the Express a few hours earlier.
"Not now," muttered Harry, stashing both the Elder wand and Dolohov's in his borrowed cloak. He moved to the girl and knelt next to her. "Hey, are you alright?"
Perhaps Flitwick was tired from his flashy duel with Bowie; perhaps he and Bowie had arranged beforehand for the winner between them to bow out quickly and let the students have their shot at each other. Either way, Sirius managed to get a full-body lock on Flitwick surprisingly quickly.
By the time Harry could breathe and open his eyes without the world going dark around the edges, the flyers were in the air.
"I know," said Draco, taking a bite of bacon. "But I couldn't let that stand. What he did was despicable. And I meant what I said about him not knowing
"Great, then," said Bowie, taking one long, last drag on his cigarette before flicking it off the stage. The few nearest students scattered to avoid being burned. "Professor Flitwick, let's do a reenactment of this morning, shall we?"
She had never trained him until the summer after the Dark Lord returned, content to let Lucius and Draco enjoy time male bonding, probably convinced Draco would never need to seriously duel anyone in his life. When the Dark Lord returned, however, she had taken him out into the garden and proceeded to scare decades off his life.
"Speaking of the Three Broomsticks," said Sirius, also ignoring James and Marlene's duel-slash-food-fight, "we need to stock up on booze when we go out. We're about to be
The little balls of flames detached themselves from the candles and rose into the air. It took the students and teachers a few seconds to even notice, but then they quickly began "ooh"-ing and "ahh"-ing.
He saw Hermione race past him out of the corner of his eye, straight for Dolohov, who had broken off mid-sentence with the proprietor when Harry attacked.
"I understand why I can't remember," said Malfoy eventually, "seeing as I wasn't even in your House. But it concerns me that you can't even remember."
The plan, therefore, was to research a solution in the library, and meanwhile, in case they never found what they were looking for, at least create an identity they could use in the outside world complete with N.E.W.T. credentials. If they hadn't found a spell to return them to their proper time by the end of the school year, they were doomed to live out the rest of their lives quietly, not interfering with the events they knew would happen.
Even from the stands where Harry sat alone, he could see Malfoy's grin, sharpened by that familiar edge of competitiveness.
Then another Death Eater was on him, and he couldn't duel and rummage in his robes at the same time.
With nothing else to occupy him, he wandered down to the common room, thinking of sitting in front of the fire.
All around the table, Slytherins of every year were smirking knowingly to each other, jostling a neighbor in the ribs, or treating the rest of the Houses to predatory, superior looks.
straight," repeated James. "Not only are we going to fight Death Eaters, we're going to stand up to the regular arseholes, like that wizard Lily was talking about who was experimenting on House Elves, and gits who think werewolves shouldn't be allowed Gringotts accounts or
"A complicated relationship indeed," came Regulus's voice, still droll, as he appeared with crossed arms and raised eyebrows. "Sirius, it seems we have a genuine Gryffindor-Slytherin mediator in Mr. Parker. You wanted to know what we were talking about? I insulted you, and he came to your defense saying you were the best person to bear the name 'Black' in generations."
Harry eyed him and the Snitch warily. He knew James and Sirius were upset over how he'd helped Malfoy win the duel against Sirius. They hadn't exactly been shy with their grumbling the night before. Harry had heard a number of mutterings on the themes of traitors and shame and disappointment.
"Er—" he said, shoving the Cloak up his robes as surreptitiously as he could under the stares of the entire Gryffindor graduating class. "I— uh— what was the question? No, never mind. I really need to, uh, go. Bye."
Ever since they had met in Harry's third year, and especially later, after Sirius had fallen at the Department of Mysteries, Remus had always been enough. He wasn't Harry's father or even godfather, but he had always been a friend.
Unease curled in James's stomach, even as he kept his voice low and soothing. He hadn't seen Sirius wrecked like this since… well, since that summer after their fifth year, when Sirius had appeared on James's doorstep in the dead of night in the middle of a thunderstorm. Sirius had been ashen, his clothes soaked through, bloody and ripped, and shaking from the aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse as well as the cold.
"Look," he said bracingly, flailing his hands for effect. "It's just been one day. Let's not judge our new roomie just yet, alright? We'll keep an eye on him, make sure he's well. We'll go light on the pranks, focus on our N.E.W.T.s, and see if he comes around. And in the meantime, we have a map to finish. Yeah?"
He didn't know if he could do it. He didn't know how he had survived as long as he had without them by his side.
When Malfoy had asked after them and the catastrophic arrest, Harry hadn't been able to reply at all.
Dolohov didn't let the man finish. He threw himself backward, Apparating, and took Rodolphus and Rabastan with him.
"That doesn't make it okay," said Harry thickly. "They're old enough to know better. I've just turned eighteen— summer birthday— and when I was seventeen, I was worrying about… about much bigger problems than House rivalries and girlfriends."
He had gleaned over the past two weeks that the oddly-named gang was something like the predecessor to the Weasley twins in his time: Pranks were their bread and butter. The rest of the school knew to stay on their good side lest they become the next targets of a well-aimed Levitation Charm or bucket of hippogriff dung. Moreover, the rest of the school
As the two Marauders hobbled off to the infirmary, Bowie turned to the rest of the students and said, "Alright, you lot. Since the show's over, now it's your turn. Everyone, pair off. You'll be practicing your Shield Charms tonight, which all of our duelists demonstrated. Here's the wand movement again, and the incantation is '
Harry was tapping and rubbing the table next to the book, his gaze a million miles away. He did that a lot, both the fidgeting and the thousand-yard stare. He didn't seem to be aware of either habit, and Remus had been too polite to bring it up. Whatever issue Harry was struggling with, whatever he had needed healing potions and the first week off magic in class for, it was serious, Remus could tell.
"Of course, it is!" Harry snapped back, pushing Malfoy away from him with a hard, one-handed thrust. He was panting, his vision still blurry, but now it was a blur of red. "The last time I flew— the Fiendfyre was
Sirius threw his free hand in the air, a dismissive twitch. "He hides it with his fringe for the most part, but I've seen it a few times. Shaped like a… zigzag. Kind of a sideways 'M.' It's a scar from a Dark curse. I'd recognize it anywhere."
It had been bizarre seeing Ollivander so young, and he had cut off the man's speech rather rudely, but he hadn't been able to help it. It had been even more bizarre seeing a young, slender Molly Weasley pulling toddlers Bill and Charlie by the hands as she ran errands in Diagon Alley. Her hair had been in beautiful waves down to her waist, and, for a split second, Harry had thought it was Ginny.
He glanced down and saw the Invisibility Cloak draped across his lap, as innocent and inevitable as if it had always been there, as if he hadn't
Draco faltered. Duels barely required seconds, and that was mostly a formality. He hadn't considered needing a third. He hadn't exactly been subtle about his lack of respect for the other Slytherins and their egos. The only one he could think of was Elodie Greengrass, but he doubted she'd be willing to duel a werewolf for him if it came down to it. She was civil, she wasn't a saint.
"I don't care," said Harry fiercely. "If there's even a chance we can catch him, we have to take it. He could go underground any moment and we'd lose him forev—"
. Remus and Tonks, even with their newborn baby Teddy at home… they'd come back to Hogwarts to fight for him. They'd refused to give him up when Voldemort had demanded it, and they'd
James and Sirius froze, Sirius in the act of stuffing pudding down the front of James's pants and James in the process of shoving Sirius's head into the vat of pumpkin juice.
Malfoy would be horrified by the thought he and Ron could be mistaken for one another in any way, but maybe.
They couldn't see every angle at once, couldn't fight so many opponents with only each other for help.
"Ah," said Draco, and his look of confusion cleared. He nodded to himself once, decisive, and said, "You've gone mad."
"My family and I are from Britain," said Draco stiffly. "We only moved to America for a few years for my father's job."
Mostly, Harry thought bitterly, he and Malfoy had gotten to know Madam Pince best. She was even stricter and more difficult to get along with than he remembered from his own time. The one time Harry had dared to eat lunch while perusing a book, she had caught him and made him fear for his very life— yes, Malfoy and Dumbledore had done a fair job convincing him he was alive and in the past, not dead.
don't get to use him as another cross for you to martyr yourself on. God, I bet you didn't even know his first name."
As soon as the door closed behind them, Draco took control of the conversation and asked, "What year is it, sir?"
