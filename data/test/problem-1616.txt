“And he put lines because my handwriting always goes up on the ends, right?” Harry asked with a smirk.
“There’s always a catch, Harry. What is it? You already know I have nothing. I can’t give you money or things, everything I own fits in the trunk they stored while I was in prison.”
"He was saying it's a good thing you're such a good friend to me. I'm very happy to have you." Luna says, sounding like she's concluding a conversation rather than greeting Ginny.
Harry pours Draco some of his cat food and makes himself an omelette. After Draco has eaten a bit of the cat food, he hops onto the table to meow at Harry’s food.
The last of Draco’s old bosses - the man with no name - is rather quiet, keeping his mouth shut wisely.
“Of course, who would want to sleep near a war criminal?” Malfoy shrugs, unbuttoning his shirt. Harry watches in confusion.
Hello lovely future readers! Here's a good spot to take a break - get some water, go to bed, come back after you've seen sunlight:)
Bringing Harry backstage, he weaves through staff and aurors, who all look surprised to see Draco here.
Sure enough, everything is spotless. The nervous elves channel their energy into their work, and the sheer amount of polishing that has been done shows how concerned they were.
“Oh. I’m sorry. I didn’t follow the rules.” Harry realises, a bit baffled. “Uh, would you like to punish me?”
Greg and Astoria move the coffee table to act as a footrest in front of the sofa, then settle down with Draco between them.
"Greg said to give this to you to inform your beer purchasing decisions." He explains, setting both bottles on the counter.
“That’s good, good for you. I remember when I had a crush on Ginny Sixth year and everything was angst-ridden and dramatic.”
“Always.” Malfoy smirks, grabbing the bottle from beneath his pillow. It’s considerably emptier than it had been when Harry last saw it.
Malfoy sniffs, levitating a tray of various plants onto his counter, acting for all the world like he’s unaware of anyone speaking.
“That’s her. She’s recovered very well. No lingering effects. But that’s probably more of a testament to you than to the illness. She’s in her first year at Hogwarts now, and when I told her I’ve been getting my healing done by Draco Malfoy, she got so jealous, she sent me a Howler.”
“As far as we can tell, yes. They weren’t tied to Dumbledore the way the new ones were. Flitwick is checking them now.”
Draco traces the faint mark with his finger, frowning. He could’ve fixed Potter up without leaving a trace, but he supposes that’s what happens when St. Mungo’s has patients they don’t know how to treat.
On the counter, where it certainly wasn’t before, Harry’s fancy new toaster sits, already plugged into the wall.
to, then leave it in the kitchen by the sink. If I see it there, I’ll get Minerva on the line and she’ll be able to help you.”
“No need to comment on that.” Brutus says, taking a drink as he watches Potter move to talk to Scarrow.
“Considering getting some for yourself? You don't have lower back dimples.” Malfoy asks, finally looking at Harry over his shoulder.
“Uh… yeah.” Harry scratches his neck awkwardly. “I need your frilliest pink dress in my size. Well, doesn’t have to be pink but I prefer it.”
Once out of the room, he realises he doesn’t know how to get out of the house from here, so he takes the passage back up to Malfoy’s suite, then the portrait passage down to the backdoor.
“Oh, have you heard of how muggles deliver? They don’t use owls, a postman brings everything to the door.”
“Very debonair of him to let you borrow his.” She continues as Knox exits the kitchen to join Ashe and Draco at the table.
“Might as well be, you won’t see me for the next few days.” Draco shrugs. “Tell anyone who comes by that I give my regrets that I’m not being a better host.”
George sits opposite Harry, jumping between conversations easily and adding his two cents, occasionally asking Harry something or other about how things are going with work or telling him about something funny at the shop.
Blaise looks at Harry with an odd expression, touching the side of his nose and sniffing. Harry grimaces.
Easing himself into the water, Harry relaxes as the heat takes some of the edge off his nerves. He pulls Draco back again, sitting him between wide spread legs and deciding
“No. You’ll see me when we get there.” He says, tugging at the tie just over his arse. Harry looks away as the ties loosen the rest of the dress, and Malfoy shuts the door.
Once the muffins are gone - Draco eats four - he and Harry make their way back to their own room to dress.
“Unfortunately, I can’t do anything about the unidentified potions in your blood, but your body will take care of it within a week. If you’re still feeling their effects one week from today, please come back and see me.”
I am so close to being finished with the first complete draft of my dissertation. Just a few more days of work! Eeeee. I'm going to celebrate this occasion by watching The Mandalorian and The Witcher, reading a whole lot of fic, and doing nothing academic for at least 48 hours. If you have any recs for me to add to my reading list (Trek, Good Omens, Sherlock, Bond, HP, Check Pls, GOT) please do share! As usual, thanks for all the wonderful comments! I will try to answer them all at some point but for now please know I love and appreciate every one of them/you.
Anyway. If fic is your escape, I'm sorry to bring the real world into your happy place. I try not to, usually. Stay safe. Be kind. Love y'all.
I hope you're all having a lovely week! I don't know if I'll have time to dress up/go to a Halloween party this year :(. If anyone has neat costume plans, please do share them so I can live vicariously!
I have just started writing the FINAL CHAPTER of my dissertation (currently ahead of schedule!), I've been getting lots of excellent rock climbing in (see Tumblr for some A+ fall pics--I'm xiaq there as well), Deacon is reveling in the cool autumn air, and I've been baking lovely tasty (GF) things for Thanksgiving this morning (there will also be pics of those on Tumblr!). If you celebrate the holiday, happy Thanksgiving! If not, I hope you enjoy a perfectly ordinary Thursday tomorrow. And thank you for all the comments! I'll try to answer them on Thanksgiving since I'll be taking the whole day off from Diss work.
Until then, I'll be in Alabama at the farm (literally just arrived) where I will be making Many Delicious Desserts and Deacon will hopefully get to play with some baby cows (provided their mothers are OK with it). See tumblr for updates on the Deacon/baby cow situation as it progresses.
I'm so sorry for the delay. I will never teach 3 sections of freshman writing again because 80 students who need near-constant attention is far too many. Only a month to go in the semester and next semester I'm only teaching one freshman section and two upper-level sections. Relief! Please continue to be patient with me. The plan was to have this finished around Christmas and I'm still hoping to meet that goal!
I should also have a bit more time for fic-writing before the move and am going to try and get back on an every-two-week, possibly every week, update schedule. So. See you in two weeks or less! I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy and social distancing as much as possible. Love y'all.
Oh and 100000000 thanks to my beta/britpicker Zzledri who thought they signed up for 50k words and then had to deal with...this. lol. You are the best!
If you're a student or educator I hope finals went well and you're enjoying the start of summer. See you in two weeks!
If you commented on the last chapter and I didn't respond: You are amazing and I love you. I just have. No time. Sorry! See you in two weeks!
In work news: we had to move classes online last week due to a Covid outbreak (the athletic teams were still traveling and both the wrestling and football teams managed to bring it back to campus from matches/games. I think we had 80 something cases in one week, so they shut everything down). The move online has been pretty easy because I was prepared to move online much earlier in the semester, so that, at least, was simple!
Don't mind me, just making shit up RE worldbuilding, here. Mostly because "required physical contact" is one of my favorite tropes. Hopefully, it's one of yours too :D
This doesn't affect my workload, it just means I'm not having constant existential angst anymore. If you've been following me for a while, you probably shouldn't expect this fic to update as regularly as my past work. I don't have a buffer and writing a dissertation is (surprise) the most difficult and time-consuming thing I've ever tackled (and I thought qualifying exams were bad!). So apologies for what will likely be a slow updating schedule over the next several months.
I'd also like to share this very handy reading list for anyone interested: https://twitter.com/victoriaalxndr/status/1266829408268095493?s=20. I've read 80% of the books here and am planning to work through the rest over the next few weeks. I found Between the World and Me, Evicted, and Bad Feminist particularly eye-opening. And if you ever want to talk about any of the books on the list I'll happily hold an impromptu DM bookclub with you on Tumblr!
I've finished the first draft of my dissertation prologue! I'm giving myself the day off, and then I'm starting Chapter 1 tomorrow. The current plan is to have prologue-chapter 3 finished by Thanksgiving, so I can have the whole shebang (5 chapters) completed by March, so I can have April to prepare for my oral defense, so I can defend the first week in May, so I can walk in spring graduation. A year early. Ha. Haha. Eeek. Anyway. Pray for me.
In scholarly news: I have a stack of papers to grade about various comics, graphic novels, and mangas (I love my life). My dissertation prospectus was approved upon the second draft (hooray!) and I defend in August which is both terrifying and exciting. I'm also going to be speaking at Escape Velocity Con in DC the week after next (The fandom panel and the queer sci-fi panel), so if you're going to the con or live in DC and want to meet up, let me know! I love meeting strangers from the internet.
“Will it make you feel better for breaking the rule if I give you your punishment?” Harry asks, starting to catch on a little. Draco nods.
“I’m really glad. I hate sleeping without you, the bed feels so cold.” Harry says, lifting his arms so Draco can wiggle around until he’s comfortable.
Harry whispers, sounding far in the distance as faint buzzing fills Draco’s head. Harry's fingers stop, pulling out gently before Draco’s brain starts working again. He cleans Draco’s cum off his skin with a spell, then gets off the bed. Draco doesn't think to wonder where he’s going.
“Yeah! Yeah, George’s daughter, Roxanne, she got a broom from Ron and Hermione. We had to chase her down after she went flying off.” Potter says with a smile.
“I cursed a student, Katie Bell, to force her to deliver a cursed necklace to Albus Dumbledore’s office, which I was pardoned for. I also poisoned a beverage to deliver to Dumbledore’s office. Also pardoned for.” She ends quietly.
“Can- Can I borrow Harry Potter?” Malfoy asks, his back ramrod straight, looking like he’s trying to seem imposing with tear tracks down his cheeks.
“No!” Harry protests, falling back down flat on the bed. “Shit, Ron, why’d you have to put that image in my head?”
“Hi Alex, good to see you. I woke a bit late this morning, didn’t have time to get coffee.” Draco says, righting the jar of crushed apple blossoms.
“I asked you, if you Obliviated yourself. You always say 'I don't say things I don't mean.' But then you lie to me."
By the time Meredith has made her way over, Harry has chatted his way through most of one side of the room, greeting shallowly and sharing small talk. It’s pointless and infuriating, but he knows it’s crucial to the case.
“Not after I made you miserable at every turn? Not after I tried to have an innocent animal executed? Not after I… well, the war?”
“May need to use a bit from the Malfoy vault, I’m not as liquid as before.” Draco says, closing his eyes.
Harry waits for a bit with his hand in Draco’s, whose eyes are still fixed on a point in the ceiling. He reads some more, waiting for some kind of sign from Draco.
So he waits, listens closely to anyone speaking near him, watches for sneaky activity. After a while, he assumes Malfoy in disguise has already entered the party, but as planned has not approached him, and Harry wouldn’t know who to look for anyway.
, and Potter’s hair has taken on a mind of its own. Draco resolves to take his revenge out on it later, when Potter acts like he accidentally ran into Draco walking somewhere and they end up snogging in a corridor.
Hermione had stayed home with Rose, who’d caught a cough and given it to her mother, so only Ron had come. Both his parents were at home, but George hadn’t come tonight.
“I’m going to use Legilimency on you to see what’s wrong. I won’t look through your memories, only what you’re thinking about right now. Squeeze my hand anytime you can hear me talking.”
Harry spent his empty days with Ron and Hermione, sometimes joined by Ginny, Neville, Luna or their other Gryffindor classmates.
He denies ever having shoplifted (Honeyduke’s, years 3-5), making his bed that morning, being capable of plaiting hair (first Pansy’s, then his own when it was long in his late teens), and having been a Prefect while at Hogwarts.
“Ask me for anything.” Harry says suddenly. Draco tilts his head, looking back to what he’s been pruning.
“You’re not in trouble, Draco. I don’t want to fuck you to prove that, it’ll only make it more difficult for you to recover.” Harry explains.
After everyone had sorted out the presents beneath the tree, Draco stood, opening a snuff box he’d brought in his pocket. He drew a wrapped package from it, fixing the ribbon where it got rumpled inside the expanded snuff box.
Finally, Harry is ready to leave and sits to put on his trainers while Draco jumps onto his shoulders.
He continues as if there was no interruption, ignoring the questions from the chat, until Malfoy appears behind him, just barely in the frame, wearing the same thing he’d worn yesterday. Harry guesses he hadn’t been wearing anything and had changed specifically to come bother Harry about it.
“You’ve got such a sweet tooth.” Harry observes as Malfoy grabs a wide variety and passes it to Harry to hold.
“That’s for you to eat.” He adds, just in case it’s not clear. Draco nods, eating from where he stands. Harry is too tired to deal with that right now, so he stands with him. Draco eats slower, carefully.
Harry sighs, knowing Draco is right, but guessing neither Blaise nor Shannon is aware Draco is Obliviating himself to begin with.
“You’ve always been good in Potions, I’ve never really understood why. It’s not usually something a new student is just
With that, Harry plants a hand on Kingsley’s shoulder, and Malfoy puts his own on Mr. Weasley, pulling them aside like curtains as they step forward to face the most dangerous wizard in memory.
“Sorry, you enjoyed that? Two at a time? That sounds like a nightmare.” Drake asks just when Draco was going to move to the next person.
listened to you he would still be alive today. Goyle listened to you and he's alive. At no age have you ever put people you care about in danger."
“Oh, I’d nearly forgotten.” Draco says, twisting to reach the red, white and green crown from a bit behind him. “This is for you.”
Harry wakes up to the sound of a soft whine, a sound of distress, and he realises a moment later that Draco isn’t in bed.
Harry’s thigh is across Malfoy’s crotch, but with some more wiggling, he tugs his skirt free to cover himself again.
So the game is all very well and good but for the fact that it’ll take a marvellous trick of fate for Draco to end up in Potter’s lap. Which is absolutely a problem.
Honestly, writing these two clowns teaching together is such fun. I can't wait to post next week's chapter, I got a good laugh out of it lol
"It's not enough, though." Draco mumbles into his cup. "I still think like that first and have to stop myself. Sometimes I think of muggleborns as the slur because I've been so conditioned to think that word first. Or if I see an elf wearing clothes, I have to remind myself that they're all free now and can do what they want."
sort of headspace with quite a spectacular crash, spoiled the potion and humiliated myself in a matter of seconds, and not in a sexy way.”
Just before he joins Hermione and Ron in running, he glances over his shoulder at Malfoy, who’s still sitting, but looking tense.
He sits back, surprisingly at peace with everything despite having a very tender memory pulled up. Maybe it was knowing that Potter didn’t think the incident was quite so funny anymore.
Also I just got my hair cut and I have no idea what to do w it now ? It's been growing out a lil and now I'm accustomed to having it in a ponytail etc but now its like,, eboy length
After scanning through all of the aisles and trying to remember the various wizarding or muggle parties he’s witnessed over the years, Harry finally settles on a large candle, pointed party hats, a wide, dark green spool of ribbon and colourful confetti.
Draco is sandwiched between the two of them, a hard cock pressing into his arse and another against his own. The man at his back blows out smoke, and starts kissing the back of Draco’s neck and behind his ear.
His neck had finger marks bruised in purple. Long, thin white scars criss crossed his chest where Harry remembered them. A blurred bruise about the size of Harry’s hand sat in the middle of his chest. The black tattooed Mark on his left arm appeared.
“That… that one." Draco says rather frantically, hastily attempting to Vanish the ink spreading dangerously toward Pansy’s shoes. "Damn fuck! The- the one from McGonagall. The- it's-.”
“It’s also the last day of my holiday, then. I’ll be going back to work tomorrow, I suppose.” Harry realises.
Indeed, with Malfoy on top again, Harry feels like he’s laying in front of a very large fire. Even his cheeks are warm.
Draco stands up from the door, inhaling deeply and reigning in his expression from manic despair into something more casual, like annoyance. He tries to only look annoyed, anyway.
“Did I do something wrong? I’m sorry, I didn’t ask if I could finger myself. Is that against the rules?” He says, wide eyed.
After ten minutes or so, just as Daphne is making her way toward Draco with Isla and an expression Draco has come to fear, Theo spares him by shouting across the room.
“We’re not sure yet, it’s still in the beginning stages. I’ve been reading about how Amortentia customizes its smell by the person, if it’s something about the
Blaise turns a page, and Harry sort of wants to laugh, but mostly wants to flick him in the forehead.
Their classmates were buzzing about, getting refreshments, finding seats or chatting excitedly. There was a large stage a few feet off the ground at the back of the room, with black, green and silver decorations. Lights hung from the ceiling at differing heights, and the walls were covered in velvet fabric. It was very luxurious.
Malfoy doesn’t seem particularly surprised at that, but doesn’t return the sentiment. Only stares ahead without any expression on his face, arms squeezing around his middle.
“You can wear, or not wear, whatever you want to bed. Whatever you’re comfortable in. Do you prefer to sleep shirtless?”
“Uh yeah. I did. Fred. He was one of the twins, I was friends with both of them when we were at Hogwarts, and George has a shop in Diagon Alley that they both opened instead of finishing school.”
Draco exhales heavily and grabs his broom, deciding to walk the way back to the hospital to drop it off.
“When did you get your nipples pierced?” Neville asks, turning so he’s facing Harry, along with Malfoy’s indignant arse.
“Thanks.” Draco says, kissing Harry’s nose. “You’ve got to dress quickly before they notice you’re gone.”
“The colognes are meant to be sort of like Amortentia, changing depending on who’s wearing them.” Fred explains as if there’d been no break since he mentioned the new line earlier.
“Alright, if I give, will you lot allow the rest of the circle to play?” Draco asks, looking mainly at Ashe.
And then, the possibilities presented by the convenient handholds on Malfoy’s attire seem too good to ignore, so Harry grasps one firmly and drags Malfoy along behind him.
rules.” Harry says, looking up at him again. “What they did is called rape. It’s not okay. They assaulted you. It’s awful, and I’m so sorry you had to go through that.”
He clutches his cheek, not shocked at all, except maybe that it didn't hurt more. Honestly, Lucius can slap harder than that. And he knows how to make it sting.
“No. I do not need to shop very much.” Draco says, frowning at his notebook. “There are too many noises.”
“That was an accident, actually. I didn’t know human transfiguration would work to that extent, but I stammered over one incantation and suddenly-” He holds his hands in front of his chest, like cupping breasts. Harry chokes on his tea. Malfoy laughs more.
“Sure.” She says, opening her arms. Draco hugs her for a moment, and Marion gives Harry the softest look he’s ever seen on her. Draco steps back, and Harry rubs the back of his hand.
"Listen, Harry-" Fred says, but Harry slaps him across the face before he finishes. Not very hard, but still. "Ow!"
“I think Seamus would have my head, mate. I’d be more than happy to watch some of you lot get lap dances, though.” He winked.
He laughed for a long time, nearly hysterical with relief. His laughter turned to tears when Draco’s mouth twitched up slightly.
Once Harry had dropped Draco off with Blaise, who'd greeted him with a rather cocky 'Haz,' Harry set off to meet Neville at the same pub Seamus had his bachelor party at.
Harry knocks the breath out of Malfoy as he pulls back and snaps his hips in again. Malfoy’s arse clenches around Harry’s cock, and Harry groans loudly.
Smaller, paler hands would grip the dark grey bedsheets, would grope Harry, grabbing his hips and trying to pull him deeper, faster, harder…
Harry’s mouth drops open. He wraps his arms around Draco tighter, pressing his nose into his shoulder.
Harry huffs, remembering Smith on the floor. Then he remembers Draco pulling his feet away and looking tearful.
He holds his hand out slightly behind him for a moment, and right when Draco was about to ask what the hell he was doing, a tiny figure flew into his hand.
It doesn’t take long for Draco to heal the bones and resolve the muscle and nerve damage, though he takes his time to make sure everything is done perfectly. When he’s finished, he glances up to see Potter watching him intently.
Draco the cat meows, knocking the book out of Harry’s hand and taking a spot on his lap, meowing insistently and looking at Harry’s eggs.
"Huh." Harry says, squeezing a handful of lean muscle. Malfoy whimpers, nuzzling his face into Harry’s neck.
“No. It took time.” Ron admits. “But I am now, and I work hard to keep things that way. To keep Hermione no matter what, for Rose to grow up with the childhood we all deserved but didn’t get. I know we’re poor, and we probably always will be. But… it doesn’t bother me like it used to. We’ve got each other, and that’s more than enough.”
Harry licks at it, nipping along the lower curve of Draco’s arse. He pulls the cheeks apart to get a better view, and Draco’s hole clenches down, shifting the plug slightly.
hope of keeping Draco in your lives, I suggest you cut the Pureblood bullshit, or we’re both out the door without looking back.” Harry says firmly. “You showed us, last year, that we’re entirely capable of living on our own.”
Draco’s face flushes more, and Harry seems a bit oblivious as he grabs his robes off the chair back and rushes out of the room. Draco gives Ron a wide-eyed look and shuts the door, heart pounding in his ears.
Maybe he’s had too much to drink before he came out. He had some pre-performance nerves. Could happen to anyone.
McGonagall announced anyone wishing to pay final respects to their deceased outside the small family funerals should do so before dinner.
“You can dress however you’d like, but it’s probably better to wear clothes when we’re with other people.” Harry says, rubbing his eyes.
“Worst one-night stand…” Draco starts, a variety of very successful hookups flashing through his mind. “Mm. I’ve got one.”
She and Malfoy dance around each other as they sing, and the audience has started cheering and clapping almost too loud to hear their voices.
“Do you approve?” He asks with a little wiggle of his eyebrows, spreading his arms wide for Harry’s observation, Harry’s hand dangling from Draco’s. “Casual enough for Mister Harry Potter?”
“Well, we’re here, at my house. You’re safe. I’m not going to fuck you, or do things you don’t want.” Harry says firmly.
Several expressions flicker across Malfoy’s face before he settles on something casually interested. He releases a breath.
“I used to eat these as a child, I think they’re a muggle thing, I haven’t seen any here. But I like waffles, so I wanted you to try them too.” Harry explains.
“I know.” Malfoy says, though it isn’t egotistical despite how it sounds. He’s still staring at Harry like he’s shocked out of his wits.
Finally, Draco deems himself fully boiled, and they get out of the shower. Harry gives Draco a new towel so his notebook can stay in the old one. This one is a very pale blue, and Draco looks like a dishevelled angel, freshly scrubbed, blond hair in disarray, ink still on his nose.
“Is he always this clingy?” Hermione asks, still looking at whatever she’s working on, but smiling widely.
The little white gate is unlocked, and they step through. As they walk, Draco looks around the small snowy garden in the front of the house.
"What!?" Harry sputters, stumbling as he whirls back around. "Nev, that's big news, how was that less exciting than getting a new plant shipment?"
“I- well, I was going to stay here, actually.” Harry says blankly. “But I guess, yeah, I’ll go to the Weasleys.”
Upstairs, Malfoy leads Harry into a room that doesn’t look lived in at all, and opens a door to the closet.
“His do.” Malfoy says carelessly, and Harry grows a bit more anxious about sleeping in a house with a potentially vengeful Furby.
Pushing him back onto the sofa, Harry climbs on top, pinning Malfoy down and clutching at his face and hair - anything he could get his hands on.
“Oh shut it.” Draco giggles, standing on tiptoe again for another kiss before he pulls away to find his boots.
The club’s patrons look shocked and afraid. By now, Harry’s sure nearly all of them have seen Malfoy naked at some point, so it must look strange to see him fighting his own establishment’s employees.
“That’s wonderful, this is a good season for it.” She says. “What sorts of things do you ‘pamper yourself’ with?”
I really love the idea that Harry and Draco considered each other arch-rivals but their friends just sort of roll their eyes and play along with the theatrics.
“Dean, you fancy getting a lapdance?” Neville asked as Dean finished greeting everyone. Dean laughed loudly.
“Do you?” Harry asks. He moves his head a bit to look at Draco, who flushes slightly. Harry’s a bit taken aback by it, as Draco hasn’t been shy about anything since he started living here, aside from receiving praise.
“I have done nothing of the sort, I’m only expressing my disdain for my stupid flatmate who can’t figure out how to write a
“We were at the shop. Just got back.” Malfoy says as he hops onto the table and crosses his legs. “Is there dessert yet?”
“It feels weird. The idea of you missing more memories, even if they’re not really memories.” Harry says. “It’s not my decision, I know that. But… I just don’t want you to do something now that you might regret later.”
He hadn’t remembered upon first waking up here. Vincent was dead. His screams echoed in Draco’s memory.
Harry couldn’t stop pacing. He started planning the heist to break Draco out in hopes that it would distract him.
“It’s been a month since then. Come on, we’re going for a walk. I reckon you haven’t had fresh air in ages.”
As their footsteps fade, Draco circles his hips a bit more, rocking slightly, just to feel the tip of Harry’s cock nudge his prostate.
“I’m taking a year-long holiday. After school lets out, going to my cottage in the north. I’ll be in the muggle world but you’d like it. It’s interesting, and you wouldn’t stand out. No one will care who you are.”
Astoria was at the kitchen table with a large glass of orange juice, chin on her hand and looking grouchy.
“You know where my office is.” Draco shrugs. “Anyway, continue the game, I’ll just be here watching you all humiliate each other instead of me.”
"Again. What of it?" Draco presses, unwilling to defend himself again or try to explain his long thought processes if Potter's only pointing it out to make fun or condemn him.
“I’d like to take you on a trip to Italy. There’s a beautiful chalet there that one of Dean’s artist friends owns, and I rented it out for the second week in February. It’s in the Alps. Oh, and I cleared it with Blaise and Shannon.”
“I could barely get a word in, and I was so angry I didn’t even think of that.” Harry admits. “Hermione, you can represent him, can’t you?”
“Daphne’s out of town, unfortunately, so it looks like you’ll be stuck with two mopey Goyles today.”
“Harry.” Meredith says, a smile on her painted lips. Harry smiles back with as much charisma as he possesses. Meredith’s smile twists into nearly a smirk.
So when Harry is loitering by the bar, and notices another lady laugh uncomfortably and shift her arm away from the large hand on it, he doesn’t hesitate.
“You just going to stare or are you coming inside?” Malfoy asks impishly. Harry looks back up at his face with a start.
“Right, of course. I know how Molly gets when she’s convinced she knows best. So then where do we go from here?”
He takes some extra time before sleep to go through his pensieved memories - the Lap Incident, of course, the talk over coffee alone in the kitchen, Potter inviting him to go swimming and the subsequent embarrassing squeak, and a fun little collection of some of Draco’s more exciting fucks in the last year.
“There I was, being fitted for my robes, when who should come in but little Harry Potter, clothes askew and hair even worse than it is now.” He begins.
“Fuck you, Potter. So this bloke claims he’s already been domming for some time, so I went ahead and let him put me under, but he uh. He pretty clearly didn’t know what he was doing. Suffice it to say, not only did I not come, but I ended up extremely disoriented and he dipped out before I was back on top of things.”
“You’ve tried for sixty years, little Tommy.” Peeves croons, tossing another dung bomb at a Death Eater who’s approaching. “But y’can’t kill ol’ Peevsey!”
As arranged, Harry walks down the slight hill to enter the party first. He’s fairly certain Malfoy set the plan like this because he wants to have his Cinderella moment, but Malfoy hadn’t understood the reference when Harry tried to tease him about it.
“Oh yes sir, Winky is being cooking for wizards all over the country!” She says excitedly, scooping up the roast as if she’d never dropped it. “Mister Blaise is being very kind to us freed elves.”
“I’m alright, Harry. I expect I’ll look quite badass with all these scars, yeah?” She gives him a weak grin. Harry smiles back, pretending he doesn’t have tears falling down his cheeks.
“If I did well, brought in enough tips, they’d fuck me as a reward, and with Alpha, usually I’d get to prepare and use lube. If my performance wasn’t good, he’d ignore me no matter what I tried. The other bosses had scary punishments. If they were angry about something, they’d fuck me but I wouldn’t get any lube or prep.” Malfoy says.
“Correct. If it was an ‘identity thing,’ I wouldn’t use transfiguration, it’s difficult to maintain consistently.”
Narcissa brushes through Malfoy’s hair again, using the pointy end of the brush to part it down the middle.
ask them to make the food or more offended if he hired someone else to do it. They all agreed that Draco could stuff it if he thought anyone else could make a better wedding dinner than the four of them.
He’s likely older than Draco’s own father, with grey hair thinning in the back and wrinkles between his brows.
about, Potter?” Malfoy taunts, muffled as he pulls his shirt off. He shoves it under the seat when it nearly blows away.
“Are you tired?” Harry asks the lump on his sofa. Draco’s eyes blink open, and his voice is muffled from under his blanket.
Draco, as if he’s completely unaware of being moved around, mechanically lifts the sandwich to his mouth and takes a bite.
“I want you to pay attention to me.” Malfoy pants, shifting again as Harry sends more magic through his glowing aura. “I want you to make me lose my mind so all I can think about is
The moving picture was a blur - noises and soft laughter from the telly and from his friends, but Draco didn’t know the first thing that had happened in it.
He drinks a cup himself, looking at Harry for a moment. Harry distantly notices that Malfoy blinks a lot. He wonders if those huge eyes see better, or different things maybe, like Mad-Eye’s magical eye did.
“I’ll read aloud.” Draco suggests, and Harry doesn’t object, so he starts at the beginning of the chapter on nocturnal plants.
“He does that because he really means it.” Harry explains. It’s obvious that Zabini was very worried for Draco and genuinely wants to help him recover. Maybe he’s not so terrible after all.
It’s far more than Draco had initially planned on revealing - which was nothing - but once he’d started, it felt like he couldn’t stop.
“I very much doubt I’ll be let out of the castle now that I don’t have general immunity to evildoers. Even if I had gone back to my relatives’, I’m seventeen now so my mum’s protection is gone.”
“There it is. Come on, little baby. Perfect. Such a messy little baby. Show me how much you like getting fucked.”
Ron brings the blueprint of the building over and Draco points shakily at a few spots, which Ron notes.
“I wasn’t, I learned that from Snape, he wrote it into the book I had one year. That was the only year I got half-decent marks in Potions.” Harry explains.
“Yeah, Ron and Hermione - they’re dating - they’ve got a trip planned to go find Hermione’s parents in Australia.”
“Hey. Are you starting to feel better?” Squeeze. “Okay. Let me know when you feel ready to talk again.” Squeeze.
Harry had asked Celeste and a few of his other more talented friends to help him learn to wrap things properly. Draco’s gifts to Harry are nearly always wrapped in the most beautiful packaging.
senior.” Malfoy says easily. “I wasn’t going to mention it. But since you brought it up, I’d also be interested in a demonstration of skills.”
“Well, I don’t see the point in purchasing this if it’s not going to work.” Malfoy says, waiting for Harry to join him in the stall.
"So then, what happened to this body?" He gestures behind himself with his thumb. "Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out - have been - but shockingly, there's not much research to be found. But at any rate, that's when they and I became allies and then later friends. I'm going to revive Fred's body so he can go back to it and they can resume normal life. I don't think I have to tell you that living with two minds in one body is not ideal."
Draco put a finger to his lips and thought quickly. He couldn’t bring a wardrobe all the way from Hogwarts, that would be extremely suspicious.
“Please…” Draco began, and then it hit him. He did not have to do what Severus said. He was good enough at occlumency to hide this from the dark lord. And he would teach Harry to do the same. They could occlude from Severus and the dark lord. If they truly were careful, neither of them would ever know. He didn’t say anything else, only waited in what he hoped resembled resolute silence.
“Poor Harry.” Luna said. “He looks nervous.” Draco nodded. He did look nervous. Probably because he was such a shite dancer.
“You got it too.” Theo breathed, his eyes glistened and he raised the sleeve of his uniform to reveal a twin mark to the one on Draco’s own arm.
“You can’t simply wander around all night without any sort of plan in mind. Now if you would tell me what you were supposed to be doing maybe then-”
anywhere near Potter. He had been minding his own business, studying a statue, pretending to not notice when Potter and his friends passed by. So maybe he was feeling a little bit annoyed at Weasley for elbowing him earlier in the day and he stuck out his foot and Weasley tripped. However Weasley didn’t notice it was him, and neither did Granger.
Draco is held down while they hit him. Spit on him. Push things inside him. His eyes are shut tight, and even when he’s moved onto something else, a table, maybe, he doesn’t open them. He doesn’t want to see any of it.
“Okay. At any rate, when you came by last, he wasn’t dressed. He was under the blanket though, so I told him it was fine-”
"Suit yourself. You could always take them out and heal them anyway, you're a wizard so you can make it like the holes were never there."
“Anything else?” He asks, sipping his drink more deliberately. It burns going down, but he keeps his expression intact.
Draco blinked away tears which were falling unbidden. He longed for home - for someone he knew. Someone he could trust, someone to tell him it would be alright.
“How wonderful!” Mr. Weasley claps his hands together. Mrs. Weasley is smiling widely with flushed cheeks.
Fortunately, no one else heard, and Collin steps aside for Harry and Draco to step through gaps and closer to their target.
Harry looks at his face for a long moment, then steps back. One of the men with Robards snaps cuffs onto Draco’s wrists.
Harry pulls Draco back a bit, shifting him to sit on the sofa with his bent legs over Harry’s lap, feet on his thigh.
“I gave him a code to use. When they first brought him in, he would work the floor. Flirt, you know? I didn’t know he was held hostage, figured he was some down-on-his-luck kid who’d fallen into the club for easy money. But some patrons get handsy with the staff. So I told him to stick close to the bar, I’d check in with him. If he said ‘fine,’ I’d step in. If he said ‘okay,’ I’d leave him to it.”
“The game rules are simple. Someone whispers a question into the selected person’s ear, and the person answers aloud. Questions are best when the answers involve someone in the room. After the person has answered, we flip a coin to determine whether or not the question is spoken aloud. Heads is yes, tails is no.”
“Yeah, but…” Ron shrugs, chewing. “I wasn’t very witty then, so whenever I would talk to you, you’d get the last word. It was really annoying.”
“Well, Malfoy, it’s a good thing I never saw that you’re here else I’d have to bring you in.” Ron says. “Pity he ran off after you took him from the club, huh Harry? He’s always been quite the slippery bastard.”
“Very well.” Willows begins. “I met the girl at a party and we took off together. But she had eaten something bad, and she puked right outside the flat.”
Harry falls asleep no more than ten minutes in, thought that might be mostly Draco's fault. He'd been petting Harry’s hair since he started reading.
Harry looks through the windows, but the drapes are closed and he can’t see anything. He knocks on the door, but no one opens it. With a shrug, he continues on his walk.
They snog for a bit longer, before a couple starts bickering near the window, and Malfoy glares in their direction for a few seconds. He plunks some money on the table and rises imperiously.
“I know. Maybe one at a time is better, though. So you’re not overwhelmed remembering everything at once.”
Harry considered him, his crossed arms, expression of anticipation, affected drawl as he geared up for conflict.
But after dinner, after Harry has fed Hugo and Draco is looking antsy and out of sorts, Ron takes the baby from Harry’s arms with a wink and nods toward Draco.
The leather on this one is a warm reddish-purple, the silk ribbon gold and the pages neatly lined close together, unlike the plain white in Draco’s.
“Acknowledge me, I could have died out there.” Harry says dramatically, sitting on the floor in front of the sofa.
The inside of the shop is dimly lit, smells of… oh, it's Amortentia, and the only other figure in the room, a very small person, is shrouded by a dark cloak and its shadows.
Draco tosses the knife away with one last glare, turning his back on them to kneel down where Harry lies.
“Your old bosses… they were wrong about you. They didn’t try to understand you at all, how would they know the first thing about you? I’m so proud of how far you’ve come, that we can even have this conversation because you don’t like something and you feel okay talking to me about it. That
So Draco climbs the stairs alone, looking back several times at Harry settling into the armchair by the fire. Harry feels awful, but he’s certain Draco somehow feels worse.
After much greeting and kisses and handshakes, Harry led the Weasley clan inside, where he found Andromeda, Teddy and McGonagall already lounging about one of the larger drawing rooms.
“Yeah, hi!” He greets her enthusiastically. “I’ve just come for a quick lunch, do you have anything lying about I could snag?”
“I’ll just be a moment.” Malfoy says, leaving Harry in the sitting area whilst he goes into the dimly lit bedroom.
Weasley looked chastised, Granger looked intrigued, and Potter looked… still cagey. It made Draco feel like he was cornering a wild animal, treading carefully, desperate not to spook or anger it.
He tried to tuck his hair behind his ear, but the lawless curls fell right back into his face, drawing a huff of frustration from his mouth.
“Draco,” Ron began, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, causing both Hermione and Draco roll their eyes. “You didn’t happen to see any other Unspeakables, when you were, erm… down there, did you?”
They landed hard on crunching dry leaves and thick undergrowth, a smell Draco recognized as the Forbidden Forest. He fell from Harry's back and hit the ground, and then Harry was on top of him, nose pressed to Draco's neck, boxing him in against the earth.
Draco stepped back, and Harry dropped his hands reluctantly, but Draco caught one in his own. Harry opened his eyes and huffed at the blur that was Draco as he retrieved his glasses from his open collar, sliding them back on his nose to look at him properly.
So he’d taken hold of Harry’s slack face and kissed him square on the mouth, gentle but direct, and it was finally enough to wake Harry up, to call him back. Harry had gasped against his lips, his hands slowly rising and tentatively gripping Draco’s robes.
at all. This kiss was ardent, steadfast, full of intent—less desperate, but still so eager; less pained, but just as passionate. Kissing Draco felt like the dawn of spring after a long winter, like flying through cool, night air, like blowing out the candles on a real birthday cake.
The Healers so far were baffled. They kept telling Harry there was nothing wrong with him, when there quite obviously
“Well, well,” Draco drawled, his eyes glinting with fondness and amusement, “seems I’m dating the next Ollivander.”
Draco drew in a sharp breath upon the contact, and Harry opened his eyes, terrified that something went wrong again, that the bonds were still active. But Draco wore an elated smile, eyes half-closed in contentment, with one hand buried in Harry’s thick hair, the other gently lifting Harry’s glasses off of his face, folding them carefully with dextrous fingers and stowing them in the open collar of his uniform. He leaned back in for more, and Harry felt completely surrounded by him, already addicted to his scent, his taste, the smooth slide of his lips, the feel of his warm body under Harry’s curious hands.
Draco stood alone in his study, staring at his empty Pensieve inside its cabinet. He picked up an empty vial from a shelf full of memories.
Draco shook his head, his lips twitching in amusement and disbelief. He glanced once more at Harry’s forehead—Harry looked even more confused, now. Draco knelt and started tracing the dots like a constellation on the chalkboard, in the pattern he really should have seen, because he knew it
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Boombox?” he repeated. “Sounds dangerous. Why would the muggles require explosions to play music?”
Harry, it’s not hard.” She opened a drawer in her desk with a complicated wand movement, stashing the box away. “And no. He makes them.”
Harry’s mirthful laugh made Draco feel like he was floating, even as he was pinned to the ground. Harry leaned down to kiss him again, as if he couldn’t help himself.
Draco stared at the porcelain cup, filled with hot tea—Earl Grey, by the smell of it, complete with two lemon slices on the side. Harry stared at Draco, instead, aware that he was on the precipice of something, but not quite sure what.
The mediwitch smiled at him and said, “You’re welcome, Healer Malfoy,” and Harry could hear the respect in her voice. He was struck dumb by it.
Harry felt like he was floating. Like a feather, drifting back and forth as it fell slowly to the earth. Except he never landed. He just kept drifting, back and forth, a gentle rocking motion. Weightless.
Draco unrolled the Daily Prophet, glancing at the headlines before tossing it to the side—something incredibly boring about certain Wizengamot members retiring, opening up positions. He picked up a small package, tied with twine and stamped with the Quality Quidditch Supplies logo, and smiled. He’d been expecting this order to come in for a while.
“Honestly, where are your manners? Give the lady a carrot!” Draco teased, offering Harry the second carrot. Hera followed its path with her nose. Harry grinned, taking the carrot and holding it out for an eager Hera, all wariness forgotten between both parties. Harry slowly reached his other hand up to try scratching behind her ears, and almost laughed in disbelieving joy when she leaned into it. Draco wondered when the last time Harry had interacted with an animal was—at least one that wasn’t an owl. Speaking of which…
It was one sprawling floor, white sides with black shutters, small chimneys poking from the slate-shingled roof for each hearth. Dark green ivy and vines crawled up the sides around timber frames and large bay windows, branching out across the clean, white plaster in jagged lines, embracing the corners of the house. As Harry’s eyes roamed to the right, he glimpsed the beautiful, domed sunroom, glass panes reflecting the thick grey clouds in the sky.
Ron stared at him, dumbstruck. “Protocol,” he mumbled, as if it was just a word he had to say before breaking the rules. Harry raised an eyebrow, waving his hands at himself to prove his point:
He put a hand on Draco’s cheek, eyes roaming all over his handsome face, taking him in. He brushed his thumb over the faint scar on Draco’s jawbone, the dark smudges under his tired silver eyes, through the fine, soft strands of hair falling out of his plait.
Rose looked to be the same age as Camila. She was dressed in pink pyjamas, clutching two stuffed cartoonish creatures to her chest—one of them looked vaguely familiar. She stopped just behind her mother, hiding herself a little behind Hermione’s leg, looking up at Draco with one wide, fearful eye.
“Just us, then?” Draco asked, motioning between himself and Ron, who looked back at his wife in inquiry.
stay with them. There was no real reason Harry had to stay there, especially after fourth year, when they’d put Grimmauld Place under a Fidelius charm—he’d only been able to go after being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging. Or after fifth year, once they’d put those wards on the Burrow—Dumbledore had taken him there himself, only after using him to convince Slughorn to return—
The memories flashed past him, and Draco suppressed a wince at watching himself milk that shallow injury for all it was worth.
Ron picked up his head and started rubbing his eyes. His vibrantly orange hair stuck up in all directions, his desk more chaotic than usual.
“Well, of course she is a different woman,” Willem answered, as if Harry was an idiot. “You can’t expect her to be as powerful as she was during a War. Can’t expect anyone to be that strong all the time.” He sighed as he settled into his armchair-cot. “Besides, I wouldn’t know how to be strong in a body I hadn’t used in ten months, either. You know she was plenty strong without it.”
the wand was pointed at his head, and the drunk Potter’s eyes widened as he tried and failed to move around, away.
like that. He wondered if the Department knew about such things, if they had considered using a similar method on Draco.
The Unspeakables could wander this shoreline forever, and never find it. Watching Draco move about his kitchen, where no one could get to him no matter how hard they tried, Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
“I’m sorry you lost your mother,” she said, quieter. “I know nothing can replace her. But you should know that the mothers that love you, love you very much. Do you think Molly Weasley would stop c—clucking over you if you were to remind her, like that, whenever you saw her?”
Harry’s eyes snapped up to meet Draco’s. His face was intent, apparently trying to communicate something without having the words to do it. Draco froze, and waited.
wasn’t it? That Harry had gone ten years, coasting on a slow, soporific wave of meaningless scenes, never asking questions? Seeing everything, but never
Draco didn’t answer. Harry suddenly remembered his stir fry, and turned around to toss the veggies before they burnt.
“Be honest, Harry,” he said, putting the kettle on. “Did you sign up for this just to try to get into bed with me?”
“Thought you’d left,” Draco mumbled sleepily, scooting in close until his chest pressed against Harry’s back, his thighs around Harry’s hips. “But you left your wand in your trousers. You’re wearing mine, by the way.”
The soot-grey clouds seemed to follow him around, this time, like dogs waiting for treats from his hand. He flicked his wrist as the town square darkened beneath them, erecting powerful muggle-repellant wards that might’ve accidentally cleared out the entire quarter. The tourists rushed away, eyeing the clouds warily, checking their watches and muttering about things they’d forgotten.
Harry stepped up next to him—Draco started, he hadn’t even heard him move—and frowned at the jumble of thirteen white chalk dots, eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Draco watched him, wondering if he’d recognize any pattern of his own. It was his own mind, after all. But Harry looked as confused as Draco did, running a hand through his wild hair in frustration, pushing it up off of his forehead—
Hermione turned red but continued hastily. “You say Voldemort was awfully fond of storing his soul in things of old value. Like pureblood relics and such.” She nodded at Harry eagerly.
“What about you?” His voice cracked and he put a hand to his eyes, as if he could hold the tears in that way. Bizarrely, he was reminded of Theo, who had done the same exact thing a year and a half ago.
“You’re thinking of someone.” Luna said quietly. Everyone stared at her, and then turned their gazes to Draco, waiting for confirmation.
I simply want to clear something up. I did not want Buckbeak to be murdered. He was a truly lovely creature and he did not deserve to die. I am sorry that he was killed but it wasn’t my fault. I asked my father not to go through with it. I don’t understand why he still did. I didn’t even tell my father about the whole incident, I told my mother. I suppose she told him, I guess she tells him most everything. But that’s not the point. The point is that I’m sorry. I really am. Buckbeak deserved to have a long happy life. Well, I best be going now it’s getting late.
“My father.” was all he said. Lucius told him some shite about Sirius Black being Potter’s godfather, and apparently he wanted Draco to use this information wisely. Whatever the hell that meant.
Quite a lot has happened since I have last written you. Let’s start here. It’s always startling when you look at me with such a mixed look on your face. I spotted you during the World Cup and ensured that my parents and I walked in that exact direction. For some reason I didn’t notice the Weasel family and Granger with you. I was planning to merely walk past and pretend to not look at you, when in reality I would be studying you because, as I have mentioned previously, you are quite lovely. But that’s really besides the point. I always seem to get on this topic. It’s driving me insane. Moving on I would like to believe that your eyes brightened when they saw me. However within seconds they darkened again. And I’m sincerely hoping that was because of my parents and not me. I hold onto a hope that you don’t always think about me in regards to hate, but instead someone who you can tolerate and doesn’t drive you to near madness. I’m doing it again, aren't I? Terribly sorry about that. My first point here is that we saw each other at the World Cup before the later chaos and you did not look completely disgusted at the sight of me. I would give anything to know what you thought when you saw me.
“I can do it.” Draco nodded eagerly. Borgin narrowed his eyes at him and searched his face. Draco quickly drew up his mental shields. He didn’t know if Borgin knew occlumency but he did not want to take any chances.
“Well we couldn’t really talk much because the Death Eaters were there, but he told me to go hide. I don’t really know what that means though…”
Potter took a long look at him before turning and walking away. And any happiness that Draco had felt earlier vanished like an unspoken promise.
After heaving in the bathroom, Draco hugged Luna, waved farewell to Hermione and Ginny, and walked out the front door. Everyone had decided it was best for him to go alone, in case he was captured. That way not as many of them would be put into danger. Draco’s stomach was burning with anticipation and nerves. Breaking into one’s own home was completely thrilling, who would’ve guessed. He apparated to the back of his house and closed his eyes briefly. He could do this. He was going to do this right.
“Weasley is going to pretend to be Harry, and go into hiding. Then me, you, Luna, and Ginny, we’re going to figure out a way to break Harry out while Weasley misleads everyone.” Hermione seemed to be the master of complicated plans.
Draco stuffed the letter into his box as he heard the door knob begin to turn. It must be his father. His mother always knocked. Sure enough his father entered his room, closing the door behind him.
Theo paused for a moment before turning around and saying. “Yeah, just give me some space for a little while. Alright?”
“Well-it’s complicated.” he sighed heavily. He missed the days when the only thing he had to worry about was why Potter wasn’t fighting with him.
“Really?” Potter was grinning like an idiot and so was Draco. What was happening. He was so happy, so happy, so happy he couldn’t think. Draco nodded and was fully intending to lean in when a gasp broke them apart. It was his cousin. Tonks.
“Well, just focus on getting better.” He almost said that it was fine, but it wasn’t. Not in the slightest.
“Astoria invited me over. I’m here for you.” Draco assures him, entering the room. He gestures at Astoria’s side of the bed. “Mind?”
Harry follows Malfoy down to the same dining room as before, where there are only three places set. Narcissa at one, Lucius at the other, and a third plate in the middle of the table, already full of food.
Finally, Draco takes a step back, releasing Alpha’s face and wiping his hand on the front of Alpha’s shirt.
Every thrust is angled so it directly hits Draco’s prostate, and one of Potter’s big hands holds the opposite edge of the desk whilst the other is planted on Draco’s hip.
Draco moans for the sixth time this evening, glad the tomato-colour of his face doesn’t translate through the floo.
“Shh.” He says, his arms the only thing keeping Draco from falling onto the floor and sobbing until his body feels as empty as he does these days.
“Did you finish school?” Harry asks him abruptly. Malfoy blinks rapidly at him, and Harry swears he can feel a breeze on his face from it.
Winky, the house-elf, had returned along with Dobby and Kreacher to defend the school. Her coffin was a third of the size of the rest. Dobby was sobbing, stroking the wood and pushing away Kreacher’s gruff attempts at consolation.
“Oh yes, they’re very eye-catching. I suspect I’ll be the talk of the club - I bought a new sheer mesh shirt to wear to show them off.” Pansy says, pulling her shirt back down to cover her piercings.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut and whines pitifully. Harry’s hands move uselessly as he realises he can’t even touch Draco to make him feel better.
Harry grips Ron’s forearm as Seamus peeks from behind a tree and watches McGonagall’s fingers count down.
Malfoy leans in close to Harry’s ear, one arm winding around Harry’s shoulders and the other hand cupping his jaw to tilt his head up. He takes a breath.
When he sets it down in front of Draco, he sniffs it suspiciously, looking cautiously at Harry for any hints of malevolence, or so Harry guesses.
Harry wants to laugh, but he only turns to converse with a Ministry leader he’s sort of acquainted with.
“Did you know there are welts on your back?” Harry asks. It’s not as gentle as he was aiming for. Draco had said he wasn’t sure where the rest of the marks had come from, but Harry finds it hard to believe he wouldn’t be aware of being hit that hard.
Backup arrives before he’s able to do so, and he barely manages to hide Malfoy’s wand and cast a notice-me-not on her before they burst through the door.
“Of course I want to. We should probably wait til we get home to continue this, though.” He smiles wryly, and Draco grins, nodding.
Voldemort was there, facing away, his wand aloft as various people charged him only to be flicked aside as easily as if they were bugs.
I'm so sorry for the hiatus! I am all moved and settled in Colorado, and I survived the first week of classes. I am absolutely inundated with work (see Tumblr for all my professorial stories) but having a wonderful time. I also just published a western short story with Rope and Wire (https://www.ropeandwire.com/side-trail-gunnison-county-drive-erica-massey.html) if you have any interest in that. Thank you so much for your patience and I will try to get another chapter out within 2 weeks. Love yall! Stay safe!
In Deacon news: The Good Boy is LOVING colorado. We had to get him an insulated jacket because he adores frolicking for hours in the snow but his rather thin coat is just not made for snow-frolicking. He submits to the coat (and boots, if we're going for a longer hike) graciously.
Sorry for such a belated chapter. I have officially finished my dissertation (yay!), scheduled my defense, and have been applying for jobs all over the US and Canada. I have my first interview next week!
In holiday break news: I am headed (by car) to Austin to spend Christmas with my family. Lots of road-trip book listening time and (hopefully) writing time. I'm going to set aside an hour of writing time every day over the break so hopefully I can have an update faster than usual. Thanks for your patience! Also, I am toying with a few Witcher fic ideas as well as a few Old Guard ideas if anyone wants to weigh in on what fandom I hop to next.
I'm taking the next week off to read and write and recover some health and sanity before the new semester starts. I should have the next chapter up in 2 weeks. See you then!
I arrived in Colorado yesterday and the faculty-in-residence apartment is pretty neat. All the windows face the community garden which is amazing! I've spent the day enjoying mountain air and bird song. The living room is gigantic and full of light and one of the bedrooms has a walk-in closet (that's the one I chose to be mine, of course). The kitchen has...an interesting configuration. The bathroom is minuscule. The carpet is gross. But, on the whole, it has good bones and I'm excited to give it a makeover. I have contact paper and a can-do attitude. If you would like to follow our decorating exploits, I'm Xiaq on Tumblr as well and el_massey on Instagram.
Much IRL news to report: I have accepted a visiting professor position in Colorado at one of my top choice universities! I'll be teaching English and Communications/Media courses, which is exactly what I wanted. AND they offered me a faculty-in-residence gig, which means I have a two bedroom apartment waiting for me on campus (it will be both the largest and cheapest place I've ever lived on my own). The fact that I have a job at all is amazing considering the state of the job market right now--that it's such an awesome opportunity, centrally located to my favorite mountains, is icing on top of the I-have-health-insurance-and-a-stable-income cake.
“I will too.” Harry says. “Ask Blaise when respectable people deem it appropriate for sleepovers, would you?”
“I just thought they were nice, I don’t know what they mean.” He says, setting them down on the counter.
When the water cools, Harry gets out and wakes Draco up gently by laying kisses across his cheeks and nose.
He’s very capable of not talking about his sex life, though he still finds it strange that the tamers are so hung up on it.
See, Malfoy has always had a sort of strange prettiness. He's always dressed well and has had sleek hair and if he wasn't such a git, Harry would maybe have thought him attractive.
“Nope.” Harry grins, handing them over. There’s a blue, a green and a purple, as Harry had kept the pink and orange for himself. “These are muggle. They’re called gel pens.”
“I didn’t- s-” Harry stammers before he realises what Goyle is talking about. “No. I wish I could’ve.”
“I know. You’ve very good at remembering the rules. Let’s add Marion to the rule, so it’s okay for you to be naked if it’s only Marion, me and you around. Is that okay?”
“It’s the awe factor scale. If you were a girl, I’d be aiming for jealousy. But since you’re not, attraction.” Malfoy shrugs.
tbh I don't LOVE Lavender but I do think most fics treat her a bit unfairly.. like she appreciated Ron before he was 'cool,' and it meant a lot to him? I don't think he would've had the self-esteem to go for Hermione if it hadn't been for Lavender showing him that he can be attractive to girls. Sure she was an annoying gf but she's a really sweet character and demonstrates bravery when it counts :)
More Death Eaters use magic to create a new bridge, spanning across the chasm and crossing it swiftly.
Draco stands on his toes, holding Harry’s hand up high so Harry can twirl under it, laughing the whole time.
“No,” Potter says, shaking his head and lifting the slice. “No I like it, but I’m trying to be more… I dunno, polite, I guess.”
“Later that month, he sent me a letter along with a large donation for the rebuilding of Hogwarts. He, almost single handedly, funded its rebuilding as well as generous compensation for the individuals who volunteered to help clean up that summer. He expressed his regret that he was unable to join the effort during his house arrest.”
