D: Your pet is going in the guest room until you get home.
“Because he’s your father, and you love him,” said Harry simply.
Draco smiled and brought Harry’s hand to his lips, kissing the scar on the back, ‘I must not tell lies’.
"You've been out for about an hour," murmured Draco. He ran his fingers through the rat's nest of Harry's hair. "How are you feeling?"
Again, I nod. In for a penny…
If Harry had not been paying such close attention, he would have missed the smile in the man’s eyes. He may affect a cool, slightly detached, persona while at the desk, but Harry knew that this man was passionate about his job and probably quite a few other things as well.
Today was no different. Draco wasn’t sure if he had been standing there for hours or only moments. Most likely the former. Harry was always good about giving him space when he needed it. Without a word, Harry came to stand beside Draco, allowing the sounds of the countryside to envelop them. He wouldn’t speak unless Draco broke the silence.
“Well, I know that,” he huffed, “but I’m trying to network.”
"No,” he said. “My father will hear about this."
“I bet it’s a boy,” Teddy said, bouncing on his toes.
I stride into the room, looking fierce and powerful, closing and locking the door behind me with the strongest charm I know.
Harry squeezed his hand gently. “A part of you will probably always love him. And that’s okay. There is absolutely nothing wrong with loving a parent, even if they have done something horrible.”
“No, I’m not mad,” there he goes rolling his eyes again for the third time in as many minutes. “Frustrated? Sure that this will be a disaster? Not actually convinced that you can put your ego aside for one moment and learn something from me? Yes. But I’m willing to try. So, come on!” he switches legs on the barre and nods his head motioning for Harry to join him. “I haven’t got all day twinkle-toes!”
“Nice to officially meet you, Draco. I’m Harry,” he picked up his book, making his way towards the door. “I’ll be sure to get your recommendation for my next book.”
It was the Sunday before Christmas and Draco found himself standing in front of the Black Lake, skipping stones. It wasn’t something he normally did. During his ‘eighth year’, he had a run-in with the Giant Squid whilst trying to swim and had mostly stayed away since. However, from time to time, when he was feeling particularly melancholy or needed space to think, he came here, sheltered beneath a gnarled old tree, and skipped as many stones as he could find, usually until Harry found him and dragged him back to the castle.
? How was he going to break this to Ron?
“Wait,” Harry said. “You. Sent a Patronus. To Ron.”
"Thanks for the swim," Harry said.
Harry let him hand the photo back and looked at it morosely. "Isn't she the loveliest child?"
"Cheers," Harry said, "that's really good, actually."
He did not quite let himself examine the reason he was working so hard at this. But the truth was, somewhere in the back of his mind he believed that if he managed to find answers, then he could go to Draco and tell him. It would be something to offer him; something Harry could give. It would be a way to apologize.
"No," said Malfoy, with total certainty, and shifted position a bit, just enough that his knee and Harry's knee were touching. Malfoy's blue eyes were heavy-lidded with drink and with the late hour but he was looking at Harry very intently, the same kind of intentness he'd recently shown at the billiards table, like a man about to aim, and win. Suddenly Harry's heart was beating very fast.
“He won’t,” Pansy promises, with much more conviction than Harry thinks is warranted. He’s about 80% sure that’s exactly what’s going to happen. She turns to Harry. “Let’s grab some brooms.”
Draco shakes his head and looks back down at his textbook, which has fallen shut. He swallows hard. “Do you think you’re going to last? You and Corner.”
Malfoy’s expression flickers when Harry says his name, and he hesitates for a moment, and then he closes his eyes. “You have to not be joking,” he says, and this time his tone is completely different. He sounds wobbly, the way he does when he feels very strongly—when he’s furious, or when he’s crying. Although Harry’s only really heard him cry twice—in the bathroom and working up the nerve to kill Dumbledore. He sounds like he’s trying to give an order, but it’s coming out a plea.
Harry turns his hands and gently takes Malfoy’s, which tighten around his immediately. It sends a jolt through him, like lightning. He doesn’t point out that using
“Have you ever harmed Harry Potter physically in the past?”
“Did you fight in the war?”
He dips his quill again and moves on.
” Draco echoes.
That’s what
huh? Don’t tell me you’re going to try to spin this one—”
“Yes?” It sounds like a question. “Have you ever made very good decisions in the middle of the night?”
physical attraction going on. “What’s up?”
“He didn’t. I had to tell him.” Malfoy sounds about as embarrassed as Harry feels.
moral compass?”
Draco’s gut twists. He thinks of skinny, muscled, soccer-player Butcher under Harry, looking nervous and eager.
Pansy raises an eyebrow, her voice dry. “Please.”
“Harry.”
foolproof: it doesn’t account for the possibility that the one with the matching soulmark is Draco Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy happens to not be interested in getting his heart broken.
Pansy hesitates, chewing a lip. If Harry remembers correctly, she’s usually wearing brilliantly red lipstick, which would explain why she looks different right now.
And Harry, he’s hurting.
Ron blinks. “Blimey, Parkinson, tell me how you really feel.”
“Why didn’t you
“Were you fucking or playing soccer?” Draco drawls, sitting up from his studying position on his stomach. “You look like you’ve been getting physical.”
, and reality is probably going to be so screwed. “I can’t believe I thought you were hot,” he mutters.
believes, anyway.
He refocuses.
“Now it’s like that all over again. Except this time, I know it’s not even close to normal. I’m the only one.”
and then he realizes
“You have…” Draco swallows and looks down, watching the tip of his quill make a bigger and bigger ink spot on the paper he’s supposed to be grading. He hasn’t been processing what’s on this student’s page for a while now, but he can’t look at Harry while he speaks. He
And Harry nodded and clapped him on the shoulder sympathetically. “Me too,” he said.
“You brought Potter,” Malfoy sneers, and, having come to himself, promptly yanks his arm out of Harry’s grasp, taking very deliberate steps away from him. “Pansy. Here?
“You are the one Harry Potter took to bed last night, correct?”
Draco would’ve given Harry a respectable meal, but he thought perhaps now was not the time to push his proper-eating agenda on Harry, so Harry’s plate has far too much food, and much of it is sweet. It gets a real smile out of Harry, and Draco thinks he could burst. He could fly. He could kiss Harry right on the mouth.
And then of course. What he should’ve seen coming from the very beginning.
, says a snide voice in his head. But he
“Calm down, Merlin, you’re so hotheaded—”
Somehow, he figures out how to stand, using both arms to steady himself against his desk, heart pounding. It feels like his whole body is trembling. “I… should show you something.”
Draco feels himself flush. “Say it,” he demands.
“We need to get to the Manor, so that when we turn back time we end up in the morning of August third, 1996, in the Manor. How are we going to get there?”
They stop.
“Do I seem like I matter enough to Mister Harry Potter to have emotionally harmed him? No. No to all your questions.”
this Malfoy has a Dark Mark.
“Oh.” He says.
“Well then.”
Pansy opens her mouth like she’s about to answer, before there’s a very loud “Bloody hell,” and Ron’s curtains flutter madly. “You’re shagging
As far as he knows.
Standing in front of the entrance, picking at her cuticles, is Pansy Parkinson.
It’s their first gentle kiss. Malfoy’s arm wraps around Harry’s waist, and the other winds into Harry’s hair, both pulling him closer, as if Malfoy wants to eliminate every inch between them. And he kisses slowly, as if he’s got all the time in the world,  as if he doesn’t want to part ways any more than Harry does. And Harry winds his arms around Malfoy’s neck and follows Malfoy’s lead.
“Do you consider yourself to have a strong moral compass?”
“I think,” says Harry frantically, because the Slytherin dorms are right around the corner, which means the night is about to end, and who knows if they’ll ever be able to pick this back up again if they put it down now, “That I would like to let you ride my broomstick.”
Malfoy’s too clever to go back to his own time just because Harry told him
“Yeah, fuck yeah.” Jacobs closes his eyes. Tips his head back a little. He should get a strike just for that. But Draco is extraordinarily fair.
broken,” Draco gets in, his heart breaking and breaking and breaking. The rims of Harry’s eyes are getting red and wet, his jaw clenching tight. “I never said—”
By the time they get into Malfoy’s room, Hermione has found her voice. “You’re only supposed to go back five hours, max. Otherwise... it’s dangerous,” she’s saying, as Harry tries to come to terms with the fact that he’s in Malfoy’s bedroom.
“Yeah,” Draco says finally, “To protect you from a big, bad boyfriend.”
For some reason, this makes Harry feel hot and flushed, even though it’s still unsnowing all over them, and he looks away, watching the stars shift across the sky gradually, between flashes of daylight, and the moon wane and wax and wane and wax backward. “Well
“Oooh stop! In the name of the law!” Malfoy mocks, not stopping. Actually, he’s speeding up a little, like he wants to get away without Harry noticing. “Gryffindor Tower is

Pansy’s taken them back to the morning of.
he reads,
“Well. Not everybody’s going to forgive me.”
“I think…” Harry says slowly, realizing he has Malfoy’s attention. He swallows down his embarrassment and steps closer. He’s close enough to touch Malfoy, but he’s not sure if Malfoy wants him to, so he just leans against the wall. “I think you’re really… I mean… I really do think you’re hot. And you’re smart… and clever… I mean, I really think, you know, I think I’m, like, two steps away from falling in love with you, you know?”
is his, even when it isn’t.
“No.”
Harry hums. “Yeah, he’s alright. I like him.” And then, unnecessarily, “I’m going to take a shower.” He closes the bathroom door.
“Oh, I’m sure he’s here to help—”
Merlin fucking dammit. Nobody needed the reminder.
Draco drags his eyes away again, back to Muggle Innovation:
"Sweetie, be a good girl and call your grandparents, your mother and I will be fine," Annie says as she points the knife she had in her right hand to the man.
"Yeah, they won't be happy," Arianna said and then giggles.
“Did you have any allegiances to a particular side while the war was happening?”
“What?”
him? Merlin’s tits. You’ve grown up.” She straightens and flashes a smile at them. “I’ll just go right inside, so that you boys can kiss, or fly, or whatever you need to do.”
Harry’s out on the field, playing “soccer,” a Muggle sport, when Draco gets back to their dorm after the “interrogation,” as it were. The Boyfriend Check.
” she says.
He’d wait to see if Malfoy’s going to return to his right state of mind and give some proper consent or something, but Malfoy’s life is on the line, and so is the rest of reality as they know it, so he accepts the chain picks up the time-turner, and sends it spinning.
Apparently not.
, he wouldn’t feel… like this. But then he’d pity Draco, and he’d feel bad, and their friendship would fracture—it happens to nearly all Dissonant soulmates.
Harry’s furrowed brow eases, and he smiles. False cheer. Draco can tell. “I’m alright,” he says. “It’s not like I don’t know all this stuff.”
“Are you kidding?”
Draco ignores this. “Have you ever harmed Harry Potter emotionally in the past?”
Harry’s stomach turns. Pansy’s hair-petting is making him feel antsy, so he paces back and forth in front of her. The room really is pretty small. “I
Ah. A one-night stand. “He’s terrible. Two strikes. Out.”
Harry makes a face, a laugh escaping him that makes Draco feel warm. “His name is Jacob Jacobs?”
Draco pulls out Astronomy and starts studying. The interesting thing is that they’re not studying the magical elements of the planets, the constellations, any of that. They’re studying the
Fake, light laughter at the back of Draco’s throat; an easy quip is on the tip of Draco’s tongue. Instead, he says quietly, “How could you?”
Harry tells himself he doesn’t notice that Malfoy smells good, smells a little bit of sweat but mostly of cologne that’s probably worth more than Harry’s entire wardrobe. It’s not his fault his nose has to be so close to Malfoy’s neck, or that the human nose has evolved to pick up scent, or that Malfoy chose to be so fucking hot.
And boy, are there options.
Draco yanks his hand away several seconds too late. Harry has muscle. It’s not a surprise—he’s lifted things, you can
Harry hums, a low noise in his throat. He seems distracted. “Yeah. Uh. You might want to change.”
He looks absolutely stunned, like he’s just seen his sex dream come to life.
“I mean.” Malfoy’s steps slow.
Harry hasn’t been picky.
Which is absolutely not the same thing as being scared
it is what Draco feels.
“Hmm,” Michael Corner says, now grinning even wider. “Let me think real hard on that one. Have I ever
Harry puts on a bright, fake smile when he teaches, but when he returns to their rooms, his shoulders slump and his smile falls off his face as if it’s made of lead. “Stop it,” he tells Draco. “It just makes them more curious.”

“Muggle Innovations,” Draco answers. “It’s so unfair that you don’t have to take this class.”
sneer at this point. His face is probably just stuck that way. “I don’t need your preaching, Potter.”
Absolutely not what Harry expected to hear.
Harry clenches his fists. “Oh really?”
Harry recasts a Mufflatio and shouts over them both, “
want you.”
It’s going to live in Draco’s head all week, along with the smile he gave Draco when he spotted him in Diagon Alley unexpectedly, the way he asked Draco if he’d like to go to dinner after, hands awkwardly in his pockets, since they were both already there. To talk over their lesson plans for feedback. But. Still. Draco lives in a world of
” he mutters against Malfoy’s mouth, “I’m trying my best, okay?” He pulls back and looks into Malfoy’s face. He hasn’t realized until now, when he has Malfoy’s face in his hands, that Malfoy has a very evasive gaze. Malfoy has probably not looked at him more than four times this whole time, or at least, not for more than two seconds. “You’re being an arse.”
Because that’s the kind of reaction that’s expected, right?
As Draco slips off his robe.
Draco wrinkles his nose. “Soccer doesn’t have the grace necessary to entice me into playing,” he says. “You smell—you smell.”
“Thought I was a right prick, at first,” Jacobs says casually. As if Harry Potter thinking you’re a right prick is not grounds for concern. “But you know, once you’re up close and personal, things look a bit different, don’t they?”
“I think if you hadn’t become a Death Eater, we would’ve lost the war.” Seeing Malfoy opening his mouth with an incredulous expression, Harry continues quickly, “You never killed Dumbledore, because you didn’t want to. That bought us a lot of time. You didn’t identify me when we were caught. You let me take those wands—I
“I’m sorry,” Draco says helplessly. It’s all he has. “Harry, I’m so so—”
“No.” Still flat. “What do you think.”

about whether he’s looking at Harry. It’s like sitting or standing or lying down: a state of being, a situation, a whole-body act.
It doesn’t feel like it’s time for an adventure; it feels like it’s time for a nap. But when did Harry ever get to do what he felt like, right?
The bed dips under Harry’s weight as Harry sits on the edge of Draco’s bed, right by Draco’s pillow. Draco can see in extreme proximity the curve of his arse, the line of his thigh.
The students seem momentarily placated by this answer, and they settle enough for Draco to continue the part on soulmarks without having to threaten anyone with detention.
It was very soft.
“You let me think it.” Harry gets in Draco’s face, his bag all packed, his voice shaking. “You stood there and you listened to me
Probably since he came here to find Malfoy and Malfoy had no idea he was coming, Harry gets over his surprise first.
“Alright, well.” He bites his lip and looks at Pansy. “We need to get that letter

“Not safe,” Harry agrees.
favorite remains after classes are over, and he can sit with Harry in his chambers or in Harry’s and do… whatever. Sometimes they talk. Sometimes they play card games, or chess, or anything else, all of which Draco consistently wins. Sometimes they simply exist in the same space, and it’s so
Draco ignores this comment, though his cheeks burn red. Harry’s joking. Friends make jokes. But he’s imagined it too many times for his brain
“Let’s try his bedroom?” she whispers, her voice pitching up at the end. “Follow me. Again.”
Like…
“Maybe it’s because you were fated to get that scar,” Draco says, “So you didn’t need a soulmark because you were going to get one so young, it was basically the same thing.”
Another joke. He’s always teasing Draco about “over-preparing” (which is not a real thing).
He is still, in the center of the room, his robe on the chair behind his desk, his fingers still clenched around the fabric of his shirt and the fabric of his trousers, his soulmark still out. He can feel his heartbeat like it’s a living thing trapped inside his chest, trying to break its way out, pounding against the walls as hard as it possibly can.
“Why not?” Harry asks, at the same time as Hermione says, “She’s right.”
things before: impending doom, abuse, Death Eaters. Voldemort. He doesn’t know how to deal with the little things, things that don’t have to do with physical harm.
“You’re joking.”
“So?” The Hufflepuff girl asks Draco in class, her smile soft. “What’s it feel like, being together with your soulmate?”
They have not spoken since they got back from school, when Malfoy nodded briskly at him, saying
“Fucking hell,” Harry says.
feels about soulmates, he’d like to teach soulmates to the kids as well as he possibly can. He wants them to find the happiness that he aches for.
Sometimes he doesn’t.
But Harry himself does the job himself when his reputation isn’t there, Draco thinks, as Harry steps out of the shower not ten minutes later, drying his hair with his towel. And not wearing a towel around his waist.
, Draco almost says, even though that’s the last thing he wants. The thing he wants more than anything,
“This is about the past, not the present.”
“Harry has more emotional sway,” Pansy says, which Harry supposes is true. Malfoy hates Hermione, but he thinks Malfoy hates Harry even more. But how’s that gonna help—some sort of reverse psychology?
“That’s not how tissues work—”
Go take a shower.”
“A scented candle shop.” Harry looks at Draco’s bed in askance, and when Draco nods, he takes a seat beside Draco, their shoulders brushing. Draco was right—he’s barely sweating.
Which is a really harsh thing to say to Harry, who had a nightmare and then got woken up right after he’d

Part of this means he doesn’t go looking for Harry, or else they might just end up looking for each other.
from your bedroom.” She heads over to the doorway, pointing to Harry. “I’ll get the letter out of here, and you’ll get Draco, okay? Don’t worry about me.”
But it’s not stupid. It’s just different.
, Draco ends up staying the night because he doesn’t want to go back to his own rooms.
What did you say? I mean… I mean, what did you say? No—what—” His throat bobs, and he runs a hand through his hair, completely messing it up. It falls over his forehead, and Harry wants to brush it back again.
“He didn’t even fight! He didn’t know what it was like, being in war.”
Harry just gapes. He wonders if he’ll just spend the rest of this entire expedition in astonishment.
No, I haven’t. I haven’t spent that much time with the guy, how should I have been treating him? Scattering rose petals in his wake? Interrogating everyone he meets?”
Draco has never been so glad to be ordinary.
“Right. Right. You’re a little repetitive.” Jacobs puts his index and thumb fingers up, indicating an inch. “Just a little.”
clear that Harry could ask him to swallow a Muggle bomb and he’d do it, Harry is still afraid to say it.
“Sounds awkward enough already,” Harry says.
Harry laughs quietly, his gaze affectionate. In the light of the fire and the last scraps of the sunset through the window, his eyes are electric green. “Same thing as always,” he says finally. “I just don’t usually get asked flat out so much, you know?”
“You’d be surprised how many emergencies I’ve been woken up for in the middle of the night,” Harry mutters. They’re in the drawing room, where a fire flickers quietly in the very large fireplace. A whole family could fit in there at once. Harry just tries not to pay attention to where they are too much.
Malfoy reaches jerkily into the pocket of his robes and pulls out a shining Time-Turner, looping the chain about his neck and holding it out to Harry as if in a trance.
Whose situation is more laughable right now?”
“Sure, goodbye.” Draco has a

“Do they really teach gay sex, too?”

“The trouble is, if you go back in time, you’re going to be in the same place as you were at that time.” Hermione has a one-track mind. “You do know where and when?”
And Draco has always been selfish.

himself to memorizing Harry’s studying habits, it’s just that he’s spent so much time studying with Harry that he knows: Harry’s just not going to stop until he finds something to write. And then he’s going to write like the wind in that horrid handwriting for five minutes and fill half the paper. And then he’s going to do some more tapping.

Okay, well. There’s plenty.

“Wow.” Malfoy peers over at Harry, and his hair falls forward onto his forehead again. “You must be really tired.”
smiling, maybe, although it’s a bit dark to tell. “But we don’t have to row. We’re wizards.”
“Do you have any ill intentions towards Harry Potter?”
“Yeah, well. It’s my job. As a friend.” It’s ridiculous how solemn he feels in a fucking translucent shirt.
“...No?”
Malfoy manages to look away, in spite of Harry holding his face still. He casts his eyes to the sky and clenches his jaw—also strange to feel—and then closes his eyes. He really seems to not enjoy looking at Harry. “What?” he says, rather impatiently.
“I didn’t mean of course he’s double prepared, I meant, of course, he’s got his hands on two illegal time turners—”
He’s probably realized how Draco feels.
He’s doing it now. Five years into the best friendship he’s ever had.
There’s a pause, and then Parkinson says, almost quietly, “Draco’s gone back in time.”
“Er… Parkinson,” Ron says, when it becomes clear Harry’s still recovering his voice, “Why’s the inside of Malfoy’s trunk covered in newspaper clippings of Harry?”
“So you think he’s in a secret relationship,” says a boy in the corner. “He’s already found his soulmate.”
Harry doesn’t respond.
“What is your name?”
Malfoy’s tilting his face down; their noses are almost touching. Harry looks at Malfoy’s half-closed grey eyes, at his pale eyelashes and his flushed cheeks, and he can’t breathe.
special because he is the only person in history to
“Anyone who asks Professor Potter about his soulmate—
“Granger and Weasley,” Malfoy echoes blankly, still clutching Harry’s arm.
“I gave myself a letter,” Malfoy says simply.
If Harry’s honest, he thinks he’s selfish and sometimes cruel and has a quick temper and has hurt a lot of people. But deep down… deep down he does think he’s more good than he is bad.
“If we don’t take a risk, we might lose Draco,” Harry points out instead. “Er—Malfoy.”
Draco makes a face back. “You didn’t know his name?”
Draco takes his lunch in his classroom, because he always has papers to grade, potions to bottle, cauldrons to clean, kids in detention to watch over, and the like.
Harry opens his mouth. Closes it. “You’re insulting me,” he says dumbly, “
“And it’s four thirty in the morning.” Harry gently removes Malfoy’s hands from his hips, with no small amount of reluctance, and squeezes them. “You should go put those Time-Turners back in your Harry Potter trunk, and get some sleep. We can figure out what to do with them later.”
But of course, he doesn’t say it.
Harry…
“I was
“I have this one,” he says, tracing Harry’s scar on his hip. Harry reaches out and runs his fingers along it, so lightly that it sends shivers up Draco’s back. “The night when you first got part of Voldemort’s soul lodged in you.” He pulls up his shirt, traces over his heart. “I have this one. The night you not hit by the Curse again, and lost the part of Voldemort’s soul you had. It makes me love you more, the things you’ve been through. I’m made to love all the versions of you that there are.”
He had not meant to say that. “Sorry, that—People care, I know people care.
Draco has spent his whole life watching Harry, learning as well as anyone can learn how to read him. And Harry is on the edge of a breakdown, the edge of an explosion, he is seething and bursting and screaming inside. His eyes are fiery and his body is taut, his mouth a tight, pressed line.
Harry shoves back from his desk violently, his chair screeching against the floor.
” Harry points out, which he thinks is rather more relevant.
But Harry usually comes by, carrying a plate full of his own lunch—and “lunch” is a loose term that, according to Harry, encompasses an unspeakable amount of sweets for a midday meal—and chats with Draco. About lesson plans, about students who are doing very well (or students that aren’t doing so well, but only when Draco has no one in detention to hear), about what sort of quills Draco uses and how is his mother doing and about the scarf Harry saw in the shop that reminded him of Draco and about will Draco come to dinner with him again, it’s been ages since they’ve eaten out together and eating out is no fun alone.
, August 3rd, 1996, and you’re in October of 1998. You already experienced everything that happens to you today.”
feels as if he sees right through Harry.
Draco can hear Harry soaping down and rinsing off, and he can tell when Harry starts on the shampoo, can hear the suds hitting the floor. He’s just sort of hovering there, talking through a steamy door.
Harry across the two inches between their foreheads, like Harry’s surrounded by a forcefield. Even after all this time, Draco can never quite be sure whether the prickling he gets all over his skin whenever Harry gets close, stupidly, tinglingly pleasant, is the effect of Harry’s ridiculously powerful magic or the effect of Draco’s ridiculously powerful feelings.
Harry gets up off the bed, and Draco hopes—but then he just sits on the floor, so that he’s at eye level with Draco. No wonder he had so many boyfriends. He’s bloody charming when he wants to be. “Draco… so many of them are about the past. They’re things people have no current control over.”
Jacobs’ eyebrows jump. “No.”
“Wh—” Malfoy turns his head to the side, like a curious puppy, his brow furrowed. He licks his bottom lip. “The—”
He wants to say
Harry doesn’t say anything, though he makes this sort of huffy breath sound, like he’s not sure if he’s supposed to laugh, so he’s doing it half-way. Draco understands why he would be confused.
“Pansy,” Harry says impulsively, not particularly pleased with the direction of his thoughts, “how do you expect me to bring Malfoy back to our time? I mean… he’s not just going to grab my hand and go.”
“Harry—” Draco hates himself for the way his voice wobbles. “Why are you even asking?”
Harry should have it all.
It’s like he doesn’t want Harry to get any sleep tonight. Harry finds himself smiling anyway. He’s not sure how that smile got there.
Draco has nothing for Harry. “I’m sorry,” he says again. “I’m sorry. I know.”
” It’s supposed to be a question. Or really, it
“That’s what I said, isn’t it?”
It doesn’t make sense.
Draco can tell it’s meant to be teasing, but it’s not exactly coming off right. His heart tugs.
I’m going to go get that
“You weren’t meant to die,” Draco says. His voice shakes. He doesn’t try to fix it. “Don’t ever fucking say that. You’re not some fucked up mistake of the universe—” He’s leaning so far forward in his chair across from Harry that his plate is about to fall off of his lap. He sets it on the floor and kneels in front of Harry, right in his line of sight. When Draco meets Harry’s gaze, Harry drops his eyes. “You’re
The truth probably hasn’t occurred to Harry, not once. Because why would Draco be this… heartless? The Draco Malfoy that Draco has tried so hard to be after the war would never do this—but this is the one thing. The
“I was here,” Draco says. The textbook digs into his elbow. “I was always here.”
And kisses him…
The trunk with pictures of him. When Pansy said Harry had “emotional sway.” When Harry grabbed Pansy’s hand and Pansy said Malfoy would kill her. When Pansy promised him Malfoy wasn’t going to hex him.
“Let’s go,” he bursts out, knowing whatever Hermione’s going to say, it isn’t good, and they need to fix this as soon as they can. “Can you get us into his dorm? We’re going to need that extra time turner.”
Malfoy offers Harry a hand in, but looks away as Harry steps in until Harry has let go.
Harry makes an appreciative sound without thinking. It’s not a terrible idea. Of course, he’d never believe a letter that said it was from someone in the future… but maybe Malfoy, who’d grown up in a world full of magic and knew that Time-Turners existed… maybe he would.
Just saying.”
It just
Harry nods, suppressing the irrational urge to laugh. Pansy Parkinson is making the
But Draco hasn’t done anything. He hasn’t done anything but hurt Harry, over and over, every minute of the day. And he knows he’s temporarily thrown Harry’s mind off of the misery, not healed it.
“It would be good,” Harry starts carefully, “If you could tell me
Malfoy’s full on frozen, a complete statue, his expression blank and unreadable. He doesn’t look like he’s breathing; Harry probably has just killed him.
Pansy shakes her hands delicately, spraying water on Harry—not that Harry minds; he’s already soaked—just as snow begins to unfall. “Ugh.” She seems to be gearing up to complain, brushing off her probably very expensive robes, when she pauses. “You called him Draco.”
So Draco takes a shower.
Pansy gestures for him to stop and points to a door—grand as all the rest of them, with this shiny, metal-worked handle and a pretty lock, and then puts her hands palm-to-palm and pretends to rest her head on them.
because Harry would absolutely have his head.
So it makes sense that Harry gets off the broom and steps over to get in front of Malfoy and kisses him.
“So do you,” Harry says, not fooled. “You smell like a candle shop.”
“Has Harry Potter ever expressed a dislike of your company or your person?”
“I’m a little…” Malfoy’s saying, his voice all pitchy. His hands are still on Harry’s, not exactly holding them, just… there, his palms sort of pressed to the backs of Harry’s hands. “I’m sort of… Well. You know…”
It’s more about making sure Harry’s boyfriend deserves him, but Draco can’t say that. It would sound… it would sound far too sentimental. And really, it’s not as if Draco’s questions actually help determine whether someone deserves Harry.
“Too much?” Harry steps up to Malfoy and gently takes the Firebolt from him, dropping it onto the air, where it hovers obediently, waiting. “Sorry. Come on, let’s get you back. You’re probably tired. I know
he says, which is more applicable to Harry, who does sports and sex.
Don’t they have a
“Oh, stop,” Harry grumbles. Over his embarrassment, he faintly realizes that Malfoy’s reaction is a little bit of a weird one. “It’s not a big fucking deal.”
He doesn’t seem like he is.
“Will you take the Boyfriend Check?”
“Mmm. You didn’t last very long with anyone else, either, Potter.”
“I’m not
.” Harry grabs the sides of the boat as it gently scrapes against the land, coming to a stop. “You could just tell me. Or have you, and I didn’t notice?”
But lunch, lunch is a close second.
They watch it spin for a while. People blur down the walkway so fast they can barely see them at all, windows open and shut, leaves swirl backwards—and then the time spins even faster, faster than it did when Harry went back with Hermione. The sun rises and sets; the bushes ungrow and the flowers unbloom. They get very wet as rain unfalls.
“These identify your soulmates, most commonly known as someone you’re romantically destined to be with, with who you will live a happily ever after with—but this isn’t always the case. Sometimes soulmates can be platonic. Sometimes they can be platonic one way and romantic another way. Sometimes they can be unrequited altogether. These last two can be the source of great emotional pain and suffering.”
He looks up at the rest of them before he starts thinking about Malfoy’s clothes. And maybe his underclothes.
is obvious,” Harry says. “
But, like, is there?
“Pretty good one, yeah.”
Right now, Harry’s being extra-distracting, because he’s trying to
Malfoy’s flush disappears, and he looks faint again. “Now look what you’ve done,” he says, in Pansy’s direction. He doesn’t answer Harry, or even look his way.
you were in love with me.”
Harry’s sharp green eyes flash at him. There are tears caught in his eyelashes.
“One might even think you’d already met your soulmate and he was severely disappointing,” Harry jokes. He’s teasing. It’s scary how close and how far he can be from the truth at the same time.
“I didn’t mean to hurt you,” Draco murmurs, barely getting it out around the lump in his throat. “I never wanted to hurt you.”
“I feel…” Harry’s eyes flutter open, and he sits back just far enough to look Draco in the eye. “I feel like I’ve been searching for you.”
Draco hates himself.
” he says, shutting off the sink. “Are you making fun of me?”
Harry doesn’t think Malfoy’s situation is that laughable, but he doesn’t need to start another argument. “I think you are a good person who used to be a Death Eater,” he says simply. “I think that if you had felt safe—not just physically, but from your father’s disappointment—I think you wouldn’t have become a Death Eater at all.”
Pansy just blinks at him. “Are you joking? I can’t tell.”
“Goodnight, Draco,” he says. “See you tomorrow.”
he was going to say. Like sunshine. It looks like Harry hasn’t played all afternoon like he usually does—just a half-hour or something. He smells pleasantly like the sun and like his cologne.
, that voice. “Yeah,” he manages.
Malfoy takes a step back, almost hitting the wall, and turns away, opening his mouth like he’s going to shout at Pansy before realizing that it’s four thirty in the morning. He turns back to Harry. “I can’t believe you saw that.”
to the positives. If I may.”
Draco would sell his soul to see him do it again, but he doesn’t have to. Harry grabs Draco’s hand and smiles, he takes Draco to dinner and he smiles, he catches Draco’s eye while they’re grading and he smiles.
Instead: “Harry.”
Draco swallows and sits back, finishing off the last of his tea. “Alright. You have two half-strikes, which is one strike. Two strikes and you’d be out.”
, when they reach the back door. Harry does.
Draco clears his throat. “As you all know, we are all… born with soulmarks.”
Parkinson grips him tighter and her nails bite into his skin. Harry is very much awake, obviously; he doesn’t need to pinch himself.
Malfoy’s breath rushes across his skin in short gasps when they pull apart, and before Harry can say a word, Malfoy’s on him again, hands now flat on Harry’s chest, mouth chasing Harry’s when Harry needs to draw a breath.
Harry casts a Silencing Charm just in cast, even though he suspects people are still asleep—
that.” He likes the name in his mouth more than he should. “Anyway, don’t tell him, or he’ll hex me into next Sunday. Or maybe into present day.”
“Nope,” Harry says. “What do we do now?”
“The day he got the Dark Mark, and he left half an hour or so ago,” Pansy answers, “Which would’ve been a lot shorter if we could’ve just gotten this done. He went off… somewhere towards the forest—I think so no one would possibly find him—he’s always been dramatic….”
“Pansy!” Malfoy gasps out, sounding like he’s just run a marathon.
Harry gently disentangles himself from Malfoy, as much as he doesn’t really want to, and unloops the Time-Turner from his neck, handing it off to Malfoy. “Are you okay?” he asks hesitantly. Malfoy looks dazed and flushed, his eyes wide and his breath short. “Do you think…” He swallows. “Do you think being back in time for so long did… something?”
Harry turns.

“No!” Pansy cries out, “No, come
you Gryffindor idiots! We have enough of you already.”
“Potter, be a House Elf, will you, and grab me a tissue?”
The way Malfoy’s looking at him now is not doing Harry’s knees any favors. His stomach is fluttering like crazy.

This seems to work well. Perhaps looking each other in the face is too explosive, but back to back they can sort of manage.
I think this'll be about 2-3 more chapters, just FYI... thank you so much for reading!
"Oh,” Malfoy said, looking pleased, “I don't think I'd have trouble getting permission to accompany you, if you – if you wanted me to. I think you underestimate how badly McGonagall feels about how difficult your first few months have been."
“Barley-thorn? Haven’t you got anything that won’t make me see double?”
“He hasn’t told you why he left?”
Harry had known this on some level, but it was strangely painful to hear it admitted out loud. Malfoy still hadn't turned -- he was addressing the lake in front of him.
For some reason this made it very hard to concentrate on what other people were saying.
It sang in him, seeking release, seeking a target, and Harry grit his teeth not only against the pain, now, but against his own magic, banging against the walls of his body like it might break through.
"What made you think of it?"
“Now, for the good stuff,” said Betsy. “Here, gimme that for a sec. Okay so if you’re holding it like this –” she demonstrated, wrapping her beringed fingers around the handle “—then right here you’ll feel a little raised knot in the wood. Go on, try it. Feel it? That’s what you’ll be pressing to release your wand – and I haven’t set the enchantment yet, because I needed you here to activate it, we’ll do it in a minute, but anyway it’ll only pop out for you, okay? No one else’ll be able to get it out. It’ll take some practice before it feels totally natural but you strike me as pretty persistent so I bet you’ll have it down by the end of the week, and I swear it’ll actually be quicker in the long run than snatching it out of your pocket. I put a charm on the cane that’ll register intention, too, so if you accidentally press the knot you don’t have to worry about your wand popping out whenever you’re just like walking around the school or whatever. Got all that?”
Now Harry was staring, because the braid had revealed Betsy's ears, which were not like any ears Harry had seen before. They were thin and long and very pointed. He saw Draco notice him noticing them, and quickly looked away as they were ushered out of the shop. He barely had time to babble a thank-you and be bone-crushingly hugged goodbye before they were on the street again, rain misting in Draco's hair.
“Good timing,” said Draco, as she kissed his cheek. “Tea?”
"Haven't the foggiest," Harry said faintly.
He, Harry Potter, had left his wand behind, for the first time in his entire adult life.
“Er,” Negasi said, speaking up at last. “On second thought, it could wait til tomorrow, couldn’t it? Harry, you look a bit – a bit –”
“Just my fucking luck,” he groaned. “
Again, Hanna. "Leg-Locker binds your legs together, doesn't it? This just keeps the one leg straight."
“Bossy,” Draco said, but he did as he was told. Finally, his lips – those beautiful, sneering, perfect lips – touched Harry’s; gently at first, a careful warm press of skin on skin, but when Harry reached up to fist his good hand in Draco’s stupid sweatshirt to pull him closer, Draco deepened the kiss, his lips parting, tongue sweeping in to meet Harry’s, so hot and messy and good that Harry’s back arched of its own accord. Pain lanced through him but it mingled with the pleasure he felt at Draco’s touch and he didn’t mind, only tilted his head to get a better angle, wrapping his good arm around Draco’s neck and pulling him half on top of his own body, desperate for more contact as Draco sucked Harry’s lower lip into his mouth and bit down, hand tangling in Harry’s hair, lips on the stubble at his jaw, below his ear, down his neck, and –
"Did you manage to find them?"
"Thank you, Annie," Draco said and the woman smile at him before talking to Ashton. The woman, okay I'm sorry, Arianna's godmother,
"I'm home!" Draco came back two minutes later.
"Auntie," Arianna cried.
"Raven!" Severus said. Coming closer to Arianna and give her a supporting hug.
"I thought that casserole was my recipe! Annie!" Draco says dramatically looking at Annie. And that the starting of a 'friendly' argument between Annie and Draco, with Ashton of course.
Draco gasp for air as he rises from his bed. Tiny giggles filled his bed as a weight crashed to his lap.
!!!" Arianna says as she hugs the man that just enter the house.
Verendus survive the incident, he almost didn't make it but here he is. Unlike Cepheus, he died in the incident, covered by his blood with a big gashed on his stomach. The twin mourns the death of their kitten the next day.
"Or maybe he sleeps with another man that looks exactly like you Harry,"
"Ver, tomorrow is my mother's birthday. What should I gave him?" Arianna asked the sleeping direwolf. She chuckled when Verendus sneeze, before playing again.
Reminder if there are any grammar mistakes, it's because I'm from Indonesia and my English at writing is sucks. Hope you like it!
It's just a nightmare, please let it not be real.
"Afternoon Aziel, hope these two didn't cause any trouble,"
"I'm worried that one day she'll kill your cat while doing that," Ashton said to Draco, and Draco silently agrees. He may

"What," Aziel asks. Trying not to hex the wolf for ruining his pants, Verendus just keep staring at him before he headed upstairs. Hearing a growl coming from the staircase, Aziel grunts but follow either way.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Lucius is now panicking. He rarely saw his granddaughter cry, and the sound outside the room sounds like danger.
It felt like hours when they stopped. Arianna quickly came to her mother when the woman releases her.
"Upstairs, second door to the left," Draco said before heading to the kitchen.
"Are you sure?" Arianna asks, looking at the bruise on her godmother cheek and some other scar.
"Really?"
"He wants me to climb at his back," Arianna whisper. Aziel looked confused because all he could hear was a whimper that the wolf did.
"If your mother had died years ago, you wouldn't be watching this! But here you are,"
At her 9th birthday.
Behind the three arguing wizards as ND muggle. Aziel carried, now sleeping twins on both of his arms while Arianna walks beside him, her tiny hand grips to Aziel's trench coat.
"Arianna, it's alright dear. Anyway, your uncle Adrian and aunt Riverna are going to be here at noon and they won't be happy to see you sad," Draco says.
"It's alright mother, I'll keep you company,"
(See the end of the chapter for
"...Cloak while he's in a meeting!"
"Mommy!!"
Second, 's later a sky blue ribbon appears on Arianna's little hands. Draco said a silent thank you for the house-elf before doing his daughter's hair.
Arianna woke up when she heard a loud noise coming from downstairs. Shaking Verendus to wake up, the wolf jump from the bed and went to the door.
"I don't know... But if he's with us who will accompany Ver? They can have a bonding time while we buy some ice cream," Arianna says, ruffling Scorpius' hair. The youngest pout but nodded either way.
"Annie dear, let go of Ari okay. Look at her! She's suffocating," Draco said again and this time the woman let go.
"Aw! He's cute! Can we have him, Mom!" Arianna says. The kitten meows like he agreed with Arianna and starts climbing from Scorpius' hand to Arianna's shoulder.
"I'm fine baby," his voice is barely a whisper. But suddenly his daughter was taken away from him.
The potion room is next to their Mother's room, where Arianna can hear a faint son coming from there. She isn't stupid, that man had the same eyes as her and messy black hair like Thomas. For nine years of her life, she never asks where's he is or what he looks like. She knows it brings great pain to their Mother.
The three kids explore the pet shop with beaming eyes. Draco remembers the night before, Arianna and the twin were in her room all night after dinner discussing what animal should they adopt. And they decided to get a cat.
"Alright! Got to pull you away before you make my daughter faint,"
"Mom..!!!!"
"It's not about them 'mione," Harry whisper, making Hermione confused.
"Yes I'm fine, now go!" Annie yelled pushing Arianna away when a spell was shoot at them.
"Ready!" Arianna says. Her mother smile and signaling the twins to stand up.
"You okay Harry?" Hermione ask. He's now back at the ministry for a case, leaving his second wife, Ginny, and their son, James.
"Well now I know my baking skills are improving, now let's eat everyone! Dinner ain't gonna disappeared itself!" Annie says.
"Alright, but one each! We have to get back home soon," Draco laughed as they enter the pet shop.
"Well arrive in a minute Raven, want me to carry you?"
Draco could only shake his head at the twin's behavior. Every time they went to their Godfather's house, they'll put some prank on him and didn't care what will happen, the worst is Aziel's partner cooperate with the two.
"Well... I'm.." Draco stutter.
"Grandma, uncle Sev!" Arianna mumbled before crying even louder. Lucius and Tom stare at each other and left the room. The hall was empty, giving them a perfect time to talk.
Arianna turns around and saw a man and woman came closer to them. The woman was glaring at her mother, but the man is looking at them.
"Tired?" Aziel ask. Arianna looks up and shook her head, but her eyes tell the other way.
"Where are the twins?" Tom asks after a few minutes of silence.
"I swear to you mother, auntie, I'll find them and bring them to justice,"
"Mother!" Arianna said. Verendus gave a warning growl when they heard someone, no, a woman yelling at her godmother.
"Can we bring Cepheus, Ari?" Scorpius asks.
"Not until you came here Weasel," her mother replied.
"Moony, can you get Scorp a cup of milk please," Arianna says to the house-elf. Seconds later, a cup full of milk appears on the coffee table and some fresh bread from the pantry.
"Yes Raven, is something wrong?" Draco asks.
For three days, Arianna has to stay at St. Mungo's because of the trauma she had. She missed her mother badly after that incident.
"Oh, that didn't come in mind,"
"And that will be it if you want to know why..." Draco paused and slap Aziel's hand just before he grabs another sandwich.
"I'm sure 'mione! The three look like a carbon copy of me and Malfoy!"
"Apologize!" Thomas yelled, but the person protest.
"And who would they be? You didn't kidnap these poor children did you Malfoy, can't have these poor children near you,"
But his attack failed when Verendus charge and bite his arm. The man screams as he tried to get Verendus away, screaming like a mad man.
"Thomas, no," she glared at her brother before looking at the person. He had messy black hair and a pair of brown eyes who is glaring at them.
"Ee just net a lew houls aho, hauntie," Arianna said while still being hugged by the woman.
"Arianna, my dear granddaughter!" Narcissa cried seeing her granddaughter like this, so does Lucius.
"Everything is 50 galleon, write your address here and we'll deliver it to your house immediately," the lady says. Draco handed the money and write down their house address.
The four walks out of the store and go straight to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, well the twins ran there while Ari and Draco have some small talk.
Arianna was sitting on her bed reading a book or not. She wasn't paying attention to any of the words in the book, she was looking at a picture of his mother with someone. She stole this picture when she was around five years old when her mother isn't looking.
Harry couldn't forget the face of Malfoy's children when they meet in Diagon Alley.
"There's no more auntie for you, you little gremlin!" The younger woman said. she came closer to where Arianna stood and grabbed her arm, making the bowl she was holding fall.
She saw the twins yesterday. They look fine, and that's good. She doesn't want them to see the same thing as she did.
"Arianna!" She heard her mother's voice.
"So! Wanna watch a movie before going to sleep?" Annie asks when Aziel and Ashton disappear.
"Arianna comes here darling, let me do your hair," Draco says. Arianna quickly got up from her reading and giggles as Draco put her on his lap.
her grandfather asks.
And Annie. She died as well, one of the culprits use the unforgivable curse at her. Her ceremony will be held tomorrow as the whole town mourn her death.
Any comments are welcome! If you all have something to recommend I'll try to make it happen and reply.
"Let's finish this!" She said.
"Why are my eyes green?" Arianna asks, sitting beside Draco who is feeding little Thomas.
"So we attack tonight?"
"Wake up Mommy! Or uncle Sev and uncle Tom would be angry for being late!" Draco's 2-year-old daughter says. Felt like yesterday his little Raven was just a baby and now she is already running around the mansion.
The voices are now louder. She could hear furniture being thrown, the sound of her Godmother yelling her mother's name, and some new voices she never knew.
Even now.
Then everything went dark.
"Dobby, could you get me a blue ribbon for Arianna's hair," Draco said.
Now here she is. Sitting in one of St. Mungo's hospital room where her mother stay. In her hand was a crystal pendulum that her mother always wears she know this pendulum means something to her mother.
More characters may show up in the next chapter, so be ready!
"Nnnoooo, I'm not tired," Arianna mumbled, rubbing her head on Aziel's hip making Aziel shook his head. Out of nowhere, the direwolf showed up and nudge the side of Arianna's palm.
"Got a problem with that!" Thomas yelled, and got a kick from his sister.
And five minutes later she got bored and went inside. Calling Moony to put her guitar back in her room then went to sit on the sofa. Cepheus who is sleeping at his cat bed quickly got up climbed up to the sofa and sat on Arianna's lap. Purring when Ari scratches the spot behind his ears.
says Lizzie.
“Do you need a charger?”
Malfoy smiled unsmilingly. "It is. Try it out, and be honest with me."
“Yeah, haha, definitely not. But don’t think I’ll forget you promised to come visit when Mona’s back in town. I already owled her and said I had a surprise, so you can’t go back on your word!”
At the door, he knocked out a bright rhythm and arranged a sheepish smile on his face; he was a Muggle motorist, out of petrol, he was harmless, he was friendly, he was absolutely under no circumstances a famously hotheaded wizard come to destroy anyone who got between himself and Draco Malfoy.
“He doesn’t take directions well,” Draco drawled from the doorway.
"I've portioned out this dose myself," Malfoy said. "Too little is useless; too much could kill you right here. I have complete faith in my own skill and believe I've portioned it perfectly, but I understand if you don't share that belief and choose not to take it. I give you my absolute word as a Healer that I have only your best interest in mind, despite whatever... whatever lies between us."
“Okay so yeah just enjoy it and let me know if there’s anything that needs tweaking or fixing and futzing!” Betsy kissed them both and gave Draco an extra-long squeeze. “Mona says hello,” she said. “You should owl her, she’s bored shitless out there in the North American rain.”
"I don't know if it will work," Neville said, flushing with pleasure.
"Do you have any left?"
Harry didn’t know how to summarize it in a way that wouldn’t make him look like an idiot. “He was… hovering.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Negasi said, practically wringing his hands. “I forgot, shit, sorry.”
Malfoy gave him a considering look. "Well -- you could. Given the givens."
His rage swelled in him, hot and roaring and nearly tangible, a boiling wind, and he knew this feeling. He’d felt it before, in another fucking basement, almost two years ago when he’d thought he was going to die and he’d exploded not only his chains but several heads. He hadn’t known what to do with this feeling then; it had exploded out of him on a wave of pure instinct; but he thought he might know now. He fought down the pain, fought down the rage, fought everything except that hot wind, and he used the last of his focus to stare at Draco’s chains, and he
“I’m frightfully sorry to bother you. But I’ve run out of petrol down over that hill and I was wondering if I could use your phone to have a mate come and get me.”
"Yes, very much."
Ron winced. "Hang on, darling!" he shouted, going over to the cupboard. "I'm going to whip you up a Hair of the Dog potion!"
"It was in all the papers, you know," Malfoy added.
In fact, Harry wanted nothing more than to get back to Hogwarts, draw a hot bath, pour himself a healthy glass of whiskey, and soak his aching body – and somewhere in there, maybe kiss Draco Malfoy a bit more. Or a lot more. On second thought, maybe sod the bath and whiskey and just kiss Draco, that sounded like a nice evening.
"Did you ever train together?" one boy asked, Jacob: the same who'd come to his office to ask about the Floo.
"Oh, don't," Hermione moaned, coming out of the bathroom. Ron added a pinch of something red to whatever he was making and then handed a glass each to Harry and Hermione. Hermione drank it immediately, so Harry took a tentative sip, as well.
“Hi,” Harry said.
It tasted of licorice and salamanders, but it did the trick marvelously. His aching head stopped throbbing, his stomach settled, his slight mist of boozy sweat began to dry.

"I'm trying to decide the answer to that question right now."
you; and I’m massaging it because I’m a trained Healer and I can feel how absolutely buggered your muscles are right now. Can’t I do both things at once?”
"Ha, ha. Let's see -- I have an American bourbon aged in unicorn horns; a Muggle scotch from Japan; and a local catnip whiskey, which is much nicer than it sounds."
Another man had joined them, very tall and pale in dark robes. “To be frank,” he said, “I’m still a bit bewildered that we’re bestowing such a gift upon a
"You took all the ingredients for a standard St. Mungo's curse-dampening pain potion, and then you left the potions classroom an absolute mess."
“All right?” Negasi said uncertainly.
"Well," Harry said. He moved to take a seat and then, remembering how uncomfortable the seat in question was, decided to lean on the back of it instead. "You seem like a man with a lot of nice things."
I’m not – that isn’t me, I’m not Harry Potter.” Harry winced at Draco’s dubious expression and started again. “I mean, I am, obviously, I didn’t hit my head that hard, but I’m not – I didn’t come after you because I’m
"I eat here every day, just like you," he said. "And every fucking day I have to deal with this, every fucking day I come here and pray I'll get up these fucking stairs, and it never gets any easier. We're bloody wizards, we can turn tables into bloody teapots but we can't manage a simple fucking railing?”
know."
"Catnip? Sounds interesting."
"You of all people, Potter, should know the depths of evil that can exist in this world. Careful!" He hissed the last word as they reached the top step and Harry began to stride in the direction of his rooms. But how could he be careful? It felt so good to move like this, to move as he once had, unthinking, letting his body carry him instinctually.
"Look -- what?" Harry followed his pointing finger. There, above the Quidditch pitch, players were swooping like enormous birds, and one of the fliers was angling upwards, flying straight and fast and true.
"It's harder if I'm concentrating," Harry explained.
It was not. He cracked out of nothing right next to a man at a urinal, and narrowly missed getting sprayed with piss when the terrified fellow swung around. Harry modified the poor man’s memory and suggested he leave the pub, then pushed open the washroom door and went out into a dingy, low-lit hallway. He took a moment to consciously try and relax, because his tension wasn’t doing his body any favors and his shoulder kept sending spasms of pain through his back. He rolled his neck carefully, shook out his right hand where it had a death-grip on his cane, and went into the pub.
“I need to use your Floo,” Harry said. “Hi Rosie! Sorry, d’you mind?”
"I told you, I'll come show her anyway, no need to --"
"I'm here," said a small boy in the front row.
"No, never been."
Her expression softened and he felt guilty playing the invalid card the one night he actually didn't need it. He gave up on his fork and swapped it for his wand, performing a neat little charm that cut his entire plate of food into bite sized pieces -- including, unfortunately, the napkin that got caught in the crossfire. Little bits of linen flew everywhere.
“Who’s this source?” Harry barked. “Have they been vouched for by anyone we know? Did you see any authentication papers for the venom? Is he meeting anyone there or going alone?”
"Oh!" said Hermione. "That's brilliant!"
“Please,” Harry said, trying to look grateful. Fine. Whether or not Negasi had made it in yet, Harry was moving onto Plan B. The moment the man glanced down at his phone’s screen, Harry released his wand.
Harry had succeeded in removing his coat, and was now succeeding in lying down. "Okay," he murmured. "Good night."
Unless you counted Malfoy. But Harry wasn't
Harry, who was always floored by good news, nearly dropped the water glass he'd just reached for.
A hand shot up so fast that Harry thought fondly of Hermione. "Yes, you in the red -- Maggie, is it?"
She pulled him to his feet with a decent show of strength and then spent rather a long time measuring him, in ways that made sense and in ways that did not. She measured the length of his leg, which seemed apropos, but then measured the length of his nose, which seemed a bit beside the point. She made him stick his hand in a plate of goo to take an “impression,” then measured around his hips like she was fitting him for trousers. It was all very mysterious.
It was warm inside, blessedly so, and he caught the faint, seductive scent of a wood fire; a smell that made his stiff joints cry out for heat.
"If you can shout at me like that, you can call be by my name, I think," she said.
And now it was happening, what he’d been dreading all day: his body was giving up on him. All those ruined joints were turning sickly liquid like in his memories, his fingers flaring with pain, wrist spasming, shoulder hanging like dead, agonizing weight, his hip buckling, his knee –
By the time they got to Hogsmeade, Harry was flagging badly and trying to pretend he wasn’t. His hip felt like someone had taken a hammer to it, and his arm was hanging so heavily on his bad shoulder that he’d unbuttoned part of his jacket so he could tuck his hand inside like a portrait of Napoleon and get some weight off it. He was very much looking forward to sitting down on one of Betsy’s excellent sofas.
"Hi Professor Malfoy!" Jacob piped up.
“Blimey,” Neville said as Harry opened the door a moment later. “You’re scary good at that, mate.”
Harry blinked, and then, for want of anything better to say, "Thanks?"
"Tomorrow, then -- come during my office hours."
As if reading his mind, Malfoy said, "I suppose I should tell you. The things I used to believe, about bloodright, and magical superiority, all of it... I don't believe those things anymore." He'd turned towards the water and the smooth, muscled planes of his back glowed in the sun.
“What about this?” Neville said, holding open a file so Harry could see it. It was labeled “In Search Of” and appeared to be a list of rare supplies and what they might be used for. Sure enough, near the top of the list was “Finicky Rattler Venom: eyelash growth; teeth strengthening; resistance to sunburn; flexibility (HP?)”
"Stop," he said, spluttering and wet, "Stop, I'm fine, no, don't call for help, please, I just got tired."
"Go on."
Ron chewed his lip for a moment. “All right,” he said finally, “I’ll get you a coat. Should I – do you want me to come? I could bring Rosie to George, or if he can’t watch her, I could try –”
Harry did not make it to breakfast the next day.
“It doesn’t matter,” Malfoy said. “It’s just some piece of pureblood scum.”
Harry choked.
Ron didn't push it and Harry was grateful. "Well, she's good and Stuck," he said. "UnStick her if you want to give her back, but if you want to keep her I reckon you could let her go to drink your pint, after all. She's not going anywhere."
"Yeah, I had my own shop back in L.A. but it got super boring. Here." Betsy was giving him back his wand, eyes misty as if parting with a dear friend. "Mind standing up? That couch is kinda deep, here, grab on."
Harry aimed his wand between the man’s eyes. “I’m needing a bit more than
costume," George corrected, as Hermione came back into the living room, her eyes damp.
The sun was lower on the horizon, the light turning from bright white to gold, and the next time Malfoy swam his return lap, he said, "I'm going to get out. Are you --?"
The barkeep stopped shouting and glared up mulishly instead. He looked ridiculous lying rigid on the floor with his head still wriggling this way and that, but Harry didn’t have much sense of humor at the moment and couldn’t appreciate the absurdity.
"And are you going for like a traditional, historical vibe, or like a holy Merlin check me out I'm a wizard vibe, or a this is my very functional cane vibe...?"
Harry would have liked to have left the table right then and gone up into his own chambers where he could be frustrated and exhausted in peace – but leaving would cause a scene, and a scene would engender even more questions and staring and fussing, so he ate the bread quietly and managed enough dinner that Neville couldn’t complain and then, trying very hard to smile and seem perfectly normal, he pushed back from the table and said goodnight.
"Hullo, Professor," she said. "I only wanted -- to give you --" She darted forward and put the card on his bed, then turned to flee.
"You ever going to let me forget that?" Ron said, and with a crack they were in the cottage. George was sitting up on the couch, yawning, but Hermione was nowhere to be seen.
"Yeah -- it's excellent. I can't thank you enough for the idea."
“Okay,” Kevari said, finishing the charm. “Can you repeat back what I just told you?”
“What about?”
"Join your -- but Lucius is dead. So you're telling me Malfoy's been getting death threats?"
Harry groaned and clapped his hands over his ears. "Lower your volume, Ron, please. My head can't take it."
“Well, I don’t
, which is easily the nicest thing he’s ever said to me.”
"Just there, he's coming towards us. Blue robes."
him. And he wasn't sneering at any of them. He wasn't smiling, either, but then, Malfoy almost never smiled, but there was something nevertheless warm about his face, something crinkly about his eyes -- and was it possible that Malfoy, like McGonagall, was a not-a-smile smiler? How had Harry never noticed this?
They were in the warm, damp greenhouse now, their shoes covered in mud, and Neville took a deep breath of the fragrant air and smiled. Then he frowned.
Harry jerked his head up at the sound of his voice, then doubled over. “Aah –”
“Shh, darling,” Ron cooed, “shut up, please, shhh.”
It took two tries to get Harry to his feet, but they managed eventually and Ron slung his arm around Harry's shoulders.
"Hermione, it's always bothering me."
Harry blinked. He hadn’t realized he’d been staring. “Fine. Yes.”
"Have you never sat in it?"
“Ten strawberry daiquiris for this gentleman,” Harry said, grinning.
“Professor!” gasped one of his first years as he came out of the Floo – first time without stumbling, thanks to the added support. “What’s happened to you?”
