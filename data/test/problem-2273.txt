His hand was on his wand before he could blink, rising just slowly enough so he wouldn’t be seen, only to point his wand right towards Snape’s eyeball. Stressed, and looking like ten years had been taken off his life, the Professor sighed, and then reached out and patted his shoulder.
“What is this?”
If nothing else, angering his favorite red-head would be a perk of tonight.
Draco doesn’t know what to say, but he should probably say something because it’s not every day that one encounters a clearly dead person who isn’t a ghost and is also apparently connected to the
His imagination is, however,
It’s an order, not a request, that’s punctuated by Draco grabbing his hand and
“Are you alright? You didn’t come tonight, there’s been another attack, and it’s bad. I got worried.”
After his hideous meltdown, he refuses to admit that he had hugged Krecher and cried like a baby, they start on the kitchen. The three of them work quietly at first, the only noise pots and pans moving, but then Sirius brings the awful boombox he’d gotten when he moved into his own place and before he knows it he and Remus are dancing around the kitchen to some muggle named Elton John, and then Krecher changes the tune after they accidentally break one plate.
Hermione’s snap comes two days before the final Quidditch match of the season, the one that determines who wins the cups. Finals are only three weeks away, and he’d honestly been expecting this since she came in their abandoned classroom raving like a howler about how pointless Divination is. As much as Draco and Pansy had agreed with her, it still scared the rest of their merry crew enough that Weasley didn’t even glare at them. Blaise had actually given Draco some Calming Draught to add to his Headache Potion the day after.
you still standing?”
Nagini: i'm a joy to be around!
Draco gapes at her, Blaise and Pansy similar pictures beside him. “You- You killed him?!”
“You’re a right bastard.” He manages once he’s covered the taste up by nearly burning off his taste buds. Blaise just grins at him, starting up another conversation about how excited he is to meet his mom’s latest boyfriend,  the one from summer having proved a tad bit too clingy for the woman.
Theo stops by again, exactly two weeks apart from seeing Draco for the first time. He finds Draco in Mrs. Daisy’s shop, in his usual counter seat, head bent over
“It’s already four?” Hermione sighs longingly at the book in her hand. “I have to be home for dinner…”
“I’d say take Astoria, but Daph would kill me.” Millie pipes up.
Oh dear Merlin, lying really is always the right answer. Draco takes a deep breath.
“Does he just not sleep?” Draco eventually snaps. In truth he’s just a little cranky because it’s a little rude to sleep when you’re supposed to be helping.
“She did, take me to France I mean. She hasn't gotten a new husband yet, I think the whole blood contract thing is getting to her, but she’s happy I have people to protect me, even if she did curse me in every language I know, and a few I don’t.”
He’ll do it in the summer, when he’s trapped at the Dursleys’ with nothing better to do than read about the dead people that might have loved him.
“First thing’s first, you are safer here than you are at Hogwarts, got it? If someone so much as looks at you funny in this house they’ll be kicked out immediately. We love you and will give Narcissa a run for her money with our protectiveness. That means you’re free, okay? You can say what you want, do what you want, wear what you want. Okay?”
“And he’s just going to let it go?” Carla asks later at lunch.
people get hurt, no one in their right mind would expect to throw off Riddle’s curses, much less stop him before he got one spell in. You’ve done nothing wrong, and if you keep insisting that you have, I am going to
“Grab Hedwig’s cage, she can follow us.”
The snake his ancestors knew.
Pansy, one day later: *screaming*
“Sleepings? Not very well, but-”
“Merlin I’m so excited to see you out of these! When Draco said we were taking you shopping we just had to come, advice and all that.”
“Master Draco!”
She’s red in the face when she finishes and Draco suddenly has a whole new level or respect for her. From the look on Blaise’s face and the way Pansy lowers her wand, his friends are feeling the same way.
Draco refrains from speaking, lest he tell her about what his father thought of him opening packages, even if they were addressed to him.
“Who’re you talkin to, boy?!” Vernon yells, flinging open the door.
He ends up going several places and finding several bits and pieces for his kitchen.
Draco cries with delight, “Oh Dobby! That’s wonderful! Where will you go? What will you do?”
“Honey, your rant would be much better in English.”
They’re all laughing and giddy, and then he notices that neither of them are in pajamas, and it’s only nine in the morning….
The wards aren’t there?
because you were busy in your own world more like it.”
Which leaves him with the question: why are there only two beds?
Draco turns to the group, grabbing whoever’s hand is nearest. “Link hands! We can’t be separated! We’re going to have to run but you
“Don’t you fucking dare. She’s like
“I did not! Dobby would never betray Master Draco!”
“-And then, could you sign it?”
And when Harry sees his outfit, he all but screams in frustration. No wonder Seeker thought Cedric was a second choice.
“Don’t know who I am?! Why that’s a travesty! I am the one, the only-“
At least Hermione is finally not yelling at him. “Asklepios was the Greek wizard who came up with modern medicine! He was a genius! Without him we wouldn’t have any of our healing charms, even the ones for common colds! His work was amazing!”
had been enough to drive Harry out.
“I didn’t think three days had gone by!”

“Right, so. I don’t understand why Harry is still alive-okay I didn’t mean it like that but, think about it sir. Black has been around him so many times now, he was
“You can’t keep doing this year after year.”
to the rough treatment,
Hermione huffs, “For crying out loud! If you’re going to tell us about your ancestry will you just get on with it?!”
So, he’s checking on them. Like the good, totally not creepy, worried friend that he is.
“I already know most of it,” She says as she takes a bite of her smore, “I just need your confirmation.”
Draco shoots him a half-smile, following him to one of the empty tables in the common room. “I can’t believe you’re still holding onto that stupid bet with Pansy.”
Draco shakes his head, “Isn’t that a bit much even for him? I think heavy influence is the most likely, after all he would need a solid form to possess someone, right? I’ve heard it’s almost impossible to refuse him once he’s in front of you.”
To top his entire outfit off, Theo insists on jewelry and makeup.
Morgana, knowing she's about to be some kid's toy: fuck.
The first was when he accidentally destroyed Belle’s evening gown, and the only reason he lived through it was because Pansy had been wanting to make a dress anyways, and Blaise is by no means a coward, it’s just that no one fancies dying at the ripe age of eight. Second was when he and Pansy had thought Draco was going to get himself killed, and yes it’s over protective but if one of them had been sneaking around the castle while a giant murderous beast was on the loose, well, he honestly would’ve done the same thing. Blaise isn’t nearly as crazy as his mother is about his safety, but no one wants to see their friends killed by their own stupid actions. The third and last time Blaise had been scared was when Narcissa told them that Riddle is back, but by fuck everyone should be scared of that.
saw Harry again. Stupid idiot cornered him to complain about Ron wanting to ask Hermione to the ball and being sad that she already had a date, laughed at the shit Seeker was spewing, and then squeezed Draco’s arm goodbye. Draco went to dinner, and to run laps with Flint’s overly cheerful ass, feeling slightly better.
“Do try to enjoy your break, Draco. If the items from my storages indicate anything, you will. At least try to be careful, polyjuice potion is particularly hard to manage. If you need help, please come to see me. You deserve a little fun, and if you have to be someone else for it, I’ll keep it secret.”
“Well? Isn’t it funny?” He asks as the paper is handed back to him.
“Hi Uncle Sirius! Hi Uncle Lupin!”
“Anyways,” Theo says a little forcefully, “I haven’t gotten a date yet.”
Draco was proud of not rising to the Quidditch bait, but only because he has the satisfaction of watching Harry’s blood drain from his face. Finally, a way to pay back all those headaches.
“Where is he?! Where-
Standing here he can at least see more than the three people behind him. He can make out details like moss on cold stone, firelight dancing against the stupid stuff, the feeling of a wooden floor, the sense of knowing exactly where he is.
“I’ll get you some for Christmas if you make it past the first task.”
“Godric above I nearly pissed myself when Dumbledore drew his wand at me.” Ron tells him as they walk down the wall. “Really, mate, he went all stoic and said something about me being important to you, then BAM wand in my face. From the most powerful wizard alive, not exactly comforting.”
“Where
“Thank you Dobby, have a good night.”
#######################
A completely unnecessary display, but Draco follows him anyways. It’s hard to ignore being watched with not only Pansy and Blaise following his back, but three new sets of eyes as well. He can’t shake the feeling that he knows who they are.
“But you knew.” Draco manages after moment to collect himself. “You’ve known the whole time that Black wasn’t the real murder...and you still let him rot in Azkaban..”
pay more attention to his classes.
READ BEFORE YOU READ! This chapter talks about what happened to Draco during his time at home, ie TW FOR TORTURE AND ABUSE! I put a line of ########## before and after the graphic bits, so if it bothers you PLEASE SKIP IT! THE DETAILS OF DRACO'S TORTURE THAT MAY DAMAGE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT! I rewrote that scene specifically so that it could be ignored without missing anything vital to the plot! I repeat DO NOT READ IT IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT TYPE OF STUFF!
Draco starts up a chant in his mind;
Making a new potion today, Snape also thought having new partners would be hilarious, most likely a punishment for him being gone so long. His partner, by chance he’s sure, is none other than Potter and Weasley. Merlin he’s going to be sick.
without his family.
“What are the rest of us supposed to do?”
Draco looks up at the voice to see, holy mother of Salazar, the most beautiful man he’d ever seen. Unfortunately wearing Hufflepuff robes, the tall auburn-headed boy smiled at him with twinkling grey-eyes, long fingers holding out one of Draco’s notebooks.
Dead Harry reaches him, grabs the leg of his robes and whispers, “

He clues in with the rest of the team, holding out their broomsticks as Flint continues to take charge, keeping up an air that only Slytherins could produce. Proud, probably obnoxious, definitely pompous, and in every way the perfect deflect from Draco’s nerves, he really owed them later. Right as he’s beginning to get a hold of himself, Granger and Weasley walk onto the field, and if they’re here that means Draco will be perfectly fine. He can deal with pests like these.
“Excuse me?!”
“This,” he explains, “Is a potion to quell anxiety. I used it much in my early days of a spy, and I was a fool to think you wouldn’t need it. One sip of that will get you feeling back to normal, and I’ll teach you how to brew it in our study sessions beginning Monday. Do not protest, Draco, I have suddenly realized how much I have been lacking in guidance to you. You are too young to do this without my help, and I’m sure Albus warned you last year of how taxing it can be, I am sorry to have overlooked the possibility of it overwhelming you, and it will not happen again.”
“I do not know how he found the chamber, or even where it is, but I do know that as soon as it was open the attacks started. They got worse and worse until a young girl was killed. Only then, when he feared punishment and realized how closely eyes began to watch him, did he close it. She was muggle-born, a Ravenclaw, one of the shy ones. Without her glasses, she couldn’t see anything, and everyone knew it. Some people used it to taunt her, she was always one to be bullied, not a single brave bone in her body. I never did get the full story, but one day, she ran into that bathroom crying, and never came out. Riddle got what he wanted in the end. Fear, and his first kill.”
“Potter will live with Remus and Sirius, good. Now that we’ve taken care of that, would you care to beg Sirius for your original question, or perhaps you can apologize to the Malfoys and Weasleys, and myself of course, for this fruitless waste of time.”
in your organization that has a
Watching the back retreat until he can’t see it anymore, he has only two thoughts. One, he really needs to get to Snape. Two, he really hates his father.
Not good. Dumbledore can’t just leave! He can’t protect Potter right now! Or can he? Either way, he can’t sleep anymore, he has to open his eyes, and at least try to get Potter out of here safely...he can handle the torture. Harry can’t.
“It’s a shame that LuLu isn’t here.”
last year, but he disappeared all the same.”
“You know, I don’t mean to pry, but it’s a little strange for a Huffle to be so secretive.”
Narcissa, leading the table to get updates on information:
Two, there’s a giant black dog growling right at Weasley.
“Misty, your house elf, has her own chair?”
Draco’s spell hits the boy straight in the chest. Potter stumbles back, and he has half the mind to hex him again, the first time sent shivers down his spine.
Dobby turns to stare at him in horror before promptly picking up his textbook and ramming it into his head. “Dobby has failed! Dobby has failed Master!”
“Shut up Draco.”
Draco will go mad. Provided he doesn’t kill himself first, and that’s been quite the tempting option since he was fifteen.
Chang, Finnegan, Thomas and Greg stopped coming after the first day. On the second day the search party lost the Greengrass sisters.
Flint raises his eyebrow, “Not to be frank, but your father’s presents will mean more to the team, plus we’ve all seen you fly, we know you have the talent. No one else wants to be Seeker, and that’s what we need. Are you in or not? Snape’s already cleared the field to get you some practice time, it would be a shame not to let the others sleep just because you haven’t made up your mind.”
Narcissa takes a step forward. “We’ll deal with three categories; dueling, sneaking, and heritage. Don’t give me that look Draco, we both know how powerful Pureblood lines are. It would be foolish of us not to utilize our ancestor’s gifts.”
“Well, I’m also only thirteen, aren’t I,” Draco sneers back.
“Dragons. We’re facing dragons.”
“I was busy!” Pansy defends.

“You have a date?” Blaise asks his dance partner, George.
“What do you mean they’re not there?”
Druella, not believing that Sirius can be mature:
Emilia frowns,
The second he sees the guest bedrooms he bursts out laughing. “Really? It’s like you made Blaise and Pans their own rooms.”
He is eventually saved from her antics by one of the Beauxbatons Boys, who are probably the prettiest men Draco’s ever seen. Thank Merlin he has class to distract him from all the other shit. And it’s Ancient Runes with his best friends and Hermione. He must be doing something right because Pansy only complains twice, which is a fucking miracle.

“I think it’ll be about ‘us’ no matter what.”
“Mister Draco did do lots for a wizard who hasn’t used magic in a long time! He being setting the floors, and the stairs, and fixing the holes in the walls, vanishing the dead plants,

His voice is deep, filled with an alluring accent, less
by some muggle named Elton John. Misty preoccupies herself with Salem and the cat toys, Draco flips through the books he got from Howie, learning a few tips and tricks that’ll end up helping him.
Finally, in his big speech, he turns to Howie. “My house would literally be barren if it weren’t for you and your shop. In a weird way, you and Mrs. Alice are the entire reason I get to have a home. You in particular have gotten me to trust- dare I even say

without training? It’s like the boy was asking to die. Draco’s ready to chastise him to no end for that last thing alone, but then he sees the small happy grin Harry has walking back to them and decides it doesn’t matter that much. He might be an idiot, but he hadn’t died yet.
“You’d make a great minister, you know that?”
Their entry way is a little over the top, but that’s just because Narcissa loves pistachio green and Draco’s more of a emerald green person. Even so, their fainting couch by the fireplace used to be one of his favorite napping spots. When he was young he’d curl up next to whichever one of them was reading there and dream of faraway places more magical than himself.
Hermione marches up to the game of Monopoly, grabs Harry by the shirt, ignores the indignant ‘hey!’ and proceeds to give him a verbal lashing.
Finding himself smiling, and maybe a little more hopeful for this year, Draco hops onto his broom. If he couldn’t beat Potter into the ground with his wand in exchange for every heart attack the idiot’s given him, he could at least beat him in Quidditch
Draco slams his mouth shut.
Before anyone can reply, and that does include the traitor in his arms, Draco walks away, robes flapping in the wind, Blaise and Pansy scowling behind him. He ignores the green eyes he can feel piercing his back the entire walk to the castle.

hello! I totally forgot to mention the posting schedule for this! I'll be updating every Friday and Wednesday! Thank you so much for all your kinds words! I started this on a whim and it's by far my favorite thing I've ever written! I'll be responding to all the comments soon and I cannot thank you all enough for enjoying this! Also, I hope you love Mrs. Daisy because I would die for her and Misty both! Anyways, see you Friday!
“That reminds me! Pans and I have been keeping up a correspondence this summer, I think you might want to read them, oh don’t pass them around, just read them out loud Harry.”
To top things off, Flint and Cassius, the evil little bastards, decided to make the old team ‘brush up on drills’ last night, which is code for torture on a lesser degree, and also means Draco didn’t get back until ten minutes after curfew, was freezing cold, and still had to help Blaise with his Potions assignments.
By Wednesday, Misty is tired of him going places without her, so they find little places to take small visits to. Her favorites are parks, conservatories, and the zoo. Draco, on the other hand, prefers to get coffee and mule about. Sometimes they’ll go to museums and Draco will explain the muggle objects he understands, sometimes they just walk around and take in the sights and smells. Misty’s been bugging him about seeing a movie for the past week, but Draco’s more inclined to take her to a play first.
All in a day's work, he really was having fun.
Dumbledore keeps him in the hospital wing for three whole days before he breaks, apparently social contact really is all that important after his hellish summer. He practically begs to see the headmaster early Thursday morning, and with all the whining he’d been doing, Madam Pomfrey is more than happy to take him there.
Even Draco can’t contain his snickers, which doesn’t help the murderous face Snape gives all three of them. Luckily Lupin isn’t done.
“That’s what
“A dueling club?” Draco gasps, “With
“I was going to talk you into clubbing with me, actually.”
“Sorry, force of habit.”
“Which,” Blaise follows suit, leaning back and wrapping the blanket tighter around his shoulders, “means we’re also in deep now.”
Harry blinks himself into focus. Sure enough, Ron and Blaise are still at it, and he can hear Pansy and Hemione giggling from their own shared couch. “It’s just...it’s very warm here, isn’t it? In your chest, I mean. It’s...it’s happy. And good.”
Fred and George say nothing, so Ginny rolls her eyes and steps forward, “He went to help the Ministry.”
They leave Obsidian with one of the new ‘cards’ that’s basically like having all his money in one tiny rectangle, and Draco starts feeling something like hope again.
“Yes, but with Black escaping it’s really fine-”
Saturdays are the days he doesn’t have to do anything. He stays in bed as long as he wants to, gets up to wash his face, pads downstairs for brunch, reads a little bit, tinkers with a few things here and there, pittles around on his computer, and always ends up reading himself to sleep.
“I do not! And for the record,
“Mister Draco? You is being shirtless-” Misty gasps.
“You’re right, you two are just disgusting.”
He nears her area, “Of course, but might I ask what this is about?”
The whole thing had made him sick, but even worse is the fact that his ‘friends’ still aren’t laughing. He lightly calls them out on it, whoever they are, they obviously had never been around Crabbe and Goyal for longer than ten minutes.
would’ve helped without question. He quickly picks her up so she won’t get close to their prisoner.
Harry, after finding out about his parent's grades: I retract my statement, I will to better.
The two tumbled to the floor, bags spilling all over and Marlin help him he was going to kill whatever asshole got in his way. As soon as he got through collecting his belongings he was going to-
is always crystal clean, though it’s never centered correctly. His bed is always made, but the pillows are also rumpled enough to make him want to crawl back in it. His bookshelf has never known dust, but the books are slanted in some places, even with bookends to make room for the Quidditch trophies Sirius had gotten a hold of for him.
“Leave me out of your letters, please. I can’t have her knowing anything, it could put her in danger.”
“I think it’s not a possibility we should rule out.”
So yeah, Fleur needs a confidence boost, and a change in attitude.
“Yes, Draco. The last time it was open, Riddle had done it himself. A muggle was killed then, it almost shut down the school. They were difficult times, and if it is opened again...I fear the worst, for both Mr.Potter and ourselves. Not even I know the beast Salazar Slytherin has bread down there…”
“Surely you know family doesn’t always mean blood. Besides, did you really expect me to walk into the lion’s den outnumbered?”

His parents’ room is furthest down on the West Wing because it’s the biggest and his mother loves the view.
Madam Hooch blows her whistle once more and they’re airborne, his eyes desperately searching. Naturally, because he is also stupid, he finds himself drawn to the other Seeker turning with just enough time for the Bludger to miss his head.
They both freeze, looking at her with wide eyes but her smile only widens. Not in the threatening way they’re both so used to, just warm and happy.
“You need to leave-”

“What’s the Total Control curse?” He pauses to ask.
“If you would
“It’s safe.” Is all she says, and then Draco peeks his head in the room, as if making sure no funny business is happening. When he spots them a smile breaks out onto his face.
Also, I'm not going to start another fic until I finish this series but boy oh boy have i had a thought. That being said, I still have a lot planned for this series. Like I'm talking future jobs, relationships, I literally have a one-shot planned for Theo's relationship and I- I need to write quicker, basically. Anyways, I hope you all enjoyed!
“Harry-” Lupin starts, but Harry isn’t hearing it.
“Is that why you called me Weasley for the longest time?”
But that doesn’t stop Draco from pushing the rest his way, making a dent in his own pile.
Ah; so it’s Hagrid who’s carrying him. He would be mortified if he wasn’t so thankful to have something warm keeping him from losing his grip on reality.
“Your mothers,” Sisily gulps, “All three of them.”
“Actually I can-”
Draco looks into big black eyes, his arm still out stretched. He jolts a little when Misty takes his hand.
Footsteps rush up the stairs, Harry barely has enough time to throw the invisibility cloak over himself before Dumbledore is in the room, frowning at the sight of Malfoy. “This is not how I hoped to find you upon my return,” The headmaster looks so sad, stricken with something Harry thinks he feels too.
Or if he’d taken a hot bath, got round to scrubbing the dirt out of his hair, or even actually scrubbed his teeth instead of spelling them clean.
“You’re really quite stunning up close,” he whispers, “although for a moment you really did scare me. You would never hurt Potter though, would you? I agree that he’s tempting to hex but Merlin having him hurt is a headache for everyone.”
started to look a little green.
“What,” Theo, surprisingly, has the worst glare of the three, “With Harry waking up screaming, spouting about seeing Riddle and someone
“Granger?” He calls, feet carrying him quicker. No one is in the castle because of the game, but he checks anyways, looking around before shaking her shoulders. “Granger?!” Petrified just like the others.
“Misty is being sorry, sir. The house is empty now, and Misty could only find one cup, and the water doesn’t work anymore so Misty be having to go to the well.”
A flower shop that’s completely intact, Draco can see a worker in an apron watering a baby wiggentree. Next to it is a bakery, and next to that a small green wand shop. Draco takes in the sights, the happy blue apothecary, the yellow tea shop, the people in the street chatting happily, not giving a damn about him.
Draco has every intention of finishing the assignment and studying for the quickly approaching finals, a good and normal thing for a student to want. Naturally, it doesn’t happen.
“We found anxiety and pain-relieving potions under your bed last year, and now there’s blood replenishing ones there too.”
“No,” Lucius shakes his head. “It’s best that you both come with me. The kids are tired, it’s best that they head to bed.” He turns with a strangely kind look on his face. Well, as kind as Lucius Malfoy can look. “It’s been a rough night, things will be better in the morning.”
“I was under the impression that you despise Mr.Potter.”
Blaise just brushes a hand through his hair, “Now, love, there’s no way to tell-”
“Theo,” He says, gently pulling away, “Would...would you like to come back to mine? Catch up a bit?”
Draco ignores the fact that he hasn’t been able to feel anything since Snape brought him back from the pensive. He flat out refuses to acknowledge that he’s at a breaking point because if he does that…
what he needs to loosen him up!”
“Hi! Sorry, I know it’s been a while and I probably have a lot to explain, but I need a snake and your help.“
“Great! Now that that’s solved, someone tell me when we’re doing presents, because I’m going to need the entire Christmas day to get ready, and I refuse to do it after. I was thinking the twenty-fourth? Possibly the twenty-third?”
Blaise reaches out to place a hand on his shoulder, warm against his back and very comforting. “If you can’t sleep, stay here with us. We can crack open the new series my dad got me, get out the snacks, make a night of it. Just please,” his sad smile rivals Dumbledore’s knowing looks, “Stay, here, with us. Where it’s safe.”
The elf, Winky, turns to them with wide eyes, “There be bad wizards about Mr. Potter! Winky is scared! Winky doesn’t like these wizards!” and then, before anyone can do anything, she’s gone.
Remus.”
She’s beautiful, Asklepios’s wife. Long hair, dressed in the same toga, but her wand tucked between folds and disguised as an olive branch. Medusa even more so, young, running around with snakes hanging off her hair and shoulders.
The Basilisk snorts, Harry didn’t know snakes could do that.
Sirius doesn’t even bother glaring, he just hugs Harry again. “Who did this? Are you okay? Was it those Muggles? I know I can’t kill them for a bit but I can find a way to-”
“Misty be overstepping boundaries today, Mister Draco, and she is being sorry but the boundaries needed to be overstepped. Misty is selfish, and Misty likes having Mister Draco here, so if Mister Draco chooses the floors and helps the house, it’s like he’s choosing and helping Misty too.”
“Planning on stealing Draco away for tomorrow?”
He looks up to see two pairs of eyes looking at him, and he takes a deep breath. “The diary, sir...this summer my father, I mean, he found this diary and went on about it for weeks. He said it belonged to some Tom Riddle person, but I didn’t know who it was, I thought it was just dark magic and-”
His father backs down at that and dinner is served, complete with tea they asked for and Lucius attempting to act like nothing had been going on. Draco ignores him completely, asking his mother about Paris, her travels, and breaking into the presents she’d brought.
Again.
Harry shoots him a look, but his smile is starting to return. “Act all you like, I know you have a big heart under all those scary gazes.”
Misty beams at him.
you’re not allowed looking like this!
“You didn’t put a spell on her, did you?”
“I trust them with my life.” Draco lets the words hang between them for a moment before continuing. “You know they’re contracted to me with a blood binding spell of all things. They wouldn’t be able to talk about anything even if they wanted to, but seeing that their loyalty lies with me I doubt they
After all, if Harry Potter isn’t at school this year, that's one less thing for Draco to worry about while trying to keep all the dirty muggleborns from being killed. Would he normally care? No. But this time, if they were to die, if even one of them perished, it might be enough for another Dark Lord to rise. Call him sane, but Draco knows better than to let that happen. A marvelous plan, really, get someone to keep Potter away from Hogwarts, and the rest would be easier without him sticking his stupid scar-face where it doesn’t belong.
“No!” Thank everything he doesn’t sound like a dying toad now, “Dumbledore will have questions and I frankly don’t have answers at the moment.” Draco groans, “He’ll probably rummage through my memories, dammit...Wait a minute!” he turns a sharp gaze on the scruffy boy in front of him, “Why the hell did he leave
She’ll pull his hair for this, but he doesn’t mind, “Flint.”
and more
“No, no, no, love, you can’t have any of that. I know you ate today, I saw it at breakfast.”
The headmaster does something he hasn’t done in a very, very long time. He looks away, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes, almost like he also doesn’t understand...or maybe…
would he be in charge of it?!”
“Ron, you go gather the rest of the ingredients, I’ll deal with Malfoy.”
Blaise stays close enough for Draco to lean against his shoulder. Pansy absolutely refuses to release her death grip on his hand. He thanks them a million times over for the support when he finally looks to the bed next to his where Wealsey is lying. Hermione sits beside him, eyes bloodshot and clearly worried, Harry stands with his eyes narrowed at Draco. He racks his head for a reason why his friend would be glaring. All he’s doing is stealing comfort from Blaise, or did he say something weird while he was sleeping? Oh, Merlin, what did he do? And for that matter what happened between-
Draco blinks, staring hard at the counter as the man swipes his card.
“To be frank,” Dumbledore replies in a steely voice, “I told Miss Granger because she is more capable than the both of you combined. Mr. Weasley was clued in because it is unfair to have only two-thirds of a team know, and you are aware how the three of them are very much a team. If they know, they are more likely to be honest with you, did you not come to me last year and complain that it would be easier to keep them out of trouble if you knew the trouble they would get into beforehand?”
This Christmas is unlike any other.
It all passes so quickly they nearly forget about Buckbeak until Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle, round a corner and see Harry talking to Minster Fudge. Given how pale his scarred friend looks, Draco doesn’t think they’re discussing the weather. He feels sick.
She smirks at him,
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?! I’ll have your head for this! Get your hands off me what the
“Scotland. There’s a semi-abandoned town up there, between Skirtza and the Bay of Sannick, it was left during the war, the Abbot family used to live up there, but when Hannah died everyone fled. The muggle towns aren’t too far, so you’ll be able to get food. It’s still under English Wizarding jurisdiction, so they won’t be able to hurt you for it. I’ll meet you there in a week, see if I can use my sway to be your single probation officer. Do you have your wand?”
They don’t take well to anything related to fire after the whole Dragon Incident.
Hermione’s eyes widen at Dumbledore’s retreating back so at least one of them understood his bullshit.
he came here to find death, what in the ever loving fuck is he thinking-
I just needed to make sure you couldn’t lie to me.”
The Dementors are going to kiss Potter.
You won’t hit on Luna, would you?” Blaise shakes his head. “Then don’t hit on Fleur. Just, in general, no hitting on my relatives. It’s weird.”
“A request, though one might find it a bit imposing now.” Dumbledore frowns, “I originally requested to speak with you about your house.”
“Nothing like ‘Mione and Pans together, though.”
Harry sputters at him, “Look! There is nothing going on between me and that- that- that scumbag! I was just happy to see his father in pain is all! Now are we going to the gift shop or not?” He pushes past the other boy, not knowing where he’s going so thankfully Cedric does take the lead again and before he knows it he’s looking at tons of wild stuff, Ron and Hermione snickering over miniature flying Firebolts.
Dumbledore had also told him that those with Runespoors had unbreakable mental strength, able to withstand so much before breaking. That would explain how he had survived so long in his father’s house. Merlin, why must everything in his life be so fucking complicated?
“I’m sorry,” Draco slurs, “You’ve caught me at a rather bad time, what were we talking about again?”
“A were-”
“The problem with myths, Severus, is that there are often truths in them. And unfortunately for all of us, the Chamber is about as much a myth as the night sky.”
in his wretched nothingness. As soon as the bag is zipped, Draco grabs his wand and aparates to the front gates.
“So, what brings you back?” Sirius asks, eyeing Draco just to make
He blinks once, and finds himself no longer at the threshold of a ruined living room, but looking out at the ocean through a broken bay window. From here he can feel the breeze, it seeps into the house from the window in front of them, one that’s beginning to fall off and leave holes in the side of the wall, one with broken glass, one with him and a little elf staring out of it.
something about that
Nothing happens, so he waits, wand drawn and ready to strike. And then, to his utter astonishment, he hears a weirdly familiar sign and Harry Potter is appearing out of quite literal thin air.
“Listen, Draco. Don’t let what they said get to you, alright? We all know you’re a good flyer, now we’ve just got to prove you’re more than money too.”
Honestly, how does Blaise expect him to behave after a statement like that. “We’re Slytherins. We don’t do things for other people’s benefits.”
“You throw yourself in the way of danger at any given chance! You’re had more close calls than anyone else in this room, and as far as I’m concerned it’s not your job to save someone just because their parents died! Do you not understand that people would miss you if you died? That seeing you hurt makes them upset? Do you care about anyone? Or is keeping your friends in a constant state of panic a Malfoy thing too?”
“Well, they don’t happen often, and this is a little weird, so hear me out.” Godric, they really don’t have to look like the sky is falling. “In first year I kept having dreams about Professor Quil and then Riddle was in the back of his head. In second year I kept having dreams about snakes and someone dying and then Riddle was trying to kill children, and I got a break fourth year, but in fifth year they were awful too. I had a dream about some old groundskeeper dying, and about that Barty Crouch guy working with Riddle, and then
Most of his friends have left, but some people practically live here it feels like, and

Ron looks at him like he’s lost it.
Sirius holds up his drink like he’s going to take a sip, but puts it back down instead. “Right.
to say his name without deep hatred. Harry recovers first.
“Look at you,” Blaise whispers, “You’re shaking like you’ve just woken up from a nightmare...we can’t sit by and watch anymore. We’re your friends and we won’t let you lie to us.”
“I do
Everything would be fine, except Pansy and Blaise have no training, and his mother is deceivingly good at brewing.
“Guys…” Blaise draws, “The point of the story, if you please.”
"Well if you insist..."
draco, admiring harry on a broom:  :)
Lucius’s voice echoes in the dinner hall, loud and unwelcome. Draco gulps, they’re playing a game tonight. “He has,” Draco begins carefully, “Strangely, some are convinced the wound did not come from the Hippogriff.”
Great. Now he just has to explain to his friends how they’re going to be healing a giant snake that tried to kill them.
Putting potions in my hot chocolate is sacrilegious!”
Ginny shakes her head, “I bullied Neville into taking me so I could dance with Luna when he gets tired.”
Potter completely ignores him. “Is that where you were this morning? No, because Hagrid didn’t get back until lunch! Me, Ron, and ‘Mione were going to go visit him after dinner, but you went after lunch didn’t you?! That’s why you stormed off in a huff-”
Hermione arrives first the following morning. She barely tells Remus and Sirius ‘hello’ before she’s hugging him and ranting about child abuse laws that the ministry doesn’t bother with and how she ought to have the Dursleys thrown in muggle prison because she knows those laws too. Her onslaught is stopped only by the arrival of the Weasleys because if Ron gets to visit then everyone else does.
Although ‘worry’ is probably the wrong word, given that Potter, without a doubt, had one of the Dark Lord’s trained killers after him.
Hermione looks like she could strangle him, “It’s a curse that gives the caster total control over a person’s mind, simultaneously filling their minds with memories while the victim is forced to do their bidding. They don’t know anything that’s happening until after they’ve already committed the crime.”
and ten seconds later Harry’s broom in before them. “I can’t give it back to him myself, it’ll be too obvious that I borrowed it from him and I don’t want anyone to accuse us of cheating, so I figured I should give it to someone he trusts.”
He checks on Theo before he says ‘yes’, finding his supposed kidnapper for the evening thoroughly invested in a group of girls with brown hair and brown eyes. And then all he can say
Harry: :(
more appealing than dealing with the public.

Hello! I forgot to tell you all last chapter, but I do feel okay! My coworker got covid and very kindly spread it around to every last one of us. I'm pissed at her, but I basically did a speed run of covid where I felt like shit for three days and now I'm just waiting for my quarantine to end. I'm not a patient person and I have to give myself little projects so I don't go stir crazy, so I've basically been writing two wips, this one and another surprise one I'm not posting until I'm done, playing the sims, and getting to know my plants on a personal level.
He would snap at Harry that it’s

Blaise smirks at him, “So you
Draco shrugs, “”Mother is going to be in Paris the whole break, and father is busy with Ministry business. Plus, this means I can continue my private studies with Snape.”
to stop doing that! You’re gonna give us a heart attack!”
Harry extends a hand because he doesn’t know what else to do. Kreecher makes a token attempt to hide his amusement, bowing instead of shaking Harry’s hand.
Merlin damn the smile tugging as his lips. Footsteps he knows as Snape’s echo from the hallway. Draco closes his eyes, speaking quickly “Look, Potter. You still want to know the truth, right? I promise you, I will answer any question you have. But not here. Not now. When I told you we can’t be friends, I meant it. You have to hate me, and I have to hate you.”
Hermione rolls her eyes, “I love you, Harry, but you really are like a magnet for bad fortune.”
anyways! i'm about to post the first chapter of the next fic where a LOT is going to happen, including the cute scene that everyone knows is coming. leave me some comments and guesses about the story and i'll answer any questions. at the end of the next fic i'll let you guys in on a few secrets and to be honest there are two different places i want to take the plot and i'm trying to figure out how to make us touch both areas so wish me luck and thank you all so much for joining me in this fic :) I hope to see you in the next one
misses the blueberry muffins that grace Slytherin tables every weekend morning. Or her daily ten cups of coffee...
“Stop! Dobby quit it!” Malfoy yells, thankfully getting the elf to sit up right as he hands the sock back to its new owner. “You haven’t done anything wrong, there’s no need to punish yourself anymore. For anything. We’ll think of somewhere for you to go, where no one can hurt you and you can still serve those who please you.”
“Skipping lunch are we? Growing boys need to eat, you know that.”

“You didn’t get a letter until Christmas-”
He recognizes the voice as Dumbledore and almost sighs in relief. If anyone could help him now it would be the headmaster.
conspiring with his mother. “Do you know where he is?”
He can’t smell it between the two of them. Blaise’s sandalwood and Pansy’s jasmine take over his senses and he’s completely fine with that. But then he catches hints of sweat and the madness of it all sends him laughing straight into his friends.
Speaking of the killer…..
smiling during the war, sir! Not even when Master and Mistress were going out! He is making the people happy, sir! You must believe Misty!”
Harry would willingly face Riddle a thousand times if it meant never having to see that sight again.
Before Harry can say anything, Draco rips off his glasses, tosses them onto the bedside table, and grabs his jaw. “It’s not your fault.”
“You did.”
It’s been awhile since he got to be home, and he’s not complaining. He loves being able to see his friends, loves that his family is bigger and kind and welcoming even if some of them are a little scary. Honestly, if someone told ten year old him that one day he’d have everything he ever wanted he would’ve thought his aunt just found a new way to hurt him.
“The minister?! Why?”

“Harry!” the boy looks back at him and he can’t decide which possibility he likes less. Harry is either going to whisk him away to the hospital wing in front of the entire school or run after his godfather and get himself killed.
Rain has begun to fall again, right as a whistle is blown, someone had noticed the Bludger, someone was going to keep Potter safe, and right now it wouldn’t be him.
“His death isn’t your fault.” Goyle reminds him.
No one in their right mind argues with Dumbledore, not even Snape. Or Harry, for that matter, because a few hours later he finds himself sitting next to Malfoy’s bed, keeping watch and trying to talk the boy to sleep before the Headmaster comes back.
“I can handle mine just fine!” Draco protests.
Harry and Draco: Horny
“My little dragon….”
It would always be an option, but next time he would have to make sure it wasn’t the one he chose.
“I understand if you’re confused, after all there’s physical proof if you can call it that, but the matter of fact is that Winky clearly did no wrong, as you obviously did not tell her ‘no wands’ for her hands are still here.”

For the first ten years of my life I was forced to live in a small cramped space, I was bullied and starved and hurt by the only people I had the chance to interact with. She had friends, and they were taken from her just like my parents, Sirius, and Remus were taken from me. Riddle did the same thing to her that my aunt and uncle did to me. And even though she thought he was her friend, all he did was force her into a world full of death and misery against her will, just like me! She doesn’t deserve to be hated and- and fucking

Lupin shoots them both a glare, “Tonight. I was in my office, looking over the Marauder's Map-”
“Yes,” Pansy nodded. “You need this, and frankly I’m looking forward to actually sleeping today.”
Harry marvels at it for a minute, tracing the path of the snitch, admiring his stupid cat bookends that he’d gotten because they reminded him of LuLu, grinning at the photos from Pansy that have started collecting on his wall, the books that Hermione gave him, the poster of Quidditch gear that he and Ron laughed at because they were all mislabeled, his self writing quills from Blaise, and the necklace that Draco gave him last Christmas. He plops down on the bed that Sirius and Remus apparently made for him, rolls around on it until he spots the lamp that Narcissa bought for him because he liked the deep purple shade.
Whatever furniture that was left has been eaten through, covered in dust, or broken beyond repair. There’s not much of it, a broken, singed couch by a fireplace, a table that’s missing a few legs, tattered pillows, memories of a staircase with several missing steps, doors blown off their hinges, all the dust in the near empty room makes him sneeze.

Theo chokes on his own laughter, “I’m pretty sure you are dead and I’m just hallucinating. Maybe Daphne drugged me when I wasn’t looking.”

Her hand is firm in his, grounding and kind. It’s ripped away from him before either of them can refuse to let go.

Harry barely makes it in the door before the bell rings, and he completely misses how Fleur stares after him with surprised eyes and a small smile.
“Hippogriffs! Beauties aren’t they?”
Umbridge, being a bitch:
“You’re too kind….I don’t think I’d have that type of self control.”
Pansy falls asleep first, midway through the first movie. She curls into the armrest of the forest green velvet, Draco drapes a blanket over her. Blaise is next, head lolling back and cinnamon crisps forgotten on his lap, Draco removes the bag so it doesn’t make a mess. Once he’s sure neither of them will hear it he speaks.
“Yeah, I do, mate.”
At least this irritation isn’t Potter produced. Somehow it’s worse.
Whatever. Maybe he can get Harry to talk to her and find out what the deal is.
“No. It’s
Like always, Dumbledore was right. Harry deserved happiness, but there was no point getting the boy’s hopes up.
He starts by vanishing everything.
He really needs Potter to turn on him and say something rude. To keep up the banter so Draco knows he’s actually okay enough to function normally, but instead it’s Weasley who glares at him. Potter actually relaxes a bit to Draco’s utter confusion.
The night eventually comes to a close. Draco kisses his cousins on their foreheads, promising to see Fleur tomorrow, and then walks Luna back to the castle. He’s half tempted to get Winky to see if Harry is free, which reminds him that he really needs a way for them to communicate freely, which reminds him of his project. And because he has so much to do tomorrow and the rest of the week, Draco decides to go straight to bed.
His laughing friends are met with a very loud, very dramatic, groan.
“Harry!” Draco grabs his face. “Harry we need to go! It’s nearly eight!”
utensils. Also a few unmoving paintings of various, artistically painted, and
“All for the good of the cause, isn’t it? Won’t you humor me for a bit?”
Sirius shoots him a smile, “Do you think a new broom would make him a little more likely to forgive me?”
Blaise and Theo finally got together!!!! I'm super excited about next week's chapter and the week after that because I'm posting the first chapter of my other fic on the first monday of march!!!! Literally frothing at the mouth to post it, but patience or whatever.
Please don’t make me stay here.”
Potter makes some sort of sound between a crazed laugh and a shocked gasp. “You are, aren’t you? Why else would you be here, unless you came to finish the job yourself. That would ruin last year’s work though, wouldn’t it? You don’t make any sense! One second you’re taunting me with my

hated secrets. Which is why he is where he is now.
Flitwick, scared but equally as angry with his ravens: your real name is Severus??
“An accident?” Blaise whispers, pulling him closer, “Darling, it looks like you were beaten…”
“I thought keeping secrets was bad, professor. You see what it did for Padfoot and the headmaster.”
Dumbledore would probably disagree, “It matters not, the boy is attached, it wouldn’t be kind to remove him from a stable environment-”
Carla huffs out a little laugh, “Write your damn check, Draco.”
His friends are all good people, and look at the mess that gets them into.

And you’ll realize this tomorrow when Harry ends up being dinner for dragons.”
The house elf smiles gratefully at the woman who sits at the counter-top island and beacons Draco to join her.
“Fleur! Look at you! You look amazing!”
Kingsley sighs. “I didn’t tell you about this place so you could wither away here. You’re
“Thrice removed, then. I know you’ve always been friendly with Luna,” She settles in next to Blaise, pulling Draco and Millie down with her, “The Rosier Family, though they stopped being big after the whole mess with Grindelwald-”
“What would losing one friend matter?”
“He’s fine, darlings. Recovering like death was never even an option in the first place, cocky bastard.”
“I jump!”
The room supplies nearly everything except food and a clock, so when their stomachs do finally start rumbling they make a real, brain powered, decision to leave. According to the grand clock in the common room, they were right on time for lunch.
She giggles, her nervous giggle that always means angry thrashing for him if he steps a toe out of line, “I’m sorry, sir, but I haven’t the faintest clue-”
Narcissa kisses his cheek before she leaves, and then his friends are on him.
Snape slumps in his chair, waving his hand over his cup and leaving the tea steaming once more. “Explain. Now.”
“What do you think about then?”
“I’ll go with you.” Harry offers.
Nagini calmly replies.
“Yes.”
He shoots her a smile, “I’m a pureblood, what’s the worst it could do to me? Really, a peabrain like Potter is more of a threat.”
“It’s been a while since you’ve seen Fawkes, hasn’t it? Plus I do believe he has news on Buckbeak.”
“Master Blaise and Misses Pansy are here for Master Draco.” Sisily pops in to tell them. Draco runs out to the living room, not caring at all that he’s still in his pajamas.
“You’ve got a new Seeker? Where?”
He’s right in the middle of mincing garlic when there’s a knock at the front door.
Draco graces him with a smile, a small crass gesture to his father’s way of politics. Ruling with an iron fist is tacky to say the least. Sliver went so much better with his aesthetic, besides, Draco’s always seen better results in loyalty if the person isn’t, say, an abusive asshole governed by the mistakes of his past that just so happened to lead him to quite literally selling his soul. Not to be specific, of course.
Draco lights up like a tree, “Buckbeak!” Three seconds later he deflates, “I fucking told him not to pull something like this! He nearly died the first time by
Harry groans, because potions typically taste like ass, but he and Draco march down the stairs anyways.
“Headmaster Dumbledore is….”
Helga does not give a single shit. She flies against her chains, reaching the top of the stadium and then Harry hears a distinct loud snapping noise and whimpers.
“Did you not faint your first time?”
Whoever it is will either force him out, sit with him like Misty, or (if he’s lucky) kill him on the spot.
Harry grins, latching on to the new topic because if he can’t impress his friends with his plan, he can at least amaze them with Geia.
“Always.”

get killed.
Logically, no. Hell, if Blaise and Pansy left him and started treating Ron like he was the best thing since Warming Charms, he would probably go after the red-headed bastard himself. But logic and Dumbledore were rarely friends.
Fleur reaches over the table to poke him, “Who are you going with?”
Speaking of Snape, it’s no surprise to find that he’s Longbottom’s worst fear, but the image of the man in god-awful clothing, complete with handbag and an outrageously big hat sends him and the rest of the class to tears. They line up to take turns and one by one he sees the funniest things he never dreamt of, spiders on roller skates, snakes turning into clowns, a banshee turning into a rat, and then it hits him right as Potter steps up for his turn.
“Yes you are.” Fleur says. She’s dressed slightly different, her ‘armor’ a pale blue and white body suit that hugs in all the right places. The Beauxbatons crest rests right above her heart. She looks every bit a warrior, but Harry’s suit just looks cheap.
Draco sits up and throws open his eyes only to see a lot of weird blurs and fall back within three seconds. A few blinks later and Pansy’s furious face comes into view. The hand playing with his hair is gone. Just like his friend’s patience.
A way to lay blame elsewhere. A way into the school. A way to ensure the Dark Lord’s favor is won.
“Yes, but what does it
Potter rolls his eyes, “When
“Draco,” Blaise starts, “What do you-”
Blaise raises an eyebrow at him and fuck, he really did just say that in front of at least five people, not to mention the Great Hall is filled with listening ears and prying eyes. Draco quickly amends.
“Mum!” Draco sighs, arm around Hermione’s shoulder. “You make it sound like a publicity stunt. And it is, of course, but it’s more of a declaration of war.”
“No-”
Draco’s nearing his frustration peak. The top of his left eyebrow is going to start twitching any second now, and he still doesn’t know if Nott’s being serious or trying to get him to admit that he
Fuck, he really could never catch a break.
Harry does end up warning him about the grosser things the further they get into the pipes. Partly because he knows if Draco sees a giant snake

“And showered, I adore you but you stink, love.”
They shake with quiet laughter, shoving shoulders and then Blaise freezes.
—————
Harry snorts. “Will I ever be fashionable?”
He tears after the creature, shouting his name while Harry scrambles to his feet to follow Hermione who’s running after her mangled little lion and since all his friends are doing it, Draco thinks
“You could,” Draco admits, “But then we wouldn’t be here right now, would we?”
Okay?

Howie’s is one of them, because the man is too honest for his own good and it’s annoyingly endearing. June’s shop, but only because he’s been the one teaching her.

Griphook frowns, meaning he’s really giving Draco a death glare.

Draco takes a long hard look at his face; the bags, the sad eyes, the hopeful smile. And then he leans a little closer and tells Harry about his mother. He talks about how when he was little she tried to teach him to bake cakes and the house elves went mental over it. He tells Harry about their favorite parts of the garden, how she’d been there for every broom ride. His father comes up, naturally, but it’s his real father. The one that taught him to swim and warm hot cocoa so they didn’t have to move from watching the snow fall. The same man who spelled bubbles to tickle and kiss him when he scraped his knee. Lucius Malfoy, the man who once danced with his mother while he played the piano and the house elves hung flowers in the ballroom.
He’s a pureblood, all purebloods have their ancestors memorized by the age of ten. He knows the Malfoy line started an extremely long time ago, he knows that a Roman famous person is involved at some point, and recently he knows that his father and his grandfather had trouble connecting to the family magic.
Draco does overhear her mumbling about classes he knows are at the same time and briefly wonders how she does it, but given her current state he’s a little too cowardly to ask.
let's get into it real quick,
A wicked smile comes over Pansy’s face. She snatches Harry’s robes, marches up to Cedric and demands his too. There’s a bit of an awkward pause and then Cedric disappears behind the curtain again. Fleur doesn’t seem confused in the least, which is strange because Krum definitely thinks he’s a few screws loose.
Sirius is across the room before Draco can blink. Fist in Snape’s robes, hand rearing back to strike. Not a thought crosses his mind before he’s freezing the man in place and throwing him back.
“I have a dark arts wound?”
Harry: for fuck's sake.
“She’s just happy to have someone there for her!” Hermione tries, face redder than Mrs. Weasley’s was when she was yelling at the twins.
Draco’s first instinct is to nod, so he does, but that doesn't seem to make the elf happy.
“What? We couldn’t write our names, could we?”
Going over to Severus’s house, stirring in one of his godfather’s many cauldrons, collecting samples and testing new potions behind his parents’ back. Late nights bent over steam, Severus pulling him back and complaining about him not being careful. Falling asleep watching Severus work, smiling at him on the first day of potion’s class, sneaking his way into the labs when he was having trouble with something, only for Severus to find him, sigh, and then assist in whatever Draco decided to brew.
for months now and B-Blaise-”
“I do
The idiot rolls his eyes and before he can properly hex him, Draco is being shoved into the classroom on his left. And yes, he does throw a fit about it.
A few hexes fly past them, Draco pulls Harry behind him so he’s safe and then a familiar voice calls out and he’s never been more happy to hear a Weasley in his life.
“Because then they would want to know where the wound came from.”
A sinking feeling overcomes the brief relief that had floated through Draco, if his father was scheming, it meant the headache from first year would pale in comparison. “And how shall we do that?”
Blaise refuses to step foot in a library with him unless it’s finals season or he has someone with him. Apparently he can only take so much of Study Draco, which is fair.
She goes on to tell him that since they’ve promised to do so many things ‘tomorrow’ that a list is necessary so they don’t forget, which means she will most definitely be holding Draco to every single promise and Draco kinda wishes he’d pitched himself off the cliff on his first day in Scotland.
“Yes. He said he wouldn’t

When he gets back, Misty is still sat in the living room, so Draco goes straight to the kitchen and takes out his wand, trying desperately to remember those spells he made the houseleves teach him when he was sixteen and trying to figure out how hard running from the Dark Lord would be.
He takes one step further into the living room and Kreecher pops in.
He gets a forest green cabinet and counter set, with copper handles, white marble tops, and a hidden trashcan that pulls out and vanishes whatever’s thrown into it. He gets the island set to go with it, a beautiful copper sink with flower detailing. The shopkeeper, Howie, talks him into getting a copper-stained fridge that has preserving charms in it, will make a note on any paper put on the outside when something needs to be restocked, and has a freezer component that freezes things to a perfect temperature, no matter if it’s ice cream or meet. The stove that Howie talks him into is
y'all know god, Narcissa Malfoy.
“I already do. Don’t give me that look, you make it too easy!”
All four of the champions were forced to the hospital wing after the match, shoved into the emergency wing and told to lie down. Since the hostages had been in cold waters for Godric knows how long, they were her first priority.
“What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at Gringotts?”
“Yes the news, Sirius and Remus will be joining us for dinner.”
“Look, all I’m saying is that if we could, I’m pretty sure Old Witty Riddy would buy the entire stock, which means he’d have no bribe money left, and he’d be distracted smelling them all day so we could probably take him by surprise.”
Check and mate. The exact argument that’s been going through Draco’s own head for at least almost a year now. Constant back and forth between it not being safe, because Potter didn’t know, and his father would kill him if he was friends with the boy. But, being honest with himself, Potter
He doesn’t stop Draco from stepping out.
“What’s a Fleur?”
“Great! I’ll see you in a few minutes.” Lupin replies, disappearing into his office. He doesn’t reemerge until the class is all seated and out of some act of good, Blaise doesn’t do anything but stand beside him and squeeze his hand lightly, an apology and an understanding wrapped into one. Even though he doesn’t want to, his eyes follow Potter when he walks in, and he can’t help but wonder what it would be like if they stood together too.
Draco clears his throat. “If you think that’s cool, come with me.”
Thursday, like the rest of the week, is hell. Bright and cold and early, Draco sits his Ancient Runes exam, and then spends the rest of his day studying for Arithmancy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Or, really, Cedric finds
The anger is still there and making him want to do something stupid, like maybe punch the old geezer, or at least knock steaming tea on the freshly cleaned carpet, but he does have a point. Harry Potter had spent two years hating his guts, and it only took roughly thirty minutes and a violent exchange to change his mind. It would no doubt take roughly five minutes for him to become attached to his god-father, and he would raise hell at the thought of him being in prison. Clearly, Dumbledore had some plan to keep that from happening, but Draco still left the office annoyed and bothered. LuLu trotted along beside him, as if sensing that he wanted to be alone but also knew it wasn’t the wisest decision for him to be by himself. Who knows what trouble he would get into with his current mood.
“You see, professor, it’s just been a peculiar week, is all. I see floating heads all the time, by Merlin we have far too many ghosts who enjoy pranking first years with ‘floating heads’ so it's really no big deal and I know I’m about to sound mad because we both know he’s supposed to be in the school but he really never does do what he’s supposed to, so who’s to say if I have gone ‘round the bin or not-”
“Sure.” Harry mumbles back, but then Geia hisses something from the pool and his eyes open. “OH wait. Oh-” Red flourishes on his cheeks and here Draco was thinking his eyes couldn’t get any greener. “Hello, um, good morning, I guess.”
She’s already pulling him to the side, away from prying eyes and listening ears. “What is it? You will be late for class if you do not hurry.”
and when he saw him hurt….Harry shakes his head, telling them about the letters between him and Sirius this past summer and how the man has become a weirdly important part of his life and then Hermione makes a sound and waves her wand, a few letter of her own appearing in her hand.
Sirius laughs in spite of himself, “Did she trick you with Veritaserum too?”
“And when was that?”
The two Slytherin girls blink. Then they finally notice the others sitting around them, Blaise and Theo trying to out-bore each other, Draco and Fleur completely lost to the situation, and Luna, looking deeply into her raspberry cake like it holds the world’s secrets. Millie coughs.
“He didn’t hurt you, did he?”
Weasley gasps behind him, and then he says probably the strangest thing a person can say when four friends are mourning the loss of something pure.
“Anyone?” Blaise and Draco ask at the same time. He looks at them like they’re insane, which only encourages them further.
Not the worst thing, the tea, but it’s no mint. Certainly no chamomile. Even so, the three drink and make small talk until Lupin tells them both that it’s getting late and that they could probably use a good night’s sleep. Draco can’t agree more, but damn him if Potter doesn't follow him so he can’t go to the Astronomy tower and meet his friends immediately, they make it halfway to the dungeons before he snaps.
Helga halts, her wings blowing air into his hair, but Harry’s a little busy bowing to care.
“I know, I know, he’ll hex me won’t he?”
Hermione, happy about a woman losing her job:
But the dungeons were another story.
“Oh, what is there to question?! I thought it was all fairly obvious? Lucius has been under mind control his whole time, yes he’s been abusing Draco you can put your hand down Gin, but she won’t go into details so I’m unsure of how badly he’s been affected. The
She says,
They both gulp. Good. Maybe now they won’t go poking their heads where they don’t belong. Just for good measure, and partly because he was still trying to piss them off, he adds “I hope it’s Granger.”
“We could use a pensive-”
Blaise, bless him, pats his back until his air pipes are no longer blocked by steamed broccoli, and even makes an effort to remain close when he opens the letter.
He had closed his eyes and imagined it, him and his mother laughing in the manor, before all this mess, just the two of them talking about some shopping trip. He thought about Potter being alive and almost grinning at him in the hospital wing. He thought about Pansy and Blaise, curled up on either side of him and talking about classes while a fire cackles in front of them.  Draco really wasn’t sure which memory caused the surge of happiness powerful enough for a bright light to shoot out of his wand. He was so happy he finally managed to produce something he completely forgot to figure out what it was, until three heads of the same snake stared at him.
hurt me!” Draco retorts before he can stop himself, his father calmly puts down his fork and knife.
“Ten thousand gallons.”
“Birthday, then?”
So no, Harry would never complain about the amount of love he’s finally been allowed to have.
In all honesty, rebuilding a house isn’t that drastic in retrospect to what his friends have been off doing. In a way it suits them. Draco, once the head of the pack, the one they all listened to and followed, being left in the dust by his magnificent friends.
The only person that might come close to that is June. So, Draco swivels in his chair, fully prepared to go deal with some horrifying potion mishap, and then freezes on the spot.
Tries not to remember how annoyed Blaise got when the wards dropped. How Pansy laughed in their faces. How they both squealed when Draco
But, apart from all the ways magical people can be forced into marriage, Draco does note some interesting things. Binding a rude person to a room, binding a wand to return to a caster’s hand, and in the back, dogeared in the rudest way possible, is a section on house elf binding, with little notes in the margins.
St. Muggos to get them going.
“I is not doing magic with it sir!” Winky cries, “I just be picking it up….but I do not be knowing how to conjure the Dark Mark, sir! Winky wouldn’t dare!”
there’s a simple charm to make regular clothes tough.”
Blaise doesn’t answer, but he does step closer and trail his fingertips over the lines on Draco’s chest. Those hands don’t stop even when Draco starts to shiver and get goosebumps, and then he’s in Blaise’s arms against a soft silk shirt that badly hides the muscles underneath.
“Listen, lady.” The male voice turns rough, it’s also a lot closer, or Harry thinks it’s closer, he can’t really tell, “I don’t care what type of woman you are, but I do believe it’s in your best interest to keep your mouth shut.”
It wouldn’t be their last good time, Draco’s sure. Bad things would come their way, particularly his way, but they’d managed worse when they were younger and less prepared.
Sirius dissolves into laughter. Lupin blinks.
Harry shakes his head ‘no’, Ron, apparently over his animosity or lured by the cute noises the thing makes, joins him in petting her. Hermione doesn't like it one bit.
Malfoy turns to Dobby, “Get out of here. I’ll find Dumbledore and talk to him later, stay in the kitchens until I find you.” The elf looks like he wants to protest, but Malfoy shakes his head.
“Great, Ron, now they’ know about everyone. Remember when Draco specifically asked us to keep it a
Remus raises an eyebrow, but Harry’s not a huge fan of talking about childhood trauma with anyone that isn’t Ron and Hermione and he has his limits with them too.
Pansy actually laughs, “Honey, you being nice would be the end of the world.”
“Please don’t make out next to me. I’m begging you.”
Harry would beg to fucking differ.
Dumbledore enters sometime later, Pansy pulls on his arm and Blaise makes an effort with his free hand. They start to pull him back to the common room just in time for Dumbledore to take Potter and his crew away.
Nagini hisses again, but Harry is to gobsmacked to do anything about it. Draco shoves him forward, which seems to startle some life into him.
The two of them turn back towards the window at the exact time a car flies by. Heads whip back and forth, they blink at each other and then Pansy speaks and suddenly his headache is back full force.
“Remus! Don’t let that whiny bastard-”
“No you is not. The ocean can tell. You is coming here because you listened to the Magic, sir, and you is not yelling at Misty yet, so you can’t be being bad. Sit, sir, Misty will find tea.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------
” he hears Lockheart shout. Fills in the gaps of the instructions he’d missed, but he’s too busy laughing to care. It feels like someone is tickling him and it takes a few moments to figure out that he’d perfectly guessed the purpose of the spell. If Potter wanted to play dirty, he could get behind that.
All three of the adults freeze, Draco rubs his temple. “You do
“I’m wearing two rain coats and
“Should we sneak some back for Fawkes, Headmaster?”
“Explanation. Now.” The voice that comes from beside him is strained but Potter always gets the job down. Today is no different. Draco’s learned that Harry’s pretty easy going, but he doesn’t fuck around with his parents. Who could blame him? Especially the adults in the room.
But logic rots away in Azkaban.
“No I’m not.” Harry says before Hermione or worse, Ron, can tell him otherwise. “My goal here is to not die. I don’t want, or need to win. That’s your job.”
Both of his parents sit a little straighter, Narcissa actually sets her book down, which he wasn’t expecting.
“Yes. Second-hand accounts can only do so much, and it’s like…” Harry runs a hand through his hair. “Like the outside of a puzzle is there, but I can’t fill it in.”
As soon as he steps into the store he’s a little overwhelmed, but Salem purrs against his chest, keeping his heart steady.
They were there. More importantly, they were the ones who got his defense together.
Harry opens his mouth to offer some retort but Lupin’s laughter cuts him off. They turn to see their professor, or possibly just another friend now, bent over his desk laughing like it was going to split him in two.
tells him it’s only eleven thirty, the ocean won’t be at high tide until midnight, but Misty is nervous so he lugs himself off the floor and leads her to the cliff.
They all pull back just in time to see Hermione wiping her eyes, “You could’ve at least told us you were going to be a part of the trial, Ron. We were all worried sick.”
LuLu makes a few noble attempts to get him to stay, complete with blocking the door, or trying to block the door and too adorably small to do it.
“How the fuck are we supposed to do that?” Cedric seethes.
“Yes?”
. I’m not done, love.”
Harry, thoroughly disappointed that the stadium isn’t bigger, slides off her neck and into the nest. The eggs are almost his size, which means he can easily avoid them and find the little golden wannabe tucked in the middle. He grabs it and turns, holding it out so she can sniff it.
just got sucked by a Dementor
Draco rolls his eyes, going to grab Fawkes so Snape can look through books, but Fawkes refuses to leave the hat alone. Eventually he takes the stupid hat and gives it to the Phoenix, “Is this what you want? What could you possibly need with the hat-”
“I’m sorry, what?”
Why is he looking at himself? What is-
Draco glares at Blaise, but it doesn’t do much besides make his friends snicker and reduce him to a smiling mess. Pansy hooks her arm into his free one, “Think about it like this, it’s still Halloween….we still have time for a few last minute pranks.”
He tugs on his softest pair of pants, the grey slacks that Pansy made him in his final year at Hogwarts. The ones that feel like silk and look like the usual stuffy business shit he was forced to wear.
Pansy nods.
“Daphne? Greengrass? Why would she-”
All his happy thoughts disappear when he gets a good look at the upstairs landing.
Harry: my god I've fucking lost it
Sirius outright laughs at that.
She raises her eyebrow, “Did you listen to anything I said in the car two days ago?”
“Is also a
Then there is Harry.
“Where, then?! You keep saying that type of shit but the time is never right, is it?”
The Black side is a little more interesting, but that’s just because of his mother’s Veela grandmother that caused quite the scandal. If it weren’t for the fact that his grandmother is...well the way she is, she would’ve been disowned like her father. Fortunately, Blacks cared about image just as much as the Malfoys did and a reunited child who was stolen by a mad veela sounds better in the Daily Prophet than ‘Black Son Fucked by Veela, Heir to Black Fortune Now a Half-Breed?” Also, if he thinks about it, the disgrace was probably more on the fact that Veelas create light and the Black line is riddled with Shadow Magic. Oh well, either way it’s information he already knows so having to reread it all from family accounts is just boring.
“We be needing breakfast!”
Draco: this is illegal!
On pure instinct he goes straight for the second living room, where Narcissa typically takes her afternoon tea. Sure enough, she’s there, talking over some sort of design with Sicily that she nearly throws on the ground when she spots him.
Somehow, with luck even worse than his own, Ronald Weasley had managed to backfire his own spell, and now knelt on the field spitting up slugs. He couldn’t hold back his pearls of laughter even if he wanted to. After this, at least he wouldn’t be too upset about the car thing.
Draco nearly has a heart attack as he rushes to the front door.
“Ronald you are a menace, but so you’re aware,
Is he in trouble already? He just got here!
How can he not listen in when she’s talking about him?! He’s not supposed to exist!
He’s not surprised in the least to find Hermione outside with her arms piled high. There’s no one else in the hallway, but they don’t talk. Draco does, however, follow her back to the Gang’s Room.
Ron, Hermione, and Harry all gape at them, but it’s Hermione who asks, “You
Ron stays close to Harry’s side that Draco isn’t occupying, leaving Hermione, Pansy, and his mother to talk about whatever girls talk about. If he’s honest he can’t really follow what Blaise and Ron are talking about when Harry’s nearly vibrating next to him.
“So we’re just telling everyone that I’m a spy, are we?”
The masked figures that once plagued the hallways of his home, marching in a tight formation, carrying to people, no,
Draco, to Hermione: You amaze and terrify me
He’s not sure where he's going, or what direction he’s headed in, all he really knows is the fog. It smells like fresh rain, like morning dew and salty oceans and for whatever reason Draco likes it.
Draco: idk what this is, but it can't happen or the world will die so stop it.
“M-mistress!” Misty sobs.
No sooner than a second after the thought leaves his head and Potter is shouting “Rictusempra!”
to compete. Support Cedric, Potter Stinks, okay?”
Potter is sleeping when he enters, face distorted in pain and beginning to bruise from the fall, broken glasses sitting on the table beside his bed. Draco sighs and grabs his wand from beneath his robes, muttering ‘oculus reparo’ and watching the poor things pop back to a normal shape. Then he turns his wand to Potter’s face. A flick of the wrist and a ‘lenio’ later and Potter’s brow relaxes. Fool really should get better about taking his potions, which reminds Draco that he has his own to take now.
“I was thinking less of an Unbreakable Vow, and more of a magically-binding contract. I know you, you’d never be able to follow things to the letter, and I don’t want you to die for that, so Blaise and I did a little research and came up with a contract.”
Weasley’s pointing his want right at his nose. This is not going to end well.
“They told him his parents died in a car crash,” Ginny follows up.
Not just of him and Draco, sneaking looks at each other, but of all of them.
“Is not! Blaise says it’s entirely natural for men to wear makeup!”
her laughter doesn't mean he can’t
“Lucius was torturing him?!” George asks.
“More like your financial slave.” Griphook mutters, “Your investments were always better than your father’s, made Gringotts millions over the years.” He turns to Misty, eying her with respect that goblins typically have for magical creatures that aren’t wizards, “You, Miss Misty, have found yourself in the company of a Goblin Friend. There isn’t much we wouldn’t do for Draco here, not after all he’s done for us.”
Lucius Malfoy had entered the castle.
want to.”
He can practically feel the adults gaping at him, but Harry and Hermione are beaming at him like he personally put the sun in the sky. The hope clouding Winky’s heartbroken eyes is just the cherry on top.
Dumbledore frowns, “Of course he does…”
He blinks again, just to make sure, and then holds his arm up. Blaise pinches him, it hurts, which means he isn’t dreaming but….
his magic starting to get testy around him, he’s shocked Harry hasn’t dropped his hand, and when Harry’s accused again Draco nearly lashes out. Really! How the hell do you forget about the Boy Who Lived?
to be the only charmer who can do whatever spell Draco could probably find in a book if he tried hard enough. But, more than price, shopping with muggles means no one will recognize him.
And with that the Phoenix is gone, sorting hat yelling out into the night and Draco can only hope they make it in time. He runs back down to Snape. “Is there any way we can watch Potter? In the pensive?”
This Salazar he knows, the man is old and mean, looks every bit the blood purist Hermione complains about. Emerald robes, long white hair, a beard that puts Dumbledore to shame.
“Harry?” Draco sounds a little panicked, even to his own ears, “Harry, what’s going on? I don’t speak but those hisses don’t sound particularly happy. More like Poly after Lockheart hurt her.”
WARNING: in this chapter there's a downward spiral to an anxiety attack, dissociation, and mentions of self harm and abuse! Please do not read if it will badly impact your mental stability!
What the fuck?
Draco shoots the two men a look before sitting down and having tea thrust into his hand from Snape. Dumbledore sighs deeply, taking in the condition of both the student and head of Slytherin.
Narcissa wouldn’t bother with any of it. She’d get Harry and whatever he cared for out and a week later she’d be talking about how unfortunate it was that his aunt’s kitchen burned the entire house down.
He doesn’t.
It’s a horrible feeling.
Memory Draco is asleep on the wall again, and yes he can see Potter trying not to cry at the sight. Lucius strides in with only his knife, whispering something to make the chains release his body. Memory Draco sits up, opening his mouth as if to say ‘what?’ but it sort of gets cut off by his father’s boot.
cast it! This is
“Of course, Mrs. Malfoy. Leave him to us,” Blaise responds.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to be mean! I just- I saw it, and I thought of you, and I didn’t meant to- I’m
Ron: I'm being oblivious
“Father?” The boy groaned, sitting up and rubbing his eyes.
“Will you shut up?!”
Dumbledore rises to join them away from his desk, “No, fire rarely harms Phoenixes. He enjoyed the treats you got him for Christmas, I never thought to let him try berries, he usually prefers magical plants.”
“You were amazing, mate!”
“If it isn’t the champions!” Seeker gleams in her sly, sticky voice. Something awful lurks behind her smile, Harry hopes it’s just what she had for breakfast.
are you doing
Apparently all those torture sessions with his father had taught him the crucial tactic of remaining in control during a crisis. On the plus side, he does have most of the Informed Potter Protection Squad with him. Weasley’s pretty useless, but Hermione keeps Harry behind him, so at least they have that going for them. Draco walks them in a tight formation, arm outstretched to help keep dear old Scar Face
Lucius, being a cool dad for once: anyways, this is what happens when you mess with my kid and his friends
The elf speaks, but he can’t listen. Something is very wrong, he feels like something is clawing at his throat, he can barely focus on anything other than the panic clawing at him. However, he is nothing if not a Slytherin to his very core, so he cuts the elf off mid sentence before he freaks out.
“Hello, darlings. It’s a bit hot outside, isn’t it?”
“Blaise needs just as much attention, thank you very much.”
your hoodie collection.”
“Geia. She said to call her Geia.”
Harry tenses at his side and then a colder, yet still unfortunately familiar voice cuts through them.
Harry’s not sure if he’s meant to hear that, he pretends he didn’t just in case.
“Just because we’re friends now does not mean I have to tell you all my sodding secrets-”
Witches, wizards, and humans surround her, try to rip her apart, scream and poke with knives. They can’t hear her pleading with them. And then, a familiar man stands in their way.
It’s for his mother’s honor that he tells Sirius his part in the whole mess. For her and her alone he doesn’t spare a single detail, even when Sirius gets the murder crazed look on his face agian, even when tears threaten to spill, he keeps going. For his mother. Not because talking about it is extremely therapeutic.
“Do you remember what it looks like?” Snape asks, getting a nod in response.
“Yep. Hope you don’t mind being poisoned, I’m afraid I’m a rather terrible cook, and this was supposed to be a simple meal.”
“And who’s to say they would do the same this time? Harry’s meant to kill the Dark Lord, that’s all we know for certain. The rest of it no one has a clue about. Other kids could already be casting their alliances, being trained in the Dark Arts, there’s no telling how many enemies are out there already.”
“Today is the first day of December!”
wooden ones. Broken bits of furniture move around to accommodate the boards, even though one of them gets stuck on that stupid fucking broken ass couch that Draco considers burning.
He remembers Draco complaining last year when Harry got
Draco doesn’t even blink, instead he grabs the professor by his arm, “Professor! What perfect timing, tell me, what’s your opinion on the spotting of floating heads?”
The man that tied him to a wall and beat him senseless, only to cry himself to sleep for the whole ordeal.
angry faces.
“Like hell I can’t adopt him!”
Draco skids to a halt and backs away slowly, taking a route to Madam Pomfrey instead. It wouldn't be until much later when his father summoned him that he realized why the man had looked so happy.
At least Snape was as pissed as he is.
He stops there, as if he knew Snape would blow up. “I
“Yes.”
He would knock on the door, but there’s no point because he knows Fleur is in a Mood, so he just casually picks the lock and opens it as quietly as he can.
He can’t trust the people meant to protect him, isn’t that plot getting a little tiring?
“Headmaster,” Draco sighs, slinking down in the empty chair beside the one Dumbledore had been reading in before he stormed into the man’s office, “I respect you more than anyone in the world, I dare even say I consider you an eccentric grandfather, so please know I ask this with all the courtesy available,
“Are you kidding me? This is supposed to be a relaxing year, Harry! Healing her wasn’t a part of our options!”
“I’d like a word with you,
Blaise’s eyebrows skyrocket.
That still doesn’t make everything as clear as he’d like it to be, but if Snape is in on it, surely it couldn’t be that bad. Everyone deserves something small that made them happy, right? It was okay if he took this small bit of happiness, right?
“I still can’t believe they’re canceling Quidditch!”
“Don’t you dare walk out that-
Day by day, test after test, and he’s finally done. Sure, it’s a little hard not to stare on the last day when Hermione breaks down crying after her DADA exam, but he’s also fairly sure he’s hallucinating seventy-five percent of life, so who’s to say it’s not just a weird lucid dream.
A full moon? Soon? So soon to Lupin being sick? And hadn’t he looked ghastly on the train, right after a full moon? What was….  Draco hangs behind after class, watching Weasley get detention only a plus for the question he’s about to ask. As soon as the door is shut and it’s just him and Snape, he speaks.
Draco steps to the side, arguing more with Sirius while Blaise and Pansy greet him.
“Listen, you prat, I’m not here to insult you-“
He’s not really sure how he managed to get in his current position, but here he is.
he was seated and a full minute late.
just soak his godfather’s second favorite couch, so he stands on shaky legs and lets Ron walk him over to his godparents. He expects to go right past them, but Remus and Sirius both stop him for a hug. “We’ll have to steal Ron away from you, but Draco can take you upstairs.”
“Hey! HARRY! I’M NOT DONE WITH YOU!”
Draco shakes his head, “Potter, you just went against it at least five times. Take a rest or you’ll burn yourself out.”
“Hufflepuff?” June asks.
There’s only room for one suicidal magical creature in this house, and it’s going to be

to the argument of why Draco shouldn’t have gotten the Mark.
He’s so caught up in his own emotions that he doesn’t notice his spell work.
Well, Sirius never thought he’d be reduced to tears by a house elf, but he managed to survive not only a war but Azkaban too, so anything is possible.
“Soon, then? Have we any clue as to what Lucius is up to? What could he want with our students?”
That the professor seems to understand, pointing at Dumbledore’s desk while he flips through a book with a Greek title. “Second drawer on the left.”
Harry gulps, realizing that Ron’s height is the least of his problems. Especially when he has a room of angry friends looking at him. Well, room of angry friends and Luna. He’s half convinced that Luna doesn’t really feel anger, but Hermione and Draco most certainly do.
“Doing what?”
At first it’s one drink, and that somehow leads to five. A conversation full of jokes somehow turns sensual, pure comedy into something a little more heavy. Distance into a hand on his thigh. Joyful eyes into heavily lidded orbes. An innocent smile into a filthy one.
Draco gasps. He takes two steps between them, not entirely sure when he even stood up, closing the distance and gripping Theo’s arms rather harshly. “No you don’t. You

“We must be doing something, Mister Draco.”
It was supposed to be something to look forward to, an early lesson to kick start his project, but what he found out is that Poppy is the hardest teacher in the whole school. No questions until she’s done talking, and yes, Draco did try to interrupt her and that’s exactly how he ended up covered in yellow goo on his way to Potions because he didn’t have the fucking time to cast Scourgify until
“You have something to say, Draco Malfoy?” The man sneers, and because he’s at a breaking point and really fucking fed up with everything, Draco sneers back with ten times the intimidation factor.

“Don’t be like that! You’ll ruin your breakfast if you’re in a bad mood.” Harry grins, stepping closer to the door. “Bye, Draco!”
claim particle ownership.”
Another challenge, but that one seems a little more impossible than finding a new sofa for the drawing room. Krecher flashes in, leaving a plate of his once favorites out and before he can think he’s blurting out ‘thank you’ and getting a kind smile he hadn’t known the elf to possess. As much as it bugs him, he forgets about it the second Remus walks in.
Call him mentally fucked, but Draco’s had a very long week and he can’t stop the near manic laughter that spills out of his mouth. “Who the fuck is Scabbers?”
Literally everyone else: can you please just chill for five fucking seconds.
“Go, Dobby. I’ll be fine.”

he wished he knew why it made him so worried.
They really need to get Geia one of Moody’s fake eyes so she can roll them. He deserves it at the moment.
“Give it to me”
“It’s being in two days, Mister Draco.”
Harry’s been thankful for Draco a lot at this point, but he’ll never be over the creepy smile the blonde gets right before destroying people, or in this case, ghosts.
“Although the wards of the castle prevent flooing without permission and no one can Apparate into the building, I can tell you that Honeydukes never closes it’s floo...should you need the information…”
“Does this not seem a little crazy to you? Because it’s weirdly convenient to me.”
“Don’t be shrugging at me! If-if you’re gone Misty will be alone again, and Misty….Misty can’t survive like that. We
“Yes?” He groans, barely keeping his irritation down. He’d learned the hard way that annoying a loyal house elf was never a smart decision.
“Yeah I’ve heard emotions are draining like that.”
“Who said I’d be answering anything.”
Draco flushes and throws a ball of paper at her. “Don’t you have friends?!”
So no, Draco cannot sleep, he has no intention of ever trying to, and he will continue to pace around his room despite the nervous glances he gets from the house elves that keep coming to check on him.
Lucius steps to his side, “Now Katie-”
“Naturally, dear,” Narcissa links arms with her son, pulling him towards the kitchen where dozens of bags have been placed. “I brought a few gifts for you and your father, although some of them you can’t open for another day.”
“Does he have these ‘torture’ sessions often?”
Hermione gives them a look when they exit. “For Godric’s sake.”
The distance between them couldn’t give him time to prepare even if he could see into the future. One second Lucius is 30 chairs away from him, and the next Draco is being held by his throat against the wall.
If someone had told him last year that he’d be looking forward to seeing his father he would’ve hexed them blind.
“-Arthur Weasley?”
I looked him over, he’ll be as fit as a whistle in a few days. He’s already awoken once this afternoon. He is
“Was the Basilisk not enough?!”
Theo returns her grin, Draco has an urge to vomit. “I’m flattered, dearest, but you should know that I-”
“So you’re trying to get Hagrid fired then?! What the bloody hell is your problem?!”
Harry does not, he absolutely does not fume at the idea of Blaise and Draco cuddling in bed with LuLu by their side.
the crazy one. In his defense, he has only had two hours of sleep in the past two days and potions and coffee can only do so much.
Arguably, training on his day off while he’s pissed to the point of lacking emotional control doesn’t logically seem like a good idea. But his friends are enjoying it. Theo even came down to watch the show, wedged in between Pansy and Blaise just in case he got
“You say that like you don’t want to beat him with a stick,” Draco whispers back, sending a glare at the Slytherin hall for it to open.
Flint gives him a nod, “Potter was the person who found him too, he’s already been taken to the headmaster, and we, that means all Slytherins, have been ordered by Snape to return to the dungeons. Christmas break might be the only thing saving our reputation now.”
“Don’t forget about Sirius.” Katherine supplies, but she’s still keeping an eye on Harry for no reason. “I say you have to tell him.”
“Are either of you hurt?”
and we can’t adopt Harry if we’re in prison.”
“You’re lucky the elves thought to cast protection charms, you hate being sunburnt.”
“How are you doing?” Pansy asks, letting her hair out of it’s braid.
But here he is, nearly vibrating in the car much to Narcissa’s annoyance.
For all of Kingsley’s promises of abandon, the shops are still busy. It’s nowhere near as crowded Diagon Alley, he can only spot about twenty people loitering around, but it’s enough to make him clutch Salem a little closer and keep his head down as he makes his way back to the hardware store.

“Do what? Drink tea without sugar?”

Not Snape or Dumbledore, they would’ve simply called out his name by now. Not Pansy or Blaise, they would’ve linked arms and laughed at scaring him. Not Crabbe and Goyle, they were too heavy footed for the pattern. It couldn’t be Lupin, the man had started lesson plans when Draco walked out. It wouldn’t be his father, Dumbledore would never let him walk alone in the hallways with him in the school. So who is it?
The latch breaks open, and the Dementor is back. Only it doesn’t face Potter, it turns to him and starts to take a
Ron tries to explain a little further, but the bewildered look their Slytherin friends have is too rare to not gawk at. It’s like they’re not even aware of the shit happening around them. The bell cuts them off, so it will just have to wait until their Thursday study’s session.
A hand is at his throat...cold eyes lock onto his.
“Vernon! We only have so long! Have the boy come now!”
Draco’s not sure if she’s talking about him or the tell-tale sound of Willie descending upon them.

Hermione doesn’t like that, “It
If he was lucky, Harry Potter would be in his own bed that night, not staying at some weird inn.
“You did say something about a new wand, right?” The kid asks. He reminds Draco of Theo, with big brown eyes, wavy brown hair. The only difference is the kid’s freckles.
It doesn’t burn him, it falls over him like a cloak on a cold night. He feels
“Of course!” Draco smiles, “It’s the least I could do after all your help this year, even if most of our hard work failed. Ah-no! Dobby, Potter is safe, even if we couldn’t stop him from coming, no one died, it’s fine.”
“What other creatures are you going to bring into my home, hm? Is there a book to control that little stunt of yours inside the Potter Vault?”
Theo watches on with wide eyes as they bicker, like some sort of child watching their first tennis match.
Not that it isn’t trashed.
Draco barely contains his grin, “Probably not the best move when trying to win people over, no.”
“Yes. If any of us try to tell something we’re not meant to, our mouths are sewn shut until one of us can fix it.”

“And I faced it at least five times, didn’t I?”
“Come now, we wouldn’t want to miss dinner. I heard they’re serving lemon pudding tonight.”
“You lot certainly have been...busy.” Draco says.
he really has a list to choose from at this point, so they ended up not being able to talk or do spells. Instead they listened to the tiny man rant about proper ways to hold a wand, and though he definitely ignored Draco and his friends passing notes, he was
And then Lucius wraps his arms around his son to whisper a thousand apologies. “I am sorry, Draco, I don’t know what’s come over me. My mark burns everyday, the Dark Lord will no doubt return soon, and I need you to be on his good side when he does. I will not see my son tortured by even the most powerful of men, you must forgive me for losing myself at the thought.”
of Harry, but that wouldn’t make sense to his friends. “I have to keep Harry alive, no matter what. I’m not saying that my life doesn’t matter, but I don’t stand a chance at defeating the Dark Lord if- no when he rises again. The Malfoy name is used for terror, not hope, and we all agree that Harry is the hope of the Wizarding world. If he dies, best case scenario is that people would rally behind a martyr, but there would still be no one left to actually kill the bastard.”
For a moment there is nothing for the two males to do but stare.
Blaise takes a deep breath, “We started remembering how weird you were being about things. Like how when you did get a letter from him, you always looked so frightened.”
“The creature hurt you, that is unacceptable! It must be put down immediately-”
emotions. He hasn’t felt positive things in so long, just stress and worry and annoyance.
Harry spares one long look at Draco before he deflates. “Yeah, okay. I’m taking Luna.”
Potter locks the door behind them, after casting a wary glance at Draco he adds a few silencing charms too. Seeing all this
“But you said we could work something out if she was nice-”
Which makes no fucking sense.
----------
“Nah. We’re not. Been bloody worried about everything this year, your safety means something to people. You know that, right?”
Ignoring the fact that he was very blatantly being kicked out, Draco strode out of the office still very confused, but a lot less angry. He was so deep in his thoughts about life without friends, Snape’s bullying, and Potter’s safety that he didn’t even see the boy he was walking right into.
With the look on Hermione’s face, there was no way she knew. LuLu looks up at Draco like
(See the end of the chapter for
“I truly thought about torturing him for hurting you…..but I had to know.”
Harry, of course, completely ignores him.
“How else was I supposed to get you to bed? I had a late night, give me a break.”
“For what?”
Lupin leaves them at his desk while he goes upstairs to look for tea. He really could have just called a house elf, but Draco gets the feeling the man just wanted to give the two some time to talk.
Potter gives him a very nervous grin that makes him very anxious, “Like I said...you’ve missed a lot.”
“We’re not.”  Draco sets his coffee, and his copy of Emily Dickinson’s poetry, down, turning to face his friend. “And that’s something we need to talk about.”
Pansy’s death grip on his hand is starting to hurt but it’s nothing compared to the grip Blaise has. Narcissa suddenly looks tired, worn down, afraid.
Fog eats away at the landscape, growing thicker with every step.

“I called you much worse than that.”
The way his last name is pronounced, like the worst possible kind of insult is almost enough of a blow to make him snark just one comment and walk away. Of course, it doesn’t play out that way because the stupid first-year glares at him.
You-we all thought-”
“Nope.” The man smiles, “Come on, sir, let’s get ya paid for.”
Lucius: Wish for something!
When he tells Howie that he hasn’t painted, looked at tables or island stools, or even light fixtures, Howie practically drags him over to a different aisle and the two of them debate over paints of all things.
“Look. You asked me what I want. I want us to stop fighting so much. Clearly there are worse things out there than our little rivalry. We could be friends, Draco.”
Part of him wants her to kill Lucius. The majority prays to Salazar that she can find a way to save him. It didn’t matter what way she used, what dark methods she had to dig up, anything would be worth it if they could fix him. If they could keep his father from the dark ways, maybe there was hope for everyone else.
“You have to take someone, or Pans might kill you.” The twins say.
“That,” Draco doesn’t even bother fighting his smile this time, “Is one of those questions I can’t answer right now.”
“No wonder he and the other children think they can keep secrets, you’ve been

too emotional for either of them.
“Nothing too drastic, father wasn’t happy about losing a valued house elf, and he wanted information that I refused to give him. I’m really surprised he didn’t try more drastic measures.”
Potter, naturally, came hurling in ten minutes late, spouting an apology to Professor Lupin only to have Snape glare him into submission. A sight to see that cheered Draco up quite nicely, until he looked down at his book and realized they were studying werewolves. What an odd thing to jump to. Was there something Snape was trying to tell them? His lessons always had a point to them and-
“So?”
got a good one up.
She takes it to eighty, kicking him out of the kitchen so his tears ‘won’t ruin the food of my good guests’.
Draco blinks at her. Tears welt up in his eyes, even though he hasn’t cried since he was sixteen and watching Albus Dumbledore fall off the Astronomy Tower. He doesn't know what possesses him to do it, but he falls to his knees and hugs her tight.
“Will you
what that’s done to them?!”
That thought is probably what drives him to do it. Moonlight leaks in from the windows on his way down from Dumbledore’s office, so he knew it was night. How late it was he did not know, so when he realized that most of the paintings were glaring at him as he walked by, he tried to piece it together.
“I want to talk.”
Dumbledore raises an eyebrow, choosing to ignore the balant tattle telling in favor of giving Snape one of his looks, the one that makes it very difficult to refuse.
“What are you thinking?”
Harry: Okay

Theo’s momentarily rattled enough to stare at the woman with Draco’s shared shock,

Geia: no it's not.
“And did your father know about this?”
Oh hell no.
Then he curses himself silly because Howie was
“Ah! Mister Griphook told me you’d say this. Is that the reason he asked me to go ahead and offer it to you?”
Ellios laughs, “The mind can grow in my ways, even with shields protecting it it is still a mind. Not a fortress, or even a safe garden. I would like to speak with your mother before beginning, but I need you to want this.”
A whole group of them, wild hair, big smiles, golden eyes. They look so happy and Harry can’t help but choke. His ancestors. These are his family….
“It’s because everyone prefers to go to Diagon.” June tells him. “We’re not

The man doesn’t stop moving until he’s in front of Lucius and pointing his wand and the paralyzed body.
“Don’t worry,” Draco mumbles to them, watching himself get snarled at, “It only gets worse from here.”
Theo nods his agreement. “He’s a bit of a...tough person to manage. Not very agreeable, not kind, and
Oh fuck he was just standing there with a stupid look on his face while other people
make you look like a clown. Do you understand me?”
“Not yet, but it might be soon.”
Instead he makes a face that sends a shiver of fear down Pettigrew’s spine. “If you try and touch me again I’ll make sure it’s your hands that go this time, not just a finger. You’re only moving to tell us the truth. Should you be stupid enough to lie or continue this pathetic sniffling I’ll shut you up and let the Dementors deal with you.”
“I can’t think of a better way to pass the time, can you Fred?”
“Welcome back, Master Draco.”
Plus, as soon as he’s done with that he can call Harry on the weird ‘cell phone’ thing Hermione made.
Draco has other opinions. “Hermione is right. You need to be more cafe, Harry, we can’t have you dying on us.”
“It’s time for Check Ins!” Winky says cheerfully, like she’s not giving Draco another reason to hide under the covers.
Sirius and Remus jump apart when they enter, surprise soon replaced with easy smiles.
Ron gulps. “Yes ma’am.”
He expects a fight, some bullshit about how none of the people in front of him matter, so he rounds and steps in front of them, shoulders squared and jaw set.
As nice as that is, Harry is going to be facing a fucking Dragon in a few days and he doesn’t have a fucking carriage.
Draco’s blood goes a little cold at the mention of one edgy snake man, but then Lucius is breaking out in a full rant, something about stocks, something about ‘that blasted arrogant fool’, something about Fudge having less common sense than Dumbledore.
No wonder Perfect Weasley was in a mood. Having a parent under inquiry at the Ministry couldn’t be fun, he would pity the boy if he hadn’t been so rude to his house. He grabs it and thrusts it into Crabbe’s hands.
the Malfoys no longer associate with them because of, well, you know. Thanks to the Lestranges they’re also related to the Gages, Perrots, and Tremblays, very distantly of course, no marriages or even affairs, I don’t believe. Who else?”
it for the man. He remembers a Lily person he was told to never speak of, but besides her it’s been nothing. Less action than Riddle, which is an unpleasant thought to have when staring at the back of your god father who is trying to teach.
“Fine!” He huffs, throwing his hands in the air, “I saw Harry Potter’s head in Hogsmeade and I think it’s because I’m going insane!”
Mrs. Daisy’s shop goes without saying. Draco’s fairly positive that her little bakery is the most popular shop on Yellow Brick Rd.
So he takes a look in the fridge, a glance in the cabinets, and decides that a nice, warm, cinnamon spiced carrot and apple soup sounds amazing.
I knew who it was, I could help them…”
They’re on the way to the Gang’s Room for their weekly meeting when he spots Fleur coming towards him with red-rimmed eyes.
Harry, hiding things:
! He thought he had hidden those pretty well!
“What?” Cedric pauses his twenty-fifth round around the room, looking at Krum who just shrugs.
I knew you no good, wretched, self glorifying-”
Blaise, Draco has to pinch himself to make sure he isn’t imagining it,
“I did not cheat on my last Transfiguration nito.” His eyes widen, “O cara...placet hoc fix…”
“You started dating on Christmas day?” Sirius asks.
The part he doesn’t understand is why Snape is here too, glaring at Dumbledore like one would glare at a child.
“If you must know, twelve.”
“So you’re jealous?”
“Um, yes? But I feel like my relatives were more important-”
“You’re allowed to talk, you know. If anyone tells you not to talk unless spoken to I will personally rip them limb from limb.”
The little cottage, the one that strikes such warmth into him bursts into flames. His body follows, he doesn’t even realize Riddle had a match until the flames lick up his legs and it hurts
“A kind gesture that will be rewarded, no doubt. Have you come to discuss them with me?”
not fond of his boss being younger than him. At least he’s thankful that he’s not dealing with my father anymore.”
Severus looks at him with such kind eyes he can’t believe it’s the same professor that once called Longbottom’s work a ‘disgrace to the abominable piss presented as potions’. “If anyone deserves a break, I’d say it’s you.”

“You’re taking
It’s weird for Harry to disappear like this, even though they all know where he is. Locked away in his room at the Black Manor, and because Kreecher put the lock in place under Harry’s
“Please,” Granger laughs, “If he’d take it I would’ve forced it on him ages ago. I’ve decided to take him one battle at a time. Right now we’re working on eating.”
There’s probably some fucked up reason that making a grown man shiver in terror gives him joy, but he can focus on it later when he doesn’t have to sneer at Snape, “Can you please act like an adult instead of a first year with his panties in a twist?”
Harry doesn’t say anything, and still looks very confused so he continues.
“Because I knew you wouldn’t have stayed in your dorm for long….” Harry looks like he knows that’s not all, so Draco gives up and lets his walls crack a little, “And because I’ve been thinking. A lot. Like so much I’m surprised my head hasn’t fallen off. I should have gone mad by now, and maybe I have because I was the one who dragged you up here and our record states that it should have been the other way-”

do is the Killing Curse, just because it would be too messy for the man. The paper work, the trials, finding someone to blame….Lucius simply didn’t have the time. A real shame too, Draco would much rather prefer that to this shit.
LuLu just blinks at him.
They both freeze, taking in a very deep breath. Draco makes an effort to count backwards from ten before he meets a stone cold
And yet…
“Is that why there’s blood on your jumper?”
Once again, it would be so much easier if he had his wand so they could Apparate back to the manor, but luck is not on his side and he doubts he’ll have earned that so soon. The two of them are swept up in the crowd, filled to the brim with terror. Some people don’t even bother packing up, he hears parents yelling to ‘leave! We can come back later!” Children are crying, mothers counting to make sure they have everyone. Left and right families are disappearing, him and Draco so close to the safe point he has in mind.
Potter hands him some water that he drowns, trying to ignore the way his stomach grumbles.
Screams come from the left and right, he hears shouts, people cursing and then he sees magic flying through the air. People start running from their tents, waking as many people up as they can, warning, casting shields, yelling which way is safe. Lucius looks to Draco, makes sure they have everything, and then he grabs his son’s hand and runs away from the green and red flashes.
“Can’t you just take a donation?”
Given his calculations, he’s a little surprised to hear Snape and Harry hissing at each other down the corridor.
and a
Once Herbology is over, it’s History of Magic. Given that his family library holds more information than Binns himself, Draco’s not particularly worried over it. Lunch is easier knowing Potions is next, and yes, Snape is still irritated about Draco’s sudden interest in his sex life. But, Potions is one of Draco’s favorite subjects. And he makes a point to be
“I’m telling you,” his friend is saying, “lemon tarts are his favorite!”
Blaise and Pansy. His friends, some of his
Draco is not, however, excited about this conversation.
Crabbe and Goyle, after making him promise he’s fine, leave him to sit by the giant stones and think over how epicly he failed. He’d sworn to BuckBeak that he wouldn’t die.
“Don’t you miss you manor though?” Blaise tries.
Safety precautions were taken, new curfews, Flinch constantly on patrol. The fat lady was put back in her rightful spot, scared to the point that Draco actually had to pay trolls to protect her, another thing to hide from his father, no doubt.  Which was truly rather annoying because the git still wasn’t speaking to him, something that really was beginning to piss him off every damn time he saw blonde hair.
Pansy throws Cedric’s robes over the curtain, where Harry can hear the boy laughing at the whole situation, and then sets to work on his.
“Have you seen Dumbledore’s clothes?! All of them look like they’ve walked off a bad TV series!”
She’s one of the few people that manage to make his name sound like it isn't an insult or a praise. Just pure ‘Draco’, no intent behind it. One of the many, many reasons he values her friendship so much.
Draco scowls at him, but LuLu is in his lap, and to his delight, Fawkes comes to perch on his shoulder. He greets the animal to avoid Dumbledore’s question, which doesn’t last long.
a trial until I got his letter at lunch, and when I realized the beast is facing the death penalty, I didn’t believe it, so I went to ask the oaf for myself.” Draco rakes a hand through his hair, “I’ve been in the library going through wizard law books trying to find something to change their mind because once a sentence is set it can still be challenged but there’s only six weeks before the executioner comes knocking, so I’m running on a bit of strict schedule.”
“Harry?” Remus asks. His voice is much too gentle for this house, it seems almost as out of place as his perfectly fitting suit.
“I think you might have to be a little more forward than that.” Belle offers, and for a moment Draco can’t figure out what she’s trying to say. And then his mother’s grin turns wolfish.
“Are you ready, Mr. Potter?”
“But...I’ll wait. I won’t say anything until you tell me to.”
Draco snorts, bringing him close for a kiss on the nose. He leaves Harry to shower, but doesn't go far. No, he sits outside on Harry’s bed with LuLu until Harry reemerges in a big sweater and shorts that
“About that…” Harry looks at them, and they’re all a lot more knowledgeable than he is, but he's not ready to give it away. Not yet. “There are things I don't quite understand, I'll tell you about them as soon as I do, so uh, don't be mad, please? I know I did a bad thing, but I swear I didn't mean to, and if I have to wash dishes that's cool or whatever, I'll even dethorn your garden, I just...I didn't mean to upset you all.”
Harry laughs through his anger, “You should’ve seen it when they first told us, I was sure Fleur was about to kill them all, and to be honest I probably would’ve joined her.”
The books said he and snakes would get along but this is a little….
to apologize for. Absolutely
Draco sighs, but his foot is literally in a hole so he tugs himself upright and fixes his wand on the broken floor. Misty takes him back to the Wizard Area, he’s really got to learn the name, and somehow, he doesn't know how she’s done it, they find themselves in a magical hardware store, looking at floor panels.
Draco snorts at him, but he does take Harry’s hand, lightly moving up until he’s gripping the marked part of his arm. “At the rate you’re going you’ll have a full collection by the time we graduate.”
Krum looks like he’s debating spitting on her. She turns her ugly notebook to Cedric.
Draco doesn’t dignify that with a response, but he does raise a challenging eyebrow at the adult in the room.
Draco chats the spell he’s memorized, a lengthy paragraph but nothing compared to the poems he used to recite for his mother’s pureblood circles.
They arrange a time for their extra classes, Snape gives him the rest of the calming potion with clear instructions to take a tablespoon once a day, preferably in the morning, and even walks him to the door.
thank you for the comments! ily! and also i know I haven't finished this yet but I already have plans for the the next one lmao. Wish me luck!
“I’ll have you know the Malfoys are born without hearts.”
I am your father!”
Draco nods.
Draco stands up, steps forward, and then finds himself walking away.
Fred scoffs, “Why would you care?”
Harry rolls his eyes, but they stop of their own accord, pausing to look at the boy next to him.
Ron recoils, “This adorable thing is
But inside, Harry realizes it’s more than a book.
Potter gives him the saddest look he’s ever seen in his life, big emerald eyes staring right through him and into whatever soul he has left. For a moment he’s honestly scared the boy is going to hug him too.
Draco nods, a little eagerly.
After hearing about Harry’s episode, Narcissa demanded he come over and work with Lucius because he’s supposedly one of the best Legilimens and his occlumency shields have only been broken once in the last thirty years, so apparently he knows what he’s doing. And because he came, Draco demanded that Ron and Hermione come too because their lives will also be in immediate danger, and since Narcissa was having one Weasley over she figured that inviting the entire crew wouldn’t be a bad idea. The more people that can fight
Pansy turns to her, bowing slightly and smiling all the same. “Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy, we’ve been missing him.”
His professor looks like he’s aged substantially in the past few seconds, “So we’re dealing with a giant deadly snake, your father, the grounds-keeper who would know more about this than either of us in Azkaban, Dumbledore missing, and Potter’s inability to stay out of trouble.”
annoying?
When they returned to their tent Draco had still been basking in the glow of the win and it meant more to him than anything else in the world.
“Oh Merlin,” At least she’s trying to make it up to his poor scalp, Blaise is just snickering like the asshole he is, “Through the Black side aren’t you? Oh, love, I’m so sorry. No wonder Granger thought you bullied your way on to the Quidditch team. I think that might be worse than you being related to the Weasleys...”
He, against his will, barks out a quiet, shaky, almost insane sounding laugh. And then he can’t stop. Because this elf, the pure sweet little elf, the one who let him stay in her home, who sat with him for an entire week, making him eat, sharing water, who’s been so

Snape smirks at him, “If I suffer, you suffer, Mr. Malfoy.”
Lucius sighs, “Let me guess. A direct mind link to the Dark Lord himself.”

“Magical Ancestry, dumbass. You should read up on yours.”
“I can’t believe he didn’t tell me sooner! I’ve been on the verge of grey hair worrying about each summer! I swear this is all payback for crashing his car in second year.”
“We’re safe for now.” Blaise forces him into a hug, but it’s probably just a way to shut him up while also trying to choke him into calming the hell down, “Okay? Me, you, and Pans. The three of us forever, right? From five until the end of time, remember?” Draco nods, “We’ve made it through so much shit at this point a war is nothing. I’d also like to point out that there’s no guarantee a war will even happen. And Harry, well he’s

They all nod, and then Pike raises his glass. “Cheers to another great Halloween, mates.”
The dragon flies past the stadium. Harry wonders what the hell he’s gotten himself into now.
Myrtle doesn’t agree.
He’s thought about the possibilities before, but now he was sure it was his only future. See, he couldn’t claw his eyes out because a spy with no eyes was rather useless, same with all his other bodily features. He needs his legs to run, arms to hold his wand, lips to talk, so really his hair is all he has left.
The world in his mind dims a little.
A look of pure terror comes across his father’s face as green light shoots into the sky and the Dark Mark is looming over them.
He hadn’t been forced to do anything but protect yet. His hands were still clean, and yet he had the horrible feeling that one day even his perfectly manicured nails would be covered in blood.
Potter came. Even little Luna. His sweet, lovely,
“I wouldn’t have to run if you’d let me apparate-”
Draco listens with wide eyes, picking up his tea just to have something to do with his hands. A descendant of Slytherin, and murked with the blood of a muggle. No wonder he was so vile, but also powerful…
