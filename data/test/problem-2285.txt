“It’s just a headache.” Hal mouthed back.
Draco, Anthony & Pan: Arithmancy + Care of Magical Creatures
For a moment they didn’t speak, as they both attached their letters to the leg of an owl, and sent them on their way. Harry’s would go to a regional centre that connected to the Muggle posting system, Draco had learnt through Hermione. Not that he had asked. You usually only needed to be in a two meter range of her to learn something, really.
“Oh, no.” Draco smiled. “But I will be among the ones leading the matching season, in a few years, when we come to that. You know what the word of a Malfoy can do to debutantes trying to catch the eye of a good Pureblood son. And
“Likes music.” Hal murmured, looking at the harp that had apparently been enchanted to play, presumably to have this soporific effect on the beast.
. It can’t be the same monster.”
“What?” Draco squeaked. “Says who?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“This is Wizard chess.” Anthony added.
There was the spiteful Snape Hal recognised. For a moment there, he’d been caught thinking Snape was really good at this, and he’d make a great DADA instructor.
The dog was bloody massive, and even though it was apparently asleep, Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
Much shorter chapter. Was running out of plot and time!
“I like having family.” He said.
“Hermione.” Draco snorted. “These are fifth and seven year exams. Please don’t tell me you’ve started studying for them.”
“Hey.” He said enthusiastically when he’d grabbed one, waving it in the animal’s face. “Look at the nice stick. Go fetch!”
Draco’s throat was tight, but Hal seemed to fill in the blanks, and his eyes widened in horror.
“I’m eleven.” Hal pointed out.
“Thought so.” He sneered. “Say ‘You’re right, sir’.”
The door on the other side as opened, and Hal, Anthony and Hermione headed for it. Well, Hal and Anthony headed for it, and Hal grabbed Hermione’s wrist to pull her along. He didn’t know what else was waiting for them, but he knew she was their best chance of knowing what to do. She didn’t seem to mind, whoever was drawing more reassurance from the contact.
“You’re more my mom than my godmother, anyway.”
“’S’not him.” Hagrid insisted. “He was real scared at the time, too.”
Hal had a little pout, but he didn’t say anything else on the matter. Draco didn’t think he would ever really understand – their upbringing had been too vastly different for these things to make sense to Hal. For him to understand the pressure of being the last of your name, even though it was the case for him too.
Anthony clapped him on the back, beaming, Hermione told him
While most of the snakes were lazily coiling around themselves and barely moving from the spot they had appeared, all students giving them a wide berth, one of them had become agitated and had risen up; it was hissing, looking ready to strike, only a few feet away from Hal.
over, so Pan couldn’t very well go and knock on his door. The rest of his Slytherin friends… well, they didn’t know, for one, and then they were all Pureblood, and who probably either cast him out as well or take him right back to Parkinson Hall.
“May I see that letter?” She asked.
Hal sighed, didn’t say anything for a bit, but surprisingly didn’t try to say it was nothing, as Draco had seen him do to Ron and Hermione.
him.”
His own future was meant to be eloping to Asia at nineteen years old with a married woman and adopting four Vietnamese orphans.
“Do you think the attacks will continue?” He wondered, looking for reassurance.
hit you.” He threatened. “Got it?”
The first two days of the Easter break went great, and Draco was comforted that everything would be alright. He spent time with some of his fellow Ravenclaws who were staying, whom he was friendly with even if he didn’t know them well, and he spent time with the Slytherin first year group – they didn’t seem to really mind either way, it was a bit like they were part of each other’s landscape, after years of being lumped together at the same parties and gatherings. They probably reasoned the same way he did: they’d be part of each other’s families at some point, in some combination or other, for those of them who weren’t already more or less distantly related.
“By getting rid of all the Muggles, of course.” Pan shrugged like it was obvious. “So only deserving wizards will remain and magic can be pure again.”
He turned to Draco with a helpless look. Draco had to bite his lower lip to prevent himself from bursting out laughing, because this whole thing was utterly ridiculous. He spotted the same mirth creeping into Hal’s eyes.
“This is so amazing.” Sarah whispered in awe. “We thought we might get to meet you in King’s Cross, when Thomas goes to Hogwarts, but… This is so amazing.” She repeated.

“Well, duh.” Pansy rolled her eyes. “You
circumstances, what just happened is, to say the least, not going to do you any favours, Potter. Although there is no evidence that it is linked to anything nefarious, the ability to speak to snakes is not perceived in a good light, for one considerable reason, which is that the only known Parselmouth in the last century was He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
“Everyone, listen up!”
He did feel better, after all, so he could leave Hermione to her studies, and he might as well find Millie. Hermione, to her credit, lifted her head from her book for a minute to look at him. She seemed satisfied with her visual inspection, but still asked.
That one is a bit of a filler. I decided halfway through that I was going to split my chapters by month, and nothing was happening in February...
“Right, well.” Hal determined. “Onwards.”
Neville started. He received knitted socks from Ron (who swore he wasn’t repurposing), a succulent in a little clay pot from Hermione (as Herbology was his favourite class), what looked like a hamster ball from Anthony (apparently it was for his toad), potion cheat sheets from Draco (as Potions was his least favourite class) and Toblerone from Hal (because wizards may have cool sweets, they didn’t have Toblerone).
“Professor Quirrell was looking for you.” The boy announced.
Rolf nodded again, apparently unbothered, and Draco and Neville ran out the door and along the corridor, down the stairs that were thankfully there. They paused on the second floor, and Draco turned to Neville.
Dumbledore didn’t say anything, and Hal knew he was waiting for him to ask a specific question again, and he wasn’t sure if it was that one, but he queried anyway, hesitantly.
(Later on, the man calls out “Hey, kids. Everything alright?”)
“Yeah.” Hal nodded calmly, showing more perceptiveness than she had given him credit for. “I got that impression too.”
He stopped, not really knowing what to say, how to make it better.
“Mate, why did you throw your shoe?” Ron asked, pointing at the steps above.
“Thankfully…” George pushed Hal forward and waggled his eyebrows.
“You were out for a while.” He said.
“I’m not happy he died, obviously.” Draco continued, speaking as if the words were fragile things that might shatter. “But I’m happy we do have this.”
“Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” Ron spelt out.
“What the hell.” He said softly. “Draco?”
He walked off, leaving Hal no option but to sigh and turn to his friends.
“Have you always known?” Anthony asked him.
Hal could only blink at the man, taken by surprise, but he supposed if the woman who’d taken him had been a witch, or at least by all indications was involved with magic, and with Hogwarts and Hogsmead being so close, it made sense for Wizards to be posted within the local Muggle police force.
“Oh.” Hermione breathed out excitedly, like she did when she knew an interesting fact. Which was always. “I read about that actually.”
“How?” Draco challenged. “You know what will make you feel like
Draco Malfoy had been raised as a prince until he was six years old, and he had firmly believed up to that point that wealth and reputation, of which his family had plenty, meant you were unattainable, and nothing bad could really happen to you. It had been true for a while. When he was six years old, however, he had had to realise that Death did not care how much money, nobility and influence you had - He would come for you if you found yourself in the way of an explosive curse concealed inside a tin of Gummy Dragons. After his father had died in the attack on the ministry, the terrorist had been caught and, incidentally, the sweets discontinued, Draco started to realise that there were different ways in which to be fortunate.
“Do I have any magical relatives?”
“The average savings of an unmarried witch or wizard at 30 years old.” The banker provided. “Is considered to be around 10,000 galleons.”
“What
for almost a year, for Merlin’s sake.
One of the first things Hal noticed, walking through the station and boarding the train, greeting mates from his year, was that most of them had transformed from children into teenagers over the summer. Girls and boys no longer sat together; instead, girls gathered in giggling gaggles (a fantastic alliteration he was totally stealing from Fred and George) and boys, forced to do the same (not giggle, but group with other boys), did they best to look absolutely cool about it, when really they were eyeing the girls worriedly, convinced they were whispering about them. Hal caught a few bits of conversation here and there, and it seemed to be more likely they were comparing cosmetic
He didn’t mind admitting it – it was one less thing she could potentially use against him if she found it in her to talk back.
“Hey, by the way.” Anthony intervened. “We figured out the Basilisk based on how you freaked out about snakes. But how did you guess the entrance was there? Was it the inscription? I thought that was a bit on the nose to leave it there, actually.”
And we’re done!
“Oh, really.” Luna chipped in, still smiling. “They were just testing a new hair dye on me.”
The matron had complained about
“Of course he won’t.” Draco promised.
But the memory turned more serious. Tom gave him a bit of context, made him feel the mood of his time – Hogwarts was home to so many students, Purebloods and Muggleborns alike, and seeing it become unsafe was heart-breaking. Tom, among his Slytherin peers, had this haughtiness about him, but he also harboured a secret, a terrible and dangerous secret in these trouble times: his Muggle father. Something about him desperately did not
Hal and Hermione changed out of their school robes shortly before they arrived, and there was something weird about seeing them wearing colours that weren’t red and gold. Hermione’s outfit wasn’t that outrageous in itself, a grey pinafore dress and black tights, but she covered it with a
I just wanted to clarify my portrayal of Narcissa; she’s mentioned a few times in this chapter, and I’ve made her sound like she’s not very nice, BUT, this is from the point of view of Draco, who’s a little affection-deprived, poor thing, and others based on what he told them. She loves him – and I do like fics where she absolutely dotes on him, but this isn’t how I’ve characterised her. I was sort of inspired by my own grandmother, who had that aristocratic side to her: feelings are crass, and they should under no circumstances be visible. I believe families like the Blacks and Malfoys would very much hold to attitudes like that, and parents won’t usually be very nurturing. But, while Draco may think she doesn’t care, we know she does :)
The shop itself was fine, it looked like a second-hand bookshop, just as dark and dusty, only with the shelves stacked with boxes instead of books. No, what was unsettling was the wandmaker himself. Hal had gathered that the wizarding world was a fairly small one, and had come to terms with meeting people who had known his parents – his Auntie really hadn’t liked that, though. But Ollivander, whom Hal guessed he must be, going by the name of the shop, greeted him like he’d seen him coming in a crystal ball or something.
“Well, no.” He did sound amused. “But my family is well-known. People might warn you about me, actually, the Malfoy name tends to be associated with dark magic. Mostly though, I think people are just weird around wealth and influence. We are a Noble and Most Ancient house.” Hal assumed that was something important. “They said my father could have been Minister of Magic.”
, and he’d even taken it upon himself to write to his Aunt Andromeda.
“Okay, you’ve got some explaining to do.” He said.
Hal remembered watching a game of football with Ley once that was a bit like that.
Hal did not miss the way he glanced briefly at him. Right. Black was supposedly after him. It would make sense for him to try to get to Hogwarts.
“I bruise easily.” He deflected – which was true.
“When did Draco leave?” He asked urgently.
“Dray, that’s halfway up the corridor!” Hal whispered back worriedly.
The last Quidditch game of the season would determine the cup winner, and it was not doing Oliver Wood’s anxiety disorder (as diagnosed by the Weasley twins) any favours. If Gryffindor won, they would get the cup. If they lost, Ravenclaw would. If they tied – Slytherin would, which was simply unacceptable. Hal had made the mistake of suggesting it wouldn’t be the end of the world, and they all had gotten a twenty-minute lecture that boiled down to Yes, it would be the end of the world, because Oliver would kill them all.
“It’s too late.” Petunia told the boys. “No potions after dinner.”
“Like ending up in Ravenclaw wasn’t enough.” Another piped up. “Some Malfoy you are. Your father would be ashamed of you, he would.”
“Yeah, I’m glad. For my nan, too. On the other hand.” Neville sighed. “That’s another week in here.”
“Did you?” Hal swallowed, his throat suddenly dry.
Draco glared. Hal had noticed he was rather defensive of Snape, actually.
“I have to go.” Sirius repeated.
Hal let it go, because they’d had this argument many, many times. Ley tended to only bring it up when it suited him. And he could tell, deep down, this wasn’t all about Nils. Tied in with what had just happened to him, the abduction, the crazy worship – it just made all and every instance Hal could remember of being the centre of attention that much more uncomfortable, the little game the Tienman twins had played with him having been the worst one.
“What?” Hal tried to wiggle out of the man’s grip. “Are you bloody-”
“I’ll leave you to rest.” The elegant accent said.
“Okay.” Anthony frowned, immediately catching on to Draco’s seriousness. “Well, the lads have been roped into having tea at Hagrid’s...”
In the couple of hours that followed, Hal quickly reviewed his opinion about magic. Well, not entirely, a lot of it was still ridiculous, but it was
“That fucking hurt.” He said a little vindictively. “What you said.”
“I get asked if it’s true that the ivory ornaments at Malfoy Manor are actually made from Muggle bones.” He insisted.
, Hal read on the cover. He looked up, and Quirrell was staring pointedly at where his scar was hidden, although he gave him a feeble smile and tried to pretend he hadn’t been.
Thanks to Ron, Hal went into the game feeling rather confident, and the match started great – the weather was fair, the team was pumped up, the crowd going mad for Hal whizzing about on his fancy broomstick. Within fifteen minutes, Gryffindor was already in the lead by three goals.
Draco sat down in her place.
Hermione flushed a deep red as she turned back towards Quirrell and the front of the class.
“I think you’ll find Albus Dumbledore is the greatest wizard in the world.” He therefore replied.
Which would make it very difficult to explain to them that they could not be together in school the following year. Petunia sat at the edge of her bed, turning the thick letter over in her hands. She had not opened it yet, but she knew what it was. She remembered the elegant calligraphy on the front, the crest at the back, and the rage and jealousy she had felt when Lily had received hers. Looking back now, she knew she had herself to blame for the way she had reacted, but she could also recognise, without resentment, that the way her parents had handled the news at the time and gushed over her little sister had played a big part in turning her into a bitter teenager and a scornful young woman. She would have to handle this the right way for both Harry and Dudley.
“Well.” Hermione commented after a pause. “I guess weirder things have happened.”
“Oh dear.” The man took his turn of staring at Hal. “It really is him.”
“Homework and chocolate tonight?” Draco suggested.
Ah. While that made more sense, it didn’t sit right with Draco. He didn’t want his crush on Hal (he didn’t want anything related to Hal) to be a dirty little secret, and he didn’t like the idea of having to pretend. One of the clearest memories he had of his father was Lucius telling him:
Snape waited until the classroom was cleared to come and stand in front of Hal, who looked up in what he hoped was respectful expectancy. He predicted a lecture, inquisition as to why he thought it was acceptable for him to not pay attention, ten points from Gryffindor and at least an essay to write, possibly detention.
“I think we are.” Draco noted. “But independently of… well, this.” He completed with a blush.
!” Lee slapped him on the back. “Only great Seekers are able to pull that one off!”
Hal shrugged. “It wasn't very exciting.”
, Hermione. I want to play Quidditch and be a dick with my cousin and my friends, I don’t want to be expected to save the world.”
“What?”
“Sure.” She said, even as she checked her watch. “Not too long, maybe. Your godfather is coming tomorrow.”
“Makes sense.” Hermione nodded, looking back down at her parchment. “I wouldn’t want to read the same thing over and over again either. Might as well change it up across Houses.”
“I will.” Hal said.
“This is Luna.” Ginny introduced her companion. “She’s in your House.” She added, glaring at Anthony and Draco, as if somehow that made them responsible for this situation. “And she was being bullied by older Ravenclaws, so I pulled her out.”
And she ran off again, leaving Draco completely astonished. He shook himself, and set out to get the rest of their friends. He didn’t think it would be that hard to drag them away from celebrating their Quidditch win, once he’d told them what Hermione had found out.
Hal looked back up, and allowed himself a winning grin. She shook her head fondly.
When all was said and done, Neville was a little nervous about how he’d managed, Hal was fairly sure it had gone a lot better in the practical parts than in the essays, Ron didn’t really care, Anthony and Draco had been confident enough that they’d played games in some of them (“I dare you to place the word
“It’s a good point.” Hal recognised. “It didn’t come up, but I suppose I could ask Sirius.”
“They call themselves the Marauders.” Fred informed. “Clearly illustrious pranksters of times past.”
He made for the castle entrance, and spurred on by a barely perceptible jerk of his head, Vince and Greg scrambled to their feet and followed after him.
“What now.” He sighed to himself.
He saw Hogwarts, unchanged though fifty years younger, and a boy of about sixteen in Slytherin colours. Tom, he surmised, and embarrassingly thought he was quite handsome – embarrassingly, because being in Tom’s memory, Tom certainly picked up on that appraising thought. Draco
-	Harry’s friendship with Ron and Hermione is still central, but it will be less of a “Golden Trio” because of Harry actually growing up with Dudley as a cousin/friend, and a larger group of friends at Hogwarts, namely Draco, Neville more prominently, and Anthony.
“Then I guess that is also in his blood.” Was the cold, cruel reply.
“But I can’t wait for next year.” Fred finished.
“It wasn’t a move.” Draco frowned, immediately realising it was a lie – and the look Blaise cast him said as much.
Draco made a split second decision that he couldn’t handle this alone.
Draco was pretty sure he didn’t have a history of sleepwalking, but he also was pretty sure he had gone to bed with his slippers positioned straight, parallel, and right by the foot of his bed (he was particular like that). When he woke up, one was upside down near the bedside table, and the other had slipped under the bed. He supposed Anthony might have accidentally kicked them while walking across the room, but that would have implied he’d come all the way around Draco’s bed, which was the furthest from the door. Maybe he’d gone to open the window? It was either that – Draco didn’t think Anthony would otherwise kick his slippers about for the fun of it – or Draco had gotten up and disturbed them himself, without realising it.
Hal was pleased to hear that, having already made up his mind months ago to try and be part of the team the next year, and having at some point in the course of this game decided he would probably be trying out for Seeker. Lee was right, he would know – so hearing him say so made him think he might have a chance to make the team.
Draco took a deep breath, and told her the conclusion he’d reached himself only recently, if he was honest, through a few conversations with Tom and a
“You boys definitely sound like you get up to about as much mischief as we used to.” Sirius grinned, sounding proud like he often did whenever it was about Hal misbehaving.
He was out the door before Draco’s startled chuckle had time to fully pass his lips.
He then looked at Hal with something like expectancy, so Hal felt like he had to clarify:
He quickly got his answer when the bird
“Mrs Malfoy won’t mind.” Hal assured. He didn’t know the woman, sure, but from what Draco had told him of her, she didn’t sound like she would mind if her son brought home a whole marching band dressed in those rhinoceros costumes from the London marathon. “I’ll write to Draco, see what he says?”
“You know me.” Hal laughed. “Probably a bit too much. I’ve been very tame here, believe me. The shit we used to get up to with Ley…” He shook his head with a smile. “I’ll go next time, get him stuff for Christmas. Unless you wanted to be left alone?” He suddenly stopped in his stepped, looking worried.
“What’s Azkaban?”
On the day of the game itself, however, Hal found he was nervous. The fact that there was an audience now, and that somewhere in that audience could be someone cursing his broom again was, quite honestly, putting him off his game. He didn’t know if that same uneasy feeling was spreading to the rest of the team, or if it was down to the absolutely shocking weather they were faced with, but Gryffindor spent the first half of the game playing the worst Quidditch they had ever played, or so it felt.
Warning for a bit of dub-con in this chapter, with an OC.
Draco looked down. “It’s not your job to protect me, Hal.” He said.
Draco was off his seat
… I don’t know, I get that I’ve still got a lot to learn about the magical world, but that just makes me feel really uncomfortable.”
As if to illustrate her point, there was a sudden commotion towards where the children were, and both mothers were on their feet faster than if the seat has been on fire.
Either way, it didn’t sound good. It had been a week since Halloween, and worryingly, proving Hal right about it not being merely a prank, none of the teachers had been able to un-petrify Mrs Norris, or get the blood letters off the wall – chicken blood, apparently, small mercies, but blood nonetheless. In fact, apart from Lockhart trumpeting to anyone who would listen (as well as those who wouldn’t) that his counter-curse expertise would have this sorted in no time, none of the teachers seemed to know what to do.
, and surprisingly, rather than shaking him and urging him to wake up, which was the unexplainable instinct of a lot of people, she kept her cool and checked his pulse. Her relieved sigh told Severus the boy was alive, and he conjured a stretcher to lift him up the floor.
“I thought I’d come and visit you when I heard you were ill.”
“I will let you rest.” The headmaster got to his feet, and Hal wasn’t about to hold him back.
“Hermione, I’m fine.” Hal rolled his eyes. “It’s clearly nonsense – didn’t you pay attention to anything else she ‘predicted’?” He went as far as making air quotes with his fingers. “Literally everything she guessed was wrong. I don’t think my impending death is any different.”
“At least they’re dead.” He sounded miserable. “It’s horrible, but it’s… simple.”
He knew his father would probably have disapproved, because it evidently wasn’t a subject that led you to the Ministry. But eight years old was also when he’d realised, with all due respect to his memory, that he didn’t care any more what his father would have thought. He wanted to do what he liked.
She stayed silent for another while, and eventually she sighed.
He’d loved the name since reading about the witch in a book of Welsh legends – her actual existence was disputed in the magical community, but Draco had liked the story either way, and he remembered the part where she turned into a hawk, so it seemed fitting. At any rate, the happy screech from the owl on his head seemed to mean approval.
“I will.” He promised. “I’m not
“But don’t you want to know for sure?” Was Hermione’s way of seeing it, alongside Anthony and Ron (the latter out of pure curiosity, rather than the other two’s unquenchable need for knowledge).
“Aren’t we meant to go to a bar?” He prompted, feeling extremely uncomfortable at the display. “This only lasts an hour.”
“That would explain the Parseltongue.” Anthony interrupted, coming to that conclusion quicker than him.
“Oh, it’s happened, hasn’t it.” The headmaster continued calmly. “It was about time, poor Fawkes was exhausted.”
years? It sounded very boring.
“How did you make it out?” Neville helped out.
He was withdrawn and quiet – and sore – for the rest of the day, and while nobody didn’t say anything, he could tell Hal noticed. He was always the one who noticed. His own mother hadn’t spotted the bruise on his face over Christmas. Draco shook his head slightly as he gave him a calculating look, so he didn’t ask, but Draco would have to watch out. He was more observant than the rest.
“Yer right.” Hagrid sniffled, shaking his head. “Yer right. I’ll take him. You think they’ll let me visit?”
Some aspects were… neither good nor bad, maybe, just weird. Hal received a Special Award for Services to the School, that first night when he could get out of bed and the hospital wing – his aunt had already left, but Dumbledore personally came down to share the new with her and Hal that morning before she did (offering her to stay one more night to witness the ceremony, which she declined so she could get back to Ley for his birthday) and he could see the pride in her eyes. It was the only reason the whole thing hadn’t be 100% embarrassment. They had placed the new shiny plaque bearing his name in the Trophy room where Riddle’s one had stood, after
Draco snorted. “Thanks for the endorsement.”
“I fear it is not.” Dumbledore said seriously. “Our petrification cases are, unfortunately, very much real. There are not many sources of magic able to do this without an obvious counter-curse.”
“Just to let her know.” His aunt repeated with a smile. “Now get some sleep.”
And the castle, whether it had its own magical will or obeyed the schemes of its headmaster, certainly felt like it had wanted him to be there – the stairs leading them here, doors that were either open or barely needed you to think the spell to open them, these ridiculous challenges… Maybe it was wishful thinking, but it felt unlikely he would have gotten that far if he was going to just, get a curse thrown in his face by an angry little man and die. So he drunk the potion, and he walked through the flames, and he looked at his new surroundings.
“How much and how long to get there?” He asked.
“I guess they lost touch.” Hal figured, trying not to feel bitter about the fact that these
“You shock me.” Draco drawled – he had been watching Pan and Blaise’s argument, which had somehow turned to fighting about their Potions skills, with something like delight, but the two boys had taken it far enough to challenge each other to a brew-off, so they’d gone now, and Draco had brought his attention back to the rest of his friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fluffy’s a right nice dog.” Hagrid grumbled defensively. “He likes music, he’s not a beast.”
I hope you liked this installment are are looking forward to the next – I know I am. Unfortunately, it’s not written yet. I’ve made a start, but there’s a lot to be done. My plan is to work on it and post it before my baby’s born, as I know I won’t have much time (or energy) for fic after that, and they’ll be a hiatus in my activity for a bit. So hopefully, I can deliver the rewrite of Prisoner of Azkaban before the end of March, and I’ll do my best to pick up the next book whenever motherhood lets me!
century.” Hermione tried to moderate, though she winced at Hal’s comment. “That’s plenty of time for a lot of branches. Very distant branches.”
More specifically, Marcus Flint and another few players from the Quidditch team, who were not looking happy at all.
“No, he can only try to kill you again.” Hermione said drily.
“How are you, Mister Potter?”
“Do you speak French?” She asked.
The second time was at Mr and Mrs Evans’ funeral. The whole thing had been a sordid affair. The couple had died in hospital over the winter after both contracting a bad bout of influenza, two days apart, so the burials had been arranged together. Their two daughters were still only young, and were barely speaking to each other. Petunia, about 3 months pregnant with Dudley, had been throwing up all morning and was barely keeping it together during the service. Lily, she could see, was upset, but Petunia stayed close to her husband, and refused to make their grief a shared one.
“What?” Blaise shrugged. “Don’t tell me you’re not wondering all sorts of things about him.”
“He’s not given me a reason not to.” Draco said sulkily.
“Wait.” Ron suddenly said, a look of epiphany on his face. “Hermione!”
“It’s good. I love it.” He said honestly.
Draco frowned. “He’s not like that.”
“I’m fine, it just took me by surprise.” Hal said.
“Yes, it seems you have.” A mysterious smile, again, like he knew something Hal didn’t. Which, let’s face it, was probably a whole lot of things.
*             *
“It’s funny though that people could have no idea.” Hermione continued as she sat back down. “I mean, did you hear about the Wizarding War? You must have.” She told Ron specifically.
. He knew it wasn’t that surprising to miss his friends, the first true friends he’d ever really had, after spending nine months seeing them every day, but if he was honest with himself, he didn’t miss Anthony, or Hermione, or Ron or Neville, half as much as he missed Hal.
“You go to Muggle worship?” Pan realised with some surprise.
Neville: Muggle Studies + Care of Magical Creatures
, not like that, he didn’t have photographers following him around and documenting his every move, or fans asking for autographs at every corner (though both those things had happened a few times), but he was famous enough for people to be surprised that he was just a normal kid, apparently.
“I will owl you.” He concluded. “Rubeus, if you would please come with us. Albus guaranteed there was no need to involve the DMLA, I do hope you will not prove him wrong now.”
“We know he’s up to no good!” Hal insisted. “Isn’t that enough?”
“You didn’t have to keep them.” He said modestly. “They were just to pass the time, really, and McGonagall had us practice precise shape transfiguration, so I thought I might as well do something with the results…”
“They’re for their years.” He insisted. “I’m not going to use them.”
Lily had only been back for Christmas for two years, and Easter only the first one. From third year, she had remained at Hogwarts over the holidays, with her like-minded friends, and had been off visiting magical communities most of her summers. She had always been an independent one, had Lily. Petunia could see that trait in Harry too, and had no doubt he would grow up fast once he was off to that school, and that Surrey would very soon be much too small a world for him.
“Next time.” He grinned back.
“What did my parents do for jobs?”
The man was a non-stop flow of words, and Hal was tuning out most of it, but his ears pricked up when he heard
She wasn’t about to let strangers take some pictures with her half-naked pre-teen of a nephew. Especially not with the cult following he seemed to have in his world.
it?) before he finally succeeded (Alohomora!) and the door opened with a soft click.
Draco looked down again. It hadn’t seemed like a real big deal when he’d accidentally revealed he was gay on Valentine’s, but it had been in a rather restricted group of people he knew were friends, and none of them had seemed interested in spreading the gossip. It actually had gone around surprisingly little, so as far as most of the school was concerned, it still wasn’t official.
Finally, Hal’s draw was Ron, and he was rather pleased with what he’d gotten him; he’d been inspired by Ley getting overly excited watching his favourite football team on the telly, and had wondered how much live or recorded Quidditch wizards were able to enjoy. After some digging, he’d found out that you could buy play-by-play picture books of each game – if you made the pages flip themselves quickly, it was like a film and you could watch the whole match, but you could otherwise linger on each action. The photographs were moving as was customary, and zooming in at all the interesting moments and details. Hal had found one for a recent Chudley Cannons game he knew Ron was gutted to have missed.
“Sir yes sir.” Ley mocked.
“Azkaban.”
“When did you last see Harry?” Dumbledore asked the children.
, he told himself.
“Oh.”
Ley, naturally, just scoffed. Petunia pushed his hair off his forehead – it sprung right back – with a smile.
“Mate, are you okay?” Ron noticed the look of horror on his face.
“A question you can ask your aunt.” Petunia raised as the doorbell rang. “I’m sure she’ll be delighted you’re showing interest.”
Hal sighed. “Yeah. But at least, I suppose I can gain a family member out of this one.”
*             *
“On second thought, you can keep my share.”
“I’ll talk to him.” Draco suddenly said.
“Alright, next best thing.” Anthony stood up as Draco sat back down. “I’ll get Rolf.”
“Definitely not.” Petunia said flatly, not looking up from her book.
“Is this the famed Gryffindor bravery I’ve heard so much about?” He teased.
They exchanged a grin, and Hal actually felt a bit better remembering that Draco did have a lot of money, even more than he’d just found out he had, and he wasn’t a dick about it.
The Quidditch season had
Draco shrugged modestly, though he was internally preening at the praise.
“You have a star name.” She grinned.
Hal didn’t really have time to process what she had just said – there was something to compute there, he was sure of it, but his brain would deal with that later – or figure out how to answer her, because Draco suddenly spoke behind them.
“Harry?”
“Anthony.” Draco reprimanded him.
She led him out of the room, through a corridor and into a kitchen that Hal could see, in spite of his much limited vision, did look very Muggle, confirming they must be in a non-Wizarding area, or at least a mixed neighbourhood. As far as he could make out, there was a spread of food on the table, and a doll in a high chair across from where she made him seat – he had a brief moment of horror thinking it was an actual baby, but he could just distinguish the immobile, raised plastic arms and fixed expression.
“We weren’t-”
“A girl died.” Blaise said quietly. “A Muggleborn.”
He gave her a startled look, having not expected that response.
Rain was falling in a steady drizzle outside the Manor, washing out Narcissa’s option of having the buffet laid out in the rose garden. It was a shame as it would have been lovely, but it wasn’t like she was short of alternatives. She instructed the Elves to set up an area in the greenhouse suitable for a party of six – as informal as a Malfoy would dare, just with a long table covered in various food and drink offerings and otherwise space to stand or sit in easy-flowing combinations.
“So did I.” Draco retorted.
“Only under very restricted conditions it isn’t.” Draco argued back. “Which I somehow doubt were met. Since he just, you know, handed the egg over to you.”
“Exactly.” Hermione nodded. “And, well, I was thinking…”
“I’d gone down into the Chamber of Secrets after my friend, Draco.” He summarised. “When we came back up, Professor Lockhart was there, and he suggested he was going to Obliviate the both of us so he could say he’d found the Chamber himself and beat the monster.”
“Well.” She sighed. “As a matter of fact, I was going to ask you if you needed to go to… for any specific things that we can’t find in normal shops. But I’m not sure I can take you.” She added. “I’m working every day apart from Christmas day and Boxing day, and you know how much there is to do at the weekends before Christmas.”
But the dog barked again, and again, and actually started growling until Nils released Hal to find a stick on the ground.
“Eh, it totally is. Oui, oui, très fancy.” She waved her hand around, posturing.
“You have a serious problem with trusting authority.” Anthony commented lightly.
“Alright.” She yielded. “Let’s call your friend in the morning.”
“Speculation, really.” Ron volunteered, his curiosity prevailing over his bewilderment. “The sources are a bit dodgy on what happened the night You-Know-Who was defeated, but they say the Killing Curse rebounded and left a scar on Har-... your forehead.”
“Snape?” He suggested.
“Your cousin has your back.” Draco said. “It’s nice to see.”
The smile that bloomed on Sirius face was worth the awkwardness.
“Well, you’re in the right place.” Anthony offered. “My dad is actually obsessed with Muggle music, I’m sure he can dig that up for us.”
“Is that what?” Dora piped up, before her gaze fell on the page too. “Oh.”
“I was a goat.” Hagrid said suddenly.
“I personally very much doubt it to be the case.” Snape countered. “But your schoolmates will certainly think so. So keep yourself out of trouble, will you.”
“Do you have a comment to make, Longbottom?” Snape challenged, clearly intent on not mollycoddling him, whatever had transgressed the last time he’d been in this room.
“This is so huge.” Hal laughed when Draco had shown him, maybe, a quarter of the house. “Don’t leave me anywhere because I’d never find my way back.”
He crowded Hal against the tree again, but Hal put a hand against his chest.
“Hi.” They echoed hesitantly.
It wasn’t long before the chimney flamed green, and Hal guessed they were getting him through the Floo (he did vaguely remember Hermione saying something about Apparition being impossible within Hogwarts wards). The blood drained from his face as he turned, and saw Gilderoy Lockhart step out of the fire with a flourish.
“No.” He whispered. “Talk to him, you daft sod.”
Flint turned around, and stood up with a smirk, towering over Hal.
“Why?” Draco frowned.
So are about eight other kids in this room right now, Hal thought. Why me?
“I can see that he is lucky to have found devoted friends.” Dumbledore smiled.
about some things, honestly…”
“Well, Harry-”
Hal was distracted from Ron and jokes as the food disappeared (it had been epic) and the headmaster made a short speech that made very little sense, and before they knew it they were ushered out and towards their respective dormitories. The prefect was another of Ron’s brothers, the riled up one from the train, and Ron seemed just as annoyed by his sanctimonious behaviour as he had been by Fred and George’s constant whirlwind. Hal only made a semi-conscious decision as he leaned towards the younger Weasley to whisper.
. Right now, he didn’t know why they had drifted like that.
“I mean, I’m not going to start acting different or anything.” Draco shrugged. “I wanted to tell you, but you can pretend I never said anything. We’re still friends, and I know-”
“Everything alright, Gin?” Ron asked his sister.
Hal looked like he’d just received a punch to the stomach, and he sat down on the cobblestone pavement, curling up against the wall. Draco only remotely registered the scraping noise of a chair being pushed back behind him on the terrace, as he tried to keep his own legs supporting him. A second later, Ley was crouched next to Hal, a hand on his back. Before he could ask what was going on, Draco gathered what willpower he had left.
She shrugged. “I don’t know.” Those weren’t words you’d often hear Hermione say, but she did not try to pretend she could have known. “I wouldn’t presume to know what the greatest wizard of our time gets up to, or what artefacts he may have use for.”
“No, she couldn’t if she tried.”
He hated the idea of being seeing as a target again, as someone who had to be protected. He’d had more than enough of that this year. To the school’s credit, they had upped the security to match the threat – anti-Animagi wards had been added. It wasn't something they could keep up at all times, because it made Professor McGonagall really sick being inside of them, but she could take it for a couple of days for the sake of her students’ safety.
“Quirrell.” Hal assessed. “He’s definitely gone in.”
“Severus.” She addressed him, looking bewildered. “Mister Longbottom made very little sense, what on earth…”
Confident that he had found the perfect solution, he headed happily to the dungeons to find Severus and ask him immediately. His godfather was happy to see him, offered him a cup of tea, and Draco explained the situation with his mother and made his suggestion, not even pausing to imagine that the answer could be-
“I don’t want that.”
“Wow.” He chuckled wetly, rubbing his face. “That was embarrassing. Thank you, Harry.”
“WHAT!” A shriek prevented Draco from answering – if he even had been about to, in his state – and made Hal jump a foot in the air.
In all fairness, Hal could tell the guy hadn’t made the team solely because it would attract fans either. Word was that he’d made his team work hard, and when it was finally match day and Hal found himself face to face with him on the field, he could tell Diggory was not just a pretty face. He was clearly on top of his game, sharp, steady on his broom, scanning the field with clear competence. And that, damn him, was more attractive to Hal than his biceps and the perfect fall of his chestnut locks over his forehead.
Draco shot him a grateful look, but he wasn’t the only one who looked relieved.
for their daughters to marry well.”
They started moving backwards in the direction Draco had come from, semi blindly, wands out and trained in front of them, listening for the scraping sounds of something large shuffling in the corridor ahead, out of sight. They turned a corner, hoping for a way out, and instead found themselves in a dead end.
“What if we see you naked?” Greg asked.
. You’re not even that yet!”
“You’re half asleep.” Draco laughed in return. But he sat down with a smile. “Fine. I only have one free period, though. Anthony says he hopes you don’t die, by the way. He had to go to the library to finish an essay. Gryffindors are in Charms, I think Hermione will take notes for you.”
A third year walking past in the corridor, carrying a pile of books and looking harrowed, cast him a dirty look. They still had days to go. Hermione smacked Ron’s arm and muttered something about being insensitive and having no respect for his peers.
“Doesn’t add up with your lack of Ravenclaw wisdom right there, if you’re coming too.” Hal quipped back.
He waved his hand at Hermione’s concerned face.
Hal came to a stop, out of breath, and extended one arm from his chest. Wrapped around his other hand, holding on for dear life as he gently cradled it with his thumb, was a tiny silver tabby kitten, looking a little worse for wear.
Hal said a quick goodbye to his friends (clasped Blaise on the back, got a perfunctory
“Of course.” The man bowed his head, more chastised this time.
“Oh, alright.” Nils kept grinning. “Bit of an exhibitionist in you? Kinky.”
“It’s okay.” Hal interrupted. He could see the man’s point. “I was just worried you thought I couldn’t handle myself, after the train.” He admitted, looking down.
The others started laughing, but Hal shushed them sharply. He thought he heard another hissing sound, maybe words though he couldn’t make them out this time, and then nothing.
He pointed at the board, which Snape turned to as if he’d forgotten what was written there in his own handwriting.
“Stay behind me.” He resigned himself. “Don’t get in my way, don’t draw attention to yourself, and don’t do anything stupid.”
Hal looked down, sheepish.
Draco opened his from largest to smallest: a large box of tea bags containing different sorts from Neville, paperback copies of the three
“There’s still a lot of rivalry.” Hal moderated. “But yeah, I guess there’s also a lot of groups like us. What does it matter, really? I don’t think anyone should be strictly defined by their House. I mean, the Hat wasn’t sure where to put me. What if I’d ended up in Slytherin? Would I be a different person?”
They all paused to give that a though.
Oliver’s pep talk at half-time reminded Hal of a disaster movie – you’d think the Apocalypse was upon them. At the end of it, he approached him personally and grabbed both his shoulders.
“Hal is many things.” She told her kindly. “And being raised as a… Muggle, is only one of them.”
“Hal! It’s our turn!”
Hal snorted loudly, and it was only Draco’s education that prevented him from doing the same. Unfortunately, it seemed to cause the scraping noise ahead to move with more intent in their direction. Hal pointed to one of the doors on the side of the corridor, but they only had time to take one step. The scuffing, the grunting, the
“Sit down, will yer.”
“The details are getting more and more ridiculous from one version to the next.” Draco shrugged. “I don’t think anyone really cares that it doesn’t make sense. The bottom line is: you’re a hero.”
The cakes were absolutely delicious. Hal told Ron he was lucky – his aunt was a decent cook, but she never had much time to bake, so they always ended up with something from Tesco – and Ron, sighing happily around a mouthful of perfect fluffy sponge and buttery frosting, complained that his mom almost only ever baked for birthdays.
“What?”
“I’m going to go speak to McGonagall.” Hal nodded.
“Now, I know of this example as it is both a recent and a famous one.” The man added, weirdly running a hand through his (rather thin) hair, clearly satisfied at finding it still sleek and slicked back. “However, this ledger does not have details of what exactly it is the Goblins are crediting your ancestors for, Mister Potter. Goblin memory is powerful indeed, and they are very particular about disclosing information to anyone who isn’t blood. You could ask them directly, if you wanted.”
“For fuck’s sake.” Anthony sighed on his behalf. “Really? Still? Can’t people drop this stupid Heir theory already?”
At least – as a clock reminding him by striking nine times on the desk behind him, making him jump out of his skin – since he was now officially late for class, the corridors were empty. Hal only kept the cloak on until he was a safe distance from the office, then removed it, tucked it back with Sil and ran to the Defence classroom.
“And this is for you. And, okay, I confess, it was my idea, but those guys helped me out.”
“Thank you.” Parkinson inclined his head.
, he was worse than Ley. “What the actual fuck.”
“Ron and Hermione were there too.” Hal muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes.” A young man said with determination, and the tone alone told Draco this was Pansy. “Let’s go.”
Hermione blinked at him. “The comet?”
, strangely enough.”
“But you spoke to Dumbledore, and he said not to worry.”
“It was stupid, really.” Hal told him, still hesitant. “He and his twin sister, they… I guess they like playing games. It was like they challenged each other, and they, just, they kissed me, alright?”
“What?” Hal blanched.
His feet took him to his father’s old study – he spent time in there sometimes, sitting on the large chair, his feet only just, this year, brushing the floor. Imagined himself writing important letters, signing important documents, owling important people. Imagined being a little bit like his father, only the part he could be proud of – Lucius’ dedication to his work, to a job well done.
She sighed again. “Well, I suppose there’s a reason why you’re a Gryffindor.” She said.
“Like a, boy suit.” Pan tried to sound firm. “Trousers. Waistcoat. You know.”
he really didn’t want to stay in the castle without the protection of his friends, classmates, and general crowds of students. There would be a few people left, of course, but not enough to make it hard work for Flint hounding him down. It was never going beyond a few shoves, slurs, creepy grins and racking the few coins he had in his pockets at the time, but they also didn’t really seem to be getting bored with picking on him.
“I know, sorry.” Hal sighed. “It’s not that I was trying to hide it from you or anything, it’s just, I wasn’t… well I’m still not sure, really.”
“Get the others.” She injuncted. “Meet me back in library. I just need to check one last thing.”
He turned his head, and saw Angelina was taking a shot, just as Fred (who had called his name) was beating a Bulger off in the same general direction to distract the Ravenclaw goalkeeper. As if in slow motion, he watched the Quaffle head towards the rings, as his left arm flew out in instinct towards the glint of gold he had kept in the corner of his eye. The larger ball went through a ring, about a quarter of a second before Hal’s hand closed around the smaller one.
Draco didn’t dare look at him, so he directed his next words to the quilt.
“That’s lovely.” Hermione beamed, probably more grateful for the diversion than for the chocolate itself.
Sorry for the wait! Work has been ridiculous this week. I'll try to post another chapter tomorrow, then it might be another week (I use what little spare time I have to carry on writing, I don't want to finish posting this without having at least a few chapters of Book 2 in the wings!)
Petunia firmly refused to let him miss transport to school a second time, and even Hal had to admit it was wise not to skip the first day of classes, so he obediently prepared to get on a train at the crack of dawn. They’d booked him a connection for Charing Cross station, so he only had a short walk from there. His aunt still wasn’t very happy about it, leaving a 12 year-old make a two-hour journey into London on his own with a large trunk and a cat, but she had to go to work and take care of Ley, and Hal had promised her he’d be careful, and stay safe and not speak to strangers and all that, he’d just sit on the train and go straight to the pub, and he’d be alright and ring when he got there.
“I didn’t think so either.” Hermione nodded. “So… Quirrell.” She gave Hal a pointed look. “Your scar hurt before in his class, several times. And I saw you clutching your head up there.”
Hermione had been listening along quietly, but at that point she put a hand on Hal’s arm, almost startling him, and he realised he’d been staring at the photos in silence for long enough that the other kids had started fidgeting.
“I should probably go.” Petunia said. “Ley is threatening to cook if I don’t want to do it, and we both know it wouldn’t end well.”
“Also, did you see the teacher’s faces?” Hal recalled. “When they read the inscription.”
“You’re my best friend.” He added.
Draco, and everyone else around them, knew he wasn’t really asking. There was an authority in his voice that could only make you think the words
Writing to Hal did uncomfortably remind him of writing in the diary, but at least his parchment wasn’t sentient and didn’t answer back, so Draco could just picture Hal’s smile and his stupid hair and bright green eyes at the other end, and it made him feel better.
“Oh my god!” Hermione jumped. “All his books are on our list this year!”
His father pulled up the newspaper again, and reacted just as calmly.
“I believe it’s the hair.” Luna shrugged. “But it is silly. My father has the same hair as me, too. And I find it very rude of people to suggest my mother would have cheated on him with your father.”
“Nothing.” Draco tried.
“I’ll leave you to it, then.” Draco got back up.
“And what do you think that would be?” He challenged.
“No.” Severus said.
“Draco?”
“You alright?” He asked.
“But if you’d stayed.” Hal carried on. “I wouldn’t have my aunt and my cousin, and I can’t accept your apology for something that would have deprived me of them.”
The lawyer actually flustered under the imposing man’s gaze, and declined asking Hal anything else.
Hermione elbowed him, but Ron seemed too distracted to care about his usual callousness anyway.
A ghost of a smile made Draco’s lips twitch.
It wasn’t really a lie, was it? It wasn’t
“I almost did magic.” He reminded her sheepishly. “You… you’re not angry?”
It sounded so free, of restrictions, of guilt, of worry. Draco wished he could see things that way. Wished he didn’t have to wonder if he’d have to do the ‘right thing’ and hide who he was, to fit within the Pureblood expectations he’d been raised with, or if the world had moved on enough from that.
“We have stuff too.” Hal said, on behalf of Draco, Ley and himself.
“I didn’t do anything.” He repeated.
*             *
Hal was briefly surprised he knew Draco’s name too, but then he remembered the Malfoys were quite renowned after all, and the Wizarding world really was not that big. Draco’s dad had been a prominent figure in his time, and Draco apparently looked quite a lot like him, the way Hal did his own dad. Draco’s almost-white hair would probably give him away to anyone who knew of the major Wizarding families. Lupin would probably guess Ron was a Weasley too, come to think of it.
“I’m fine.” She smiled at him.
“You think it might be a hoax?” Hal prompted almost hopefully.
“By… learning how to duel?” Hal asked for confirmation.
“That is oddly specific.” Rolf frowned. “But yeah, I suppose.”
“Good work. Carry on.”
He tried to press forward again, but it only cemented Hal’s conviction that he wasn’t ready for this, not here, not now, not with this guy.
Because when they got back, everything went to hell again, as the news that Justin Finch-Fletchley had been found petrified spread around the school.
Pan shrugged again. “Wasn’t one of the worst.”
They moved on to playing Wizard Pictionary, which was like Muggle Pictionary, except that it involved a lot of wand-swishing and an enormous amount of nonsense. Hal found out on that occasion that underage magic was in fact possible outside of school, because, ha,
“Honestly, for a would-be Death Eater, he’s really a rubbish one.” Ron had confessed to him, his face twisted like he almost wanted to laugh about it, but it was a bit too soon to move past the discomfort yet.
“I wouldn’t want to either.”
Anthony gave her a look of marvel. “You read Shakespeare and you’re not in Ravenclaw?”
“Oh, spooky.” Anthony frowned, as they resumed walking. “So your theory is, what, the castle is trying to tell us something?”
.” She told him between her teeth.
. Everything was very loud and flashy for a moment and the next thing he knew, he was glancing up from where he and Draco were huddled against the wall, the troll was on the floor, Anthony was looking bewildered some distance away, his wand pointed at it, and several Hogwarts teachers were standing nearby staring at the mess – Snape in front, looking like he had just fired the decisive spell that had felled the beast.
“Colin had been working on it before he…” One of the girls carried on, and looked a little too overwhelmed to continue, so the third one took over.
“Uh, no.” Hal held up the kitten so Anthony could pet him. “We found him.”
Ley actually successfully kept him in a good mood all their way to London, and Hal himself was more excited about seeing their friends than he was nervous about what would come next, by the time they got to the Leaky Cauldron. They went through, Hal’s aunt still looking as wary as the first time, and Ley as pumped up, having agreed to meet in front of the
“Currently in vault, 225,884 galleons, 53,456 sickles and 64,835 knuts – all added up, that is 281,559 galleons, 16 sickles and 20 knuts.”
As amazing as the feast was, Hal decided he’d had enough food for the day (probably for the rest of the week if he was honest) and he’d rather call it a night early.
“Rather than thinking my father’s best friend, my own godfather, betrayed my parents and got them killed? I want to.” Hal admitted.
Not for the first time, Draco reflected that Purebloods moved about like the mere proximity of wizards who were not as rich, beautiful and magically pure as they were – or Merlin forbid, Muggles – could somehow taint or contaminate them. They found each other in public places, when they had the misfortune of having no choice but to gather there, and huddled together to better bask in their superiority.
Draco had Hal, and he got him a
They all nodded, and watched as he gathered a small bag, making comments about hoping someone would feed his dog (Neville almost raised his hand, Draco stopped him, muttering something about jinxing yourself in the foot and house elves). After a few minutes of getting ready, unable to postpone it any longer, he followed Fudge and his diligent assistant off the grounds.
“To…” She hesitated. “To my parents?”
He didn’t let Hal get away with his odd behaviour, however, and grabbed his elbow once they were back out of the shop.
They were huddled up in the library, creating an odd looking group of green, blue and red. Madam Pince had given them an appreciative look, like they had taken it upon themselves to actively promote House unity, rather than just being a random group of normal schoolchildren. Something was so wrong with the House system, Hal thought, probably for the hundredth time.
“Of course you are.” Draco nodded.
Hal shrugged. “I guess magic means no need for technology.”
“Me too.” Hal answered reflexively.
“Oh my god!” Hermione rushed to his side. “Are you okay?”
“Just to let her know.” Hal added, wary of getting tricked.
It didn’t take too long, ten minutes maybe, until Ron swore under his breath.
“Maybe it seems like the best solution sometimes.” She conceded. In fact, the way Hal life was turning out, a little voice in the back of her head told her it was probably a good thing that he could fend for himself. “But promise me this will never be a habit, or your
“No strings attached.” Fred interrupted him. “Honestly, we want you to have it for all the reasons we said, but it’s not forward payment for anything. We hope you can benefit from it, the way we did, or for bigger things.” He shrugged. “No pressure.”
“No.” Hal cut him off. “I’m not okay.”
“I don’t have a girlfriend, if that’s what you’re asking.” He forced himself to reply lightly.
Especially as she was the one who gave him the idea of turning Colin Creevey’s obsession with him to his advantage.
Hal knew he had a fund that had been set up when he was born, that some of that money was going to his aunt for bringing him up, and that he had a sum waiting for him when he came of age. He didn’t know how much, just that his parents had been good at managing money and planning for the future, as it had turned out.
“Yeah.” Hal forced himself to smile.
“Draco.” She continued. “Since this happened, you… well no offence, but you’ve been sticking to him like a mama duck to her duckling, like you’re afraid something terrible will happen to him if you let him out of your sight.”
“He’s your godfather.” She exposed. “I thought you could… give me an in.”
Hal stared at the inconspicuous tins for a bit, wondering what his life would have been like if his parents – or indeed his grandparents – hadn’t died, what it would have been like to be raised with all that money. Eventually he sighed; it was a pointless exercise either way.
Hal’s aunt raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “Have you been invited?”
“We’re not misfits.” Anthony argued. “We’re actually pretty popular.”
He got up to open the window and let Draco’s owl in. She landed on Hal’s desk with a happy chirp, dropping a small parcel on the surface, and Ley went to pet her. She had become very familiar with both boys over the course of the last week – Draco sent her with a letter or a trinket every day, sometimes twice a day. He also got a daily call from Hermione, usually with everyone else loudly gathered around her, though he didn’t think that would carry on into the holiday as they weren’t all staying at Hogwarts over the break. He’d almost expected some of them to be on his doorstep the minute school broke, actually, but in the end they’d arranged various visits the following week in a more civilised manner.
“Well, Lucius Malfoy is dead.” Hal said. Sirius showed no sign that he had or hadn’t already known. “And Draco is really great. And his mom is nice, so maybe give her another chance. She’s friends with my aunt.”
“We’re the Lowes.” The father said. “Patrick, Sarah, and these rascals are Louise and Thomas.”
make a scene of this.
After a few minutes of goofing around, they were interrupted as Dora appeared and walked up to their table, looking a bit sombre.
“That was amazing!” Neville gushed. “How did you time it that precisely?”
“Give him some credit. He’s not as prejudiced against you as he was at the start of first year.”
“Good.” Snape nodded shortly. “Today, however, I do realise what the date is, so I will consider your extenuating circumstances, and accept that I owe you some leniency. Now go. And for Merlin’s sake, get some sleep.”
“Moving on.” He said instead.
“The horror.” Pan deadpanned.
Within a second, Hal was again holding a blank piece of parchment, which he folded back up carefully.
“Explain yourself.” He reiterated impatiently.
“You’re related to Newt Scamander.” Hermione actually jumped up and down. “Not by blood, I know, but your second cousin is his actual grandson. This is so cool.”
“Harry Potter.” The boy inclined his head with a polite smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “It’s such a pleasure to finally meet you.”
“You know she is.” Hal grumbled back. He had already taken care to lock Little John Silver in his room.
Hal gaped, and it wasn’t an accusation if Lupin was saying so himself, right?
WARNING death of a child in this chapter (OC, off-screen, non violent).
“And I thought you and Draco might have something.” Ley carried on. “Though I thought it must be the whole ‘Oh we almost died together’ disaster.”
Draco had the distinct feeling he shouldn’t be there for this conversation, but he Pan wanted him there, he would support her. She had a nervous laugh as she added.
“Well, he caught it and went through.” Hal surmised. “So let’s get on.”
“Pass.” Anthony shook his head.
He’d made that decision a little while back, in fact he hadn’t opened the diary since his confession to his friends and his fallout with Hal. A big part of him had wanted to, he had felt the urge to turn to Tom and pour out his grief and his worries to him, but it had felt like he’d be letting Hal down even more.
“Some rest is what you need.” She determined. “Your body cannot take much more stress.”
“Oh, you thought I hadn’t noticed?” He carried on, falsely chagrined.
He stopped, and Draco let the silence stretch until he continued.
.” Pan held up a hand, still bewildered. “ Like, I thought you’d grow out of it. That being starstruck by Harry Potter had been a trigger, but then you’d come to terms with liking boys at large and start looking around, and get over your first crush . Being
had apparently never cared to try and meet him.
Reverse vampires? He thought, looking behind him nervously, for any hint of creatures that were invisible, but had a reflection in mirrors, rather than the other way round. Not that he knew if that particular cliché was true (because yes, apparently, vampires did exist). He shook his head to ward off the silly thoughts. It didn’t really matter right now.
“Just a few more days of school anyway.” He added.
*             *
“Like Neville and Hannah.” He teased.
And with that, they all cracked up again – even Neville, terrified as any mention of Snape always made him look.
“By the way.” He sighed. “Pan knows about this. He actually was quite pushy about me telling you.”
“Oh Merlin.” The mother replied, equally eloquently. “Oh Merlin. Oh Merlin.”
He seemed to consider something for a minute, then sighed, and beckoned Hal’s friends, still hovering by the doorway, to join them.
“Ley’s stomach waits for no man.” Petunia teased.
“He’s the least celebrity-like celebrity I know.” Ron added.
I was one of the realisations he had come to when speaking to Tom – the boy in the diary, as it had turned out to be. He had been right about that, it was a bit like a portrait. Tom had lived a long time ago, long enough that the name Harry Potter, when Draco had mentioned it, hadn’t seemed to ring a bell.
“It was definitely a curse, designed to throw you off the broom. At first I thought maybe the Slytherins, but that seemed a bit advanced for a student, even the older ones – I couldn’t see who would go this far apart from Flint, and he’s not the sharpest knife in the kitchen.”
Lockhart, in one of those rare moments he seemed to remember he was one of the responsible adults in the room, started ushering people out,
Pan frowned seriously. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate the offer, but he didn’t want to be naive. It wasn’t Anthony’s decision to make.
“Don’t you start behaving like that time in Cornwall.” She warned. Those holidays still gave her chills. The boys, then aged seven, had been unmanageable. “Because you know what happened then.” Hal had ended up grounded for a week. Ley for two.
“Yes.” Petunia sighed with some relief, hauling her little chain of children forward until Hal was standing on the other side of the bushy-haired girl, who gave him a wide smile. She had large teeth, which Hal thought made her look sincere when she smiled.
“It’s a good one.” Ron ran his hands over it, impressed. “An invisibility cloak, mate. They’re really rare.”
“That is very kind of you.” Petunia smiled at him. “But not tomorrow, Ley. Your aunt is coming to dinner.”
“I heard screaming.” Hal insisted.
After the class, and an hour of being directed by Lockhart to play various characters from his adventures, Hal caught his friends up on what had happened earlier that morning, and they all agreed that his day could not get any more ridiculous.
The look that Hermione gave him then made his blood run cold.
“My father would have gone ballistic, seeing me in Ravenclaw.”
-	Endgame is Drarry, so I tagged it + they do have a relationship as friends, but in this first book, well, they’re 11-12 years old, so not much slash will be happening. Other relationships will be tagged as they develop in the next parts.
She saw Harry cast Draco an uncertain look, just as Dudley voiced the question for them both.
“Is this allowed?” Hermione asked with a frown.
She also noticed, with annoyance, that there was only enough in each vial for one of them to go on, and one to go back. There was no doubt in her mind which was meant for whom. As much as she had been berating him so far for his strong-headedness…
“If you do, make sure you save my share.” Ley quipped back.
“The other one is Draco Malfoy. The blondest one. You know, he was in the magazine as well, in that list of the best bachelors.”
Hal snorted, and dashed off. The rest of them finished their breakfast before joining the flow of students heading for the Quidditch pitch.
The response came quickly, as always.
Draco thought it was probably a bit optimistic of him, but he knew the man had always felt protective of his snakes. He had an
JSYK Ceridwen is pronounced with a ‘k’ sound :)
As if answering his thought, there was a sudden commotion by the entrance of the Great Hall where they’d stayed back after dinner. It was still the place where they could most easily gather between Houses. The hubbub turned out to be Snape, wand raised and looking alarmed, pushing in a group of students. He gave them some sharp instructions before leaving again, closing the large doors behind him – which was unusual.
“But I’m gay.” Draco blurted out between two giggles.
, and Ron let out a sigh.
Neville had gotten Anthony a miniature greenhouse containing four different plants, which he explained one by one: the leaves of one would glow in the dark if you blew on them, making it a convenient night light when Lumos was a bit too bright, or when outside of school and a permission spell; the roots of another would calm any itch when grounded with spring water; a third was just mean to be air-cleansing, so good to keep by your bedside, and also just, pretty; and the last, which had what seemed like millions of tiny spikes, could be used to season food – it was a bit like salt, with a bit of an earthy, smoky flavour.
“I missed you so much!” Hal squeezed him enthusiastically.
Remus closed his eyes briefly, feeling a crushing sense of foreboding. Twelve, barely thirteen years of peace was too short to face the prospect of living through this again.
It reached him, and the sound, inhuman and bloodcurdling, increased in intensity as Hal’s scar started to hurt so much he thought his head was going to burst. Blinded by the pain, unable to move or breathe, the air saturated with screams, he only vaguely saw Quirrell convulsing on the stone steps, and the black smoke shrivelling back on itself, before he passed out.
The national press had soon picked up the story from the local Scottish papers – Hermione’s parents had been a little miffed, apparently, because she hadn’t told them about it before they saw it on the 6pm news and recognised Hal. The Christopher case had been big already, so they were riding on the back of that, on top of having found a new love in covering Hal’s ‘terrible ordeal’ and his remarkable bravery when he’d ‘refused to be led to safety’ and had instead insisted to take the police back to his abductor’s house to make sure no other child was in danger.
“A little?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“We can stay here a bit.” Draco smiled. “Want some ice cream?”
“Let me get the nurse.” He faintly heard Hal’s aunt say.
, where they could write back should they prefer not to use an owl (Hal ad Ley exchanged a look and tried not to laugh, only chastened by how seriously Petunia was reading all this nonsense) also informing them that their representatives could be found in Diagon Alley – another address and instructions to enter a pub and ask for the DAMSELS were included – to help them with their shopping.
“Well.” He shuffled uncomfortably. “I’m glad.”
that Ley had received as a present, on Little John Silver.
“I don’t really want-” Hal tried, but was interrupted by a cough that shook his entire body. “I don’t really want to sleep.” He managed, sounding like he’s swallowed gravel. It felt like it too.
Hagrid was standing a few paces off, looking extremely sheepish, holding his dog’s nape with one hand and a suspiciously moving bundle of wet rags in the other arm.
She hopped off the bench and walked away, just like that. It took the boys a second to pick up their jaws and follow her, catching her up as she settled back down at the Gryffindor table. They sat in stunned silence for another minute, until she looked up.
“I don’t think that’s what it’s called.” Hal huffed.
She smiled at him kindly. “It's a nice coincidence.” She agreed, and played along. “What did he get you for your birthday then?”
Sending their offspring to school was such an occasion, though Draco wondered why some of them even bothered to come at all as he watched his mother exchange pleasantries with Celene Greengrass and Pollyana Parkinson like this was another garden party. A few paces away, William Greengrass, Rufus Parkinson, Wilbur Crabbe and Graham Goyle equally looked like they were just about ready to pop out the brandy.
do anything reckless, alright?”
, shut up, about it. Draco was increasingly glad he hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin, because even being in a different house he had more than enough of her constant bragging and chattering about the stupid ball. He would have to attend, of course, the Malfoys remained one of the purest and richest families and were guests of honours most places they went. Draco himself was considered heir not only to his father, but to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black too, for as long as Sirius wasn’t there to contest it. He was a very eligible young man indeed for all well-born witches.
“Flint.” Draco’s tears had dried up, but that came out as little more than a whimper.
“You wanted this to happen.” He accused.
. He hadn’t known, and it wasn’t his fault. He always thought it was weird that people said sorry. He knew it was the done thing, but what came out of his mouth was: “Thank you.”
“I just want to help.” Draco offered – better than admitting he was dead curious now. “If I can.”
“Icky stinky living children here?” A cackling voice sounded behind them, and Peeves came
“Yes! We’ll be able to text!”
“The first meeting! Yes!” Lockhart cried out. “Your first duel! Do you want your first real duel to be your last!?”
“Of course, love.”
?” He blanched.
, Tom wrote.
“Sure.” Gregory said.
“Sorry, I thought…”
“I don’t know.” Hal muttered.
, fifty years ago, unleashed a monster on schoolchildren and killed a girl. But it had happened. And Draco and Hal also had busted him with a freaking dragon. Not to mention “Fluffy”. And the attacks were happening again – what if Hagrid had another of his crazy pets wandering into the corridors at night? What if his idea of a fun teatime was to
He was right – they all reacted like they’d been hit by a stinging hex and left the common room like a dragon was after them, Hal still in his kit, which caused Pince to almost throw him out. She only let him in after confirming, upon a very close and uncomfortable inspection, that there was no mud to be found anywhere on his person.
Petunia frowned at her son. “Whatever you haven’t done, I dare hope it will be fixed by the time I hear about it.” She said sternly. As up to no good as they could get, she was very capable of putting the fear of God in them, thank you very much.
– Colin Creevey was following him around like a forlorn puppy, and it was seriously getting on his last nerve – and that Lockhart was downright ridiculous.
“Mate, what a shit game.” The redhead opened with.
Hal had heard no such thing, but he nodded like it made sense.
“I’m relaxed.” She retorted. “You relax.”
Anyway, the letter had reached Hal on the Saturday, after the Quidditch game which Sirius regretted he hadn’t been able to attend. Hal would have to reassure him he probably wouldn’t have seen much anyway, given the absolutely horrendous weather, reducing visibility to almost nothing. Hal wasn’t sure how either team had been able to fly, let alone see enough of the balls to play with them. Gryffindor had lost, though they’d been in the lead, only because the Snitch had ended up hitting the Slytherin Seeker in the face after two hours of misery. Sirius hadn’t missed much, really.
Draco frowned again. “How do you know he will?”
“My family.” Hal said quietly, not stretching too far, although he still could only see himself. The creepy wizard didn’t have a reflection there, actually, he noticed. “You know, the one you killed.” He added for Voldemort’s benefit.
However, Lupin surprised him by straight up admitting to it.
“Look.” He showed it to Sil. “You won’t need a sword for this one.”
“Being French isn’t fancy.”
Again, Draco thought he wasn’t wrong. Some of the visions had been truly horrible, even to the rest of the audience, so for the student whose greatest fear it actually was, to see it embodied in front of them… Anthony’s in particular had been rattling – his little sister, lying on the ground with a trickle of blood seeping from her lips and glassy eyes, her neck clearly broken. Anthony had roared “NO” and quickly cast the spell, making the little figure jump up with a giggle and skip about repeating “Pranked you, pranked you!”, which had made Anthony laugh, but Draco knew the scene had still shaken him badly.
in there – he’d read the first one almost in one sitting, he was bloodying loving it – and he’d have been very upset to see the book damaged.
Going by the way Anthony turned his nose up at the sight, he was thinking the same. “We are getting you a red one.” He resolved.
“Dora!” Andy admonished her in a whisper. “He’s thirteen.”
“It was.” She admitted. “But it’s wonderful, too.”
Hal discovered on that occasion that, just as the people who believed he was evil hadn’t disappeared even as the school grew calmer, his admirers hadn’t either. They had gone fairly quiet after, well, Colin, and apart from the occasional pledge that they didn’t believe he was the Heir, Hal hadn’t felt much attention from his “fan club”, as Ron distastefully called it. But Valentine’s day, apparently, called for them to show their love.
Hal frowned, slightly confused. “Sure.”
Hermione had suggested doing a “Secret Santa” – whatever that was – but in the end they had decided to all buy gifts for everyone else, something small, but they all thought it would be more fun to have a heap of presents going around. Draco saw it as a challenge: would he have gotten to know his new friends well enough, in barely even four months, to get them something they’d like? Would he find out they knew him well enough to get him something
you to.” Hermione started.
“Alright.” She conceded. “If she wants to call me…”
“They’ll meet us in London on the 21
Her companion nodded knowingly. “How old are they?” She asked.
This wasn’t a negotiation either, and Pan knew he didn’t mean just the breakfast parlour. He put his napkin next to his plate, got up, and went to fetch the bags he’d packed days ago. Some essentials, and some comforts – not that much, all in all, that he wanted to take with him. The most important thing was the leather purse, filled with the coins he’d been putting aside ever since he’d made Snape the promise to come out to his parents.
“That about sums it up.” Draco deadpanned.
“I love it.” Hal countered, beaming at Draco, who looked down with a tinge of a blush, unless Hal was imagining it in the way the firelight played on his pale skin.
“With all due respect, Albus.” Fudge replied drily. “Your school is warded, and it hasn’t been most secure, of late. The governors have been writing me! The public!”
“Probably because she thought I might be interested.” Hermione answered, trying to make it sound like she was supremely unaffected by the prospect.
“Fair-weather fan.” Ron retorted. “That’s what being a true supporter is. You don’t ditch them at the first sign of trouble.”
Ley laughed out loud. “And I thought Smelting’s stupid tie and blazer were bad. Sucks to be you, mate.”
Hermione had an answer to that, which she provided as they were walking back to the castle, in hushed voices only loud enough so all six of them huddled up together could hear.
“He’s been a bitch to everyone, really.” George added.
“Merlin, I thought you’d be just like James, you look so much like him.” He said. “But that just- that was a hundred percent Lily.”
“As far as I know, he’s only had girlfriends.” Anthony said. “Why?”
“But they were caught.” Hal insisted.
“Did you get a letter back? My mother wrote to me exactly 34 words. I counted them, that’s how short the letter is.”
“First time kissing a boy?” He asked him.
“Guys!” Ron said a bit more forcefully. “There’s no more music.”
“Stop!” He almost shouted. “I said I won’t, alright? Why are you pushing this?”
Draco had to look up as the words sliced through his ramble, startled. Hal looked thoughtful.
“You could ask Lupin directly.” Ron pointed out.
“Oh, hey Draco.” Ron greeted, and Draco inclined his head in response.
“Err, I don’t think they’ve got a phone.” Hal interrupted. “Not really a thing among wizards.”
“The Aurors are looking into it, but they think he had help.” Sirius reported gravely. “From inside the Ministry.”
He flew down to the ground in a bit of a haze, legs shaking, hands burning and head throbbing, and he was immediately surrounded by his teammates, half cheering and congratulating him, half worriedly checking and asking if he was okay.
“A counter-spell or a potion antidote.” Anthony specified. “You know what I mean.”
“It is the ability to speak to snakes.” Snape explained, though by his facial expression, he would much rather have strangled someone. Probably Hal. “As you have just demonstrated.”
He dragged his massive suitcase towards the DAMSELS witch and the other first-year; her parents were standing back, the mother blowing kisses and repeating variations of
Even Weasley number six hadn’t objected, like the few forced shared afternoons they’d spent together as kids were enough to make him acceptable. He’d personally always found Ron a bit annoying, having much more fun with the twins, but that might have been a reaction to the assumption of every single adult around them that, being the same age, they must get along. And the girl, Hermione… Draco had found it almost thrilling, sitting with a Muggleborn and listening to her talk about the differences between her world and theirs, like he was doing something really naughty.
“You can’t do that.” Draco said, alarmed.
There was a pause, and when it became clear Hal wasn’t asking the question Dumbledore wanted him to ask, the old wizard asked it for him.
Draco actually had to think about it. He hadn’t projected himself that far, mortified as he’d been by the mere idea of confessing anything to Hal and the crippling fear of how he would react.
“I’m sorry.” Sev repeated. “I have a lot going on. I believe Miss Parkinson is staying, though?”
“I do, apparently. And I’m rich? I think. I mean that looked like a
“Hal.” She told him once they were out, seriously but not reproachfully. “It was very good of you to intervene for that girl, but this isn’t how you deal with a bully.”
The joke fell flat, but Hal forced a tight smile. He didn’t think it was likely Pettigrew would walk free, it didn’t look like the Imperius defence was going to hold, so he would be found guilty, but they were still talking about diminished responsibility and waxing lyrical about what terrifying times he’d had to endure, in an attempt to soften the Wizengamot. And Hal knew the sentence he got would be important to Sirius, that he wouldn’t be satisfied with anything less than, well, twelve years in Azkaban at the very least.
Hal’s throat tightened at the words, and he suddenly felt very homesick.
Hermione turned to Hal like she’d proven a point. “We wouldn’t know, would we? Side by side worlds, you’d think a whole war would be noticed, but no. I was fascinated to read about it.”
Draco, for one, was looking forward to seeing him play.
“Dead end.” He sighed. “We’ll have to go back and wait for the stairs.”
“Not interested in jokes and pranks?” Draco queried, finding that a little surprising.
be impertinent with me, Potter.” Snape snapped.
In truth, he didn’t see why a round number should make a difference. This year was unlike any other for a lot of different reasons, and the fact that it had been a decade was only a small one among them.
He considered sending her back, but there were potentially berserk keys, a murderous plant, and three giant dog heads that may or may not stay asleep, and she was just a little girl, he thought considering the witch in front of him. Ahead, violent enchanted chess pieces and a mountain troll. He couldn’t leave her standing here either.
“Hey, that’s not too bad.” Blaise said, patting his leg from where he was standing at the foot of the bed. “Trust me, I had a clear view, and you got off easy. That exploding cauldron could have taken your head off.”
“You’re a Ravenclaw.” She stated out of the blue.
“I cannot believe.” Anthony shook his head, looking between Hal and Draco. “That after last year, you are willingly planning to spend Halloween in the dungeons.”
“With our luck.” Anthony commented wryly. “There is probably a three-headed dog on the other side of that wall.”
Hal went to the sink to splash some water on his face. It was pointless thinking like that. Whether Draco was interested in boys, girls, both or neither, Hal wouldn’t know until he actually talked to him about it. Plus, they were thirteen. Things had time to change.
, and you know what will make you feel like you’re living a lie, you know you’ll be miserable if you stay a girl. Well, I know I’ll be miserable if I have to
“It’s okay, Sil.” Hal told him soothingly. “They’re stuffed.”
“How do we do this?” Anthony asked, a pile of haphazardly wrapped parcels in his arms. “By receiver, by giver, or total chaos?”
Madam Pomfrey immediately came to his aid when they passed the doors to the infirmary, floating Hal to a bed as Sev helped Draco to another. He sat next to him when Draco refused to let go of his arm. Hal came back around when his head hit the pillow – Draco thought it was probably a blessing he’d missed the whole episode of being carried like a child half of the way.
“Everything go alright with Snape?”
“He’s got a point again.” Ron piped up.
“No, I’m not a witch.” Patrick confirmed, tongue-in-cheek.
“Hey.” Anthony responded, his voice tight, shuffling closer to Draco to wrap an arm around him. “You’re not alone.”
“Draco, hi!” Hal greeted back, grinning, slightly out of breath.
“I don’t know why these boys need near-death experiences to face their feelings.” Pan sighed. “But I’m telling you – there’s something there that’s just waiting to grow, and it’s not just coming from Draco.”
Draco laughed. “You surprise me.”
*             *
“Er.” Hagrid started.
The idea of servants made him uncomfortable, even though he should have known Draco was posh enough to have them.
“I’d like that.” Hal said honestly. Living in a manor sounded
“That’s a good idea.” Hermione nodded.
He had never called her Mum, even after she had properly starting raising him, and not just hosting him. She had made a point of telling him about his parents, mostly Lily – she did not know much about James Potter. She had most definitely
Purebloods.”
Still, he supposed it could be worse, since Flint wasn’t there this time, nor any of the older kids (Draco longed for the day he’d also be old enough to get out of these gatherings). It was just Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Vince and Greg.
“They can’t let it go on anyway.” Ron nodded thoughtfully. “I know there’s already some folks who’ve considered pulling their kids out. My mom’s freaking out, for one. Purebloods or not.” He added with a defiant look towards Blaise.
Apologising to Hal was a good plan in theory, if only Draco managed to get in Hal’s vicinity. By an unfortunate combination of the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw schedules keeping them mostly apart, the heaps of homework teachers seemed intent to pile up on them before Christmas and probably Hal perfunctorily avoiding him, Draco just did not find an opportunity to speak to him for the next few days, and suddenly it was only a couple of days before the holidays and there was
“You the big brother?” The kid turned to him. “Is it a family thing to have disgusting hair and worst eyesight?”
“It’ll take some people more time to get used to it.” Anthony commented. “Or they might even never get it. Ignore them, mate.”
Hal set out to opening his presents, still bouncing up and down, though his movements became more measured as he actually handled each wrapped gift, in case there was anything breakable inside the parcels.
His only distraction would be going shopping – they always went on Christmas Eve with his mother, gathering trinkets for people he didn’t care about and she wanted to either subtly impress or subtly insult, and usually he followed along taking advantage of the holiday spirit to get her to buy him a few things he wanted. But this year, he actually had his own gifts to buy, and he was looking forward to that.
“Dudley, language.” Petunia said reflexively, with no real conviction. She was looking at the list over Harry’s shoulder with no small amount of concern. “Where will we find all these things?”
“Are you now?” His father’s lips twitched in a small smile, as his mother rolled her eyes fondly.
There was rustling all around them, and Hal cast another
“I could have been a big deal!” Ley argued. “What if Sirius hadn’t been there?”
“Please tell me, in all those years living with him, that you at least once put frogs in his bed.”
“Grab him!” Voldemort hissed angrily – he too must have realised he didn’t have hands.
to sign something, take his picture and ask if he was excited to have Lockhart as a teach next year.
“They’ll calm down over the break.” Hal assessed.
“She was flirting with you.” Neville concluded.
The last couple of weeks of February and the first two weeks of March had been the most intense Hal had ever known in terms of Quidditch practice. Oliver clearly operated under the assumption, that the Hufflepuff team under the new Captainship of Cedric Diggory was a force to be reckoned with. The rest of them had tried to get him to chill, to which he usually replied coldly ‘
“How can it possibly be your fault?”
on a daily basis, when they were doing things as ridiculous as letting a talking hat sort children into school houses – which, he’d gathered, held significantly more importance here than they did in a normal school. When his turn came, he didn’t even know if he should try to influence it, or let it happen. The descriptions of each house had been simplistic to say the least, and surely the categorisation couldn’t accurately capture what a bunch of eleven year-olds would shape up to be.
“Who cares, we won!” Fred (maybe George) clasped Hal’s shoulder. “The unshakeable little bugger caught the Snitch!”
“And then there was light.” Anthony grinned.
She barely had time to nod before the Headmaster walked to Pettigrew to take his arm, and they were gone in another burst of flames.
Hal’s stomach was hurting and his hands shaking from refrained laughter, so he had to stop and do a few normal, boring ones, taking Lockhart’s dictation to calm himself down.
“You know…” He interrupted himself with a little chuckle. “It’s just funny, because Ley said something when I was last home.”
It went on like that for twenty minutes, the whole Gryffindor Quidditch team going for it, as well as Ron, and a few players from other houses, with Hal looking like he was trying to disappear into the bench, and most other students cheering like it was a boxing match.
“Draco.” Draco adopted his best haughty air even as he extended a hand for Nils to shake. “I’ve heard about you.”
“I’m sure they’re looking into it.” Neville said charitably.
Petunia had met James Potter exactly twice in her life. The first time, when Lily was thirteen, and they had gone to pick her up from the train station – their parents had insisted to ‘make a day of it’ and dragged Petunia along. They weren’t even friends at the time, Lily and James, although it appeared the latter already had a crush on the former. Petunia saw the boy as nothing else but an unruly, unmanageable child, who had been shouting from the other end of the platform at her sister (‘See you next year, Evans! My heart will remain yours forever! Write to me!’).
Pan seemed to deflate, dropping his arms to his side from where he’d crossed them defensively across his chest.
Draco directed a sharp, steely glance up at the older boy. “Oh please.” He knew it was ill-advised to rise to the bait, but the term always triggered something in him. “What does that even mean?”
“I think I would, too.” She echoed honestly. “And that doesn’t mean there’s a better and a worse version. It doesn’t mean we would have been happier, or less happy. Only one thing would have been exactly the same.”
“It’s so fancy.” Pansy commented, feigning as much disinterest as she could while her eyes were shining with amazement.
“This one to go forward.” She pointed. “This one to go back.”
Hal’s instinct was to ask how the man knew his name, but yeah, duh, everyone did. He’d probably just exposed his scar, too. Self-conscious about it now, he carefully repositioned his glasses and brushed his hair back forward, the way he usually did to make sure the marred part of his face was mostly covered.
Draco turned an embarrassed look to Hal in particular. “He’s my godfather.” He confessed. “So I’ll talk to him.”
Too late, Draco remembered why he hadn’t revealed this the first time around, and the whole other reason why We Do Not Talk About Sirius Black and realised that he shouldn’t, really shouldn’t have mentioned him at all. There was no way for him to backpedal when Hal asked:
“In fact.” George turned to his brother, who was already nodding like they’d had the same idea. “We might need to speak to McGonagall.” Fred finished.
Dumbledore seemed to consider telling him something for a long moment, but in the end he almost imperceptibly shook his head.
. Hal would take what he could get.
“Very good.” Lupin nodded approvingly. “We would be very strong against it right now, as there’s so many of us. However, for the purpose of this class, I want you to learn how to face one on your own. You can encounter Boggarts quite commonly in old houses – or indeed schools.”
“No.” Nick eventually answered shortly. “I suppose not.”
Warning for more bullying, sorry :( I promise there is a punch in the face in the post for Flint, but this might still be a while before he gets his due.
“That sounds good.” She smiled. “Less of a waste of a day.”
“I’m ready.” Hal said in way of an answer.
He meant to say that it was rather risky putting all your eggs in one basket, and what if something happened to the one and only heir, or he didn’t want children to continue the line? But he could only manage so much.
She gathered her books and, true to her word, actually got up and left. Neville watched her go somewhat anxiously, while the remaining boys were pressing their lips together and trying not to laugh until she was well out of sight and earshot.
“Oh, you gonna cry, mouth-breather?” The older kid was telling the little girl. “Are those tears behind your horrible glasses?”
“You alright?” Draco asked him with a frown.
“It was one of the bedtime stories my mother used to tell me.” Pan described. “When Hogwarts was built, Salazar Slytherin wanted it to stay pure. Sadly, his friends betrayed him, united three to one, and decided Mud- Muggleborns would be accepted into the school too if they showed magical abilities. Salazar knew his friends were making a serious mistake, and one day the Wizarding world would curse them for it. Salazar had to do something about it, but he couldn’t at the time, not without engaging in an unbalanced fight. So he built a secret chamber without telling the others, and he left some of his magic in there. And when the time would come, the Chamber would open, and Salazar’s magic would save the world.”
“Actually, that’s what I came to talk to you about.”
Maybe he could drop him off with the others, pretend to go off to the toilet and then conveniently not manage to find his way back to their carriage. Motivated by this half-baked plan, he turned to say goodbye to his mother – a touch of the cheek, and she petted his hair and told him to write, then went back to her conversation quite untroubled – and headed for the train, expecting the other boy to follow. They usually did. Draco suspected none of the kids particularly liked him or wanted his approval, but that their parents had told them to stay on his good side. Lucius Malfoy might have been dead for five years, still their wealth, nobility and influence hadn’t changed and their name continued to bear its historical weight.
He finished by crossing his arms in a bit of a sulk, getting ready for Ley to make fun of him, because Ley didn’t really do sentiment, he tended to deflect anything coming too close to resembling a feeling. Usually with farting noises. But Ley simply tapped his finger on the paper.
There was no need for that. But Pansy – Pan – raised up a hand, shaking her head.
“It doesn’t have to change anything.” Draco went on. “It’s not a big deal, I just thought you should know.”
an Heir of Slytherin.” Hermione said one night after a group of Hufflepuffs had ran away from Hal throwing random accusations about his hidden powers.
“Yes, professor.” Hal nodded with as much conviction as he could. “That is what the letter said.”
Hal frowned at him, somewhere between hope and confusion. It did make him feel better to have it suggested that, even if he’d found the strength to use the simple spell, it wouldn’t have worked.
There was nothing the rest of them could do but follow his directions, and be in awe, really.
Hal dismounted the broom, and gave it a considering look.
Inevitably, his gaze slipped to Hal’s forehead. Self-conscious, he put a hand over the hair covering it.
Hal shot Justin a despairing look, and they actually had a bonding moment as the other boy answered with an eye roll and they both tried not to laugh.
“At your age, these things are going to start happening!” Sirius predicted cheerfully. “What about you?”
Hal laughed. “Me? Never.”
you were thinking, Harry. In Potions, of all classes.”
Particularly now, he wished he didn’t know. Because he’d been
It hit him suddenly, with a wave of nausea that had him clamp a hand over his mouth. He hadn’t
come after twins.
“What are you going to do about that?” Draco asked.
I am convinced that with a loving mother (so to speak) Hal wouldn’t be so reckless. He did promise Petunia not to go looking for trouble! So I made quite a few changes to the ending. Scratched the visit to Aragog, because why in their right mind would they do that – I don’t think they’re close enough to Hagrid for that suggestion to make sense, and also no Ford Anglia to rescue them!
“Mais si, je te jure!” One of the girls was insisting to her friend. “C’est lui.”
“If this is how you all feel, you can fuck right off.” He told them.
“Come, I’ll show you something.” Draco waved him forward.
. It reminded Hal from that sketch from the Monty Python he and Ley loved, with the philosophers playing football.
, much faster than a dumb-looking thing of that size would have been expected to move.
Confused, Hal looked down at himself, only to find out he… wasn’t there. He could distinctly see the floor, and his discarded shoes, right through where his legs should have been.
“It’s never been so easy for mom to tell us apart.” George jested.
She seemed to understand anyway. “Okay.” She said softly. “You know if you change your mind, you can just call me, alright?”
“I’ll get him a bigger cake to make up for it.” Petunia added with a smile. “Even though we’ll celebrate his birthday properly when you’re back, like we did last year.”
“There is a transformed werewolf in the school.” He announced. “They don’t know exactly where.”
doing here?” Anthony added.
“She’s better than the lot of us put together.” Neville frowned.
happy.” Pan sighed. “Father’s been ranting about how incompetent Dumbledore is for not even being able to figure this out, while also gloating about Mud- Muggleborns being attacked.”
“No one.” The captain shook his head. “Doug was the only one who tried out.”
“A little closer friends than with the rest of the gang, it seemed to me.” Ley assessed rather insightfully. “And didn’t you tell me he’s gay?”
“Were you famous?” Hal asked. “When you lived.”
“How can you do this to us?” Her tone wasn’t asking for an answer.
. He certainly did not want to sleep here, on the wet stone floor of the second floor girls bathroom, looked over by Moaning Myrtle and feet away from a tunnel leading to a Chamber were he and Hal had almost just both been killed and where the corpse of a giant snake laid. But altogether, he wanted this nightmare to be over, and sleep for at least three days.
“Although…” He mused, brows still knit together.
“Oh, are they not?” Hermione smiled. “That’s okay, I can’t exactly tell her either way. Well, thank you for your help. I’m going to go get some of those acid apple chocolates before they’re all gone.”
The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware.
“It’s different.” She argued.
“Is it about… Draco wanted to come.” Ron interrupted himself. “But he figured he’d be yelled out of the room, being the enemy today and all.”
“It’s not like I won’t share.” He grinned.
“It has been brought to my attention.” He said. “That I may have treated you with… unfair prejudice.”
Harry felt a little heartache at the very short list. That’s it, he thought. My entire family. A thought struck him – or was it?
“Good lord, he’s as brown as a Paki.” Marge commented upon spotting Hal.
“Such a pity.” Pan carried on in her poshest voice. “What does bring you here?”
Sneer and scoff came back full force. “He’s the spitting image of his father.”
His teeth clenched, Hal was almost in too much pain to retort with a barb of any kind, but he’d be damned if he let that smug bastard have the last word.
“Right, we’ll have to see if she was checking for the entrance somehow. Or clues.”
“Mate.” Ley intervened warningly, glaring up at him.
“And what caused you to fall?” He probed.
“I’m aware.” Draco snorted. “If you’re worried he wouldn’t get his arse handed to him, trust me, I won’t be the one doing him any favours.”
He looked up to the headmaster, challenging him to give him an explanation.
He almost got caught – he heard whispered voices, and in trying to scamper, came right in the path of Snape and Quirrell, clearly in the middle of an argument. He was only able to narrowly escape by slipping into an empty classroom, and waited with bated breath for the two men’s footsteps to move away. Only when he had been quite sure of the complete silence for a few minutes did he release a relieved sigh, and look around.
Pan folded the parchment back into his pocket, a small smile playing on his lips.
Neville readily agreed, and they split up, each running off in a different direction.
“I gathered some hair last time Daddy had a dinner.” Pansy smirked. “Let’s go to a bar!”
“People say it like I’m meant to feel closer to them, because they probably sat in the same chair fifteen years ago.” He carried on, his voice small. “But I don’t. They’re dead, and I don’t have any memories of them.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It hadn’t bothered him since the end of the game. Dumbledore had spouted some cryptic shit about that too, but nothing constructive.
In his lap, Silver mewed softly as if sensing his distress. He missed home.
“Your family are Muggles, aren’t they?” Her disdain of that fact was still clear, but she was getting better at toning down her prejudice. “The only way they’ll get any idea what you can do here, is pictures. So get your fanboy to give them to you.”
“We had ice-cream for lunch.” Sirius piped up, sounding wretched.
“What happened?” Hal frowned.
“When you said you were famous and shit…” Ley shrugged. “I just didn’t realise it was like that. It was weird.”
“Probably.” Ley agreed. “Oh, here’s Ceri again.”
“Hal, are you okay?” Hermione asked. “You ran off, did we say something to upset you?”
“Draco, you can stay with your friend.” She said when they were in the hall. “I have business with the vault manager. You have enough money?”
“Can I ask for an autograph?” The boy asked his mother, jumping up and down, probably in what he thought was a quiet voice. Petunia, and even Hal from the water, heard him loud and clear.
“I try.” Draco chuckled. “How are you feeling?”
“Yes.” Draco’s mother confirmed. “And this one’s for you.”
“Okay, which ones do you want to practice?”
“I don’t know, actually.” He said eventually. “Like I said, I don’t want to date before fourth year, I don’t know why but I always had that in my mind, so I’ve not really thought about it. I think I’d want to try different things, and see what feels right.”
“How did that happen?” Hal asked.
“Pretty standard, wasn’t it?” Hal deadpanned.
“I don’t know.” She confessed, her voice apologetic. “You know how I didn’t… I wasn’t really in touch with Lily, at the time.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, but carried on. “Do you remember what Blaise said, about You-Know-Who?”
“I thought that too at first, but… Back in September, you know when everyone was talking about the break in at Gringotts?”
Nymphadora was rather looking forward to meeting her aunt and cousin, but she was also a little anxious. She had grown up with tales – not much, snippets her mother had allowed her to know – of the toxic environment that had been the Black family, or any Pureblood family for that matter. The Malfoys were kind of the flagship for that, too. Dora knew that you didn’t shake generations of ideologies and snobbery that easily.
Draco’s eyebrows went up.
“Dearie me!” Lockhart laughed. “How time flies! Gentlemen, a pleasure as always, but I am afraid young Harry and myself must go!”
Sirius smiled.
When Draco started to wander, bored out of his mind, after greeting whoever needed to be greeted alongside his mother like a well brought-up wizard, it took him only a few minutes to realise he’d made a critical mistake in walking away from other people. He was walking through another garishly decorated room when he happened upon a group of teenagers drinking firewhisky, sprawled on the – no doubt expensive – armchairs like they owned the place.
Confused murmurs rippled across the room, leaving rise to panicked voices, and soon even screams of fear. Teachers were on their feet, making fruitless calming gestures, while some students started scrambling off the benches with no plan of what to do next.
“Fair point.” Dora sighed. “If that makes you feel better, there are still some supporters of his out there, but he’s definitely no longer flavour of the month. Most people are rooting for you. Some stores have even stopped selling his books.”
Looking up, he recognised the blond boy from the dressmaker’s shop a few weeks ago.
This time, Hal did draw out his wand, the words bringing him back to that time they’d played Wizard “It”. It was like regular It, except spells were allowed, and it made him remember he may not know duelling and protecting spells, but he knew his fair share of jinxes.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully. “Bad timing, I guess.”
“Wanna see some France?” Dora suggested.
PLOT TWIST! Hope you enjoyed it. I hadn’t actually planned for this scene when I started writing, but I was boring myself with this chapter and it suddenly came to me. And so at the time of writing this I have no idea where things will go from here haha exciting isn’t it!
Which might have been able to fly, and wasn’t even that far off from the truth. Unfortunately, Ley answered at the exact same time.
“And those blue eyes.” Ron added in a stupid voice, batting his eyelashes.
Distractedly, Draco noticed it did, really, and quite nicely so.
“Because I’m a boy, I suppose. A male heir. I’ll carry out the Malfoy name.”
Draco tried and struggled to sit up, and Hal rushed to help him out.
remarks. “I’m sure Hal will act accordingly if it really starts to bother him.”
“How did you know I wouldn’t miss?” Angelina asked Fred when Oliver let them go to hug and sob on other players.
“Good.” The other boy grinned. “Because you were brilliant, mate, curse and all. With you in the team, we have a chance of winning the cup, or, well, at least we won’t end up last.”
“Maybe.” Draco admitted quietly.
“Are you two dorks quite done now?” Draco intervened.
Another step back brought Draco’s back to the wall, and there was nowhere else to go. And he had grown a bit over the summer, sure, but the other boy was still six years his senior and a foot and a half taller. And he was still moving forward.
“She’s not making you quit, is she?” Ron winced.
His friends looked at each other, and all shook their heads.
There were a few pockets of discontent, namely among Slytherins, who theorised Hal had orchestrated the whole thing as a great ploy to make himself look good. Hal decided again not to rise to any of it – he didn’t feel like he had the energy anyway. Madam Pomfrey had warned him and Draco that it would still be a little while before they felt completely normal, and there was nothing but time that would allow their cores to fully heal and replenish. On top of that, Hal’s first night of sleeping without a spell or potion had been dreadful – he couldn’t go to sleep, then he couldn’t stay asleep, then he’d had nightmares and, all in all, had barely slept a wink.
“Er. Thanks?” Hal hazarded.
). “So you don’t know much about your parents’ friends at school, and what you know isn’t great. Maybe it’s better this way. I know who my parents’ friends are, and they’re all followers of You-Know-Who or posh arseholes who don’t care either way as long as
“Because it’s my story and I’ve not given Pansy permission to repeat it to you guys?” Blaise answered Anthony, grinning like he knew exactly how much his mere presence was riling him up, and basking in the satisfaction. “Now do you want to hear it or not?”
Hal understood what he meant, between the lines. It was a drawing. A fantasy, which he was allowed to have. It didn’t make him ungrateful for the life he had.
The boy shrugged. “I don’t know, do I? He’s in his office.”
Things did get a little chaotic as they handed out their respective piles, but in the end each of them had their presents and they decided to take turns opening them all.
After a short walk, they ended up by the lakeshore transfiguring pebbles into beetles – it wasn’t working that well, the spell would hold for about two minutes before you were looking at walking rocks, which stopped altogether shortly after that. They looked up as they heard footsteps, and came face to face with McGonagall, out on a walk, some epic tartanwear going on that they had to try very hard not to laugh at.
I’m not a girl, even if I look like one.”
He wrote.
“Or was it the sink?”
In hindsight, Hal would say it had been worth it, because he loved snowball fights in the first place, but
“What.” He was the one to speak. “Happened here.” His tone was cold, but Hal did not miss the worry in his eyes as he looked over at Draco.
“We’ll miss the next class!”
“You got past the dog?” The man asked without slowing down to even turn towards him. “How?”
“It’s about four times as salty as normal salt.” Neville warned. “Use it carefully.”
Hal, immediately, looked around for Draco. He wasn’t back.
Hal’s smile fell, out of surprise. “Like…” He probed hesitantly.
– there was no way in the Underworld he had betrayed him, Lily and their baby.
His mother turned to him immediately.
“Your fanclub is growing.” Ron snorted.
“That backfired.”
Rather unfortunately, that was exactly the moment Ley popped back into the room to tell them lunch was ready, and they both could see the startled look on his face before it morphed into a smile.
“He’s not going to laugh at you.” Draco reiterated. “Let’s just get this over with.”
Draco really believed that, though it would have been hard to be
and stuff like that? I’m sure we’ll hear it.”
They’d found him underneath the slide in the playground, half frozen to death, and even though it looked pathetic, Hal had fallen in love with it as soon as he’d picked it up, and the little claws had feebly dug into the skin of his fingers. Ley had decided right alongside him that they needed to take it home and nurse it back to health.
“Ah, yes.” The headmaster smiled. “It seemed you reacted instinctively in the face of danger, and produced a non-verbal, wandless protection charm. It is akin to the accidental magic that occurs in young children. This tends to fade out when wizards receive their wands, but it is known to happen until puberty under intense emotion, such as you have just experienced, and more rarely after that.”
Little Silver hissed, endearingly looking almost like he was placing himself in front of Hal to protect him against the threatening other cats.
“Oh, and I love these.” He turned to a shelf in his bookcase, where Draco almost blushed to see his silly little wooden figures lined up.
“Homosexuality is a weird thing among Purebloods.” Hermione said. “What?” She adopted an innocent stance when everyone started at her. “I read about it. I guess it’s a bit like… royalty for Muggles, maybe? Maintaining the bloodline is crucial. Bastards are unacceptable. So on the one hand, I think some young Purebloods are advised to, well, relieve their urges with someone of the same sex to avoid inconvenient pregnancies. On the other hand, a same-sex
After fifteen minutes or so, their gawpers were joined by a man and a boy maybe a couple years younger than Hal and Ley were.
“We’ll try it tomorrow, alright?”
“Yes.” Hal said firmly.
There was a silence, and Draco whispered his name carefully, and Hal realised he’d lied back down and closed his eyes. Draco’s voice was soothing, and while the words weren’t altogether reaching his brain, the elegant accent was nice to listen to.
Draco looked embarrassed at the compliment, and mumbled something about it being what friends do, so Hal quickly changed the subject by pulling him towards the Quidditch supply shop.
“He got shot.”
“Yeah, I… No.” Pan admitted. “I mean, part of my brain knew you’re Half-Blood, but I never stopped to think about it.”
Harry Potter’s name was called and he jumped on the opportunity to focus on something else.
Mrs Hooch blew the whistle and Lee Jordan’s commentary was just shrieking for a half a minute, with another half of
After a couple of minutes of this, the other players, Lee Jordan who was commentating, and the audience started noticing. Hal could hear Fred and George shout something at him, though he couldn’t make out the words. The commentary changed tone too, and cheers turned to screams when a particularly violent shake had Hal slip halfway to the tip of his broomstick, dangerously close to falling off.
“Last time I saw her, she was younger than you are now.” Sirius recalled with a fond smile. “But already a handful.”
“You’d better hope we are.” He retorted. “Since you just told me your darkest deepest secret.”
“Shut up, Zabini.” Pan retorted without heat.
Hal took the cloak off, and Dean proceeded to take the piss out of Seamus, as Neville and Ron came to take a closer look, both looking flabbergasted.
“Hooch is good at first aid.” Ron tried to sound reassuring. “She’ll know what to do while waiting for Pomfrey, and she’ll set him right. He’ll be alright.”
“We need to get teachers.” Draco told him.
“Hal, look.” Hermione suddenly waved something in his face, clearly having reached the limit of containing herself while the others talked, and jumping into the breach left in the conversation by everyone laughing.
Muggleborn, Draco would guess from the look of amazement and wonder the boy cast on everything. Though he knew of wizards who did not spend much time in magical cities, they at least would not have looked like they were about to squeal in delight at the sight of a floating measuring tape. That was just everyday household magic.
“How are you feeling, darling?” She asked him.
Ron’s sister was in the doorway, clearly trying to look uninterested, though the way she tapped her foot against the frame gave away that she was all wired up with excitement. She was tall, for a ten year-old at least, and while she was wearing her bright ginger hair in pigtails, they were French-plaited (a term Hal had learnt from the Patil twins, who braided their hair
Anthony got all excited and decided it was his turn, and opened a card deck with pictures of famous magical sites from Neville, a pillowcase decorated in blue, bronze and ravens from Draco, a book of riddles from Hermione (Muggle ones, which Anthony delightedly thought were as hard as they were hilarious), a miniature figure of a troll who roared and waved his arms from Hal (which caused some delay as Anthony laughed so hard he cried) and homemade Rocky Road bars from Ron, magically preserved to last for months.
(both parts) from Hermione.
“Potentially, yeah.” Ron nodded. “So you go on. I’ll be fine.”
“People’s confusion is the least-”
He really did like the class. He had gotten decent grades throughout the year, mostly after Draco had spoken to his godfather, and probably even more after Hermione had told him she’d found out his mom had been really skilled at it.
“A camping trip with a hundred thousand other people.” Neville interrupted with a snort. “Pass.”
“Hermione.” He snipped back. “Whatever is in there, Quirrell made sure Dumbledore was away before he went after it, so he’s not meant to have it.”
“The creature!” Hal could barely contain his excitement. “I said – ‘Do they think I’ll set a snake on them or something’ – it makes sense!”
“How so?” Hal smiled, intrigued.
“Come on.” He hopped off the ledge. “Let’s get to bed. It has been a bloody long day.”
“Did you ever see actual lightning?” He tried not to sound too condescending. “If so, yeah, I suppose it does.”
After the third time of almost reaching for the diary, and forcing himself to remember his promises, he grabbed a quill and parchment and started a letter to his mother.
The Hat’s response seemed to be to club him over the head, and Hal ripped it off to massage his skull. He was surprised when instead of landing with a soft thud, it clattered loudly. Looking down, he saw the hilt of a sword sticking out of the worn leather.
He wouldn’t have thought much of it, if that had been the end of it. But similar occurrences seemed to keep happening from that point. Draco would find things not where he’d left them – and call him slightly compulsive, but he tended to be careful and know exactly where he left things – and he started feeling like there was gaps in his days where he couldn’t remember what he’d been doing.
“I will.” Hal promised.
“They all came by this morning?” Hal asked.
“Get well soon, Mister Potter.” He said instead – probably starting to see there wasn’t an opportunity for a long, insightful conversation here with Hal in this state. “I look forward to talking to you again soon.”
Naturally, Ley knew Hal much to well, and was no idiot, so he stopped his cousin before he could run away from the room and this awkward conversation.
This fic has grown another chapter oh my god. The last one just doesn't want to end so I had to split it again.
“Is it shaped like a lightning bolt?” Ron asked, clearly not able to control his excitement. You’d think he’d just been introduced to Santa.
“I know!” Ron repeated. “There’s no other way.”
“Who are these from?”
“Hal?” Ron poked his arm, seeing him frown. “What’s up, mate?”
“It doesn’t matter who or why, someone was messing with that broomstick, Harry.” She said sternly. “This is serious enough. And you should not be ignoring pain in your, may I remind you,
“You love it.” She dismissed. “So, did you get over the lovely and impressive Felix?”
“Oh, yeah, mom loves this.” Ron said, in a tone that revealed he absolutely loved it too.
“Was I telling you to go to the shops?”
He cleared his throat, heart sinking. He didn’t want to lie to him, even if there hadn’t been a high probability he would find out another way.
Ron was the one who jumped in to go over the pieces of the puzzle.
me, Hermione. I know you can see it too. You told me as much last year. Most brilliant wizard of his age and he wants to pretend he had no idea how to sort any of this mess? Come off it. Then I just
“Thank you, mate.”
“Thank you, Harry, that’s… Thank you.” He said. “Let me quickly find Molly to let her know she doesn’t need to buy them.”
“It was.” Neville shrugged. “Well. To be honest, it did come as a surprise so I guess it took some getting used to. It got easier.”
She ruffled his hair, reading him perfectly. “Don’t you worry about it.” She smiled.
When the witch had led them into a (surprisingly cosy) waiting room and left them there with the promise of coming back with tea, Hal stood back a little as he let the Malfoys greet Snape. After a few minutes, however, to his surprise, the professor turned and addressed him directly.
“Birch bark.” Hal brandished the large flat pieces of wood, looking pleased. “It's just what we were missing to do that waterproofing potion from my kit!”
“What?” Hal breathed, increasingly confused.
, and he’s not bothered Draco since. So.” His lips set in a determined pout, daring her to argue with that.
“You’re all weirdos.” Ron sighed fondly.
He let go off his little sister’s hand and ran right into the rain to meet him underneath the tree.
He froze when he suddenly remembered what she had said.
Draco didn’t let that unsettle him for too long, as they climbed into the boats taking them across the lake. Somehow the four of them sat together, without even thinking about it, and Draco thought,
“I’m okay.” Hal clearly lied.
“Right, well, Sirius, I think I know as well.”
on me, even more than before, it’s just annoying. I’m just a bloke weird shit happens to.” He shrugged. “I think I just want to be home, at this point. I’m not looking forward to Lockhart’s trial.”
“To you?” Hal picked up, the pieces starting to fall into place in his mind.
When Draco just pouted and looked down, she looked horrified.
“Yeah, I must admit, it was rather magnificent. Just wanted to check you didn’t see it as a sign that you two are soulmates and I wouldn’t have to have this argument with you?”
“Thank you.” She said.
“We should have asked if I could sleep over.” Hal said with a pout at the end of the day, hating that it was over, as he got ready to use the Portkey again.
“Oh.” He blinked. No wonder he felt more rested than the few hours he thought he’d slept. “I’m sorry.” He felt like he needed to add.
Draco still didn’t understand why Pan was so intent on getting him to confess his feelings to Hal, but he had to admit, this actually was proper motivation if there was any. He needed to beat Hal. He could beat Hal.
“Cover me.” He urged. “Be creative.”
Hal laughed. “Hermione Granger.” He said in the breathless bewilderment they all felt. “That was fantastic. I never knew you could like through your teeth with such a straight face.”
“I’ve heard that one before.” She replied with a smile in her voice. “How’s your head now?”
“ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!” Lee Jordan was yelling into the amplifier.
Hal had realised he had a tendency to do that when conversation took a turn towards a sensitive topic. Such as fame, or dead relatives. Part of him wanted to say he didn’t rescuing, but part of him (a stronger part, apparently) appreciated it.
. “Do you think your opponent in a duel would ask you kindly what spells you’d like to use? When I was in Romania…”
“He’s the best.” Hal nodded. “Honestly, it was so weird being here last year as well. My aunt didn’t react like that at all.” He laughed. He looked over at Ley at the other side of the table, smiling to himself. “He always seems to know exactly what I need.”
“Me?” Hal frowned. “Why?”
Sat in a quiet corner, they talked about how Hal’s magic was decidedly powerful, having been told the account of how Hal had escaped and finding it rather amazing he could still perform ‘accidental’ magic at his age, wondering exactly when this stopped being considered something children naturally did and became an impressive and unusual skill to have.
A boy Draco recognised with a jerk of horror, even with the lack of excessive facial hair and 50 years younger. Hagrid. The maybe not-so-gentle giant. Who even as Tom, in the memory, caught him red handed with his dangerous creature, continued to argue that the thing was harmless, and it was not its fault.
The tip of Ron’s ears went bright red, and he pulled self-consciously on his obviously hand-knit Christmas jumper, featuring what looked like a whole Quidditch team wearing cheerful seasonal red and green outfits, except that due to the lack of room of the garment, they looked a little bit like house-elves with growth impairments, possibly missing a limb here and there.
“Oh!” She startled, and then relaxed and smiled when she saw it was him. “Oh hey. Did you finish Snape’s essay about Boomslang skin?”
Draco grimaced. “I think I’ve met her once.” He said. “So I really, really don’t want to know either way.”
Ron shrugged with a grin. “Still feels nice.”
“Tell me.” His aunt encouraged him.
“Don’t sweat it.” Anthony patted his arm. “Let it happen. Or not happen.”
“What’s wrong.” He asked in a demanding tone.
The phoenix chirped after him as Hal left the room, and at least that made him smile.
In the next moment, there was no longer a rat, but a ratty-looking man crouching there. Hal and McGonagall both gasped, while Dumbledore didn't miss a beat and cast a body-bind on him. He looked furious, Hal noticed.
Casting the strongest feather-light and shrinking charms he could manage on the luggage, knowing he would likely no longer be in a Permission circle for underage magic by the time they needed renewing, Pan fitted everything in a single shoulder bag, and left without looking back.
He didn’t know why he took it personally still – Draco hadn’t told any of them. Even Anthony, and they shared a room, for Merlin’s sake. Unless Anthony knew, in which case Hal would need to have words.
The comment only cemented his conviction that Dumbledore had been wise to how things would potentially turn out, that him going after Quirrell and coming face to face with Voldemort had been part of some kind of plan.
“If Mister Longbottom isn’t able to-”
“He must be with someone.” Hal seized the chance for a polite way out, even though he thought the dog looked rather like a stray. “We shouldn’t-”
“No.” Lupin admitted nervously. “Boggarts do retain some of the abilities of the form they adopt, so a Dementor would still have affected you, and everyone else. If you still would like to have a go…”
He really would have to take a moment, at some point, to ask himself why exactly he was so defensive of Hal as a person, more so than for the rest of his friends. But in response, Hermione’s eyes widened.
“It’s not for another hour.” Draco started, but Anthony put a hand on his wrist and shook his head.
“And finally.” The room fell almost silent again. “For wanting to ensure the safety of others by preventing a potential disaster before it happened, and for his courage in facing a frightful enemy…” Hal held his breath as the old man paused for effect, and looked straight at him as he finished. “One hundred points to Harry Potter.”
“But he didn’t.” Dumbledore said, infuriatingly calm.
The same thing happened again, and Draco found himself holding his breath as he waited for the response to appear.
“Hal reacts badly.” Anthony envisaged. “He thinks it’s terrible, and he doesn’t want to be his friend anymore. And out whole group collapses because we’ll have to pick sides.”
Hal startled. “Scabbers?” He surmised, gobsmacked. “You’re saying Ron’s rat is someone called Peter Pettigrew?”
They went to bed with big happy grins and very, very full stomachs.
“My fame as a Pygmy Sorcerer?” Hal mocked.
“And why would I-” Hal started.
He looked up, trying to remember which way he’d come through the blurry streets, but it hadn’t been a very long way – he hoped he could retrace his steps.
Hal just shrugged, and ran back out to play with Ley and the dog. As soon as he joined them, the dog crowded back to him, and as Petunia watched them play, she noticed he stuck to Hal a lot more than he did Ley. She had noticed the same trend with Little Silver, and thought it was mostly because Hal took the cat to school and it was more familiar with his presence than with Ley’s and hers, but maybe Hal was also just good with animals. He had mentioned picking
“Don’t you dare TOUCH HIM, you disgusting scum! Murderer!” She screamed again as she launched herself at Sirius, fingers outstretched like she fully intended to claw his eyes out.
“Hermione is right.” He said when Hal had left the library. “Yeah, I heard everything you said.” He added with a look at their worried looks. “I don’t think Hal did. But, yeah, he’s got to figure that one out on his own. Give him some space.”
They had also found some powder residue of a Sleeping Draught – instant and highly potent in that formulation, and therefore dangerous and under tightly restricted use – which she must have used on Hal.
The other boy had continued advancing, and only stopped in front of a sink, like a video game character who’s clearly not programmed to know they can’t walk through solid matter.
Only once he’d walked to the local Floo and Portkey Station did he realise he had no idea where to go. When vaguely thinking about the very real possibility he’d be kicked out from home after having that talk with his parents (he’d avoided thinking long and hard about it, which maybe was turning out to be a mistake), he’d thought he could go to Malfoy Manor, but the Malfoys were in France right now.
“Harry!” Lockhart spread his arms, and for a horrible moment Hal thought he was going to hug him, but he simply put his hands on his hips, looking like a cliché superhero, complete with the blue cape floating behind him, the great hair and the brilliant smile.
Hagrid mumbled something unintelligible, and seeing the expectant look still on their faces, repeated it only slightly more understandably.
“I won’t change my mind.” Pan said fiercely. “Especially not in the event some tw- some idiots can’t be open-minded enough to accept this is who I am.”
for trouble, auntie.”
The five of them had lunch, a more casual affair than Draco had ever seen in the presence of guests; a cold spread was already on the table for everyone to help themselves to what they wanted, and the elves remained out of sight, which was unheard of in his experience – Narcissa would usually consider it a show of respect to her guests for them to be waited upon. But he could see how she’d assumed it might not go down as well with Muggles. He repressed a chuckle when he remembered how startled Hal had been by Dobby, the previous summer.
“Oh no.” Hermione whispered. “That’s Moaning Myrtle, don’t go near her.”
“I’m fine.” Draco pre-empted before any question came. “I just didn’t sleep well, it’s got nothing to do with… I’m fine.”
“Are we
They both turned, and saw a short, furious-looking woman marching towards them.
“Wait, you’re serious?” Anthony stepped in. “A professor? Why would a professor want to harm Harry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
But she chuckled, apparently appreciating the pun. “I see. Well, Hal, let’s get on this train then, shall we?”
been burned – Hal saw blisters already forming on his hands, and the same thing happened when the man put a hand on him again, trying to go for his pockets.
“He’s always a bit cosy with this other guy on the team.” Hal explained. “I think it’s only because he knows Oliver likes him, but it doesn’t seem to bother him either, so I was just wondering.”
Now he had to laugh. Whatever the odds were, whoever won, he very much doubted it would get Pan an amount that would make a difference to Draco. It wasn’t like he wanted for anything.
“Who did confirm he was prejudiced against me, go on.” Hal slipped in.
“Didn’t you hear me?” Hal frowned. “I told it to back off and go back to his friends.”
“Or me?” Nils challenged.
Hal frowned. “Why?”
“You have, when you were very little, at a dinner or other.” Petunia said. “Patrick was flattered, but not really very interested in you. We lost touch after your father’s death.” She ruffled her son’s hair. “It’s not a big loss, I promise.”
He grabbed the broom, and flew right up to where Draco had spotted the key. His Seeker instincts kicking in, he kept his eyes on it even as it zipped left and right, and it didn’t take him much time till he was closing his hand around it.
Hal raised an eyebrow. “Did I ever speak to a snake before?”
“He’s a professor.” Hal looked spooked at the idea. “I can’t go off asking him personal questions like that.”
“One of our house-elves.” Draco said like it was obvious.
“How do you-”
“You know what...” Hal didn’t hear all of what Mrs Weasley was saying, her voice barely more than a whisper now.
That evening, Draco paid a visit to Severus.
pledged to keep him safe after all, and while the brat looked every bit like James Bloody Potter, he also very much had Lily’s eyes, and he was more like her than Severus originally had assumed or suspected. And, and he supposed that counted for something, he was Draco’s friend.
3. I always thought it was awfully plot-convenient that Hermione had the paper about the Basilisk in her hand with “pipes” written on it when she gets petrified. I mean, 1) why would she rip out a page and write on it if she was on her way to meet her friends and tell them, and 2) I don’t think Hermione would go and damage a book like that! Anyway, I made them work for it a little bit more ;) Hermione might be the brightest witch of her generation, but she’s not the only smart one, and they’ve got Ravenclaws in their ranks!
She realised she remembered a lot more than she’d thought, from Lily’s excited retelling of her first year at school, twenty years ago, even if she had told herself back then that she wasn’t listening to a word of this nonsense.
“By which you mean Fred and George.” Ron commented. “Who are hardly reliable sources.”
The Hat said.
Hal gave him a tentative smile, and a little nod. Then he let out a big sigh, like a weight had just been lifted off his shoulders, and took out his wand.
“No!” Hal cried, because he hadn’t done anything wrong, damn it. “I didn’t even- I didn’t realise I just spoke snake!”
Hal laughed – it hurt like hell too. “You’re smart.” He complimented his friend.
“Oh, I was looking.” Draco admitted. “He’s hot. And fit.”
“Is that the Chamber? Draco?” He called again as Draco did not answer. “DRACO!”
“Yeah, run to mommy.” The boy spat meaninglessly, rubbing his elbow where it had banged against the solid frame.
“Your reading skills saved the school, girl.” Pan retorted. “These idiots wouldn’t have put two and two together without you.” He jerked her chin towards the others who only made vague noises of protest. It was true after all. “They should have given
Spending an entire afternoon with other Pureblood children while their parents where having a garden party had never been Draco’s idea of a good time, even in previous years; they were always just hanging together, half bored and half looking for trouble, and each time Draco thought he’d rather be in the library, left alone to curl up with a book. But now that they were also all
Rolf had a wry smile. “Hard to forget.”
The officer immediately looked alarmed, and started telling his colleague to call for backup and the paramedic still hovering around Hal to prepare an intervention bag, at which point Hal shook his head.
to figure out the current mystery?” Anthony raised, more importantly.
“Hal, Anthony, Ron and Hermione.” Draco said. “And Rolf, with the dog. Neville’s gone to get Mc- Professor McGonagall.”
She gave him a long, calculating look, and Hal realised he still had one hand holding his head – covering his scar, where the pain had lingered. He dropped it hastily, but the damage was already done.
It had started late afternoon, when Ley had complained of a tummy ache, but then he’d just eaten
“Look, if this is about earlier…”
“They’ve had-” Ron started.
The excitement and wonder of being new to the team had faded – both for Hal and the rest of them. It had boosted their morale for sure, especially when Hal had returned with his Nimbus 2000 after Christmas.
“Sounds like a plan.”
“She haunts a cubicle in the girl’s bathroom.” Hermione explained (“Glamorous.” Ron commented, which she ignored). “And she is… well, there’s a reason why she got that nickname. It is extremely uncomfortable when she starts crying.”
“How touching.” Spoke a voice behind him.
(and then had to explain it was a series of books, and nothing personal), Neville a box of cauldron cakes and Draco a family tree in a cool typeset showing how they were related, to Ron’s great horror (third cousins, once removed).
“A goat.” Hal repeated carefully.
“Oh, please.” She looked mildly horrified. “Call me Lana. Gabriel was a Ravenclaw himself, just like our Anthony. I’m glad the House rivalries seem to be less intense than they were when he first told me about all of this!”
“But you can.” He said more gently. “If that’s what you want, you can, when you grow up.”
“No, I bet.” Ron shuffled, then clapped him on the back. “Anyway, I’ll let you get back. See you after.”
Seeing the headmaster’s raised brow – though he almost looked amused – Hal cleared his throat, slightly embarrassed by his outburst.
Hal looked up, to the previously asleep man – Lupin – handing him a large chunk of chocolate. Reaching for it in a trembling hand and looking around, he saw that all his friends had a piece. They looked pale and shaken, though none of them was on the floor. Hal struggled to his feet, enough to drop himself back onto a seat.
Hermione simply pursed her lips, looking put out, and ignored Draco entirely to snap at Hal.
Draco smiled, and beckoned Hal to follow him.
“And my cousin.” The other boy smiled. “But really, he’s like my twin. We’re born a month apart and we always did everything together.”
And that had been the end of that. She did understand – her parents would always worry about her. And she wasn’t naive, she knew that even if Sirius had been a good man when she’d met him when she was eight, twelve years in Azkaban could change a person. But she remained convinced; she’d might have been a child then, but she’d seen him interact with James, they were best friends, they were
Neville dragged a bag to his lap and started pulling out small parcels.
“Next year might be me.” Draco suddenly said next to him.
“We’re going to France with the Malfoys.”
Hal briefly wondered how the magical society
“Okay, we both go, we can cover each other’s back. Sorry, mate.” He added, turning to Ron. “But if we want to stay under the cloak...”
“He just always has that face like he stepped in something gooey.” Anthony added.
Turning to Anthony, he could see on his face they thought the same thing.
Since she’d been there, she had kept exchanging looks with Draco, opening her mouth and them seemingly deciding otherwise. They all turned to her, and even Hal raised his head from within his folded arms and looked at her expectantly.
This particular time, a pair of girls, about their age, started whispering excitedly. Draco could see Hal tense, and consciously
“Right.” Draco let that one slide. “So, why should he be?”
“If anyone would, it would be Dumbledore.” She argued back.
“Leave it, alright?” He implored. “And don’t tell Hal and the others, please? It’s not a big deal.”
“Ah, ah, now.” She said, still kindly, though there was something in her eyes Hal didn’t like the look of. “It’s a bad, bad world out there, Harry.”
“Peter Pettigrew.” He stated, his voice a storm.
“What I meant is it was more like an assassination than casualties of battle. If it hadn’t blown back in the other side’s face there and then, there would have been retaliation and escalation again.”
The dog’s stance immediately changed, as he turned to Hal happily, wagging his tail and smiling one of those toothy dog smiles. Hal let out a laugh, and patted the dog’s head.
“You’re not the boss of me.” Millie lifted her chin, deciding to be defiant.
“Did you get a bollocking?” Ron asked, already wincing.
“Severus, what have you been teaching them?” Lockhart said contritely, turning to Snape, who admirably kept his face neutral and did nothing in way of murdering his colleague. “You don’t discuss a duel! You act!”
“First one in your family to go to Hogwarts then?” Draco asked, once he figured this would probably be the least judgmental way of finding out. It had taken him years of unlearning his father’s ways to stop looking down on Muggleborns. He was getting better at it.
Anthony shrugged. “Pan has made it clear. Then they naturally assume Draco and I are at least open-minded about it.”
“This is Nils.” He told Draco.
“It fits.” Hermione glared at him.
He decided there would be no point in mentioning this little incident to anyone. It could have been worse, in the end, not much had happened. Draco didn’t even see why Flint should care that Hal was Gryffindor’s new Seeker – Slytherin had already played them and won, it wasn’t like he posed a threat.
“Oh, hey Hal.” He greeted him with a smile.
“I mean, if you do more of them, of course.” Hal added a bit more sheepishly, like he felt he was being pushy. “I’d like to have one of you.”
“Ugh.” Hal grimaced. “Please don’t call me that.”
“We all worry.” Hermione put a hand over his. “Don’t shut us out.”
“I wish I could.” Hal sighed. “But doing magic outside of school is forbidden until you’re seventeen.”
“No, Sil.” He whispered to the kitten. “Want to try your new bed, buddy?”
“Halley’s comet.” Hal explained. “Cause he’s called Ley. Well, Dudley. So people called us Halley. Like the comet.”
“Oh, Harry, no, I can’t accept that.” Ron’s dad protested, but Hal pressed on.
He put the whole thing out of his mind as they carried on playing, but it came back to him on the way home, as he was trying his very best not to doze off on the train – the day had been amazing, but thoroughly exhausting.
She’d want to assess him, Hal thought with a smile. If he was going to be in her nephew’s life, she’d want to make sure he was good for him, safe to be around. She was rather protective that way.
“Great.” Ron nodded. “But, hum, I mean obviously it’s not
“Was that the Malfoy kid?” He asked.
Petunia had reached the conclusion over the years that there was a very strong chance Harry was as magical as his parents had been. All sorts of odd little things happening around him pointed to it, and reminded her of Lily at the same age. She tried to nurture the boy without encouraging it – she was making amends for rejecting her sister and calling her a freak when she should have been there for her, venturing into a whole new scary world, but as far as she was concerned, until confirmed otherwise, Harry was part of
Hermione flushed slightly, like she still did every time her outstanding reasoning in figuring out the Basilisk and Chamber of Secrets was mentioned.
“I just thought it meant it’s magic, I don’t know.”
“A present?” Draco’s eyes widened.
“I- what?” Hal stared back at him uncomprehendingly.
“Not too bad, I think. You?”
Hal thought everyone else would still be at the feast, but when he reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, there was someone standing there. He’d probably just gotten there, seeing as she was sleeping, a three-quarter eaten box of pumpkin-shaped chocolates on her lap – Hal wondered why portraits went through the motions like that. Surely they couldn’t really eat anything, nor did they have any need to sleep.
Hal patted his shoulder encouragingly – he still wasn’t sure if he wanted to play against Draco, or avoid it at all costs, but he was content with not having to find out for now – and sprung off the bench, colliding with two Hufflepuffs who were coming down the aisle between their tables.
“I can’t say I’m pleased to see you back here, Mister Potter.” Pomfrey told him, her tone not quite managing to be scolding. “But I am glad to see you awake. Can you tell me what happened, so I can give you the best possible treatment?”
“Peter Pettigrew is alive, he’s an Animagus and he’s been hiding as a rat this whole time?” She summarised.
“Oh, sorry.”
“I don’t know, man.” Hal shook his head helplessly. “This is weird for me too.”
“I promised I’d let him try my broom first chance we got.” Hal explained. “But we can’t exactly do that in our neighbourhood.”
Without a word, Neville got up, made a beeline for him, grabbed his arm, pulled him up, and walked him out of the room. Hal let himself be led until they were in the bathroom, sat on the large windowsill bathed in moonlight. Neville made him put his hands flat against the stone.
“I actually think more people should show an interest.” Hal said. “Magic is
“I believe.” McGonagall commented next. “You have all been incredibly lucky. But for your quick thinking in finding a way to call for assistance, Mister Malfoy, I will award fifteen points to Ravenclaw. For protecting your friends, Mister Potter, fifteen points to Gryffindor. And for your reckless bravery, Mister Goldstein, another fifteen points to Ravenclaw. Now, please go back to your common rooms. Quickly now, off you go.”
