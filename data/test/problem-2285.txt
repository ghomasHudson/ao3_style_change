Harry was all too familiar with Malfoy’s sneering at him and the like, but this felt leagues off from that. Harry internally squirmed, complicated emotions creeping through him as he worked not to shrink away, and he didn’t know why.
But Hermione didn’t get the chance to explain, because just then there was the sound of impact and a splash from behind her. She turned to see Harry, standing in the doorway, a spilled coffee cup at his feet and eyes fixed on Draco.
It was more than the tone of Weasley’s voice that made Draco look at him. They’d both been listening to one of Hermione’s oddly humourous stories about dentists, and it was unlike Weasley to interrupt the Gryffindor girl when she chose to eat with them. When Draco did look at the freckled boy, however, his eyes were not fixed on the blond but rather to their right. Ah, Draco noticed, the owls.
“So... this was all for nothing then,” Not Harry said after a moment. “I mean, one of us grabs this cup and the task’s over. Unless You Know Who is planning to attack in front of the entire audience, I think old Dumbledore was having Scrimgeour on.”
“Gods,” said Draco with a shake of his head. “You just really make me want to kiss you. To just… give in and fall in love with you again.”
Draco’d never seen a trained Auror in any kind of real action, and watching Not Fleur fire off spells and solve riddles—with someone else’s wand, no less—likely would have been incredible under different circumstances. As it happened, though, they were both far too reactant to every stray noise to glean any sort of enjoyment from it.
Harry suddenly recalled that Malfoy’d had Muggle Studies on his schedule at the start of term, remembered wondering why. “Yes.”
had someone consistently assigned to Neville. Harry had been that someone at several points, which Harry was now aware had rankled Harim a bit—though not near enough to quit like Harry had up and done.
Draco sighed and rolled over to look at his barely-at-the-moment friend. "Oh please, you're like seven percent Veela if I'm being generous, creature of the night my arse."
Alright so, on another note, I’m potentially looking for another beta reader. It’s nothing dire, I promise, but I’m considering it for just a few reasons.
spoke a foreign language, but he hadn’t even consciously thought those words before they’d just come out of his mouth. That was significantly more alarming.
“You’re unbelievable,” Draco informed him. “I’m not cross with you, you git. I love you. I’m worried about you.”
It was thanks to Myrtle that Harry finally got the egg's clue that night. Not that it made much sense at all. Despite the late hour, he planned to head straight to the Slytherin common room to see Draco about it. Harry slept there half the time anyway. He double checked the Marauder’s Map to be sure the coast was clear, secure in the knowledge that Filch and Mrs. Norris were in their office. The only dot that seemed to be moving was Peeves. He was just about to close the Map when he noticed something odd: a single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner– Snape’s office. But the dot wasn’t labeled “Severus Snape”... it was Bartemius Crouch.
Sooo I was nervous about this one, because it was a little brutal, so let me know your thoughts! It’s good to be back.
“You have no idea,” responded Harry. “Now look. I want to make it clear that I’m not trying to threaten you. I’m not going to do anything and I won’t tell anyone, I swear. I’m just here to warn you.”
“Be distracted later,” Joshua replied. “You might get away with slacking on the first day, but Hanson doesn’t make this subject easy.”
Hermione rolled her eyes then. "No Ron. Harry knows what he's doing, perhaps for the first time in his life. Once I figured it out, everything fell into place. You can't honestly tell me you don't see it."
Neville sat down next to her. “I’m actually here to, um, see my parents. But I told Blaise I’d stop in while I was here, see if there was news.”
"Don't—" he started, but the girl was already reading. Draco sighed, cold already settled over him, and watched her eyes dart across the page and read the words it'd only taken him twice to memorise.
This chapter is also another strictly-memory chapter, if you haven’t guessed. Bet some of you guys thought we were done were those.
She seemed to have gotten temporarily lost in her offensive ranting, but then she shook it off. She blew out another annoyed breath. “Fine. Just stay close to me and try not to get killed, will you? I’m probably already going to be demoted as it is.”
Malfoy held his gaze for a prolonged moment before finally taking a deep breath. “Look, Potter, I need–” he stopped, cleared his throat. “I’ll need you to give me a bit of… time.”
Severus looked on silently, preparing for the fallout if he were to have to step in on the boy's behalf. If Lucius raised his hand or his wand, Severus would have no choice.
A hand touched his chin, lifting Harry’s eyes back up. Poignant grey eyes bored into his while Harry held his breath.
probably the correct assessment of Harry at that moment. It couldn’t have been more clear that he’d been a shite friend, and a selfish arsehole to top it off.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He still hadn’t quite got the hang of apologising for things he hadn’t even done. When he failed to say anything, as was becoming the usual, she went on. “Look. I get on your case, yeah. But that doesn’t mean I don’t
Harry kept walking, but the gesture made him feel about a million times better, as was clearly the intent. His grin returned in full force. Draco smiled back at him, fondly exasperated.
“Who pissed in your cheerios?” Joshua wondered from beside him a while later. They’d sat next to each other for History of Magic, and Harry, as per his track record, wasn’t retaining a word of the lecture. Except, this time, he couldn’t blame the professor. The man at the front of the room was not only very much alive, but enthusiastic. His voice was strong and clear. Harry’s mind just couldn’t be bothered to care. He wasn’t used to being a helpless bystander; he was used to being the one to take on the problem. But this wasn’t Hogwarts, and it wasn’t Voldemort behind it all.
But Draco had turned away from him, allowing long moments to stretch on before he spoke again. “I need some time with this,” he said, his voice now flat, detached.
They both seemed to notice at the same time, breaking apart in the next moment. Draco’s face was flushed Harry’s favourite sort of pink, the pupils still blown and grey retreated to the outer ring. Harry knew he was in virtually the same state, half-hard cock and all. Apparently neither of them knew what to say. Draco ran a hand through his hair and gripped a bit before releasing it. Harry had had plenty of time to note it as a habit of frustration or nervousness.
Harry rolled his eyes then. "No one is dying, and certainly not me. Which reminds me, I'm to take the egg to the bath tonight."
Until Neville loudly cleared his throat, that was, breaking Harry from his unintended stupor. He blinked, snapping his gaze back to Neville to see the man’s brows raised, a small smirk playing on his lips.
“Perhaps you could have extra Aurors on hand, watching for anything that may happen,” suggested Draco’s mum. “Tell the audience they’re for the Champion’s security. When the Dark Lord does somehow attack, they could intervene.”
“Well,” Lavender said brightly, gifting him the opportunity to move away from his melancholy, “at least since you’ve someone else to be your faux-therapist now, I don’t have to anymore. So let’s talk about what else you’ve been doing. Catch me up.”
“He’s right, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said. “These will be professionals, trained to take on dark wizards. We are trying to keep you safe.”
"No," Blaise said, mildly annoyed that he wouldn’t be allowed to complete his game. "We don't think that. But that doesn't mean you can start assigning blame whenever Potter hurts your feelings."
“There’s this voice in the back of my head,” he finally continued. “It gets louder every time I wake up in a cold sweat alone, and it keeps saying that this is what you really mean. I’m
Midway through the week, though, Draco finally noticed that there was something else to be concerned about: Theo was avoiding him. At first he thought he was imagining things. Theo still hung around the Slytherin common room at night as he always did; still spoke to all his friends as though everything was fine. But whenever Draco would enter the library, or sit down in the Hall to eat, or get anywhere close to Theo, the other boy would get up silently and go find other things to do.
It spiraled jaggedly around his wrist, the width of a wire, and upwards, wrapping again and again around his arm until it disappeared into his sleeve at the crease of his elbow.
The past few days, the current news had been all about the Death Eater trials. They were a formality, as all but Lucius—and, of course, Snape—would undoubtedly spend the remainder of their days in Azkaban.
Lavender’s expression shifted into one of offense. “Hey. That kind of sounds like you’re judging, like, everyone at work, including me. Suddenly you have a problem with telling the truth?”
"I'm only curious," began Malfoy. "What with every ghastly looking witch in the castle clawing each other's eyes out over the idea of themselves on the future Champion's arm, how it is you still seem to be without someone to escort to the Ball."
Harry blinked, then, once the question had registered, yanked his arm away, anger and embarrassment returned full force.
Pansy's eyes once again narrowed dangerously, practically daring Draco to insult the Ravenclaw again. "She's genuine and sweet. And she accepted rather happily, thank you very much.”
And Draco blissfully lost count until, "Bloody hell, why must I always be the one to witness your every ridiculously sappy act?" Blaise's voice rang through the dorm room. "I am a gods-damned creature of the night!"
The Healers had told Hermione over and over again that Draco couldn’t actually hear anything anyone said to him while comatose. Talking to him had just become sort of therapeutic. If he could really hear her now, it had to mean he was waking up.
This didn’t make any sense, he thought. He hadn’t been able to hear from his mum in ages—not even for his birthday.
Harry shrugged, and gave him a half smile. "Something more important than sleep came up." He made his way over to Draco's bed and sat at the foot of it. His boyfriend's arm was thrown over his stomach, white-blond hair spilled on his sheets. He looked so peaceful, Harry suddenly wasn't in a rush to get him up. He loved seeing Draco's expression so open and relaxed, and all his problems would still be there in the morning after all. Before he'd even realised it, he'd reached out his hand and stroked through Draco's locks.
“Are you grand-gesturing me right now?” Draco asked finally, over the music. “Is that what this actually is?”
For a moment, all he could see was a sixteen year old boy. One that was crying. Anxious. Terribly afraid and turning to lash out with the brand of astounding violence he’d been raised on.
“You didn’t care to know. You wanted to erase me and take over my life, so you could allow yourself to blissfully forget your own as well. But I don’t care how dreadful it was; it doesn’t excuse you, not by half. Not when I—”
He only realised what he'd said a moment later when everyone in the vicinity froze and turned to stare at the two of them.
Sheila was different, though. Even though the most they ever did was talk, Harry hadn’t had much reason to deliberately omit anything before now. He’d become used to saying whatever was on his mind, and it was odd not to do so.
It was very difficult not to panic, but he knew Draco would want him to keep his head. He tried not to pay mind to the merpeople around him, or what they might do when his time was truly up. Still, he kicked and swam despite his burning lungs and exhausted limbs. Just when he thought he might black out, his head at last broke the surface.
“Harry Potter!” called the second voice. “You are miles from protection and have nowhere to run, come out and surrender painlessly.”
Neville just shook his head. “I’m just the lead singer of that one okayish band,” he corrected tonelessly. “Blaise was right.”
Harry’s expression morphed from amusement to concern in the space of a blink. “Hey, I didn’t mean to scare you. Is something wrong?”
When Draco and Harry went back to Hogwarts that Monday, the school went into upheaval. Absolutely everyone was all over the both of them. Draco was constantly torn between being touched at the widespread concern and annoyed at the constant attention. He’d even caught nearly all of his Professors staring at him during their lectures. It was somewhat irritating, given that he already had two weeks of coursework to worrying about catching up on.
When a team of blue-clad boys and girls walked onto the field, Harry learned his brother was a Ravenclaw.
Joshua sniffed dramatically, completely dry eyed. “That was beautiful, you guys,” he proclaimed obnoxiously.
Stunned, Draco nodded. It was just then that the date occurred to him; the task was tomorrow. He needed to see Dumbledore immediately.
He seemed to drag in a broken breath that sent something that felt like razor blades cutting into Harry’s chest. He didn’t move though, not until Draco suddenly looked up and shouted, “Go!”
Harry allowed Malfoy to lead him silently for a few minutes before he decided to try speaking again. "So you really erm..."
Disbelief coursing through him, he turned towards where he thought he’d seen blond and was met with the sight of none other than Draco Lucius Malfoy. He was hovering over someone on the ground, but he looked up when he felt Harry’s gaze.
“Everything,” said Harry. “If I had just listened to you. I mean, you wouldn’t have even been there if it wasn’t for me volunteering. You could have died because I had to go be a hero.”
“I know, Harry,” Draco promised. “And I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. I’m not pretending anymore that there would be anyone else for me. You don’t have anything to be afraid of in the meantime. All right?”
“Wish I could show you what you looked like just now,” he said, and Harry recognised that he was being teased.
Harry Potter was beginning to get a bit nervous. There was only a week left until Christmas, when, at this rate, he would have to show up to the Yule Ball dateless and utterly humiliated. Cho's rejection still stung more than he wanted to admit, especially since she was going with Cedric. The only consolation was that Ron had yet to find anyone to take either, but thinking that with any sort of relief only made Harry a poor excuse for a best mate.
Harry had only had to check three other places before he eventually found Neville at Lewis & Williams, a popular wizarding club for elites. In his timeline, Harry had been invited to patron on no less than fifteen separate occasions since the end of the war. But now, as a non-celebrity, the front staff only eyed him with calculation and informed him he was not allowed in. In response, Harry had handed over a ridiculous amount of galleons with a tight smile, for which they’d looked the other way while he’d slipped inside.
At that, Hermione glanced down. To her horror, she realised that she had been too distracted to stir properly. Worse, there wasn't time to even attempt fixing it. Not minutes later, she had no choice but to accept an embarrassingly low grade. Determined not to allow it to be a waste, she decided right then what she would do. She had to speak to Draco Malfoy—alone.
Harry glanced over at her fiancé—or was he her husband now?—to see him still looking altogether happy and bashful.
Narcissa Malfoy stood, unmoving, as she stared at her husband with blatant disgust. “Harry Potter will die,” she repeated, incredulous that Lucius then had the audacity to nod.
Harry stared. Red started creeping at the edge of his vision as he slowly took in Malfoy’s meaning. The blond didn’t actually know that the other Taken weren’t all muggleborns, he realised. Of course he’d be pleased. Merlin, how could Harry have forgotten who this boy was, even for a day? Anger flared hot in his chest.
“Erm,” he started. “I mean, we’ve had coffee, and I- I invited him and his friends out with Neville and I.”
“Oh no. You owe me an explanation for why I had to come into work to find out that not only did you not give Skeeter your ‘epic’ story, but now she’s hounding my arse and accusing us of slacking off for the whole month,” Lavender yelled. “And then I go in to see what exactly you think you’re doing, and you tell Neville Longbottom to never even speak to me?!”
Draco looked at him warmly. “I know,” he said simply. “Besides, he got what he deserved, if Aunt Bella’s graphic account of things is anything to go by.”
“And your dad knew that, by the way,” continued the Gryffindor, determined to have it all out on the table. “He knew that and he followed him anyway. Worshipped him. Threw his entire life and you, his family, away for him, didn’t he. Someone who, based on what you were just saying, was less than him. But he wasn’t, was he? Because magic doesn’t favour based on blood. Your magic isn’t stronger than mine because you’re a pureblood and I’m not, is it? You say we’re gods because we have magic, but then you pretend like it’s up to you or anyone else to decide who deserves their magic and who doesn’t.”
Harry nodded, doing his best to pay attention after that and allowing the thought that he’d soon be let outdoors to serve as encouragement. Professor Clark had said to meet near the Founders Statues, where she’d then be leading them into some adjacent woods on the grounds for the lesson. Harry wasn’t sure what sort of creature to expect, but he was looking forward to being beyond the castle walls nonetheless.
“You think she did something to me,” Harry breathed his understanding. “You think I treated you like I did… because she did something to me.”
Harry’s nightmares hadn’t been pleasant as of late. In fact, they happened more often than ever before. He cast silencing spells every night before sleeping just in case, so he never disturbed anyone with them at least. Still, he was starting to worry that he should be talking to someone about them—who knew if or when Draco would be up to listening again.
“Right, of course,” Hermione said briskly, and then shifted to more fully face the room. “Well, as Ginny has now so kindly brought me something else to attend to, I suppose I’ll just have to make the announcement so you can all get on going home as everyone clearly wants to.”
Draco ate a truly ungodly amount of food that night, and then—he was ashamed to realise the next morning that, given that he had just come out of a bloody coma that had had him in bed for
It must have been their surroundings that brought the random fact to Harry’s mind. “The first time I talked to a snake, we bonded over our mutual dislike of my cousin.”
Harry’s hands were stuffed into his pockets, chastised. “I meant that I’m sorry for taking advantage of your help and then not appreciating you as a friend,” he explained quietly, his eyes on Lavender’s carpet. “I’m sorry that I didn’t… that I kept myself at arms length and disregarded you when you were trying to be there for me all along. It’s not an excuse, but I want you to know that it wasn’t to do with you. Not truly. It was me. I’m still— it’s still hard for me to believe sometimes that this is my real life and not some sort of dream that I’ll wake from one of these days… and because of that it was hard to accept that it couldn't all just stay as simple as I ne-
Yourself and Harim have led vastly different lives, and have, therefore, remarkable differences. This is exacerbated in your current circumstances as you have thus far proven frankly unwilling to make sense of one another. The antagonism between you is what keeps you from merging as you should have long before now. To stress the point: you
you fucking git. You wanted me to care that you had a life?! I have done! You’re the one that doesn’t.”
Finally, Neville agreed. Pansy turned to them all as soon as he was gone. "Think he'll be able to do it?"
"Breathe Harry," Draco said, and a tension Harry hadn't realised had been in his shoulders seemed to relax a bit, even as his lungs still ached. There was a sniffle, the only sound to alert Harry that the little girl had also regained consciousness.
"A riddle, I'm good with riddles. What is it though?" He sounded quite relieved, and Harry was glad he hadn't waited until morning to come if it put Draco a bit more at ease. Still, he’d already decided that everything else could wait. All he really wanted right now was to lie down next to Draco.
Harry could taste blood in his mouth as he stared Malfoy down, satisfied to see red gushing from the other boy’s nose, bruises already forming on his pale face. Harry hardly noticed the ache around his own ribs, overwritten by adrenaline.
. He and the weasel would have a spectacular time laughing their arses off about it, I can practically see it now."
Sirius looked up from his food again at that. “What? Oh, of course! He’s still your boyfriend isn’t he? If you trust him then I don’t see why I shouldn’t.”
Hermione sat down next to Ron, who hardly breathed a word to her these days, and began working as if nothing was going on. Neville did the same, only he always looked nervous in Potions, so nothing with him would seem amiss. Blaise looked relaxed as ever. Harry breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth, giving nothing away as Snape began to explain today's potion. Harry hardly heard a word of it, and it wouldn't matter seeing as the entire goal this period was to brew the potion wrong and make the greatest mess possible.
"Is that so?" Harry asked, biting his lip a bit and leaning close to him. Draco knew it really wasn't on to kiss with a very literal, bated-breathed audience, and it was as though Harry read his mind in the last moment. He seemed to meet everyone's eyes at once. "You lot waiting for a show or?"
“Your entire argument is mucked up from the start even,” he barrelled on, “because purebloods are a part of the reason there are so few of us in the first place. Maybe muggles wouldn’t outnumber us by so much if half of us weren’t so set on keeping magic for themselves that they saw no issue with practices like inbreeding. And don’t bother denying it; I know you’ve not forgotten who my godfather is. So which is it, Malfoy?” he asked. “You hate muggles because they outnumber us, in which case you might think about not being so openly proud of your bloodline, to say the least. Re-evaluate some of those philosophies, I’d think. Or you hate them because they haven’t got any magic, meaning you hating muggleborns is nonsense.
Draco was doing his level best to appear serious, but the mischievous glint in his eyes ruined the effect. “Well, suppose you could go off with just whoever you chose,” he said, glancing at Blaise, “but you’d still have to contend with each other.”
“You keep saying had,” Neville pointed out after a long moment of silence. “You had. But you don’t anymore?”
right?” she went on venomously, relentless. “And there’s no reason at all you’ve not sought her out despite knowing how for ages. Why you’ve avoided all your supposedly wonderful friends. It’ll all work out splendidly—no Janus Thickey Ward in your future, certainly! You know what Harry? You’re right, I don’t give a damn. Get the hell out!”
That night, the two boys lay side by side in Draco's bed, scheming about what they would have to do to get the gillyweed from Snape, when the events of earlier returned to Draco's mind.
Voldemort had died again during the battle, Alyssa Cole—the Auror who’d been assigned to take Fleur’s place—had delivered the killing blow. She’d told
Blaise rolled his eyes. He couldn’t help it; how much more forward could a bloke be? “Actually, you should have said it a long time ago.”
Like how Bellatrix Black, at the ripe age of twenty nine, had ruthlessly terminated her betrothal contract to one Rodolphus Lestrange, by allegedly—and in this case
“This is what we’ve been working for Cissa,” he told her with horrible excitement. “The Dark Lord will return, and once he rises to power we will stand by his side. Our family name will once again command the respect we’ve been denied for years.”
Not bloody likely. You’re a fucking wanker. I have exhausted myself trying to make some semblance of a life out of your damnable mess!
“You woke up and you couldn’t do magic anymore,” Harry said, giving voice to it as he couldn’t believe it otherwise.
Harry laughed, but then he remembered what they'd been talking about. "Tell me why you said you were awful first."
“Hm. Not quite,” Harry replied and pulled Draco back down on top of him. Their lips met again and Draco decided that the world could wait just a bit longer.
Neville rolled his eyes, but then he got a serious look about him. “Heard about what happened with him the other night. Makes a bit more sense now why you might’ve had your change of heart. Don’t take it the wrong way, but it’s what made me feel better about trusting you.”
Neither her nor Remus looked convinced, but thankfully let it go. Harry sternly ordered himself to get it together. How many times was he going to do this?
Harry just rolled his eyes and nodded. They said their goodbyes after that and headed back to school, theorising about all they’d learned the whole way.
“No more than it’s always been,” he reminded her. “Believe me, it’s worth it. So long as you love him.”
“Because they—I appreciate what I have now. In a way that no one can understand,” Draco explained. “What I went through made me stronger. I can’t just let someone obliviate all of that away.”
Harim did not come off as much of a host, for one thing. And for another, there was very little wear and tear on the place. The hardwood floors retained their polish; the plush, centre rug was still the colour of fresh paper; the kitchen’s marble countertop displayed no cracks or scuffs. Dust had begun to collect where his books sat within the wall.
For several tense moments, the Slytherin only looked at them in confusion. Hermione saw the exact moment that the memory came to him. “Oh
He started to turn away, but Malfoy reached out and gripped Harry's arm. The strangest sensation snaked through him at the contact, and he froze in place.
"Panse," Draco hissed through his teeth. The Slytherin housemates closest to them were smirking or giggling.
Pyxis helped himself to Draco’s breakfast as the Slytherin tore it open. Vaguely he registered parting his lips in shock.
“Well it was the worst thing I ever went through, so yeah,” Draco told him bluntly. “But it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. They told me that’s why I didn’t die. And now I want to be grateful for that and get on with my life, be happy now, you know?”
“Salazar, listen to this,” said Draco from where he rested against Harry’s pillows, his voice horrified, “a spell to pull your innards out through the throat.”
It was the rude sound of someone clearing their throat that finally gave him the strength to pull away. He couldn't of even said how much time had gone by. His heart was pumping at a ridiculous rate, and he could feel sweat bead on his forehead. A glance at Draco revealed he was anything but the only one. But Draco wasn't looking at him, he was scowling at whoever had come upon them. Harry turned his head, and there stood Ron.
“But now she’s actually trying to endanger people!” Celine protested. “I just never thought it’d get this bad.”
Harry’s vision cleared as he fully came to, finding Lavender across from him—her eyes shone with unmistakable hurt. Harry realised with a wince that he must have said Hermione’s name aloud.
So while Harry filled Sheila in on the events of the past few days, he made sure to brush over anything that might lead in that direction. It proved easier than he’d expected, much to his relief. He had plenty of happenings with which to drown out the need for certain minor details.
“You guys gotta stop looking at me like that,” she admonished. “I might start thinking you’re homophobes or something… well okay, no I wouldn’t,” she amended, laughing for a reason Harry didn’t understand. “But yeah, I’m a lesbian, and proud of it too.”
expect you to tell me about Bella. Not right this very minute, because we’ve been in here for ages and people probably assume we are doing something inappropriate—” Harry felt all the blood rush to his face and neck at that, and Draco looked minorly derailed. “Merlin, what, are you shy now?”
Harry sighed heavily. “That I’m a wizard,” he ticked off. “That Voldemort killed my parents. That he tried to kill me and died instead. Which with the exception of the first I probably could have lived without knowing, so it may have been sort of a g–”
He struggled against the arms that held him away, but they only laughed at him. When Cedric suddenly appeared, a giant bubble around his head, Harry was immensely relieved.
stop short at the sight of Ophelia, but it was a near-thing. He had to work to cover how idiotic he immediately felt. There he was, waiting around for her to return from school before he could set anything in motion—not even considering where he might clearly find her before then. It wasn’t as though she was confined to her campus, after all.
"Malfoy," said Harry. His voice sounded strange to his own ears, and he noticed that Malfoy straightened a bit.
Matt rolled his eyes but reached out so his hand hovered by the cup. “On three then?” he asked, earning a nod from the others. “One… two… three.”
“I think I’m actually glad to know Quidditch is less popular here,” Malfoy told him when the whistle signaled the end of that session.
The first touch of his lips on Neville’s and the Gryffindor gasped. Next moment, they were kissing. Deeply. It was like this was oxygen and they’d both been deprived for an impossibly long time.
She blinked, as though just realising that he hadn’t known. “Ah, well. It’s not as shocking as all that, really. I am something of an oddball amongst my colleagues.”
"Goodnight, Hermione." He left the library still feeling chilled and more than a bit out of sorts, the ridiculous letter crumpled in his fist.
“Have a seat,” the man said instead. Both boys immediately did so, eyes wary. Dumbledore was very powerful, but Harry could admit he’d never been all that much of a disciplinarian. This Headmaster was a wild card, an unknown. It made it impossible to relax, even sitting.
The majority, if not every student in the room besides Harry himself, likely already knew everything that Hanson said. If there was ever a day for messing around, this was it. But no one did, completely immersed in the ‘lesson,’ which was really just sports discussion disguised as work. Not that Harry was complaining. He was actually fascinated, learning about how a faulty Quaffle could have given birth to an entire game all its own. The rules seemed fairly straightforward, all essentially boiling down to: score a point and don’t let anything explode in your face. He came out thinking that he might actually have fancied playing, if his heart didn’t already belong to Quidditch.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh please. He's the bloody Saviour. He could find a date the day of in the space of time it takes him to walk from his dormitories to the Great Hall."
A nod, and the uncomfortable moment passed, a silent decision having been put to rest. "Right then. Truth or Dare?"
Some might be on good terms with Harry, like Daphne or Dean, but Draco surely wanted to spend his birthday with a greater number of people. And it wasn’t like he could roll out the welcome mat for an entire party, if that was what Draco had wanted. Harry didn’t even know if Draco still considered
“But what if that never happens?!” Harry burst out. “I–I still don’t know… Harim’s not—! I mean… you shouldn’t be waiting for something that I don’t….”
Even when it was laid out for him, point blank, by the only person that could possibly be called a professional in this, he’d swept it under the rug. Had refused, with the sheer power of the subconscious, to even question
Just being up in the sky was breathtaking, and Harry basked in the glory of it as he watched the Slytherin score again and again. It was warm and mildly humid out, the fast air whipping against his face a cool relief, negating the sweat gathering on his forehead. By the time they landed, Harry was exhausted in the best of ways.
Then, after several tracks had gone by, the music paused for slightly too long of a moment. People looked about themselves in confusion, but then relaxed at the sound of Neville’s voice.
“I want to talk to you,” said Harry, not waiting for a response before he re-secured the curtains behind him and sat at the foot of Malfoy’s bed, legs crossed beneath him. A hawthorn wand lay pressed against the blond’s cotton joggers. He sat leaning against his forest green pillow that actually blended quite nicely with the teal sheets, an odd little notebook in his lap. His hair was still damp, making Harry think he must have come from the showers just before the Gryffindor returned to the dorm earlier. The white-blond locks curled slightly as they dried.
The office itself was understated, the entrance to which hadn’t even been hidden. It led Harry to believe that there must be another room somewhere that the Headmaster actually used. This small place, though quaint and nicely furnished, was certainly not one to be occupied for hours on end.
a good day, and he’d not wanted to come in. Reid, at least, had apparently gotten enough from Harry a few days ago that he hadn’t had to endure her ransacking his brain today. She’d just asked him a couple of seemingly random questions and sent him on to Sheila.
Hermione sighed, took a breath, and launched into the tale that was last year. By the end, Draco was gaping openly at the both of them. Harry didn’t blame him, he wouldn’t know what to say either if he hadn’t lived it all himself.
“I don’t care,” Sirius replied. “I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s over, and that’s not until June.”
It’d been nearly two years since the last time Harry had seen Ginny, and the time had an effect, but it was overshadowed by the less subtle differences. Her curtain of fiery orange locks was missing, for one—hair instead cut into a pixie look that curled gently around her ears. It heightened her somehow, bringing out the angles of her face and lending more maturity. She looked feminine and entirely comfortable, and it made her seem, to Harry, even more a stranger than when last he’d seen her.
“We were just discussing why our gorgeous Neville here is still single,” Pansy said, taking a sip from her glass.
Hey all! I’m putting a little warning here because there is a smidge of what one might call ***adult content*** in this chapter, so beware if that’s not your cuppa!
be fundamentally different here. In some ways, at least. But he was a fool to ever extend such a thing to the likes of Bellatrix. She was clearly just as much a psychopath here as she was there. Nice clothes and proper hygiene did not sanity make.
The Auror must have heard his footfalls, as she suddenly stopped and swung back around to face him. Her wand was pointed at his neck in seconds.
Draco took a deep, shuddering breath. He looked determined. “Okay, I believe you. Okay, I won’t take my willful naivety out on you, now. Whatever my original reasons for allowing you to prove it, you do seem to have changed. I won’t just throw that away.”
It was clear that’s what she was hoping for. But privately, Harry thought that might be what he was afraid of.
Draco looked around, double checking that no one was in the hallway before turning back to the red head. “I need his cloak, Weasley. And I really, really need him not to know about it.”
Time easily got ahead of Harry lately, as he spent the majority of his days practicing defence magic for the upcoming task as directed, and his evenings surrounded by friends in the Slytherin dungeon until he eventually followed Draco to sleep. Harry wouldn’t say he’d gotten
Malfoy looked up at Maria sourly, not deigning to answer before returning his attention to his toast. He’d not spoken more than two words to Harry all morning, evidently still irritated about last night. The blond looked like he’d not even gone back to sleep after Harry’d woken him, purple smudges beneath his eyes, and Harry had to push down his rising guilt. He’d never had a dream literally force him from bed before, and was more than a bit worried it would become a recurrence.
Draco's eyes darted to Harry's lips for a fraction of a second, but it was enough. Unfortunately, Hermione chose that moment to remind them there was more going on just then. She stood, shivering slightly with a blanket thrown around her. "You did it Harry," she exclaimed happily, teeth chattering.
That was the first time he thought to ask. He leaned over so Ayesha would hear him above the crowd. “Hey, who’s he playing against?”
Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “I like this job because we’re mates,” he said. “I’d hardly want to work on behalf of some pompous arsehole who thinks he’s Merlin’s gift to wizard kind.”
Hermione rolled her eyes as she sat, Luna planting herself right between Pansy and Harry and Neville taking a hesitant seat in the middle of Hermione and Draco.
Harry was in a state of shock as Malfoy placed his hands about Harry's waist. It was all Harry could do to let Malfoy lead, since he'd never been completely successful at dancing. He'd been absolutely atrocious with Parvati just an hour ago, he knew, but now he was dancing with Draco Malfoy. It was probably only due to Malfoy's skill that Harry hadn't yet fallen, and they were hardly moving as it was.
And for once Draco could see no reason he shouldn't do what he wanted to do. He had crossed the room practically before he'd even decided.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled the green eyed boy toward him again. He lightly brushed his lips over the Gryffindor's, more a ghost of a kiss than anything. "You can be sure," he whispered. "Especially these next few days, promise me you'll be sure."
"I just," he paused, scratching his neck. "Look I know that I was kind of... I mean what I'm trying to say is that I'm sorry. You were right when you said I never really knew what I was saying—about blood and such I mean. I said some foul things and I probably still sometimes think a few things you might not completely agree with because of my family—look, you're not at all how I thought you'd be. I can see why Harry puts so much stock in everything you say, and clearly you wouldn't abandon him like the w– Anyway, I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry is all."
Meanwhile... there's a little Wolfstar ficlet on my profile, if you'd like to see what's going on with them:
Harry did not feel lonely, and he did not feel the compulsive need to be so occupied. He’d spent his time thus far contacting people about Neville, taking on an agent role, and had already gotten some inquiries. But it didn’t feel overly urgent.
She sat up, and Draco helped her the rest of the way. There was no helping her second groan, the dungeons did not have comfortable flooring. And it was so cold, every part of her was stiff—exhaustion hung over her like a cloud. How late had they all nodded off?
Draco sighed and handed his boyfriend the letter. Moments later, Harry gave it back and ran a hand through his untameable-looking hair.
While it was true that Harry wasn’t actually entering the maze—thank Merlin—he would undoubtedly be apparating in at the first sign of actual danger. Hermione had informed Draco that Dumbledore was lifting the Apparition Wards during the task, so as to make it easier for the Aurors on hand to do their jobs. Draco hadn’t even known that was possible, and Hermione had seemed fascinated with the logistics of such a thing. Unfortunately for Draco, he’d yet to learn to apparate and couldn’t do so without help. The only way he’d be able to get into the maze was if he snuck in when it first opened. He didn’t have any other options.
Next moment, Bagman's booming voice hit them. "It seems all the Champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. On three. One.... two.... three!"
Hermione stalked up to him in the midst of it all. Displeasure laced her every feature—and what only a select few who knew her, like Harry still did, as guilt.
“Have you heard?” Harry whispered to Malfoy a few minutes later, while Clark introduced her magical guests—small creatures called Doxies, which Harry immediately distrusted due to their apparent relation to Pixies.
Harry shook off his puzzlement as the nervousness seemed to hit him all at once. He stood up—caring very little that he was still in yesterday's clothes—and went to fetch the gillyweed from where he and Draco had hidden it in the bathroom the evening before. When he came back out, Pansy, Vincent, and Greg had all joined Blaise.
Thankfully, she had done so less and less as time had gone on, seeming more content simply to talk with him about what details he found important. None of which had to do with his current everyday-life, anyway.
Harry could only nod mutely. Now that he’d been told all he was interested in learning, reality had begun to set back in, and his attention returned to Draco. He hardly noticed when Dumbledore left.
“Well, we’re obviously not the real Champions, but this is still the real final task. Whoever wins this takes it all and they weren’t here to compete for themselves. So it’s up to us, wouldn’t you say?” he asked.
Hermione giggled like a loon, positively giddy with relief. "I'm glad that Viktor has himself sorted and won't tell me a thing, otherwise I would feel guilty."
For one thing, he very much doubted that would work the way she thought it would. Things were… strange when Harim had any control, as evidenced twice now. But he had absolutely no intentions of a third occurrence happening any time soon. Or ever, he swiftly corrected mentally.
“No, you tosser,” the other boy said with a roll of the eyes. “Isn’t that your owl coming towards us?”
Harry sighed. This was definitely going to be the hard part. “I know. I figured the two of you out.”
Draco felt more alert than he ever had before in all his fifteen years, despite that he’d only slept for about three hours. He had to be sure he would beat the crowds, not willing to risk jostling anyone and ending up discovered.
Since then, the three had ridden on the coattails of his talent, as far as Harry saw it. It was a year or so before they’d been signed on with the ‘Magical’ sublabel of Sanctuary Records, swiftly receiving high praise by Kirley Duke and Myron Wagtail of the Weird Sisters as being
“He can’t be expected to compete like nothing is wrong!” Hermione protested. “That’d be grossly unfair and not to mention completely dangerous!”
with his antics, which seemed to amuse Draco endlessly, and was thus tied for first place with Cedric. They were sent off with the assurance that the Champions would get the necessary information a month before the final task, followed by the order to go about as normal until then.
Judging by the look on Draco’s face, though, he had just realised that Harry hadn’t truly remembered the other man well. The blond looked as though he’d just confirmed something for himself, and was disappointed about it.
“Oh but certainly other things have happened. You’ve made new friends with your former best friend, for one.” She said that bit a touch too brightly, but Harry pretended not to notice, for both their sakes. “And things
Harry was vaguely aware that he was bearing his teeth, but he couldn't be bothered to compose himself. Ron opened and closed his mouth several times, apparently unable to think of anything to say. Finally, he slowly turned on his heel and walked away.
Harry understood what the blond was truly saying: that, ideally, it would be only a matter of time. That it didn’t matter if Ophelia rolled her eyes in disapproval, or if Harry might not get along with everyone in Draco’s life. Whatever the reason. Ending up together would depend on Harry and Draco, and no one else.
“Everyone agreed that no one outside of the room and the chosen Aurors should know. So we can’t tell anyone,” said Weasley.
It had all been quite exciting, but nothing compared to the feeling of waking up thursday morning to the promise that Harry could fly today.
Harry realised that Neville was asking him for expertise now, and abruptly floundered. He had no expertise to speak of, because he wasn’t actually a journalist. “I’m not… sure…” he hedged carefully, “I’ll uh, I’ll figure it out okay?” Harry barely hid his wince at the implied promise. “Just, be as careful as you can until we speak again, all right?”
Draco glared at him. The only thing that broke off his well rehearsed death stare was Pansy’s voice saying, “Luna.”
The blood rushed to Harry's face and neck almost instantly. Of course sodding Malfoy would know just what would bother him most right then. He always did. "Future Champion, am I?" Harry bit out. "Last I checked, your badges were still selling quite nicely."
When Theo entered the room and sat down next to him, Draco wondered absently if the other boy had recently acquired the ability to sense when he was in despair. It seemed unlikely, but lately what did Draco know?
"Harry went to fetch a change of clothes and take his makeup off, said to tell you he'd meet you at breakfast. Not sure you'll make it, though."
And looking at Draco, he still felt love. Not thoughtless, not maddening, but soft. Though still plenty strong enough that his double vision brought a haunting sadness he had no words to properly describe.
Harry swallowed hard, unable to speak yet. Remus was older, but he looked healthier. Vibrant with age instead of run down. The scars on his face were enough to be sure he was still a werewolf, but he had a positive energy all around him. It was overwhelming. Harry would never,
Harry jerked violently—banging his head against the wall behind him in a most unfortunate manner. The pain barely registered, though. There wasn’t room for anything but his shock.
The whirl of apparition caught him up—and then they were landing on weathered, near-frozen grass. The air was biting despite the bright sun overhead, and Harry had a moment to regret not thinking to grab a jumper before his first look around revealed where they were.
The Slytherin scoffed. “Please, like I’m going to set myself up to lose to you again. No, I’m going for Chaser, so you had better be on your game, Potter. I’d quite like to start winning matches.”
“I’m going to try. But how am I supposed to get my hands on it?” he said. “Not like Harry’s going to just hand it over to me.”
“No need to thank me. It’s in my best interest you two work things out. We miss you, you know,” she added gently. “And Pansy does too; I can tell.”
"You know, I hate how everyone talks about your eyes. Like they belong to your mum or something. They're your eyes. They're stunning because of you, not because of her. I'd never get tired of looking at them. Does that answer your question?"
Draco's look said he was both exasperated and entertained. "You were scared then, of losing ickle old me?"
“What if I mess it up?” she finally asked. “Viktor’s family has never been all that supportive of us. And his fame... it can be so much sometimes.”
Slowly, impossibly, grey eyes fluttered and then opened. After possibly the longest moment in human history, they focused on her.
Harry had promised, and no sooner than they both arrived at breakfast—late—was it to be put to the test.
“Thankfully it’s not up to you,” Draco told him with a shake of his head, and then turned to fix every adult in the room with a look of ice. “You’ll
The man’s face softened a fraction, as though he could not help it. “I’ve always loved you Cissa,” he attempted to assure her.
“Harry!” Ron called as soon as he’d come into the common room. Then his brows furrowed in confusion. “What’re you doing here, mate?”
“What I mean is, he’ll just be dead. And we’ll all cry and mourn... but then we’ll move on. You know, heal.” Hermione understood then, but her friend continued anyway. “He won’t be here but not; looking at us but not knowing us. Awake but not… well you get it. It’s lucky because it won’t be that.”
And just like that, the game was back on. Hermione wasn't sure how long it lasted, or when she had fallen asleep. But the next thing she was aware of was a hand shaking her shoulder and Draco's voice saying "Hermione, come on get up. Breakfast's nearly over."
Draco bit his lip. "I don't know. I mean obviously at that time I wasn't... I mean I just thought that I wanted you to like me. Be my friend. And you had those brilliant eyes and I went about trying to impress you all wrong and—"
She only gave him a quizzical look in return for his efforts, apparently unmoved. “What’s this about?”
After the elf had gone and returned and gone again, Lavender turned back to Harry. “So if it isn’t Draco, do fill me in on why you’ve suddenly gone mental.”
Harry expected Draco to bite out some retort that would make him inwardly cringe, no matter that Ron deserved it this time. But, to his shock, the blond did no such thing. His jaw tightened, and Harry knew at once that Draco wasn't saying anything for his sake. Something warm returned to his chest at the knowledge, and he was suddenly more cross with Ron than ever.
“So. Twenty-five hundred children. Roughly five thousand parents. Add in some single adults, maybe another couple thousand just to be sure we count everyone. We’re somewhere close to ten thousand wizards in North America. Are you with me?”
That Malfoy bore no resemblance to this one. Not only was he, of course, older, having grown into all of his features, but this Malfoy was also inexplicably… captivating. His cheekbones and jawline were defined instead of just sharp, and his hair was cut into a smart, top-heavy style that managed to be professional and loose at once. There was no denying that his dark slacks and light blue button down hugged his body in all the right ways, muscles shifting minutely beneath the fabric as he gesticulated to the group around him. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing an arresting variety of tattoos that curled around his forearms and up into his shirt.
Something unidentifiable flashed through Malfoy’s eyes at that, but it was gone in the next blink. Then he closed his notebook with a dull slap, tossing it beside him and straightening.
Harry had the thought that his entire life was a series of worst-case scenarios, and said as much. Muttered it, really.
Lucius scowled. “Must you always be so difficult?” When Draco didn’t bother to reply, his father spoke the next words through gritted teeth. “Yes, even though you’re a... shirtlifter.”
It hadn’t been a snap decision, even though it might have appeared that way to some. But it hadn’t been. It had been Harry, standing in the ringing silence of his flat, and coming to the uncomfortable realisation that he was very, very alone there.
It was not a lengthy kiss, Draco pulled away after only seconds. He didn’t even say a word, just grabbed his bag and walked out, leaving Harry staring after him. Hermione and Ron did him the favour of not commenting.
Lavender grimaced a bit, and Harry felt another twinge of guilt. But she encouraged him to go on just the same. So Harry sat down, and he told her about the Unspeakables, and some of what he’d been doing for them in exchange for his time with Sheila.
I’m a little afraid to say it: we’re soon going to entering the final ‘act’ of this fic, so to speak. At least according to my outline and increased mental planning. Judging by where we’re at, I think I can risk making an educated *guess* and say that this fic will probably clock in at ~90k by the time it’s complete. I think. Which is WILD, holy shit.
The blond took in a great breath, then went still. Stormy grey eyes bored into green for several long moments before Harry got his wits back about him.
The more people gathered in the crowd, the less Harry expected to catch sight of that particular shade of blond hair.
“This happens every year, Harry,” Cosima told him. “There doesn’t need to be an announcement because most everyone already knows, and there’s not going to be a search because she won’t be found.”
He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly. “What’re you doing here, Sirius?” he asked.
Apparently the last Thunderbird Seeker had graduated this year, and so the position for it was open, instead of trying out to be a substitute of sorts. Harry thought that it was fate, because there was one Chaser’s spot open as well—the one who’d held it formerly being a girl who’d, according to Cosima, sustained an optical injury that hadn’t been completely healed in time.
"Harry?" Hermione whispered, and Harry pulled his eyes away from Draco's retreating back in order to look at her.
Bellatrix’s next closest male relative, Sirius Black, had at that point been long disowned—this by his late father, Orion Black, whom was believed to have likely been assassinated by his cousin Cygnus, who stood to gain the title of Head—unaware, of course, that he would maintain it for only a handful of years. A footnote indicated that Orion’s wife, Walburga, was said to have died of heartbreak.
The next handful of seconds seemed to happen in slow motion to Draco. In the first, each pseudo Champion placed their hands on the cup. In the next two, they were all four yanked towards it and began to disappear. In the second following, Draco realized it was a portkey and—practically without any further thought—blindly reached for the closest remaining body part. In the last, he landed hard against the ground, still clutching Not Fleur’s ankle.
For one blessed minute, as Harry glanced around, he saw only what was familiar. They were still the Weasleys, and this was still their Burrow.
But Neville was looking at her with the same coldness he’d shown Harry when he’d first sat down. “Perhaps to you,” Neville allowed.
The twins laughed. Ron wasn't laughing, but he wasn't scowling or grumbling or absent entirely, and for now that was enough.
Harry sat up to press his lips against Draco’s. He knew he’d always get a rush from kissing him, no matter how many years went by. “I’d say that’d be brilliant. And I’d say I love you.”
Moments after he’d entered, it became eerily silent. Turning, Draco realised this was because the hedges had somehow blocked out the roar of the crowd as it closed them in. The Auror had already taken off, her wand out in front of her in preparation for any unknown threat, and Draco chased after her. He let Harry’s cloak fall from his shoulders as he did so, given that it was no longer necessary and would only slow him down.
What he said hadn’t come from nowhere, of course. Harry’d had concerns for a while now. And, in hindsight, it couldn’t be entirely denied that part of the reason they’d gotten past the scandal with Zabini earlier that year relatively unscathed might’ve had a bit to do with the band’s recent decline in popularity. The numbers were getting harder to ignore, especially after the latest release.
Matt gave Draco a look that made plain exactly what he thought about that, then said, “So what now?”
“Two pleases? That’s something from the man who called me a talentless interloper not two weeks ago. You losing your touch or something, Potter?”
“So you can save your bloody sob story about how you’re responsible so naturally you had to destroy every bit of good left in your life afterwards. You
"I-I'm sorry Pr-professor Snape s-sir but I've nev-er had this h-happen before and-d I-" Hermione sobbed. Harry kept his eyes on the scene, not daring to acknowledge his missing partner.
Constant? Harry had mentally questioned. “But he talks to me sometimes,” Harry’d then pointed out. “When he’s
This kiss was, impossibly, more heated. That was until Draco pulled away. "I shouldn't have interrupted," he said, a little breathless. "Please do keep saying those nice things about me."
The blond smiled wider and sat up, rolling his shoulders. "Didn't mean to nod off, knew you'd probably come. Any luck?"
Harry tried to keep the frustration off his face. It seemed everyone in his life had heard ‘what happened’ with him and Malfoy, and yet Harry hadn’t actually been told anything substantial. What the bloody fuck could he have said that had suddenly made him and Malfoy everybody’s favourite gossip? “Right,” said Harry flatly. “Well there’s that at least. Let’s just go back to talking about
. “Settling down and having a litter isn’t in these cards, fortunately. I’ll settle for being a brilliant auntie.”
Harry dropped Malfoy’s harsh gaze then, staring at his own feet so he wouldn’t have to look at the professor. The rest of the class was deathly silent as they watched the spectacle Harry and Malfoy made.
again. Like he loved him...or even like he hated him. Like he felt anything at all. Anything other than continuing to freeze Harry out this way.
Unfortunately, it was like Harry had somehow heard his thoughts. “Wait,” he said, and Draco resisted the urge to kick him. “I don’t want people risking their lives for me while I just sit and hide somewhere.”
“How exactly is my life in danger?” Harry blurted from where he stood next to Draco. They’d been waiting for his parents to show for nearly ten minutes, Draco didn’t blame Harry for wanting answers. He wanted the same, only he’d had it drilled into him to never interrupt when the adults—meaning his parents and any other
“He’s here to see you,” Ginny said casually to Hermione as the younger woman crossed the room towards the far sofa and plopped down across from her and the twins—next to a man Harry hadn’t seen in years.
“No!” Harry cut him off quickly. “No, no. I want kids. But adopting isn’t a small thing, I didn’t know... how to bring it up.”
“I wouldn’t change it,” Draco admitted quietly. “If anything, they remind me I’m freer than I ever would have been.”
That was when time seemed to slow down. He’d called for help, and with it came the attention of everyone. Including the Death Eaters.
That is even to say nothing of the cost to your magical core. Magical signatures notwithstanding, and to be explicitly, abundantly clear, Harry: you share the same
There was minor grumbling to just turn the music back on, however, and Harry didn’t necessarily disagree.
Harry shook his head sharply to clear the memory, but it still stung. He hadn’t meant for any of this to happen. He didn’t care about being a hero or anything that Draco had accused him of. He was pretty sure Draco didn’t actually believe any of it either—at least he hoped he didn’t—but he also understood why he’d said what he said.
?" Draco hissed, grabbing the nearest movable object—which in this case was the chess board Pansy and Blaise had been forced to abandon when Draco had stormed into the common room just minutes before—and hurling it towards the wall opposite.
Still, Fleur's sister floated idly, having no idea that her older sibling was almost completely out of time and had yet to save her.
It’s Draco Malfoy’s birthday, and thus: a chapter. He is not actually in it, though, just talked about. I hope you all like it anyway.
Fontaine sat behind his desk, dismissing the other two boys politely before turning his eyes on Harry and Malfoy. Up close, the man didn’t look all that old. Possibly seventy or so, his hair a darker grey than Harry had thought. His eyes were nearly the same colour as his skin, a tan like honey.
Also, updating update (lol): from now on, I’m just gonna post when I finish a chapter. Trying to keep a schedule has clearly not been going well of late.
Since then, Cole and the other Aurors who’d been Polyjuiced had essentially vanished. It was rumoured that Scrimgeour, supposedly on Dumbledore’s request, had selected them for a top secret mission. Hermione had assured Harry, however, that it was nothing to be concerned about. Harry wasn’t, for once. He had enough to be concerned about already.
It took some convincing to get him to drink from the glass, Merlin knew why, but he did soon enough.
The blond relaxed again. There was nothing to be done about it anyway, since Draco didn’t much care for the thought of obliviating all of his friends.
Harry sighed and walked over to Draco’s bed, sitting down on the edge. “Well too bad, I’m not gonna do that.”
The entire group got very quiet. A beat later, Ron grabbed his empty glass and stood up. Pansy raised her own glass in manner of toast, knocked it back, and made herself scarce as well. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and followed after his friends, glancing back once to confirm neither Neville nor Blaise had moved.
This chapter has been the most difficult to write thus far, purely due to having so much on my plate currently. And also admittedly due in part to Dumbledore being a cryptic little shit who’s very difficult to write for lol. As always, I’d love to know how you guys are feeling.
” Draco stressed each word as though they were separate statements. “I’m—I wouldn’t even know who I am without you anymore. And you’re just completely alright delivering yourself to the monster whose life mission is to kill you because
“You said during the third task. I’m still a Champion,” Harry argued, as expected. He had actually raised a good point though, not that Draco would ever say so.
It hadn’t fit together, though. Harry had found he couldn’t process it, not with such a glaring detraction. “But the first time Harim shut me all the way out, completely and deliberately, it was because of Draco. And
Steel eyes flashed. “Everything’s not bloody alright. What didn’t you know? What did they keep from you?” Draco demanded to know.
“Something we can help you with mate?” G- no, Fred asked him, seeing as how he was holding one of Hermione’s hands in his lap, and that shiny diamond visible on the other where it rested on her thigh.
“Actually, I–” he started, then stopped, suddenly feeling awkward and shy. He turned out not to need to say much else, though, because her eyes had finally strayed to the rucksack hanging off his shoulder.
"Yeah I did," Malfoy said when he finished. "And then you sent a—" he broke off to laugh again. "—patronus at us. Greg nearly wet himself. If I'd had the nerve, I would have thanked you just for that."
“Me and Celine,” Cosima began, resigned to tell her tale, “we were the first Taken. We were sorted, had our wands for half a day, maybe. And then… nothing. It’s all a blank.”
her!” she hollered. “You’ve spoken to Granger all of once! In case you’ve not noticed, we aren’t the same people, Harry! You’re not the Chosen One,” she began, exaggeratedly ticking off her fingers. “Neville doesn’t spend his days dallying amongst the plants, Draco doesn’t have a criminal record, and I’m fucking well not a bloody dead girl! You’ve not the first fucking clue who Granger is!”
It was about an hour or two later that they were all getting ready to head to their respective homes for the night. Harry had already said goodbye to a smiling Draco and had wished him a happy birthday for the
Harry's eyes, of course, went to Draco first. He was tied up between Hermione and Cho Chang. The fourth person appeared to be a little girl, her skin and hair nearly as white as Draco's. She couldn't have been more than eight, and was obviously a Delacour. They each appeared to be in a very deep sleep, faces relaxed and heads lolling to the side. Streams of bubbles occasionally flowed from their mouths.
There were various groans of disappointment at this, but no one was too surprised. Whatever the case, it meant there would be another dare. Draco contemplated for a moment. “Choose someone to exchange briefs with.”
"You were supposed to be making sure Draco was in the clear, not looking at Snape, if I recall correctly," Harry gritted out.
Harry was left once again to his own thoughts, the memory of the first day in St. Mungos coming back to him as it often did.
Draco, helpless, turned from him and left the office abruptly, ignoring Harry’s voice calling him back.
of your hell, you fucking prick. I’ve had enough. Throwing scraps of my own memories at you. Using whatever I can to make you care about my life, my family, the things that mattered to me. Trying to
“Hey uncle Remus,” Ayesha called with an answering grin; she strode towards the older man and gave him a familiar hug.
“And he’s my cousin or something,” Draco reminded them. “Just because someone is family doesn’t mean they’re innocent, or that you should protect them. Merlin, do you even realise what could have happened if you’d been caught helping him escape? How you even managed it is beyond me.”
“I think…” Harry started, but he trailed off when something in his periphery distracted him, and his gaze strayed beyond Neville to see what had caught his attention. It turned out to be someone’s white-blond hair, gleaming under a stray light. And of course it wasn’t just someone’s, but Draco Malfoy’s.
The only time he even acknowledged Harry’s existence was during Potions class, where he had no choice. And even then it was just lifeless orders about how to cut some ingredient or stir correctly. People pretended not to watch them, but Harry could feel their curious stares on his back almost constantly. Everyone wanted to know what had gone wrong between them, though it seemed the majority of the school had gathered that it was Harry’s fault. Harry’d overheard as much in the library on Tuesday.
“It is back,” the Dark Lord said softly then, still sounding laboured. Draco decided he didn’t want to see what the monster looked like just then. “They will all have noticed it… and now we shall see… now we shall know…”
Harry had known that there were even some things the old man had held back, and he hadn’t minded. Now, as he spoke to the boy before him, he wondered if he should have demanded the truth in its entirety, if it’d meant he could have said more right now.
never forget what it was to look down at this man’s lifeless body, taking in his sunken face and his closed eyes. Laid out in the middle of the Great Hall next to his dead wife.
Something in his voice must have alarmed Harry, since his eyes snapped up to look up at him. His jaw nearly dropped. "Wait," he said, "are you jealous?"
Neville gave her a small smile and handed her a coffee. “I knew you were up here visiting him and thought you could use that.”
Harry hadn’t expected her to become so gentle. Her concern seemed so real. He found himself telling part of the truth. “I decided I don’t want to… be like this anymore. I’m trying to change.”
Cosima looked so miserable, he almost kept the last thing to himself. Somehow, though, he forced it out. “But you still go to school here…?”
Harry also came to the conclusion that, if Hermione had heard his argument, she would of been proud of him as well.
Parvati smiled wide. “I’m finally moving in!” she said excitedly. “My lease is up on Thursday. Never thought I’d see the day, if I’m honest. I shouldn’t have renewed it even last time, but Lavender was still… well, nevermind all that now.”
need to understand yourself, and everything you are now, before I can… before I can let you all the way in again, Harry. I have to know you and trust you. And you need to figure out who you
She smirked a bit and then pointed. “You see that girl down there to the left of Matt? Dark red hair? Purple uniform?”
“Ah, I see the issue,” she said. “My colleagues have led you to believe that you’re here to accomplish something of grave importance, yes?”
Hermione looked up at him sharply, her shock must have been written all over her face. “Lucky that Draco could die?”
Draco sighed and they both brought the girl along to shore, where she promptly got her footing, gave a small shout and plowed into Fleur's waiting arms. Harry could hear Fleur explaining about being attacked by grindylows and being forced to turn back, but Harry chose to address Draco rolling his eyes at him instead.
And so it had, at last, occurred to him that he had been holding onto something that was keeping him isolated and was contributing to his unhappiness.
The walk to the nurse was a silent one, both of them still tense and angry. Their injuries turned out not to be all that severe; they really hadn’t had much time to inflict damage earlier. They were eventually released in time for lunch.
“They’ve been here for years... A Death Eater used Crucio on them until they went mad,” he admitted. “I come and see them now and again, even though they don’t know who I am.”
"Wait I—" The blond swallowed and glanced at the ground before meeting Harry’s eyes again. "So that's a no then?"
“What’s happened?” Harry wondered aloud to Joshua as they entered History of Magic. He’d been noticing since leaving breakfast how particularly cheerful everyone seemed to be. Siskin had laid into several people for having private conversations during first. As Harry took his seat, students murmured enthusiastically to each other all around him while awaiting professor Hanson’s arrival.
Hermione eyed his hand, split and looking quite painful. The Slytherin didn't even appear to notice. "Sure, as long as it isn't a lie. Anyway I came to tell you: I think you should try again."
The door swung closed again and Draco turned back to face her. “You deserve every bit of happiness in store for you today, love.”
Neville and Blaise burst into the room, supporting each other and laughing maniacally between heavy breaths. Hermione couldn’t recall when Nev had ever looked quite as carefree.
“I understand there was a disagreement between the two of you?” he said, a small smile beginning on his face.
“I know,” Malfoy replied easily, pretending like he wasn’t gripping his broom like a lifeline. “I see him in the library a lot.”
Guilt settled in his bones along with the certainty that he’d just lost something very important. Thrown it away, more like. And he couldn’t even blame his alter ego this time, bastard that he was.
The ginger smiled and left him standing there. It was the sound of voices coming around the corner that finally snapped Draco out of his state, and he threw the cloak around himself hastily. He tried not to feel too proud of himself when the group of Gryffindors passed right by him, oblivious.
Hermione must have seen the way Harry's eyes flashed, because suddenly she was up and standing between them. Harry wasn't sure who she was trying to shield.
All except, of course, Ron. Harry barely saw him anymore, only in classes, where the redhead would determinately ignore him. And in the Great Hall during meals, where he would sit next to his brothers and act as though Harry were not in the room. Harry had taken to sitting with the Slytherins during these meals, since there was no spoken rules against this, and most of his friends were Slytherins now anyway. Hermione, though, tended to sit wherever Viktor sat, making conversation and possibly more friends among the witches and wizards of Durmstrang. Harry was glad that she'd found someone who seemed to genuinely care for her. Though they'd spoken little, Harry knew that Krum was a good person. He'd stuck by Hermione when she'd chosen to stick by Harry, and for that Harry was extraordinarily grateful. He hoped that the two of them would stay together once the tournament was over, it seemed they would.
