“You looked so peaceful, and I can tell you’re hardly sleeping these days.” He says, almost interrogational. It was true, the thought of the upcoming ball kept him up.
Harry nods, and although the words meant nothing in particular, the joy and hopefulness in Harry’s eyes is something Draco would never be able to forget.
“That’s the plan.” Harry says into the crease of where thigh meets pelvis. His breath is warm through the fabric of his underwear, and Draco wants it off.
Thank you so much for the love this story has received so far! I really wasn’t expecting it to have this much of a reach so early on but I appreciate it so much.
Draco froze, hearing his name coming out of Harry’s mouth. He felt warmth flooding over his body until he had fully processed what Harry had just said to him.
His parents are satisfied, Celeste is seemingly happy, and Harry’s been understanding throughout it all. He wouldn’t say he himself was content, but he’s feeling a lot better about the whole situation.
“We can swap. I’ll take the role of the man and you the women, and then we swap so that you can understand how it goes.”
“Don’t get too excited. You can’t come when you’re working, I don’t want you to get fired.” Draco said sternly and narrows his eyes.
“Then what is it? I apologise for bringing it up, Draco, but it hurts to see you like this. I only want to make you feel better, and you can do that by telling me what’s going on.” She says softly, compassion lacing her tone.
The trumpets introduce his Father, who takes his place in the throne that sits in between his mother and himself. There’s a cacophony of claps, although they don’t come with bright faces. Most look displeased with the King, but a tournament wasn’t something you could miss out on, especially if you’ve been invited. It gets Draco pretty riled up that his Father only cares for the more wealthy people in the Kingdom, and there was so much room in the arena that could easily  another one hundred.
“Well, I don’t think she’s let her status as a royal change her as a person. I thought she’d be a lot more stern.”
He’s so content right now that he would quite happily go and find Celeste and tell her she should just turn back and go home.
Draco contemplated what to do with the letter. What if it was dangerous? Draco doesn’t want Harry hurt. Not now.
Harry picked up the sheets and moved them to his side so he could spread his body over the bed. He hasn’t stood up for over 3 days now, and it was starting to make his legs numb.
As Pomfrey began talking, Harry diverted his gaze to where Draco sat, and shot him a smirk. Draco didn’t smile back though. He just looked off into the distance. Harry’s face immediately dropped from the smile and was brought back to the scenario that was happening around him by Pomfrey saying “Mr Potter, are you even listening to me?”
Draco guides them both down, carful not to trip and make a fool of himself. He sweeps his eyes over the crowd, noting pleased faces. His eyes catch on one particular face, though.
His whole body was tingling. It wasn’t like he’s never been hugged before, he had been given so many from Adelaide, but it wasn’t the same. No normal hug would make your heart race as much as Draco’s was right now. And it made no sense at all. He just knew he liked it.
Harry sucks in a tight breath. Draco looks at him, but his face is expressionless, just looking up at the clear sky. His eyes are so green.
He rummages through his wardrobe, finding the gift and bringing it over. This time, he leans against the headboard and lets Harry settle comfortably next to him.
Harry says nothing as he walks into the room. He points to the large leather armchair, looking up at Draco.
Before Draco knows what’s happening, Harry has hauled him up by the waist and dropped him into the deeper part of the water.
Draco looks down at their erections, which are pressed hotly on each other, and Draco knows what Harry wants.
Because Harry Potter is a charmer, the maiden he’s dancing with— who he’s now worked out is Knight Arthur’s girlfriend— is blushing and swooning, and it’s making it hard to tell it Harry means it or not.
Draco kicks a pile of snow in Harry’s direction, sniggering as little flecks of ice land on Harry’s face.
When Harry woke up the next day, Draco was no longer wrapped around his body. Harry turned to see if Draco was in his own bed, and was glad to see him lying there, sprawled across the bed.
“It’s good to have a break from all that’s happening in the castle, I think you of all people would know that.”
“Send this letter off to Celeste Holloway, please.” Draco straightens his back and smiles appreciatively as Adelaide gently takes the letter from his hold.
“I know it’s late and cold, Jules, but you’re the only one here right now.” He sighs, strapping the saddle in and tugging her out. He hasn’t had the time to see her recently, and he misses it. Life four months ago seems simple compared to now, and he’s slowly understanding that he took all that free time for granted.
“Hey.” Harry says to him, smiling widely at the group of guests Draco is standing with. They’re having a conversation, but Draco hasn’t a clue on what it’s about.
“Bloody hell mate.” Ron said, a concerned look on his face. He sat at the end of the hospital bed, the morning sun peeking through the misted windows of the infirmary.
But then something clicked in Draco. He was tired of being mean. His father was the one who wanted him to be friends with Harry, but Draco rebelled after getting rejected. But now he’s tired of it, and he wants to get to know Harry. Actually know him.
Draco’s stomach rumbles, and he becomes aware of the time. Breakfast opposite the man he hated. Fantastic.
“You know I could just leave right now. I’m sure you have plenty other people in this castle to scold.”
He pulls the hood of the cloak further down his face, and darts across the connecting pathways to get to the stables.
He had some balls to be walking around the castle looking so, unpleasant, but Lucius didn’t seem to mind. Not one bit. He smiled through his mouthfuls of bread and nodded thoughtfully at his words. Well, Harry sure had earned his respect pretty quickly.
“Like you could do any better, I bet you’ve had food made for you your whole life.” Malfoy confidently stated with a grin, but it went away as fast as it had come when he saw sadness grow on Harry’s face.
“Your friends Granger and Weasley came in early to drop off your work, and didn’t hesitate to wake me up by bickering about how much of a git I was.” Draco grumpily said, getting frustrated about how Harry’s friends saw him. It has never affected him before, but now that he saw Harry as a not so scrawny git, it felt different. Like he wasn’t accepted. He knew Harry didn’t accept him either. He was just waiting until Harry laughs in his face and reveals he was being nice as a joke. But now after spending more than 24 hours with him, maybe it wouldn’t happen.
Draco rubs his hands over his face and sighs deeply. The thought of his parents fills him with dread. All these problems he has, half of them would be gone if they hadn’t controlled his life and decisions.
“It’s stinging because it’s working. You big baby.” Draco mutters, focused on getting the salve applied neatly to Harry’s body. It seems to lessen the swelling, although Harry appears to still be in pain.
“But I’ve known for a bit now.” He adds. It feels like a weight taken off his chest, not having to pretend his love for someone. “Are you surprised?”
“Don’t underestimate me, Potter.” Draco says, before he was the one that was running. He makes it over five large rocks before two muscular arms wrap around his waist, tugging him up and off the ground.
“Bad as in?” Draco swings his leg over Juliet and hops down, going to stand next to Harry. He places a reassuring hand on Harry’s forearm, and Harry looks up at him.
“Brilliant.” Harry replied, agitated. Hearing Parkinson talk for 10 minutes had already set him off and he didn’t want the next two weeks to be the same.
“Well, you have plenty of other Knights to talk to. Look, here’s one now. Arthur!” Draco called, spotting a tall blonde Knight walk past the outside sitting area.
‘I’m sorry I couldn’t return it, but I’ve been so busy. Your father has been pushing us extra hard. I miss you.’
Harry doesn’t say anything else, and as they move deeper into the forest, where the snow lays thicker, Harry is several meters behind.
Draco hauled himself off the couch and made his way to the door. He cracked it open and there stood Harry Potter, biting his lip and projecting innocence through his eyes.
Harry pushed his plate to the side so it sat on the table next to him. He decided he wasn’t hungry anymore. He’d learnt how to suppress hunger after living with the Dursley’s for so long. He pulled the sheets up and grunted, turning away from Malfoy. Who was he to make a comment about his awful upbringing? Leave it to Malfoy to be so insensitive about something he doesn’t even know a single thing about.
The gazing into Harry’s eyes is quickly interrupted by something warm and solid touching Draco’s half hard cock. He looks down to his lap to find Harry’s tanned and strong hands palming his bulge, and he can’t help but moan with pleasure. This was all happening so quickly for Draco, it only felt like a couple hours since they first kissed. The night before had appeared back into Draco’s mind, and he couldn’t help but smile. Maybe this was what Draco needed after months of being completely and utterly infatuated with stupid Sir Potter without knowing it. Well, he knew it, but he desperately tried to avoid it.
Draco interlocks himself in her arms, and he just couldn’t hide himself now. Couldn’t turn back and avoid the problem.
‘Yours faithfully, Draco Malfoy.’ He signs the letter off, the quill scratching on the thin parchment.
He plods up the damp sand, Harry trailing behind. There’s grey clouds hanging over the scape, threatening rain over them both. Draco rips his paper from the wood crevice and starts up the stairs.
“I need my arse to dance at the ball, in case you’d forgotten.” He sighs, attempting to pull himself up but only flopping back down a second later. Harry holds two large hands out, and hauls Draco up from the freezing pile of snow. He gets onto his feet and is met with Harry’s face just a couple of inches away from his own. If Draco moves his face forward a fraction, their noses would be touching.
It’s not long before Draco finally releases, shooting come along Harry’s stomach and chest. Harry follows through seconds after, and Draco can feel himself become slippery and wet.
As he approaches the building, he can hear laughter and conversations floating through the cracks in the door.
After a couple of minutes of short jabs and looping movements, Draco is able to work out that the man isn’t just aiming anywhere in hopes that it will knock Harry to his feet, but he is actually going directly for Harry’s right hip. The one that is damaged. No one else seems to notice, even Lucius, who is watching jovially and clapping at each strike of a sword.
“I think the firebolt is the least of my worries, Ron” Harry managed to chuckle before needing to cough.
The match started with a foul straight away, with the hulk of a man trying to pry Harry’s shield off him. It wasn’t going to work, and Harry just stood there with the most confused expression on his face. It looked kind of good on him, but Draco told himself that that wasn’t the point.
Hearing about Harry’s royalty-free childhood just made Draco’s chest hurt, knowing he could have had that if everything else were different. Harry didn’t have a particularly ‘normal’ life, either, but Draco didn’t thing anyone had it as bad as him.
“No. You’re the best Knight in the land. According to my Father.” Draco said, coughing as he realised he had given Harry a compliment.
“What are you doing?” Harry says slowly, trying to hide the fact his body might fall apart in the next few minutes.
Harry did want to go to Dumbledore about Draco. But not for the reason anyone else, apart from Harry and Draco, would expect it to be.
“I don’t want to be completely sozzled when I get my ball outfit tailored.” He explains, although he doesn’t know why he’s trying to talk himself out of a good time.
Draco huffed and sighed on his way down to the lake, trying to think about anything but his frustration with everything right now.
Draco’s eyes drift to an ancient wooden door all the way down the path, and he knows exactly where they’re going.
gonna delete this once the next chap is up but thank you for the love so far and all the really nice comments!! they are very motivational :)
“I don’t love Celeste anymore. I- I don’t want to marry her.” He grinds out, breath heavy with sorrow.
Harry wanted to sit up and ask why Malfoy was pretending to be him, probably to make fun of him, but as he was about to get up his body protested and thought that maybe it was a good idea to stay silent.
Draco smiles as a large white horse pokes her head up, sniffing his face with delight. “Good to see you too, Juliet. How about we go for a ride? Need to clear my head.” He whispers while stroking Juliet’s white-as-snow nose. Juliet flicks her ears up and stands back from the door, as though she can understand what Draco is saying.
“I just...Draco. I don’t want what I told you to make you feel uncomfortable, because you’re honestly one of my closest friends. And I know you said it doesn’t change what you think about me but with what’s going on with you and Celeste I... I don’t know.”
As Draco canters deeper into the forest, he can hear the faint running of water from the stream and finds himself at his secret lake. It didn’t belong to him, and he was sure that other people may be accustomed to it too, but he always used it as a private safe haven to get away from his duties as Prince. It was relatively deep into he forest, so he was rarely ever found. He hadn’t had many things to do to spend his time, so he would normally sit at the lake and imagine that he was just another villager, as though his life would be normal and he didn’t have to live under the scrutiny of the noble King. Lucius had strongly advised that Draco take up battling like he did at that age, but Draco became less of an importance to him over the years, and he saw Draco as a family heir to the throne more than he did his own son. So he had stopped the with the direction and left Draco to his own devices. And Draco was bored. Yes, he could take up jousting to please his father and live up to his family name, but he would rather gallop in the woods with Juliet then have them both at risk of death. His life consists of writing to Celeste, talking to Adelaide, attending balls and making public appearances. He couldn’t complain too much, though, as he does live a life of luxury. He would much rather be bored in a large castle than be living in a hut on the outskirts of the land, milking cows all day. He supposes as he grows up, marries Celeste and becomes king, then his life will be more thrilling. For now though, he is  left to ponder and wait. Left to show nobility and family manners.
Harry stared for a second, and then teasingly said “I know you secretly like it, I’m sure I heard you harmonising with me.” Harry jested, catching Draco off guard.
Harry watched as Draco turned back into his book, his eyes locked in concentration, and his face painted with a look of thought. The white wisps of Draco’s hair softly hung over his eyebrows as he hunched forward, leaning over the block of paper. The hospital wing was oddly silent, Harry and Draco being the only people who have visited in the last day or so.
Lucius. Lucius? Since when have they been on a first name basis? Has Potter really tricked them in to thinking he is so noble?
“I didn’t think they were going to react like that.” Harry laughed awkwardly, scratching the back of his neck.
“You can tell me. I know we haven’t known each other for long but I promise I won’t tell anyone else.”
Once he’s come down from the high, he looks at the pitiful state of Harry, his hair even more mussed up than normal and body shiny with sweat and Draco’s release.
He pulls the sheets up to his chin, shuddering in the cold of his room. But Adelaide has lit a fire, so he shouldn’t be cold. Draco shakes the thought out and tries to get to sleep.
The door swings open, making the parchment of Draco’s book flutter around. Draco slowly turns his head to see who had rudely disturbed his reading.
“Ah, why did he choose to become a Knight? Why couldn’t he become a farmer or something.” Ron groaned, before remembering who he was in the presence of and quickly standing up straight. “And he has that tournament soon, too.”
Before Harry can move on to his next contender, there’s a bellowing voice sounding from the grand oak door.
Celeste has found an old friend and they’re chatting happily away in a corner, thankfully far from Draco himself.
“Molly, what is it?” A man around the same age walked up to the door, then turned to the woman -Molly- in shock.
“Ah! Draco, your parents are expecting you at once. Oh and change your shoes, they’re filthy!” She says quickly and scoffs, glancing down at Draco’s black boots, which are now a murky brown colour.
“Oh, you’re too kind.” She laughs, patting his hand. “Now come on! I’ll be in trouble if you’re late!” She pulls him up from the bed, sorting out his ruffled shirt.
Draco apologises from under his breath and follows his Father and another back to the castle. Draco is intent on searching for Harry, but as he makes his way up to his room and finds a steaming goblet of something warm next to his bed, he can’t help but lay down and have a rest. His eyes begin to close soon after.
Romeo belonged to only one person. And that was Sir Harry Potter, the lands most treasured Knight. Sir Harry Potter, who is known for bravery and performing courageous acts on the battlefront. Sir Harry Potter, who the land trusted with their lives. But Harry Potter would never visit the castle. He was too busy fighting in battles and courting gorgeous women, from what Draco had heard. Harry Potter has more accomplishments at age 18 than Draco would ever have in his life. Draco didn’t praise Harry, but there was no doubt he didn’t find him somewhat of a ‘saviour’ to the land.
Draco had only hoped he didn’t make them feel inferior. His first time meeting people who weren’t working for him or some sort of royalty, and he’d still probably left a bad impression.
Before he slams the door shut, he takes notice of his empty ring finger. Everything in his body is telling him not to wear it, to rebel and feel free for once, but Draco couldn’t even begin to fathom what his father would do if he saw. Draco gave in, pulling the ring from its holder and slipping it on. His heart sinks every time he looks at it.
He folded up the letter and placed it in one of the drawers, so that no one would be able to see it. One last letter sat in his hands, the paper surrounding it worn out and dirty.
“Nothing at all.” Draco laughs with a grimace, knowing that he’ll have to live his life loving a women that he doesn’t love.
“What’s his Mistress’s name?” Harry asks Narcissa, noticing Draco’s disinterest in the conversation.
“Where should we go, Jules?” He says, stroking her ears. “Beach or Forest?”. Juliet turns her body towards the large towering trees that sit at one side of the caste. “Forest it is.” He laughs, but quickly stopping in case one of the working maids may hear him. He must show royal etiquette wherever he may be. Even if he does not agree with Lucius’ rules sometimes. Lucius’ ‘Royal Etiquette’ was the reason why Draco was called a conceited Prince, but the reasoning behind it was because Draco couldn’t be seen as anything other than a man of class and status. He couldn’t smile and nod and walk through the town smelling the baked goods and flowers. He had to keep a serious face, and was taught not to converse to other’s who were not approved by Lucius. Whoever Lucius respected, Draco was to show that same amount of respect, too.
“And you’re doing you’re best.” Harry says wholeheartedly. “Draco, I don’t think I’ve ever felt like this before. I don’t want something as little as your parents to ruin this.”
seeing that everyone has gathered around the circular table to spectate. A blonde, curly haired knight who he can only guess was Nick volunteered to go first, and Draco smirked.
Harry’s going deeper, easing Draco onto his fingers, and it gets less painful. Draco is speaking profanity’s right into Harry’s face, and Harry just smirks and jerks his body alongside his fingers, making Draco arch up off the bed.
“Did you see a teacher?” Ron had quickly whipped his head around to look where Harry’s attention was fixed on.
“Just a bit.” Draco nervously laughed back. They walked across the grounds, stepping over the treasured Alstroemeria Lilies and onto the back path.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry shruggs, but immediately regretted it as the searing pain returned to his hip.
But Ron didn’t give up this time around. He tested Harry’s skills very hard, even after Harry just leaving the hospital.
“Haven’t I always told you not to underestimate me?” He smirks, brushing away stray swathes of hair on Harry’s forehead.
“You’re welcome.” He said, before pulling a money bag full of gold pieces out of his trouser pocket. He didn’t really know how much a sword was, so he just placed the whole bag onto the table. He had thousands more of them at the castle, so it was no loss.
“I got you something, by the way.” He says through the silence, reaching down and grabbing a brown package.
“Merlins sake.” Harry muttered. He picked up the parchment and quill that Hermione had left him, and began reading about the uses of horned slugs.
Harry swears angrily and opens his eyes, trying to focus on anything but the searing pain in his hip.
Thankfully, for the mass he can sit wherever he likes, and he chooses a few rows ahead of his parents, so he doesn’t have to look at them. Maybe if he ignores them for long enough, he can forget they’re there.
“Viktor Krum.” Dumbledore announced and the hall erupted in cheer. Harry clapped and smiled at Ron as he whooped and shouted.
“Draco...” Harry starts, but Draco can’t let him— won’t let him— say any more. It might hurt too much.
“Stupid Sir Potter! I don’t know why Father keeps inviting him to breakfast, he’s not that interesting.” Draco drawls, swishing the water around with his pale and slender fingers.
Halfway through his dinner, Harry saw Draco as he walked through the hall. His attention was immediately taken from the triwizard tournament conversation as he watched Draco sit at the Slytherin table, nodding at his friends at his arrival. Harry felt bouts of sympathy at the lack of joy that Draco’s friends displayed when he had joined them.
“You’re kidding, right? Or was I just oblivious to what I signed up for.” Harry said, his eyes widening in alarm.
“We thought it was just a false alarm.” He starts, and Draco freezes. There can’t be another battle, surely...? Harry’s voice interrupts his thoughts. “But your father thought we should make sure.” He inhales deeply. “There was a huge fire. Massive. And on the other side, there were the knights from the enemy land.”
He pulls Juliet up on a split second decision, wanting to see Harry as he comes back in. He jumps on quickly, pelting through the woods as fast as Juliet can go.
Draco feels much better. He supposes there’s no making this go away, no amount of therapy from Adelaide would change reality.
Harry was about to say something else but saw Ron and Hermione walk in, smiling. Harry groaned very slightly but smiled as they went up to him. Ron scowled at Draco, but Draco just ignored him.
‘Dearest Celeste. With the changing seasons I come to realise that our meeting is soon to happen. Here at the castle it has been very busy, due to all the preparations going on. My mother and father are very excited, but I think I hold that feeling most of all. You see, my dear, this is the start of something for the both of us. A first fallen domino to when we finally wed. Although your name is not Harry Potter and you are not a man and you could only wish you were as half as hot as him...’
“Better?” Draco asks after a couple minutes of silence, once Harry has become aware of his surroundings.
It makes sense, it’s perfectly reasonable, but jealousy and something alarmingly heady surges in his stomach, mixing unpleasantly alongside his nervousness and dread.
Draco remembers that he’s not the only one that has to pretend. Things are better hidden than faced with his fathers wrath.
When Draco turns his gaze up to Harry, desire strikes him. He inhales a shuddering breath and tugs Harry down, colliding their faces together hurriedly and messily. Harry swipes his tongue over Draco’s bottom lip and Draco opens his mouth, revelling in the feel of Harry’s tongue exploring his mouth. They push forward and back, wanting as much contact as possible and Draco can feel Harry’s hands tightening on his own.
Draco bursts out in laughter at Harry’s simple statement, and Draco looks at him as though he’s gone mad.
“I can still feel it...” He says through a yawn, the sounds of rain winding his brain down far too early in the day.
Draco’s about to ask him if he’s really going to get something from the other side of the castle naked and sticky, but Harry only bends over the edge of the bed and retrieves something wedged under it.
“Draco!” Harry calls in a sing-song voice, swinging the door open. Draco’s very glad that this part of the castle is so secluded, otherwise he’d be in a lot of trouble.
“Beautiful.” Draco echoed. It wasn’t that Celeste wasn’t beautiful, she was gorgeous, but he just couldn’t feel anything there anymore. The ring on his finger felt too heavy.
The backs of Draco’s knees hit something hard and wooden, finding him and Harry now in front of the swing. Instead of moving them back, Harry slowly lowers Draco down on the swing, pressing his own body close. Their hands meet on the metal chains, Harry’s own warming Draco’s.
It was only a few minutes later when Draco wins the game of Rummy, finding his hand empty. He looks up to find everyone absorbed in the game, laughing at Nick’s easy defeat.
“Oh come on, Draco. How can I not? And you really would hate it if you had to watch him fight? Would it be so horrible?” She said, teasing him.
“You alright, Harry?” Ron said as he watched Harry pick his fork around his food. He didn’t feel like eating. He didn’t feel like doing anything until Draco had seen him. Harry nodded and sighed.
“Of course. You don’t want to leave it too late though, Sir. Draco here is already engaged.” Lucius says, and directs his attention to Draco, who is picking around his food with his fork.
“I don’t want to marry Celeste, I don’t want to be with any woman, because I like Harry Potter.” He says confidently, although he can hardly hear himself through the rushing of blood in his ears.
“And also, Draco, you have a letter from Celeste. I don’t think she’s particularly happy about the silence on your side.” She said, a frown pulling at her lips.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He tries to say, ‘I understand Harry. I get it.’ But he doesn’t. He doesn’t understand because he wants to feel it. Wants to know what it’s like, to be loved.
“Harry.” Draco stood up. He wanted Harry to know that yes, he meant it. But he was scared. Draco Malfoy admits that he’s scared. “I do- I just- I cant- I don’t.” He stopped, choking over his words. They were stuck in his throat, and he had to push them out. He had to tell Harry that he meant everything that he had done.
Harry who feels the same way as him, Harry who is not wearing as many clothes as his should be, pressed against Draco’s side lovingly.
Harry turns and flashes a smile. “Oh it wasn’t too important. Sorry to take time out of your ‘busy day’” He smirks.
Instead of letting Draco storm off and sulk in silence, Harry calls to him. “I’ll be outside. If you wanted to talk.” He sounds so dejected and Draco’s heart aches.
“Fine, Draco, but if you want the hems to be wonky and your left trouser leg longer than your right, then I suggest you both keep your mouths shut.” He says, bright blue eyes piercing the both of them.
“Let me finish, Draco. You only have three years until you marry Celeste, and I know you’re dreading that but then you’ll be free from your parents. They’ll see you as a man instead of a boy.”
He tightened his grip and leant further forward, and Juliet started to run with speed, her hooves flinging sand behind her.
“It’s fine, Draco, I’ve lived in that part of town my whole life, if I get noticed I get noticed, it’s just a default part of my job. And I know the people who own the blacksmiths. I’m welcome whenever.”
There could have been a time when Draco liked it all, as a toddler who’s excitement was all-consuming. He can’t remember, though, and he supposes it couldn’t have been that good if he doesn’t.
“Yeah.” Says Harry, biting his lip. He cracks a large, sheepish grin and waits for Draco’s response.
“Oh lord.” He groans, doing the action again. Draco’s body naturally reacts to it, and he’s not happy about it.
“I don’t want you to mess it up. Everyone outside of this castle is under the impression that you’re a fighter and training to be a knight. I want you to make it believable.” He says with a sharp tone in his voice.
After a couple of minutes of fumbling, Draco trying to de-clothe Harry but struggling due to the fact Harry’s hands are down Draco’s underwear, Harry’s just as naked as he is. He smiles at his handy work.
“Well we’d all be dead if you hadn’t taken down the enemies team.” Ron laughed nervously, and Harry’s eyes snapped away from Draco’s.
“Promise me you’ll stay. I don’t want you to run away anymore. I want you in my arms, forever. We’ll get through this. I’ll win the tournament for you.” Harry said, softly breathing as he pressed his forehead against Draco’s.
“Do you think he’s up to something? Spying for his father?” Henry contributes. At the murmurs that the question causes, Harry coughs loudly.
“I’ll be seen.” Draco snapped back in Harry’s change of tone. As much as he’d like for Harry to get in trouble for being a disobedient git, he wouldn’t like to be in the same amount of trouble himself. He had successfully been able to sneak out to the lake and the beach without getting noticed, and he didn’t want his frequent visits to end abruptly.
“I expect you to be competing in the tournament soon, Harry.” Lucius says, his eyes narrowed in question.
Draco smirked at Harry. No one had ever called him funny before. He stared at green eyes and black hair but broke it off after a couple of seconds.
“Harry, I want to- I want to-“ Draco tried to say, but they turned into silent sobs. He watched as Harry walked away, knocking into Pansy as he left.
“You sleeping on my bed.” Harry said, standing up. “You left. When I woke up. You had gone back to your own bed. Like it meant nothing.” Harry exclaimed, sadness in his voice.
When eating, Harry diverted his gaze a couple times to look at Draco with his hair wet and tousled, curling underneath his ears.
“Shush, Draco. Yes I’m upset that my parents died and yes, I was never given a life of luxuries, but it’s not something I can change. I don’t want you feeling bad, or thinking your struggles aren’t valid.” Harry says with such honesty and compassion that Draco’s heart hurts.
“Even when I think I know the castle, and your secret spots, there’s always something new.” Harry says, awed. His breath is visible in the cold air, the white plumes obscuring the view of his face.
Draco tried as hard as he could to stop his eyes from rolling. If he heard someone mention the ball again he might actually lose it.
The chapel is open to anyone that resides in the castle, but Draco finds its empty today. Maybe the delay was a good thing. It means there’s less people to talk to.
“Ah, yes.” Harry stammers out. He gives him a look of ‘I’ll see you later’ before slipping out of the room.
Stupid Potter. Barging into the castle and acting superior. Draco is the superior one here, but it seems to be only him that thinks so.
“I’m kind of glad that I’ve never had a portrait done, it looks like hell.” Harry said, walking further along the wall.
“Yes, nice light today, sit up.” Pierre said, his words clipped. Draco shuffled back onto the seat, straightening his back and smoothing down the strands that had escaped from his floppy hair.
“We can go up to my place.” Harry said, looking up at the ceiling. Hermione nodded and Ron just stayed blank and unresponsive. His focus was primarily on Draco, and he snapped out of the staring as Harry moved towards another door in the room.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry.” Draco replies earnestly, but he also wishes he could go back to that feeling last night. Harry calling him hot was not unwelcome. “I understand.” Is all he can say, because the thought of never doing what he wants to do with this man hurts.
“Draco, you can tell me anything. My job here is to be there for you. Not anyone else in this castle.” Adelaide says, lowering her head so she can catch his attention.
“So how do you all know eachother?” Draco asked, crossing one leg over the other. One other thing that Lucius had forbidden him to do.
Harry stumbles around, picking up little trinkets like he was doing only hours before, and Draco explains them, telling the story about whatever Harry had found. Then Harry’s eyes landed on Draco.
“No, not my type of thing.” Draco replied with snark, his lip curling. He then stopped, realising these people were now treating him as he if he were normal. He has to give the same amount of respect back.
The sun is slowly setting as Draco leaves the castle, covered by a black cloak. He hides in small alcoves as Knights pass by and ducks under stairways as the maids head off to bed.
Placing the book on the table, he was about to lie down and close his eyes before he caught a flash of green swooping past the open door.
Harry was about to say something before a knock was heard at the door. Draco stepped back from Harry, realising that they had ended up really close together.
“Good morning.” Draco replied, still unused to the mess of the space. There were completely melted taper candles dotted around everywhere, and the parchment looked as though it had been trampled on by horses. Draco supposed they didn’t have a lot of money, and remembered about their reaction for the bag of money he gave to them not long ago, paying for Harry’s sword.
Harry watched as Ron left the infirmary. He lowered himself back on his pillow and let out a loud groan. His whole body was stiff and aching but it serves him right for playing quidditch out of hours. Even though everything hurt, it was all worth it to see Ron’s face after he caught the snitch for the 3rd time. Maybe it was a good thing that was Ron was a keeper.
She wraps an arm around his own, and Draco feels like a prince. A noble, powerful, figurehead. It feels awful.
“I DON’T KNOW, OKAY?” Draco winced after Harry had gone back to using his last name. The one he dreaded. The one that would always be associated with his Father.
Harry couldn’t think. He couldn’t feel anything. He couldn’t hear his friends around him, gasping. All he could see was Draco, a tear running down his face as he stared at Harry.
Harry was about to retort on Draco’s drag, before turning to see Ron and Hermione with their mouths hanging wide open. Again.
‘If only these past years spent waiting for my fathers permission to visit you hadn’t happened, darling. But we have all the time in the world to make up for it. Adelaide has me up at seven every morning practicing the waltz, and later today my tailor is visiting and I’ll have my outfit. Remember, you’ll have to wear something forest green so that we’ll match. The night has to be perfect, no?’
But Harry was great at fighting and never seemed to give up, so Draco is left to pray to whoever is listening that the man Harry is up against just really wants to win.
Draco thinks of bright green eyes and tanned skin. Suits of armour and green serpent embellishments. He’s never really been good at ignoring Harry, no matter what the situation was.
“I have! I go to... somewhere that doesn’t concern you. I’m not a goody two shoes, Harry. I don’t always submit to the needs of the King.”
‘I hope you are keeping your castle, soon to be our castle, safe. And I do hope that you still think of me, Draco, because my thoughts are only you.’
Draco settles back down onto the sheets. “You do realise that we normally have a big feast to celebrate the workers. It’s boxing day.”
Harry’s soft lips were glistening like his eyes, and Draco really struggled to resist. This was the first time they’d ever stood so close, and Draco loved it. Harry is staring at him with hope evident in his eyes, trying to understand what Draco was feeling. Draco really, really wants to go for it.
Draco’s breath hitched as he realised that he was in love with Harry Potter. He sighed, lying back. He imagined himself on the bed with Harry and he just lay still for 10 minutes.
Harry’s mouth is warm and inviting, his lips soft and frankly intoxicating. The kiss is a steady ache— a good ache— that consumes them. Harry is dragging him down further, drawing him in desperately and Draco can’t think. Can’t think about anything but this man.
Harry forms an agonising rhythm, moving up slowly and coming down hard, taking his time to lick hot stripes and suck gently on his head. Harry takes his own cock out, moving his hand in the same rhythm and groaning pleasurably around Draco. Draco finds himself lifting his hips up and meeting Harry’s mouth, trying to get further down the silky throat.
“Of course he hasn’t.” Lucius tutted. “Come at seven, it should all be served as you arrive.” He stated, patting Harry on the shoulder. He turns down the next corridor that lead to his drawing room and disappeared out of sight.
“Harry, are you sure you’re okay? Ever since you left the hospital you’ve been off. Is there something going on? If Malfoy is being a problem then you can always talk to Dumbledore.” Hermione suggested, trying to offer her support.
“Hey! Put me down!” Draco shouts, writhing. Harry pulls him up and turns him so that he is almost bridal style carrying Draco. Before Draco can drop down, he throws his arms around Harry’s shoulders, hauling himself up.
Draco sluggishly stands up, carefully removing the cape. He delicately hands it over and heads to his room, pulling out a tunic and breeches, and also forgetting to close the door.
The first thing he sees when he wakes up early that morning are bleary green eyes, watching Draco’s slow rise. The fire has died, but there are a couple of weak rays of winter sun that catch on Harry’s face, illuminating a softness that only seems to be there when he looks at Draco.
Lake James is completely frosted over, and the moonlight blurs on the surface. He hops off Juliet, crunching over the ground to get on an icy rock. He hasn’t done this for a while. Just sitting broodily and reflecting. Juliet lays next to him and provides warmth amidst the chill.
“Is it that bad?” Harry croaked, cracking his sleepless eyes open to look at Ron. He tried to focus on Ron’s face but everything he could see was blurred.
“I think I’m a bit...” Harry says, not finishing his sentence but not needing to, indicating his stained trousers.
“Your royal highness.” She curtseyed in politeness, though her face was painted in shock. She sent a deeply confused gaze between both Harry and Ron.
“Well thank you very much.” Draco replies, and then holds out two hands to haul Harry up. “Now, we’re going to my library, because you’re half-drunk and so am I and I am pretty much done with this castle.” He says indignantly.
“I don’t really know. As you probably know I still went into battle for a good two years until my hip got injured, then I came to yours. Cadogen had suggested it when I was 16, but I declined. I was not giving up that easily.”
He dashed off to the village underneath his black cloak before he could completely lose his mind and forget everything that ever existed. Apart from Harry Potter. He doesn’t think he’ll ever forget about Harry Potter. He’s certain he’ll forget about Celeste Holloway.
Draco quickly finished his breakfast, excuses himself from the table and makes his way to his study.
Before Draco completely falls asleep, he can hear a low, long suffering sigh from outside the doorway.
“The things I do for you.” She shakes her head and leaves, walking back in the last second to kiss his head.
He’s not surprised to find a cloak folded up, the fabric a deep midnight blue. He gets a new colour each it.
The castle’s secret garden is exactly how he remembers it, a rusted swing hanging from a willow tree in the middle, and walls of cobbles and roses.
“Okay, but you need to be downstairs in ten minutes. Your mother and father want to speak to you at breakfast, then you’re having lunch with the nobles, after that you’ll have to meet with me and we’ll...”
“Harry, I-“ Malfoy’s voice got caught in his throat. The softness of his voice had shocked him more than saying Harry’s name, as the only time he ever says it is to make a petty remark about his stupid girlfriends. Malfoy watched as Harry’s breathing had come to a halt, and could tell he was having a hard time getting used to the first name basis Malfoy had sprung upon him.
“I’m joking, Draco, and I’m sure Parkinson says the same about me.” Harry smiled, trying to get his point across to Draco.
Harry rests his head on the wall, glancing sideways at Draco. The smile easily returns to his face, and aside from the troubles with his parents, Draco feels pretty alright.
Draco was glad that Adelaide understood what he was saying, even if when it came to the idea of him not wanting to marry confusing. Draco didn’t understand either, it was just a gut feeling that he couldn’t let go. But the thing is, Draco had been so distracted by his adventure with Harry, that he had forgot all about his situation. It was freeing, and that was all Draco wanted.
“You’re getting a portrait done today, by the way. Your Mother requested Pierre in and he should be arriving in a couple of hours.” Adelaide says, interrupting Draco’s train of thought.
“You should have a rest...I’ll just...” He goes for the door, but stops when Draco calls out to him.
“Absolutely not.” Draco smiles back, but it just makes his body hurt more. He’s having trouble moving his eyes due to the pain, so he just stares at the ceiling.
Harry chuckles and presses himself onto Draco, chest to chest, hip to hip. It was excruciating, sitting next to Harry, because the utter tease thought it’d be great to see how far he can slide his hand up Draco’s leg before he did something he regretted.
“Busy?” Draco asks, slamming the book shut. Everything seems all too casual. He’s going to have to get used to Harry coming into his private library now, but with the way that Harry slings his outer-garments onto the back of his chair, his open welcome may soon be taken back.
“That’s the point of the game, Hermione. But I get where you’re coming from.” Harry said, sending a knowing glance to Hermione.
Draco isn’t even surprised when Harry walks—wobbles—in only a couple minutes later. He’d obviously followed him from the rooms.
Draco used his proper spoon, whereas Harry, who obviously had no manners or table etiquette training, picked up the biggest spoon on the table, almost the size of a ladle, and scooped the mixture of food messily into his mouth, shoving a large chunk of bread immediately after it.
Draco sits up in bed and rubs at his forehead, attempting to ease away the pain. Harry winces with sympathy.
“I was hoping he’d come and pick it up.” Ron shrugged before his eyes widened in realisation. “Not that I don’t appreciate you coming here, of course. It’s just me and ‘Mione barely see him anymore. He wrote us a letter saying the King is keeping him in.”
“Oh dear.” Harry laughs, joining Draco on the ground and spreading his limbs. He picks up a blade of grass and stars to shred it up.
“There’s not much else I can do now. You’ll have to wait for them to heal on their own.” He says, helping Harry shuffle slowly up the bed. Harry manages to stand up, and he clutches tightly on Draco’s arms.
Draco picks up the small letter and unfolds it on his lap, trying to keep it away from the sight of Harry. He turns from the humorous conversation about how Cadogan nearly had to fight a sloth of black bears in the forest.
Sadly we have come to an end with Kiss it Better. I really hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I loved writing it!
Harry has become a steady figure in Draco’s life, a reminder of kindness amidst the presence of his parents. He’s comforting.
“Don’t worry about it. Have a nap and I’ll get Adelaide to make you tea.” Draco replies, opening his door for Harry and watching as he walks down the corridor.
Draco tugged Juliet out of her stable, saddled her up and climbed on. He startled when Harry jumped up after him.
“You’re right, Draco. No sadness to be had on Christmas.” Her face lights up. “Now, up and out of bed before breakfast is ready, and you may find there’s a surprise for you when you get back.”
Harry laughed, his breath skimming Draco’s face. “I knew it.” Harry said, and leant in to kiss him again.
“We’re not an ordinary family, Harry. He has to meet societal requirements and for that to happen I have to comply.”
He flipped the letter back over and broke the wax seal that held it closed. He took a deep breath, knowing that he shouldn’t be looking through Harry’s letters, but it he couldn’t turn back now as the black ink revealed itself and he began to read.
“Hardly. And it didn’t stop you from acting snotty when we first met.” Harry shrugged, a smirk sitting nicely on his face.
“He was in my knight training. We did absolutely everything together. He showed me the ropes because I was so new to everything, and I don’t think I would have won that battle if he hadn’t taught me everything I know.” Harry’s eyes start to well up.
“Sorry I’ve been so busy.” Draco mumbles to Harry as they both climb onto the bed. “I’ve missed...uh...” He looks at where his hands are threaded into Harry’s hair, “This.”
Pierre pushed the door even wider, inviting Harry in. Harry looked from Pierre to Draco, and then noticed the easel. His face lit up in understanding and he didn’t really know what to do.
The library is a lot bigger than his room, and his sofa is far from the comfortable plushness of his bed. But once he lights the small fire, he’s fine. He settles himself on the leather sofa and pulls the blanket over himself. He’s never felt better.
“I- YOU READ MY LETTER?” Harry screamed, anger rising up in him, causing a fire to burst through his heart and eyes.
He couldn’t take it back now, couldn’t say ‘Oh it was just a joke.’ Because it wasn’t a joke. It was something that had been on his mind for the past two years. Something he had to hide in fear of his safety and life. It wasn’t a joke. And Draco didn’t laugh. He seemed defensive at first, but there wasn’t a moment where Harry felt threatened. He had no doubt that if his secret had come out earlier, Draco would have teased him to no end. He knows how it goes, because Sirius had to suffer with that too. Sirius wanted to have a normal life and wanted to love whoever. But he had to go thought insults and pain for the duration of his time at hogwarts. And it scared him. Really scared him.
Harry just shook his head with a light laugh, before finding a stone and placing it flat in Draco’s palm. Then he did something that made Draco startle. His hand pressed the small of Draco’s back, angling his body sideways instead of Draco’s straight-on stance. Harry only chuckled and looked away, before taking the hand the had the stone in and placing his calloused fingers over long pale ones.
“I know you don’t like talking about it much, but I really don’t know what to expect.” Harry says, wiping droplets from his cheek.
“Harry, don’t you think that’s a little dangerous? I mean firstly your hip, but also you could be exposed to someone who might want to hurt you badly.”
“Yeah, who knows.” Harry replied, catching Draco’s eyes and reflecting something that Draco had never seen before and something he couldn’t understand.
He turned to Harry, who was trying to smother a smile. “What did I say?” He said with a sigh and an over-exaggerated frown.
“Well it just seems like Adelaide has payed you more attention than your own parents have.” He shrugs, but a sad tone lines his voice.
“And just the pain of it all. It meant to feel good to take down their head knight but all I felt was cold. I was numb.”
“Mr Potter,” Harry woke up to the voice in front of his face “Ah, you’re awake. Your dinner is on the table, and make sure you keep on taking that medication.” Pomfrey raised her eyebrow and left, leaving a plate next to him and one on the other bed.
“Who wants to play first?” Draco says boldly, his proudness surfacing. He takes the cards offered to him and shuffles them fancily, almost as if he were putting on a performance. He snaps the cards in to place and looks up,
meals, even though Lucius admired him greatly. The open invitation still stands, but Harry seems to have come to his senses.
Draco stared angrily into Harry’s face as they walked on, and then he let it go, understanding that Harry was teasing. He knew he was teasing right from the start, but there was something else in his voice when he said it. Draco ignored him and stepped over the bridge, making their way back into the castle.
He tries to lever himself up, but his arms give way underneath him and he slams back against the sofa. His back is as sore as everything else, and he supposes that’s due to sleeping on something that’s not a bed than the cold he’s apparently caught.
Life is getting very busy (school started again and i have a job!) so posting may not be consistent which i apologise for. I love this story and i wrote it knowing one day it’ll be finished. There’s still a lot to go with the story, I have some twists and turns planned so be prepared 😌
“When I turn twenty-one. Some stupid tradition that’s been in the Malfoy family. That’s why my Father was keen on finding me a Maiden so young.” Draco sighed but still kept a smile painted on his face. He didn’t want Harry knowing he hated it. Hated his life where his future is to marry Celeste.
“That was the most boring shit I’ve ever sat through.” Harry says as he pushes Draco against his closed bedroom door an hour later.
Draco remembers the last battle, when he was sixteen. His family was fine, but the land suffered. He worried every night, in his bedroom, that they’d swarm the castle and Draco would die.
“Yeah.” Draco said, distracted by the thought of Harry being crowned triwizard champion. He knows if Harry won it, he’d be cheering and screaming, much to the dismay of his fellow Slytherins.
“Bloody annoying Knight.” Draco mumbles quietly in his hand, which causes a faint laugh to sound from the man next to him. Lucius and Narcissa carry on eating, oblivious to Draco’s annoyance.
“Ada!” Draco calls as he sees Adelaide frantically scurrying around outside his wing of the castle. She spots him and makes her way over to where he stands in the hallway.
“What? No. Malfoy’s don’t apologise.” Draco crossed his arms, sulking. “I- I’m sorry” he finally admitted, and felt relieved when Harry didn’t jump up and laugh in his face.
He and his family would be in midnight mass right now, in the church attached to the side of the castle. But his father has been called out, along with the rest of his knights. The castle is practically empty. Which is a good thing, now that he thinks about it. He can walk around without being spotted and there’ll be no-one at the stables, which is somehow busy every hour of the day.
Hermione scrabbled for words and then straightened her position. “I’m sorry, Sire, but I’d thought you’d have been more defensive about your Father. I know many people are not a fan of him, but I hadn’t realised you weren’t one too.” Hermione stated, before shrivelling into herself at Draco’s neutral face.
“Yeah, yes I know.” He admits, rolling off of Harry and slithering up to his pillow. He doesn’t say anything, but he’s certain they both know, and a couple of seconds later, Harry has sidled up beside him, his face inches from his own.
Pierre lifted a large canvas onto the easel, and began studying Draco’s positioning. He gestured with his hands, rather aggressively, to shuffle this way, or jut his hip out more.
“You’re not greedy, Draco. You can’t help it if your feelings change. You don’t deserve to be unhappy.” Adelaide assures him, brushing back a stray hair that had fallen on Draco’s face. “Is there someone else?” She speaks up after Draco has sat up.
It’s not that Draco doesn’t want to see Harry. In fact, Draco would gladly do it all day. But now, finding things out about Harry and ultimately himself, being around him will be like pressing a self-destruction button, only hurting himself more.
Harry sat, staring at the fire. He rubbed at his messy ink black hair and twisted his mouth in thought.
Harry looked deep into Draco’s eyes, then swiftly turned to get down the stairs. Draco sighed in relief. Maybe Harry was catching on. Maybe he was brains and beauty.
Harry just gazes into his eyes, understanding Draco’s despair. Draco stares right back, feeling his fingers carding through the cold grass and wondering how on earth he could have disliked Harry when they first met. His initial ideas blinded the fact that Harry was actually charming, and in the best way possible. He wasn’t arrogant or vain or rude, and Draco really hopes that Harry doesn’t think he himself is like that anymore.
He’d worked out why he didn’t want to marry Celeste, why he didn’t like her in that way. It was because he liked men. It was because he liked Harry Potter.
Harry laughs, “No, me neither.” Their eyes meet and there’s no shame. There’s nothing but pure lust.
“What are you doing?” Draco asks, catching his breath after the sudden surprise. “And why are you in the ballroom?” He adds, twisting in Harry’s grip to look at the entirety of the ballroom. It’s the biggest room in the castle, the heart of it, and the decorations are extravagant. There’s a grand staircase on the back wall, leading to large french doors that look out onto the gardens. Not one thing isn’t covered in gold, and it all reflects the light coming from the vast crystal chandelier, the centrepiece of the room.
Harry snorts. “Anyway, the feast is in ten minutes, but I was thinking I could smuggle some things in a basket and we can have a picnic?”
“Shove off, I’m not.” Draco replied defensively. It made him wonder, though. Draco was normally a stuck up brat to everyone who entered the castle. But when Harry had arrived, the mask he used so frequently to seem cold had slipped away without him telling it to.
He smiles at the fact that Harry has all this, has a family that isn’t really one but completely is at the same time. They’re family
The blacksmiths was cozy, much different to the one that was in Malfoy Castle. There were swords and shields lined neatly across the walls, and below sat a comforting fire. The cramped space had people dotted around, looking at the new works created by the owner.
“Harry, are you okay?” Hermione quickly said, and Harry turned to see Hermione taking in all of his face.
“Ah, don’t worry. Draco will be there if you need help, although I’m not sure how much he could do.”
“You’ve got to be at the front of the castle for Celeste’s arrival.” She tells him, gathering his stuff together.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just starts to untie Harry’s ghillie shirt. They’ve got to finish what they’ve started, and Draco would rather that be without Harry’s atrocious ‘humour’.
Harry was fed up of extra work from Snape. Harry was fed up of leg cramps. Harry was fed up of taking the medication that tasted like sour milk.
“Well,” Hermione says, breaking through the silence in the room. “What brings you here today,  Harry? And with Prince Draco?” She asked politely.
“I should hope not. I would give you a detention but it seems that you would be unable to attend.” Tutted Snape, condescendingly.
Draco’s rage turns into fury. He may not like the arrangement he has with her, but he still considers her a friend.
“Maybe you can use the rest to hire a maid that will clean Harry’s mess of a flat. I’d be done for it my living area looked like this.”
“Have you seen Harry?” Ron asks, searching through the crowd that walks up the stairs that Draco had sneakily gone through.
Harry lifted his hand up, and slowly cupped Draco’s jaw with it. Draco looked up, sadness showing in his eyes.
They got to the corridor that split off in two directions, ready to say goodbye. Something stopped them before they could.
Draco drops the quill and rests his head into his hands, thinking about what to write to Celeste. Just something stupid, he decides. She doesn’t care. Well Draco certainly doesn’t, anyway.
“Well, me and him stayed friends. We weren’t in love, or anything, but I think at a time where we were desperate and lonely there wasn’t much else to turn to. But...” He chokes over his own words, breath hitching.
smile on his face. His eyes drift up to his hair, where Adelaide has plaited it down the middle. Draco hates it, but it’s the fancy attire that his father insists on.
He rolls onto his back, body nestled into the snow and looks at Harry. Things were definitely going to change.
“Granger, sire. Hermione Granger.” She smiled, still wary of Draco’s presence but not acting odd about it. Ron, on the other hand, stood red faced and bewildered.
“No, I mean, yes but it was only because you were so loud that I couldn’t get to sleep.” Malfoy explained.
Instead of leaving, Harry stays put. It’s only a couple of seconds until Draco starts to get impatient.
You may or may not have noticed the change from being rated ‘Mature’ to ‘Explicit’. I’ve never written (or posted) smut before, which is a problem all in itself, but it’s hard to discern the fine line between each rating. Explicitly mature? Maturely explicit?
He smiled, looking around. And then he saw Draco. He had missed his face, even though it had only been a couple days since he had seen him last. His eyes were red and strained and his posture was slouched as he sat down on the opposite side of the hall to harry. He looked up, saw Harry and held his head low.
“No, not today. I think he’s getting ready for the tournament.” Draco says, guiding them to where the rest of the entering guests are filtering through. The twelve o’clock bell chimes, and Draco knows he should be sitting in his chair in the arena.
Before Draco can muster up the courage and capture Harry’s lips in his own, Harry throws Draco into a large pile of snow. Draco scowls at him as Harry belly laughed, doubling up over himself. Draco couldn’t help but laugh too, and suddenly they were both in laughing fits, Harry trying to get Draco out of the snow but failing as his uncontrollable laughter comes back. Draco tries to ignore the pang in his heart at the fact that maybe Harry threw him because he didn’t want to kiss him.
Draco was caught by how stunning it looked. Not even the sword smith at the castle could create something as nice.
The beach was much like the lake. Draco could find peace without being disturbed. But Draco liked to run around on Juliet. He liked to feel the wind whipping through his hair. He liked to feel something.
“Draco.” Adelaide turned, her hand worriedly clutched around her hair. “Where have you been? Are you alright?” She said quietly, noticing Draco’s slumped posture and disheveled face.
“Come on, Adelaide, you know it’s a stupid idea. I’ll just have to get over it, there’s no way around it.”
“I love it.” He replied, turning back to look at the lake. “Lake James.” Harry bent down to pick up a small, flat stone. He rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger, before skipping it over the water with 5 littles bounces.
Instead of Adelaide being on the chair when he wakes up, it was Harry. The sun was setting, pink and gold tones highlighting his room. He must have slept for hours.
“Protecting me? Protecting me from what, Malfoy? Sirius? My godfather?” Harry questioned, knowing that Draco did mean well for him but showed it in the worst way possible.
Harry’s mouth raised into a smile, and he turned to Ron who was nodding in agreement and Hermione who had a small blush on her face.
“Oh come on, Ada.” He smiles, lacing up the boots. Although Adelaide was his maid, Draco treated her like a best friend. Adelaide was Draco’s honorary mother when Draco’s own had other duties to attend to. Although Lucius had disagreed with Draco’s mannerisms towards Adelaide, he never did anything about it, just letting her do as she pleases as long as she kept Draco alive. Draco learnt a lot from Adelaide, more than he had from his parents combined. She was there when he needed to talk to someone, which was something Draco was raised to never do. ‘No talking about you feelings. No showing empathy. Absolutely no emotions to be shown in-front of anyone. You are a Royal Prince, and you must act like one.’ Draco can hear clearly in his mind. Remembered the first time he was in trouble for stepping out of the guidelines. He had known Adelaide for nearly 11 years, and he doesn’t know what he would be doing now if she weren’t in his life.
Fuck his parents, fuck the castle, fuck the societal norms. Draco wants to kiss Harry Potter, and nothing was going to stop him.
“I mean...the booze was pretty great.” Daniel says quietly, so much so that Draco had to press his ear to the door to hear.
Draco wants to say, but the words are stuck behind his lips. He wants to scream his feelings for the other man, but at the same time he wants to lock them away and never have them resurface.
Below the excessive chainmail and green-on-green patterns, Harry wore slightly baggy black trousers, covered up halfway by dark leather boots.
Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s curls, biting his lip to stop a moan from escaping. He’s already hard, and Harry’s teasing is infuriating.
“Don’t talk about the things you don’t know, Draco.” Harry muttered, trying to will away the awkwardness by using his voice.
With every day that passes, Draco feels as though he loses himself more and more. That his freedom is slipping away at his fathers hands, and there’s nothing he can do about it.
“I’ll meet you at the small gates on the right before it begins. Harry will be thrilled to see you.” He said, and left.
“Ah, right...” Draco says. He doesn’t know where he got the idea in his head that Harry wasn’t a virgin, but it only made sense. Who wouldn’t want to?
will beat you in cards.” He addresses to the rest of the room. They all raise their eyebrows, but seem to take on the challenge. Draco supposes he’s pretty good, Adelaide had taught him everything he knows, and she’s great with games. He’s always won against Harry, too.
“He’ll have it.” He says, shoving it into Draco’s hands, which doesn’t turn out very well seeing as he’s holding a large stack of cards. They fall to the table and Draco realises he’s lost; they can all see his cards.
Draco hauled himself off the sofa, adjusting his tunic so that it was tucked loosely into his dark green trousers, and slowly made his way to Harry.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the idea of this place ever being called a home. The air was damp and cold, nothing like the castle’s.
“Don’t expect to come into my castle and act like you own the place. And I don’t get fed grapes, thank you very much.” Draco said defensively.
“Harry!” Draco screams, feeling his clothes soak through immediately. Harry’s doubled over in laughter. Draco had fallen victim to another one of his pranks.
Draco steps through the abandoned clothes as Harry guides them to the four-poster bed, kissing Draco languidly.
“Do you mind if we-“ Ron said quietly, pointing to the door. Harry nodded frantically and stood out of their way.
“I’ve got something for you, actually.” Harry says, running his hand over Draco’s head and pulling the hood down.
“Draco!” She shouts, “Celeste is arriving in ten minutes and your hair is a mess! What on earth did you do that for?”
Draco hadn’t known that either. Oh. Having no parents but still growing up to be strong. Well now he feels slightly bad. Only slightly, though.
“Draco?” Harry asks, dragging his bare feet through the shallow water. He’s utterly mad for paddling around in this weather. The dishwater grey ocean swathes around Harry, the level nearly reaching his cuffed trousers.
He glanced at Draco, who was facing in the direction of Harry. He still seemed to be sleeping. As he turned his attention back to his bed, he noticed a letter sitting by the table. It had no envelope but he could tell that it was from Sirius by the way he wrote and the rustic parchment the ink was on. He finished reading it, a smile on his face and picked up a new piece of parchment to reply to him. He was always so excited about Sirius’s letters coming in, it was the only thing in his life keeping him sane.
They stopped immediately when they saw Malfoy and Parkinson, and quickly made their way to Harry before Parkinson would start something like she always did.
“I’m sure your father would catch me out instantly. And it’ll only be a day! One day and then you can go back to your sulking.” She teased, plucking off a leaf that turned brown.
Draco feels selfish at wanting to keep Harry with him all the time. He doesn’t want Harry away from his family.
Rushing to the window, he flips the hatch frantically and is almost blinded by the biting cold. Squinting, he finds that there’s not another deadly battle, but a friendly game of sword-fighting. Draco exhales heavily and leans further out of the window, allowing him to access a better view. His intrigue immediately flares when he finds Harry being one of the two fighters, and he can’t help but smile as he watches Harry jab his sword playfully at Arthur. There’s a feeling of jealousy that flows through Draco at the sight, but then he remembers a conversation in passing about Arthur and his girlfriend.
The early morning light filters through the stained glass window, leaving splotches of colour dotted over the dark wooden pews. It’s a beautiful place to sit in, but he’s not as devotedly christian as his parents are.
“So do you have a thing for Weasley?” Draco choked out, lightly. He knows he doesn’t really mean it, but what else was there to say?
Pansy walked into the hospital, and laughed. “Well he’s in a little bit of a strop isn’t he?” She said as she made her way over to Draco, who had his back turned from her.
Draco is full from the dinner, where nothing eventful happened apart from his father boasting to Celeste and her father.
“Fuck.” Harry says, breathing heavily with his back on the mattress. Draco feels completely boneless, and it takes everything in him to lift himself up and off Harry and swing his leg over so that he’s lying next to him.
And with that he places his fingers onto Harry’s hip, and Harry sucks in a pained breath. Draco ran his fingers lightly around the red cut, smoothing the salve into Harry’s tanned skin.
“I never thought I’d be able to see these.” Harry’s eyes start watering. Draco pulls him into his chest.
“Shush, Draco.” His father hisses from a couple of rows down, and Draco hangs his head low and tries to focus on the prayers being said instead of focusing on the fact that Harry’s got his hand rested secretively on Draco’s thigh.
“You’re not actually a prick.” Ron murmured, before again releasing what he’d just said. “I mean- In the past- I didn’t think you were- I just-“
“You can watch Sir Potter fight. That’s got to be some sort of entertainment!” She tries optimistically and it snaps Draco out of his thoughts. “You’ve never seen him fight before, have you? It’ll be amazing! Harry Potter fighting in your castle!”
There’s a moment where something inside Draco clicks, and the heat is too much and the pressure so good that he can’t help but release, coming with a sob that rings out between them, before a similar sound echos from Harry.
“I was just going for a ride...are you okay?” He asks, concerned. Harry slides off of Romeo and leans against the side of him.
“No, sorry Professor.” Harry dropped his head. Why was Draco ignoring him. Why had he moved from his bed?
It’s been a long time coming for this, and now Draco’s trying hard to drink it all in. There’s so much of Harry, more than his lean body and unruly hair.
He could probably drag himself to his bedroom, but the thought of Harry still being in there sends something alarming through his body. His memory of last night comes back in bits and pieces, and now he’s stuck.
Harry didn’t know what to do with himself, he tried to crack his back but searing pain shot through his chest at each attempt. After twiddling his fingers for what felt like forever, his ears had latched on to the sound of Draco’s snores. They were soft and delicate, being a complete juxtaposition to his normal harsh tongue and loud wailing. He doesn’t know how Draco is still sleeping, as he was in the infirmary nearly as much as Harry was.
“I don’t know, he didn’t look great, but when-“ Draco begins, but is quickly stopped by a demanding voice:
Ron wiped little tears from his eyes, apparently finding the story hilarious. Draco thought that if he were there he’d understand just how god-awful Harry’s joke was, and then it led on to him thinking if he and Harry would ever have been friends if they knew each other then. Draco grimaced at the thought. No, they wouldn’t have, Draco was the Prince and Harry was just townsfolk. Besides, even if they did know each other, he was too busy getting married off to join in Harry and his friend’s fun.
Draco stared blankly for a second, caught off guard by Celeste’s name. The woman he was meant to love.
“I don’t know, something about ‘copying me’ I think.” Harry rolled his eyes and looked to where Malfoy lay with Parkinson craning over him, caring for him as if he were a child. He certainly acted like one.
“It’s my Father.” Draco said, quickly manoeuvred himself out of Harry’s grip and tugged them towards Juliet, trying to get away as fast as possible. Harry didn’t ask any questions, he didn’t really need to, and climbed back on to Juliet, gripping on to the dark leather. They went around the. group of men, far enough so that they couldn’t have been spotted and sped their way up back to the castle.
“I- I can’t help it.” Harry muttered softly. Seeing Draco look so dishevelled had made him feel bad, and he didn’t want to anger Draco further.
It’s not hard to figure where’d he’d got this sudden illness from. He suddenly feels cold at the thought of water.
“It’s a fantastic castle you have here, your highness.” Harry says, talking to Narcissa who sits opposite him. “The gardens are wonderful, do you tend to them?” Harry smiles, his tousled hair falling on his face.
“Ah, can I come in? I saw him walk...” Harry starts but stops as he sees Draco slumped on the edge of the bed, sniffling and biting his nails.
“Draco, the waters getting cold. You don’t want to fall ill.” Adelaide tutted, placing Draco’s clothes on the chair that sat by the bath.
Draco emerges out of the ethereal forest, taking in the stunning view of the castle in the sunlight. He watches as the maids and Guard Knights walk through the large gates that protect the castle. He gallops around the side, avoiding the sights of the people dotted around the grounds and heads towards the stables.
“I look at you, Draco. I think I’m the first person to ever properly do that.” He stumbles over the expensive velvet rug. “And when you go against the rules, you’re unstoppable.”
Harry coughed awkwardly at Ron’s last question, gesturing towards the hooded figure that Ron had not thought to be ominous at all.
“Yeah. My first royal tournament. Got to make it a good one.” Harry said, a challenging, wicked grin on his face.
Draco sits there for a while, pulling up little plants and tearing the leaves off, letting them float on the clear water. He picks up a large smooth stone, and attempts to skip it over the lake. The stone plops heavily into the water, misting up the water with the mud from the bottom of the lake. Draco watches as the water splashes and lands on Juliet’s peaceful sleeping face. She wakes up with a jolt, and Draco decides that he should head back, knowing his mother and father would be expecting him.
“Aren’t you going to, you know, take out a bunch of them. It’s only thirty gold pieces for a sword. Forty-five more for gems.”
“So it’s true then?” Draco suddenly said, taking Harry by surprise. Harry was too concentrated on his letter to see that Draco had sat up and watched him write.
“Hmm... I don’t know if I can.” Harry smirks. The white snow settles on Harry’s eyelashes, making his eyes glisten. Merlin, he is gorgeous.
“I honestly don’t know. One day it was all fine and I was excited for our marriage but then the next it just felt like it was never going to be enough. I’m just greedy. And ungrateful. I should be happy.” Draco says, wiping tears from his face.
Draco ran his hands through his hair and wiped the sweat from his forehead, the mid-august heat still humidifying the calm night.
“Okay, follow my lead. I stand back, you stand back. I turn anti-clockwise, you turn anti-clockwise. Got it?”
People see him as someone sharp and bold, but Draco knows he has so many layers underneath that. No one knows about his love for a certain knight apart from him. No one knows he writes books and enjoys thunderstorms apart from the very man his affections lie upon.
They went back the way they came, but Draco had something on his mind. He got as far as the path leading from the trees to the archway until he had to say it.
“No, no it’s fine. Don’t turn it off. I couldn’t sleep anyway.” Draco muttered, moving his pillow so that we was hugging it.
Draco followed Harry as he made his way down the line, taking in every detail as though he was being forced to remember it. Draco wasn’t really sure why Harry was intrigued, until he remembered. Harry didn’t know his family. It then took Draco back to the time when Harry wanted to know everything about Celeste, saying he wanted to know because he hadn’t had one himself. Draco would have once used these as a way to brag, but now he understood.
Draco sat alone in the hospital, trying to think of a way that he can tell Harry that he wanted to hold him. Wanted to kiss him.
“No, no.” Draco inhales,!trying to catch his breath. “I’ll do it, you sit back. It’ll only hurt worse if you start moving.”
“Oh.” Adelaide softly says. “Draco, what’s the matter? Has something happened with your Mother and Father?” She says, her breath wavering.
“Yeah, it was going around town. I tried to imagine how I would feel. I remember thinking just how happy you would have been.”
Harry put the small cup down and as he did the door shot open, and saw Draco Malfoy being shoved slowly by Madame Pomfrey, who rolled her eyes as Malfoy groaned profusely. He groaned even louder as he saw Harry sitting on one of the beds, watching as he walked in.
“The sword’ll be ready in 2 days, it’ll be in the usual pick up spot.” Ron said to Harry before turning to Draco. “Thank you, Prince.” He said, bowing. And then again.
“Draco?” Someone calls from behind him, and Draco jumps. He turns slowly from Juliet, and is relieved to find Harry on Romeo.
“Cedric Diggory.” Dumbledore announced. Harry stood up, shouting Cedric’s name along with his friends. He smiled and sat down, sighing to his friends in elation for Cedric and the rest of the competitors.
“You’d think I’d name a lake, private to basically only me, after my Father?” Draco asked, exasperated.
“Yeah?” Harry replied, slowly. There was a tone in Draco’s voice that Harry had never heard before. It sounded nervous and shy.
“You didn’t tell me you were scared of thunderstorms.” Draco says calmly, a hint of amusement coming through. It was rather funny, though. The ostensibly most bravest knight in his fathers land is scared of thunder. He also seems to be scared of admitting he’s scared of thunder.
He lifts his head to find his face centimetres away from Harry’s, their breath mixing and their gazes locked.
But he wasn’t fed up of Draco. He thought it would be the worst couple of days he’d have in his life. But he found it to be the best. What they had was sudden and unexpected, but Harry didn’t doubt his love for Draco one bit.
Draco wasn’t to show excitement, though. He was to act nonchalant around everyone. He had been raised that way, and it became second nature. Draco gives Romeo a handful of grass and makes his way to the castle, intent on finding out why famous Harry Potter was here.
“So, what lessons do we have today?” Asked Harry after a sudden burst of motivation had hit him from seeing Draco studying so hard.
“Yeah.” Draco called back, turning to see Harry behind him, his curly black hair flapping wildly behind him. The castle was near in sight and Draco lead them secretly to the stables, depositing Juliet.
Draco’s face was lit up by the sconces that were on either side of him. His face was hard, and he had his mouth clamped as if to stop it from trembling.
“That would be brilliant.” He smiled, and heard Draco faintly sigh. He hesitated for a second, and decided he was going to be a good person. Even if Ron would hate it.
Draco now felt kind of bad, making it seem like he was just so much better because he was so much richer. He began to frown, and he turned to Harry, who was smiling at him. Maybe money never made anyone happy. Ron and Hermione and the rest of them seemed to be doing fine by just simply sticking together. Draco smiled faintly back at Harry, and then turned to look at the two stricken people.
“Give it one more go, and if you don’t get it then I will just have to think there’s been a curse placed on you.”
When Harry woke up at 8am the next day, three large textbooks sat next to him on his bedside table. He saw Draco already writing his first essay of the day, and groaned at the thought of using his brain to write anything. He knew Snape would never go easy on him.
“What’re you going to do about it?” Draco seethed. He wanted to protect Harry. He didn’t want Ron in his way.
Harry’s lifts his head and unceremoniously takes Draco in. The smooth insides of Harry’s mouth slide wet and hot against Draco’s cock, eliciting dirty moans from his mouth.
“I get it.” Harry says faintly, and gathers the small amount of belongings he had brought to the hospital with him. He was allowed to leave by that time anyway.
Soon after, they’re both back to their comfortable selves, Harry sifting his fingers through the golden sand. It’s cold, but Draco doesn’t mind.
“Together.” Harry repeats with a nod. “I know that now we’re together, we’re going to have to keep a lot of secrets. And I know that you’ll have to convince your parents that you’re in love with Celeste, and whatever happens between you and her tonight doesn’t bother me. I know you have to do it.”
“My bet is soon, he’ll manipulate you until it falls off.” Draco scoffed, now feeling anger at his Father that he could have had a normal life with normal friends like Ron and Hermione.
Draco looks around him, but the stables are empty apart from himself and the 4 other horses. Draco pulls Juliet into her stable, keeping a watchful eye on Romeo. He couldn’t believe it.
“I hope you don’t mind that I put Romeo in the stables, I can assure you that he doesn’t bite.” Harry says excitedly, taking in the beautiful architecture of the castle as he walks behind Draco.
“Shut up.” Harry says, with finality, and keeps his eye contact with Draco as he places his wet fingers on Draco’s opening.
“Draco...” Harry whispers into the charged air between them, but he can’t say any more, because Draco’s mouth has crashed onto his.
“Some of us aren’t naturally gifted.” Draco replies sternly, crossing his arms and feeling childish. He has to stop himself from stamping his foot.
They go backwards and forwards, Harry lifting his sword and slashing it sideways and the other man defending himself by holding his sword outwards.
Draco picked up the spoon he was using from his bowl, showing to Harry that ‘this is the right spoon, you pillock’ and ‘it’s the one that isn’t the size of my fucking palm.’
to warm to Draco, their initial reluctance now gone. They find his witty jokes funny, and Draco can’t help but laugh along at their teasing and at just how abysmal some of them are at playing simple games. There an electricity between all of them, sparking as the game heats up and it’s only broken by the sound of Harry arriving back. They all look at him, giddy grins growing even wider at the stash that Harry has managed to carry back.
Draco sat on his bed, his legs curled up against his chest. His new found friendship with Harry was now finally catching up on him, and he had realised that his friends in Slytherin would ridicule him for having a decent conversation with his ‘enemy’. He used to think the same as them. He used to think that Harry was a snobby brat who got whatever he wanted. Who has girls at his feet. Who has loving friends who care for him. And he hated it.
“Okay.” Harry smiled and turned back to the book. He honestly thought it would be one of the most boring things on the earth, but Hermione had obviously picked something that would spark interest in Harry and he was intrigued from the first page.
Harry breaks the searing kiss, licking his lips greedily and slowly drags his tongue down Draco, taking time to kiss his sternum, his stomach and the soft skin just above his waistband.
Fuck. Draco had blushed. Hard. And now Harry was blushing. He wanted Draco to know he liked it when he looked at him like that. And he liked when Draco had wrapped around him. He wanted to wrap around Draco too. He wanted to kiss him.
By the time lunch with his father’s nobles is over, Draco is exhausted. There is only so much conversation with sour-faced pricks he can handle.
It’s just the way Harry stands, with dark curly hair pulled back into a small ponytail at the back of his head, or the way the chain mail fits snug around his muscles, or how the dark green fabric of the tunic makes his emerald green eyes shine in a way that even Draco can see from where he’s sitting.
“Yes, Mother.” Draco nods and turns his attention back to Harry, who is smiling. Draco stares for a second, captivated by Merlin knows what, and then turns to the door, signalling with his head for Harry to follow.
“What’s the point of dancing with someone if you don’t even touch them? You just turn in circles with your forearms one-hundred metres away until one of you passes out of from being dizzy.” Harry sulks, losing the rhythm of the dance.
At dinner, Harry sits opposite Draco, with both Narcissa and Lucius on either side. They looked like they could be a happy family, if only Harry had been less tanned and had platinum blonde hair.
Draco woke up early the next morning. He dreaded leaving the bed, knowing what the day was to bring. From his diamond paned window he could see crowds already gathering outside the castle, trailing all the way down the towering stone stairs and through the iron gates.
As you can tell I have not posted a new chapter in a while. I’ve had a couple comments asking to carry on writing and I think i’m finally out of my writing slump so i will be updating soon!!!!!
“Oh calm down...Draco’s actually alright.” He says, giving everyone a reassuring smile and squeezing him tighter. Draco can only nod, still very apprehensive. The things he does for this man...
“Is that me?” Harry asks, until he looks at the woman next to the man that looks scarily like him. “My parents...” He whispers faintly, pressing down a peeling bit of canvas from the corner, revealing their names.
Harry held his head in his hands until he felt something fall on his lap, and noticed that Draco had flew one of his special quills over to Harry. Harry moved his hands from his eyes and smiled softly.
Celeste squeezes her hand right around Draco’s bicep, and he’s about to say something to please her before the heavy doors swing open in front of him, revealing the ‘couple’ to the guests at the bottom of the staircase, all waiting in imposing dresses and grandiose cloaks on the ballroom floor.
Draco’s face was blank all day, and he was hidden under an emotionless mask. Harry couldn’t tell how Draco was feeling and it was killing him inside.
Draco suddenly gets flashes of when Harry was last studying him, when there were generous beams of green light shining through the picture window. Before, Harry was hesitant and shifted uncomfortably, but now, resting on a very expensive piece of furniture, his arms are spread out and he gazes admiringly. Every time Draco’s eyes drift to his, he has to snap them away before something disastrous happens.
That was a stupid question, he tells himself. He’s inexperienced, sure, but it’s not like he doesn’t want it.
“Draco, where are you going?” He slurs, his eyes falling heavy. Draco slams the door shut and turns to walk to his library. Before he clips down the hallway, he lets his thoughts control him and slips to the floor. Draco would be so excited if Harry had said this with meaning, but the unstable posture and forward words had made him feel utterly embarrassed. He felt like a joke.
This chapter contains some minor graphic descriptions of gore, please be careful :) It’s nothing too bad I promise!
He knocked on the door to the first back room, hoping and praying that Ron would be the one to answer so he could avoid drawing attention from the rest of the red-heads. But things never really went the way Draco wants them too, so when the door opened after a second of waiting, an older women with striking ginger hair answered, and her mouth completely dropped.
“I know what happened that day, I remember Ada telling me about it. Everyone was happy, including my Father. Was the reason why you came to my castle because you wanted safety?”
“You can come in, Adelaide.” Draco called, rearranging his position on the sofa. Adelaide had said that he couldn’t change much now, and she was right. But that didn’t stop her from losing all hope on Draco. She payed him even more visits just to see how he was and helped him write a letter to Celeste when he was uninspired to do so.
“You’d better close that window before you get a cold, Draco.” Adelaide said to him later that night, finding him in the same position on his bed that she had left him in.
Even in their shared potions lesson, Draco wasn’t vocal at all. Professor Snape was even surprised when Draco hadn’t spat any insults in his class.
“Like what?” Draco said, baffled, because if he were a Knight with a hip problem he wouldn’t like to be in a castle working for a snobby young adult who could behead him in a blink of an eye.
“No, I insist.” Draco said, vaguely remembering saying that to Harry when he was teasing him. Now he was helping him.
“I didn’t tell him!” Draco replies back , just as wildly. “He came into my room last night all drunk and telling me so much confusing shit!”
“Well, yeah. It’s fun to be mischievous, and watching your face when you get nervous is quality entertainment.”
“Sorry.” Harry said sheepishly, turning the corner to make his way to his sleeping chambers. “Have fun with your letter.” Harry smiled, it not quite reaching his eyes. Draco missed the full, teeth-bearing, full lipped smile that he had seen not even ten minutes ago.
Draco stood back as Harry hugged his friends goodbye, and then walked out of the room, making Draco walk swiftly behind.
Those words. Those three words. ‘Of course I’m not. My Father arranged my marriage when I was fourteen. I had no choice. I’m not fucking happy.’ Draco thought to himself.
“Would you liked to be held in a cell with nothing but water to live off?” Draco said condescendingly, bewildered at Harry’s little knowledge about how things had worked in the castle.
“Don’t be sorry.” He says, pulling his hands and himself away from Harry. He looks completely dejected. “Why didn’t you wake me sooner?”
“Hey, I’m more than just a pretty face.” He grins. Draco rolls his eyes. “And with...with Celeste. Just because you’re being given something that’s supposed to make you happy doesn’t mean that you should force yourself to feel that way. Love is complicated, for gods sake! Did you know that Ron and Hermione liked each other for years before they admitted to their feelings? It’s not something that should be handed to you by your parents.”
“Ha, of course Harry Potter, the chosen one, needs his beauty sleep. How else would he maintain his beautiful looks?” Draco said, trying to sound sarcastic but sounding painfully honest. He stopped talking before he could say anything more.
Sebastian is shaking his head at an invisible fault and stepping around Draco’s wooden stand to grab his tape measure. It’s taking all that’s in him to try not to stumble and sway. He’s so easily persuaded...
“Allow me.” Hermione said, swiftly moving around in front of Harry and letting him and Draco walk past.
“Killing their head knight was supposed to end it all, but now I think it’s your family that they want to get revenge on.”
Draco lead Harry through a small passageway that edged around the large entrance gates and the moat of the castle. Harry stopped as they were walking over a dainty bridge that connected an arched hallway to the start of a winding path that snaked around large oak trees. He watched the small ripples that the fish left and cooed over the little ducklings that swam around after their mother.
Ron opened a second door, leading to a  confined area containing a desk and a chair, with parchments covering the whole of the available surface.
Harry snorts and wraps it around Draco’s naked body, yanking the hood down over his eyes. He remembers when he and Harry had first gone into the village together, walking through the surrounding forest and Harry messing around with him. They’re still the same, except Draco is now far less dressed and a lot more infatuated.
About an hour into the ball, Draco finds himself leaning against a table, one that has a champagne fountain conveniently placed on top.
His squirming stops as his face comes up close to Harry’s, his lips twitching in a sense of need, and Harry’s eyes turned from playful to lustful.
Draco fiddled with the ruffles at the end of his tunic, trying to find a reason he should stay in but ultimately gave up. He was 18 now, he should be allowed some freedom. He didn’t always have to be controlled by his father.
Harry felt Draco’s breath against his neck, and he got goosebumps all over. Draco wanted to be next to him. Right next to him. He felt a thin arm snake around his torso, and he reached up to hold Draco’s hand in his. He wanted to check if this was real. Wanted to see if this was another nightmare. But it was more like a dream.
“I can’t wait to start seeing you more.” Celeste says excitedly as she stands, making her way back to the floor with Draco not far behind. He’s starting to feel a bit weary now, his social battery completely drained, but he feels as though he’s done it.
“It’s just weird.” Hermione said, before her face dropped in horror. “I mean- Malfoy- not that Prince Draco is weird, of course not, it’s just him being here. And his Father letting him out the castle.” She added, not looking towards Draco.
Draco rolls his eyes, his mood worsening. Harry runs up, catching Draco by the wrist. It hurts, but it also feels fantastically good.
They soon fell asleep, the only sound coming from the hospital was their faint snores, contempt in each other’s presence.
He’s never once liked Christmas. Not even the one year when he was given Juliet. His father uses it as a way to be flashy, to bring together people that would rather be anywhere else. Thankfully there aren’t any dances, but the gaudy decorations are just as bad.
“Fifty points from Gryffindor.” Snape stated, and then stopped to consider. “And Slytherin.” He left the hospital, leaving the two boys in silence.
“How did you even know you were going to be in here today?” Harry smirks. Draco scowls. “You sly bastard.”
“No, we’re not allowed. Rules state that we’re too far from the castle to be accepted entrance, and he have hardly no status at all.”
Instead of trying to fit another word in, as he always does, he just picks up a sword he’d lain on the ground and presses it into Draco’s palm. Draco shoots him a quizzical look, and Harry smiles.
Molly immediately went to the office door, poking her head in and shouting under her breath. Draco recalled that Molly hadn’t been there on his first visit, and probably heard about his sighting as she arrived back.
“I’ll get it.” Draco said, shrugging. He’d never and will never have a problem with money. In fact, he felt like he had too much that he didn’t know what to do with it.
Before they could reach the start of the forest, Harry’s hip began to hurt. Draco didn’t really know what to do, seeing as he hadn’t experienced Harry in this type of pain before. Harry brushed it off and told Draco to keep walking, but Draco refused, not wanting to be responded for the death of Sir Potter. Draco changed their route, making a stop to the stables. Harry said hello to Romeo, stroking his face and feeding him grass, then clambered onto Juliet, who Draco had hauled out and prepared with a double-saddle.
His thoughts stop, and he realises with a sigh that he’ll never make Harry happy. He could never fulfil Harry’s hopes and dreams, because he had too many responsibilities. He leaned in and pressed his forehead to Harry’s, and when Harry leaned in to try and kiss him, Draco drew back. He wanted to apologise, but it was stupid. It was all his stupid fault because he couldn’t make up his stupid mind to risk everything for stupid Harry Potter. Not that Harry was stupid, god he was brilliant, but Draco’s parents were stupid and the castle was stupid and societal norms were stupid. And that made Draco stupid. And it didn’t help that he really likes Harry Potter. And that’s why he cant kiss him. It’s all too confusing for Draco and he feels a headache start up. He looks back at Harry, who’s face is sullen.
Harry found the right spoon in the assortment of others, and picked it up. Draco slowly and exaggeratedly dipped his spoon into the stew, acting like he was teaching a child. Harry chuckled and rolled his eyes, scooping one mushroom instead of four onto the spoon and lifting it graciously- or what as gracious as possible for him- to his mouth. Draco nodded courteously and returned to his own meal, before there was a slopping and mashing of teeth and Draco looked back to Harry, who had his mouth open, broken up mushroom obvious in his mouth. Narcissa looked away from her hushed conversation with Lucius and gave a small but conventional glare at Harry, and then an even deeper and darker one at Draco. Draco slumped his shoulders, giving up hope. He gave another kick, heavier this time, to Harry’s shin, opening his mouth, shutting it the next second. Harry nodded, and the next time he ate it was far better than the first attempts.
I’m on a roll with chapters, this is my third one and I released chapter 1 exactly 24 hours ago! Let’s hope my motivation will stay like this haha.
“Potter, the ball is in two days and you’re telling me now that you can’t dance? You can’t be saved, you’ll just have to make a fool of yourself.” Draco smirks and shrugs his shoulders cheekily.
Maybe one day it will be. Admittedly, he would have to own it alongside Celeste, but if Harry continued to work for the royals than he really wouldn’t mind at all. He smirks at the thought of having a door connected between both his and Harry’s rooms, and telling Celeste that he’s ‘just going to the loo’ but really sneaking off to have risky but thrilling escapades with the person he truly wanted to be with.
“Flattering.” Draco scowled. If he was his Father, he wouldn’t put his son through a marriage for the sake of carrying on the Malfoy bloodline. “What are you doing?”
“Nope.” He groans loudly. He kicks the rest of the small pile of stones in the water and drops on a grassy patch on the floor. It feels nice on his back and he lets it calm him down. Getting a temper over not being able to skip a rock, if only his father could see...
“Ah, Malfoy, my boy.” Pierre said, even though Draco’s known him all his life and there wasn’t a need for the use of last names. Draco had just concluded that Pierre was like that, eccentric and charmingly odd.
His mother and father come up to him frequently, asking Celeste about her well-being and her time so far in the land. For once, his parents look proud of him.
“Will you shut up about bloody Sir Potter!” Draco snaps, turning his head away from the terrified woman that stands at the end of his bed.
“Fine.” Harry forces a smile. He’s not angry, Draco knows, but there’s something about him that’s sharp and intimidating today.
Harry parts Draco’s legs, spreading them wide and hooking his knees on his lower back. They’re doing this, then.
They both flop down onto the four-post, Draco on-top of Harry, and instead of going back to kissing, Draco lets out a great yawn into the bedsheets.
Her cheeks blush, and she threads an arm through his. “I’ve been wonderful, actually. My father had spoilt me this year for Christmas, even though I insist on not having any more presents. They do honestly still think I’m nine years old!” She laughs.
“I mean, Pomfrey said that you’ve broken 15 bloody bones and got a concussion, not to mention you can’t bloody see and also broke your bloody firebolt.”
Harry froze. How had Draco found out? Did Ron and Hermione come up earlier and say something? But how? They didn’t know, as he never told anyone. Apart from Sirius. Harry’s face morphed from shocked to angry as he realised that Draco read Sirius’s letter.
“You too, Muriel.” Draco laughs at the neighs that Muriel, Narcissa’s treasured deep-brown horse, creates when she is in need of attention. The two horses tower above him, and he pulls up some grass from outside and lets them eat it from his hand.
Draco slowly makes his way through the dark palace, walking past rooms filled with expensive furniture and valuable collections. Draco lives on the west wing of the castle, where he has his own private study, bathroom and library. He chose the west wing because it gave him an unobstructed view of the castle’s gates, and Draco liked to watch people’s as they lived their lives, hoping that he’ll one day be as free as them. The rooms were decorated in dark green and black, and the library was the size of a small house containing a large fireplace that Draco normally found himself sitting in front of late at night. Anything to escape reality, really.
Draco braced himself for disaster. “You might want to step back, I’m really horrible at this.” Harry did as was bid, and watched as Draco swung his arm back and propelled the pebble into the air. It splashed against the surface, and sunk with a glug.
Draco just rolled his eyes and let Pierre get on. Before Pierre could add even a stroke of paint to the canvas, there was a light knock at the door.
“You’re always worrying about the future!” Harry sighs, swaying back and forth into Draco’s personal space.
Draco looks at where the sound comes from, and finds Harry standing behind the dining hall’s doors with two swords in his hands.
“Just wanted to see if you were busy. I was going to ask about a book in your library but you’d have to be there to answer.”
As he looks back to Harry, he can see the stars reflected in his eyes, like a mirror. Draco presses his lips against his, the eyes getting bigger as they get closer. Every angle is as beautiful as the last.
“Adelaide I-“ Draco sobbed, his face planted into Adelaide’s shoulder. She gripped his arm and moved him onto the edge of bed, where she could hold an arm around him.
Draco doesn’t say anything to that, just kisses him. Harry puts his arms on either side of Draco’s head and kisses back.
“I have sodding dance rehearsals for the ball.” He replies hurriedly, waking up Juliet and pulling her up.
“It’s all so exciting, isn’t it?” She says with alacrity, but keeps a calm face. “I’ve been waiting for this day for so long.”
“Fine,” Malfoy grunted, “I saw you get injured while you were flying and I tried to show my friends that the trick you did was easy, but now I understand that it’s not. Happy?” He said, unwillingly admitting to his actions.
All of the heads turn to him, familiar faces bewildered at his presence. Draco freezes, incapable of moving any further.
“It’s just...” Harry starts, takes a deep breath and carries on “God, it always leads back to that night, doesn’t it?”
Draco feels on the verge of tears. He’s only adding fuel to the fire. He can’t help it, though. He undeniably feels something for Harry.
“Don’t worry about it, Draco. As much as your father is a horrible man, he’s horrendously good at protecting the land and the people in it.”
It’s childish, but as soon as Celeste turns away to walk back, he wipes his mouth on his sleeve, rubbing away the strange taste.
“Ah, Draco. Where have you been?” Narcissa ushers Draco in as he stands at the door of the solar room. The room is covered in square wood panels and had large muntin bar windows across one side of the room. There was a large oak wood bench in the middle, with candles running all the way down and three drinks sitting on the edge. At the table, sat Lucius Malfoy and Sir Harry Potter.
“It’s difficult.” Draco releases on a sigh, squeezing tight. “There’s a lot that I have to live up for...”
They finished their meal in relative silence, Lucius informing Harry about the tournament because Draco hasn’t bothered to do it himself.
Adelaide visibly reclines, searching Draco’s face for any hint of the whole admittance being a joke.
He adjusted his grip on Juliet and breathed in. He was already feeling a lot better. Things were changing in his life. Things he couldn’t control.
“I’d like that very much,” He says between little pecks, “but I think people would notice if the main focus of the night had disappeared.”
Harry said bye to Ron and Hermione after they had talked a while about the triwizard tournament name picking that was happening in a weeks time.
It’s not really dancing, though. Harry has his hands wrapped around Draco’s waist, swaying them in small circles around the edges of the garden. Draco presses his face against Harry’s neck, his lips resting on a small mole.
“You’re the only person who I’d show them to.” He states confidently, earning a warm smile from Harry.
Draco sinks slowly onto Harry, the tight heat back again, but it slowly dissipates into bliss. Harry’s guiding him by his waist, lowering him down and lifting himself up, hitting Draco in a spot which rips a moan out of him.
“I know, but- well. I don’t know! It’d be nice to know someone in the castle.” Harry shrugs his shoulders in exasperation.
Harry wanted to know. He wanted to know if it meant something to Draco. Or if he was just an experiment. Someone Draco could test on. To prod and poke and tease, to find a reaction. To get an answer and move on.
Harry made it to the furthest wall in the gallery, and came to a dead stop. Across the whole wall were portraits of Draco from one years old to seventeen. Pierre was putting up the next one tomorrow.
Harry doesn’t reply, all that was coming out of his mouth was faint and whispered ‘no,no,no,no’s. Draco watches as Harry turns around and flashes a bright grin, making Draco’s heart falter and his body freeze. Harry’s smile drops as Draco stands still, and Draco knows he has to seize the moment.
Suddenly, Draco’s put in Harry’s shoes, coming out to someone and not knowing how they’d react. Although Draco had only been hours into his realisation, he feels like he’s known all his life.
“I heard Harry was here.” She smiled, before her moving eyes landed on Draco. The basket of bread that she carried fell to the floor, along with her jaw.
Some of the customers turned at the mans yell, and their eyes had widened in astonishment at Harry’s presence.
Draco pushed Ron’s arm away as he was lowered into the bed, and the action was followed by Ron calling him a git.
Harry let out a soft sigh as Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, still keeping his lips on Harry’s.
“Just tell him your hips seizing up and pray that he will let you off.” Draco shrugs, wishing he could be more help.
“I have so many questions! How’s the castle? Are the bedrooms nice? Is Draco Malfoy actually as snooty as they say?”
“Ah, absolutely. Bill made it no long ago, it’s one of our best ones yet.” Ron said and rushed out the room.
“Good.” Harry softly smiled. He yawned and settled back down, but he didn’t turn away from Draco this time. He had nothing to hide from the other boy and felt as though his presence was a benefit to his healing. As he lay flat on his back, the thought of sleeping had left his mind. After sleeping for most of the day he thought that it would be best to stay up, so that he could have a longer rest the next night.
The late October air gusts through Draco’s open window, and sends a flurry of golden leaves with it.
Draco realises that what they’re missing now is adrenaline. They’d been running on it all of yesterday, the wild energy of showing their hidden skeletons. But now, neither of them knew where they lay.
Harry hugs the book close to his chest, and Draco has never wanted him more. Every time he feels like this, he has to remind himself why he couldn’t have him. All the obstacles in the world.
“Join Draco, Narcissa and I for dinner, won’t you? You’ve been great company at breakfast and I’m sure the Knights table in your chambers gets boring after a while.” Lucius said, walking closer to where Harry was standing.
“Then I’ll be responsible for your death!” Ron shouted, before calming down after Hermione placed her hand on top of his.
Harry’s eyes widened in something like realisation, but he didn’t say anything else, only moving along to the next painting.
“Prince Draco! You were here the other day! You and Harry!” She said, and the other gingers started to peer over the work tables at the woman’s commotion. She seemed excited at his presence, although Draco wasn’t really favoured amongst most townsfolk. Maybe this woman was just genuinely nice.
“Harry...” He hears someone to the left of him whisper. He glances out of the corner of his eye and it’s... Christopher he supposes. He’s never really cared for knowing the people who defend his castle, but due to Harry’s influence he’s keen to learn. “Why’ve you brought the Prince to our lounge?” Christopher eyes Draco as he speaks.
As Draco left the room, he paused to pull a thick fabric tunic over his dress shirt, the rest of the castle freezing in comparison to the warm and cozy room. Although the door was shut, he could still here faint talking.
“You’re going to have to up your sneaking out game, Draco. If your Father finds out I’d expect for you to be grounded for eternity.”
Draco leaned forward and tugged the reins back, causing her to start a fast gallop. The wind picked up at that moment, and Draco revelled in the way it made his clothes flap and skin cold.
“Your eyes, it looks like you’ve been crying.” Hermione sympathetically said, and Draco whipped his head around so he could see Harry’s face.
The trees opened into the mossy clearing, and then they could see the expanse of the glimmering lake.
Both Harry and Draco had been in the infirmary for over 48 hours. So much and so little has changed.
“Oh shush, you. I’ve made you tea and set out some parchment. It’s all in your study. Does my hair look okay?” She asks, swishing the long braid of ashy blonde back and forth.
Even though he trusts Adelaide with anything, he thinks he should leave it a while before she should know what’s going on. He can already hear the upcoming lecture, even if she doesn’t have a problem with them being together.
Draco dropped his head into his hand, trying to hold back a groan at how appallingly horrible Harry was at being formal. Narcissa just watched, delicately spooning the hot liquid into her mouth, trying to avoid saying something. Lucius just shuffled in his seat, bristling at how inappropriate eating dinner like that was. Harry looked up after loudly swallowing his food, and a striking red blush appeared on his cheeks. Draco inched his leg forward and gave a discreet kick to Harry’s leg. Harry only shrugged back, directing with his hands to Draco’s own food, indicating that he show him. Lucius just struck up a conversation with Narcissa, obviously trying not to say something and offend his guest.
He’s only just remembered, realised. Adelaide had told him he’d be proud of himself when the sky turns pink, but he’d never really believed her.
“Draco, there’s a letter here for you.” Adelaide presents it to Draco at his breakfast table. He sits outside, breathing in the warm late August air. The beating sun reflects on his silver embellished tunic and turns his porcelain skin a beautiful golden shade. The castle grounds are serene and quiet, the only sound the clanking of the Guard Knights armour and the sound of Adelaide, Draco’s maid, cutting up a loaf of crunchy rye bread.
“Yeah, sure.” He replies with a small smile before turning, setting out to find Adelaide and harass her into running the hottest bath she can.
The grand doors to the ballroom loom over him, and Draco spares them a wary glance before he’s pulled through them.
Draco was being unfair. Totally and completely unfair. He always told Adelaide his struggles and concerns, because she would listen. She would hold his hand and make him tea and nod as if anything Draco is worked up on makes sense. But this was beyond having a problem with the demanding duties of a Prince, this time it was all Draco’s fault. He had no one to blame but himself. He could blame his Father for putting him into a betrothal, but Draco was the one that decided it wasn’t enough. He was such a naive teenager. He regrets it all but there’s nothing he can do. He has to please the King.
“Just open it!” Harry says, moving to sit cross legged and openly there, and not feeling ashamed at all.
“Can we stay here forever?” Draco asks, tentatively touching Harry’s torso as if he needed permission. He doesn’t want to move too fast, to scare off the man he’s wanted for a while.
“Right.” Harry says abruptly, and before he knows it, Draco is being carried back through the gardens. “Don’t want you freezing.”
“What did you do then, Sir Harry? I saw it was your day off.” Lucius said, pushing his wooden bowl forward so that a maid could fill it with mushroom soup. It looked that a brown mush, but as Draco got his serving and had tried it, the mushrooms burst in his mouth, and it was deliciously salty.
“Hello, Celeste.” He says, holding an elegant hand out to help her down the carriage steps. She’s dressed in a bold forest green dress, her dark hair almost a shawl around her shoulders. The unforgettable blue eyes shimmer in the light, and crease in the corners from the wide smile Celeste has on.
Draco looked up and his deep grey eyes glowed with the help of the midday sun. He scowled intently, before a smile cracked on his face.
Harry smirks and shuffles forward, and Draco’s arm somehow instinctively goes around his waist. He could get used to this.
Later in the day, after Draco has written a slightly insincere letter to Celeste and finished reading nearly 2/3 of his book about adventures, he finds himself sitting on the large sofa in his library. His life was peaceful when Lucius was out. It gave him freedom. Well, freedom in the castle. There were no looks of disappointment, and when there were, Draco prepared for them. Although Lucius had allowed Draco to not take up becoming a Knight, he never supported Draco in doing much else. He was his son, but he was also a Prince. There is and always has been a level of class that they need to withhold, and Lucius is not about to risk losing his elite title because of Draco’s disinterest in what is expected of him. Lucius found himself shutting Draco away from the public eye, in hopes that they don’t see a sad excuse for nobility. When Draco was seen publicly, he was sharp and disagreeable. And this was all Lucius’ doing.
“Looks great.” He says slowly, seemingly finding the amount of buckles on Draco’s waistcoat unnecessary. Apparently there’s hope in Harry’s clothing taste.
Arthur glances back at him a couple of times on their way to the room, and then quickly diverts his attention back to harry, shooting him a wary look.
Harry does, and it takes a long time for the shaking to stop and for his breathing to be at a normal pace.
He’d like to stay up and look at Harry for a bit, but his eyes are drooping slightly and his body’s already halfway asleep. He tries to say something to Harry but it just comes out in sleepy mumbles.
“Thank you.” Draco replies, taking the compliment. He can feel Harry’s watch on his back as he walks in-front of him, but he still moves with purpose. After a minute of silence, apart from the sounds of Draco’s and Harry’s swishing fabric, Draco decides to speak.
A knight— Daniel—fetches some glasses from a cabinet in the corner of the room and another— Henry— dishes the first lot out. Draco is offered a tumbler of whiskey from Monty (he’s getting very good with their names) and politely declines. Monty is almost about to pass it on but Harry swoops in and grabs it, plonking himself back next to Draco.
“Why is everything in this castle green?” Harry asks, standing in the doorway and watching as Draco slowly unclasps the buckles in front of the mirror.
Draco’s heart flutters. And then sinks. He knows that Harry has feelings towards him. But what did he say only days prior? ‘Don’t tell Harry how you feel and don’t try to start anything with him.’
It should be weird, the amount of time he spends just looking at Harry. He should find it weird. But he doesn’t.
“How’s your Christmas been then, Draco?” Celeste asks, turning to face him on the bench they’re sat on. She’s wearing a ruby red dress, and Draco’s in the usual dark green.
They stop at the stone wall next to the doors, the music louder now and voices filtering through the cracks.
“Harry, what is it?” Draco says faintly as he stands up to move towards the door. Harry stays upright for a split second before falling into Draco’s chest.
At this time he’d ask Harry to come to his room, like he’d been doing for the past four days, but Harry has a job and a responsibility. He’s probably being heroic and fearless, the bastard. Draco’s not worried, though. Harry’s capable of conquering whatever comes his way.
It’s far too cold to be by the seafront, so he chooses to go down the path in the forest. It could hardly be called a forest, this time of year. The trees are bare and the usual lush green bushes are brown and withering, suffering under the thin layer of ice and snow.
“Don’t apologise,” Harry smiles, his eyes crinkling in the corners “But you need a break, it’s not going to help if you work yourself up about it.” He offers. Then he stands, pulling Draco off from his seat and making him follow. Harry stands at the waters edge, face turned into the wind. Draco steps next to him, his arms folded over himself.
“I do. But now I think he’s given me motivation to fight for what I believe in and to do things that make me happy even though other people may not like it. I think he wouldn’t want me to be sad about his death, and now I guess I look back on our time together with happy nostalgia. It was so hard losing a friend so close. I tried to stop the battle before they could get to him, but I was stabbed in the hip, and then tha-“
“That’s why you’ll be big competition this year. Sir Potter fighting in my castle, how enthralling!”
“I’m having dinner with Hermione and Ron’s family later, but I thought I’d come and see you before I left. I’m staying at my old place that night, so I won’t see you until boxing day.”
“Harry?” Draco whispers, spotting a fatigued Harry at his door. His hand is clenching over his right hip and he’s wincing in pain.
“Ah, Adelaide.” Draco says turning into his room. “Harry Potter needs you to take him on a tour of the castle. I’m sure you two will get along, you both are very talkative.”
His hands snake up to Draco’s belt buckle, the intricate fastenings of the leather nothing compared to Harry’s growing urgency.
Things could be completely different by then, a random twist of fate. He smiles at the idea of him and Harry living a happy life somewhere far away, but it’s completely ridiculous. Nothing could change the inevitable. He’s certain of that.
It was addressed to Harry, but it had taken Draco’s interest. He turned the envelope around to find that the letter was sent by Sirius Black. He gasped quietly at the name, but he was more concerned as to why Sirius was sending Harry a letter.
As soon as Celeste leaves, with another kiss, he pulls Juliet out of the stables and rides straight into the village, heading directly to the Weasley’s shop.
“Alright, then.” Harry accepts the hand, letting go far later than was really necessary. Not that Draco minded.
“I’ve got a present for you, too.” He says, standing up and glad he has the cloak on to cover himself. He’s not nearly as muscular as Harry.
“Lift?” Harry smirks sheepishly. As much as he would like to pretend, Draco does not mind at all that Harry is sitting so close.
“Ron, leave him alone he’s obviously in pain.” Hermione said, defending Draco as he sat with vulnerability on his bed.
“I’ll take it down with us.” Adelaide says subtly, noticing Draco’s words. “Come on, Sir Harry, I have yet to show you the best part!” She laughs excitedly and shuts the door, leaving Draco alone in the room and in his thoughts.
“Right, up you get and out of those clothes before they get creased!” She demands, tugging at his arm imperatively.
Draco waits as Harry pulls the heavy oak door shut and then quickly makes his way through the small corridor until they’re back into the main hallways.
“Leave him be, Sebastian.” Draco replies, with the same level of drawl. Harry lowers his head, sporting the usual ill-concealable grin.
He thought he did. Even though their friendship was sudden and weird, Harry thought that Draco could trust him. Would trust him. But what does trust mean anymore? Harry has to now trust Draco with his biggest secret, one that he has to keep from everyone, including his best friends. Would he have told Draco anyway? Would their friendship have progressed in that way?
Draco slides his hand down Harry’s body, feeling the chill on his palms, and then his hand meets something hard tucked into Harry’s waistband. He pulls out a dagger, holding the heavy blade in his hand.
Draco groans, planting his face in Harry’s shoulder. “Now Adelaide will have to do it again. You don’t understand, Harry,” Draco says in mock-horror, “It’s painful.”
Draco pulls his duvet over Harry, shoves his pillow under his head and prods the wood in the fire so that the flames brighten up again.
Draco felt a surge of rage claw at his insides. Harry was having fun, swaying around half-inebriated and giddy, but somewhere inside Draco hurt at the knowledge that this was only happening because Harry was drunk.
“She’s not a bitch.” He says through clenched teeth, pulling himself further up the bed as Harry moves closer.
The front of the shop was empty, and Harry and Draco managed to get from the building to behind the tavern without being seen.
“Oh.” Harry’s eyes light up, and a thrill runs down Draco’s spine. “You want to?” He asks, too kind for his own good.
“I guess no, not really. How do you know how to do this anyway?” Harry says intriguingly, flicking his eyes down to where Draco is sat at the edge of the bed.
“It’s been too long.” He says, placing a gracious hand on the small of her back and guiding her up the castle stairs.
“Sorry, mate. Let’s go to the back. Bring your friend with you.” Ron smiled at Draco, his eyes searching at Draco’s hidden face.
He needs to go find Harry. He needs his worries kissed away. His reliability on the other man is almost embarrassing by now, but Draco really doesn’t have anything else to cope.
“Hi, Harry.” Hermione sighed in concern. “How are you?” She said, lowering her gaze from where the two Slytherins were.
“Yes, well, this ball is for you I suppose. At least you’ve done something right in your life. I’m sure Celeste will show you what it truly is to be a noble.”
Draco was busy. His mother had him in the solar room nearly every day, planning out what would happen when Celeste arrives, what he’d be wearing to the Christmas ball, whether or not Celeste would be staying...
Harry watched as Hermione got Ron up and dragged him out of the hospital to get to the common room. As soon as they left, Harry tilted his head towards Draco.
“Do tell me, Sir Potter, at how you became a Knight so young. Does your Father work in that field too?” Lucius asks, raising an eyebrow in question.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders, pulling his body up to match the height Harry has on him and greedily licks and sucks. He closes his eyes, taking it all in, and feels himself being dragged towards his bed.
“I apologise for that, your majesty, I’m just quick to judge. I’m sure if Harry can befriend you then I see no reason why it would be any harder for me to.”
“Well then how are you bored? I’m sure Celeste keeps you busy. I remember you giving Adelaide a letter, on my first day here.”
Harry pulled Draco into the blacksmiths, his calloused fingers held tightly around Draco’s pale and narrow wrist.
“What’s that?” He asks, pointing, and Draco turns his head to see a bright red package placed between a pillar candle and a book.
Draco tilted his head back, releasing a heavy exhalation. The wind whipped around his body and Draco felt like he could escape everything if he just kept on riding. Just delved further and further into the compelling silver light of the moon. Into the growing waves. Into the ocean where everything was quiet and desolate.
“You’re not in the mood?” Pansy giggled. “Well you were in the mood when you got yourself into this shit by pretending to be Potter.” Pansy condescended Malfoy, which she was often found doing.
“We’re so very proud of him. I cannot wait until we have our own grandchildren.” Narcissa smiles, seeming genuinely nice. She was a lot like Lucius in the ‘I disapprove of my son not becoming a Knight but at least he will carry on the family blood line’ department. She was also in the ‘Don’t act unkempt. Ever.’ department too. And it sickened Draco even further.
Harry does it again, and soon Draco is practically bouncing up and down, Harry’s deep thrusts so agonising but also so good.
Draco nods and turns the corner, into the far side of the castle. The large hallways turn into small corridors lined with large oak doors. Draco turns to the first door on the right, and stops.
Regaining his composure, Draco makes his way over to a plush red sofa that sinks deeply once he sits down on it. Harry slots himself next to it, making easy conversation with people who are hardly listening.
“You alright, Harry?” Hermione asked, noticing that he wasn’t participating in the conversation anymore.
“Yes I am. For ever thinking I could live a normal life. For ever thinking people would like me back.” People meaning Harry. It was true. Draco was too proud, too unavailable. Why would Harry even bother to try, if he did? Draco wasn’t worth the risk. He wasn’t worthy of Harry. He stops his thoughts, laughing at himself at the absurd idea of even thinking Harry would feel about him like that.
On the way down to the stables, Draco glances at the winding gardens, catching sight of the little wooden door embedded in cobbles. He can’t help but smile through his foul mood.
The chain links that hold the swing are ice cold under Draco’s hands but he hardly minds. All he can focus on is Harry slowly kissing his way down his neck. It’s like nothing he has felt before, and he suddenly feels surprisingly warm amidst the chill of the winter air.
There’s still a faint tune heard from the garden, the orchestra seeming to turn their waltz pieces to something slower.
It was a sunday, and it was time for the name picking to happen for the triwizard tournament. It was all anyone had been talking about, and Harry was starting to get tired of it. He saw Cedric through the crowd and went over to him to wish him good luck, and then made his way back to where Ron and Hermione had found a seat.
The fire crackles in warmth and life, comfortably heating Draco up even as the late August heat still humidifies the air.
Harry stares at Draco, something intense in his eyes before they lowered to the things that Draco was holding.
Draco doesn’t know what to say next. Although he was absolutely certain that Harry had no interest in him, he wanted to show that he felt something on his part, for his own enjoyment and sanity.
Harry looks around at the ethereal space and Draco feels a great nostalgia to the time he and Celeste had discovered this part of the gardens when they were younger.
“Okay.” He says bluntly. How could he be so stupid? Spending time having liked Harry so much only to give up. What kind of man was he?
The conversation had drifted into a complete stop, and they were both completely submerged in their work. Harry listened to Draco’s breathing and Draco listened to Harry’s faint humming, noticing that he was singing one of Celestina Warbecks songs.
“That’s the last thing I want to hear right now.” Draco laughs humourlessly. Hours turned into minutes, and soon Draco would be dancing with Celeste. In front of everyone.
“Fuck...” Draco says, so on edge that he can hardly think. Harry pulls out, splaying across the large bed and rubbing at his right hip. He’s still hard, all pink and shiny and very much there.
“End of the week?” Harry’s face lit up in joy. Although it he enjoyed his time with Draco, he couldn’t help but feel joy as he remembered that it meant he could be back to flying soon.
And it’s as if whoever is up there had heard him, because when he turns down to the east of the castle, Harry is there. The licking flames draw him in.
The fire dissipates the tense atmosphere, and Draco turns back to find Harry reading a book. Well, not any book.
Harry led the three of them through to the next room along, which revealed a food store and a table with a set of chairs. Ron pulled one out for Hermione before sitting in one himself, and Harry went to do the same for Draco before Draco raised a hand and did it himself. There was no social etiquette here. He was out of the castle and away from the watch of the general public, so he felt less inclined to act as though he was any more of a person than the other people in this room. He needed a break from all of that, and he had sensed that Harry’s friends could somehow give him the normality that he desired.
“That was blasphemy, what you did back there.” Draco says, running his hands up and down Harry’s back as Harry nips at his neck.
“THAT LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO ME. LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOUR NAME WASN’T HARRY JAMES POTTER. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? WHY ARE YOU READING MY PERSONAL INFORMATION? I KNOW THINGS SUDDENLY CHANGED BETWEEN US BUT IT DOESN’T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY MEANT IT. WHAT IF I DID, HUH? MAYBE I AM GAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? YOU HAVE A PROBLEM? YES? WELL SORRY FOR YOU BUT DADDY CAN’T MAKE THE WORLD PERFECT.” Harry spat,  fuming.
Draco finds Harry on patrol in the gardens, standing idly and lifting a hand to shield his face from the sun.
“Adelaide, I can’t tell you. I can’t- It’ll just. It’ll ruin it all.” He chokes out, shaking his head against Adelaide’s reassuring body.
“But I don’t understand why on earth would you want to do that. My life is boring, Potter.” Draco shrugged.
“You know how you’re gay...you’re gay right? Nah...doesn’t matter but...that’s hot. Like a piece of meat, yeah?” At Draco’s silence, Harry continued. “I don’t mean that in a bad way. God, sometimes you do take things too literally. Live a little Draco, honestly. But that’s beside the point.” He raises his index finger, pointing to Draco as though he was giving him a stern telling off or an important lecture. “I think you’re hot. And shouldn’t be wasted on a bitch like Celeste.”
The quietness of his room becomes all too much, and he has to get out. It doesn’t matter if he’s cold, or tired from countless nights of no sleep. The moon reflects on every surface of the castle, bathing Draco in an eerie light that makes his skin shiver. The sconces aren’t lit now that everyone has gone to bed, and the flags on the floor are colder than they’ve ever been before.
“To...to fight?” It seems a bit unnecessary, being the fact that Draco doesn’t need to know how to fight.
He looks in the mirror leant up against a wall and twists and turns to see the entirety of it. Over a frilly dress shirt with lantern sleeve and a far too bushy jabot, is the dreaded buckled waistcoat. The dark green, tight fabric ends at his waist, where the band of his breeches start. The ends are gathered at his calfs, tucked in long black leather boots that are also adorned with frills. As if to compensate for the buckles, Sebastian has hand-made a cape. He’s never actually worn one before, due to the fact his father never insists on it. But Draco is the one to be noticed on the night of the ball, so the light green fabric, clasped together by three silver chains, is sure to make him stand out.
“You can’t be serious? There’s- There’s like- Hermione how much?” Ron said, gaping in between words.
Draco jumps off Juliet and rolls his trousers up, sinking his feet into the vast lake so he could cool down. It was rare for Draco to be at the lake two days in a row, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do rather than wallowing in self pity.
There’s a loud sound of clinking metal as the men in the centre of the arena filter out onto the benches. The first few matches are short but tense, awarding ooh’s and ahh’s from the crowd. Draco sits in their spectator box, idly picking at the leather strapped around his waist. He takes notice of his ring. He hasn’t taken off for ages, not even when sleeping. But it wasn’t because he was just so infatuated with Celeste that he never wanted to part with it, it was because if he takes it off, he doesn’t think he’ll care to remember to put it back on. Even though the signet ring is bulky and quite simply a statement piece, it feels like hardly anything, either it feels like it’s not there at all or that Draco’s finger has become numb to the warmth it used to hold. It wasn’t a matter of just not wearing it, though. Lucius would notice instantly. Draco wraps his other hand around the ring to conceal it, and puts his attention back onto the tournament. From the corner of his eye, he can see his Mother smiling in his direction. Draco feels sick.
There are footsteps that sound over the organs, and Draco thinks it’s one of his fathers acquaintances until he realises they’re coming towards him, and then Harry slides up next to
“Did you want something fancy, then? The ‘shop has been quiet recently so we have more time on our hands. And Mum and Dad are spending more time at home so we have more space to work with.” Ron said to Harry.
“Harry, you- Oh Merlin-“ Ron searched frantically around Harry’s face, before turning his eyes back to Draco and bowing rigidly. “What the hell is Draco Malfoy doing in my office?” Ron whispered, his face going red at his embarrassment and also anger.
Draco’s emotions are so wild right now, so fluctuating that he feels as though he has whiplash. Harry finds him hot. Harry calls him a ‘piece of meat’. Harry says he’s worthy of someone good. Harry insults Celeste.
By the time they got out, it was too dark for them to head to ‘Lake James’. Or as Harry liked to call it, ‘James’.
“Draco?” Adelaide says, her voice closer now. Draco can feel the bed sinking under her weight, and then a moment later can feel a reassuring hand on his shaking shoulders.
“But...Harry...” He tries to say, but the world has faded to black and Draco’s knees buckle beneath him.
Harry wipes away all bodily fluids from his face with his expensive fabric sleeve, like the heathen he is, and stands up.
Draco drifts the toe of his boot through the water, and Harry notices. Then Harry catches his eye, and there’s a mischievous glint to the green.
They had ditched their work and began talking about music. Harry was surprised to know that Draco didn’t have too bad of a taste, thinking that all he listened to was stuck up classical music by a wizard artist. Before they knew it, they were talking about the latest news and gossip from around hogwarts. Harry only ever talked to Ron and Hermione about these things, but he was intrigued to hear Draco’s point of view. The conversation had changed from different topics, and then they were talking about the triwizard tournament. Draco asked about Cedric as he knew Harry had talked to him, and Harry had told him that he’d put his name in.
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy said, making Harry jump because he had thought that Malfoy was asleep.
“It’s all glitz and glam, the whole puffy dresses and ridiculous chandeliers thing. I’ve never cared for it much myself, but to others it’s practically their whole world. A lifestyle.”
“Sir Potter can sod off for all I care. Tell him I’m busy. Writing to Celeste or whatever the fuck I do with my life anymore.” Draco raised his voice a touch, so that Adelaide will get the idea that he wants to be alone.
“Right, yeah okay. Get your crown polished.” He adds with a wink, before turning to his room further into the castle.
He carries on. “And that now I had been promised a wife, I’d get all that came with it. Children, a family. My own castle one day. This land being my own...” He stops, throat tightening and nausea rolling over him in waves. This is the first time he’s ever spoken about this to someone else, and saying it out loud was frightening. Harry reaches over and gives his hand a brief squeeze, taking his back quickly after. Draco’s throat is working again but now his heart is beating a thousand times a second. “Adelaide knows. I think she figured out before me.”
They lie in companionable silence for a while, watching the clouds drift by and listening to the ducks splash around on the other side of the lake.
“And anyways, Draco is spectating with the King and Queen, he’ll be able to tell if someone’s trying to have at me.” Harry said, pointing aimlessly at Draco.
There’d been a split second in their twisting of limbs where Harry’s face had been completely blank, trying to search for an answer in Draco’s eyes. Draco has no answers though. He was just as conflicted as Harry was. There’s a feeling at the pit of Draco’s stomach, one that makes him go numb with the heightened sensation of anticipation.
They’re all sitting around a table, there must be at least fifteen people gathered, and they’re playing a card game which seems to have everyone’s attention. Harry’s at one end of the table, with Ron and Hermione sat next to him, and he’s drinking what looks like mulled wine and laughing full-bellied at something which the eldest Weasley has said.
He doesn’t even notice the figure in the sea until he reaches his normal perching area, a fallen tree.
He wakes to a cold flannel pressed to his burnt-up forehead. The sheets press hot and sticky on his skin, but he eyes a cold goblet of water on the bedside table and greedily gulps at it.
“You were trying to-“ Draco started but stopped. He breathed in and decided that it wasn’t worth his time. “Something happened and I took it out on you for no reason.” Draco sighed.
“There’s just been a lot to think about recently. It’s all been a bit much. And now what you’ve just said?”
Parkinson babbled on about how another girl was getting on her nerves and Harry could tell Malfoy was getting tired of it.
Harry woke again around 2pm, hearing whispering voices coming from the bed next to him. He could instantly tell it was Pansy Parkinson by the way she cackled and droned.
“My Father died when I was young. So did my Mother. I was raised by a couple of townfolk and then started to live on my own at 16.” Harry said, his voice calm and polite.
Harry laughs under his breath. He looks up at Draco from where he’s planted horizontally across the bed, opens his mouth to reply, but then his eyes flick to Draco’s cock, pressed needy into the sheets. He reaches out for Draco’s hips, placing his hands firmly on each side, and manoeuvres Draco over him, so that he’s straddling Harry.
Harry slowly nodded and got into his own work. Was Draco embarrassed about them sleeping on the same bed? It was Draco who went into Harry’s bed into the first place.
The tight heat feels fantastic, and he arches and grips his legs tighter around Harry, silently begging for more. Harry understands, and pounds into him, somehow rough and loving at the same time. Draco doesn’t mind.
“I’m really sorry, Harry.” Hermione looked at him with tears in her eyes. She turned for a brief second to look at Draco. “You too, Malfoy.”
It’s a realisation that comes so easily, as easy as breathing, as blinking. And Draco has no doubt that Harry doesn’t love him back. It’s not as though he just ‘likes’ him, now. It’s so much more. It’s the way he pretends he doesn’t lean in to him when they’re close, when they’re sitting together and he just watches. Admires. How Harry is just so stubborn, and he is too, and how there is no time for waiting because this is what he wants now.
As they finished off their brunch, Harry smiled widely at Draco. He had crumbs all around his mouth and on his t-shirt. Harry laughed and couldn’t stop as he pointed out the mess that Draco made.
“Yes, I shall Ada. Why are you so frantic? Is something wrong?” Draco says, laying a hand on Adelaide’s shoulder to get her to stop moving.
Hermione’s mouth dropped at Draco’s statement. Maybe Draco was being a bit harsh, but he didn’t feel bad. Not at all.
“Can you...” He starts again, not sure how to get the words across. ‘Can you fuck me into the bedsheets’ felt a bit too forward. Not that it’s not true...
Harry only shrugged. “Oh!” He said excitedly, “About that book from your library, I saw that you had...” Harry chatted on, pushing Draco from the centre point of his lower back. Harry couldn’t tell , but Draco leaned back into the touch, letting Harry guide him to Draco’s rooms.
“She didn’t question anything, don’t worry. Although now that I think about it she did give me a look...”
“If I could get you out of this, I would. You and Celeste have known eachother for a long time, and sometimes when that happens you feel more of a platonic love than a sexual love.” She says, smiling.
A fault in the smile. A breath hitched. He should be in love, his Father said so. You do not disobey the King.
If Draco tries hard enough, he can imagine it’s Harry he’s dancing with. Instead, he’s taking the hand of his dance partner and joining in with everyone else.
“Ah, you’re still up!” He smiles widely, swaying from side to side. No damaged hip this time. The only ailments Harry had right now was the inability to stand up. Draco could smell the alcohol from the other side of the room.
“Sir Harry Potter here is going to be our new head Guard Knight.” Lucius booms, clapping Harry on the shoulder. “He got an injury during battle and so they moved him over to here. He’ll be staying in the bed chambers along with some other Knights.” Lucius smiles, shooting a weary eye at Draco. “I hope we can show some hospitality to him.” He says slyly, raising a cautious blonde eyebrow.
“Harry, all the things I said last night were true. And you don’t need to worry about me, I’ve long come to terms with it.”
“Yeah, what is he talking about, Harry?” Draco muttered in a menacing tone, trying to get Harry to say what he had been keeping in for so long.
And instead of Harry dancing with him, he has a maiden by his side, one that Draco’s only just noticed.
His cock has started to leak with precome, and he aches to touch it. He’s so close, and Harry’s  moaning and stroking and he goes to touch Draco and-
“Thanks for the portrait.” Harry says into his neck, hugging him from behind as Draco stands in-front of his wardrobe. Draco leans his head back on Harry’s shoulder, taking a deep breath.
Harry turns around, feigning surprise. “What a surprise it is to see you here.” He said with a sheepish smirk.
“Oh god, me too.” Draco admits, allowing his feelings to be out there because they can. He really doesn’t know why he’d been holding out all this time. It’s hard to really believe he let his problems with Celeste and his parents get in the way. “Now shut up and kiss me.”
“I would have though you had gotten used to the taste of the infirmary’s food.” Malfoy jested, trying to move the direction of Harry’s eyes.
“Celeste is here in ten minutes!” Adelaide calls. “I hope you liked my present!” She adds, and clicks down the hallway.
“Y-yeah, I know.” Harry couldn’t help but notice how the sunlight reflected on Malfoy’s white hair, turning it almost golden. Harry recomposed himself, “Well, Malfoy, serves you right for trying to copy me. Now we’re both stuck here for the next two weeks.”
Harry couldn’t wait to have a shower, though. At least he was excited about something. They sat in silence until Ron and Hermione came up around 6pm after having dinner.
This time Draco couldn’t hide his sadness. He couldn’t fight back something that was inevitably going to happen. One glimpse of a worried Adelaide at the end of his bed had caused the tears to come rushing back. He was holding back days worth of tears. He held them ever since he realised something that will cause a lot of pain and anger. For himself and for others.
“I have power over mostly everyone in this castle, and don’t think I won’t hesitate to get you fired. The castle might seem much more quiet once you’ve gone on your merry way.” Draco sighed, tilting his head so that it rested on the back of the sofa.
Out of all the places he thought he’d end up, standing outside the common room for the knights chambers was not one of them. He’d never actually been inside before, and never plans to. Being surrounded by burly men was threatening, but then again...
And with that he entered. His hood was completely down at this point, and he was able to see everyone in the room, unlike last time when he was rushed past. Most of them seemed to have a polite smile on their face, although they didn’t seem as they were keen about having the son of an almost tyrant in their shop.
“To the stables, Ada. Tell my Mother and Father I’ll be back before noon.” He says, finishing the last piece of bread on his plate.
Harry arrived back at the Gryffindor common room to find everyone had already left for dinner. He placed his dirty clothes and stationary onto his bed and got changed into his uniform. It felt odd having it back on after a while of being in pyjamas, but it was good to get back to normal. Well as normal as he could get to, considering the scene that he had just left.
“Yeah, don’t know how though. I can’t even stand up without my whole body hurting. And also I’ll need a long shower. A very long one.” Harry laughed.
“Ah yes, I see. On that note, though, do you have a mistress? I suspect an honourable young man like you would be on your way to marriage soon.” Lucius questions.
I honestly don’t know how to stop myself so I’ve gone and written another chapter. This one is longer than chapter 3 so I hope it’s satisfactory!
“Well, if you hadn’t just gone and seen the castle nursemaid then we wouldn’t be in this situation right now.” Draco mumbled back.
Although Harry seemed to think nothing of the touch, Draco felt a warmth that left him breathless, for absolutely no reason at all.
“Down here.” He says, grabbing Harry’s hand and running fast towards the door at the sound of voices entering the garden.
I know I always say that I’m going to stop writing so fast, but I just n e e d e d to get this chapter out.
“My father puts the land as priority over everything else. I know you weren’t here when the last battle finished, but it was devastating. But it was over, their head knight was killed. My father is just making sure it’s not happening again.”
“I’m not sure it’s up to me to approve but... you look handsome.” He says, muffling the last words behind his mouth, attempting to cover a blush.
He’s idly leaning against the wall, his foot dragging through a layer of dust on the floor. The room he’s standing in front of is where the spare uniform and armour is kept. Harry’s previous muddy state is gone, and he’s just as sparkling as he always is. Trust him to always look good.
Draco walks further into the centre of the castle, past the many bed chambers, large sitting rooms, the castles ballroom, the kitchens, the storerooms, out and around into the large courtyard and then back in and finds himself stopping at the large windows at the front of the castle and looking at the grounds below. He stood for a while, taking in the scent of burning wood from a sconce nearby and then made his way to the solar room, where his mother and father were.
“C’mon, Draco. What’s so bad? It makes sense. I know the way you look at me means more than you think I know.” He says confidently, and Draco’s had enough. He grabs his blanket from under Harry, ignoring Harry’s hopeful face at the close proximity and heading for the door.
These silly little fantasies are what motivates him. But, sometimes, dealing with the events of the current day is all that he needs to do right now.
“Tea?” The woman offered, and Draco shook his head. Drinking tea from a place that looked like this might just ensure certain death.
“Early Christmas present.” She smiled, placing Draco’s thick blankets everywhere on the four-poster bed.
Harry turns back now, eyes searching Draco’s face, preparing for impact. Draco says nothing, and he looks relieved.
Harry releases a heavy sigh and smiles faintly. “You should have said.” He places his arm around Draco’s waist.
There was no doubt that Harry was faster than Draco, what with all his Knight training, and so Draco had to run especially fast if he had any hopes of getting Harry back.
Sorry it’s been a couple of weeks! I was so busy with school but it’s finished now so I plan to update a lot quicker!
Draco sighs heavily. “It can’t be helped, Ada. But it’s just something I have to deal with.” He looks up at her. “Now stop frowning, it’s Christmas, isn’t it?”
I started writing this fic a year ago wow,, and two months away from being a year since the first chapter was uploaded...
Ron smiled at that but still looked as though he thought Harry would shatter to a million pieces if he moved again. “Look mate, I’ve got class. I’ll bring you all of your books and essay papers up at the end of the day. Hermione and I will see you later, yeah?”
Harry didn’t speak for a while, trying to comprehend that they were having a pretty normal human conversation without the use of their wands or having crowds of people watching.
“Oh, I sure do.” He nods primly, before pulling Harry forward by the nape of his neck and pressing his mouth hard. Harry’s hand travels further up, his hands knotting through Draco’s plait. When they pull away for the second time, the whole thing has come loose.
“We’re not friends, Potter. You work for me. My personal life is none of your business.” Draco chides, his arms crossing over his chest.
“You know it. Your father keeps taking me out of watch duty so that I can assist him with his practice.” Harry sighed, flopping back into the armchair across from Draco.
It’s a serious concern, but Draco can’t help but laugh. He’s just knelt on the floor, cock out and a bit of Draco’s release on his cheek, looking up at Draco with unabashed eyes.
“Meh. I couldn’t care for any of that colour stuff, clothes are clothes!” He finally says, and Draco shakes his head fondly. Hopeless, utterly hopeless...
Draco tugs Harry’s hair lightly, pulling his face up and mashing their lips together, Harry panting in his mouth. They’re both sweaty, fringes stuck to their foreheads, glistening in the midday sun.
Harry’s mouth envelops his, his body pressed flushed against Draco’s, rocking forwards and backwards teasingly.
“Where are you going?” Adelaide looks up from where she is standing, watering the golden alstroemeria lilies surrounding the castle.
“Where are you off to, Draco? You can’t just leave when guests are present.” Lucius demands, turning from his seat.
After finishing breakfast, that was interrupted by countless questions thrown at Lucius, Draco runs to the small gates to the right of the castle and finds Ron and Hermione.
“But first,” he says, quickly stepping forward and pushing Harry’s hand down. The contact sends a thrill through Draco’s body, as it always does, and it takes everything he could to not just jump on Harry and snog him senseless. It was a bad idea, he told himself. “I lead.” Draco states, bowing in front of Harry before holding his arm out to his side. “Place your forearm against mine.” Draco tells Harry, suppressing a smile as Harry fumbles with his positioning.
By ten o’clock that night, Draco’s certain that Harry Potter is not a flirt, and that his full attention lies in Draco.
“Hey! Some of us didn’t grow up with ballrooms down the hallway. Look, your father is expecting me to at least have a couple dances with a maiden. Can you at least teach me a couple of steps?” Harry begs, stepping back from his close proximity to Draco and holding out his hand elegantly.
“What is Prince Draco Malfoy doing here?” She whispered aggressively into Ron’s ear, before shooting a courteous smile towards Draco.
“You dinner will be soon, Draco. Think of pink skies.” She said, smiling, before cracking open the door and walking out.
“Potty has got himself into another accident has he? Does he need Mummy to come kiss it better?” Parkinson muttered to Malfoy, glaring at where Harry had his back turned.
“Well anyway, as I was saying, that if all goes well and you take and extra dose of your medication a day. You’ll be out by the end of the week.”
A rhythmic tap of his foot on the table. The pattering of rain on the stained-glass window. The rustle of Draco’s tunic.
Harry turned quickly around, folding the corner of the page and snapping the book shut. Draco cringed at having to undo the crease, but before he could voice his thoughts about Harry’s disrespect for his expensive books, he noticed Harry’s alarmed face.
Harry’s very still when he sleeps, so unalike his constant fidgeting and need for movement. His lips are open slightly, and there’s a deep red flush to his cheeks.
“Fine, really. I haven’t had an accident so far but with the amount of training Lucius is making me do I don’t know when it’s going to start giving out.”
“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” She advises, and softly closes the door behind her as she leaves.
Harry relaxed against Draco’s touch, and now he was glad he couldn’t get out of bed. Because he wanted to lay here forever.
“It’s just annoying. I’m given this chance of happiness, given wealth and provide safety and I don’t want any of it. It makes me sound like an ungrateful snob.”
At the end of the week, Harry had noticed that Draco wasn’t in any of his lessons at all. And he never showed up to the great hall either.
sorry if any of you though this was a new chapter if anyone is actually following the progress of this fic BUT soon (very soon) the next chap will be up!!
“Hey.” Harry says in mock-hurt. He pulls Draco closer from one of the buckles on the jacket, and sweeps his hand over Draco’s cheek. “You look like a prince.”
of warmth that the early september sun was giving him. He could feel the presence of Harry’s hands at the grips on the saddle, and nearly made them slip when he remembered what he was doing, distracted by the thought that if Harry had just leant a tiny bit forward, or Draco moved a tiny bit back, Harry’s knuckles would be pressing into his hips. Draco quickly snapped out of that idea, completely confused about where it had developed and questioning why he would ever want Harry to be touching him.
Harry leans forward, stretching his torso over Draco’s and reaching for his mouth. Draco sits up on his elbows, meeting Harry in the middle and relishing the feel of Harry’s soft lips on his. It’s not enough, so he feels his way down Harry’s muscular back, down to his arse so that he can get the lean body closer.
Harry had realised that after being friends with Hermione and Ron for so long, that they sometimes had nothing to talk about. Hermione always had her head in a book and Ron was always practicing wizard chess. Harry knew they never meant to ignore him, but he liked it when they had fun conversations. But it was different with Draco. Draco always knew what to say, even if sometimes he was being horrible. Draco never asked Harry about his upbringing, and Harry never asked Draco about his father.
“Because of you! Every five bloody minutes you were jolting around in your bed and shouting about Merlin knows what.” Draco spat. The anger caused his perfect outside mask slip, and his hair had hung over his face instead of being neatly parted to the side.
“Deer hunting?” Harry half-shouted, the sound of hooves and the whipping wind making it hard to hear.
“I’ll break all of your bones. I’ll make sure you are permanently in the bed, sulking and whining so that you get the attention that you most definitely do not deserve. Harry’s already in a lot of pain and I don’t want you giving him a hard time.” Ron stepped even further towards Draco.
“What are you doing?” Draco whispers, keeping his head straight forward so that he won’t catch the attention of his parents.
‘My father is greatly pleased with his choice of my future wife, and I am glad that I will be able to ride my new pony with you, who will be four when you arrive. I had Adelaide help me with drawing her, which is on the other side. Her name is Juliet. Let’s hope she gets along with Xalvador and Muriel.’ He taps the goose-feathered quill against his temple, thinking of how to end the letter.
“Yeah, but I’ve been avoiding your father all day. I think he’s pretty pissed. He’d had enough of my recovery and went into our rooms and dragged me out of bed.”
Draco finds him, when the sky darkens to a pink. He’s sitting on a bench, overlooking the grounds that are covered with a thick layer of snow.
“You have to let me! I thought this was just a book you had bought! Draco, from what I’ve read so far it’s great!” Harry looks at him with such honesty that Draco breaks out into grin.
Draco stepped back from the contact to peer around the building that Harry had hidden them behind. “What are you-“ Draco started loudly, but Harry quickly interrupted.
“You never know, Ada. And also,” Draco adds, remembering why he had come into castle in the first place, “Do you know why he’s here? I saw his horse in the stables when I came back from my ride.”
“No, mate.” Harry shouted back, diverting his gaze back to the rest of the green field. He sighed and lifted his head, and spotted a flickering gold light coming from above. Either Harry could go get the snitch and let Draco leave, or he could fly down and try and talk about what he was feeling.
“Wait.” Draco stopped, making Harry nearly bash into his back. He stifled a laugh before he turned abruptly.
“That’s alright.” Harry replies, gaze drifting to the new dance happening. “It’s what you’ve got to do.” He hesitates. “After, can I come to your room?”
“Teach you to dance?” Draco says, tilting his head slightly. It would only make sense, seeing as they were in this room.
“What are you talking about?” Draco asks, trying to include himself in the conversation for his own sanity.
“Yes?” Draco calls, sitting up in his bed. The firelight reflects on Harry perfectly, casting shadows of orange light that sharpen his jawline.
It all definitely hasn’t been a waste of time, though. Draco and the knights have formed a mutual respect between them, and he has shown that he’s nothing like his father. During the latter part of the hour he was there, Draco was sure he would develop premature wrinkles from smiling constantly. At one point, Harry had basically pressed his lips to Draco’s ear and whispered “They’re seeing who you truly are, Draco.” He was absolutely right, and Draco had nothing wrong with that. Maybe he’d even found some allies.
“There you go! Your crowns all polished, too. It would be a waste of my hard work if it wasn’t put to use.” She pouted.
“Yup.” He says, non-committal, but he’s excited about spending as much time as possible with Harry. “It’ll be quite late, though.”
“Thank you, Ada.” He nods and holds the ring up to admire the shine. He then heads to his rooms, to go to bed.
And they do, cuddled on the couch in front of the library hearth, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest. It feels like all too much and not enough at the same time.
