“You’re right, Draco,” Harry whispered numbly, “All those people… they all can’t reproduce?”
“Anyway,” Harry said, turning to a scowling Ron and breaking his thought spiral, “Ida told me there was another attack. What’s going on?”
“Aviary…” Harry began, his voice wobbly.
“And what, did she dare you to smile at me oddly and then leave? If so, I have to say it was a pretty subpar dare,” Harry commented, looking over at Malfoy.
“Fine,” Ron sounded exasperated as he sat sulkily into his chair. Harry had a feeling he wouldn’t be cheering for Puddlemere anytime soon. Harry almost laughed at his friend when he remembered his anger with him and stifled it.
A pang in his stomach reminded him that Draco was the same way. But just because Draco’s changed doesn’t mean his friend truly has.
“That’s fair,” James added, That's why I always Sorry Al.”
“You.. what?” Draco’s voice was dangerously low.
Draco held up his wand in an attempt to apparate back, but Harry was too quick for that. He cast an expelliarmus and caught Draco’s wand as it flung itself towards him. Draco huffed angrily and lunged for the wand in Harry’s hand, but Harry cast a shield around him. Ignoring Draco’s loud profanities, Harry concentrated on sending a patronus. Draco, surprisingly, quieted down as Harry gave the patronus directions.
“Hey!” he protested as a jar of ink hit the floor and shattered, spilling ink across the carpeting, “I just got new carpet put in!”
“Really?” Luna’s eyes lit up, “You mean it?”
Harry was, for about the hundredth time that night, shocked at Malfoy’s change in attitude. Before he knew what was happening, Malfoy had began to speak again,
Darius looked at Hermione’s round stomach in shock, “Mrs. Granger-Weasley! What will happen to your child?”
“That… actually makes a lot of sense,” they all glanced over at Savant to see if he agreed.
“Are you fucking kidding me, Draco?” Harry whispered so Seb wouldn’t hear him, “That’s not how this works. You said some really hurtful things to me, after you came onto me. We can’t just keep breezing past the hard things and pretending nothing is wrong.”
“Seb…” Harry started, realizing now he had made a huge error in judgement.
“It’s obvious, Harry,” she whispered back, “And he likes you too. He would deny it, but he spent the entirety of the time you were in the fire staring at your arse.”
“Ron made you come tonight?” he inquired.
Harry let out a laugh. He was starting to really like Seb.
“I think you like me,” Harry blurted. He didn’t know why he was making matters worse, but he really could not control himself.
“Upset about that?” Dean inquired, glancing sideways at Harry.
“You are right, Aviary…” he began to say, but he stopped abruptly when he heard a voice from the end of the hallway.
Harry looked away quickly. He was prepared to end this conversation with Malfoy (it was quickly becoming more than he bargained for) but then he remembered another question he wanted an answer to.
“No,” he shot from his seat, “I’ve said all I can. You have my statement.”
The inside of the cafe felt like walking into the Burrow. It was chaotic, filled with countless signs and framed posters of everything from the Beatles to famous British football teams. From one look around, Harry spotted a watering can suspended from the ceiling painted in red, blue and white, a wall covered with framed records, a bright red couch that seemed to have signatures covering every available spot and a light fixture shaped as England itself. Harry, who could have looked at the walls of this cafe all day without finding everything they had to offer, told himself to try and find Malfoy. It wasn’t hard; the cafe was so small that he easily recognized Malfoy’s bright blond hair at a table at the back of the cafe, directly next to a giant poster of David Beckham.
He grinned at Al and Rose and then looked over at Harry, noticing him for the first time.
“Dad!” The loud yell from outside of his door took Harry out of his deep revoir of thoughts. Despite the abruptness of the address, James knocked on the door of the room.
Harry shook his head, “There’s no way you want to see me right now, Molly.”
Harry’s head whipped back towards the match. Kingston must have spotted the snitch, because his broom was soaring across the field at a speed Harry knew all too well. The Cannons seeker, Alisha Waint, was on his tail. Harry and the rest of the stadium held their breath as he watched the race towards the snitch. The only one who seemed to be moving besides the seekers was the trolley wizard, who was still determined to sell his food. Harry watched Waint creep up on Kingston until the two were neck in neck. Ginny had been right about her seeker; the girl sure could fly. Then, suddenly, Waint did a nose dive towards the ground while Kingston continued to soar forward. Kingston stopped moments later, and looked, like the rest of the stadium, at Waint. She had landed feet first on the ground and had one arm in the air. In a moment of heavy anticipation, she opened her fist, revealing the snitch captured inside. A roar of cheers burst throughout the stadium. Harry saw Ginny run across the field, red hair flying as she launched herself at her seeker and embraced her in a triumphant hug. Harry jumped to his feet and cheered at the top of his lungs as pride for Ginny overcame him. He reached down to pick up his daughter, who was screaming herself hoarse, when a blood-curdling scream pierced through the waves of cheers.
Dean’s smile fell a little as he answered, “As good as it can when we have no idea what’s poisoning these poor Muggles. It’s something dark, that’s all we know.”
“I’d like two more glasses of your Superior Red,” Harry said, pulling a galleon out of his pocket and placing it on the counter in front of him.
“James Sirius!” Ginny reprimanded, “What is the matter with you?”
“There’s something else…” Ginny narrowed her eyes. Suddenly she let out a loud gasp, “Wait a moment… it all makes sense!
“Harry! You’re still here!” she said as she slid half of her enormous stack of papers into his awaiting arms, “Ron and I just got back. He is going to be delighted to see you.”
“And, of course, Padma will be my maid of honor and Lavender's sister Lila will be hers,” Parvati said, smiling over at her twin sister.
“I’m fine, Hermione,” he thought about this for a second, then shook his head, “Actually, no I am not. Fine, I mean. I need someone to say something rather big and confusing to and I was hoping it could be you. Well, I already told someone, but this someone isn’t an overly nurturing type. I mean, they were plenty accepting, but not overtly helpful…”
Draco started and almost jumped back at Harry’s touch. When he noticed it was Harry, he heaved a large sigh.
Harry said goodbyes to the both of them and shifted his knees to begin to move out of the fireplace when Savant spoke again,
“I trust Hermione completely.”
“You as well,” Harry agreed, waving to Scorpius as he left hand in hand with his mother.
Ida sneered, “I know why you are being so defensive, Harry. You like someone. Like  really like someone. I’m an Auror at the top of my field. I can detect a simple infatuation. My guess is your heart is set on Seb, unless there’s someone else?”
“I think that is also known as a Ron-Hermione and Pansy-Lavender,” Dean commented thoughtfully.
“That’s a fucking lie,” she turned to Harry, “I like him.”
Moments later, two desks appeared in front of him. Ron was nowhere to be seen, but Padma was sitting at hers, scribbling furiously on a piece of parchment.
Harry rolled his eyes, “We are not a couple, James! None of this matters, anyhow. What matters is your mother and I making things right so that you and your siblings' lives can be as normal as possible.”
“You know who killed Gani?” Ron gasped, completely interrupting Aviary as she attempted to continue speaking, “But you said…”
“Oh, Harry! Ginny!” she exclaimed through tears, “I am so, so sorry! Ron’s so confused right now, he doesn’t mean all the things he said!”
“Just you watch!” Rose glared at her friend, “Brickston will get the snitch. I’ll bet a galleon!”
“They both look so pretty,” Aviary whispered from beside him.
“Thanks!” Seamus smiled back at her and then exclaimed, “I like you already!”
“My thoughts exactly,” Malfoy agreed, “We’ll meet next Monday, Wednesday, Saturday…”
Harry looked back at Seb in the light of the bar. Seb poured another shot of whiskey and tilted his head back. Harry watched as the light caught his hair and made him glow in his own little halo. Then he looked back at Harry with that ridiculous grin on his face, the one that lit up everything. Harry looked away quickly and took another long and fast swing from his own glass. For the moment, drawing his thoughts in alcohol seemed like the best solution.
“We’re not denying it,” Blaise said matter-of-factly, “Our plan is that she becomes best friends with Lacey and they keep each other busy whenever they are together.”
“Okay…” Malfoy sounded concerned, “I thought we could meet today? In the park? I was planning to bring Murr, if that seals the deal. I really need to talk to you.”
“I know. I am happy for you and Gin, but I still can’t believe you two ended up with Slytherins,” Ron said.
Harry pulled a face at his son and watched as he left the room laughing. The kid had Ginny’s sense of humor through and through.
Harry stared at him in awe, “You thought I was some closeted and awkward basket case for all of our childhood, didn’t you?”
“Gin, you know that’s not what I meant,” Harry said, slightly annoyed.
They remained silent on the ride to the second floor. Harry was out of the lift as soon as the doors opened, Draco closely behind him as they made their way over to the group of Aurors surrounding Savant’s office.
“Not all of it!” Aviary countered, swatting his arm, “You hadn’t even heard of bug bombs before I brought them up!”
As the kids all decided on the order they would sit in, Hermione gave Harry a long hug and pulled back with a look of sympathy that consumed her face and made Harry look away. Harry was glad that Ron hadn’t heard about any of Harry and Ginny’s love lives, because the two were already in an awkward enough situation as it was. It had been a week since Christmas, and Harry had been stalling working together on the investigation to prevent the multiple unwanted conversations that would follow. He was avoiding Ron and Padma because he was still so upset with them that he knew talking rationally at the moment wasn’t in his arsenal. He was avoiding Draco because, well, looking at him reminded Harry of everything that was confusing and messy and too damn complicated in his life.
“It. Was. Not. Blaise.” Draco gritted out, his voice sharp, “I’ve known him my whole life! He wouldn’t have even done something like this back at Hogwarts! He’s a good person, one who cares so much about his job and friends. There is no fucking way it was him!”
Hermione nodded, “I know. It means nothing from me. But we both have been having hellish weeks. That’s actually why I wasn’t there tonight; I had a meeting I couldn’t miss and I had planned to come over afterwards but I was caught up for hours. I came over as soon as Ron told me the story.”
“Fantastic! Where to begin?” Brayan ran a hand through his hair and began to speak.
“No,” Ron stood up, “We are just leaving.”
“Really, Ron, you have nothing to apologize for,” Brayan said, “Really, I’m quite thankful that I was merely accused of a crime. Nothing happened to me. Not like…” he trailed off as his voice cracked. He looked down at his feet.
Aries Reyes was propped up on a bed in the center of the room. He looked nothing like a patient, except for his sling holding up his right arm. His shoulder length black hair was slicked back without a single hair out of place (it reminded Harry absently of Draco’s hair in first year) and he was wearing smart green robes. He was jotting notes on a clipboard with an outline of a quidditch pitch on it. Harry was surprised to see this level of commitment as the man laid on a hospital bed. From all Angelina had said about Reyes, Harry had assumed Oliver made most of the plans while Aries reaped the benefits of technically being the coach of a good quidditch team. Aries seemed focused and determined, something Harry thought impossible.
“I’d send an owl, but I doubt he’s in an unsecure location it could fly to. He’s safe Malfoy, I know he is even if it’s not much of a consolation. Advice though, go easy on him, pressure like you have and like what he’s taking on isn’t always good for a person’s health. Go tell Narcissa that he’s fine.” He huffed before closing the door on the man.
Harry let himself break down for what felt like the millionth time in his life and let himself fall into Ron’s chest. Gripping onto the soft yarn sweater Ron slept in and rocking with the added weight. Once he had a few minutes to let his eyes dry up and stop beating their own rhythm he pulled back from the death grip he’d had on the poor redhead.
“The youth now at days, always in a hurry.” She waved at the air.
With a click the artificial light burned his eyes painfully as he blinked the spots appearing out of his vision. The ring of light illuminated more than the lumos the others had cast and he could only guess it was because he wasn’t using magic. The small patch of overgrowth made his voice hitch in his throat as he held back a yelp.
She laughed so hard at his words that she doubled over for a moment before snapping back up. It was like watching a signal flag for a race being waved and They both dove for it. Her towards him, him behind a divider screen.
Harry nodded, not looking her in the eye. He followed a moment after she left the room, moving Lily from the couch in the living room to her own bed as Ginny moved Albus (only James had crashed in his actual bed; Albus had managed to stretch his entire body across Ginny and Harry’s). One by one, he walked into each of his kids’ rooms, kissing them gently on the head and staring down at them in their peaceful slumbers. He imagined how promising their lives looked now. They had faced no real fears or sorrows, which is exactly what Harry and Ginny wanted for them after the horrific events of their own childhoods. Harry had wanted a family like the Weasley’s ever since he first met Ron and his family at King’s Cross Station so many years ago. He wanted the easy comfort and reassurance that came with two parents who loved you unconditionally. He got that with the Weasley’s after years of living in a special kind of hell with the Dursleys. Now he wanted his kids to have this feeling of love and safety, despite the unpredictableness of life. As long as their family life was solid, he hoped they would believe that everything would be okay. If he and Ginny were to end this safe haven they had created, he worried that he would destroy everything they had built for their family. Implode the very foundation that held them together.
Ginny whipped around at this, staring at him in shock.
“My thoughts exactly,” Ron agreed, “I know in my gut that Savant, Ida and Padma are innocent. I’ve known them all for so long. I’ve seen them give up so much of their time and energy to fight against these attacks and so many other incidents just like them. There is no way they were involved. Even if they are all purebloods.”
“Oi, the party has arrived!” Dean cheered, opening the door wide to let everyone in.
“Honestly,” Hermione spoke, “I was a bit upset you didn’t say anything to me, Gin. We are close enough that you can trust me with stuff like this. You know that, don’t you?”
“Harry,” Aviary began again, “The idea of Kareach is an organized cross-cultural society against muggleborns and muggles with an ultimate plan to eliminate them. That is a far cry from poisoning muggles.”
Darius wiped the tears from his face, “Well, at least she went the one way she would have wanted. Fighting to protect others.”
Harry thought about what Malfoy was trying to do. He wanted to essentially take down an entire organization of potentially Imperius attack starting nutters who hated nothing more than muggles, muggleborns and blood traitors. And as Harry looked at Malfoy, he started to think Malfoy was definitely not a part of the pureblood status any longer. For starters, he was now investigating a group that was rumored to hold a Voldemort-esque ideology, something Harry believed Malfoy had full faith in until only a few weeks ago. But it was also the little things Malfoy did, from his distinctively muggle clothes (he was wearing a pale blue jumper and jeans today) to his muggle phone and trips to muggle parks. He was a major threat to the mysterious Kareach. Even if Kareach wasn’t real, Harry still couldn’t shake the feeling that Malfoy was on to something dangerous and nearly impossible. His unavoidable streak of heroism was returning; he couldn’t let Malfoy investigate Kareach alone.
“He’s Head of Games and Sports, Ron,” Ginny pointed out rather fiercely, “I think his opinions are something to pay attention to.”
Harry knew this was the best way to describe the situation, but he could tell the room wasn’t taking to it. James was silently fuming and Rose had begun to cry, causing Albus to put an arm around her shoulder. Ron was shaking his head furiously in disbelief.
“This was the headquarters! Of the Order of the Phoenix!” Draco gasped.
“You are all ridiculous,” Fleur pointed out as she walked over with Dom, “Dom and I are cheering for both teams.”
“I would never,” Harry whispered, looking into bright blue eyes.
Ron shook his head, his face falling, “Don’t smile at me like that. I don’t deserve it. I wasn’t supportive when you and Ginny first told me. I wasn’t there when both of you needed me most. I’m not upset that you and Ginny aren’t together. I mean, I am, but I’m more happy that you two are happy. Ginny seems to really like Blaise. And you seem to really like Draco. That’s what matters. I support you in whatever makes you happy, mate.”
Malfoy snorted, “Well, she’s pan, so I wouldn’t say “gay” is the correct label. But if you had any conversation with her in the last ten years, it would’ve been blindingly clear she is anything but straight.”
“Well, the Ministry is, of course, trying to find the best possible security against more attacks. After the hospital attack and the quidditch attack, the Department of Security has received a lot of backlash. Apparently, they ignored many of Blaise’s suggestions that could have helped prevent the attack, leading many to think the Department of Security is lacking strong leadership. They have promoted Blaise to head of the department temporarily while Seamus runs the Department of Games and Sports. So far, it seems Blaise is doing a great job. And he volunteered for it and everything! The courage is admirable, I have to say.”
Harry was glad he wasn’t upset that Aviary was allegedly wasted on his couch instead of at work. Her boyfriend was murdered earlier in the day, so Harry could only assume anyone with a shred of humanity would cut her some slack.
“Yep,” Seb confirmed, tapping his hand against the table without seeming to notice, “And I’m all clear! Mighty glad I got through that mess, it was something just short of hell.”
“Aviary, cast the shock spell on him!” Draco instructed, referring to the large man she had apparated in with who was shaking harder than the rest of them. As Draco fired spell after spell, he yelled at Padma to cast anapneo on her patient. Harry rushed towards Padma and began to replicate the charms Draco had cast on Hermione and the blond woman moments ago. Thankfully, his own research and his ability to learn quickly in urgent situations paid off; the charms he had cast worked and the man was shaking less and less as Harry continued to fire spells.
“It was hilarious,” Draco added, “I’m planning on dedicating a good two paragraphs to it in my article.”
“Draco?” Ida questioned, “First name basis? Who are you?”
Mateh smiled, “You have to do what you have to do. I’ll be back later, Mr. Potter, before I leave for the day. Let me know if you need anything.”
The words felt cold in his mouth as he stared at Ron for conformation. Ron looked taken aback at Harry’s sudden conscious demands. Harry was about to ask again when Ron enveloped him in a hug.
“I told you he was tolerable now,” Padma said proudly, looking at Ron, “And you told me it wasn’t possible!”
“It’s just a hobby,” Draco snapped, but Harry could tell it meant more to him than he was letting on, “And it’s not a hobby I do not plan to share with anyone, especially you!”
“What’s the yelling for?” Luna asked Ron and Harry calmly.
“He must’ve gotten weird about it,” Ida covered, “Straight males tend to struggle with implications of homosexuality.”
“That, we may never know,” Malfoy quipped.
“Of course, Molly,” Harry reassured, giving her what he hoped was a convincing smile, “Why wouldn’t it be?”
Padma turned, with no doubt a retort forming on her lips, when she saw it was Harry.
Draco looked up, face silently breaking, “I didn’t want you to die then either,” he hesitated, then whispered, “I would have prevented Crabbe and Goyle from getting to you. I wanted to mess things up. But Crabbe did that for me with the Fiendfyre.”
Both Aviary and Savant looked shocked, “That can’t be true!” Savant insisted.
Saying Ron’s name made him feel a jolt of sadness. Harry was so accustomed to bringing up Ron in conversation that he didn’t even register the fact that, as of right now, he and Ron weren’t on speaking terms, much less friends.
Harry looked at Ron. He didn’t know how to explain to Hermione that her baby, the one she was already carrying, was most likely in mortal danger.
Realistically, though, he wasn’t going to get assigned to the second floor for every rotation. Part of training was exploring the five different floors and the opportunities that came with each of them. So Harry silenced his inner disappointments and made his way to the lift with Caser in tow.
Ron didn’t stay to hear more. He rushed down the hall. Harry had to nearly sprint to keep up. When they reached the outside of the door, Ron practically flung it off of its hinges as he threw it open.
With this new outlook in mind, Harry apparated into the ground floor of the hospital Monday morning feeling positive about the day and excited about the opportunities Healer Patrick could open up for him. He took the lift to the fifth floor and walked across the canteen to the conference room the trainees met in. The meeting went better than usual. Caser and another trainee named Hedra who he had been getting along with sat on each side of Harry and swapped stories of their craziest experiences in the last week while they waited for Healer Brayan to begin. The only bad part was when Brayan gave instructions for the day and numerous trainees glowered at him for getting the week with Patrick. This was quickly made up for by the icey retort Caser made when a particularly unpleasant bloke called him a “pretentious suck-up” in which Caser told him to “stop putting Harry down, you’re only jealous of how much better he is at healing”. All in all, the day was looking brighter and brighter as he made his way to the second floor and walked down a hallway to Healer Patrick’s office. He gave the door a sharp rapt with his knuckles and waited for an answer (Dean had told Harry that Patrick moved at a quick pace and appreciated efficiency in interactions).
Harry couldn’t see if the spell hit Ida, as the room divulged into chaos. The protego charm splintered apart as Auror after Auror sent spells at Kareach members. Harry broke his own charm and looked widely around him. He was almost immediately confronted by a large figure in the same black mask he had witnessed weeks ago at the hospital attack. He quickly dodged a spell shot his way. Thankful he had years of Auror training, he impulsively cast an expelliarmus. The wand flew from the man’s hand and towards Harry, who caught it and dove behind another Kareach member.
“This is fantastic!” Caser was saying, “I haven’t been assigned to the Ground Floor in weeks!”
“Harry,” he emphasized, “You can’t treat me this way. If you are uncomfortable working with me, you need to tell me instead of treating me with disrespect.”
“It’s Draco,” Hermione said evenly, looking straight at Harry.
“Don't flatter yourself, Malfoy. You're not using me. It was my idea, remember?” Harry forced himself to look Malfoy in the eye.
Harry nodded, “You’re right. Let’s go to the Ministry.”
“She’ll think you're grieving,” Harry insisted, “And even if she doesn’t, we will hide you in a place she will never be able to find. Aviary, you are a muggleborn. If Ida,” Harry cringed as her name left his mouth, “Finds out you know, she won’t hesitate to kill you.”
“Okay,” Harry said hesitantly, grabbing a shot as the bartender slid it his was, “But let the record show I’m still going to be friends with Draco.”
Harry looked at Draco directly now for the first time. He looked exhausted, weary, beaten down. But he also looked fierce and determined. Harry believed him, believed in him.
“Fine,” Harry crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. If Malfoy wanted this to be a bitter and jaded reunion, Harry would make it one, “I have to say, asking the questions instead of criticizing me for not answering correctly might make this run at your desired pace, don’t you think?”
Padma wasted no time, “The bug, it worked. Ida and the entirety of Kareach are coming to the Ministry in less than an hour! Meet Ron at the phone booth as soon as possible.”
“Thank you, Potter,” Savant responded, “Take care.”
“After what?” Ginny questioned, looking from the girls to Harry.
“We think Blaise Zabini is involved with the attacks,” he said boldly, knowing the only way to say it was quickly and firmly.
“I work at the hospital,” Harry stated.
He hung out before the conversation could get any more disastrous. As soon as Harry had heard that Malfoy ‘really needed to talk to him’, he knew he had no choice but to go. Malfoy could have no information that Harry could risk meeting a Burrow lunch for.
“Yes,” Angelina interjected, as George looked like he was going to respond, “Dean and Seamus are expecting us.”
The minutes seem to last longer as they waited for any word from Padma. After about forty minutes of hearing nothing, Draco stood up and began to pace the room.
“Was this house really the headquarters to the Order?” she asked. Harry heard a hint of excitement in her voice for the first time since she had arrived at his house that evening.
Suddenly it came to Harry why Ron was so upset. Why he couldn’t control himself, why he couldn’t bring himself to tell Hermione what was going on. Harry thought about Christmas and Christmas Eve, where Hermione had been the only one not drinking, insisting she hadn’t been drinking as much lately. No one questioned this, as Hermione had never been much of a drinker. But every Christmas, Hermione never failed to have a glass or two of wine from the local brewery that only opened for the holidays. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to drink; it was that she couldn’t.
Ginny knew him well enough to know he had gone into a thought spiral. She stood up and walked over to his side, peering into his eyes.
“Wolfsbane?” Harry said aloud, realizing exactly who Healer Patrick had an interview with. Trying to ignore the fact Malfoy was once again in the building, he opened the door and walked into Seb’s room, where he resumed his reading of a book, which Harry now realized was ‘Quidditch Through the Ages’.
“Wow,” Ron said, “Padma, I never expected you to be the sappy type.”
Without any warning, Harry felt a sudden urge to run toward him and grab on to Draco. Just hold him, wrap his arms around him. All because Draco looked so serious in his attempt to look for who was no doubt Harry, most likely to talk about the investigation. Why else would he show up midday in what was without a question the most muggle outfit Harry had ever seen Draco in? He was in older looking jeans and a black t-shirt, which somehow looked laid-back and inexplicably regal at the same time. It was working almost too well for him. Harry tore his eyes and mind away from his unexpected evaluations and desires of Draco and made a quick attempt to leave the canteen, heart racing haphazardly. He was almost to the lift doors when he felt a shot of air beside him. He was soon standing directly beside, you guessed it, Draco Malfoy.
“I thought he was with Draco!” Harry cut Ginny off.
“Thank goodness you are here!” Blaise said, “If I had to spend another moment with Draco here, I was going to lose my mind!’
Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, “When did you talk to Scorp about all of this?”
“What? I am not!” Harry protested.
Harry thought it would be safe enough to ask what house Scorpius’s mother had been in when she was at Hogwarts, but before he could, Malfoy walked back into the room.
“Oi, aunt Lina!” James yelled from across the room. “Can you spin for us? We tried to get Lily to spin for us but she wasn’t interested.”
Malfoy’s mouth fell open, “What’s the matter with Scorpius? Tori and I spent forever deciding upon it, for your information!” He took an angry swig of his glass and finished off his wine.
“Stop,” Harry instructed forcefully, reaching over to Draco to grab his arm, “You are fucking brilliant at what you do. You will find Kareach, and I will help if it kills me. And I mean that promise. I once died.”
Ida rolled her eyes and momentarily dropped her hair to reach for the mead still in Harry’s arms, “I’m going to need this if I’m going to get through this night alive.”
Harry startled as the door suddenly opened wide behind him and the telltale sounds of his family filtered into the room. Turning around, he watched as almost all of his friends and family from the match made their way through the doorway. Harry spotted his own kids, all clinging onto Ginny. When the kids saw Harry, they rushed over to give him a hug. He wrapped his arms around his children and said soft reassurances as he kept his eyes on Hermione, who was trying and failing to keep her composure as her entire family tells her how happy they are that she is okay. At his shoulder, Harry hears a familiar voice,
“Madam Pomfrey let you help her?” Harry asked, amazed. Madam Pomfrey was the most self-sufficient witch he had ever met. She could cure any quidditch injury without batting an eye.
“I do like being called bes,” Harry noted, “It roughly translates to “best friend’, correct? Meaning you think of me as your nearest and dearest friend?”
“We’ve been studying him,” Rose beamed, looking with admiration at the kite.
“Yeah,” Ginny said, easing up a bit on the intensity in her voice, “Although, I have to say, you don’t seem all that surprised. Especially if you just found out,” she looked at Harry, “Is there any reason for that?”
“Don’t start with me!” Ginny snapped, “I’m just as mad at you as I am Harry! And Ida! And my own fucking brother, who did the interrogation along with Padma and Ida! I can’t believe two of the people I count on most in the world would go behind my back and put my boyfriend on trial for something he would never do!”
Harry wanted to protest, but he found himself at a loss for words. It reminded him of his reason for fighting as hard as he did, all those years ago. He needed to avenge the ones he had loss and fight for a better life for the ones he still had.
“Oh, ha ha, Malfoy,” Harry said, turning to face him, “You should be thanking me, really. My kids are bloody fantastic.”
“No,” Harry shook his head, “That’s bloody insane! Does she have any idea who it was?”
“Actually,” Ida gestured towards Harry, “Harry did. And I think he could be on to something.”
“Keep your voice down!” Ida chided. “You’re not an Auror. I could be fired for things like this! Even if you are Harry bloody Potter.”
Draco must have realized what he was thinking again, because he said softly, “You’re the only one I can talk about this stuff still,” he continued, more animate now, “Anyway, I was able to trace a package of Chann that was sent to the Puddlemere team!”
“Hermione had a health scare, but she is going to be fine. It’s really not my position to tell you about it,” he told a deep breath and continued, “Seamus, there’s something I need to say. I did make a stop after the hospital.”
“I’m Aviary, Ida’s new partner,” she said, beaming, “I love you flat!”
“Youll?” Harry asked, “As in Remmins’s partner Youll?”
Rachel nodded, “That I understand. We just miss you around here, Harry. And you were among the best. Not that Ron, Padma, Nott, Reyes and the rest aren’t good!” she exclaimed, “You were just really great!”
Harry nodded and followed Molly into the kitchen. Lily, Albus and James were sitting side by side at the table, all eating the largest slices of apple pie Harry had ever seen.
“Draco?” Aviary finished, “He will forgive you. Ida told me how close you two have become over the past couple months. It must have been hard to do this. I think it was really brave. You fought for what you believed was the truth, even if it didn’t turn out the way you expected.”
Harry can’t help it; he began to laugh.
“So,” Draco said, composing himself, “Should I only refer to you as ‘Harry fucking Potter’, or will just ‘Harry’ do?”
“Expelliarmus!'' The spell caught Harry off guard as it hit him from the side. He turned around quickly to see Ida. She held his wand in her hand, a smile forming across her face. His anger drowned out the rest of the noise around him. Thinking of nothing but revenge, he lunged at Ida.
Sure enough, a moment later, the gap between Number 11 and Number 13 began to widen. Draco and Aviary looked on in amazement as Number 12 Grimmauld Place appeared before them. Harry gripped both of their arms and led them into the house quickly.
Seamus looked at him, clearly impressed, “That’s very wise, Mr. Potter,” he smiled softly then reached for Harry’s hand, “But in all seriousness, I don’t think you are a monster to go to Draco’s. I remember what it felt to really start to fall for someone. When I realized I liked Dean, I would have done anything if it meant a chance to just bloody kiss him. You are a great father and friend. Just look at all the things you did today! Many lives were saved because of you and Draco. You two… you seem to make a great team. And he must have changed if he was able to pull off what he did today. Harry, I support you endlessly. I hope you know that.”
Sorry was quickly abandoned as Roxy, Fred, Al and James all made their way across the room to throw themselves around Rose, Lily and Harry. Within seconds, Harry’s face had broken out into a huge grin. The confusion and the challenges of the day ebbing away, Harry said to Angelina, “Better get in on this! These kids hug like nobody’s business.”
“It's part of my charm,” Harry quipped, taking a long swing of his coffee and grinning at Malfoy, “Let’s get to work!”
“Oh, Ron,” Harry said softly. He couldn’t begin to imagine how scary Ron’s position must be, “I’m so sorry. But you are getting closer. You already caught one of them. I have full faith that you will get to the bottom of this. And I’ll be here to help, anyway you need me.”
“Fantastic!” Harry said. He grinned at Aviary, who gave him a half smile as she hugged him. Harry turned, about to give Draco a hug, when it dawned on him he wasn’t really in a position to do that. Instead, he sat back down on the couch.
“He’s quite easy to please,” Harry heard Ron mutter to Aviary as Seamus turned to talk to Ida about how cool her hair was (she had two braids rolled into buns on the sides of her head. In the middle of each bun was a sparkler that must have been charmed to remain burning without catching her hair on fire. Harry was also very impressed, and he wasn’t the only one. Luna was on the edge of her seat, staring with fascination at the sparklers).
“Get where? ” Aviary asked.
“When I don’t hear much of anything from you!” Draco exclaimed, “Not to mention, you were the one who choose to trust Ron and Padma!”
Brayan pointed at a newspaper clipping on his desk when Harry approached, He loudly whispered to Harry, as the room had fallen silent, “Look at this, Harry! Second page with a large quote from yours truly! You should be proud.”
“In the other room with Rose,” Angelina said.
“I’ll make sure of it,” Harry said to his son, trying to make himself feel better by thinking about how much his kids loved going to their grandparents’ house.
Ida nodded, “Yes. And he’s not the man you think he is. After refusing veritaserum, we found a significant reason for him to take it and discovered that he has orchestrated every attack.”
Aviary must have noticed his apprehension, because she placed her hand on his arm in a gesture of comfort. Harry glanced over at Draco, who was sitting in the armchair once again, looking down at the ground in complete stillness. Harry felt a sudden need to go over and wrap his arms around him and tell him everything was going to be alright, but there was no way in hell that was happening. After all they had said to each the past couple weeks, Harry doubted they would ever be in that place again. Draco had made it clear they weren’t capable of making a legitimate relationship work. It was time for Harry to realize that they would never be more than friends.
Ida shrugged, “Yes. I don’t know if you just want a relationship with him or if you want time to deal with the divorce or if you need to spend time figuring out your sexuality.”
Harry wakes up to the sound of tapping on the window. It takes him a moment to adjust to his settings. The room was small and starkly white, the only decoration being a small painting of a bowl of apples. A thick scent of firewhiskey made it hard to breath, but Harry had been so tired, sad and tipsy last night that he was able to ignore the intense smell and fall asleep on the scratchy sheets. He was in some small motel in Diagon Alley. Harry was pretty sure no one else was staying in this establishment, as the man working at the front desk had given him many confused and concerned looks when he said he wanted to book a room. His confusion was probably a mix of the danger Diagon Alley held at the moment and the fact that Harry Potter wanted to book a room while half crying and slurring on all his words.
Malfoy finished talking, a bit breathless, and grabbed his glass to quickly drain the dregs of his wine. He looked fierce, determined. Harry had never thought Malfoy was capable of working so hard at anything that didn’t directly benefit himself. He seemed to care an immense amount about finishing his report and working to stop the attacks. Harry didn’t know how to process this new, moral abiding Malfoy.
“No!” Draco screamed. The last thing Harry saw as the world went black was Draco diving in front of him.
“Seamus noticed a split second before Ida raised her wand. He grabbed Nev’s wand and cast two stupefys: one for you and one for Draco. You two collapsed just in time to avoid getting hit with the curse, and by that time the rest of us were firing so many curses at Ida and Aries that were knocked out cold within seconds,” Ginny explained.
“I have to get his,” he mumbled, walking towards the door and out into the hallway.
Harry opened his eyes, his vision blurred as he tried to figure out where he was. He realized he was lying down on something hard, but he couldn’t place where. The room was so bright, he had trouble focusing on anything other than the lights overhead. Harry attempted to move his arms to try and lever himself off the ground, but to his shock, he had no control over his own body. It dawned on him that his whole body was immobile, which could only be the work of a Petrificus Totalus charm. Despite this, he continued to try and move but nothing happened. He was stuck on the ground, unable to make a sound or figure out his surroundings.
“Ida is the exact reason we couldn’t tell too many Aurors,” Draco added, “Although we never imagined you or her would be involved in Kareach.”
Harry hesitated. He looked into his son's face: innocent, curious. Wanting the truth from someone he trusted. Harry owed him that much.
“Well, my wife is on the team,” Harry said, “There really isn’t anywhere else I could be.”
When Draco pulled away, Harry said, “Merlin, I could get used to this.”
“No way!” Ron put in.
“Ron? Padma?” Harry asked, trying but failing to keep the squeak of surprise out of his voice.
“But a pet ferret! I never would have thought…” Harry trailed off as he fell into a fit of laughter again.
“A Fidelus Charm?” Draco quit looking around to address Harry.
Ginny pulled back, tears streaming down her cheeks. She was still in her quidditch robes; she must have come straight from practice. Her hair was unkempt and sticking out around her face and her eyes were emblazoned in a fear Harry hadn’t seen in years. He felt relieved to see her, but guilt was slowing forming under his skin. Here she was, worried and desperate to make sure he was okay, and he had been coming to the realization that he had a crush on Draco Malfoy.
Brayan nodded, tears beginning to fall down his cheeks, “Yes. Oh, Harry, you know how fantastic she was. Everything she did was for this hospital. She was one of the best Healers this hospital had ever seen. She gave her life to help save as many innocent lives as possible, and for that, we need to all remember in the best possible light.”
“Once again, Harry, we can never know unless he tells us himself,” Seamus said, looking a little taken aback by Harry’s insistence.
When it came time for him to go home, he finally felt some sense of relief. He would get to go and see his kids and hopefully forget about his troubles for a while as he basked in their happiness and youthful energy. As he pulled out his wand to apparate, he realized that he didn’t have his jacket. It was one Molly had gotten for him, and he felt guilty leaving it behind. He reasoned it must be up in the canteen and took the lift to the fifth floor to search.
But it wasn’t until one o’clock that he heard Ginny arrive via the Floo. A few moments later, Ginny walked into the room, dressed in a sweatshirt and a pair of jeans.
“Then why leave? I heard it was because you thought Granger-Weasley had a particular scent to him that you just couldn’t ignore enough,” Malfoy was smiling quite annoyingly.
Hermione nodded at this; she couldn’t refute the fact the Spanish minister, that had once accused the Department of International Magical Cooperation of being a whole department of “pelagatos” (which essentially is a fun way to say the department was useless and got nothing done) now sent weekly updates to Hermione on both the Spanish Ministry and his own family (Hermione even helped pick out baby names for his daughter). Hermione was a force of nature and Harry had no doubts in his mind that she would have foreign assistance and cooperation for the attacks within days.
Harry looked up at the sign of the small cafe. It read “Smith and Walton’s Cafe’ in cursive next giant wooden cinnamon roll, which the sign in the window below the sign said was the cafe’s specialty. He silently thanked Malfoy for his selection of the meeting place. They had been meeting in various muggle locations to avoid being overheard by other witches and wizards. Last time they had gone to a bar in Watford that had been loud, smelly and generally impossible to concentrate in. Malfoy had agreed, and had clearly gone with the opposite approach in choosing this small and wonderfully smelling cafe. Not to mention the fact Harry was starving and was already planning on ordering multiple cinnamon rolls along with some type of tea. Harry walked towards the small wooden door of the cafe and pushed it open.
“So what’s going on between you two?” Ron audibly swallows his bite down, sputtering and coughing. Mrs Weasley would be outraged at his blatant show of manners, but she’s fortunately not here and everyone else at the table is used to his antics.
“I figure there were really just ingredients in the small package, yeah? I thought you were up to something.” He laughs to cover up the importance of the question, but Draco catches on and looks serious for a moment.
“Yeah, it’s me,” he answers. It’s odd to hear his first name spoken so softly, and not that hateful “Potter”. It's too intimate, a thought that makes his skin crawl in discomfort. Being intimate with the likes of Malfoy isn’t something he wants to imagine.
Malfoy sits on one of the tables next to the door. His feet barely reach the floor and they sway back and forth while he listens to what the girl says. Harry isn’t sure who she is, but her Slytherin jumper gives him a clue. She seems to be younger, a few years at least, but Harry can’t remember ever seeing her around. He can’t understand what they talk about, when she reaches into her bag, a Muggle backpack with a huge Slytherin emblem on it, and pulls out a small package with a green ribbon. She opens it, showing Malfoy the contents and he nods, taking it from her and putting it away inside his robe.
He spent a good half hour polishing the dulled statues, busts and pillars around the rather large Lobby. Each moment passing had Harry feeling panic at the prospect of Sirius or Remus coming up to check on him at home. Each false alarm from an Auror or pedestrian walking in and looking him over was torture.
A warm hand pressed to his back and he leaned into it hesitantly waiting for his savior’s response. This boy had given him everything he now had in life and he had just asked for more. It would be understandable if he was rejected, Draco would probably act flattered and play it off as a simple compliment to spare them mutual embarrassment. After all, it’s not like everyone was gay, a word his new fathers had only just taught him was an option to use. It didn’t seem like most people were or that it even occurred to them, Draco probably only knew because of his uncles.
Walburga didn’t budge and Harry eventually had to give up for now as Sirius came over, ears covered, to get him. He called over Walburga’s noise one last time anyway, “I’ll talk to you tomorrow Grandma!” He promised her and he caught Sirius’ begrudging smile at the exchange.
“I don’t want to. What if I dream about it? Just stay with me.”
Fifteen and cooped up, the gang that had expanded to include Pansy and Zabini were bickering about their Hogsmeade day. It had gone fine but left something to be desired. Zabini was quick to point out that something was butter beer.
“Why are we here?” He bemoaned to the wisp as it floated about.
That night he’d requested some time alone with Snape and asked every question he could think of on this new man he’d never had the chance to know before, the man that was supposed to be his Father.
He came to a large study with a flaming hearth. A wall of unidentifiable and messy items on one side and a corner full of fabric scraps lit up another section as he swept his gaze over everything. His eyes caught on the figure fumbling about to straighten a tray of cakes and tea. The woman looked normal in all respects. Plump and freckled with blonde locks reaching the floor even as she stood. Her dress was tied up in place for work and not relaxation, white puffs of bloomers peeking out where the trim of her skirt was hiked up.
“All those in favor of adoption in the case of Harry Potter my now cast their vote.” Minister Fudge stated. Harry’s eyes scanned the crowd as hands dangled up to be counted. His clutch on Nagini tightened as he caught the eyes of one that hadn’t raised their hand, Green eyes pleading. They seemed to come to a choice and raised their hand to be counted with the others, a kind of defeated look on their face. His breath caught and he looked to another, he mouthed “Please” at them and somehow it worked. The usually quick count edged on till anyone that had resigned to be undecided gave in. The minister watched in interest till he too gave his vote, siding with the obvious majority.
“So, you’re afraid he’ll stop you or disapprove?”
“She bit me the moment I walked in the shop as a child.” He frowned.
“Still can’t believe he did that for you Griphook.” Draco looked over to see one of the Goblins in a huff as he patted out the singe on his tailed coat. His eyes widened in understanding, the fire just now, Harry had charged forward to stop her setting one of the Gobins on fire. He looked down at Harry’s face, as color slowly returned, with a sense of wonder. Muggles, what strange creatures…
“By doing what?”
IRL my dog is currently digging in the wet dirt and I'm being yelled at to help and I think as we speak she's getting thrown in the shower? Yep showers going.
“Not if I have anything to say about it.” Harry threatened, the look of horror on the Slytherin’s face was perfect.
“If you aren’t trapped here why are you still in a…” Harry gestured to the room. He took in the dark room as it was lit by his torch, simple furniture had been arranged inside in a weak attempt at making a home.
With that done he now noticed the wardrobe. With a shallow inhale he walked them over to it and pulled it open. Surprisingly it was full of ordinary dresses. All black and intricate, something Bellatrix would wear, but he knew she never had. This was something put here for her. It was strange how many loving gestures there were in the way the room had been sorted by his Mother. He had known she loved Aunt Bella, but this went beyond all reason. Then, from the discreet cask set on the bottom of the wardrobe he saw a blueish light shining through the small container’s lid. That looked important.
“I know you too, you’re my precious baby.” Sirius babbled.
“I do not.” Draco was as red as Pansy, only by that point did Harry realize how he’d phrased himself and he began to match.
“Do you already regret this?” He heard from beside him and he paled suddenly.
Now at the spec of land his eyes focused in on a huge marble slab, raw and uncut. His pursuer still behind him he had nowhere to go but to the stone and he knew long before that realization that this had to be the cornerstone. He had to stop Narcissa now before she could use it.
It was shocking and disorienting. The ground shook like a bomb had gone off and for a few moments Harry was content to think it was just a tree being cut down. Then he heard the screams. The maddening and crazed screams as something blew them away in the next sounding of a large eruption. When he opened his eyes there was Draco, he’d bolted upright and rushed to pull his pants on, wand aimed at the door. He could see the tremor in how his lover held it, the fear.
Now it was just time to tell his cousin Sirius he was adopting. The investigation would be fast once they saw how Harry lived, it wouldn’t be hard to pass judgment. This was the best place to send Harry, he couldn’t bring him to the manor or hide him in the dorms after all. Sirius would be happy to be saving the life of a boy like him and his husband.
Thank you so much for reading to this point. I do apologize for taking so long to get back to Draco but there will be romance when we get there. My brain can't force plot to happen when it doesn't make sense, everything must make sense!
Her especially critical focus on werewolf’s had led her to where she was now, combing through Minister Fudge’s records for any mention of the recent proposals she had put forward. None had made it through it seemed and she seethed at that in her own way, by finding the closest important document about a magical being and shredding it.
Severus was lost to the past back in his armchair, fiddling with the seams on the arms where his hands rested over the edges. He was down to his shirt and black dress pants he never wore in school when he had to work with the labs, his usual garb of a formfitting long robe was a safety measure not a simple fashion. The white of his dress shirt made his skin look even paler and the fireplace unlit left him in shadows.
Harry felt his body give out as he slumped down into bed. Returning back with a face full of fresh bruises got him yelled at.
__________
“No soliciting!” One of the Goblins near the doors yelled after her as the entrance slammed shut again.
Hermione is finally here and I hope that the interactions with her are good enough to sound like an actual human. Luckily she's always sounded far to grown up for her own good so that lends itself a bit of leeway for me to play with by making her negotiable for certain things a kid would just not be having normally.
“We have to figure this out. We have to tell uncle Sirius and Remus right now.”
“What kind of dream?”
“It’s me you want! Don’t hurt hi—” And he knew that voice, didn’t he? He knew the other one too?
They sat in the library reading resources on safe harvesting methods for deadly plants they were working with in herbology. Harry slouched and used the thick book of anatomical plant pictures as a pillow to look over at Draco who was diligently writing in the infuriatingly perfect cursive, he did everything in.
“He’s healing, with no remnants of the curse. Ideal, but confusing. The Goblins don’t have magic. How did they…?”
“Are you ready?” He heard from above him in his haze.
Roody hummed as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of swirly candy, plopping it into Harry’s lap. He smiled as he watched the boy slowly take it, inspecting with a polite thank you before trying it. Fruit punch Jelly marble read the label and Harry tucked the wrapper away to keep it.
No excuse, just one of the reasons why...
“One more headcount everyone.” Albus called out, his ears ringing as they adjusted again to sound.
“I’m trying to let myself consider those things, but it’s hard to. At least for right now.” She sighed.
“That’s the train station though…They’re definitely going to notice I snuck out again.” He groaned to himself. “What am I doing.” He sighed. The wisp for its part was incredibly satisfied with his work.
The space had a fond enough set of memories attached to them, and it was almost strange to notice such an old detail outside of a pensive. He found it easily after that, the empty walls like every other one down here.
“We will take care of it this time if you don’t mind Draco.” Tom reached over to pat his head lightly to gain his attention and draw him back from the internal torment he was wallowing in again.
That fear was realized when he was bound by what felt like invisible ropes around his whole body. The next moment he felt the solid kick to his side, he gasped in pain as his mass was shoved off the box he’d been holding to that point. He felt one of the twin’s inventions dig into the side of his hip bone uselessly as he looked up at the figure glaring down at him.
“A bad one.”
“So, there’s a clear possibility that we can persuade it like the mandrakes, speaking of—Draco you better hurry with the wands.” Harry looked back at Draco sprinting up to shove a handful of sticks into his pocket. They watched the roused mandrakes lay back down immediately after.
“Goodbye Draco. Please come back again.” Harry called out weakly.
I can't say I know if this is turning out well written, I hope that when I have a clear head and read the finished piece back that there won't be any utterly horrible mistakes. Despite this being a work in progress I'm overwhelmed by how many people have read this already and I won't miss the chance to say it again, Thank you. I hope that this can fulfill other peoples dreams like it is mine.
The two laughed and joked, their troubles drifting away as they always did. They were good at that.
“Although it may not be the best for your defense. We cannot afford to let any of you to be taken in. I need time to find proof that it wasn’t you that broke into the Dursley home last night. Once you’re carted in front of that Jury again their opinion is going to be what sways them right now. This was a big step to take against our world’s segregation issues. If it wasn’t this it would be something else and that may still be the case. I don’t know how many people are going to act out, this was just the first attack. We cannot let this go down the way they wanted or it could permanently ruin all of your lives.” Tom was practically snarling by the end; Sirius wasn’t far off. It was a fight they were asking for by doing this.
Bella huffed and snarled viciously to herself once her body trembled from exhaustion and magical drain. She allowed her thoughts to stray to the portraits, a devilishly amusing thought it was indeed. What would the old crone’s have to say, to scream and sling at the newest Black mistake to grace their halls. Bellatrix knew more than most how incredibly annoying the stupid paintings were, how impossible to shut up. The weak-minded little rat would be in tears long before she would reach them, and she would reach them…
“Ravenclaw’s private journals in the tower.” Minerva McGonagall shouted from her spot as she listened to them. “There on display.”
“I’ll tell your mother for you, shall I? It may be easier that way. Don’t forget to make a good letter though, she’ll want at least something.” The stern man had a gentle tone to his voice, one of those rare moments where he let himself be soft.
Was this really okay? Will Draco hate him now? Dumbledore said it was okay though. He said it didn’t matter.
The two looked at him wide eyed and silent as they stewed with an abundance of excuses. Ultimately The potion’s master huffed and rested his hands along the desk before him as he looked down on his students.
“Another Hatchling?” She almost purred. “I heard of a Hatchling that came through while we where out, will I get to warm it?”
Thank you for reading and if you liked what you've read so far please give me hearts so my work can be better found by others. Another update will come on next Monday as promised.
“You aren’t going to go after my Mother?” The words had almost been too soft to hear.
“Oh, Come in my Dear. I do love a good visit every so often.” A woman’s voice rang out.
“I will be conducting this interview with you, your wife and child here. Roody will talk to you in private Mister Potter.” With that he seemed to be done with Harry and Rodolfus strode over to meet him.
The room brightened anew at his uplift in mood and Sirius started passing the rest of the presents out. In the end Harry was surprised by a gift from the Weasley’s, Ron had sent a quidditch poster of a famous Ravenclaw and Mrs. Weasley had sent him a warm sweater he had thrown on immediately that clashed wonderfully with his secretly dubbed “elf” attire.
A laugh from behind-Malcolm. “Think he’s a poof?”
His shoes clicking against the marbled floors of the expansive estate. Ten men at his back made up a formidable team and they eased into the main hall at the center of the buildings structure, walls laden with benches and a small fountain. He had been just about to question the man that had welcomed them in, Mr. McLaren, who had claimed to be staying with friends in the Goyal Villa when all hell broke loose.
“I know you.” Harry laughed through a tiny sob into Sirius’ shoulder. The larger man adjusting his hold to pull Lupin in close so they could both get to their son.
“Guess we are.” He was in his dueling stance alongside Moody who, with his many encumbered body parts had wisely chosen to stay were his modified eye could best be of use.
“The center of the floor here, in an intersection, it’s walls held four paintings looking inwards to the middle of the foot traffic.” Albus was looking around with new eyes, searching as he held a hand up and leaned awkwardly. He started a fast pace, taking a few turns and twists everyone else was eager to copy.
“Don’t make me pee on you.” Harry threatened.
When he woke up, he was laid out on the fainter with Narcissa watching him in the armchair at the corner of the room next to her books. His coat was gone, hung by the entrance hooks. His head felt fuzzy and he wobbled up into a sitting position, instant if not scattered relief took him when he felt an invisible hand slip into his. He hadn’t been left alone. He could feel the weight of his wand still in its holster on his inner forearm.
“I’ll remember.” He called back over his shoulder.
“I told him, I told Father I chose you. I always chose you, there was never another.” Now they shared tears between each other. “But I can’t ask him to…”
“When fire burns and rock descend, I come about. Wasn’t that in a book somewhere?”
“I didn’t ask for the conversation to turn to this.” Tom grit out.
“There!” He choked as he bared down on the finger and thrust up into the air helplessly. “There Harry. Get going, I can’t take this all night.”
“I love you, you crazy magic Nazi.” A teasing tone did nothing to hide Harry’s sincerity.
Harry just looked up at him, Draco held no sympathy, this boy, this dirt covered muggle looked like an utter mess and it was fitting. His father would have agreed. He snorted to himself at the thought.
“Today we get glasses, I will personally feel much better once you aren’t squinting with that look you keep giving. How much does that actually help?”
“It wasn’t you.” He answered back, Snape holding weakly onto a hollow feeling in his chest.
Draco looked down on his own thighs in the mirror knowing the caning marks would have littered his back just as prominently. Not because he had endured torture like Harry but because it was every single hit he’d ever taken for his mistakes or misbehaving. He wouldn’t call it abuse as much as Rita’s article still burned him.
“That just about describes it. When it doesn’t play out the way you expect, how does it feel?”
“It’s about this boy over in the muggle world.”
“Kreacher will help the young master.” The elf nodded, not a hint of ridicule in the way he addressed the boy. A muggle. For a pureblood family house elf to show no disapproval over a muggle heir, Sirius could feel his head start to spin. Maybe he didn’t have anything to worry about after all.
“We could always bribe Ron into finishing his paper with something.” Hermione shook her head helplessly. Apparently, this was a common issue.
“She probably didn’t mean for that to happen.” Harry smiled. “Alright so, when fire burns and rock descend, I come about, no door can hold me or lie spout. What am I?”
“I know, and I also know you can’t do this on your own. It’s been getting harder. I’ve seen the way you space out more and more thinking about home. I won’t let you go alone.”
I'm so giddy about finally posting this, I can't wait to start freaking you guys out with cliff hangers and twists. I think I got a good couple in there and I'm now trying to make a ramp up for a big final plot-line the arcs leading up to.
Taking a note from Draco, Harry had closed and locked his door. Deciding to take Nagini with him had resulted in him draping her over his shoulder and arms like a very heavy scarf. With how oversized she was it was like hanging a full backpack from around his neck and it took everything he had to ignore how this already felt like an incredibly unsafe maneuver. He had a large enough window in the room to squeeze through and a pipe he could slide down if he was careful. The book was tucked into a sizable inner pocket of his jacket despite its continued attempts to escape. His pants pockets were stuffed with his usual weapons of choice and a few additional tools for the creatures he’d be dealing with.
“Nice boy, isn’t he?” Arthur smiled as he helped Molly fly the dishes into the kitchenette with a swish of his wand.
“Like my glasses.”
Thank you to everyone who's read so far, you've all given me a reason to keep writing and posting. Knowing that it's for someone makes not only a difference, but it gives what I make a meaning beyond the expanse of my own mind. I'm thankful that there is a platform out there where my writing won't just gather dust and die without finding the people it was meant for.
The wet droplet beading at Harrys tip smeared on Draco’s hand in his blind search and Harry bucked up involuntarily at the first contact. Draco used the tip to guide his hand down around the length of hardening cock, stopping along the way to trace the veins that textured his decent.
“Look up Harry, I’d hate for you to miss this. It being your first time I thought we’d walk you down DiagonAlley before going home for the day.” Harry glanced up and gasped, “You’ve had a time of it, I’m sure the air will do wonders before packing into the house, it’s snug with all the children but I promise we’ll have you nice and tucked in with them in no time.”
Harry just turned and walked over to the magical beings, who had seen fit to rebury themselves. He watched in fascination as they nibbled down the roots of weeds and small bunches of mushroom heads. “Come here often then?” He attempted.
“I see where you’re going with this. Yes, I agree. Gryffindor would have you trying to brute force yourself through problems. Slytherin would have you find a way around, not a bad option. Ravenclaw would be a good choice besides that, the power of knowledge can make one indispensable, can give you a way to apply all the other attributes you’ve already learned well. To overcome adversity, one must be able to perceive the truth of a threat, and the best ways to deal with it.”
“Language.” The voice said from behind them and as Harry whipped around, he watched the Auror that had been protecting their backs fall to the ground with a thud. With that there were two.
“Me and Remus thought it up after the detention incident. Since you were looking for things to use and Draco told us about the sea glass, there’s an open facet you can put it in on the necklace. See, we figured giving you some protective armor might do the trick to keeping you safe for whenever you run off on us. Now, if you ever feel like you need it you have something that can counteract spells and most basic curses thrown your way. No binding or tripping jinxes or befuddlement, any of the most used spells really. There’s a parchment with it to help you get a sense of what they can do.” He was going crimson as he explained and Harry picked up one of the gauntlets that reminded him of the wonder woman comic he’d seen in the library once.
“Dear boy, what makes you think I regret what I did?” Gellert stood slowly, his frame taking up half the cell room and Harry heart drummed loudly in his chest in response. “No, Albus will see I’m right and come back because I am the only one who can understand him, give him what he needs as he can me. Only together can we forge a new stone. You are not but a momentary disturbance, in what fashion should you be removed?”
“That it?”
“Harry Potter.” She called out in an uplifting tone. She was past the line of ministry officials falling over themselves outside, sweating through their clothes about Gringotts being its own country. The little bird had been a delightful surprise in accommodating her like this. “You called for me.”
“You’re taking this way too seriously. It was just a dream.”
“Things would have been different.” Severus tried to speak in his usual drawl and was somehow failing miserably for probably the second time in his life, the first being the day Lucius stopped talking to him.
“Harry,” Draco snapped his fingers in front of his face. “What kind of dream, you have to tell me. Was there someone in it, even just talking about it can stop it from getting in again.”
“The point to not announcing ourselves was to see his living conditions unchanged for the occasion.” Milton responded. This seemed to start up the yelling again.
“We get it, don’t stress out, it’s just how we are. Some people think it’s a Slytherin thing, personally I think it’s a pureblood thing.” Blaze whispered to Harry as the others kept talking.
“Only one thing we can do. Beat the fucking daylights out of him.” Cheers sounded at the order given by their leader. “make him regret the day he was born mates, no one looks at my best mate like that. Insulting my friend was your worst mistake Punss.”
“I wouldn’t.” Draco cut in, the look Remus had told them he would have said the same thing, was going to.
The Files of one Harry Potter and the acquisition to remove him from his current guardianship flew through the ministry’s social departments in the clutches of a certain official’s Owl. It’s huge bug eyes not faltering to look from its intended path. The little thing diving into an office and slamming enthusiastically down on top of a similar file; to be precise, the request of adoption for one Harry Potter by the Black head and family.
“Just hang on for me old man.” He said under his breath as he thought of the one he loved.
It was dead quiet in the chamber by the end of the pensive viewing. Stony faces recounted the testimony and outlined the lies and mistruths. Damning evidence, they all knew it from the start. Many scenes like this one had happened over the years in these rooms. After the war countless men and women were sentenced to Azkaban for far worse. The Dursley family was just another abusive household, nothing these witnesses haven’t seen before.
In front of the potion master’s door he was hesitant as he knocked, preparing to disturb the other’s early morning. The feeling he got that he wasn’t supposed to be here was odd, like his every hairs were sensitive and on end.
“What are you thinking?” Harry asked as Draco’s brow furrowed furiously. He untwisted his features to look back at the muggle.
The blonde hadn’t let Harry’s hand go as it slipped off him, his own holding the limp fingers. “That would be wonderful Uncle, we haven’t had time to sit together for a while.” He attempted to say in an unconcerned tone, but given the circumstances sounded incredibly forced.
“Yes father.” He answered robotically, staring into nothing.
A series of first grade-esc craft tools like pipe cleaners and buttons, what looked like scented markers that promised they were safe to put in your mouth and a few bags of popcorn yet to be nuked in a microwave of which they had none. The part that made Harry start to giggle was the box on the floor that said ‘make your own tree’ in bold letters and looked like it was a 3-d model or puzzle with a lack of clear labeling.
“Once you can hold a mop and no sooner.” One chirped almost viciously. Harry couldn’t help a laugh that set off a new series of painful coughs and gasps.
“Do we want something to share?” Harry looked over everyone’s faces.
“Don’t answer those!” Harry calls out as he works his way next to the two adults. “That’s not the riddle.”
Harry felt himself being dragged along the ground, soil devoid of the usual sharp or jagged miscellaneous matter found outdoors and it reminded him somewhere in the back of his mind that this was a garden and not just any random walking path. This was Hufflepuffs garden, not just any magic forest.
“I should have you thrown out for what you’re trying to do here. Despite doing our trade with all sorts, wizards have always been despised here let alone a muggle.” The Goblin’s nose crinkled up to one side. “Why should we let you stay when it will surely cost us to house your little party.” His tone dropping.
“Couldn’t tell you. I guess there’s the zoo, don’t think they’ll let you bring your drinks with you. Do you live around here?”

His fear of his Aunt should have outweighed everything. Maybe it did. Maybe he was so afraid of her that thinking of leaving anyone else to her was enough to shock him into motion. That someone right now was Harry, his muggle Harry, who he’d left in that park at night months ago with a promise. He had been steeling himself for a moment like this, so incredibly important, happening too fast, with everyone ready to judge the aftermath, but all he could do was what he felt was what he wanted. It wasn’t what anyone else wanted despite his uncles, no, when he saw his fellow Slytherins or his father again he was going to be reminded of that reality.
“What do you want Malfoy?” Severus drawled. He looked like he had some idea, but maybe he didn’t because when Lucius spoke his eyebrows rose slowly in surprise.
Harry had tucked his trunk on the above shelfing of the booth along with Ron’s and they reclined into adjacent velvet benches. The view of Kings cross station grew small behind them till it turned into nothing but fields of green. The world shook bellow them as the train gained speed and they were forced to close the window to stop the wind rushing in.
The Mandrake was supposed to grow in the ground and when mature and pulled from the ground it could scream so loud it would kill the one attacking it. Only certain animals were known to feed of their leaves safely. These ones had grown straight out of the ground though, dislodged and stood free, apparently till they became these trees, the very forest he was surrounded by.
“Perhaps this will be the thing to prove the point once and for all to the wizarding community.” He added neutrally, almost laughing when his father took what he said in the interpretation he expected.
“Remus Lupin speaking, for the record. Hello, you all know me. I have taught some of your children and gone to school with most of you. I know that me and Sirius were not always the most responsible back then and I do apologize for that even now. I have been given the unique chance in my position to not only speak on behalf of a long-suffering minority in the magical world but to also teach my students the danger and very real ways to stop that danger associated with werewolves among many other things. When you have lived your entire life with something it becomes second nature to live accommodating it. I am not the reckless youth of my past; I am not a danger to society and most importantly I am not a danger to my family or the children under my care. I have always been willing to fight for this and I do it now again this day in hope that you will make the kind decision instead of the “logical” one.” Remus dipped into a shallow bow before returning to Sirius, their hands clasping together in a tight grip.
He keeps himself still, listens for any sounds in the house and smiles when he hears a faint moan from somewhere above. The walls aren’t thick, but the actual noise has to be quite loud to be heard down here. Harry picks the parcel up and wanders up the stairs to the first floor, stopping right outside the sitting room.
After that they venture to unusual places quite often. They explore London, starting with the huge garden at Grimmauld Place, which is nice but not quite public enough, but the night is sticky warm as are their bodies and the shout with which Draco comes is loud enough to wake more than one straying neighborhood dog.
They sit for a few minutes, although Draco is seemingly dancing on Harry’s lap, pushing his cock into Harry’s loose fist and grinding his arse back into his very pronounced erection.
It was Harry who took away the pain, who supported Draco when everything came tumbling down on him. He never used his mighty name, never fought for Draco in public, but was supportive in every way Draco could imagine.
Gladly, the mission is done now and all that is left to do is wait for Harry’s birthday.
At long last he decides to wear his plain white greatcoat and matching boots. It feels like the simple choice took forever and he hurriedly leaves their small cottage and Apparates to Wiltshire.
With a sigh he sits down as well, propped up against a small tree trunk. It’s his favourite place in the world and Harry wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
The night is cold, but the stars shine bright above Ladies Pond and their bench is unoccupied when they get there. All the time Draco spent racking his brain what to do pays off when he sees Harry’s eyes light up in recognition. They settle under the blankets, enjoying a quiet night, just the two of them, and when the sun comes up, they share a single perfect kiss.
That’s the longest that Harry has ever heard Malfoy talk and he doesn’t know where to start. So he picks up that last notion and begins his own tale.
There’s only a handful of things he finds useful; how to dress properly, and appear to be aloof and confident, or how to walk and talk and move. But of all the useless things he learned and that are still seared into his brain, speaking the language of flowers is the most useful.
More steps echo through the silent forest, and for the first time in years Harry sees his parents again. They hold each other’s hands, identical smiles on their faces, as they step beside Draco. His mother only has eyes for him, but his father puts his other hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“It’s alright, Steph. Thank you,” Malfoy says nonchalantly, dismissing her. She takes the opportunity, obviously glad to escape, and leaves. He smiles pleasantly at Harry, like he did nothing wrong, and maybe he didn’t, but the doubt is there now, poisoning Harry’s thoughts. Was everything just an elaborate distraction from Malfoy’s plans? He doesn’t know.
The hallway is open, pompous, with ceiling-high windows, thick columns, and wide arches. There are rich, crimson curtains and gilded ornaments, a stark contrast to the plain and dusty bedroom he just left. Light shines through the stained-glass windows, but it looks wrong, artificial. The hall isn’t dark, but the more details Harry tries to make out, the more they evade him. He thinks he can see cobwebs and thick dust in the corner of his eyes, but when he turns, everything looks perfect on the surface.
“You’re such a sap, Potter, it’s disgusting!” Draco smiles to take away the bite. He barely admits it out loud, but he adores Harry’s romantic tendencies. They make him feel wanted, loved, desired and many other things, a heady cocktail of emotions. He chirrups, an unintentional sound that comes from deep inside him, from the creature that shares his blood.
The blood comes off easily under the heavy spray of cold water. It wakes his muted senses, clearing his head from some lingering cobwebs. It’s quite obvious what’s happening here. He remembers the Death Eaters invading Hogwarts, Malfoy leading them up the Astronomy tower. He remembers Snape and Dumbledore and doesn’t want to remember the rest. The burning rage that races through his veins, igniting his blood, isn’t new to him, but as he exits the bathroom, he knows where to go.
This is one of those chapters that were impossibly hard to write... like, how would two guys even use the language of flowers, even if one of them is a poncy git like Draco?
Seemingly out of thin air, Calliope, the owner, materialises before them. She’s an intimidating person no matter the circumstances, but today it’s especially strong. He barely suppresses the need to avert his eyes and bow his head. He shakes a little in her presence and curses himself for being this weak, this needy. It doesn’t make any sense to cower before her - there are strict rules in the BDSM community and Calliope would never even touch him casually without expressed permission, but he still feels the urge to present himself in front of her. Her presence is that commanding.
"Malfoy," Harry says, voice dripping with disdain. Everything that is wrong with this day is probably his fault, Harry's sure of it. It always is, somehow, Malfoy’s fault. He remembers second year vividly or third year. His ‘favourite’ surely is sixth year, but he shies away from the memories. Everything is too painful, especially since it feels like it just happened yesterday.
Today is a rare occasion. It’s an uneventful week for the both of them. Crime rates are down due to the heat wave that fries Britain for four weeks and counting, and people seem to suffer too much from the sweltering heat to raise their wands.
Ron nods, like he understands completely, but the wary expression in his eyes belies the motion. “So you think he’s up to something?” he asks finally, before he cuts another huge piece of pie and crams it into his mouth. Hermione lets her cutlery clatter onto the table and gets up, huffing in disgust, before she leaves the Great Hall, probably heading for the library.
He puts the ring on, like a wedding ring, forever bound to the ones that came before, that he left behind. At first, nothing happens, but he isn’t concerned. Maybe the dead are shy of the living. He’s feeling a bit shy, too.
He looks so serious, counting out everything Harry needs to buy, that Harry can’t help but ask: “And why would I need so many new clothes? The jeans are perfectly fine!”
When Harry laughs, he does it with his whole body. He bends at the waist, one hand going to his stomach, the other hand braced on his knee. Between the hearty guffaw he wheezes, small puffs of air that Draco finds equally appalling and endearing. It makes him smile and soon they’re both laughing daftly.
His shower is quick, his shaving spell clean, and he’s ready to go ten minutes before the Portkey activates. Only Draco isn’t in the parlour or anywhere else, which means he’s still getting ready. He’s a vain man, his husband, but most of the time it’s worthwhile to wait on him. Not more than a minute ticks by when he hears the faint click of heels on wood.
One by one, every mistletoe in the street comes loose and follows the pair. When Harry and Draco stop to kiss, each piece vanishes under Draco’s cloak, getting back into the small package with the green ribbon.
It's already Friday here, which means HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY. Hope you like this year's present just as much as last year's.
He opens his eyes when he feels something break in his mind, causing even more pain. His body begs him to pass out, but a painless oblivion isn’t meant for Draco. Instead he looks up to find cold, crimson eyes and a malicious, but very satisfied smile.
It wiggles back and forth in an almost hypnotic rhythm and Harry sees the enchanted buttplug at work. He has set the sequence before he left, when to vibrate and when to thrust and just now it slowly pushes back and forth, changing the angle every so often, eliciting a moan when it hits that special spot inside his wriggling lover.
Obviously Hermione and Ron weren’t so sure if it was right to have any contact with Malfoy. They constantly questioned their connection and it took almost two years to finally make them see that, yes, he and Draco were meant for each other.
One day Harry showed him how to create playlists - a series of songs that play in a specific order - and ever since Draco’s life has its own soundtrack.
Their kiss gets heated fast, but they’re still on the ground and the cold slowly seeps into Harry’s anorak, making him shiver. They struggle to get up, barely able to let go now that they have found each other. Malfoy smiles, and it looks almost like the one at Honeydukes, but even more ecstatic. Harry feels his own cheeks hurting pleasantly from doing the same.
“It’s alright, Harry. I’d rather see him grow up, but I know he will live in a better world than we ever had. He will be loved and taken care of, and that’s all I could wish for.”
Draco is filthy when he finally gets home after twelve hours of sick people. While he is usually working on the fourth floor with long-term spell damage victims, whenever there is an epidemic, he is helping out. Winters are filled with sick children waiting to get their Pepper-Up, summers with irresponsible adults suffering heat strokes.
Draco had been in a fowl mood, never mind an undersexed Veela is a nightmare.
“Let’s just bring this to the post office, then we can do something more pleasant.”
Instead of soft touches, Harry slaps both tits, soft at first, but quickly warming to the task. It’s too dark to see properly, but he still sees the skin redden. Draco’s breath hitches, not prepared for a different sensation, but he’s practically melting when his masochistic side wins. He’s a slut for pain, soaking up even the little things Harry gives him, always eager for more. There’s not much to do in this setting, but he can up his game just a little more.
In stark contrast, she’s wearing the least aggressive clothes he has ever seen on a person. Her hair falls openly over her shoulders, mousy brown and a little bleak, complimenting her heart-shaped face. Her spaghetti strap dress has a pattern of little cherries and birds, more suited for a teenager than a grown woman, but it suits her. She would look completely out of place in her shop if it wasn’t for the predatory glint in her eyes and her domineering personality.
Harry raises an eyebrow in surprise and question. Apparently he and Malfoy are on a first-name basis, not that he can remember how that could come to be. He wonders what to do. He’s in a strange house, he can’t remember his life past eighth year. Maybe he’s trapped, maybe not, but aside from himself and his school nemesis, there’s nobody else here.
He watches as Draco makes his slow way up, the lead again dangling from his collar and hindering his movements even more. He nearly loses his balance as his hands get tangled up with the soft leather, and the scene is accompanied by moans of intense pain.
Suddenly chairs scrape on the floor, signalling that the lesson is over. They scatter apart, and only now Harry becomes aware of how close they’ve come during their short conversation. It’s almost intimate, like they are actual friends putting their heads together to share secrets. He catches Malfoy’s gaze, like he wants to say something and Harry leans back, closing the gap between them. It’s hard to hear him over the rustle of parchment and chattering students, and Malfoy doesn’t make it easier, almost whispering. “If you really want to buy a new jumper, we could meet tomorrow in Hogsmeade. In all honesty, Potter, you really look like you could use some help. I’ll even promise not to be too overbearing.”
Draco is nervous, a state he finds himself in quite often. Anxiety is his trusted companion since the war, and sometimes it peaks so high that his hands shake and his breath comes in short, painful puffs. Fortunately, today it isn’t so bad.
The slender, white legs are parted by a spreader bar and decorated with intricate leather strips. They crisscross from ankle to upper thigh where they meet with an equally exciting leather harness. His present has rolled over onto his stomach, to relieve the pressure on his hands bound behind his back. The spreader bar forces him on his knees which in turn highlights the fine, firm arse.
Harry loves his birthday. True, it took almost two decades before he developed a taste for it, but now he can’t get enough. He loves the cakes especially made for this occasion; he loves the scent of fresh flowers that will flood his house and his office. He loves the feast Mrs Weasley dishes up every year; the home cooked meals, the treacle tart snitches; the biscuits drenched in colourful icing, the firewhiskey served late after dinner. He loves meeting his friends; his extended family, being free of the madness that is the Auror Office, relaxing in his favourite armchair with mundane conversation. But most of all, Harry loves his presents.
The prompt really gave me trouble and it took the better part of a week to know what I wanted to write...
Draco whimpers when the cold metal encases his balls on both sides, and he certainly feels the pressure around them as Harry fastens the bolts, but he has yet to experience the humbler fully. When everything is tightly in place, Harry lets go of both humbler and balls, and watches Draco’s reaction.
After that they got reckless but, fortunately, never caught. Not even when Draco rimmed Harry at the Quidditch cup final between the Cannons and the Harpies that resulted in the first win ever for the Cannons. It was a huge success and whenever Ron talks about that day - Do you remember Harry, do you!? You were there, you lucky bastard! - Harry gets semi-hard in his pants. For years he wonders if he was actually the reason the Harpies lost, since he’s sure their Disillusionment Charm slipped for a second and Ginny stared at him wide eyed before a Bludger cleanly knocked her off her broom. Their best Chaser down the Harpies stood no chance.
As soon as Draco has himself under control again, Harry resumes to stroke him, light touches that tickle, and Draco tries hard not to squirm too much, he really does, but to no avail. A broken moan erupts from his throat as the pain intensifies and he shakes with the effort to stay still.
When they’re out, he’s is immaculate, not one hair out of place, his clothes impeccable. Since they’re together Draco has gained some weight, not much, just enough to smooth out his pointy face. Secretly he likes Draco more like this. Harry loved him when they were fresh out of school and he loves him even more now, years later.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nods eagerly. He doesn’t know what will happen, but he knows Harry has some special things planned for them, and taking the potions will surely make it even more special. He will still read the instructions and decide only then what he will do, but he trusts his husband to have chosen something that is worth his time.
They fall silent again, while Malfoy drinks more water and Harry contemplates all he’s heard. At least people know they’re in trouble and try to rescue them. And it’s Ron and Hermione, the two people Harry can rely on most in this world.
He’s none the wiser on Thursday, when he goes looking for Malfoy in the dungeons, to ask him when they want to meet on Saturday. He hears Malfoy’s voice from the potion’s cabinet, but it isn’t the only one. There is also a female voice, but it’s not Pansy and Harry’s curiosity instantly goes into overdrive. What are they doing here, at this time, late on Thursday evening? Malfoy should have been in the library, but when Harry went there, there was no one but Madam Pince and he was forced to actually look for him. Something doesn’t sit right with Harry, but he hasn’t used his cloak in forever and it’s currently in his dorm. Harry decides to make as little sound as possible and goes to investigate.
Draco flinches, part of it in fear what Harry’s about to do to him if he disobeys. Their scenes are hard sometimes, bordering on extreme, but it’s how they both like it. And they both have safe words in case something goes wrong or they both underestimate the power of their fantasies. It happens occasionally, but it’s a permanent process of learning each other’s boundaries.
When he was fresh out of school, he’d been tempted to just leave it all behind and start a new life somewhere people didn’t know about Harry Potter and how he saved Britain from the maddest Wizard of all times.
“He’s a right git, but you did well, choosing him,” his father says, looking smug and proud.
Apologies to my readers, but again it isn't my fault it took so long to update. We can always blame the fiance (since he isn't here to defend himself), because he took so long to look at the next chapter. To make it up to you, he finished four entire chapters that I will post right away for you. All remaining mistakes are also his fault, if you want to complain ;)
They haven’t been to the park since they met there all those years ago, but Draco finds the way easily.
Wet noises drown out the singing on the stage, not that Harry would have paid any attention, but there’s something so wicked about receiving a blowjob while being in a fancy setting like an Opera House, it’s the actual reason he shoots his load without warning and almost unwillingly.
They both burst out with laughter and from then on they really hit it off. They avoid talking about the war, naturally, but they talk about everything else. They complain about those ridiculous couples everywhere, about being sick of the sound of smooching and flirting, the overly-sweet things that make their teeth rot. It’s embarrassing listening to them.
He’s still wondering where he is or why he’s even here when the voice calls for him again. Despite the tiredness in his bones and the confusion he picks up the discarded crimson robes near the door and moves outside the bedroom.
By the time an owl taps on his window, carrying a small note from Harry that he’s staying at Ron’s for a few days, Draco has spoken to Healer Merrygold and is currently pumped full of potions. Merrygold whirls around the room, casting diagnostic spells in between harsh lectures on common sense, awful Healers and cantankerous colleagues.
“Filch was not going to kill us.” He laughed a bit and deflated as he waited for Draco to do or say something.
“Need help there beautiful?” His muggle’s question dripping with sarcasm.
It felt too right. Too placed. The feelings that told him to do something exploded in his chest and he began reading frantically. There had to be someone who could help him in there. For all he knew someone already was.
“Dolores Umbridge Undersecretary of the Ministry, you are under arrest for the illegal and explicit actions of leaking sensitive and private information to terrorists. Your contact in this transaction has already been transferred along with several faction members into custody.” The finality in his words clear and Dolores fought uselessly as the task force took her and the Death Eaters in hand with their fellow Aurors.
“Are these everything you own?” He asked nodding his head in encouragement.
“I’ve always been a good runner!” Harry called back triumphantly.
It wasn’t a victory he noted, despite them being clearly alive and calling for transport of the injured Aurors and caught assailants. Someone hadn’t been anywhere on the grounds for him to find, and oddly not even a trace to follow. Narcissa Malfoy was still out there, with his soul and gods know what else. He could only hope that the power vacuum Bellatrix left had not been filled so soon, and by a woman he never thought capable of the same evils as her sister.
“Aurors, set perimeter around the group.” Tom barked out his orders as the robed figures moved into position. “Albus, on your word.” He said formally with shoulders squared.
Hagrid apparently had a penchant for bringing home orphaned wild animals and the puppy he had smuggled onto the grounds was the size of a human being already. Of course, it was, why wouldn’t it be huge and happy to see you like all of Hagrid’s animals. Apparently the deep green cutey would grow to the size of a bull easily and its little barks would become strong enough to incite instant terror and death.
Narcissa had been in an uproar after watching her son pop out of existence right in front of her. She’d called every house elf and been informed of which one was unaccounted for, but no matter how many times she called for him he never appeared. Despite that, the possible pain of disobeying her direct order of summons was enough to keep her grounded. She had no way of knowing if he’d simply switched to Draco’s ownership or had an order he was using to work around. His contract with them like the others was airtight so she didn’t even consider it had broken down at some point.
How is everyone doing? Share your thoughts in the comments and let me know.
It was an unusual case to say the least. The little men in their tailored high point hats, half burrowed in the chewed-up mounds of grass. Harry watched at first as the poor, if not exceedingly grumpy things were pushed from the Weasley’s land. They seemed to spit and growl indiscernible profanities from between gnarled fangs.
“Why not? Might as well burn everything down and make a show of it.” Draco smirked.
Apparently, there was an end to these hallways and upon Gellert not finding him there he had been making passes through the rooms and doubled back with a passion. He heard the slamming from down the hall and the harsh stomping of boots. He was running and he knew it was only a matter of time till the wizard looked inside his old room and knew without a doubt what was missing. The fierce roar from behind him proved that and he kept running. The wisp was barely keeping in front as it tried to point the way in time for them to make it back to the entrance hall.
“I want you.” Draco allowed himself to answer in kind.
The shadow of the Auror cast itself over them then, it felt off instantly, the torchlight should have been between them, but it was behind the man too. They whipped around in time to see his face, Roody didn’t look right, his face lax and clouded. The torch threw itself to the ground with a slender hand slipping into nothingness.
“This has been a lot more complicated for you than I’ve let myself think about.” Harry sat, assessing Draco. “We just won’t let him go through with it then, right?”
“I’m sensing a theme. Get the others down first.” Harry helped direct everyone to quickly untangle the others who seemed rather bad off by this point. Harry took the flashlight back while they worked, taking in the sight of Pomona Sprout, Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore all crucified up along the overwhelmingly strong and overgrown Corpse plant. It was ten times the size of the one Mrs. Sprout kept.
The world snapped into place as a hand touched his shoulder, suddenly he was in bed, but the wrong one? Suddenly the Draco above him was the right one. Suddenly he could move and the air wasn’t so hard to breath and his insides didn’t burn.
He heard a few small laughs and words of encouragement as he made his way past the long dining tables. Who made them so long? He was taking forever to get all the way to the teacher and even though it was a few seconds he felt like he’d been guilty of a leisurely stroll through the gardens. He threw himself down into the seat hastily and the blood rushing to his ears almost drowned out the woman’s voice.
“Mandrake is toxic, Albus, you know that. It’ll kill you; you have to try and focus for me while you can still move.”
“He started the fight, I showed up to him already having my insane aunt on her last legs. I threw a few spells, but they never connected. He used it as a chance to clock her though, so at least I wasn’t a complete deadweight. Rita Skeeter doesn’t know anything. She’s all talk. What happened was far more impressive than what she wrote, I saw a muggle beat the shit out of a serial killer.” Draco gave Hermione a meaningful look.
First, the fight. Draco cast a leg locking jinx and a petrify on two faceless shrouds that had been deadlocked with some officials and took the opening it offered. He could hear shouts from behind him, warnings to stop, curses, the erupting exclamations at Sirius and Lupin’s arrival. He was tumbling over the top steps and pushed the door open to a new flurry of information.
“Not yet.” One of them called back.
“I’m still trying to process the fact that they left on their own. Go easy on me here.” He huffed in defeat. It was a relief to see his new friend looking so at peace now that the morning was passing, he would just have to take that as his win for the day.
“I promise with all my heart, I will be true to those qualities no matter what trials we face.” He nodded; it was still sometimes rare to receive the kind of respect Lucius was doling out right now. The man had a hard past and had never expressed love well to anyone but Draco’s mother, and in this case, Draco knew it would be hard not to betray that love before he could make good on it.
Did it look bad that the Blacks had seemingly gone into hiding after getting the child? Yes. Would they have done it without him on the same boat anyways? Absolutely.
By the time he was in a room he’d exhausted himself with his fruitless struggling. Hands delicately pressed against his forehead and before he could react two orbs of what he would eventual realize were eyes stared down into his, transfixing him as he felt like his body and soul were being washed away in separate directions. The sensation the same as earlier, but more intense. Now they knew were to probe to start straightening his thoughts into order and he was awakened in a familiar place.
The bandaged and worn looking house elf looked up with crystal blue globes for eyes. He spoke poorly even for his race and the new cuts and red marks marring his hands and arms was disheartening. He’d never had the will to ask just how he got them and he still couldn’t. Dobby for his part had always said it was his fault.
“We would not have stood idle Gellert. Love. Why can you not let them commit their own acts, why did you have to join them? The words I’ve hear from the others are troubling and they grow in volume ever since the man you found was appointed. They say the muggles inferior. Words I would not have thought to question in our time but know—”
That might have been the very reason she had made contact with him if she was the one that did it; which the more Harry examined the past feelings he’d been getting from the invisible force and the wind that saved him the more he began to realize the connection. This brought with it a new series of thoughts, Harry would be seeing Zanna again, when he did, he would be able to ask about his dreams. The dreams the others had told him they couldn’t help him with. The ones he now almost hoped were from her, if they weren’t who else was there in the shadows pulling at his head and heart? And honestly that was more of a scary idea than being simply tricked once by a fae.
Harry stepped in and the door swung shut behind him, he jumped from the sound and took a few steady breaths before going further in. This was it.
Sirius was growling at their side in warning, but Roody wasn’t listening, a look of pain passed over him before he started to scream wildly and flailed towards them. From there things went by fast. Harry had backed up and tripped on the empty space behind him before falling straight down. Draco had turned to grab him but had been too late before something hit him hard, stunning him on the ground. A snarl and sounds of a struggle indicated that Sirius had been locked in a fight with Rodolphus. Draco could just barely make out the indents in the ground where his mother’s shoes bit into the dirt towards the entrance to the last chamber.
The Weasley’s had been the first to show him comfort and warmth maybe even more so than Draco, the bed they gave him was still a heart wrenching memory, the sweater smelled like it, whatever soap they used and the sweet wet scent of wheat and cornstalks from their farmland was soaked into the very fibers. A note in the box said the Gnomes were fed for him and that they were all doing great.
“Can’t wait for more.” Harry moaned past a spike of dull pain that played to the rhythm of his heart on his flesh before a new hand came down to spread a cold substance over it. He yelped in surprise despite the instant relief.

“Why are bodies so weird?” He groaned, slumping over the table next to him.
“You should answer when your better asks you a question.” He added when he got no response.
It looked like they were slowly fitting together more and more these days. Sometimes it still felt foreign, but on a good day, and this had been a good day, they got like this. People that had known Draco all his life seemed to be having heart attacks and life altering realizations at the sight of them whispering playfully together. Harry had some idea of the stupid social class system, from Draco to Sirius being pureblood to the Goblins kindly indulging his questions as he cleaned their stations.
Harry stood from the chair and whispered the answer to McGonagall. She announced for him like she had all the other students.
“And how is Kreacher?” Harry asks with a raised brow. Sirius looks away and puffs his cheeks out just a bit before replying.
It was a disorganized mess; they all began picking weak arguments over nothing to fill the air instead of dealing with the real issues. Harry contented himself to listen as the people in front of him fit themselves back together. For now, this was good enough. He got a few looks and questions and they announced he’d be sitting at Slytherin table for dinner since Draco hadn’t yet since arriving.
