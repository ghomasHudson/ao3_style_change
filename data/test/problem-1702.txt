Draco was already there, cutting Harry midsentence while pulling him to their table and apologizing to Professor Slughorn.
“What?” Draco just realized he must have been daydreaming in potions or else he would have known what was Potter talking about.
Harry reached towards a rug in the wall, and tickled an elf in it. The elf let out a hushed laugh and let them in to one of the most beautiful rooms he had ever been into.
The younger boy opened his eyes and there was a moment before Harry saw recognition in the silver pools his irises were.
First went the first years. Then the second years and so on. When Professor McGonagall got to the sixth years Draco was already feeling more than queasy. When she called Hannah Abbot to the front and paired her with Parvati Patil, he was more than ready to throw up right there and then. The only thing that anchored him to the ground was Harry’s hand, which he hadn’t taken back after he touched him the second time, when they called the third years.
Draco was sitting in one of the infirmary beds, not really sure about anything except that Harry had brought him there, and now he was talking to an increasingly concerned Madame Pomfrey, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying, he felt as if someone had submerged his head into a fishbowl.
“Thanks for waiting for me, Malfoy” Harry said loud enough for anyone in a three-metres-radius range to hear.
Draco used the slow voice that adults use to explain something to a toddler. “I won’t go into the Great Hall if I can avoid it, even if it means skipping some dinners.”
As he tried to decide fast enough to avoid looking like an idiot, Draco’s mask slowly started to crumble, the worry making him look younger, like a hare hunted by foxes. When he thought he was going to break and felt his eyes swelling up with tears, Draco heard the doors open behind him and noted a hand clutching his shoulder (
The moans escaping his lips couldn’t be less Malfoy, but he couldn’t care less either. He just wanted Harry,
Draco spent his free hour taking a long warm bath. He didn’t have to worry about classes or homework since he was a little bit ahead than his class. He enjoyed having time to himself, especially after such an eventful morning.
“Yeah…” When Draco turned he discovered Harry looking at him with something darkening those clear eyes. He started a little but then he just sighed and broke the eye contact, instead advancing toward the bedroom.
“Actually, I slept very well too, I didn’t dream at all.” Draco turned to see Harry watching him sceptically amused.
And now he was sitting in a corner of his bed, dumbfounded, his little problem fading quickly at the thought of having to have
“And why is that, Mister Malfoy?” Draco was so sick of the game they all played he was going to drop this, at least he had tried.
Harry was so deep in thought that he didn’t even notice that the class was over until Ron tapped his shoulder. “Are you alright, mate? You have that look on your face that says you’re thinking real hard.”
Usually, however, Draco would stick to reality and accept that he would be stuck with someone who probably feared or despised him for the rest of the year. If he made it to the graduation. Anyway, Draco wished that he got paired with a Hufflepuff, that way it would be easy to get by.
Harry was staring at him with those green lights he had for fucking eyes and Draco realized he was waiting for an answer. He nodded, unable to look away from the pools of liquid emerald that were Harry’s eyes.
“Geez, Hermione, I told you, I’m fine.” Harry cut her exasperated, turning his attention to his Potions book in an obvious attempt to end the conversation and make them go away (
While making their way to the Great Hall Draco wondered how it was possible for Harry to act as if nothing had happened, like they were just two normal teenagers meeting for the first time. At least, that was what he thought until they reached the doors of the Hall, because then his knees went wobbly and he couldn’t breathe and all he could thought of were ways of escaping what was to come, the enter to the Hall full of students, all whispering, talking about the latest news of the Boy Who Lived and how he was now stuck with the Death Eater.
When his eyes adjusted, he found himself wanting to crawl back into the wardrobe and shut the doors.
“It’s ok, I’m sorry, ok? I shouldn’t have asked I’m sorry I’m sorry…” Harry’s voice was velvet and Draco was sobbing in his arms as he whispered apologies and they just sat there for a few minutes until Draco was better and Harry was just there but Draco didn’t told him to get away because he was enjoying the closeness so much and well, if he was going to hell at least he could enjoy the way to the abyss.
(also i don't know it anyone cares about like, my life but! i'm now on my second year of college!! and im so much not depressed, sometimes if im optimistic i might say im happy?? :)))) i wanted to share, since this has been like, my life work lol)
“Good morning class!” Slughorn greeted the student as cheery as always, a habit that unnerved Draco to the point of tensing his body at the moment he heard the salute. “Today we’ll have an interesting task to accomplish; please, dear lass, distribute this among your peers, thank you darling.” Slughorn spoke as the sheets of parchment circulated between the tables. Draco and Harry’s table, being the farther from the front, was the last to get the assignment. Draco scrutinized the recipe, mentally making a list of the ingredients they were going to need for the potion as he also noticed it was a very dangerous poison, though nothing hard to prepare.
“It’s gorgeous, isn’t it?” Draco said softly as he admired the room and the lace curtains moving with the autumn breeze.
When they reached the tapestry that hid the entrance to their room Harry tickled the elf while explaining to Draco how to know which one to tickle. After that, they entered and Draco was surprised again to see the beauty of their common room. Under the evening sun it seemed like a completely different chamber and Draco started to figure it out, awed by the skill of the designers as they had been able to capture a season with no more than the natural illumination of the various times of the day and a little magic, making winter the night and the blue shades the moonlight casted, spring with the way the morning sun lightened the colours of the draperies, summer with the noon sun and its almost unbearable intensity and lastly, as he was currently watching, autumn with the soft evening sun and the way its orange glow made the painted trees look like they were shedding leaves.
) senses when he felt Harry’s mouth at his neck. He bit back a moan and dug his fingers into Harry’s hair.
They worked on making their room comfortable for both of them as much as a pair as individually. They did not talk excessively, they chatted unconsciously about nothing rather than talk about their previous topic. Draco was actually really chatty once he relaxed, getting to the point of surprising Harry with bursts of laughter that he found incredibly beautiful and bright, like the sound of a tambourine in the hands of a skilled player or the way the children laugh while playing in the morning sun. Harry, on the other side, was more the silent type, finding both entertaining and relaxing the way Draco could go on and on talking about the things he loved, like flying in his broom or just, in his words, “being around someone I care about”. Draco noticed how, even though his features were normally inscrutable, Harry’s mouth would twitch and his eyes would sparkle when he found something Draco had said especially amusing.
“Ah, Mister Malfoy, I see you have finally decided to join us.” Professor Slughorn tone was angry as Draco hurried to their table. “Good morning, Mister Potter.”
Draco thought as he snug into Harry’s chest, humming low when he felt Harry’s arm hug his shoulders.
“Ohhhhh, Potter, you have girly hair.” Draco exclaimed as he buried both his hands in Harry’s hair from the back.
Draco put on some jeans and was trying to decide whether to wear a t-shirt or a shirt when Harry appeared at the door, all damp hair and residual mist from his shower which, Draco noticed, hadn’t been a cold one. He finally took the plain black shirt and started to button it up, watching Harry’s back muscles swiftly moving under the skin as he stretched to unhang his clothes from the closet racks.
Malfoy sat up and buried his face in his hands, now fully awake and embarrassed. “Ohhh my God. Ohhhhh my fucking God. Fuck. Fuck.
In any case, he needed to drop his books in their room but when he turned to go he almost tripped on Draco’s books. The man had left them before hurrying away. Harry took them too, planning to leave them in Draco’s bed as he did so.
“You’re right, Maggie… Maybe he’s not fully awake yet” With that, the subordinate slapped Draco across the face hard enough to make him turn his head. “Hey snakey, are you awake?”
“Why? I’m sure there are more important things that occupy you and I don’t really mind, actually. I mean, of course I don’t like it but at least it’s not so bad as at the beginning and the worse just happens to the upper graders and we can deal with it, we can. I just told you because you asked. You shouldn’t worry.” Draco finished his speech softly, with a hidden plead in his voice as he looked up at Harry’s eyes.
“Harry, I have Charms too! Why don’t we go together? Hermione has it also and we can take a shortcut through the yard.”
When he opened the door, he was met with an empty room, as Harry was still in class. He took his time getting ready and picking up his supplies for next class, which reminded him, he had Potions, with Harry.
Draco found the honey and stashed them in one of his pockets. Then, just for fun, he walked right through the crowd and watched as they hurried away from his path.
Draco sat beside Harry, flinching a little at Ron’s menacing air, which Harry seemed to purposefully ignore as he started eating (
Draco had been on and off consciousness, the short periods when he was awake. During those moments, Harry made sure to bring a glass of water to the sick boy’s lips. When he looked like he was finally asleep and not just out of it, Harry relaxed just the tiniest bit. His heart ached to see Draco in pain and, although a part of him was urging him to go look for the ones that had done this to him, Harry also knew that his place right now was here, beside him.
. As the lump started looking more and more human, Draco felt the pain of a new amount of guilt adding to his burden. When it finally resembled Potter (a battered, pathetic echo of Potter), it turned his gaze at him.
“Sorry, I’m hungry.” Draco had his mouth almost too stuffed to talk, but he managed to gulp and started to eat more calmly.
When people seated at last and Professor McGonagall announced how the thing was going to be, it seemed to be the Sorting Ceremony all over again. As he watched his fellow Slytherins sent with people, Draco started to hold his breath unconsciously. Only when Potter touched his shoulder he let out a shaky breath, wondering why had Harry just did that. As it seemed, the only ones happy with this new forced mixed life were the Hufflepuffs, as always cheering to everyone who got claimed.
Harry was pacing in the hallway, where Draco had left him. Why hadn’t he chased him? No, that wouldn’t have been wise. He knew he had royally fucked up. Why did he have to go and ruin it? It had been all going well, but no, let Harry Potter and his hero complex (now I’m sounding like Mione) go and do something stupid. But he was going to give up. Harry couldn’t let him. He knew how important was Potions for Draco. But did he really have to pull his influence like that? That had been reckless and stupid. No one would have liked it. Hermione would have hit him if she had been there. Now, what was he going to do? What would Hermione do now? Maybe he should just wait for Draco to calm down and then apologize. Yes, that was what he was going to do. In the meantime, he could as well go and take a stroll. Or maybe he should go to Mione? Why was he so fucking stupid?
in my defense, during summer my internet is shitty as fuck and although i already had this since like a month ago, i never found an opportunity to post it.
“You have to move it for ten minutes without letting it boil any other way and it’ll be ruined. Now, you do it.” Draco handed the spoon to Harry, who took it and started carelessly moving the poison.
“He didn’t mean it, Professor, you know, he’s just grumpy because he didn’t manage to sleep at all yesterday and now he’s cranky but please don’t mind him.”
“So,” Draco started to say as he tore away from the bathroom’s doorframe, suddenly very aware of his almost complete lack of clothes. “We should get ready.”
Draco strode helplessly in the direction the voice came from, finding a little boy crouched beside a girl holding something, her back towards Draco.
At this point Draco didn’t care at all about his master’s skills in Legillimens, he only wanted to stop hurting (everyone else and himself). If he had cared to look at the Dark Lord, he would have seen curiosity in his gaze.
) and he was asleep in his arms. Harry watched him breathe deeply, his face relaxed as he had not seen it before, his hair almost white in the sunshine, encompassing his face like a halo. Harry traced with his eyes the other boy’s lashes as they started to flutter.
He could practically hear Mione telling him that sometimes people only wanted an apology, so he set for the last option.
Draco had stood up without noticing and, after finishing his inner debate and taking note of his surroundings, decided that the best course of action at the moment was going back to his (their) room and taking a bath. A hot, long bath where he could think better. And if fucking Potter was in the room, well, he could perfectly go fuck himself somewhere else.
“You were going to get into trouble.” Draco rested his head in his hands, letting out a sigh of fatigue. “You know, Potter, you can’t just go around telling people when they are being unfair. Especially not teachers.”
As Draco said it, he could see Harry’s disappointed look, as if he really had wanted to go with him.
“All right, Mister Potter. I’m going to let it go this time but if your partner wants a grade then he better make sure his name stays in its place.”
He stood in the same place he had been that very morning, though now it seemed like years ago. Remembering that nice breakfast by the lake and the smile Harry had given him then, Draco braced himself and opened the doors of the Great Hall.
Draco stomped through the hallways in the long way to Charms, as he knew Potter would be using the shortcut. It also gave him time to think how the hell was he going to make it through the rest of the year with Harry for roommate, Potions partner and pseudo friend, not to forget all the hate the rest of his classmates would be directing to him for that closeness to the fucking hero of the Wizarding World and being the Death Eater and being Draco Malfoy and in summary, for being the fucking prat he was, or at least he had been.
So Harry made his way under the covers and hugged Draco, cradled his head as he thought of all the different ways in which he was too deep into this. After a while, Harry could hear the peaceful breathing Draco made now he was asleep, and he wondered if ever existed a better sedative than seeing this beautiful silver haired boy sleep.
“Humm?” Harry was brushing his teeth and came to check his hair (which, if Draco was asked, was as messy as always and Harry had no way of solving it) in the drawer mirror.
“Well, give me that, it’s time to put it in.” Draco snatched the bowl from Harry’s hands and emptied it into the steaming cauldron.
“Potter.” Draco forced himself to look at his eyes instead of staring at the tent in Harry’s pants. “You really should take a cold shower.”
“Why, thank you Professor. I’m sure this won’t happen again.” His voice reeked disdain as he walked calmly out of the room, as someone who knows has won. Draco followed closely as he didn’t want to stay alone with Slughorn.
“Mister Potter!” Madame Pomfrey swatted at Harry’s head, full of indignation. “Didn’t I tell you to leave yesterday?”
By the middle of the class, Longbottom had had been carried to the infirmary as his potion had suddenly seemed to break into boil and one of the bubbles splashed Neville as it exploded. Draco, seeing this, had double checked the fire beneath the cauldron, not wanting to hurt himself or worse Harry, considering the possibility that if Harry got injured while being his partner, everyone would think he made it on purpose.
“Why won’t you take care of that, Harry?” Harry blushed even more violently, if it was possible, and turned his head away.
After that hideous duel between Potter and He Who Shall Not Be Named, after the teachers had counted the dead and the wounded, the students that had survived were told to sleep in the Great Hall with promises that they would have rooms soon. A week had passed and they had gone to regular classes, if there was still such a thing. They didn’t have got dorms yet and the former Slytherins were being harassed day and night, accused of evilness, got beaten, scared to death with death threats murmured to their ears at night, received in howlers at the morning (how did the owls act as if nothing had happened?), their properties destroyed. The first and second years were the most susceptible to these shenanigans, sometimes even breaking into tears at the breakfast when they received an anonymous letter fearing, not without reason, that this time it would be them the mocked, the abused, the tortured one.
Draco got up and ready, whining all the way to the Hall that it didn’t matter if he got breakfast today because he had a free hour. Privately, though, he was glad he had an excuse to spend some more time with Harry, since they didn’t have the first class together.
“Even I have to eat, Potter.” Draco saw, once again, how the sparkles in Harry’s eyes died as he noticed Draco’s stern tone.
Draco barely noticed that he had passed the Hall gates until he was seated and talking to Granger about the Whistling Piper that their class was growing in Herbology.
“I don’t want to,” whinnied Harry, startling Draco. “You can see me sleep the rest of your life if you want to because I want to sleep the rest of mine.”
“Are you going to come here or are you willing to spend tonight on your own with the nightmares?” Draco was still facing the other way, but Harry could hear the pout in his voice.
“Well, let’s eat.” Draco spoke, breaking the spell that their eyes had created between them as he casted an incantation in the food to heat it again as it had become cold with the wind.
“Are you now, Harry? Are you taking me to bed?” Draco’s eyes were still closed but he was lifting his eyebrows in a way that suggested an evil glint if his eyes were open. They were in the bedroom now, and Harry walked with Malfoy to the space between the beds.
“Certainly, I have found him.” Even though he knew that was going to be the answer, Draco’s heart plummeted to the abyss. “And now I want you to practice your Crucio and Imperio on him since I have noted you seem to be a little weary on their use.” With a slash of his wand the Dark Lord commanded the whimpering mess from the corner of the room to between him and Draco. He could barely recognize the lightning scar in what seemed to be a forehead.
Draco, excited beyond belief by those hands, which had traveled and touched every corner of his body, got off the sofa and presented his mouth.
Draco was stunned: Tulip was not a girl at all, even if he seemed, given the long hair, the sweet face and the very prosperous breast on his tight bust.
He was taken to a large room with a long row of windows, opening onto a large outdoor garden, where he could see numerous tables already set for refreshments.
Draco was hallucinated, aching and mortified beyond all limits. He was a beast, an object, and his humiliation was only at the beginning. While he was there, naked and kneeling on the cold floor, it was all too easy to imagine a man ordering him to go down into the crotch of his pants and demand from him ... the healer Smith had sat with his legs spread, probably to suggest exactly the image that his brain was putting him off.
“It's starting to hurt, right? Well, that's what happens to undisciplined bitches. " The man said, rubbing the tip of one of his nipples, and blocking Draco's scream, who began to moan and crave again.
The wand went down again, and Draco felt the blood rushing to his cheeks as he crawled over his soft member.
He did not know the man who was in the room, even though at that point he knew he was his new master.
Healer Smith thanked Tulip for his words and brought Draco back to his room, where he made him sit on the bed.
"Well Draco, I would say that you know more or less everything you might need. As you have heard from Tulip, you have not been properly educated for an Omega but you should learn quickly, because your new owner may be demanding, and nobody wants a rude Omega, so be compliant. You just have to do what I told you. You will do it?"
Once a day the master came to him and masturbated him, with that big and delicious finger, making him cum every time with his ass, then he went away and, after a while, Draco was sick again.
The next person who approached was a woman. Draco knew her by sight and the woman smiled at him slyly.
"Well. I see that you react normally. This will probably be done to you several times, if only to make sure of your reactions. Buyers like to hear that an Omega can moan properly, so don't hold back. You could be masturbated too, during the presentation, "added the healer, passing his hand between his legs and grabbing the member, which was now hard.
Draco crawled at his master's feet, sure he had to please that man in every way, if he wanted to get what he wanted so much.
It hadn't been said in the commanding voice of the Alphas, which Draco had learned to recognize by now, yet he got on his hands and knees just the same, moving his pelvis and groaning, as he felt something wet wet the groove between his buttocks.
"Now I'll ask you again, bitch, do you want me to drill that tight and eager hole of yours for you to find yourself?"
The night seemed infinite, while all his hesitations and his conscious thoughts were washed away by a need, so intense, that nothing else mattered.
“Normally an Omega becomes fertile at an early age, and the family sells it immediately. Reaching fertile age is sanctioned by the first heat period. A period of a week or so, at each change of season, in which the Omega feels the prevailing biological desire to conceive. "
Draco had been under Imperius in the past, but he realized this was worse. At least the Imperius gave a kind of happy feeling to those who carried out the orders, instead he, while his feet brought him back, did not feel happy but only horribly forced. He grabbed the member, pointed him towards the toilet and pissed, letting escape even a slight sigh of relief, but in all this his sense of horror was only increased, and the pang in his stomach became stronger, much who, after freeing himself, doubled over in pain.
He heard footsteps and the presence of his nearest new owner, then lights came on flooding the room.
He was still horribly fascinated by her breasts when the healer came up with something shiny in his fingers.
It was as if it were blinding, when he suddenly felt the knot of pleasure in the center of his belly loosen, while he was certain that the muscle ring of his ass was melting, letting a jet of humor pass through that shot out, making him scream from his throat. , against the cock he still had in his mouth, in the throes of an orgasm like never before.
Embarrassing, of course, but obvious since it was a careful medical checkup, and probably the fabric could have interfered with certain types of spells.
"And here's your new Omega, sir!" the healer said, and the man replied in a strong, low and coarse voice:
Although he couldn't help but blush a little, Draco undressed and neatly placed all his clothes on the chair, beside the white bed.
"Well, this is the position you have to take if you're asked to present your mouth. It is a request that could be made to you during the presentation, because the Alpha are often much more gifted than a normal male, so they will want to make sure that it is possible for them to have oral sex with you, if they wish. It is a fairly common practice, especially in the last period of pregnancy, since sex could harm the unborn child. "
In those two hours immobilized he had had time to accept the thing, and the knot of pain in his stomach had gradually increased, until he realized, really for the first time, that he was not even considered human. At that point that bad feeling of anxiety had become a painful twinge that had never gone away. He would have been exposed to this position, within two days, in front of strangers who would have bought it.The idea kept the blood flowing to his cheeks, and his embarrassment got worse when he realized that, perhaps, they would not be unknown at all: the healer had said that the Alpha descended from thoroughbred families, and Draco knew practically everyone ...
By then he was so stunned that he no longer felt embarrassed, not even when the healer massaged his breasts or ass. He simply remained inert as a doll, resigned.
Of all that had been done to him, that sapphire, on the tip of his penis, seemed to him the worst. The obvious sign that it was an object that could be adorned at will, just a habit, an amusement, an animal.
The idea of a big cock, so close, made him moan more, and he was sure that, if he could, he would come at that moment, instead the man let him continue masturbating in vain.
“The collar. In blue leather with resistant rings and that can disillusion it without taking it off, in case you don't want it to be seen. Coordinated cuffs and anklets, and for the anklets I want the ones that don't allow them to run. If he's really that wild, I certainly don't want him to go away! " the man said letting go of a laugh, before observing him again with a very critical air as the healer asked in a professional voice:
“The first of these laws states that an Omega has no legal rights. You are practically a Malfoy family possession, which can dispose of you as you see fit, which is why you are here. "
The pierced ears were nothing compared to the rest, only a vague burning that seemed to be muffled by the other pains, stronger and more annoying.
“Well, your parents thought they could pretend nothing happened, believing that their money and influence would never put them in the position of having to use you as a bargaining chip. Now this is no longer the case; now you have become indispensable for their future alliances. "
Healer Smith ordered him to get up and on all fours, with the bench under his belly, so that he didn't really have to sit still on his knees for a long time but that the bench would support his weight. Then he ordered him to spread his knees wide and to stay there, following the orders of whoever spoke to him.
“Let's move on to the presentation, as it will only be in a couple of days. The presentation takes place before the heat, so that anyone who wants to buy you can already be your new owner as soon as you are ready to conceive. " As he said it, the healer put his hand under Draco's chin, looking him in the eye. “Your father put special binding clauses on your sale. You see, usually, since the Alpha are in greater numbers, it is quite normal for an Omega to be sold only for a certain number of pregnancies, usually two or three at most, only to then return to its original family and be sold again , as long as it remains fertile. This removes owners from embarrassment of having to disburse an Omega's livelihood once its usefulness is exhausted, and gives the family of origin the opportunity to earn a lot more. "
He said approaching and turning Draco's soft, aching body to reach his ass, and carelessly thrust the wedge into it, before looking at it for a moment.
His ass continued to lift upwards, as much as the ties allowed him, wanting to be opened and filled by a member that wasn't there.
“But your father also put an unusual clause, namely that two of your future children are entrusted to him, to occupy the position of heirs of the Malfoy. Asked for your second born, and another, chosen by your new owner. This is really unusual, I don't think such a thing has happened since 1800. Usually no son of an Omega remains in the family of origin, nor is he considered his heir, but I guess it's the only way for your father to have an heir, without having to repudiate your mother and find a new younger wife. After the two heirs are handed over, your sales contract provides that your new owner can sell you at will, without further consultation with your family. "
“You are such a lucky bitch! I bet your parents are celebrating big now, with the blow they landed! That man is truly a powerful ally, and he hasn't raised a single criticism of your father's condition! "
When the door to which his face was facing opened, and he saw the healer come in, he again felt like crying.
The healer moved his wand, much to Draco's relief, but soon after felt his body rise under the pressure of a new spell, which turned him face down and repositioned his limbs.
Draco nodded, his head down, hoping only to be left alone. When he was finally alone, he lay down on the bed, and tried to find comfort in his sleep, but found that it would not be so easy. His mind was full of horrible scenes of what his future might have been but the last thing he wanted was to read the books that had been left for him.
"Open your buttocks wide, bitch." A harsh voice said behind him and Draco, still under Imperius, did so without even realizing who had given him the order.
Healer Smith had come to him that morning as soon as he arrived and asked him to undress completely.
Breakfast continued like this, bite after bite, and then, once finished, the man made a heavy leash appear and attached it to his collar.
Draco let out a dismayed verse and suddenly decided he wouldn't do anything so embarrassing under the man's eyes. He started to leave the bathroom and the healer shook his head: “No, so we're not there. Pee. Now."
The healer followed and was washed in a huge tub full of aromatic foam, dried in soft towels and then sprinkled with oils and massaged from top to foot.
Outside the air was warm, even if the sun was not yet high, and the grass in the meadows was soft and well cared for.
He did not see the man, who was behind him, and he could at least imagine that he was attractive, even though he knew he was not.
Draco knew that his body wanted him but could not bring himself to answer, even though the man had been clear before. He should have responded quickly if he didn't want to be beaten.
Then he sat on the bed, made Draco lie back on his lap and pulled the wedge off his ass, before masturbating him again, sticking his big finger inside him, like yesterday.
"Please, master ...." He whispered as he tried to lift his ass and present it in the correct way, forced shortly after by the ties to fall back on the mattress instead.
In spite of everything, the pangs in his abdomen did not subside and, in the end, he returned to the bedroom with his eyes downcast, whispering just as he held his arms tight around his stomach.
He screamed and cried all night, trying everything that could help him, either by wildly masturbating his erect and hard member, or by rubbing the part of the wedge that came out of his ass on the posts of the four-poster bed, trying to move it faster and to stick it more inside.
"Oh sure! What a fool! You don't have to worry about anything! Your ass will get ready, getting wet abundantly, and remaining so for all the heat, but even after, every time you are excited, you will continue to get wet enough to allow a good lubrication, even if in a much lesser way than during the heat period. " Then healer Smith looked at him better and sat down on the chair. “The other thing about riding, and which is best you know, is that the relationship will be a little different than you think is normal. During the heat, while an Alpha mounts an Omega, his penis does not just ejaculate, but swells at the base, like that of a dog, in fact, locking you together for a certain period, let's say about half an hour, during the which the Alpha will produce a great deal of sperm to make sure you get pregnant, and your body will squeeze it out, welcoming it all. Oh, don't make that face. You will love it. " Said the healer before the staring, embarrassed terror look on Draco's face.
Healer Smith had told him, but only now did he really believe it. He wanted to be fucked. He wanted to feel something big press against him and violate it.
“I heard your dad accepts triple pregnancies, that could be fun. Plus, you're on permanent sale, so I could also let friends have fun with you. I bet my Theo wouldn't mind taking a ride in your ass too. "
“You're greedy, aren't you? A real bitch in heat. " His master said, pushing his finger inside him, which was much thicker than Draco's thin one.
The next door was opened and Draco, to his relief, saw only one girl sitting at the Spartan desk in the little room, similar to hers. She was not naked, in fact she wore a blue shirt and turned around looking at them but without saying anything. Healer Smith made introductions.
"This is a little wedge, as big as my finger, and it will be all the satisfaction you get from this warmth." The man said by forcefully pushing the object into his wet hole.
He had become a female creature, with large, high, soft breasts that lifted with his breath and lips that seemed to be made to inspire sinful thoughts.
Unfortunately, Draco was certain that his father had not requested equal guarantees, since the healer Smith had specified that Draco's would be a permanent sale, and that he would never return to his family.
Draco felt like he was dying. The man told him he wouldn't take it, and he needed it so ... he moved to the carpet by the desk anyway, which was soft and colorful, and lifted his ass back to the man, his face crushed to ground and his arms still locked behind his back, hoping at least for a finger ... he would have begged for that alone ...
What he certainly didn't expect was the grin he saw on the man's face, who pointed his wand at his throat.
"Yes sir. That has to come out of your mouth when I allow you to speak. Do you understand now, bitch? "
Draco continued to be unsure of what was going on, but from the explanation it became clear that his chances of a dynastic marriage, which could produce an heir, were very, very limited.
He did not even notice that the healer Smith had left and then returned shortly after, and that he was now pointing his wand at him.
Draco grabbed the potion and drank it all in one gulp, fervently hoping it was as the healer said and that the heat would make him see everything in a different and better light.
With the story of his mother's family, it had seemed logical to Draco to take this precaution, and he had not opposed it in any way.
Draco closed his eyes, partly because of the sudden brightness, partly because he preferred not to see its owner.
Draco groaned and knew that yes, that was exactly what he wanted. His mouth felt full of saliva, and he would have been ready to drool, to have exactly that.
“Oh, don't worry, because in the mid-1600s it turned out that this minority was not really sterile, it could simply generate only with some particular individuals. Always among those who took the fertility potions, in fact, suitable individuals can be born, with a probability of one in every five hundred. Rather low, don't you think? "
The platform he was standing on began to turn slowly, and he saw several people approaching him to observe him with interest, chatting amiably among themselves and sipping champagne from the crystal glasses they had collected at the refreshment tables.
Draco felt that finger move inside him and then began to persistently touch a specific point. Immediately his penis began to stiffen, and a groan escaped his lips that was not exactly protest.
“No, you are too old and I'm not the type to take a bitch for life. I certainly don't want to keep an old wreck, since I can always have young bitches! I'll go see Parkinson now. " Mr. Nott said to the woman beside him, letting go of Draco's head.
But it was late now, and despite his wakefulness, he needed to sleep. If he was to continue his routine of trying to live his best muggle life, he would need to be awake enough.
But there was something missing here. He had pulled out most of what he had here, piled them on the floor next to him, and there was no sign of underwear. Draco could probably live without any, but it felt like an odd thing for his mum to leave out when she was packing. There was another place that the rest of his things could be, and he knew he had to check there.
It was clear that it had been several weeks since the grass had been cut – it was taller than the regulation grass at the manor had ever been, and it was raggedy in places. There were dandelions and buttercups growing all about the place, and all in all it looked very untidy.
For all the hopes he had had that he was going to enjoy himself here, he had been wrong. He tried his best to enjoy it, he really did, but… it just didn’t interest him. There needed to be at least three other balls, and more brooms in order for him to feel it was worth his time.
Another inconvenience, damnit. Draco growled to himself as he stood up and went on another hunt around the kitchen. His own house, and he didn’t know where anything was. what sort of life was that?
The pictures on the box (which, being brightly coloured, Draco could only assume was aimed at children) showed the cereal in a bowl with milk.
For what was probably half an hour, Draco sat on his new sofa and contemplated his life. At least three times during that time he went for his wand. Clearly his mind still hadnt figured out that there was no chance of him using any magic for a long while unless he wanted to get locked up for real this time.
Putting the letter down on the living room table, where he was sure to remember it, Draco got on with his day.
If he did that, though, he would be admitting that he was willing to be in the muggle world when he didn’t technically have to be. That would be giving up, and he didn’t want to have to do that unless he had no other option.
When reading slowly – intentionally so – he only read through a chapter or so before deciding to go ahead and make a start on dinner.
There was a mirror in one of the other bedrooms that was full length. Draco admired himself in it – the suit looked as good as the day he had bought it, and there wasn’t a speck of dust on it. He looked good.
“It’s great to see you again!” Draco looked up to see the woman he had talked to earlier in the week, who had invited him to this party to begin with.
Draco stood in the middle of the kitchen, trying to think if he had ever seen anyone cook sausages. It must be possible to do with what he had. There had been that whole cupboard full of… cooking things, after all.
It had only been an hour or so ago that Draco had been out there, sure that he wouldn’t want to get dirty and do any gardening.
He went round, and watered each of the plants in turn. It was too sunny outside for him to think that he could get away with just waiting for it to rain – the summers down here in the south were harsh, that much he knew from being at home.
The strange man was still there in the other garden when Draco stood up. It was much harder for Draco to see what was going on now, and he had to admit, he wasn’t all that interested. These muggles were uninteresting enough that he didn’t care to know any more about them. And there seemed to be nothing exceptional about these ones.
Draco began to tune out the conversation, realising that the interesting part had passed. Humming and nodding in the right places, Draco’s eyes wandered around the room as he wondered how much longer he should stay here.
Sure, during their school years he and pansy had spent a lot of time together. They had put on the act of being the perfect Slytherin couple, after all, and the whole school had thought them wonderful, to be envied. But in all the time they had spent together, Draco couldn’t recall them having many meaningful conversations. From time to time they might discuss what the dark lord was planning, or how much they all hated the Gryffindors, but it never went deeper than that. Pansy would always claim that their stories were too gory, and they should change the topic to whatever gossip she had for them this week. (Draco thought that he probably had a mental catalogue of every couple who had gotten together and broken up in the entire time they were at school. All of the information had been learned very unwillingly.)
The woman on the other side smiled at him too. “Why don’t you come in?” She said, gesturing at the house behind her.
Of course, he would have to go out there on Saturday. It was slightly daunting to think about, and he wanted to think about it as little as possible.
Carefully, he walked back up to his room. It felt sort of good to get some of his normal, good quality things in the house, like he was making his mark on the place. The muggle house couldn’t be made entirely good, of course, but it could be improved on by the kinds of touches that Draco could make to it.
Slowly, he pulled them out of the fridge. Richmond sausages. They were slightly cold, a part of the charm inside the cold box, he thought.
Stepping further into the grass, he looked around, just in case there were any tools left outside, or anything.
of them! I’m going to come and make sure you do!” A shrill female voice seemed to shout after the first person. It was sort of reminiscent of some of Draco’s less savoury family members, and he shuddered.
“I’ll see you in three months for your check up,” Dumbledore said, taking one step back. “Don’t forget to keep out of trouble.”
Holding the trowel firmly in his hand, Draco walked back into the garden. His hat was shading him from the sun, there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, and he had a potted plant ready to be planted. How hard could this be?
And… if he didn’t know this had been written by a muggle, then maybe he would have though it charming.
Draco could give up all of his luxuries. He could. But this? He picked at a loose thread on the mattress. It was very clearly not a new mattress. It was barely usable.
And then Draco’s gaze wandered up from the grass. There was a tall-ish brown fence enclosing the space – it was much smaller than the kinds of gardens that Draco was used to. Still, he stepped out into it happily enough. It seemed that nature was one of those rare things that was the same no matter if you were a muggle or a wizard.
He opened it. Inside was a wall of metal, just a whole bunch of pots and pans stacked on top of each other in a mass that looked ripe to fall out and on him. Quickly, he shut it again. Qith each failure he was getting more and more hungry, and it only made him want to get that food more.
Reaching out, he gingerly picked up the folder. It was heavier than he had expected, and he had to lift it with both hands in order to actually get the damn thing onto his lap.
“Would you rather be with the men, sweetheart?” Draco didn’t know this woman, but she sounded very kind.
Draco blinked. How long had it been since he had slept in that long? Every night here he had woken up at eight at least, his body clock still used to being forced to wake up that early.
Draco forced a smile. “Thank you,” he said quietly. It wouldn’t do to accidentally make any of them think that he was happy to be here. If he did that, they might invite him to more of these things.
If Draco had had any owl treats, he would have refused to give the owl any. As it was, he didn’t have any, so the owl would have to go without either way. He took the letter, and closed the window in the owl’s face. That would teach it.
He spent the rest of the afternoon looking over the books he had brought with him. There were only a few that he truly treasured, and the rest were just ones that he had thought he might enjoy, pilfered from the library at home before the ministry turned up to confiscate everything his parents had ever owned.
It didn’t take him long to notice that everyone in the kitchen was also a woman. This was the aspect which began to make him feel a little out of place – was he the only man invited? He wasn’t opposed to spending time with women, but the glasses of wine in their hands, and the clearly conspiratorial way they were grouped together, making it clear that they had been talking about something else before they walked in. Draco estimated there must be at least ten of them.
But he couldn’t stay around looking at himself in the mirror all night. He picked up his keys, and set off for the house that he only sort of was sure he knew the location of.
He then spent a while trying to access his magic again. This time it felt like he was maybe actually getting there. He couldn’t be sure, but he thought at one point that there was a spark, some sort of movement there that felt a lot like magic.
Quickly, Draco closed the door before she could turn back and say anything more to him. There was nothing he wanted less than to be harassed by middle aged muggles in his time here.
He had used the actual bed in his actual bedroom the past few days. It wasn’t the most comfortable, nor was it the cleanest. But at least when he used it, he didn’t wake up feeling as in pain as he had done when he slept on the sofa.
From inside, voices sounded. Draco shuffled his feet on the ground, trying not to scuff the shine of his shoes. He didn’t have access to polishing charms, and he didn’t know where to get them polished. If he messed them up now, he wouldn’t have the chance to make them good again for who knows how long.
But he wasn’t supposed to be getting any letters at all. They had been very clear about it – he wasn’t allowed to have an owl at all, because the muggles would find it strange to see owls about so often. Which was ridiculous, as far as Draco was concerned. How else were you supposed to send your mail? No doubt the muggles had a far inferior system – they probably still used the pony express. Hah!
Absently, he pulled out his watch to look at the time. The stars pointed to it being about half nine – a full hour before he could justify saying that he needed to go to bed.
If nothing else, Draco did want to find out what the muggles possibly put inside it. He opened the door, and immediately was hit with a blast of cold air, as well as a light which the box emitted as soon as he opened it. Draco’s jaw dropped – what magic had this box been infused with that it could do this? Be cold all the time?
Draco resisted the urge to point out that the problem was that it was happening at all. The cheerful ‘no. 2’ stared at him like it was mocking him in its muggleness, like it was going out of its way to point out that Draco didn’t belong here. “I know,” he said instead.
all evening other than look at all the dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen and wonder how he was meant to clean them all wasn’t frightening at all), he was ready for bed.
“Oh – it’s just for pretend,” Draco laughed nervously. He stuffed it back in his pocket. “I just like to look at it sometimes.”
He had hoped that being able to sleep would make his mind up on the subject, would help him see what the best course of action was. Unfortunately, this does not seem to have worked. Now he had no more idea what he should do with it. Pansy had never been close to him. Did he even want to tell her all about what it was like to live in this hellhole?
Thankfully, there were several other women around who seemed just as desperate to get to know him as Carol had been.
Walking into the kitchen again with trepidation, Draco pulled open one of the other cupboards that he hadn’t had the time to properly explore the night before. Instead of there being cooking utensils, there were boxes and cans and packets of all kinds of foods. (Maybe if he had discovered this cupboard last night he wouldn’t have been reduced to eating the sausages. It was a thought that he didn’t want to poke too deeply into.)
Figuring that blending into the shadows might be the best cause of action right now, Draco slunk to the side of the room. Nobody else seemed to notice him, and Draco felt weird about the fact that his newly-learned skills in sneaking around were coming into use.
Deciding that he’d wallow over that particular injustice later, he headed back downstairs. This time, as he walked through to the living room, he noticed something that he hadn’t on the way there. A big… folder? Sat on the coffee table in the middle of the room. There were no labels on it, nothing to tell Draco what it was there for.
Technically he could always go out there now. Make it less scary. It was bright – the sunlight was directly illuminating the houses on the other side of the street, and the road itself – and it was quiet too, very few cars (which, Draco still didn’t quite understand those things – he’d seen them around before, but they still made no sense. How did they operate without magic?), and Draco couldn’t ask for much more out of a day.
Then he went back down and repeated the process, bringing the second trunk up and placing it next to the other one.
Eventually Draco found them in another cupboard he hadn’t looked in before. He went about making the cereal quickly – he didn’t want to think too hard about the fact that he was apparently going to be eating something that the muggles liked.
Picking up one in a small enough pot that he could carry it through the house, Draco moved – very carefully – out and to the garden, doing his best to avoid spilling soil in the house, and more importantly, trying to not drop the thing.
Draco stumbled into his home. It was dark, and quiet, and a little cold. The heat of the day earlier had gone, and now it was replaced by the chill of the night.
Scowling, he stepped back, and only left one hand under the water to feel the temperature. He was even colder than he was before, and if he had to have a cold shower right now… well, he would deal with it, but it would only be more of a sign of how low he had fallen that he didn’t even have any warm water.
The part of him that despised muggles warred with the part of him which had been brought up to never turn down any invitation. Should he be unpolite, or should he shun the advances of the muggles?
Their son seemed neutral, compared to his parents. He looked around the room with no expression, and Draco found himself hoping. If he was no longer the only young person in the room, maybe this could be an opportunity to make a friend?
Draco stalled. He couldn’t mention Hogwarts. He couldn’t. Muggles didn’t’ know about Hogwarts – Draco might not know much about muggles, but he had known that much since he was a toddler.
He picked up the one that was closest to him. a trowel, still with mud on. He considered it carefully. This would do for what he wanted to do, right?
He began to read the box, hoping that this mystery would be cleared up. Sure enough, it stated specifically that it was designed to be eaten with milk. (There was also a whole lot of numbers and information that Draco couldn’t make any sense of. Why did muggles do maths while they ate? That seemed awfully strange of them.)
Still – this was a workable template. He might not have the best of tools, but it was clear that some care had gone into making the grass fairly tidy, and… maintaining the fence? Were those things that muggles cared about?
what's up my dudes! apologies for taking so long with this chapter - hopefully there won't be such a long gap between this and the next chapter. enjoy!
Sighing, he went upstairs. There were blankets there, at least. And if there were blankets, he could huddle under them until he became warm again, and could get to sleep.
“What’s your name?” The woman still seemed awfully cheery for someone who couldn’t read that Draco wanted to be left alone. He shuffled his feet, wishing that the awkwardness of this would leave him alone and he could just get back to wallowing. “Mine’s Alison.”
For a moment, he thought he was back in his home. Back where he belonged, wrapped up in thousand count thread sheets, on a mattress made two hundred years ago and filled with ostrich feathers. He had received mail in this room thousands of times, and it was second nature for him to sit up, and –
Sometimes when the ball went in the goal the men would cheer, and sometimes the men would groan. It felt a lot like being in the stands at the quidditch matches, and it made Draco feel nostalgic for playing. He wasn’t all that bothered about the aspect of watching the game, but playing? Now that was the thing that really felt special. There was no doubt about that.
It didn’t take him long to get ready. Getting ready for fancy parties was sort of Draco’s forte – you could argue it had been what he was brought up to do.
It wasn’t the biggest win, but it was definitely something. And that had to be good enough for Draco.
Should he savour these books? Leave them until he was so thirsty for knowledge that he would go batty if he didn’t read about magic? Or should he read them now, while he still had the brain power to do so? No doubt staying so long in a muggle neighbourhood would be enough to remove his brain from his body entirely, and make him nothing more than a sad husk. No doubt that was what the ministry expected him to do.
And of course they were as rich as they had always been, perhaps even more than before because after the funeral, and the trials, the Lestrange's fortune had passed to them.
Part of Draco's mind was telling him that it was wrong, degrading and that, above all, it wasn't what he wanted, because he wanted the man ... oh, he wanted him so badly ... but he put his mouth in and his master stuck his cock in his throat.
He had noticed that the room was beautiful and luxurious, and that his bed was large, suitable for whatever sexual activity his master forced him to do. There were books, games, precious ornaments.
His screams must have called his master, who sat down on the bed next to him, while Draco was back, arched, screaming.
Then the woman, with a flick of her wand, brought two tiny hooks to the rings on the tips of her nipples, and attached a tiny gold chain to it, filled with delightful sapphire pendants that sparkled with every breath she took.
Going back downstairs and bringing one book with him, Draco settled into the sofa he had slept on last night. It was slightly too comfortable, but he also didn’t fancy sitting at the dining room table to read. Draco needed some decadence in his life, and if a second hand sofa was going to be it then he would settle for it. The book needed reading.
“I know,” Alison said, sounding a little like she hadn’t actually heard what Draco said. “Isn’t it awful? This is the first gathering they’ve come to this year. We only invite them because it would be rude not to.”
“At the weekend, there’s a party being held at Carol’s house. I’m sure she would love it if you came!” Alison looked so enthusiastic at the idea of inviting Draco to this.
Chewing on the chocolate, Draco began to wonder what he had ever been worried about to begin with. He couldn’t eat like this every night, but for now it would do. For now it would fill his belly.
The only reason he knew it was a folder was because of mudbloods like Granger, bringing their muggle devices into Hogwarts like they were equal to wizarding devices. It didn’t even look good – bright red, like it would entice Draco into reading it.
Frenzied, and desperate to get clean, Draco pressed every button – and was then showered in freezing water. Gasping, he twisted the temperature dial until it was facing full red. Would that do the trick?
But now there was sunshine coming through – more than it felt was fair, considering how miserable Draco was – and Draco wanted to see what he was going to be working with in the garden.
Instead of going back to his book, he went back upstairs. There was bound to be something else he could do. There was bound to be more in the trunks to entertain him aside from the books.
He would need to find something in here to eat. he picked up various packages, and put them back down, rummaging as he never would at home for something to eat. It was odd, he thought – he never really had much choice in what he ate. At home he simply ate what the house elves brought him – not hard to do, since his parents had brought him up eating proper food, and there was nothing to dislike about it. And then at Hogwarts it was mostly much of the same, with a small amount more of variation. Sure, there would be a variety of dishes served at dinner, but he would still be limited to what was served that night. And there was nothing worse than telling your guest that their food wasn’t good enough, and that it should be made up differently. Draco had better manners than that.
He spent a few minutes like that, just trying to think if there were any ways he could cook this sausage that didn’t require relying on muggle contraptions to do it.
When he peeked in to where he thought the living room would be, he found that he was right about this, that the room was full of more people. Maybe it wasn’t going to be the most interesting thing in the world, but it would be better than watching ‘footie’.
“I have had one… but I’ll take another,” Draco smirked, picking one up. (He didn’t want to admit it, but they really were very good. He hadn’t thought that muggles were capable of making such good food.)
Draco had to hold the sighs in. Memories of his childhood flooded his mind – back when he looked up to his father, and dreamed of doing nothing more than following in his footsteps. Running the estate, collecting rent, managing the farmers of their farmlands, and making his own contacts in the ministry. His father had seemed so cool back then.
The only thing that happened was a light turned on at the bottom of the metal that covered all of this. Draco had no idea what the source of the light was.
Having relieved himself, Draco turned to his other priorities. He hadn’t showered in several days – he hadn’t been allowed to shower much while at the ministry, and the last time had been two days before he came here.
But at least this was a parting thing – he didn’t have to worry about interacting with her any more than this. Her hand felt… well, normal, but Draco knew that didn’t mean anything. She was still a muggle, and if Draco had his wand he would have been cursing her with all his might.
“Hi there!” An older woman stood in front of him, holding a clear container of some kind. (More plastic? Why were muggles like this?) “I saw that you moved in recently, and I just wanted to welcome you to the neighbourhood!”
And he knew the only thing he could do here was to open them up, and get his clothes out as best as he could.
“Yes, I’m here alone,” Draco said, only willing to give up this much. It wouldn’t do to be telling lies right now about it – they’d see soon enough that he was the only one living here. He took the container, listening to it rattle a little. He couldn’t quite tell what was inside through the plastic, but hopefully it would actually be edible. “Thank you.”
Now that Draco wasn’t up for talking about the unusual objects that he had, Alison seemed to lose some interest. With a pat on the shoulder, she moved away to talk to her other friends, and that was okay with Draco.
Draco made his sandwich, as full of ham as he would make it if he was at home, and he enjoyed eating it greatly.
Well, Draco certainly hadn’t been told about any magic being used in the house, but he wasn’t going to complain about anything like this. There was no way muggles could possibly know about how to keep things cold for a long time, not without cooling charms and a lot of magic. He’d have to keep this hidden from any muggles.
Swallowing hard, he stood up and walked through to the kitchen. He hadn’t thought to check the levels of food in there earlier – was there even any food in it? Draco found himself suddenly terrified that he might need to brave a muggle supermarket tonight.
If only he knew how to use the stars to tell the future. Then maybe he could have read them now, and know what was in store for him. or – was it the stars that told
He could not afford to dwell on it, though. There were more pressing issues, which made it nearly impossible to ignore.
Opening up his door, he didn’t even bother to turn the light on. It was dark, and it may as well stay that way.
There were still – Draco counted them – five cupboards to look through, plus a big white rectangle, which Draco couldn’t help but feel looked like it was one small push away from falling over on top of him. It certainly didn’t look like something that one would store their food inside.
Then he noticed the letter on his floor. So it hadn’t been a dream, then. Pansy really had written to him, and she really had wanted for him to reply to her and… do something.
It occurred to him as he ran down the stairs that he hadn’t ever planned on talking to any of his neighbours. None of the muggles could possibly be interesting enough or worthy to talk to. There was no way.
Awkwardly, Draco walked round and perched on the edge of one of the unoccupied chairs on the edge of the room.
Opening it, he stared at the first page. Not only was the type of parchment muggles used incredibly white and flimsy, but it also smelled weird. It was the first thing Draco noticed, that it was so different to the parchment that he was used to using.
Picking up the letter, he threw it under his bed. He would deal with it later. Pansy would be lucky if she got a response at all, and if she did it would only have the bare bones of the details. Exposing your weaknesses was Slytherin no-no number one, and if this was a trick then he wasn’t going to fall for it.
He had his breakfast, and spent the morning in contemplation about his magic. If he could find a way to channel some of his natural magic into a form that he could control, then he would have a chance of escaping this place, and getting back to where he belonged.
Before Draco had time to preen – he hadn’t expected such a lordly welcome, and he was beginning to feel more and more at home as time went on – the other woman (Pamela, she had told him with a strange glint in her eye) added, “we don’t get new people moving in very often at all. The last man who lived in your house… well, he was very weird, to say the least.”
When it began to feel like too much, when the words were dancing off the page, he stood up from the sofa he had been sat on, and he stretched his legs out. How was he so cramped from only a few hours sitting? He had practically been trained in it since birth.
Maybe that could wait for now. Draco walked down the short corridor. At the end of it was what he supposed was meant to be a kitchen, small and without any house elves.
(To the best of his knowledge he wouldn’t need to worry about getting a muggle job – he hadn’t really understood most of the conversation, but when the ministry sent him here it very much sounded like they were going to pay for everything for him, because of work laws? Draco wasn’t sure what laws there could be that would stop him from being able to work, but maybe it was for the best. Draco probably wouldn’t be very good at any muggle jobs, anyway.)
But it had been, and its muggleness tainted every aspect of it, from the lack of owl post to the strange and flimsy stuff it was written on.
But maybe his mum had packed things and they’d been removed. Why they would have been when the books weren’t Draco didn’t know, but it was a possibility.
It was a good job that this ‘den’ was dark, because Draco could feel his cheeks heating up. This was the first time that he had really messed up with making the muggles believe that he was one of them, because it sounded very much like the questions the man had asked him were completely normal for… whatever context a muggle would have had.
Unfortunately for him, Draco couldn’t imagine anything worse than inviting his teacher into his prison for the next few years. There was absolutely no reason to do it, and Draco wasn’t going to give in. He held very few cards in this game anymore, but he was damned if he was going to give up the very few that he did hold.
Draco touched the corner of one of the squares. Packets. It rustled and crinkled at him, and Draco tried to not be disgusted by the whole thing. How did muggles look at this stuff and think, yum, time for food?
Healer Smith didn't even speak to him, he simply threw an Imperius at him and ordered him to have breakfast first, and then follow him.
"Adorable!" another unknown voice said, while Draco felt it pinch and the finger was extracted from his ass.
“Buyers are allowed to test the elasticity of your anus with one finger. This obviously because you are a virgin and have never been in heat. If this were not the case, they could even put a hand inside you, if they wanted to. "
Draco stood motionless as he realized that his partner's father, a man he had known for as long as he could remember, was watching him as he was bound and open.
He was more and more on fire, more and more needy and eager, but the man did nothing but ignore him.
Not the searing pain of the Black Mark, when it was placed on his arm, and which was now covered by the high leather bracelet, not the agonizing torment of a Cruciatus, no, the real, incessant pain.
“The Malfoys have been pretty foolish trying to raise you like a normal boy and this will make our work together more difficult now. You are an Omega, Draco, the one who in vulgar but very common jargon is called a bitch. "
Draco was sure he had never felt anything like this, really never, and if he could have spoken, he would have screamed in the face, to that imbecile, that clearly there had been a misunderstanding.
Draco was relieved that the man who had driven Feba crazy had just decided not to buy it ... but there were still so many people, and now he realized that he didn't really know what to expect from any of them.
Draco blocked his hand and looked at that thick, stubby finger, and felt his cock snap forward in happy anticipation as he moaned and nodded his head.
Every time the man stopped, perhaps to observe something, Draco immediately offered him his ass, exposing himself eagerly as he felt his hole begin to drip humors, which ran down his thighs while, under him, her new breasts bounced. with every movement and her hair trailed on the ground.
“My first Alpha was Giffard Abbott, I have been with him since my first presentation when I was eleven years old. I was an early Omega and I gave Gillard three heirs. The presentation went very well, but I imagine that the fact that my parents wanted to make him enter into a contract with guarantees on my health helped. Gillard was an excellent Alpha, and now I hope to find one just as good, but mom and dad said there will be no problems because ... "the boy seemed undecided for a moment then continued" ... uh, well, I'm the youngest , in this presentation, of course, then I was educated in the correct way ... "at those words he lowered his eyes, as if he didn't want to offend Draco" ... and obviously I'm very fertile! "
He had to look for him, he told himself, he hadn't forbidden him to do it, and Draco needed it so ...
Draco did so, unable to disobey, and soon felt his master's stubby hands caress his skin, his back, and smear something fresh on him.
"Maybe I did not say it clear enough. Omega, during the heat, are fertile for those individuals who can conceive only with them, and who are normally called Alpha. We are not talking about gender. It doesn't matter that you've always considered yourself a boy. As soon as you go into heat, you will crawl at the feet of any Alpha, pleading to be impregnated. You will instinctively recognize the Alpha by their smell, as they will recognize you, and even that case will not matter that they are men or women. "
Maybe that man had had a family ... maybe he had lost someone in the fighting and now he was blaming him, seeking revenge on the Death Eater who was now in his power. Draco had a strong suspicion that things could get worse and that he was going to be tortured, because only that could justify the healer's fierce expression.
“Don't resist. You are a bitch and, as soon as you go into heat, moaning will be the only thing you can do, so much that you get used to it. "
When he was brought into the adjoining room by a lady who was obviously there to style his hair, Draco for the first time saw himself reflected in a mirror and let out a scream.
At one point, first Feba and then Tulip were escorted away, and finally it was his turn to leave, following the healer Smith and crossing the room, naked, for everyone to look at me again.
“Obviously, even if the testicles are useless and your penis is tiny, there may be people interested in examining you carefully anyway, and you will be required to hold your position and remain silent, unless you are asked direct questions. "
It wasn't too big but it was long, and he felt it against the front of his throat, causing him to gag.
Draco sat on the bed, feeling the relief of being able to change his position and, above all, of closing his mouth, then drank avidly but the food, at that moment, did not particularly attract him. He could have spoken if he wanted to, but his mind was in turmoil and he didn't want to receive any more information, so he had nothing to ask. Even so, healer Smith spoke to him equally.
“Now I have to insert the sapphire into your slot. It will hurt for a while, maybe a couple of days, while you get used to the intrusion, but as soon as you're done here I'll send you into heat, and that will make you forget you even have it, you'll see. "
“It will take a while for them to take full effect. It will take a couple of days. " The healer announced, looking at him strangely.
The sight of that man, who had seemed repulsive just the day before, now made him moan as his ass leaked, and he was anxious to be closer to him, to rub against him, to feel his hands, finally see his cock which, he was sure, would be big and thick.
He was a large man, not only massive but also fat, with a prominent belly and cheeks mottled with ugly red spots over huge walrus mustache; he had an incipient receding hairline and seemed vaguely sweaty.
Draco felt the cold rise up his legs and his abdomen still ached, as well as his lips, stretched and open. His mouth felt painfully dry, but despite those inconveniences, his mind was elsewhere. It was all too horrible to bear. It was a beast. A piece of meat. His father had decided to sell it to secure an alliance and offspring. A lineage that Draco would have given birth to. The idea repelled him in a sickening way: someone, a man or maybe a woman? An Alpha would have bought and mounted and impregnated him ... and if what Healer Smith said was true, that would have been his condition for most of his life, even unable to rebel. Forced and without any alternative.
Even after her breasts stopped growing Draco felt it ache as he tried to get used to those extraneous lumps that seemed to move and sway with him.
An ugly old elf served breakfast, and the Alpha began to eat with gusto while Draco, not knowing what to do, again presented his ass, hopefully, to the Alpha.
Draco was not even sure where his room was from, but since his mind was, in a certain way, more present, he felt his cheeks cook with embarrassment, and he panicked.
"You will become the best trained bitch in the Wizarding world, you will see!" the man said with a sadistic grin, then continued:
At that point the healer made him lie on his stomach and began a careful series of spells, which made Draco's skin tingle in the strangest places, but he thinned his lips and said nothing.
After lunch Draco lay down on the bed, determined to try to satisfy himself again, but when the elf reappeared, to take away the dishes, he snapped his fingers and Draco found himself with his arms locked behind his back.
It would disappear if he needed the services, and then it would reappear, just like the gem on the tip of his cock, but taking it off, to replace it with his fingers, was out of the question.
Draco was in that shameful position again and the healer was standing by the bed. He ran a hand over his back, gently.
Draco was suddenly madly grateful that the healer Smith always remained so professional and that, in the rare moments he indulged in emotions, at least they were meant to try to comfort him, in some way.
Draco stared at him without understanding, although a bad feeling went up his spine, making him regret the previous moment when he believed he would be tortured.
The healer began to write on a notebook, nodding, then the man approached Draco again, still motionless, while the idea of being the property of that man was turning his stomach.
"Very well. So, tell me, bitch, do you want me to smash that tight, wet hole of yours that you find yourself, and fill you up nicely with cum, until you're pretty pregnant? "
The healer Smith stopped before operating the spells and massaged his chest with a strange yellowish paste.
"And to top it off your penis is much smaller in size than a normal adult male, and your scrotum produces a clear, substanceless ejaculation, totally useless for procreation."
Draco hated looking at himself in the mirror looking like that. It was clear that he was only adorned to highlight his status as an Omega, as a slave, as ... Merlin was a bitch ... he was what everyone thought of him now ... he was just a bitch.
Draco again felt his body move against his will, but at least he consoled himself knowing that he had not humbled himself.
It was night outside but the air of the first days of summer was warm and he did not feel cold at all at that moment, quite the opposite.
The man, however, continued to move his finger with skill, beating his prostate and making him moan and arch more and more. He felt his balls heavy, and his cock aching painfully, and it was agonizing not being able to get more. He prayed mentally:
Tulip and Feba were made to enter and seated on the other two platforms and, immediately, the woman's groans began to spread into the room.
The man approached, breathing on his face in an unpleasant way, before taking a step away and observing him, so carefully that Draco felt more violated than if he had been touched.
"You have to learn to cum in your ass, bitch, because that's how you come for the rest of your life!"
"Hey! I know you!" she said smiling and standing up to offer his hand, heedless of Draco's nakedness "My sister has told me about you, sometimes, in her letters! You went to school, "he said wrinkling his nose in a similar way to what Pansy would have done" it must be fantastic to learn magic! "
Then after a moment of reflection he nodded to himself: “However, it is better if I now let you assimilate this first information. You will stay like this for a couple of hours, just to get used to it. "
Draco was struggling to follow. Why was he naked and immobilized while this madman taught him this kind of delusional lesson?
Then the healer got up and put a hand in front of Draco's face, pressed on the pillow. "Suck my finger." He said sticking his forefinger towards Draco's mouth, which he found himself forced to perform.
“Aside from the fact that I am a healer, and therefore you should not be embarrassed, you should get used to being looked at quickly even in moments that you may consider embarrassing. I remind you again that you are not a human being, and that no one is embarrassed to see a dog piss, as the dog does not embarrass himself. "
The man let him do it, merely observing him, even though Draco's increasingly sensitive nose told him that the Alpha was excited, and his eyes clearly saw the big bulge at the crotch of his pants.
Draco felt many strong smells entered his nostrils, giving him a strange feeling he couldn't define. Some were good, others disgusting, but all screamed and scratched against his senses.
"Oh, it's not illegal! Using an unforgivable on an animal is not and you, I remind you, are a property, not a real person. "
Was it possible that his new master wanted to prevent him from coming as a man, as he had said? And for how long? Did he really mean forever?
“As you can see, the last owner of Feba preferred to keep her always in heat. Obviously for years he has no longer needed to take potions for this, now his body remains constantly in need. " The healer quietly explained while Draco wondered if Theo knew the truth ... if for all his life, his companion had seen that being without reason wandering the rooms of his manor ... at that moment the woman realized that she was not alone and immediately he got on all fours, presenting his ass and moaning even louder, even if the words were incomprehensible.
"Now shut up and listen." He began the healer. “It would be really easier if you did it spontaneously. Unruly Omega are usually heavily recaptured by their owners, and I am sure you should learn rather quickly to obey, always and in any case, whatever you are asked for, if you want to save yourself a lot of pain. "
"The boss doesn't want you to do it alone." The elf said, scolding him before disappearing in a 'pop'.
"I see." He said getting up "If that's the case, then it's clear that I'll have to discipline you a little."
The ties suddenly unfastened, and the only thing Draco's body did was lift his ass, while his hands were already reaching back, and he grabbed her wet buttocks and spread them apart, oblivious to the fact that his muscles forced motionless for the night, they tensed painfully.
"Really tight." He heard Nott say, and then the finger was withdrawn and a moment later the man had passed in front of him and, after grabbing his hair, lifting his face to be looked at, he said with a sadistic grin:
“This will be the first part of the presentation. It will last about a couple of hours. There are twenty-two Alpha, registered for tomorrow, and I imagine that each of them will check you in detail, also because you are the only new Omega, since the other two have already been sold previously. You will then be taken to a private room while the negotiations take place. Once the necessary arrangements have been made, your future owner will enter the room with a healer, who in your case will be me. Many Alpha prefer that their Omega be prepared in a certain way, and your new owner will give me the necessary directions. I will execute the requests and then you will be transferred to your new home. "
Draco hastened to automatically say a 'yes' which seemed to displease his new master, who slapped him again.
Healer Smith must have put him asleep before moving him, and what he felt must have been the heat, evidently.
“That's all, as far as positions are concerned. Obviously, interested parties will be able to touch and touch every part of your body, as they please. " Said the healer still stroking his back, letting his hand go lower and lower, until Draco felt his fingers slowly run the furrow between his buttocks, before going down again and grabbing his balls in a rather firm grip, which tore a protest that was however only thought: Don't touch me! Bastard! But he had been told to keep quiet, so only a muffled moan came from his lips.
“You see, you are here, as Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy have certainly explained to you, for medical checks in view of a marriage contract. What your caring parents have forgotten to tell you is that these agreements may be different from what you expect. "
"Well. You came looking for me, so you'll stay here. I'm going to like to work and occasionally look up and see your eager ass, bitch. "
She moved to find a more comfortable position and heard some comments behind her, although she didn't know who they came from:
Once there his mind, a little more present, made him arrive in the bathroom, where he tried to clean up, washing himself with cold water, since despite everything he still felt on fire and knew he wanted more: he still wanted to be fucked ... filled up…
It was true. If before his desire had been so much, now that the man was near his brain had stopped thinking rationally again, and he just wanted to be caught.
The small wedge was welded in place and the Alpha had explained to him that he would not have the opportunity to remove it.
"Go on. After all, we don't have much time, and you don't know anything that an Omega much younger than you would always know! "
“Well, Feba still looks like a nice woman, but it took a lot of effort to make her like that, because her last owner used it a lot and in imaginative ways. But, as you can see, it is still salable, and I imagine it will still be fertile for a few years. Well, let's go visit the next one. Follow me."
Draco felt the salivation increase, around the cock fixed to his lips, and swallowed hard, wondering why, despite his burning desire, it had not occurred to him, until then, to try to satisfy himself in that way.
He did not have time to withdraw when he noticed that, with a stroke of his wand, the man had fixed it to his face with thin corrections.
"In addition, Omega are often sold under a binding contract, which prohibits double and triple pregnancies, because your body is able to sustain up to three pregnancies at the same time, even if this is not without risk, neither for you nor for the unborn . Add us that double pregnancies greatly shorten an Omega's life expectancy. I'm sorry to inform you that your father, however, has also allowed triple pregnancies for you, and that your sale will be final. You will never go back to your family. I guess this is a way for Malfoys to reiterate that they are still so wealthy that they don't need to sell you once. "
He remained motionless, his mouth wide open, and the man leaned something towards him, with his stubby and fat fingers, and slipped it down his throat.
If this somehow consoled him, on the other hand it restricted even more the people to whom it could be sold, and he knew that the families approved by his father, in all probability, would not be composed of people with a kind heart.
“I guess you can understand that this, over time, has led to numerous clashes and battles, because no family wanted to lose the chance to continue their bloodline. This is why very strict laws have been imposed on this. "
It was awful. Draco had not thought for a moment about the aesthetic appearance that its owner would have, but now that he had seen that man he was frozen. It was all too bad to be true but he thought that, if at least the man looked passable, he would be able to bear it ... but so, the idea of being raped by that monster with the loose skin, the soft belly , the bull neck and the drooping and greasy mustache ...
His anus was again penetrated by a finger, until his cock began to harden, then his balls were tested and weighed.
“But you, last night, you stupid bitch, turned me down, and now you're going to go through the heat without my dick. Oh, I don't want to be unreasonable, I'll give you some little consolation every now and then. " The man said with a nasty grin, then added:
“Yes, I will put you under Imperius. It's the best thing. But you really should meditate on it well, because tomorrow night you will be owned by an Alpha and it will be better for you to be good, obedient and compliant, if you don't want your life to become a hell of pain! "
He was tempted to flee in the face of that perverse image of himself, but the healer Smith was quick to order:
“This instead is just a constriction, in fact, but don't worry, Omegas can have orgasms with their ass too, so you won't be dissatisfied. At first it may seem just a little strange. "
Draco felt as if something was taking his breath away, then he realized that his voice had been blocked, like the rest of his body.
"I'd like to take a closer look at the bitch Malfoy." Mr. Nott's familiar voice said in a sustained tone to a man beside him, before adding "Well, who would have thought that Lucius was hiding such a nice bitch?"
Draco felt the tears come out again suddenly. His parents had sent him there to never see him again. That awareness overtook all the others for a moment. He had always believed that they loved him ...
"I do not know. Maybe someone could take him for a brothel. I've heard that the new potions to keep bitches in heat all year round work wonders! " said yet another.
The man stuck a second bite into his mouth, something with a sweet sauce, perhaps a jam, and after Draco had swallowed he asked, without ordering it in his Alpha tone:
Draco was terrified. Could it happen? Could someone buy him to turn him into a whore? Then, with icy clarity, he replied that it was impossible. Healer Smith had told him that whoever took it would have to guarantee two heirs to the Malfoys before he could hand it over to others, and Draco figured that his father would never agree to sell it, not knowing exactly what his blood would be. heirs.
"Well. Now we can move on to the most important part of your visit. " The healer said always with the same grin and Draco's heart, frightened by the situation, began to beat faster.
Making sure to avoid saying yes, Draco made a vague affirmative noise. That would be good enough for now, right?
Picking up one of the blankets on the bed, he was gratified that it was one that was his. That would make it superior to all of the muggle ones that had been provided with this terrible house. He wrapped himself up in it, and stood by the window for a minute, just looking at the stars.
His lunch was as bland and boring as the breakfast had been, only sandwiches. For this one, though, he stood at the window and watched his garden. the plants he had put in there were looking good, even without any charms to encourage growth. Herbology had never been Draco’s strongest subject, but after years of being subjected to professor sprout’s awful lectures and even worse fashion sense, he thought he had retained at least a little of the information.
And the owl gave him a disdainful look, as though it was judging him for his incompetence. Well, Mr owl, Draco thought, at least I have opposable thumbs.
Once it was clear that the muggle who had posted it was gone from the property, Draco went over to see what it could possibly be. It was one, single folded piece of paper, and since there was no name written on it Draco could only assume that it had been hand-delivered by the person who had sent it.
Holding onto the trowel, Draco headed back through the house, this time to the front door, for something he had noticed when he moved in the other day. There were several plants in pots in the front. Draco had no idea who had put them there, but they were his now, and he thought they would do better in the ground in the back garden.
His embarrassment reached a never-before-seen peak when the first group of people peered at his ass with interest, and his face turned even redder as he realized he knew some of them: ministry dignitaries they had frequented. her home, men her father had done business with and ...
