One of the men on the ground began to twitch.
“Oh, yeah. Sorry. I had my phone off the rest of the day. I kind of needed some time before I started talking to everyone who would no doubt want to talk to me. I considered calling you, but…I thought you were probably with Ari.”
“How about Dean and Seamus?” the original question-asker asks.
“Oh, fuck that!” Potter said, some of the fight coming back into his eyes. “If he loved you, he would’ve grown a pair and introduced you to them and told them to piss off if they had a problem with it.”
His mother was waiting for him in the blue room, seated at a small table that was already set for tea. “You look a fright, my dear,” she said as he slogged in and kissed her perfumed cheek. “Is Ernie not coming today? I had Fifi prepare those silly cucumber and watercress sandwiches he likes.”
She considered him, like she still thought he might be having a go at her. “They do, they love each other a lot. I know it’s hard to picture my Mum as anything but a mum, but she was quite pretty as a girl.”
“Come for me. I want to feel you come.”
Harry’s heart was pounding so hard and he was afraid to look at Draco.
He got up and went into the kitchen and poured a healthy amount of bourbon into a glass and chugged it down.
Harry grinned. “I like being your neighbor, too.”
, necessarily -- I think we might’ve skipped that part last time. But I would like it if we could do that,” said Harry.
Harry was so mad he could hardly keep himself from punching Seamus in the face. It wouldn’t be the first time. When they weren’t having ill-advised, meaningless sex, Seamus and Harry sometimes fought – seriously fought – when they were pissed. Harry had a short temper when he drank, and Seamus had a big mouth (and a short temper as well).
They landed gracefully and Mrs. Weasley pulled her son into a hug. Bill stepped away from it quickly, though, his eyes dark. “Mad-Eye’s dead,” he announced without fanfare.
“What sort of things?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes. “Because, look, I’ll just tell you.” He leaned closer, trying not to be a child about it, trying to act like it was no big deal. “I passed by you in the alleyway behind the club, fooling around with some bloke. And you were…being strange.”
Potter looked at him with very wide eyes. In all likelihood, such words had never before been uttered by a Malfoy, and certainly not by Draco Malfoy. Potter leaned down and hugged him. “There, was that so hard?” he asked.
Sarah rolled her eyes. “Good lord, Harry. You and your drama.”
Harry goes to Malfoy Manor to talk to Malfoy
“I’ll be honest: I already had a shit impression of you from Madam Malkin’s.” Draco’s cheeks burned at this; he knew full well what a git he’d been, especially since having to relive it. “So I had that in the back of my head when you came up and introduced yourself. And then Ron, well, he swiped at you. About your name. Said some shit about it. And then you swiped back, only ten times harder –-“
“No, I know. But I was terrified out of my mind that entire year, you know, because of what I had to do.  And there Harry was, shouting the Dark Lord’s name to anyone who would listen, and he was just so…so
But instead of a text from Ari, it was a text from Draco. Harry felt his heart leap into his throat. He felt dizzy, all of a sudden, dizzy and sick.
“I don’t understand this shite!” he groused. “I’m not from this sodding world at all! I’ve nothing to do with it! This is madness!”
Scowling, Astoria threw off the covers and stomped into the bathroom. She washed mechanically and then stomped back out in a towel and fumbled through her drawers. God, she wished she owned things that weren’t dresses or dressy trousers. She had a sudden craving for sweatpants and a t-shirt. She
“I liked the colors,” Draco said, frowning. This shirt was red and black and white.
“What’s the alternative? Starve?”
: hardly got to talk to charlie last night and i want to get to know him
“Fuck!” cried Harry. He kicked the wall again and had to fix it once more. He crossed his arms and paced around the room a few times, thinking. Dean would’ve been his second choice for a fake-boyfriend, but Seamus had managed to take him out of the equation as well. Other than that, who could Harry ask? Once upon a time, he might’ve asked Neville, but that was out of the question now. Harry and Neville still weren’t talking because of Ginny.
Draco knew first-hand the way the brutality of the war affected her. For the first year after it ended, when Draco’s father was still alive in Azkaban and Draco was living in the Manor, not a night would go by without his mother waking up screaming. Draco would go to her (He was always awake then, anyway; he'd been suffering from the worst insomnia of his life and hadn’t done more than catnap for most of that year), and sit next to her in his parents’ enormous bed, stroking her hair until she finally calmed.
She gave him a look before he dipped her. “Shut up," she said when she came back up.
Harry sucked in a breath and felt his eyes go wide. “The
But Stephen was already flinging open the front door and slamming it behind him.
room, how strange; he still wasn’t used to it – Draco immediately stripped down to nothing and spread out in his bed, closing his eyes. He dragged his fingertips over the length of his hard cock and tried to calm down. God, he was so nervous that he was trembling. Not that his nerves had any effect on his cock; he was so fucking hard he couldn’t stand it. Potter, that bastard. Potter was slowly making him lose his mind.
Harry’s wrists were tied, his legs utterly trapped under his own weight and Malfoy’s, and he was forbidden from finding relief by rutting against the mattress. His whole body was singing and shivering and alight, his mind blissfully free of everything, and he found himself giving everything up, letting Malfoy just take him over, every part. He was limp and mindless and floating and free, and when he came, it was harder than he ever remembered, and it seemed endless and brilliant.
“She tried to let him know,” Weasley said, running a hand through his ginger hair. “Merlin, how many bloody times did you call him yesterday? A hundred? The arsehole never picks up his phone, never responds to texts. She even tried to floo-call him – woke me up while she was at it, might I add – but he wasn’t around.”
Mandy hiccupped. “—‘s the gin,” she said.
He began running, shoving, tearing his way through the crowd, screaming Harry’s name. There was William, sword drawn, trying to make his way to Edwin. Trying to stop what seemed, at this point, unstoppable.
“Euripides Fastbrook.”
“Lovely, Potter. I love hearing you talk about missing your ex-girlfriend.”
to come here, for fuck’s sake. You were
“You could…” Malfoy began, running a hand over the back of his hair. “You could all stay here again. If you wanted. If you’re not comfortable with that, I understand, of course. But if you wanted, I could set you up in your own room. The kids could all stay in Scorpius’s room like last time.”
Draco turned around to where Harry had suddenly appeared in the middle of the darkened room, clad in shorts and short-sleeved linen shirt and flip flops, clutching a suitcase and a hairbrush.
Hermione was there, too, and she seemed to be pretending Draco didn’t exist at all, keeping her head buried in a book whenever he was nearby.
“Well,” said Potter after a moment. “We should probably go find out if there’s something we ought to be doing.”
Harry apparated into the entry to Draco’s flat, right by the elevator door. Draco was standing in the middle of the big, open living room in plaid pajama trousers and an old, faded Pudd United t-shirt. Despite himself, Harry smiled. “Do people ask what Pudd United is?”
come downstairs! Everyone’s here, and the grownups are getting pissed already!”
Scorpius nodded.
“Er, ‘morning, Malfoy,” Finnigan managed.
“Love you too, Daddy,” she said, getting teary. Lily was the only one who did, and it broke his heart every time. He kissed her soft red hair and let his cheek rest atop it for a moment.
After several more spins and a few more calls that were almost wolf-like in their enthusiasm, Draco finally stopped and stood still, panting and grinning from ear to ear.
“Can’t blame a man for trying, Harry,” he said. He wasn’t actually bad looking, although he was much too old for Harry.
,” Draco said, his mind stuttering. “A fucking whore.”
He wasn’t going to even try to do anything about it tonight. He was too tired.
“Wonniekins, is that true?” said the twin.
Charlie looked away, hiding a little smile. “Okay,” he said, turning back to Harry. His face was serious, but his eyes were dancing.
Harry wanted to laugh. “This is Felix Fletcher. He made this.” He pointed.
“Listen to me,” Draco said, clutching Potter’s shoulders and looking him square in the face, which was difficult, because his face kept moving around. “We need to go out. We need to go out and get fucked in loos. Or whatever it is you straight people do.”
But then he leaned over and gave Pansy a kiss, and Draco watched, fascinated, at how skillfully he seemed to do it -- gently, and with a little tongue but not too much, his hand coming up to rest along Pansy’s jawline, then trailing slightly down her neck. Pansy was still for a moment and then she wrapped her arms around Potter, pulling him closer, and really threw herself into it.
her happy. He didn’t want to split up their family because it would hurt the kids, and because he would miss Ginny’s company and her humor and her conversation and her hugs. He did love her, in many ways. Just not in the way she needed.
“A sad cloud?” asked Potter.
“I beg your pardon,” Draco said, frowning. “I do not get manicures.” He paused. “Very often.” He frowned again. “But only when you make me rip up my hands climbing or cycling or whatnot, and a quick spell doesn’t fix them.”
“I like Twilight,” Hermione admitted. “But just as a commentary on society.”
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Dean and Seamus went back to the Gryffindor tower after lunch, just to hang out and see some of their old friends, and ended up making a day of it, playing chess and sitting around and it felt so much like sixth year that Harry could almost pretend it was.
“Hey!” Harry called, relieved that Ron had come here first. He ran down the stairs. “I don’t want to go. Let’s just stay here and get fucked up, yeah? I don’t want to go see a bunch of blokes in thongs, really. I mean, it’s so stupid.”
“Hermione, do you remember when Harry and I first got together?” Draco asked, curious.
"I suppose. You're taking this whole soldiering thing rather seriously."
“Well, you’re looking at this from
“It’s not fair if I lie about it, now is it?”
why you’re going to die of a heart attack before you’re sixty, you git,” said Harry, nudging Lawrence’s shoulder. “You’ve got to start taking better care of yourself.”
“Are you my friend?” Draco asked.
I hear my voice
Draco blinked at him. “That’s – you’re joking now, right?”
He was asleep, so he didn’t see Hermione curling up into Ron’s side and touching his face, whispering, “Thank you. He needed to hear that from you,” or Ron saying, “He’s my best mate. She’s just my sister. Plus, she did act like a slag last time, with that Dean shite.”
“I didn’t really do much,” Harry protested, feeling hot. “I kind of just laid there while you ravished me.”
Draco rolled his eyes. Potter was such a git. Absolutely insufferable. “Maybe I lured you here because I’m planning to murder you in your sleep, Potty. You don’t know.”
tease,” the guy said, taking a step closer, and Draco felt a hand press firmly against his groin.
“You had those things in your library?” she asked, her eyes wide.
“However,” she said, looking at Dibble sternly. “The Eighth-Year class has given me pause. I have watched students who were here for seven years – seven years! -- who were in houses that were supposed to foster the best parts of their nature, begin to thrive, suddenly, this year. I have watched them change and grow and come into their own. Initially, I thought that perhaps this was because the stress of the war had been removed from their young lives. And there may be some of that. But that is not the only thing at work here.
. See, this is what’s wrong with you. You were such fun before you went and fell in love. Now you’re just…” She looked him over and curled her lip. “Domesticated.”
“That doesn’t make it any less horrible.”
Harry took Draco's face in his hands. “No, I’m saying that because it’s true,” he said, kissing Draco’s mouth softly.
That old dog has chained you up alright
“Not my type,” Sarah said, shrugging. “I like goofy-looking blondes and redheads. Prefer freckles.”
The good thing was that nobody could see into Harry’s head, so as long as he acted like Malfoy was just his good friend and sleeping buddy, then nothing had to change. Malfoy didn’t need to know that Harry was rapidly becoming obsessed with him, or that he spent most of his time in classes daydreaming about the two kisses they’d shared and imagining what might happen if they kissed again.
They materialized in a familiar alleyway. It was directly behind Blaise and Draco’s favorite club when Blaise was in the mood to pull a bloke. “Hey, you didn’t splinch us,” Potter said, looking impressed.
“Where is she?”
Draco nodded, looking mollified. “I’ll have to pretend to be your boyfriend all night now. Since you started the false narrative with that hand-holding shit. I should anyway, probably. Just to keep you safe from Felix, of course.”
He pushed open his curtains and climbed out of bed and saw Seamus on his own bed, reading through Monday’s Potions assignment. “You’re up and at ‘em early,” Harry remarked.
“I know you do, love. And you know I’m eternally on your side and will gladly despise anyone you want me to despise, but I’m having a hard time blaming Harry here. He realized he can’t have you, not really, so he’s trying to move on. I know it’s been hard for him, too.”
“I wasn’t going to actually hit you,” Harry mumbled. “Not hard, anyway.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and looked at him, but Harry stood there impassively, waiting. Draco set down his own knife and took Harry’s. “The way that you chop matters,” he said, demonstrating. “You can’t just hack at the things. You need to use proper technique, like this,” he said. He lined up a few roots and let his knife handle raise and lower methodically while keeping the tip of the blade in place. “You see? And chopping implies a certain size. You want all of your pieces to look like this,” he finished, holding up one of the perfectly-sized bits.
Harry cast another wandless spell and Malfoy growled into his mouth as he, no doubt, felt his entrance fill with something cool and wet. “
After everyone was gone, Harry and Charlie cleaned. The place was an absolute wreck, and thank Merlin for levitation and cleaning spells. Even with all that, it still took over an hour.
enough. You’re going to have to wait to fuck me, Harry. Goodness knows, I’ll need some time to prepare. I’ve got to buy some new candles, maybe some flowers, so I can sprinkle rose petals across the sheets for you. And music. I must find the right songs for this occasion. Special songs, for a special moment. Might not happen today at all, now that I think about it. Too much to do.”
“Well, I still don’t understand.”
Before he left, he checked around the property for a sign of Stormy, just in case, although he had little hope. She wasn’t there.
The rest of the weekend passed in a blur of booze and bitching. Draco didn’t talk to Potter – they were planning to meet Wednesday for drinks to begin what they were calling Phase One of the plan, which entailed being seen out and about together. However, besides being his partner in crime, Potter had no place in Draco’s life. He wasn’t an actual friend – they were more like acquaintances and work colleagues – and it wasn’t like Draco wanted to start sleeping with him on a regular basis. Because obviously, he did not. Obviously, that had been a one-time drunken hookup. Even if it had been a rather satisfying one, from what Draco could remember.
“Fuck off. You didn’t have to follow me in here.”
“Depends on what the something is, but sure, go ahead.”
“I have something else to show you, too, but it will have to wait until tonight,” Harry said.
“Well, yeah. And maybe, like, longer. If you like it.”
shirt.
Ari looked surprised by that and rather unhappy. “Sure,” he said.
Pansy nodded and sniffed. Her wrists were shackled in a manner similar to her ankles, and she couldn’t lift a hand to wipe away the tears that slipped over her cheeks. “Harry and Hermione.”
They went back in and made dinner together, and after dinner, it was time for pickup. Harry hugged them and kissed them and told them he’d see them soon, and gave Ginny a quick hug and then waved goodbye.
“Erm. Seven?”
“They wouldn’t have known about the engagement, though. And they clearly didn’t, at least not until right before they told me. If you think about it, it has to have been someone who already knew that Draco and Astoria were engaged for a few days. Which means it was most likely a Slytherin. Or someone Slytherin-adjacent.”
“Don’t recall an invitation being extended to you, actually,” Malfoy said, tilting his chin up and sweeping past them and back into the townhouse.
“And I’m not
They walked in uncomfortable silence to the lifts, stealing glances at one another. Potter seemed tired again, and unsure of himself, which was altogether strange. Draco was so used to seeing Potter holding court at the center of a big group of rowdy Aurors and ginger-headed Weasleys – that had been the norm for him in school and for a long time after – that it was strange to see him on his own (well, on his own except for Draco) and so subdued.
Harry felt his brow furrow. “Oh, okay. Sorry. I didn’t realize.”
“Not to mention,” she continued, “in my experience, revenge is never as sweet as you think it’s going to be. It’s always rather…hollow.”
Draco could become a hero in his own right, could be a literal Chosen One, could fight his way across ramparts with a broadsword, could venture into an enchanted forest and tame a unicorn herd, could even rescue and save Harry countless times, and
Just before he succumbed to darkness, he saw Harry take a breath.
Draco shook his head no and tapped Harry’s cock with his hand.
He snorted. “Oh, I’m sure Bunny’s worrying about you this very moment. Probably about whether you’re getting enough iron, or whether you’ve insured the ring she gave you last time you visited. You know, something exceedingly important. It’s probably keeping her up nights.”
Potter snorted. “Duly noted, Malfoy.”
very lovable,” Ron said, grinning properly now.
humans. No, it’s not a Vipertooth. Just…just promise not to freak out.”
“I’m not a tease,” Potter said, frowning.
“If you’re not in our room, naked, in five seconds, I’m going bend you over this poor man’s desk and take you right here,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear.
“Pansy, I hardly think –”
“Am not. You’re a Malfoy.”
“Oh, Harry,” Draco sighed. “I never pegged you as the romantic sort.”
“Okay, which one of you amateurs took that round? Because I want to play the winner,” said Harry, bursting into the kitchen.
He watched, entranced, as Potter poured something into his hand and then swiped it over his broad chest, under his arms, and then down between his legs. He turned, and Draco couldn’t see too well, but he could just barely make out the shape of Potter’s cock as he ran his hand down the length of his body. It was hard, straining up and out and away from Potter’s strong thighs.
He rubbed her back gently, trying not to appear hysterical, even though internally, he was definitely hysterical.
“Fine, fine,” he said. “Tired.”
“In the hallway. I remember,” said Harry. “I wrote you letters for months afterwards and threw them all away. I thought they’d make you angry with me.”
“What are you talking about?” she asked. “It’s clearly coming from that direction.” She pointed.
“Was it because you hated me?”
“It’s alright. It’s his way of showing concern,” Potter said, managing to hike up one side of his mouth half an inch in a pathetic approximation of a smile. “But please do fuck off, Malfoy.”
Fifteen minutes before the start of the debate, just as Harry and Astoria finished telling Pansy and Sarah and Ron and Hermione and Ari what was happening, Tony came wandering into the staff room. He was swaying on his feet, his eyes unfocused, pupils dilated. “They’re calling for him in the auditorium,” Tony said, his words slurring. “Where is he? We don’t have time. We don’t –” He stumbled, almost crashing into Harry, who held him by his arms.
“First of all, I’m so mad at you for not telling me. And second of all…that’s fucking weird. Given where you two are now. That you’re basically mortal enemies.”
Draco growled, low in his throat, a sound of pure, unadulterated frustration. It was, for some fucked up reason, like music to Harry’s ears.
“Ron and Hermione can fend for themselves! Hermione’s smarter than both of us combined!”
Alex was licking into him and then he was moaning, and Draco saw that Harry had taken Alex’s cock in hand. Draco groaned at the sight of it, pulling at his own cock. God, his skin was tingling, and he was wound so fucking tight.
He talked about how wonderful Astoria had been through everything, how she was an incredible partner and would forever be his friend, and that they still cared about each other tremendously. He said the usual words – please respect our privacy and thank you so much for your support and friendship, etc.
“What’s on the agenda today?” he asked.
effort should have been made to allow them to get to know one another, but there had been none at all. There were scattered inter-house friendships within some of the years, although those seemed few and far between, but in others, there were hardly any. They might have been complete strangers sitting there, rather than classmates.
“You know,” said Draco. “When you’re having trouble sleeping, I don’t mind if you come get me. Don’t wake me up if I’m sleeping – Circe knows I need it. But if I’m up, which is most of the time, then, you know. I’m happy to talk.”
“Oh, that too,” Daphne said, looking contemplative.
“Hanged at least,” sniffed Malfoy as he nuzzled his nose into the side of Harry’s neck.
, the thing that was on him. “They’ve done something to me,” he said aloud, maybe to himself, maybe to Frankie. He was trying to pull at it, trying to take it off. It seemed to be everywhere.
“No risks, period.”
“You mean with the bets?”
. And it was shitty of you to never let me meet your family. But I still shouldn’t have done it.”
Sometimes she thought about how things had changed as they’d gotten older, as they’d settled into their own lives and their own families. And yet, seeing Daphne never failed to make Astoria feel like a girl again, whispering and giggling and silly. It had always managed to fill her with hope, to make her feel like everything was possible once more.
, it’ll eat me alive. I don’t know, Draco. I can’t –
Now he looked, his gray eyes locking onto Harry’s. “What?” he asked. Harry saw his forehead wrinkle with worry. He was a worrier, his Draco. Harry kissed the worry lines and tried to work up his nerve.
, Potter. He tolerates people who are useful to him, until they aren’t. Then he tortures and kills them.”
Draco let out a breath. “I know. I’m sorry.”
Euri chuckled warmly and looked around.
Linda was going to love. Only Linda found out quickly that she got seasick any time the water wasn’t perfectly calm, and hardly a day passed without her heaving her guts out into the ocean.
“Yeah,” said Potter. “This ale is incredible, by the way.”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
Well, that was odd. Harry thought, suddenly, of the watch. Had Robards found out about that? But it had been more than a month since then. Why would he have found out about it now?
“Christmas Eve might be alright, I guess. Since there will be other people there,” Harry said, chewing his lip.
Harry nodded. “But Malfoy was awake, I guess. He says he’s been having trouble sleeping, too, so he took me out to the Common Room and we just…talked. Had a proper conversation.”
“Here, do this,” he said, coming back into the kitchen.
“Don’t I deserve to know?”
From the first, Harry was enchanted by the creatures. They all had wildly distinct appearances and temperaments, and soon, Harry knew which ones would tolerate being fed by hand or petted, and which ones to avoid altogether. There were incredibly non-glamorous parts of the job, such as mucking out the dragons’ lairs and clearing away animal carcasses. They had to do the work by hand, since dragons were very sensitive to magic and tended to get violent when they were too close to it. But there were incredible parts, too, like when Harry got to hold a baby Horntail and feed it tiny bits of raw steak. It didn’t have full control of its snout yet, so it very nearly set Harry on fire by accident, but thankfully, he was wearing a fireproof suit and only a little hair was singed.
He wanted to, so that was not entirely bad, was it? Perhaps it was a practical matter of ‘can’t’. “Why?” Draco asked, trying not to sound desperate. “Do you have to be somewhere?”
Astoria was steeling herself for a conversation with Blaise. Blaise was a tough one, all smooth, polished edges, wielding his easy cordiality like a weapon. He knew a million ways to avoid saying anything he didn’t feel like saying, and Astoria had a feeling he would not want to talk to her about Daphne. Blaise didn’t like talking about difficult things.
Harry gulped audibly. “Um, yeah.” He cleared his throat. “Say please.”
“I could’ve saved Lavender Brown and I didn’t.”
She led him to a cozy kitchen, full of bright green plants and cookbooks and drawings pinned up to the refrigerator. “Who’s the artist?” he asked, pointing.
She tilted her head sideways. “Yeah?”
“Pansy, is Malfoy still…is he still
“He has his reasons,” Draco replied. “But yeah, it was.”
“Just relax, okay?” He kissed Harry’s mouth. “Trust me.”
“Uh huh,” said Seamus. “I’m sure you have everything completely under control.”
“Muggles. I swear,” Harry said, pretending to be irritated. She knew he wasn’t, because he’d told her how sometimes he still was overwhelmed by the fact that magic existed, after thinking it didn’t for the first eleven years of his life.
Draco didn’t have time to move before Potter was taking him by the hips doing the turning for him. Potter stood up, running a heavy hand up his spine. “Bend over,” he said, his fingers scratching at the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck. “Spread your legs.”
“You?” asked the woman, frowning. “But aren’t you – I’m sorry, I just assumed –”
, but Merlin, he wanted to find out.
Potter was leaning close again, doing more whispering. The man was leaning too, looking positively enchanted. Potter stepped closer, so that their bodies were touching, and Draco felt his eyes close for a moment, imagining what that must feel like, to have all that glowing attention on you. It must be like standing before the sun.
In the barracks, Frankie and a couple of the other girls were working through the mass of men and putting…
, he thought. “I’m married,” he said, holding up his ring finger.
Then one morning, Draco woke up late. He usually woke up early so that he was out of the room before Potter’s alarm went off, but he’d been up until the wee hours with Blaise and Pansy the night before and had overslept. He sat up, realizing that it felt later than usual, and was casting a
Kerrick came into his room the day after Draco woke up and pronounced him well enough to get out of bed. Draco still felt weak, like an old man, his bones achy and his energy zapped. But after another day or so, the fatigue passed, and he was mostly back to normal.
He waited for a response, but none was forthcoming. He sighed. Well, Ginny certainly wouldn’t be the first girl Sarah had slept with that looked like she might’ve been a sister or at least a cousin. To each her own, he supposed.
him –
“Oh, Draco,” said Ernie, pulling him close for a hug. Draco let himself be pulled, let Ernie run a hand over his back, let Ernie press a kiss to his cheek. “I do miss you,” he whispered. And then, much to his delight, Draco felt it: Ernie was getting hard. Oh,
Pansy put a gentle hand on his shoulder. “And now what?”
compared to what Draco was saying. Theo Nott was no Voldemort. But then, there had been a time when Voldemort wasn’t Voldemort. “You honestly think Nott’s capable of that?”
Hey but I don't care
Okay, maybe Draco didn’t feel all
He promised himself that he would try to feel lucky in a little while. For now, he would let himself feel the hurt of it, the brutal ache of this loss, the pain of this final and necessary end.
Suddenly, there was a sharp pinch on his arse. “Ow!” he cried, turning to see Malfoy grinning wickedly at him.
Harry’s birthday was only a week away, and Draco still hadn’t found anybody. He’d been looking, sort of, at the Leaky with Pansy, at coffee shops, at a muggle pub with Harry and Ron and Hermione. But nobody had struck his fancy. So, Friday night, he decided to take a more deliberate approach and go to a club with Pansy, one of their old haunts from his pre-Harry days. It used to be a great place to pull, full of gorgeous men, and Draco was feeling optimistic about it. He’d made a checklist of what he was looking for, and it read:
“No, I’m not saying that,” Harry protested. “I just don’t want you to do anything you’re going to regret.” Why was he arguing the point? He should be getting down on his knees and thanking the gods for it. It should be the best fucking news he’d ever heard.
“I can do that,” Draco said. Their eyes met, and suddenly it was a bit intense, a bit heated. Not romantic at all – Draco’s current body had not yet developed enough to respond to anyone in that sort of way – but charged nonetheless. That intangible thing that had always been between them was humming with energy. “I’ll see you then.”
Hermione’s mouth slid up into a tiny grin. “You’re going to fix your hair, aren’t you?”
“And?”
“That’s fine. We’re meeting at mine. Just come by when you’re ready.” She walked over to Draco’s fireplace and picked up a handful of powder. “We’ve got to be at the restaurant by 7:30, though, so don’t primp too long,” she said before she threw it.
a boyfriend, right?”
Arsehole.
“Because I’m trying to be honest with you, and with myself, and that means admitting that even if I’m technically available, I’m not, really. Not in the way that matters.”
Harry didn’t even breathe after that, for long, agonizing moments, and then suddenly, Malfoy was sitting on the edge of his bed. Harry pulled his trousers and his pants down further, let Malfoy see his cock.
Draco let Ernie kiss him for another minute, and was about to push him away, when he looked over his shoulder and glimpsed a pair of green eyes in the doorway. “Oh,” he said, freezing.
But he could. Because he was getting naked right there, right down there on the beach.
“Well,” said Draco, dragging his figertips along Harry’s thigh. “The other houses are all emptied out. The Eighth-Year tower is the only one occupied right now.”
“I hope we’re able to keep this thing civil, Draco,” Theo said, his expression a bit too stern for Draco’s liking.
She sat down on a large rock, spreading out her tidy, homespun dress, and he sat down on the ground beside her.
“Well. Yes,” Draco huffed, crossing his arms.
Zabini smirked. “Oh.”
“That is…surprisingly accurate,” he said, laughing. “Then where’d you learn? You’re excellent.”
“He didn’t. Obviously, he didn’t.”
He apparated back to his house, only to see that Charlie had fallen asleep on his couch. He was sprawled out with one hand behind his head, which did nice things for his bicep. Harry sighed, just looking at him for a moment. “Charlie,” he whispered when he was done ogling. “Charlie! You want to go back to your mom and dad’s?”
He was trying not to think about Pansy’s warnings as he hurried into his campaign office. He had a whole pile of calendar items to approve and only fifteen minutes to do it. He sat down, groaning when Tony Goldstein popped his head in the door. “Got a minute?” he asked.
He never speaks to you. He speaks to everyone else, seems frighteningly comfortable with even Ron and Hermione, but he acts like you don’t exist.
“Do you think they’re alive?” Draco asked Berold one morning as they set up camp in a small copse of trees that had shed most of their leaves. He’d asked casually, but he could feel his pulse in his throat.
The evening of the party, Potter came by Draco’s flat with Granger and Weasley. Weasley was still a little stand-off-ish, but Granger had been weirdly nice since the night at the pub. She’d even had lunch a few days before with Pansy. Draco found it all very suspicious.
Another eye roll. Harry hoped Malfoy’s eyes got stuck up there. “
“It’s fine,” Harry said, clutching at his arm. “We can go back.”
“Good for you, Harry,” said Neville, patting Harry’s arm.
Then Charlie’s hand crept down over Harry’s chest and found his cock and Harry brought his mouth back to Charlie’s mouth. Charlie’s heart was pounding so loud Harry thought he could hear it, or maybe that was his own, he wasn’t entirely sure. Charlie was shivering beside him as he steadily jerked Harry, and Harry could feel the twitch of his thighs and taste his sharp intakes of breath as Draco deep-throated his cock.
Shit.
. If you have any desire to finish this conversation, you’ll come sit down, too.”
“You didn’t come,” Harry said.
“Figured,” Tony said. “Those floo union guys really know how to make a meeting last an eternity.”
Malfoy shivered visibly. “Let’s go.”
CHVRCHES /
“Does he qualify for the interrogation exemptions for terrorists?” Draco asked. In general, legilimency was not allowed in questioning suspects, but Draco and some of his colleagues in the Assembly had passed legislation several years earlier that allowed for it in cases of domestic terrorism.
Harry nodded, looking away for a moment. When he turned back to Draco, he seemed to have collected himself somewhat. “Where will you stomp?” Harry asked, trying to keep a straight face and failing.
I don't want no one
“I know that,” Harry said defensively.
“Um,” Harry said, his eyes rolling into the back of his head at the thought. It had been a really long time since he’d done that even with Ginny. Years. And this wasn’t Ginny, it was a very hot bloke. “Yes. Or I could –”
Malfoy catapulted himself over the sofa and Harry leapt after him, managing to snatch the back of his black t-shirt. His momentum had them both crashing to the floor in a painful heap, laughing and holding sore spots that were sure to bruise by morning.
“I know,” Harry said, pushing him onto his back and throwing a leg over him, straddling him and pressing his hard cock against Draco’s, which was rapidly swelling. Draco tried to keep his hips still, but it was difficult. Nothing in the world was as sexy as Harry when he took charge. It wasn’t all the time – he often preferred to let Draco be the one to steer things. But when he did…
“Holy fuck,” Draco said, trying to keep the tremble from his voice. “What did you tell them?”
“Yes,” Draco said.
“Sure. What’re we doing?”
He realized she was right, and he got out a bottle of whiskey.
“Are you –” Draco began.
“Theo, you’re welcome to get just as sozzled as last time and pass out on Daphne’s lap again, though I don’t think we need to base our entire night around it. Three Man’s not very fun,” said Pansy definitively. “How about truth or dare?”
“I think I am, actually,” he countered.
For all he knew, Potter had been thinking of Lia while he was stroking himself. The thought filled him with fury.
Soon, they were all standing at the edge of Evenwood Forest, staring at the Door. Or rather, the opening, because it wasn’t really a
Draco shrugged. "No reason. Except, I wouldn't have made it through the last year without you."
lust, he’d have seduced Harry by now. He was certain he could manage it, given the size of Harry’s erection yesterday after he’d seen Draco in the sheer shirt. He knew that Harry wanted him, badly. If all he wanted was Harry’s (very nice) arse, he could’ve had it, probably last night, or this morning, even.
― Emma Donoghue,
Draco had gotten engaged to Astoria six months ago, and yes, their engagement party had featured in the Prophet. “You don’t know anything about me,” Draco said softly. “Or my fiancée . Or my life.”
“Love you, Daddy,” Scorpius said, yawning. Within moments, he was asleep.
“Merlin, I hope so. Maybe her
“How much?” Harry asked, almost certain that Draco had just made his ask.
“What is it, Pansy?” he called. It was the following Saturday, and Harry was throwing a big old pity party for himself. He’d been in pajamas all day, which were fairly well covered in cat hair, and he was eating a frozen pizza and drinking whiskey and watching the Cooking Channel.
He had been dead wrong.
“Potter, you disliked me before we were even sorted.”
He realized with a burst of clarity that was like a sudden slap that it had been his own feelings about his behavior that had been coloring his interactions with Hermione for the last ten years. His own feelings of failure, his own sense that he wasn’t making the right choices. She had just been her usual self, wise and honest and determined and sometimes a little too blunt. But she hadn’t stopped caring about him or wishing him happiness, and she hadn’t stopped being his friend.
He laughed along with Charlie and took a sip of his pint and waited for a pause in the conversation, thinking now was as good a time as any to leave for dinner. But then over Charlie's shoulder, he saw a looming figure, standing at the table's end. Draco nearly spilled his drink when he realized it was Harry.
. This was like his fifteen-year-old self’s dirtiest, most horrible fantasy.
Then the blonde man claps once, loudly, and the audience startles. “And that’s it! They finally settled down for the long haul and promised not to let anything come between them again, and then made it official and tied the knot, and yes, they did that in the Great Hall at Hogwarts with Minerva McGonagall officiating. They still live in Harry’s haunted house, which has a
“Breathe. Like this.” He took a breath, slow and steady, and Draco watched his bare chest rise and fall.
“Yeah, like that,” Harry said, and then said, “No, wait. Get on your back.”
“Now?” Denton asked, looking uncertain.
Draco nodded again. “You should rescue the lasagna.”
Harry took a deep breath. They were probably right. Stormy was probably hiding close by, but she wouldn't move from her hidey-hole until the storm was over.
And yet, he couldn’t look at her without feeling enraged.
Draco smirked.
“I, um. I told him I had to think on it and talk to you.”
He was home, and he was ready for the rest of his life to begin.
Then, suddenly, he thought of Malfoy, stepping out of bed in only his pants. He’d been surprisingly fit, all lean muscle and long legs. And his eyes were something, too, weren’t they, such an unusual color, so striking in the pale angles of his face. His gaze was penetrating, almost unnerving. And the way he’d talked about sex, so casually, like it was no big deal, like he had sex sandwiches for breakfast and chased them with a blowjob or two. He sounded like he’d had a lot of sex, and that was kind of hot, wasn’t it? And, oh, shit, Malfoy was gay, wasn’t he? He’d
Harry grinned. “Is that a good ‘oh my god’?”
When they all stumbled out of the library about an hour later, they were quite a sight, rowdy and noisy and carrying on. Weasley hurried over to them and took Hermione’s hand, looking her over. “What the hell’ve you done to her?” he asked. Hermione was singing a Celestina Warbeck song -- loudly.
She had never spent much time with Potter. He’d been an important figure in her life because he was an important person to Draco, but the truth was that she hardly knew him. She’d socialized with him maybe once or twice when he first started working with Draco and the big group of their classmates started to spend time together. But he’d hardly paid her any attention – she hadn’t yet graduated from school, and she was just Daphne’s little sister, while he was Harry Potter, Savior of the World and Bonified Hot Commodity. Merlin, everyone had wanted a piece of Potter at the time. Even Daph had a little crush on him then, and Daph fucking hated Gryffindors. Pansy bloody Parkinson admitted to finding him hot. Frankly, Astoria didn’t see it. He wasn’t unattractive, but he was nothing special, save maybe his eyes. Those were rather brilliant.
Harry wanted to ask him why not, but refrained. He was also strangely touched that Draco knew exactly why he'd gotten upset, and was able to recognize it on him immediately, but he said nothing about that, either. Instead, he settled down on the pillow and Draco slung an arm over him, anchoring him. It worked wonders against Harry’s rising gloominess over Gandalf/Dumbledore, but that might’ve been because he could no longer think about the movie at all. The only thing he could think about was Draco’s arm around him, warm and solid and reassuring. He sighed and closed his eyes and focused on the sensation of it, and on the slow, even drags of breath he could feel as Draco’s chest rose and fell against him.
Madam Malkin herself was inside, squat and wearing garish mauve robes. “Good afternoon!” she greeted them. “Hogwarts?”
“What do
He wasn’t, but still. Rude.
“Oh, that’s right. I forgot,” he said.
Malfoy matched his fervor, kissing him with a ferocity that left Harry’s body on edge, like it was almost preparing itself for another fight. Malfoy wrapped his long legs around Harry’s and rolled his hips upward, and Harry sucked in a breath at the feel of their cocks pressing together, separated only by Harry’s cotton pants.
He settled into bed that night, heart racing, gut churning, and thought about the night he had ahead of him, all those empty hours of loneliness and fear. After a few moments of staring at the canopy, during which he felt like he might sick up all over his bed, he grabbed his pillow and made his way to the girls’ corridor and knocked on Hermione’s door
“You’ve thought about it. You’ve dreamt of it. You’ve fingered yourself thinking of me. You’ve come into your own hand calling out my name.”
Potter disapparated them with a twist, and they surfaced in the middle of some godforsaken wheat field, with nothing around except for the crumbling stone remains of an old farmhouse. The air was humming with insects, the breeze a cool relief against the heat of the sun. The wheat was still green and supple, and it was being tossed to and fro with each shift of the wind. “Where are we?” asked Draco, flinging Potter’s arm off.
“Oh, goodness, thank you,” said Astoria, preening. That was one thing Astoria and Draco had in common — they were both whores for compliments. “I’ve got to run and say hello to Fitz Holgraff before he leaves, but let me know if you need anything, yes? And you too, Harry and Sarah.”
“Well. Yes, but that’s beside the point. The important thing is that I love your cock.”
“Oh, I forgot,” Draco said stupidly. Because he had. He’d forgotten, somehow, that he was covered in icy water that was quickly turning to actual ice in the frozen air. He’d forgotten that he, too, might die of exposure.
“Not bloody likely,” Draco said.
“Well, it’s true. You know I wouldn’t say it otherwise.”
“As I recall, you’re the one who accosted
“No, I wouldn’t. I like Harry.”
“Because you were hard up?” Draco said, grinning. “Your right hand was getting tired?”
“Don’t know who you mean,” said a gruff voice.  Draco heard a thump and he winced.
That was the worst part: that it had to be relayed to him, bit by bit, by others. By Ron’s shouts and snarls, by Ginny’s hysterical sobs, and later, by the pieces that Hermione filled in for him, bit by bit.
“Gogg? Is that the name of the town?”
They went in and sat down on the worn couch together. It even smelled like the Burrow inside, like Molly’s cooking, and like detergent and furniture polish and cinnamon.
Draco didn’t know how to respond without becoming a puddle of need, so he only nodded his head.
Ron looked up at him and searched his face. “You want to talk to me?”
William sat back, shaking his head. “No, they can’t see me like this,” he said, gesturing to himself. “This is weakness. They depend on me. They need me to be strong for them. But you…you don’t seem to need that.”
The next day, Draco found Katie’s address easily enough, from Luna. He was on a tight schedule by the time he arrived at her flat – only two hours until Ernie would be at his house, ready to tell off Justin and introduce Draco to his parents.
Frankie shook her head. “We have to go.”
He looked over at Blaise, considering the thing that Blaise was offering. A relationship, an exclusive, albeit secret one. One in which they wouldn’t have to pretend they merely enjoyed getting off together. One in which they could admit they actually cared about each other.
. Draco Malfoy had sucked his cock. Draco Malfoy had begged for the chance to suck his cock.
“’Storey,” Daphne gasped, her big blue eyes going wider.
“How’d the kids handle it?”
“You’ll watch, won’t you, Harry?” Draco said, turning towards him for only the second time during the entire conversation. That same smile was on his face, the same challenge in his eyes. Harry wanted to demand answers, wanted to know what he was doing, and why.
Pansy came rushing in, Blaise on her heels. She was wearing a trampy version of a Hogwarts uniform, with a button-up shirt that was tied up right below her breasts and not buttoned at all, so that you could clearly see her lacy black bra. She had on a skirt that barely covered her arse, and a Slytherin tie that was, frankly, useless, considering the rest of the outfit. Also in play were knee-high socks, of course. A nod had been made to the school robes, sort of: she had on a waist-length black cape hanging from her shoulders.
“Couldn’t very well go sleeping around in the wizarding world, now, could I?”
“Potter,” said Draco. “Took a nap in our room.”
“Hair stuff. Or. How? What did you put in it?”
But he was so fucking
Wait 'til I get my money right
Scorpius frowned. “Can’t you read?”
“I loved him.”
No rest for crosstops in my mind
“Then how do you plan to get us there?” said Draco, throwing his arms up in exasperation.
Harry crawled under the covers on his end and Draco slid in on the opposite side. Harry found that the sheets smelled like Draco’s t-shirt, like they’d been freshly laundered. “You okay?” asked Draco, looking over at Harry, his face lovely in the moonlight that spilled in through the big windows that lined one wall. Harry nodded, and wished he could tuck Draco’s hair behind his ear.
“Neville turned into a bit of a pothead. It wasn’t just shrivelfigs and bubotubers he was growing out in that greenhouse, let me tell you. He’s eased off now, but for a while there,
“It’s not goodbye. I’ll still see you all the time. And after…maybe down the road…” Harry knew he was lying through his teeth. This
“Do you think that’s why things with Harry hit you so hard?” she asked carefully, softly.
“I love you two,” Daphne said. “You’re cute together. Shhh, I don’t know if I’m supposed to say that.” She pretended to zip her mouth closed. “I’m a bad sister.” She giggled and Draco tensed. Astoria must have told her. She’d promised not to say anything. But then again, Daphne must know her parents and Draco’s parents wanted them to marry, so maybe that was all she was talking about.
A head of shining blond hair hurried by, a figure in a sweeping icy blue dress, a flash of a pretty face that looked distracted and worried. It wasn’t Astoria, like he’d thought. It was
Draco sighed. “Still happy, though. Happier than I have any right to be.”
Draco happened to glance up, finally, and their eyes met. Harry watched him whisper something to the girl and then jump down off of the stage, leaving her to join back up with her friends.
“Ah,” said his mother.
“And what are you supposed to be?” Draco asked, as if he didn’t know.
I am flesh and I am bone
, on the other hand, informed me that he’s been shagging Blaise, right up until last Saturday. Which, by the way, he ditched me to do.”
Charlie smiled. “I haven’t been to Italy yet. No dragons there, is the problem.” His leg brushed against Draco’s under the table and he kept it there. “Pansy’s a riot. I liked her a lot.”
“Oh, um. No, not really. That’s not going anywhere. He’s made that clear, and besides, I don’t know…I mean, I’m attracted to him, or whatever, but I don’t know that we have much in common. But, I think you and I –”
Oh god, how was any of that real?
They were a right mess, the two of them, but they were serious about making it work and sticking together. And Draco knew, as much as he knew it wasn’t always going to be fun or easy, that the good outweighed the bad, and there wasn’t anybody else on earth he’d rather muddle through all that awful stuff with.
“Oh, Draco!” she cried, coming over to wrap him in a breasty hug. “He didn’t! My poor baby!”
, you utter twat!”
He chuffed out a small laugh. “Okay. And how about you? Are you alright?”
“I suggested it. I’m obviously okay with it,” Draco said.
“I don’t know any of it,” Harry said. “And honestly, I’m fine with that, thanks.”
Harry huffed a laugh. “He’s not. And…there’s no helping that, is there? I think it’s just going to be this way. And I think I’ve made peace with that. Just because it’s not perfect doesn’t mean it’s not good.”
If it weren’t for his mother, he would go to France, begin a new life for himself. But he couldn’t leave her. It was unthinkable. He’d stay here as long as she needed him.
“Michael Corner became a burlesque performance artist. Yeah, nobody else saw that one coming either, but he was always sort of weirdly hot, with a very distinct sort of vibe. Everyone went to go see him when he performed at Chez Michou in Paris. It was fantastic.
“Then you’re in the wrong line of work,” Frankie said, grimly.
Of course, Ron and George had gotten wind of the impromptu gathering, and they invited themselves along with Angelina and Lee Jordon and few others from that class. Ron also invited Neville and Ginny (“Harry, you’ve got to make peace with them, mate. They’ve moved in together, for Merlin’s sake. He’s not going anywhere any time soon and you can’t avoid my sister forever.”) and Seamus and Dean and Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott and Justin Finch-Fletchley and a few other people. Harry invited Hermione, thinking maybe this would be a good way for the Ron-Hermione reunion to occur, and Hermione showed up with Luna and Katie Bell.
I was looking for someone.”
Marcia nodded, turning back to Draco. “What happens now?”
His warm brown eyes assessed Harry’s. “You look well,” he said.
will not be cool with it.”
friend. You need to just fuck right off to all your little Gryffindor groupies, and leave us alone. I hear the Weasley bint’s offering her snatch up to you on a platter. Maybe you ought to take it.”
“First of all, are you willing to place yourself under a Fidelus? The third individual who’ll be involved is, well. Let’s just say we can’t have this sort of thing getting out about him.”
“Well, yeah, and he
active participant, and not in the ways you might think.”
Lavender gave him a sympathetic look and patted his shoulder before heading to her desk. Harry rapped on the door to Robards’ office and waited. “Come in,” said the voice on the other side, sounding exasperated.
. Tipsy at best,” he said, strangely offended by the accusation, even though he was a bit pissed.
Neville snogged him with messy tongue and Harry could honestly say it was disgusting. “Love you, Nev,” Harry said as he moved back to his spot. “Don’t ever want to kiss you again.”
That night, they took Draco’s mother out to a French restaurant that Pansy’s parents had recommended, wizard-run, of course, and told her all about the café that didn’t have any food. She listened intently and said she’d never heard of such a thing.
Robbie yanked his arm away and looked back at Draco. “Well, have fun with Harry, I guess. I’m sure you will, since he’s a fucking whore.”
Fucking hell, he couldn’t afford to think that way. No, Harry was
Berold was next to him then, swearing softly under his breath. “I can get them down, I think,” Draco said. He stared up at the big ring of metal that connected Harry’s cage to an enormous hook in the ceiling and focused on the shape of the cage, on the vibrations of it, trying to ignore the vibrations that were
“I suppose you think you’re too good to hang out with me, don’t you?” she said tightly. “Think I’ve got some poor-person disease? Well, fuck you. My dad told me to entertain you, and I’m going to entertain you whether you like it or not.” She stood there, glaring, chest heaving.
Malfoy snorted, and looked studiously off to the side for a moment before turning back to them, his mouth only twitching a little. “Well, Lily, if you and Albus do end up returning at some point, I’d be happy to show you all my workroom. Scorpius isn’t allowed inside without me, of course -- some of the ingredients are quite dangerous -- but I do let him watch me work sometimes.”
Draco sighed. “This is going to sound crazy, but I heard your voice, even though you didn’t move your mouth. Your voice was in my head. I assumed I was imagining it, even though it really didn’t seem like I was, but in light of the rest of this…”
“Wow,” Potter said, looking around. “You’ve come here before?”
The third thing was that on Christmas Day, in the evening, when Harry got back home from the Burrow, where he’d spent the day feeling lonely and out of sorts, he received a letter from Malfoy.
“Oh,” Draco said. “But she’s…how old is she?”
Harry had been avoiding Ron a little, too, because Ron was a horrible reminder of the unholy corruption of Slytherins. He sighed. “Yeah, okay.” Maybe he could yell at him a bit. It would feel good.
After getting her a cup of tea, they sat down together on his sofa, and he told her everything. She sighed a lot and said “
They didn’t make it upstairs after all. Their first ‘real’ time happened on the floor of Draco’s kitchen, although the second time was done properly, on a bed and everything.
Draco took a deep breath and tried not to think too much about that. “Look. It’s all going to be under my control. I’m going to pick the day, I’m going to pick out the bloke, and I’m going to direct things in the bedroom. Plus, I’ll be there
“On my mother’s life,” said Seamus, holding up a hand.
Harry wanted, for whatever reason, to keep talking to him. “I really am sorry about your mother. She’s not a bad person. She doesn’t deserve…
“You too,” she said, patting his shoulder. “You ought to come by for tea one of these days.”
It seemed ridiculous, given his circumstances, but he wanted a shower more than just about anything. He’d grown filthy in the forest, despite the hundreds of scouring charms he’d done on himself.
“What the hell? Harry?”
, that absolute
“In your
“It is if you’re looking at the bigger picture. If we lose, the Reform Party is left with Davies. If Davies is the candidate, Nott’s going to win. It’s that fucking simple. And while my life would be dramatically improved by getting a divorce, everyone else’s would be fucked. Everyone with a muggle spouse or a muggle parent. Everyone like Sarah living in the wizarding world. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If you think Nott’s going to stop there, you’re delusional.” He was getting worked up now, color high on his cheeks, a spark back in his eyes. It was better than the dullness of a moment before, that was for certain.
becoming friends.”
There was another sound, a little to the left of the first, a little closer. Draco stood and whirled around, his hand on the pommel of his broadsword. And then he saw it: a flash of silver in the trees, the gleam of a dark flank.
Soon, they were making their way down his front steps, and Harry realized he’d forgotten his wallet on the kitchen counter. “Hang on,” he said to Sarah, running back in.
“Cheers,” said Ari, taking a sip. “So, Draco.”
“Gin, I have to point this out: you’re the one who broke up with me. You don’t get to talk about how sad you were after we broke up, not when you’re the reason we did.”
“Fine. Give me the bloody Portkey, Granger.”
She nodded. “As it turns out, he left a younger sister and brother, Alyona and Yuri, in Moscow, but they made several trips to London in the years leading up to the war. Didn’t fight in the actual thing, but it certainly looks like they helped prepare for Voldemort’s return. And both of them are extremely influential members of The Circle. We’re thinking they’ve kept in touch with some of the former Death Eaters and sympathizers. And Volesky definitely has ties to those two.”
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh my – fucking
? But…I thought…she was on the same side as, um. You know. And you were…” He looked away, his cheeks pinking up again. Harry was almost relieved to hear him stumbling over words. He was so well-spoken otherwise that he hardly seemed like a child.
“What are you doing now?” Harry asked.
“He’s awake,” said his mother, greeting them in the hall outside of Blaise’s room. “He woke up and tried to speak. The Healers are checking him over now, running a few tests.”
“It’s
Draco shrugged. Who could know with Harry? “Being a busybody, I imagine.”
“Come in,” said a deep voice.
Euri sat back, his eyes wide. “Really? But…you’ve been divorced for a while, right? And you haven’t –”
Two weeks later, Malfoy was tried and given a year of probation. He was the only Death Eater to receive less than five years in Azkaban. His gaze had gone straight to Harry when the sentence was read, his expression inscrutable.
“Say something else!” said Jess.
“I will, Father,” he said.
wasn’t back. Harry had tried his best not to be creepy this year by tracking Draco on the Marauder’s Map as he had (quite obsessively) in the past, but he desperately, desperately wanted to. What could possibly be taking this long? Draco should be here with him, celebrating.
Hermione took a sip of her tea and smiled. “Understandable. He was.”
“Yeah. If it’s something you want.”
To Draco’s surprise, Potter didn’t swipe back. Instead, he nodded. “I am. The way I acted was completely inappropriate, not to mention really fucking mean, and I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that.”
“Oh, right,” Draco said. “Well, ah. Harry punched that bloke.”
When the coffee maker was steaming and popping, Euri came downstairs in his clothes from the night before. “Oh Merlin, you’re an angel,” he said, sniffing at the air.
want to do?”  Harry asked.
Draco looked at him with a very fake smile. “It’s not…oh, it’s not a big deal, Harry,” he said. “We’re not going to cast an Imperius or anything.”
Harry was making in his ear.
“I know!” said Harry.
Except that they had been, once, when he was too drunk to remember it. Only once – in this timeline, anyway.
“The ones in the mountains are doing well enough. It’s just the ones left behind.”
“Swear to Merlin, Pans. I’ll be right here,” he said, holding up his hands as though he were surrendering.
They came tumbling back inside afterwards, laughing and windswept. Draco had won this match, although they were about fifty-fifty overall. “I thought you were going to hit the ground face-first,” Charlie said as he grabbed a glass of water. “I couldn’t believe you managed to pull up so late. You’re a maniac.” He reached over and mussed up Draco’s hair, which was already mussed.
“What?” Harry asked, his voice panicked. “What is it?”
while he was in love with Harry. And to pretend otherwise, to pretend like it might happen for him at some point, was dishonest not only to Charlie, but also to himself.
And I know I need to feel relief
“Fucker,” whispered Draco, tugging him close. “You’re such a fucker, Harry.” Their noses were touching and Draco swore he could feel the tiny sweep of wind made by Potter’s eyelashes, could hear the blood rushing through Potter’s veins. They breathed in the same air for a moment, their eyes locked on one another's, and then Draco pulled him the rest of the way down, bringing their mouths together.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said.
“I never meant to. This is difficult. But I do, I care about you. Very much.” He set his hands on Draco’s shoulders, rubbing his thumbs along the muscles there. Draco found himself collapsing into the touch. He was so tired. He leaned against Blaise’s chest, and felt Blaise’s arms go around him tightly. Blaise kissed his hair. “Is that a yes?”
“What’s this about, then?” she asked, hugging him back.
“Hermione’s my girl,” Sarah said. “Love her.”
“Come now. You can’t take that away from me. That’s, like, at least fifty-percent of my identity.”
“Oh, um. No, definitely not,” Harry said. “We might find him faster if there are two of us.”
He heard Malfoy mutter a cleaning spell, then move around. Harry stayed still for a long time, and then finally chanced opening his eyes again. Malfoy was facing the wall and seemed to be fast asleep.
“Mm hm.”
He settled back onto his heels after a moment and licked at Harry’s fingers and at his hole, and after a moment, Harry moved his hand so that Draco could lavish his arse with attention, doing all the things he knew drove Harry absolutely mad. “You taste incredible,” Draco murmured against his skin, and he did, he tasted soft and clean and almost sweet.
, Pansy? You’re being ridiculous.”
“What?” said Potter, his eyes narrowing.
His mother snickered. “Yes, well. You should’ve seen her when she was a girl. She was even worse. For her, this is downright tame.”
“I’m not, you know,
Draco found Hermione alone in the library that afternoon and sat down across from her. “Hermione,” he whispered. “Where’s Harry?”
“What’s an Auror?” asked Sarah.
“Please don’t,” Draco said.
Draco got him a towel and a set of pajamas, and Harry showered. The shower was a big walk-in tiled in bright white, and had excellent water pressure. The soap, called Bergamot and Sage, smelled like Draco. He lathered his skin and rinsed and then used Draco’s shampoo, which
“Horses,” Draco said, pointing. Down one direction, there was a little stable, and he could see a gray nose poking out from under the thatched roof.
Harry chuckled. “Sorry.”
“What about your girlfriend? Can’t you get
I always get in for free
“Feeling’s mutual,” Charlie said, and leaned in, bringing his mouth to meet Draco’s.
Malfoy made a little contented sound and shifted onto his side, curling up a bit, pulling the blanket closer to his chest. Harry let his hand move down from Malfoy’s hair to his back, rubbing it gently for a while, before coming back up to his hair.
Then there was the picture of Draco asleep on Harry’s shoulder on the campaign bus, which was about as speedy as the Knight Bus. They’d been waiting for Shacklebolt to get out of a meeting so they could go to the next stop, and Draco, who existed, sometimes, on coffee rather than sleep, had passed out. Harry was staring contentedly out the window when the picture-taker (probably Eugenia) had said something that made him look over at the camera and stick up a middle finger, grinning.
Well, come to think of it, he hadn’t, at least not well. He’d been unable to cast an unforgivable at Harry in the bathroom. He’d sent curses at Harry, but nothing that would’ve actually been effective. To cast curses like that, you had to have the requisite intent. Malfoy hadn’t.
She frowned. “Boo. That’s too far away.”
. If he didn’t know for a fact that it had happened, he’d never have believed it. It seemed like something that couldn’t possibly be true, something from a fever-dream or a particularly realistic wanking fantasy. “Harry?” Draco managed, and his voice sounded dusty, like it had been sitting at the back of a shelf, unused.
“She got your number from me, you bint. I know she’s texted you.”
, Draco?”
“Oh?” she said, eyes widening. “Wow. So you did that, then, did you?”
“Have fun,” he said, kissing her on the cheek. He hurried outside and decided to walk a bit, his boots clacking against the pavement, streetlights buzzing overhead. He wondered what Potter was doing tonight, whether he was thinking about Draco at all. If he felt terrible about this morning. Draco hoped he felt really, really terrible.
“Oh, like you don’t watch all of that and worse. Point being, all of it features a veritable clown-car of participants.”
“And Sarah?” asked Draco, raising an eyebrow. “Slytherin?”
“You forgot you were covered in ice cold water in the middle of winter.”
A red light was flashing above the door, and then suddenly the door on the side of the plane was sliding up. The light turned green. Ben began to clip Draco’s back to Charlie’s front, and when he finished with that, he checked over all the equipment again. Then he gave them both a thumbs up.
Harry shrugged. “Dunno. But, it doesn’t have to be a thing for anyone else. What matters is how you feel. You’re allowed to feel however you want.”
He was angry at Blaise. He was embarrassed, yes, by how he’d behaved on Friday. But, at this point, mostly he was angry. He and Blaise had been friends their whole lives. They hadn’t been
“Nothing in particular. Just how she’s behaving.”
“You’re so stupid, Harry,” Draco whispered. And he was. He was so brave and so stupid, and it was going to be the end of them both.
Harry was impressed by that. When Draco was a kid – when he was
Draco nodded. “The war hurt a lot of people.”
Make it through all the rest with
- Kobayashi Issa
“I’d imagine so, yes. Well, dunno if it matters, but I’m proud of you.”
Cheap. Pah. Draco mentally cursed Weasley and everyone else on a budget. The beds better be acceptably soft or he was going to find out how to get to The Chrysalis, where his mother and father always stayed. “Ah,” he said.
“That’s a good point,” Harry said. “You’re probably right.”
“Oh, no, no, no. Where’s the fun in that? Besides, Nott wants to have a chat with you before we muck you up too badly. He specifically said he wants you to be able to hear and speak when he arrives. But I’m sure there are other things I could do in the meantime, if you’re all that eager for me to hurt you.”
“What if I stayed? Do you think they’d hire me on?”
Draco was furious with him, and wanted to slap his face, to scream at him for what he’d done.
“Did you tell Hermione?”
You've been there, you understand
“Um…” Charlie said.
“So, what’s the news? Why’ve you come through?” Draco asked Kerrick. Kerrick looked around at their audience, frowning. “Come on, you can step into my office. It’s not so crowded,” Draco said, leading him and Hermione back through the corridor. Draco sat behind his desk, and Hermione took one of the seats on the other side.
“Nothing,” said Draco.
An especially loud bang made them all jump, and Draco found himself back against a wall, looking at Potter’s face with wide eyes. “What is that?” asked Potter.
Draco stilled. Had he heard that wrong? Surely Potter wasn’t saying what it sounded like he was saying. “Oh,” Draco managed. “I didn’t –”
Harry inhaled deeply, dragging smoke into his lungs, trying to get his thoughts in order. He was outside the Leaky, where he was sitting with Lavender, Parvati Patil, Blaise Zabini, and Michael Corner. It was an odd group, and Harry blamed the whole thing on Lavender. Lavender was Harry’s partner, a development that had not pleased Harry in the slightest when partnerships had first been assigned. He'd thought her rather annoying, after all that nonsense with Ron in school.
Draco smiled ruefully at that. “I would much rather have nothing to do with my name, to be honest. I gave up on it years ago.”
Harry felt himself blush. “Of course not, you git.”
That night, the wand was sitting on his kitchen table and Harry was looking at it. It was made of hawthorn, which was a good match for a wizard in turmoil. That certainly seemed fitting for Draco Malfoy. And unicorn hair at the core. The most uncooperative core substance when it came to practicing the dark arts. How had Malfoy managed it?
“Um,” says the man in the audience. “I’m just wondering. Well, all those lovely friends of Draco’s and Harry’s, what happened to
Ron nodded. “Harry, I’m sorry.”
“I meant everything I said, you know. I won’t ever hurt you. I won’t ever betray you. I’ll always protect you and take care of you.”
“I’m not trying to act like anything, Weasley. I know I’ve been a huge arsehole. And you’ve been one right back, haven’t you?”
“Can I sleep here?” he asked. Draco would probably say no, because Merlin forbid Dominic come and find Harry here, but he didn’t want to move. They’d slept for hours, but Harry was still exhausted.
She gave him a soft look. “I will, you goose. No need to worry about me.”  She took a sip of her wine and looked thoughtful. “If Nott really is the one with whom she’s having the affair, why wouldn’t they have just gotten married back then instead? Mother and Father wanted us to marry young. And they wanted me to marry
“Warden,” said Rosamund, pointing further down the corridor.
“I know,” Harry said. He did know. He’d known before he’d said Draco could kiss him. His heart didn’t feel like it had known, though. It felt like it was cracking in half right in his chest.
Draco was shaking his head. “No. Nope, I want out of this. Someone else can finish what we’ve started, if we don’t get to everything.”
to other men. So how is it you think you’ll be able to sit there and watch him fuck them?”
“Stephen, wait,” Draco said, hustling after him. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean –”
Except that was stupid. Potter was going to get back together with Katie Bell. There was nothing between Draco and Potter, nothing but a stupid scheme and a sort-of friendship. And a drunken hookup and a fairy-tear-induced kiss.
“Nay,” said Dibble.
“Oh! Yes!
“Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't so.”
“You love me,” said Ron.
Draco could not allow himself to get used to this. He was certain that it wouldn’t last.
to Hannah last night, my god. Tell me you’re not that sort of boyfriend.”
They sat down in the cozy kitchen and had tea and biscuits, and the woman, named Linda, told him all about her husband, Greg, who’d died several years earlier. He sounded hilarious, and also like he had too much money, always buying Linda vacation homes that she never liked, until they’d bought this one. She talked about how they’d loved it here, but how she had trouble coming back since he’d died.
Malfoy looked at him and shook his head. “I swear, I don’t ever have any idea what you’re going to do or say next, Potter.”
“In every way that counted, I failed him.”
“No!” Potter said. “That’s the thing. I was acting like I was fine, just like you said I should.”
“Um…yes?” Draco said, giving Harry a panicky grin.
The bride was beautiful, with long, dark hair that curled down her back and a bouquet of white flowers with red berries throughout. She was crying a little, though, as she walked, and Draco feared for her mascara.
He slept, unable to stay awake despite the creeping fear that plagued him. He dreamt of the tunnel that led him back from King's Cross station, of the thing that lived there. Then, just before he woke, he struggled for a moment in the in-between, trying desperately to move but unable to, his mind alert but his body still under sleep’s spell. He was paralyzed, feeling the thing all around him, sniffing at him, crawling towards his insides.
, the photograph of Harry naked (or presumably naked), in bed, a white sheet covering one leg and his prick, his other leg bare, muscled thigh on display, muscled stomach on display, muscled chest with its little patch of dark hair on display, one hand behind his head, the muscles of his arms popping out everywhere, and fucking fuck, why did he look so fucking good naked,
“No.”
“A forest,” Stephens said. “Strange ground cover, it was this deep green vine with all these little white flowers that were snapping at the air. Maybe like a Venus Flytrap? And there were enormous ferns, all very bright green, and then the trees, Merlin. They were taller than anything I’d ever seen before. Monstrous things. And I didn’t see much wildlife, but I did see a bird, or at least I think it was a bird…” He broke off for a moment, shivering. “Only it was so weird. It’s bones were on the outside, like? You can look at my memory; it’s hard to describe. But it looked like it was inside out. Bones on the outside, over red muscle. Except the face. That looked normal. And it was big, too. Probably as big as a…a housecat, I guess.”
“Yeah. I guess.” He was quiet for a moment, staring at the statue, and then looked back at Draco. “So, Exploding Snap?”
“And ye shall know them by their skinny jeans and their mustaches,” said Seamus. Sarah rolled her eyes.
“You’re the one the people want. It is your name they’re shouting in the streets. There was a parade through the city yesterday and the people made wooden dragons. They were everywhere, Draco. You’re a
“I can love him and still love you.”
“Oh, excellent!” Draco said, putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “You must be relieved.”
It was getting worse instead of better. He’d have thought having so much sex would take the edge off his madness. But lately, he’d get to the end of a speech he was supposed to look over, or a script for a new wireless ad, and realize he had no idea what he’d read. He’d just been staring at a bunch of letters that might’ve been Cuneiform for all the impact they were having, dreaming of Harry’s fierce expression when he’d said Draco was his, only his, or of the feel of his fingers sliding inside Draco’s body, or of the way his hair smelled or of the way he looked when he slept. And then Draco’d have to read it all over again, and would have to resort to pinching himself when his thoughts started to drift once more.
“Nature is bloody, and as a whole, it favors strength over compassion.”
“Have you ever cheated on Astoria before?” Harry blurted out.
They weren’t in the grass in front of the country lane in Wiltshire. They were still in the forest. And the door was gone.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Draco said, ignoring the last part. “Tonight, then. I don’t have to work tonight. What do you say?”
But Clarke’s Time-Turner must be something different, or it would be out here with the rest. And Draco desperately wanted to see it, to understand it. He walked towards the little room off the back, where the thing was kept, and ran his wand over the door. Warded to the gills. Of course it was.
“Yup,” said Potter. “Good as new. You must be quite an actor, Malfoy. Katie
Draco and Harry visit the portal sites
My belly stings
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco reaching past him to grab his gin and tonic.
“You live in a muggle house,” Harry said.
Draco could hardly think, could hardly do anything besides fuck his toy and revel in Potter’s presence. He could
“Harry, don’t be mad at us,” said Dean. “We’ll be nice to Malfoy, we promise.”
Not a horrible response, Draco supposed. Not the best. But not bad, considering they were in medieval times, basically. “Frankie’s a good person,” he said. “A good friend.”
,” amended Pansy, leaning over to give Granger a little kiss, which seemed to appease her.
And then a hex was flying past him, and he realized another person, a man with fuzzy gray hair and pale eyes was casting.
“Nice,” said Harry. “I’ve actually read that one. It’s a bit trippy. Sorry, don’t mean to spoil anything for you.”
“Fine, I’ll come with you,” Draco said, standing, but still not letting go of Harry. “Come on.”
“Not good enough,” Draco said. “I’ll find out where he is and drag him here myself if need be.”
“For fun,” Hermione said, shrugging.
Draco should’ve cared about propriety. About what Harry would think, about what their other roommates might think. But all he could manage to care about was that Harry was alive and intact and that nothing terrible had happened to him.
Draco stared at it for several moments before picking it up and slipping it onto his ring finger. Then he stared at it some more. “Just to clarify,” he said after a while. “You’re asking me to marry you?”
During negroni number four, Pansy confided in Harry that Ronald had nearly kissed her in May. Harry had a heart attack or two and then asked her what the fuck she was talking about, and Pansy said nothing had happened, they both backed off in time. Harry said he needed to talk to ‘Ronald’ and maybe punch him in the face. Pansy said not to punch Ronald. She said it was her fault, because she regularly did this, because she was a horrible, dirty homewrecker and chased after married men. Harry told her that was fucked up and she agreed. He then told her it took two to tango, and he was definitely punching Ron. Probably.
Harry looked him over. “No, nothing,” he said. “I feel it, though.”
“I’m cold,” Draco said by way of explanation. “But I want to talk about our day.”
He was woefully behind on his twenty inches for Potions, mostly because of last week’s Charms essay (how had that only been last week; it seemed like it was a century ago) and all his SASS obligations. And, also, because he had spent yesterday in emotional turmoil and hadn’t been able to get a single thing done.
Malfoy winced. “Do it, then,” he said, gritting his teeth.
The guy looked thoughtful, chewing his full bottom lip. “Can I, like, jerk you at least?”
During one of these dinners in early fall, Draco was shocked to find Pansy in the kitchen with Hermione, drinking wine and chopping up parsnips. “What the hell?” asked Draco.
“Hermione Granger in those jeans is something I never knew I needed in my life.”
Potter’s arm snaked around Draco, pulling him closer.
Draco shrugged.
William grimaced. “Yes, well. My ancestors were the conquering sort.”
“Really?” Draco asked, looking at her closely, and seeing no hint of fear.
“Just leave it, okay? Just leave me alone.” He was still resolutely looking anywhere but Draco.
“I don’t know if I can be nice all the time,” Draco said, pulling away a little.
Desire, spelled backwards. Of course.
Potter’s back was warm and hard against his chest, his muscles rippling as he clenched his fists and strained. “You want me to fuck you, don’t you?”
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
“They’re my
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco muttered as he craned his neck to stare up at the nearly sheer side of the cliff.
“How am I supposed to answer that? It’s such a nebulous concept. For Salazar’s sake.” Draco poked at the fire with a stick.
Had he lost his fucking mind?
“Right,” said Harry.
“Yes,” said Harry.
She threw on a sweatshirt (the mornings were getting chilly) and made her way downstairs. Harry was already sitting at the table, doing the crossword and drinking tea. She didn’t understand tea. It seemed to serve the same purpose as coffee, but didn’t taste as good. “Morning,” she said, ruffling his hair.
“Are you kidding me right now?” Draco cried, sounding almost angry. “You’re an absolute cockhead, Harry. We’d
Dominic and chop up his body and feed it to the fish. Not an exaggeration; she’d said that.
Ernie was there when he arrived home, waiting on the couch. “Sorry,” Draco said. “I was at my mother’s for tea.”
She snorted. “You are not, you liar. Come for a walk with me in the rose garden and tell me what’s going on.”
Draco shook his head. “I have no idea. What
Hermione took a sip of her wine. “Just curious.”
. It was different with him, different because he was a man and he should have been able to defend himself. “Yes, he attacked me.”
She didn’t know exactly what it was, but it was
“You okay?” he asked.
“God, no. I shudder to think of it.”
“Pretending to love me?”
Harry tried to take his hand, but Malfoy pulled away. “I’m sorry about your father, Malfoy. I never told you that, but I am. I was sorry to hear what happened to him.”
Harry pulled him up out of his chair and wrapped him in another hug. “Don’t do any of that shit anymore. Okay? I forbid it. You did get it out of your system, yeah?”
“Take me home,” Draco whispered.
Harry and Draco investigate an active door
Draco grimaced. “Oh. I don’t think I like that.”
Harry was very much like that, yes. “I’m not ready for it yet,” he said firmly.
“Right, and you’re still in Slytherin with Pans.”
He wandered over to Tony, who ordered them three rounds of shots in quick succession, which Draco was more than happy to do. “Tony, you’re a beast,” he said after the third. “And you’re the best goddamned campaign manager of all time. And I love you. And you ought to be sainted for putting up with me.”
Harry felt almost nervous, but did as Ron asked, rubbing at his shoulders and his upper back. Ron groaned again.
“What?” she cried. “No! Absolutely not.”
He came in record time, and then wanked again, and then studied Ancient Runes for a bit. Then, before he left, he stepped over to Potter’s bed and swallowed. Oh, Merlin and Morgana, he shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. He sat down anyway, hesitantly. He only had fifteen minutes, probably, and he shouldn’t. It was wrong. He leaned forward and inhaled, feeling like the world’s biggest pervert.
Then Harry realized he didn’t want Scorpius to be like that, because he very much wanted Al to be his friend. He had already started worrying about Al going away to Hogwarts, even though that was still a year and a half away. He had trouble making friends, even with Ginny and Harry trying to help him; Harry didn’t know what he would do on his own. But if Scorpius was there, Harry would be so relieved, just to know that there was someone Al could count on, someone he could talk to when he needed it. So really, he was quite glad that Scorpius was a lovely child.
“Feels kind of like a secret that way, doesn’t it? Anyway, how long do you usually do this?”
, he thought desperately.
He nodded and slipped out the door and went to his bedroom. It smelled like him, he supposed, like his soap and his detergent and his cologne.  But somehow, now, it seemed strange. Sterile. Probably a good thing – Merlin knew March was full of awful smells sometimes. But still, it was odd.
Draco has another lesson with Laurel and talks to William.
“Is that my goddamned cat?”
“I can’t do this,” Draco whispered into the dark. It was too much, and too slow, and he could not stay here in this eleven-year-old body with these feelings that threatened to split him in two.
“Sorry,” Draco said, mostly to Harry. “I needed the walk to clear my head.”
and sit on the phone with Hermione on a Friday night. Besides, if it was six here, it was the wee hours of the morning there. He’d missed the window of time in which to call her back. Nothing to do but put it off until tomorrow. Or Sunday, maybe. This week, definitely.
“I – ” Draco said, arching his back to give Harry better access. “Oh, god, I –”
He gathered Sen and cast, and a Door appeared between the karkadan and them. One of the karkadan stepped through the Door from the back side of it, straight through it, ignoring it entirely. It disappeared.
“Well,” said Harry, still not looking away, and unable to resist tucking Draco’s rogue lock of hair back behind his ear and letting his fingers trail down Draco’s cheek. “Probably not,” Harry said. “So maybe we shouldn’t be friends anymore.”
“Dean tipped him,” said Seamus.
“No, she’s rather nice,” Harry offered.
Draco had known, of course, that Potter was dating Katie Bell. It had been going on for quite a while, nearly as long as Draco and Ernie. Draco avoided Katie like the fucking plague when she came in to fetch Potter at Gringotts for lunch or after work, because Draco had, after all, nearly killed her. Sort of. Not that he had been trying to kill her, because he hadn’t been. But he almost had anyway.
Oh god, oh god, he thought to himself as he got under the hot spray. What in god’s name was he even doing? It hadn’t even been a day and his heart was pounding like a fucking drumline because of some ridiculous banter that, if he was honest, had been at least 75% his doing.
He felt the air swirling before he saw the broom, and he looked up to see Malfoy hovering a little above them. “Potter,” he said, looking miffed. “Back so soon?” He didn’t sound happy about it.
Until now.
Blaise was on him in a moment, kissing him, more passionately than Draco ever remembered. “I can’t stand the thought of it,” Blaise said as he worked his way down to Draco’s throat. “I can’t.”
“I think he likes you.”
“This is Sarah, my friend from Chicago,” he finished. “Sar, this is Pansy.”
Everything in the pub felt like it slowed as he looked over at Potter. “Uh,” he said. Very smooth. Very charming.
, particularly if it could procure a yes vote from Fyce. But still she hadn’t been convinced, not really. A ‘probably no’ was not a yes.
“Not a problem,” Draco said. He could easily break through by exploding the brick, but that would be much too loud. He was fairly certain this was the actual surface, that it would take them out into the palace proper. “What’s on the other side?” he asked Berold.
Draco shrugged. “Not if you’re timing yourself.” Draco thought about this. It would be fun to run with Harry. Fun to beat him. “Not if you’re racing your arch-nemesis,” he said, waggling his eyebrows.
Then Harry likely wasn't coming, either. Probably for the best.
“Prove it,” Draco said, finally. “Introduce me to them. And then we’ll talk about whether we’re getting back together.” It felt pointless. Futile. It held none of the sweet rush of victory that Draco had anticipated.
Harry nodded, and Draco’s fingers were running through his hair, and he felt safe, somehow, and like maybe it was true that everything would turn out okay.
She took him in her arms, and to her amazement, he let her. “We’ll come with you. I can run out and get anything that Harry needs, clothes and whatnot, if he’s staying there. Or at least some tea and something to eat.”
“Not any nicer than she’s been to me,” Draco said. “I’m not trying to get something out of her or anything. I’m just trying to figure out what to do about your situation.”
Harry felt like the floor had dropped out from under him. “I wasn’t aware that you weren’t happy with my performance,” Harry said. He couldn’t believe this. He really couldn’t. “I didn’t realize…” He trailed off. “And aren’t I entitled to a warning, at least?”
Well, that certainly made her feel very nice. She might actually like this Sarah. “Did he, now,” she said, linking her arm to Sarah’s. “I must confess I heard all about you, too. You’re a very important person in Harry’s life, from what I gather.”
Harry ran a hand over the back of his hair and grinned. “Could say that, yeah. Little too much gin.”
Draco’s face was going very white. “Of course, because…that was a weird way to say it, sorry, what I mean to say was that –”
say?”
“Jesus,” Potter said.
Men froze when they registered the eerie silence. William looked back at Draco, and then opened his mouth and screamed for everyone to halt immediately. His voice echoed over the fields, deafening in the quiet.
“Um…” he laughed. “What are you wearing?”
“I suppose you plan to report me for the map, then. Even if you don’t report Scorpius.”
William more than I fight against the Queen.”
Harry hustled out the door into the hallway, his jeans halfway on, his shoes and socks in his hands.
Yeah I can hear them
Maybe anywhere the wind blows
Potter turned pink. “Oh. Right. Sorry. I – it was a spur of the moment thing.”
Draco leaned closer. “Pans is going to ask Sarah to move in with her.”
He and Harry turned back around to see that Blaise and Pansy were still staring. “Well, you heard him!” Draco snapped. “I’m sitting with Potter this morning.”
just tell him to ask Blaise! That’s so embarrassing!” cried Hermione suddenly, trying to grab the phone out of Harry’s hand. Harry jumped up and Hermione tried to corner him. Then it buzzed and Hermione made a move for it like she was a professional Seeker and it was a golden snitch and yelled ‘ha!’ and ran off to the corner to flip it open.
Harry tried not to explode. “It’s about Draco.”
weigh a hundred stone. Or, he needed to stop eating as though he was still burning a fifteen-hundred calories a day at the gym.
She nodded. “Thanks. And get those cats to the vet, I mean it! Oh, and my mum’s going to be collecting the kids on Sunday, almost forgot.”
it. Goddamn you,” Blaise said, biting into Draco’s skin almost painfully.
before. It made him feel good. Clean.
“It’s the champagne’s fault!” you declare, and he shakes his head.
Harry tried not to stare at Malfoy, who was also sweaty and slightly dirty, and wearing a pair of jeans and a fitted white t-shirt. Did all Slytherins wear jeans in secret? He could swear he’d never seen any of them wearing anything but fancy robes and crisp business attire, but every time he wound up at the Manor, there they were, in denim, and not looking terrible in it, either.
Ron came back to his house after that and they watched Notting Hill and ordered pizza. It felt ordinary and rather wonderful.
He found himself stomping off, not really sure where he was going, just knowing that he wanted to get away. It was hot and it smelled like coconut oil and he needed to get the fuck out of here.
Harry nodded. “I hear you.” He looked down at the table. “That’s a big coffee you’ve got there.”
It was paved over with bricks. “Dragon?” Berold said, looking over his shoulder
“Oooh,” Potter said, licking his lips rather seductively. Or at least Draco thought it was seductively. Maybe that was just how people looked when they licked their lips. God, he wanted to lick Potter’s lips.
“See what?” Harry asked before taking a healthy swig of his own drink.
“Wonderful. I’ll probably die before sunup.”
“Yes, those, too,” Pansy said, thinking that might be more likely. The Greengrasses owned a shit-ton of real estate; surely that included a factory or two.
Then Malfoy was messing with his own flies and Harry felt his heart nearly beating out of his chest. Malfoy’s trousers didn’t get pulled down, though; he must’ve just pulled his cock out. He yanked Cassius’s hips back and Harry saw Cassius’s face in profile, slack against the wall, as Malfoy began to fuck him hard.
“She is,” Lia agreed. “How long will we wait here, Draco?” The sun was nearly set now, the sky growing dark. “How long until we go back? They have to be wondering where we are.”
Draco picked up some of the pictures, a wide grin breaking out over his face. “I can’t believe you kept these. I thought you would have burned them, as angry as you were with me.”
“Real magic can never be made by offering someone else's liver. You must tear out your own, and not expect to get it back.”
, without communicating properly.
“It’s a date, Harry. I don’t care what you call it.”
Potter nodded and downed his drink.
“I know, but we really were on the wrong side. What we stood for…it wasn’t right. It hurt people.”
“Didn’t see the rash before…this might be an allergic reaction of some sort. Do me a favor and go into the bathroom and get the med kit,” said Charlie.
Harry bit down on his lips. But Draco lied. He only thrusted gently again. No slamming. That didn’t happen until the next time.
“Oh!” said a Granger voice.
“Dumbledore,” Harry replied, and Draco settled back and took a drink. “He was one of the closest things to family I had, besides Ron and Hermione and the Weasleys – someone who thought I was important, who confided in me, who taught me. Someone who kept track of me, who looked out for me. But maybe I should hate him. Because you’re right, he didn’t really love me. If he had, he wouldn’t have sacrificed me.”
He very nearly texted Harry to say never mind, he couldn’t get away after all. He typed in the message, his finger hovering over the send button. But in the end, he deleted it. Because he was weak. And horrible.
“Yes, but –” Suddenly, Lia’s foot hit Draco’s leg under the table. He looked at her and saw she was staring at some place behind Ilana. Draco looked, and there, polished and shining, was a silver and leather saddle. The moment he saw it, he knew.
Crawling into bed with Harry and warming up did sound delicious. “If you’re sure,” Draco said.
“I didn’t need it because I’m
“Want me to do it?” Harry asked.
“We were a bit ruthless,” Draco admitted. He didn’t want to fight with Harry here, not in front of Charlie.
They came to a wide set of heavy, oaken doors and swung them open and found themselves in an enormous, low-ceilinged room full of long tables and benches, with an unlit fire pit in the center, the ceiling open above it. There were handfuls of straw and herbs scattered over the stone floor, and men were hauling in enormous platters of food. The cuts of meat were large and dark in color. Beef, perhaps. It smelled glorious. There was something that looked like stewed apples, as well as loaves of bread.
John frowned at that. “Don’t know if I like that. Why?”
When Pike and Potter left, Laurel was smiling at him. “I'd heard your heart was with Frankie, but it’s not, is it?”
Harry extends his trip to Romania
“ ‘m not,” Harry mumbled. He reluctantly opened his eyes and looked into Draco’s, the familiar clear gray, slightly darker around the edges. He lifted his hand to Draco’s face, tracing over one eyebrow. “I always feel like your eyebrows are judging me,” he said, and Draco laughed softly.
“It’s not
?” cried Harry.
Draco nodded. “I do want you to do this. But I understand why you wanted to see how this went. If we’re to work together, it matters whether we can spend a day together peaceably.”
“I think so,” said Hermione, her puzzle-solving face firmly in place.
“Yes, alright. Thank you, Dinky,” Harry said, handing it over. Dinky took them both by the handle and popped out of the room.
“Yes, in private, if you don’t mind.” He made his way to a smaller room off to one end of this one. “Come, we can speak in here.”
a grouch.”
“Were you aware of anyone else besides your mother and sister obtaining knowledge of our engagement at that time?”
Pansy looked taken aback. “That scheming hussy,” she whispered. “I can’t tell you how unnerving it is to feel something like respect for her in this moment.”
“No, really. We could make petitions, ask to meet with McGonagall and the Board of Directors, come up with an alternative for living arrangements. Like, I was thinking, why is it not by year? Why don’t they put first and second years together, third and fourth years together, you know, like that. It would make sense, too, since we have much more in common with people our age than with, like, eleven-year-olds.”
Racing shadows under moonlight
“Although?”
“Um,” said Harry. People in this city knew his name – people who were into cycling, anyway, and fitness – but the way he said it…
Either way, he needed to apologize the moment they returned to the marsh. He felt horrible for leaving today without talking to Potter first, although he’d hardly been in his right mind this morning.
Scorpius nodded sagely. “Like when my friend Archie told me I was pants at catching the snitch. I still haven’t forgiven him, and that was way back before Christmas.”
She squeezed his hand reassuringly. “I’m going to start carrying the Time-Turner around with me. And rewind if I catch even a whiff of impending doom.”
“Yes, please,” said Draco. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“You cheered me up plenty last night,” Charlie said.
That night, Harry and Draco were getting ready for bed and brushing their teeth in the bathroom at the townhouse in Chelsea. They climbed into bed and Harry turned to him. “You really were amazing tonight. It was so beautiful. Did you make that whole thing up yourself?”
“Yes, but unfortunately for you, I love laughing at my friends,” Malfoy said. “So, Potter. Who’re you looking to kiss?”
you,” Pansy said. She tilted her head at him. “He’s not here this weekend, by the way. You can stop looking around for him.”
“Oh, sure, yes,” Draco said, feeling his heart pick up speed once more.  Draco sat down on the floor in front of Harry’s bed and listened as Dean talked about the wild party they’d had in the Room of Requirement the night before.
“Oh, one never knows where stomping will lead,” Draco replied, letting out a breath. “Would you like to come with me?”
Another lightning-fast move, a blur of motion, and Potter was back on top of him, grinning, blood dripping down his chin. His eyes were unnatural, terrifying. He muttered a spell and his briefs were gone, and then he was lowering himself onto Draco’s cock, and his hole was absolutely dripping wet, and hot to burning, and so tight it was almost painful. “Fuuuuck,” Draco managed, shutting his eyes again, reeling in the sickening and wonderful sensation of it.
“They didn’t, not really. But Lia noticed that he was speaking with you, and that it didn’t look friendly. And Harry said he’d been giving you trouble since you arrived.”
“What’s the deal with you and Harry?”
"If you never did, you should. These things are fun and fun is good." - Dr. Seuss
very naughty babies.” He looked for another moment. “Were Pansy and Blaise hooking up back then?”
“No, I’m pretty certain it’s sticking with me,” Potter said, huffing out a laugh.
Draco and Pansy wait for Blaise to wake up
all that nonsense?”
“I fucking hope so,” Harry said, laughing. “I mean, honestly. This has been torture.”
He made his way back over to Draco. “How are you?” Draco asked, looking over him carefully when he approached.
In late November, the goblins opened up a vault over which they had assumed ownership (According to bank regulations, if a vault was was left unopened for two-hundred years or more, it was deemed to be abandoned, and Gringotts could take ownership of it and confiscate its contents), and discovered one of the most horribly cursed collections that anyone still living could remember. The curses inside were so terrible that they managed to slip by even the strongest of wards and were affecting everyone who even ventured onto a nearby floor.
Their mouths crashed together, both of them tugging at hair and clothes, hands frantically seeking skin. “Lube,” whispered Malfoy, pointing at Harry’s fingers, once they were fully disrobed. “Do that thing.”
more senior role than I do, which, to be frank, doesn’t seem to have been
“I hate you all!” Draco announced, snatching up his things for the shower very loudly and aggressively and adding in some quality stomping as well.
She didn’t know what was wrong with her lately. She was feeling quite nostalgic and melancholy and lonely, which were three things she never usually felt at all. Or tried not to, at least.
“He – but, on Friday at the pub…” she trailed off, her frown softening. “Oh, Draco, I’m so sorry. If he felt that way, he should never have asked you to leave with him. It’s not like him at all, either; I don’t understand why…oh, no!” she cried, looking at him.
He slid the ruby to the thirteen, the moonstone to the nine, and whispered the words.
She smiled sweetly. “Oh, of course. I’ve known you were coming for days now. I’m Ilana.”
“It’s…I
worthwhile about him, didn’t it? Because Potter didn’t run around sleeping with just anybody, per his own admission.
“Absolutely not. I hated every second,” Charlie said, his eyes dancing. He leaned back over and kissed Harry’s mouth gently. “It was gorgeous.
,” Draco whined beneath him. “Harry, I’m going to come.” Harry felt him clenching around his cock and drove in harder and took Draco’s mouth and then he was coming, too, because he couldn’t help it. He was coming and coming in pulses that shook his entire body and Draco’s tongue was hot in his mouth and Draco’s arsehole was so tight around his cock and it was all so good, so good, it felt like flying.
“Yeah, it’s not very big. It’s shaped like a heart.”
He was going to give a relationship with Draco Malfoy a shot.
“I want you,” Draco said. “I want you inside me.”
, for fuck’s sake. He’s not his type at all. And…what the actual fuck, honestly, this is so mad!”
If you make it all wrong, then I'll make it all right, yeah
“Like…every night?”
The thing that had happened sat between them, shimmering and dreamlike, and Harry wondered how it had happened, how it had been real.
. Like, everything. His groin area (not that Harry was looking at it, though, because he wasn’t) seemed weirdly smoothed over. Harry was very curious about how that worked (Merlin knew Malfoy wasn’t small in the cock department) but wouldn’t ask in a million years. Asking would be the equivalent of screaming “I was looking at your junk!”
“Oh, they’re taking us to our bed chambers, Potter,” Draco replied. “They have to make sure we consummate the marriage.”
“Of course I want you here, you idiot!” Draco yelled, feeling almost offended. “Are you absolutely mad? I’ve missed you every bloody day that I’ve been here, thought about you incessantly, dreamt of you, even – “
“Merlin,” Potter said, rolling his eyes. “You’re
, for Salazar’s sake. He still had two eyes and a working prick.
“So this article has information about…dates. That you’ve been on. Pictures, too.”
“You love me.”
“Ugh!” said Ginny.
“Um, what?” said Harry, as Ron looked on curiously.
“He thinks he brought something back with him from the dead.”
“Get over here and kiss me some more,” Pansy groused.
“What? Uh-uh, no way. I can’t imagine…no. She really fucking hurt me, and now just because she’s decided to break up with Dean...no, we’re not going to get back together.”
Apparently, Potter had always been terrible at using his words. Draco found it rather adorable. “You’ve never been among wizards before?”
He set about brushing and flossing his own teeth and carefully washing his face, using toner and moisturizer afterward. Harry used water on his face at night. Literally, that was it: a splash of water. When he showered, he used a bar of soap, the same one he used on the rest of his body. And yet, his skin was perfect, the git.
“Oh, I’m just happy to see everybody,” Harry replied, grinning crookedly at her.
Lia liked the pizza, but was more amazed by his dishes and his cups and his silverware, exclaiming over how smooth they were, how fine. The running water blew her mind. He thought she was going to pass out when he showed her how to use the shower.
!” Draco rocketed up off the couch and stormed up the stairs, muttering about fucking arsehole Gryffindors. His eyes felt hot and full, and his chest hurt. Potter had been laughing at him, mocking him. And Draco had stayed back to talk to him, had probably destroyed his relationship with Stephen to provide him with company after his breakup. And then he had the fucking nerve to act like that. To gang up with Weasley against him. He slammed the door to his room and flopped onto his bed.
“I’ve got the sword, Harry!” Ron called. He ran towards them, Hermione right behind him.
“So...” Malfoy said, his gaze flitting to the door.
There was a grunt of frustration, even as Draco started laughing.
Now we're down to the last two
He glanced over at Draco thinking he ought to head him off at the pass and say, maybe, ‘ha ha ha, I know, yuk it up, Potter’s crying again.’ But when he looked over at Draco, he found himself suddenly torn between bursting out laughing and hugging the idiot.
“He tests my patience,” replied Draco, scowling.
“I suppose,” Pansy said.
Harry came out then. Draco’s father held one of his arms, and Bellatrix was holding the other. He looked at Draco, and Draco saw that he wasn’t afraid. Or, if he was, he was able to mask it completely. He looked full of righteous anger, determined, and a bit wary, but not afraid. Draco thought he couldn’t love Harry any more than he already did, but he found, in that moment, that he could.
“I’m sorry.”
Draco shrugged. “Maybe. Maybe not.” He knew they wouldn’t be, but he was determined to not let that matter yet.
“No, I mean, yeah. It is, but. I don’t really want Sarah to move out.” Harry was still getting used to her being gone most evenings. The thought of her living somewhere else was a little overwhelming.
“Fuck you both,” said Harry, as he stomped up the stairs to shower.
He loved Ron, with all his heart, and had for most of his life, but he knew, somehow, that he wasn’t
“Butterbeer?” Scorpius said, looking cheered. “Father doesn’t let us have butterbeer at home.”

! Not your Mind Healer! Not your mother! You kept leaning on me and leaning on me and it’s not as though I didn’t have my own fucking problems! I lived through the same war as you did, and I lost people, too. I lost Fred –” Her voice broke here, and she looked quickly away, her red hair flashing as her head moved.
“Draco.”
“I wasn’t
“Shit!” Draco cried. He ran to his sleeping bag to get his wand. Potter was almost to the water’s edge. Draco turned back and froze.
Draco was here, he reminded himself. Here, in his arms, Harry’s name on his lips, Harry’s kisses on his mouth, Harry’s body pressed against his, skin to skin.  He said he was Harry’s. He said he’d always been Harry’s. Maybe he even believed it, in some ways.
“Draco, I’m – I’m – “
“Yes, Draco, come in,” she said. She sounded much more cheerful than he’d expected. He breathed a sigh of relief.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed against his hard prick. He licked over the head, and Draco cried out, falling back against the pillows. “You didn’t even move. You were passed the fuck out.”
“Clearly,” Harry said. “I like that about it, though.”
By the time Draco got to the hotel…
“I don’t know, this is mad. I feel like I’m eighteen again.”
Draco did battle with himself for a moment. He wanted to scream at Tony to keep Ari the fuck away from the campaign, but he decided that was probably unprofessional. “Well, we have time to decide, yes?”
“I suppose so,” Draco said, nodding up at the sky.
knows them. And I still haven’t met them. They’re just, like, this mystery to me, this whole other part of you that I don’t know, and I hate it.”
Malfoy looked down, his pale lashes casting shadows on his cheeks. His cheekbones looked especially angular in the bright sunshine, and his creamy skin seemed to almost glow. When he looked up, instead of seeming relieved, he looked absolutely furious. Harry found himself taking a step back without meaning to.
“What’s not?” asked Malfoy, his hands on either side of Harry’s head as he pushed himself back a bit and finally focused on Harry’s face.
Potter came closer, so that Draco could feel the movement of the water where Potter was kicking below the surface. They were almost touching, but not quite. Draco could feel the heat of his skin, though, radiating outward.

“How is she?” Draco asked, coming into the room. He shucked off his jacket and draped it over his arm. Harry and Pansy were sitting on the little couch together, their legs up on a chair.
“It does,” Draco said. “But it won’t feel weird forever, right?”
Harry laughed. “She’ll probably write about it in one of her novels.”
“Ooooh, wow. So grownup. Good for you. I’m sure Harry’s hit on you, though, right? At some point? You are
“You love me, Potter,” Draco said archly. “You said I’m your best friend. Don’t try to pretend otherwise, you’ll just make a fool of yourself.”
“I…yeah. I s’pose I did.”
, he ordered himself.
Draco returned it, feeling strangely nervous. “I’m a dashing gay man who loves to dance,” he said. “It’s like catnip to them at weddings. I’m a big hit at galas and Yule balls, too.”
“Grandma!” Lilly yelled.
“Everyone else,” Berold said. “They’re all waiting in the drainage fields and near the gates. All of Glum’s Marsh.”
“We don’t have to.”
“No. Are you in love with me?”
Harry grinned. “Er, yeah. Lily’s his little sister.”
“Honestly, I don’t understand why you put up with any of it. The guy’s married! He shouldn’t get to tell you what to do.”
“Is it bleeding?”
Harry laughed and looked at Draco. “We’ll see, Lily, okay?”
Draco glared at her before it occurred to him that maybe that was exactly what he ought to do. It was Blaise, not him, who’d created this situation. Let Blaise squirm and be uncomfortable.
“Your dad certainly doesn’t,” Harry said.
Draco checked his rucksack again – blanket, dried meat, hardtack, canteen filled with water from the well. Everything was in order.
And then came the
Then there was Suraj, hot but straight, also not a threat. Zara was the last of the trio, a tiny girl from Nigeria with a gorgeous accent and hair that was cropped close to her head (in the pictures, she’d had wild, curly hair, but honestly, she looked better like this). She said rather nonchalantly that she was asexual but biromantic, and that while she liked cuddling with Suraj and Sarah and Harry, she wanted nothing to do with sex with them.
“What about the – “ Harry made a movement like a wave with his hand. “Those?”
“Yes, I believe they were. Not frequently. It seemed as though there were only a few wizards of record who accomplished it. It required a great deal of power.”
want to talk about?”
He felt the first finger breach his entrance and he closed his eyes, trying to relax into it. Harry lowered his head to Draco’s again and began to kiss him, not quite as softly as before, but almost. His tongue was hungry and hot, though, and Draco found himself craving friction against his cock. Harry ran his other hand across Draco’s chest, down his stomach, and Draco felt himself groan.
“You just sort of pushed through,” Draco repeated with a huff. “Good god.” Draco’s wards were incredibly strong and tamper-proof, or so he’d thought. Then again, this was Potter, and Potter always enjoyed being the exception to things.
She was shaking her head. “He was just a mess. I mean, for fuck’s sake, he was on the losing side of a war, everyone hated him, he saw some

After, Draco kissed his forehead again and Harry nuzzled into the side of his neck.
“No,” he said softly. “Or, not entirely. But then, I don’t love anyone else.”
me. Lord, but you were a skinny little bastard in school.”
“Ha, ha,” said Harry.
Draco looked really good today. He’d changed out of his school robes and had on a pair of crisp gray trousers and a lavender jumper, which shouldn’t have looked so good on him, but did, picking up on the pinkish hues of his skin, making his cheeks seem rosy.
Nott growled his displeasure. “Arsehole. You always were such a mouthy arsehole, weren’t you?”
“Okay,” Draco said, fixing his gray eyes on Harry’s, his expression serious.
“You ass. Why do I put up with you?”
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and took a good, long drink of his gin and tonic, and Harry watched his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. He kept his eyes closed as he began to dance, a little smile on his face. Draco’d always liked dancing. Harry was fine with it now (although he used to hate it, used to feel like a complete wanker when he tried to dance) but he never seemed to get swept up like Draco. Draco was beautiful like this, beautiful when he let go of all his tight control and stopped caring about anything except the music.
He didn’t want to be fucking
Harry’s eyes widened. “Draco, my god.”
Harry liked to be busy during the week because it helped the days go by faster. Unfortunately, things were slow in the Auror Department. They’d finished collecting Death Eaters years ago, and now there was no underlying, continual sort of task for them to rely on. That wasn’t to say there weren’t busy periods, because there definitely were. But there were also slow times, and this happened to be one of them.
“Correct,” Euri said, looking pleased.
He was imagining this was Potter.
“Oh,” said Harry, bending to kiss Draco again. Suddenly he froze. “Wait, what?”
That part made Harry feel slightly horny and also irritable.
“Greg and Vince were hardly my best friends,” Draco said, cutting him off.
, but he hesitated. A one-night stand would make Ernie a little jealous, perhaps, but It would drive Ernie absolutely mad to think Potter legitimately liked Draco, particularly since Ernie had a bit of hero-worship going on where Potter was concerned. “We just went out, was all. To a club. We’re friends.”
“I – er.”
Love is like dying.”
In these jeans of yours
Potter sighed. “I wish you hadn’t come in after me. I feel guilty that you’re stuck here.”
“I guess I could try to find a weekend class or something,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his head. “Once we’re done with school.”
Harry showed up at the Manor on Christmas Eve in late afternoon, a sour-looking Professor Snape trailing in behind him. Harry seemed tense and uncomfortable at first, but his demeanor improved the moment Snape disappeared.
Tuesday morning, he met up with Andrew, who was blond and lanky and bored-looking – i.e., very much Harry’s type. He had fair, flawless skin and hazel eyes, and a small, pink mouth. It was going well, until Andrew started to go on and on about his love of sucking cock, about how he would love to try to fit both of their cocks in his mouth at once, and about how he loved to be used and fucked and spanked and was really into golden showers. Draco began to think he wasn’t such a good match after all; he clearly was looking for something a little different than what Draco had in mind.
Then Harry was standing there, in the hot sun, in his fucking waistcoat and vest and trousers, staring at the empty street.
Draco looked down at the bloody mess of his skin, trying to make sense of it.
“And three,” Scorpius continued, “the Potters are our neighbors. Well, close enough. And Lily and Albus Potter are my friends.” He finished his explanation of this third new thing by pointing up the stairs to where Harry and Lily and Al and Pansy were standing.  Harry felt his cheeks heat up as Al and Lily waved cheerfully.
Frankie’s face broke into a broad grin. “Hello, Dragon.”
Harry grinned. “It’s been a while since I’ve been anybody’s boyfriend, so I’m a little rusty when it comes to the rules.”
“It appears he can’t get over you. He’s still hoping you’ll get back together. He really cares about you, Katie, and he misses you like mad.”
?” asked Ron, as he and Hermione plopped down on either side of Harry.
had. He remembered talking to a man with blond hair, not much darker than Malfoy’s, remembered flirting. He remembered dancing with the man, feeling the man’s hard cock against his own as his grip tightened on the man's hips, and then the next thing he knew, he was walking down a quiet street, and all the streetlights overhead were dark, like someone had flicked off the switch, and he was smoking, blowing circular rings out of his mouth. The cigarette was a brand he’d never smoked before, and he had an entire pack of them in his pocket and no idea how they’d gotten there.
, Malfoy. And you…you were being all…and
“It’s the name,” Harry said, laughing. “Of the game. Can’t believe you don’t remember. You thought it up.”
Finally, one day, he’d had enough. He and Potter had been doing their nighttime dance almost every night for two bloody weeks, and he still had no idea what to think of it. Did Potter really think Draco didn’t realize he was watching? He had to know that Draco knew. But maybe he didn’t? He
“God, no. No, I don’t mind. I can watch, or…”
Oh, no, oh, no
Then, suddenly, in the background of the song, the bass dropped, and Malfoy’s head popped up, revealing itself a bit from under the hat’s brim, but only the unmistakable chin and his mouth, and then his moves became much sharper, began to pop, began to resemble something modern. They were still graceful, somehow, though, and then Malfoy was flinging his hat off to reveal a shining cascade of waving hair that flowed to his chin. He looked different, somehow, and Harry realized that his eyebrows had been darkened and his eyes lined or something, so that you couldn’t help but look –
Malfoy strode off in the direction of the kitchen and Harry couldn’t help but notice that he was still quite fit, in soft gray trousers and a white button-up. His stride — and his legs—were still distractingly long. Harry could never imagine something happening with Malfoy though, despite how annoyingly attractive he still was. It wasn’t like with Connell; he and Malfoy didn’t have that curious, playful banter thing going on. It was more just a strong, mutual dislike.
The bad feeling was spreading all over his body now, infecting him. He felt like he was moving through molasses; his limbs were so heavy. He managed to walk over to the window. “Ron,” he said quietly. “Where’s Harry?”
Malfoy dimmed the lights and put on the type of music that you might hear in a spa, and had the kids do some stretches and some yoga poses, which he called various animal names. Harry knew little about yoga, despite Ron’s recent obsession with it, but he was almost certain that no yoga pose was called 'hungry sloth'.
“I fucking hope not. I’m trying to pretend it never did.” He managed to get his second foot into his trousers and stumbled.
Harry brushed back a strand of silky blond hair.
“Good,” William said, nodding firmly and turning back to the window. “Thank you.”
“Darling, I think Albus is trying to pick up a
“Good,” said Sarah. “He’s being a major asshole about it.”
boring,” Harry said, feeling strangely offended. “It
Nobody slept much that first day. No one was tired. They were all buzzing with the same nervous energy, tense and anxious over what awaited them at the end of their journey.
Draco turned back towards the cabinet and pulled out his teapot, which was bright blue with a yellow top. He splashed some hot water from the tap into the teapot to warm it up, and then poured it back out. He placed three teabags inside and then tapped his fingers impatiently, thinking he would go mad waiting for the bloody kettle to boil. It did though, a moment later, and he quickly poured in the hot water and brought it over to the table where Harry had made himself comfortable. “Do we have to wait for it to steep as well, Your Highness?”
That night, in bed, Astoria was thinking of Daphne. She always thought of Daphne after her hectic days were at an end. She thought often of when they were young together, playing in their parents’ enormous house, running down corridors and driving Pipsy mad. The other day she’d been thinking about how they’d hidden a small frog in the sugar bowl, their logic being that the frog could eat sugar, and he wouldn’t be able to get out. Mother had been very unhappy to find him there in the morning.
He stood up, shaking all over. “Or hell, maybe somebody
Harry turned around and ran a finger over Ron’s nose. “You have a good face. I’ve always liked your face, do you know that? It’s very kind.”
Her grin slowly faded and she examined him. “What are you playing at, exactly? Are you joking? Or is there some other reason you’re announcing your proclivities to your long-term beard?”
A Saturday, one without Lily, without even Pansy, and Harry was waiting nervously in the solarium for Draco to come home. At his feet was a little box, and in the box were two tiny, midnight-colored kneazles. Earlier, Stormy had climbed into the box with them, and was lying there, blinking lazily, letting the kneazles burrow into her fur, seeking comfort.
“Definitely not,” said Ron, and proceeded to pass out.
“No,” Draco said, meeting his eyes. “I’m really not.”
“Yes,” he said. And he did. He also had no idea if any of it would work, or whether he was clinging to hope where there was none.
Harry went and sat down on the other end of the bed. “No. Slept alright last night. You?”
“Better,” she said.
to take things slower?” Draco asked.
By the end of the night, they had a rough plan for their Saturday get-together. And Harry had enough material to last him through a lifetime’s worth of wanking. But when he got back to his bed, that thing happened that so often did. His normal, daytime thoughts were pushed aside for the irrational, anxious nighttime thoughts, and any chance of wanking disappeared like smoke. Harry tried to think of happy things, nice things, like flying and Hermione and Ron and the party on Saturday, which seemed like it would be a lot of fun, really, but instead, he kept thinking about green fire, and the over-exposed version of Kings Cross Station that he’d walked with Dumbledore. When he’d been dead.
“Katie’s rather stoic, isn’t she?” he asked.
“I’d be more miserable without this,” Draco said, and Harry watched, shocked, as his eyes filled. He’d seen Draco cry a handful of times, maybe, but he always seemed a little angry when he did. But now, he just seemed tired, like how Harry felt. Like he had reached the end of his strength, of his hope. "Harry. Please. It would be worse without you.”
“Apparently so,” said Draco. He could only imagine what those three had gotten up to. And he did want to imagine it. Very, very much.
“When I’m mad. It’s…probably not a healthy way to deal with anger.”
Daphne shook her head. “If I talk to him about that, then he’ll start up on my shopping or god only knows. Better to let him get himself in trouble, bail him out, and then get him to promise not to do it anymore while he’s feeling guilty.”
“He, ah, likes me well enough, yeah,” Harry said, embarrassed. The truth was, both Robards and Shacklebolt kept in touch with him this year, both of them encouraging him to sit for the NEWTs that were necessary to become an Auror, both of them explaining how much the Auror department could use him in rounding up the last of the Death Eaters.
Neither of them knew quite what to say, so they were both quiet in the aftermath of her fury. “I’m sorry that I let you down. I should’ve known it was a trap,” she said softly.
“What are you doing?” asked Harry, his voice suddenly unsure.
Just before he left, Draco turned, and his eyes glinted silver in the darkness as they met Harry’s. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad it wasn’t you,” he said softly. “There was no good outcome, but the worst one – for me, anyway – would’ve been if you’d been hurt.”
She gently set down her tea. “Then why on
Draco pulled Blaise’s thumb out of his mouth, and moved over to Blaise’s pointer finger. He licked the tip of it, just a flicker of his tongue, and then took it into his mouth, deep and slow, never letting his eyes leave Blaise’s.
It was an actual marsh, first of all. He didn’t know why this hadn’t occurred to him, but it hadn’t. It was too wet to travel on horseback, so they had to walk. Trekking through the marsh was hell. The ground sucked at Draco’s feet with each step, making his legs feel like they were tied to weights.
“I don’t think it’s always like that,” Harry protested. “Ron and Hermione have a really great marriage.”
Euri recoiled and looked disturbed. “I’m not – I’m not talking to you about that. My god. I just want to forget it ever happened.”
"It didn't come up," Draco said between kisses.
“Potter,
“A good number of us stayed over. Afraid to disapparate, you know, lest we splinch ourselves somewhere terrible. Heard you had a rough night, eh, Harry?”
“Wait, that’s not –”
He went to bed that night feeling rather amorous. Probably because he had a date for the first time in forever. He was going to have to get over his age hang up, so he considered this practice. He tried to picture Euri’s very nice face with its dimples, and his soft-looking brown hair, and his arse in his jeans. He slipped a hand under his pants, trying to keep all this in his head. But for whatever-fucking-reason, maybe because he was still upset over it, his brain kept supplying him with images of Malfoy’s snarl.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
“I dunno, that’s what I’m asking you.”
Draco had zero intention of doing anything about Mrs. Fyce’s niece, but he thought that perhaps it was okay to pretend that he
? I’ve been promoted to Senior Curse Breaker!”
Blaise put out a hand. “Astoria, there’s no need to –”
“But maybe I could’ve, sometimes,” she said softly.
Monday consisted of Draco eating Blaise’s arse and then slamming his dick into it (a new thing for them; Blaise had never bottomed before) during their morning free period, and then, while everyone was at dinner, they engaged in an interesting dual-blowjob-slash-fingering endeavor, which was surprisingly satisfying.  That night, it was back to the basics, and Blaise fucked Draco like his life depended on it. Despite their sex-marathon, Draco didn’t sleep that night. While he was awake and staring forlornly at the canopy above Blaise’s bed, he refused to think about Harry, or how he’d been at the Gryffindor table, seated next to Ginny, that morning.
But after the meeting with faculty members, they had to rush to class. After class, Harry disappeared, and Draco couldn’t seem to find him anywhere, and then Pansy came to Draco’s room with a packed bag, and it was time to go to London.
“Little late for that, isn’t it?”
“Oh, it’s all a bunch of nonsense, Potter. Except for the sex part. Romance and love just doom you to an empty existence of sitting around, pretending that you only ever want to sleep with one person for the rest of your life. Why do you think I’ve never married?”
let you make me dinner, then. I’m not about to lose to you, Potter.”
“You’re drunk,” Draco said, his eyes slowly blinking open. “You should go.”
“That's understandable,” said Ilana. The cottage was small and neat, with an open fireplace with a pot boiling over the flames, a small bed in a corner, a rocking chair in another, and a little table with two stools. “I noticed that a karkadan found you yesterday. Please, sit,” she said, gesturing to the stools.
“I know, I’m impressive,” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and deepening the kiss.
“So why does it seem so strained between you now? Why isn’t he here with us?”
Draco smiled at her, grateful. Pansy could be an utter bitch, but she could also be like this: fun and kind and compassionate without making him feel like a sad sack. Maybe he ought to just marry her, have one more night of drunken hetero sex (Merlin knew it wouldn’t be the first time for the two of them), pop out an heir, and then they could spend the rest of their lives talking shit about everyone else. There were worse fates, he supposed.
“That you need me to stay. That you want me to stay here with you, that you see this thing with us becoming something more.”
“So you have the spell? We can use it to create a door to the other world?”
Malfoy looked at him and started laughing quietly, his cheeks pink. “Control yourself, you animal,” he whispered.
McGonagall studied Hermione’s face. “That was very reckless, Miss Granger.”
He sat a little while longer and decided that trying to kill Harry in the loo was probably not the best plan, and then he stomped out of the pub. He showed up at Pansy’s unannounced, where she was plying some unsuspecting bloke with a bottle of wine and her tits, which were on display to an even greater degree than usual. “Out!” Draco shouted at the man, who stood up scowling, like he was going to tell Draco off. Draco kind of hoped he would, because that would give him an excuse to punch something.
“Yeah. I kinda needed it, too,” said Harry. “I’m not getting any from
“Fine,” said Potter, not meeting his eyes.
? I mean, it’s not like you didn’t earn the reputation. You practically killed yourself to save us all.”
“You think I’m mocking you?”
“The travel stuff might be more of a challenge than we think,” Harry said, contemplating it. “I’m going to have different expectations than you.”
“Because you like tramps like Pansy Parkinson?”
“You fucking git,” Draco said, wiping his eyes and trying to calm himself. “Come here.” He began pushing Harry in the direction of a suspiciously dark corner, back behind the little stage.
“Thank you,” Draco whispered. It was so kind and unexpected that he had no idea what else he might say.
Draco had his second debate with Theo tonight, and Pansy and Sarah were going with Harry and Ari.
“Levicorpus,” said Travers, sounding almost bored. Draco felt himself flip upside down, and then it was as though he was being held by his ankles. He moved down the stairs that way, his head banging hard against the rail every now and then.
Draco was on top of him, naked. This was Draco, beautiful and perfect and everything Harry’d ever wanted. He couldn’t believe it, honestly. It seemed like a dream. “What do you want?” he asked, his voice rough.
“Does it upset you when you say them?”
Green.
It could be the running, maybe. Harry’s arse looked incredible in those swishy trousers. Or it could be that stupid green sweater of Macmillan’s that he’d worn yesterday. Or it could have been that damn leather jacket. Fuck’s sake, that had almost tipped Draco right over the edge. He was already worked up, just from the way Harry had been looking at him in the first outfit he’d tried on, that green gaze burning its way down Draco’s body, lingering at the sheer part. And then Draco had taken a look at Harry in those jeans that actually fit him well, and that t-shirt that fit even better, and that fucking jacket, and he’d been
“Got it,” said Tony, standing. “Oh, hey, just a heads’ up…” Draco watched as Tony’s face creased into a frown, his golden-brown brows furrowing. “Security intercepted a cursed package this morning. Addressed to you.”
“Then it’s the best option we have," Laurel said. "Tell us.”
had happened in Chicago. She didn’t think Draco would actually cheat on her, although one could never be sure. But he was a good man, and he took his vows seriously. It could very well be that seeing Potter had simply churned up old feelings. Regardless, his behavior was disconcerting. She’d thought for certain that a bloody decade would to have been enough time for Draco to get over his little tryst with Potter. The fact that it hadn’t been was problematic, unnerving her more than she would have liked.
William was becoming a friend, and all of the men respected him, thanks to his show of magic today. Things here, on the road, were good.
He felt a bit like he might throw up, which was obviously very romantic. Hopefully, it wouldn’t come to that. With trembling fingers, he took Draco’s wrist and faced his palm upward, then settled the little gold band onto it.
“Nothing, darling. Let’s drop it.”
“I suppose it is,” Draco said, unable to help the little smile that appeared on his face.
They had no time to say anything to one another, though, because more men were coming.
“You managed to stop yourself before the thing got ahold of you today,” Malfoy said, as though reading his thoughts. “In the bathtub. It was creeping in, but you stopped it.”
“Well, for the moment, but they’ll get back together,” said Harry.
, he sent out into the night sky as a karkadan finally knocked the sword from his hand, causing him to stumble onto the rocky beach. He looked at the smooth, pretty rocks for an instant before closing his eyes and waiting for a killing blow.
“How about you? You and Ari?” Draco asked. He wasn’t looking at Harry, now, and his cheeks were pink.
“Just stay still, ‘Storey,” Daphne said, her big eyes wet and pleading. “Stay still and he won’t hurt you.”
,” he cried, pleasure coiling low in his belly, his balls drawing up tight.
,” Draco said, crossing his arms. “I was worried.” He looked over at Harry, who had a bemused expression on his face. “Fine, I was a little scared.” Harry kept looking at him. “Okay, I was fucking terrified, all right? I thought you were dead. You almost
While they ate, Potter talked about his dreams, which sounded fucking awful, and then hinted that it had started in the Forbidden Forest.
Draco looked uneasy. “I didn’t intend to. We were all at an event when you called. Astoria insisted.”
Hermione, as though she could read his mind, cast a hot air spell over him and his clothes dried immediately. “Thanks, ‘Mione,” he said.
“Well,” she said, and then got quiet for several moments, her face screwed up, brow furrowed. She nodded to herself once, then twice. “Okay. I’ll need to look into this. See if there’s anything in the Department’s library or in the Death Chamber that might tell us what’s there, on the other side, and whether there are any entities that tend to hang out there.”
, he replied.
Then he set about skinning his shrivelfig. “Any pointers, Malfoy? I’m sure I’m doing this all wrong, too,” Harry said with an edge.
“Well, let’s do that then,” Draco said. “Surely you have some pasta or something I can boil.”
“Fucking hell,” Harry said, grimacing. “Poor Hermione.”
like the war, like Voldemort, sort of reptilian and dark.
“Who’s there?” Scorpius replied, bouncing up and down on his seat.
“Then I’ll be fine, won’t I? I’ll just yell my head off if I’m in need of rescuing,” Draco whispered, giving him a wink that had Harry’s cheeks flaming.
He swept his wet hair from his face with one hand, a small grin flitting over his mouth. There was something ridiculously satisfying about the fact that Harry Potter was so ever-present in his life these days that there were reasons to be irked by him. Not justifiable reasons, perhaps, but Draco’d never felt the need to justify being irritated.
Potter was deep in conversation with Lia, asking her all about her training philosophy and what to expect over the next few weeks. She answered him in her typical solemn way, taking each of his questions seriously and mulling them over before replying. As much as Lia did not seem to be one for small talk, she certainly could command a conversation when she chose to. There was something quite compelling about her, about her intensity and focus. Draco could see why her soldiers all seemed to revere her.
William nodded, pushing his hair out of his face and tucking it behind his ears. It shone brightly in the dim light of the room, and it looked very soft. “Can I stay here with you tonight, Dragon? I don’t want to be alone.”
“Say my name when you ask,” Harry instructed, licking Draco’s cock again, this time lingering around the head, circling it with his tongue.
“The water. You drank all that lake water…I bet that’s what did it. I just bet you.”
“Dunno,” Harry said. “It’s kind of wonderful not to know, isn’t it? We could travel. We have about fifty places on our list at this point. We could start crossing them off.”
She nodded, and he made the mistake of looking directly at her again. Her eyes were warm and full of something soft, and he realized, to his extreme humiliation, that it was pity. “You’re not planning to come back, are you? When you leave.”
He lifted his hands to Malfoy’s face, letting them slide over that sharp jaw, feeling a bit of stubble there, and then into his hair. His hair was soft and silky between Harry’s fingers. Harry smelled that minty smell, the thing he’d smelled when Malfoy had come out of the shower, along with something else, something bright and clean, like maybe citrus.
Six pints and no dinner later, they stumbled back to the Ministry to use the floo, because there would be no apparating that evening. They went together, which was stupid, because you could get smooshed and battered, and then landed in a heap in Harry’s fireplace, laughing.
That wasn’t even talking into consideration all the magical harm Harry might do to him. He wasn’t certain whether the thing could access his magic, but it was possible, wasn’t it?
“So that’s a no, then,” said Draco, and he heard Astoria chuckle softly behind him.
Potter shot upright with a yelp and grabbed for his wand, and had it pressed to Draco’s throat half a second later. “Malfoy?” he said, squinting. He lowered his wand and sat back and grabbed for his glasses. “Are you naked? Did we, uh…”
“Fuck’s sake.
“I take it we’re not going for a run,” said a voice near Harry’s head.
by her. She had never, ever, in a million years, thought he’d look at her that way.
Harry took a sip of his pint. “Those last two stools at the bar, over there,” he said instead of answering the question. “You were on the one on the right.”
The whole thing was a vicious cycle. The sorting hat, now that he thought on it, seemed to put a wholly inappropriate emphasis on these familial biases. He thought that maybe the sorting hat deserved to be set on fire.
That was the good thing about driving a car: it gave you time to process. By the time he pulled into his shed, he felt like he’d done the right thing. He was back to having only three cats, which, to his mind, seemed a lot more normal than seven.
“You know that could get you in a lot of trouble if someone saw you. Mr. Potter, in fact, could report you for apparating without a license.”
Ron looked at him. “Harry, it’s shit. It feels awful lately.”
“Okay. Good.” He ran around throwing everyone’s swimsuits into a bag and rummaged through a drawer to find his sunglasses. Then he realized he wanted to help with lunch, so he hurried downstairs and packed up everything for cheese and tomato sandwiches (his tomatoes were really coming in at the moment, and they were
“Berold, for fuck’s sake!” Draco cried, gesticulating wildly. “These are not horses and we did not steal them! We are not drunk, and we did not eat any questionable fungi! Lia’s telling the truth! They’re unicorns.”
Hermione looked pleased by this. “I can’t wait to study Potions. I’ve already read the textbook.”
Charlie fixed his face into a frown which lasted approximately two seconds before he laughed.
It was much like every other Christmas Eve at the Manor: brilliant, sparkling, dizzying, colorful, lush. Only this time Harry was there, sprawled out next to Draco, their shoulders just barely touching. Draco watched Harry, entranced, noticing how his brow furrowed as he tried to think of another question to ask Pansy. Noticing how genuinely adorable he looked in a tuxedo.
, and that it was all okay, and the world hadn’t blown up or anything because of it. Draco was allowed to be here, with Harry, to be kissing him and laughing with him, and everyone knew because Harry had
“Potter, for shame! This is obviously what’s wrong with you, not getting shagged after committing so many good deeds. The whole universe is unbalanced now, and we’ve got to fix it. Who do you fancy?”
were the one who was brave. Not him.”
“Um, a date?”
Pansy looked shocked and much too thrilled. “With Ginny? She’s quite attractive, why wouldn’t you want to have sex with her?”
Berold sighed, looking tired. “We have to find out what happened first. Then we’ll make our plans. And yes, of course we’ll retrieve him. He is our Lord Commander.” His voice was firm and solid and reassuring.
“Can we
“Why, train to be soldiers, of course,” said William, grinning. “Do either of you know how to swing a broadsword?”
“You forgot modest.”
“Tell me,” said William. “I may not be able to take my revenge openly, Draco, but I will take it. Tell me what happened.”
“Keep in mind that the concept of a god or gods is man-made. If a society encountered an otherworldly entity that had power over them, it’s makes sense that they would want to appease that entity, through worship or by whatever other means they could, make a deity of it.”
Harry set it down, feeling conflicted. Draco was missing the class trip. Draco, the reason Harry had been so excited about it, was not going to be there. Harry wasn’t going to get to see Florida and New York City with Draco. He’d be alone. Well, not alone, but. Sort of alone.
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
“I suppose it is,” Lia said, sighing.
She heard a faint reply from the kitchens.
He shot upright, chest heaving.
“You’re an arsehole,” Draco moaned, as Blaise pulled at his trousers.
“What are you doing?” asked Ari, looking very concerned.
“Potter,” she and Blaise and Daphne said at the same time.
Draco wished he was in a better frame of mind. He needed to act on this, push it. His mind wasn’t doing its job, though. Instead of scheming, it kept thinking about how he wished this was Potter perched on his bed, Potter’s hand on his cheek.
“Pansy said I pushed you too much. Seemed to think it’s all my fault.”
Draco and Harry were in William’s quarters tending to the most gravely injured Badgers. Harry was bandaging them up, giving them water, and making them comfortable until Draco could come round and attempt to heal them. It was working more often than not, but every time he failed, it seemed to negate every previous success.
, I broke rules in order to fight evil. James breaks rules just to see what will happen.”
However, she certainly wasn’t going to let her desire to make Draco pay for his sins a bit longer dissuade her from going to Harry Potter’s birthday party. Merlin’s sake,
All the color seemed to drain from Malfoy’s face. Harry saw his eyes dart over to his friends and then back to Harry. “I suppose, Potter,” he said, coming to stand next to him awkwardly, his arms crossed in front of him, like he wasn’t quite sure what to make of this.
“As certain as I can be. I mean, you never know how these things are going to go, right?”
But, Draco chided himself,
Harry and Luna were with Pansy at one of the Slytherin-heavy tables. Ginny’d wanted to mix things up a bit and put Harry and his dates with Ron and Hermione and Theo and his wife, but Harry hinted that maybe Pansy and Ron shouldn’t sit together. Not that he was worried; he knew that things had somewhat normalized between them, but still. The awkwardness would’ve been brutal. Ginny raised her eyebrows at that but acquiesced. The kids were seated up at the head table with Gin and Blaise, but came running over periodically throughout dinner to hug Harry and ‘Aunt’ Pansy.
Draco shook his head. “Not that I know of.”
Michael Corner was the only one there. “Not sure where Ernie is,” he said. “Harry’s with Dean and Seamus and Weasley somewhere.”
Draco stayed awake for a long time afterward, thinking of Harry, of his green eyes with their too-dark lashes.  Remembering that other life where things had been so different, where Harry had been the one holding him.
“Yes,” Draco said. “I
Lily and Albus didn’t take the hint, though, because while they had been impressively silent thus far, they now seemed keen on blabbing. “Oh, yes, my mum and dad got divorced last year, but it was amable,” said Al.
“Go,” said Pansy in a voice that did not leave room for negotiation. “I’ll owl you.”
“Oh, bravo,” said Harry.  “That was really good.”
, Draco didn’t understand.
“Of course I will. You have to, what? Feed and water it? Get it a litter box? And a bed? Take it to the vet?”
“You fucking liar,” Cassius said, leaning closer. “You’ve still got a pretty mouth, though. You want to suck me off in the loo? For old times’ sake?”
“Your accent’s not too shabby, either,” said Ron, looking emboldened. “And your…erm…hair is quite nice.”
Harry stopped chasing after him and stood very still. “We never said that.”
“Right. I suppose one day, Charlie Weasley just randomly thought, ‘Hm, I want to track down
“Oi, fuck off, Seamus,” said Ron, shoving a soggy chip into his mouth.
“Then don’t say
“Sorry,” Potter said.
For the first time, Draco seriously considered what would happen if he went home right now and filed for divorce. He was almost positive it would tank the campaign, but maybe it would be worth it.
“What will we do there?” asked Potter. “You said we’d be there for several weeks.”
He went to his study after dinner to finish up work on something, and he heard Astoria and Blaise putting the children to bed, heard them talking in the sitting room afterward. Astoria came in and offered him a glass of wine and asked if he would like to join them.
“Hi Parkinson, you sexy thing,” Tony said, giggling.
thing he wanted.
“Sure,” said Evan. “That works, too.”
“Here,” said Ari, handing him a tissue from a pack in his briefcase.
“Mostly?”
“Harry,” Draco said, in a way that was probably supposed to sound scold-y but came off as breathless.
And he saw, too, how it would be better. Not having to do it all alone, not being the only one to see the things he would see, having Harry by his side.
“I understand. I’ll say I forced my way past you, okay?”
“Seriously, what’s going on? Why are you being so strange?”
“I don’t want to hear it, Potter. Pack a fucking bag and come over. I expect you there for dinner. I’ll even cook.”
He stroked Michael’s cheek and apologized profusely, and mumbled pieces of a prayer he remembered hearing Grandmother Malfoy say when he was small and she came to his room to say goodnight. He couldn’t remember it all, but he remembered a bit. It seemed like a good thing to say now.
yelling. Whatever it was, he could handle it, with grace, even. Hermione deserved that much.
After cooling off in the shade of a thick tree whose branches spread out horizontally like so many sets of open arms, Draco left the group of men who were still eating and dozing, and picked through the rubble, trying to understand what the place might’ve looked like, once upon a time.
Draco sighed. He supposed it would be helpful to talk about it with someone other than Harry or Blaise.
