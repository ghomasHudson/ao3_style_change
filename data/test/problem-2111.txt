"Now, find me a charm to find one of the thriller ones. A film."
He looked over as Draco kicked at the grass, hands in pockets, his standard bored affect in full-force as though it wasn’t him who had started the conversation in the first place.
held behind it.
The sky was an explosion of fiery colours painted by a spectacular sunset when Harry returned to Grimmauld. He'd Apparated from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, Chelsea to Smithfield, Holborn to Whitehall, walking for long stretches in-between until his stomach ached and his calves shook with each coming step.
"Malfoy?"
“See, right now? No. You could be a Dementor at Mardi Gras—”
meant.
"Were you so afraid of having someone Apparate on top of us?" Draco asked, turning the messenger bag strapped across his back around to the front and dug out a hand lotion. He twisted it into his hands, a cover for his continued nervousness.
"Yeah. Sleep now," he kissed the nape of his neck, and within moments of his sigh, he knew Draco to be asleep. Harry held tight and closed his eyes, falling asleep for the first time in weeks with the aid of the touch of the person he loved in his arms.
“If you don’t like it, close your eyes.”
guess that you'd go for the high notes. Ron thought you'd save face, but I," he fished the ten-pound note from the back pocket of his trousers and tossed it on the floor, "I knew you'd give us the dramatic showstopper we didn't deserve."
"I don't want you to hide them from me, Harry," Draco reached out and rubbed his cheek, his thumb scratching over his stubble. "I'm asking you to tell me what you're thinking."
His ribs compressed another inch, the breath nearly knocked out of him.
"Okay. I'm going." He opened the door, but held it ajar, grasping the handle. "I'm sorry that you don't know how much you mean to me. Because you mean the world to me, still."
wasn't nearly enough.
Malfoy sat up briefly, knees under his chin as he peeled his black socks off, bunching them together in a ball. Harry turned away to
"They do them in tablet form now, which you'd know if you'd bought any in the last six months," Pansy continued. When she chanced a look at Harry again, he gave her a small smile.
Draco tapped ash into the ashtray. Long seconds passed, and all he did was swallow and stare at the fucking gloves, not able or willing to look directly at Harry.
"You've got such pretty lips for a slut. You're my favourite slut, aren't you pet?"
Malfoy removed his shoes and stepped back from them. Harry looked away, into the mirror, but Malfoy's eyes found him there anyway, hard grey meeting emerald green. Malfoy didn't look angry. He didn't look much of anything because he'd schooled his features into something of a mask. There was no telling what he felt.
Harry thought absently,
The ancient wooden wireless crackled on to play his favourite station in the corner, a new trick it had learned. Sirius had been the last person to physically touch the dial, leaving it on a Muggle station out of Croydon, specializing in rock and blues standards. Every time a Pink Floyd song came on, Harry smiled and thought about how Muggle rock music had been a backdrop to much of his godfather's rebellious youth (or so he liked to imagine).
"I'm not—" Harry started before he realized that he absolutely had been able to tailspin into a marvellous brood. "Tell me more, then," he said instead, "I'm listening now."
"Listen. Whatever Draco's told you, it's what he thought you could handle at the time. Or it's what
Draco placed a hand to Harry's shoulder, warm and heavy and lovely, and he pushed it off.
Harry shrugged, trying to minimize the statement. "Not often," he lied, thinking of the
"Dra- like a dram, not Dwa- like Dwight.
"Implying, what? That you're not?" His own smile grew at the thought. Draco didn't find it funny, eyebrows furrowed together—confused.
"When will you—"
"And WWN Two, hmm? You strike me as a man who'd be more with the times."
The man’s right hand hasn’t slowed in his wanking in his stretchy trousers throughout the conversation. He shakes his head.
"Er—" Harry stumbled over the correct answer to the question, even as Luna tugged at his hand, her pleas for him to come
"Exactly. Free."
Draco groaned at the ceiling. His voice was abandoning him completely, odd stops and starts that he spoke through even when the sound was little more than breath forced out over vocal cords. Anger gave him an uncanny strength.
Draco scowled at the cherry stem rolling between his fingers. “I’ll admit, it’s not hilarious, but it’s not worth crying over.”
“And I think it ought to be Draco now, don’t you?”
and squinted at the numbers that dissipated into a mist. It was still morning, not yet noon, and he needed ages more sleep. He settled back under the covers and watched the washroom's closed door through the open doorway as he turned the questions he had for Draco over in his mind. To wake from what should have been a dreamless sleep dreaming bad dreams, that wasn't normal, didn't spell anything good. And why had he tried to wake Harry so vociferously, and why had Harry's being asleep scared him? Soon his eyelids fluttered shut for a rest, and before he realized it was a possibility, sleep pulled him back under.
Harry had snapped the workbook shut and delivered it to Draco, accepting the peck to his cheek in distracted thanks. He'd sat with a book Draco had lent him, open to the same page for a half-hour as he crammed that new knowledge into the box. The enormity of that finding alone was more than enough to knock the top off it and drown Harry in every ill-feeling he'd locked away for the past month if he wasn't careful.
Draco giggled when Harry licked where his ribs ended and his waist began. The sound trailed off as he kissed his sternum, and the softness of his stomach when he wasn't flexing. He sighed while Harry lapped at their come, and traced his sides with fingertips that buzzed at the touch.
"You said the words 'obsessed with you' right there, for the record," Malfoy smirked at him, a sea of teeth. "That's all I wanted."
"I went with anybody—remember when I said I couldn't remember everyone? How many? And sometimes when I got really low I did go with wizards, but they were—it was awful. It was—very bad, early on."
"Kestrel."
Draco shrugged, collarbones rising and falling.
"I'll take that as a yes," Draco sighed. Harry couldn’t help but hiss when he prodded a gash; it felt like it cut down to the bone. "Let's get you upstairs so I can clean these up and put you to bed. Here." He stripped from the t-shirt he wore and wrapped a portion of it around Harry's fingers. The cotton smelled like him, was still warm. Harry held the big wadded ball of it up to his nose and inhaled greedily.
He sits when Draco does and takes his pulse while catching his breath.
With that, she was gone.
“Oh, goody,” Draco turned onto his side and fanned his fingers over his eyes. “Did you remember my order?”
"You are Harry Potter. And I'm Draco. No, I'm not Draco, I'm Draco's friend. Because I'm Alex. Turner. I'm Alex Turner, I'm—oh my god, this is so embarrassing," he said, belatedly dropping Harry's hand and replacing the mascara wand in its tube. His eyebrows appeared missing behind a thick coat of make-up, but his eyes were fanned with the thickest, longest eyelashes Harry had ever seen on a human face. He was pretty sure that whatever he'd been planning to do with the mascara would be overkill.
Malfoy managed to scramble back over the toilet, face disappearing under the edge of the rim, and Harry, tactfully, looked away.
"Why can't you just call me Harry?"
"So you remember you're a wizard when you're outside of the kitchen." Malfoy turned to him, his eyes flicking up and down, taking him all in. "Interesting," he added.
"Still no reason for exploding the way I did."
"Draco hasn't been feeling good," Teddy said. Harry straightened up and looked over to Draco, sitting on the floor in leggings and an oversized t-shirt. His pink face and damp skin were signs that he'd only recently gone still.
"Last night was a dream," Harry said. He rolled onto his back, keeping his eyes tightly shut. "The lack of nightmares is as good as for me. If no-one else dies, that's a great night in my books."
Blaise sighed heavily, uncapped his bottle and took a deep swig from it. "Don't be too hard on yourself. We're not sure, but," he took a sliver of ice into his mouth and cracked it with his molars, "it's the best guess. We only know he used to because Moaning Myrtle has a fat mouth. We lived with him for
"I like you small," Draco said, trailing his hand down the back of Harry's head to massage his neck. "It's only fair, with the world already so in love with you otherwise. It would be a crime for you actually to be perfect."
"We are going to the ballet," Harry cut in. "
They say puppies shouldn’t be crated for more than a few hours at a time, but from the way Harry took to his, Draco figures he spent days in one as a pup. The stories at Hogwarts had been too far-fetched to be true, even at age eleven. Harry Potter in a locked cupboard, or in one telling a magical wardrobe—you had to be joking. But the way he curls into a ball to sleep, doesn’t rattle the edges with limbs crooked in awkward directions gives one pause. Perhaps, Draco thinks, there was something to those tall tales.
Hurt and scars were all you got.
He tugged at his hair and made and threw his rumpled sheets a disgusted look.
“Do you intend to wet your entire body? If so, don’t let me stop you.”
Blaise sighed but drew his wand and marked a cross above his clothing where his heart would be.
The reply had taken nearly ten minutes.
Draco raised his eyes to meet Potter's.
but I suppose you’re alright.”
Was it Friday already? Draco bit back a curse.
Harry’s eyes flashed open aware of Draco standing between his legs, one of which was on the bed and the other hanging off the side.
Harry glanced at the sky. There were few clouds but they looked heavy.
"Where's Blaise?" he asked unbuttoning the first two buttons of his shirt.
{HPDM}
“He didn’t lie to me, Hermione. Why else would he want me to…”
He dug his fingers into his palm and forced himself to take deep breaths as they walked back to the house. The look he’d seen on Lupin’s face mere hours ago was the same one Draco had at the petrol station. Harry understood now why he’d refused to linger.
"Relax," Ginny said.
Draco smiled and leaned in to kiss Harry once before pulling back.
“An old family recipe,” Draco said before he could decipher why he was carrying the conversation.
“It’s not perfect but people are fighting for equality and that’s more than the wizarding world can say for itself.”
“I never listen to instructions,” he hissed back even though it made him sound cocky. “You know that.”
“Horrible,” Harry said glancing away from him. “I thought so.”
Vacuums do not exist in nature, he recalled reading somewhere.
“It appears you are in need of a healing draft more than I.”
“I want you to tell me when you next feel the urge to harm yourself.”
“I don’t think I confirmed that you actually know that look.”
He sounded closer than he had been seconds ago.
The words hurt to say, went against his need to know once and for all, but he needed to do this. It wasn’t his place to demand to know words shared in confidence.
“You most of all,” she said then to Blaise, “But you most often.”
“When you fight dementors or dragons or basilisks or Voldemort, you’re fighting for your life. You’re fighting with your wand and you know what each spell can do… how effective it is against your opponent… how effective it is against you. You know your physical limits,” he said.
He licked his lips and raised his cup to take a sip but it was empty.
Harry nodded his thanks all the same.
She shook her head but they were both frustrated, he could feel it
Something in his tone spoke of disappointment even as Harry scrambled for words.
Harry stared at the greyish fur covering the wolf and wondered if he should step closer. He lowered his wand to his side though he did not extinguish the spell, and took a step closer.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry stumbled out of the toilet ten minutes after Draco left. He’d managed to smooth down his hair and the wrinkles in his clothing while waiting. The flush on his cheeks would give him away for certain but he couldn’t do anything about it.
like a Malfoy, not that he was one.
“Short answer or long answer?”
"Really?"
he growled holding out a shaking arm.
But no, Draco needed to hear it. Harry didn’t know what would happen after today but he wanted Draco to know.
He’d made Draco swear he wouldn’t but… this wasn’t recreational. His shoulder did hurt a little and he would take an equivalent dose. Nothing wrong with that.
He could hear the pout form on her face.
“I’m aware.”
He would later discover that all this had nothing to do with his
Dobby nodded but refused to meet his gaze.
Alphard gave Druella a curt nod and strode out of the room. Armand heaved a sigh from the sofa and muttered something the dangers of inbreeding and left.
"No."
“That’s enough,” Harry said setting down his spoon.
Lupin inhaled after a moment of silence. “They died.”
"Right away, mistress," he said before he disappeared with a
"Ten points from Slytherin," Snape declared. "And I expect to see you after the lesson."
“Sorry,” he said knowing the fault had been his and not willing to pick a fight so early in the morning.
Ron rolled over from his stomach onto his side and frowned at him. "Who—George? What's he done now?"
"Why must you terrorize the house-elves so, Potter? Oh—thank you," Draco added, surprised as Harry handed him a drink. He cast his free hand in a gesture Harry didn’t recognize across it, as though pulling a cloth draped across its top free.
"Starting to feel like a cold pile of chopped flobberworms over here already," Harry muttered, engendering snickers from across the table.
"Alright, alright. I want to finish on those ruddy lips of yours."
Malfoy spoke with incredible boredom, and Harry felt a pit open in his stomach. It was similar to Embarrassment, an old friend of his, but could potentially be Sadness or the big winner on any night spent out drinking: Mortifying Self Pity.
"I didn't know, Malfoy, honest." Harry sat back in his chair, biting at a thumbnail. "That explains the bill, though," he added in an undertone. Draco took a deep breath, gearing up for another diatribe, but Harry beat him to it.
"You don't believe me yet when I say I'll never hurt you, pet. But you will. You'll see," Draco whispered. Harry was on the edge of deep sleep already, and the words could have been spoken by a spectre in his dreams. "I'm going to see you happy, so help me, god."
"Please don't, not over me." He edged closer to Draco, wary as one approaching a wounded animal, and finally pressed a kiss to the knobby collarbone protruding at the top of his shoulder. Draco cleared his throat and leaned his head into Harry's chest; a truce, of sorts.
To Harry, it was that, but it was a lot more.
"It's
"Draco,” Harry said, and then he went quiet. He wasn’t sure what to say anyway.
in the movement of his arm.
Draco sat curled into himself. Head bowed, and shoulders caved in, it was the perfect position to take a verbal beating, and Harry was so
"Wait," Harry gasped.
"Nothing to it," Draco said quietly, mouthing the side of Harry's prick. "Stripping. When you do it for me, you can't do it wrong. I love to see you naked; you must know that."
"Would you be left to eat alone, like the smelly kid?"
Harry sighed. "Yes, but it’s happening without us. You’re normally out of bed ages before I am."
"I am happy," Harry said, a little more quietly, in response to her. They'd met at the bird-watching reserve for an afternoon walk, Harry having taken the initiative to set the time, place and date with her rather than let the guilt at not being enough of a part in his godson's life eat away at him until she made plans. The reserve was muddy and grey, but Teddy was in love with every small creature they came across, especially those that oozed.
"Remind me why we're here again?"
That is to say: Harry had started off scowling on purpose, and his mood had shifted to match it.
"Thanks, Harry," she said, charming her hair into an elegant bun, a few tendrils left floating at her temples.
The Healer took his wand and drew a squiggly line of white light with two pronounced humps, like mountains on either side of a deep valley. He drew a line through the first of the two, at the height where one would typically draw in snow. It reminded Harry of the drawings Teddy left littered everywhere he went. All it needed were some fluffy clouds, a house with four-paned windows and a dragon flying up next to the sun.
"It's alright. You're thorny, is all."
Reza shook his head, the look of wonder never leaving his face. "He was. But he was a
, he thought. Draco squished his lips together in a thin line and with a shake of his head walked on, out of sight. He'd been hooked into playing some version of miniaturized Quodpot with Teddy and Victoire, which suddenly seemed like a very appetizing option in comparison to the quagmire of issues talking about the upcoming wedding had so far incurred. Bill's rich laugh mingled with the delighted shrieks of the children after most of the bigger explosion sounds, which Harry took to mean that the match was going well, all around.
, on occasion, because she learned about these clandestine little requests for your location going through within the Ministry. That's her source though, as far as she's concerned, and she's not talking, so—" Ron shrugged, "—we'll see where that goes. So she goes putting things together—your attendance at certain events, and she starts chatting up Tom, and he's nuts at the concept of you seeing
"What about it?"
came to mind, and he breathed deeply, ingesting the thought. It was his current morning mantra, Spell-o-taped to the bathroom mirror. He whispered it aloud in the mornings, though whenever Draco was over, he liked to walk in surreptitiously and say, "A little louder, if you will, Mr. Potter," or "Some enunciation would be of use," his stony face barely concealing the twinkle of mischief in his eyes. He liked pretending to be Harry's diction teacher; Harry was of the mind that he liked playing teacher, period, and was starting to warm up to the idea of throwing on his old Hogwarts tie for some role play.
"By starving you to death?" Draco stopped the massage; his fingers curled into Harry's palm. There wasn't comfort offered in his tone, but incredulity.
or in the negative for
"I don't know what you're trying to pull here, Malfoy, but I'm not falling for it."
, and Draco waves his hand out to push the door shut on his wailing before the brute turns his attention elsewhere. He’s successful and manages a wheezing pull of air before the uncle kneels onto his stomach and the brick of his knuckles connects with the sharp edge of Draco’s cheekbone.
Because he’d been staring. The entire time, he'd been staring; however long that was, he had no earthly clue.
“How long, usually?”
"Christ, you know I hate it when you
"Euphoria's hard to come by organically," she said, passing him the cap. "Get the right synapses firing through a potion or chemistry, and you can manufacture a feeling. Some people don't get the drop after, but you seem to be more sensitive than most." Harry snarled at the implication that he was anything close to sensitive. He may have feelings, but admitting to them was a step too far.
“Do you mean the journal I gave you for Christmas?”
“Don’t hold your breath,” he added, and that got her to finally relax and accept the stretch. The little sounds started, whenever he got knuckle deep. Harry wished he could watch, properly, but the show from the front was truly enough.
"You're all I ever asked for. Do you know that?"
"Why can't you just be
Harry felt as though he must be dreaming. "You're getting off on this."
Malfoy's expression became pinched, little wrinkles lining his nose. "I don't expect pity from you, Potter. But yes, it was."
"Why would I lie to you? About this?"
If he hadn't died, something had crawled inside of him and done just that. Maybe his insides had shrivelled, and his brain and heart hadn't gotten the memo yet.
"I...didn't know this. How does one go about Obliviating a computer?"
“Thank you for the advice,” Draco said, accepting a cup from Harry. “It would be both rude and—"
. But he couldn't make his jaw work to say the words, so he choked on them instead.
"Okay," he said, realizing the gargantuan task before him of convincing the prickliest, most sensitive person he'd ever met to forgive him, believe him, and take him back. "Where do I begin?"
“I can’t, fuck, Draco, please,” Harry grit his teeth, the stirrings of his oncoming orgasm building deep inside him.
Her words carried weight, though she spoke them plainly.
"What's gotten into you?" Draco asked again.
Andromeda nipped enquiries in the bud. Harry returned from the loo at one point and noticed how Draco regarded her, stony-faced and perfectly still. He hadn't moved, really, since he'd spoken in Harry's favour. Harry wasn't sure what it was that was going on behind the facade—did he look at Andromeda and see his mother? Or was he processing what he'd inadvertently stepped into—graduating from the life of a person who spent weekends with his boyfriend's godson, to someone soon to be dating a full-time parent?
Hermione rubbed his back and they sat in silence that was eventually broken by Neville's enormous yawn, setting off a chain reaction of people calling it a night. Eventually, Mrs and Mr Weasley returned—"Molly and Arthur, we don't stand on ceremony," they said, with a set of hugs for Draco—and they were off, back at Grimmauld before they knew it.
"There was Noah," Draco stared, hollow-eyed at the long cylinder of ash, let it fall to the ground. "I was drinking. Am drinking," he looked over to the empty bottle of wine. "There were—others."
Draco took a breath and let go of Harry's hand. He leaned away and scooped up a handful of pebbles, and started to organize them on the space on the log between them. First by colour, into hills of grey and green and black. Something flopped wetly into the lake; it was too dark to make out what, or where. They sat in silence as he arranged the pebbles in lines by size, the littlest ones by Draco's thigh, the largest near Harry's.
“We’ll make him wait but no more than is prudent.”
Draco was in the kitchen making tea when Hedwig swooped in through the open window. Harry nearly jumped at the racket they made. Draco was in the doorway seconds later, fingers dusty with ground cinnamon, eyes searching the room.
How long had it been since they’d taken him? He could feel the drowsiness pushing against him and he knew he wouldn’t be able to resist much longer.
Damned quidditch practice.
They came to a stop a few metres away from Lupin but not close enough for him to hear them.
"Well, the invites for the Halloween Party have been sent out," she said biting her lip. "And I was wondering if you'd changed your mind because it's going to be a blast and this party would be a really good idea for us to help you do... you know. Also, it would be a good idea for-"
"Besides, haven't you been snogging Theo lately?" asked Parvati.
{HPDM}
Harry watched Draco for cues but he only heaved a long-suffering sigh and flung himself into the couch opposite parents. He stretched out his legs and waited.
His streak of honesty hadn't lasted long.
Draco said, “Do you remember what I told you in the prefect’s bath?”
Draco took the book in his hands and thumbed through the blank pages. He looked up at Harry in confusion.
“Perpetuating the name.”
Potter looked worse beside him. His wheezing would only worsen if he didn’t stop. But he flew like he did everything else. With the kind of relentless bravado you would expect from a Gryffindor.
Harry shut his eyes and inhaled.
Draco wanted them to have breakfast in his room. Harry couldn’t agree more, he didn’t want to be around the Malfoys for a few hours at least. Lino appeared a few seconds after Draco’s summons. He gave a short bow and informed them Narcissa had forbidden them from having breakfast in Draco’s room.
Harry grabbed his arse and Draco nipped at his bottom lip hard enough to draw blood. He shivered and Draco’s finger found their way to his belt buckle.
He glanced at the door and Draco shook his head at him.
Harry’s right hand clenched around Draco’s. The needle was large enough than not even his touch was sufficient to put him at ease.
"Finally," he muttered when he spotted the long slender leaves of the asphodel plant peeking from underneath the shadow of an oak tree.
“Yes. Not wait to… be with you,” he said and Harry felt relief fill his lungs. “But wait to tell people, friends. It’s a poor argument but she’s always been good to me.”
Snape looked about to proceed anyway but the sound of the front door drew their attention. Draco took the opportunity to pluck the wand out of Snape’s hands. Snape glared at him but didn’t try to reach for it. A cold fury laced his voice when he spoke.
Harry sighed.
Was he in fourth or fifth year then? Draco was as confused as when the conversation began. A fact Blossom well knew because he was smiling that smile of his. Thankfully, Madam Pomfrey was in his line of sight before he could say anything more.
“Harry,” Dean called from behind him.
Harry shrugged as he scrawled out some more words. "It's nearly done anyway."
Alphard inclined his head. “Apology accepted.”
But he had other ideas.
“Do you want to do it?”
The stumbled to the wall and Draco said, “Do that again,” like he had so many nights ago.
“Fine, I wouldn’t expect you to do that in the manor. Point taken, but
She looked up at him with a mouthful of eggs and toast.
“Armand thinks you should wear his colours,” Alphard said moving to the ajar wardrobe.
he said holding out his cup.
“I don’t clean often.”
Harry could see why.
“You weren’t supposed to arrive for the next five minutes.”
He nodded once.
, he wanted to cry out.
"I- are you headed back to the castle?"
Draco paused then looked up.
McNair swore. “You motherfucking faggot. I’m going to give you–”
“Come on,” he said. “Let’s get clean.”
“That’s not how this works,” Dean said. “We don’t reveal your secret unless you ask us to.”
He suddenly wondered whether everyone was right. Maybe Malfoy wasn't at all involved in the Dark Arts. Maybe he was just sneaking off to brew potions.
Harry didn’t like the thought of leaving Draco behind in this state.
Draco was too shocked to move.
"Harry probably just needed some time away from all your badgering," Hermione said coming to his aid.
They watched her approach alone, in a blaze of barely sheathed anger. Her low voice cut when she spoke and Harry saw every strike chip away at Draco’s defences. Before she could turn to him though, a hand grabbed his elbow and dragged him from the scene.
That night.
“There are things we need to discuss,” Blaise said taking a step closer.
He stepped closer to Draco and stopped a few feet away from him. Close enough to smell his scent. Harry kept his breathing even and watched Draco as he spoke.
"Dead?" asked Ron beside Harry.
Draco's breath caught.
Lupin only nodded. Harry and Draco sat opposite him and watched as he devoured all twelve biscuits and washed them down with two glasses of water in a single breath. Only then did he take a deep breath and reach for the bread and jam. Harry thought he would make quick work of that too but his movements had slowed down.
He jerked awake, cold sweat dampening his clothes and he realised that there was no more sunlight now. He must have fallen asleep. He tried to sit up but his shoulder hurt as though someone had been prodding it. Harry cursed and was about to lie down again when he heard the scuffling of shoes.
"Did you not hear what Dumbledore said about the bond?"
“The entire fucking common room.”
Draco went on. “Do you know how to apparate? Drive? Can you fly a broom in –”
"Have you received word from your son?"
Harry’s mind reeled.
Harry saw the glint in his eye and knew he was flirting. This was how he flirted. The cool demeanour never left, instead, it expanded and contracted like elastic. Harry wondered what it would be like to get caught in it.
Harry reached for him and run his hands through Draco’s silken hair. “Can it wait five minutes?”
Harry shifted again so that his nose now rubbed against Draco’s shoulder. This, he suspected, was so Harry could scent him better an urge Draco was glad to see him give in to. He almost wanted to tip his head back and drink in the sight of his soft features, savour the taste of his lips and the sound of his moans.
At least until Flitwick had him sit at the front of the classroom for falling asleep so much.
He picked the card that lay in the centre.
{HPDM}
"You say that like it's a bad thing," he mumbled.
“You are not of my pack, not since Draco gave you the bite. But you are still mine.”
Like a lighthouse signal.
The endearment in the gesture made Draco weak to his knees. It was something his wolf would do and here Harry was scenting him without knowing.
“Does it still hurt?”
“What’s wrong?”
“Silver and green brocade. He needs to wear his intended’s colours. It sends a message.”
“Will I still be able to…”
Moaning Myrtle was hovering a few feet away from him with a concerned look on her pale features. It would have irked him had he been sober but he was too inebriated to care. She was a ghost, there was little she could do to stop him. Even if she wanted to.
“No,” Harry said.
A short gangly boy of about twelve or thirteen entered the room.
Harry’s fingers grasped the soft sheets, breath hitched, legs parting. Draco slid between them, feeling his arousal against his thigh. He bent low and swirled his tongue on the mark.
The question would have seemed demeaning had there not been a glint of amusement in Draco’s eyes as he asked it. Harry had a feeling he
Blaise didn’t even glance at him.
“This is Haneul?” she demanded. “I thought you didn’t know him!”
“Not even the darkest magic could stop me.”
Harry smiled as he finished his glass of water.
Should he have?
mind?”
“Not really, it won’t work either but I will pay my mother back for ruining my morning mood”
Still, the vial of golden liquid
He smiled and tilted his head to the side as much as he could.
Harry watched with a wary look as he took the scarf in his own hands and turned the soft material over in his pale fingers.
“Can’t do it, can you?”
Harry turned to see that Alphard had risen from the sofa and come to stand beside Draco.
"You did predict her imminent death in fourth year," Harry pointed out.
He smiled.
“Look, I need a favour,”
Dumbledore nodded. "I'm glad you took the time to stop by, there is much to discuss," he said looking at Malfoy now.
This person who lay in silence all night, who moved around silence all day and spoke only when spoken to was not Harry and it ached to watch him go through the motions as though he didn’t care anymore.
Harry opened his mouth to speak but hesitated. Draco knew he wasn’t thinking about the incident in the seventh-floor washrooms, he hadn’t been either, but every time he couldn’t get himself under control, every time the hatred or self-loathing threatened to spill out of him, he did.
"Thanks, Harry." He knocked back the potion with a smile. "Let's get out there."
He enjoyed watching Draco work, it wasn’t a sight he saw often – or one his mind had become accustomed to.
Blaise gave him a particularly thorough once over. "I was trying to finish an essay on Cleansing Potions before you barged in here."
Laughter rung around him but fainter this time.
Hermione’s firm, “I am” was the last thing he heard before he crested the fifth-floor landing and jogged up the sixth-floor staircase.
You couldn't just transfigure music, could you? You could enchant the gramophone to play music but it would have to be music the spell caster had heard before. Draco didn't know the particulars and he didn't feel like thinking about it at the moment.
He hadn't been doing much despite the pile of essays awaiting completion to his left. He’d gotten
“His manners will need some work.”
"Yes. Like that..."
It shouldn't have made him blush. It shouldn't have made him toss and turn in bed. It shouldn't have made him wake up with a hard-on for three days straight despite getting off the night before.
Harry ignored the hands that tried to pull him away, ignored the pain in woke when they tried again and sank to his knees.
“Fuck, just give me a chance with him, I’ll–”
“Would you like it if the favour was returned?” he asked.
Draco sighed.
“Together?”
None of this had anything to do with that.
He was beginning to feel drowsy. He wondered if this was what Dumbledore felt when he’d been close to death that day. Close to death... How close was
“I thought you’d – ”
The werewolf stirred, shifted its position – trapping Harry even more with its paws on either side of him – and yawned into his face.
Harry burrowed deeper into the sheets with a “no.”
"Oh, that's rich. You're up for grabs by my best friend but not me?" he asked with a raised eyebrow.
Harry forced himself not to listen, forced himself to remain where he stood. None of them had made a move to touch him after all and he wouldn’t strike the first blow.
Harry walked to his own and took out his gear.
Harry flinched.
"Would it help if I..?"
Hermione scowled at him, more for his lack of tact than the question.
“For you or me?”
Harry had meant what he said about not knowing but he knew his answer for doing what he thought was right hadn’t satisfied Draco. How could it, if he was already unsure about his perceptions of wrong and right? Do you honour an old man’s last request and let him die or do you fight to save him because some would be devastated by his death?
It was nothing like his usual pace and Harry relished not being teased any longer. He met every thrust, one hand clutching the bedsheets the other tangled in Draco’s hair.
"Morning," he said.
Harry wanted to kick himself.
He remained there and even offered him a half-smile when he noticed his gaze.
As Harry had suspected, they were not late at all. The students had crowded in the corridors because the quidditch pitch was still being prepared for the match. It would be for the next hour from the look of things.
When he didn't move, she frowned.
Not still had a book in his hands but he was watching him over it with something like curiosity and apprehension.
The cherry haired boy threw his head back and laughed. "You've got issues."
Blaise studied him for a minute. "It probably wasn't that important if you forgot," he said but Draco could tell whatever it was had changed something between him and Blaise.
Harry was ready to utter a spell before he realised that he was late for his meeting with Dumbledore.
For a moment Harry watched the thoughts whirring in his head, watched his eyes widen and a single breath slip from his lips. Armand and Alphard had been cast out because there had been others to pin the legacy on. If Draco put his foot down… It would take a lot of manoeuvring from what he knew of the Malfoys but Draco was cunning in his own right.
“Fine then.”
and his right hand tightened on his broom as his body tipped forwards. He was dimly of aware of the crowd yelling in outrage from below but the pain making its way down his spine and left arm was worse.
“No…?”
Harry closed the distance between them.
Draco shook his head and hid his arm behind his back, smearing blood over his pyjamas. "Don't. I need... I need it to... hurt a little more."
Draco’s lips flicked to his lips. Harry titled his head just a fraction upwards. Draco angled his own head to meet his lips. Harry pulled away a second later. Draco followed the motion and Harry let his elbows relax so he lay on his back on the bed.
{HPDM}
Draco smiled but it was far from angelic.
Harry thought back to the one lying in his trunk. He’d only managed a few pages but he wasn’t all that good at writing and most of his sentences were made up of random descriptions or bits of dialogue.
"- and this is one of them."
Draco gripped his knee again, brows lowering.  “What is it? Is something wrong?”
Harry nodded, moving his hand behind his head, sleeve riding up over his bicep. “I hope you’re right.  We both need sleep.  Guess we’ll see how it went in the morning.  Er… later in the morning,” he grinned.
“Pansy’s not my girlfriend.” Malfoy’s nose crinkled, his brow creasing.  He shook his head, like he was trying to get the smell of rancid food from his nose.  “I’m not…”  He shook his head again.  “No,” he said simply.  He pushed the curtains further open and moved back to sit by his pillows, scooting over to leave room. “Let’s just try, okay?  You can always go back to your bed if you find it too unbearable to be this close to me.”
“Pavo huh?” Harry asked the dog in his lap who had begun to fall asleep, head resting on his thigh facing Draco.  “Pavo.  Can I call him Pav?”  Harry leaned his side against Draco feeling the warmth of the fire behind the grate and the steady heat of his boyfriend’s presence.
Malfoy turned to face Harry more fully, grey eyes catching the moonlight and shining.  “Does the fresh air help you with…” He paused, crossing his arms over his chest.  “Does it help you forget what you still see?”  His voice was so quiet, like he was ashamed of telling a secret.
Standing still, chill evening air still washing over him, Harry’s mind raced. Malfoy wanted to share a bed with him?  Did he fancy Harry?  Think about him the way Harry imagined the blonde?  What would happen if Harry took him up on his offer?  Could he restrain himself from touching the blonde?  Running his hand down his arm, feeling the light dusting of fair hair against his fingertips?  He’d certainly get hard in minutes being that close to Malfoy, vulnerable, sleepy, and relaxed.  What if he talked in his sleep?  What if his nightmares turned to fantasies that close to who he’d been desiring?  Maybe he could play it off as moans of pain, moaning Malfoy’s name because he was seeing him tortured?
Harry took a moment to decide how to answer that.  Then, Gryffindor that he is, decided direct and honest was a better approach than dismissive or sarcastic.  All in or all out was his standard approach to life after all.  His nose gently bumping against the base of Draco’s neck, he said, “I know a lot of little things about you.  How you take your tea, your favorite meal the Hogwarts elves serve, the flavor of chocolate you eat first from the packages your mother sends you.  I know you used to use countless hair products but are letting it go more natural this year, I can only assume to distance yourself from your father’s image.  That as good as you look in your fancy dress robes, you’re always more excited about a brand new pair of socks.”  He paused, noticing the wave of pink working its way up Draco’s neck.  “Honestly,” he paused again, the tip of his nose lightly trailing up Draco’s pale neck and resting again just below his hair line, right hand cautiously moving up the bed and resting over Draco’s rapidly beating heart, “it’s the big stuff, stories about your childhood, how you’re adapting post-war, your first kiss, favorite family tradition, things like that I would like to learn more about.”  Harry squeezed Draco gently, legs pulling up to fully surround him.  “I think I’d really like to know that Draco.”
Harry pulled back and looked back down at Pav, softly petting his ears, which he would grow into, Harry was sure.  He looked back over at Draco and pulled him into another kiss, easily expressing his joy and love.  “He’s beautiful, Draco.”  Green eyes sparking, Harry looked between the two of them, his partner and his new partner in crime.  “We’ve got our own little family now.”
Harry blinked a few times, a small shake of his head and turned to look out at the sky.   That seemed to be happening more and more recently the longer he spent around Malfoy.  He’d find his mind wandering in History or Magic or Potions, easy to do, and his eyes would trail the movement of Malfoy’s fingers as they precisely diced a flower stem or twirled his eagle owl quill.  What would those hands feel like spread across his back, fingers running down the ridge of his spine?
“I wonder if he’ll come up with any good names for you.”  The puppy’s brows quirked up at Draco as if doubting Harry’s naming abilities.  “No, you’re probably right.  He’ll likely want to call you something like Red or Albus.  He used to have red hair in his younger years, I believe.  He’s very literal, our Harry.  No, you deserve something more dignified than that.  How about a celestial name like my family, hmm?”  He rested his head back on Draco’s chest and licked at his chin.  “Yes, I knew you looked more reasonable than your littermates.  Maybe after a constellation then, like the Blacks.”  He stroked the dog’s fur, feeling his breath against his belly and chest.  “A lot of the names are long and would definitely require a nickname.  How about one that is already shorter?”  He got a lick for that too.  “We could go with a play on the old Malfoy pets and name you after the peacock constellation.  How about Pavo?  Also sounds a lot like Pavlov, which, you know, dog related.”  The red-furred pup nuzzled in closer, paws on either side of Draco’s neck and nose snuffling at his ear.  “I’ll take that as a vote in the affirmative.  Pavo?  Do you like that, Pavo?”  The dog rubbed his face against Draco’s getting some fur in his mouth.
Grey eyes flashed at the challenge, as they always did when Harry was on the other side of it.  His hand tightened on Harry’s neck, pulling him so close their bodies pressed together at every point.  Draco smirked, breathe mingling with Harry’s.  “I’ll put him to shame.”  He swiftly closed his eyes and closed the remaining distance between their lips.
Draco moved closer, enough so Harry could feel the low heat coming off of his crossed arms.  He shifted from one foot to the other and back again, shoulders tightening. “Listen, I’m only going to offer this because it worked for me and we both, clearly, need some help to get through the night.”
“Absolutely not.”  Draco snatched his hand away and crossed his arms.  “No child of mine will be called Pavvers.  Sounds like Scabbers and I will not tarnish him like that.”  Harry smiled at him and leaned forward to cover his lips with his own, smiling through the kiss.
His nose incessantly itched.  Harry brought his hand up to rub his nose for what must have been the sixth time that morning, still half asleep.  He paused, hand against his face, and finally noticed the cause of the irritation.  Hair.  Hair that wasn’t his.    He cracked his eyes open, noticed the muted sunlight that glowed at the edge of the bed curtains.  It was Saturday morning and he was in Draco Malfoy’s bed.  Not only that, but he had at some point completely wrapped the blonde up in his arms, his left under Draco’s head, his right hovering at his face still.  Their legs as well intertwined, warm and relaxed.
“Well, I won’t say I can offer you the same level of comfort and familiarity as your girlfriend was able to provide, but I think you’d feel safe with me.  I mean, my track record is pretty good.”  He stepped closer to the bed and shrugged.  “And I do trust you not to hurt me in my sleep.  You’ve had opportunity to do so over the last two months if that’s really what you wanted to do.  And I know it’s not.  You’re very different than you were be-“
No, a golden retriever was perfect.  He was high energy to help prepare them for raising children, incredibly friendly and loyal, and had such a sweet face.  Draco would have company during the day between potions orders while Harry was training at Hogwarts to take over the DADA position and later when Harry was there during longer periods after assuming the role full-time.  After being with Harry for two years, Draco would miss the frequent affection.  The puppy was a cuddly substitute.
Stroking Pav’s ear, Harry said softly, “Pav.  Pavvers.  Pavington the First.”
Glancing at the warm sunlight trying to break through the edges of the bed curtain, Harry grinned.  “Yea, I don’t think it’s that early actually.  You’re normally showered and out of the dorm by now.”  He allowed his right arm to rest over the slight dip at Draco’s hip, assuming that’s where it was before he’d scratched at his nose.
Tonight was just another in a long line for Harry, nearing 2 AM and he’d been awake behind his curtains for at least 25 minutes, muscles in his strong biceps still twitching with the memory of fighting a relentless, fierce grip.  Physical exercise was something he’d explored as a cure for his demons shortly after the war, jogging (sometimes sprinting) around the pond at the Burrow, quiet push-ups on the floor beside Ron’s bed, tossing gnomes for hours in the garden, chasing Teddy around Grimmauld Place while Andy laughed, doing anything the muggle way just in the hopes that he’d be tired enough to sleep that night.  It usually had no effect.
Harry sighed softly and tightened his grip in Draco’s hair, changing the angle of their kiss.  He moved his leg between Draco’s when the blonde skated his tongue across Harry’s lips.  With a quiet moan from Draco, Harry parted his lips and welcomed him with a quick nip to his lower lip.  Hands roamed, discovering spots worth revisiting.
“He’s perfect and he deserves the best life has to offer.  And if you tell me he can’t cuddle with us on the bed I will make you sleep on the couch.”  Harry put his hands up in front of him, tilting his head and giving a little shrug.  “That’s right.”  Draco gave a swift nod and turned back to their puppy.  “What do you think of the name Pavo?”
Harry came over to the pair and sat cross-legged on the floor.  Pavo immediately abandoned the rope toy and started sniffing his shoes and pant leg.  Harry quirked an eye brow at Draco and started petting the pup’s back.  “What does Pavo mean?  I’ve never heard that name before.”  Harry grinned and picked up the dog who immediately began licking his face with no restraint.  Giggling and sputtering, Harry put Pavo in his lap, stroking his fur and smiling over at Draco.
“Yea,” Malfoy rolled away onto his side.  “Just don’t hog the covers or I’m kicking you out.” Harry snorted, turned on his side towards Malfoy now that the blonde wouldn’t see his eyes wander down the slight curve of his body or any dreamy far-off looks Harry may have on his face.
“Does what help what,”  Harry’s voice still holding a bit of gruff from his likely dream-induced screaming.
Fingers buried in the pup’s fur, Draco resolved to be straight forward with the surprise.  He had worked hard over the years and earlier in his relationship with Harry in being forthright with his thoughts and honest with his emotions.  They had grown much closer and torn down many barriers once Draco learned he could trust Harry not to use Draco’s honestly against him.  It took a long time to reverse the ingrained Slytherin and Malfoy lessons that taught him that barring his soul to someone, trusting them with his true self, was not a weakness.  It showed strength of character to trust someone with his authentic beliefs and feelings.
Harry’s face was warm.  Heat was racing through his whole body, tingling spasms waking him up from the outside in and back again.  He moved his hand up Draco’s back, fingers moving to slid into the soft hair at the base of his neck. “Even better than a dream, Draco.  At least I hope so.  The day dream version of you is really good at snogging though.  So I’m not sure if you can live up to that or not.”  Harry grinned, gaze dropping to Draco’s lips.
Of course, that also meant that he had to be strong enough to grow. He had to accept when he was wrong and be willing to adjust to his new world.  Thankfully, he’d found his way to Harry, who now lived up to the moniker of Saint Potter not only by his innate desire to do what was right but also by the patience he had, and still has, toward Draco.  It took the patience of a saint to pry Draco’s doors open and build a life with him.  Honestly, it probably was only Harry who had the capacity of patience, goodness, and love that it took to help Draco become who he was today.
Harry frowned, moving onto the bed and closing the curtains behind him.  “Sorry I assumed about Pansy.  Like I was saying, you’re very different than you were.  I guess living through a war and seeing, doing everything we did will do that to a person.  Thank you for offering.” He moved under the covers, opting to lay on his back so Malfoy’s high cheek bones and flowing hair weren’t in direct line of sight.
“Good night, Malfoy.”
Harry pulled back only to drop to Draco’s neck, needing to feel his lips against the corded muscles there.  A gasp from Draco encouraged Harry as he nipped and sucked down the pale skin.  Draco wrapped his leg up higher around Harry’s hip and pulled him in, grinding against him.  “Better than a dream, right” Harry whispered breathlessly against Draco’s ear before kissing below it, moving back to his lips.
“I can practically hear your brain short circuiting.  Relax, Harry.”  Draco shifted, bringing the blanket further up his shoulder, eyes still closed.  Harry’s heartbeat picked up the pace at Draco’s rough, sleepy voice.  He could really get used to hearing that.
How was Draco supposed to convince Harry that the surprise purchase of a golden retriever puppy was a good next step for their relationship when the rascal had already peed on the living room rug and chewed on Harry’s dress shoes he’d left by the fireplace last night?  Thankfully magic made quick work of mending both blunders, but Draco would have to hide any doubt or frustration by the time Harry got home from Hogwarts in 20 minutes or so if he hoped to win Harry over.  During their nearly two year relationship, they had discussed pets a few times.  Marjorie’s bulldog, Ripper, and her spoiling of him while Harry was talked about like a delinquent and fed fewer scraps than the dog had left Harry less than enchanted with that breed.  They were out of the question.  Because of Sirius, his eyes tended to light up then shoulders slump anytime they saw a black shaggy dog when out on walks at the park.  There were already too many emotions tied up in him to try to make new memories with a similar dog of their own.
Closing the window, Harry decided he would likely never get another chance to be close to the blonde.  If sharing a bed, no matter how platonic and for mutual, non-sexual gain, was the closest he would ever get to Malfoy, he was going to take it.  Harry walked slowly over to Malfoy’s curtained bed.  Now he just had to convince Malfoy that this was still a good idea.
His eyes slid to Malfoy’s bed as he heard a rustle.  Just as Harry stood, cracking the window in the hopes that the chilled air would chase away the last few images of his nightmare, Malfoy’s bed curtains parted as well, the blonde pausing on his knees at the edge of his bed.  Even after two months Harry was still not used to seeing Malfoy in such a personal setting.  His hair was tousled, damp with sweat at the nape of his neck, revealing a few waves.  He’d been wearing it differently this year, shorter on the sides, growing longer and usually swept to the side, longest tips trailing just below his ear.  It looked like it would be perfect for sliding his fingers through, holding on with a strong grip.
“You’ll have him spoiled before his first birthday” Harry’s deep, warm voice said from the doorway to the entry way.  He leaned against the doorframe, arms and legs crossed.   Draco could tell he was attempting to look cross, eye brows lowered and mouth thin, but Draco could see that spark of affection in his eyes and the twitch at the corner of his mouth that told him there would be no argument, no complaints over the new additions to their lives.
“If I have to accept nicknames for you to go with it then fine, you can call him Pav.”  Draco kissed Harry’s temple and looked down at their puppy.
“I mean, I’ll be the one mainly taking care of you since Harry is away at Hogwarts so much, so, really, did I need his permission?”  Draco was reclined on the couch in front of the fireplace, puppy on his chest and flopping his ears back and forth.  “Should I hide you?  Would you keep quiet long enough for a surprise?”  The pup nipped at his chin.  “No, I didn’t think so.  Too feisty for that.”  He ran his hands down the golden back, ruffling the almost red fur.  “Maybe your resemblance to the Weasley family will win him over quickly or at least make quick work of the shock.”  The puppy huffed and rested his head down Draco’s chest, warm breath puffing at the man’s chin.  “My apologies.  They’ve grown on me over the years, but I wouldn’t want to be compared to one either.  Not in physical appearance anyway.”
“Does it help,” Malfoy asked quietly, coming over to stand at the other side of the window, stripped pajama top shifted slightly to the right, showing more collar bone than he probably intended.
Malfoy’s gaze dropped to the floor, out the window, to Harry’s shoulder, and at Harry’s bed before meeting his again.  Voice low and barely above a whisper, he said “sleep next to me.”
Harry’s smile sparkled, seeming brighter as he laughed and pulled Draco to him again, meeting his lips several times in quick succession.  “I love you too, Draco Malfoy.  I can’t imagine a better life than the one I have with you.  Though throwing a puppy in the mix will make things interesting, it’s perfect.  He’s perfect.  You’re… perfect.”  Harry laughed again, shrugging.  “There is one big question though.”  Harry frowned.
Malfoy’s curtains parted revealing his guarded pale face.  “I only offered because over the summer while I was staying with Pansy, she’d sleep next to me and it was comforting knowing that someone was there, someone could watch my back.  Even though she was sleeping as well, I felt safer.  Maybe this won’t work, you know, with everything that has happened between us.  I’m not sure you could feel safe that close to me and unguarded.”  He looked down, his expression dejected, like he yearned for that openness with Harry but knew they would never reach that level in their relationship.
“For Salazar’s sake.  You’re in my bed.  I’d think you could probably call me Draco now, yea?”
Six months after the Second Wizarding War had ended and two months into Harry Potter’s newly created 8th year, he had hoped to be sleeping peacefully, no blood purist lunatic out for his head.  That, however, is not how things work out when you’ve been hunted since birth, survived multiple near death experiences, and been a media magnet for every low and every (few as they may be) high point through your short life.  Sleep did not come easily for Harry.  Nightmares ripped through his mind nearly every night.  He’d wake trembling and sweating.
Malfoy’s cheeks flushed a deep pink as he spun around, already halfway back to his bed before Harry could finish his thought.  “Never mind,” Malfoy said, curtains snapping back together, hiding him from view.
“Yea, well.  I guess you’re quite a bit different than I thought you were too.  Not nearly as conceited and self-obsessed.  Though don’t think I didn’t notice you bring up your ‘track record’ to convince me you could keep me safe.  To be fair though, you’re not wrong.”  He paused, breathing softly.  “Thank you for being willing to try this.”
He at least could be grateful that Mrs. Weasley, under eyes forever shadowed and smile strained, had sat next to him on the tweed print couch in the Burrow’s living room one indecently early morning after neither had slept more than about 3 hours and gently guided him through the wand movements needed for a strong noise canceling shield charm he could apply around his bed every night.  He was sure every member of his unofficial adoptive family who was still living at home was sleeping better after that night, him and Molly excluded.  He had yet to find a cure for the darkness that seeped through his dreams, but at least he would not disturb them, or his new roommate, anymore.
“Pavo is the peacock constellation.  I figured we could follow the Black tradition of choosing names from astrological bodies and hint at the Malfoy peacocks that roamed the grounds most of my childhood.  Just enough of the past to bring into the future.”  Draco rested his hand on Harry’s knee and gently squeezed.
Luna looked poised to say something, a rare frown on her face. She sighed instead and capped the tincture bottle, dropping it into a knit bag clanking with what sounded like a dozen other glass vessels.
"By the time I got my wand back from you, I was so depressed that I could barely summon my clothes in the morning."
When Harry was finished, he didn’t know where to go until Malfoy cleared his throat.
you know that."
naked, thriving, eating little biscuits out of your palm, and you're trying to bargain with me? He's the saviour of fucking wizardkind, and he's snogging the crown prince of Slytherin." She crossed her arms, looking very proud of herself. "Now it's bar mitzvah's as well."
. Pet, do you have any clue how many people across Europe are going to wank to those photos of you
"It wasn't your cologne that I found interesting last night," he said quietly. "Let's leave it at that, shall we?"
"This is, it's—" Harry shook his head in wonder. "Wow."
"I will. We will."
will suffice—"
"Yes," Harry said. Draco licked his lips, shifted up in the bed, bringing Harry a few inches lower against his body.
"I'm not," Malfoy said, at last, the sneer gone from his voice, "drunk, that is. Or making fun."
Malfoy looked up at Harry.
Ron finished his breakfast before getting up from the table. "See you," he called to Hermione.
Harry groaned.
He yawned and was about to snooze for a few minutes when he realised something.
"Everything alright here?"
"Here," he heard.
He’d done the same thing this time because he wore only his shirt and trousers when he stepped into the room. His eyes roamed over Harry – naked beneath the foam and very aware of it – before scenting the air.
“And if she orders you to punish yourself, I revoke her orders. You are not to punish yourself at her command for this. I also revoke any order to revoke the order I have just made.”
Harry was about to say as much when he felt a stab of pain in his forehead. He barely had time to contemplate it as Lee's voice faded out and the other players began to mount their brooms.
It wasn’t the reaction Harry had been expecting and it hang heavy between them. Harry felt he was missing something.
But hadn’t he been benched for the entire season because of his spat with Stone?
"Uh... I'll join you in a minute," he said pausing at the doors of the Great Hall. "I have to go to the loo."
He swallowed and his moment of hesitation cost him. A flash of light filled the night and Draco swore as he ducked beneath it. He wouldn’t outpace Lupin for long, and he didn’t. The third spell caught him straight in the chest.
"Lemon drop?" asked Dumbledore.
“To talk.”
“Sorry. I got carried away.”
Everyone's gaze was trained at the Slytherin table when Malfoy yelled, "Shut up!" He got to his feet shakily. "Shut up," he repeated and there was so much fear in his voice, so much loneliness, so much regret that Harry wanted to reach out. Wanted to do something so he wouldn't have to hear so much suffering again.
Harry flashed him a look and Draco offered a conciliatory smile. There would be time to explain later.
"Only because I had to drag you to the library to help me research," she said pushing aside her plate and leaving the Great Hall as well.
“Whatever we want.”
He would see Draco soon.
“It appears not.”
He bent low and pressed his lips against Draco’s, the chuckle that had begun to bubble there was as sweet and sultry but nothing compared to his finger sliding into Draco. There was no discomfort and little resistance. Draco let out a soft sigh as Harry slid his finger deeper. He wiggled it around experimentally.
“You’re wondering why he does as he pleases. The signet ring as well, I suppose.”
He had learned that the only way to beat someone like Snape was to have them believe you to be nothing but an insolent fool.
He would make sure of that.
curious. He stepped into the shadows and felt Draco breath easier, the sensation rippled through him and took a deep breath to steady himself.
and their various applications. He rubbed his eyes. "Honestly, Hermione, the library's practically empty. What harm could an hour in the sun do?"
She rose as well.
“Get back,” Malfoy finished for him.
Hufflepuff was particularly formidable on the pitch and he didn't intend to go into the match unprepared. All he needed to do was give Gryffindor another victory and they would leave him alone for a little longer.
A moment’s silence
Draco immediately began to crawl away but Blaise was the only uninjured one in the room and all it took was a firm grip on his shirt. It tore but Blaise kept his hold.
That was odd.
“I know this isn’t how you wanted to do it but you can’t change it. It’s done and they’re going to talk and laugh and gossip but I’m willing to help you, to stand by you, if you want to make it yours.”
“Half-past four o’clock,” Harry said.
“Do you want to see the tapestry or not?”
to lock it and another spell Harry didn’t recognise on top of that. Finally, he cast a
Draco’s smile was tight. "Of course."
What had Dumbledore said? Harry tried to remember. It had been something about Draco borrowing books from the library, a bond being initiated... yes, that was it. A bond had been initiated which would have to be completed. Something about not being able to ignore the bond too…
He urged his broom upwards all the same. Malfoy didn’t relent and neither would he.
He turned back to Harry and waited only until he’d drunk half his cup of tea before yanking him from the table. They raced out of the Great Hall. Harry tried to protest. They weren’t late for the match after all. But he had no chance do so. Chatting Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs lined the corridors when they rounded the corner.
Snape's voice stopped mid-sentenced and Harry felt the moment when all the eyes in the room focused on him. It felt too much like the Great Hall, too stifling. He tried to continue towards the door but Snape spoke.
"Just fucking admit it," Draco hissed. "You were there that night-"
It had nothing to do with fear or his past – hedonistic though the latter was. It sounded like rubbish to him which was why he'd never told anyone but the feeling was persistent regardless.
But Harry was already pointing his wand at Pansy Parkinson, daring her to complete that statement. The dark-haired Slytherin bit her tongue but the glare she sent him told Harry this was far from over.
Ron’s sound of irritation was enough to rouse the entire castle.
Malfoy pushed Zabini away and stepped up to Harry. With no preamble whatsoever, he pressed his lips onto his in a searing kiss. Harry stood frozen in shock and before he could think to do anything Malfoy had pulled away.
Harry nodded.
They were the only words he had and he found it hurt to say them.
Draco shrugged. “The same reason I tolerate my father, speak out of turn and still eat meals with him. Family is precious. Sometimes you don’t strike gold but sometimes you don’t strike at all.”
"Did you hear what I said?"
It was a bad thought, to want to push his friends away, but his head was pounding and it hurt to speak. He just wanted a drink of water. He wanted to sit down and rest. He wanted an end to all the questions and the whispers.
Harry frowned in confusion for a moment before he remembered the running lie and winced.
Nothing a simple spell wouldn’t fix.
“Do you love him?”
This wasn’t any different.
"Does she know what could happen there?" Ron continued clearly shocked that Ginny had agreed to go, with a Slytherin above all else.
What if it was something he didn’t want to hear?
would do if it came to that.
Harry’s realisation that Malfoy's wolf form was nothing like that of Lupin which he had seen in third year was belated and he wondered about it. Did all werewolves not look the same? Did it have something to do with the potion that Malfoy had drunk?
Draco barely looked up.
“Let’s get on with it then,” Severus said with a tightness to his voice.
Point.
“Your preferences,” he said, a twinge of nervousness running through him.
The darned thing didn't allow for much movement and to no one’s surprise but Harry’s, Draco had picked one out for him long before he’d agreed to visit the Manor. Harry chanced a glance at the dance floor eyes seeking his familiar steely ones. He thought he saw a flash of gold, a wolf but it wasn’t Draco.
There was trouble in their little Golden Paradise and Draco should have been pleased because Harry deserved it and so much worse but there was nothing. He got no pleasure from it and that alone sickened him. Was he changing? Why was he changing? And why hadn't Pansy and Blaise come to see him too? Oh yeah, he and Blaise were back to not speaking and Pansy probably wanted to stay on the fence.
Draco quirked an eyebrow unable to help himself. “Still? Was I that good?”
Potter’s stare remained intact.
There was a figure tangled in the sheets and Draco realised he knew this room.
Malfoy watched him in silence.
Blaise held up his hands in surrender. "Alright, alright. You’re so touchy today," he mumbled.
All those years spent despising him… It was all well and good to pay the price for such a lifestyle, money could buy a lot clearly, but it was often what it cost that stung most. Looking at Draco, at the life he must have lived here, he knew that it was a cost he had paid for his parents’ ambition.
{HPDM}
The entire thing seemed designed for him to remember enough nothing more than the fact that something had been said.
“Did you hear that through the grapevine?”
His movements were becoming sloppy but he was still hard even as he thrust wildly into his hand, sighing and whimpering.
“It’s perfectly normal to be attracted to both men and women.”
He could practically see Draco’s raised brow. “A thing.”
"I didn't think you'd come,” Malfoy said seeming to materialise from the shadows.
A step closer.
When he took off his jacket a moment later, Harry told himself he wasn’t spying even as the hiss of surprise left his lips. He had a thin cotton vest underneath it and Harry saw his muscles flex as he moved.
Malfoy let out a frustrated groan and tugged hard at his hair.
Slowly, the sounds of eating began to fill the Great Hall and Harry, who had not eaten anything since breakfast, was beginning to feel hungry. He served himself some roast pork.
“Nephew.”
“You know how to – ”
The first not so much.
“But I don’t and I never will. Don’t pull a card you don’t intend to play. You taught me that.”
"What?" snapped Harry unable to deal with the other boy's scrutiny.
“I want you to mark me,” he said. “Again and again.”
Draco turned away, face red.
“That doesn’t make any sense.”
Harry felt a little self-conscious but when he looked around him, he realised that most people were either high or drunk. No one was looking at him. He may as well have fun.
Draco’s eyes searched his, and though Harry was unable to tell what he was feeling without the bond, the thought of reaching for it again made him shiver.
But even before he saw the expression on Dean’s face, even before he shook his head, Harry knew it wasn’t true and a part of him wanted to turn around and leave. Nobody would stop him and what was the point anyway?
“Lavender?”
“He did.”
Harry forced himself to take a step back when his lungs began to burn.
He did.
He forced himself to take a deep breath grateful the mask didn’t cover his mouth.
"No one."
Was this what love felt like?
Draco brought their faces together like he had in the care but he didn’t kiss him.
Zabini’s grin was smooth across his face. He raised his cup to his lips and took a long sip, eyes never leaving Harry's as he did. His pupils were blown wide and Harry had a feeling he'd maybe had some of that
She stood and hugged Draco again. "Write to me, alright Draco?"
“I mean…” Harry started to say wary of offending him.
Harry didn’t know why he did it but when he got into the car he went to the very back and settled into the seat with a sigh of relief. Draco followed and didn’t appear to think Harry's choice of position out of the ordinary. Harry allowed himself to relax even more.
"So why did you kiss him?"
Draco had wanted to hold his hand for the sake of it.
If Harry got himself into danger after everything the Order had done to protect him...
He could feel the tension radiating off Draco but stood his ground.
Harry wanted to focus, he wanted to be in the present moment, he wanted to be easy with his friends who had woken up early on a Sunday just to see him but he couldn't stop his mind from going back to the conversation he'd had with Malfoy merely five hours ago.
“The stables?” His smile felt more forced and not.
Given that the statement was said to Nott, Harry knew there was only one ‘he’ they could be referring to.
And he had breathed.
“Better than me but he always said there were places Nott went that he couldn’t.”
Harry couldn’t hold in his laughter this time. “I was just going to ask about your magic words.”
"You're late."
“And if I want the East Wing?”
"He didn't get you again did he because I tell you that slimy git needs to be brought down a peg or two and I'd be happy to do it too," said Ron dropping his fork and rolling up his sleeves.
Draco recognised the question in the statement.
“Harry, may I have a word with you?” he finally asked. “It
Blaise’s face remained neutral.
After all these years of keeping it together, how many times had he passed out in the washrooms? How many times had he stood before Dumbledore or his family or Severus and come out alright?
“I understand that what you’re feeling now. You shouldn’t have to be away from your… from Draco so soon after mating but –”
“Just tell me why you came back.”
Draco smiled the smile that let Harry know he’d caught him in his own net just this once.
Draco started to get up.
“Clinging?”
"Okay. We'll stick to the standard formation today. Everyone in the air."
He stepped closer as if to kiss him.
He landed on his bottom with a loud grunt. The cloak was wrenched from around him and tangled around his legs revealing his cursing form to a slightly amused Draco Malfoy.
Harry glared.
"Is your arm still..."
“The land the manor sits on is English soil so naturally the government has an interest. Something about historical monuments.”
The bond that linked them hid nothing from Draco but it hid nothing from Harry either. He felt the emotions flow through them. An exchange fuelled by their mutual attraction and so much more.
There was no response but Draco’s breathing was too shallow for him to be asleep.
McNair bent to his level, his leg still too weak to kneel or crouch. Would it heal if they got into another scuffle? Draco doubted it, he looked to be in a great deal of pain all things considered.
But Draco lifted him off him and pushed him back onto the bed. Harry had never felt the need to come so strongly but the look in Draco’s eyes and the tingle of the mark told him to wait.
The shift in conversation was unexpected but not unlike Draco. Harry knew some part of him was still trying to come to grips with everything that had happened over the past few weeks. His family would be on his neck too and he worried about Harry more than he let on, that he knew.
Draco hadn’t opened his own letters, Harry noted.
Draco met his gaze and the look… Merlin, the look…
Draco took a deep breath. “I apologise. My fight is not with you.”
“Take care of him, Harry. Take care of each other. A world without love is not worth living in.”
“Look!” McNair cried spreading his arms. “Knight in shining armour? Do you expect us to spread our legs for you too?”
It was an empty threat, they both knew his claws alone would not be enough. What Blaise lacked in technique he made up for in speed.
Harry nearly spat out his tea. “What?”
Harry sipped his tea and waited for an answer.
She frowned at him.
“You never shut off the bond, you hear me?
The other reason had been his dislike for cramped and foul-smelling places. He wasn’t the only one who used the washroom after all.
“Maybe if you stopped wallowing in self-pity–”
“First time?”
“I should think so. That’s how favours work.”
What was really going on here?
Not at all.
“Hmm?”
“Purpose?”
“I will if you will,” Harry said.
It was always the same thing.
Harry shoved at him but it was a weak move. Draco hauled him over to the nearest bed.
Draco eyes slipped to Snape and there was a brief exchange between them, so brief that McNair was still waiting for Snape to speak when Draco had his eyes back on him.
Harry titled his head to the side, lips quirked. “Thank you.”
Draco frowned.
"Don't call me that," he snapped bunching the invisibility cloak tighter in his hands. "And what's gotten into you?" he demanded.
“Yes, that,” he said keeping his voice as silent as Harry’s.
“I’ve done many things that seemed right at the time and most of those decisions will haunt me for years but you’re not going to be a memory to me, Draco. Do you understand?”
"It was merely a rumour," said a voice.
But this wasn’t something he wanted to think about now. He didn’t want to be having dreams of Potter every night.
- underage drinking
“Harry I swear to Merlin...”
Harry could see a crowd gathering around the periphery but he only had eyes for the dark-haired Slytherin on the other side of his wand. He smiled but there was hesitation in his eyes too.
Unlike himself and Hermione, the two of them looked at each other awkwardly when they realised they had spoken at the same time but Harry was not in the mood for it this morning so he forced himself to continue.
“I already said it wouldn’t happen again.”
"No, Pansy."
He’d never felt in danger but he didn’t know if it would mean anything to the Order.
The first set of footsteps he recognised as Blaise’s and the other, heavier one could only be McNair but he wouldn’t be surprised if it was Warrington. Even his nose muddled scents now and would be of no use to him, whatever they’d given him had dulled his senses to uselessness.
“I’ll let Father know,” he calls back. Lucius must be lurking about his study at this hour.
"If you care for him, it's because he's shown you that he's a good person."
"It's not something to overcome, pet," he whispered, "it's a letting go."
"I'll have to burn that pillowcase—it's MAC, it'll never come out." He gave the pillowcase a private smile, remembering something sweet. "Don't worry, I cleaned you up last night too. You looked like you'd been mauled by a horny clown." He shared his smile with Harry, covering the fingers on the lipstick stain with his own; warm, always so warm. "I cast a couple other spells on you too, just so you're aware. Calming. Healing. You might feel a bit groggy for a while, and dry-mouth is common. Nothing a juice with breakfast won't solve."
"Oh, come on now, Harry—"
"I don't work for them anymore. They can't pull my strings like they used to."
"Course I'm right. I know it's hard when someone you care about is..." he trailed off. Harry could tell he was staring at him. "Well, you know, being your friend has made me something of an old hat when it comes to waiting in hospital wings. The sooner we leave, the sooner we'll be back. Come on."
"You're not making any sense," Harry said. He holstered his wand up his sleeve, available at a moment's notice. Justin wasn't a threat, not a real one, anyway. He wasn't delicate, but he wasn't here to fight. That much was clear.
"I don't get to cry," he said. How was it Draco didn't understand this? "I'm here, aren't I? I made it."
Harry thought about it. Penny House, his school and home for magical youth in need of stable housing and care, opened Monday. He smiled, remembering testing names on Draco.
“How much of my hair could you have gotten?” It was a rhetorical question.
Draco's voice, so suddenly at his ear was what made Harry realize that his shoulders were bunched up as though magnetized to his earlobes. He dropped them, accepted the hug from the back Draco bestowed on him, glad to hear his assembled friends amusing themselves across the room as he took a stabilizing moment to breathe.
"Let me guess," Harry said before swallowing a spoonful that looked Neapolitan and tasted like mint and apricot and almond, took his time before responding. "You owe Hermione because even though you guessed that I'd end up going home with him," he said, pointing the spoon at him, "
Harry's stomach dropped. "I thought I'd killed you."
“When was this?” he asked.
"I had nothing to do with it," he said. "It's these two you should be raking over the coals."
"You know you should avoid him if you can," Ron said. He pinned Harry with a stare and then shook it off. "Nothing good comes of you and Malfoy spending time together; that much I know is true."
Harry was already thinking of what he’d have to do to purge this feeling, worse even than when he’d played host to the evilest thing in the world. A sense that he wasn’t dirtied by the outside world but somehow contained it in himself—that he was the dark, pitiful thing—a stain that needed to be bleached away.
Harry could feel a hot prickle at the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the alcohol. Before he could say anything, Hermione came back to herself, nodding and humming thoughtfully.
"I'll say I misplaced it and get another. Don't worry about it." Harry began to itch under Draco's questioning. He watched as he flipped a page, skimming its contents. "What?"
Harry broke first, moving to stand, "I can go—"
like, that's good,
"How are you so smart?" Harry asked, nearly asleep now. Draco huffed a laugh as Harry closed his eyes.
"I thought you were with Narcissa today?"
“You’d almost think with our history, we’d want to be as far apart from one another as we could get," Harry answered with a crooked smile.
would look fantastic on a vest."
"I know!" Draco called back, disappearing around a corner. "Say it back!"
The wand tip landed in the direction of Padma. She did as she’d always done.
"Glamours?" Harry asked. Hermione's little curls shook as she shook her head.
Harry closed the report file and tossed it onto the coffee table as he rose.
He closed his eyes as he keened, and let everything wash over him. It was an overload to feel the bump of Draco's fist against his body at the bottom of each pull, and the throb in his cock announcing that he was past the point of return. He pressed up onto his toes, his body trying and failing to lessen the pressure of Draco's strong finger sliding and dragging in and out of his body. He clenched around it involuntarily as the electric storm that was his orgasm reached a peak and then broke throughout his body. The fever pitch choked him—the release sent a pulse of spunk onto Draco's belly as Harry panted a release of breath.
"That's it," Draco purred, soothing the skin he'd spanked with wisps of kisses, the barest touching of his lips to the buzzing spot. Harry could scarcely believe the next words out of Draco's mouth, each one gift-wrapped for him.
"They probably would have hidden us back here anyway," he continued. "I'm too much of a nuisance in the regular rooms. Press and, er, fans. You know."
"Yeah," he said gruffly. "Maybe a bit obsessed with you."
The subject was changed to Halloween party planning, an excellent, neutral topic, and Harry was asked for one photograph with a young witch, which quickly turned to autographs until Ron stepped in and Harry was tucked at the back of the table where passersby couldn't tap his shoulder and do the little wave thing that signalled an incoming ask. Nervous energy drove him to drink another pint and then another. He couldn't stop his leg from jiggling under the table, the promise of the coin in his pocket making every minute feel like an hour.
remote," and was surprised when the plastic stick zipped into his palm from the side table across the room.
"Are you planning on coming back?" Ron asked. Hermione put down her glass of wine and waited, just as interested in his answer as Ron was.
"I can try to let things be," Harry started slowly, "but—"
didn't come to mind easily—
"All's well with your article today. You continue to have the Auror department's full support—I want to make that clear."
Harry sat back in his chair, relaxing his shoulders from where they'd remained stuck up by his ears. He wished for all the world that Malfoy would cross his legs so that the outline of his prick down his trousers' left leg wasn't so painfully obvious.
It wasn't Malfoy's left arm that surprised him.
“Voldemort can go fuck himself," Harry said, and Draco bit his lip, smiling back at him. "It tastes the same as your skin everywhere else."
She arched a brow at him. "He's a moody little shit to
," he said, jaw agape. "Would you
The best part about fucking Harry is his pain tolerance.
"Yes," he breathed, "it would mean a lot to me."
That was until Draco leaned in the last few inches and ground his erection into Harry's hip, sighing as he did it. The press of his heated body promised sensual pleasure Harry hadn't yet known; the slight roll of his hips enough to scrape the last bit of sense from his mind. The breathiness of the sound Draco made drew a dribble of pre-come from Harry, leaking directly into the already damp cotton of his pants.
The words' implications; how what wasn't said loomed so much louder than what he'd allowed himself to say.
"You're joking,” he managed to choke out. The sandwich had to be briefly lowered in favour of serious talk.
"Yes. I'd like that."
Clubbing was a bit ruined for him, nerves getting the better of him even when his drink remained firmly in his grasp all night. Even so, he did get pleasantly sloshed and managed a fumbled kiss with a stunning brunette in the bathroom of a Muggle pub in Shoreditch. The man passed Harry his number on a cocktail napkin, his name, "SIMON" in stout block letters. Harry kept it for a few days, fingering the edges until they were rubbed translucent, thinking about what could be. When the temptation to reach out began to overwhelm him, the clamshell phone open with the digits punched in as he finished another bland roast dinner alone at home, he grabbed his wand and incinerated the napkin without a second thought. He was sure that the house actually groaned when he did it.
bit, you fucking psycho. What part of 'leave me alone' didn't you understand?"
, with that look. Did you think I was avoiding this dinner?" Harry shrugged, garnering him a melodramatic gasp for the ages. "You absolute
"No." He sighed deeply and slouched, looked wistfully at the reassembled pile of glass and pottery, a sight not unlike a modern sculpture, heaped as it was. "I’m still in the breaking-things stage."
"They must have gotten it on camera," Harry said, looking to Ron. His eyes made quick movements, wheels turning rapidly in his mind. Ron was the right man for this job. His long fingers were already scrabbling inside the pocket of his robes, coming up with a quick-quotes quill and a flip pad of cheap grid paper.
"I'm a bit lost,” Harry said. “What did he say?"
Best case scenario, Draco would ask him nicely to get out and to come back once he'd sorted out his shit. Which would be never, because it wasn't just "his shit" that needed sorting.
"And then, perhaps, we'll eat, Potter. After all, I’m famished."
"The last time I took a taxi, the cabbie locked all the doors and told me I could pay with my mouth, so." He washed his hands over his face, still not looking at Harry. "So, I'd rather not do that, again, thanks."
"What's happening. You've done something ludicrous, haven't you?"
"This isn't some fucking Quidditch match, Draco!" Harry was yelling—he didn't want to be, but his ire was up, and this was all wrong, and fighting was what he and Draco did best anyway, wasn't it? The coziness in the room was suddenly gone as a sharp wind whipped through the room, the frames hanging on the walls rattling. Harry hoped it was just a wintry blast and not his mood whipping up a storm. "We're not in bloody school anymore, remember?"
Harry was scowling. He'd started doing it on purpose because he was at a public event on a day when everyone, even when they were pretending not to, watched him. And this was a day where it was crucial that people not notice him smile, or laugh, or show anything but contrite unhappiness because today was the day they'd won, but that also made it the day when so many people and beings they'd loved had been lost.
"—And you know what he did then?"
"See you," Hermione said, giving him a parting peck on his cheek. Her eyes flicked in the nervous way of hers, and then over to Justin.
as he begged Harry to leave. That, and his Christmas gifts—a cryptic note with no end date in sight, and an enchanted diary that Harry felt guilty about using, was still keeping from Martin. He pulled it out in the evening and lost time to it too, confident that he knew he wasn't talking to Draco, not really, but satiated in the book's quick wit, smiling down on the words that appeared on the pages. It wasn't enough, but it helped.
Something inside Harry roiled, a warm feeling spreading in his chest at Draco's words.
Draco sucked the chip. Held it between his molars and haltingly crunched it down.
He recalled Draco's words, pleading to him what felt like a lifetime ago.
"They'll never have a chance to do so with you taking on every other task to be done."
Draco cracked a smile to one side, eyes still closed and face still pressed into Harry's palm. The smile grew into a tired laugh, remembering that time so long ago when he'd last needed Harry to heal a bruise for him. And then Draco was gripping the wrist of the hand that held his face, his other hand at Harry's opposite shoulder, and he was crying, a tired, smooth sort of a letting go. Harry held him close and rocked the both of them back and forth until it passed, one hand rubbing down the slope of his skull to the mountain ridge of his spine, shushing him. He gently loosened his grip from around his back when the tears stopped flowing.
They stood shoulder to shoulder, both keeping their eyes resolutely on the clothes before them. Malfoy huffed as steam began to rise from the garments.
“Perhaps a silk-cotton blend,” Malfoy murmured. “I like shiny things,” he said, and Harry wondered why Malfoy wanted him to know.
Harry stared, not piecing the plan together yet. Draco gave a great exhalation and continued his diatribe.
she trims Bernard's coat quarterly."
"And what if it was?" Draco turned to face him. "What if Justin was the last good, hard fuck I've had? What about it?"
"This," Draco slipped a finger through the gap between Harry's shirt buttons, "off."
Harry steadied himself at the threshold, taking a deep breath, eyes squeezed firmly shut as his hand rested on the door handle.
"Is that the word we're using?" Ron's lips twisted to the side, the one-eyed-frown of

"Potter?"
"Yes, it was really
"Maybe I read that a certain law regarding Goblins was poised to pass today," he said, "and I thought that today was as good a day as any to visit one of my best friends and treat her to lunch."
"I'm sorry—"
happened. Betting was often involved, as to whether there was any subplot that had been left out or not. In this way, he won many sexual favours from Harry about little details left out here or there. Through the guise of the game, this was also how he learned about the cupboard and the bars on the window, and by extension the cellar, and why Harry had once found solace in his pantry.
Disassociation
"Is that typical?"
but how Harry wanted Draco.
He waited until six before responding, his only means of showing both restraint and irritation. Still, he knew his response delivered a promise of what was to come, showed his continued eagerness, knew that somewhere, Draco's coin warmed like hot coal through his trouser's pockets and that something about that excited Draco too. And something odd happened when Draco arrived, not even a whisper of apology on his lips for the time—Harry's anger melted away. They sat and talked politely for a while, didn't even make it away from the same dining room table that had been the setting of their second encounter. Draco laved at Harry's cock until he came, shuddering down his throat, and Harry pushed him flat on the tabletop, sucking him down to the root, memorizing each filthy word he whispered into the near-darkness. Harry sat on the table and waved goodbye when he left, his shoes hanging from his fingertips, crooked smiles on both their faces.
"Nothing," Ron grit out.
And though the thought flickered across his mind—
Draco rolled his eyes, a plume of smoke huffed into the sky. "Oh, please do shut up. I've got to go."
When Justin motioned for Harry to follow him into his office with a curl of a single finger, it annoyed Harry more than it should have. He was pointy and raw, not to mention sober, and enormously tired of socializing. He'd been molested by the needs of fans and cast adrift in turns, left totally alone as the wizard rock-band booked for the event played their set. He didn't have any real friends in attendance, and Justin had to mind the younger years, so he kept his chin up and vision blurred, his preferred method to lessen the burning sensation of hundreds of sets of eyes watching him sway along, alone in a crowd, to the music.
His glasses were still around. He'd recently overheard that Reza was planning for him "to go tortoiseshell for fall," and the thought that his glasses were about to become a seasonal affair worried Harry if only a little.
And that would be fine if only he could do something about it. Give a few rough tugs of the foreskin down, roll it back up with a loose fist. Touch himself the way he liked, just to get going. It wouldn’t be enough, but it would be
Draco leaned in. "Whatever. Compact." He tilted his jaw up like he welcomed a kiss. Expected one. "I never said I don't like you this way."
Draco made an exasperated face. "What do you think you're going to do with that thing? You can't charm it to show you what you want to see either—trust me, I've tried."
"Hello to you too, Pansy." She flipped him off as he removed the lid from his latest cup of—well, wasn't that surprising, smelled like mocha—and leaned against the wall.
"Oh?"
Christ, pet, where'd you learn to suck cock like that, yes,
, and that was it. Even though reservations flowed in his blood like an allergic reaction, making him tense up in worried anticipation, he couldn't say no to that face. Deep down, he didn't want to.
"Rehab? Like, Muggle rehab?" Harry asked.
His attention flicked between Draco's face—a pained frown on the precipice of orgasm—and his Mark—so incredibly black against the white of the sheets, the sinews of his arm flexing as he pressed back against the headboard.
phase, so rather a lot," she said, which was enough to send Ron reeling from the room, his neck and cheeks turned the purple-red of beet juice, and Draco smirked, somehow enjoying the track of the conversation in a way that neither Neville nor Harry could. Harry met Neville’s eyes as he grimaced, something Harry could feel his own face mirroring. Neville, because he was not enjoying imagining Harry fumbling about with his fiancé, and Harry because he knew that Neville was imagining it.
, but the pain caused by Ron's gesture was merciful. The lack of response meant that Draco wasn't conscious, was someplace blank and quiet and without pain, in the recesses of his mind. Ron knelt closer and pulled back one eyelid and then the other to peer inside. They didn’t resist, pupils sharpened pinpoints in icy rings. No blink.
"What!"
It was a distraction from everything, even as Draco's hands freed the button of his trousers. He broke contact and shifted back onto his heels to ask Harry, breathless, "Take them off?" and it was all Harry could do to nod and shimmy out of them, lifting his hips to tear everything down at once, struggling to pull off even his socks and fling them away until he laid naked, flat on his back. Draco was on top of him in an instant, hair brushing Harry's cheeks.
"Happy as a clam and perpetually at your service, our Saviour," she said, tapping the keys before her, her tongue slipping between her lips as she concentrated.
Draco laughed and straightened his clothing, a loose cotton shirt that draped around his lithe body and a pair of trousers. They were the most casual clothes Harry had seen him in even though they were unlike most of the clothes he’d seen most people wear around the house.
He longed to ask him how things like this worked between mates. Was Harry doing the right thing by forgiving Draco? He wanted to, he didn’t want to fight, didn’t want him to leave but was it the right thing or a product dependency on the bond?
Harry frowned.
Whatever was in that cup wouldn’t kill him but it would incapacitate him enough for someone to have an easy time at doing so. With the way he’d riled McNair and Warrington he might not leave this room at all and he was in no shape to run and in no shape to fight.
“Not all problems are equal. You’re allowed to hurt even though there may be someone who has it worse. People are wired different, not everyone can take as many hits as the next person.”
"Whether or not you will allow it, Severus, is of no consequence. What is done is done. The boy will need your support-"
“Which one?”
Harry’s eyes travelled back to the Great Hall. He had not checked today but he was sure Malfoy was in there with Parkinson and Zabini. He could call him somehow, like the last time. Not that he knew how exactly he’d done that.
Draco raised an eyebrow but Harry didn’t look at him as he paced three times before the empty wall. When the door materialised, Harry turned to approach Draco but he held out his right hand, his left one now clutched close.
Harry didn’t turn away despite the clear dismissal in the words. “What did you say?” he asked after a moment.
Harry said nothing.
Harry knew it was all she could offer. Draco would never be allowed to reveal his sexuality. If he did then his family would go to great lengths to label it as a ‘phase’.
Fuck yes.
"Fine. Whatever. I couldn’t care less."
“I was only supposed to be here for two days,” he said still perched on the edge of the bed.
Harry took the opportunity to examine his surroundings.
Malfoy yanked his hand out of Harry's grip. "What?" It was not unkind but neither was it inviting. It was as if the Slytherin had lost the energy to continue fighting but couldn't exactly put up with him either.
“Everything alright?” she asked with a hesitant smile.
"Yeah, I know." He pinched the bridge of his nose then lowered his voice. "It's not fair that he has to do it alone, you know. And it's Draco. Beneath the façade of fearlessness, he's very afraid. He wouldn't say it but-"
Blaise's growl followed him in.
Not to mention that he didn’t need to wear a tie at this hour anyway.
Draco declined the option of an anaesthetic spell – which Lupin reminded him he would need to master soon – and the conversation had ceased at that. The implication of that was clear as were Lupin’s thoughts on the matter. Draco might be human but his wolf was not and he should never forget it.
Potter’s next hiss let him know he had found the spot. He cast an
Or anything really.
They promised not to and quickly slipped out of the library. "Where to?" asked Ron conspiratorially and Harry couldn't help a grin.
Harry ignored him but Draco grabbed his wand and pointed it at him for the first time in a long time. “Stay. Back.”
He was playing for time and they all knew it but wrapping his mind around this was harder than he would have thought. The man he’d been sent to kill had no problem dying, his work would have been cut out for him… if he was still that person.
Draco flashed him a grin to mollify the words. It came easier than it should have.
Draco chuckled from beside him.
What did it matter anyway? Zabini didn’t care about him.
He looked at the cabinet one last time before retracing his footsteps and leaving the Room of Requirement. He was surprised to find that it was dark outside. He hadn't noticed how fast time had flown by. As he descended the stairs, he debated about whether or not to stop by the Great Hall.
"I will not allow this to happen, something can be done, it is only a matter of having the right ingredients."
Harry caught his hand. Draco’s gaze only bore the slightest trace of confusion. Harry swallowed wondering what to say, what he’d meant to say.
“Lupin found you then.”
He made quick work of his lower body then put the pyjamas on him. He was still muttering then, words that Harry didn't understand. Something about it was synonymous with the events of the match against Slytherin, of their first night together…
His voice was light but Harry suspected he could sense the emotions roiling in his gut.
Harry pulled back when Malfoy turned to face him and his gaze slid to his lips of its own volition.
It wasn't as though Slytherin would win the friendly or the match. Whoever they got to replace him as seeker would not have had months of practice every summer since he was seven.
With that Lino left and Draco strode to the French windows in silence. Harry followed.
“Fine. Can I at least put a bandage on it?”
“I’m sorry,” he said after a long moment and Draco thought he saw tear tracks on his face. “It wasn’t supposed to go this way.”
Harry woke to the sound of Draco moving about the room, a square of parchment in one hand and a quill in the other. He squinted and sat up in bed. Draco paused his pacing and turned to him. When he didn’t say anything, however, Harry felt compelled to speak.
“Why?” he demanded.
When he was in the mood for it, Draco switched seats with Blaise. Blaise didn’t like it. something about ‘exercising the glare’. He would never attempt to switch with Pansy. She had forbidden him from ever undermining her authority in public.
Harry recognised the offer for what it was, knew it went both ways. This might be his one chance to find out what Dumbledore had said but an old fear gripped him. What if it wasn’t what he wanted to hear? What if it was something that drove a rift between him and Draco? What if Draco lied – would they ever come back from that?
Draco angled his head for a kiss but didn’t take it. “I am relaxed.”
Hermione's smile vanished from her face.
"Ok. Last one," Ron said. "The Popess who represents enlightenment and passion." Ron grinned as Harry wrote that down. "Good times are ahead wouldn't you say?"
“To what?” he demanded getting to his feet. “Are we really doing this?”
“What was that all about?” Ron demanded of Hermione as they trudged up to Gryffindor tower.
"D'you think swearing at me is going to make stop?" he asked.
Draco’s eyes flew open and his irises burned with desire as he said, “I don’t care.”
“Hermione still talks to me. Seamus, Dean and Neville as well. Ginny too, Lupin, Dumbledore, McGonagall,” In truth, Harry didn’t know if the last few had more to do with professional conduct but he didn’t care. “That’s what friendship is, Ron. That’s what love is.”
“Not quite.” Draco rose from the edge of the bathtub. “I can’t believe I thought you had a shred of talent for potions. You mixed these wrong last time. The red and blue ones soothe tension and aches. One drop of the clear liquid over there is enough to dull clarity of mind. There isn’t actually any lavender in this but the scent means I did it right.”
He wanted Draco to touch him. He wanted Draco to mark him. He wanted Draco to fuck him. He wanted to feel
The look in her face said she knew the truth.
“Thank you for the information and… have a good time today.”
{HPDM}
Ron waved it away in a oddly chivalrous manner. "What were you thinking about?"
Feeling the effects of the potions, he drawled. "Really, did she crawl into your bed to tell you that?"
“This is what I mean. You two have a lot of unfinished business. Sort it out. It’s irritating me.”
Draco found Pansy seated on the quidditch stands. It wasn’t been easy but this was not one of her haunts.
Draco had not been planning to threaten Nott. That was below his station as a Malfoy.
{HPDM}
Potter met him as an equal. He always had and he had never underestimated his flying skills.
"What-?" he started to say.
“What?” he said walking past him.
But he didn't.
“Sparing you some serious trouble,” he said looking back in the direction they had come from. Narcissa’s voice wafted from beyond the corridor, Draco’s rising to meet it. “But if you would rather return to the fire…”
Harry stepped into oddly well-lit room conscious of the fact that Malfoy and Snape who had been ahead of him seemed to know their places well enough.
“Wait.”
"First, I don't think you can claim to know me if you think I'm going to tell the whole school," he said noting that they had both stopped walking. Again. The sun was almost entirely out by this time. "Second, you owe me two now, I may have been raised by muggles but I'm smart enough to know that's not how life debts work."
“I know what it’s like, Harry. Even if you and I experience it on opposite sides. You have to be cautious. Draco Malfoy may not be… He is unlikely to harm you but the rest don’t care like he does.”
Harry wanted to look away but even then he knew.
“Do you ever keep time?”
Hermione spoke first. “I tried, Harry. But –”
Harry’s gaze flicked to the writing desk and Draco saw his resolve waning. He was running out of excuses.
So much time had passed and the sun would begin to set soon. They had less than seven hours left, it seemed like enough time but three hours had elapsed since Harry found out Draco was missing and he was no closer to finding him.
It was only a few minutes past seven. He didn’t know what time the physician would be here, no one had bothered to specify. He also didn’t know what time people got up in the Malfoy household or if they took all their meals together. Though something told him if Draco was missing in action then he was safe.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “You really do whatever pleases you, don’t you?”
They lay in silence for a few long minutes listening to the creaking sounds of the house around them. Harry was sure Kreacher was somewhere in the attic, picking through possessions and grumbling. He tried to imagine what it would have been like to come here alone.
This time it was bubbling on the surface, begging to break free. Draco tried to think back, tried to recall whether anything had happened. He remembered everything until how he got to the toilet last night. Everything else was a blur. There were snatches of memory here and there but nothing enough to satisfy his curiosity. Now that he thought about it, he wasn't sure how he ended up in his bed. He didn't think he could have gone back by himself. Had someone found him?
The call of sleep ignored his attempts to stay upright. He clutched Draco’s hand as tight as he could. He didn’t want to go, he wanted to…
“Thank you,” he said instead.
"It's better to know your enemy, know their weaknesses."
"Maybe I did that but didn't want the staff to lose out on much-needed revenue just because I wanted to show you a good time. And it's terribly gauche to go brandishing money on a date,
"You're doing splendidly in the
"I'll be good," Harry said, slipping down under the covers next to him.
“You’re right, you’re both right. If I can’t stomach garlic bread right now, I’m not going to be able to eat anything. Hustle to the Apparition point?”
magic," Draco retorted, catty, even though his tight grip on Harry's fingers spoke to his nerves. The flashbulbs went off and Harry thought, weirdly, that he was glad Draco was wearing a soft colour—a light grey jumper with overlong sleeves, and lilac coloured stitching—because it would soften him. As though a hint of purple would keep the papers from calling him a demon.
"Alright. Have you ever done this before?"
"This is how you check your nails if you're gay," he said before turning them around so that the palms faced him as he made soft fists. "This is how you check your nails if you're straight." He gave his head a little shake, eyes raised to the ceiling, looking for all the world incredibly vexed. "I suppose the children who invented this test were yet to grasp the full spectrum of sexualities. They didn't include any other groups in their foolproof test-method, but there you have it. How's a bi-sexual person meant to do it, for example?"
—we can come back if we have to. You're free to go, and to return."
The way his eyes glinted, Harry wouldn't be surprised if he started spitting next, foaming at the mouth.
." Draco chose that moment to press his finger inside of Harry and it ravaged what little self-control he had left. His neck arched and in the heat of the shower, gooseflesh broke out over his entire body.
Harry shrugged with the bottle of wine aloft in one hand and the sunglasses in the other.
"Can we please not talk about it? I did it, it's done, end of story."
"You first," Harry said when they parted. He knelt down—bum knees be damned—and relished the bump of the head of Draco's prick against his cheek. He stroked him to full hardness with his right hand, left tugging gently at his sac.
not to take your advice." He finished quickly, cheeks pink with effort or embarrassment, or a mixture of both.
Draco squinted at him. "Are you becoming confused? Have I missed the signs where you turned deranged?" He ran a demonstrative hand over his own chest. "The mornings are my time. It's not," he waved his hand dismissively towards Harry, "this."
Harry waited as Draco repositioned himself and finally stopped moving.
Draco's eyes flicked from Harry's face to the bag on the table and back to him.
"Just one more—" the man tried to interject before the grille clanked shut and whisked him away.
Harry smiled too, the tightness in his lungs loosening. "I, I—I was a bit anxious about, well—this, I suppose. Seeing you."
"So reimburse them," Harry said tetchily.
Harry raised a brow. He might like it, honestly. Was willing to try anything, basically, where Draco was concerned. "Were you keeping it as a souvenir?" Harry thumbed the outline again, curious how it had felt; turned on at the concept of letting someone else do it to him; wanting to learn it for himself.
the majority of them."
Harry's throat felt scratchy as he thought of Tonks, and by extension, of Teddy; of how he could lose his connection with his godson over pursuing whatever he was doing with Draco. How someone who'd thought like Draco, someone on
