About an hour later, Doctor Barwald arrived. The worry eased from Gibbs’ face as he escorted the doctor inside.
Ginny blushed but carried on. “She might be willing to help us. She is close friends with the Duke of Malfoy, isn’t she? And I thought you two knew each other ….”
“Okay.” Sweat spilled down Harry’s face. He got to his feet unsteadily. He took a deep breath and focused on his magic. He couldn’t fuck this up.
Once Draco had relayed this information, he returned to Gibbs and Potter, and found them in the middle of easy chatter.
“It better not be about the election,” he said, and ripped open the letter. What he read made him turn cold.
Draco wrapped his arms around him, drawing him closer. The kiss turned hard, possessive. Potter panted.
Draco grabbed his wrist, wanting to understand before they went any further. “Do you want to see my cock?”
“I’m afraid,” Draco whispered, not sure if he wanted Goyle to hear him. He and Goyle had been more like friends for a while now, but Goyle was still under his employment.
Harry gulped and fiddled with his gold-lined serviette. “There was pain in their voices … and there was also hope. Perhaps they were singing about a loaf of bread, but I got the sense the songs were about deeper stuff … like falling in love.”
Draco stared blankly at him. If Potter had been any other man, Draco was sure he would have thrashed him. Several seconds passed before Draco could speak. “Why are you here?”
“It appears so, dear,” Trelawney answered. She was clear-eyed again. “You’re bleeding. Let’s get a mediwitch to look over you.”
The palace was cold and opulent, with long dead Kings and Queens frowning at him from their gilded frames. Draco was used to cold and opulent places; he lived in a few such places himself. But being here gave him a unique sense of dread.
,” Potter moaned as Draco thrust all the way inside. Potter clutched his shoulders, arching his back, as Draco panted in his ear.
Harry ignored him. “I mean - can you breathe? Do you feel intense pain on your stomach?” He pressed his ear to Malfoy’s hot chest. “Breathe in and out.”
“You are here willfully. My valet will testify that you chose to get into my carriage because he offered you payments.”
“Yes,” Harry said simply, and withdrew his fingers. He slicked up his cock, then got into position between Draco’s long legs. “Ready?”
“Yes.” Harry walked around in the nude, looking for the gown. He was gorgeous starkers, his skin tanned, his muscles well-used. His eyes looked too big until he slid on his glasses.
Harry pushed back, wanting his come, wanting his everything. When Malfoy had emptied himself, he thrust again, air escaping his clenched teeth. Harry felt his cock push out its own come.
“A bloke worked in these stables for a few days. I paid attention to him because he was too clean and tidy, if you know what I mean.”
. He wanted to raise children and volunteer at orphanages. Perhaps even foster some children. He wanted to be married to a man who loved him.
Once again, Harry found it more than a little unsettling to be called ‘sir.’ After all, he and the servant were both quite common. “It’s quite all right. Please bring it to me. Though, I’m not sure who could have sent me anything.”
Harry stood before him, still in his scarlet Auror robes. The same robes he’d died in. Draco had forgotten how green Harry’s eyes were.
Malfoy took up the flannel left on Harry’s bedside table. He dipped it carefully in the steaming basin of water. He wrung it out, the ring on his pinkie gleaming.
As they approached the steps to Parliament, holding their banners, yelling their chants, the police began to hit them.
The man stared at Harry just as intently. The man’s gaze slipped down to his mouth and hot desire sparked in his eyes. The man sucked in a breath.
“There’s nothing more attractive than books,” Granger said seriously, and for the life of him, Harry couldn’t tell if she was joking or not.
Harry’s mouth dropped open. His former lover had only put his mouth on his hole once. It had felt good, but it hadn’t felt like this.
“I’ll take both of your horses,” Gibbs said, then he yelled through the open window, “Mad! We’ve got company! It’s the
Draco’s whole body was lit up from the touch. Potter’s hand had been so warm. Draco motioned to the jug on the bedside table. “Are you thirsty?”
The front entrance was old and chipped, and the hinges creaked loudly when they pushed open the doors.
Malfoy led him down a winding, cramped path. They stopped at an alcove crowded with plants. At the centre was a Venus Flytrap, its pink petals like two outstretched tongues. It even had little green teeth.
“Not these men, Mr Potter,” Lady Granger said. “They will eat you alive if you are not careful. The Society took a chance and offered the scholarship to you—a man. Perhaps you will have more success than us.”
Potter just looked at him, still holding his hands. Then, very carefully, he cupped Draco’s face. His thumb almost touched the corner of Draco’s mouth.
Malfoy attempted a shrug but gasped. “It’s not very common. I tried to go to St Mungo’s but they turned me away. Called me Death Eater rubbish. They were right, of course, but my unborn baby isn’t rubbish. My baby deserves treatment. It didn’t choose me to be its father.”
“Oh, it doesn’t matter. I’m just glad you’re here now.” He squeezed her hands. “Have you brought Miss Brown with you by chance?”
“This is all Harry’s doing,” Trelawney explained in a quiet voice. “He told me to watch the building and be ready to alert the Aurors if Theodore showed up here. They had already been investigating him for what happened to Harry. I’m glad they came as quickly as they did.”
“Of course,” Parkinson said blandly, and motioned to one of the servants. “Rose, please show Mr Potter his room right away.”
They kissed and kissed, the only sound in the room being their harsh breath. There were footsteps out in the corridor, murmuring servant voices. Draco didn’t care. He didn’t. The entire world could bugger off. He just wanted the man in his arms; damn it, he wanted to be
“And the union would be platonic because they are such good mates and they could never see each other as proper husband and wife?”
Dudley’s expression fell. “I can’t send you money. We’re already strapped as it is. As I see it, you should be sending
“I don’t think you have any serious internal injuries - besides the broken ribs,” Harry said. “But there is a light pink showing up around your face. I reckon it’s about your nose but I want to make sure.” Harry Summoned his notes from his room.
If they’d been alone, Draco would have pressed his hands to his face. Instead he made his expression go blank. “I was only concerned for his health. The man thought he could out-pace a snowstorm.”
“I can’t afford it either,” Potter said, grinning. He pulled up a chair beside the bed. “Hello, Mrs Gibbs. I’m Harry Potter.”
Draco drowned two tumblers of brandy. “I don’t want to be a member of the conservative party,” he slurred.
They took a carriage to St Giles, the rain now coming down in blinding sheets. Draco could barely make out the murky buildings outside the window.
“Yes, love. It takes enormous balls to strut around the canteen like you do, your head held high. It was one of the reasons why I couldn’t take my eyes off you. You were in the lion’s den and refused to back down.”
Harry was in the middle of a meltdown. He couldn’t say why. For the last couple of weekends, he’d been calm enough to lounge on the sofa while Draco got ready for work. He’d even stood to say goodbye to him, putting his hand on Draco’s lower back, leaning in to smell his brilliant cologne. Draco had kissed his cheek each and every time he’d said goodbye.
Then Draco heard of the National Society of Women’s Suffrage’s decision to hold a protest in Parliament Square, and his stomach lurched. Protests could be dangerous and violent, especially when police were involved.
Harry had only shagged one other man, and it’d been awkward and thrilling and depressing. Not many people in his life were gay like him. He didn’t know that many gay men. When he’d first realised his sexuality, he’d gone to gay bars just to see what he was missing. It’d been fun, he’d supposed. He’d had a few drunken snogs, wanked a few blokes in the toilets. One night he’d even gone home with a Muggle - Harry couldn’t even remember his name now. The sex had been
“I didn’t know you cooked,” Harry said, leaning against the counter and sipping his tea. Malfoy was flushed prettily, his hair combed neatly even though he was still in his pyjamas.
“A cracking good choice.” Draco wanted to touch Potter in goodbye but a handshake felt too formal. Draco forced himself to take a step back. “Tonight then?”
He worked for some time before his eyesight began to fail him. He needed to move closer to the fire, or ask for a gas lamp to be lit. He rested his elbows on the desk and pushed up his glasses. He rubbed his eyes hard, cursing them. His eyes had always been poor and he knew he’d been straining them too much. Oxford didn’t care if your letted room had no window and was as dark as a cupboard.
Tears burned down Draco’s cheeks. “It was so difficult to let you in. I don’t know if I can do it for someone else.”
Nodding, she said, “That is why I need you for this job. You are a thinker, a planner. You are clever.”
Draco flipped through the inked pages. “This took a lot of work.” He was impressed despite himself. “I also have a present for you.”
“It’s not your fault you fell ill.” Malfoy’s mouth curled in a ghost of a smirk. “Well, mostly not your fault.”
Draco hummed and kissed his neck. There was lube next to the lounge chair; it was warmed from the sun. Carefully, Draco worked Harry open with two fingers. Harry was a little loose from all the shagging they had been doing.
Draco gulped thickly. He realised his hands were shaking. “How is Harry going to … No, it’s ridiculous. I refuse to even entertain the idea.”
Draco hoped desperately that Potter stayed away, but of course he knew Potter was not the kind of person to hide when his friends put themselves at risk.
It reminded him of the duke on his knees, his mouth full of his cock, his bollocks. It reminded him of the duke kissing him, his stuttered breathing, his clean, masculine scent overwhelming him.
“No.” Harry lifted his face to look deeply into his eyes. “You are so much better than any fool who can’t get past the Mark on your arm.”
She studied him. “Women aren’t so bad. Perhaps you will find someone who will offer you a shred of comfort.”
“I want you to be chief strategic advisor for the Tory party. As you know, the election is coming up, and I daresay they will need help.”
Malfoy’s eyes rolled up; he looked overcome by the pleasure, by the tight squeeze of Harry’s arse. Smirking, Harry leaned down to kiss him. Malfoy took the opportunity to press a finger to where his cock met Harry’s hole. He felt where they were connected.
Harry felt himself flush again. There was a sly gleam in Granger’s eyes, and it made Harry nervous. He didn’t think Granger intended to hurt him, but he was still not entirely over the damage of his last affair. Sometimes the wounds still felt fresh. He didn’t want to experience that pain again, and he didn’t want to put the duke through anything similar, even if the duke had all the protections of wealth and status.
Draco waited in the dark alley for him. People passed the mouth of the alley, the road a buzz of activity. Draco was drenched, his top hat buckling under the rain’s weight.
“Fine.” Harry waved his wand and the yellow glow disappeared from the room. He could still see Malfoy but he didn’t tell Malfoy this.
“You stupid arse!” Harry yelled. He grabbed Draco, wanting to pull him into an embrace, wanting to kiss him, but all he could do was shake him. “What is wrong with you?”
After breakfast, Harry escaped outside to the snow-licked garden grounds. The day was cold, smoke escaping his mouth with each breath. He wore his new emerald coat. It was a ridiculous, undeserved present from the duke, but Harry wasn’t stupid nor stubborn enough to reject it.
The duke glanced at him again, a slight flush crawling up his neck. It was as if he could hear Harry’s thoughts.
It took their carriage a few minutes to reach the conclusion of the long, manicured drive. A footman received them once the carriage came to a stop.
Malfoy leaned over him, his light cologne filling the air around Harry. His hands slipped down to his back, his thumb and fingers feeling for the knots in his muscles. Harry had been rough on his body in preparation for the match. His muscles were tight all over.
Draco scrutinized him. He wished he knew what Potter was thinking. Potter’s hand moved in circles on his stomach. “That’s not my cock,” he said.
He looked quite bewildered when he stepped into the lounge. “There was no one there,” he told Draco.
Nodding to the other men, Draco jumped back on his steed and took off for the castle. He made sure to look for any hidden holes in the snow.
The groom gave Harry a curious look as he led the horse away. Harry pretended not to notice as he made sure nothing had fallen out of his bag during the journey.
Harry tilted his head. “I thought you understood my preferences, especially after what happened on the floor of the library.”
Potter put his hands on his chest, and tried to push him away. Draco only rocked back a little. “You don’t
Leaving Harry for a moment, Draco went into the bathroom to fill the tub with hot, relaxing water. He made sure there was a flannel and soap and enough towels to get Harry nice and dry. When he returned, a servant was setting out their dinner.
Only a few days later, Malfoy left again to take another client. Harry made an excuse about tidying up his room so he didn’t have to see Malfoy beforehand in his skin-tight robes. Once Malfoy had gone, Harry spent another evening pacing through the house, muttering to himself. His antics even scared the portraits a little.
Draco stalked to the window. The curtains were open, letting in faint milky light. Outside fat snowflakes fell like pebbles.
Potter had looked amazed, those gorgeous emerald eyes staring at Draco. Potter’s mouth had been pink from the bitter air, his whole body chilled. Draco wanted to take care of him. He wanted him to never be cold again.
“Yes, Granger,” Lady Parkinson said, continuing the conversation he hadn’t heard. “I do like your plan.”
Crying out, Harry came hard, shaking all over. His come hit Draco’s cheek, his nose, his lips. Some of it even got into his hair. Draco licked the come from his mouth, wiped his cheek and nose, then sucked on his fingers.
The clerk rang a bell and another set of guards hauled Harry from the chamber. They moved quickly, going deeper inside the penitentiary. The air became mustier, colder. Harry’s heart was pounding hard in his chest and cold sweat broke out along his skin. He was surely doomed.
“Yes,” Harry said, voice equally as quiet. He cleared his throat and forced himself to raise his head. He looked into the duke’s stormy gaze. “You shouldn’t have bought it for me. I—I don’t deserve something so nice.”
“You are gorgeous.” Malfoy smoothed his warm hands down Harry’s back, then went lower to fondle his cheeks. He spread Harry to reveal his arsehole. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed. Being this vulnerable with another man was so erotic, but also frightening.
“Harry,” he whispered, and Harry’s lashes fluttered. Tears burned Draco’s eyes. He couldn’t help it. Dukes didn’t cry, and they especially didn’t cry in
Draco listened for the trailing footsteps while telling himself he was doing no such thing. Trelawney was full of shit; everyone knew that. She had been a terrible professor, a terrible seer. Everyone knew they couldn’t trust what she said.
“I can’t decide whether or not I want to kill you or keep you for myself,” Theo whispered. His eyes were dark again, so dark; there was an excited flush to his cheeks.
, Your Grace.” Potter’s eyes gleamed. “It’s a political and economic theory. I believe a bloke named Karl Marx came up with it.”
“Yes, Your Grace,” answered the director. His face was flushed in fear. “We were merely following protocol. The young man is accused of assaulting an officer.”
Harry thrust in and out; he pushed up, curling, as he searched for Draco’s pleasure spot. When he found it, Draco’s eyes went wide.
Malfoy leaned closer to run the flannel down his neck, over his throat; Harry’s shirt had many buttons undone, and Malfoy smoothed the flannel over the little slice of his exposed chest.
He clutched his head, blocking out the sunlight. Harry couldn’t be gone … it wasn’t possible. He was meant to live forever; he was meant to always win. He was the hero in the story.
Draco was discomforted. He couldn’t stop thinking about the child. He imagined Harry as that child, scrubbing floors just to have a roof over his head. He imagined it and
Goyle opened the door and shoved Dursley out. He landed in cold, dirty mud. The carriage took off again.
Harry felt his face go pink. He was suddenly stammering. “Well - I dunno. Something really awful, mind. Something really really awful.”
At the hotel the meeting was already underway. Lady Granger gave him a sharp look as he headed for the open chair next to Ginny.
“Yes,” he said, gazing out the window at the white expanse beyond. It thankfully had stopped snowing. “This is the nicest bed I’ve ever slept in. The problem is I just have so much work to do.”
In the corner, knitting needles clicked together. They were making a red and gold scarf, a Gryffindor scarf. For a long moment, Draco watched the needles weave the yarn together, his mind an empty cavern. Somehow Harry’s spell was still hard at work. It almost gave him a flicker of hope. Didn’t magic die with the wizard? If those needles were still clicking together, didn’t that mean Harry was still alive?
They were perched in Potter’s parlour, a chessboard between them. Draco paused, his eyes trained on the rowdy pawns.
He left his room, feeling as if he were in a daze. The hallway was dark and quiet, Harry’s feet padding against the carpet.
“I am sorry, ma’am. I’m needed elsewhere.” Only a duke could get away with such insubordination. The hard look on her face said she knew it.
Malfoy and the director left. Harry realised he wasn’t alone in the room. Goyle, Malfoy’s valet, hovered in a corner. He tipped his hat to Harry.
Warm bag in hand, Draco wandered from the restaurant, enjoying the glow of the setting sun. London was always softer at twilight, the sounds somehow muted.
“What are you doing?” Harry felt weightless, his thoughts sluggish. Being this close to the duke made him feel utterly lost to himself.
Groaning, Harry pushed into him. Draco was so tight that it made Harry catch his breath. Harry watched his face for any sign of pain. “Is this all right?”
Potter backed up against the desk. He had gone pink in the face. He seemed to be always blushing around Draco. “An adventure, Your Grace?”
“Strange place to put something that’s available to everyone: a locked room inside a castle.” Potter’s voice was still breezy, his mouth still curled in a grin.
They stepped back to admire the twinkling candlelight. Carefully, Draco wrapped his arm around Potter. He was a little surprised when Potter let him. Potter snuggled close to him, and sighed.
Harry’s eyes lingered on Goyle until he realised he was staring. The fever had stolen much of his thoughts. “He is very big.”
“No, Your Grace. He has asked me to be his assistant, his companion. I have decided to accept his offer.”
Harry blinked several times. He wasn’t sure why Lady Granger was speaking to him and he couldn’t read her expression. Granger had brown eyes and unruly hair, and she exuded an intractable iciness.
“Tell me,” Draco said quietly, touching Potter’s cheek. He urged Potter to look at him, and the pain he saw in Potter’s gaze nearly broke him. “You can trust me.”
Potter stuttered and tried to refuse, but the two women said they were leaving anyway. Draco and Potter sat down, and a waiter hurried over to take their drink orders.
Excited, Malfoy moved his chair even closer to the bed. The fire was bright and comforting, and it made Malfoy’s skin look like honey. The duke had beautiful eyes.
Harry gulped. Stupidly, he felt tears sting his eyes. What he needed to say to Malfoy was going to hurt them both.
He stepped back into the Great Hall, and made eye contact with Lord Webbington. The man raised his eyebrows at Harry. Harry flinched; he couldn’t help it. He had no idea if Webbington knew what had just happened between Harry and the duke on the balcony, but it felt like he knew. Harry only saw hostility in the man’s gaze.
Draco had been perched in his enormous wingback chair by the fire when a servant had led the man into the library. Draco had recognised him immediately as the sinful male suffragist. His whole body had throbbed just seeing him again.
They promptly left his study and ventured to Potter’s room. As they passed, servants pressed against the wall and turned their faces away as if trying to bleed into the wallpaper. Draco was so used to it he barely noticed.
When he figured Malfoy was set, he went back down to the kitchen to resume cooking. He made a quick salad to go with the steak. He plated the food and went back upstairs to serve Malfoy his dinner.
One of his tenants—Mr Gibbs—was waving Draco down. Draco and Potter stopped, and Gibbs tore his hat off when he stopped at Draco’s horse.
Late at night, he heard Potter’s moans, felt the clench of his fingers against his shoulders. When he wanked, he recalled how Potter tasted on his tongue, how his sweat and musk and cologne filled his nose. His orgasms were lonely, empty things, and they always left him wanting more.
“Take it nice and slow,” Draco said, voice more of an order than mere encouragement. They followed a muddy path.
When Draco went back inside, he was startled to see Potter leaning close to Mrs Gibbs and feeling her stomach.
“No, I believe she means it this time.” He sighed heavily. “Pans, I don’t think I can escape my fate much longer.”
Harry opened his mouth eagerly. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening. Their tongues brushed together, and Draco tasted like grapes.
They went to his bedroom and Potter pulled back the sheets for him, making Draco a nice comfy spot next to him. “Jump up here, boy. Yes, just like that.” Draco crawled into bed.
Half an hour later, Harry was soaking in a brilliant bath. He had had a meal of chicken and bread, and his tea had been scalding hot. A bath just for himself was such a luxury, and leaning his head back and closing his eyes, he let himself just enjoy the clean water.
Green carpeted nearly everything; only the stoney footpath remained untouched. Tropical palms reached out to pat Harry on the head, furry vines draped from trees, snake-like, curled and hooked.
Mr Weasley was a Classics professor at Oxford, and Harry had been lucky enough to nab a research position with him. The small stipend meant Harry could afford to eat after sending his two pounds to Dudley every month.
“You’re not going to offend me, mind. I understand that you’d be curious. Do you want to know how I got into prostitution?”
She stretched herself against the dirty wall, showing off her curves. When he didn’t react, she dropped the pose and glowered at him. “You must be here for that bloke. The sickly one.”
Harry blocked the man’s path. The man’s eyes narrowed at him. Up close, Harry noticed the colour of his hair—white blond.
The curtains were still drawn around his bed but he saw a slice of weak morning light. A fire crackled nearby but his room was still cold. He could tell it had snowed overnight.
Harry gathered him in his arms, holding him tight. He leaned up to find Harry’s lips. As their kiss once again grew desperate, he hoped it conveyed to Harry what he could not put into words.
Harry looked at Granger for a moment. Granger was still stern, still serious; but she had a big heart. “Thank you, Lady Granger,” he said.
“Draco,” he whispered, as his cock filled Malfoy’s mouth with his hot spunk. He watched his cock ruin Malfoy’s mouth, thrusting in and out, some of his semen escaping his lips.
Harry sneaked past him, and Malfoy closed the door behind him. The room was large with a roaring fire. The bed loomed large and intimidating, but its green duvet looked soft and inviting.
They continued to work on the garden - weeding the flowers, pruning their stems. Another spell revealed ivy choking the garden walls so they spent a few days cutting through the thick vegetation.
Harry fucked his mouth, going slowly at first, then speeding up. He couldn’t look away. He thrust and thrust, and Malfoy took him deeper and deeper. Then he felt himself breach Malfoy’s throat, and it was all over. Malfoy choked and sputtered, but he let Harry keep him down. Harry came hard. He filled Malfoy’s mouth, his throat; they both moaned loudly.
Draco pulled back to scrutinise Potter’s flushed features. “Don’t you think I deserve some explanation?”
Harry watched himself use the duke’s mouth, thrusting and thrusting, the duke’s eyes fluttering, his cheeks streaked with a hot flush. The duke seemed unable to contain the moans that rumbled in his chest. His hand came up to cradle Harry’s bollocks, roll them; Harry felt himself stiffen even more.
It was the day before Christmas Eve, and the sun shined almost brightly through the castle windows. Draco sat at his study desk, a mountain of paperwork and correspondence in front of him. There was even a letter from the Queen waiting unanswered for him.
Draco still had to go to work because he still had pride. The DMLE had taken pity on him and had hired him on as a secretary. Robards had even asked him what he wanted to do with his life.
Sighing, Potter went to the pasta bake. He ladled cheesy pasta onto two plates and brought them over to the table. “Can we eat now please?”
Potter’s throat worked as he swallowed. His face had gone slightly pink. “Ah, Malfoy. I didn’t know you worked here.”
“Um.” Now Harry fiddled with his cutlery. This old geezer would find fault in anything he said. “Currently, I’m in the beginning stages of organising Professor Weasley’s expedition to the Mediterranean.”
Draco rode his steed hard back to the castle, making record time. He passed the supplies house, but decided not to stop. He would have Carter’s job if he didn’t give Gibbs that firewood.
Harry turned his head against the pillow. He was exhausted, achy; but he still wanted to look at Malfoy. “There’s no need for anyone to rush here on my account. I’ll be all right.”
Draco still couldn’t believe his nerve. When he had ordered Potter to leave, it had never occurred to him that Potter would do so on foot. It must have been his upbringing; perhaps he was used to walking for miles.
“Ah.” Malfoy moved closer, his hands now behind his back. His gaze never left Harry’s face. “You look better, healthier. Good.”
Shuddering, Draco did what he was told. Harry cast a lube spell, then brushed two fingers against his hole. His eyes fluttered: Draco was already prepped, already ready. He was even a little loose.
Malfoy fed him a bit more both. Harry tried not to slurp. His gaze went to the hidden manservant. Was this some sort of test? Perhaps it was against the law for a duke to feed a commoner? Was it all a mean joke?
Theo’s lips twitched in a frown. “It’s only been a few months since Potter’s death. It makes sense that you would be - well, you know.”
Potter Conjured some lube and reached down to prepare himself. With slick hands, he helped Draco maneuver into place. He guided Draco’s cock to his hole, then helped him push in.
Trelawney remained in her chair. “I’m terribly sorry. Really, I am. But I cannot leave until I tell you the message. He won’t let me.”
Finally Potter returned with the crushed herbs and a glass of water. He mixed the mugwort, chasteberries, and the chamomile together. Then he raised the glass to Mrs Gibbs’ lips and helped her drink the concoction. He was so gentle with her and it touched something deep in Draco.
Draco turned his attention back to Potter. Potter looked barely coherent and his eyes grew wide every time his horse swayed.
Draco returned to his chair. They stared at one another for a long moment, then Draco said, “I wish to know you.”
The things he was feeling … they weren’t nice. They were problematic. He wanted to track Malfoy down, punch his client in the face. He wanted to protect Malfoy, put him on a pedestal. But Malfoy was a person with ambition and pride. Harry had to respect Malfoy’s wishes, and if Malfoy wanted to continue working as a prostitute, then Harry had to accept it. He had to accept that Malfoy didn’t want to be on that pedestal.
Draco worked his mouth, hot desire throbbing through him. “I will say anything if it means I can have you.”
“No, I refuse to continue this madness any longer. You must forget about me, Your Grace. You must move on.”
Draco wrenched himself away. He was heavy and throbbing, but he would stop if Potter wanted him to stop.
A few minutes later, Draco galloped away with the herbs in his pocket. He knew his servants had good reason to stare at him; he knew he was acting quite unusual. It didn’t matter. The only thing that mattered was improving Mrs Gibbs health (and impressing Potter).
When Malfoy was inside all the way, he gasped against Harry’s back, both of his hands now squeezing his hips.
Potter stood up, came around the chessboard. He dropped to a knee and took Draco’s face between his warm palms. He stared deeply into Draco’s eyes.
Tearful, Harry stepped back, again and again. His brilliant gaze never left Draco. “I love you,” Harry said, but he was disappearing. “I love you; but you should let go. We will meet again some other day.”
He fucked him steadily, entranced, overwhelmed. Draco dug his short nails into his back and held on.
“I’m ashamed,” he said against his skin. “I’m ashamed that you had to save me from a damn gaol. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay you.”
The front door opened. It was such a random, unexpected thing; Theo just turned to see what caused the noise.
. There was another illustration demonstrating the wand strokes - two counter clockwise rotations, then an upside down V motion.
“Please tell me he’s finally at peace,” Draco said, sipping a calming potion and ignoring his fresh tears.
“Perhaps you will understand one day,” she said, then looked back at Lady Granger. “How about you come for a weekend? I’m sure the duke would love to have you.”
Then, one day, Weasley asked him out on a date. Of course he didn’t call it a date, but Harry understood by the way his cheeks went pink. Weasley fumbled with his glasses, trying to sound casual.
The guest room was nicely decorated in soft colours and light woods. A fire crackled on the hearth. Harry stood by the fire and let the warmth seep into his bones. Millbank had made him very cold.
Potter leaned down and licked the wet from Draco’s cockhead; Draco stiffened and came all over himself. He felt Potter’s gaze on him, watching him come, and he tried to turn away.
Draco had a chuckle. “Brilliant, Carter, just brilliant. I hope your wives enjoy it. I do wish I could have given more …”
“You will find out that the Duke of Malfoy can be very, very naughty. Spread your legs for me, love. Yes, just like that.”
he thought. “Have you heard of the Married Women’s Property act? I believe it should be amended.” He said this to the men around him.
Malfoy fell into a hard, pounding rhythm. Their flesh smacked together, and it sounded loud and filthy in the lavish room.
Incensed, Draco growled. Potter put his hand on his shoulder, petting him again. He closed his eyes and started to drift off.
Potter remained by Mrs Gibbs’ side as they waited to see if the herbs eased her suffering. Draco didn’t know what to do with himself, and he could tell his presence stunted their conversation. He decided to go outside to check on his steed, perhaps discuss labour morale with Mr Gibbs.
In the deserted corridor, Draco rounded on Potter. Potter’s eyes went impossibly wide when he saw him.
Draco took a moment to look around before he went to the bed. The room was brighter than the rest of the house, less cobwebs, more lived-in. Potter’s clothes were strewn on the floor, because of course they were. A broom was propped up in a corner.
“My brother is still eager to work with you,” Ginny said, then hesitated. “He wanted me to tell you that he understands that you’ve made your choice and he’s ready to work with you in a professional capacity.”
“Shh,” Draco said, now tugging down Potter’s jeans. He fished Potter’s flaccid cock out of his Muggle underpants. He stroked him once, still not looking at him.
“You are obviously an intelligent man—a clever man, but you seem to lose your head when I’m around.”
Sighing, Draco buried his nose just behind Harry’s ear, breathing in his scent. He dropped kisses along his throat, loving how warm and soft he felt. Harry murmured and shifted closer. Draco raised his head so he could watch Harry’s eyes flutter open.
?” Harry was barely awake, but he was still shocked. He sighed and reclined further against his pillows. “Yes, all right. How could I say no to the duke?”
Harry fucked him harder and harder, the bed hitting the wall, disturbing some dust on the ceiling. Merlin, Draco hated this house.
“Brilliant.” Harry found he couldn’t tear his gaze away from Malfoy’s face. “Do you need anything else?”
No, he had to trust that Draco would yell for help if something terrible was happening. Draco still had his wand; he was still
Draco wanted to die along with Father. He wanted to not feel anything. He wanted there to be no more pain.
The director sweated in his chair. He looked so harassed that Harry almost felt bad for him. Almost.
“This time you escaped but what about tomorrow? Or the day after? They need a good thrashing. All of them. Their demands are sinful, unnatural. I’m sure that man was only giving his public support because he intended to do something wicked to those women, something very wicked.”
“Someone remind the group why we are here,” Granger said, standing like a sergeant in front of them. She rested her hands on her hips.
Harry was also using this time to research classic Greece. They intended to dock soon to give Harry a few weeks of access to the best classical archives the world had to offer.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, steadying himself. Just hearing the man’s voice made his body tighten.
Draco would understand, wouldn’t he? He would understand that Harry needed help to save him and or the baby.
Humming, Harry moved to suck and bite the other one. “You may do whatever you want to me,” Harry whispered.
“You still have a whole life ahead of you. It might not feel like it now, but you will find someone else, fall in love again. You will be happy. I promise, Draco.”
Potter shared a look with Mr Gibbs. “She’s suffering from stomach pains—cramps. She said she has a history of terrible menstruation pain but this time it was quite worse.”
“I’m not going to let you die,” Harry said fiercely. He was determined to help Malfoy in any way he could.
“No, you are not. I know this land like the back of my hand. It will take you at least another three hours on foot to reach Hawthorne.” The duke slapped his crop against his gloved hand again. “Now stop this silliness and mount up on my horse.”
when he did that, and Draco wanted to fall all over him … he wanted to put his hands on him, pull him close.
Parkinson was glaring at Granger as if she hoped to set the other woman on fire with her eyes. “Hello, Hermione,” she purred.
Unfortunately they were seated in direct eyesight of Potter and his date. Potter was looking around with interest, eyes bright, almost happy; then his gaze fell on Draco and he stiffened in his seat.
“Well,” said Miss Brown, thinking out loud, “there’s an election coming up. All the PMs will want to look accessible to the public. We will just need to ask for audiences with them.”
Secretly Harry disagreed. Draco was more stunning than ever. He virtually glowed now, and the extra weight looked good on him. All those faceless clients were eager to shag Draco because Draco was drop dead gorgeous. He was
“Malfoy.” Potter’s voice dripped with pity. He stood to tug his jeans back up. His belt made a loud noise as he buckled it. “I didn’t ask you around to shag you.”
Snorting, the duke offered Harry his hand. Harry looked around for a groom or a stable boy. When he confirmed they were alone, he took the duke’s hand.
Potter was quiet as he scraped his fork against his plate, picking up every last drop of gooey cheese. “I only know what it seems like on the outside. The only place I see you smile is in the canteen.”
“That doesn’t matter. What matters is what’s in your heart. I know you love me, Harry. And I know I love you.”
Draco pushed the door closed and sauntered inside. He’d gained weight since being released from Azkaban. His hair was freshly cut.
Inhaling a shuddering breath, Draco forced himself to look at the stage. Right, they were there for an opera. Right, Draco was in
Draco swore loudly, then fell into a muffled whimper. He grimaced in pain. “The baby’s coming. I can feel it.”
“I don’t judge you or anything,” Ginny said quickly. “My family is poor and I’ve got six other siblings. I was definitely teased about it in school.”
Groaning, Potter squeezed him through his trousers, his hand wrapped around the outline of his hard prick.
When Ronaldo was in the toilet and Harry was in his bedroom, Draco transformed back into a human and carefully stepped over the doggie gate. He crept down the hall to Potter’s office. He dropped into Potter’s chair and Spelled everything into position.
Theo stuffed his hands in his pockets, turned his face to the side. The dying sun made his skin look golden, his dark eyes a warm brown. His brown curls blew in the breeze.
Harry crouched, giving him a miraculous view of his arse. He pulled the gown from under the bed and shouldered it on. Tying it around his waist, he looked down at the floor, his cheeks aflame. “I thought we understood one another,” he said quietly.
“Lady Parkinson and I do not have a relationship,” Granger snapped, a red flush creeping up her neck. “We are merely acquainted, that is all.”
Draco let himself grind his teeth a little. “That will be nine sickles, sir.” Potter handed him the coins, their hands brushing. Draco ground his teeth harder.
They stared at another one in the day’s fading light. The duke’s white blond hair gleamed, his face flushed with colour. His eyes were the clearest grey Harry had ever seen.
Harry met his eyes and smiled. It was strange to make small talk with a man he wanted so thoroughly.
When Ron and Hermione had left, they put little Scorpius to bed, and wandered back down to the parlour for a cuddle in front of the fireplace.
“I will speak to the necessary people. Your tenants will get their barley and whiskey; you will get your cash. But you will promise to take over as leadership of the campaign; and you
Draco leaned in, brushed his lips against Harry’s cheek. “Do you even know what men do to me?” he whispered in his ear.
Draco advanced on him. He crowded him against the desk. He wanted to strangle Potter, he really did.
She quickly filled the lingering silence between them. “This concert—it’s a German duo. A soprano and a mezzo-soprano. Do you know German?”
“The instances of women suffering abuse are very small. Only a few instances happen each year. Most women are quite happy being under the control of men. They appreciate the protection.”
They were in the director’s office, and the director sat behind his desk. He wore a jacket, but it was open to reveal his pyjamas. The director had left bed just to address the problem that had brought the Duke of Malfoy to his penitentiary.
“You were right,” Potter murmured. “I shouldn’t have tried to walk to Hawthorne.” His face was pale, sweaty; his eyes were now barely open.
Snorting, Malfoy dug his fingers into Harry’s left cheek, searching for tightness. Harry’s eyes widened for a moment, then fell lidded.
Draco brushed a knuckle over his warm cheek. “Tell me what you want. It can be anything in the world.”
Lady Granger walked to the window. She stared out at the street, a frown on her face. “We appear poised to win the election, but I’m not so sure.”
She slinked closer to him. Her hair was a dyed red and her cleavage bulged from her dress. She was obviously a sex worker. Her eyes lit up when she saw his clothes. “Are you lost, sir?”
But he had to make haste to the nearest village. Their carriage had passed many on the way to Malfoy’s castle.
“Yes, but perhaps that acquaintance is enough to get us close to Malfoy. Maybe Lady Parkinson could invite us to tea and involve a group of the MPs … it would serve as the perfect opportunity for us to plead our case.”
“You are determined to head back to Oxford the moment the new year arrives. That means we only have a handful of days together. I’d rather not let them go to waste.”
Before he understood what was happening, he was in a physical altercation with the policeman, both of them throwing punches.
“Yes, Your Grace.” The director popped up from his chair and dashed to the door. “Please follow me, Your Grace.”
, Draco wanted to say, but that wasn’t entirely true. “It is the dukedom’s. I am merely its proprietor, its caretaker.”
Potter tugged off his clothes, utterly casual. He slipped underneath the duvet, his glasses now on the bedside table. His eyes looked too big without his glasses. Sighing, he smoothed his hand down Draco’s side, over and over, petting him just like he did when Draco was in dog form. He scratched behind Draco’s ear.
The night was chilly and snowy, but there were fires glowing along the balcony. Harry clutched the balustrade, the marble cold against his fingertips. He wished it was daytime, and he could gaze out at the sprawling beauty of the duke’s lands. His time at Malfoy Castle was coming to an end, and he wanted to cherish the exquisite scenery before he ventured back to Oxford.
“Ah, I believe you’re implying you would say you’re a suffragist just so you could enjoy the company of the women in the organisation?”
Malfoy pressed him against the wall and kissed him. “I wanted it,” he said again, more firmly. “I want
Draco looked down into his face. Potter’s eyes were a little glassy, a little faraway. His mouth was sinfully close. Without even thinking about it, Draco pressed his groin against Potter; he bit down a gasp: Potter had the beginnings of an erection.
They turned their attention to the little cakes, and Potter eyed them hungrily. Biting back a laugh, Draco cut an almond cake in half and gave a slice to Potter.
“No way!” Harry laughed again. It was like Malfoy was telling him his favourite subject had really been Care of Magical Creatures all along.
He knew now Malfoy was what he was looking for. He wanted Malfoy in a way he’d never wanted anyone. He would do anything to make Malfoy happy, to protect him. He would do anything to help him through this pregnancy.
Frowning, Harry closed his eyes. He snuggled closer, his nose pressed to Draco’s coat. Draco felt the tension slowly leave him.
“No! They are … pillocks! I hate them all.” Malfoy leaned close to whisper: “And I’m tired of taking orders from the Queen. I’m tired of doing her dirty work. I quit, I tell you!”
Using an army of towels, Draco got Harry all dry. He sank to his knees to run a towel down his legs, over his feet. Harry’s cock was now fully hard, so Draco took a moment to run his tongue along the shaft, over the head.
“Lady Greengrass,” drawled the duke, “I daresay your opinions are antiquated and have no place in my dining hall.”
Pansy lowered her voice. “Marriage won’t be so awful, you’ll see. People will leave you alone once you have a wife. You’ll have more privacy to do what you really want to do.”
Harry tried to pull his hands away, but Malfoy refused to let him go. “You shouldn’t be here. I made myself perfectly clear last time.”
Harry wanted to go straight to him, but he stopped himself. This was the duke’s party, and he had many, many guests to attend to. He didn’t need Harry hovering around him like a socially awkward ghost.
They glared at one another for a long moment, then both turned away to stare out the window. Harry knew he was being ridiculous; he knew he should be happy, but the overt display of the duke’s power had made him very uneasy, even if it had been for his benefit. Harry thought about all those poor boys and men locked up, how they hadn’t been lucky enough to attract a duke to help them. There was so much inequality in the world, and it made Harry grind his teeth.
Draco untied Potter’s horse from the tree and pulled himself into the saddle. Using the strength in his thighs to steady the horse, he reached down to Potter, offering him his arm. “Mount up behind me. There you go.”
“Hold tight,” Draco murmured, and a thrill shot through him when Potter’s arms wrapped themselves around his waist. Draco leaned back, wanting to feel every inch of Potter’s front. Potter’s groin was snug against his bum.
“Thank you,” Potter said, and retrieved both items. As Potter worked, Draco took up his chair next to the bed. Mrs Gibbs immediately went stiff.
After Harry pulled out, he took Draco into his mouth, sucking. Draco’s eyes rolled back, orgasm washing over him. “Harry,” he sighed, mostly to himself.
Harry thought, stretching in his chair. He needed to close his eyes for a moment—just for a moment. He rested his head on his folded arms. He fell asleep.
“How may I help you, sir?” Draco said with zero emotion in his voice. His gaze burned into Potter’s.
The stables were dark and quiet. Goyle looked to Draco for confirmation, and when Draco nodded his head, Goyle pushed his way through a side door.
“It’s not too bad, I don’t think. I just heard two old ladies gossiping about it while sampling the caviar. Did you really grow up in a barn?”
Leaving his chair, Draco marched over to the desk. He wasn’t quiet about it. The man must’ve been exhausted not to wake up.
Dinner was roasted chicken and veg. Draco sat close. He wanted to feed Harry, but he also didn’t want to go overboard with his care. He wrapped a blanket around Harry as Harry slowly ate some chicken.
Harry didn’t know where to put his hands. It had been so much easier when Malfoy was unconscious. “We need to get you to bed.”
“Well, it won’t do to explain in mixed company, but I have half a mind to declare myself a suffragist, too!”
Draco very much liked the idea of tracking old cousin Dudley down, but something told him Harry wouldn’t want Dudley involved. Afterall, Harry hadn’t run back to Kent.
“I admit it’s a bit self-serving.” Potter went to his favourite desk in the library and retrieved a handmade book. He gave it to Draco. “I’ve created a resource for you about women's suffrage.”
Harry knew from the old books that the colour for pregnancy was a deep violet. He cast the diagnostic spell again, this time focusing solely on Malfoy’s stomach. He let out a quiet sigh when he spotted the violet.
“The chicken—it melts like butter on the tongue. I’ve never tasted anything like it. You know, being poor and all.”
“Fuck,” Draco stuttered. Potter would make him come; he would make him come in his underpants, and Draco wouldn’t be able to clean himself up. He would have to go back to his seat … sit next to young, innocent Lady Greengrass, pretending that come wasn’t caking his cock to his underpants.
There was an explosion of colourful flowers. The flowers were open mouths, greedily sucking in bugs. Their petals were soft, luxurious, tempting.
Draco made eye contact with Potter, and raised an eyebrow. Potter shrugged, utterly unmoved. He knocked pleasantly on the door, then went inside.
“I see.” Weasley removed his glasses to clean them. “I suppose it all makes sense now. There was no way I could compete with a duke.”
Harry had to admire the Society’s pluck. Most people didn’t see anything wrong with women giving absolutely everything to their husbands, and convincing them otherwise would be an uphill battle. Harry was ready for the fight. He believed women should be equal to men in the eyes of the law. Every person should be equal.
“I didn’t, though. I didn’t because I wanted to be with you.” The shy, almost wounded look on Potter’s face nearly broke Draco’s heart.
Draco and Harry were even getting away with living together. There were whispers about them in the newspapers, but it was so coded that the common reader just thought Harry was Draco’s evil best friend who was stealing money from the dukedom and having affairs with every woman he came across.
Mr Gibbs raced out to take Draco’s tired steed. “Treat her well,” Draco ordered. “A tired horse is bound to make mistakes.”
“Please,” Draco said, voice cracking. He would be begging Harry for the rest of his life, he knew it now.
Draco sighed and took another sip of wine. “I was so jealous of you in second year when everyone thought you were the Heir of Slytherin.”
Harry was struck speechless. “That’s not how one decorates a nursery! Maybe Dracula, but not you or me.”
Harry lit some candles and helped Malfoy ease onto the bed. In the candlelight, Harry saw the extent of Malfoy’s injuries. His face was covered in blood.
“I understand,” Barwald said. “Well, I’ll see what I can do for her. Have you given anything to her for the pain?”
Draco met his eyes. He had no control over his expression, and he knew his jealousy showed plainly. Potter turned pink and looked away.
Granger pinned him with her sharp gaze. “Is it not true he has been spending every evening in this room with you?”
Weasley gave him a hesitant look. “I asked Harry to be my assistant. I asked him to go to Greece with me. At first he declined and said that he was still
Harry had his own opinions about the matter, but he kept quiet and ate the third course (a light salad with braised lamb).
He just couldn’t stop thinking about it: Draco with other men. Draco always looked flushed and rumpled when he arrived home. Sometimes he even looked like he’d enjoyed himself. It made Harry sick with jealousy, then it made him sick with guilt. So what if Draco sometimes enjoyed himself? Did it have to be all doom and gloom for a sex worker? Hell no! And it wasn’t as if Harry had verbalised how he felt. It wasn’t as if Draco was
Malfoy moved away momentarily to retrieve a jar of lubrication from his bedside drawer. He slicked up his fingers generously, then pressed one to Harry’s hole.
“I love you,” Harry said, tears stinging his eyes. He wrapped his hand around his cock, stroking himself desperately. “Fuck, I’m so in love with you.” He spilled over his working hand, dripping on Malfoy’s stomach.
Harry turned, and caught his breath. The duke stood tall in a shadowy archway, his grey eyes glinting in the dark. Harry couldn’t make out his face, not really, but he saw the pulse of his jaw, the white flesh of his neck. The duke’s mahogany scent reached for him.
“The thing is … I have this extra ticket to the Royal Albert Hall. It’s an opera, of course. I don’t know. I thought perhaps you would care to join me?” There was hope in Weasley’s voice.
Draco wondered about the topic of the book. How to hoodwink a duke? How to steal from the aristocracy without getting caught? How to be the most beautiful man in the room without even trying?
Malfoy took several quick steps toward him, then stopped. The look on his face was barely suppressed possession.
Harry dragged his thumb over Malfoy’s nose, feeling for any tender spots. “Were you hit on the nose?”
They sat down in two wooden chairs with a shimmering barrier between them. Potter wore his scarlet Auror robes. His eyes were dark like river moss. He looked angry and Draco wondered if Potter would curse him.
Draco had just been looking for a tasty milk bone. He was so hungry for something hard in his mouth.
“A cup of tea would be nice,” Potter said once he realised Draco wasn’t going to say anything else. He looked Draco up and down, seemingly sizing him up.
Draco took up his hand and kissed his palm, his fingertips. His hands were covered in old blisters. “I don’t want to talk about politics right now. We can talk about it later, but right now I want to focus on making you feel better.” He glanced up and found Harry gazing at him with tenderness.
“Lean forward for me,” Harry said, voice gentle. Malfoy bit his lip and leaned forward, a bit of his blond fringe falling across his forehead. Harry washed his back, moving his hand in slow, soothing circles.
“Why?” Then Draco saw what he meant: Harry was covered in scrapes and bruises. His knees were bloody. Draco felt a surge of protective rage. “Who did this to you?”
Harry was in mid-stride when the Floo flared to life and Draco stepped out of the fireplace. Harry just blinked at him.
It turned out Ginger Hagrid was a screamer between the sheets, and Draco had had enough. He transformed back into a man. Nude, he marched down the hall to Potter’s closed bedroom. He intended to kick the door open. He intended to punch Ginger Hagrid right in the face, but then he had an idea.
They added the little sugary cakes to the tree, then lit some candles and carefully placed them in holders on the branches.
Draco looked down at his hands. He didn’t know where he wanted this conversation to go, not really. He just wanted to get under Potter’s skin, make him squirm and blush and stutter.
Draco worked his mouth, trying to find a way to explain. “Personally, I am not. But I know what a bad winter can do to worker morale, even in the country. It would cost me loads more in the long run if I don’t prepare now. Upheaval is never cheap.”
Potter’s cock thickened. He liked what was happening. A desperate flush spilled down his chest. Draco made space for himself between Potter’s legs. He touched Potter’s warm thigh, then the delicate skin of his groin. He leaned down and kissed the places he touched. Potter’s breath stuttered.
The second photograph was taken on their wedding day. Harry had wanted to get married at Hogwarts, and so they had with the summery Forbidden Forest as a backdrop to the ceremony. Draco remembered how Harry’s eyes had glowed in the setting sun, how they shined with tears when Draco slipped the ring on his finger.
Potter sighed. “The problem is women don’t report their abuse. Men like you will get up in Parliament and shout numbers that just aren’t true. Your precious statistics don’t represent the lived experience of women.”
Draco was afraid to touch anything. He was sitting in his own home but he was afraid to disturb even the air. Harry was now erasable.
Harry felt the duke’s warm stomach against his hands, felt his muscular back against his chest. The speed and velocity of their journey forced the duke back, his bottom pressed right up against Harry’s groin. There his shapely bottom stayed, virtually grinding against Harry as the horse galloped beneath them.
He noticed that she didn’t call him sir. He must stick out like a sore thumb here. “Everything is … good.” He carefully stepped into his lavishly decorated room.
Harry wore the emerald coat gifted to him by the duke. He felt stupid admitting it, but the coat made him feel more confident, and he needed all the confidence he could get with what they were about to do.
“Yeah ... the coffee is awful here but it’s close to where I work.” Theo put his hand on the empty chair.
A terrible silence fell between them. Finally, Malfoy said, “I won’t come back if that’s what you want. I can find a room in Knockturn. I will be all right.”
“No.” Draco put his back to the window and stalked closer to the bed again. “Especially not when we are alone in your room.”
For a moment, Harry’s green eyes were glazed over with drowsiness, then his expression cleared. He didn’t smile.
!” Potter yelled as the horse jumped a small, frozen stream. He pressed his face to Draco’s neck, trying to hide from the world.
“Some of it happened when I was at work, but after I lost my job, there was a man who wanted my shoes … it was quite the scuffle.”
Harry wrung his hands in his lap. His heart was beating fast. “I’m trying to make the right decision for both of us.”
They stopped in a small clearing to give their horses a break. Potter was distant, his smile now wiped clean off his face. He seemed to want to flinch when Draco moved too close.
Their end of the table fell silent. Everyone suddenly became quite interested in their roasted chicken with almonds and cream.
with Malfoy. He knew there were loads of things that Malfoy didn’t want to discuss. He just wished he could …
He was nearly giddy when he reached the library that held Potter. He threw open the doors, startling the young man just as he had startled poor Goyle.
After his terrible day, Harry slumped back on the bed, and closed his eyes. He felt bone tired, utterly exhausted. Sleep overwhelmed him, even though he lay defenceless in a duke’s bed, his wet cock left out for any servant to see.
The duke held court in the middle of the room. He wore a formal black suit with a top hat. A diamond pin glinted in the silk cravat tied around his elegant neck. Harry felt his mouth go dry. It felt almost sinful to look at the duke, especially when he was dressed so sharply.
Malfoy stepped even closer. He raised his hands to kiss his ink stained knuckles. “I’m in love with you, Harry Potter. Please marry me.”
Under the table, Draco held his wand. He was ready for a fight. He wanted to hurt Theo; he wanted revengeance.
“He got my nose!” Ronaldo said. There was a lot of blood, and Draco felt quite satisfied with himself.
Potter inclined his head. Draco stared at his unruly locks, feeling a touch peevish. Why must Potter be so
Potter shook his head. He was pacing like he had in the conservatory. “I confess I can barely look at you.”
The man was curled on his side, no jacket, no shoes. He faced away from Draco, but there was something about the shoulders that looked familiar. Yes, and the hair. The raven locks were thick and wild, slightly curled. Dear Lord,
Draco came with a muffled cry. His hand was a blur on his cock, his semen gushing over his knuckles, splattering his bedding. The servant would see—let him see. Let them all see what Potter did to him.
“I see.” Draco couldn’t stop a chill creeping into his tone. For a moment, he wondered at his own bravery. “Is that why you murdered him?”
She looked him up and down, and he knew her sharp gaze didn’t miss a single detail about his appearance. “Lady Granger and Miss Brown were just telling me how you dared to approach the Duke of Malfoy like he was a mere mortal.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, his voice sounding like a warning. Harry moaned again and again; Malfoy didn’t stop. He moved to his other cheek, adding even more pressure.
It was half past one when Malfoy stepped from the Floo. Malfoy looked a little rumpled, his face still a little flushed. Harry forced himself into a chair.
, Draco thought viciously. Surely she would understand that Potter was in no state to help out her silly cause. For Professor Wealsey—whoever he was—Draco would speak to him personally if he tried to penalise Potter for not completing his work when he was this unwell.
Harry couldn’t help but stare at him. His face was clean-shaven and smooth like porcelain. His nose was both strong and delicate, with a faint point at the end. His chin had the same quality, perhaps more delicate than his nose. His eyes were the most captivating grey, the colours of a storm brewing in a dark blue sky. There was something forbidden, something
Draco pulled away with great effort. He gasped for breath, his hands still pining Potter to the wall. “You can have me, Harry. Let it happen. Let yourself get what you want.”
When Harry woke up, he lay in Malfoy’s arms. Malfoy idly played with his hair, curling his finger around his locks.
Draco scrubbed the muck from every part of Harry’s body, then thoroughly washed his hair. When he was done, Harry was pink all over. He was fidgeting. Draco helped him stand up, the water trailing down his body. His cock was half hard.
, he wanted to say, but he couldn’t. She had too much power, and he couldn’t trust her to not be offended. He didn’t want to do anything that would embarrass the duke.
feel lost. He’d lacked direction since the end of the war. He didn’t want to become an Auror; he didn’t want to be a professor. He wanted to live in Grimmauld Place, with a family. He wanted to be domestic and sheltered and
“Good,” Malfoy said, his beautiful mouth curling in a smirk. Harry nearly fainted; that smirk was pure gorgeous filth.
“Yes, Your Grace! We’ve tried to have Everton come out to take a look at her, but he won’t budge for nothing under a pound, and we don’t have … well, let’s just say his asking is a tad high for us.”
Goyle nodded in approval. “Yes, Your Grace. Let me make the inquiries. I rather not empty your pockets just yet.”
“With any luck, Doctor Barwald will be at your residence in a handful of hours,” Draco said, still astride his steed.
Then the curses started flying, brilliant colours slicing through the air. Draco wished he could turn his head; he wished he could react. He heard thundering footsteps, a shouted
When he arrived in town, he wasted no time finding work. From dawn to dusk, he mucked horse stalls in St Giles. After months of being an academic, he wasn’t used to such strenuous labour. He felt his body start to give out. He only managed to send Dudley a couple days’ pay before he was too weak to get up and go to work. He lost his job and his shelter, and then he found himself living on the streets.
“Wait!” cried the young rider. “The Duke of Malfoy ordered me to come fetch you. I must return with you.”
Harry could come from this if he stroked himself, but he remained obedient and left his poor cock untouched.
Leaving Weasley’s office, Harry rushed outside to the street. The day was cold and his lousy coat did little to protect him. He raced for the Randolph Hotel.
He was lost and didn’t know how to work his way back to Diagon Alley. He was stuck between two damp alleys; he turned in a circle, looking for anything he recognised. The windows were blind. The doorways mere shadows. He smelled the reek of rubbish.
Face flushed, Harry stood in front of him. He cupped Draco’s chin and kissed him deeply. Draco gazed up at him worshipfully.
The canteen served early dinner and Draco’s shift went until seven so he could help clean everything up. He called in sick just so he would be available at five.
Harry spent the day reading in his bedroom with the door open so he’d hear clearly if Malfoy cried out or fell trying to walk. He copied down a few promising diagnosis spells; but there was a risk because the Blacks’ books were outdated by over a century. Harry hoped he didn’t harm Malfoy in the process of trying to figure out what was wrong with him.
Such thoughts had no business being in Draco’s head. He would never escape the scrutiny that came with his peerage. He could never live quietly with another man. He would
Draco was sweaty when he made it back to the Gibbs house. Once again, he was struck by how small it was. Thankfully, a thin stream of smoke now issued from their chimney. Good. He needn’t have to sack Carter after all.
Why had he done something so stupid? They could have been found out … he could have ruined both of their lives in one fell swoop. It was terrifying.
Harry was considering takeaway when Malfoy came down the stairs. Harry dropped the biscuit he’d been munching on when he spotted Malfoy.
“Harry,” Draco said softly, turning onto his side. “Has it ever occurred to you that you rarely think of yourself?”
The duke’s face softened just a little. “You are Lady Parkinson’s guest. Therefore, my guest. And you will be treated as such.”
Harry had thought they had months to plan for the birth. He had gathered all the relative spell books on a table … but he hadn’t read through them. He dropped down in a chair and sternly told himself not to panic.
Watching his face, Harry eased his fingers inside Draco. Draco’s mouth fell open; his hand came down to tug his desperate cock.
Draco took a few steps back, giving Potter space to breathe, gather his thoughts. “What does a proper Christmas mean to you?”
Draco took up his warm palm and pressed a kiss to it. He suddenly didn’t want to look at Harry. “What is it?” he whispered.
He wanted to kiss Malfoy so softly. He wanted to hold him. He wanted to undress him gently. He wanted to kiss and lick and suck until Malfoy understood, until he was desperate. Then Harry would thrust so carefully into him; he would hold him and caress him; he would whisper to him that he was valuable, beautiful, perfect. Then, when Malfoy was ready, he’d fuck him so hard that even the boggarts in the attic would hear them.
“‘Soft and tasty’?” said Lady Greengrass. “In all my life, I’ve never heard of a chicken described that way.”
“He is,” Trelawney said, and she touched a bejeweled hand to her chest. “I felt him leave when Theodore died. He refused to cross over until he knew you were safe.”
Draco nearly stopped. “You’ve made yourself perfectly clear that you do not wish to be in my company. I will take my leave and let you make your own choices.”
With his mouth pressed to the wet tile, Harry came hard, his toes curling, his mouth falling open. The water washed away his spunk.
“I bet you’re ready to go to bed. You’ve had a long day, haven’t you? Go get your milk bone, then we can go to bed. Go on.”
So Harry and the other suffragists stalked the halls of Parliament, dropping in on unexpected members. They were equipped with scripts and statistics. They had enough leaflets to fill an entire carriage.
Harry touched where the man had held him. He could still feel the man’s strong, elegant fingers gripping his flesh. “Yes, of course I am. The gentleman just wasn’t interested.”
Had this gorgeous stranger promised her something? Perhaps she thought they were sweethearts; perhaps she thought he would make love to her. The idea made Draco tremble in his chair.
“You—you are immoral! Let’s go to the police! I have things to tell them as well!” Dursley slapped his chest pocket.
Draco glared at the other man. He had awful flaming red hair; it reminded him of someone. Oh, yes, that Miss Weasley. The man was probably Professor Percy Weasley, the same man whom Draco had written to about Potter’s illness. Draco wanted to jump to his feet and throttle the man.
Harry wanted to respond, but they both knew the answer. Dudley would probably swindle him for the rest of his life. Secrets always cost something.
They lay on the small bed together. Harry turned his head to capture Draco’s lips in a kiss. “Will you let me fuck you?”
After he’d confirmed he was alone, Draco closed his eyes and stroked himself. Of course he thought of Mr Harry Potter, Oxford student, male suffragist, gorgeous creature.
Potter’s hands kneaded his shoulders. Potter was shaking hard. “Please,” he said. “Please don’t hurt me.”
But Draco knew enough about mass-produced magical items, knew the strength of their charms. Those needles could easily go for eternity without help from Harry.
Draco caressed Harry’s cheek with a thumb. “If it involves me, shouldn’t I know? I need to protect myself, Harry.”
“What? But—” Harry lay back against his pillows, his head spinning. When he spoke, his voice was once again faint, “I have too much to do. I can’t go to
Draco slowly, teasingly removed his clothes. He was hard and needy, and Harry stared hungrily at him.
“Yes,” Draco said, trying to act casual but secretly quite pleased he had impressed Potter. “I want to make quite a few changes in how my tenants are treated.”
“Yes, it is.” Draco came around his fortress. He looked at Potter closely, and was pleased to find him looking rested. “Have you been here long?”
He heard another set of footsteps, different from Pansy’s. He swerved around, wand at the ready. Theodore Nott raised his hands.
Potter scrubbed his face. “You already know about my past. You know how I’ve been hurt. I went to Oxford to flee all that … to become someone new, someone in control of themselves. Then I met you, a
When Draco reached his cock (and it was such a nice cock), Draco dragged his tongue along the shaft, waking it up. Potter jackknifed.
Later, once he was washed and dressed, he tried to sneak past the dining hall but a voice called out to him. He halted, closing his eyes, taking a deep breath. He turned around to see Lady Granger approaching him.
The guests in the music room began to move to the dining room, which had been transformed. Even more crystal hung from the chandelier, along with garland and berries. Snow dusted the window sills, the enormous ornate carpet. Harry touched some of the wet substance and confirmed it was real snow.
“God,” Harry whispered, unable to contain the whimper that bubbled up. He thrust, watching his red cock move between those fingers, pushing back his foreskin.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry said, stilling. Draco’s laughter turned into moans. He felt Harry coming inside him, a deep, deep throb.
Harry gave Granger a grateful smile before following the servant away from the entrance hall. He tried not to let all the opulent furnishings intimidate him. The portraits on the walls watched him with hostile disinterest.
Lady Parkinson waited for them at the castle’s entrance steps. “Welcome to the Duke of Malfoy’s home,” she said, eyes twinkling. She held out her hand to Lady Granger, who took it after a moment of hesitation.
At least Harry’s health was improving. After a few days, he was even healthy enough to have more visitors in his bedroom.
The guards let him clean his face and hands, let him put on a clean pair of robes, before they led him into a visitation room.
Granger shrugged. “Everything in this castle belongs to him. He doesn’t wear these items of clothing, if that’s what you mean. He has wardrobes such as these for his guests.”
He took the empty chair next to Ginny and Miss Brown. He eagerly snatched up a crumpet and slathered on clotted cream. He hadn’t eaten all day; his pockets were empty and his days were filled with a marathon of classes and research and tutoring. He was lucky enough to have a few tutoring jobs, but they paid very little and sucked up his energy. His stomach growled loud enough for others to hear. He forced himself to slow down as he chewed.
Potter was breathing hard. Underneath the table, Draco pressed his foot against Potter’s, expecting him to move away. He didn’t.
More shouts and boos. Members jumped up and down, brandishing their fingers at him, their hats toppling off their heads.
Harry came around the desk. He approached Draco like a predator. Draco stumbled back, a hot flush on his face.
Gaping, Harry staggered inside. He nearly dropped everything in his arms. The library was breathtaking, immense. He’d never seen so many books in his life.
They left the fields and headed for Gibbs’ house, Draco and Potter on horseback, Gibbs on foot. When they made it to the house, Draco tried to see it from Potter’s perspective, and knew the structure came up short. It looked more like a shed than a home.
For several days after his return to Oxford, all Harry could do was sit in his gloomy letted room, and stare at the emerald coat the duke had given him.
Burying his hand in Potter’s soft, unruly locks, Draco urged his head back as he took command of the kiss. He kissed Potter like he meant it, like he had been desperate for it. He wanted Potter to know how much he wanted him.
Theo laughed, and it was such a terrible sound. His footsteps crunched on broken glass; Draco could barely see his outline; it appeared Theo was posed in the hole in the window, ready to jump.
He spent two lonely nights in the pound, curled up in a corner, shivering with cold, aching for company. Then the visitor door opened, and a man laughed his way into the room.
What he didn’t understand was why Parkinson would want him to know. It made him suspicious. He didn’t want someone like her to confide in him, especially when her biggest enemy appeared to be the person who decided whether or not Harry kept his scholarship.
!” Green light shot above Draco’s face. He heard something heavy fall backward, breaking more glass. It was Theo, falling through the window. The killing curse had found its target.
The feelings rushing through Draco felt like a door opening; it felt like a revelation, a turning point.
“We were all so worried about you,” Granger said. “Please know that you can always come to us if you need help, any help at all.”
The corridors were darker now, colder; there were no windows, but Harry was sure it was nighttime. They ascended several staircases until they reached an impressive office with double doors.
Theo felt Draco freeze up and broke the kiss. He brushed his thumb against Draco’s cheek, his dark eyes tender. “All right?”
Harry sat back in his chair. He forced himself to relax. When he was sure his voice wouldn’t tremble, he said casually, “I will think of something, don’t you worry. Right now, though, I think it’s time for me to go inside. I’ve got loads of things to do today.”
The ladies stared at one another. Harry crossed his arms and gazed up at the ceiling, thinking hard.
“You hardly ever have parties, Malfoy. It’s never good to be unsocial, to reject merriment. When I was a young girl, your family’s New Year's Eve parties were renowned. Your grandfather knew how to hold such splendid gatherings. I especially enjoyed the fireworks.”
“Oh, no. That’s not it at all. If you must know, it’s the dress. I’m not used to you wearing anything besides your spinster garb.”
“When we arrive you should go straight to your room and lie down. We don’t want your constitution to fail when you see the duke.”
The servant left. The man fell back against the wall, nearly becoming one with the shadows. It was rather odd how servants made themselves invisible around the duke.
The duke closed the space between them. He took off his top hat and rested it on the railing. His hair glimmered like the snow.
Next to him, Parkinson smirked like a cat a second away from a deadly pounce. Harry tried to keep his gaze down, not make eye contact with anyone, but as if summoned, the duke looked right at Harry. Harry didn’t smile. He couldn’t.
Sighing, Weasley stepped back. He met Harry’s gaze. “I’m a realistic man, Harry. I know that our hearts don’t always cooperate. I know that these things can take time. But think of all the brilliant research we could accomplish together. You want a future in the Classics, yes? I could help you open so many doors.”
Harry went to the door and knocked softly. For a moment, all that greeted him was silence, but then the door inched open.
“Yes. His name is … well, it doesn’t matter what his name is. He’s a little shorter than me. Black hair. Glasses.”
“Stop,” Harry said, mouth trembling. He stared out the window again. He didn’t want to look at the duke. He couldn’t. After a few minutes of silence, he asked, “Where are we going?”
In the locker rooms, he tore off his kit and guards, and stepped into a private shower. He stood for a long moment under the spray of the water, letting the heat relax his muscles. Noise was dulled. His thoughts were calming down.
Whimpering, Harry dropped his hand. His cock was stiff, so desperate. Malfoy continued to lick him from bollocks to hole, over and over. The stubble on Malfoy’s chin grazed against his inner cheeks. It was so intimate.
Draco fucked him hard, rocking the chair. Harry tipped his head back and moaned loudly. No one was around to hear. They were free to love as openly as they wished.
Now Draco was in the dog pound, and he was lonely. None of the other dogs wanted to be his friend. They knew he wasn’t right; they knew he wasn’t like them. A bulldog named Gobbler wouldn’t stop shooting him evil glares.
“Yes, of course,” Draco said gruffly, and forced himself to continue walking. His mind was reeling. Potter was here with another man—quite possibly a date. Draco ground his teeth.
He tipped his head back, eyes fluttering. His eyelashes were dark and long. His cheeks were stained.
“Yes, you do. All men want comfort. Deep down inside, you want a Mummy who will kiss your forehead and tuck you in at night.”
“Yes,” Draco said, and captured his lips in a kiss. Harry moaned and opened his mouth; their tongues moved together. The sensation made Draco whimper in need.
Draco had been happy too; so damn happy. Towels were stupid, so stupid. His world was full of light when Harry was with him.
“I don’t think they are acceptable. I said as much when speaking to the director. First thing tomorrow morning, I will write to the board, demand a meeting with them.”
They found themselves in Potter’s bed again - starkers again. Draco twisted beneath him, needing more, needing so much more. Eye contact was a challenge.
Draco fell to his knees beside the man. He gently turned him over. The man was unconscious, very pale. He looked like he hadn’t eaten in a few days.
“I’m afraid not, Your Grace.” Gibbs thought for a moment. “I’ve got a piece of coal … a bit of newspaper. That should do.” He went inside to fetch these things and promptly came back.
“We’ve got a pestle and mortar in the wardrobe,” Mrs Gibbs said, her colour looking better due to good cheer.
“Oh, yes! I come from the Wayfair stock. Good people. We’ve been working for the Duke of Malfoy since the beginning of the eighteenth century. That’s not our century but the one before us.”
“Draco,” Harry said, and raised up, then sat back down. Malfoy filled him up nicely, his arse stretched and aching. Harry rested his weight on Malfoy’s chest, then began to ride him oh so slowly.
Malfoy ate slowly, methodical. The sun made his hair honey-colour. He seemed a little shy, which was weird since it was Malfoy. Harry had thought Malfoy was incapable of being shy.
Potter grabbed his arse and urged him closer, so close. Potter thrust up, trying to meet Draco’s desperate hips. The feeling of their clothed cocks pressing together was addicting.
Malfoy came at him until he was pressed against the wall. He poked Harry in the chest hard, then dragged his finger down until it met his belt. “Merlin, Potter. You are such an innocent.”
After his shower, he wrapped a towel around his waist and ventured to another room. The room was dark, muted, with a lovely sage and lavender scent in the air.
Whining, Harry quickened his thrusts. He was Harry now. Forever. Draco felt a tear roll down his cheek, sneak along his ear.
Goyle shrugged. “He’s not from town, but he knows how to survive. I reckon his heart is too big for his own good.”
“Yes and no. When I was a very young man, there was a summer when I made it a habit of visiting, how should I say this, a house that lacked respectability. People found out, and I had my men quickly squash the story.”
It was Pansy’s turn to sigh. “Oh, yes. Very unpredictable.” Her voice had turned a touch mournful. Pansy very much still carried a torch for Lady Granger.
, Draco thought, relieved. Pocketing his wand, he headed to work. The trailing footsteps didn’t return.
Harry just sat there, worrying his bottom lip. Draco threw his arms up. “I can’t stand you!” Draco yelled. “You are the most infuriating man to live with!”
Laughing dully, Potter pulled away. “There. I’ve told you my truth. Now you know you should stay away from me.”
The library doors opened and Parkinson and Granger strolled inside. They were pink-faced and grinning at each other. Potter noticed the change between them.
Harry’s gaze trailed up and down Malfoy’s revealed body. Malfoy was right - most of the bruising had disappeared, and much of his cuts and scrapes had healed. But Harry was distracted by how his pale, pale skin was pink from exertion, how blond hair trailed from his belly button into his trousers. Malfoy’s stomach was still mostly flat, but Harry fancied he could see the beginnings of a pregnancy bump.
Draco had decided to give every one of his tenants a bundle of firewood for Christmas. It would have been a headache to organise even if they had months; however, Draco told Carter he had merely a day.
Holding his hand, Harry helped Malfoy lower into the soothing water. Malfoy slumped back and closed his eyes.
“Yes,” he whispered, and urged Potter onto his back. He dragged his mouth along Potter’s neck, tasting his pulse. “Yes.”
He wanted to drag his mouth down Malfoy’s neck, taste his warm, clean skin. He wanted to reach beneath the water and wrap his hand around his …
Once again, they had spent the day working in the garden, and Malfoy had a pink sunburn on his nose.
, Harry thought, then felt guilty. Malfoy was a victim, wasn’t he? He’d been beaten up by a client for crying out loud. Thinking about him with those men shouldn’t arouse Harry … it should appal him, plain and simple.
They rode for nearly an hour, crossing all of Draco’s snow-licked fields. His tenants were out, working the land. The ground wasn’t barren, even with a blanket of snow. There was still much to pull from the fertile dirt.
“We will need to crush them, but they look good.” Potter gave him a shy smile. “Thank you, Your Grace.”
“Then find another aristocratic woman. But you cannot be with me.” Harry moved toward the door, but Draco blocked him. Draco reached out, wanting to pull him into an embrace, but Harry stopped him.
In a shocking twist, Draco had survived his Parliament scandal well. The Liberals won the election, and Draco now worked alongside them to implement legal reforms.
Lady Parkinson pretended not to notice. Her eyes drifted back to Harry, who was busy preparing his second crumpet for consumption. “I’m not surprised Mr Potter made a splash with the duke.”
Potter looked unconvinced. “I confess it’s not my favourite thing to do. It’s why I ran away to Oxford.”
Potter pushed past him, leaving him alone in the dark antechamber. Draco wanted to go after him, but he didn’t. He let Potter walk away.
“Wow,” Potter said once Draco had spread out beside him. There was wonder in his eyes. “I had no idea anything could feel so good.”
A terrible, sickening thought occurred to Draco. “Did you stay because Granger requested it of you?”
Not for the first time, Draco wished he had a photograph of Harry. He shared a look with Goyle, and Goyle shrugged.
“Yes,” Granger said carefully, a touch annoyed, “but that’s only because the Queen requested it of him. He doesn’t
“Cousin, please be reasonable,” Harry said calmly. “Think about what it would mean to have an Oxford graduate in the family. I could make boatloads of money and send a fair portion back to you.”
Draco smiled a little. “I do like it when I serve members of the Wizengamot. They tried to throw me into Azkaban, but now I’m serving them tea, utterly free.”
“He could go to the press … your secrets could be splashed across a nasty rag for even the Queen to read.”
Potter squirmed beneath Draco’s gaze. His hands trailed down to hide himself; Draco grabbed his wrists.
He found Malfoy on the floor of the hallway. “Shit,” he said, and rushed to help him up. He wrapped Malfoy’s arm over his shoulder and together they staggered to the loo.
. The men … it doesn’t surprise me in the least that they act barbaric in their homes. Have you seen how they act out in the streets, where anyone can see them?”
Finally Weasley looked him in the eye. He stepped closer and Harry ignored the urge to move back. “Harry …” His voice was very quiet.
. And—now that Harry’s brain had finally caught up—he understood that the man had looked at him with
Theo’s face hardened. “But then you went ahead and married Potter. I couldn’t believe it when I found out. The irony was I had always intended to kill Potter. You just became the prize after the deed was complete.”
Chaos erupted among the MPs. Harry yelled too. He was on his feet, nearly climbing over the half-wall. Draco looked over and caught his eye.
A strange, brief expression came over Draco’s face. “Are you disappointed?” Draco said, giving him a slight smirk. “Expecting a hot date?”
“My intention is to make my way to the nearest village. I believe I’m only an hour or two away from my destination.”
Hours later, they returned home. Ronaldo smelled intensely of Potter, and it took everything in Draco not to growl at him.
A whimper escaped from the darkness. Harry paused and raised his wand. The whimper had come from one of the alleys.
In Draco’s bedroom, he laid Harry on the settee by the fire. Harry’s teeth were chattering. He looked so pale.
Lady Granger and Ginny were nice enough to visit him. They had tea in the parlour, the servants barred from entering. Harry sipped his tea and avoided their eyes.
Goyle rushed to move a chair close to the bed. Draco sat down, fiddling with his jacket. He smoothed his hand down his front.
Their goal for the day was to hand out as many leaflets as possible. The leaflets decried the Married Women’s Property Act:
Draco cried out—loud. Harry clapped a hand over his mouth. “We aren’t in your gigantic castle,” Harry whispered. “You must be very, very quiet for me, or you’ll alert the landlord.”
Harry tore through the first book, then the second. When he didn’t find anything about male pregnancy, he considered fire-calling Hermione for help.
Marriage to a woman wouldn’t be intolerable. He would perform his husbandly duties with little problem. It would just be … lonely, empty. Deep down inside, Draco knew he could never love a woman like he wanted to love a man. Especially any of the society debutantes that would be pushed his way at the party. Daughters of the aristocracy were bred to mould themselves into whatever their husbands wanted them to be. They could barely speak around Draco. They
Draco marched back into the house and laughter greeted him. It looked like Potter and Mrs Gibbs were having a delightful conversation.
“The snow hadn’t started yet, but yes, I tried to outpace the storm. Obviously, I wasn’t successful.”
Harry stepped back another step, but the duke closed the space between them. “Good evening, Your Grace.”
“Good, you’ve come,” Malfoy said to the man. They shared a look, and the man glanced at the servant and motioned to the door.
Weasley gave him another hesitant smile. “I'm glad you think so.” He cleared his throat loudly. “Harry, I’ve been thinking …” Weasley looked down at the floor nervously, and Harry saw how the back of his neck was red.
Strained, Malfoy muttered something, then pulled his fingers out. He smeared lubricant on himself, then pressed the blunt head of his cock to Harry’s hole.
The flat was dark when they stepped inside. Draco kicked the door closed and dropped the takeaway on the nearest table.
Potter’s laugh was self-conscious. “Yeah, I do. But let’s go down to the kitchen. Dinner is waiting.” He grabbed Draco’s wrist and urged him to follow.
The building was squat and blackened, its windows punched-out eyes. The entire place reeked of desperation.
In the carriage, Dursley huddled in a corner, sweaty, alarmed. His eyes went wide when Draco slid into the seat opposite him. Goyle took his place next to Dursley, close enough to harm him.
“You received a letter from the Prince of Wales,” Harry said with interest. He handed over the letter to Draco.
Draco heard a terrible screeching in his ears—like a locomotive a second away from crashing. “You have formed many assumptions about me.”
Malfoy blinked up at him, eyes a little dazed. “All right,” he said, though his tone was strange. Harry couldn’t make out what it meant.
Harry couldn’t look away. His hand was so elegant, so refined; he stroked him again, his thumb sweeping over the head, gathering the wet there.
“I don’t have time to rest,” he answered truthfully. He patted the bag he brought along with him. “Professor Weasley’s correspondence to the Mediterranean dig urgently needs to be translated. And I have about a thousand hours of reading to complete in two days.”
He just couldn’t stay there any longer staring at Harry’s casket. He heard Pansy chase after him but he didn’t stop for her. She meant well, she really did, but he needed to be alone. He couldn’t handle her pity right now.
Potter got to his feet slowly. His gaze was hesitant behind his glasses. Draco framed his face and kissed him.
Draco slumped down on his settee, still holding his face. He couldn’t stop crying. It’d been months and months since Harry’s death; he thought he was healing; he thought he was beginning to move on. The pain was unbearable.
God, Draco loved hearing Harry say his name. He quickened his thrusts, but just a little. He built up his strokes, watching every reaction on Harry’s face. Harry looked taken, overwhelmed.
, he slipped out from the bedroom and wandered to the hallway toilet. When he caught sight of Draco in the bathtub, he screamed bloody murder.
on his lips; but Theo was faster. His blinding white spell hit Draco in the stomach. Draco collapsed on the old carpet.
Goyle helped Draco identify places where Harry could be hiding out. “He’s probably in a rookery,” Goyle said, tone mild.
On the road the trees parted to reveal a grand estate. Harry peered out the window in awe. A large residence rose up from the ground, its stone facade sun-licked. It sat on a slight incline, its countless windows spying on the duke’s countless miles of land. Clouds were fast approaching.
It felt like a fantasy, like a daydream; what had occurred at Malfoy Castle couldn’t possibly be real.
“Is that what people are saying?” He looked at Lady Granger, then at Ginny, his heart thudding in his chest. Their bland expressions told him everything he needed to know. “I see,” he said softly.
The waiter returned with their drinks. Draco took a sip of his little glass of wine. “Tastes like piss,” he said.
This obsession … it should’ve made him weary. It should’ve put him on guard. Obviously, he couldn’t let Potter get too close;
Harry shifted in his seat. He’d rather be anywhere else than sitting next to Parkinson. He found the strange tension between Granger and Parkinson quite alarming. They were two women with a lot of power, playing an aristocratic game he didn’t understand.
Officially, they were not supposed to be there. Their permit for a demonstration had not been approved, but Lady Granger had insisted that they still go through with their plan.
“Yes, Your Grace.” The servant turned her kind eyes to Harry. “Come along, sir. We will prepare your room now.”
Harry worried his bottom lip, mind turning. “Yes,” he said finally. “Even if he had no desire to marry … surely social expectation would’ve forced his hand by now?”
As they stood close gazing at the flower, Malfoy brushed his hand against Harry’s. He said in a soft, hot voice, “
“Yes, well, even a duke does foolish things.” Malfoy set down the flannel, took up a bowl of broth. He dipped the spoon into the broth, then pressed the spoon to Harry’s lips.
“Mr Potter, do enjoy the concert and dinner,” Granger said. “I hope to speak to you later, but it is quite all right if others take up all your time.” She gave Parkinson a pointed look and walked away.
Inside, the conservatory was a wild jungle. The air was humid, thick; it gave Harry’s skin a sensual caress.
Harry’s heart sank. He hadn’t money for bail; he could barely afford food, let alone money to get him out of gaol.
For a moment, the duke looked at Harry as if he were a specter. His icy gaze was wide, his cruel lips parted.
He gulped, and tried not to count the steps in his head. “Okay, I think I can do this. I just can’t overthink it.”
Shivering, Harry turned toward the voice. Malfoy stood in a grey coat and a black hat, impeccably dressed. His cool gaze zeroed in on Harry’s own coat.
“I’m sorry, sir. I just have another engagement starting right now but I’m not quite done with the task you gave me.”
Ducking his head, the man collected all his belongings and staggered to the doors. He paused before leaving. “I apologise for my presence, Your Grace. I meant no offence.”
“Yes,” the duke hissed, and took him into his mouth. His mouth was sinfully wet and tight, and he moaned lowly as sank down, his beautiful, refined lips stretched around Harry’s shaft.
“Do you not want it?” Harry said. Malfoy wouldn’t look at him, so he rested a finger under his chin and urged him to look up.
Dursley’s gaze was wide, searching, desperate. Big beads of sweat escaped his hat. After a long, tense moment, he cried, “Fine! Let me out! You won’t hear from me ever again!”
“It’s about Harry … he withdrew from university and has left Oxford entirely. No one knows where he has gone.”
Malfoy moaned softly. He captured Harry’s lips in a searing kiss. He tasted like mint and whiskey and desperation. Harry curled his hands in his shirt, and let himself be possessed. Then Malfoy pulled away.
Ignoring everyone, Granger added, “It will be worth our time to try to talk to the duke again. He is one of the most powerful men in the country and could sway the entire upcoming election if he set his mind to it.”
“Yes,” Draco growled. It was dangerous to reveal this much of himself to Weasley, but it was necessary given the situation. Weasley needed to understand exactly who he was up against.
take his word more seriously. Harry just had to find the courage to approach a gentleman who was far, far above his class.
“He deemed it important enough to contact me about it. It was terribly inconvenient for me, I must say. He popped out of nowhere when I was getting ready for bed. Truly a headache.”
, Harry thought darkly. At least then he would have ended up with some titillating memories to keep him company while imprisoned.
Daphne’s eyebrows shot up, and Draco narrowed his eyes at her. She dropped her head and hurried to unlock the cupboard.
They stood in silence for a long moment. The duke looked tired, his face lined with stress. Finally, the duke said, “You ran away.”
To please the Queen, Draco invited young Lady Astoria Greengrass. She was barely out of her teens, a pretty girl, but she seemed petrified in Draco’s presence.
It was obvious Draco had to offer a bit of himself to Potter to loosen him up. Potter had no idea, but Draco was slowly giving over his heart, piece by piece. It was necessary to get Potter to trust him. It was necessary, but utterly mad. Just another thing Draco couldn’t bring himself to care about.
They both stood to shake hands. “Harry, one last thing.” Dudley squeezed his hand hard. “Don’t you dare get into any
“Yes, Potter, say my name again. I ache to hear it on your lips.” He opened his mouth to Potter’s neck. He moaned when he tasted his skin.
), but seeing Potter’s felt different. Potter was defeator of the Dark Lord, the wizarding world’s savior, and now his cock was
It was dinner time when Malfoy woke up. Harry was frying up two steaks in the kitchen when he heard a crash. He took the steaks off the hob and dashed upstairs.
“Malfoy!” Potter’s voice was full of terror. He rushed toward him, fear twisting his expression. He dropped to his knees next to a panting Draco. “Bloody hell, are you all right?”
“No, please,” Potter said. Then he seemed to realise he had grabbed the Duke of Malfoy and released him quickly.
A little while later, they were seated in the visitor gallery in the House of Lords. Harry spotted Draco on the floor, looking immaculate. Harry removed his handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his forehead. His heartbeat was thunderous.
Draco reached down and showed Potter how he liked to be wanked. Potter tightened his fist, quickened his strokes. Draco thrust needily into his palm.
He wished he could have stayed home, feigned a cough or a toothache, but no one refused a visit with Queen Victoria.
“Smells brilliant,” Harry said, muffling a yawn. He padded over to the table to pour himself a cup of tea, adding lots of milk and sugar. He was a little stiff from sleep, so he grabbed a chair and twisted his back, then raised his arms up, stretching toward the ceiling. His sleeping shirt rose, revealing his stomach. He sensed Malfoy staring at him, and he glanced his way. Malfoy’s gaze was glued to his revealed stomach. “You’re burning the bacon,” Harry said, dropping his arms.
Harry gulped. He looked down at his hands. “I should tell you that I’m not … I’m in the process of getting over someone.”
Draco couldn’t handle his tenderness. He slid from his chair to kneel between Potter’s thighs. Without looking at Potter, he began to unbuckle his belt.
Yawning, Draco looked up at him. He was desperate for them to just go to bed. It was way past their bedtime.
He thrust and thrust, chasing his orgasm. Everything seemed bright and beautiful and safe. Draco reached around to touch his arsehole, and Harry cried out and went still. He orgasmed hard, almost violently, his teeth breaking the skin on his bottom lip to stop himself from making loud noise.
Harry carded his fingers through his hair. When Malfoy didn’t move away, he grabbed his head for leverage and thrust up into that hot, tight mouth. Malfoy whimpered, saliva escaping his lips.
Gibb smiled apologetically at them. Then he put his neck through the window. “I say it’s the duke! He’s here to visit you!”
“Don’t you dare faint on me.” Draco jumped to his feet to catch Potter before he slumped to the ground.
Draco saw there was no fire in the hearth, despite the cold day. “Good day, Mrs Gibbs. Would you care for some wood to heat your home?”
Malfoy sat down, his knees nearly brushing the blankets. “Mr Potter must be famished. Bring him his dinner and pour fresh hot water in his basin. Oh, and find me the softest flannel in the cupboard. Be quick about it.”
Draco had never had another man inside him, but he wanted Potter inside him. He wanted a commoner to bugger him until he didn’t know himself … until he didn’t know anything.
Draco closed the space between them, pressing Harry into the wall. He framed Harry’s face with two gentle hands. “You want me?” he murmured.
Stupidly, Harry felt tears burn his eyes. “I’m sorry, Your Grace.” He twisted his hands in his lap. “I shouldn’t have made myself a problem for you. I failed Lady Granger and the movement. Do they even know what became of me?”
“I can’t—I refuse. I will not ruin you. You deserve respect and acclaim. You deserve a wife and children. All I can do for you is to make your life harder.”
Her eyes narrowed at him. He was challenging her and they both knew it. “Pray tell, what would you need for you
Draco looked up at him with wide, desperate eyes. Harry stroked him quicker, his thumb massaging over his head.
Potter, still upset about his destroyed trainers and now cautious when he introduced new people to Draco, didn’t even let Ginger Hagrid in the same room as Draco. Draco barked and cried, but Potter told his ugly shag that his dog was
Harry was once again late to a suffragist meeting. This meeting was important, however, and he wasn’t so sure Lady Granger wouldn’t go for his jugular.
“Thank you, sir.” Harry blushed a little. Weasley wasn’t that much older than him, but it was still thrilling to receive compliments from a professor.
“Harry,” Draco said, taking his hands gently. He drew Harry away from the carriages, into an area behind some trees. No one was close enough to see or hear them. “
Harry scrubbed himself thoroughly. His cock was growing hard, needy, like it already knew his intentions. He stood, water raining down from his body, and began to prepare his arse.
“Yes, but he is currently visiting a few of his tenants. We are expecting a good amount of snow this weekend.”
They spent hours thinking about ways to better support the dukedom’s tenants and the National Society of Women’s Suffrage. Draco was already considering how he would pay back the Queen. He hadn’t upheld his end of their bargain, after all.
Malfoy smirked. “Yes, well. That’s why I hired him.” He moved a chair closer. In his hands was a velvet-bound book. “Do you enjoy poetry?”
The audience stood up to clap politely for the performers, and it took Harry a moment to realise he was the only one still in his seat. He jumped up and began clapping enthusiastically.
Malfoy’s expression cleared. “I will have my solicitor draw up a contract. You may have anything you want, absolutely anything. Obviously you understand my wealth, my resources. I’m capable of getting you out of this world.”
Lady Parkinson looked at him once and a grin split her feline face. “You must be Mr Potter,” she said, giving him her hand.
Draco gritted his teeth. Goyle was only confirming his worst fear. “Why do people come to London? The common man, I mean.”
“Yes.” Theo dropped his hand and sighed. “They chucked us into Azkaban because of things our families made us do. They didn’t care about our well-being; they wanted us dead. They wanted us
“We are not that far from the castle,” Draco said over his shoulder. “I have full confidence that you can find your way back on your own, or I can ask Watkins to come fetch you.”
Malfoy pulled his shirt completely off. He raised his arms, twisting from side to side. “I’m looking better, don’t you think?”
He stalked the dirt roads that led to his tenants’ houses. He eyed them critically. Harry had been right; he could treat his tenants so much better, starting by giving them a better place to live. Some of the houses even had newspaper caked to their roofs to keep out the rain. Shame burned darkly inside Draco.
Potter scrambled onto the horse. His movements were awkward, his breath coming fast against the back of Draco’s neck.
Draco shuddered. He held his face. He couldn’t stop the sob that tore through him. “Stop,” he moaned.
It didn’t matter what Granger or Ginny said. He couldn’t stay here for Christmas. It wasn’t possible the duke desired his presence over such an important holiday. At the very least, Harry would only be in the way.
“Yes … we met in town, just on the street. We passed one another and our eyes met, and I just knew. It’s like that for our kind, isn’t it? It only takes the meeting of eyes.”
“I’m just thrilled you’re having a New Year’s Eve party this year, Your Grace,” said Greengrass. “Will there be fireworks?”
Potter played with the moisture on the side of his pint. “Can we talk about something other than Dumbledore and my … my privates?”
“Perhaps, it’s simply the case of me fancying you more than you fancy me, but how you make me feel? How
“Of course not. I doubt I’ll have much of a say.” He waved a morose arm. “Society will choose my bride for me.”
“I believe so.” Draco threw aside the letter and pounced on Harry. Harry laughed, then moaned. Draco dragged his cock against his, rubbing, grinding.
. Not anymore. The only thing that matters in this world to me is you. I discovered that. It took a stupid fall from a horse, but I finally discovered it.”
Professor Weasley’s academic trip to the Mediterranean quickly approached and cementing all the logistics was very time-consuming. Harry had very little money and he could only afford to eat one meal a day. He knew his face had grown a bit gaunt. He knew the light had gone out of his eyes. Weasley made a habit of leaving apples on Harry’s desk. Harry finally spoke to him about it.
Trelawney glided into his flat. She chimed like a musical clock. It was all her necklaces and bracelets. “You should have a seat, dear,” she said before Draco could ask her what the hell she was doing at his flat.
“Oh, Harry, Harry.” Malfoy closed the space between them and grabbed his hands. He held his hands close to his chest. “I have seen the light.”
“Harry, please calm down. I am a duke; of course I speak to the Queen. Believe me, it’s all relative.”
“Wow,” Harry said around his first mouthful. The pie mixture was savoury, salty; the crust was crispy and brown; the mashed potatoes were so, so buttery.
Theo turned to look at him. “Of course you should take as much time as you need … but don’t you think you’re ready to move on?”
Still smiling, Harry closed his eyes. He fell asleep to the sound of the duke’s smooth, comforting voice.
He threw himself into work on his land. He visited Mr and Mrs Gibbs, made sure they had enough firewood and herbs. He spent hours speaking to his managers, asking them personal questions about how they got on with their jobs. It took some needling, but eventually his employees opened up to him.
Harry grasped his hands in front of himself and waited for Malfoy and the director to return. He didn’t have to wait that long. The director looked more harassed than before when he appeared through the double doors of his office.
Scooting closer, Malfoy touched the hot flannel to Harry’s forehead. “Do you mind if I touch you in a familiar manner? I only mean to soothe.”
to see. “Want me to do it right now? I will. I’ll crawl under the table and put my mouth on you, right in front of all these stupid Muggles ...”
Draco reached for his hand. “It hurts, Harry,” he whispered. “I feel the baby moving - it’s coming out.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Malfoy’s gaze was still on the ceiling. “Maybe I’ll die before my baby is ready to come out.”
. It was dirty and used, and it probably had a smell. But he stepped back and let Malfoy into his private space.
Suddenly Harry had a hard time swallowing. He took a long pull from his fizzy drink, then fiddled with his cutlery for a moment. “When Sirius and I first met - properly met, I mean - he said that I could come live with him if I wanted. It made me so happy, you know. That’s all I had wanted … to live with him in a house - to be with family. But it wasn’t meant to be. He was on the run and then he died. So … I guess you could say I live here because it’s the closest I’ve ever come to living with someone who loves me.”
Encouraged, Draco fucked him quickly, desperately. He fucked him with absolutely no thought of stopping. All Potter could do was hold on and take it.
“Yeah … Hermione’s really busy now and Ron’s still figuring out how to help run George’s shops. They deserve a relaxing night together.”
Thankfully he was in the hallway just outside his room when this exchange happened (Harry had long ago removed all the paintings from his bedroom for this exact reason). He didn’t know what to do with himself and his room was entirely too small for all the emotions storming inside him.
Thankfully, the conversation turned to the merit of the Army Enlistment Act and whether decreasing the normal period of service had been beneficial. Surprisingly, Lord Webbington supported the decrease while the duke had to think about it.
Theo pressed his wand to Draco’s temple, the cold wood biting into his skin. He brushed his lips against Draco’s, sighing. “I’ve made up my mind. I want to keep you for myself.”
, Harry thought as he watched Malfoy bob his head up and down. A bright streak of red engulfed his cheeks. His dark blond eyelashes fluttered. He looked like he was really enjoying himself.
Harry quickened his steps. The nearest village couldn’t be that far, and if it was, well, he didn’t care.
, Draco wanted to respond just so Potter would grin at him again. But the truth was he thought very little about women and voting.
Harry sighed. “I tell you I am wasting my time. His Grace utterly oozes privilege and wealth. I met a few of his tenants yesterday. Their house was nearly a hovel. Delightful people, they were, but they couldn’t even afford firewood. How is that fair?”
Later, when Draco was back in his cell, the walls crying sea water, he pressed a palm to his thin chest and felt a soft, warm glow on the inside. Draco closed his eyes and smiled just a little. He fell asleep.
Draco felt a thrill sizzle through him. Potter was growing more comfortable around him. It was a heady feeling.
Still laughing, Draco brushed his lips against Harry’s. “Oh,” he whispered, and went in for another taste.
him. Draco was a powerful man, yes; but Potter was the one with all the power when it came to Draco.
His heart pounded. He felt stupid but he remembered Trelawney’s warning. He didn’t want to believe it. Not because the idea of Theo wanting him dead was too much to handle but because he didn’t want to imagine Harry roaming the earth as a ghost. Harry didn’t deserve that. He deserved peace. He definitely didn’t deserve an eternity where he watched Draco make shit decisions, push people away, cry for him night after night.
“No.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. He couldn’t keep the sullenness from his voice. He also couldn’t stop himself from glaring just a little.
The first course was something red and green and gelatin. Warily, Harry dipped his spoon into the concoction, hoping he was using the correct spoon. The gelatin was bursting with crisp cranberry flavour.
“Ginny Weasley.” She took his hand, and he was relieved to feel calluses on her palm. He wasn’t the only one in the group used to hard manual work. “It’s bloody cold, isn’t it?”
“I bet his parents not being alive has helped,” Ginny piped in. “Nobody’s around to pressure him about it.”
“All right,” Harry said with a grin. He stepped back and let Malfoy finish putting together the pie.
Draco sighed and set down his fork. “Why are we even doing this, Potter? This whole situation is useless.”
!” Hermione said, cradling little Scorpius Severus in her arms. Grinning widely, she still managed to shoot Harry a dark look. “I can’t believe you kept the pregnancy a secret from us!”
Draco sighed a little once he situated himself. “Now go look for some answers in your spell books. I’ll be all right.”
Then Harry took him deeper, sucking; he gagged when Draco brushed the back of his mouth, but he loved it. He bobbed his head, going fast, and Draco cried out.
Draco kissed him then, and it was a desperate, passionate thing. Draco wasn’t thinking; he couldn’t think. He just wanted Potter beneath him so much.
