He was also not sure if it wasn't his Slytherin side showing and making him think he liked football because he was currently running circles around his new teammates, or he actually liked this sport. Maybe he just liked winning—who knew? He figured he'd have to wait that one out and see what happened if this club got bigger.
She gave a little huff and pointedly walked over to a chair adjacent from her wand—still a distance away from him and also out of range of grabbing said weapon—and plopping down on it, making a show of getting comfy. She waved her hand at him generously. “It means I can sit here all day and do as little or as much as you’d like me to. I could explain everything I’m going to do and take as long as you want to do it… but you know, I still have to do it. There’s just no time limit.”
Then again, he had seven years here, he could ask Sprout to let him do it as a work study. He didn’t know if there were magical roses, as normal roses always seemed to captivate even witches and wizards just fine. He thought he remembered Harry saying he’d tended roses in his aunt’s garden.
But the sharp words were already out of his mouth before he stamped a lid over the flaring heat in his chest, and Draco’s ire went out instantly, like a candle being snuffed.
“Hey Harry.” The blond greeted just as quietly, also glancing around for the infamous nurse before slipping closer and taking the seat beside his bed. “I would’ve brought flowers but the ones I’m tending to are poisonous.”
If he’d been thinking clearly, he might’ve realized that immediately. As it was, he
Not that Fudge was talented, but he legitimately had perhaps too-much power and was stupid enough to use it blatantly for selfish reasons. She’d voiced her half-thought to Lucius but even he, who’d wormed his way into being a close confidant to the Minister over the years, had never been able to make a dent in Fudge’s rock-solid

He put it back in a lose braid and long pieces still slid out like silk strands that he’d tuck behind his ears, or just let them fall as it became apparent he’d need hairclips to keep it back. Not that he felt like it at the moment, but maybe when he got back to school and needed it out of his face to study or for his sports.

in the Great Hall as that was the best place to meet: they could be as loud as they wanted and all four houses could hang out in the neutral ground without feeling like one group had the advantage or the comfort. People used the Great Hall as a place to study and meet occasionally during off-mealtimes too, so it wasn’t an uncommon place for people to study or hang out if they were tired of their dorms and wanted to be louder than they could in the library. Even now it wasn’t
“Wait, what other features?”
He recognized the hypocrisy of forgiving McGonagall for not knowing while fully holding Dumbledore accountable for the same exact thing— and to be clear, he did not care.
Draco remained distinctly uncomfortable while sitting at the lions’ table, but he was perfectly polite and it was clear he did it only for Harry's sake, so the other Gryffindor first years got used to him and they had many a friendly conversation here and there. Draco was just as obsessed with Quidditch as Dean and Seamus were, which made it so they always had at least that to fall back on to prevent it from being
This though.
! This is Draco Malfoy, I met him getting my robes done! He was telling me more about the wizarding world," He burst out, bright and eager to make the tension go away and distract Draco’s parents from going for Hagrid’s jugular. While he spoke, reached out and looped his arm around Draco's tightly—silently sending a pleas with his eyes to the giant man to get the message that he didn't want to be judged for his new friend nor did he want this to cause too much trouble. He could clearly tell that for some reason the Malfoys didn’t like Hagrid, and Hagrid wasn’t too fond of them either although Harry hadn’t realized it was possible for the jovial giant to actively dislike someone.
Harry really hated people sometimes.

Harry took extra care to hide even more suspicious things, like tofu--if Vernon ever plucked up the desire to bend down and see the back corner of his own fridge Harry might actually die from the lashing he'd get from having brought that 'hippy nonsense' in the house.

and also informed him that Gringotts never closed at any hour of the day, or day of the year. Which was awesome because here he was, at precisely 5:15 in the morning in a private room at Gringotts with a goblin who claimed to be his account manager, and the Potter family financial advisor and accountant. He had a lot to do and only one day to do it, and the bank was his first stop since he needed money for most (all) of it.

“Shut up.”
Aw, what a good older brother. Ron would’ve been absolutely screwed if his brother didn’t clearly notice his absence
Poor, naïve Hagrid. Harry could only smile a bit fondly at him and shrugged.
He hadn’t been very interested in his financial situation as there was really no need to be concerned about it, but from the amount of gloating Blaise and Draco had with each other about their family’s connections and wealth, Harry knew it was probably important to spend more time on it—even if it bored the life out of him. His half-formed plan he’d given to McGonagall of opening a clothes shop and then

"Were you planning to teach, Mr. Potter?"
“There’s an odd number of people,” Ron was dumb enough to speak up, earning a glare, which he stupidly glared back at.
It was also safe to assume Neville would know—Harry called it his wallflower superpower, as he was usually present to witness the latest gossip since people tended to forget he was there when they talked. Which wasn’t great, but it
“Oh yeah, wild as all be it—never once was it presentable I don’ think.” He seemed highly amused at some memory and Harry was itching to hear more, but recognized now was not the time as Gringotts came up on them. “Is that why ya hide it? Got more decency than James ever did in tha’ respect then.” He huffed good-naturedly.
that?
He had also never seen a picture of his mother and was not quite old enough to wrap his head around the idea of genetics in any case, so the moment he realized his hair was no longer growing in dark brown-ish black, he did his absolute best to hide it. He found a black bandanna in his school's lost and found and wore it whenever he left the cupboard, wrapped around his forehead to cover his scar and the back tip tucked into the knot to hide all his hair from view. The Dursleys already saw him as a maid so it fit in their minds while at home, and when out and about it only made it easier to call him a delinquent, plus Petunia hated his wild hair so him taking to hiding it

“Anything else?” he demanded, and she sighed loudly.
Once in the room matching the key number he’d taken, he promptly locked the door and shoved the desk chair under the door handle. He finished his precautions off by fishing out his muggle repelling ward stone and sticking it on said chair so no muggle would even come close to the door at all. None of this would stop a wizard, but frankly he wasn’t concerned about witches and wizards at this moment.
"Yes father." Draco complied immediately and stood, glancing back at him with a warmer smile, though it was back to his small, polite smiles instead of real ones. "It was nice to meet you Harry." He said politely, clearly well trained to have good manners and making sure to be on them in front of his parents, both of them acutely aware they were being watched like hawks now.
He knew it was also likely because of his newfound emotional instability which made him irrationally angry at odd moments.

to keep his anger at this man at bay, so he wasn’t going to get too friendly.
“Well, thank you for your information, Ms. Greengrass. If you ever need help with another spell I’m sure I can think of more questions to ask.”
So, ironically, his biggest issue was going to be the upper year Gryffindors who, true to Neville’s warnings, were not
Harry kind of liked that plan but he wasn’t really sure on how to get there. He also really didn’t even know what pies he wanted, going with that analogy.
“It’s just a household spell,” He frowned, still checking his shirt to make sure he hadn’t missed a spot.
He packed everything he could into his bottomless bag, the only thing not fitting being his trunk which he emptied and abandoned—he could get another one in Diagon easily no matter how nice it was. He kept out his atmosphere bulb and his muggle-repelling ward stone just to ensure no one came too close to where he was working to stop him, which gave him a lot of relief as he got started actually. He then got to work, but it quickly became apparent this was not a
Not for fun, like Hermione had somehow gotten it into her head that he did.

amused to hiss silently after his retreating back while keeping his expression clear.
In a twisted mimicry of what he’d done to Montague only just this afternoon, the arm extended towards him intent on harm turned to solid stone, the hand and the sleeve and the arm all the way up to the shoulder blade. It fell off the body it was attached to in short order, stone crumbling as it hit the ground with a loud crackle and a wet bloody stump spilling blood onto the floor from the violent loss of a limb. Too bad Quirrell was already suffocating, so fortunately there was no scream to accompany it despite Harry assuming it probably hurt quite a bit.
And maybe he could do that, but
“You only told Lucius about your wrist because it would impair your ability to write in the coming days of classes.” She put together while totally ignoring his comment, smirking in a pleased way. “Very clever, as it soothed our suspicions and got you what you needed, while still guarding your appearance of strength. I approve of the tactic, if even I’m displeased you attempted to lie to me.”
Were they going to learn anything this year? Probably not. But they’d coast happily on easy ‘O’s for the time being if they could make it though the long classes of him boasting about himself.
Well, Draco would, but more importantly he’d understand why Harry was acting this way. Maybe he’d even cover for him.
So for today he swiped three dreamless sleep potions and five calming draughts. As that was a little on the nose for what was wrong with him, he scanned the shelves for other things he though might be handy—being sure to read when their stasis charms would wear off as he hadn’t considered that before Pomfrey explained it to him at the start of summer. He settled for a couple mild pain relievers with a shelf life of six months, a couple nutrient potions he recognized as having taken in the hospital wing before, and a fever reducer. He also tossed in a couple bandages and cut-mending ointments. There, it looked like he was just re-stocking his medicine cabinet or something.
the hat didn’t mean to say Ravenclaw?” The Malfoy heir drawled primly.
And then…
Draco seemed to be having a very hard time wrapping his head around this fact, the idea that not everyone grew up knowing about magic as a fact of life seemed to be a revolutionary concept to him going by his wary expression and the confusion written into his eyes, but upon mention of quidditch he needed no other prompting to launch into a detailed explanation of the game’s rules and principles. He apparently played a position called ‘Chaser’ which handled a ball called a Quaffle—there being more than one ball already throwing Harry off but Draco was more than happy to keep talking about it no matter what simple question he was asked.
One look at Theo staring at the table top in front of him like it’d just murdered a puppy in front of him, and his stomach started to twist uncomfortably.

who came to her with wide green eyes always so surprised when she complimented him, and surprised that she wasn’t dismissing or ignoring him every time he spoke.
Harry’s eyes widened, glancing around at the Halloween feast around them and doing a quick head count. He found everyone he was concerned about easily, but double checking the Gryffindor table, he found it lacking a typically noticeable head of bushy brown.
The club had called it quits around lunch time as they usually did, but the twins were happy to stick around and continue goofing off with each other so Harry had jumped at the chance to get them alone. Now that he knew
The goblin was patient as he worked this out, or at least Harry assumed he was being patient as he’d had the annoyed scowl on since this meeting had started.

He considered it a moment and lifted his arms up… the fabric rustled like silky air and the gap in the middle opened to reveal his body hiding in magical shadows underneath the magical cloak. In the places where it went from invisible shield to revealing the normal fabric on the underside, there were shimmers of faint color that kind of reminded him of the cloth's normal color, but were much brighter as if enhanced by the invisibility-magic letting light reflect off of it somehow.

“Now then, just a quick diagnostic spell to see what’s the matter.” He said, lifting his wand and casting a light blue spell that laid over Harry’s skin and made his eyes feel warm.

It was dark. All the time. And this prison sentence had just started but it already felt like it was too much and he just wanted some amount of light to break this monotonous dark.

kind of a relief to sort through his thoughts enough to know he had a back up of a back up of a back up plan. The severe pressure was off a bit now that he had a last resort, and now it was just him trying to avoid dropping out of Hogwarts instead of him trying to avoid being put back with murderous muggles. One of those consequences was a lot less intense than the other, so it calmed him down a bit.

Harry didn’t really respond to that, because she was right. He just finished his notes in silence… and eventually she gave a light sigh.
"Harry!" Hermione screamed, and this time he heard what she was saying. He also heard another voice trying to quiet her lowly.
Charlie, on the other hand, sounded almost as blinded by his love of dragons as Hagrid was about his pets, so maybe he wasn’t exactly thinking of his father’s position through this whole ordeal, of which Harry was thankful for. And in any case, Charlie had a license to work with dragons, so if he were caught with Norbert the consequences would be much less severe than if anyone else were to be caught with one.
It was kind of funny, comparing how hard Slytherin fought within themselves for power and status, yet right next door at their neighboring table was a full table of born followers who all fell in line at the first shining example of a leader that popped up among them. And they were all just so well-meaning and trusting that there was no animosity in it either, which Harry found extremely refreshing if he spent too many meals in a row over at the Slytherin table.
than most humans I’ve met.” He raised a brow pointedly, the goblin’s icy look melting one degree or so. “As I said I didn’t know about magic until this morning. Someone has clearly been keeping things from me, in my perspective, not just about bank statements but literally everything else. I didn’t even know my parents didn’t die in a muggle accident until half and hour ago if that proves my point.”

“What?”
"Unnatural colors? Well I'll be! Tha's not too strange fer wizards, ya know—a metemorphmagus can change all sorts o' colors and faces." Hagrid chatted, fully stopping now and beaming down at him. “Yer dad had dark hair ya know, and tha’s the Potter signature I was talkin’ aboubt.”

"That's bloody brilliant Harry! I brought a ball with me too, just in case you know? We could ask around and make up some teams, even if they're pick-up games! Like a club or something," he was grinning now and Seamus took one look at his friend and decided it couldn't hurt—it's not like either of them were on the quidditch team for at least this year and he'd heard a lot of the muggle game from Dean so was interested in playing.
Ron and Draco were still exchanging barbs and getting in each other’s face, but for the life of him Harry neither heard nor cared what they were saying. As he passed by in a storm of wrath and ire, he ripped the broom Blaise still had in his hand from the tall Slytherin’s grasp and simultaneously tossed the Remembrall he still had at Hermione, who was the closest Gryffindor to him who first noticed his sudden re-entry into their class. She caught it in surprise the same moment Blaise made a startled noise, but that was all they could do before Harry wound up the broom behind him like a baseball bat without breaking stride.

McGonagall was very good at filling his margins and occasionally slipping in a whole other page of comments at the back on his assignments, citing why some things weren’t possible and here’s why, or saying it was a good idea so shelve it until they reached that particular topic later down the line. She also suggested other books and resources that would either disprove or support his ideas and arguments so he could go research it himself and come back with another argument or learn why his ideas weren’t going to be possible after all. He knew all of that wasn’t required by the homework and Hermione kept getting points taken off by writing excessively too-long essays beyond the minimum requirement, but he kept getting “O”s so he figured maybe his content was a little more satisfactory. He was essentially asking to learn more, and then proceeding to actually learn more, whereas Hermione had a habit of regurgitating what she’d read word-for-word or citing an author’s work as the bible truth—and McGonagall had already read probably all the Transfiguration texts at Hogwarts so she didn’t really want to hear it again.

, the charts actually turned out to be very helpful. Because he’d asked a couple weeks ago about some of the more basic equations relating to transfiguration, McGonagall had taken him through a slightly more elevated way of handling the basic equation they’d literally learned the first month at Hogwarts in her class—and although he wasn’t 100% sure, he was
His lips twitched, barely, lacking any actual mirth. She was sure this place had stolen all of that from him long ago—her too, as she was truly feeling the effects of this place and felt no warmth at the bad joke. She didn’t need to feel a thing to play a part though.

I mean, if he really wanted him dead the potions professor wouldn’t have been the one beside McGonagall pulling him from that troll’s fist not two weeks ago—there were many other teachers present and his loud distaste of him in particular would’ve been a good excuse to just let someone else help the crushed student and stand back to watch the scene unfold. Also, if nothing else Snape would be bored in his first-year classes without his resident

was not an uncommon name, especially after the dark lord’s defeat there was an explosion of children named Harry here and there, and the boy Draco had met at Diagon Alley could’ve been the right age for how small he was. To hear that the boy was actually going to be in Draco’s year was a bad omen though, given they’d always known that their son and the Potter child would be year mates.
Harry though… she’d thought she recognized his unfounded confidence because of his father before him, and she’d been very on guard against feeding into the insane arrogance of a spoiled child at first. James had grown up to be a wonderful man, but he was a little terror in his earlier years at Hogwarts and she liked to think the countless detentions she’d given him had done

Hogwarts was at about half capacity for that break, as it was a lot less celebrated in the wizarding world so it was mostly muggleborns who went home, which left plenty of people to preoccupy Harry’s free time with—and with the quidditch season soon to wrap up and Gryffindor pretty much having the cup in the bag, the arguments over who had rights to practice on the pitch that day had also died off some as well.

Ron frowned deeply. “What exactly is the point of the game?”
“Do you know anything about the Monroe family?” Draco turned with that earnest curiosity to his father—and Harry immediately panicked that it was too much information to spill but…
“Uh… likewise.” He shifted in the chair uncomfortably as the man leaned closer, evidentially thrilled to have met him for some reason. “What was that about my eyes and the Potter family again?”
Eventually…
“Y-yeah.” He agreed weakly. If they already knew there was no point in hiding it…

Looking closer because really that was all he could do at this moment, he noticed there were several faint lines coming from Salazar Slytherin’s name—he couldn’t read any of them but Liliana, and he couldn’t even read who he’d married. The lines implied he’d had three children, though right now he only knew about this Liliana… who had no magic despite being the daughter of one of the most famous wizards in the world, and her children and her children’s children had all be firmly

Two even had a ‘Hogwarts Section’ where people could buy the required books at Hogwarts that year, but everything else had a little more liberal titles than some of those. There was a whole section about information muggleborns should know upon entering the wizarding world and he got seven of them on different subjects, including

It was equal to, if not worse, then staring up at a troll and knowing he was going to get crushed. Than looking into Quirrell’s eyes after he’d screamed at him and knowing he was not going to be able to beat a full grown wizard no matter of clever he’d thought he was.

Then there was the island itself, actually putting up with being here was unpleasant and there were still the few actual human guards who monitored things.

He hadn’t been able to get back to his graveyard in… well, that was another matter, so since his thoughts were not being very cooperative lately, writing it out might help.
And so, while the Draco situation never fully left his mind, his first month at Hogwarts seemed to speed by in the blink of an eye with never enough downtime to ever get truly caught up in his more troubling thoughts. Between schoolwork, the extra transfiguration assignments, quidditch as a first year, and slowly making his way through the school until he was fairly certain he knew everyone in a very general way, his schedule was packed and before he knew it, it was October.

Until he turned on Nott with a plethora of other comments from across the room and Draco banged his head onto his desk in utter exasperations.

Harry ever realizing what he was doing. The thing was, he wouldn’t know until it either paid off, or didn’t. While waiting on it, he just had to keep plugging away and making calculated moves so as not to blow his cover, and unfortunately vast displays of wealth that would polarize the already destabilized Slytherin quidditch team would in no way be helpful.
The wider audience of the Great Hall had obviously seen Graham Montague storm out of here in a huff, and the more gossipy few had been wondering what that was about. Those few were looking towards the Slytherin table, and were actually very startled to see all the snakes

when it came to Arithmancy, and they both related back to his Transfiguration work. Fred and George said when you got to third year they had the option to take Arithmancy—they hadn’t, but they knew McGonagall had recommended it to those interested in pursuing careers heavy in Transfiguration. It wasn’t necessary to pass her class, but apparently it would help, and she’d pointed him in the direction of several texts in the past that had used Arithmancy to prove why his ideas wouldn’t work.

after all, and if anyone was even remotely connected to the Dark Lord, that meant association with Draco himself was an insanely bad idea.
And so, it was only two days before the start of term that Harry finally mustered up the courage to visit Gringotts again—not for the Monroe vault, but another discussion with Axeclaw he was kind of terrified to hear the answer to.
First of all, why did the Headmaster of a boarding school have
his hair. As hard as that was to openly admit, even to himself, he suddenly knew it was true. He liked his hair, and he was proud of it.
And by the time Thursday lunch was ending, he was sorely missing his gold-tinted weekend and wondering just how badly he’d underestimated this Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing. He was tense and Neville was in hysterics that the Remembrall he’d gotten that morning was telling him he forgot something and he couldn’t remember what it was. Also he’d lost it twice already, and Hermione had tried to “help” find it and made it very much worse for all involved.
in front of him.
The easiest part had been getting to the muggle train station—he’d started by digging through his clothes and putting on a large plain grey sweatshirt that covered most of him, as well as put all his hair into a tight bun at the back of his head, covering it with a bandana to try and make himself look unmemorable. Especially with Dudley’s old pants and shoes—yes he looked like a hoodlum but he was also tiny and twelve so like… a kid dressed as a hoodlum instead of actually being a delinquent. He noted the skin on his hands was… really pale, probably not healthily so, and took out his mirror to finally get a good look at himself in full light for the first time in well over a month.
Did not compute, try again later.
He met her gaze pointedly to convey how serious he was about this, her eyes a very vibrant, wary blue for how inky her hair was. He hadn’t really noticed that before.

So, he just nodded. “I will,” he promised, leaving it at that. He would definitely lean on them again if he felt he was struggling because this was too important to screw up, but he should at least give it an honest go first. His parents let it go, seeming to understand that logic for themselves.

Blaise who Harry had never seen look more than slightly miffed, much less outright shocked.
In the parlor Severus had left behind, Lucius leaned back in his chair and sipped his own drink far more slowly, enjoying the 500-year scotch for all it was worth because this was one of the priciest drinks in his reservoir. Not just because of the year but because a side effect of old alcohol stored in cherrywood barrels—so rumor would have it, old liquor in barrels of softwood would invoke a strong sense of nostalgia in whoever drank it. It wasn’t a poison or a spell, as it was the inherit magical nature of the liquor-making practice, so it’d never show up on a quick scan to check that your food or drink wasn’t tampered with.

“Oh do tell?” George perked up curiously.
Draco was clearly Snape’s favorite and Blaise was still the untouchable-Slytherin so the wide smile on the Zabini’s face prevented the potions master from commenting, but instead snapped at them to get started and entertained himself the rest of the double-period by harassing the teams on the other side of the room and slowly chipping away at Gryffindor’s points. Draco was, annoyingly enough, fantastic at potions and without a partner to slow him down had finished in the first hour and been excused without so much as a glance behind him at either house eyeing his back curiously.

“Sure does! It’s a little less than four-square meters in space—as I said it’s only for a potion’s workstation. Some people have their workstations in drafty areas away from main living areas because it can cause quite a mess.” He explained. Harry did some quick mental math of a space he thought he might be able to use this in, an idea forming that caused him to smile.

It quickly turned into rather delicate, but no less insistence that he answer him, that his silence was unnerving him. Then it quickly spiraled into demands he answer, and in less than a page he was now writing in all caps and threatening to just show up at his house if he didn’t answer soon.
When his eyes grew dark, she knew she’d won. She couldn’t well do more but hope he actually listened to her now, and then continue to chip away at her plan until it bore fruit—despite preferring to work carefully, the quicker she could do this the less time it would give Sirius to get impatient and do something stupid.

He knew he was a bad friend and their friendship had been very one-sided thus far, so to blatantly take this away from his baby cactus seemed… too cruel, even for him. And he had never said he wasn’t self-centered.

Harry evaluated him carefully, the ghost of a cold touch on his wrist reminding him of something… but he couldn’t quite place it.
Knowing the woman, it would only take the year most likely.

moral compass that made him a pure Gryffindor, that unspoken iron-clad belief he had in his friends and in what the right thing to do was. Just because he didn’t boast about his family name like Draco did, didn’t mean he didn’t believe in his family’s pride with everything he had, just as any of the most outspoken Slytherin did.
He mused to himself.
"Ah yes, there's no escaping that, sorry."
Harry suddenly remembered, there
He didn’t know how long it would take though, and it most certainly wasn’t the only horse he had in the race because there was still the undeniable fact that Sirius Black really could just be his parent’s betrayer and nothing more, or simply not fit or willing to take on a kid once freed from the hellhole that was Azkaban. He needed to know the fate of other people mentioned in his parents’ will to start, and he was kind of assuming they were all dead but
if he ignored it or didn’t take it somehow, and he didn’t doubt her. It had taken some doing to convince her that he’d be fine for quidditch when the season started, but she was not above using keeping him off the pitch as a threat if he started skimping on any of the orders she’d given him, potions regimen included. Given almost all of what Draco had wrote to him this summer about was him training to try out for the open spot on the Slytherin team, Harry was not about to miss his first match

“Be a bit more of a brat Draco, I’m more willing to listen to you that way.” Harry rolled his eyes as he stood up anyway, tossing his napkin down to the table before turning back to his dormmates who’d been watching the exchange warily. “If I’m not back by lunch, have Hagrid send Fluffy to fetch me.”

Then again, maybe he did know.
The interesting journals and adventures of his adopted ancestor and the steady, gut-warming praise and validation he was getting from his head of house meant he was all about doing well in the subject and thoroughly pleased when he turned out to be a natural with a lot of studying and a bit of hard work put into it.

with that small blond boy who came up to him asking questions about potions, it seemed like only yesterday but it’d been four years already. He didn’t know how Draco had gone from being his godson only in name for appearances sake to a child he legitimately wanted to protect—he didn’t know how Lucius was to blame but the man was good so Severus was going to blame him anyway on the belief it was his fault somehow.

It might take a few years though.
He turned sharply and walked to the other end of the room. He knew he couldn’t leave and so did Healer Anastasia, so she didn’t comment or move, just watched him carefully as he went to the window and looked down at the fields where the peacocks were grazing peacefully for a minute. He half wanted to break something, but he knew all the fancy decoration in here was probably ungodly expensive, or just simply cursed so he held back. Angry as he was with Mrs. Malfoy, he didn’t want to break Draco’s house even though he knew his friend likely didn’t give a shit about the figurines on the tables.
He’d inherited the Monroe family magic, he could prove that with his blood test this morning. The requirements for inheriting magic from and Ancient and Noble house were to commit and act of magical vengeance or victory against the person who’d wiped them out. Obviously Voldemort had been the perpetrator, and obviously Harry had, somehow, gotten vengeance over him. Killed him or simply reduced him to that ghost… that apparently counted.
Hannah was perfectly content deflecting questions her way and while Neville was the most senior of anyone here, his timid personality meant pretty much no one asked him questions first.

Harry was absolutely not the first nor the last to be given a tour of this manor or sit in one of the dozens of sitting rooms designed to host and entertain and distract from the gentle flow of conversation that was all just interesting, engaging small talk but was definitely going to be used like a weapon in her arsenal at a later date. She might not be after him specifically as he was here for a real reason and also she probably just wanted to get to know her son’s best friend, but that didn’t change the fact Harry knew anyone invited to

She saw the way he startled every time she praised his work, the way he was eager to share not just his Transfiguration questions but also how his day was going when he visited, the way he eagerly grabbed at his homeworks as she handed them back, excited to read her comments. The way he thought he was so clever in hiding how much her rare smiles made him perk up with a big grin of his own. The way his mask had dropped like a bag of bricks the second she’d validated him in any way, and how his questions went from ‘

need to put in an appearance at the Slytherin table sooner rather than later. Better now when his mood was the highest it’d probably get for a while, rather than wait for the next thing to throw him off guard and make this all the harder later.
he mused as he packed up everything after giving up with what he had so far. His clothes he figured were easy—he’d pulled out a long sleeve shirt and a blue bandana to wear around his neck that would look strange as hell in mid-August weather but you know, better than letting people see it. He could cover the grey tone with makeup, he couldn’t change the thin, too stretched skin of his neck that easily.

Harry elbowed Draco before he could say whatever he’d opened his mouth to say. It’d only been a day and he already knew whatever it was wouldn’t help Neville’s stuttering.
Hours later when Vernon had finished his work and returned to the house, it hit Harry how dark it really was in here. And how very, very alone he was going to be from here on out.
“Yep!” He turned, sympathizing with the teary-eyed Hagrid watching the exchange sadly. He patted his huge arm gently. “Don’t worry Hagrid, she’ll have a ton of space to grow and be free on the reserve, and I’ll send letters of her progress, I promise.”
He reeled back in alarm slightly, mind blanking out. "
This morning dawned the second day of the school year and another new class: Herbology. It took place in the green houses and they were paired with the Hufflepuffs, who seemed to be content to just go about their business pleasantly. Despite him still not knowing his way around the school, Neville had seemed fully aware of where he was going when they left breakfast; something Harry had noted but didn’t really pay attention to.
He kicked the ball a bit harsher than before which sent it spiraling off into the nearby field and Fred pointedly did not comment or look at his twin, but chased after it as if to avoid whatever it was his brother was talking about.

“Thank you sir,” was all he said outwardly though, smiling at the guy and going to leave—before a pretty glowing ball a perfect periwinkle and covered in what looked to be dusted sparkles caught his eye on the shelf behind the man’s white head. The whole shop has a stereotypical muggle-idea-of-a-witch type feel with jarred animal parts and funny smelling dried plants hanging from the ceiling, tools made of pewter and sharp silver lying everywhere, so something that

“This
Draco shook his head, too used to it by now to be surprised.
"Ah… yes, that's about it. It's nice to meet you Draco."
He had his magically soft bedroll, the desk with a tiny light he could write by, his endless water bottle, the snacks he’d saved up from Hogwarts, and the atmosphere bulbs, so those were all good, but the thing was…

Draco took a neat step forward and slightly forward to block Harry from view slightly. “Enough, Montague.” He growled lowly at him, and the upper year sneered openly.
. Transfiguration was his strength, so he was going to focus on that and with what he had at his disposal now and not being able to perform magic, he simply plotted, and waiting.
"What, summoning and transfiguration?" Harry wondered, not really having touched the subject before.
Also that nagging feeling about a green light refused to go away now too, and he knew it was somehow familiar.
If he were still aligned dark he probably could’ve gotten onto the team with just a simple demand at Flint’s face, because clever or not the Malfoy name had power and getting him into the quidditch team alliance would’ve been good business for all involved. Terence Higgs, the current Slytherin seeker, was one of the weaker members who was really in it for quidditch than he was the alliance, and no one would’ve batted an eye if Flint kicked him off the team for Draco—had he provided the team new brooms on top of it, it was all but an assured thing.

“’Odd Solution’?” Harry wondered aloud.
“Mr. Potter!”
It wasn’t like it was

“Oh good to know,” He blinked, immediately putting down any plans he had in his head about considering it. Not that he really was, he knew Arithmancy was in his future since it’d clearly already come in handy for his work before. But that meant… “I was thinking of Arithmancy, Runes, and Creatures. You think that’s too much?”
Harry didn’t answer until Blaise finished his step and added the last ingredient, waiting until their potion was the perfect color if not

Harry just sat there, grinning like a madman who’d finally figured out how to take over the world.

He worked up to eating proper meals again slowly but surely, he drank plenty of water, he took dreamless sleep potions and slept full nights. He walked up and down Diagon and Contrair Alley, only once at first before he had to stop and rest, and then several times, attempting to do limited exercises back in his apartment a couple times a day to try and build his strength back up—but it was a lot harder than he’d been thinking it’d be. No matter how hard he tried, he just seemed to be unable to breathe too quickly, and his limbs shook unsteadily far sooner than they used to doing the same exercises or even more challenging stuff.

Calling them drunks, and freaks, and lazy vagabonds.
“Nice to meet you.”

That was… hard to wrap his head around.

"My son. Draco." She put a hand over her heart as if that would sway him of her honesty. She knew it wouldn’t as he never knew her as a mother, but she was being honest, and it frankly didn’t matter if he believed her or not. "Of all else I am, good or terrible, I am a mother who loves her son. And my son has become close with a boy who desperately needs a family; for Draco's sake there is little I won't do, even if that means coming here and bringing suspicion on myself in order to free you."
Eh, not much he could do about that right now, if even he wanted to.
"I never got mine to turn the whole time, and even practicing now it's only slightly pointy instead of actually a needle." He admitted in a voice soft enough to be a sigh "But you definitely made a reputation for yourself as being good at it. Ah…” he bit his lip as if trying to stop from smiling and grimacing in one.

Draco and suddenly he felt like he was coming apart at the seams. Like the string holding him together had become alarmingly threadbare and all at one it was starting to give.
A year ago, when they’d met a young Harry Potter leaning on their son and grinning at his new friend happily, they’d suspected. Approximately two minutes later after Hagrid had intruded and given the boy his arctic owl, they’d
“Very good Mr. Potter.” He finished making his notes and looked back up at the young wizard in front of him. “Gringotts will continue to pursue your missing statements and will likely find the store of the rest of your mail at that time. I will be in contact for when that happens.”
“So Susan just gets to know things that the Ministry does because her aunt does? Isn’t that like, a breach of security or a conflict of interest? To tell your family members about things that go on at work, particularly a government job?” He frowned, and he heard the frown in Neville’s voice behind him as he answered.
“It could be.” She allowed. “Just thought I’d say hi is all.”
Not a thing. There was nothing there.
He ripped it open much faster than the last one, and his heart beat a little faster to see that it was actually a pretty long response—his eyes snapping to the text and drinking it in.
“Same.” Like six other people chorused, startling a laugh from Harry at the dark humor.
"They sent a representative from Hogwarts ma'am, but he wandered off while I was getting my robes done. I was waiting on him here." Harry explained as harmlessly as he could, wondering just what was going on here.
“Well shit,” Daphne blinked, voicing pretty much Harry’s mindset too because…

exactly, you couldn’t actually predict the Zabini heir, but he just could not imagine Blaise actually doing something so random but in trying to form the mental picture he just lost it again.
But her smile was definitely pleased. He wasn’t really used to looks like that, but for some reason it felt kind of… flattering?
It was damn near poetic really, the thought. If not absolutely gut-wrenchingly horrifying too.
“What?” he balked, his head spinning. He snapped his neck towards Draco who was looking pissy as ever at people in general but his cheeks were a dusty pink from embarrassment at that too. “Draco
His lack of complaints or sass now that he learned to school his expressions and his willingness to be a good little cook and maid seemed to inspire his aunt and uncle in a terrible way and they we happy to pile on more chores than they ever had before. With his growing uneasiness at the cupboard, Harry couldn’t even deny it was better than being cooped up in that dark corner, and he soon found himself with a daily maid-like list of chores tending to the Dursley household, including cooking their three meals, doing the laundry, vacuuming, dusting, and wiping down every excessively shiny surface in “Petunia’s” kitchen, on top of gardening constantly and mowing and tending the outside panels and windows. It certainly kept him busy, and he wondered what the heck his Aunt

He wasn’t too prideful or ignorant enough to not realize that earned validation was a very addictive thing to him after having grown up in the Dursley household where he was seen as only slightly more than a stray dog dropping—and only then because dog droppings couldn’t sweep floors or cook meals. Being patted on the head for a good job should’ve been condescending at face value, but Harry was not too proud to admit he’d willingly write an extra foot on his homework assignments if
He’d sprained his wrists and ankles and such, just a side effect of growing up with your own personal bully in the same house, but he couldn’t remember a time he’d actually broken something and just had to deal with it aside from this recent incident with his wrist. Vernon had roughed him up a couple times this summer but he definitely hadn’t broken anything until his wrist, he was sure. Shocking as it was he hadn’t even broken anything with the Quirrell incident, which left…
“No we’re not done—I want answers!”
His lunch had been exceptionally late and so instead of attending dinner he was going to use the rare blissfully sweet silence of an empty lion’s den to collect his thoughts, and then go to bed early. Maybe he’d start tomorrow fresh like today had never happened.

make sense for Neville to be there, when you looked at the plan like a Slytherin.
when it came to the softening charm just so long as it was five times as strong as a match-to-needle transfiguration. Speaking in terms of spells that most first years learned relatively easily as a better gauge of power level might help, he thought. After all, Hermione was brilliant but the rare times he'd actually studied with her he knew her notes were as dry and unhelpful as just reading the textbook yourself; if he wanted his notes to be good trades, they needed to be way more accessible than that.
Harry smiled a bit hesitantly, but earnestly. “Right, she did say that. I’m Harry… but ah, you knew that…? Somehow?”
Blaise clearly took issue with being ordered to do anything and followed Draco out of spite—which left only Harry and Theo who surprisingly stood by politely instead of abandoning him.
