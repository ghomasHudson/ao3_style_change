Fondly, he remembered his last encounter with Potter. It began with Potter spitting in his face, but ended with Draco back handing Potter so hard that his head flew back and hit the wall behind him, knocking him unconscious. The high Draco felt at knowing he was finally the one in control was more addictive than the Dreamless Sleep he devoured each night to rid himself of his incessant memories.
The rumors that their friendship had developed into something more were becoming quite difficult to ignore. Especially as Draco took in their proximity to one another. The comfortability with which they engaged one another in conversation. The ease at which a smile played at the corner of Mr. Potter’s mouth whenever she spoke.
Flame burst forth out of his wand, hitting the Succubus square in the chest. She hissed in response, her flesh singed. Harry felt the last of her hold on him falter when the smell of her burning flesh reached his nose. It was the best smell in the world because he was thinking clearly now.
“Potter, you are insane.”
I knew it was going to be a hard sell for them. Skeeter was notorious for publishing half-truths and outright lies. Her
“I think I’ll go say hi to him,” I said. Hermione gave me a worried look, but I smiled at her and that seemed to relax her.
Harry felt like he’d been hit with ice-cold water. That’s what Ron’s case had been about—the batteries. She’d been working on a way to harness magic for some time now, and when the battery idea backfired, she moved on to Ley Lines.
Draco’s face fell.
They would then enjoy a quiet dinner and conversation, finding they had many a thing in common and that they ardently enjoyed one another’s company thus securing dinner invitation for later in the week, and when Draco let his fancy run completely wild, Mr. Potter would propose marriage and Draco would not even hesitate in his answer.
“What’s your favorite potion to brew, Draco? I’m partial to anything with Valerian root in it myself.” Ryder said. He seemed genuinely interested in Draco’s response, leaning forward to better hear Draco’s answer. That’s when it dawned on Harry that Luna was trying to set Draco up.
“Mister Potter, sir, you—you can’t just…” The small brunette witch, who must be Draco’s assistant, called after him as he blew past her and opened Draco’s office door.
“Yes, yes. Lucius, this is Nikola. He is the Russian Minister for Magic’s Ambassador.”
He turned to Hermione and said, “I did it. The potion works.”
I saw a smile spread across his face as he pulled back to look at me. “You are somehow always exactly what I expect you to be like and yet nothing like what I expect at the same time. I hate it and you.” There was no venom in his voice though. He looked at me and I could see a softness in his stare.
Letter sent, Harry meets Draco and Luna at the Leaky for lunch to plan the stag night, and Luna reveals a little tidbit of info that’s got Harry thinking.
I watched her for any hint that she was fucking with me, but she looked perfectly serious. “What kind of lead?”
When he finally meets up with Lucius, he gets some unnerving news.
Malfoy’s eyes went wide. If his cheeks weren’t already red from the cold, they would have from blushing. After a beat, he scoffed and then he semi-shouted, “
At Harry’s words, there was a collective gasp from the crowd watching them, the sound like a flock of birds taking off at once. Behind him, there was a shriek that sounded an awful lot like Hermione and an awkward laugh that had Ron written all over it. His mates must have caught up with him.
“Well, you missed quite a lot this morning.”
“Why?”
“We argued today,” Ron said before Harry could ask.
The door swung open and Hermione came in. Her hair was pulled back into a low bun and she wore a formal set of robes, giving me horrible flashbacks to Yule ball and that ridiculous frilly thing Ron wore. She looked a right shot better in it than Ron had looked in his.
Harry, headache in full swing, nodded goodbye to Ron who was still skimming the file, and made a bee-line for the exit. He needed to look at his map and figure out just what this thing was up to before it killed anyone else.
The overflow of whatever Potter was doing made its way into Draco’s space. He could see the edge of a file on the most recent study of Life Energy magic and why those who became Succubi had to give up the ability to cast spells or brew potions. And recently meant 1543, before such studies were banned altogether by the Ministry for fear that other witches would learn how to become Succubi and thus pass down the knowledge. Best to snuff it out, erase it from history. That was the wizarding way when it came to any magic deemed dangerous by the powers that be.
He held out the mirror for Malfoy, who made sure to keep his hand as far away from Harry’s as he possibly could, touching the tip of the mirror. And then with a gut-wrenching yank, they were off.
“I don’t even get why he—oh, for fucks sake, Potter,” Pansy stopped herself and seemed to consider her next words carefully. Her brows were pushed together and it looked like she was in a considerable amount of pain. “Do you even know what you’ve done?”
at party.”
“Well, that does happen when you live with someone and spend all of your free time with them. You start to learn everything about them,” Ginny said matter-of-factly and then sat upright again. She turned to face Harry and then gave him a sideways smile before she cupped his face in her gloved hands.
“Merlin fuck, Potter, you really will be the death of me.”
“I doubt we have mutual friends.”
“Once again, astounding logic, Potter,” Malfoy said. His voice was muffled by the fabric of the scarf, but the drawling sarcasm that Harry had grown to expect from Malfoy was unmistakably there. Somehow, that was a comfort.
“To what do I owe this unscheduled visit?” Draco spoke, standing up. He moved out from behind the desk and perched himself on the corner, so he was directly in front of Harry now.
Robards grabbed the box and nodded. “Good. But don’t think that means you two are off the hook for engaging with the perp after I specifically told you not to. There will be desk duty in both of your futures.” He turned to look at Potter once again and sighed. “And Auror Malfoy, get your partner to St. Mungo’s so he can get that cut seen to.”
“We need to tell Robards about this.”
“When did you get so wise, eh?” Harry joked and felt a sudden rush of warmth as Ginny swept him into an awkward sideways hug. He could feel the heat of her breath and smell the sweet floral scent of her shampoo.
With a deep breath, Harry licked his lip once more, this time on purpose knowing it would elicit a response from the stupid git. Gathering his thoughts on what to try next, Harry watched as Malfoy’s adam’s apple bobbed under the pale skin of his neck. And much to his dismay, Harry was hit with the desire to kiss Malfoy’s perfectly pale and soft neck.
I frowned. “Shove it.”
The air was crisp against his skin and the snow was falling slowly like it would in a snow globe; slow and obstructed by some invisible force. And Draco looked magnificent. His flying had always been brilliant, but he had grown more impulsive since the war and it showed in his flying.
It had been so long, so incredibly long, since Harry let himself feel anything other than guilt and regret. He’d boxed himself in with it, slept with it, ate with it—his constant companions. All the lives that had been lost for him, because of him, they were with him. All the people he’d hurt. He carried them with him every day, a reminder that he couldn’t let anyone get hurt because of him ever again.
“Next,” the portkey administrator said and we three walked up and took hold of a tarnished silver candelabra.
“I can still hear that scream,” Hermione said. She had her wand tucked behind her ear as she crouched down looking at the spot where the body had been. She picked up a clump of dirt and let it sift through her fingers and fall back to the ground.
Every part of Harry wanted to ignore his brain, which was moving a mile a minute, trying to understand why Draco hadn’t said anything. Obviously, he wasn’t completely disturbed by what Harry said, or he wouldn’t be kissing him...like
“I’m sorry, Gin.” I licked my lips. They were dry. “I’m sorry for everything.”
that one time, but he couldn’t think of any other...okay, maybe last week he might have wanked off in the loo after seeing Malfoy eating some fresh fruit, but that hadn’t been directly connected to Malfoy. It was just the way he ate the fruit, slow, savouring every bite, and—Merlin fucking fuck, was he attracted to Malfoy?
Draco nodded. “We just run and jump?”
Draco was still smiling and the earnestness of it make Harry’s breath catch. Sitting there across from Draco, Harry allowed himself to think all of those thoughts he had been boxing away. The swarmed inside of him like a hornet’s nest knocked on it’s side—buzzing and racing around in search of some unseeable thing.
I touched the stone and felt my magic humming under my skin again. “This is Neville’s granddad.”
“Er,” Harry mumbled. He was suddenly very uncomfortable and wanted to be anywhere but watching this situation play out. “I think I will go find that whisky afterall.”
Sir Hilliard gave him a withering stare that would have looked more at home on McGonagall’s face, and then said, “A great many late nights. Something amiss?”
Dean pulled Ron by the arm and ushered him to the outside area where I could see everyone standing near a long white table with food and drinks. There was another table to the right with all the housewarming gifts. Ron placed his on the pile and followed Dean to the small group.
A student must have enchanted the bottles to say to
“Next,” the portkey administrator called. The elderly couple ahead of us moved and took hold of an old book and blinked out of existence.
Potter shrugged. “It was starting to grow on me, actually. I thought we made some good progress back there with all that honesty stuff.”
,” he paused to smile softly and then continued, “for the challenge.”
“Yea, loads more.” I walked forward to the grave where the caretaker died. It was at the back of the cemetery, so I couldn’t see it yet. But if the caretaker was killed with magic, I would be able to see it thanks to the potion. Finally, I could get some answers.
. He did this four times before finally pouring his drink and walking away with a self-satisfied smirk that led Draco to believe that he may have been the mastermind behind the whooping bottle enchantment.
Mordeau’s was tucked back in an alleyway next to Seamus’s quidditch shop, out of sight from the Main Street of Hogsmeade. A rusted iron sign in the shape of a cauldron creaked in the slight breeze. I’d been inside only once before—when I went looking for Malfoy after the ministry function, but he hadn’t been in and it was probably for the best. I remember waking up that morning with a terrible hangover and my first thought was ‘Malfoy.’ I’d rushed to the shop before I even really thought about why. I hesitated at the door now, unsure how to ask him for the potion without telling him why I needed it.
“How are you getting worse as this?” Malfoy laughed that touchable laugh. I could feel it sliding along my skin like a lovers caress. “I didn’t think that was possible.”
“Hey, mate, good speech,” he said as I approached.
Harry did his best to keep from sounding nervous. “My point is, if we jump together and hold hands the whole way over without breaking apart…it means we would make a good couple. They say, if you can jump over holding hands the whole time, then that’s the person who’s your perfect match.” When Draco didn’t respond, Harry quickly added, “According to the very silly myth, of course.”
“And?” I deadpanned.
before I get a Bat-Bogey Hex tossed my way.” He nodded over Harry’s shoulder to where Ginny and Hermione stood. Ginny was watching them carefully. She didn’t look happy at all.
Harry would sneak out, sometimes using the invisibility cloak, sometimes he would just waltz out of the dorm, ignoring Ron’s curious looks. On nights when he used the cloak, he found himself wondering how Draco made it out to the pitch without anyone noticing. He never asked questions though, since the mystery of it was another part of the excitement.
I turned to walk back to the maze and didn’t get further than a few steps before that drawling voice flooded my ears. “And just where are you off to?”
“Alrigh’, shut it the both o’ ye. Follow me. Time fer yer punishment, I reckon. Each o’ ya, take this lis’.”
There was one pepper up potion at the back of the cabinet. Draco held the vile precariously in his hand, cupping it as if it were a dragons egg and could crack with the slightest pressure. If he took this, would it actually help him? Pepper up potions, if brewed right, only lasted so long. He looked at the vile and rubbed his thumb over the cork stopper. Something in his gut told him to put it back. Draco decided against taking a potion in that moment.
A warning Harry ignored.
There was a cracking sound and part of the mausoleum wall broke free just above Harry’s head. Particles and small pieces of stone rained down on him as the Succubus threw the stone across the room to Malfoy.
The only downside was one of Luna’s dearest friends happened to be Harry’s ex, Draco Malfoy, whom he hadn’t properly talked to since the end of eighth year. They were amicable enough when they passed one another at the Ministry, but outside of pleasantries, they’d hardly spoken over the last year, and certainly they’d avoided being at the same functions as often as possible. Neville and Luna’s party, however, wasn’t a charity function that he could donate a large amount of money to in lieu of attending.
“Yes, you will.”
I walked past Ron and George who were still stuffing their faces with small sandwiches. They both waved to me.
“I read her books, you know?” I tried to smile. “They’re rather good.”
“Yes, father. I was taking a stroll. It is such a lovely day, is it not?” Draco spoke the words with his back to his father. He let his mind linger a moment longer on his mother, sitting in that chair with her white-blond hair in a small bun at the nape of her neck. In his memory, she smiled softly at him and pleaded with him to get along with his father because underneath it all, he did care for Draco.
“Sacramentum verborum.” His voice was steady as he spoke the spell. Almost immediately a white and blue light streamed out from the tip of his wand and circled around our bodies. It swirled all the way from the ground to the tips of our heads. “Okay, so what potion is so secret that you needed privacy just to talk to me about it?”
“No,” Harry said firmly, “How about now?”
Skeeter sat down on the ottoman, scooting it closer to me. She wore a lime green dress suit. Her blonde hair was pinned back like she was a 1950’s movie star and she wore cherry red lipstick. Her cat eye frames made her look ever the reporter. “Mr. Potter, I have something I would like to discuss with you.”
“Sorry, Harry. It’s automatic, you know that. I just worry. I’m not surprised the party slipped your mind. The invites went out around the time you got the news of your hearing.”
Harry let out a small laugh. “I don’t.”
,” Harry said putting extra emphasis on Malfoy’s name. It was partly a tactic, but also partly an actual request because Harry’s will was slipping. The longer he stood this close to Malfoy, the more he felt turned on which seemed absurd because Malfoy had barely done anything except for gently hold Harry. And yet, he could feel the blood coursing through his body, and he could feel his cock growing hard against the fabric of his trousers.
Harry perked up at that. He wanted to know about Luna’s situation, if only to distract him from his own for five minutes, “Who?”
“The game?”
Auror Read’s hand shot up again, but this time he waited for Robards to acknowledge him before he spoke. “Are we sure it’s a Succubus and not a Vampire, sir. Some of the intel could easily point to Vampires, namely the ‘only comes out after dark’ part.”
“I’m going to devour you now,” Draco purred into Harry’s neck. His breath warm, and his words soothing. “You lovesick, fool.”
“Really?” Harry laughed, feeling relieved. Draco wanted to kiss him. It wasn’t a joke. Only his pride kept him from crashing forwards and capturing Draco in a kiss right then. “So all that deliberation over what you should and shouldn’t do…and it’s over boring old me?”
The air around them crackled with power, then it fizzled out. Potter scowled, so Draco put his hands up in defense. “All I’m saying is, pushing away every partner they assign you isn’t going to bring Thomas back.”
Malfoy smiled at Ned. “Have a nice evening,” he said, moving around the caretaker and taking off towards the stone path that led to the mausoleums at the back.
Ron burst out laughing. “She hates divination so much. Merlin, I love her but how can she be a muggle who found out about magic and not believe in divination? It’s almost too funny.”
To be addressed directly by the Dark Lord was supposed to be an honor, he knew. Especially since his father always made sure to remind him that it was an honor. However, this did not feel like an honor, it felt like a test. One that Draco feared failing. He knew what happened to people who failed. Quickly, he decided on a course of action.
“Well, yeah.” That was Ron’s way of saying ‘you’re right’ without actually having to say the words.
“Doesn’t matter?” Draco asked, a hint of annoyance in his tone. He was obviously awake now and pulling the blanket off. He stood up, walked around the couch to stand face to face with Harry. “What do you mean it doesn’t matter. Of course, it matters. I’ve left you notes. I‘ve run after you in between classes. Hell, I even stayed up playing chess with Ron until eleven last night hoping to catch a glimpse of you before bed.”
“It’s eerie that you two get along so well,” Seamus teased.
I turned to face him again. There was a fierceness in his eyes. A determination. He wanted me as badly as I wanted him and I could see it annoyed him. I was about to ask him if he wanted to get out of here when I heard it.
However, he found himself answering honestly. “Starring.”
Softly, Ginny whispered, “Not even him?”
I felt a tightness in my chest loosen at Ron’s words. I’d been afraid to tell him about Skeeter and her theory. I was worried he would think I was loosing it. I knew how it sounded. Another Ministry cover up so soon after Voldemort. It felt crazy even to me.
“Forgive me, this is my son, Draco,” Lucius spoke up before Draco had a chance.
“Why?” Draco couldn’t help but interrupt.
“He is being gone, Master Draco. He is saying for Master Draco to eat breakfast and meet him in his study when he gets back.”
It was clear Ned was interested in Malfoy, and Harry hated it. He was five seconds away from grabbing Malfoy by the arm and tugging him away from that man’s stupid gaze. It was pure willpower that kept him from acting on his impulse.
There was a pop in the air like static and Harry felt magic fill the room. It threatened to drown him. He felt Malfoy solid behind him. And then the flare of the potion shielding him. Flashes of Malfoy’s face rushed though his mind, warming him to the core. The potion worked, it blocked her magic from consuming him again. He let out a relieved breath. Parkinson had done it.
“I sent two letters after the trial inviting you to dine with me as a thank you for intervening and saving me from a most unfavorable situation. Both letters were met with no response and so I took it to mean you did not care to have an acquaintance with me.”
books were only mostly accurate and she hadn’t gotten much better in the years since. The only difference between Skeeter then and Skeeter now was that I agreed with her this time. Maybe that wasn’t enough for them, but it was for me.
“Oh, there are two of you,” she cooed when she saw Malfoy behind him, her flesh, or what counted as flesh, was charred black from the burning fire that she managed to put out somehow. “What a treat.”
After the fight with Draco, Harry finds himself back in the Gryffindor common room and Ginny is there.
“You jump, I jump, Jack,” Draco said, mimicking
To match Malfoy’s first move, Harry delicately placed his hand, palm down, on Malfoy’s chest just below his collar bone. Without thinking, he started to move his fingers gently back and forth across Malfoy’s chest. At this movement, Harry felt Malfoy’s breathing quicken.
Ron nodded in agreement. “Bug is putting it nicely.”
Before Harry could make a decision, Malfoy’s lips were on his and Malfoy’s free hand had moved to cup his chin. A wave of pleasure surged through Harry’s body as Malfoy deepened the kiss.
The Imperious was still holding him in the seat, but his father loosened the reigns on what he could say, so in spite of himself, Draco was curious. “The what?”
“I didn’t say that.”
Neville put his hand over mine and brought it a little higher up his thigh. He closed his eyes and breathed hard once. “Merlin, it’s tempting, but I’m not looking for a quick fuck anymore, Harry. That’s all you’d be offering, right?”
Hermione and Ron noticed one morning at breakfast that Harry was staring at Draco, not with contempt, but with a very dumb smile on his face. To be fair, Draco was returning his look with an even dumber smile plastered on his face. A piece of toast hanging in front of his mouth.
“So you didn’t feel anything at all? Like when we touched?” Potter searched Draco’s face like he was reading a particularly confusing passage in a textbook. “Parkinson said it took an already existing attraction? Amplified it, right?”
“Again, why not get it from the Hogwarts stores?” Malfoy asked. I had no idea what the ingredient looked like, let alone where it could be found, but he clearly knew. “I’m sure someone in the castle has a bottle for you. Or you could come to Mordeau's. We have a bit in stock.”
“Me?” Draco asked and turned to face the mirror instead of Potter. If he looked at Potter, he was sure to lose it. He watched his reflection. His face was flushed. It bothered him that his hair looked unkempt. He tried to tuck it behind his ears again. Maybe he should have let Luna spell his hair into a braid after all.
“And he wants to go out with me?”
There was no way to avoid being taken in by Draco’s appearance. No matter what he wore, he wore it with this easy confidence that radiated from him like a sunbeam. This outfit was no different. He wore a tailored gray suit the color of his eyes, with a white button up under his coat. He left the last few buttons undone, revealing the pale dip of his collar bone. His white-blonde hair was swept back, a few strands artfully falling around his face.
Potter smirked at Draco’s accusation. He looked down at his clothes—the jeans and white undershirt. “I wore this under my robes.”
“All right, I am sorry, Hermione. You know how sensitive our Ron gets. Ginny already knew, so if I didn’t tell him next, he would have had a fit,” Harry joked right back.
“Hey,” Ginny said. “Why are you hiding over here?”
“Ready, Potter?” Draco asked, turning fractionally and smirking. He didn’t wait for an answer, instead tugging Harry forwards with him.
After a few moments, Draco realized that somehow he let himself drift back into Mr. Potter. Their elbows brushed and the small touch sent a wild thrill through Draco’s body. It seemed to search for an appropriate place to lodge itself and settled for his stomach.
“Yeah?”
“I want…” he started, then leaned forward enough that their noses brushed. He smelled the whisky on Draco, and felt the warmth of his breath. “I think I’m going to kiss you.”
Harry swallowed his first response which would have gone something like “I was hoping to avoid you” and instead went with, “Fine, good. And how have you been? How’s working at the apothecary going?”
I looked at Sirius barking and smiled softly. He calmed down and sat at the front fo the portrait with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. “I—I was somewhere else.”
Harry glared defiantly at Draco and bit his bottom lip. “Yes, I remember.” He crossed his arms over his chest.
Once he caught a glimpse of it zooming downward to the ground, he chanced a look around to see if Draco noticed. And of course he had. Within seconds, Draco was on Harry, keeping pace with him. Their shoulders bumped and Harry felt himself shift off his broom slightly. Their proximity made Harry’s focus waiver and he felt himself losing his grip on the broom.
? Harry tried to think of who she meant, but all he could think about was the generous curves of her hips, and the taut muscles of her legs. He wanted to prop her up on a counter, spread her legs, and lose himself in pleasing her.
All the time, Nikola would not detach his gaze from Draco. This was to be expected. If there was one thing Draco knew about himself, without any shadow of doubt, it was that he was attractive. Not just normally attractive, either. No, he was
Harry distracted himself by walking around the office, away from Neville’s scrutinizing gaze, and leaned down to look at some of the plants as if he was interested in them, then he answered distractedly, “Have I?”
“Did I freak you out?” Charlie asked as he sat down next to Harry. He sat close and shoved Harry with his shoulder. It was meant to be affectionate, as it was so often how Charlie had approached Harry at the Burrow in the days after the war.
“Er, fine, oh—okay, but only for a moment.”
“Fuck,” I mumbled. The bottle was empty and I needed more if I was ever going to find solace in the pure oblivion that was passing out drunk.
“Is it? Hermione says I’m too harsh.” Potter looked delighted that Draco agreed with him. His face lit up and settled in a satisfied smirk. “She’s too concerned with what’s proper. I couldn’t give a flying hippogriff anymore.”
“I’m sure it will cross some of their minds.”
He pointed a finger at the thing, the Succubus that had been killing people all over London. “I can feel love just fine, lady.” Suddenly, he felt drunk. It was hard to stand without wobbling from one foot to the other. Part of him remembered the wand in his hand, and thought he should do something with it, but he couldn’t think what. The rain fell harder now, but he hardly registered it.
“Have you got one of those?” Potter asked, pointing behind him in the general direction Girl Weasley had walked.
“A few days ago.”
Harry sighed. “Find out soon enough, I reckon.” The meeting was a direct result of his mistake last night, and he didn’t feel like getting lectured by Ron since he knew Robards and Malfoy would both have plenty to say on the subject.
I shook my head. What could I say to make him understand? I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt when I could have done something to prevent it. That’s what drove me for my entire life. The danger was there and since I could stop it, I had to. It was as simple as that for me. Yes, some darker part of me enjoyed the life and death of it all. Or maybe enjoy isn’t the right word. I belonged to danger and had ever since my parents were taken from me. I understood it and I wasn’t afraid to risk my life. I had to try. End of story. But the fear in Ron’s face did give me a moments pause. He cared about me more than I gave him credit for in the last five years. I’d become so hellbent on numbing out the bad, I’d numbed out the good too.
“Harry, how are you?” Draco asked, letting his hand drop to his side. He clenched and unclenched his fist a few times before putting his hand casually into the pocket of his gray trousers.
Finally, Draco made eye contact. It was a searching look. And unsure look. Then Draco asked, “And your answer?”
“She’s right, I’m afraid.” Weasley crossed his arms and nodded in agreement.
“Already have someone,” Ned finished for him, eyeing Harry from over Malfoy’s shoulder. “I should have figured as much. Someone as gorgeous as you couldn’t be single.”
Draco woke that morning, well rested for the first time since his mother’s passing and suddenly he felt guilty. For it was unusual to wake so peacefully in the Manor. Even as a child he woke to anxiety pressing on his chest like an anvil. His only serenity had been his mother and the gardens. Once she died, he all but lost hope of ever feeling calm again.
and genuinely enjoyed his job, which was enough to amuse me by itself, but then I noticed the ink stains on his fingers and the extra quill tucked behind his ear and I felt myself smile.
“Sorry about that, Harry,” Neville said as he entered the office again, however, this time covered in dirt and wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.
Ron smirked. “You filthy liar. We all know Malfoy is like a walking Greek statue. Not enough that he’s bloody rich and talented at his job, he’s got to be good looking too?”
I shook my head again, wishing I hadn’t
“Maybe...
“Potter,” Malfoy groaned, but he didn’t move away.
need to save his energy.
. Though Draco felt it was unfair of his father to be annoyed that the man his father was going to offer him to was attracted to him. If Draco wasn’t mistaken, that was a good thing.
Luna laughed, but it seemed forced, or at least like she clipped it off faster than she usually would. “Right, so,” she turned and waved to someone, a bloke who was at least an inch taller than Draco and averagely handsome, if one was into the whole rom-com love interest look. He had brown hair, and a soft smile that he turned on Luna when she waved him over. Once he reached her side, she continued, “This is Ryder. Ryder, this is Draco. He is very smart, clever, and obviously very well dressed.” Then as an afterthought, she nodded to Harry. “And you know, Harry, of course. If only by reputation.”
“It’s brilliant,” Hermione said. “You’re brilliant, Draco.”
“I can’t help it if people want to stare at me, Potter.”
Lost in the thought, he found his feet had carried him to a back corner of the gardens which lay under the cover of large trees. The shade was comforting in the oppressive heat of a summer that lingered well into fall. The unwelcome sweat on the nape of his neck slide downward as he approached the small white garden table where he often found his mother reading in the late afternoon. It looked very empty now.
“Yeah. Clears my head. Especially when it’s cold out.” Harry followed his friend's gaze. It was trained on Hermione who was talking animatedly to some of the younger students. He didn’t recognize any of them. There were so many people Harry didn’t recognize, but they all knew his name, and they all came up to him like they were friends, and he was supposed to be nice to every single one of them. He wondered if he’d ever get used to that. Probably not.
.” His magic, weakened by the Succubus’ kiss, lessened the effect of the spell, only managing to push her a few steps back. But that was enough.
At the center of town, Hermione took a sharp left down a cobblestone road and headed to the house at the end of the street. The forest looked lush and green behind the house. It was a small cottage made of gray stone with a dark oak door cut to have a circular top. The front yard was perfectly green with wild growing flowers lining the yard and a few stone statues of mystical creatures in the middle of the flower beds. One a siren sitting on a rock ledge with her mouth hanging open in song and the other a centaur holding a bow and arrow taut as if it were aiming at some unseen foe.
“Say it anyway.”
Malfoy smirked, leaned in closer and said very matter of factly, “I could get you in the mood, Potter.”
Ron winced. “So who’s going to convince him to give us a potion that is still in it’s testing phase, is strictly for Ministry use only, oh, and also tell him that he doesn’t need to know why we need it?”
“How is the potion working?” Malfoy asked Hermione.
Draco scowled, but nodded his agreement. His body was still in overdrive from the touch, but he managed to start walking again, if a bit uncomfortably, toward the mausoleums. Potter walked beside him. He was quiet for a moment, then he spoke.
Finally Draco understood all those stupid Victorian romance novels his mother had made him read growing up. He’d thought them all ridiculous, getting flustered over something as innocent as a compliment from their love interest. And Potter hadn’t even directly complimented him, yet the feeling of falling consumed Draco to his core until he thought he might never feel surefooted again.
Every part of Draco was shouting at him. Some parts ordered him to extricate himself from this line of inquiry before he internally combusted, but other parts of him begged him to stay put and see what other interesting things would come out of Mr. Potter’s mouth.
I nodded. “I won’t drink today, how about that?”
“Yes.”
Hermione’s jaw dropped. “Oh.”
,” Malfoy cursed under his breath when he accidentally brushed against the person ahead of them in line. He sighed and looked around at everything except Harry, which Harry found odd because ever since they were eleven, it was a guarantee that wherever Harry looked, his eyes would eventually find Malfoy’s looking back at him.
“Malfoy, wait up, wait,” Potter said, his breathing a bit labored as he tried to catch up.
There was another whoop of cheers from the crowd. Luna held a finger to her lips to shush them. “We have gone a bit unconventional.”
“If we find her, I’m going to capture her. End of story.”
“Malfoy…” I reached out and put a hand on his back. I rubbed in circles trying to sooth him. His body was shaking. I felt it tremble under my hand. “Are you okay?”
kiss you?”
“What happened when your channels went no where?” I asked, ignoring the empty feeling slowly creeping in my stomach. “Was I supposed to let that boy die while we investigated the allegations? Was I supposed to drown him in paperwork?”
“So, let’s undress then?” Potter asked, leaning in closer. Draco watched Potter’s eyes in the reflection.
“You will need to prepare. Be ready at a moments notice to travel there.”
A scream. It was quiet at first. Easy to dismiss as something else, but then it grew louder and I scanned the party to see where it was coming from. A buzz of voices murmured once the scream stopped. Everyone looking panicked as they checked on other people at the party.
, Draco decided,
I nodded. “Fine. Just dizzy.”
Harry’s breath hitched. “Really?”
Harry patted Neville on the back. “Tell her I said she looks lovely.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, unsure how to argue that point.
“I said, I’ve seen you in my own visions. I had hoped to talk to you about them at the memorial, but you were hardly alone that day and I didn’t wish to speak with you in front of Mrs. Granger-Weasley since her disdain for divination is very clear.”
“Go out with me.” Harry smiled. It was a gamble, but if the way Draco was looking at him were any indication, Harry was sure the answer would be yes.
“You are beautiful, Draco,” Harry whispered the words against Draco’s lips. Then their lips brushed agasint one another, soft and slow. Harry felt shaken. His breath erratic. He pulled away briefly, but found Draco’s lips followed him and captured him in a deeper kiss. Their mouths opening to one another. Perfectly matched, even in this.
“Merlin, no. That man loves you too much to reveal secrets, even to me. I figured it out, of course. Ginny isn’t the only perceptive witch in your life,” Hermione smiled wryly and winked.
Harry smiled, but kept his eyes shut. “I’m awake, arse.”
That made Potter laugh. Actually laugh. Okay, so it was a chuckle, but still. Draco felt the muscles of his cheeks fighting off his own smile. Potter had laughed
Hermione’s office was on his way to the Auror department and he had, hastily, decided on his lunch break to tell Hermione everything before he headed back to his own desk.
Instead, Draco crouched down near Potter’s sleeping form and whispered, “Potter, wake up.”
. He took the file and held it up. “You mean this one?”
, a bit longer than that.”
The rain persisted and I had to cast a goggle charm over my glasses to keep them from fogging up. The humidity in the air rose as the rain pounded agasint the dirt.
“Merlin. You must really hate your life, maybe even hate yourself, if you prefer to spend your days down here bothering us.”
And then there were his eyes which Draco was sure he never noticed before now. If he had, he would surely have been more wary of Potter in school. Those eyes were like a warning. One Draco decided to ignore.
“Uhhh, why?”
Harry tries to study, really, but after everything that happened between them, how the hell is he supposed to just sit there and not be kissing Draco?
Draco sighed, sat back on the bench and yanked Harry upright. “Not that I’m not excited to have some company in the ‘life sucks club,’ but I feel I must tell you, it sounds so weird coming from you, of all people.”
And if it were under any other circumstance, Harry might not have given the article a second thought, but Hermione was right; it definitely would make his crush skittish. Admittedly, Harry knew if he had seen an article like that about the other man, he would have given up entirely.
Malfoy stood up and walked closer to where Harry was still crouching. His wand shone like a spotlight on Harry. His eyebrow was raised and his smirk was devious. “You find my humming amusing, then?”
After the coat room, he mostly ignored my advances with the exception of the memorial and the party, of course, but that didn’t stop me. I liked the challenge, the back and forth. It was exciting.
“Nice night isn’t it?” Charlie's voice came from behind Harry, but Harry didn’t turn around. He wasn’t ready to look Charlie in the face, yet.
“It is simple. You have much in common, I’d say.”
“Oh-kay,” Potter said, elongating the word. “So that means you had already accepted your attraction and that...that I hadn’t?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but didn’t protest any more. He was squatting instead of kneeling in the grass which, of course, was so very Malfoy of him to be worried about grass stains when they were about to engage in a fight.
His wand felt alive in his hand, it pulsed as he gripped it. The wood scraping along his skin, the magic sparking as he stepped out of the mausoleum and sent up red sparks for his partner. Miraculously, the spell worked. They had a Succubus to capture.
Not anymore. Once, he had believed his family was honored by the Dark Lord’s presence. That they were chosen because they were powerful. Now, he realized the Dark Lord chose them because his father was a coward who would do anything the Dark Lord asked, even if it meant his wife’s death.
Potter smiled, and it was unbelievably attractive. “Definitely. Next time, I will.”
Harry nodded. “Really? Have you asked him why he’s messing with ambient magic?”
“So, what brings you all the way out here?” Neville asked as he rounded the room and picked up a watering can and preceded to water the plants in quick succession.
Harry pulled up and sucked at the tip of Draco’s cock. He knew it drove Draco mad when he teased like that. He wanted to hear Draco beg for it. It was his favorite part; hearing how badly Draco wanted him.
“Well, I better stop monopolizing the
Before anyone could answer, the door to the shop swung open accompanied by a small bell ringing. Harry turned around to see Draco, his white-blonde hair windswept, a pale blue scarf tucked around his neck, wearing a long black cloak.
Hermione looked a little pale under her expertly guarded ‘scholar’ face that she wore when she was studying. “You swear to tell us if you feel any side effects?”
Potter smiled sheepishly. “Having a friend like Hermione comes in handy sometimes.”
I wanted to lose myself for a little while and sex worked for me, well that and alcohol but like an idiot I left that at home. Those were probably a few of the reasons Ginny and I didn’t work out. She wanted a commitment, a life together, and I just wanted someone to fuck the memories of the last seven years out of me. I wanted to forget.
“I’m just saying, it’s sort of impressive. How many other wizards do you know that have control of their magic like that? Sure, he’s a tosser, but he is good at what he does.”
“I don’t want to fight with you either, Harry. I’m just worried about you. We all are. I mean, we expected you to need time after the war to process things, but it’s been five years and sometimes I worry that you’re worse off now then you were five months after the war.”
Unfortunately, Draco found himself caring about Mr. Potter’s opinion in his current state, though he would be remiss to admit to it aloud. He worked to foster a new image of himself, one that rejected his previous misgivings and misalliances. Partly, it was in hopes of attracting the attentions of Mr. Potter, who he fancied for some time, foolhardy as it was, and partly, he had been able to see the errors of his ways and a genuine change had not been completely unfavorable.
Hermione led us down the deserted roads of Hogsmeade to the portkey station around two in the morning. She staggered a bit and leaned down to take her heels off. She tried to transfigure them, but they ended up looking like her heels only with sneaker soles. She let out a laugh so loud, someone from inside their home shouted, “Quiet!” That only made her laugh harder.
.” He couldn't believe he actually said Potter. Out of everyone there...he said Potter. He had meant to say Granger. He was going to say Granger. Instead he said Potter.
“You’re bleeding.”
Draco shook his head. “Right, silly question.”
Harry’s mouth went dry when he realized that feeling he was feeling wasn’t just lust, or even friendship. He’d felt those before, and this, what he felt, was more immense, more encompassing, and more wonderful. Draco dizzied him, made him feel foolish, free, and understood all at once. He was sexy, intelligent, challenging, frustrating, and the most interesting person Harry had ever met. That all added up to one thing. Didn’t it?
?” Though Draco wasn’t sure if he meant Potter or himself.
Quickly, he cast a silencing charm on his room and locked his door. He had some time before dinner, so he let himself picture Potter on his knees, in his binds, sucking and licking. His already achingly hard cock was throbbing by the time he yanked his trousers to the floor and wrapped a cool hand around himself. With each pull, he felt the heat in his stomach coil—building and building, until the heat exploded forth as he whispered Potter.
Licking his lips, Charlie sighed and leaned his forehead against Harry’s. Their lips were breathes apart and Harry couldn’t feel his hands or feet. They were a mess of pins and needles as he waited to see if Charlie was going to do anything.
“So what is my Dare then?” Draco asked, trying to sound unafraid. It was best to never show your enemy fear. Or at least that’s what his father taught him—for whatever good it did him.
“Who knew a prat like you could be any fun at all?” George squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder and I felt my magic humming under my skin. It was agitated by their closeness.
“You, well, you’re like this paragon of, of…” Draco stopped, seemingly searching for the right word, “
Malfoy laughed and jerked his hand back like he was trying to break the spell again. I tightened my grip on his hand. His eyes flicked up to meet mine. “Potter, let go of me.”
Laughing loudly enough to wake the entirely of Grimmauld Place, Ron leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees and then said, “I can see that. But what I don't get is why you are acting as if your world has ended, mate.”
“Can I ask you something?” Harry asked after a moment of silence in which he managed to over analyze how close Draco was sitting to him and how his left hand was suggestively close to Harry’s bicep.
“I have visions,” I said.
“Yes, you might stop me, but you might also burn him in the process, and you won’t take that risk, will you?” She sniffed the air, again reminding him of a hound tracking a downed deer. “I may not be able to trap your minds, but the stench of attraction is all over you. You love him, don’t you?”
Skeeter extended her long boney hand and I took it, hoping I wasn’t making a deal with the devil.
“They didn’t know everything, so they didn’t know what to erase. He apparently had another smaller incident earlier that week. They didn’t take that memory from him and after that, all it took was some serious spell work and a legilimens to restore the ones they managed to obliviate.”
want to kiss
Once they both touched ground, Harry felt his heart hammering in his chest. He wanted to say something—anything—to make Draco understand what he was feeling.
Harry is alone on his birthday and gets a drunk call from Draco.
Robards raised his voice and added, “Do not engage without backup.” He paused and eyed Harry seriously. “Make sure you are properly armed and that you inform me before you head out to do any surveillance. We cannot let another person die on our watch. Understood?”
“Why?”
The gifts were under Ron’s arms, both wrapped in an off white paper with blue
“Yes, right. Whoever gives in first, loses.”
. I like it when you say it like that.” Potter took a step forward as he said this, making the small bathroom seem infinitely smaller. Draco tried to back up, however, there really wasn’t anywhere to go in the small room. He practically fell in the toilet to avoid being too close to Potter.
“Some odd ramblings about avoiding a call, plus we found a sketch for something like a magical storage device. What’s that Muggle thing that keeps your wireless running, again?”
I stood up. “I’m going to take a walk. I’ll be back in a few.” When Hermione gave me her panicked ‘but you’ll be late’ look I decided to send her on a guilt trip of my own. “Nerves. It’s my first time back here after finishing. I feel a bit out of sorts.”
He looked good as always, which grew easier to admit after our recent encounters. His pale blonde hair was styled back like usual, but with less product, he looked less intentional about it. Like he’d woken up, ran his hands though his hair and walked out. He wore a sheer white button up with a blue-gray shirt underneath that made his eyes look like stormy waters. The shirt hung open a bit at the top, revealing a touch of his lean pale skin. He looked relaxed and formal all at the same time. I wanted to shove him against a wall to release some of the tension I felt mounting after my anxiety attack in the Ministry. Though I wasn’t sure if I wanted to punch him for always showing up when I felt like shit or kiss him until I couldn’t think anymore. Either would suffice really.
Draco twisted in the mirror. The lines still fell right and forget-me-not blue had always been his color. It accentuated his gray eyes and his pale, ethereal features. He would adamantly deny it to anyone else, but in part he wanted Potter to see him in these robes. There was a good chance that last night was an anomaly and Draco was prepared for that, but if it wasn’t an anomaly so much as a fluke that could be recreated, then he wanted to look his best.
I nodded. “Could that be why the trace spells didn’t work here?”
Hermione winced and cupped his face with her hand. “Those are hard. Do you need to talk about it?”
Harry sighed, and wished he could keep on sighing until all the air left his body and he could pass out. “
“I had to try, Harry. You understand, don’t you?” Charlie sounded scared now and Harry felt sympathy for him. It quickly replaced whatever anger he felt at first.
I shrugged. “Maybe.”
I licked my lips. “Yes, very interested,” I said but when I saw him, I knew that wasn’t the answer he was hoping for.
His grin wavered. “Shame.”
“Okay. See?” Draco said as if his entire point was made by Harry’s agreement that they both wanted to remain in one another’s lives.
Harry thought quickly, either he could tell Neville the truth that he was interested in Draco, or he could walk out of here a feign disappointment. He decided to keep his secret a bit longer. “Well, no shame in asking, eh?”
The buzzing was still dull in my ears. I looked around and saw nothing except the man, so I jogged toward him. There was no wind. Nothing to tell me I was moving except my feet hitting the ground and the trail of green disappearing behind me. The air suddenly smelled like wet dirt. I swallowed hard and kept my focus on the man, but he was fading away. I reached out to him but felt my body jerk side to side. The last thing I saw before hitting the ground was the man turning slowly. The side of his face was blackened like the rest of the forest.
She laughed. “Almost a year. I’m happy, Harry.”
Pansy only stared at Draco in shock. It was clear in her expression that she had not intended to upset him in such a way. Her normally composed face wore worry lines around the eyes and an expression of pity that Draco wished she would wipe from her face in the quickest fashion.
However much Potter struggled against the binds, he made no attempt to stand up. He had learned by now that trying to stand, face-to-face with Draco, was futile as the binds were too tight.
on the man without the Succubus catching on and thwarting them. Harry didn’t want to admit it, but talking seemed to be the only real option on the table.
Obligingly, Harry refilled Ron’s glass and then his own, making them both doubles. Then he considered for a moment. How had it happened? Harry was, himself, still working on that one, but he settled on saying, “It happened because of Quidditch.”
“No.” Draco snorted. “Not bloody likely.”
“Then explain.”
I took his hand. His long fingers curled around my wrist. He tugged me closer, so we were less than an arms length apart. I could feel his pulse against my fingers. My magic reacted to him. I felt it coursing through me like a river current rushing downstream.
“Let’s just focus on the case, Potter.”
that smell. He swallowed again, and laughed.
Harry was beginning to think Draco had lost his mind. He was sneaking out of family dinners, and now he wanted to jump over a fire. “
At least at breakfast, there was tea.
I sipped my tea and purposefully licked my lips as slow as I could mange. “I changed a bit. I think I’m rather a good flirt now.”
Harry was about to head over and save Hermione from getting hexed when someone’s hand touched his elbow. He turned slowly, first looking down at the pale hand and slender fingers, then his eyes trailed up past the pale expanse of neck, angular jawline, and settled on the smoke-gray eyes of Draco Malfoy.
It was all Malfoy’s fault. Harry had never had any issues sharing the cloak with Ron and Hermione and Ron was more lanky than anyone Harry had ever met. He never considered there would be a problem sharing the cloak with one person when he so often had done so with two. Yet, Harry should have known Malfoy was not just any person and that the mixture of their personalities would result in trouble.
“So you’re still Harry Potter and whatever civility we’ve managed over the last few years doesn’t erase the rest of it. Sure, you’re attractive—don’t smirk at me, you know you’re attractive, but I can’t stand you. You’re arrogant and insufferable and a pain in the arse.”
He feared he would lose her to her own ill-advised motives which would leave him alone with Mr. Potter and nothing seemed more unpleasant to Draco than that.
I looked back at Odette who was frowning down at her desk. “Really?”
“I don’t know about you,” Potter said, his lips curling into a rueful smile, "but I don't like asking for help; hell, I don't really even like needing help. I grew up alone. No one took care of me. I did it all. Raised myself. Relying on people was new to me when I got to school. Hermione, Ron, all of my friends, I knew they were there for me. But I still tried to go it alone most of the time. Out of habit, or pride, I don't really know. They refused to let me, but that didn't mean I liked it. To me, needing someone was dangerous...for them, for me."
“I think so. I see golden dust wrapping itself around me.” I held my hand up experimentally and watched the golden dust move with me. It was like it had attached itself to my person.
Lamont nodded but looked torn about leaving Robards with us. If he was concerned, he didn’t voice it. Instead he jogged to Reed and they both headed out of the cemetery.
Harry grabbed Draco’s hands again, interlocking their fingers. “Then say yes. I’m going crazy here. I’m all in. I told you I was all in a million times. I’m all in, Draco. I need this to happen.”
“This is the story of eternal love, celebrated at the Summer Solstice each year,” a voice boomed over the crowd. It sounded like Hermione, but Harry couldn’t be completely sure because it echoed over the rowdy crowd of students, professors, and villagers from Hogsmeade who were all gathered around flickering bonfires that had been placed along the slopes of the highlands. “Of two souls who met, fell in love, and yet had to spend their days apart, separated by long, dark nights. That is, until the days grew longer, allowing them to touch briefly on the nights when Dawn and Dusk got closer. They were so in love, they waited all year for just a moment with one another. And today, we celebrate that love by burning fires for the same good fortune in love and life as those two eternal lovers. It is said that jumping the flames brings good fortune and if done with your love, can predict whether the match will last…”
Harry blinked up at him, all too aware of how, this close, he could smell Draco’s soap — lavender and early spring. He inhaled, letting the scent wash over him. Now, that was a little disconcerting, almost as much as the fact that Harry
“Potter.” Draco’s voice came out breathy, and he hated it.
“How did you know it was us?” I said standing up in full view now. I stepped around the bush and Malfoy followed suit. He was fanning his face with his hand.
Robards shook his head, but I could see a hint of doubt in his eyes. “Your hearing in coming up and you’re scared so you want to invent a cover up to distract from the fact that you broke the law. That’s what this is, right?”
“Let’s go,” Ron said and headed off to the back of the yard. I took one more look at Malfoy and Hermione and as they entered the house, she began casting some protection spells. Malfoy seemed to wake up at that and began helping her.
“The guests will arrive shortly. We are to greet them in the main foyer. Then we will have drinks in the sitting room. Dinner will follow. I expect you to be charming,” Lucius spoke these words carefully. They were decorated with a challenge that seemed to say: if you step out of line, there will be nasty consequences.
There was a quiet chorus of shocked
“Kiss me,
“Did you really expect anything different?” Ron asked, giving Harry a sympathetic smile. He looked past Harry, and smiled at Malfoy, who was apparently still watching them, then added, “Look, he did really well in training, and we both know he has more to prove than anyone in the DMLE, especially considering… you know? Maybe, and I cannot believe it is me saying these words, but...maybe cut him some slack?”
Ned watched Malfoy intently, and for a moment Harry wondered if he could get away with hexing this guy’s smile off his stupid face. Harry clenched his jaw while he watched Ned’s eyes rake up and down Malfoy’s body. Tension coiled around Harry’s gut, and he clenched his wand. He was being ridiculous, wasn’t he? This guy could flirt with Malfoy. What did he care?
Hermione shook her head, but she was smiling at her husband. “Madame Eloise Mintumble is buried here, you know?” She pointed to a gravestone a few feet away from where we stood. The stone read Lost in Time, Remembered with Love. “The witch who got stuck in the past. She is one of the main reasons time travel is restricted. One of the anomalies her time travel caused made the Tuesday after her return to her present last for two and a half full days.”
Harry comes home to find Ginny has read the letter he wrote for Draco. Big Emotions again, brace yourselves.
After the battle, I think I got bored, everything moved too slow. Maybe that’s part of why I imploded my career—just so I had something exciting to do. Something that was as blood-pumping as dueling with Voldemort. Something that made me feel like I was on the edge of destruction. Maybe I really was trying to ruin my own reputation like Ron said. Go figure.
So, when an uninvited witch managed to make he way onto the Auror’s floor, Harry was shocked. Firstly, because his wards were perfect and secondly, it was Pansy Parkinson.
The light coming from the sitting room was bright as if every candle in every sconce was lit. I knew it wasn’t Hermione or Ron because they would have just come up to my room, so whoever was here was not likely a friend.
“So, some Life Energy must taste better than others, like say wizards versus Muggles, and if she’s not a picky eater anymore…” Harry trailed off, letting Malfoy put the pieces together.
“You are like spectre,” a voice came from behind Draco. The thick accent told him it was a someone from Durmstrang.
“What ? Suddenly you have no quips for me?”
With their height difference, Draco was left staring at Potter’s forehead, and effectively, his scar. Thanks to their new proximity, Draco could almost feel each of Potter’s ragged, drunk breaths against his own chest.
I forced myself to relax my hand in his, letting my fingers soften against his skin. I could hear my heart beating furiously as if I had just pulled a wronski feint to grab the snitch and win the game. I watched Malfoy’s face as we stood there, hands still touching and realized the spell had faded around us. I didn’t pull my hand away and neither did Malfoy. He watched me with those dark-gray eyes that were like standing at the edge of a storm. They were tempting and dangerous and I was afraid I would drown in them if I wasn’t careful.
as well. Then Harry heard the crunch of his footsteps moving in the opposite direction. Harry turned his head slightly to watch Malfoy from his periphery. He knelt down and examined a small white-petaled flower at the base of the tree. It seemed to grow out from a knot in the tree’s roots. Malfoy’s tongue flicked out in concentration and then his eyes set in a determined way before he removed one of his gloves to stroke the petal, making sure it was soft enough to be collected. His long index finger stroked the petal from stamen to the outer edge. Then he repeated the motion on the other petals. Seemingly satisfied, Malfoy plucked the first petal he stroked and placed it in one of the jars.
A soft chuckle came from the Succubus. “Mm, did desert follow me home? Oh, I remember you. My little sour milk. Have you come for more?” Her voice hit Harry like a brick to his gut, and he felt paralysed. It was still the husky voice he heard before, only it sounded displaced coming from her haggard mouth.
“Uh, long story,” Harry said with a nonchalant flick of his wrist. This was his chance to slip it into conversation without seeming desperate,, “So, how's the new guy? Is he catching on quick enough?”
Draco paused before answering. Part of him really did enjoy this—being treated like scum, especially by Potter. And another part of him liked inflicting pain. So he answered honestly.
Luna smiled at him, and said, “That’s true.”
I spotted the edge of a file that read: Malfoy, Draco [ex-Death Eater, Potion Master and Ministry Freelancer] on it under a pile of memos we also decided to toss around. I took it out last week to add in the most recent report he filed on a potion he was creating for the Ministry to make tracing magic simpler.
Harry Potter’ and not as just Harry, so dating was exhausting even before all that. Then one of my best friends died saving my life.” Potter paused, swallowing hard. “I felt guilty being alive when he wasn’t. Then it sort of spiraled, bringing with it all the other people who were dead because of me. I didn’t know how to be okay with that, and I promised myself I wouldn’t let it happen again, so I decided I was better off alone...until, that is, they partnered me with you.”
“Your turn,” Potter said, breaking Draco from his revere. “It looks like you have a few more buttons to undo.”
“Because right now is...
“I need to be there to monitor your vitals in case something goes wrong. Imagine the headlines if you die with my potion in your system. They would chase me out of England with pitchforks even if you’ve completely decimated your reputation.”
His reflection still seemed to want to run back up to the castle and the safety of his dorm, but he ignored it and unlocked the door. The bathroom door swung open before Draco could even blink and a very drunk Harry Potter stumbled inside. The man’s face was flushed red. His right hand was tightly gripping the neck of an unlabeled bottle of alcohol. It swished in the bottle. The clothes he wore were some muggle fashion that Draco never fully understood; just a plain white t-shirt and a seemingly old pair of jeans. Seemed more like clothes to garden in rather than wear to a party.
That one wasn’t true. I only slept with Carlie. The seeker, Janelle, got jealous and threw a fit. “I don’t understand. Sure, I’ve hooked up with a lot of people. You obviously know that. It’s all over the papers and it seems you’ve read all of them.”
Dean had jumped in front of the curse, the green flash of magic crashing into his chest, and died in Harry’s arms while the culprit made a quick exit. Harry had searched and searched for Dean’s killer after. Months of searching the lowest, grimiest places of wizarding London until he’d found him and apprehended him. The man was rotting in Azkaban, but it hadn’t brought Dean back. It hadn’t erased the fact that someone else had died for Harry.
I nodded in understanding the divination professors were always quirky, if not completely insane. “How’s it been here? I haven’t seen you much since you started teaching.” Changing the subject was the only safe way to avoid having to answer his question.
In answer, Ron took a sip of his drink, winced as it went down, and nodded. “Yup. I told her that I want to work with George at the shop. I told her I’ll consider finishing the year and taking my NEWT’s, but that I don’t want to be an Auror anymore. No offense, mate, but I can’t keep fighting. I’m tired.”
Harry felt himself let out a breath that turned into a laugh. Of course, he liked it. He liked it more than he wanted to admit. But that wasn’t the point. The point was, how the hell was he supposed to focus on the snitch when Draco looked like that?
“Why?” Harry asked, bewildered.
like her. But she only had a few weeks with the painting to teach it her memories before she died. At best, the portrait was a poor facsimile of his mother.
Harry chanced a look at his partner and found Malfoy searching the map behind Robards rather than scowling in Harry’s direction, which was what he’d half been expecting considering their past and the fact that Malfoy was clearly mad at him. He hadn’t even bothered with good morning pleasantries when they’d arrived for work. He had just sat at his desk and ignored Harry until the memo for this meeting dropped on both their desks that afternoon calling for an evening briefing before everyone headed out. Then he’d told Harry he would see him in there and stalked off.
“You’ll regret this, wizard,” she growled, and shoved the dumpster away. Her face shifted before him, revealing a greying, aging face. Her eyes a putrid yellow, and her hair hung around her face like twisted vines on a decaying tree.
“Mmm,” Luna hummed as she dragged her quill lazily across the parchment, taking her notes as Harry talked, “And when was it that you realized you liked men?”
unwell. I am better now that I have rested.”
“Nothing, did you meet the new Divination professor?” I was getting pretty good at changing the subject.
Hermione and Ron had been helping him avoid some of the more aggressive fans who had surfaced after the article. People had begun waiting outside Grimmauld Place, or in spots where they knew Harry frequented. Basically, he was resorting to glamours and charms until he got into work.
Robards flicked his wrist, and in front of everyone appeared a red file with the word
“Which is not very.” Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco and shoved him with his shoulder one more time.
“The lights,” I said gesturing around the room. “Too bright.”
Draco moved toward the door to chase after his partner, but Pansy grabbed his forearm. She gave him a soft, concerned look. “You need to be more careful than him. You’ve had feelings for him for a long time. That could manifest in the potion in unforeseen ways.”
“Thank you...I think. Anyway, as I said, we could use your help. Have you noticed anything odd around the last month or so?”
A warm tear slid down Harry’s cheek. He wiped it off with the back of his hand, feeling embarrassed even though there was no one around to witness his pathetic display. He gathered up his things off the pitch, tucking his broom under one arm and made his way back to the castle.
Draco was inconsequential and had always been. Even when Mr. Potter helped his family after the war, after Draco made a very public mistake in siding with the Dark Lord that cost him his position in society, he was inconsequential. It was not something he had done for Draco, rather something he had done simply because he was that ridiculously noble and insufferably moral.
Draco sleeps without nightmares for the first time in a long time. His encounter with Potter the night before still reeling in his mind. However, he must wake up and face the day and that means facing his father.
The beast had turned the ground to rot the last time I saw him. It looked like I could bring it back to life. Art least temporarily. I didn’t understand it, but I took another step and then another.
I watched the air near his wand for something like the golden dust I’d seen come from the potion. After a moment, I saw a blueish light lingering in the air around him with a small wisp leading back to his wand. It was more solid-looking than the trace from the potion. Maybe potions and spells present differently because they are different kinds of magic.
“You’ve been weird lately, if you don’t mind me saying,” asserted Neville.
“I know what it looks like when someone is trying to implode their life. I’ve been on that particular edge myself.”
“They also say I have a devilish smile,” I said, leaning to rest my elbows on my knees. I reached out and placed my hand on Neville’s knee. I stroked my my thumb over the slick fabric of his slacks. “Do you agree?”
“Okay.”
THE END
“Probably,” Harry answered. His breath caught in his chest. There was something so suggestive about everything Draco was doing. The tight clothes. The winking. The innuendo.
“No?” There was shock all over Draco’s face. Shock and betrayal. He arched an eyebrow at Harry. “What do you mean ‘no’?
Malfoy’s smile abruptly shifted into a frown. It was so sudden, Harry wondered if he’d said something offensive and somehow missed it in his heady, aroused state. He opened his mouth to ask, but then the line moved forward and they were next up. The witch behind the counter looked up and gasped when she saw him. “Oh, Mr Potter, Auror Potter, sir, how may I help you?”
Gently, Ginny placed her hand into one of Harry’s and interlocked their fingers. She stroked her thumb back and forth and then said, “I suppose he wouldn't. I expect it will be a shock to everyone, yeah?”
It was even evident in their day time dynamic, which up until the night, had remained the same as it always was—to everyone, they were still enemies. Now, their interactions during the day were punctuated with smirks, knowing head nods, and looks that communicated unspoken understandings.
“I’m a curse breaker, Potter, you think your silly wards can stop me?” Pansy spoke and brushed some ash off of the fronts of her robes, then she slicked her hair down and tucked it behind her ears.
“So, you’re my perfect match, then. The fires have spoken,” Draco said, laughter in his words, as he sat down on the bench. “Guess that figures; I spent most of my life thinking about you, though most of the time, I
It was too quiet, too peaceful, after what happened here yesterday. I tried to ignore the memory of the dead caretaker’s screams. The ground was still wet, but the sun was bright in the sky, warming my back as I stood on the spot where he died.
“Relax, Harry,” Charlie whispered and handed him a glass of whiskey. He smiled warmly and Harry couldn’t help but relax. Charlie had a way of helping him calm down, especially after the war.
He tilted his head to the side and scrunched his brow. “Um, what makes you think I would give you a potion that is still in its testing phase? I mean, even if it wasn’t totally illegal to give you proprietary materials, the potion isn’t fully complete and that means it’s dangerous. I’m not putting my arse on the line for anyone, not even the Golden Boy. Plus, we aren’t friends, so what makes you think I would help you anyway?”
I was standing suddenly. My legs still shaky, but I managed to make it to the bathroom door. I unlocked it and pulled open the door. I felt lightheaded, so I leaned on the door frame and steadied my gaze. Ginny’s face came into focus.
A pained expression took over Hermione’s face. It was somewhere between a wince and a smile, “How do I say this politely? You don’t exactly know how to deal with feelings. Remember Cho? You literally didn’t even realize she wanted you to ask her out for like months. And let’s not even get started on Ginny.”
His partner gave him a curt nod and said, “It’s still bothering me that she’s trying to cast. Why is she trying to do magic? She has to know it won’t work.”
Harry growled out Draco’s name, but he wasn’t listening. He had started unfastening Harry’s trousers, sliding them down enough to get a better grip on things, so to speak. He nipped at Harry’s lower lip. The sharpness of his teeth sent a jolt of pleasure to Harry’s fingers and toes. Draco knew exactly what to do to drive a moan from Harry’s lips.
“Oh, well, right. This afternoon is Dean and Seamus’s garden party. For their housewarming.”
“It’s only practical.” Harry shrugged and leant in until his lips found Draco’s. They kissed lightly again, a subtle pressing of lips to lips. Harry kept his hands in his lap, afraid that if he touched Draco he’d never be able to stop.
Quietly, Potter grunted, which only made Draco’s groin burgeon with desire. Something that had begun to happen once he started to be physical with Potter. He did his best to push the thoughts from his mind, but when he was alone, the fantasy of owning Potter grew wildly and frantically strangling him like a devils snare. He couldn’t help himself when he responded.
Hermione smiled, I think. Like I said, it’s hard to tell with fire-calls. “See you in a bit, Harry.”
“You won’t.” And Harry was more sure about this, than he had been about many things. Draco was just being cautious like Hermione had predicted. So, Harry had to be completely and perfectly clear about his intentions.
“Yeah, dating someone. Sorry mate.”
Pansy took the form and filed it away in its proper place before moving to a glass cabinet and taking out two phials of a red liquid. “Drink this, and hopefully you’ll be immune. Give it like five minutes to kick in, and if it works it should give you about seven hours of use.”
Harry smiled at Draco, and it was such a big smile that his cheeks hurt. “You want to kiss me?”
Harry’s whole face turned beet red. He felt his throat dry up and all words failed him while Draco turned back to Ryder, maneuvering their bodies so Draco stood with his back flush to Harry’s front. He’d even taken one of Harry’s hands and snaked it around to rest on the front of Draco’s torso covering Harry’s hand with his own.
Draco’s stomach lurched. Either choice felt like it would subject him to a litany of unwanted attention. His initial thought was to pick Truth, but then what was to stop questions about Voldemort or the war? So before he could think more on it, he shouted out, “Dare!”
“Wait,” Draco said breathless. His lips were red and his pupils blown. He stood up, straightened his robes, fixed his hair and moved to open his office door, then called. “Margie, cancel my evening appointments. Actually, cancel my morning ones, too.” At the door, Draco waited for her response then turned around, shut the door and leaned against it. “Now, where were we?”
Draco, on the other hand, had not stopped flying since taking off. He circled the pitch, his head held high, his eyes narrowed. Harry was reminded of a bird of prey. The only issue—was the snitch the prey, or was Harry?
It was a box for all my bad memories and being trapped in it for a year after the war only made me anxious and a bit moody. But I kept on moving forward, checking off all the boxes that said I was adjusting and never slowing down long enough to realize I hated all of it. I did my NEWTs, I played Quidditch, I made nice with the Slytherins and even managed a mostly civil stalemate with Draco Malfoy. But it all felt…fake. Like I was just doing what I was supposed to do, going through the motions. I hoped it would be different when I was an auror and away from the constant reminders of what happened to me, but even that felt forced after a while. Maybe that explained all my self-destructive behavior. Maybe it didn’t.
Potter scoffed, but Nikola ignored him and moved closer to Draco. The whole situation hit Draco like a quaffel to the stomach. Nikola was coming on to him in the cellar. He was moving closer and closer, until Draco found himself backed against the wall. The stone was like ice on his back. He shuttered away from it, knocking him forward into Nikola. Arms were suddenly wrapped around his waist and Draco’s head was swimming from the wine. He chided himself to drinking more than he should. He was completely out of control in the situation and that worried him.
“I’m happy to do it. You’ve done two years of probation. You deserve to be released. I’ll write the letter and send it to...your lawyer?”
I set my jaw. “I need that potion.”
“Crazier than any of the rest of your life?” Malfoy asked. His voice was back to normal.
. Even Voldemort being in power can’t change that about you. No amount of perceived power will make you stronger than me, you arrogant, insufferable, miserable little cock.”
Potter laughed bitterly. “I should have told you the Succubus got a bite out of me and that it affected my spell casting.”
“We are close to the forest,” Lamont said. “Might be interfering since there is so much magic in there.”
As impulse control was never Harry’s strong-suit, he tugged at his glove and exposed his hand to the sharp chill of the night. It stung momentarily, but he ignored it. He reached it up and let it hover an inch away from Malfoy’s face.
Potter held up a hand. “Let me finish before you get your knickers in a twist.”
“Malfoy, you didn’t. I am interested in you.”
“Just like him,” Kharkov said, pointing at Potter, who was spinning Longbottom around the deck in a very sloppy version of a Venetian waltz which Draco found both endearing and annoying. He dropped Longbottom on the dip, but they laughed it off. Then she added, “Always savior, never person.”
“For what? If it’s so important, tell me.” His voice was cool and detached now. I hated how sad it made him sound. I hated that somehow I was responsible for that.
Potter laughed, looked around the table and said, “I don’t see anyone else, do you?” He smiled wide and Draco felt the world around them melt away as if they cast a muffliato charm.
The Dark Lord smiled cooly at Lucius. His eyes red slits. Then he extended his hand and waited.
Instead of responding with
“Well, I want
“I’m just saying that this place is full of some of histories most powerful and significant wizards. The location could be important somehow. Maybe the caretaker’s death was…collateral damage.”
“Before?” Neville asked.
Harry answered with a shrug, not trusting his voice.
“No, that’s not what I…of course,” Harry sat up so he could look Draco in the eyes, “That isn’t what I—what I mean is…I like this.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and huffed out a breath. His frame slumped a little, but Malfoy quickly caught himself and straightened up to his full height which was at least a few inches more than Harry. “Fine. So where is it?”
With a shuddering breath, Draco moved off Harry’s lap and resumed his spot leaning against the tree. “Tomorrow then.”
“What?” Harry asked in a whisper. There were plenty of people that could see Malfoy with his wand. It was bad enough that they were still in their robes; they didn’t need to stand out anymore.
I rubbed my eyes with the back of my hand, pushing my glasses up. The whole thing seemed tedious to me with the magical surges and maybe if I was talking to anyone else, I would have said so, but Hermione wouldn’t let me off that easy. “I’ll catch a nap before the party. What time should I come through? I assume we will head over together.”
Malfoy laughed to himself. “I understand you, you know? Being so prideful, so sure that you can outsmart anyone. That you’re always the most clever person in the room, one step ahead. I’ve been that way my whole life. I’ll bet you didn’t even hesitate when the Demon told you the price was your soul because you just knew you would slip out of it the way you did with everything else. But, I’ll let you in on a little secret, that luck eventually runs out. It all catches up with you until you’re trapped in a corner with no options. It’s what happened to me, and it will happen to you, too.”
“Still boring as
“You say you cast all the spells, Weasley?” Robards asked when Ron finished recounting what happened.
“Why engage in something without any meaning?”
“Shut it,” I told my reflection and rubbed the rest of the grogginess from my eyes and headed back to the task of seeing who in the fuck could need to speak to me so badly that they came through at four in the morning.
Heart pounding, Harry averted his gaze. He needed a drink, right now, so he grabbed Charlie's hand and dragged him through the living room and into the kitchen where McGrady always stored the drinks.
With him were Lamont and Reed. Both of them mirroring Robards annoyance. They flanked him like good little minions. Their wands were raised.
“You’re
The sun had set long ago, but the air still held the warmth of a summer day. Draco hardly looked like he’d broken a sweat, but that wasn’t a surprise. A year’s worth of friendship had given Harry a peek behind the curtains in regards to the neat and tidy man sitting next to him. He often cast charms to freshen himself up. Harry joked that Draco was vain. Draco joked that Harry was frumpy.

I laughed. It was hard to think of myself as someone worth fainting over, but that had been the trend ever since the Battle and Rita Skeeter’s profiles on the
“You said if I got three in a row right you’d take off a piece of clothing. Time to pay up,” Harry demanded.
“I don’t feel anything,” I said once the last of the potion was gone from the vial. I held up the empty container to the light to make sure none was left. “How fast is it supposed to—” I stopped mid-sentence because floating around the vial were specs of light like golden dust. It swirled around the vial and I watched it float down and wrap around my wrist and slink all the way up to my neck and then my face. I was seeing the magic of the potion working in real time. It was wrapped around me like golden ivory.
Anger settled in Draco’s chest. Anger with his father for being so empty, for not even seeming to grieve the loss of his wife other than what was necessary for appearances, for treating his son with as much regard as he treated the help. He felt anger at his mother for dying. At the Dark Lord for killing her. He felt the heaviness of anger toward himself for letting his mother die—for letting himself be used in exactly the way his mother had died trying to prevent.
“No, Father.”
“Potter, you can't be serious?”
They ran the short distance to the fire and leapt at the same time over the flames. Harry felt heat at his ankles but other than that, all he focused on was the laugh coming from Draco as they bounded over the fire to land on the other side.
“As you all may be aware, we have a problem in London. There have been a string of murders all perpetrated by one creature that, according to history, was once a witch who used Life and Death magic to prolong their life; a Succubus. We had hoped they were all extinct or apprehended, but it seems at least one remains active and has been busy.”
I’d forgotten about the magical trace. I spun around trying to find the black smoke again. I saw it in the distance on the other side of the clearing. It was barely visible. Either the potion was fading or the trace was nearly gone. “It’s disappearing.”
“I’ve been tossing it around since I sat down with you,” he said, chewing on his bottom lip in a quiet moment of thought, then added, “Actually, if I’m being
“They all act like I got caught fucking Voldemort's corpse or something.”
Draco only smiled.
“Surely, that has nothing to do with the fact that you have hidden away in this corner of the ballroom, nor that you seem unaffected by the music,” Mr. Potter said and then nudged Draco’s elbow playfully. The contact burned through him.
Licking his lips, Draco leaned forward and whispered, “With my date? Of course.”
I sat up all the way now and set the decanter down on the end table. She had my full attention. “What about them?”
“I heard this was supposed to be a party,” I teased. “Why are you back here trimming hedges?”
Instinctively, Harry’s eyes found Malfoy’s. Against the dark backdrop of the forest, Malfoy’s features were even more striking. His cheeks were rose-red and his nose, too. His pale skin shone against the night under the wash of light from his wand. Whisks of white-blonde hair slipped out from under the furred edges of his bomber hat. They hung in his eyes which were almost black, the pupils were so wide.
In true Ministry fashion, they pretended like they hadn’t royally cocked up, and moved on. Draco read the whole file two nights ago and was surprised at how much information was magically redacted from it like all the names of the deceased, for one. Potter had simply shrugged and threw the file haphazardly on Draco’s desk, not caring that all the papers flew out, meaning Draco would have to reorganise them.
Mostly, Draco saw the Harry that Harry, himself, wasn’t very sure he liked. It was the Harry who sort of hated Ron and Hermione for being so well adjusted after the war. It was the Harry who kept his nightmares secret because it seemed no one wanted to discuss Voldemort anymore—like he had been an inconvenience and not a madman. It was the Harry who wanted to yell and scream whenever someone congratulated him for saving the wizarding world as if he won a Quidditch match and hadn’t resorted to murder to keep people safe.
A soft, honeyed laugh came from the raven-haired woman, the thing he’d been tracking, as she tore herself away from her prey. She turned to face Harry, a twisted smile spreading across her face, momentarily stunning him. It seemed impossible that a woman that beautiful could smile in such a malicious way, all teeth and darkness.
There was a moment of pure shock on Draco’s face before he schooled his expression and cleared his throat. “A week from Monday. I know it’s short notice.”
, which was still more than Draco had expected or dared to hope for. There certainly were some possibilities that Draco would not have considered until he saw Potter’s eyes as he watched Draco fucking Nikola’s mouth. Nothing had ever made him feel so in control. Not even his wealth and status and those had always been the things he relied on to empower him. Those were things he could understand, but this was new. It was intriguing.
Embarrassment like a white hot poker ran through Draco. He straightened in his chair and willed himself not to look away. If he broke eye contact with Potter, he would surely begin to tear up, and that was the last thing he needed. Instead, Draco fell back on old habits. “As opposed to your unending spontaneity. Look where that got you last night. You could have called me to go with you to scout the clubs. I told you to call me if you decided to go out, in fact. But you thought ‘I’m Harry Potter, I’m sure I can handle one demon-witch all by my onesies. Piece of cake.’”
Draco rolled his eyes, but complied, tugging his shirt over his head, revealing the pale, taut muscles of his chest and torso, and tossed the shirt at Harry’s face. “You’re a menace.”
, Harry thought. He needed to refocus and remember that Malfoy wanted him. That Malfoy fancies him, so all he has to do is get Malfoy to kiss him which shouldn't be too hard since he knows the git wants to do it.
“So we can work together then?” Skeeter asked.
Firmly, Harry said, “No.”
I didn’t answer.
Harry sighed, pulling back from Ginny enough that he could look her in the eye. “Nothing, just catching up.” The lie came out before he could even think about why he was lying. It was just a character letter, so why lie?
“It does taste better when they can admit it,” she seemed to be talking to herself now. “However, I cannot afford to be a picky eater right now.” She looked over her shoulder at the woman who she’d been feeding on, then her gaze settled back on Harry, and with it another rush of her magic.
Charlie pointed to the back of the garden. “He got here a few minutes before you guys and immediately said he wanted to check on some plants they rooted last week.”
“It never gets easier,” he said. “Seeing a dead body. It never gets easier.” He took one more look at his hands and then brushed them off on the front of his trousers.
“Well, they do.” I shrugged.
Hermione and I were about to follow when a familiar posh voice came from behind us. “Potter, Hermione, nice to see you.”
Neville eyed Harry suspiciously, but answered anyways, “He’s all right. No experience except taking Herbology at Illvormorny, but he’s picking up on it.”
“Ginny,” Luna answered in a doleful tone. Her normally dreamy face fell into a sort of frown and she doodled a little heart in the top corner of the parchment.
“I know that,” she said, waving him off, then turned to Harry. “Hi, Harry. Sorry I didn’t mean to ignore you.”
, put it down and then pick it up again, letting it
“Side effects like?” Potter asked.
I stayed there a moment longer, letting the sun warm me before I headed to the sitting room to answer the call. Part of me wanted to ignore it. Nothing good comes from a fire call at 6:30 in the morning. The face in the fireplace smiled up at me, but it didn’t register who it was at first. “Hello?”
Sweat rolled down my neck. I felt my shirt sticking to my chest, but no pain, no flashes. Nothing. I felt guilt wash over me. I hadn’t wanted to see the dead man with black ooze flowing from his mouth like some macabre fountain statue. Maybe my own apprehension was keeping me from accessing whatever visions were there. With Voldemort, the visions mostly came when I was dreaming and always when Voldemort wanted me to see something. He controlled them once he knew about the connection in our minds. This was different somehow, but I didn’t know exactly how I knew that. I controlled the visions this time. I pushed my hand into the dirt covering my hand up to my wrist and focused harder. I cleared my mind of all the doubt and shut out Hermione and Ron’s inane conversation about who should go get Malfoy.
Potter clenched his jaw and his fists. “Can we just drop this, Malfoy? I’m not in the mood.”
Harry, rash as always, had enough of this dance they were doing and shouted, “I tell you that you’re beautiful and all you can say to me is that I’m ridiculous?”
Potter seemed to consider his options and then his face set into a pout before he shifted and knelt in front of Draco. For whatever reason, it seemed Potter was going along with this little show of power. Again, Draco found himself worried that things would get out of hand, revealing his ridiculous attraction not only to Potter, but to a stranger who could use the information as leverage if he so pleased.
One of the many reasons I hate portkeys is the feeling. It’s like your insides are being yanked by an invisible hook. Like your physical body hasn’t moved, but your soul or whatever has been dragged all over and then slammed back into your body with the force of a bludger.
“Evening, Ms. Parkinson,” Ms. Granger said, nodding her head at Pansy and then turning to Draco, “Mr. Malfoy. Enjoying the event are we?”
trying to sabotage you. Mother will be so pleased when I tell her I’m meant to be with Harry Potter and not some rich, demure witch from a foreign country.”
“Hmm,” Potter mumbled.
In those fantasies, Mr. Potter would sincerely apologize for his lack of response and credit this misstep to the misfortune of a man who travels often, therefore, losing often their correspondences. This would then be returned with Draco’s understanding and admittance that he simply thought there was an issue with the letters and in no way considered Mr. Potter the type of person to ignore an amiable invitation to someone’s home.
“I caught the end of it.” Draco turned and smiled at Harry. His face was still beautifully illuminated by the flames surrounding them.
“And who says that’s what I’m doing?” Potter asked, some of his earlier anger replaced with something else, something sadder. “Maybe they were all just incompetent, or maybe I just work better alone.”
I tilted the vial back and swallowed. The potion tasted like mulled wine, so it could have been worse. It could have tasted like cherry cough syrup like so many other potions that come out tasting like the worst medicine you’ve ever tasted. So many amazing things about being a wizard, but potion’s almost always tasted bad.
“I wish you would talk about it, Harry. If not to us, to someone. You’ve spent the last five years holding it in,” Hermione said. “It might have been fine at first to block it out, but that’s not sustainable. Ron and I both go to mind healers.”
“I was, too, but that’s because I didn’t think you liked me the way I liked you. You were older, more experienced, not to mention I had just broken up with your sister.”
?” Harry asked, trying to understand. The ‘punch’ he'd consumed must've misinterpreted Draco’s intention with ‘doing it,’ because the images it provided were...Harry swallowed as he realised the idea wasn't nearly as off-putting as it probably should have been. This meant two things...First, Harry was definitely bisexual—no more floundering around on that—second, he was attracted to Draco Malfoy and owed Ron a Galleon.
A laugh bubbled up out of Ron. A loud barking sort of laugh, the kind you can’t control, that made all the heads in their vicinity snap to attention. “Sorry,” he said to the group, and then more quietly to Harry he said, “Sorry, mate. That bad?”
Ron winced. “Oh, Merlin, right. I think I blocked that out. So much memorising. Shite, she can be a menace sometimes, eh?”
“I still don’t see the whole issue. So you’re different. I’m betting she is, too. We all are after what happened. I mean, look at me. I’m sitting under a tree, in the dead of winter, listening to you talk about your relationship issues. Can you picture the old me doing this and actually caring what you say?”
I stared at them. “Not really.”
For a while, they all exchanged stories. Nikola spent some time relaying the Russian Minister’s ascension to power, which much like the Dark Lord’s, involved overthrowing the previous government officials. According to Nikola, the Russian Minister thought the previous government was getting too lax in their laws about whether or not Muggles were allowed to know about magic.
“Potter, don’t,” Draco said, cutting Potter off again. He couldn’t believe himself. Here Potter was about to say he was attracted to Draco because the potion affected him so much, but Draco knew that couldn’t really be the reason. It had to be that Potter wasn’t in touch with his feelings. The other reason the potion could be strong was blocking or denying yourself of an attraction. It had to be that.
“Yes, I am the weird one... at party, but not
Instead of venom, Draco only saw exhaustion which was disappointing. Had he finally made a crack in Potter’s resolve? Was there actually a breaking point for Perfect Potter?
with black eyes out of my mind.
whisky.”
Draco felt sure that if he tried to move even one inch his legs would give out under him. He schooled his expression, leaning on old habits, and smirked at Potter. “Thought you’d be thrilled to be rid of me, Potter. No more protocol, no more having to hear me whine about plans and paperwork. You’re free to dash about like a Herculean hero. Run into a burning building, save a kitten and all that.”
“I like tea better, and smoking is gross,” Draco answered, stupidly. What was Potter doing here? And why was he acting so casual?
Hand lightly gripping Harry’s cock, Draco captured him in a eager kiss. Then he slid his lips lightly down his neck, to the dip of his collarbone where he nibbled at the top button on Harry’s dress shirt to unbutton it. Then continued until all the buttons were undone.
His voice when it came now was low and touchably sensual. “Potter, this is becoming a daily annoyance, I mean, occurrence. What busines brings you here today?”
Robards was an unassuming man. Quiet, until he needed to talk. Efficient in every sense of the word. Not much in the way of looks or muscle, but Harry knew the man was tough. In fact, he often told Ron that he thought Robards liked to look unassuming because it gave him an advantage. If people didn’t think much of him, he always had the upper hand.
“I simply have a low tolerance for frivolity,” Draco choked out. He knew he did not sound convincing, but he was attempting indifference as it was the securest avenue. He stepped backward hoping the physical space would lessen the effect Mr. Potter’s stare was having on his body.
But out here, in the dark, alone with Draco, Harry couldn’t find a damn thing to distract him, except for maybe the snitch. But he hadn’t seen it yet, and frankly, he found himself not caring. Then like an answer to a prayer, Harry heard the snitch buzz past his ear and he took off after it.
“Harry—”
“Er, I’m not sure. Exams are coming up…”
“Malfoy,” Harry started to say, but Malfoy cut him off.
“Er, w—well,” Draco muttered. He shook his head and broke eye contact with Potter, refocusing on his task of unfastening his buttons. Halfway down, Potter placed his hand over Draco’s to stop him from unfastening.
That line of thinking was sure to only bring Draco suffering. It was unlikely that Mr. Potter would overlook Draco’s family ties. The embarrassment of his father’s arrest. The rumors surrounding his mother's mental stability. The loss of their income. And surely the stain of his own crimes were plastered upon him in everyone’s mind. Not to mention, Mr. Potter already carried a dislike for him from school.
“I think we have Potions together,” Draco answered. He eyed Luna seriously, then turned his attention back on Ryder.
At first, Harry only felt the sensation of his lips touching something. Not exactly the magic he expected kissing in the snow would be. After all, his body was basically frozen after being in the snow for so long.
Shaking his head in exasperation, “How will I ever keep a secret from either of you when you both know everything about me without even trying?”
But under her gaze, all that melted away, and Harry felt
Looking around the Great Hall, which was adorned with all manner of Christmas decorations, Malfoy’s jaw clenched. The tension was so visible, Harry momentarily found himself worrying for the state of Malfoy’s teeth. He could hear Hermione’s voice telling him about her parents patients who would grind their teeth. The stories always ended with people having to get dentures. Harry tried to picture Malfoy with dentures and almost laughed.
“Still a box to be trapped in, no?”
Pulling Harry out of his thoughts, Ron’s voice was careful when he asked, “So, how did this happen?” And then he extended his arm out, waggling the empty glass in Harry’s face.
“Did you talk to her?” Ron asked.
I don’t know why but I knew I had to reach the man and soon. He was running out of time. I looked at the ground and with a deep breath, I stepped outside of my patch of green. My foot hit the ground and I watched green spiderweb out from under my foot, reviving the ground. I took another step and the same thing happened.
Luna was also out of the question. She wore a tightly fitted velvet dress that barely covered her arse. And that also counted Girl Weasley out because her dress, while loose fitting, was shorter that Luna’s.
The taste of whisky on Draco’s lips, the smell of him, the feeling of his tongue brushing against Harry’s lips—all of it sent a rush of pleasure through him. It warmed him more thoroughly than any warming charm could. He lost himself in Draco’s lips, in the sound of their ragged breaths as Draco moved to straddle him. Nothing mattered but Draco’s mouth on his. Harry let him take control and relaxed into the kiss, resting his hands on Draco’s hips. He felt himself shaking, but it felt better than anything he’d felt in a long time.
Draco laughed, snatched the bottle out of Harry’s hand, and said, “Merlin, you do not want to know.” He took a sip and then leaned back against the tree trunk. He handed the bottle back to Harry. “Okay, fine, fine. You pressured me into it, Potter. Sheesh. Relentless.”
Neville nodded. “Well, do you think you’re ready to join us? Luna and I are going to announce who our best people are going to be, and you don’t want to miss it.” He winked at Harry playfully. It was honestly very cute that Neville didn’t know that Harry knew he was going to ask him to be his best man. He’d told Ron, for Merlin’s sake, and everyone knows Ron can’t keep gossip like that to himself. Harry had known for a week now that Neville planned to ask him since Harry played a part in getting him and Luna together eighth year.
“I swear if everyone stopped kissing his arse for two minutes they’d see the bloke isn’t so special. So what, he killed you-know-who. That was five years ago and other people helped him. Not like he did it on his own.”
Harry was too shocked to care that Malfoy sounded sad, not angry. His whole body kept reacting to simple touches. He couldn’t imagine what kissing someone on this potion would feel like if a touch made him feel like this.
He hoped Draco would get his meaning. That Draco wasn’t going to make him say it all. Make him put into words all the feelings that were buzzing around inside his head. Because even though they never said anything, Harry was sure that there was something.
“And how do you know he doesn’t feel the same?”
,” Luna paused and then looked over at Potter again. The man was egging Weasley on to chug a Butterbeer. Granger looked positively revolted, but Girl Weasley seemed very amused. Her freckled face was alight with laughter and her red hair swung behind her elegantly.
I turned to Malfoy. His face was impassive. “Did you know?”
“The what?” Mr. Potter’s voice was quiet. The question seemed so odd to Draco. Surely Mr. Potter knew to which letters he was referring.
“You got lucky,” Harry snapped back, even though he knew it was a lie. Harry had not counted on Draco’s flying skills, nor his speed.
“In there!” someone else shouted, then Robards was stepping through the doorway.
“Yes, Potter. I am in,” Malfoy said, his face flushed from the heat of the common room fireplace and the firewhiskey, “That’s what all this bloody handshaking business is about, isn’t it?”
“We just established that isn’t a problem for me.” I smirked, hoping I looked as cocky as I sounded.
There was a moment of silence and then Draco sighed. “No, I guess not, but it’s not like I have a hoard of cats following me. I’m not a spinster. I’m just focused on school and not pissing the board off. They are just itching to find some loophole that will send me away. Dating just isn’t on the top of my list...”
Harry dropped to his knees, letting his broom go, and then fell forward on his stomach, panting into the damp grass, taking in the smell of earth. Laying there, he felt more like a person than he had in months, maybe longer.
In the backyard, Harry felt the cold air on his face. The winter air was sharp, but it was a welcomed pain as it helped bring Harry back to reality. The party was loud behind him, but he kept his eyes on the night sky.
“How do you know that, though?” Potter asked, his voice a whisper.
Harry shrugged and then leaned back against the wall, so he could attempt looking casual as he scanned the room for Draco, who was now no where to be seen. This made Harry more uncomfortable than he cared to admit. For one thing, what was Draco doing? And how could Harry make him jealous if he wasn’t here to watch?
Malfoy didn’t question him, though Harry felt him tense behind him. “
“Po—Potter, I…” Malfoy said. Harry watch him struggle to swallow. His adam’s apple bobbed under the tight skin of his neck.
“Merlin, yes,” Harry reflected. Each Quidditch practice had refueled his attraction like his body was a sponge soaking up every part of their interactions. He felt alive with it, but there was the one minor problem, “Or at least I thought it was until I found out he was dating some bloke named, Quinten Fairchild who works with Neville at the greenhouse.”
It did not, however, mean he must enjoy himself nor participate in more ways than nodding at guests, occasionally taking a partner in dance, and indulging in champagne. It also did not mean speaking to Mr. Potter or his companion no matter how his insides shouted in merriment at the thought of Mr. Potter approaching him.
Ron stood up and there was dirt on his knees and blood on his hands. He looked at them curiously like he couldn’t remember why there was blood there.
“This is shite?” Draco asked. His eyebrows knitted together and he chewed on his bottom lip.
They had fallen into an uncomfortable silence. Draco sipped at his champagne simply to occupy his mouth before he let another veiled insult slip from between his traitorous lips. Mr. Potter, Draco noticed, watched as Pansy guided Ms. Granger on the dance floor. He smiled as he did.
That I believed. Hermione got tunnel vision like me. When she was focused on a task, that was the only thing that existed. “Okay, so look presentable. I can manage that.”
“Collectin’ some o’ the ingredients yeh two disappeared, aren’ we?” Hagrid said. He laughed and then shoved a few jars each into Harry and Malfoy’s hands.
, Harry thought. Anytime Draco was brought up, he and Ginny fought. She would always say the same things, and Harry would always defend Draco. They’d been having the same conversation since the day they got back together a year ago.
“Shite,” Ron snapped. “Why won’t this bloody spell work?” He kicked at the earth a few times and then placed his hands on his hips. He looked down at the victim again and shook his head.
Malfoy bit his lip to keep from smirking. “Well, are we going to get to it soon, Potter? I do have other business to attend to. Despite what you think, the world does not stop for you.”
“Why didn’t you get back with her?” Draco asked. He shifted his head, so he could look at Harry. “If you don’t mind me asking.”
,” Harry shouted without warning. His magic pulsed in him, pushing out through the wand, but all that came out were red sparks.
Harry shook off the image of his lips on Malfoy’s with greater effort than he would ever admit to anyone. “Right, let’s go.”
Draco fought the urge to tap his foot in impatience. Instead, he let himself steal a look at his father who stood regally at his side. His white-blond hair was slicked back and fell in cascades down the length of his back. His robes were black silk and embroidered with small golden leaves. His cane was made of redwood and bore an intricate design of snakes slithering and twining themselves around one another.
“Harry, I don't like that face you’ve got on right now.”
Draco licked his bottom lip as he took a breath. “Okay, well, say I kiss you and we both feel nothing? It would’ve been ridiculous that we even tried. It would probably make things awkward between us, and I’ve grown used to having you around. I don’t want that to change.”
“He reminded you of yourself,” she said knowingly. “But do you think you were saving him or saving yourself?”
“Di—did you just compliment me?” Draco was sure he wore an equally shocked expression, though all he could focus on was how Potter’s eyes raked up and down Draco’s body like they were seeing him for the first time.
“Don’t worry about that. I bought an extra one and you can put your name on it.”
young
Draco was half-turned away when Harry’s hand, much to Harry’s own surprise, was around Draco’s wrist, pulling Draco back to face him. “Of course, I’ll write the letter. When is it due?”
“Daisy is not knowing, Master Draco.”
He didn’t get a chance to respond before Draco was shaking his head and saying, “It’s totally fine, no need to say anything. It was a long shot. Thank you for hearing me out,  Harry. It was great seeing you.”
The Succubus let out an aching howl, tilting her head back as she screeched.
People followed me, and I could hear them whispering about how I was shorter than they expected or that I didn’t look tough enough to beat Voldemort. They felt like they had a right to me. A right to discuss everything about me. A right to my body. To my mind. To my life. I can still feel his eyes in my own, watching me in the mirror when I brushed my teeth, combed my hair, shaved. He was in there, watching me. Always.
Fuck, Harry thought and then his face got hot and he couldn’t make himself turn to face Ron, who Harry was sure was just as embarrassed. A few responses flew thorough his mind, most of them just variants of ‘no’ and all of them useless because the damage was done and everyone would be talking about this soon enough.
Harry shoved Draco with his shoulder. “Well, why aren’t you there now?”
“For fun, surely.”
“That’s selfish.”
She blushed. “Thanks, Harry. I’m here with Dean. We’ve gone on a few dates now. It’s good for me.”
“Apologies, Father.”
Malfoy must have felt something, too, because he tore his arm out of Harry’s grip and said, “Let’s get this over with.”
“Okay, hold on,” Draco said, pulling back a bit.
From behind them, Harry could hear the collective “oooo’s” from their friends who had gathered round the pair of them in a circle when Malfoy had bet him that Harry couldn’t seduce a broom handle without help from Hermione and Ron. And that he, Malfoy, could seduce anyone, anywhere, anytime.
Hermione considered and then took a sip of her tea. “Yes, I think they might, or they might have before…” She trailed off and her yes slid over to me. We both knew she blamed me for shifting the focus off of her edicts by taking the law into my own hands. I had been one of the head people backing her edicts, but with my reputation at the Ministry a bit…tarnished, she was having trouble moving forward.
Ginny put her hand under my chin and brought my head up. “Get help, Harry. Please. If not for all the people who need you to be better, then for yourself, for that young Harry who always dreamed of something better.”
Potter nodded, then tilted his head to the side to take more of the portrait in. “It’s a good likeness.”
that he skipped his farewells to Nikola and the Dark Lord, knowing his father would be livid. He could not be bothered to care about Lucius having yet another fit over Draco’s utter impropriety and what a disappointment of a son he had grown into.
There was a soft moan that drifted towards Harry during a pause in the pounding music inside. It was too quiet to tell if it was from pleasure or pain.
Ron ignored my insults and said, “It would help your case if you could even pretend for a second that you were sorry for what you did. Mostly everyone in the Ministry thinks what you did was heroic, in a way, if not a bit reckless. If you made a statement, we would work something else out. Maybe they wouldn’t even need a hearing.”
I stared at her, and for the first time in a long time, I let myself cry and be held by someone. I felt everything I’d been pushing away rush though me like a flood. It felt terrible, but there was a moment of clarity. No more oblivion. Not if I was going to stop the corruption. I couldn’t muddle my way though this one half-drunk and throwing punches. I needed a clear head for this case.
Ginny’s lips pursed, and her eyes narrowed. “I don’t like him. I don’t like you being near him, not after that night when I found you guys on the couch. I don’t trust him.”
“Yes, it helps me think,” Hermione answered as she stood up revealing herself, “What are you doing here at lunchtime?”
I hope everyone enjoyed this story!! Lots of it came out of my own stupid ass experiences being a dumb ass (like Harry). Comments and kudos are sooooo greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. :D
“It’s cute how much you care about your little muggle bitch.” Draco added in the bitch because he was sure it would enrage Potter to bursting at that’s where Draco wanted him. Angry. Volatile. Electric.
“Right,” Ron said. He looked like I had told him Santa wasn’t real. I hated when he looked like that. His face all downturned and his long red fringe covering his face as he moped.
Harry shuffled the deck of Exploding Snap cards that he knew Neville kept in his office desk drawer while he waited for him to come back. The greenhouse where Neville worked was a little out of the way, but Harry decided to drop in and visit his old schoolmate before Quidditch practice that night, and possibly to spy on this man that was dating the man that he, Harry, loved.
After all, their conversation had gone well until Draco ejected himself unceremoniously. In fact, Draco had even let himself slip into the fantasy that he so often entertained himself with in front of the fire after dinner to quell the quiet evenings.
Draco dressed in his favorite robes because they reminded him of his mother and how she had nearly hexed the tailors balls off for poking Draco with a needle during the fitting. She had always been formidable but in a secret way. Everyone underestimated her strength simply because she was demure, but then when she unleashed her wrath, there were few who could best her. He thought wearing them might channel her strength as he was going to need it to face the day.
Surprisingly, Malfoy seemed equally afflicted. It was only through the sharpened rise and fall of his chest that Harry was even sure Malfoy hadn’t somehow turned into a statue.
For a moment, nothing happened and Harry regretted his boldness. Embarrassed, he started to loosen his grip around Draco, but then he felt the soft brush of lips on his.
Harry turned to face his partner and felt his breath hitch when he realised how close their faces were. With the shielding of the potion at full effect now, Harry could no longer deny that he was attracted to Malfoy. “Uh...we, well, we trap her in the Lock Box, obviously.”
“Are you okay?”
, dipped it in ink, and began to trace the dots until Draco saw the pattern emerge. When connected, the locations where the bodies were found made lines that criss-crossed over one spot.
Harry and Ginny have a hard conversation, but ultimately it helps.
It was amazing to him that Malfoy could encapsulate so many different emotions in one look. It was a demure mixture of curiosity, caution, and contempt. Harry suspected that Malfoy was curious about the Invisibility Cloak, though he could hardly blame him. It was even a mystery to Harry, still. So many unanswered questions. But how Malfoy could look at him with contempt, as if Harry were the one forcing them to steal from Snape...well, Harry was sure he didn't know.
It was evident in their body language which was still intense, but for different reasons. They still bumped and pushed one another when chasing the snitch, but for Harry, those shoves were less about throwing Draco off his game and more about the rush of warmth Harry felt with they touched, skin on skin.
Granger glared at him. Her cheek glistened with blood. “See. I was right.”
Draco fought against every instinct that told him this was a bad idea and opened the door to Potter’s room with Nikola close behind. He found Potter sleeping. Curled up in a corner like an abandoned dog. Immediately, Draco moved to kick him awake, but stoped himself. Potter might be less agitating if he was not provoked.
“Sorry, can’t. I promise, no
He still had his wand out and ready. He pointed at me. “You said you wanted to find out what magic killed the caretaker, who by all accounts isn’t actually dead according to the Ministry and I definitely don’t remember any screams from the party. I decided to indulge you because you are stubborn and would have likely stolen the potion if I refused to help you, but now you’re telling me you’re having visions?”
Harry didn’t see it happen, but suddenly the Succubus gripped his throat. It was like time skipped. One moment, she was smiling at him from a foot away, the next, her hand was tight around his throat, and she was pulling his Life Energy from him. He could feel it as she drained him, only this time there was no bliss, no pleasure—all he felt was pain, searing and tearing at his insides. His grip on his wand weakened and he felt it slip out of his hand and hit the ground.
“Whatever, Harry.” Ginny huffed once more and then stalked off in the direction of the crowd. She grabbed Dean’s arm, yanking him forward. He followed her without any hesitation.
,” he shouted, following Harry’s lead. This time flames erupted from the tip of the wand, hitting the Succubus in the face. She howled in rage, leaning down closer to the man she sat astride. The flames got dangerously close to burning the man underneath her.
Harry smirked and walked over to Draco. He placed his hands on the wall on either side of Draco, licked his lips and moved so he was almost kissing Draco. “I think we…were…right…about…here,” Harry said and in between each word he kissed Draco anywhere but the lips. His neck. His cheek. His nose. Finally, landing a soft kiss on Draco’s lips.
“Indeed, and tomorrow when you wake up, you will either remember this and regret it, or not remember it, and I will regret it. So, if you would?”
“Thanks for the invite, Harry,” Charlie Weasley breathed into Harry’s ear. They were standing very close together on the stoop of McGrady’s home. The cold air seemed to act as a lasso, forcing them close together. Snow had begun to fall and it was clinging to Charlie's red hair, which he had grown out to his shoulders recently.
Malfoy looked up at me. His wand was pointed at his shoes, ready. He sighed heavily. “Merlin and Morgana.” He put his wand in it’s holster and motioned for me to move.
“Potter, seriously, what are you doing?” Malfoy asked. He leaned in closer as if to examine Harry’s eyes. He tilted his head to the side like a curious puppy. “You still in there, Potter?”
He kept his eyes forward on the stone structures at the back of the cemetery and decided to try and place the architecture to keep his mind off of Potter and the way this blasted potion was making up all of his carefully curated control. There were some that looked like Egyptian revival tombs, and others that called back to Rome and the columns of their great structures. Others were properly gothic and looked like they would have inspired the likes of Mary Shelly and Edgar Allen Poe. The grounds were meticulously cared for—verdant green grass spread out around him, and large trunked trees gave shade to the perimeter of the grounds. The ivy and moss growing on older stones all seemed intentional as opposed to overgrown.
“What?” Draco couldn’t hide the shock in his voice.
“You’re such a romantic.”
“Yes.”
“No thanks. Don’t want to risk you losing it, or stealing it,” Harry snapped, suddenly very annoyed that he let himself get roped into stealing from Snape. As if Snape needed another reason to give Harry a hard time. He was already suspicious of his improvements in the class, minute as they were.
“One moment,” she said and whispered something into the kettle that was sitting near the fire. It was cast iron. She levitated it to hover over the fire. “Tea is on. Come, come.”
“Harry?” Draco whispered, his voice groggy from sleep. “Where have you been?”
Hermione caught up and gripped my arm. “Harry?”
More silence passed after Hagrid gave up trying to pry from Harry exactly what spell they used to make the entire store closet disappear. Harry, himself, wasn’t entirely sure why a simple Scourgify managed to make it all disappear. Probably a mixture of bad luck and spilled potion. Malfoy, Harry remembered, knocked into the shelf where Snape kept some of the more rare ingredients, so it was likely one or more of them mixed together in the fall creating the right conditions for a Scourgify to erase things from existence.
“When you were dared to hold the Reveal-it-all…”
A loud crack of thunder made Harry jump, and then the lit candles flickered, flames reaching for the sky in tall orange columns. The one in the middle that was unlit stayed that way, making Harry curious. The flicker of the flames cast shadows all about the room, making him feel like he was at a campfire about to roast marshmallows. All of a sudden his mind was flooded with images of Malfoy: his white-blond hair mussed up after a practice duel, the hard line of his cheekbones, the mysterious grey of his eyes that seemed to grow stormy when he was concentrated, the curve of his Cupid’s bow lips when he smirked.
I stared at her, frustration building in my gut. “I know he did. He had to. I didn’t chose to see those things. He was inside me, always. He watched me though my own fucking eyes. I had a part of his soul attached to mine and it was like a black rot. He had control over the visions, alright. He toyed with me. Like the time he made me watch his snake devour a man whole, or when he tricked me into thinking Sirius was in trouble so I raced to help, only to insure his death, or when he showed me Arthur almost dying. Voldemort put those visions in my mind. He as good as raped my mind.”
Neville and George came over to us before I could figure out what I wanted to do with Malfoy. Neville looked from Malfoy to me and then said, “Lovely party.”
“I—I love...I love you.”
“My room, Father. I wasn’t feeling well, so I retired early,” Draco lied easily.
“Then—then prove it.”
Robards brushed the front of his robes flat, and took a breath. “As Auror Potter said, there were no fang marks on the bodies, so that leads us away from Vampires.”
Draco sighed. “Luna, you really don’t have to introduce me to every new friend you make.”
Relief washed over Draco in that moment. He felt it flood his entire body. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He smiled and then answered in his best haught tone, “In polite society, it is unacceptable to respond after more than a fortnight; however, I could be inclined to revisit my invitation.”
Everyone laughed at this. Draco wondered at how easy it was for Potter to be out. Of course, it was headline news for months after the war, but Potter never seemed phased by it. Draco, on the other hand, well, his parents threatened death if Draco so much as looked at anyone before marriage. So he never really let himself consider romantic feelings until after the war, after his family disowned him for his
So on the fly, Draco decided to switch tactics. “I get it, you know, but what happened to Thomas wasn’t your fault. He saved your life, Potter, which is what partners do. You would have done exactly the same thing for him, and don’t even pretend you wouldn’t.” Draco said the words hoping it wasn’t a stupid idea to bring Dean Thomas’s death into it, but everyone knew that’s why Potter had been so difficult to work with, even if Potter himself didn’t see it.
“Luna,” Draco said, nodding at her. “Why do I get the feeling you’re up to something?”
He did. Merlin, he did, but he knew it wasn’t real. It was her magic. “No.”
She nodded. There was a hint of anxiety there that I wouldn’t have usually noticed. I assumed Hermione was never affected by this stuff. She sure as hell never let on that she was—or at least, I never noticed if she had. I could probably thank the alcohol for that one.
Harry barked out a tired laugh. He was exhausted from Auror training and Quidditch practice. He wanted the best of both worlds once the war ended, so he immediately decided to make a career of hunting down dark wizards with Ron instead of going back to Hogwarts like Hermione, and then he decided to make a hobby of Quidditch. Harry was not letting anything stop him from doing the things he loved. Things that made him feel like himself.
“Tell me the whole story,” Luna said calmly, “Take your time.” That was easy for Luna to say, but Harry felt like he was running out of time. Just yesterday the Prophet posted that article speculating about Ginny and Harry and if they had worked through their differences and decided to give it another try.
Every inch of Draco wanted to melt right there on the expensive carpet Mother had brought home on a trip to Iran. Somehow he managed to stay standing.
Draco considered lying. He considered ignoring the question. He considered high-tailing it out of that bathroom and going back to his room and pretending all of this didn't happen.
“Potter, you lout, you know luck had nothing to do with it.”
“I’ve felt weird lately.”
“Whose side are you on?”
him plenty, but this wasn’t a laugh at his expense, and it made Draco’s heart flutter stupidly. Seemed like it was allergy season again.
When he opened Potter’s door which was the one to the right of Granger, he saw him tense and squared shouldered.
“Yes.” It was an honest answer. It also was an embarrassing thing to admit aloud, but Draco found he left his pride back on the balcony with Pansy. It lay scattered among the shattered glass that Mr. Potter dropped.
“Poor kid didn’t realize she wasn’t my type,” Potter said with a pout.
, he means.’ It made a jolt of anger burn through Harry. Something about Malfoy always made him insane, irrational, and about a million other things. Malfoy challenged him in ways no one else even dared to; he got under his skin faster, and deeper than anyone else he’d ever met. It was infuriating that something as simple as a scowl from Malfoy could set him off making stupid decisions.
His interest seemed to annoy Draco in the beginning and that only made Harry more curious. Once he opened his mouth, he surprised even himself with how much he wanted to know about Draco.
“Good,” Potter said.
“I don’t,” I said but Ron didn’t look convinced.
“Yes, ‘Arry, McGonagall's orders, yeh see. O’herwise, I ‘spect Snape would’ave both o’ yeh expelled fer the simple fac’ that he hadn’ the slightes’ clue teh what ye were up teh. He on’y calmed when she agreed teh a detention in the fores’. He was pushin’ fer it, now I think about it.”
“So, we are agreed then? You and I will share what we gather. I, to help you solve the case and regain some of your tattered reputation and you, to help me get yet another best-selling book.”
“Fuck, I can’t believe this is happening. Jerry’s gonna be so jealous,” the man said and followed the Succubus as she strode away into the mausoleum.
“Only if I can drink the last of the firewhiskey,” Ron said matter-of-factly and poured the remainder of the firewhiskey into his glass and tilted it towards Harry.
“Tell me why you care.” Harry stepped closer and now they were toe to toe. He felt his own breathing getting erratic and took care to slow his breaths. He watched for any sign that Draco was as distraught as him.
“We need to tell her,” I said.
Maybe it was faith in Malfoy’s potion mastery, maybe it was pure stubbornness, maybe something else all together. Maybe I didn’t really know the risks. Maybe I didn’t care to know them. Either way I found my lips wrapped around the business end of a potion vial with three sets of eyes watching me with apprehension written all over their faces.
The thought made Harry’s stomach sink. Up until recently, he had successfully avoided this line of thinking. Anytime it reared its ugly head, Harry made sure to distract himself with homework, or watching Ron and Hermione be disgustingly in love, because anything was better than thinking;
Hermione laughed. “Of course not.”
We all grabbed ahold of it and I felt the terrible tugging sensation yanking me all over until it slammed me back into reality and I was in the Ministry station again. The night administrator scowled at us while we wobbled our way to the floos.
“I mean, you were clever enough to escape capture when the Ministry was rounding up your kind for experiments, so of course you’d think yourself clever enough to outwit a literal Demon. You are the one who got loose and siphoned all those Ministry workers, aren’t you? You’re the reason they shut the project down.”
Ron just stared at me. “You beat up a Ministry official. Bloody broke his jaw. He still hasn’t woken up. That sort of thing is generally frowned upon. And you’re lucky the Ministry didn’t want that in the papers, or we could add that to the list of reckless things the world knows you’ve done.”
There was another moan, lower, more guttural. Malfoy’s eyes snapped open and met Harry’s. “
“Well, they aren’t doing feature pieces on what kind of towels she prefers to use after quidditch in the locker rooms now, are they?”
Potter, stood, walked to stand next to Draco’s seat and slammed the file open onto his desk. He gave Draco a smug look that screamed ‘see...I can be clever, too.’ Their proximity was dizzying, but Draco managed to swallow the rising tide of lust, and focus on the map.
Harry placed a hand on her knee, squeezing as he said, “That’s wonderful, Gin. I’m happy for you.”
Half joking, Harry asked in a tentative voice, “Can I whine a bit longer?”
“People will think I have done something evil to you. They will talk. The papers already keep their eye upon me as if to capture me in some dark deal at the market. No matter how much work I do, my name still holds the stain my father left.”
Draco stared at him with wide eyes. He looked like he’d just lost his footing and couldn’t believe he fell to the ground, landing on his arse. “That was, uh, good.” He cleared his throat. “Right?”
Though, he especially liked when Draco broke through that poshness and ended up doing normal things like plopping inot a sitting position. Something he never associated with Draco before—plopping. Honestly, he always imagined Draco floated down onto his seats like a ghost.
“Speak for yourself,” Granger added, still trying to keep a laugh from pouring out of her.
Harry took a reflexive step backward into Malfoy, who had his wand up. “
“How do you know that?”
They’d used the Witchcraft Act of 1541 as their guise to hunt down and capture any Succubi they could find, riding on the coat-tails of the very inquisition that hunted their own kind. All in all, it was said the Ministry captured three Succubi in the process. The study, however, was inconclusive as it was shut down and redacted from public record. From what Draco could glean from the old, grumpy archivist down in the stacks, the study was shut down when one of the Succubi broke free and siphoned the Life Energy of thirty Ministry employees.
“I said hi and that I just finished
Everything in Draco screamed to run, but he uncorked his phial and swallowed it down. It tasted like strawberries and toothpaste. An odd flavor combination, but not unpleasant. “Thanks, Pans.”
I snatched the paper from his hand and opened it up. Staring up at me was a photo of me outside of the Ministry talking to Shacklebolt. I remember that was the day he told me I was on desk duty until the hearing. I had been shouting about the boys magical surges and accused him of being like Fudge and ignoring something because it didn’t suit him. The headline said: Saviour and Minister Caught Fighting Over Recent Magical Surges: Is There Actually Something to Worry About? A few lines in, it said that a source at the Ministry told them that I was going mad, tossing papers everywhere after my fight with Shacklebolt and that I wouldn’t stop shouting that the recent uptick in illegal magical usage was the result of something insidious. The article, however, assured people that the rest of the Ministry thought I was seeing problems where they weren’t. The article asked the public if I was loosing it. How perfectly ironic.
I sighed. “Course he did.” I made my way across the room, grabbing the decanter of whiskey on my way to the couch and sprawled out across it. I didn’t drink the whiskey, but I knew I was going to need it at some point during this conversation. “Well, get after it then.”
“Gods, so eager for me, aren’t you, Potter?” Draco asked. But it wasn’t a question because the answer was obvious. Harry pushed his hard groin against Draco’s leg so he could feel just how eager he was—how hungry he was for him.
There was a rustling in the bushes down stream. My eyes snapped over to the sound. I had my wand in my hand. I whispered, “Stay here.”
I stood up, licking the cum off my lips and smiled.
,” Malfoy shouted, aiming his wand at the Succubus. His hand trembled, but he held firm. He moved out from behind Harry, dropping something in Harry’s pocket as he did. “I will light you on fire before you can siphon his energy.”
But Draco could plop like the best of them. And plopping down next to Harry, Draco crossed his legs underneath one another and dropped his broom to his side. He breathed out deeply and then seemed to consider saying something. His brow furrowed and his jaw set. However, he just tilted his head to the side and then leaned back to balance on his palms.
? Parkinson’s potion was really messing with him because he felt like he should be the only one allowed to look at his partner like that, only he couldn’t remember exactly when he’d started feeling that way. Had it been before the Succubus? Before the potion?
, Harry thought,
,” he mouthed to Harry.
“Because I need to explain.”
Luna eyed him knowingly, but she didn’t say anything.
Like I promised, I didn’t bring any alcohol with me, even though the temptation was there and every part of me felt too awake without it. After moving into Grimmauld Place once school was over, I used alcohol for almost everything. Sad? Drink. Mad? Drink. Lonely? Drink. Anxious about being around people? Drink. Drink. Drink. In fact, I couldn’t remember the last time I wasn’t looking at the world through the haze of alcohol or a hangover.
It was especially gratifying when he got the Weasel to reveal a secret rebel safe house when he threatened the muggles life. Once the idea of leverage was on the table, Draco knew he would be able to
“You’re in pretty good shape for a potions master,” I huffed between breaths and found the trace again. It sounded like there was a stream nearby and we were heading toward it.
The music drifted through the limo like a vibrating pulse. Harry could feel it in his bones. The night was alive with possibility, which might explain why he had the unrelenting urge to slip his hand under Draco’s waistband and work his cock until it was hard.
When I turned back around, Dean and Seamus were holding hands and ushering people inside the house after Ron whispered something in their ear.
The first week as Potter’s partner had been eye-opening. Draco thought he knew the man who made school so complicated for him, but he quickly realised he was wrong. Yes, he knew parts of Potter. The obvious parts, like his annoying hero streak or his skill on a broom, but as his partner, Draco got to see the less shiny version of the famed Boy Who Lived. The Potter who left crumbs on every piece of paper he touched, the Potter who never tossed out the garbage in the bin, the Potter who didn’t care for protocol one whit. It was this Potter that Draco realised he couldn’t trust. With his history, Draco had to be better, more trustworthy, than any other Auror in the DMLE. It’s why he took his job so seriously. He wouldn’t give anyone a reason to question him.
“You two are lightweights,” I laughed.
I watched him walk away, my eyes taking in the subtle sway of his hips and the tight curve of his arse. He looked back over his shoulder at me. His lips parted slightly and it was obscene how badly I wanted those lips to part around my own.
Harry stood up, a little annoyed. He didn’t see anything wrong with that he’d said. “Put what on you?”
“Merlin, say it like that again.”
As Hermione made her speech, I search the crowd and spotted Malfoy standing at the edge of the crowd talking to Headmistress McGonagall. They looked like old friends, whispering in each other's ears. I had to admit, it seemed odd that they would get along considering their history. After a moment, Malfoy spotted me watching him and blushed, turning beet red.
“So then, why help?”
“Hmm, maybe I do. Maybe I don’t.” Luna tilted her head to the side. It reminded Draco of his old pet crup, Circe, whenever she was confused. “Why don’t you come play the game with us.”
Sometimes, I wish I died in Godric’s Hollow that night. At least then, I would have been with my parents and whatever life I lived up until then would have actually been mine.
“Kiss me again. Maybe I’ll feel it this time.”
Really, I understood the danger better than anything else. Always have since that first year when Professor Quirrel had Voldemort hitching a ride on his head. I think that was the one thing Dumbledore hadn’t planned on. I liked that feeling in a battle, the one where you weren’t sure you were going to make it out alive. Sometimes when I managed it, I almost felt sad that I didn’t die. It only got worse as I grew older. Throwing myself into danger, never thinking about the consequences, coming out without a scratch. I expect Draco Malfoy, my old rival, had been right about me on some counts. I wasn’t as righteous as I let everyone think.
That caught Harry off guard. What was he saying? He clenched his jaw and said the words that had been forming in his mind all week. “It’s now or never, Draco. It’s us, or it isn’t. Will you live with me or not?”
In the weeks that followed the Dark Lord’s ascendency, many things had changed, but more than they changed, they stayed the same. The Ministry remained intact, but more as a figurehead to placate the masses into a sleepy submission. All positions of great power and influence had been taken over by His most loyal followers, the Malfoy family included.
“Yeah, in the spirit of honesty, I’d sort of grown fond of all your dithering about proper filing and the fact that you put a coaster or napkin under my mugs when you think I’m not looking. Plus, it’s kind of nice having someone at my back. I’d forgotten what that felt like.”
Malfoy took in a deep breath and leaned into Harry, so he could whisper something, too. However, Harry didn’t hear what Malfoy had said because he was too focused on the feeling of Malfoy’s warm breath on his neck as the prat spoke.
The iron gate creaked when they pushed it open. Harry had to ignore the surge of lust that hit him when Malfoy’s elbow brushed against his as they stepped through, but since he was expecting it now, he managed to lean into the feeling, making it a little more manageable.
The dining room was lit by low hanging chandeliers which were bewitched to float above the long oak table. The wallpaper, which Draco had always disliked, was similarly bewitched. From ceiling to floor, the wallpaper showed various flowers blooming over and over. Some roses, some geraniums, others tulips, and some bluebells.
Rita Skeeter had been a bastard as long as I’d known her. She was the queen of twisting a story around. Nothing was safe around her, at least until Hermione trapped her in her animagus form. She’d lived a while as a beetle in a jar. It hadn’t completely changed her ways, but she knew to lay off us for a while. It pissed Hermione off when Skeeter’s book came out, so she had sent a letter with a picture of a beetle to jog her memory.
Draco’s eyes practically bulged out of his head like a cartoon, then he schooled his expression. “No, that’s not going to happen. No one would believe it. Plus, we all know you’re straight as...well, whatever is really straight. I might be a little tipsy, but you get the point.”
Longbottom was out of the question completely because as Draco was scanning the group, he watched Longbottom spill some of his drink down the front of his shirt. Draco was not about to wear a shirt that smelled like alcohol all night—no spell could really take that smell out of clothes.
Draco, it seemed, was equally pissed because he kicked the grass and a chunk of dirt with newly fallen snow sprinkled on it flew across the pitch. Tentatively, Harry approached Draco and suggested that they play a few round of a seekers game, ‘just to let off some steam.’
“Might need to resort to drastic measures to show him that you and Ginny are nothing more than friends,” Hermione stood up then and put a hand on Harry’s shoulder consolingly.
This was the first time Harry could remember getting to look at Malfoy uninterrupted in a long time. Malfoy’s usually calm, uptight exterior seemed to be slipping away under the effects of the potion. Harry even thought that his hair seemed less tame than it had back in the lab. Where it was usually painstakingly styled to stay out of his face, now it fell forward in strands, some falling in front of his eyes, reminding Harry of the tragic heartthrob Jack Dawson in
Harry couldn’t see any sign of the thing near the road, so it had to be in this alleyway. He’d followed it, not more than a few feet behind, as it led a petite woman out of the club, so they couldn’t have gotten too far. Someone’s life was in danger, and Harry had to help.
“Not my fault you slept through it. Come on, Potter. Who are the lucky ladies your friends deemed good enough for you?”
“Why is that? Do I not have a right to feel?”
“….so, that means you will likely be tasked with it. Draco are you listening to me?” His father’s voice cut through his thoughts. His face was set in a disappointed scowl—lips pursed, eyebrows furrowed, nose tilted to the sky as if there was a wretched stench about.
Warmth pooled in Draco’s stomach. He let his eyes flutter closed as he felt Nikola’s fingers working at the button of his trousers. Draco felt his breathing become labored as if he forgot all at once how to do it. To his side, he heard Potter’s breathing change and then a thud when Potter shuffled backward into the wall.
going to do that before
It felt like everything he expected and nothing he could have imagined at the same time. Potter’s lips were soft and unmoving, but there was a roughness around his mouth where Potter shaved. He tasted sweet like a honeysuckle in summer. He smelled like whiskey. His lips parted and Draco mirrored him—unsure.
Through the fireplace, I heard Hermione shouting at Ron to hurry up and Ron shouting back that he would except he couldn’t find his tie. I stared at his tie on the couch and smirked. Even the effort to half smile made my head feel like it was stuffed with cotton balls, so I dropped the smile and grabbed the tie, heading to their bedroom.
“Er,” Harry mumbled, but let Draco drag him toward the portrait and out of the common room to the tower that housed the eighth years dorms. There were a few stragglers from the party sitting in alcoves talking, or kissing. None of them seemed to notice Harry and Draco slink past them and down the stairs.
“Mmm,” Draco said into the kiss. He lowered his hands, sliding them beneath the waistline of Harry’s trousers and dug his nails lightly into his skin.
“What in Merlin’s name was that about anyway?” Hermione asked.
He looked over his shoulder towards the road. Cars whizzed by in the rain, cabbies picked up drunk people who were all but oblivious to the fact that London’s Nightclub Killer just walked out of the same club they’d been partying in.
Ron nodded. “It’s your love life we need to worry about now. When are you going to stop hooking up with all of London and settle down with a nice witch or wizard?” He put extra emphasis on wizard which made me worry that he knew about Malfoy somehow.
“In a moment,” Harry said, an idea forming. He decided to tear off his quidditch jersey before he could think too much on why he thought this was a good countermove. He wore nothing under it. The humid air clung to his chest making it feel almost as if the jersey was still in place.
Whoever managed to marry Mr. Potter would be set in comfort; in more ways than simple riches, though he had riches in abundance. His fortune, sizable as it was, paled in comparison to Mr. Potter’s general composition. He was charming beyond reproach and if rumors are to be believed, and they often are, Mr. Potter was quite the romantic.
Most of the dinner conversation was boring. Draco only spoke once the entire meal and that was to ask Daisy to bring him more wine, which he had been drinking in abundance. Normally, he liked to keep a clear head for these sort of meetings, but between his meeting with Potter earlier and his fathers treatment of him, Draco was feeling less than cooperative. Plus, the business talk bored him half to death.
“It’s your name. What else would I…”
“You know you fancy him. I know you fancy him. So why continue in this vein?”
“Luna, I am not sure that you do.”
“Dance with me.” A quiet smile spread across Mr. Potter’s face like wildflowers in summer.
Harry felt a blush creep up his neck at the gesture. He looked at Draco, who seemed unfazed, and felt his heart pounding madly. Draco’s hand felt
“It is terribly fun—
It was a large bathroom with a deep claw-foot tub and white and black checkered tile walls. The medicine cabinet was lined with small, soft lights which made the room look candle lit.
to say,
“Still clever as whip, I see.”
“You only heard the end of a conversation.”
I started jogging toward the trace and Malfoy kept pace with me. He didn’t complain again. I tore my eyes away from the trace and watched him move, his body toned and steady. There was sweat on his forehead and a small line of sweat around the collar of his shirt.
“I can’t believe that you actually came to the party.” Potter sloshed the bottle upward and took a long, lingering swig of the mystery alcohol, then made a scrunched-up face before turning his attention back to Draco.
I closed my eyes. Some of the only comfort I’d had in the last five years was from reading Parkinson’s books. And now she was here, dating my ex-girlfriend. I really must have pissed off the gods to make my life so complicated. I wonder if I could send them a fruit basket or something so they would lay off me for a while.
“It just seems odd that a Succubus would suddenly pop up and start killing like this,” Auror Read pushed. “Where has it been all this time? Why now?”
“What’s what?” Harry asked innocently, buying time one of the only ways he knew how: getting the bad guy to talk. He learned that tactic fighting Voldmort, sometimes the bad guy loved to monologue. Malfoy stiffened behind him, grabbed his robe, and gave it a tug. Likely he was trying to tell Harry to shut it.
”We had a deal, Harry,” Draco pointed out. “You do remember our deal, right? Casual?”
Ron let out a shuddering sigh. “If you’re right, most of the people who could help us have been mind wiped or might be dead like the caretaker. How are we supposed to get access to the adult surges like that? How can we understand the pattern with missing pieces.”
“Hi,” Potter said as casually as if they often visited each other’s homes. He dusted some ash off his robes and sneezed from the debris.
“That being said,” Potter closed the distance between them. “I want you in my life, Malfoy.”
“How social of you.”
“Do your adoring fans know all the bad, bad stuff you’ve been up to lately, Mr. Golden Boy?” Malfoy asked, his posh voice cutting through my revere. He stepped down off the last stair and smirked. “Nothings popped up in the
“Mister Malfoy, I tried to stop him,” the witch squeaked from behind Harry.
Licking his lips, Draco looked over his shoulder, and then back at Harry. “Well, the Probationary Board is reviewing my case, and my lawyer said if I had a character reference it could go a long way to showing them I’m ready to be let off probation, and well, I thought of you.” He paused long enough to let it sink in, and then took up rambling. “I know it’s terribly awkward and out of the blue. I would completely understand if it’s not something you want to do, or even have the time for. I know your schedule is busy. It’s just, when I think of someone who knows me, the real me, well, outside of my mother, who my lawyer said I
With Malfoy’s potion in hand, Harry begins to find out what is going on.
“Come on,” Harry said, knocking Draco’s knee with his own. He didn’t want to come across too eager, but he was dying to know what Draco thought he shouldn’t do. “Out with it. This is a festival for good fortune next year. Can’t start that off with a lie. Not after we just jumped over a mythical fire. It’s gotta be bad luck or something.”
“Shall we play?”
Malfoy had been shown leniency after the war. I’d made sure of it. I spoke at his and his mother’s trial. I let his father rot, the prick. Everyone thought I was mad to speak on their behalf. I did it anyway because I liked that it was the opposite of what everyone expected me to do. He’d gotten off with probation and house arrest for one year. Same for his mother. Now he works at an Apothecary shop in Hogsmeade and freelances with the Ministry creating new potions.
She smiled and said, “I’d like to ask someone who comforted me through one of the darkest times in my life, someone who never gave up on me even when it cost him dearly to do so,” she paused and Harry couldn’t believe what was about to happen. He felt Ginny tense next to him, clearly she saw where this was going as well. “Draco Malfoy, would you do me the great honor of being my man of honor?”
“You’re my favorite Gryffindor, darling,” Seamus said with a wink. That seemed to please Dean because he was beaming again and heading over to our group. When he arrived, he wrapped his arm around Seamus’s waist and pulled him in for a soft kiss. Just lips brushing lips.
That made Harry laugh, and he shook his head at his friend. Draco glanced at him to see what was so funny, but Harry just smiled and said, “Solstice Punch. Blaise, Dean, and Seamus made it.”
Ryder nodded a hello at Harry, then extended a hand for Draco to shake, which he did, maybe for a beat longer than was usual. “Nice to finally meet you, Draco.”
“You okay?” Harry found himself unable to avoid asking the question. At that moment, nothing seemed more interesting than whatever was going through Malfoy’s head.
“We aren’t drunk now.”
. It was only right that he be punished, too.
“Well, technically he is dating someone else, so I doubt he cares,” Harry felt himself gearing up to whine again. He was positively tired of hearing himself whine, but at the same time, he couldn't help it.
“We...uh...need...potion,” Potter managed to get out between ragged breaths. He leaned back on the metal counter, and fanned himself with the file. His cheeks flushed pink, making Draco’s heart skip a beat, though that could also be from the running.
“We chatted a bit about her new girlfriend and then, of course, my deplorable behavior.” I shrugged and took the ottoman and slid it closer to the couch so I could look them both in the eyes. “I suppose some things never do change, eh?”
“Is there somewhere more private we could go?”
“Yeah.” She looked down at Harry’s hand on her knee and then placed her hand over his and squeezed back. “He’s...nice.”
Hermione, like Ginny, figured it all out, but reminds Harry that Draco is a bit skittish and the prophet just published an article that might make Draco fear that Harry isn't interested.
It was his first kiss. He didn’t know where to put his hands, so they were clenched at his sides. His nails digging into his palms. The pain was easy to ignore because Potter’s chest hammered against him. Draco wondered if Potter was nervous. His heart seemed to beat as fast as Draco’s and Draco
Harry tugged his coat tighter around his torso. “Just needed a minute. Had a hard day at work. Didn’t want to carry it in with me.” He shrugged for good measure. If he was honest, everyday as an Auror was a hard day, but Neville didn’t need to know that.
Ron took the newspaper back and tossed it in the bin. He was quiet for a moment and then turned to me, patting me on the shoulder. “Things just need to calm down a bit. Just a bit fresh in people’s minds. It’s only been two months. Everyone needs time. That’s all.”
“Yes, obviously.”
“He could have just passed out?” Ron’s voice came from directly above my face. I could feel his breath hot on my face. He was shaking my shoulders. “Harry, what the actual fu—”
in his, and the sensation filled up a hole in his chest that he hadn’t been aware of having—one that had been torn open long ago. He didn’t want to let go.
The only sign that she had been drowned was the small trickle of water dripping from the corners of her mouth. Otherwise, she looked composed. More composed than the Bloody Baron or Nearly Headless Nick, anyway.
“They love her.”
“Well, I suppose I should start with why Ginny and I broke up?” Harry asked carefully. Nervously, he ran his hand through his hair and pulled out a few knots. He wasn’t sure how much Ginny had shared with Luna. The women were roommates and did seem to know nearly everything about one another, but still.
They sat there for a while in silence, looking at the moon. Charlie's body was squished against his in attempt to stay warm. The night was becoming unforgivably cold, but Harry couldn't make himself move, yet.
“Hermione can handle it.” I slowly dragged my hand off his chest and my body felt like it was one fire. I swallowed, hard. “She said you guys worked together on it.”
Malfoy brought a hand up to his throat where the most delicious looking blush was starting to bloom. I could see the pulse in his neck throbbing. He let out a nervous laugh. “You are truly as reckless as everyone says.”
After that, everything had passed in a blur. Snape showing up mere seconds after the closet disappeared. Yelling. So much yelling. Malfoy yelped once and Harry had to stifle a laugh because the distinct purple color Snapes face was turning indicated that laughing would only make things worse.
Draco always made him feel like he was on display somehow. Not on display in the way the Daily Prophet or the rest of the wizarding world put him on display like he was some rare animal they needed to study or understand. With Draco, it was more that he was seeing the things Harry hid from everyone else and he was zeroing in on them like a hawk would it’s dinner.
Malfoy was beautiful. He was tall, with the lean muscles of a seeker. His pale skin was like moonlight shining on still water. And those eyes, sharp and piercing like a hawk, and yet sincere and earnest, like a doe.
“That is not what I meant and you know it. I meant why are you here asking me about this?”
Harry runs into Draco again at a tux fitting and they have a Moment™️. Neville expresses some concerns. And we meet Stella (I love her).
“I did—I do,” Draco managed to answer, though he wasn’t sure how because all his thoughts were focused on Potter’s hand holding his.
After that, his mates bombarded him with questions that he didn’t have the answers to, and some he did have the answers to, but he got too much enjoyment out of watching Hermione hate that she didn’t understand something that he never answered.
When Malfoy was out of earshot, Ned said to Harry, “Sorry, I didn’t realise you two were...well hey, you miss all the shots you don’t take. Hope you find what you’re looking for, Auror Potter.”
“I agree it’s odd, and we can ask Neville all about it later, but we have more pressing matters,” Ron said. “Like tracing the magic that killed the caretaker. The longer we are here, the more likely it is someone spots us and tells the someone who tells the Unspeakables and then we will be screwed because if they mange to erase out memories of the magical surges, who will figure out why they are happening?”
“Thank you, but I am comfortable merely observing the goings on of the party.”
“A Weasley?” Draco snorted before he could stop himself. “No, I’m afraid not.”
“It just sort of came out,” Charlie offered, but his voice sounded small and far away. Harry could tell it was a lie. That was one of the affects of spending so much time with a person. Eventually, you can't lie to them.
“Truth or Dare?” Potter asked without any preamble.
“You’re lucky to be alive then.”
“You would have told Robards, and I couldn’t take that chance. I needed to find this thing and stop it before someone else died.”
He sat there a moment appreciating the beauty of Draco—hard and leaking for him .
Ron strolled closer. He had a lopsided grin on his face. He looked properly drunk, but I saw his eyes were clear as day. “I think we should portkey. Looks suspicious if we do anything out of expected. We don’t know who could be watching.” He let out a burst of a laugh and patted me on the back hard enough to make me stagger.
Out in the courtyard, Harry scanned the crowd. Ron had been talking to him, but Harry couldn’t hear a word because his eyes spotted a streak of white-blonde hair across the courtyard. Draco was sitting with Pansy, lazily eating an apple—juice covering his lips. He wasn’t wearing his robes. They were in a careless pile next to him on the bench. His shirt was unbuttoned at the top, revealing a pale chest. His legs were crossed and Harry noted the flex of his thigh muscles.
, Harry felt his breath hitch.
“Hey, aren’t you supposed to be at some fancy dinner with your parents?” Harry asked, genuinely curious. The last year had been one weird thing after the other, including, but not limited to, his newfound friendship with Draco. He knew the Malfoys had planned a formal evening as a charity event to pay reparations as part of their post-war probation.
When he reached the newly built West Tower and the portrait of Sir Hilliard the Bard, who apparently sang his way to victory against a hoard of mountain trolls, Harry sang the password. Yes, sang it because Sir Hilliard would not accept a spoken word. At least it wasn’t a hard note to reach.
He grinned. “You haven’t even seen the best part yet.” He moved to the side and ushered us inside. “Everyone is out back in the garden.”
I was wearing my cleanest pair of jeans with a gray t-shirt that had three buttons at the collar. I left them undone, glad that I decided on the cotton shirt instead of the button up. The heat was unbearable today. An unusually hot May day according to the papers. The papers also boasted that there hadn’t been any magical surges in over a week, so maybe Harry Potter was buckling under the pressure of being everyone's Golden Boy. There are reasons why I don’t like the papers and that's one of them.
The grounds were empty. No mourners. Nothing. Not even a sign that aurors or Unspeakables had even been here. Not a footprint in the mud except for our own. The bloody handprint was gone from the gravestone. The only clue that anything happened here was the still upturned dirt in front of the grave. The hole wasn’t far down, maybe a foot. Whoever had been digging it must have been interrupted. The Unspeakables must have missed the hole when they were making sure this crime was swept under the rug with the rest of them. The bastards.
“They make quite the pair,” Mr. Potter commented. He stood stiffly beside Draco now. No doubt, he had not anticipated losing his companion and being stuck socializing with Draco.
“Say something, please,” Harry begged, feeling like he was about to throw himself off the tower’s edge. “Say something, even if it’s ‘get lost.’ Please.”
stamped across the front in black ink. “Take some time today to go over what Malfoy collected. It is thoroughly researched and organised.”
“And you’re worried it would ruin our friendship?” Harry prodded. He couldn’t stop his smile, or the way he’d unconsciously leant closer to Draco as he spoke.
“I could wear a dress if that helps,” Harry huffed out, forcing himself to laugh. If he didn’t laugh, he might do something stupid like kiss those obnoxiously pouty lips.
“May I ask why you thought I could not possibly fancy you?” Mr. Potter whispered against Draco’s cheek as they swayed.
“I’m tired,” Draco half-lied. “The potion took it out of me.”
Harry pulled the door open, hoping he wasn’t making a mistake going in without being sure he could cast, and took in the scene in front of him. In the middle of the room, atop the resting place of Howard Benchley in the light of the circle of candles, the Succubus was straddling the man and moving her hips in a circular motion. A blue glow emitted from his mouth which hung open in absolute pleasure and floated from his mouth into her own.
“I see someone who looks like they work here.” Malfoy pointed to a man in a green jumpsuit who was pulling up some weeds near one of the newer graves. “We should ask him if he’s seen anything odd. Narrow down a location where the Succubus might be hiding out while she completes activating the Ley Lines. She’d stay close by.”
“Best ingredients are out here, of course,” she said.
If the touch affected Malfoy at all, Harry couldn’t tell, and that sort of bothered him. Here he was a live wire, and Malfoy was fine all of a sudden? Hardly seemed fair.
I started to laugh and my body shook with it. “I’m still in pain, Gin. Every day and all I can do is ignore it because if I let myself feel it, I won’t be able to save people.”
. He means we,” Draco added. He eyed Pansy and she gave him the merest raise of a brow to indicate that she wanted to know why Draco had let himself get roped into running all the way down to the lab for a potion that was not yet ready.
“I—I am, against my better judgement—the things I feel…you have always been…” Draco tailed off. Admitting his feelings was harder than he would have ever anticipated. But he was here now, he was finally going to admit to something that he had been ignoring for his entire life. Admit to something that went against every rational thought he had.
Draco shifted next to him and suddenly he was hanging over Harry’s face, apparently sitting up on his knees to look Harry in the eye. “I’m sorry, but where is Potter and what have you done with him?”
Harry goes to ask for help from Draco Malfoy because Ron and Hermione voted and he lost.
To Harry’s utter embarrassment, a crowd had begun to form. Ron was among them, though the collection of on-lookers had the curtesy to make it look like they were working and definitely not listening.
“You’re no fun today,” Malfoy whined. He turned away from me and headed toward the door to the back of the shop. He didn’t turn around or indicate that I should follow him, but I did it anyway.
“That bloke was an odd duck, wasn’t he?” Potter asked when he caught up.
“Thinking about what?” Hermione asked.
“Oh, right.” Draco knelt down to pick up Potter’s white shirt and slipped it over his head. It smelled like sweat and Potter’s cologne. Then he slipped himself in Potter’s jeans which were a little too big in the waist and a little short in the leg. He fastened the belt tight and knelt down, ignoring his own bulge, and cuffed the legs.
“Dance with you? Here? Now?”
“I heard Hermione scream,” Potter said through gritted teeth. “What did you do to her? I swear if you hurt her, I will—”
“Well, you have come to the right place. We happen to have lots of potions here, Auror Potter. Anything in particular?” Pansy managed to come across helpful, but Draco knew better. The more polite she sounded, the more likely it was that she was moments away from taking your head off.
“I’m glad we totally agree on that, then.” Draco laughed and rested his forehead on Harry’s.
“Well, I might have done, but apparently Ron gets to know things before me, so I am not sure I am up to giving advice,” Hermione cocked her head to the side teasingly and then she poked her tongue out at him like a toddler.
