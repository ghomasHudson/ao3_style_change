. You reacted before we could explain, and then ran off like a two-year old. Now you’ve missed some of the most important moments of your son’s life.”
Harry was confused, and a little afraid. Draco never just left. There was always a note or a message or something.
“I’ll go floo my parents and ask if we may keep the house,” Blaise said quietly. He left the room and made his way to the front room where he tossed a pinch of floo powder into the fire and then waited. “Hello mother,” he said when he saw her face appear. “We’re fine, before you ask. And before you ask when we’re coming home, that’s what I’m calling about. Harry and I were wondering if we may stay here, permanently. We’ve become rather attached to the château, and we already have a live-in medi-witch, one of the finest in Europe.”
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well, thank you both for coming. As you can clearly see, we have a few things to discuss and announce. We will get to
Such a simple question. Of course he wasn’t okay. His whole world had tilted on its axis the day he found out he was a wizard in this whole other world. The day that detention was to be served tilted his world again. From there, things seemed to steady themselves.
He paused for a few moments to drink some water. Harry took a sip as well, keeping his eyes moving from person to person in the room and a hand on Draco at all times. “So, a week into our ordeal and I’m without a wand. I threw a fit, let me tell you. We tried to see if we could piece it together somehow, but it was dead and gone. Harry finally pulled me away and we continued on. By the end of the day, he was so sick of my whining. He gave me his wand. I know a wizard’s wand is made for him and him alone, but others can sometimes use another’s wand. And it was so with Harry’s wand. It was almost too easy for me to use it.
. Dumbledore vetted and approved of the other reporter before he was allowed to visit Hogwarts for the interviews. No Quick Quotes Quills were allowed to be used. Harry and Draco would have final say on anything prior to printing.
When Voldemort fell, all action stopped almost immediately. The backlash riveted through the Dark Marks, disrupting the battle and spells being cast. Aurors and Order Members alike began casting
Blaise just laughed lightly and looked at the black and white screen before them. “Harry?” Theresa asked after a few moments of silence. “Have you thought of a name for the baby yet?”
“Ah, you know all about that already. She's driving me nutters. Almost makes me wanna bat for the other team, eh? Pregnancy hormones are a killer!”
The elder Malfoy quickly smothered Snape on the couch to hide his partially nude body from view of the teenagers gawking from within the guest bedroom. “What are all of you doing here at this hour?!”
“Dunno. We just did. It had been a while since anything had happened, and I guess we got lax in our defenses. We stumbled upon her lair I think. I heard a few mewling sounds before Harry fell to the ground coughing something awful. I ran to him, trying to help him. But he levitated me to a tree and put up wards to keep me there and anything from getting to me. Then the nundu crawled out from wherever and attacked him. He tried not to fight back too much, to show her that he meant no harm. He has this way of talking to the plants and animals… I can’t explain it. He’ll have to show you sometime.
a wise decision. You nearly drained yourself completely. Dumbledore gave some of his magic to you so it would replenish itself over time as magic normally does. Father and Severus do thank you for removing the Marks, however.”
“You honestly thought we forgot, didn't you?” Draco said with a chuckle. “You really thought that your friends and family and co-workers forgot that you turned twenty-one today. Harry, you're famous! There are kids sitting at home right now wishing you a happy birthday.” He turned his dark-haired lover around to look into his eyes. “You foolish man,” he murmured and then kissed him long and hard.
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
’s fireplace and floo connection to floo into the infirmary where Draco and Madame Pomfrey stood waiting.
With a shocked expression on his face, Dumbledore quickly left the infirmary. Poppy set up monitoring wards and spells to let her know if anyone else entered the hospital wing before closing, locking, and warding the door to the private room she, Harry, and Draco were in now. “Please, Harry, I am sorry for the interruption. I am so sorry if I frightened you. I have placed wards and charms around this room and the whole hospital ward. I will know if anyone comes in, and the door is locked so they cannot get into this room. Please, allow me to treat both you and Draco. Just place him back on the bed. I must check on the baby.”
Snape kissed the robe of his master as all the others before him. “Of course, my Lord, you know I live to serve you and only you. I was not told of Malfoy’s heir leaving Hogwarts in any other means besides those which would transport him back to Malfoy Manor. I was even asked to brew several potions for him, and give them to the school mediwitch so they could be given to him.”

Dr. Morris sighed. “Theresa Rhodes was hired as a live-in medi-witch for Harry. There. Okay, let the questions begin. Harry, how many men have you had sexual relations with?”
“The middle name is perfect Harry,” Blaise began softly, slowly. “Even the first name, McKay, is a nice name. I like it. But the last name… Harry, it would have to be McKay Draconis Zabini. You married me, not Draco. There’s no telling what would happen if you introduced your baby as a Malfoy. An upset would be a vast understatement. I want his middle name to be Draconis, and was going to suggest ‘Draco’ myself. However, the last name
On his way to the great hall for breakfast, he was stopped by Professor Crowly ,,Good that I see you Mr. Malfoy. I discussed with Professor McGonagall the events of last night and after she suggested reconsidering the decision regarding your stay in Hogwarts-“ Draco felt his heart drop ,,-she gave me the instructions to decide, what punishment the two of you should receive“ right now, he wished he would’ve just stayed at the Manor. Now he had to take the humiliation of being thrown out and all he could do was pretend that he didn’t care ,,So, I will see the two of you for the next two weeks, in my office after class“ Draco couldn’t hide the surprise upon the fact that he wasn’t being thrown out, considering what he had done last year, when he had ’‘wandered“ around the castle, and Professor Crowly only chuckled lightly at his reaction.
,,Well, well, well, what do we got here? Mr. Malfoy and..“ he directed his light towards Potter, who had a surprised look on his face upon the realization that the pitiful figure that had been sitting on the ground was none other than Draco Malfoy ,,..Mr. Potter“ he looked at them both with a strict stare ,,As you should’ve been in your beds at this time and the door clearly locked, I would like to hear an explanation!“ Professor Crowly might be new  but even he knew about the hostility between the two, so it was quite surprising to find them together, in the middle of the night ,,I didn’t come here with him“ was the first thing Draco said, as if he needed to make clear that he still hated Harry with all his might ,,I appreciate the information Mr. Malfoy but right now, I am not interested on how the two of you encountered each other but more interested on why you aren’t in your beds in the middle of the night“ Harry scratched his neck, unsure on how to answer that question without telling him that he felt suffocated in his bedroom and needed fresh air to calm himself down
The next morning came way too fast for Draco’s liking but at least he woke up before Blaise and packed his things to avoid a fight, before the first class even had started. He wasn’t sure if the defeat last night would be enough for Blaise to leave him alone but he hoped so. At this early hour, only very few students were awake and sitting together in the common room, only glancing at the blonde who walked past them out the room but not without catching the last sentence of one of the girls, saying how much he wished he would’ve never came back. Draco knew he would be an idiot if he would let those kind of remarks from people, he didn’t care for at all, get to him, so he continued his way with his head held high as if there was nothing that could make him loose his calm.
But he knew Blaise and him could never be friends again. Draco had started to realize that the way he had been brought up wasn't as good as he believed it to be and slowly he couldn't find it in himself anymore to hate the people, he had called mudblood and blood traitors for many years and Blaise probably hasn't changed at all.
,,Fine!“ Blaise spatted and lowered himself down to Draco’s height ,,I’m gonna finish you!“ and with that he stormed away and Draco mentally slapped himself, for letting his impulsiveness get the best of him. He knew he needed to show Blaise somehow that he wasn’t someone you could treat like this without consequences but it was a mystery to him why he needed to suggest something that required him to break quite a lot of rules. He was risking his stay in Hogwarts.
Draco felt Harry beside him visibly shifting nervously and chuckled into himself ,,The great Harry Potter, scared of a little black hole“ Harry rolled his eyes, muttering just lightly that he hated small spaces but it seemed as just an excuse for Draco. They continued crawling their way through the dark, their wands the only source of light. They had no idea how far they were down but it seemed to go downwards slightly the whole time and after what felt like an eternity, the small path started to grow, letting them slowly walk straight until it ended up in a cave big enough for them to stand up comfortably. ,,Thats...“ Harry said as they saw the pile of scales, scattered around the whole cave ,,Who could do something like this?“ his voice full of resentment.
,,Harry!“ Hagrid’s upset voice echoed through the dead silence and Harry and Draco turned around, seeing the gamekeeper storming their way ,,What happened?“ ,,The elf, he did it again. He took the mermaid with him. Hagrid, who is that elf?“ the look on his adult friend said more than enough. This wasn’t some simple matter as someone selling the scales to make profit ,,Don’t worry, Harry. The ministry will take care of this“ ,,Yeah, sure. Just like they always did,huh?“ Draco looked at Harry, wondering if the boy ever had enough of thinking that everything was his responsibility. After all that happened, couldn’t he just let the adult’s deal with it? Hagrid sighed and looked at the spot where the blood of the mermaid still lingered, slowly dripping down into the water ,,The elf is just not as ordinary as we thought. We don’t know where he comes from or who his Masters are but they seem to possess quite a lot of power as they were able to get the elf out of the ministry and it looks like they even dared to let him continue his horrific work“ Hagrid who had always been a friend of the misunderstood creatures was filled with grief upon the fate of the poor mermaid that Harry and Draco couldn’t save. ,,It’s already late, you two can go back now“ ,,But-“ ,,No buts, Harry. It’s late and I need to send an owl, regarding....the whole spectacle here“ knowing it made no sense to try and get Hagrid to spill more right now Harry decided to give up for now and follow the orders of the gamekeeper. Draco still hadn’t said one word and was now being eyed by Harry, who had noticed the face of the blonde to be even more pale than usual. He really wondered how that guy was able to become a death eater if he was so easily scared but what Harry didn’t knew was that it wasn’t the scenario that just happened that had make Draco frozen, it were the memories that were trying to creep onto him, throwing him back into a time he would rather like to forget.
That night, he hadn’t gotten a wink of sleep. The words of the greengrass girl still vivid in his mind, while he was playing with the scale, he had picked up from the ground, between his fingers. She was right. The belief in purity of blood as something of more worth had done so much harm. He wondered, if those beliefs had never existed, would’ve changed it history a lot? His parents weren’t good people, whatever they believed in purity of blood or not but he still couldn’t shake the small possibility of his life turning out very differently if they hadn’t been so blinded by their hatred. He couldn’t understand what made the difference between his parents and him. After seeing all this sorrow, all this deaths and the brutality of the life he had been so ready to throw himself into, he could no longer pretend that the nagging feeling inside him that something felt wrong didn’t exist. His parents, they had been part of the cause for all this sorrow and deaths. He wondered if they ever felt this nagging feeling inside them too and had just chosen to drown it out or if it was never there.
Back in the castle, they separated ways without exchanging a word and on his way back to the Slytherin common room, he saw Astoria sitting on a bench in the inner courtyard. Her eyes glued to the ground as her mind seemed to be far away. He chewed on his lips as he observed her from far, contemplating wherever he should go talk to her or leave her alone. She was quite upset yesterday and maybe she really didn’t felt like talking to him anymore.
Draco let his tired body rest for a moment as he sat down on the edge of his bed and buried his face in his hands. He really questioned if it was the right decision to go back.
As they entered the Slytherin common room, Draco stopped awkwardly and waited for the girl to do the same, which she did as she realized that he wasn't going to head into the opposite direction ,,What is it?“ no hint of annoyance or any negative feelings could be found in her voice and Draco took that as a good sign. He rubbed his neck uncomfortably and looked everywhere else but her ,,Thank you“ he murmured but she heard it, a light chuckle escaping her mouth ,,Astoria“ he looked up and saw that she wore a small smile on her pink lips, which made her look even more pretty ,,My name is Astoria“ before Draco could say another word, she disappeared the stairs up that lead to the girls compartment and Draco sighed tired. When he opened the door to his room, he found Zabini sleeping soundly in his bed as if he had been there the whole night and it really took a lot of him to not hex his roommate in this very moment. But he guessed that McGonagall wouldn't be too happy, finding out that he was already causing trouble in his first night back. He was convinced that his stay in Hogwarts pretty much depended on his behavior.
,,You still got time to leave” Blaise mocked but Draco uttered no word, instead raised his wand as an answer. They both took a few step backwards and took their most comfortable fight position. Pansy came forward in her blue skirt, that left little to the imagination and positioned herself between them, her right hand holding her wand that was pointed at the sky above them.
,,Your father, he is on his way“ finally Draco's whole attention laid on her, his eyes wide open, surprised by the news he just had been told ,,Yes, you brought him back, son“ her face was practically glowing with pride she felt for knowing it was all thanks to their son that they could be reunited again soon ,,I am so proud of you“ he let himself be embraced in her arms but he felt nothing. Should he not be happy that his mother was proud and his father on his way back home? Finally, his father would recognize him as a real man, a son he was supposed to be proud of. That’s all he ever wanted, right? So why did he felt so out of place? ,,The dark Lord, who knows, might even forgive your father for his mistakes and we will be back in his favor. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?“ she lifted her sons head up with her hand and tried to look right into his eyes, trying to find that spark she was trying to lighten up ,,We can go back to the way, things were before“ she gave him a kiss on the cheek and Draco finally gave her a light smile, a heavy contrast to his haggard features and empty eyes. She was right, he should be proud. He finally made his parents proud and if they would be given the chance to prove their loyalty once more towards the dark Lord because of him than it was something to be very proud of.
,,We will take them back to their rightful owners, who had been the ones to ask to deliver the request to Hagrid. That man is a good man“ ,,Indeed“ ,,But for what?“ the sudden voice of Draco, who had been absolutely silent the last hours turned everyones attention on him. The mermaid who had spoken just seconds before looked straight into his grey eyes and he felt a weird sensation in his stomach. As if she could look right into his soul and he really did not liked that feeling ,,I know who you are“ she said, her voices now deeper and scarier and Draco felt like she was right beside him, whispering those words into his eyes and her wet, slimy hands on his shoulder ,,To us mermaids, our scale’s are a treasure, a part of ourselves that shows our beauty and where we come from. Now that they have been ripped away brutally and left our family to bleed and die, they just want them back to mourn what they have lost. They might not look like a treasure for humans like you but they are very much to us“ Draco said nothing afterwards, only watched Harry say goodbye to the two creatures, who disappeared just as quickly as they had broken through the surface. Harry, who was already on his way back turned around when he couldn’t hear any other footsteps than his own and saw how Draco pulled out his hand from his jacket, a green shimmering scale in his hand and carefully placed it on the edge of the footbridge. He guessed whoever it belonged to would like to have it back.
When Draco lifted his head, he could see the reflection of Rowle inside the bathroom mirror, right behind him, his bloodshot eyes spread wide open and starring at him while he screamed loud enough that Draco felt like his eardrums were going to burst.
,,My Lord“ he heard the voice of Snape, who seemed to have left the corner he had been hiding in since they left Hogwarts and walked towards Voldemort. Everyone stood straight up slowly again and Voldemort listened to Snape, telling him how Albus Dumbledore had met his end, leaving out one little detail that would’ve revealed that Draco had lowered his wand, way before Snape had come into sight. A bloodcurdling laugh broke through the thick silence and was soon followed by more laughter's of the death eaters, Snape and Draco trying to give at least a halfhearted smile. The dark Lord’s eyes fixated on Draco and he felt his mother beside him tensing ,,Well done, boy. Even though the opportunity to end the life of this disgraceful Wizard yourself was....let’s say, stolen from you, you did very well“ he gave him what probably was supposed to be a grin but it felt more like  he was considering if he should give him to his Snake as dinner. That thought wouldn’t even be that far-fetched. ,,Now” his voice loud and clear ,,bring me the man who dared to betray me“ his voice was ice cold and only seconds later a death eater, named Rowle came into sight, who was pushing a middle aged man in front of him, towards the dark lord. His short gray hair was a mess, the blue eyes full of fear  ,,My Lord“ he had started but was painfully interrupted as Rowle, broke his kneecaps and he fell to the ground with screams of pure pain coming out of his mouth. Draco flinched and wanted to take his eyes off but his mother stopped him from doing so, afraid the dark Lord would see the weakness of her son. ,,Do not dare to speak to the Lord, you pathetic disgrace“ Rowle spatted hatefully and Voldemort closed his eyes for a moment, only disapproving of the said ones behavior ,,No, no Rowle, let the man speak“ the dark Lord kneeled down in front of the pitiful figure that was in so much pain and smiled lightly ,,M-My L-Lord, please“ he begged, tears running down his face ,,I beg you, p-please. M-My kid, h-he“ ,,Don’t worry about your kid“ he interrupted him ,,I will make sure that he will find out how you have tried to save his life. I will“ the man went silent for a moment as if he wasn’t sure what to make of his word but it did not took long before the meaning of the words had sunken in and he started shouting ,,NO, PLEASE! NOT MY KID! NOT MY KID!“ Voldemort only gave a short nod towards Rowle and watched the man merciless crying and shouting when Rowle spoke the unforgivable curse, that caused the one to receive it, to be in a pain that you would never be able to explain. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and tried to block out this horrifying screams that filled the room but to no avail. Those screams would be forever burned into his memories.
Draco wanting nothing more than to go back to his room in the break but of course it wasn’t granted when Zabini blocked the way, with Cole and Trista on each side of him ,,Liked your nightly trip?“ he grinned spiteful and the other two copied the grin. Draco knew, he had to be careful as he still remembered Professor Mc.Gonagall’s words but he could also not let them get away with thinking that they could do whatever they want with him. He shortened the distance between him and Zabini with one big step and gave him a cocky smile ,,Pretty cowardly of you. I thought you got more but I guess that little brain of yours is too busy stuffing your tongue into Pansy’s mouth“ ,,Don’t you fucking dare to talk about my girlfriend!“ he pushed Draco, who slightly stumbled back but catched himself fast. He looked up at the face of the angered Blaise and just smirked ,,That’s all?“ he sighed as if he was utterly disappointed at the childish tries of his ex friend. Some people stopped, to see what was happening (and probably because they wanted to witness Draco Malfoy receiving a beating) and others just rolled their eyes at their childish behavior ,,You know Blaise, you talk so much but I see so less. Why don’t we just make things clear, once and for all, huh!?“ if looks could kill, Draco would be dead by now. Blaise hatred for him, seemed to come from deep within and he wondered how the guy had been, standing beside him all those years, smiling and telling him that they were friends.
,,I bet he wants Voldemort to return“ it had been only three days since he had come back to Hogwarts but with the press taunting him the last months, he felt already used to the sporadic insults he would catch in the corridors ,,What do you think, happened with his...mark?“ ,,I g-“ he shut his door forcefully and threw his cloak angrily onto his bed. He looked at his left forearm that was covered in his white blouse and felt the skin beneath itching, absentmindedly drawing little circles. A Scar that would never fade away. He shook the thought away and started undressing, not feeling like giving any attention to his emotions at the moment.
,,I see you have decided to decline the offer Mr. Potter“ the professor spoke and smiled gently at the boy, who only gave a light nod as an answer
There was a storm inside him and Draco really didn’t knew what to make of it. Just three hours ago, he had left Hogwarts in a hurry with his aunt and fellow Death eaters after having witnessed the death of one of the most powerful Wizards. A death that should’ve actually been his cause. Now he was sitting inside his bedroom, starring at the ground unable to comprehend all that had just happened. His hands were shaking visibly and what started out as soundless tears escaping his eyes broke into heart wrenching sobs and his facade, he had been trying so hard to hold up the past year finally broke and there was nothing more to see than a boy, who was broken in a way no 16 year old should be. This whole thing, his whole life, it was just too much. Everything was just too much there was no escape. No way out if he wants his parents and himself to continue living, even though he didn’t felt like wanting to live much at the moment. Not that he hadn’t thought about it many times before in the last year but he was way too much of a coward to actually every consider really doing it. Death was just too frightening. He heard voices downstairs and he tried so hard to get himself to calm down but he just couldn’t, the sobs left his body shaking and he had no control over them. He didn’t want this. He wanted nothing of this anymore. He just wanted his old life back. It might have not been as good as it may have seen to other people but it was definitely better than right now. After an hour he had finally been able to get himself to calm down and tried to lock his emotions away again but since the beginning of the year, it had not been as easy as it used to be and right now it almost seemed impossible. He was able to find his composure back but the cracks were still visible enough that everyone would immediately see the terrified boy behind that mask if they looked closely enough. A knock on his door threw him mercilessly back into reality and he stood up, dusting his pants and told the person behind the door to come in. It was his mother, who smiled warmly at him. She walked towards him and  rested her left hand on his cheek. Draco tried to give her a smile, which looked more like a grimace than a smile but Narcissa didn’t care, she was just happy her son was alive and back where she could keep any eye on him
It did not took long and he saw a lot of students making their way through the crowd and he might regret it a bit to have not decided to wear something that hide more of him. Just like people have seen him the last years, he was dressed in a black suit, with a black blouse, the only difference was his hair. He used to wear it slicked back or to the side, just like his parents always told him to because it looked neat and distinguished but he found a new liking to a more messier hairstyle. The light curls he had always hid underneath all the hair gel were now visible and bouncing lightly around his left side, where he had styled them to fall.
It was really to no surprise that Blaise and he were good friends. Together they had often talked about how they wished that all mudbloods and blood traitors would find a painful end, talked about how they would first torture them and would give them the rest with one of the unforgivable curses, even going as far to name a few of their fellow students they wouldn't care about if they died. They had laughed about it as if they told each other a funny story. At that time both of them didn't really knew what they were talking about, they had been raised that way and Draco, who was forced to actually torture someone had realized that talking about it and doing it are two very different things and those weren't things to be joked about even though he has to admit, at that time they weren't that much of jokes.
Throughout the day, Draco found himself feeling sick and tired. He wished to have just stayed in his bed the whole day but without a sick note from Ms. Pomfrey, which he doubted he would get, he wouldn’t be allowed to. In the afternoon he went to Hagrid again, wondering what they would do today and when he arrived, Hagrid was about to lock his door ,,Oh, Draco, you’re here“ he put his key in his tremendously big pocket and smiled lightly at the boy in front of him ,,I know you are supposed to be doing your punishments but the discovery of the cave hole and the house elf seems to be more than it looks like and I“ he emphasized the ’I‘ very clearly ,,-was ordered to help in this matter“ ,,Does that mean I can just go back to my room then?“ Draco said, clearly not caring about Hagrids pride ,,Eh, well not exactly. Harry said you two could go back into the forest and collect as much as mermaids scales as you can find....they would like to have them back“ ,,Why? Not like they can just put them back on“ ,,Sometimes, Draco. Things don’t have to be useful to have a value“ his emphatic voice gave the words an intention, Draco couldn’t quite figured out and as he wandered around the forest with Harry ahead, he asked himself over and over what the half-giant meant. If something was of no use, why bother? Distracted by his thoughts time went by quickly and three hours later, their bags had been filled to the brink and float through the air right behind them as they made their way towards the sea. Harry had used his wand to send a signal down into the depth of the dark sea and in a matter of seconds something emerged from the deep and revealed itself as two mermaids. Their expressions carried distrust as they eyed Draco but he could swear a light smile formed on their pale lips when Harry greeted them ,,Hagrid told us, you wanted them back. I guess we missed a few but we tried as good as we could“ ,,Thank you Mr. Potter“ their voices were like whispers close to your ear and made your skin crawl, a feeling neither of them felt like embracing ,,If you don’t mind, what are you gonna do with this?“ Harry asked as if he could read Dracos mind, who was only waiting for the right moment to ask the same
“Ummm… Uh, before his detention. Dinner! Dinner in the Great Hall two months ago. I thought that was a long time for even Malfoy to recover,” he grumbled. “What does this mean?”
A quick trip to the dungeons and he had the potion. However, instead of the hasty getaway he expected, he found Draco and Potter, Potter-
“I understand,” Blaise interrupted. “It’s the truth, on all accounts.” He sighed. “Theresa did say to take it easy though. I know you like the gardens, but it’s nearly freezing out there. Even with the extra layers and heating charms, you have to be careful of ice on the ground. And although I’m not McKay’s father I am your friend. I’m concerned is all, okay? So just… take it easy. I don’t want you to have gone through all of this just to have something happen. I’m sorry to keep bringing you down by saying that, but I just want you to be careful.”
“I do love him, Father. It may have started out as survival, but it is now... I love him.” He looked straight into his father’s eyes as he said this, not backing down for any reason. This was an issue he would not be moved from. These were his feelings, his thoughts, his life here; not his father’s, not his professor’s, not anyone else’s. It seemed his father understood this, because his eyes shifted back to the prone form on the bed.
“I’m no idiot, Mal– Draco. Some of these pieces are starting to come together to form a picture, one which tells me this is Harry’s room. As one of his best friends, I have a right to be here.” She sat, willing the Slytherin to pick a fight with her and not at the same time. Another piece of that puzzle she was forming had to do with the hand on the midsection of her greatest rival. That piece had not quite clicked into place yet.
“I want to know how you became blind and how you see now. We know you became mute after the nundu attack, but nothing about your eyes.”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“We will continue this discussion tomorrow, Potter,” Snape said calmly before walking to the door. He paused. “Goodnight Draco. Sleep well. I will see you tomorrow.”
“Right. I want to know why they’ve changed Malfoy’s story for sure.” Hermione bowed her head in thought, trying to come up with an answer that didn’t make her want to burst into tears. “Surely they won’t give up the search. It’s Harry! And Mr. Malfoy would make sure they kept looking for his son. So unless Malfoy really did go home, I doubt anything’s changed for the better. But I just can’t bear to think of anything else!”
Harry smiled and helped Draco to his feet, keeping him balanced with his left arm around Draco’s waist and his right holding Draco’s right hand. They said their goodbyes and made their way back to their dungeon rooms. With the addition of the nursery, they almost had more space than Snape did. Dumbledore had said he’d take care of their presents, so neither worried about those. After settling a naked Draco into bed, Harry curled up behind him in nothing but his pants to look at the baby names book.
Blaise merely laughed once the door slammed. “Ah, mood swings as well. It has been an amazing two months so far,” he commented vaguely. “So if we shall continue? You all have great credentials, and I believe you are excellent in your field and will maintain secrecy. However, as much as he needs those, I want someone who will be able to connect with Harry. He can be a handful, and this is his first pregnancy so he will be scared. It will be a hard thing to go through for him and I want to make sure it’s as easy as possible. What do you have to say to that?”
Draco was sobbing quietly into Harry’s shoulder now, sobbing for his regal father’s lost pride. The man that bowed to no one, that everyone feared, was nothing but a whore to the Dark Lord Voldemort. His whole life had been a lie. Everything he knew and loved and had been taught… it was all a lie! His father was supposed to teach him to be that as well, to be the Dark Lord’s plaything! No! His father had asked Snape to keep him away from all of that. His father really did care. But then, why did he stay behind if he knew that it wasn’t a good thing? He didn’t understand!
,,Draco?" at the familiar voice, Draco turned around to see Pansy and Blaise, standing behind the glass door, which they opened shortly after and Draco wasn't sure how to interpret their looks ,,I really thought Daphne lied when she said, she saw you getting in the train" Blaise looked at him with an unreadable expression and just stood silent beside Pansy ,,Didn't thought you would dare to come back after being such an coward" Draco rolled his eyes. He knew she was still pissed that he broke up with her in fifth year as if she was nothing more than a replaceable doll, he was tired of playing with and it wasn't even that far from the truth. She meant nothing to him and he would surely not allow her to look down on him. He had to show them immediately that just because his family had fallen from grace and he was alone, he was no little boy who wasn't being protected anymore
,,So, what do you think is the reason someone’s been carrying this scales into the forest?“  ,,I wish I knew” ,,Maybe because of gold?“ ,,Could be Harry, could be but why bring it into the forest?“ they came to an stop in front of a big hole, that could easily be overlooked in the dark if you weren’t careful enough. It was right beside a tree, big enough to fit a human easily. When Harry spoke the Lumos charm, no end could be seen. Draco and Harry swallowed visibly and looked nervous at each other, waiting for each to say they would go first.
,,You disappoint me, Rowle“ Draco stood beside his mother, in the far back of the hall. He knew what would happen with the man, that had thrown himself onto the ground and begged for mercy ,,Hasn’t it been you, who had shown the old man what will happen to traitors?“ ,,M-My Lord, I didn’t- I would never betray you“ the man, who was able to silence every room without uttering a word and make every powerful man fall to his knees, stood up from the chair, turning away from Rowle towards the crowd of death eaters that were watching the scene ,,Mr. Rowle seems to have fallen to the illusion that he is not a traitor“ his snake like voice echoed through the dead silent room, the only thing heard was the heavy breathing of Thorfinn ,,You“ he pointed towards one of the death eaters, who couldn’t help but quiver at the attention of the dark lord ,,Yes, My Lord“ ,,What defines a traitor....for me?“ ,,Someone who has shared secrets, questioned your authority or has not given his best to accomplish the mission’s that had been ordered, my Lord“ ,,Ah, very good son, very good“ he turned back around to the man on the ground, a shallow apologetic expression on his face ,,And you, Rowle? Do you think you have done your best?“ ,,M-My Lord, I tried my best, I-“ ,,So, you are not saying you haven’t done your best but that your best....isn’t enough?“ his voice darkened at the end of the sentence and sealed the mans fate ,,I guess it’s only fair to the old man and everyone else here, in this room that you have to suffer for your betrayal“ he almost sounded like he was really sorry to inflict pain upon him but the venom that hide behind the words showed the true nature of his and the satisfaction he felt by demonstrating what would happen to anyone, who fell from his grace. Everyone had only waited for the unforgivable curse to end Thorfinns life but as the whole room got silent, Voldemort turned around with a dangerous glimmer inside his purely evil eyes ,,Draco“ he sighed and in a second, a path had formed between the crowd, showing the pale boy whose heart had began to pound so loud that he believed everyone was able to hear it ,,Snape, has taken an opportunity from you to prove yourself, my son“ the dark Lord, took his rightful place on the head chair and looked right into the 17 year old boy’s eyes. He wanted to stay in Hogwarts when the holiday’s had come closer because he knew, what would await him back at his home. To say he was terrified when his mother told him that he needs to come back would be an understatement but he followed her wish and he would need to pay the price for that now.
“No time. I have to go. Come on Harry,” Blaise said, lifting Harry to his feet. Harry couldn’t hold himself up though, so Blaise threw one of Harry’s arms over his own shoulders and apparated to his own home. “You have to listen to me, Harry,” he said outside his front door. Harry continued crying, although his sobs weren’t as loud as they were inside Malfoy Manor. “Damn it Potter shut up and listen to me for a moment!” Harry stopped sobbing, but continued to sniffle and gasp a little. “I told you you’d have to pretend to be my fiancé for a little while. Do you think you could pretend to be my husband?
So Harry’s answer was to not wear shoes either. Nor trousers nor a shirt. He did wear pants; he couldn’t handle the idea of meeting a stranger without wearing at least pants. They entered the living room to find Snape waiting for them, drinking some tea that turned Draco’s stomach. The man immediately banished it in deference. Silently, he stood and led them to the same room off the Great Hall where the Champions from the Tri-Wizard Tournament had been taken three years ago.
Most days Snape would enter his rooms to see Harry and Draco cuddling on the couch together. The first few times pissed him off to no end, but he knew it was going to happen whether he liked it or not. He drew the line at snogging however. The day he walked in to see them making out on his couch, he blew up at them and sent them to their room if they were going to “partake in such carnal acts”. Harry silently made the joke that Snape was jealous because he hadn’t been laid in so long.
“Don’t interrupt; it’s rude. As I was saying. I know you two have a history that’s volatile. You have to put that behind you and at least be civilized and courteous to him.”
“Draco’s in labor? Why didn’t you activate the bracelets, you stupid child?!” He moved to rush toward their bedroom.
“I, Harry James Potter, in the name of the spirit of Merlin that resides within us all, by the life that courses within my blood and the love that resides within my heart, take thee, Draco Lucius Malfoy, to my hand, my heart, and my spirit, to be my chosen one. To desire thee and be desired by thee, to possess thee, and be possessed by thee, without sin or shame, for naught can exist in the purity of my love for thee. I promise to love thee wholly and completely without restraint, in sickness and in health, in plenty and in poverty, in life and beyond, where we shall meet, remember, and love again. I shall not seek to change thee in any way. I shall respect thee, thy beliefs, thy people, and thy ways as I respect myself.”
Harry rolled over suddenly and looked at Draco in shock. “Then why...?” He took in the things Draco was holding in his arms. Flowers, candy, and alcohol. Harry knew he was a sap, but he didn't know that Draco knew him that well. Okay, that's a lie too. After five years, he had expected Draco to know him that well. And he was upset when Draco hadn't even mentioned his birthday.
“It’s okay, Harry,” he soothed. “It will be okay. I know where he lives. Come on. We can go, right now, to his house and talk to him. We need to get this cleared up and quickly. Come on, I can apparate.” Blaise pulled a shocked Harry along behind him and apparated to Malfoy Manor. He knocked on the door and was greeted by Mrs. Malfoy. “Hello Narcissa,” Blaise began. “May we come in?”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Harry cut him off with a long, hard kiss. After a few moments, he pulled away and began signing. Draco was still crying, but he seemed to be calming down some. Harry continued signing for a long time, trying to comfort his lover. Pomfrey packed up her belongings and left the room without either of them noticing because they were so wrapped up in one another. When Harry was done signing, he bent down and wiped the tears from Draco’s face before kissing him. He signed a few more things and Draco’s face lit up. He smiled big and started bouncing lightly in his seat. Snape looked on, confused. Then, Draco threw himself at Harry to give him a big hug.
“No my–” His words were cut off as he writhed in agony. But he didn’t make a sound. There were three Death Eaters who had learned how to not scream as they were being tortured, and he was one of them. Because of this, the length he was left under the curse was always debated. It could be long because Voldemort would be pissed that he wasn’t screaming. It could be short because the Dark Lord was growing tired of not hearing the screams. It could be a normal time just because he was feeling like it.
He snapped back to the present with a flinch, reaching his magic out to get information from what was around him. He hadn’t spaced out from his surroundings since before The Detention. Around him was nothing, really. He and Draco were sitting in their bedroom; they had been talking about the baby and the pregnancy when Harry tuned out and started thinking about the previous night. That brought them back to Draco staring at him with a confused expression.
Death Eaters were rounded up and sent to cells within the bowels of the Ministry. Each would have a fair trial, unlike Sirius. Memories of the battle were collected from several people as evidence of the guilt of each Death Eater. Harry was somewhat proud that Molly had dispatched Bellatrix during the battle. Apparently, a mama basilisk was no joke. Bellatrix had gone after Ginny and Molly was having none of that. The twins were also ferocious in battle, using their jokes to distract and cause mayhem while altering many of their other products to go on the offensive. Kindhearted Remus proved why he had been qualified as the DADA professor; Minerva showed her dueling skills.
Doing as told, Lucius Malfoy stepped forward and kissed the hem of his master’s robe once more. “Yes, my Lord?”
“I don't think so, Mr. Potter. What did you do to Lucius? What happened? Why were you thrust away from him? Where is his Dark Mark?” Snape demanded answers.
While Madam Pomfrey and Granger became more and more flustered every day that Harry slept on, Draco was confident that everything would be fine in the end. The stress of the five months in the Forest, then one month back at Hogwarts, had taken its toll on Harry. His whole existence had been put toward keeping Draco safe from every possible harm, scratch, and emotional toil that could come upon him in the Forest and at Hogwarts. He’d done a wonderful job of it too. Any time Draco tried to give him a break or take over for a few hours, Harry would hear none of it. He’d spent days on end awake and aware, ever watchful. It had saved them plenty of times in the Forest, these abilities he had.
Severus nodded, motioning for the two to precede him into his private office. He turned just before entering the room himself and sneered at his classroom. “Not a word. Get to work on the potion on page 351. I want the base completed by the end of class. Get to it!” The room burst into motion as Severus snapped the door shut behind him. “Where have you two been? How is it that you can be missing for more than half the school year, and then show up fine as you please? What in the bloody hell is going on here?!”
The elf jumped off of her stool in the corner and rushed toward the pool/bath Draco was in. “Yes, Master Draco, sir?”
Harry nodded his head and Poppy was off to get the Quill and some parchment. “Okay, just touch it so it can read your magical signature. Very good. Now then, I have some questions about your time away from Hogwarts. How did Draco get pregnant?”
When Harry seemed satisfied by his findings, he began to rub Draco’s back with one hand while supporting him a bit with the other hand on his stomach. He felt the baby kick against him them, always more active once they had been too. The first time, it had scared Harry. He’d thought he’d hurt the baby. He’d called Madam Pomfrey by force of will and magic. She merely tutted and explained, once again, that sex was perfectly fine, and the baby was sure to react but wouldn’t be harmed. Draco would know if the baby were in distress.
Harry nodded. Then lifted one hand palm up and conjured a fireball. He shrugged as if to say ‘It’s easy.’.
Snape rolled his eyes and finished his tea. Now they just had to get the damn thing in motion before Draco changed his mind about the whole affair.
“That sounds like a plan to me. But, until then… Can you do that thing with your tongue again?” he asked, hopeful. So near their due date, Harry was nearly adamant about no penetrative sexual activities. But, honestly, it was Draco’s body and he was horny, damn it!
“Lucius! Mr. Weasley! You will both calm yourselves or you will both leave!” Pomfrey yelled. “Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, all will be explained in due time. The only thing that matters at this time is Mr. Potter-Malfoy’s life. And that seems to be in jeopardy. Miss Granger, in that room to the left of the main entrance is Professor Snape’s guest loo. Please get me the lemon yellow and lavender purple potions from above the sink. Thank-you. Mr. Weasley, do as you are told. Help Mr. Potter-Malfoy onto the bed behind me. He needs to sit. His father can attend to him from there. Albus, will you help me transplant a bit of magic into Mr. Potter-Malfoy here to get him going again?”
Draco was silently sobbing, tears running down his face unchecked. “Corvus Armand Potter-Malfoy,” he announced in a whisper. “You made it. You’re here. My beautiful boy, you’re here. Harry! Look at our son!” He carefully turned the baby’s head so he could look at his father.
“Severus, help! Please help! For Merlin’s sake, help! Severus!” the potions’ master suddenly cried out. “Oh, Harry. I’m so sorry. I couldn’t hold on any longer. But help is coming, I swear it. Help! Please help! Hold on, Harry. It will be okay. I promise. Nothing can harm you here. Severus! Help!”
“My mum and Molly Weasley would have to get together to plan everything out. Between our money, nothing would be second best. We’d have engraved invitations, tablecloths, cloth napkins with holders, all the proper cutlery, at least five courses for the main meal, an eight-tiered cake, flowers at every table. You and I would be sitting at the head table with our parents, the Weasleys for you, sitting beside us. I guess Dumbledore could officiate again, allowing us to renew our vows instead of actually getting married.
Draco started to get up out of bed and pulled Harry with him, fixing his boxer briefs back so they covered his bits properly again. “Put some shorts on. You’ll see when we get down there.” Soon, both were properly covered and in the kitchen. Draco reached to the top cabinet where they kept their wine, which Harry never selected, and pulled down a small, wrapped gift with a gold bow on top. “Here you go.”
“You know that feeling you’re having? Act on it. Do something that makes it go away. That’s pushing.”
Snape, too, was sporting a blush. “Understandable,” he murmured. “But I really cannot stand the idea of seeing either of you naked again. Please, for the love of Merlin, keep it to your rooms.”
“I was asked to come here because of my work in this field. I have only been working with male pregnancies for the last four years, but the work I have done has been my life. I have always gotten along well enough with my patients and have always offered the best care. Anything you or your husband want, I will try my hardest to get.”
“Shut it, Weasley! You know Potter's a queer as a two-knut coin!” an Auror co-worker called out, causing most everyone in the room to burst into raucous laughter. Then the music started, people started to party, and the food and drink began to flow. Dancing, talking with friends, munching on snacks. It was a great party, and it lasted for quite some time.
“You carry ten pounds inside of you and see how small you feel,” Harry shot back playfully. “Can I go back to my room now? I don’t like this table thing.”
!” She threw herself on her best friend when she saw he was awake, aware, and standing. “Oh, how I’ve missed you! Are you okay? How do you feel? Do you need to sit down? How long have you been awake? Are you hungry? Are you hurt? Do you need anything?”
“An annulment has nothing to do with the length of time that you’ve been married, Harry,” Blaise began.
“Father!” Draco shrieked, rushing to the door and wrenching it open. “We can hear you in here! And Harry
Harry’s eyes were on his fingers absentmindedly playing with Draco’s hair. He didn’t want his friends to see him differently, didn’t want anyone to be afraid of him. He was just an eighteen-year-old kid with a husband and a baby on the way. And, okay, he was blind and mute too. But still normal!
Dumbledore began to speak. “We have come together here in celebration of the joining together of Draco and Harry. There are many things to say about marriage. Much wisdom concerning the joining together of two souls, has come our way through all paths of belief, and from many cultures. With each union, more knowledge is gained and more wisdom gathered. Though we are unable to give all this knowledge to these two, who stand before us, we can hope to leave with them the knowledge of love and its strengths and the anticipation of the wisdom that comes with time. The law of life is love unto all beings. Without love, life is nothing; without love, death has no redemption. Love is anterior to Life, posterior to Death, initial of Creation and the exponent of Earth. If we learn no more in life, let it be this.
He didn’t even notice Snape entering the living room. The older man knew better than to say or do anything, however. To make any noise would cause Harry to strike out. Instead, he merely watched the youth – no, a man now. Seventeen years old, married, a child on the way, Head of two Houses. This was a man by all accounts. And a powerful one at that. He needed to talk to Albus soon about their plans. Probably because he was searching for Potter (Potter-Malfoy) himself, the Dark Lord didn’t hold his annual end-of-year attack. There was no Potter (Potter-Malfoy) to attack, after all.
While Molly snapped a picture of the cute moment, Narcissa was timing the contractions. “That one was six minutes since the last one,” she told the mediwitch.
“Of course. It is ill-becoming a pureblood to do otherwise,” Snape sneered. “Draco also wishes a few decorations… in the Great Hall. Will the proper warding be manageable? It will have to be after the other students have gone on to bed, of course, but Draco says he is tired of being confined in my chambers. I told Potter to curb Draco’s enthusiasm before I left. He might have succeeded…”
There was silence in the office for a few moments while the five adults looked back and forth between the two Gryffindors. Moody finally cleared his throat and spoke. “You two are too smart for your own good.”
“Blaise, how many men have you had sex with?” Blaise only mumbled something. “I’m sorry Blaise, but the quill didn’t get that. How many?”
“Not there, idiot boy! To the infirmary! There is someone there needing this.” He tried to shove past them, but Potter, Potter-
“Because this is my job. I am a specialist in male pregnancies. This is a case of male pregnancy. Therefore, it is my job to be here if you so wish me to.”
. Now then, how to kill you? Professor Snape? You wouldn’t happen to have that potion on you, would you? You see Tom,” he began, “Snape is a spy in your ranks. He’s been spying on you for me. And Draco too, kind of, since he’s not official. We came up with a potion that will bind your soul to your body so I can kill you and you won’t come back. Thank you professor.”
They left the house and went to Harry's favourite restaurant. They had a great meal, great company, great service. Draco didn't tell anyone it was Harry's birthday, so they didn't make a scene. In fact, when he'd made the hasty reservation earlier, he'd told them to expressly ignore the fact that it was Harry's birthday or else. It was a wonderful dinner in which Harry truly enjoyed himself. As they headed home, the talisman in Draco's pocket heated up to tell him things were ready at his house.
“I’ll ask Theresa.” Blaise left to ask Theresa if Harry could move around. When he came back, he started helping Harry up. “As long as it’s slow and easy, she says. And no moving about until tomorrow. Conjure anything and everything you need until then.” Harry nodded and slowly made his way down the hall to his room with Blaise’s help. “Is there anything you need while I’m here?” Harry shook his head. “Do you want me to stay?” Again, Harry shook his head. “You know where my room is. Call Kipper if you need her.” Blaise walked out, taking one last look before he closed the door behind him.
do something to upset you so? You don’t even talk to me the one night a week you leave your rooms!” Harry sat back down, knowing he wasn’t going to be able to leave just yet, and began rocking McKay slowly against his shoulder. “Damn it Harry, you’re worrying me! I am concerned for you and McKay. Did I do something wrong? Can I fix whatever it is that’s going on with you right now?”
“Thank you Blaise.” Harry hugged Blaise and then went to get some more ham. After two pieces, he turned to the doctors. “I have made my decision. The other three will have their memories wiped of this experience so nothing will come of it. Do you all agree to these terms?” The four doctors nodded. “I believe that Dr. Rhodes would be best suited for myself, and I thank you all for coming today. Please, follow Blaise to the door so that he may erase your memories. Dr. Rhodes, if you would follow me please.”
“But I did, Harry,” Draco said with a smile. “See, you got very upset when one of our co-workers suggested that you were unmanly and therefore the bottom in our bedroom. So you set them straight. And I, of course, had to come to your aide.”
When it started getting harder to see Draco, Harry ran after him. “We shouldn’t separate,” he offered as an explanation when he caught up. They walked, heading out the way they came. Except that after ten minutes they weren’t at the edge of the forest. “Surely we weren’t that far in?” he asked.
,,Can’t I be at least once freed from your existence?!“ Draco said hateful and Harry rolled his eyes at the unchanged behavior of the boy who had tried for years to make his life in Hogwarts a living hell ,,It’s not like I’m a fan of yours either“ he muttered but Draco had heard him and gave him a cold glare ,,Why don’t you just freaking leave me alone for once Potter and go, don’t know, save the world or whatever the great Harry Potter does in his free time“ ,,Leave you alone? I think your memory isn’t the best anymore because it’s been you, who wasn’t leaving me alone!“ ,,Yeah because you are so annoying that it was hard to ignore your constant play of how special you are!“ ,,I never di-“ Harry stopped himself and sighed tired. Not that Draco cared much but he could see that he wasn’t the only who wasn’t sleeping much. The bags under Harry’s eyes were quite visible and his eyes looked almost empty, as if all life had been taken away from dementors. His hair looked like a bird nest and his usual skinny but build features were now only skinny, matching his low spirit.
a sudden noise from the narrow path startled the two boys and when they turned around, all they saw was the eyes of a creature that was definitely not a Niffler before the earth around them started vibrating and the way out collapsed ,,NO!“ they both sprint towards the hole but to no use. the hole was no filled up with earth, blocking the only way out
,,I am never ever going back into this god damn cursed forest! Should they throw me out, I don’t care!“ when he turned around, he got distracted from his anger as he saw the distraught look on his rival’s face. Harry stood frozen in one place, his eyes fixated on the ground ,,What, Potter? Not like we’re gonna die down here“ Draco said, annoyed. How could that guy be in fear right now? He fought against the darkest wizard of history and had escaped death more than any other but he was paralyzed by fear now?. Harry didn’t react to his words but retreated slowly backwards until his back hit a wall and he slide down to the ground. ,,What the bloody hell is going on with you, Potter?“ Harry swallowed heavily, really not liking the fact that it had to be Draco to see him like this ,,I....I really don’t like small spaces“ The soften of his expression went unnoticed by Draco himself and he sighed heavily. How were they gonna get out of here?
The students starting running in every direction and Draco who had been still standing on his spot felt a hand grabbing his own and dragging him away from the field, the charm that held Blaise in place disappearing. Astoria used her wand to make the trees bend so they could run through the small forest without needing to be careful not to trip over something or crash against a tree. After a long minute of running they came to an stop, their heavy breathing the only sound heard in the dark ,,That was close“ said Astoria grinning in between breaths and pushed her messy hair out of her face ,,I guess we should wait a bit before going back“ she sat down on one of the many roots of a tree that had grown their way out to the surface and leaned against the tree. ,,That was quite a scene there“ she said, gesturing towards the Quidditch field that laid somewhere behind the trees, now out of sight ,,You really got no mercy in you,huh?“ ,,What do you mean?“ Draco finally spoke, his voice cold as he took a seat beside her ,,I mean, you did not only defeated him but you humiliated him“ ,,So? It was him, who started it“ ,,Oh and that’s all that little brain of yours can do. He started it and because of that, he deserved everything thrown his way?“ ,,Actually no, he deserved it because he dared to provoke a Malfoy and by the way, ’that little brain of yours‘ ? Was that supposed to be an insult?“ ,,You guys and your awful name you take so much pride in“ ,,You’re just jealous!“ spatted Draco back and Astoria scoffed ,,Jealous of what? Being a dick, who thinks just because he has a famous name, he’s more worth than others. No, thanks!“ somehow did she knew she was crossing a line but honestly, she couldn’t care less. She was so fed up with those opinions she had been confronted with her whole life. Draco got up from the ground and even though, the light from his wand was only enough to lighten up the spot where he stood, she could see the anger in his facial expression ,,I’m not...I-“ confusion mixed into his feelings and he groaned out of frustration ,,You just don’t know what you are talking about!“ she laughed shallow and got up from the ground as well, almost matching the male's height ,,I guess you didn’t recognize me but I’m a Greengrass“ ,,What?“ ,,I am Daphne’s younger sister“
,,Last year was very...straining for everyone“ her face filled with sorrow ,,And I would appreciate it, if you could consider the events the students had to endure, when someone does or say something that might  be over the line“ she wasn’t exactly asking him to endure if someone bullied him but more asking him to not explode like he used to every time someone said something that could be remotely insulting towards him. A part of him felt angry about it. Why should he suffer, just so that others wouldn't? He nod as an answer and McGonagall looked at him, the strict stare gone and a tired expression of her face, showing the many years she had already lived ,,Mr. Malfoy, I know-“ she started, unsure about how far she could go ,,-it has also been not an very easy year for you“ Draco stayed quiet, knowing that not easy was an understatement but he wouldn't dare to let anyone know just how terrifying and lonely the last months had been
He smirked and played with Zabinis wand in his hand as he took slowly steps towards his opponent, who was getting up from the ground but Draco used the incorio spell and he was being pressed down to the ground again. He crouched down in front of him and hold out his wand, for him to take knowing that Zabini couldn’t move, with the charm holding him down. He laid his wand beside him on the ground, sighing as if he was terribly sorry for the embarrassment.  ,,Take that Crown, be the bloodiest king out here. I don’t care“ Draco shortened the distance between them a bit more and whispered in a not so quiet voice ,,But I swear to you, if you dare to bother me again, I’m gonna make you regret that you didn’t kill me in the forbidden forest“ Draco put his wand back into his inner pocket of his black suit and sighed happily ,,Well then, sorry for the bad show guys“ he said, smiling at the crowd, dusting his jacket. Their faces showed very clearly how disappointed they were that it wasn’t Draco, who was covered in mud and laid on the ground in defeat. ,,Well, then-“ his words were interrupted when a 5th year student came running down the hill, warning them that Professor Flitwick had seen the red light and that he and Mr. Crowly were on their way.
,,Well then, let’s begin the class now. I would li-“ he stopped and looked around, seemingly searched for a face ,,I see, there is one of you missing“ he spoke out loud and everyone turned around, trying to find out who it was that was missing ,,Has anyone of you seen Mr. Potter?“ Draco looked around, only now realizing that the Gryffindor should’ve been here too. Neville Longbottom cleared his throat and raised his hand ,,Professor, Harry had been not feeling well since the morning and decided to go back to his room“ ,,Ah, I see“ he said and Draco rolled his eyes as he heard the others voicing his worry for the scarhead ,,Harry really didn’t looked well this morning“ ,,Of course he wouldn’t, stupid-“ ,,Don’t call me that!“ ,,-I mean no one is okay here and he lost a great deal of people“ ,,And he fought against, you know“ jealousy didn’t suit Draco well, he knew that but he couldn’t stop the feeling from emerging from his inside. All everyone always seemed to care about was Mr. Harry Potter, who was now no longer only the boy who lived but also the one who saved the whole wizarding world. If they hadn’t worshiped him before, they surely did now and Draco hated it to his bones. That boy had always taken all the attention, leaving Draco in need of drastic actions to get people to look at him too.
When he climbed the stairs, he ignored the looks and went inside his bedroom, that he had left a year ago with all his unnecessary belongings behind. Of course the room was cleaned out and his belongings had been sent to his home a while ago but the picture of Blaise and him was still standing on his nightstand. He wondered who let it stay there. Now that they were no longer friends, he didn't knew how the room sharing would turn out. All his friendships might've been shallow but that didn't meant, he liked to be alone more.
,,No thank you for saving your life?“ she said, breaking the eye contact and continuing the way up towards the school ,,I didn’t need your help“ ,,Yeah, right“ she said, rolling her eyes lightly, which earned her a cold look from Draco  ,,We should hurry back before Flinch or his cat sees us“ without another exchange of words, they walked towards the nearest entrance and sneaked through the corridors, hoping that the grant staircase wouldn’t give their presence away. The castle was quite, only light snoring from the people inside the pictures could be heard now and then and they were definitely just as annoyed as Draco had been, when his peaceful sleep was interrupted. One or two hissed angry at them but thankfully made no other sound that could wake one of the teachers or prefects.
McGonagall was now headmaster of Hogwarts after the passing of one of the most powerful wizards in the wizarding history and after his trail, she just nod at him and told him in her usual strict voice, that she expects him to be in time for the beginning of the new school year. He wasn't sure if he heard her correctly or if she meant it serious but it's been over a month since an owl came flying into his open window to give him a letter, in which he would find the list of books needed for the 8th year. He wondered if anyone knew that he would be coming back or if they thought that he might've transferred to Durmstrang, which he really considered but decided it was a bad idea to go to a school that teached dark arts when he was trying to free himself from the suspicions that he was still loyal to the dark lord.
,,I’m not a good person“ he finally said with a shaky voice ,,And I never wanted to be one“ he stood up, taking a step forwards, gazing into the sky that was covered in clouds. She wondered if he really believed that.
I've been wanting to write this fanfiction for a while now but never found the time or motivation for it but it has finally happened! YEY! :D
,,We found the one you were searching for“ he said, grinning as he took a step to the side and revealed a face that Draco recognized immediately. Luna Lovegood, a Ravenclaw he had seen often walk around barefoot and in search of something. Crabbe, Goyle and him had once found her outside in the snow, peacefully watching a bird in the tree and decided it would be funny to throw a snowball at the bird just to see her reaction. As the tears began to fall they had only laughed at her and called her a crybaby because the bird wasn’t even hurt. Now the look on her face was one of fear, one where the spark that had always been in her eyes had gone. Draco remembered how much he hated that spark and wished for it to be gone but now as it seemed to have lost it’s shining grace, he was filled with shame. Bellatrix grinned maliciously and ordered the snatchers to lock her away to the old man downstairs. Even though there were many scary figures around her, Luna’s eyes were set onto Draco’s, who had long ago lowered his head and starred down at the carpet. He just couldn't look at her and see this eyes, begging him to help her. As the snatchers had gotten their reward and left and Draco had wanted nothing more than run back to his room and hide away from it all, he appeared. The one everyone waited for and as soon as he apparated into the room, they all bowed down deeply. Draco was frozen and his mother used her wand to make him bow down. If he thought he had known what fear and panic felt like before, he surely knew now how wrong he was. A cold shudder run through his whole body and he tried his best to steady his legs, that seemed to want to give up in this very moment. He had not seen much of his face but it didn’t matter because his whole presence radiated a dark energy that would make every serial killer look like a sweet child.
,,Shrinking potion, great“ Draco said when the object that would guarantee their safety return turned out to be not that safe.
,,1.....2.....3!“ a small red light shot out of her wand into the sky and Blaise had already casted his first spell, almost hitting Draco who had jumped to the side in time. He collected himself fast and hit Blaise with a stunning spell, who flew through the air and crashed harshly against the cold earth. ,,Didn’t I tell you“ Draco shouted smirking. ,,Defodio“ Blaise said before he had completely gotten up from the ground and the earth beside him started vibrating until a hundred little stones were flying through the air, right towards Draco who in time casted a Protego and let a few stones be redirected to their owner, who only got hurt slightly before he used a Protego spell himself. They continued throwing spells at each other and dodging most of them, the crowd now and then cheering when Draco crashed onto the ground or into the wall. ,,Just give up Malfoy, you lost your place already long ago!“ ,,Protego! Do you think I care?“ ,,Bombarda!“ the ground underneath Draco exploded and he was thrown against the wall, feeling the metal ripping his skin open ,,You should because I won’t let a coward like you ever take that crown again. You don’t deserve it!“ Draco crouched down, to avoid getting hit by the stunner spell of Blaise and threw one at him himself ,,Oh Blaise, you can take that crown and wear it as long as you want to. Stupefy!“ the confusion got the best of the male and he was thrown to the ground once more. He grabbed his wand but Draco spoke the Expelliarmus spell, disarming Blaise whose wand landed in the blonde's hand.
,,My Lord, I can do it“ Narcissa spoke but the cold man shook his head lightly ,,Seems like, there are many people who wanna stop you from taking their place in the spotlight but don’t worry boy, this is your time“ the fear in the boys eyes was so clearly brought to the surface that no one would be able to miss it, not even a man who had long ago forgotten what it’s like to feel. Draco moved forward hesitantly until he was right in front of Rowle, who had eyed him from beneath but there was no evil seen in the eyes that had tortured and murdered mercilessly. It all had been drowned out by the terrifying realization that the chance of him, leaving this room was just as low as the chance of Draco coming out alive of this if he would dare to not follow the orders of the dark lord
He really didn’t felt like going back to his room now and made his way to the Astronomy tower. He really needed a switch of rooms. This wasn’t going to workout. Draco used a silencing spell, so that the door would fall into it’s lock soundlessly and walked over to the open railing that allowed a heavenly sight in daylight. Now, there wasn’t much to see but the outlines of the castle and the night sky, that was mostly covered in clouds. He had to admit that going back to this place, left a bitter taste on his tongue but apart from the old bathroom, this had always been the only place to help him feel calm but it was also the place, where an innocent man had died not too long ago. A man, whose death was his fault. He wasn’t sure if going to the Astronomy Tower was really him trying to find an escape or him trying to punish himself. He let his head fall against the column on his right side and sighed tiredly, the pain in his back from the fight only now noticed by his consciousness. He moved his hand through his white hair and closed his eyes for a moment. It was his second night in the new school year and both had been more turbulent than they should’ve been. He wondered if it would ever be possible for his life to go back the way it used to be in his first year. At that time, his parents had still protected him from the dark world they both lived in, to an extent, where Draco didn’t had to worry about anything else than, trying to get his grades up so that his parents would be proud. It hadn’t been a very pleasant time too but it was still so much better than what had begun to be his life in his 3rd year, when his father believed he was old enough to hold the responsibility that came with knowing what they had been trying to achieve the last years. Looking back now, Draco couldn’t tell what he had felt when he first found out. Pride, because his father trusted him enough? He was taught to believe, that becoming one of Voldemorts allies was something to feel good about but what did he feel? He sighed frustrated and let his body slide down to the ground slowly, becoming more and more exhausted from the storm inside his head. He really understood what his father meant by saying that emotions were a distraction. Right now, Draco just wished for them to leave him alone, so that he could have a minute of peace.
,,Of course, the hero Potter gets a special treatment because he is so much better than everyone else“ ,,I don’t think it’s me that believes to be better than others“ Draco gave him a glare, that if looks could kill Harry would’ve definitely died on the spot. ,,Just don’t get in my way!“ was the last thing Draco said before he stormed off, not longer wanting to bear with the others presence right beside him. Why couldn’t Potter just leave him alone? Why was it that he was always confronted with him, no matter where he went.
The next days went by a lot more calm and except the awful afternoon’s he had to spent with Harry, he slowly got used to being back in Hogwarts and actually started enjoying his chats with Astoria, who seemed completely unfazed by the looks she got from the others. She didn’t seem to care much about his unfriendly behavior and continued talking even if he had already stopped participating a while ago. Everyday, he would find new aspects of her features that seemed weirdly perfect to him. She was really pretty, her skin pale and clean. Piercing emerald green eyes, full lips and a small nose that fitted perfectly into her doll-like appearance. He doubted she had a boyfriend, as she spent quite a lot of time with him and never saw someone beside her but he knew the boys were probably all crazy for her, just like they all had been for Daphne. Imperfection did not seem to exist in the Greengrass family, at least based on their looks.
,,And for that, others had to pay the price“ ,,You....you believe their deaths are your fault?“ the noticeable confusion in her voice made him turn around and look at her with an unreadable expression but before she was able to continue, their conversation was interrupted by Professor Crowly, who instructed them to go back to their common room as the curfew was getting close. Considering that Draco probably did not wanted to talk about this in front of a teacher, she decided to drop the topic for now and followed the professor back to the castle, where Draco had said goodbye to her in a timid manner but smiled nonetheless, which she found to be an improvement. Maybe this could really work.
,,No rules!“ Blaise said and smirked, knowing that Draco had no choice but to agree, which he did without hesitation.
He knew he would get into trouble if he missed class on the first day but he would gladly accept every punishment before he would let anyone see what he has been hiding underneath his cold and arrogant stare. He waited a little longer until he was once again alone in the bathroom and came out of the stall and moved towards the sink. He looked into the mirror and was ashamed at the sight. He looked so pathetic, so weak. His usual pale skin, was now the color of the snow which was a heavy contrast to his red, swollen eyes. He took a few more minutes to calm himself down and get a little color back onto his face before he left the bathroom and hurried to his next class.
He opened the heavy door that lead to the upper long floor that was openly connected to the dinning room beneath. Draco can't remembered how many times he had jumped over the railing, onto his broomstick and flew downstairs and just how many times his father had scolded him for his childish behavior. He turned right for a moment, where his parents bedroom and a bunch of other rooms laid and sighed heavly before taking the stairs downstairs. He didn't knew what to feel. It has been almost exactly 6 months since the day, the second wizarding war had ended through the hands of a 17 year old boy and it had been 4 months since his father was sentenced to a life in Azkaban and his mother for 4 years. He knew that would be the outcome after it was clear that Voldemort would no longer be able to claim his throne on top of the world but they were still his parents and now he was completely alone. There was no one around him anymore. No friends, not that he ever had friends. Those who he called friends had been nothing more than loyal to his status and name and now that both had been dirtied by the press and the revealing of the horrible things his parents had done under the name of Voldemort, everyone turned his back on him. He had no family anymore, most of them had been caught by the ministry and brought to Azkaban or died in the war and those who still were free, were on the run, not caring at all about a boy who had just lost everything.
He wasn't sure if it was a good idea to go to Fred Weasly's funeral, so he hid away, witnessing the ceremony from far away and waited until everyone had left. He still remembered the feeling as he got closer and closer to the cold headstone. He felt like vomiting. Those were the moments of realization. The ones where he fully understood the extent of damage his actions had caused. He still remembered the way his legs gave up and he fell to his knees, crying hard enough that his vision blurred, apologizing over and over. He knew it was too late. No matter how much he apologized, the weasly twins would never come in a double pack again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasly would forever still put an extra plate on the table that would always be left untouched. 50. The number of people who have died in the war and Draco was at fault. How could he ever live with that? Maybe that was the only good cause his upbringing brought. He was able to shut down all those emotions, whenever they felt too much, like they were about to tear him apart from the inside and leave him in shreds.
,,Good morning Mr. Malfoy“ McGonagall said, looking down on her desk where she just finished writing a letter before she looked up at the boy with her typical strict stare and put her reading glasses aside ,,Good morning“ he greeted shallow back and took the seat in front of the big old desk, his hand fidgeting awkwardly. He was so used to his own cocky behavior, that aside from that, he never knew how to behave ,,I won’t make this long but we need to talk about a few things“ Draco looked up at her, fear written in his face that she had found out about last night ,,As this year is supposed to be a new start for many students, I want this year to be calm and I do need to let you know, that I will keep a close watch on your behavior. I do not want to hear of any bullying or that sort of things while you are staying here“ Draco wasn’t surprised but still a little hurt that she really thought that after all that happened, he would still be doing meaningless things like bullying but he guessed he had never gave anyone a reason to believe he had something else to offer.
,,I will also have my office, always open for any student that needs a listening ear, at any time. So please do not feel like you are alone with what you are going through. In times like this, friendships are dearly need, so please reach out to someone“ the silence was broken by a sudden sob and everyone turned around to the back of the class, where Susan Bone had been sitting in silence until she could no longer keep her composure. Her friend, Riley beside her patted her in a comforting way and asked if they both could leave the class for a moment at which Tregolor only nodded understanding and told Susan to come by his office later. There it was again. The guilt trying to come back because he knew, he was the cause for all this pain but he swallowed it back down and decided to concentrate on the illustration of a werewolf  that filled the front page of his new bought book.
,,Silence, please!" McGonagall's voice echoed through the hall and everyone went quiet. The next ten minutes were spent listening to her encouraging speech about how the event of last year had changed a lot of things and how we should not let our fears get the best our ourselves and for the first time Draco looked around and saw the visible pain in the eyes of his fellow classmates. Very little sparkling eyes were found as they all seemed to remember the horrifying war, where a lot of friends were lost and everything seemed hopeless. A feeling of guilt wanted to creep onto him but he stuffed it back, far into his mind.
Defense against dark arts had only started and everyone was still searching for a place to sit, so no one noticed him coming too late. He took a seat, right beside a blonde girl that didn’t even acknowledge him but he couldn’t care less. He just wanted the lesson to be over, so that he could finally go back to his room to get some peace. He noticed the tall figure, that was standing at the front of the class and smiled lightly at them ,,I am Professor Tregolor and I will be your teacher for defense against dark arts for this year and hopefully the next too“ his hidden remark about the knowing rumor that the position he was currently holding seemed to be cursed , made the students chuckle ,,Before we start this Class, I would like to tell you some things“ he moved to sit down at the edge of his table and tipped his hands against the wood nervous ,,A lot of things have changed and a lot of things are still undergoing that change and after...well the events that took place, the ministry and the school came to a shared decision, that considering the circumstances, it would be the best to make this class a lot more advanced than it ever was supposed to be“ upon the faces of his students at the mention of the war, he felt sorry for bringing it up and reopening the wounds that were trying to heal but it was important that they knew, they were not ignoring anything, not trying to cover up anything
Blaise had always been his closest friend because he needed to know what he was doing. He was different from the rest, Blaise wasn't so afraid of Draco as the others were and therefor he was a danger to his throne. ,,You're gonna regret this" was all Blaise said before he stormed out of the room, almost breaking the door with how hard he slammed it close.
,,Astoria, what the hell are you doing?“ her older sister had stormed their way as soon as she came into the great hall and saw her sister, sitting beside the traitor ,,Eating breakfast?“ she said as if it wasn’t the most obvious thing and Daphne looked between her sister and Draco, unsure of what to say in front of him ,,Can I talk to you for a moment...outside?“ Astoria sighed, showing a slight hint of annoyance before she excused herself and followed her sister outside. Draco was relieved that now, she wouldn’t bother him ever again. At least he told himself that.
“Werewolves, acromantulas, a wild car, centaurs, and various other creatures and things,” Harry interrupted. “Yes, I know. I have been here before. About three or four times actually.”
“I’m having a strange sense of déjà vu,” Harry muttered. Blaise chuckled lightly and Draco looked at him with a confused expression. “When Blaise and I first got married,” a dark look passed over Draco’s face then, “he asked me what I wanted for dinner after waking from being sick because of portkeying to the house in France. I was amazed, thinking all purebloods would simply have a house elf do it for them. But Blaise said that his mum made sure he’d be able to handle all situations. And now you’re saying the same thing. Why do you know how to cook?”
“I know!” Snape hissed, his own arm on fire. “There is nothing to do about that. We have suffered before, and we shall suffer again. It cannot last forever, surely.”
“You, Severus,” Draco answered, using his own hand to lower Harry’s outstretched arm. “Why did you knock? We thought someone was trying to get into your rooms.”
“No, no I’m okay. I just can’t get back to sleep and was wondering if I could stay with you for a bit?”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“They were told that Potter and he were to serve detention in the Forbidden Forest due to a fight during one of their classes. During the detention, they were attacked. Malfoy was taken to the infirmary to recover and Potter was taken away for training. Just recently, my son was told that Malfoy had been taken home to recover and Potter was still away for training. Because he was not there, chaos ensued when younger Slytherins tried to gain an upper hand on their elders.”
going to do?!” she cried. The entire common room focused their attention on Hermione, who was standing and shouting and basically having a panic attack.
Harry signed as he entered the room. He tended to stay out of the women’s way when they were discussing wedding plans.
told Harry it was time to get moving. The interview was in a half hour. Rather than move immediately, he just cuddled a moment longer. The less time Draco had to fret, the less he’d worry. Stress wasn’t good for the baby. So after a few minutes, he waved his hand and cleaned them up. He helped Draco up an doff the bed, then helped him dress. Draco was so mad he didn’t have anything to wear, including shoes. ‘What self-respecting wizard doesn’t wear shoes?!’ he’d wanted to know.
“-sweet Merlin, yes!” Draco called out, coming down Harry’s throat. However, the orgasm made Draco wake up. It took him a moment to realize that there was a lack of warm, sticky come all over his boxer briefs and bits. Still slightly groggy, he lifted the blanket to find the answer to the lack of stickiness and was greeted with the sight of his lover and husband’s heads between his legs. “Oh Merlin, that has got to be the best way to wake me up ever, Babe. Come up here so I can kiss you good morning.”
