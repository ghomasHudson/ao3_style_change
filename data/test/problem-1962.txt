Forgotten was the other man, the loud music, the flickering, bright lights. There was only grey, eyes deep enough for a storm. Curiosity and insecurity fighting with – desire? Draco looked at him as if he wanted this just as much as he did himself, as if the world had stopped spinning for both of them. And Harry knew he had to take this chance right now, he had to take the risk and make it right, crossing borders, entering new territory.
Now it was Draco’s time to blankly stare at the other man unable to react in any other manner. He pulled his eyebrows so far together that they almost met at the top of his head and pushed back his chin making him look rather stupid. This was clearly not a direction he suspected the conversation to go at all.
Interestingly enough, Malfoy had very well established himself as one of the most demanded and successful consultants the Ministry of Magic worked with. Furthermore, he had explicitly refused to directly work for them, stating that he wanted to remain his own boss with nobody to push him around. It had been quite a surprise after the war that he did not try to leave all of his past behind and simply pretend to have moved on. Nor did he strictly follow every old tradition. He decided to go his very own way, as he explained himself to the press, by serving the Ministry as freelancing consultant in an area where they had been lacking expertise for ages as no other wizard actually connected to the Dark Arts would have ever considered working for the government. Sometimes Harry wondered if such a job decision would also be an option for him. It was not that he was unhappy at his office and having someone else to decide for you when you had to work, what times you had to take off and what jobs you should take surely had its upsides…
It was Daphne who got her countenance back together first and managed to grin in Draco’s direction, making it clear they were talking about him right now. A raised eyebrow was the only answer she got but Harry noted in his mind that in fact the other man seemed to be rather curious.
Without stepping a millimetre away, he loosened his grip and looked up into grey eyes and a very reddened face. Draco was painting as well, his hand still resting on Harry’s collar but there was no trace of insecurity left in his gaze. Instead the left side of his mouth twitched upwards into a playful half-smile while he bit down on his lower lip, mumbling to himself “I should listen to Pansy more often” while slowly tracing a line up and down Harry’s upper body with his fingers.
Maybe this was why he had decided to tell Andromeda last. Because she had to know the full truth as well as it would hurt her the most.
“No, no! I am sorry. I don’t think you are a poof! I did not mean to offend you! I was just…well it seemed logical…ugh…I…see I am sorry!”
Admitting something is very hard. For example, being wrong. Harry hated admitting that he was wrong, especially towards Hermione. To be fair, she was not good at winning arguments either! Admitting you are afraid of something is even harder. But Harry had managed to even do that a dozen times when talking to Draco. Admitting to yourself that you have a crush on someone you would have never expected turned out to be the hardest thing out of the three for him.
He grinned at her and nodded while she approvingly pulled on his shirt, checking the fit and assuring him he actually looked great. He also felt great. Dressing good somehow raised his confidence. For once he did not feel lost in a room and knew he would not mind if anyone gave him their full attention. Today he knew he looked fine and not weird or pitiful. He looked like a version of himself that actually knew what he wanted even though he more considered this a test run of this new Harry to see if he liked it.
A picture of a younger Draco probably taken shortly after their graduation flew by. He had pitch black hair in that one. Even though he did not look bad, the colour made him look even paler than usual. Also, he was skinny in that picture. Not that he was heavy today but the Draco on the picture was scrawny and seemed to be very tired. It was replaced by another one, taken a few months later.
His name covered one third of the parchment already, the first letter of his last name spelled unnecessarily huge in the elegant handwriting. For a moment the smirk left his face as he noticed they seemed to be back at last names but he had to admit Draco had any reason to distance himself. Maybe his goal should be to send presents as long as it took to be ‘Harry’ once again.
“Can I kiss you?”, he carefully whispered not capable of looking anywhere else than the handsome face. The dark grey eyes now filled with relief and amusement, framed with long, bright lashes, contrasting with the dark brows, the tiny freckles on the straight nose, a full, soft bottom lip, a mouth currently curled up into a feline smile, slightly higher on the right side. The smell became overwhelming and Harry noticed the hand on his hip moving towards his lower back, caressing it slowly but steadily pulling him in closer.
Weasley rolled his eyes. “It was all right,” he admitted. “But you have fucktons of bad shit to make up for. Literally years of it.”
First Draco takes Potter’s big balls into his right hand and caresses Potter’s pleasantly large cock in his left.
Harry sighed. "I just figured out I'm gay, Draco. I don't know if I can handle much more than sex. But I don't want to use you. I'm supposed to be a good guy, right? So why don't we stop fucking, get to King Greynrushes castle or whatever, and solve this problem, pronto, huh? And then we can worry about what comes next later, okay? I… I'm kind of freaking out here. Just a little."
Draco probably told you, but he left me. He was angry I wrote you, so maybe I shouldn’t, but I meant it when I said I feel connected to you not because of Draco, but because you saved my life. Except, I know you saved my life to save Draco’s, so maybe I’m confused?
“Er,” Harry continued, feeling slightly sheepish. “I’m not actually familiar with those. Position names, I mean.”

Draco felt his sweat drip from under his arms. He couldn’t understand how a person could be freezing cold and burning hot at the same time, and he thought he should probably ask Potter to bring him to the hospital wing.
Potter placed the cups on the table and opened them. “No sugar, eh?” he said. “I’m impressed. I can’t drink coffee without it, though.”
“No, pull himself up to stand. He can do it when he has something to hold onto,” Aunt Andromeda explained. “He’s been waving for weeks now.”
The lift doors creaked and groaned open, and Draco stepped out into the dingy hallway. “Er,” Draco said, “our wards are pretty bad, so don’t worry, you can Apparate from here.”

Harry felt his face heat, but tried for honesty. “I liked the kissing. The cuddling. I like how you are with Teddy. Andromeda. Me. I….” Harry took a deep breath and reached out, blind. He found Draco’s hand and grabbed it.
He went out for a huge, celebratory Roy Alley dinner with a dozen friends and promised himself he was done thinking about Draco.
Harry re-watched the porno he and Draco had recorded the week before. It was his third viewing, and the presentation had lost none of its allure in the repetition. The two of them looked fucking amazing together. He’d already known that, though, having re-adopted the technique of jerking off to Pensieve memories on the nights when he didn’t fall asleep with Draco’s come still fucked deep into his arse.
He lied without the slightest hesitation. “I don’t stare at you!” he declared, his imaginary crown perched high again.
“So,” Harry said in the morning, after they’d fooled around under the shower, dried each other, dressed and headed to the kitchen. “Boyfriends.”
“Flattery will get you nearly anything, Potter,” Draco said. He smiled, again feeling able to discuss intimate concerns. “Let’s talk over the substance of this. We both want to live together, but neither wants to move.”
Malfoy turned suddenly and shot Harry a look of confusion. Then he looked back at the water and steered slowly around a large tree branch that was rotting on the bed of the lake. "That's a good one," he finally conceded.
Grandfather Abraxas, though, was asleep. Draco sighed. He’d exhausted his Grandfather’s portrait. The image would likely sleep for a week; maybe more. Draco couldn’t postpone this decision anywhere near that long. If he was to leave Hogwarts and enroll in correspondence courses he needed to do it within two, three days.
The Saturday that should have been London Pride found Harry and Draco in Soho Square, on a knitted rainbow blanket that Draco had paid Mrs Kishar to knit for him. (Well, he’d paid her to knit him one rainbow-striped placemat and then he’d magicked the thing much larger. Yarn was expensive, charms were not.)
“Still nothing?” Harry said, as Draco checked the surveillance spells for the third time that morning.
Draco smiled to himself. Portraits rarely had anything of the sort, of course. But his aunt was right about Mother.
“Finnegan,” Draco says to the next Guard. He takes Seamus’ erection in hand and squeezes it. He watches it jerk and leak in his hand.
The weather was perfect and Hogsmeade with Neville was great fun. They laughed over butterbeers at the Three Broomsticks with a table full of Gryffindors, wandered through Honeydukes with Dean and Ginny, and eventually headed over to meet Ron and Hermione for dinner at Spoons, a new inn with a restaurant. Once Ron and Hermione Flooed in, the hostess led them to a large table in the center of the restaurant where they could be seen from anywhere in the room. Sitting there eating pasta, Harry laughed at Neville’s jokes, and decided he enjoyed having a tall bloke’s arm around his shoulder.
sleep would be peaceful and comfortable, but not so for the slave. The person who first applied the potion would find it soothing and pleasant, but the second person involved would find that the salve was actually irritating. First the Master's fucking motions, and then the Master's sperm would mask this effect, but as the Master slept and his cock expanded within him or her, the slave's delicate membranes would become slightly irritated, then more irritated, and finally the slave would be completely unable to sleep, no matter how tired.
The next day, hoping for distractions, Harry went to Professor Harnithan, who loved all Harry’s ideas. Soon Harry was running two clubs: basic and advanced, and running two study groups, as well. He learned he still loved teaching, but even better was the way he could once again reliably fall asleep every night without feeling a need to masturbate first.
“Thanks,” Draco whined, dropping his head forward, onto the tree. He canted his arse higher. Harry found this made it even easier to fuck him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Malfoy smiled broadly. "Yes Ma'am. That is exactly the ring we seek. Severus Snape, plus Lily Evans. Can you help us find it?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Finally Harry stopped to survey his threads. Some pulsed, some hummed, others flowed. Many curved delicately away from Harry, as though avoiding body heat, or magic. Others bowed
Harry noted it, but also saw tightness in Draco’s shoulders, the fist shoved in his pocket, the flush of his cheeks contrasting the pallor washing over the rest of his face. It was striking alongside his relaxed stance, half-open arms, smiling mouth.
"Yes, you really ought to fuck her arse, too. Assuming you want her tattoo in the same place, that is. With the caveat that you need to be inside the recipient's body, the closer your penis is to the tattoo, the better. If you wanted it on her tits, for example, you'd want to be in her throat."
The rumours of Harry actually staying at Hogwarts after they graduation had spread so quickly Headmaster Minerva McGonagall had decided to take matters in her own hands. She decided to go for a tactic which had always worked in the past: tea and a light conversation started, followed by the hard truth directly into someone’s face.
“I have never been in a situation where as much as I wanted to get into someone’s pants, I also really want to get to know them. So, can I just maybe stay over night and we try to take things slowly as we kind of started dating just now and then see if you indeed want to have something more with me in any kind of relationship manner and not only because of the physical stuff? If that is ok with you?”
With a sort of bow, waving his hand as if he were an artist waiting for applause, the blond man fully got up and looked Harry death in the eyes.
Harry knows by now that Draco still often tries to impress him and only shows his best behaviour. He is still obsessed with what people think of him – well certain people. Harry and his family to be precise. But Harry prefers Draco with his guards down.
With what can only be described as a very theatrical sob, Malfoy took a sip from his drink. It smelled like herbs and citrus, something Harry would not have expected the other man to drink. Staring blankly at the glass in the other man’s hand, our beloved Gryffindor decided it was time to make his former house pride and finally find the courage to talk.
Draco gives him this adorable half smile he fell for the first second he ever saw it and lazily traces the lines of his face with his fingers: the jaw, the bridge of his nose, over his bottom lip. And all Harry can think of is that sometimes, only sometimes life cannot be more perfect than is these moments. He almost leans into the kiss when Draco leans back at him and nods towards the open backdoor.
Fumbling with the fabric of his boxy old pair of jeans, he was sitting in her kitchen – the place he maybe loved the most in the world (except for Draco’s couch!) – unable to look her in the eye while he was searching for words. It had been hard enough to ask her to meet up, this seemed close to impossible. He definitely did not know how to start.
He let go of Draco’s neck and brushed the loose stands away from the face behind the ear, caressing his cheek with his palm for a moment.  From there on his hand moved along the sides of the other man’s torso, feeling the bones and muscles under the soft fabric. As well as a sweet shuddering under his breath. More, more, more! He wanted so much more of this. How on earth could he ever do anything else again that did not imply touching Draco.
With a reassuring smile the pink-haired man went into the kitchen with an ease that surprised Harry. Draco moved as if he knew the place and had been there quite a few times, carefully avoiding the squeaking parts of the floor while heading directly towards the stove. It took Harry a while to remember why Draco seemed to know where everything was. Of course, he must have been here quite a few times in his childhood, back at a time before the house belong to Sirius. A time when the Black family still held family gatherings here.
“So, this is how you look without Glamours,” he began, not knowing how to go on. Luckily, she seemed to have regained her confidence, nipping at her tea before grinning at him.
Twelve thirty they had agreed on an he was counting any minute, trying his hardest not to stress out. This was just friends meeting up. It was the ministry, what could possibly happen at all?
Harry shyly smiled at the other man across the table and wondered what a strange picture they were. Both were obviously dressed up to look their best. In his case this meant a button down, dark jeans and a rather bad attempt at taming his hair. In Draco’s case it meant pure elegance once again. He was wearing a black turtleneck shirt made from a material Harry could only describe as “expensive and unbelievable soft looking” paired with dark green formfitting pants and a gorgeous vest a colour darker than the pants but fully covered in the most delicate embroidery. His hair was combed back loosely as if he had carelessly just run his fingers through it before taking it into a ponytail but Harry was certain, the other man had put a huge amount of effort into his style. By now he knew how Draco’s hair looked like when it was actually in a lazy hairstyle (and for a moment he imagined himself, gripping it himself, running his hand through it while feverishly kissing Draco’s mouth, his other hand wandering over the delicate fabric  of his shirt to find entrance to the naked skin below.)
Draco consciously brushed a single strand of his hair back and looked down. There it was. This tiny gesture, the moment of insecurity that made Harry’s heart melt. This was the one unspoken thing our favourite Gryffindor seemed to have waited for. He reached for Draco’s chin and carefully grabbed it, eliminating the distance between them again and forcing the other man to look into his eyes.
Taking another deep breath, Harry carefully knocked at the door, still feeling like he was about to do something very intimate. ‘Don’t be silly’, he told himself, ‘people visit each other all the time! Also, I was definitely invited!’ The door opened and Astoria’s smiling face greeted him, she was obviously glad to see him. For a brief moment Harry thought that she looked different to when he last met her. He could have sworn, there was something glittering in her face once again.
“Potter, I darn well know how breathtakingly handsome I look. I mean, what would be the point of dying my hair and suffering endless hours of pain if the result did not turn out to be unbelievable stunning,” while holding what sounded like a lecture on his beauty he pointed onto his tattooed arms, “but thank you for appreciating it. If you want to continue staring at me, I am sure my assistant Miss Greengrass would be glad to sell you an autographed photograph of me. But,” and with that comment he turned his head towards his roommate, “not the naughty stuff, that is only for premium fan club members!”
“Oh, Harry my dear, whomever it is, it’s whom your heart chose, not mine. I understand if you don’t want to tell me now but be sure I will accept them.”
Today it somehow felt a bit different as is this half-conscious state he realized the aching of his heart was replaced by a slight shimmer of happiness. The awareness that in fact the person he was so desperately searching for was at his own place, hopefully sleeping peacefully.
Imagine just having stopped snogging the person you desired the most, uncertain how to move on from there. Thousands of unspoken words in the air, promises, excuses, stupid jokes but none of them leaves your dry mouth as you just look into those grey eyes opposite of you, an open question in them.
Harry was certain, Teddy had not stopped to breath once while telling him all of this. He wanted to start a reply when the little boy turned to someone obviously sitting to his right and said “I am done, I’ll brush my teeth now Granny” and went out of the frame.
In the end he thought he had managed the whole asking out thing rather fine. It had taken Harry the whole evening of that day and most of the other day to come up with a breath-taking plan that would surprise even Draco before he admitted to himself that maybe this was not his style at all. This might surprise very few of you but Harry has always been a rather traditional guy. Therefore, he went with what he would like best, meeting at a rather rustic steak house with already pre-ordered menus.
“What are you planning?”, he whispers out of breath and is surprised by how rough his own voice sounds. He did not intend to imply anything but his treacherous body decided to betray him.
we are only a few chapters away from the ending, time to finally get Harry going! You go boy, fight for your Draco!
Taking in a deep breath and finally able to see clear again, he took a look around. This was Draco’s living room. He was at the apartment. Someone had brought him here last night. That was a good sign, wasn’t it? Maybe Draco was not mad at him.
Draco gave him a crooked smile, in between actually being proud of himself really knowing his cartoons and certainly having found something to mock Harry with.
Harry was shaking his head quietly but did not answer which led to Malfoy reformulating his question.
And so, he did tell her about what he was planning on doing and why he wanted her to know beforehand. She nodded and instead of telling him off like Hermione even encouraged him to do so, telling him this sounded so much like something her children (and maybe she not only meant Tonks but Remus and Sirius as well) would have done. When he started to explain to her how much Draco had changed however, she cut him off.
It was a dull, rather boring job and he could not have been happier. Finally, he was nothing special anymore. However, from time to time an assignment struck his curiosity and no one would have dared to speak up against him. Maybe the Algherion case nobody at their office wanted to deal with as the family was considered to be ‘difficult’ was actually a blessing for him.
“Fantasies, hm? How interesting,” the other man said, leaning in closer and licking his lips playfully. “Was it about the tall blond one? Is he your type?”
place. He clearly is into you! What in Salazar’s name is your stupid problem? And stop complaining about your darn pants, those were your idea! This is even more ridiculous than your idea of always having to smell great and therefore taking a shower after every night out even though I know you are incapable of even standing after a night out! So, get your shit together and either leave the poor guy alone or finally be true to yourself. And don’t you dare texting me before you figured out what this whole thing with Potter is!”
Harry reached for her hand but stopped before they touched. This was were the hard part was starting. He took another deep breath and looked down at their hands almost touching.
“Potter”, Draco started a sentence which already sounded so wrong. Harry’s heart stopped racing in his chest for a second. An icy lump formed in his stomach. This was not good; this definitely was not good.
There was genuine interest flickering in his eyes, overlaying something which was harder to read. A dare? Hope? His voice had the same smooth tone as usual, not displaying many emotions but Harry had known the other man for a while now to read the tinier signals, the leaning in the conversation, the rubbing together of his fingers, to understand that the answer to this question was of utter importance and would be a main factor determining how their relationship would continue from this moment on an which direction it would take.
Draco had swallowed a sip of his whiskey, then another. He looked at Severus and looked away, then he looked back again. He put his glass down on the table near his chair and put his elbows on his knees. Then he sat up and looked Severus in the eye again. He picked his whiskey back up and played with the glass, hardly seeing it at all.

“Anyway,” Harry continued, “It’s the most temporary kind of Veritaserum, but Hermione says Rosscot’s Litigator, Sessions, won’t have the guts to meaningfully object while Rosscut’s still compelled.”
Shins, calves, knees, everything fascinated Draco, and he took his time running his fingers everywhere, taking care to be gentle at all times, whether he used fingertips, palms, or fingernails.
“It’s our wards,” Harry said, playing with Draco’s fingers as he spoke. “We both have such overwhelming security needs, and neither of us can really move out of our homes permanently, since our businesses are based out of them.”

Andromeda shushed him with one quelling look, and Harry stilled, remembering. Sirius’ “trial.” Dementors on Privet Drive. Harry’s trial, for that matter. Dolores Umbridge and her thousand Ministry edicts.
"No!" Harry spluttered, astonished that Draco would ask. Then he thought about the question a little more. "Not… well, maybe. I can't see what I would have to be nervous about. It's just a train ride. We'll be traveling for ages. We won't even be in London until this time tomorrow, nearly. And then we have to get ourselves to a Floo and hope McGonagall left her Floo open."
Eventually Harry wondered aloud if Draco might want another pudding, but the waiter appeared, apologetic and embarrassed. Only then did Harry and Draco realize that they were the last ones there who weren’t staff, that it was closing in on midnight, that they had been talking nonstop for over four hours.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Don’t know” Draco panted, “if yours is pretty,” he wheezed and pushed his arse higher again. “But you sure can fuck.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco was reassured all over again that his mother’s attacker would surely be incarcerated for the maximum sentence, if Hermione Granger had anything to say about it.
Harry wasn’t just fucking, him, either. It was a little like being worshipped. When Harry wasn’t sucking kisses into Draco’s shoulders while simultaneously fucking slowly into his arse, he was breathily praising Draco’s beauty or biting Draco’s neck.
"Okay," Malfoy said quietly, and they both began to strip, fast. Soon they were naked together, hard and kissing on the tiny cot, using the narrowness as an excuse to glue themselves to one another.
Afelgate looked hopeful, then pleased. "Honestly, that would be a hell of a thrill, Mr Potter. I'd appreciate that tremendously. And the modesty spell as well, please. I don't know any."
"State your business, wizards." The mermaid who spoke was intimidatingly old and tall. She'd swum forward of the rest of them and they arrayed silent behind her, some looking organized, some looking nervous. Her green and white hair seemed impossibly long and it swirled behind her, decorated with shells, pebbles, and other ornaments Harry couldn't quite place. Fish bones? This, he realized, must be the Merchieftainess, the political ruler of this village. He swallowed, unable to think of a way to diplomatically approach a request for Snape's ring.
Draco’s mother gave Harry a curt nod. Then she carefully resettled herself on her chair, fluffing her lilac wool robes, cleaning all emotion from her face.

"And I can wait however long this will take, Draco. Let me kiss you on the cheek tonight and leave you in peace. I can take you out for a late morning picnic tomorrow and-"
Blushing bright red and starting to stammer, the healer turned back to Harry. "Suh… suh… Sir?" he finally choked out.
Harry spoke toward the ceiling. “With your father Kissed and incarcerated, you are head of house and heir, both. Wards of the body, using your fluids, would secure the house more completely than any other ward, magic or spell. They would conjure a sentient net of protection around your house; even your grounds. Ones you control with your magic and mind. You would be aware if anyone attempted a breach, and you would have the power to imprison or repel anyone who tried.”
"No, Harry said, sighing, looking at the mattress, tracing a little circle with his finger and not looking at Malfoy. "Because you're a bloke. I've never thought I might be gay until I fell on you and wanted to come." He felt himself blush even though Malfoy wasn't looking at him.

They were fighting the sweetest most desperate fight, pulling, pushing, needing air but being uncapable of letting go. There was nothing more important than to not lose the physical contact between them. While one hand still played with the pink hair, making sure Draco had no chance to get away, the other had started to wander across the body in front of him, trying to conquer the unknown territory, feeling victorious when he finally managed to get under the shirt and touch naked skin.
It was worse than arguing. His boyfriend and his best friend got along very well. They were both eager to find out if they had finally found a match concerning their knowledge on history nobody else ever cared to listen to.
Then and only then would it be reasonable to even waste some time questioning himself if Draco might be interested and why.
“Astoria, if I enter the living room to find you snogging another random bloke on my favourite couch without warning me first, I am going to kill you with a plastic spoon!”, Draco explained calmly while coming around the corner.
“Harry darling,” she started, settling close to him, “you can tell me anything you need to, don’t worry. It will be alright.”
With that thought came the anger. An evil feeling that started deep down in his bowls and fought his way up through his stomach into his chest where it grew into an unidentified mess that felt dark and under pressure. Something that definitely wanted out.
Well Astoria was for sure one of a kind, he thought to himself. A bit pushy but some how quite charming. And it had never happened, that someone he just met texted him simply because they were bored and attempted to engage in small talk. Not that he was good at that. In fact, our Golden boy was quite the opposite of a conversation maker. But why not try something new. If befriending Draco Malfoy did not turn out to be a bad idea, why should getting to know his friends then be?
Charlie looked at him expectantly, a fatherly smile playing on his lips and Harry wanted nothing more than to die before this situation could get any worse if that was even possible. Which turned out to be just moments later.
“Because you told him about Draco! About how much they had in common and how great it would be if they met! You basically made the decision for him!”, she exclaimed more than angry. And she said exactly what he expected her to.
He looked like the advertisement of a man you would love to introduce to your parents as well as pull into a dark corner and snog senseless at the same time and for the first time in his life he could understand why for some people their clothes were their armour. He felt strong and confident, knowing he was looking his best.
With a loud groan Draco managed to break free only to rest his forehead against Harry’s, their lips millimetres apart. “Fuck, you are killing me,” he managed to whisper whilst our favourite Gryffindor tried to catch those lips again with his own, not willing to let go already.
It needed Professor McGonagall’s insight to make him realize staying at Hogwarts would be nothing more than him trying to escape the burden of growing out of your destiny, overcoming every expectation and having to face a life in which he was responsible for only himself and nothing more.
But something inside Harry knew it was just his desire to keep things easy and the blurring of memories that told him everything would be so much better with Ginny around once again. The bittersweet tugging in his heart was the one of longing for a memory not a possibility. He even felt ashamed noticing how little this feeling revolved around Ginny herself but centred on having a part of his family around him. Maybe Ron was right and he would have dated any Weasley – just to be with them.
Nobody would come to his rescue Harry noticed and gave up. Hoping it would calm him a bit, he finished his drink at once and followed Astoria to the dance floor. He could just stand there for a bit and move his head and then silently go back to his chair. He would not dance.
But as soon as the cool air of the night, filled with the smell of a thousand cheap perfumes and the stench of cold smoke hit him, he somehow could breath again. What was he thinking? For him all of this was brand new! Every evening was an adventure, every touch world changing, a kiss opening up a whole new universe. Draco had gotten used to this a long time ago. And that was ok because sometimes kissing was nothing more than kissing.
“I am still impressed by your encyclopaedic knowledge of Sunday morning cartoons; I only know about this one from Teddy.”
“Of course, there is something. For me there has always been something. But this is the reason I cannot do this. Even if you were willing to be with me, this would not end up well for me.”
This is only the first part of the chapter but I did not want you guys to have to wait forever. I am very busily working on this chapter as well as a very fluffy Christmas special, therefore I can only present you the first part of chapter 4 but I will do my best to finish the second part before Christmas ;)
They sat there in silence for a few moments, both obviously uncertain how to proceed, the food in between them before Draco tried his best to give Harry an encouraging smile and explained to him, he should not let the dish get waisted.
Harry did in fact receive one more picture that evening. This time Draco’s face was not in the picture. Neither was his torso. However, the bulge in his towel, giving away a rather concrete impression of what was hidden beneath, was indeed interesting as well.
“I hope you did not expect me to take you anywhere fancy. I thought casual clothing fitted casual lunch.”
While typing in his own number (oh what a lucky coincidence Hermione had forced him to learn it by heart just in case only this week!) he wondered whether Draco actually owned a smart phone as well and if he should dare to ask the blond man for his number – now that they considered each other friends this was not a weird request, wasn’t it? Unfortunately, we will never find out if the Saviour of our beloved Wizard World would have had the guts to do so as Astoria was forced to leave by a very pushy Draco, who now seemed self-aware of his hair as well as he nervously checked it in the bar mirrors. They left behind a smiling Harry who wondered if he had ever assumed Draco was sharing a flat with someone like that girl.
Harry still hadn’t spoken. He frowned. Draco leaned over and kissed him, just once, on the corner of his mouth. “Try to look a little less astonished,” he whispered.
“Shall we?” Harry asked, and he gestured toward Draco’s front door. He patiently waited for Draco to fetch his wand and keys and wallet, to lock, then ward the door behind them, and wait for the lift to arrive.

“I’ll be right there,” Harry said, cutting him off, and for once Draco was glad to be interrupted. He sighed in relief, and Harry came through immediately.
Mr. Malfoy's voice rose as he urged, and the baby - Draco - cried out. Mrs. Malfoy made soothing noises and, from the sound of it, picked the baby up and held him. Mr. Malfoy continued to talk, louder now - more determined to convince. "This belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw herself, Cissy! And the Dark Lord is entrusting me with it. He told me that if I kept it safe for a year or so he might entrust me with another object that is even more important to him. I cannot possibly refuse!
Malfoy looked at the map carefully and said nothing. Vibrating discomfort, Harry found himself barely able to keep silent while Malfoy considered what Harry had said.
, and frankly, I'm tired of it. I was thinking that I should employ either a reward system, or a punishment one, and I wondered, as a servant yourself, what do you think would work better?"
The irregular triangle of black hair that grew between Harry's navel and cock was so enticing that Draco barely touched it before getting up and starting over again at Harry's feet - which were thin and short and furry on top. Really, it was amazing how much soot-black hair grew with abandon all over this pale, short man in Draco's bed.
Draco stared at Potter for another long, confused heartbeat before motioning him toward the tiny kitchen. “I have milk, and tea sounds lovely. No sugar necessary.”

“I apologize for the formalities, Herr Potter, but since your Aunt isn’t here, and this request is for a valuable sum…”
What might be the very worst problem was that Draco was on the verge of just blurting that question into Harry’s face. Because he was so ill-equipped to deal with this moment that his manners were failing him and he was still just standing and staring at that damn blueberry muffin.
They ate at the wizarding inn, both breakfast and lunch, but dinner they decided to have on the train. They were eager to get the ring back to Hogwarts, and while nothing they did would actually make the train leave Lecce or arrive in London sooner, somehow it felt like at least this way they wouldn't be slowing anything down.
As a consequence of the potion, and the orgasm, Harry's cock would grow. In a vagina, his cock would grow slightly fatter. In a rectum, his cock would grow slightly longer. With every orgasm, his cock would grow.
“I guess,” Harry said, over the squeaks and groans of the lift, “because the house came with locks, and I grew up in a Muggle house with locks?”
“I know I am merely a guest,” he said, watching Draco’s shoulders stiffen, “but I have news from my friend, Hermione Granger. I understand she is your Litigator?”
was the fourth of the Death Eaters he might choose as his personal sex slave for the next ten years?
“There was a time,” Harry whispered, putting fingertips to Draco’s temple, “when that look would have made me likely to explode. In a bad way.”
But the elder barreled on. "No? Perhaps another time? The offer stands, I assure you. You deserve that and more than I can give, after what you've done for us. You
Harry grabbed Malfoy's hand and started to pull the other boy toward the bed, but felt resistance. He turned to see Malfoy, naked, blushing, completely erect and looking at the floor.
This was news to Harry and he paused in surprise. Malfoy took advantage of the silence to continue ranting. His half of the chocolate bar fell to the floor as he shifted forward in his chair in order to shake a finger in Harry's face.
, he told himself firmly. “You had a vivid fantasy,” he told himself out loud. Of course he had. He smiled in relief. Telling himself it was ridiculous to think otherwise, he still stepped to his front door, opened it, and checked the hallway. It was empty. Of course it was. Vivid, odd, fantasy.
find it. You're the only ones who can. Potter should have a connection to it through his mother. Draco, obviously, through the Dark Lord. In essence, when Lily rejected my ring, I then rejected the ring -- and Lily -- for the Dark Lord. Which is how Draco, who hosted the Dark Lord in his home and was bound to him unwillingly, in his own way, becomes the other best choice to seek and destroy this Bound Adorn. Especially since Draco then rejected the Dark Lord by refusing to kill the headmaster and refusing to identify Potter. Therefore you are the only ones who will be able to find and destroy it. Which you must do before Beltane, the first anniversary of my death, the twentieth anniversary of the ring entering the Black Lake, and a day of tenacious Earthen magical power."
"The talk of those pregnancies, Mr Potter," Afelgate said seriously. "It brought things to mind." He shuddered. "We should probably put both of them in complete reproductive stasis."
“And we can just talk right through at normal volume,” Draco marvelled. “Though I’m in Wiltshire and you’re over three hundred miles north.”
friends. (Millicent and her boyfriend Bhek turned out to be willing, once. (And damn, was that lunch uncomfortable.) Everyone else though, was… hard to explain, but eventually Draco just sat Harry down, in private, and went through the entire list, painstakingly, person by person. After that Harry essentially stopped asking, and Draco was grateful.)
Harry turned to look at Malfoy, who looked quite thrown. "Pansy?" he whispered. "I told you…?" it wasn't a question but it turned up at the end nonetheless.
Scrivener Flooed away smiling and Harry stretched out in front of his fire, wondering what sort of biscuit Kreacher and Dudders would surprise him with this afternoon.
“Mum and I have a strained relationship, Harry,” Draco tried, forcing himself into silence about what an orphan cannot understand. “If I wish that to change, I must offer every possible olive branch. Anything reasonable, other than relinquishing… you.”
“Mm,” Harry said, sensing a need to move the needle just a bit further. “Makes me want to suck your cock in some fancyass way. Teach me a new position?”

"I wish only to last long enough to help you learn what you need to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes, and we've come very, very far with that. I wasn't planning to tell you of Mr. Malfoy's plans or of my own coming death, but this memory from Dobby changes everything."
“Gotta face facts,” Harry decided as he punched his pillow later that week. “Malfoy’s never coming ‘round.”
Malfoy reached into his own hair and pulled out the cord that kept it neatly pulled back. Harry groaned in lust. He put first his left, then his right hand as well, into Malfoy's pretty hair.
Harry wanted to take Draco away for a weekend. Harry wanted Draco to help him choose the location, the hotel, the itinerary. But Harry was going to pay for everything.
Draco paced his parlour. He'd debated the afternoon away. Cook, or takeaway? Casual or formal dress? Candles and wine, or lights up and cheery? Muggle radio or wizarding wireless? Kitchen or dining room? Finally he'd chosen to fetch takeaway from an Asian restaurant around the corner, put it out as a fancy spread in the dining room, serve wine but leave off the candles, play a Muggle CD of mixed jazzy pop (chosen just for Harry), and wear extremely handsome but still not technically formal robes. The lights were up high, bright and cheery, but they could easily be dimmed with a wave of his wand, should that seem prudent.

"Sure thing, healer," Harry said, and cast the blurring spell he'd learned from Scrivener at the healer's crotch. The fabric of his robe went fuzzy and indistinct, but when Afelgate parted his robe, the spell had transferred to the healer's brown trousers.
“Which I appreciate,” Draco said. He shook his shoulders, took a breath and refocussed. “I had convinced myself a real relationship was off the table. Who would want me? With my disadvantages?”
But Draco had refused to be cowed any further than he apparently already was. He entered the house, assuming he'd been invited in when Severus moved aside and scowled at the gifts, then took them and dumped them unceremoniously on a sideboard.
“Me either. And, I think I’m a top? I mean, because, I’ve never, uh, anal.” Harry felt his cheeks prickle and his ears burn. “But, I mean, I think about, uh… topping. A lot.”
Draco looks eagerly at Potter’s dick. It is the largest of any Guard. Even larger than Weasley’s. Even larger than Draco’s. He touches with a tentative hand and makes a small noise of longing. He steps closer and caresses Potter’s arse, slipping a finger into his cleft. He ignores Wayne’s quiet sigh of defeat.
“Harry?” Draco wanted to get up on one elbow and look Harry more fully in the eye, but he couldn’t quite find the energy. In a minute, maybe. Then he looked toward Harry’s crotch. Harry was barely hard.
Harry nodded and their lips touched, tentatively. Harry opened his mouth a bit and, in an attempt to follow Malfoy's instructions, licked Malfoy's bottom lip. Suddenly he realized that Malfoy's tongue had joined his, and their tongues were touching, pressing, exploring.
Draco was fastening his trousers when he realized. He’d intended to mark Harry. Dominate him. Fuck his mouth.

“Er,” Draco said. He stopped on the sidewalk to look at the sky. He couldn’t see much of it here, but what he could see was sunny enough. It would be nice to have a chance to enjoy the sunshine, while it lasted. More to the point, the Knight Bus sounded horrible. He sometimes had motion sickness issues when he rode it, and the grouchy old curmudgeon who’d taken over after Stan Shunpike hated Draco vehemently. “No Apparating, then?”
“You think all I want is sex, Draco? Not even. Yes, you’re just what I like to spear on my cock. You’re fit, blonde, tall. Powerful and intelligent. You’re not impressed by my past or my job, and you
Draco smiled his best, most predatory smile, and stepped in closer so their cocks were pressing in to one another. He put one hand into Harry’s messy hair. “Yes,” he said into Harry’s ear. Then he licked it. He loosened Harry’s tie and nibbled at Harry’s lower lip.
Pleased that the plan to retrieve the horcrux was so straightforward, Harry thanked the headmaster and went back to Gryffindor tower. He kept his mind firmly away from the idea that he and Malfoy would be alone in Malfoy's bedroom - possibly for an entire night.
Harry had to work hard not to sigh, pout, or tap his foot. It wasn’t the fault of the people ahead of him that he was impatient, or that their only floo option was all tied up.
Harry walked through, and smiling proudly, turned and looked through. He bounced a bit on the balls of his feet. “I don’t want your mother to feel uncomfortable using the door, or our privacy to be in jeopardy.”
“But the other thing was, porn showed me all this other stuff two men could do. Stuff we’ve done now, mostly, and it was all, just, so much hotter? When I would get to the parts where one guy was fucking another guy, I’d just fast forward through it. That part wasn’t what got me hard and eager to come. So,” Harry shrugged, “that made it all pretty clear. I wanted a man, but I didn’t want in his arse, and I didn’t want him in mine, either. Not
It didn’t hurt that Neville was now tall, even handsome. His brown hair was thick, and rich with waves. His brown eyes were warm and kind. He wasn’t the first guy Harry would have picked out of a line of suitors, perhaps, but as they studied together, played Exploding Snap, and even cuddled a little in the Gryffindor common room, Harry started to think that offering to help Neville out with the rumour mill had been one of his more fortuitous accidents.
Now, however, they were alone. Malfoy had the controls, and Harry felt twitchy. He tried to keep mum anyway.
On Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Draco looked over at Potter as infrequently as possible, only to see that the damned Boy-Who-Lived and lived and lived again was usually looking at
“Harry,” Andromeda murmured from the doorway. “Draco has been visiting with Teddy almost as often as you. I’ve simply been keeping you apart. Clearly, I was correct. Now, please come with me to the kitchen and help me plate lunch.”
Draco blinked, focused. Auror Potter was standing in front of Draco’s desk, a wry expression on his handsome face. “I was hoping you had my paperwork? For the class? Auror Maisuradze said she explained what we needed, right?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“It was nice having you here all day,” Harry said, surprised by his own words. “Liked you asleep on my couch; liked feeding you dinner.”
"Er, no." Harry said, looking above Malfoy's head. "I've mostly been sucking at my job and going out drinking with the boys after work. I haven't had a girlfriend since I broke up with Ginny Weasley at the end of sixth year."
Draco swung around. “How do I look?” He made a soft noise of frustration. “I mean,” he tried, “what emotion am I wearing? What will she think when she sees my face?”
Andromeda nodded. “My sister and her son aren’t decorated war heroes like you, Ronald and Hermione, but they have a great deal of money, political ties and skills, and they are his family.”
Harry almost made a distressed little meep, but restrained himself in time. “Yeah,” he said instead. Both sisters turned and looked at him.

Not Charlie, not Molly, not even Ron or Hermione. He was too scared of them asking uncomfortable questions, forcing him to explore his - maybe - true sexuality.
Draco suggested a small muggle café just outside Diagon Alley where they would not be recognized so easily which Harry happily agreed on as he grew annoyed with the stares the moment, they left the Ministry. Interestingly he got most of the attention and not the pink-haired man next to him. When he turned to Draco, sharing his thoughts, the other man giggled in the maybe cutest way Harry had ever seen someone do and our favourite Gryffindor once again noticed how hard he had already fallen for the former Slytherin. Mischief blinking in his eyes Draco carelessly explained to Harry that not wearing a Glamour anymore did not automatically mean people would recognize him. Harry watched him in astonishment.
Harry figured telling him the straight forward truth like a true Gryffindor would maybe not succeed. So, going like ‘I have more than a crush on you and I think you fancy the shit out of me as well, so I thought this would be a great way to get to know you better’ was out of question. Coming up with a stupid reason would only make him look suspicious as he knew from his personal history, he was a more than bad liar.
And there he stood, Harry Potter, hero of the Wizarding World, heartthrob of hundreds of young witches and wizards looking maybe the best he had ever done, all by himself while dozens of eyes were watching him, curious of what he was going to say.
“Well, someday someone had to find out. It is true. When settling for pink hair I was in desperate need for inspiration on how to live up my looks to my hair and this is when I found the incredible fabulous Magnus Bane, a queer character depicted as so comfortable in his skin and so elegant, I decided to copy a few of his defining looks and traits.”
At first it was only him talking. Soon, he began to brabble and search for words. As always, she helped him out by asking just the right sort of questions. She was so much better at this stuff. After a while he had nothing more to say and starred at the empty space on the kitchen table between them.
Well at least that was Harry’s plan. Look great, show of your place, play it cool, make it up for yesterday. He really wanted to make a great impression and he had everything planned out. What to say, what to do, how to act.
He was surprised by how daring his last message had been but the signals from Draco were so clear, weren’t they. And if kissing was not obvious enough for the other man to notice he was definitely interested, he had to go at least one step further.
The shower stopped and Harry’s panic rose to a whole new level. He almost fell on his face while trying to untangle his feet from the soft blanket. Where were his glasses? He was unquestionably not ready to face someone without them! To his very surprise they had been neatly put on the table next to him together with a huge glass of water and something that seemed to be a hangover potion. Eagerly, he grabbed his glasses as well as the water and jugged it down.
He really was not an expert when it came to dating but even he knew, he had not made what one would consider a good impression so far therefore he attacked what he was most afraid of head over heels next. Smalltalk.
What followed next were a few of the rather worst minutes of his life. Draco did not answer. Therefore, Harry decided to do something else like cleaning up the kitchen. Which took only about ten minutes as his constant gaze on the phone told him. He started watching telly, which did not work out, he noticed as he caught himself checking his phone every minute.
Did Harry just imagine it or had Malfoy referred to meetings in plural as if this would not be a one-time thing? With a seemingly confused frown he skimmed through the parchment in front of him. It mainly contained the basic paragraphs ensuring both parties that the other one would be bound by magic to not let any piece of information spoken, written or even drawn in their meetings be known to a third party. It also had a section about expanding this disclosure to any kind of owling or texting. And a paragraph about not revealing spells such as Glamours. Interesting, he thought to himself. It was a well-known fact in the wizarding community that Harry from time to time used a Glamour to go out in public without being recognized but normally his disclosures did not mention such a thing.
He ended up sending her into the living room where she happily decorated the table, glad to finally be useful. This left Harry alone with a giant mess of burnt vegetables and a lot of time to think about the situation. He was going to prepare dinner for a strange of whom he did not know more that she was Astoria’s elder sister, had attempted Hogwarts at the same time as himself, was a friend of Pansy Parkinson (He had remembered that himself!) and according to the pictures seemed to favour blond hair on herself.
In contrast to her sibling and Draco, her outfit was more casual, a lose fitting, black crop top and some high waits hot pants with dark tights that were just see through enough to let the viewer be certain, her legs were almost covered in tattoos. Needless to say, she was pretty with her rather sharp nose and the two piercings in her lip, one on the outer right corner, one in the centre of the bottom lip.
I am almost proud of the collection of angry letters calling me the worst of names. Not only from girlfriend but also mothers, close family friends and even concerned siblings. This might be the reason I decided to stop dating at all.
“Hey aren’t those your button down and pants?”, he curiously asked Draco. “I mean not the one’s you are wearing right now but haven’t I seen you in a similar outfit? Immediately Draco was blushing, his gaze wandering between the telly and Harry. He sat up a bit and straightened his shirt, covering the lines of the chest tattoo up again – which was nearly as disappointing to Harry as having lost the feeling of another man’s – Draco’s – body on top of him.
“This terrible home décor decision, pressed upon my beautiful apartment by two malevolent witches illustrates the colourful story of how I tried to express my inner unicorn through different hair colours,” he managed to explain with a straight face, sounding more than stern. Had it not been for Astoria who broke out in laughter, Harry may have thought the other man was serious.
She was everything Harry had expected her to be and so much more. Daphne Greengrass was definitely Astoria’s sister, that one was for sure. Let alone the way she talked and used the same little gestures to show excitement was so much alike her younger sibling there couldn’t be any doubt. However, she was quite different to her bubbly, always high energy sister.
Then Draco surprised him by leaning back and smiling at in him a manner he had no words to describe it. There was a hint of flirting, a lot of softness, some curiosity and a lot of surprise in his voice when he teasingly, playfully asked: “So do you think we are dating?”
“Harry at least gets it”, she explained to her sister while winking at him conspicuously. After hugging him – a mannerism he had taken a while to get used to as way of greeting – she whispered in his ear: “Do you think my little boyfriend would like that?”
Draco seemed to have noticed his sudden hesitance as he broke away from the kiss to look into Harry’s eyes. Something our favourite Gryffindor would have appreciated any other moment in his life but right now he could not stand the thought of doing anything else but kiss the gorgeous man in front of him. His lips reached forward to at least catch another peck before realizing how hard his heart was pounding and how desperately his lungs cried out for some air.
“If you were anyone else in the world I would maybe reconsider because”, Soft fingertips were brushing over his cheek and he wanted to lean in. They were already gone after a second, “I would hopelessly fall for you.”
They in fact had a quite amusing time at lunch together in the comfortable little shop where no one was starring at them. His heart stopped racing and his breath slowed down when he noticed it was still the easiest thing in the world to talk to Draco about anything.
They ended up going to a falafel-place around the corner after Harry had taken at least ten minutes to stand around uncertain what to do next and still hating himself for how bad he was at this. By now he was embarrassed to the bone and had no clue how he could still turn the date around into a success,
The final stage of the plan was of course Malfoy's big entry. Dressed in a form fitting three-piece suit he attended his family's traditional Beltane celebrations not only by himself but also making a point nobody could overlook. It was a number of rather subtle changes that left a deep impression.
“Oh my, for Sirius it was hard to be out, especially in his own family. The rest of the world did not care much but his brother – how mad he was at him. You know that he always had a hard time with his family but he never even dreamt of them accepting him. This was why he only told me about his relationship with Remus back then.”
Harry looked alarmed, and Draco waved at him dejectedly. "No Harry, not literally. He's truly dead and gone. There is no ghost, as far as I am aware." Then he muttered quietly enough that Harry might not have heard, "Because surely if Lucius were to haunt anyone, it would be me."
"No, no," Harry said, still feeling off balance. "I'm glad to know. I have a lot to think about, all of a sudden."
Draco turned Harry around, waved his wand to dry Harry’s hands, wrists and shirt. He put his hands into Harry’s hair. “With you?” he husked into Harry’s ear, “I want everything.” He took Harry’s earlobe between his lips and applied the slightest pressure. Then he drew a line down Harry’s neck with the very tip of his tongue. “I want to do. I want to be done. I want to watch.”
“I felt rather odd describing the sensation, but Potter was most solicitous, said he knew just what I was on about. We commenced searching, and after some time, found a microscopic perforation in the Manor’s wards. Against the western wall.”
Malfoy looked alarmed. "I apologize! I had no idea you knew him. Yes, I am sad to inform you. Severus Snape was murdered by Voldemort's familiar in the last hours of the war."

Harry's adrenaline carried him nearly the whole journey to Lecce. When Draco woke -- many hours after their escape -- he found Harry humming to himself and zipping past schools of fish.
He'd have liked to hide it from his new slaves, but he knew they could tell, and while his eyes were still closed he considered his next move. "Malfoy, get on your knees and suck me till I'm hard again," he ordered, and he opened his eyes in time to see Malfoy swallow miserably.
Draco stood. “Give me one year, Harry,” he said, trying to look stoic. He managed it everywhere but right around the eyes. “See me in a year. Please?”
“What are gay men, then?” Harry asked. His voice went lower and Draco relaxed his shoulders. The rest of the 8th years, however, took a few steps back.

Nearly 45 minutes later, unsettled and barely hard, Draco curled into a miserable ball and stared out his bedroom window. Shockingly, he had been wrong. Apparently he could
As soon as he thought he could speak without crying any harder, Draco tried to explain without looking Harry in the eye.

The King's guard weren't willing to let them into the King's throne room, and — after handing over the note from Merchieftainess Murcus — they were deposited in a small room just inside the outer wall of the castle. It was filled with fish bone statues and shark tooth jewelry and had no windows. The whole castle was topped with something thick and solid, clear enough to let in light, but a lid that kept everything inside in, and outside, out. Feeling trapped, they waited, still holding hands. It felt less nerve-wracking in that room to hold another's hand.
"I am here to be with you. I can wait a long time for the mind blowing shag I know will happen between us - sooner or later. And I know, I am very sure, that eventually we will be incredible together. Because we have always been explosive, and because I want you more than I have ever wanted anyone in my entire life. Not to mention, you want me enough to push through generations worth of bullshit.
Unbidden, Draco felt his face heat. Uncomfortable, he looked at the floor, the ceiling; his drink, which he quickly finished. Finally glanced at Harry again, wondering what the man was thinking. Was surprised to see how soft Harry’s eyes had gone.
“Hey,” Harry said, stroking Draco’s clenched fingers open. “Maybe she assumes anything she tells me, she’s told us both. Like we’re a real couple to her.”
Harry glowered toward Hermione as they walked toward Hagrid’s. Why’d she ask in private? But she didn’t know about his Malfoy-related plans (or Malfoy-related indiscretions), and he wasn’t ready to spill. And, he realized, blushing, she’d been awfully nice about Aamin, starting when she’d first mentioned him in June. He could still tell the truth, though. “Aamin was sweet but dull, Hermione. Can you introduce me to anyone else?”
It was curious to see Mother taking tea with her suddenly un-estranged sister. She was a calculated balance of contemplative and warm, grateful and tremulous, nostalgic and aloof.

Draco grinned at the floor, waiting patiently now. It wasn’t long before he saw Potter’s feet approach. No longer clad in the long, formal robes of a Minister, Potter now wore new black trainers and tight black denims. He extended a hand to Draco, who took it and rose gracefully to his feet. “Let’s get you dressed in something more appropriate to this disco,” Potter murmured, and when he waved his wand, Draco shivered at the things Potter to chose to attire him in.
Harry entered the sitting room to see Draco and Narcissa studying a colorful, topographical globe. Narcissa did a spell to compare the sizes of England and Africa (it was almost ludicrous how small their island looked superimposed upon that enormous continent), another to show Draco a map of her planned journey with Dizon, then one to help discern travel options for visiting her newly re-found friend, Cellenina.
Dumbledore interrupted himself to pop a candy in his mouth, and as he chewed on it he offered one to Harry yet again. Impatient, Harry shook his head "no." Finally, Dumbledore was done chewing.
Malfoy smiled and licked Harry's lips. Harry moaned again, but this time it was into Malfoy's open mouth, and it was indeed much quieter.
never said I was, because, er, I don’t want to be. Or a bottom, if that’s what you were wondering. It’s more, that, I’m not interested in anal?”
Three hours later, Harry's slaves collapsed on their pallets asleep, exhausted from their unusual ordeal. But their magic had apparently held and the identical tattoos were remarkably handsome, even on their different skin tones. Harry decided that once they'd had a few hours to sleep it off, he'd be testing the ability to first bring them both to orgasm untouched and at his will, then cause them to desire him, and finally to prevent them from coming. Legilimency would assist him in knowing how successful Scrivener had truly been in achieving Harry's first two goals. As for the third, well, if they still hadn't had an orgasm by the end of the week, he'd assume that one had worked as well.

But then he reflected on her words. Maybe… maybe she didn’t need to know about their… other actions. They were all encompassed by her statement, after all, were they not?
“Obviously, I could not stick to that colour,” the explanation went on. The next Draco still looked stressed out but he already had the first earrings. His hair was shorter but had a deep petrol colour. He was again very pale, however. The next one had him feature dark blue hair, then lighter, then soft green, purple and finally pink. With every picture the number of piercings and tattoos grew the same way the black circles under his eyes got lighter. Harry noticed that only the first two pictures had featured Draco by himself in the black clothes he had been wearing during their last school years. After that his wardrobe had become less formal and brighter. Astoria was in many of the latter ones as well as Pansy Parkinson, stylish as ever, and another girl around the same age which had bleach blonde hair in most of the pictures and bore a distinctive similarity to Astoria.
“Thank you again, Mrs Malfoy,” the Litigator said. She stood and packed her papers with a wandless wave. Narcissa walked her to the door. “I want to assure you we have a very strong case. We fully expect to send Rosscot to Azkaban.”
“Chocolate’s a treasure during jobs like this,” Harry said, loud enough to be heard over the whining wind. The horizon threatened snow. He wanted to finish the external warding work quite soon.
So, Harry packed. He bought a phrasebook of American wizarding slang, and another book for legal tips and explanations of America’s baffling monetary system. Draco asked him to go clothes shopping, but Harry suggested they go in America instead. Draco agreed with so much enthusiasm that Harry got a bit nervous.

“Just like I said before. To have dinner with you again. Be alone together. Relax with you. Enjoy your company.”
Harry stroked a hand down Draco’s naked back, but his answer wasn’t reassuring. “He disabled them? I think. They might require medical care, actually.”
Draco cocked his head deliberately, knowing it made him look nonchalant and handsome at the same time.
Draco leaned in close, resting his cheek against Harry’s shoulder as though it belonged there. Perhaps it did, as Harry didn’t seem inclined to push him away. He laughed a little, anyway.
Harry started with an artichoke heart. Draco tried each kind of olive in turn. Harry insisted Draco try cashews. Draco fed Harry pistachios he shelled himself.
They settled on the couch in the living room and desperately looked at anything else but each other. The tension in the air had almost become unbearable when Harry finally managed to start a conversation.
Life definitely had changed for all of them after the Great War. They had all changed. Especially Hermione – well in certain ways. Opposite of him the woman who was considered to be the brightest witch of her generation and once had nothing else in her mind than studying and surpassing her own goals was currently sitting on the floor and trying to convince a one year old that is was alright to pass her the toy broccoli. She failed miserably. Patting baby Hugo on his head she returned her attention towards Harry.
She returned the smile and handed him her empty mug. Still, both went into the direction of the kitchen and he could hear her tell him about the book on Scottish magic through the centuries she was currently reading and his promise to lend her one of the diaries the Malfoy family had treasured over the centuries that was featuring the stories of a young witch exploring potions together with Shakespeare himself.
Instead, Astoria turned towards Draco with an enormous grin and explained: “If that’s so Harry, you should come around more often and keep us company!”
Soon, his discomfort around the blond guy got less and less and he actually managed to go as far as emitting that he was maybe staring at Cedric Diggory’s butt from time to time which only made Malfoy throw one hand into the air, melodramatically commenting “well who on earth hasn’t, I mean this arse was made to be stared at!” It was still mainly the former Slytherin talking when it came to sensitive subjects such as sexual orientation, however, they did not exclusively stick to that topic but also had lively discussions about Quidditch (Where Malfoy tended to make fun of the awful colour combinations of some teams), the current reorganization processes going on at the Ministry (Where Malfoy kept complaining about the pour choices of fabric being made when it came to redecoration) and any current rumours that did or did not directly concern them (“Honestly Potter, how could anyone assume I would even touch that creepy old guy! I am way to rich and good looking to be a gold digger!”). To make it short, they were actually getting along quite well, surely avoiding difficult topics such as their past on different sides of the war but looking at Draco Malfoy now, Harry had a hard time finding any resemblance to the scared and broken boy who suffered under Voldemort and was raised to be a part of this dark cult.
Currently the gifts wrapped up in black and white fancy wrap were deposed under the wry Christmas tree and looked as much out of place as Draco did in his brand-new clothes helping Molly prepare the drinks while she was wearing her oldest stained apron. Somehow those two seemed to get along just fine. At least this was what Harry assumed when both simultaneously gestured towards him to go away.
Sitting in the soft afternoon light that hit the armchair just right, a steaming hot cup of tea in his two hands and a squeaking toddler at his feet playing with miniature versions of cooking supply already helped a lot. The world had not suddenly started spinning around him feeling more or less attractive or being unsure about his looks. Since the Triwizarding Ball back in grade four had he not waisted this amount of thoughts on his looks. I mean, how could he? A war had happened after that year. There certainly were other things on Harry’s mind back then.
It had been exactly 17 days since the news of his and Ginny's break up went public. 17 days of him being hunted by reporters, stalked by hundreds of owls and not being able to set one foot out of his home without having to answer the same questions over and over again.
As soon as he managed to open his eyes the burning light that came through the dimmed windows stung in his face and he was in panic. This was definitely not his place. His couch did not smell like new furniture or pinewood and his cushions were not white at all. Also, his blankets all were at least twenty years old and more cosy than stylish. The one covering his legs was dark grey and felt as if it was expensive fabric that had to be handwashed only. Furthermore, he could hear the faint sound of a shower. When he was at home, he was alone. There was no one who would use his bathroom.
