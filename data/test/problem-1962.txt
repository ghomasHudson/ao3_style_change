He looks at him across the lift and wonders what the fuck he's supposed to say, and what’s suppos ed to happen now. What he even
He lets his head be cradled and his hair stroked, because for all he begrudges, he loves his mother. And he had missed her while he was away, so much so he'd cried with it a few times. "I know."
“And yet, you didn’t laugh.”
Well. Well! If that isn’t the most hypocritical thing Draco’s ever fucking heard.
"He'd have taken the absolute piss out of you for getting married and having a bloody kid before you're twenty-five. Completely unforgivable, Ron."
," Blaise drawls. "I simply have no desire to coddle you the way she does." He plucks the cigarette from Pansy's free hand and takes a long drag off of it.
But it does feel like defeat, so he stays. Bitterly. Defiantly. Keeping his elbow tucked in so he doesn’t even accidentally come within five inches of touching Malfoy’s pointy elbow.
“I’m not being
“Mm,” Harry says, following Draco’s hand — a pale, elegant line moving above him, letting himself melt into the smooth, polished sound of Draco’s voice and the taste of his expensive wine (which tastes
"Yeah, for real," says Harry. "I've had enough. Thanks for your help with the Spattergroit stuff, Hermione." He takes the files off the table and stuffs them into an inside pocket of his coat. "And, er ... thanks. About the Malfoy thing." He pats Ron's back and starts heading into the living room towards the Floo. "I'll see you guys tomorrow for lunch, yeah?"
Harry blinks. He watches Malfoy stand, surprised by the reaction. “I was taking the piss,” he says slowly, frowning.
“Do elaborate.”
implies some semblance of actual journalistic integrity, of which the Prophet has but a shred.
“I should probably stop,” Harry muses.
Up and down his arms Harry gets goosebumps, his cock hardening against his thigh to make an entirely obvious bulge in his trousers. He kisses Draco again, longer this time and with a tease of tongue, but still pulls away in the end. "What about that exactly," he says against Draco's lips, "doesn't count?"
But he doesn't get to, because there's the unmistakable sound of Ron pounding down the stairs and what Harry definitely doesn't need is Ron walking in on
“My hair is
"You've been here all night, haven't you?" she says knowingly as she sits down beside him with her salad. "Your coffee looks blacker than usual."
"Don't be silly, Draco," says Pansy. "We shan't be displaced by the great unwashed."
“Are we?” says Draco, because his desire to be a cunt flares up at the most unpredictable of moments. “How nice of Granger to have lent you the Gryffindor brain cell for today. She really should give the rest of you a turn more often.”
Draco's been told, often, that he has an awful habit of speaking before he thinks. "I don't know about Gryffindors, but us Slytherins aren't in the practice of denying ourselves pleasure." Draco wets his bottom lip. "To paraphrase, Potter; do it, then."
The balustrade juts hard into Draco’s naked chest when Potter thrusts like that, shuddering his hips forward. Panting slightly, Draco says, “Never one of my strengths. Do that again.”
“No,” Harry agrees.
“I’ll raise you something better,” Draco says. Pansy may find the whole thing utterly hilarious by now (not that she ever
Whatever the reason, he's less successful at containing his annoyance than he'd have liked.
Harry's heart sinks when Malfoy's wand vibrates; he can see the shutters closing, knows that whatever headway he'd been about to make is lost. There's a barrier again that he wouldn't be able to get through right now even if he'd had the energy to try.
“Yeah.”
Erm, whatever that means.
Draco frowns. “
of Harry’s coming out and subsequent queer escapades (a direct quote) are reported upon with a degree of cosseting. Not Malfoy’s.
Harry thinks he shouldn’t feel as pleased as he does at the compliment. Even though Draco called him an idiot. It’s a little difficult to take such insults to heart, when they’re mumbled lazily into his cheek.
. I didn't need you to stick around and brush my hair, or whatever. If you're apologising, don't. Fucking don't," Draco says. As for the goading, well. He supposes he is rather guilty of that. Serves Potter right.
Like one of those oil paintings with the perpetual tilt to their chin and narrowed lids, but painted in soft, gentle strokes so the skin looks smooth and the hair kind of gauzy and soft. No. Malfoy's probably more of a sculpture. Angular and carefully made. A marble one with one of those velvet ropes around it and a sign that says ‘
"How fun," Draco says. "It's like a Muggle confessional. When we were seven, I pushed Pansy into the Wiltshire Pond and told Mother it was the wind."
But when Malfoy starts tugging at his jumper, Harry still pulls away from his neck and stops his hand. He's not even close to drunk enough for this to go any farther on the stairs in the entrance hall. Quite frankly he doesn't think there's enough alcohol in Britain.
Maybe it's because he's tipsy. Maybe it's because he hasn't seen Malfoy in ... two years? Three? And he's remembered suddenly how much his mere presence makes Harry feel agitated on a molecular level. Maybe it's the way Malfoy says
what I want, I've got no idea. I wish he'd stayed in fucking Paris."
good at this, and he, Harry, isn’t totally prepared to have the depths of his mind plumbed. He thinks of Hermione scolding him recently for putting off studying, of Christmas at the Weasleys’, of playing Quidditch with a new broom. But he’s never had good control, and soon enough everything he doesn’t want to think of is rising to the surface: walking into the forest with his heart pounding out what he believed to be its last beats; kissing Cho after she’d been crying about Cedric; and the really embarrassing stuff — the contentedness of holding Draco in bed after fucking and before sleep, the way his hair smells, the way his mouth tastes, the way Harry’s stomach always explodes with butterflies any time Draco looks at him from across a classroom or the Great Hall. He tries to block it out and can’t, and so instead he closes his eyes and shakes his head and says, “Alright, alright, enough. Fuck, you’re good at that.”
Harry laughs, mostly in disbelief, when Draco tugs his hand back towards his neck. He pins it to the mattress, says, “Be
go around hoping for this, then?"
“It wasn’t her decision,” Draco says. “Mother’s hamartia has always been her devotion to Lucius.”
The thing about Potter, is that he’s kind of like one of those annoying songs that gets stuck in your head. And you’re singing it over and over, and it’s refusing to exit your consciousness, no matter how hard you try and force it out. And then somewhere between one thought and the next, it’s gone. And it can be gone for ages and ages, but when you hear it again it slots right back into inscencing prominence, as if it never left. Draco thinks.
“Good. Keep going.”
“Well of course. What can’t you do?” Draco says. He bucks his hips underneath Harry, not really trying to toss him off but also wanting to, a bit.
“Ouch,” says Draco, crossing his arms and leaning against the counter. The child is quiet now, cooing over Potter’s shoulder. “And I think you’ll find the only
"No," Harry says simply. "It wasn't. Not for me. But I guess with your life in Romania I can see how it'd feel that way for you." Which, yeah, that hurts a bit. He doesn't resent it — he knows Charlie doesn't mean it in a hurtful way —but still.
“Harry,” says Hermione when they’ve made a good dent in the food, acknowledging him for the first time in ten minutes and interrupting his and Ron’s cross-discussion about Quidditch. Her voice sounds a little loose from the wine. “Remember that raid you did last year, the married couple who were selling fake organs?”
Draco, with his shirt halfway down his torso, considers this. “You have that map, don’t you?” he asks.

"Boring!" Blaise opines. "Draco, go sit in the corner."

"What're you riding these days?" he asks, rifling around in the shed and picking out two of Ginny's nicest training brooms.
Cunt. “I have questionable taste, I suppose,” says Draco.
“Mm, yeah, there was this one old tosser on the Wizengamot who thought that was a little soft. His sister was a casualty, I think, in the first war. Suggested a probationary period, after which they could reevaluate my privileges.”
“Greek mythology. That’s the name of the— nghh, Harry — the dragon.”
“Then I’ll come to yours,” Harry smirks.
When Malfoy wants something, he blinks. A stupid slow one with long golden eyelashes. It’s really quite effective. It’s also how Malfoy ends up sipping a twenty-two pound cocktail that Harry paid for.
“You underestimate me. I’d wage fifty, at least. Starting with a hair brush.”
“Oh, a
Blaise cuts off just as he's about to retort when Draco speaks up, but he gives Pansy two fingers for good measure.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Exactly.”
Harry thinks he might die (properly, this time) from the sheer amount of blood rushing into his cock. “Knickers,” Harry says in a pathetically strangled voice. He reaches out to flick the black, lacy elastic at Draco’s hip.
"Didn't we all? Nah, you know, I reckon I owed it to Harry to give Hermione a kid she could fuss over instead of him," Ron says.
"Harry," Ron says, very quietly, once recovered from his stupor. "You know how they say babies are a lot of work? Like, the hardest thing you'll ever do?"
"He's fragile, and he's shaken, and every time he sees
"Well? Details, darling."
“I think that’ll be ten points from Gryffindor,” Draco muses. He probably could’ve come up with something more cutting, but as Weasley leaves the room with a covert “bite me, ferret face”, he’s become distinctly aware that he’s now alone with Potter.
At Blaise (not the person, the bar. Yeah. The Slytherin ego truly is a wonderful thing), Malfoy often wears button ups buttoned down to below the sternum, and trousers that sit low on his hips and tight on his bum.
Draco was thinking about Potter when he swept out of Granger and Weasley’s flat, and ended up walking back to the rental instead of Apparating, because he was at the corner of his street before he’d realised what he was doing. He was thinking about Potter, with

. He wonders sometimes if he’s fucked in the head and incapable of anything healthy like that.
“Me too,” says Harry. He pulls a fresh joint from his robes (Seamus, at his request, had stocked up over the hols) and nods towards the back of the greenhouse. “I’m gonna go out back, wanna join me?”
“So good, fuck, Draco,” Harry moans, and Draco mewls desperately in response. Harry feels cleaved in two (which is er, rather ironic, he supposes) at the vulnerability of the sound, the marble beauty of Draco’s naked, pliant form, bent over before him. When his hip bones are flush to Draco’s arse, he starts to thrust. Draco wants it—
straight.”
“Oh?” Pansy hums. “More inadvisable than the time we went to that rave in the Parisian catacombs?”
"Sometimes it's lace," Draco says. Huffs and bucks into Potter's hand. Fucking finally.
“Will it be much longer?” she asks after a few minutes, keeping her voice light. “I only set aside an hour today to meet with her.”
“Yes,” says Draco, rather absently. There’s about fifty different ways he’s confused right now. “I suppose you would.”
Draco takes all of one second to collect himself before he says, “Empty. Fuck me, yes?”
Shifting suddenly to sit himself on top of Harry, Draco says, "Let's just do it then." He feels horrifically fond of Potter just now, blushing and so forthright about his concern for Draco. What's the worst that could happen? As Harry pointed out, if they fight, they'll probably have amazing rough sex, anyway. Win-win.
It makes Draco want to squirm out of his skin, when Harry says that. “It means

“Healer Granger?”

Draco says, “It just felt like everything I wanted you had. Quidditch, the House Cup. Attention too, but the right kind.” And then, at the look on Harry’s face: “I was
Maybe it’s because it’s so ridiculously skimpy. Or because Draco’s arse is a particularly impressive specimen. But no. Harry knows what it is. It’s that it’s Malfoy — that’s why he drops to his knees and stares like an—

"How's that?" he asks. His other hand slides around to Malfoy's stomach, finding the navel ring again and pulling lightly.
balls, Pansy—"
Harry shrugs. He’s not wrong — he’s been thinking about Malfoy too often lately, and he’d been far too prepared to say yes to whatever imaginary offer he’d thought Malfoy was going to make the other night. He says, “You do, though. Don’t you?”
Draco blinks for a moment, and then he says, “Oh,” and then he drops his head to Harry’s shoulder and giggles.
"Thousands. How many more times can you take out all that suppressed emotion on my wrists before they bruise, do you think?"
Blaise, who is holding up a sheer black shirt in one hand and a pinstriped suit jacket in the other (where the fuck he produced them from is anyone's guess), snorts. "Doing what? If you're not with us, you're working, and today was your day off." He sets down the shirt, and slips the jacket over his bare chest, and smirks. "Unless, did you find another fascinating tome of Revised Brewing Techniques that you just couldn't put down, like the other night?"

“Don’t do that."

Sarcastic cunt.
"Right,” Draco snickers. He drops himself down on one of the only surfaces that hasn’t been soiled by fornication, and snaps his fingers. “If you’re not a close and personal friend of mine, kindly fuck off.”
“Hey Malfoy. Is the talking-like-ponce a pureblood thing, or is that just. You know. Cause you’re a complete prick.” Weasley holds out his hand and Potter smacks it enthusiastically, the two of them snickering like Ron had said anything remotely clever. Draco talks like an aristocrat because he is one.
Malfoy laughs, Harry feels it in his shoulders. “You’re a wordsmith, Potter. You paint an exquisite picture.”
Genuinely surprised by the consent, Harry grins dopily upon realising he doesn’t have to do anymore needling and that he’ll get to sleep — even just for a few hours — in Draco’s bed. “Brilliant,” he says. “I have my cloak, it shouldn’t be a problem.”
“So am I, thanks,” says Harry.
The knee to his thigh hurts and Harry struggles to reinforce his position, returning his hands to Malfoy’s wrists with that taunt still ringing in his head. “That wasn’t a no. And you deserved it.”

“I realise you’re being protective because you care about him,” she says, in a much softer tone than she’s used thus far. “I feel the same about Harry. He’s been out of sorts about the whole thing as well and I was a little wary at first when he said he wanted me to go out of my way to warn him when I’ll be with Draco but I think he’s right, just trying to take care of himself. So while I won’t promise to keep a distance from Draco, because he’s my friend and I don’t think that’s fair to him, I

“Fine,” he shrugs. Stressful, more like. Quite sad. Unexpectedly satisfying in other ways. “No worse than when I lived with the Dursleys, anyway. I always liked Christmas here, I almost wish I’d stayed.”

Second of all, ‘it didn’t take you long’? Fuck you. And third of all, I haven’t a clue what kind of kisser Potter is. I share your assumption that he’s appalling, but as if I’d ever endeavour to find out, so don’t be foul.”
“Oh fuck,” Draco moans, “oh fuck, oh fuck.” He reaches one hand back to join Potter’s on his waist, starting to feel dim at the corners with the intensity of it all. “Harder, fuck.”
Charlie's not sure if Harry thinks he's being subtle, but either way, he's really, really not. He keeps his face as passive as he can (and it's difficult not only because he knows what Harry's getting at, but also because mention of Lucius Malfoy has always made his blood boil since he learned the role the bastard played in Ginny's near death) and says, "No, never had the pleasure."
Work, following the
Harry is trying to push certain thoughts and memories to the top of the pile. Granger’s face, messes of wrapping paper under a crooked Christmas tree draped in maroon tinsel, kissing Cho Chang beneath high-vaulted ceiling — “Jealous,” Draco snorts — sit in flimsy, fractured layers that can be easily peeled back to reveal those beneath.
, fuck me open.”
Perhaps not as much of a functioning adult as Hermione had thought. “Fine, Harry. Hello, Terry. How are you?”

“Says you. Snake. You’re a snake man.”
“Did you fuck?” Blaise says immediately.

Dominique pokes her head into Pansy’s office, where she’s sitting with her ankles crossed atop the desk and a nail file in hand.
Malfoy really is gone on Monday going by his absence in Potions, but the next day he's back again in Herbology and Harry spends most of the lesson frowning at the back of his head. Afterwards, while everyone's finishing cleaning up and Sprout heads over to greenhouse one for a first-year class, Harry tells Ron and Hermione to go on without him and goes to lean against the workstation where Malfoy's still packing away his things.
Draco hadn't particularly wanted to attend tonight's soiree. Last time the eighth-years had a party, he'd gotten so incredibly toasted that he'd called Blaise daddy while they were snogging. He rather regrets it.
“I mean … yeah.” Harry shrugs. “I’ve heard it a few times. I don’t really pay much attention to school gossip, though. So you and Parkinson, then … I always thought you were a thing. Not the case?”
Harry's hands go automatically to Draco's waist, eyebrows raising at the bull-headedness of what he says, which seems so highly unlike him. Still, he can't help grinning a little. "It's not even March," he points out, "you still have four months to get sick of me and change your mind."
"Be more selfish. You'll be much happier."
“Is it about Filch? Something about his, er, special relationship with his cat?”
And. Then. Potter sat next to him at Granger’s dining table, and called him a brat in the kitchen. Stood very close. Was hard in his trousers. And it was the song being blasted directly into Draco’s fucking ear drums. Has not left since.
"Oh, Merlin," Harry hears Hermione sigh.
It’s possible that everyone decided to leave Malfoy alone when he returned after three months awaiting his trial in Azkaban because they’d matured and forgiven, and stuff like that. Harry thinks it was probably more to do with the fact that Malfoy just cut such a devastatingly pathetic figure, all sad looking and thin and pale, that no one could really bring themselves to bother him. Either way, Malfoy came back, and no one seemed to care as much as they should.
“Ron, shut up!” Ginny says hotly. “Merlin, you’re so nosey. It’s none of your business.”
"Just a few days," says Charlie. "Mum wants me to stay a week at least, but I can't miss New Years on the ranch. Fucking incredible. You should come, one year."
Charlie passes the spliff back after a nice long drag. Mum'll do her nut when she smells the stuff on him (she can always tell, even after a good Scourgify), but he's 31 now, so fuck it.
Laughing a little into his mouth and ruining the kiss, Harry says, "I'll figure you out eventually, you know."
“Planets! Shit, there are planets.”
Harry thinks it's fucking stupid.
“Shut up. I’m just saying, isn’t it sending the wrong message?”
Draco doesn’t look at him. “Hurrah. Not too many big words for you, then?”
“Keep talking, Draco.” Harry kisses Draco’s temple gently. He likes the feeling of the softly buzzed hair on his lips. “I’m listening.”
In fact Harry’s pretty sure he knows what Ron’s thinking about; he and Hermione are good (if obvious) about not bringing Natalie up, but he knows perfectly well they still discuss it amongst themselves when they think he’s retreating into himself. Or whatever.
“What does that mean?” Pansy asks before Blaise can even open his mouth. She’s sitting forward, properly interested. “Did something else happen?”
He still spent a lot of his time at home, tinkering around in the shed with Dad and holding George's hand where it stuck out from under his duvet for hours and hours on end. But his flat helped.
When Draco makes to stand, still deliciously, beautifully naked and smelling like Harry’s tingling magic and rich dark chocolate, Harry frowns in confusion.
"One go?" Pansy repeats, losing steam before she can properly get excited — as he'd warned. "You mean, like, one round, yes?"

“She sounds like a bint,” Draco says absently. “How did young Harry explain that one to himself?”
place of work?”
Draco shrugs. "Granger called over this afternoon."
“Fuck you,” Draco mutters, and sits back down in his chair. "We were in the lift together this morning, and it stopped working. Some fucking imbecile brought a Muggle mobile into the hospital under Concealment Charms and it Stifled everything from the third floor up."
Shit, it feels good, like some incredible release that’s been building and building, and he hasn’t even come yet. Draco winces a little when Potter fucks deeper into him. “Cause,” he says, then moans and drops his head into the crook of his bent elbow, “I’m pristine.”
, you halfwit, that’s exactly my point. Unless you’re an especially opaque and fucking irksome ghost, then I believe you didn’t die last year.”
Draco frowns. "Why?"
“Fine,” says Harry. “And you?”

"Will you quit it, Blaise?" Pansy says. She gets up from the bed and sits beside Draco's head, running fingers through his white hair with those talons she calls nails. They do admittedly feel rather good on one's scalp. "Draco, what do you mean, darling?"
“No,” he agrees, because he’s already discussed with Pansy his firm resolve to not fuck Potter, ever again. “But he’s. He’s not
The Hunt (a fittingly stupid title, in Harry’s opinion) was published two years after the war. Quasi-biographical, but mostly centred around Harry, Ron and Hermione’s titular search for Horcruxes in that one long, horrible year. When it was published, the three of them bandied together all the wine they could find, settled down on Ron and Hermione’s living room floor, and read it aloud. For a “horridious cow with no moral compass” (quote Hermione), Skeeter’s account was surprisingly accurate.
Harry wants to be inside, he simply wants until he’s shaking with it, until he pushes the flimsy fabric of Draco’s knickers to the side instead of taking them off and fucks into him.
At Dumbledore’s mention, the bile rises in Draco’s throat. He coughs, then waves a dismissive hand. “Of course he was. Though I suppose people might say that about me, too.”
But like. In a sexy way.

Leaning forward on his elbows, Draco says, “I’ll open up to you right now if you desist with the interrogation.”

He moans, grasps at the wall, because he —

It’s almost unbearably intimate like this. He can see every expression pass across Malfoy’s face, can watch him make those little noises, and he can bury his face in Malfoy’s neck so that he’s all Harry can breathe or taste or feel. He mouths at his neck as he pumps into him, alternating fast strokes with slower ones that disrupt the pace and his rapidly-approaching orgasm.
"The child was quite the recalcitrant, and Potter was able to calm her for me. He asked me how my holidays were, it was magnificently awkward, and then he left," says Draco.
“Harry, you’re not funny.”
Draco says, “
Harry squints carefully. “What’s it supposed to be?”
“A negligible amount,” Draco lies. His legs are tucked rather awkwardly under him, meaning his twitching cock finds a little friction against his thigh.
— that’s nice of you.”
Ginny likes being the youngest child for many reasons, principle of which is that it means she can usually skive off chores pretty easily. Right now, for instance, Ron and Bill are trying to get Teddy and Victoire away from their presents long enough to have breakfast (fuck, they’re cute and all, but she’s never having kids), and Mum’s wrangled George and Perce into chopping potatoes and whipping cream, and she’s sitting on the couch, with Harry by her side.
Harry laughs again. “You know if there’s anyone from our world they’d get along with it’d definitely be the one who made me write with my own blood.” He wonders vaguely where they might be right now, if they’re back on Privet Drive settling into their old, normal, boring lives. “Your turn,” he says softly, shifting a little. “Talk to me about your mum and dad.”
know him. Heidi could’ve just handled the store herself yesterday, you should’ve told me Malfoy was the only person you could find.”
Charlie got pretty good at reading Harry, so he can tell he's a little miffed at that. Charlie is too, really — Harry turned out to be a brilliant fuck and he's looking fitter than ever. It's for the best, though.
The remainder of the meal is tense, only Harry thinks that might just be between himself and Malfoy. Ron's holding back on the mocking front and Malfoy and Hermione have slipped back into their easy repartee but he can feel Malfoy ignoring him in an active way, and Harry's still just hard enough to be uncomfortable and can't stop sneaking glances at his profile.
It’s Malfoy’s smug mouth, but it hits different when Harry has him so thoroughly pinned to his mattress. He likes that control, and he decides to explore it a little.
Harry says, “Silk,” into the plane between Draco’s neck and his ear, because that’s what he tastes — warm skin and the closely shorn hair of Draco’s nape.
“Right,” Harry muses. “But you don’t?”

“I don’t want to fight you," says Draco. Not fight, but perhaps goad with pithy remarks until he fucks off. The Astronomy Tower, petulant as it sounds (though Draco's never had an issue with petulance) is his place.

“This guy went down like a sack o’ potatoes,” Terry wheezes, banging the tabletop with his palm. Ron’s in tears as well. Harry sips his beer through pursed lips. “Sorry, mate,” Terry slings an arm round Harry’s shoulders and punches his arm, which is holding his beer, which sloshes over the rim and onto his shirt. “You shoulda seen the look on your face when you ate shit, that’s all.”
“What? Wait, when did he—" Pansy starts saying, but Blaise cuts her off —
Malfoy responds by pulling Harry’s arms tighter around him, rocking his hips enthusiastically and saying, “They do when they’re seeking a good hard shag.”
His veins seem to shiver with anticipation at Malfoy's confession, which
“I won’t be here tomorrow,” Draco says. He takes a step back. “Next time you feel like manufacturing a coincidence, I’ll be sure to have it on me.”
Wait. "What?" Harry says, brought up short by this suggestion. "No, she ... what are you talking about? She doesn't know, I only told ..." Ron. That fucking berk. "Look. No one
asked, had he not? The mental image alone is something he could wank to for weeks, probably.
Potter clenches his fists at his thighs, Draco grips the thread hard and keeps pulling.
"Seeing all the Weasleys together must be a pretty overwhelming experience for you, then. I'm pretty sure Charlie's gay, you want me to put you two in contact?"
Draco moans, drops his head onto the wall in front of him, slightly slick from condensation.
Harry’s caught halfway between a frown and amusement. “I’m taking the fucking piss, Draco,” he says. “Would it do it for you if I degraded myself a bit instead?”
Sixth year was truly the only time since meeting Harry Potter that Draco had gone long periods of time without thinking about him. Pansy ruined it, on occasion, by giggling at the irony of Draco pulling off to the thought of him. She thought that was all there was to it. It wasn’t.
Harry waits in the cold when Charlie goes inside to say hi to his family, with his joint and his his light jacket and his glasses constantly fogging up, and when Charlie comes back out he nods towards the broom shed. “Let’s do it,” he says, and he offers the joint out. “You want?”

“Six,” Draco says, blowing past Potter’s pathetic attempt at niceties. “It’s stopped crying now, you can leave if you wish. I’m sure I can handle her for another two hours.”
Harry laughs, feeling somewhat delirious. There's not a single point of tension in his body that doesn't have to do with how good it feels to be fucking Malfoy, not enough space left in his overwrought brain to worry about anything other than not coming too soon. "I will," he says, sliding a hand up Malfoy's back in something like reverence, "just give me a second."
"Jesus, Hermione," Harry says as he rights himself and Terry dissolves into laughter. He chucks the Quaffle at him, which shuts him up. "I mean, hi. All right?"
“What the hell's going on?” he says, glad to hear the wails lowering in volume a little. “Where’s Ron?”
Another unsurprising answer. Of course.
Hermione lifts an eyebrow. She nearly says something about the 'client' Pansy was supposed to have been with before her, and how she'd seen no one coming out, and how that's impossible if this fireplace isn't connected to the Floo Network, but she decides to let it go.
Draco said: "You're a wench."
Harry wishes Malfoy wouldn’t talk about his cock while drinking through a straw. Fuck. Drunk Harry is so very
“You did this —” Harry gestures to the inky, twinkling blackness swirling where Draco’s high, white ceiling and poncy (
“Give me a break, Malfoy,” Harry bites out. “You didn’t immediately get the answer you wanted from me so now we’re back where we started? You can’t force people to figure things out at
Harry’s chest feels oddly tight suddenly, but not necessarily in the bad way. Maybe tightness is the wrong word. In fact he feels distinctly short of breath. And warm. In a short and surreal sequence of movements, he checks his watch, notes that it’s almost three, and then looks back down at Malfoy, meeting his eyes. Fucking shit.
, and she'll invite over whomever she sees fit, but it doesn't quite ring true. The cottage is kind of Harry's place, too. "Does he really make you that uncomfortable?"
“C’mon, pet,” Harry enthuses, delicately tracing Draco’s bollocks. “Want to hear your beautiful voice.” He presses a few chaste kisses across Draco’s perineum and up his shaft, slick and dripping. “Love your voice, Draco (kiss). Love hearing you talk (kiss). Makes me fucking hard (kiss). Speak, pet.”
So Charlie and Harry started shagging. Quite a lot. Harry split his time between the Burrow, Charlie's flat, and Grimmauld, where he lived with Ron and Hermione. Well, sort of. The three of them slept there, but that was pretty much it.
Draco knows his delicate skin will bruise from where he was crowded against the counter, and he silently lists every Healing spell he can think of.

Harry says, "You're pretty boring these days, aren't you?"
brute strength. Is there anything you don’t have, Potter?”
When Draco makes a sound that’s more like a squeal than anything else Harry’s ever heard, and writhes and wriggles like a mad thing, Harry groans, and Draco’s thighs tremble, and Harry pushes himself to his feet, all coltish and dizzy, and grabs Draco by the hips.
"I dunno," Harry says. "Because you seem lost."
"I said two fucking sentences to her!" Draco shoots back, deciding to let the inbred comment go (mostly because it's, um, kind of true). "And they were statements of fact. Whatever Granger's inferred from that clearly has more to do with you than it does with me."
“Never mind,” says Harry. “None of my business. I’ll see you round, Malfoy.”
He’s explored the castle more times than he could ever count and knows his way around better than his first-year self could have ever conceived. Some shortcuts are ones he’s learned from the map, some from his own wanderings and rule-breakings, and he likes quietly moving through them with Malfoy, like they’re mates or something.
“Ta ta, Granger. Thanks for the spread.”
He nearly tells Malfoy they should do this again some time but bites his tongue at the last second, because he can't be sure it won't come out sounding sarcastic. Instead, he leaves him with a simple "Night" that feels weirdly friendly.
and towards him. Draco whimpers softly as Harry kisses each of his knuckles, twice, and presses them to the wall beside his head. The lights have changed again; dusky pinks and yellows. They turn the grey of Draco’s eyes warm.
“How did we get here?”
. Ugh, the things she does for Draco.
“As always your wit thrills and beguiles me.” Draco feels the familiar, pleasurable sensation of malice enveloping his tongue, sharpening all his edges. “Is it that word of the day toilet paper Granger’s put in the bathroom?”
And that's absolutely no fun to think about, so he focuses instead on Malfoy and his navel ring and his bitten lips and the gleam in his eye that says he's very turned on right now.
chance I saw you sitting here. I like looking at it when I can't sleep." He points to the names at the top, Prongs specifically. "That was my dad."
Hm. All this Greek mythology stuff is actually quite interesting. Harry will have to remember to ask Draco about it another time. You know. When he isn’t sucking his brains out through his dick, or something.
,” Draco says. He pushes himself off Harry’s chest and back to the foot of the bed, holding his rather surprised eye line the entire time.
When Harry removes his mouth, the skin is red and purple and his lips are slick with spit. “Would you like that?”
"You know, this is on
Hermione grins. “
“Perpetual,” repeats Harry. “What a fun word. And that was harsh.”
“And this is all going to be in secret?” says Harry, lifting a sceptical eyebrow.
been busy this week. Terribly so. However, as far as gossip goes, this is of the essential variety.
“An experiment.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Shall we get back to snogging, then? You’re still hard,” he points out.
“I wouldn’t ask you to,” Harry says. Privately he’s dealing with Malfoy not even bothering to deny it, and the weird way that makes him feel. “All I do know is I like spending time with you. And I wouldn’t want that to stop.”
He might chunder. He might literally throw up. Harry's always been tragically adept at picking the most ill-advised prospects possible (what with Cho being recently widowed, Ginny otherwise occupied and the sister of his best friend, Charlie in Romania for most of the year, and also, once again,
At least she'd brought Dominique along.
Potter, you know. What kind of lunatic behaves that way?"
Ron sits down next to her heavily, a little resentful Harry’s making them have to deal with his Malfoy obsession
“What?”
Harry raises his eyebrows. It’s about dead anyway, though, so he says “Sure” and tosses the roach on the ground, stepping on it to put it out.
"Oh, shut up, you know that's not what I meant," Harry says wearily, dropping his hands. "Did you even hear me? I can't get him out of my fucking head. I swore to her I wasn't getting involved with him." It makes his stomach clench. He lets out a humourless laugh and meets Ron's eyes. "I
She rolls her eyes again. And finds herself suddenly extremely curious about the actual size of Potter's cock.
“Shut up,” says Harry. He squints harder. Malfoy is wearing eyeliner, and something shiny on his cheekbones, and something glossy on his lips, and he’s draping.
Draco withdraws carefully, the images in his head fading back to his own thoughts. Harry is a pitifully hopeless Occlumens — his angsting simply meant that Draco could see not only what Harry didn’t want him to, but also why he didn’t want him to see it. There was the forest, a circle of misty, pallored figures, and then, quickly taking its place, Draco’s own.
"You know what's uncomfortable," says Ron, "is this conversation."
Draco sneers. He’s not
“What the fuck?” says Harry. “How much time do you spend here?”
The response takes Draco completely by surprise. He'd known that Harry would do as he said, and talk to the Ministry, and he knows that everyone there essentially worships the ground his ghastly trainers walk on. But still. He hadn't held any conscious hope that Potter would be able to help him. He's beyond help, isn't he?
“You're here at your leisure, gentleman of leisure,” Harry says. Malfoy’s drink is nice and bitter and lemoney and strong. “Speaking of, what the fuck
Draco’s eyes fall to Potter’s hand on the crease of his shirt. His fingers, long and with a slightly crooked pinky, reach almost to the margin of Draco’s clavicle.
Pansy rolls her eyes and says nothing, merely continues scratching her fingers along his scalp, waiting for the real answer. Although the avoidance does seem to indicate something.
can probably be added to the list of the dumbest, most embarrassing, socially inept things Harry’s ever said, right up there with whatever he’d blurted into Cho’s face after being rejected for the Yule Ball. The kind of thing that will haunt him at two AM and refuse to let him sleep until he’s ruminated over it for most of the night. Perfect. On the other hand, he’s got wank material for pretty much the rest of his life, so. Not the worst trade-off in history.
“I’m not sure how you manage work at the hospital and taking care of this.” Draco speaks out loud without quite meaning to.
“Ngh,” says Draco. “It’s fucking, part of the shit. Part of the 12 Labours.”
By the time Hermione’s realised something’s up and given him a
“Yes,” he says quietly. Not because he believes it, but because Hermione does, and he doesn’t feel like hearing about all the reasons why it’s okay for him to still, five years later, be working through all the leftover trauma. “I don’t hate him, Hermione.”
“So? Do you think I’m with Blaise. It’s just a fuck, what’s the problem?”
Right. That's that, then. Not bothering with his wand, Harry magically plucks the clipboard out from beneath Malfoy's arm and snatches it out of the air. On the other side of the corridor, he opens a door that doesn't have any patient information on the outside.
"Can't be any more delicate than your relationship with reality," Harry retorts, but another look from Hermione stays his hand before he can sling the coat back at Malfoy. While he goes to hang it up he hears Hermione showing Malfoy into the dining room, where she'd spent the last hour putting together a large spread and humming too loudly, which in retrospect Harry thinks he should have found suspicious considering they rarely eat in there even when he has dinner with them.
are the problem. You always have been. And it’s not even your fault — Lucius fucked you up good, didn’t he, Draco? Just don’t let him know you begged me for it. I bet he wouldn’t like that.”
"You said you would," says Draco, determinedly undistracted by the little kiss Potter gives him, "and then I said some awful things to you."
The Great Hall looks completely different then usual, and not just because of the enchanted ceiling that’s conspicuously missing. Three of the tables are gone to free up space and all the eighth-years are spread throughout the Hall, drunk and dancing and chatting and passing around spliffs from Seamus.
Harry tries his hardest not to splutter. “What?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Gods, Potter. For all your assertions that I’m the coward here.”
It's weird still, without Fred. It gets easier not to think about him all day and the pain has numbed out a bit, but it's always weird. And Christmas is the worst.
move on once he feels like the door’s closed on it.”
“Yes, please, right this way. You can take a seat in the waiting area. Ms Parkinson’s just finishing up with a client.”
Draco waves a hand. "He came to Mungo's the other night. Pansy, he thought it was because he wouldn’t let us finish. On the lift.” After a moment, Draco says, “it’s not,” because he thinks Pansy should know that.
Except Draco loses his edge rather quickly, because his spell fizzles just as quickly as Potter's. And now that he thinks about it, and centres himself, he feels rather dim. Stifled. Like someone's holding a pillow down over his magical core.
bit. "What do you call your obsession with me our first five years here, then? Is that stalking too, or something else entirely?"
Never one for these more emotionally-oriented discussions, Harry doesn't quite know what to say. He takes a last hit and offers it to Malfoy. "You wanna fake a last one?"
"Wasn't being funny. Do you think she'd date a Gryffindor?"
Draco thumbs at the waist of Harry's trousers. "Okay," he says. "Thank you."
Harry rolls his eyes and when they land back on Malfoy he says, “We’ll have to figure it out eventually. And just so you know, even if I don’t tell her Hermione will figure it out. Fast.”
Harry glances up instinctively at the sudden movement from Malfoy and regrets it instantly when he sees the shirt under his Healer’s robes ride up.
he’s doing, he’s pretty sure he’s getting what he wants. Which is Slytherin enough for the time being.
people, it all seems so stupid.
“Hm. Of course, you could, but wouldn’t you miss seeing me fucked into complete senselessness?” Draco says. “Cock-drunk?”
"I dunno, do I? He's so ..." Pointy? Prickly? Interesting and impossible and unobtainable and kind of really nice-looking? "I dunno. Like I said, it doesn't matter. He's not interested in figuring anything out between us. There's too much history."
Hesitating a second, Harry asks, “Are you going to tell … your mates?”
“I’m sorry this happened to you,” Harry says in a low voice. “Dumbledore knew. He should’ve done something.”
fucked me up properly, and I shouldn’t tell him I begged. He said that to me.”
Harry blinks again. The not-so-terrible tightness in his chest turns into something extremely, horribly terrible. Humiliation is a word for it. “I —" he says stupidly, still reeling less at Malfoy’s offer and more at the fact of whatever the fuck he had just been
“Potter!” she says enthusiastically. He doesn’t know how successful he is suppressing a frown. “Always hoped I’d run into you round here one day, everyone always says you’re here visiting Granger. Heard about that raid you did last week — nasty business, will he be prosecuted?”
? Are you his keeper?"
“You follow astrology?” Harry says incredulously.
He turns to lean against the counter, and gestures for Harry to pass Rose over to him. Says, a little gruffly, "Love you, mate. Support you whatever you do, yeah? But you don't deserve to be treated like shit, and if Malfoy's still doing that, I'll never think it's a good idea for you to get involved with him."
"Then you can fuck me, and hold my hand while you do it."
Draco, who’s babbling and begging and needs—

So yeah. Harry knows Malfoy is gay.
“That’s it,” Pansy says, moving her hand reverently along the artful curve of the boy’s arse who she’s buried in. Well, the
Harry brushes Draco’s cock with his knuckles, softly enough to retain plausible deniability in the face of an accusation. He is a junior Auror, after all. “Is that a star? (brush) Or a constellation?”
"I can't believe you left her with him," Ron says hotly. "Just to try and convince us he's changed—"
"Withering," he says sardonically. "Right. S'pose you are too then? Only ... hm ... I don't recall you
"My godfather's old house," says Harry. "It's where I'm staying until I find something else. It's in London."
“Forgive me,” says Malfoy. “What would the plebian term be? Flirt?”
Harry's grin disappears and he feels awkward suddenly, too aware of their history and the dark turn things had taken the last two years. He wishes fervently he hadn't said anything. He doesn't want to think, or
of the fault probably lies with Draco. Five years on from Hogwarts they might be but she would have bet a large sum of Galleons that Draco fell seamlessly back into his old habits the moment they were in the same room.
“Go, then,” he tells the boy as he tucks himself away in his tight trousers. “Draco, you owe me.”
“Oh, you’re being harsh,” says Hermione. She can’t tell if this has purely to do with not liking Blewitt or if he’s grumpy because of Harry still. Nor will she ask. “I think he’s lovely. Did he go to Hogwarts, do you know?”
Harry nods. “You did look awfully friendly.”
“T’was but a joke, Potter. I’ve gone home with enough Muggles to know what a taxi is.”
to do with you."
"Because I was such a gem when I was sixteen," Draco says drily.
"Why's that?"
It’s looking at him all cagily through the folds of the little orange (of course, bleh) blanket. It doesn’t trust him, probably, raised in a house constantly inhabited by Gryffindors and Weasleys. Which are synonymous.
"I stopped causing strife and chaos five years ago, dickhead," he says, not without some bite behind it. He's about to rip into Malfoy further but Ron and Hermione come back, and he knows Hermione can tell by the looks on their faces that they've been fighting because she frowns at him sternly. He snatches at a napkin and wipes his hand off, resisting tossing it at Malfoy's head.
“Surprised about what?” he says vaguely. His veins are still singing with an echo of the orgasm.
“Would you like to hold her?”
Watching carefully as Harry's smile falters, Draco says, without much humour, "Oh? Shall I get on my knees?"

“You’re not going to,

Draco rolls off Harry and back into his side. "Come with me tomorrow?"
Ron rather likes knowing things Hermione doesn’t. He especially likes knowing this.
“One would think,” says Draco, “that someone who enjoys a bit of recreational choking wouldn’t get all flushed over what you’ve just told me.”
"You don't
“Shall I spike your tea?” Pansy teases. “Do you need a morale booster, darling?”
“Brilliant.” He shakes his head like he can knock his brain back into place and fumbles for his wand, which he uses to clean his jeans off. When he looks back up at Malfoy he suppresses a troubling urge to kiss him again. “Are you going back to the party?”
“What's wrong, darling?” Pansy says lightly. Blaise rolls his eyes. He’s had quite enough of this.
about the whole thing), he goes to see Ron. Who, yeah, is sort of really biased about Malfoy and might really, literally, non-metaphorically vomit, but it's somehow better than the extreme enthusiasm and support he'd get from Hermione. He's simply not ready for her brand of validation at the moment.
That makes Harry’s stomach do something weird.
“What —”
. Draco says, "You know Keepers. Quick with their hands."
Harry finds out what Ron’s been holding on to after Christmas. When he walks into the common room, Ron’s standing on one side of the couch and looking angry. All red. Standing on the other side of it, and looking even angrier, and not red but an impressive shade of pink, is Malfoy.
"I see," Charlie says. He's heard all manner of things about Draco Malfoy over the years. The kid sounds like a fucking twerp, and, of course, Charlie knows he was a Death Eater. He also knows he was sixteen when he became one, and he really does try to be understanding about these kinds of things. "Drunk, were you?"
The noises don't help but Harry stays resolute. He'll be fucked if his iron will fails him now. "Well?"
Draco’s cock gets valiantly, impressively hard. Blushing, he says, “Yes. Let’s do that.”
Harry closes his eyes and arches and gives into the pull of his body, letting the pleasure turn his insides to liquid and falling gratefully into an orgasm that hits that elusive peak and makes his hips stutter. It’s harder than he’s come in months, completely ridding his body of tension for a few moments as he rides the crest of it and then drifts back down with his limbs tingling a bit. He tugs Charlie down by the shirt into another kiss that’s sloppy while he tries to catch his breath.
Draco squirms slightly. He really hasn’t taken a minute to ask himself what exactly he’s fucking doing until, hm, right now, which isn’t very Slytherin of him at all.
Harry’s not necessarily
"Let me see if I have this right," she says with a grin that feels as feral as it probably looks. "Potter pinned you face-first to the wall of a stalled lift in your place of work and then fucked you without lube?"
. But he's never been good at asking for what he wants. Only demanding. So instead he looks at Potter as steadily as he can, and rolls his hips against his.
“Can I?”
"Naturally," Blaise drawls. "Now, Draco. Spill it. And if we don't deem it significantly more titillating than Potter making you beg for it in a lift, you're getting a time out."
Harry digs it out again and hands it over, then goes back to work getting his cock out and biting back a noise when he gets a hand around himself and squeezes the base.
“Imbecile. What are you doing back there?”
That was also the night that Harry realised he likes blokes. As it turned out, licking tequila off Blaise Zabini’s hip bone really did things for him. It was
“I don’t want to be boyfriends,” says Draco, glaring at the little hitch in Harry’s mouth. “I just want you.”
He says, "Shall we go?"
?” he echoes faintly. “You’re not serious.”
"I knew it," says Harry, "you read my unauthorised biography over the summer, didn't you?"
Harry says “Great” and gestures back towards the centre of the clearing ahead of returning there himself. He sits on the log and finishes off the last of the joint, watching the smoke made visible in the light from the lantern. He’s pretty fucking blazed, which is definitely the only way he can handle being in this place (and he
Harry walks back down the steps and stops just above him, still frowning and at the same time just beginning to acknowledge something low in his stomach that he can identify perfectly fine, except of course that it’s attributed to Malfoy right now. And that’s confusing for a lot of reasons.
.” Harry finds purchase on Draco’s hips, holding tight. Draco tips his head down, forehead sliding against Harry’s and groans. There’s a rustle of skin on fabric, and Draco is fumbling for Harry’s cock in the chink of purple light. He finds it, and strokes, and—
Draco feels rather stripped bare up here. He can’t help but be honest. He says, “If I knew I’d tell you.”
”Ron.”
He nods slowly. “They did. That’s, er, I’m sorry about that.”
Draco adopts tortured expression. “Please don’t talk about Severus when I’m hard.”
“That was brilliant,” Harry says. Malfoy smirks.
and you withhold the details? It’s cruel.”
“‘Bout what?” Harry says obstinately.
“They weren’t your choices,” Harry says. “Not the big ones, anyway.” He laughs bitterly. “We both got fucked over by adults we should’ve been able to trust.”
“This is fucking bollocks,” he mutters. “What the fuck is going on.”
For just a second, sitting on top of him, Harry squeezes Malfoy’s jaw and allows himself to tap into some of that rage he’s always carried with him and only sometimes loses control of. It gets easier every year — with age, he supposes — and maybe that’s why he only squeezes for a second, and not very hard.
"Only if you promise not to get attached," he says. "You're leaving in a few days."
fifteen; he's in fact twenty-three with a flat and a career and a revolving-door of relationships, and if he allows Malfoy to send him reeling back into adolescence with a single (outrageous) gesture then his façade of adulthood will completely unravel. And he can't have that.
Ah, yes. She remembers well the story of McLaggen’s Beater bat but under the circumstances keeps the smirk off her face. “Then what, pray tell, is the problem, Draco? Be a big boy and get off with him, if we’re lucky you’ll break his heart while you’re at it and we can laugh about it for a few weeks.”
Draco says, “Are you serious?”
Harry tightens his grip on Malfoy’s waist when he bites his lip, and he swallows hard. “I s’pose I’m rude then,” he says. He kisses Malfoy’s jaw, just over his pulse, and then his shoulder. “Turn around.”
Draco shrugs elegantly. “Academic curiosity.”
Harry finally stops smirking and stays silent a moment, just watching Malfoy, thinking, contemplating. Finally, he says, “What the hell just happened? Is it my imagination or didn’t we fuck, like, twenty minutes ago?”
“You never come.”
Right. A hard no. The obvious answer. Obviously.
“Oh, shit,” says Ron suddenly, looking past Harry’s shoulder. “Harry ...”
“Or,” Pansy adds, “you can tell Blaise about Potter. Honestly ... I’m surprised with you.”
“So, Potter,” says Malfoy, resting back on his elbows, popping sharp blades of slim shoulders under red fabric. “How is every little thing?”
If Granger had been Draco’s friend before (which, just to reiterate, she was not), she definitely wouldn’t be anymore.
“I just think it was a bad idea, alright?” Ron says testily. “I know you wouldn’t risk her wellbeing, Hermione, but it’s
“Fioncey. Fuck you,” says Drunk Ron. And then, instead of pulling Harry back into his chest, he drops him altogether and starts gesturing wildly towards the bar.
“I don’t think about them very often,” says Draco.
listening, actually, but this time she refrains from any teasing or talk of casual fucking. She knows Draco's having a very real internal struggle over this and she wishes more than anything she could do something concrete to help, but there isn't much short of paying Potter off to either corner Draco and fuck him or disappear to another country.
“Good boy,” Harry says. He’s probably as pleased as Draco is, when he sinks his mouth onto his cock and pushes his finger back in till the knuckle. Well, perhaps not quite, judging by the way Draco cries desperately and squirms down onto his finger, but almost. He does love sucking Draco’s cock. Loves taking him apart and feeling the warm, wet heat of Draco’s arse around his fingers.

spent most of my life getting whatever I wanted.”
He recounted the previous evening’s events, and Pansy said: "Surely you're used to your little crush being unrequited by now."
Harry’s stomach clenches painfully with arousal. “Shit,” he mutters, pulling his fingers out and fumbling with his jeans. “Fuck, shouldn’t we … I don’t have a condom. And don’t we need … need lube or something?”
Malfoy looked up. Harry thought maybe he hadn’t even realised who it was that was standing over him. “Potter,” said Draco, and stretched his legs back out.
“You remember my trial, don’t you.”
“Nghhh,” Draco moans.
Stop biting your lip. Stop cocking your hip like that. Why the fuck did you have to put
It suddenly makes so much sense why Hermione’s been twitchy all evening, which actually, frankly, only makes Harry more irritated. She’s had hours to warn him, give him a chance to get the hell out and leave Ron to suffer by himself. He supposes Hermione had been worried Ron would bolt too, and it makes sense logically, but he still doesn’t understand why the fuck she bothered inviting Malfoy to dinner if she doesn’t want to do it herself.
"Seamus, you idiot," Dean scolds him. Harry pauses with his fork halfway to his mouth and frowns at him.
“Relax, Potter,” Malfoy drawls. Harry doesn’t like it when he drawls. Or really does. Either way, it makes his skin feel several measures too tight. “Your virtue is safe with me. We’re just dancing.”
“That’s not really what I meant.”
“My, Potter,” he says. “Once a coincidence, twice a habit.”
“A minute’s warning,” says Ron under his breath, “
He turns in Harry’s arms. He’s pressed against Harry’s chest.

pace, especially when it gets Malfoy to breathily admit things like how good it feels to have Harry's fingers in his arse.
“Nn,” Draco says, a moue of protest. “
“Draco,” says Draco.
“Right. Right, we’ll do that,” says Hermione. She pushes the sleeves of her cardigan up to her elbows. Presses a palm to her forehead. “Although...”
It’s like the old Malfoy went to France and a new one came back, one that he absolutely cannot get a reading on. Although to be fair, he supposes, maybe he never really had a reading on Malfoy in the first place. He tries to remember the last time he was alone with him and thinks, with a jolt, that it was sixth year in that bathroom.
— does he feel the lift suddenly begin vibrating. He's so drunk on the feeling of his cock being completely sheathed in Malfoy's body that it takes the lift actually moving for him to realise what's going on.
with Draco, so there. “Why?”
"Sure." The plant nuzzling itself against Malfoy's cheek starts going for his ear again, so Harry reaches out and moves it himself. He just barely pulls his hand back before it starts twining itself around his fingers. "Do you have another lesson after this one?"

Draco wants to ask (sarcastically of course) if it’s better than fucking the She-Weasel, but rather quickly thinks better of it. Instead, he lets his shoulders slide forward, arching his back so he can feel Potter’s cock properly inside him. “You can go faster,” says Draco.
She says, "Salazar. I only request you keep a slight distance where possible, until he sets himself right again. You may not believe he's delicate, fine, but know that as capable as he seems, Draco's never been good at taking care of himself. He lets things consume him, without intervention. I've seen it too many times. I won't see it again."
He’s coming, and Harry’s teeth are grazing over his jaw. He’s coming, hot and messy between them, and Potter’s still fucking mercilessly up into him. He’s coming, he’s blind with it, and Potter’s spunk is leaking out of him.
("It's like he won't break up with her for his own pride," Hermione said, around a year and a half in. Harry had been very stormy when he arrived after dinner, with big, dark circles under his eyes. He kept cracking his neck, and said it was hurting because he'd slept on the couch. He caught their look at that, and stormed out again without even drinking his tea.
It's easy to forget it's Christmastime around the Manor, what with the lack of any festive decorations. Once upon a time it had been Narcissa's very favourite holiday, especially when Draco was a baby. He'd loved the lights, and so they had had the house-elves fill nearly every room and corridor with them for his amusement. There was always a grand tree in the drawing room that they decorated as a family, the three of them, and a smaller tree in Draco's room that he'd been allowed to decorate with whatever he wanted.
“You what?” he says.
Hermione nods. She’s always thought Harry had a bit of a self-destructive streak. She could see it even in school, when he went after Cho, whose boyfriend had just died, and Ginny, who was his best friend’s sister. Harry doesn’t often think about protecting himself, and he never listens to Hermione when she tries to do it for him. “It’s a pattern,” she says. “But I don’t know, I don’t think we can talk him out of this.”
Let the pair of them believe what they want, he’ll tell them at dinner and have them both choking on their chardonnay.
Draco says, “It’s no trouble, Potter.” He shrugs off his coat and tosses it onto Potter’s outstretched forearms. “I find enriching the lives of the culturally inept to be incredibly rewarding. Mind the wool, will you? It’s delicate.”
"We can talk about it when you're sober."
“Like,” says Harry. Frost on a Quidditch pitch. Milky tea in his favourite cup. Clouds. New sheets. A window mantled in rain. “Diluted piss.”
There’s a sky in Draco’s living room. Not a proper one, but not
"If you'd let me
It’s hard, but Harry ignores the whine. He could have told Malfoy he sounds like a child throwing a tantrum but chooses the higher ground, simply because he’s just not in the fucking mood. Not when he’s still on the uncomfortable side of semi-hard.
“You only say that because you’re still shitty that waiter turned you down.” Draco pats Blaise placatingly on one of his elegant shoulders as they descend the stairs to Venus’ main floor. “You never did handle a bruised ego very well,” he says.
Charlie sighs and drops his neck back so he can watch Harry from the ground. "Don't be stroppy with me. I'm only here for a few days, sit a minute."
“Including you,” Harry adds. “Your wand worked really well for me. In retrospect I s’pose it’s because you trusted me.”
After a moment, Draco looks down at himself with a frown.
"I'm not sure what you mean, under my wing," she says curtly. "He's very capable. Surely you know that."
"At what point," says Draco, "is it more prudent to simply eat the grounds right out of the bag? I’ve always wondered.”
“What ever have I done now?”
Fuck, his face has gone red. He can feel it and he
Kissing. Kissing and touching. Feeling. Tasting. Now.
here tomorrow?” Harry echoes, laughing incredulously. “What does that mean?”
Shrugging slightly, Harry says, “S’pose not.” And then, after staring at Malfoy’s mouth for a second and trying to process the idea it had been on his dick a minute ago, he adds, “So what now? Do we go back to normal tomorrow?”
Abruptly, Draco stands. “Don’t make me ill.”
at me like that, I'm being serious — we ended up. Slightly pinned against the wall."
Malfoy narrows his smokey eyes in a way that says get-that-shit-eating-grin-off-your-face-right-this-minute-you-twerp. When it doesn’t work at all, he sighs, and says, “I shan’t ever live that down.”
) and that’s horrifying in a different way, all he can think right now it’s that it’s another person, thank god.
Harry's sluggish brain gives up entirely when Malfoy licks his palm and then takes his fingers into his mouth. Between that and the come on his chest and the way Malfoy barely gags when Harry presses his fingers towards the back of his tongue, he feels like he could get hard again dangerously fast. So he reluctantly takes them out and replaces them with his mouth, kissing him slowly and trailing wet fingers along Malfoy's cheek. Afterwards, several minutes later, he climbs off of him finally and takes his wand out to spell them clean.
“Something’s wrong,” he says. He tries to cast a Patronus to send a message to Hermione and only manages a wisp of smoke. The sudden suppression of his magic — and being trapped with Malfoy in a six-by-six lift — makes him so tense and anxious he can feel sweat starting to bead on the back of his neck. He attempts a wandless Cooling Charm that doesn’t do much more than create a crackle of magic that dissipates quickly. Worrying. Extremely worrying.
Draco bangs a hand on Pansy's desk, which earns him a stern look. "My point exactly. Of course, Potter was far too concerned with being seen and losing some of that glorious moral superiority he so likes to lord over us all. Like he hasn't got his fucking dark sides. Which does remind me, Pansy dearest, of perhaps the most interesting thing I discovered during our little interlude."
Harry lets out a bark of surprised laughter. "What, so you were strutting around with that stupid fucking badge by day and then taking it up the arse at night? Nice."
"Ah, ah," Harry lilts. "Thought we established I'm the one giving commands right now. What happened, Malfoy, you used to be a quick learner in school, didn't you?" But he dips his fingers between Malfoy's arse cheeks, and the grip on his waist strengthens when he feels his tight little hole. Slowly, he presses the tip of his middle finger inside and then stops. "Your hands," he says. "On the wall. Where I can see them."
“Er, no, thank you.”
“You’re a menace,” Draco complains, but it’s slightly breathless.
“Why?”
The study was an impressive effort, Harry thinks, for his current state of intoxication. Thirty percent alcohol, seventy percent Draco scrabbling to pull his trousers over his knickers as Harry ducked them under the velvet ropes strung across the arch and Apparated them to his flat.
“Oh?” Draco resigns himself to his fate, and takes a tentative sip of wine. The bloody drama queen.
“But you—" Draco clears his throat. “But you do. You said I was evil.”
for the silken feel of Draco’s bare, pale skin.
At least he'd the foresight to bring Pansy with him.
“Granger didn’t seem too worried. Or, you know. Any more than usual.”
Still setting his jumper straight, Harry lifts an eyebrow. His stomach suddenly feels weird again. With no anticipatory orgasm to focus on, his brain is free to think of things. Like how he’d told Malfoy he likes him, and they’d fucked, and now that has to be dealt with. “Hoops,” he echoes. “Right. Thought so. Care to expand?”
“Invited Draco over for dinner,” she repeats, sternly this time, as if they’d already said something that annoyed her. “We’re working together now, as I’ve already told you, and he’s been very pleasant and I told him it would be nice to catch up and go over some things during dinner. You two, and
“Yeah.”
Interesting.
?” Harry echoes with a laugh. His brow furrows and he looks at Malfoy searchingly, trying to find something in his expression that’ll give meaning to that statement. He thinks of sixth year, of ordering Kreacher and Dobby to tail him, and grins to himself.
He says, “You’re right, I should let it out. Tell me what you’d like me to do instead.”
Fuck, fuck. “When has incandescent rage ever gotten you anywhere, Potter? I’m
"Yes, of course," says Hermione. "And you better not. Or I'll set Molly on you."
easy, but he's not quite lust-clouded enough yet (like, apparently, Malfoy) to ignore what a terrible idea it would be.
"Oh? Looking to do a bit of home wrecking, Pans? You always did like the virtuous ones."
“There is spunk,” Draco murmurs, “everywhere.”
She softened after some coffee, thought, and told Draco what he wanted to hear: "Potter's an idiot, he's a dickhead, birds wouldn't nest in his ratty fucking hair."
“I was distracted,” Harry defends himself sulkily. Pushes Terry off him. “You’re such a prat, I’m letting you die next time you fumble your wand.”
“No,” says Harry, ignoring the part of himself insisting Malfoy's right, he's got major fucking issues, he's a completely broken person, “
“Yes, yes, Harry, fuck me, yes.”
“Then
“Those being?”
“That’s enough, Draco,” Narcissa says sharply. It makes her throat feel tight with panic. She looks across the room at her snapdragons, away from the mark on his face. “Please. Accusing your father of — to say such a thing — it’s
“You. And Malfoy. He’s coming this way.” Scratch that, Drunk Ron is an absolute menace. Harry wishes death upon him and his kin.
It doesn’t seem altogether fair to Harry, that Draco can simply say words like that with a voice
So it's quite the internal contradiction when he once more ventures out onto the Astronomy Tower. Having been back only two or three times since he first met Potter there, Draco rather misses the quiet, removed stillness that comes with being up a little higher. A sense of more complete alone-ness that feels safe rather than lonely. And, as much as he tells himself he's justified in thinking Potter won't be there, and he's glad for that fact, Draco can't help imaging Harry watching his footsteps mirrored in ink, tracing them with his finger.
"Let's talk," Harry says. His tone is falsely light, suggesting that it won't stay that way long if Malfoy tries to argue.
Harry twists a hand down to find Draco’s and pulls the delicate wrist
"You know what I mean." He didn't. Couldn't, really. "I just can't stop ... thinking about it? But that's why I'm telling you. That's how atonement works, right? You confess, it goes away?"
,” Draco hisses, when Harry seats himself further — and beautiful, and if his mouth around Harry’s fingers was hot and tight and velvet, then his arse is a fucking vice laid with silk, clutching impossibly tighter.
? Quit looking and worry about the wine you’ve just been whingeing about endlessly.”
, and Canis Minor,” Draco chokes out, throwing his arms above his head and writhing his hips. Harry finds his prostate and strokes gently, first with one finger, then — “shit, wanna come, please, n-northern facing” — with two, drawing his mouth off just enough to circle Draco’s weeping slit and — “Harry! Going to, fuck — f-follows the hunter, shit, Orion” — taking him back down to the base.
“Yes, hello Dominique,” Draco says, and drops his robes on her desk as he passes. “I’d love to have a chat, but I really must speak with Ms Parkinson. She in? Lovely.”
Draco grabs her arm. Pansy slaps his hand with her heaviest ring, but he holds on. "Unhand me, Draco."
“You made me
He’d spent the rest of the summer with Pansy in Provence.
When he kisses him this time it’s not like last time, which had been full of uncertainty and anger. He’s surer now and he spends less time thinking, more time feeling. This kiss is slow and deliberate and he pays attention to the way Malfoy tastes (bitter tobacco, and something else underneath that doesn't have a name), the textures on the inside of his mouth, the little sounds he makes. Harry's voice is rough when he pulls away to say, “Let’s go inside somewhere, it’s fucking freezing.”
Harry would wonder if Draco had had anything to drink at all, if he hadn’t watched his pale throat work with each sip. “I think he might’ve been intimidated by the coif.”
Draco frowns. He feels blindly for Harry's cock, hard in his jeans. "Recalcitrant. Kiss me."
Something more than sympathy makes Harry feel a little sick. He knows what it is, too, without even needing to analyse it. It's Narcissa's betrayal as a mother that sickens him.
“It’s the sky,” he says, and then bites his lip, because he knows what’s coming and— yeah, Draco’s mouth is curling into a smirk already. Fuck.
“That’s the only reason, is it?” Harry laughs.
Draco wishes Potter would learn at least a modicum of stealth. It's almost obscene how little effort he takes to keep every thought he's ever had from playing across his face. He says, "How empowering."
Draco’s incredibly relieved when Potter doesn’t say anything about the scars, and then immediately distracted by the frotting of his hard cock against Draco’s own. He moans, takes Harry’s jaw in his hands and kisses him again.
“I am,” says Draco. He doesn’t think he could explain the hesitance to Potter if he tried. “Thank you, really.”
Draco frowns. “
to get back to normal. Pick himself up.”
Draco pushes himself up to lean against the buttress behind him. "I'm not interested in being fuck buddies."
Trying his best not to smirk, Draco says, “Sometimes Theo. Mostly Blaise.”
Narcissa sighs at the cold tone she’s met with. Draco had been capable of terrible brattiness when he was a child; he maintained icy silences for impressive spans of time, threw tantrums that made chandeliers fall from ceilings. But this is chillingly different. This is not a child’s tantrum but an adult’s resentment. After a moment, she stands and goes around the table, puts a gentle hand on Draco’s reddened cheek and pulls him against her breast. His hair is as soft as it was when he was a baby. The feel of it causes a tear to slip past her closed lids.
It's strange to know what Malfoy tastes like. What the skin of his hip, usually covered by clothing, feels like. It's not only Malfoy that's new, either: Harry's never so much as given more than a cursory thought to kissing a bloke, let alone
Pansy gets an arm round Draco's waist and Apparates them directly into his bathroom. It seems easiest, given how drunk he is.
When Potter catches him, Draco says, "Cunt."
When he hops off he lets the broom fall into the snow and looks at Charlie, cold hands in his pockets. "You know, I'm not seeing Nat anymore," he blurts out. And he's glad his cheeks are already red from the wind and the cold. "They probably told you."
“Oh fuck,” Draco moans, rocking back on Harry’s fingers, which feel even better inside him then they’d looked on his cock. “Fuck, fuck. Fuck me.”
"No," Harry says instantly, without any thought involved. His stomach lurches horribly. His face is hot. The thought of it has occurred to him in the last few days, sort of like a theoretical concept, a strange and impossible and not-very-comfortable abstract idea that he doesn't linger on because it feels wrong, somehow. And he doesn't even know what the fuck that would look like. "This is why I don't wanna talk about it, I don't
Draco frowns against Harry's cheek. "Please tell me the two are unrelated," he says.
“I speak only the truth,” says Harry, nudging Draco’s hard cock. “I have evidence to back me up.”
“That’s a great question,” Harry says, grinning. “I’m simply doomed to be common as we’ve established my name suggests.”
,” he thinks Draco mutters.
He's starting to feel shagged out, utterly fucked, the way he usually feels when he's getting properly boffed, or giving a proper boffing. And Potter hasn't even touched his bare cock yet. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
A breeze picks up and for a moment Harry can smell Malfoy on it. Some expensive cologne, probably. It's kind of nice.
Naturally, Draco’s bum is as smooth and sculpted as the rest of him. Tight and soft under Harry’s hand as he presses the pads of his fingers into the cool, bare skin, and—
“Could you not be so fucking cavalier about this?” Draco snaps, standing once again. “The
Malfoy, but it's mostly him. There've been rumours of something going on in northern England near Manchester that he and Terry and a small team of Aurors have been investigating and it's been more and more time-consuming by the day, yet Malfoy still manages to be the number one thing causing Harry the most stress. Perhaps that's because his whole childhood had gotten him used to the stress of Dark Magic and dangerous situations and being hunted by lunatics, whereas he's never really dealt before with any sort of complicated relationship between himself and someone who was once his enemy, for lack of a less melodramatic word, and whom he now is having ... whatever. Feelings?
Draco struggling to pull in air. “Is it hard to think without oxygen?” Harry retorts.
Draco says, with a sympathetic click of his teeth, “It can be hard to think when you’re rock hard.”
"Draco and I are very good friends," Hermione says with too much resentment, which she then tries to tone back. "And Harry and I are not attached at the hip. I'm also worried about what happened between them — maybe it would be good for us to talk about it — but you can't possibly expect me to stop being friends with him because of it. That's ridiculous."
The space between them empty, Harry slots his cock against Draco’s with ease. It’s—oh, fuck, it’s hard, pulling his loose trousers taught.
going to do this, and Harry is
Oh. How brilliant. “You did, didn’t you?” Harry prods. “You read it!”
Again, Pansy laughs. And again, she lets it build until it’s echoing in the chilly night air and people are looking. She slings an arm around Draco’s waist and plants a kiss on his cheek.
It takes about fifteen minutes, but Rose finally falls asleep in her crib upstairs and when Harry returns to the kitchen, Malfoy's not there anymore. He finds him instead in the living room with a book, looking uncomfortably soft.
“Jolly good,” Malfoy said, and sort of floated away.

“No, then,” Draco says. “And that’s hardly the point.”
, Draco wants to say. He doesn’t, because he’s got this
bedraggled, thanks. The Auror robes are in fact so pompous and stuffy he sometimes thinks he might have to quit the force just so he
"Thanks," Harry says, taking it from him. It's an old copy with not much in the way of cover art, just the title and author, and he thinks that suits Malfoy. "Feel like telling me where you were?"
“Probably jaunting off to Skeeter’s office to give her our address, or something.”
Draco looks up at him. “Perhaps there are some hoops,” he says.
The cloak is oddly heavy, and more slippery than Draco would have imagined. Almost like liquid metal, more than fabric. It's disorienting to not be able to see his feet, which makes him trip a little on his way through the portrait hole.
“I want to give it to you, pet,” he says. “Wanna make you fucking squeal.”
. Obviously.”
Unfortunately, he seems to want other things more. He wishes Pansy were here. She'd give him a proper scolding and remind him never to trust his own instincts (because they're completely useless), and then take him home and get him drunk enough to forget he ever did something so stupid.
“Come for me, then.”
“Work,” Draco says. He shrugs, which probably looks like some display of bored indifference to Potter (
overpriced, or c) a total shitehole. Malfoy is there a lot. He sits behind the bar when Blaise is working and reads. He sits at the bar when Pansy is working and chats. He sniffs and tosses his blond head when he sees Harry, and pretends he isn’t there.
“I’d stare at
Harry smiles. “Hippogriffs,” he says. “Scary.”
“You could always change it,” Draco offers. “I could pick you a new one.”
?” Mystifying. Completely captivating. She sits up a little straighter. “From start to finish, if you don’t mind. Where in the world did you manage this?”
“Ever been in the kitchens before?”
Startled, Narcissa pats Draco’s back until he seems to have moved past the episode. “Darling, are you alright?”
Harry’s being stubborn. He should’ve expected it. “What’re you saying? You want to start things back up between us?”
They had, though. Charlie told Harry he didn't want a boyfriend. That he'd be going back to Romania before the end of the year. Harry said that was okay, because neither did he.
(“Ron, mate, for fucks sake, what?”
Harry's stomach twists into a weird knot and he shrugs. “Would you?” he repeats.
Hermione’s one for talking about feelings, never letting things fester, so Ron’s spent a lot of time pondering the distortion of time after grief with her. To him, that first year after the battle stretched out interminably, and those after that, with the wedding, the pregnancy, a literal, actual child, have gone very quickly indeed.
“—honest discussion, and you’re behaving like a child! Ignore him, Ron. Just whisper it.”
Releasing one of his wrists, Harry instead wraps a hand around Malfoy’s cock. He’s in no state to do a good job of it and moves his hand with jerky motions, graceless, unpracticed, and earnest. “I’m gonna come,” he says breathlessly, “do you want me to pull out?”
Draco says, "We shall see."
“Then we want the other one,” says Blaise. “Where you’re begging for cock in a stalled lift.”
Draco stirs his coffee with his pinky. “No secret about it,” he says.
He turns to the child, nestled in her basinet beside the kitchen table. "What now?"
,” he whines. “I can’t, Harry.”
Skipping past the warm little twist he feels as Potter hands over his wand without hesitation, Draco manoeuvres himself around. He feels a little ridiculous Casting on his own ass, but it’s well worth it when he gives the wand back to Potter and feels a hard cock against his now slicked hole.
"I have plenty of leverage," Harry says darkly. "They know better than to start fighting me like the old Ministry did. That didn't work out well for them."
“You don’t need to— I’m not gonna sit,” said Harry.
He gracefully ignores the jab about his parents, partially because it’s completely true but also because he doesn’t wish to talk about them any further. Had he been fifteen, or sixteen, his father’s reaction would have been no surprise, and his mother’s compliance a hurtful but predictable betrayal. However, after the events of the last year, Draco had briefly entertained the delusion that priorities may have shifted.
"I don't hate you," Harry says quietly. It would be easier, probably. But he doesn't. If he did, he thinks he probably would've fucked off by now. "I haven't in a long time. I don't know what you told Hermione, but that wasn't a hate fuck to me. I'm not like that."
“Half. Shut up. You’re a horrible student, you know.”
“I see,” Narcissa says with a brave attempt at enthusiasm. It’s not that she doesn’t want to know, because she very much
Harry sits down at the table, still holding Rose while she sucks her thumb next to his ear, and he watches Malfoy as he goes about making the tea. He'd expected to see him again at some point considering Hermione's his biggest fan now but not just the two of them, and certainly not under these circumstances. Harry wishes fervently he was less attractive.
"That's different," says Harry sarcastically, going to join Draco at the row of sinks. "I haven't felt comfortable around her since fourth year when she spied on me in the fucking Prefects' bath."
"Just ask me about Malfoy, Gin," he says. "I know Hermione's told you."
. Was that on the syllabus at Hogwarts? I don’t remember studying it in Astronomy, somehow. Granted, I didn’t pay
joking. And Harry is very politic these days. He clears his throat instead.
He’d only told Pansy (not Blaise; he’s not that masochistic), who had said ‘Do you want me to pretend I’m surprised?’.
This time Harry actually squeezes, digging his fingers in and pressing up against Draco’s windpipe, effectively cutting off a good portion of airflow. He’s a little worried about hurting him but not enough to let up yet, not even with the way he can actually
“Shut up,” Ron says, because George is right, and he is tired. Last year he’d stayed up with Hermione because she was going through the worst of her pregnancy nausea, and then been so out of sorts the next morning that he received an Official Scolding from his mum. But that’s neither here nor there. “Move your feet so I can sit.”
"I could never kill a snake," Draco protests. "They're my spirit animal."
Harry scoffs. “What kind of a garbage aphorism is that? Gratitude can just be gratitude, Malfoy, not everyone thinks in terms of favours and debts. You’re
"I know," George says, trying for a light tone. "Just been thinking about how it's five Christmases without him. Feels like longer, doesn't it?"
Draco shakes his sleeve back over the Mark but leaves his hand palm up between them. Potter, in some weird duality, is both the last and the first person Draco would expect to be so forgiving. Draco kind of hates him for it. He says, “I appreciate the sympathy Harry, and I’m actually not being sarcastic, but I know what I've done,” he says.
"Because," Draco says, trying to grit it out but whining it instead. "It's
"The point is," says Harry loudly, "don't be morons. It's so easy."
Percy says, “I’ll be upstairs,” mutters something about immaturity and juvenile squabbling, and excuses himself from the table.
The thing is, as much as he wants to know, Harry’s rather afraid to ask, lest he be subjected to further detailed description of the sequel to his traumatic stay at the (extremely cramped, and he’s never noticed how thin the walls really are) Burrow.
to shine a
"Come," she says, taking Draco's hand and helping him out of the bath. She gives him his robe, leads him to his room, and fetches a Sobering Solution from his stock, which she brings to him in bed. Once he's downed the whole thing she lets him cuddle up to her with her hand back in his hair.
“Harry Potter. Can’t just have a whacking cock, you’ve got to go around performing wandless, wordless spells without even realising. Because you’re horny, nonetheless.” Draco squeezes his ankle (it’s supposed to be scolding, probably.) “Ridiculous behaviour.”
“Well you’ve got no room to complain then, have you?”
The fourth time they spoke was at a party by the Lake. Seamus organised them every couple of weeks, but Harry didn’t go to many of them. Ron and Hermione did, and it was when they started saying that Malfoy always came and he was heaps of fun that Harry decided to give it a whack.
? As if you’d have the stomach for it, love. You do the dosing, I’ll get my hands dirty.”
"Quit trying to fuck him, Pansy."
Fuck. Oh, god. “Want that,” Harry manages. The tilt of Draco’s arms has dragged the hem of his t-shirt higher — out of the frantic press of bodies on the dance floor, Harry can see the skin he's felt. Red cotton and slouching grey wool skirting taught, slight muscles under pale, sweat slicked skin. God. Merlin.
“You’re not listening to me”
than that, though. Erm — it was Malfoy, actually. Got stuck with him in a lift at Mungo's when the Stifling happened." He pauses, sheepishly scratching the back of his head, and takes advantage of Ron's shocked silence to add, "We didn't finish, though. That's something, right?"
“Well. Maybe.”
“Just give it to me now. Seriously.”
"Mm," Draco says in acquiescence. Another lopsided pull jerks Draco forwards by the hips, but Harry's hand is tight and wet and he keeps swiping his thumb over the head of Draco's cock in a way that makes his knees weak.
"You want me ... what?" says Harry. "Use your words, Malfoy."
Sometimes when he can't sleep Harry pulls out the map. It's soothing, tracing paths through familiar corridors and seeing the names of sleeping students, staff who are awake and walking around, even Filch and Mrs. Norris. Sometimes he finds Hagrid wandering the grounds or clusters of ghosts who must be having gatherings. McGonagall never paces the office the way Dumbledore did.
He's getting too close, and some part of Harry wants to toy with Malfoy a little bit too. Maybe to see how desperate he can get. So Harry slows down, rocking into him instead of pounding, and bends to press a series of kisses along his shoulders. "I wanna see your face," he says. "Can we move to the floor?"
.” He lifts his eyebrows. “Question is, would it’ve worked? Did you hate me enough?”
"Well," she says. "I think that's everything. I told you where her nappies are, right?"
, and the Ministry's still the fucking same. "So they have your wand," he confirms in a low voice. "The Ministry."
When Harry releases his wrists, he trails a hand down across Draco’s cheek. Draco beckons it to his mouth with a tilt of his head and licks a stripe up the swell of Harry’s palm, letting two fingers between his lips to fuck lazily over his tongue. Slick and slurred around Potter’s fingers, he says, “Good."
“Yes,” Harry says dully. He’s still trying not to look at Malfoy. Thankfully the witch seems to take a hint, because she lifts her eyebrows and says nothing else until she gets off on the next level.
A small sigh of relief and she stands up, straightening her dress. “You will stay for Christmas lunch tomorrow, won’t you, Draco?” She hesitates, and then adds, “For me. It would mean so much.”
“No.” Malfoy is rather preoccupied. Evidently the shots are part of a larger scheme which involves. Erm. Leaning back on bars (Malfoy) and slurping tequila from exposed navels (dark-haired bloke).
“Utter tosh,” Draco says, waving his hand and imagining Potter’s little you’re-evil-and-always-will-be comment being battered to pieces. “You pop a fucking stiffy whenever you
Klaus meows again, probably meaning 'no,' and also to convey that he feels it's a shitty excuse. Following that he actually bites Harry's leg and then sprints away like a wild animal towards the kitchen. Harry's shout of "you little arsehole!" of course means nothing to him.
Harry tries not to be disappointed. He also tries to remind himself that it would have been stupid anyway, to let himself get carried away on New Years and shag Charlie. Fun to think about, but dumb. And unrealistic. Charlie’s like Ginny: they both have that dominating sense of logic that overrides even their strongest emotions and allows them to make good decisions in the heat of the moment.
Harry's head tips back against the wall, eyes squeezing shut as he feels the hot press of Malfoy's mouth on his cock through the thin fabric of his pants. His hand goes to his head, curling his fingers in Malfoy's prissy blond hair. "Fancy yourself good at this?" he says in a strained attempt at sarcasm.
“What?” he frowns. “Is that obvious, or something?”
“I do not.” Draco stands and levitates his mug over to the sink. “I don’t. You’re the ones who are horribly chatty, you ask him. And then polish off a Galleon.”
“Sounds like Potter,” Pansy says grimly. “What a prick. I don’t think it helps Draco’s been hanging round Granger outside of work. That’s the only reason he saw Potter today and I’m sure that’s why he’s all worked up about it again.” She pauses, then says, a little hesitantly, “Maybe we should tell Granger to, you know ... back off a bit.”
Harry sits down once again and pulls Draco between his legs, back to chest. “Of course not.”
“I didn’t
He mewls and wants to leave it at that, but he knows Potter will insist on words, so he forces out a “Yes, move.”
He releases Draco again. “Come, Draco,” Harry says, and takes him back into his mouth.
“What do you mean?”
Draco wants to say ‘I unclench every weekend when Blaise fucks me up the arse’, but instead he gives a chagrined little smile and takes the joint out of Potter’s hands.
She thinks that little comment is meant to include her as well, and if so, Hermione lets it pass without acknowledgment. She’s better than rising to Pansy Parkinson’s bait.
“Right,” he says. He stands and offers his hand out to help Charlie up as well. “S’pose we should probably go back. Your mum’s gonna be pissed.”
“Do it anyway,” Draco says, feeling half out of his mind with wanting. “Do it, Potter, get it in me, now.”

Really, it could have been worse, though. They haven't even acknowledged each other yet in the month they've been back, and frankly it's been kind of weird.
already), he reaches back to hold himself open for the cock that’s teasing his cleft, only to have his wrists grasped so hard that the pointy outer bones thud against one another.
"What do you mean 'for good'?" he says slowly. "And what do you mean 'warnings,' there are no warnings, Seamus. If the Aurors come, that's your warning."
“I’m so glad you said that, Harry. I was looking for a reason to chunder all over the floor.”
"I am not, and fuck you some more, you absolute horror. That's
"Not long, probably," says Draco. "I can't believe you did that for me."

wasn’t lovely and soft and tender? I’m fairly certain they could’ve puzzled that one out for themselves, even the Weasel. No, for whatever reason, you can't seem to stay away, so you keep inventing these piss-weak causes to come and bother me.
Malfoy’s frown clears into a purposefully bored expression. He glances over Harry’s shoulder. “Book?”
A low blow, perhaps. Malfoy's plenty talented — clearly — but he's fucking irritated, all right? It's not the enclosed space (cupboard, stairs) but rather the suppression of his magic. He hates feeling powerless, especially around Draco sodding Malfoy.
Draco's leaning towards the latter, and also Pansy, who slides an arm around his waist to keep him from swaying. Perhaps he's drunker than he thought.
them,” Draco corrects.
“Question,” says Harry, groaning softly with the effort of pulling his gaze from Draco’s arse. “What was the question?”
Charlie says, “We were catching up. Reminiscing, you know,” and George snorts a laugh and whacks Ron on the back of the head.
Harry doesn’t think it politic to tell Malfoy he wasn’t
“No.”
“Twas easy.”
, Malfoy,” and lines his cock up. He doesn’t quite know where the utter boldness has come from but it hardly seems to matter as he’s sinking once again inside Malfoy’s body, only then returning his hand to his throat and gripping firmly.
"No," he says tightly. He lifts his head and meets Malfoy's eyes. "Not until you tell me."
Harry nods.
It's nice to know that Luna is still completely batty. Hermione's friends with Malfoy, and Harry wants to fuck him, and Pansy Parkinson walks up to them in pubs and starts talking about sex, but some things never change.
Again, they're in a

) erection.
"So. D'you reckon Harry and Charlie shagged?"
Still, festive or not, this ancestral home is a luxury and he is, as ever, glad to lord over it. Especially when his son is home, as he has not been for some time. With a bit of luck, he thinks he may still be able to salvage what's left of his son and heir.
"Shit," says Draco, not realising what he'd said until Potter comes closer. Asks. Fuck. "Will it quell your fervent hard-on for morality if I mollof–mollify your conscience? You're forgiven, Potter. I don't give a shit. Fuck off."
since that whole affair. Tell Blaise, won’t you? It’s absolutely delicious.”
The blankets are making snuffly little noises, and Draco can see a  pink cheeked face nestled at the centre.
“It’s your life,” Draco says, rather stunned. Perhaps there’s a part of him that still refuses to accept the extent of Potter’s good-ness, that wants to believe everything he’s done stemmed from desires not entirely altruistic. Possibly, it’s because he’s never done well when confronted with his own moral failings, but possibly, it’s because he simply doesn’t understand it. Draco doesn’t think he has it in him to be selfless.
“Thanks ever so,” Malfoy says.
Draco scoffs. His head lolls against the desk, legs bent at the knees, arms laying boneless at his sides. “You exaggerate.”
“Mm, yes.”
Klaus says nothing, probably because it's a stupid question. Harry flips onto his side, staring into the dark, and thinks that maybe next time they go to the pub and some bird tries talking to him he should give her a chance.
“It’s not even twelve yet!”
It’s shocking, really. Harry stares at him, angry and exasperated and guilty, and finally lets out a laugh of disbelief. He lifts his glasses, presses his fingers into his eyes. “All right. Fine. Sure. Let’s talk out here, then. D’you mind telling me what fucking planet you’re living on where it’s okay to discuss you and I
Draco flicks his unlit cigarette to the ground and says, quite seriously, “Enough with all the earnest prattling. Just kiss me like a normal person.”
Draco huffs in incredulous disbelief. Just where the fuck does Potter get off talking to him like he’s a misbehaving first year. “I‘ve no obligation to explain myself to you. We hate each other, we’ve always hated each other. Lines were blurred, that’s all there is to it.”
“Seriously, Hermione, you couldn’t’ve given us slightly more notice —?”
She understands that Draco needs this, and in many ways so does she. Being a mother brought out the best in her: it still can, perhaps. She can’t bring herself to say out loud that what Lucius did was wrong, or that Azkaban planted a seed of insanity in his brain that seems to be rotting it at a quicker pace each year, but she can apologise, at least. Because she’d promised her son a much different life than the one he’s ended up with.
. The two of them look rather perplexed.
”) to get him to come back at all.) Much less does Draco like to be surprised with Harry Potter.
Draco doesn't answer, instead hooking a thumb in Harry's waistband to tug it aside and taking his cock in his mouth in one eager slide.
"God, you're fucking annoying," Harry says, but he pulls out halfway and fucks back in, hard. The way Malfoy's walls cling to his cock and suck him back in makes his toes curl. "Be patient, Malfoy."
. I said please. Once. That’s just good etiquette when someone’s about to lick you out, is it not?”
At first, Charlie moved back into his old bedroom. Its angled walls were papered in posters of dragons and brooms, the weird bands he'd liked as a kid. The picture of a Muggle girl in a bra and knickers that he'd shoved into his bedside draw — when he'd still been pretending to be straight and too busy with Quidditch to ever have a girlfriend — was still there, too.
“Can’t what?” Harry says, jerking Draco’s cock with what he knows must be frustrating languor.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry grunts. His cock is already swelling again and he congratulates it on it’s initiative. “Draco, you cheeky
Ron makes a highly knowing noise but lets him be, going back out into the dining room where apparently Malfoy is petting Rose.
“No,” Harry agrees, lowering his voice and following Malfoy down those few steps, “but I’d like it if you did.”
She wants to question him about it more but is intrigued against her will by his little hook.
"Are we done, then?" he asks, gesturing to the living room, and because he
He can't tell anymore if Malfoy's purposely being defiant or if he's so gone he genuinely thinks this is what Harry meant.
One of the really nice things about dating Ginny had been that she never left Harry guessing what she was thinking, something that had driven him absolutely bonkers with Cho. And Draco — he's kind of like that too, only in a completely different way.
Stepping up so there's barely an inch between them, Draco nips at Harry's full bottom lip.
Harry snorts and Ron laughs out loud, clearly remembering it as well. “Yeah,” he says, “they were Transfiguring garden gnomes. Completely twisted, that woman. The husband was the one who tipped us off.” He turns to Malfoy (and feels a twinge of irritation when he spots the slight flush on his cheeks from the wine, which is ... not unattractive, or whatever) and says, “I think you’d’ve really liked her, Malfoy, she was supremely evil and all posh and annoying like you. Blond too.” He goes so far as clinking his (second) beer against Malfoy’s wine glass. “Maybe she’s a long lost Malfoy cousin.”
When he wakes up, Harry’s not surprised to see that the sun is just beginning to stretch its fingers over the horizon, but he

specialist?” Harry prods.
And of course Seamus has decided to add the guilt about Natalie to it.
“I was fucked out,” Draco protests. Lazily, he beckons Potter back to his mouth.
"That's because Draco keeps us well-stocked," Hermione laughs. "You've never met a tea snob like him."
“Fuck you,” Draco spits. “Gods, fuck you, Potter. If I tell you to leave me alone will you finally listen?”
"Come off it," Draco snipes. "As if Pansy hasn't already repeated everything she knows. You're complete fucking twits, the pair of you."
Draco says into Blaise’s lips (which taste like vodka. Or maybe that's him), “Don’t call me that.”
"Saint Potter," Draco murmurs against Harry's lips. "Now you've risen from the dead, you must be drowning in pussy."
“You are,” says Draco. “And it’s awfully tedious.”
Draco’s eyes, as fucked out and drapey as the rest of him, widen. “You didn’t.”
a few days after its release, of Potter and Weasley pissing on a copy, drunk outside a pub in London.
“It’s a lion, isn’t it? Like Gryffindor.”
Harry said he would — he did once, with Ron. They didn't fuck, but they did talk. It was nice. Charlie had missed talking to Harry.
At first Harry's head is too fuzzy to know what Malfoy's talking about, and when he gets it finally he can only nod and tighten his grip in Malfoy's hair and, carefully the first time, push his cock back into Malfoy's mouth. He presses in until he can feel the head slide just barely into his throat and pulls back out again, but doesn't wait more than a couple seconds before repeating the whole thing. Holding Malfoy's head still, Harry starts up a rhythm, fucking his mouth and giving him only brief respites to catch his breath. It's unbelievably cathartic, and Malfoy's mouth is like velvet.
, Harry.”
"I'm partial to Peppermint Cream," says Blewitt. "I like my tea a little sweeter than most people, I think." Hermione refrains from telling him Draco does too. "Anyway, I'd better be off. Good to meet you, Granger. Draco," he flashes him a grin and then leaves, and Hermione turns a raised eyebrow on him.
“Hypocrite,” says Draco. He doesn’t bother explaining further. “I want to come.”
The weight of Charlie's arm is a presence he's missed. He thinks it might even be possible, if Charlie were less of a noncommittal person, to put the Malfoy thing away for good, never to be revisited.
During the war, when Voldemort had occupied the Manor, Draco hardly saw his father. Once, in the weeks they knew he was coming, he came across him stooped in his mum's arms. She was rubbing circles on his back, thin and fragile in the way she'd always been but looking so much bigger than her husband. It was the first time Draco had ever seen his father that way — misshapen and trembling. He didn't like it when Lucius spat at him or hexed him, but he liked this far less.
(Harry would tell Draco he’s got a filthy mouth, but he’s not really in any place to talk.)
.” She meets his eye again and smiles. Reaches to place her hand over his. “You know I appreciate you being here, Draco. I’ve prepared your favourite for tomorrow, you know.”
Granger, having ostensibly given up on trying to get the three of them to play nicely, sets her fork down with a great thunk and rises from her chair. “Ronald. Could you please assist me in the kitchen?”
tomorrow."
I’ve had my fill of hunting down Dark wizards. Ever think of that?”
Speeding his hand up and working him through it, Harry goes back to mouthing his jaw as Malfoy comes all over both of them, twitching and jerking. "Fuck, you look so good," Harry mumbles against his skin, hand slowing.
"All these pithy little attempts at domination," says Draco. "Were you hard that time you brutalised me on the Quidditch pitch?"
Hermione stays still a moment, then decides to oblige Pansy. She takes a seat across from her, setting her bag on her lap and lifting an eyebrow.
Harry’s not sure how exactly Skeeter discovered some of the other, finer details, and he’s not sure he wants to.
He says, “Whatever. Go. Just know I don’t like you, and you’re really shit at clubbing.”
“Obviously,” says Harry, somewhat gently. It’s funny: for the fact that he’d just been fucking him, Harry feels oddly unsure how to act now. “But we don’t really know each other, do we? I’ve got no idea what you want out of this. I hardly know what
comes up, Harry throws his hands in the air with a muttered “fucking Christ” and he drops back into his chair. She’s barely got the last of her words out when he says, “I’m not denying anything! If you’re suggesting I’m going to start neglecting the rest of my life to prowl around London after Malfoy like we’re back at Hogwarts then, honestly, I’m kind of fucking offended, alright? I mean,” he laughs, humourless and just this side of self-deprecating, “fuck, it’s just
"Excuse me," he says.
Harry swallows and shifts beneath Draco, realising now that he's
, I only promised to get you your wand back. Which I will still do.” Raising his eyebrows, he adds, “Anything else?”
But he’s drunk. He’s very gay. Malfoy is fit. He's clearly not the only one who thinks so. Just because Malfoy has historically been a colossal wank-off, doesn’t mean Harry is immune to all the blond-ness and chiseled-ness and long-ness walking towards him in the dusky, pulsing light of the club. He shouldn’t beat himself over it, right?—
There’s a strange sense of slight bereavement, when Potter says that, and Draco frowns at it. “No,” he says. “Are you?”
hard not to let that show. “Emergency?” he echoes. “What— what emergency? Why would they call
"You coddle him sometimes," Pansy points out. "When you're less randy and not on as many drugs."
"Fuck," says Dean. "If Ron's gone all quiet we really must've had enough. Don't roll another one, Luna."
After walking for a while, the mess of trees on either side of the path open into a small glade. High above, a smudge of dark sky disturbs the tree tops. Down below, a smudge of dark hair disturbs their spindly boughs. Draco half jumps out of his skin at the sight of the figure, sending stones skittering from under his feet. He keeps to the vague edges of the copse behind him, resisting the urge to run as it turns just slightly, moonlight revealing a fine profile obstructed by round glasses – fuck's sake, it's just Potter. He's not sure when Potter became 'just Potter'; i.e., a relief rather than a threat. Whatever. Draco makes to retreat.
Malfoy smirks. He says, “A friend.”
, Hermione. One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor?”
“Don’t worry,” says Draco. “It was for entirely selfish reasons.”
Draco tilts his head into Pansy’s touch. “He said it wasn’t a hate fuck,” he says, wiggling a little under Blaise’s warm weight. “Why would he say that.”
“Perfect,” Blaise groans. His head is tipped back, eyes closed. The same boy Pansy’s fucking has his mouth on Blaise, lips stretched wide and pretty.

. Blaise rolls his eyes. "I think you need a bath."
. He buckles at the knees as soon as Harry lets go of him.
“Nay,” Draco says, defaulting to his factory setting of be-a-dick because Merlin, it’s so early in the morning, and he hadn’t expected to have to deal with Potter again remotely this soon. “Not under any circumstances. Negative. By no means. Never.”
Draco says, “Gratitude is merely the expectation of further favours.”
with Rose, but he’s not terrible either. When he’d first started hanging out with Teddy a lot after the war it had felt a bit foreign, handling a baby (he never had before), but at least he’d had that practice before Ron and Hermione decided to do the family thing.
Draco looks at Potter, grinning like a clot. Idiot. "Do tell."
much shit between you, like a mountain of it, d'you think anything between you and that person has to be inherently toxic? Unhealthy? I mean ..." he licks his lips, "d'you think that's just bad soil at that point?"
"Ambiguous," George echoes, frowning. "Meaning ... what? You think this is a long time coming?"
It’s typical Ginny, really. So typical he actually laughs, and remembers why he’d liked her so much when he was sixteen. Because Ginny won’t ask for details, for the why and how, even if she does want to know. She won’t pry, or be nosey, or go anywhere near a lecture. Just ‘how are you’.
“It’s going to be very helpful in this new case study,” Hermione snipes at him, and then puts on a smile when she looks at Malfoy. Harry raises his eyebrows at Ron, who mimes gagging in full view of both of them. “You were telling me about your work with that man in Paris who tried to perform a Doubling Charm on his liver — I’m dying to read about it, I wish they would hurry up and publish the article.”

Ugh. Pansy’s cunty little assistant is sitting at the secretary’s desk, and she’s a cunt for many reasons but her most heinous offence is that she often makes Draco
Truthfully, he doesn't know what the fuck he wants. He knows he's still thinking about Malfoy right now, but he does love Charlie. And some part of him does very much want to try an actual relationship with him, even though he's right and it would likely not last long simply because he wouldn't be happy here in London, and Harry can't leave.
"Well," says Harry bluntly, "I fucked him. Kind of."
"The badge stayed on," Draco says haughtily. It never fails to make his cock twitch when Harry says things like that. Unsurprising. The guilty fantasies he'd played over and over in his mind often stemmed from pondering what exactly Potter would do to shut him up. If Draco just pushed him so far ...
“Actually it’s Ron you’ll need to worry about,” Harry sighs. “But he won’t know anything’s going on until I tell him. And by the way,” he adds, “I spoke to Kingsley last week. He's been … it’ll take longer than I wanted it to. It’ll happen, though. I promise.”
“I did something,” he says into his palm. “Inadvisable.”
With a snort, George pulls his legs in finally. "Yeah, alright. Don't wanna give you nightmares or anything." He nudges him with his foot again, this time in the leg. It's time for Ickle Ronnie to get to bed. "Good talk, little brother. For real. Thanks."
“They’re very
Goal. Ouch.
Yes, yes, yes,
Draco’s mouth curves wickedly. “Do you think me a complete imbecile, Harry?” he says. He takes Harry’s wrist and pulls him to his feet. “There’s one in the bedroom, too.”
is for Potter to crawl back into the fucking hovel whence he came, and never tempt Draco with his wiry forearms ever again.
Harry waves his hand in the air. “You. Your insults are too—” he waves his hand again.
, Harry,' just barely. "Fuck, mate. Why?" he says, because he really does want to know.
Draco says, simply, “No.”
Draco glares at her. "Not that story," he says. Blaise collapses over the table with a groan.
“to be filled. Need you in me. Wanna come — ah,
Harry snorts. “You sound like Snape when you say that.” His knuckles ghost over Draco’s cock again.
Too busy trying to steady his breathing to speak, Draco simply looks at Potter with a marginally disdainful ‘
"Yes," Draco says wearily, joining Pansy at the Floo. "I'm sure he would."
“Can’t, Potter,
"A rose by any other name and all that," says Harry. "It's alright, I'm lost too. You kill the psychopath whose been after you for seven years and suddenly your life has no purpose anymore. Funny how that works."
Muscles relaxed and nerves still tingling, he shampoos. He soaps. He stands under the water until his skin starts pruning (and his anxieties are back) and then goes to the bedroom to find Klaus curled up contentedly on the bed waiting for him.
Well. It’s not what she’d been expecting at all, and suddenly there’s a pit of anxiety in her stomach. She lowers the cup of tea she’d been about to sip.
in your face like this, darling, but you've been sitting here arguing with me about Potter for —" she checks her watch, a slim, diamond-encrusted number from Paris "— twenty minutes now, so either you're intentionally trying to keep me from ever going home or you're waiting to be convinced to fuck Potter." She takes out her wand and flicks it, causing their teacups to fly back to the tray, empty of contents. "I say do it. Obviously. Blaise will too. But if you really can't, then put him out of your mind altogether. All right? Just please don't resurrect the I-Hate-Potter club. We're too old."
Draco takes another pretend drag. In the far corner of the forest, something bursts from the trees and dives back down again. “Haven’t you heard, Potter? I’m no more a Black than you are. Nor a Malfoy, for that matter.”
Ron's only been half listening to Harry's work-rant, one ear trained on the door to make sure Rosie isn't fussing too much from her bassinet in the living room. However, he's learnt from bitter experience that when Harry says he has a confession to make, it's usually something he should give his full attention. Plus, you know. He'll need to concentrate if he's to give Hermione the full report she'll definitely request.
“Of course not, Potter.”
The deflection gets his attention. “Where’s your wand?” he says again.
"Of course," says Pansy, without missing a beat. "It's a boorish habit, isn't it? This last name nonsense."
Harry laughs. “Well you can’t keep disdainfully calling me Potter if we’re consistently sleeping together. Or … you know, whatever we’re doing.” He says it confidently enough but his warm cheeks give him away for the awkward piece of shit he knows he is.
When Harry comes, things happen in flashes. He’s coming, and Draco’s still making those sounds. He’s coming, and Draco’s twisting himself around on his cock to kiss his top lip, bite his bottom, wet and messy. He’s coming, and the dregs of Draco’s eyeliner are smeared over his cheekbones. He’s coming, oh, fuck, he’s
“‘Thanks’ would’ve been fine.”
.) But Draco said do it, and Harry wants to. Wants it now, wanted it an hour ago.
“S’pose so,” says Ginny. She whacks Harry gently on the arm. “Anyway, saviour of worlds and vanquisher of snake men. How’s tricks? Aside from shagging my brother, I mean.”
Charlie takes his arm off Harry’s shoulders so he can rest his head in both hands. “Harry, c’mon. You’re a lot younger than me. I live on a fucking ranch in Romania. Yeah, I fell in love with you a bit but we were both so fucked up then, so soon after everything that happened. It wouldn’t have lasted. Don’t you think you’re romanticising, like, just a little cause of all this stuff with Malfoy?”
"Don't," Hermione says sharply. "Don't imply I'm doing this as some kind of frivolous way to blow off steam. Excuse me if I think you've had enough of toxic relationships in your lifetime, Harry. Draco said you called him
to watch Rose?"
Feeling sick, Harry turns to make sure Lavender and Justin haven’t just heard the entire thing, and thankfully it appears as though they’d had more important things to get to than yet another Potter-Malfoy row.
Pansy smiles. Rounds off the curve of her ring finger, a jot. “Excellent, pet. Send her through in a few minutes, yes?”
It’s then that reality fully sinks in and he remembers how many of his friends are directly outside his bed-hangings and spends a moment praying they didn’t hear anything before he comforts himself with the thought that there’s no way Ron wouldn’t have come busting in like a bull if he’d heard something.
, and beyond him being a prat we don’t
Pansy raises an eyebrow. "As do we all, Healer Granger." She takes a sip of her cognac. "The reason I asked for you is really very lucid indeed. I would like for you to leave Draco be, outside of work."
“Do I … what?” Harry responds, blinking owlishly. “I — I mean … not as much as Hermione. What are you getting at?”
“I’m too drunk for that.”
“It wouldn’t rhyme if it wasn’t true,” Ron puts in.
“Fuck you,” Draco says. Then, “You can see the tail just there.” He points towards the serpentine curve up near Polaris. He’s become well-versed in constellations in the last few weeks, even the ones he wasn’t forced to learn as a child during Malfoy-Black family history lessons. They’re an excellent distraction — looking up is far easier than looking down.
“Too fit for his own good is exactly right,” he says. “I just don’t think—“
“Quit looking at me like that,” he says under his breath to Ron, “eat your potatoes.”
“Ham and cheese. And Luna’s vegetarian. And I made some treacle tarts for you, Harry.”
"That's very kind," says Blewitt as he takes a mug out of the cabinet and fills it with steaming water from his wand, "but I really must be getting back down. I only came because you have all the good flavours up here."
Seamus says, "You're welcome," and Harry looks very much like he's resisting the urge to kick him. Ron wouldn't stop him; Seamus can be a massive prick when he's high. Though he does agree with the sentiment.
, who’s here and standing across from him), but is really just him loosening the knots of creeping panic in his shoulders. “Some emergency, or something. Not sure, wasn’t quite listening.”
“It smells like a wet kneazle,” Draco says.
He’s proud of the steadiness in his voice when he says, “How could you do that?”
"Indeed," Hermione smiles. "I'm so sorry, you are?"
“Mm,” Draco insists. He crooks a leg behind Harry’s knees, drags him forwards. Slings arms over his shoulders. “So fucking big. Can’t stop thinking about your hands on my neck. Wrapped around me.”
“Ta ta,” Draco says, and leaves before Potter can look at him like that anymore than he already has.
Harry is absolutely gobsmacked. He stares in stupid, open-mouthed disbelief that turns into defensive anger and then quickly to helpless confusion and rather a lot of embarrassment. He blinks a lot and, absurdly, thinks back to fifth year when he and Fred — no, it had been George — had beat the shit out of Malfoy and consequently lost their Quidditch privileges.
Harry drops his head when Malfoy's hand curls around him — he's unreasonably hard and he wants to feel those same fingers on his cock instead of over two layers of clothing.
Awkward and messy as it is, Harry loves everything about it. Malfoy’s little sounds, the struggle of finding a good angle, the smell of sex. He trails his lips down to Malfoy’s neck and sucks lightly at the skin while he redoubles his efforts, paying attention to the faster breathing and jerking hips that tells him Malfoy’s about to come, and he’s far too eager to see it.
, but it’s not …
He shoves Potter’s shoulder, hisses, “Get in here,” because he’s worked far too hard to have the tenuous respect he’s gained from his colleagues jeopardised by Potter and his loud fucking mouth.
her cloak. "Come, let's go get drunk at my flat. Maybe Blaise will join us, I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a quick fuck."
Draco cries out in splintering, wanton relief, twisting back already, wanting more already.
It’s not a particularly verbose answer but technically that’s what Harry’s going for. The situation is completely surreal, which makes it a lot easier to give into what his body is telling him it wants and not think about all the fucking weirdness of it. He presses down harder for a moment before finally releasing and, while Malfoy’s looking slightly dazed (probably from lack of oxygen), he divests him of his trousers, compelled to press a kiss to his ankle, then his knee, then his thigh, and then the soft skin on his stomach. He doesn’t bother with his own any farther than he needs to in order to get his cock out. Lifting the leg he’d been kissing, he brings a hand to Malfoy’s arse and slides his fingers bluntly between his cheeks and across his hole, still slightly sticky with lube and — god, his face is hot — his own come.
Hermione decided she'd probably need to have a little chat with Harry about the whole thing.
Draco had assumed Potter was here to see Mr and Mrs Weasel, so he hasn’t yet bothered asking. “I didn’t say ‘it’,” he sniffs. “You must’ve misheard. And if you’re quite happy to stay, there’s no need for me to, is there?”
Draco scowls. Pansy would bring that up, the bloody trollop.
“In other words,” says Harry, grinning a little, “you’d like me to be your boyfriend.”
Potter’s fingers hardly brush Draco’s cheek, but it’s enough to make the Mark twitch. “No,” he says. “Private study.”
“Can I ask you something?” he says as he sits back down, nodding towards Malfoy’s arm. “About the Mark.”
"Not tonight."
Draco’s who’s still wearing that obscene triangle of black lace, and who is grinding desperately into Harry’s cock. Pleas of “put it in me, get it in me, want it now.”
“Can you?”
“Alright, that’s enough,” Harry says, grimacing. “I’ll never get hard again.”
good names, those. I guess they just wanted yours to be equally as ostentatious. I s'pose you're the last Black now, aren't you? You could single-handedly destroy the tacky constellation tradition."
"That's all," Harry says, smiling too-sweetly at him. "Really appreciate it, Malfoy." He dumps one small spoonful of sugar in his tea, stirs it, and is pleasantly surprised at the perfect temperature. Then again, Malfoy seems like a tea snob, so.
to grab his wrists so hard, but in all fairness he's told him about a million times where to put his stupid fucking hands. "On the
“What a dreadful shame that would be,” says Draco. He looks at Potter for the first time since his arrival, slightly thinner and in his usual attire of a Muggle jumper and loose-fitting jeans. “You’ve such a bright future; Head Auror with a wife he met in first year and a litter of Gryffindor nippers. All that domestic bliss must sound enticing after everything you’ve been through, no?”
“Utterly tedious,” says Draco. Pansy had wanted him to come home with her. The prospect of dinners sat across from her mother, who hated him (ever convinced that Draco was one faulty contraceptive spell from condemning her daughter to teenage motherhood – hello, he's fucking
“Isn’t this a little counterproductive?” says Harry, and he’s quite proud of himself for getting out such a fucking long word without stumbling. He’s drunk, and Malfoy’s—

"Completely," he says anyway. "So give me your mandatory spiel and be done with it, yeah?"
“Bit rich,” Draco says. “I’m not the one trying to fuck my way into my best friend's family.”
, it was average. Slightly above, perhaps. It was quite the stretch, but I'm sure that's only because there wasn't adequate lubrication available to us. In the lift."
Draco, always quite a hypocrite, thinks of Potter appearing next to him with equal parts dread and desperation. He might try and smack him, but he also might cry, and he also might get on his knees.
(“Give me some of your cologne to spray it with,” Draco requested, after Harry had helped levitate the thing into place and unfurl it beside the hearth. “It still smells like the Manor. I want it to smell like home.”
"I'll spare you only because Blaise will enfeeble you himself when you tell him about all of this," she says. "And by the way, Draco,

“You’re very perceptive,” says Draco. Who is wearing a thong. An actual pair of black, lacy knickers, like the kind Ginny used to wear, except impossibly
Draco arches back into the rough stone behind him again, wanting to get away from Harry's unrelenting grip but also wanting more of it, everywhere. "Oh, fuck, I'm going to suck your cock after this."
Harry's holding Rose, because he doesn't think those two lunatics can be trusted at the moment. He thinks they might actually have forgotten he's here, sitting at the kitchen bench, holding their child, who seems somehow to realise the utter inanity of the argument because it isn't upsetting her. She's contentedly playing with her little stuffed elephant, actually, and paying them no mind.
Right. Sighing a little, Harry offers up, "So what did you get up to? Did you, er ... did you go home at all?"
"Very clever of you, Malfoy," Harry says tiredly, head tipping back against the wall. "Now if only you were capable of doing more than mouthing off and being an annoying know-it-all git. D'you know I think I'd fancy being stuck in here with Percy Weasley over you? I really do."
“I think that drink cost half my vault,” says Harry.
At least Harry’s keeping up.
“Mmph,” Draco agrees, making a boneless attempt to wrap his legs around Harry’s back. “Yours.”
“So," Harry says, tossing Malfoy his trousers and zipping up his own, "are you going to call me Harry now? Hold my hand on the way to lessons?"
“Draco,” Harry says softly, putting a hand on his shoulder and running it slowly down his arm. He’s tempted to kiss it and though he hesitates, he does it eventually. When he sees Draco’s eyes finally flutter open, he does it again. “Sorry. We should get you out of here before everyone wakes up.”
“So am I, and yet I don’t look like I’m perpetually walking perpetually backwards through a perpetual
had known about this and decides he hadn't. Although Harry's suddenly suspicious about his secret having been shared with Hermione.
Harry grimaces. And the grimace deepens as he thinks about it, analyses Malfoy's face to determine whether he's taking the piss, and starts wondering if it's possible he's not. He doesn't like it, he decides. Actually he hates it, although probably not nearly as much as Ron would.
“You’re not funny,” Draco tells him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron says, “It is fucking so.”
“It is weird. It’s
involved in this, even I will concede, inadvisable decision, was Granger and her iron will. If the Weasel were aware of her treachery, I’m sure he would be here by now.”
However. Hearing Malfoy talk, in that stupid posh voice of his, about taking someone home, is something else altogether.
"Just— let me."
“The sky?” Harry gestures upwards. Really, isn’t he supposed to be the derpy of the two?
“I’m not nine. I’ll have coffee, though.”
Draco babbles, something utterly undecipherable about Mars, and shit, Harry won’t be able to listen for much longer without shooting off in his jeans like a fucking teenager.
“You said I’ve got a big cock.”
And number three: Granger’s boyfriend is the Weasel, and her best friend is Harry Potter. And Draco has known for twelve years, give or take, that any friend of Harry Potter’s is not a friend of his.
“Yes,” Draco whines. “Yes, make me fucking—
“Brilliant. You jot down a little list of everything we can do together that doesn’t feel too homoerotic for your comfort, and we’ll get right to it.”
The words hit Harry like a train, nearly knocking the wind out of him. For a moment all he can do is stare at Draco, processing, heart beating fast and hard. He’s come abstractly to an understanding inside his head that he doesn’t just
, with painful determination — not to be annoyed or upset by Malfoy’s curtness. Yes, it’s annoying. It’s very upsetting. He’s a huge git. But Harry’s not a teenager anymore, and one of his brand new adult coping skills is the art of compartmentalisation. Or it would be, if he was any good at it.
you,” she says, pointing accusingly at Harry, who throws up his hands in bewilderment, “had better be nice to him.”
Pansy stands with Granger, only to take a few paces and drop back into her desk chair. She Summons her cigarettes from the pocket of her coat across the room. "Floo powder gives me a headache," she says, lighting one and flicking a fluid wrist. "I haven't got one in here."
It’s impossible not to picture it, although Harry tries. His cheeks burn again and he lifts his mug, gulping the cocoa down and coughing when it scalds his throat. Why had he asked again?
“Oh,” Harry says helplessly, eyes glazing over and head thumping with lust as Draco nips at the pad of his thumb, and then, lips cocked in a ruined smile, sucks a forefinger into the silky heat of his mouth.
— has it really been that long since you've gotten your cock wet?"
Taking the hint (and rolling her eyes fondly), Pansy indulges him and begins moving her fingers through his hair, damp a bit on the ends, using her nails to scratch his scalp. It makes her stomach hurt — perhaps 'clear mutual dislike' isn't quite accurate. If it was she'd hardly be so apprehensive about this rekindling of his Potter flame.
“Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Harry says kindly. “You’ve been drinking.”
“He’s perfectly fine.” Draco dips the spoon into his tea, and stirs until a little whirlpool forms. “Now, must we discuss Harry Potter all afternoon? Tell me about your flowers.”
“Right,” he says slowly. “D’you know what
), but he still gets all twisty every time he thinks about (and pulls off to) the memory of Potter’s warm, angular weight pressing him into the wall of the lift.
"It is," he says. "But I'm not going to. I mean, he's not interested. I don't need to be wasting my time on people who aren't interested."
When is he off?
"Well I'm a thoughtful person."
“Is it that Dumbledore was gay? Cause everyone knows that already.”
Draco drops his head back against the wall behind him as Potter’s teeth scrape over the firm skin below his jaw. There’s no thoughts, just want, just his hands tugging at the hem of Potter’s jumper. “Fuck,” Draco murmurs, “Mm, fuck.”
? Believe me, it's nothing to do with you."
Harry hadn’t the energy left in him to explain (yet again) the ways in which Hermione doesn’t understand Quidditch, and why that was a wholly ridiculous comparison.)
No such luck.
Harry’s smile slides away and he pushes a hand through his hair. “Maybe I fancy you too, alright? A little bit. I dunno.” He exhales heavily, palms sweating. “I think you’re kind of an annoying brat but you’re also … like, smart. And funny. And I’m really attracted to you, so. I’ve decided I want to see if something could work. Between … you know. Us.”
“Come here.” Harry hooks his hands under Draco’s arms so he can arrange him against the desk, and then sits down in front of him.
You're fucking twisted, Draco tells his cock. "Hate me today choke me tomorrow, Potter. No, I don't. Ask Granger to make you one next time she does a round of those hideous elf badges."
Draco wriggles a little. “
Draco hums. He lets go of Harry’s shirt, and clasps his wrist again, pulling Harry’s hand gently from his throat. “Not sure,” he says softly. The delicate skin all across his décolletage is flushed pink, but the spot where Harry’s hand rested and pressed is warmer by degrees.
Draco
"Draco," she says, flicking some ash onto the floor, "what exactly did Potter say to you?"
Once he's de-booted and de-coated, he goes to the kitchen where Klaus starts rubbing him again and Harry scoffs.
Harry frowns. He tries racking his brain, anything about Malfoy he might have noticed sixth year but deemed insignificant to his cause. But he draws a blank, remembering only seeing him around Crabbe and Goyle or Parkinson most of the time.
in the confused way his brain is screaming for.
Ron’s stomach twists. “George,” he says. “If you wanna talk about it, we can.”
,” Hermione says, “this feels different. With Ginny and Charlie, they were more friends than anything else, you know? When things ended, Harry wanted to preserve that. And with Natalie — I mean, you remember how he was. It was like he only started seeing how bad things actually were the second they ended. He
"Good." Draco indulges Harry's beckoning, deepening the kiss and clasping his hands over Harry's on his waist.
“Yeah.” He stares out at the lake, so calm tonight it looks like a sheet of glass reflecting the dark sky. He doesn’t know why he’s saying this to Malfoy instead of Hermione or Ron, just that it feels easier. Perhaps because he hates seeing their pity. “He asked me to do a lot of stuff and didn’t trust me much in return.”
"Nothing. Faster."
Rose starts wiggling again and making those little noises in his ear that he knows means she’s about to start screaming if she doesn’t get what she needs, so Harry stands with her and tries to keep her placated by stroking her hair.
"The thing he said about the um, the jacket potatoes!"
"I dunno," Harry shrugs. "It's not really a hard-hitting question, is it? You're free to piss off any time. I did originally come out here for Dumbledore's tomb."
Not that he wants anyone else to know. This is for him.
His boyfriend is utterly unhinged when it comes to his academic endeavours, and Harry’s not quite sure why he likes it as much as he does. Granted, it’s not so endearing when Draco does idiotic things like insist he doesn’t need to sleep, he’ll just take Revitalising Potions every six hours and that way he can study for his law school exams for three days and nights straight.
“I would, wouldn’t I?” Draco says, and gives Harry’s shoulder a little pat. “See how some of the shiny white dots are bigger than the others? That string of big ones just to the left of us — left is that way, Potter — is what you’re looking for.”
“You look fucking edible in these,” Harry murmurs. “Can’t resist.”
of begging ... well, it's a phenomenal feeling, if anyone wanted to know.
“Gross.”
Draco turns away from Potter, starts walking towards the water’s edge. “I know that,” he says, waving a hand over his shoulder.
,” he says. “Oh, fuck.”
Sounds like classic Lucius Malfoy, though Harry elects not to say that out loud. He also resists asking, scornfully,
“I knew what I was doing!” he insists, though he’s still laughing. “Found you in the Chamber, didn’t I? And as far as I’m aware, at least, the murderous snake man is still dead. So. You’re welcome.”
"Temporarily?" he says after a second.
“Perhaps,” says Malfoy. “Either that, or he saw your glasses.”
"Oh my god." Harry drops his face into his hands, sick, physically
Yeah, he could definitely get used to this. He likes this squirming, needy Malfoy so much he sinks his finger all the way in to the knuckle and leaves it there unmoving, just to see how close he can bring him to the edge. As an experiment.
Draco asked for Harry’s hands. Harry puts them on his waist. Skims the band of expensive material he finds there. “So fucking small. Tight. With these trousers.”
"Not very nice for Paris."
Harry is Wizarding Britain’s collective son, and they may not like that he’s gay — they may have desperately wanted him to marry a carbon copy of his own mother (which is really weird, when he thinks about it) and return to that tragic little house in Godric’s Hollow and pump out a litter of Gryffindor sproglets for them to fawn over — but they’ll accept it. They’ll indulge him. Because he’s Harry Potter.
“You made me come,” murmurs Draco, his voice thick and well used. “In my pants.”

“Even if it’s mine?”
), was marginally more depressing than Christmas alone at school, and so he stayed. “Yours?”
“I’m sorry for the way things turned out, Draco,” she says softly. “I am.”
Harry laughs. "Only because I stayed down there to save Fleur's sister," he says, crouching to grab a very flat-looking rock from the water. And because he knows it'll annoy Malfoy, he adds, "They gave me extra points for moral fibre, though. So I came in second." He stands, brushes some wet sand from the stone, and flicks it over the water where it bounces four times and sinks. "But don't worry, I ended up winning the tournament."
"Your father?" she asks, clarifying. "He told you your father fucked you up properly?"
“You know, I expect that from most people,” Harry says, looking at Malfoy with his head tilted, “but not you. For your information, I’ve been considering playing Quidditch.” He turns and leans back against the guardrail, arms folding. “
“You want to pick up one of these blokes, right?”
“I dunno, one of those crazy bints who’re always bothering us when we go out with him,” Ron says, waving his hand as if it’s an obviously inconsequential detail. “We can kill her too when we’re finished.”
“It’s about Draco, Harry.”
Draco almost laughs. It’s not enough to be the Boy Who Lived, youngest Seeker in a century, the Chosen One etc, now Potter is fucking immortal, too. Childishly, it makes Draco remember why he hated him so much, and think that he still could, if he tried. He taps ash off his cigarette with more force than is probably necessary.
Pansy was no help at all after the party in the Great Hall. Drunk and stroppy at being pulled away from Daphne, she had been reluctant to believe anything Draco told her was true. It was only the following morning, after slinking out of Daphne's bed, that she became more receptive to his hysterics.
would he stay? He’s twenty-fucking-three and it shouldn’t feel like defeat, it should feel like being a normal human who takes themselves out of infuriating situations they know might make them lose their temper.
"Sure," Harry agrees vaguely as he steps outside. "Something like that." Actually, he's probably right: Ron and Hermione have been glued at the hip, although they've done an admittedly good job of trying to keep him from feeling like a third wheel, which he appreciates. But still. He leans back against the glass and sparks the joint to life, passing it to Malfoy after he's taken a hit. "You and your mates have a weird relationship," he says. "Is that ever weird for Parkinson, you and Blaise and Theo all shagging?"
“Not orders,” says Harry, “admissions.”
And technically it's not
restaurant, really, Blaise?” Pansy says, frowning a bit as they reach the ground floor and the club’s blacklights turn the white leather of Pansy’s skirt into something blueish and glowing. “Well, I suppose they do have good sushi. By the way,” she says, taking a glowing drink in a skinny glass from a girl carrying a tray whose skin has been painted a shimmery blue that reacts to the blacklights, “how’s this new Roserum selling? Draco,” she hands him the drink, “you
as a dinner guest over Malfoy, and it’s absolutely essential Malfoy not come any farther into this flat without being aware of how completely offended Harry feels, down to his bones, about these circumstances. “Harry,” says Hermione pointedly, “can you please take the food so Draco can get his coat off?”
.” Potter is licking,
“I don’t think swans usually grind their arses quite so much,” says Harry.
"Well I'm a lovely person."
Harry protests a little when Draco unfurls the elegant line of his body from his own. His hands feel heavy at his sides without warm, bare skin beneath them. “Is my virtue still garente—guaranteed?”
"Yes," Draco deadpans. "Potter's a lesbian, and the real reason he pulled out so abruptly is because he caught sight of my cock and went immediately flaccid. No, you fucking idiot, he's— shit. Let me put it this way — and don't laugh, or I'll tell Blaise you were the one who got Kahlúa on his mesh top — he got me to say
Draco sighs. He draws his legs together, trapping Harry’s ankle between his own two. “No, you don’t.”
"Here, here," says Ron.
Harry laughed. "You'll be shagging some fit young stable boy within a month."
Harry shoots her a scathing look but does it. He meets Malfoy’s grey eyes and practically rips the food out of his hands.
They descend into a comfortable silence, and eventually she feels Draco's breathing evening out into the long, slow patterns of sleep. She stays with him another half hour, petting his hair and smoking cigarettes. If she didn't have a reputation to uphold, she thinks she'd find Potter herself and give him the verbal flaying of his life for fucking with Draco when he'd been doing so well.
“You’re warm,” Harry notes, trying and failing to keep the incredulity from his voice. “And soft.”
Harry cards a hand through his hair, just about fed up with trying. It feels impossible. His stomach twists a little when he says, “Do you not think you can just be friends with me? Is that it?”
It’s a bit startling at first, having his mind once again delved into by another person, but it feels significantly different than when Snape had done it — less angry, less invasive, with none of the uncomfortably-tangible hatred. Harry tries desperately to think of trivial things as the realisation dawns that Draco hadn’t been lying, he
“Want you to come again for me, yeah?”
“Don’t be daft,” Charlie says. “I didn’t mean that. Course I had feelings for you. It’s just— well, it was a bit of a distraction from the real world, wasn’t it?”
