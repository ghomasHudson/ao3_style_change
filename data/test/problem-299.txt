It wasn’t fair! Not that life had ever been fair to anyone in particular, but he’d tried so hard. He’d done the right things. Tried to be a decent and good person. He’d saved a world that had made him a hero before he was even of age, and it had nearly cost his life. He’d done it all willingly. Thrown himself into risk and pain. He’d done it with a smile some of the time, knowing what might come. He’d given the very best of himself for the benefit of others.
I know it to be true. Someday, somewhere…we will lounge upon some beach in golden sun and glorious silence, because nothing needs to be said. He will do what he must, until he doesn’t have to anymore, and I will wait for him as patiently and as desperately as I must, until I never have to wait again. It will happen because I believe in it too passionately for it to not come true. That’s our future, and I will endure whatever I have to in order to see it.
“Hmm. I heard so much about French cooking. I guess I just assumed that…well…you know…they’d actually cook…with heat. My bad.”
“Yes…professor. As you wish.” Acid venom dripped from each word, the sarcasm as plain as day. Harry ignored the naked insolence, as well the faint hint of extra force when the door was closed.
“I’ve just got a hunch. If it was bad, we’d have known as soon as we arrived. They held dinner for us, so it can’t be all bad. Everything seems normal enough, so I’m betting that you and I might get asked some difficult questions, but nothing worse than that. I don’t know for sure…but it feels good to be home.”
“We’ve got several things on the docket today, so forgive me if I seem hurried here, but I have a lot of irons and the fire right now and we all need to get back to work as soon as this is over.
When Blaise first took me to the kind of nice restaurant a gentleman takes a lady (or in my case a pretty boy) to, I savored every bite of everything on my plate. The only time that changed was while I was in the pen, eating slop that would make pigs puke. Industrially mass produced glop that no one with taste buds would voluntarily touch without a damn good reason. Besides, prison food will make you fat, and I wasn’t interested in getting dumped by Flint or handed off to the rest of the building. Staying pretty meant staying thin meant staying alive and healthy…so I ate like a bird. Now that I don’t have to do that, I mean to make up for a little lost time, even if it means having to take up exercise to keep my figure for Harry.
“End up doing this? As if the pay wasn’t enough reason. It’s none of your damn business, but I’ll say this…Harry’s and my mutual employer did me a kindness some years ago. I’m afforded a certain luxury, and the ability to pursue my own research and advance my skills. Throw in making a fortune while I do it, and who would need more reason than that?
“Ah…hah….so you have heard of my candidacy? Well…the support of someone of your stature would be very, very welcome, sir. Really? Well…with that kind of support on the line, I can promise you that the whole of my attention will be on getting things in line here.
“That was soooo good. Wanna do that again tonight? I’m free after Advanced Transfiguration…”
He owns a nightclub called the Fire House now, and that’s where I ran into him. All I have in the way of information to work from is his business card and the fact that the Zabini name is fairly easy to track in this town. Because he’s ‘connected’, I hoped it might be possible to justify tacking him onto the list of targets you have in this town.
What a piece of work Flint had been too! A real, honest to God, unredeemable asswipe of the highest order, and they’d had to coddle him with the promise of a private cell in the ’cripples ward’ with extra amenities for his cooperation. The worthless piece of crap had been smirking all the while, amused that he’d had something to hold over the cops questioning him, even while he was in traction and wrapped up until he was nearly mummified. Still, he was a living witness who swore that a dark haired, green-eyed man named Harry Black had been there after all, and he’d been beaten nearly to death by that same man weeks before the killings.
Harry maintained the calm that Draco needed to see, but only barely. “I should do what I know is right, and I haven’t done that for a long time. I’m flattered that you put that much stock in my belonging here, but being a good wizard and being a good professor are two different things, Draco. I came here to hide, a long time ago, because I needed a way to make myself forget about the past. This was a good place for that. I was busy, I had friends all around me, and I’m not ashamed of what I’ve done here…but this isn’t where I belong. I don’t want to go home because of you…I want to go home because I’m not afraid of it anymore. Why would I regret that? That’s why I’m thanking you. And don’t worry…I won’t be leaving until I’ve fulfilled my commitments, to you and to others. We’ll have some time yet, alright?”
“There isn’t that much to tell. Got married too young, had kids before we were ready, and didn’t really know each other that well. She hated me working as an Auror and leaving her alone with the kids half the day and some nights, back when there were still a few real jobs to do. By the time I knew what was wrong, it was too late to fix it. She’s good enough about letting me see Jamie and Lily, and it isn’t like I’m not still fond of her, but we’re better off this way. I just hate the months when they’re at Hogwarts and I have to wait for the holidays to see them again. What about you and Pansy?”
Ron turned crimson, right to the tips of his ears. “’Kay…cool, “ he squeaked. “Next topic! How about those Cannons, eh?”
She’s definitely not used to compliments, if a simple one like that can make her uncomfortable. It’s kind of cute. In spite of being my age, and experienced in a lot of ways that other people aren’t, I can tell that her self confidence is a kind of front. She’s the typical brainy bookworm girl, incredibly competent and knows it, but horribly socially awkward. Suddenly, I see why Ron desperately needs my help with this crush of his, even if he thinks he doesn’t. Two obviously mutually interested people, equally socially challenged, and equally unable to make a simple thing like a date happen, clearly need my gentle guidance. Cyrano DeBergerac, eat your heart out.
The voice from the bathroom rang out while water could be heard streaming and splashing. "Oh fuck no, Potter! You've done enough damage! Weasel cock! I've been touched by something that touched Weasel cock! I have to wash the memory off of me...possibly with steel wire brushes and lye! Uhhh....more soap! Ewww! You're on your own! It's your fault for not telling me in advance that you did anything that disgusting with your parts!"
Was he a little melancholy? Perhaps, but given his situation, maybe that was a perfectly normal way to feel. For years he’d consoled himself with notions like, ‘…at least I had someone, just for awhile.’ It never really felt like it meant anything…until now. As soon as he’d acknowledged the ugly truth that Draco…his Draco…hadn’t loved him enough to stay, it felt like an anvil had been lifted from his chest. After almost two decades, it was strange to breath so easily all of a sudden.
Everyone is standing behind seats and the chatter has died down to whispers. Harry leads me up to the head table, where we stand behind chairs on either side of a carved masterpiece. The main seat is almost certainly an antique, and the carving on the jet black wood looks like it was a lifetime’s work to complete. No way to say what this would fetch in an auction house. Tens of thousands of dollars at least.
The other possible origin was Zabini’s mother. She was reputed to be a witch of stunning beauty and power, whose seven previous husbands had all died under questionable circumstances, leaving her their fortunes each time. It was even possible that a fusion of these two possibilities was the answer. Perhaps Zabini acquired the snake from his mother in an effort to eliminate Malfoy on Voldemort’s orders?
“He’s gone under the desk. I think he’s polishing Harry’s shoes!”
Draco’s mouth opened and closed for a few moments while the words bit at him. Expulsion. He’d gone too far, and they didn’t dole out whippings here. There were no house points to be taken for a houseless student. He’d lost his temper, and now he’d lost his time here. Something resolved in him. There was nothing to lose. He’d be out of here anyway. Might as well go for broke.
Harry was right to brief me before we started this, but I didn’t think I’d be giving pat answers this soon.
“Oh, come on! Admit it…even if you don’t like guys, you must be flattered that they thought you were hot enough to try hitting on you.”
Draco never seemed to mind when Harry spoke of his children, though Harry had often wondered if Draco found the subject painful, given the fact that he almost never saw his own daughter. Draco seemed to enjoy the stories from Hogwarts, and the brightness of his eyes while Harry recited passages from his children’s letters made it clear that he was genuinely interested. Perhaps, in the absence of his own child, Draco lived a bit vicariously through Harry’s stories, and if that gave Draco a bit of happiness, then so much the better.
Draco turned back to the window, looking out at the dimming sky. He took a deep breath, and started to speak at last...hesitance and tension in every word.
DISCLAIMER: Warning ! I make no claim to any property of J.K Rowling's, and am in no way profiting by this. I do offer her my sincerest thanks for allowing us this garden of the mind in which we play. Further Warning! This story...and likely any I ever write..are dominated by gay themes and characters. Thats how it is, if this in any way makes you uncomfortable...do not read further.
"Have you gone barmy?" Harry looked down at his red and gold Gryffindor beach jams, which, frankly, were the only beachwear long enough to hide his rather remarkable appendage. "No way! People would stare... you know how I hate that. That kind of attention I don't want! I'd rather just get credit for being next to the sexiest person on the whole damn beach."
“Got it in one take. Don’t worry, it won’t come to anything…like that. I promise.”
Harry clapped a hand onto Malfoy’s shoulder and tripped his Portkey for home, ignoring the affronted look he got when Draco realized what had just happened. Luckily, the disorientation took the edge off of Draco’s outrage, but that was only because two brains under the influence of alcohol were poorly suited for Portkey travel. They hit the floor of Harry’s apartment almost as one, and the last thing Harry could remember was the vague look of irritation on Draco‘s face as he passed out just a foot away.
“I don’t want to die. Please! I won’t tell anyone anything! I’ll do whatever you want! I swear it! I swear to God I’ll do anything…just-” It comes out punctuated by sniffles and gasps, but he interrupts with a vaguely insulted air and a finger raised to his lips.
“You’re reading my mind. This is bigger than us…an’ we ain’t small, sister. Shit…cell phone again. Can you hold the tapes?”
Draco leaned up and kissed away the tears that were leaking down his lover's face. Harry was shivering from tension and the effort to keep deep sobs from wracking his frame.
“Thanks, Ron. You’re still my best mate, and don’t worry…I’m not getting into anything I can’t handle. I’ll be fine. I’ve gotta get dressed and go, but I can catch up with you in class.”
“Seventeenth of next month. We’ll have been married fifty years. Heh. I’d no idea then what I was fighting for, but if I had, I’d have fought twice as hard! She’s a jewel, my Marie. But enough about me. This is your time, Harry. Let’s hear what’s been on your mind. Last time you’d said you’d try to talk with a few old friends and open up a bit. Any luck on that?”
“Dee. What do you want from me? I’ll do whatever you want.”
I didn’t do any of those things. I’ll swear to it, or take Veritaserum and repeat what I’ve told you. It’s just…what’s pathetic is…I accidentally cursed him with a failed love spell, got him expelled, and probably ruined his reputation or his life…because of a kiss. I hated myself so much for that…for the blindness to what he really wanted, for the stupidity of still wanting him after he mocked me, for the failure to even cast the spell right…and for doing all of it…because…because…”
When we finally stop for breath, Harry stands and offers me a hand.
“You know what’s up. Sorry…about this, I mean. Looks like we need to apply some more ‘pressure’ in a few places. This could take a little while. I hope you know I really wanted to be here…for you.”
Draco gasped lightly. His libido was slowly overwhelming his conscious mind and flickering to life. All his fears, his petty neuroses, his dreadful, middle of the night worries swirled away, and the crushing reality of Harry’s lips and tongue tracing their way down his chest took over. Harry was still holding his hand, and he slid his fingers into the beautiful mess of his lover’s hair, twining dark locks between his fingers while he gasped for breath. Gods, but Harry knew how to use that tongue!
It was Grimmauld Place. The bedroom Harry used now. Harry's breath stopped in his chest, just long enough for him to carefully scrutinize the two faces on the screen. He was momentarily silent in shock and horror, then scrambled for the remote and turned the VCR off while Draco looked at him in surprise and disappointment.
“How come you dislike me so much? Don’t pretend I don’t know. It was a good game and all, but you can barely stand being in the room with me most of the time. I’d just like to know.”
“You really loved him, didn’t you?”
I’m moaning into his mouth while that tongue plunders me ruthlessly, because he just shifted the angle of the toy and he knows he’s brushing the place inside me that aches for him. I love feel of faint stubble across my neck. Not thick or unshaven…just the little reminder that he is very much a man…and he is very much mine. His free hand has woven its way into my hair, and his teeth are just so delicately scraping their way across my nipple. Indescribable. When all of these elements are combined with the heady knowledge that he is alive and safe and here, I can’t find words for what I feel, and then he shifts that toy again, moving it with a steady hand that isn’t afraid at all, and all I can do is whisper affirmations of desire, letting him know that every little thing he does is right.
“Yes, really.”
A clank from the kitchen distracted him for a second, followed by the raised voices of his so called guardians.
When his mouth finally reached the inside of Harry’s thighs, it became necessary to hold Harry’s hands still, as Harry started to tremble and shudder, reaching for relief and finding Draco’s hands stopping him at every turn. Draco paused while Harry groaned in frustration.
“Right then. Be there in a moment, Headmistress. Harry withdrew from the Firecall and took the Floo properly. Hogwarts was not fully attached to the magical world’s Floo Network, but rather had its own independent and closed system, operating entirely within the castle, with limited access to other places. A second later, he stepped out of Minerva’s fireplace and dusted his robes off before taking a seat.
And then I can’t hear anything because the phone is snatched from my hand and Harry’s palm is over my mouth, pinning my head to the sheets! Reality just kicked in, and what I’ve done was unspeakably stupid. He isn’t even looking at me, his head is turned away while he speaks, but I can hear the edge in his voice. Terror. Stark, raw fucking terror. What I’ve done even frightens him. God help me! What the fuck have I just done?
“I owe you this. My debt.” Malfoy fumbled with the drawer of his nightstand.
The room was bathed in a soft radiance that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere in particular, and the details around the walls were hazy, as if wrapped in gauze. The furnishings were simple and elegant, and at the center of the room was Harry, reclining on his side, propped up by a few pillows, with his glasses already off, and his green eyes shining in Draco’s direction. Harry’s smile could have melted stone. Small wonder it had melted Draco’s reserve so easily.
“Don’t I know it, Tonksy! I haven’t heard you wax poetic about the virtues of a girlfriend with a pierced tongue in almost a month! You gotta give a straight man his vicarious thrills, ya’ know?”
He pulled away from Draco, who was more sluggish and complacent than ever before, and turned to face him. Then he lunged forward and kissed Draco on the mouth with a passion and violence that was unfeigned, and it was necessary to grab Draco’s arms to keep him from pushing Harry away.
Harry smiled in the face of danger. He hadn't played the last card yet. "Oh yeah...I've thought about it! For three months. I'm still bitter about the hair. Slytherin's aren't the only ones who can lie, you know."
The look has become one of horror. Even as I recall similar looks from countless other incidents of days past on other faces, this one and this alone makes my blood run cold. I can see something inside him crumbling, some part of him descending into gibbering lunacy and anguish…and I cannot find pride or pleasure in it. This time, as he begins to ache with the realization that he is betrayed and unwanted, I ache alongside him. I want this to be over all the quicker, because I can barely control myself and my rebellious tongue. I want to salve the wounds and make them vanish, but I must dig them deeper, cut a little more cruelly.
It was annoying…sometimes…keeping the bed warm with whatever seemed nice at the moment. Not that he didn’t get what he wanted out of it…but he didn’t really have anyone that ‘knew’ him. Not really. All the tarts he met these day were practically dead from the neck up…all attitude and no brains, just a good piece of ass with legs handy to move ‘em around. Not like Dee.
-------------------------------------------------------------
“Good man, MacNair. Get me to my office. I’ve a few calls to make. I want Asian currency stronger by the end of the week. It’s time to pull some strings. And bring me a brandy. Not the swill I keep out for company…the dusty bottle in the back of the cabinet. I’ll make something productive of this day yet!”
Young Draco had been quiet and reserved, if a little stiff, for the entire weekend, and Harry could tell that the young man was very uncomfortable in his new environment. He’d meant to talk about it before their first class together, but his first therapy meeting with John took precedence.
"That's largely correct…yes. It shows only the reflection of the desires of those who gaze into it…but do try to understand that desire is a fickle thing. People can want all kinds of things, and want them dearly, and then find that their desires are quite changed in a surprisingly short time. In some of the stories I read about the mirror years ago…there was said to have been a man who visited the mirror each year, saw what he desired, pursued that goal each year, and yet saw another desire entirely each year he returned. That's more of a statement about people in general than about the mirror, but I'm just saying that if you saw something discomforting, you needn't fear that it is written in stone."
It had been months since Draco had kissed Harry in the Great Hall, thereby announcing to the world that he had made a choice and wasn’t ashamed of it in the slightest, and in those months he had grown inexorably closer to Harry each day.
“Nev. Probably didn’t get the word from the others. Not…not really up for company yet. Sorry, mate. Just leave us be for awhile longer. I suppose I’ll be alright in a while.”
Harry sipped his coffee again and stared at the shards of light peeking through the window. He was calm enough, but he was avoiding looking at Draco.
“I don’t like it. You’d be at risk. If anyone caught on that you were playing him, you could get hurt. Maybe I don’t have the right to dictate all the terms, but I’m telling you honestly that I don’t want you involved that closely. Do you understand that I’ve only just found you? How long I’ve waited to feel this way for someone…anyone? It’s a fucking miracle that in this shitty world two people can feel like this…live like this and be content.
“Word of honor, love!” I give him a sassy little salute and put on a serious face that only makes him chuckle.
The phone snaps shut and he’s still silent and tense, hand over my mouth while I cringe, wide-eyed with fright and almost wanting piss myself from the fear of what this might mean. He holds a finger over his lips while I nod that I understand. He needs my silence.
The only bright and cheery spark of news that came, was a solid lead on Voldemort’s lair. An Auror squad was dispatched to scan the area, and was never heard from again. The Order stood convinced that the information was accurate, but suspected that an ambush had been intended for Harry the minute he arrived upon the property, and they reiterated their stance about keeping Harry safe until Voldemort revealed himself. All the while, Harry read reports full of death and suffering, as casualties of his inaction mounted ever higher.
The look on Dora’s face was enough to make the little man stop smiling a heartbeat later.
The Heat That Warmed A Frozen Heart...by Samayel
Killer be damned…the man has product. Not the kinds I prefer, but good enough to work with. The leftover make up from my purse is just enough to finish the job, and with the one outfit I still have, I look fairly decent…but outdated. It’s a tiny boost to an ego that’s fairly badly battered, but it’s all I’ve got. At least I know I can greet Harry Black looking a little like someone he wouldn’t cringe at the sight of.
Her emergence as a lesbian hadn’t been easy, but having co-workers who thought well of you and trusted you could take the edge off of anything. She wasn’t the only gay or lesbian detective on the job, but she was the only one ever promoted to the homicide branch of the Organized Crime Task Force in the heart of Chicago. It was the crowning moment of her career, and a job that she truly loved. To top it all off, less than six months after making the Task Force her new home, Dora Tonks had found a lover.
It was a little disconcerting when the young man turned his back from the camera and walked away,  well muscled in a rangy, rawboned way, with long curling dark hair trailing down his back, and the two young men could be seen clearly at last, one smaller, somewhat softer, but still fit, with short brown hair and a round and youthful face, the other just a little taller, more defined in musculature and with untidy curls of long black hair that he moved aside with a casual toss of his head. As they moved into a kiss, hands exploring each others bodies, Harry suddenly noticed the surroundings in the room the young men were in.
“It’s aspirin. Muggle medicine. Just for such occasions. Put them in your mouth, take a sip of coffee, then swallow them. It’ll take at least half an hour before it does any good, but I haven’t got any hangover remedies lying about. I can cast a pain relieving spell if you like?”
In a way, I brought this to a head, because I moved things far enough along that he wasn't getting by on a few rough tricks every night or two. He had an endless supply of what he needed, and I gave it to him freely. All the abuse and violation he could handle, as often as I could dole it out, and he took all I could give and eventually started to need more. In just a few months we spiraled out of control. He was getting restless, even in the few hours between sessions I can only describe as bestial. What he needs, no one can give him enough of, and it started becoming clearer to me in these last weeks.
Blaise shuffled down the hall, envelope in one hand, coffee in the other, savoring the aroma of high end coffee blended with good Irish whiskey. He sat down at his computer desk, unfolding the envelope and sorting the contents while the soft hum of the machine starting up filled the background. While Blaise clicked at keys, calculating numbers and making entries into spreadsheet columns, programming that didn’t appear in any visible file silently worked in the background, a ticking time bomb, waiting to leave his life a blasted ruin.
Draco suddenly reached for his wand and casually Scougified himself clean of the remnants of his orgasm. Then he stood and stretched, his now limp cock hanging flaccid, sated and content, between his pale thighs. A few short steps and he was in the bath that Harry had been in minutes before, casually applying shampoo with an air of routine boredom that practically denied what they’d just done.
Harry does laugh at that, properly. He feels warmth spreading in his chest, just like earlier with the Firewhiskey. Nothing could make plainer Mrs Weasley's sincerity than her willingness to put another meal on her table.
'Don't think they really had much choice in the matter.' Harry mutters. 'Shall I stick these in the cupboard?'
do that, and now—like ever—he finds his bravado has deserted him and he wants to scamper away and not deal with any of it.
He dithers for a moment. Then, he steels himself and shoves his hands in his pockets and goes to push past Potter and out.
He stares at the door. There are little spots of blackness blossoming at the corners of his vision and he thinks resignedly he'd better get up in the air before anyone notices how incriminating he looks. Or into the shower. He could probably manage a shower. He curls his right hand into a fist and instantly regrets it.
Harry swallows. He hadn't really thought of what Christmas in the castle last year must've been like. At the time he was a bit distracted by a slithery Horcrux masquerading as a decrepit historian.
I was
'They do come off.' Harry tells him.
The last time they were this close Draco had made him come in his hand.
before. He looks studiously back at his laces as Draco drags his Quidditch sweater over his t-shirt. He guesses he's grown out of his sixth-year playing kit by now. Same as him.
It's harder now, more frantic. Harry buries his nails in the back of Draco's neck and kisses him until he opens his mouth for him, lets his tongue inside. The warm, slick wetness of it... Harry thinks he wants to get closer, and he can't, and he pushes at Draco and is mildly surprised when he goes, stumbling the few steps backwards before he hits the wall behind them and lets Harry crowd up against him, pushing his fingers up through the sides of hair.
and holds it out towards Draco's middle.
'Dobby, really, it's fine.' Harry says again, enormously amused at this unexpected standoff. 'We- thankyou for checking I'm okay, but I want Draco here. We're-we've-worked through alot of stuff. We were having Christmas Eve together before I go to the Wheez- the Weasleys.'
Draco lifts his arm behind Harry's head to look at his own watch. His eyes flare. 'Shit.' He shoves Harry off him. Harry feels instantly bereft and kind of hates himself for it.
Dobby looks at him for a moment. Then
'Looks weird.' Draco says flatly and it's Harry's turn to glare.
When he gets to the entrance hall he flicks his wand at his side and the tiles, damp with muddy footprints, are suddenly coated in a sheet of ice, sending half a dozen panicked fourth years slithering on their arses straight into a line of suits of armour that don't quite manage to leap out of the way in time.
'Thanks Dobby.'
Draco swears as he drops two feet back to the mattress, bounces against the edge and lands with an unceremonious thump on the floor.
He presses his lips together then says, quietly: 'Do you want to talk about this?'
'Not long, don't flatter yourself.' He returns. It stings a bit: feels good. 'Slughorn never keeps people after ten.'
Dobby looks at him with an expression which on anyone else might be considered ironic.
'Yes,
has her eye on me. On all the Slytherins.' He gestures sharply towards the castle. 'I imagine she'll be down here any minute to check I haven't done any damage to precious Po—'
He forces his feet to stop. Takes three steps backwards and when he turns around Potter's behind him.
'Well that's that then.' Mrs Weasley says kindly. She puts her hand briefly to his face. 'I'm glad you brought him. I hope we can get to know him better. And put some square meals in him, my goodness, has he always been that skinny?'
'No, Dobby, it's- it's fine, it's
'Dobby is helping the Hogwarts elves with Christmas decorations!' He replies instead, brightening, although his long nose is still glistening with emotion. 'Last year Headmaster Snape forbade Christmas celebrations and the House Elves were confined to the kitchens with threats of being used for target practice, Harry Potter. This year, with the Dark Lord so very, utterly defeated and Harry Potter back at Hogwarts, Dobby wanted the castle to look its very very best!'
'If you're going to hex me you don't need to go to such trouble.' Draco says, trying to press some nonchalance into his words around his heart in his throat.
It had been a pretty miraculous night, all in all. The best Christmas Eve-Eve Harry had had in years, really, between one Voldemort-inspired fuckover and another. So it was probably inevitable, then, that he didn't get the languorous morning of cuddly, uncoordinated necking with his boyfriend, hot chocolate and presents by the fire he wanted. Instead, Harry's awakened at the arse-crack of festive dawn by what can only be described as a
Harry grins.
Quickly, without thinking, he shoves them into his pocket.
Draco's hand is cold, and damp from where he's licked a stripe across it, and he smirks hollowly at Harry's hissed inhale as skin meets skin again. But it warms up quickly, and Harry steadies himself with his elbows either side of Draco's head and closes his eyes and thinks of nothing but how good this feels.
The hot chocolate smells amazing. Harry reaches for his boyfriend's hand; presses close to rest his chin momentarily on the back of his shoulder.
He shows up for Slughorn's detention on time and spends three hours sorting pufferfish eyes and bottling off Salamander spittle into neat sets for each of the twenty desks. It's...embarrassingly soothing. Menial and untaxing and it helps switch his brain off a bit, although the slime under his fingernails is disgusting. Slughorn occasionally murmurs or chuckles to himself, alternating marking a pile of essays with greedily devouring the latest
He tightens his grip on his wand.
!' Draco throws an arm out to protect himself from the barrage of rolled up socks that unexpectedly come pelting at his face. The sudden movement makes him spin lazily in the air.
Draco lifts his sunglasses. 'I was rather hoping we could stick around until Weasley hits a tree or something?'
She continues frowning as she twirls her wand, now scrubbing out the inside of the gravy boat.
'Oh you're
'I know- I know it would've been...Easier if it was Ginny. I wanted that too.' He mumbles and is surprised by how Mrs Weasley pulls back and glowers at him. Her eyes are also damp.

Draco resists the temptation to wander the darkened, silent hallways. It isn't worth the trouble, he knows that: but the urge to be alone in the quiet is a strong one. Pretend the whole school is nothing to him. Stride three times past the Room up on seventh and see if it still knows what Draco needs better than he does. And he's never exactly been above

They glower at each other. Harry opens his mouth to deny him again—possibly to tell him to go off and die in a ditch—but before he can get a word out, Draco presses forward to fit his still-gloved hands around Harry's face and pull their mouths together.
It wasn't uncommon at all, these grand gatherings. What a madcap life it had been, but how fine it had all turned out in the end. No one would have predicted Weasleys feeling at home visiting the Malfoy residence, or a Malfoy lord feasting on holidays at the Burrow, but there you had it. Wherever Harry Potter was involved, miracles seemed to happen in abundance.
The Echoes Of Yesterday…..by Samayel
“P…please…”, and Harry’s lips slipped away from his neck just long enough to whisper an answer.
They passed it off as a meeting to discuss the needs of students, covering for Harry admirably, but it still felt strange to sit in a chair across from John Prewett, sipping tea and chatting idly while the man nudged the conversation into more controversial territory. The questions didn’t come in any order, or with any great pressure behind them, but Harry realized a pattern was emerging, simply encouraging him talk about subjects that seemed unrelated at first, but ultimately guided him toward feelings and memories he’d never discussed. Even though he knew what John was trying to do, Harry was uncomfortable with the entire process, and though he’d made up his mind to think of things he may have repressed, he didn’t offer up any information that John didn’t ask about directly.
"Um... yeah. Just pull them back up."
“That is acceptable…even if your flippant attitude is not. We can discuss that at a later time. If…you will accept Professor Potter’s unusually gracious offer?”
Draco Malfoy was flopped across the bathroom floor, out cold, stark naked and soapy, breathing softly, with a bump on his head from where he'd fallen back out of the shower against the counter. His pulse was fine, and Harry knelt by his side long enough make sure he was actually okay, then rebelled angrily and snatched the bundle of clothes from the floor and found what he was looking for. His half hard prick leaped back to attention and Harry started jerking hard and fast while he still had time.
“I’d kill them myself! I’d make them pay for what they did. For what they left me to! I’d never stop searching until I found them and made them pay! Unlike you, I would have finished the job!”
“Okay. Fine. Yes. I’ve thought about it. Why wouldn’t I? We’ve been dating for months, and these last few weeks…you know the only reason we waited was because we both had children to think of first. If it hadn’t been for that…well…we’d have gotten to this before now. But…the way I see it…if you can even ask me a question like that…then you’ve had the same thing on your mind. I admit that I’ve thought about it. So tell me you haven’t once thought of me…how did you put it? ’Shagging the stuffing out of you.’ Tell me you haven’t thought about it.”
“That’s right. I own all your asses. If you even look at me wrong, you’ll wish you were him. You and you, pick him up and dump him off at the infirmary. You, tell your pals who to come talk to. This cell is now my office, and if you answered to that punkass, you answer to me now. Tell them what happened to him, and tell them to show some fucking respect when they talk to me, or I’ll use them to warm up, then work on the next person I see just for fun. That one stays…he belongs to me now.”
Harry smirked mildly. “Occupational hazard. Save the world a few times, your head swells up, hats stop fitting, and the next thing you know…you’re a sex god.”
Harry explained the terms of these short duels, though everyone new them well from previous years, then marched back to the end of the line and gave the order to begin.
Harry had invited Draco to the Room of Requirement. On Saturday. One week ago. There were only two days left. He’d put Harry off for long enough, and it pained him just to do that.
Harry sighed. “Honestly, I’m hoping he’s so happy to see me that I can keep most of my clothes on while we say hello. With a little luck, I can make sure he’s really calm before he so much as gets a look at this. Maybe if I act blasé enough about it, it’ll rub off. Whatta you think?”
Draco managed to maintain his air of disaffectedness for approximately two bites of éclair, at which point all pretense was lost.
Five o’ clock finally came around, and Harry pulled on his coat and left. He headed for the Outgoing Apparation chambers, where Apparation wasn’t warded against use, and popped into Luna’s entryway. Her place was a spacious, quiet suite of rooms, rented in Knightsbridge for a small fortune, but Luna had no money problems. The décor was glaring in its contrasts, but Harry had never given a damn about what color a sofa happened to be…he cared about the person sitting on it.
The meeting plodded forward only a little longer, with Neville Longbottom discussing a few smaller points along the way, and John Prewett making a few concessions to the worries of others, informing them in vague terms of Harry’s well-being, inasmuch as he could ensure Harry’s relative privacy while doing so. When all was said and done, the gathered staff disbanded and made their way to breakfast eagerly…except for Ron Weasley…who had lost a little of his appetite suddenly.
The passage wound to and fro, and while he was awfully near the chamber where he’d faced the basilisk so many years ago, he couldn’t have been farther away from it in fact. The map showed the great chamber to his left, and yet he’d walked almost half an hour to get to where he was at now. The gloom was oppressive enough that he couldn’t make out anything more than twenty feet away, but there was a faint twinkle ahead, and Harry knew he was quite close to Draco’s position.
This was the real work. Combing through tidbits of possibility, following up on questions that were asked again and again, pushing for one more shred of information that might carry you forward a little to the next step. Good, solid convictions came from hitting the proper suspect with the right charges for the right crime. It wasn’t easy, putting bad people away for a long time, but it sure beat letting them turn the world into a bigger hellhole than it already was!
Harry smiled suddenly, relaxing and looking at Draco with a steady gaze that spoke of admiration.
Secondhand Robes: The Epilogue (part 6)
Harry's brow furrowed in concentration, and he was obviously puzzled as to why Draco would even ask such a question, but he was a man given to brutal honesty, and the answer didn't surprise Draco at all.
It hurt, and he knew he’d hurt Draco every bit as badly as he himself had been hurt, but what price could be put upon self respect? His legs were rubbery, and his knees threatened to quit halfway to the tower, and his aching backside had him limping long before he reached the common room, but he was sustained by a strength he hadn’t known he possessed until that night.
I had difficulty sleeping, suffered a loss of appetite, became irritable and restless without explanation. I had unpleasant dreams for quite awhile, and I stopped seeing my friends and family for long periods of time. This was noticed by my wife, and by other people who knew me well, and I accepted that perhaps counseling might do me some good.
I just slide into arms that will be missed. Soak up the scent of him, clean from the shower he took after exercising. They may have to last me a little while…all those little things about him that tug at my heart and soul. He has to go, and I have to wait, and that’s the way it is. I whisper my answer into his neck.
That sentimentality had only served to lure Harry further into the web of Draco’s lust. A stupid, horny, teenage fly, trapped in the spider web of Draco’s need, eager to be sucked dry and left withered and empty as an object lesson to others. What a fool he’d been.
I storm away, back down the halls and towards the tower where my night of bliss with Harry was spent so recently. I can feel my face burn with genuine anger for the first time in memory. I want satisfaction. I want her to eat her mocking words. I want her bent before me, not as some equal in pleasure, but as a supplicant. If I’m to hurt to have what I’ve worked for…then so be it…but everyone attached to this disgusting matter will hurt with me!
“Yes. I’ll…I’ll be fine. Don’t you have more to ask? More questions? Am I in trouble? Do you…want to know what…what I…”
Despite what Harry assumed were Draco’s best efforts, the Slytherin Prefect was looking haggard, unkempt (for Draco), and troubled. It made Harry’s stomach twist to think that what he’d done might well have hurt Draco more than the attempt on his life.
It was strange to be back in London, but I'd shed my skin and looked nothing like myself by then. The colorful hair, the piercings, the clothes meant to advertise my availability and interests...it all added up to a disguise that worked fairly well as long as no one noticed my scar. By the time I started making the usual rounds at the bars with the worst reputations...I was fairly confident I wouldn't see anyone who would recognize me. Well...we all get things wrong from time to time, right?
“I didn’t mean to do that! I am sorry. Just…you didn’t like me before that. I thought it was because of my father.”
The portrait.
“Yes! Please! Gods! Harry I can’t take this! I want this! And please…bloody hurry!”
Harry entered the baths with a curious confidence in his step that he hadn’t had even a month ago, before Draco had shattered his confidence by rebuffing his attempt to show something more than lust.
------------------------------------------------------------
Draco hadn’t touched another person in weeks. His classmates had decided he was depressed, rendered impotent by some curse, or undergoing some weird spiritual transformation. The most debauched student in the history of Slytherin had been chaste as a nun for weeks, and no one knew why. Except Harry.
Magic tingled around his skin and a wonderful sense of pleasant coolness, rather like a late spring evening, suffused his entire body. He ducked his head beneath the water and surfaced feeling like a new man.
Harry mopped the sweat out of his eyes and hair. Who could have imagined heat like this in England? It was bloody unbearable! Practicing Quidditch in this heat was almost impossible, and they’d been forced to quit early just to avoid losing team members to heatstroke.
{*I AM YOUR MASTER NOW! DO AS I BID YOU!*}
Harry lets go of my hand and gives me a kiss on the head, which sends Ron off to the corner to stare at magazines that probably don’t interest him.
Vinny’s the same as ever, a man of few words…because he doesn’t really know that many of them, but he is loyal, and that speaks well of anyone. Stocky…fatter than I remember, but the suit he’s wearing is pretty decent. He must be making decent cash as someone’s heavy whe he isn‘t looking after Blaise.
“This was worth the wait. I…I trust you, Dray, and…I still want this…now.” Harry leaned back and brought his legs slightly up, then watched Draco move into position while his own heart fluttered in his chest.
Draco looked distracted, as if he was fumbling with something difficult to say, and it didn’t hold out a lot of hope that Harry’s evening would remain peaceful.
Draco's sobs had begun to subside, until the softly breathing and exhausted young man became limp and quiet in Harry's arms. Harry held him still, at perfect peace with his new role. This was no cruel echo of a lost love...this was now his child. His Draco's beloved son. His godson. The boy would never know the Horcrux's true nature, no one would. That knowledge would die with the last survivors of the war against Voldemort...but young Draco would always know that he was loved, that his presence was cherished and desired.
Fumbling about with his own fingers in the shower was a pathetic substitute for Draco’s gentle entries and skillful thrusts. Harry may have wanted Draco to try bottoming for him, but the only pleasures he had ever physically known had come from his time with Draco, and what pleasures they had been! There was no shame in missing that. However badly he wanted to explore the rest with Draco, at the moment, he just missed the way things had been, and the comforts he’d grown used to over the past months.
Kingsley pushed a pin into the map he was working on, detailing the exact locations of crime scenes, as well as power outages and their times in relation to each crime. Dora was on the ragged edge, and to be damned frank, so was he.
“…not my fault! I don’t-”
Harry composed himself, gulping tea, grateful for the chance to talk about something else.
I probably wouldn’t forgive him though. Just say yes, get a few good fucks, and steal everything he’s got before I cut town without warning and start a new life somewhere else. It would have been a tempting offer.
Privacy. The word conjured memories of Harry’s lecture on the subject. This wasn’t the privacy of a room or of personal boundaries of space. This was a deliberate intrusion into his thoughts and feelings. Things he had no desire to share. His grandparents would have sneered at the entire concept. Nothing in his mind was worthy of examination by another…and it was better kept to himself anyway.
“Anything even related to the slugs I saw Ron cough up is off my menu. Next course. It smells incredible, and I promise I’ll keep an open mind and try to enjoy it.”
To be fair, in one of their brief spats, Harry had angrily brought up Lucius, and Draco had turned white, and then crimson, and then refused to speak in anything but monosyllables for the rest of the evening. Harry had swallowed his pride and apologized, and the matter had been brushed over, but he hadn’t forgotten that, in spite of everything, Draco had a love for his family that hadn’t been changed by their involvement with the Dark Lord. Insulting the man’s dead parents had been wrong no matter how you looked at it, and Harry may have sometimes been a fool, but he very rarely made the same mistake twice.
“DID you forget the part about silence!? I will invite answers when I am finished!”
Past encounters had been dominated by pure lust, or tainted ever so subtly by the implication of submission on Harry’s part, or even marred by the mutual knowledge that their ’relationship’ had been built upon the denial that either genuinely cared for the other. No longer. Every cruel illusion that once haunted them had collapsed since then, and the distance between them had slowly diminished until there was precious little that could have brought them closer to each other than they already were.
“It’s not really the kind of thing people can measure, Jamie. You know I still care very much about your mother, right? Draco is…I like Draco every bit as much as I liked your mother. I like different things about each of them, and there are even a few things they have in common that I like about both of them.”
“Dora! Let’s get moving! They picked up the bartender from that Italian club execution back at the start. The guy had been hiding out at his uncle’s place, but a hot tip phoned in and fingered him for a small reward. He’s still getting booked, and it looks like we’re doing the interrogation. Finally something that might drop a lead into our laps.”
Sunlight doesn’t reach in here. The faint blue of the digital clock beside the bed is the only real light. Dawn is coming. The world is waking, but we haven’t yet slept. I’m on my side, in front of him, with his flagging cock buried inside of me while we gently grind against one another, too weak to push any harder than this. Utterly spent. This is how we drift to sleep…fused as one…locked together, his arms holding me close, speared upon the wealth of his desire for me, writhing faintly even as consciousness slips away. Bruised by ardor out of control, still full with him inside of me, whispering words of love…content at last.
Author’s Note: This chapter is dedicated to Sa1Boy, with my thanks for the many kind reviews, especially review 1,500 for Redeem Me. Enjoy, Mart!
That night lingered in more than memory. Hours passed before they slumbered, unaware of anything save each other, curled safe and close in Harry’s bed, sweat slick, disheveled, and heavy with the scent of one another.
"Well…yeah. You're the mother of my children. You have a right to know these things. Believe me…it isn't anything I planned, but anything that might eventually involve Jamie and Lily involves you by default. I figured we needed to decide what's appropriate for them to know…and what isn't."
Harry’s answer was an emphatic nod and the soft grind of Draco’s prick pushing upwards against his chest with need, daubing pre-come along the way.
Getting Off And Getting Even...by Samayel
“Don’t you want to fuck me, Harry? I’m ready for you. Fuck me right here…right now. You know how I want it, don’t you? I want you to fuck me hard, just like this. Don’t fuck around…just come here and take me.”
Greg took his iced tea and cleared his sore throat hurriedly. “I lived there. For weeks. With Vinnie, too. We went to the club, we followed him around everywhere. He never…and I swear to you…never…did anything like that. The cops said he had a warehouse locker full of equipment. We’ve known him since we were kids and we’d never heard of it. None of us even knew why they were there until the cops started askin’ real crazy questions. I mean…we all knew how it is with Blaise…what kinda club he runs…the kinda people he dates. But he never did anything that woulda hinted at that. They said he was makin’ movies and sellin ’em on the internet. He don’t even own a camera. Not even on his cellphone! I’m just sayin’…we woulda known. I’d swear to it, and if I’m wrong…if I’m wrong I don’t care what happens…but I ain’t wrong. Not about this.”
I should have picked up way more black, white, and gray. What else would a person who was in a shitty little cell for so long paint? I didn’t really notice it until I was working on a third canvas, but they’re all distorted scenes of the penitentiary. Hollow-eyed men shuffling mindlessly, staring upwards as if waiting for a miracle or a sign, hungry to see the sun again. Cold-eyed guards in uniforms that blur ever so slightly, watching the milling lines of men in gray.
The benefits were obvious. Harry had never been made so horny, or satisfied so completely, in his entire life. In just a few months, he’d gone from being a shy schoolboy who had enjoyed a few discreet snogs and a bit of wanking in the company of others, to being a hungry, yet confident, sexual creature, experienced beyond the wildest dreams of his housemates.
The backside of Draco Malfoy possessed no flaw. His blond hair was slicked back and reached to just below his shoulders. Lean muscles played beneath the surface of his back while he scrubbed his chest with a washcloth. His skin was like unmarred porcelain…like ivory…like something precious and beautiful that was meant to be handled with the greatest possible delicacy.
A matronly woman, jogging through the surf, tripped over a peice of driftwood and wound up flailing about face down in the sand.
“You owe me about eleven more hours of this…or I’ll never let you live it down.”
So formal. Crisp and utterly unemotional. You get the impression that he considers the place his, and we’re just interlopers who came to mess the place up and make more work for him. Ugh. He totters off and Harry motions for me to follow.
“You know me…I always land on my feet. I was fresh out of the joint when I picked a nice daddy. The rich kind. Too old to get it up, but he loves to keep me around. I already have the easy life. What I don’t have is you. Got a phone number? I can come and go as I please, and if I wanted to get a little something Daddy can’t provide, I could swing by your place sometime and make you remember what you’ve been missing.”
“I’m here! Just bringing more tea.” John Prewett was smirking as he came through the door to his private offices, eyes twinkling furiously while he ignored Harry’s fairly obvious glare of irritation. “What was it that you wanted to talk about, Headmistress? Anything we can discuss right here?”
The cauldrons and rods crashed to the floor while Draco scrambled to regain his mental footing and recover the fallen goods. Despite being past thirty years of age, his voice almost cracked while he hastily answered.
"Gods, Harry! It isn't like there weren't gay kids at Hogwarts when we were there! These are different times. No one cares about that kind of thing as long as you're reasonably discreet and gentlemen about the whole thing. If Malfoy floats your boat…sail him to shore already."
“YOU…YOU INSIPID LITTLE SHIT!”
“Nothing like that. Just needed time alone with my thoughts. Took the long route to get here.”
With a deep breath and a fluttering sense of trepidation, Draco entered the room and closed the door behind him. Harry had been waiting for him, on a large and comfortable looking day bed, naked, save for the thin white sheet that was draped elegantly across his waist, hiding his private parts and contrasting wonderfully with his slightly dark skin.
Snuggling in warm sun, so brazenly, so openly, is intoxicating in its own way. If he hadn’t put me right through the mattress this morning, not five hours ago, I’d probably give the signal for a prompt and sassy little ‘nooner’, but I wasn’t kidding about being a little sore. I pushed the limits a bit yesterday, and I’m paying a little of the price now. Don’t think I wouldn’t, or won’t, do it all over again in a heartbeat though. It was worth every slight twinge and ache a hundred times over.
“Of course. As if! Just because I was away for awhile…it doesn’t mean I lost my memory.”
“I’ll take that martini. I find it disturbing enough that we both named our children for our parents. Funny. I’ve never really talked about Pansy or Cissy with anyone much. Hadn’t really occurred to me that you might be pleasant to be around. You’re a bit of alright, Potter, when it comes right down to it. Just…don’t plan on quoting me on that, understood? Wouldn’t do to let a fine, old rivalry wither on the vine, as it were. Cheers.”
“Mr. Malfoy. This quite directly concerns you, and it brings into question whether it is appropriate for you to remain here. I have records here from Durmstrang. Before I continue, is there anything regarding your time at Durmstrang that you wish to tell those of us assembled here today?”
I’m not really an empty-headed sex toy, but it’s hard to break the comfortable and sensual silence between us. He is so very clearly glad to be home, and I made him that way. He isn’t ashamed to say it either. We don’t speak of serious things, not yet, not when we need so badly just to enjoy being near each other, close enough to reach over and touch when we please, savoring the physical reminder that we really are here, together again.
“Hey…Malfoy…it’s alright. If you really need to talk about something…I promise I’ll listen. Don’t…don’t just shut yourself off from everyone.”
“Given the other student’s popularity, and the cruel nature of the prank, the suspicion of the other children and of some of the staff fell on Draco. He was a pariah before the end of the term. It fits perfectly with the evidence of stunted social development, the lack of trust for other young people, and even his disrespect for the integrity of instructors. Reading the venom in this parchment shows us what kind of environment he was subjected to…for five years! We’re talking about a very gifted, very insecure young man…and this is the kind of trauma that can last for years. I hope you accept my word as valid on this, and given that he seems willing to go through Veritaserum testing if necessary, providing that I’m the person attendant at the time as a witness, I’d swear that what Draco has told is the truth.”
Without so much as a single trace of shame, Draco walked to the bench, his body dripping and glistening as he went, and picked up his towel. Facing Harry unselfconsciously, he rubbed himself dry in a thorough and businesslike fashion, paying Harry no mind whatsoever. When he dried his hair, the front of his entire body was displayed to Harry, and it was every bit as impressive as the back.
Harry pulled his gun and arm back into the car, straightened his shoulders calmly, and holstered the pistol. Ron brought the speed back down to just above legal, making a series of random turns and deliberately confusing moves to put them on streets unrelated to and far away from the ones they’d just been on.
“Well, that brings us to the subject of the hour. I have an initial report to draft now that he’s settled in here and fully vested in Hogwarts’ curriculum. The Ministry will be expecting me to update them as the year progresses, and I’ve made a few small inquiries of my own by requesting more elaborate records from Durmstrang. We’ll see soon enough what they have to say. I haven’t heard much of anything about the lad from the staff. I can only assume that he hasn’t been much trouble?”
Harry would have believed him, but for the tremor of uncertainty in Ron’s voice. Ron was a lousy liar, and even if he’d gotten better over the years, Harry wasn’t easily fooled.
“Good night? Didn’t expect you to be such a sourpuss today…seein’ as you got your groove on the minute the rest of us were outta sight. Figured you’d be all smiles.”
How Draco wanted to savage that mouth with a kiss, or fold his arms around those slender shoulders that carried so much weight, and just hold someone he genuinely desired close to himself. He wanted to witness that beautiful face afire with orgasm, or gazing back at him fondly. He hungered to feel that body shudder with genuine pleasure...not pain or relief from some ailment of the spirit that warped everything and everyone into a torment. He couldn't voice it, but at least at a distance he could think it.
It’s intolerable. There MUST be a way to escape these soft chains I’ve placed around my heart. I am the prisoner of the trap I designed, and I am not a creature lightly caged. There MUST be a way to free myself of this! Something…something must give, but my pride forbids that it be me! All that I have been and done cries out for a resolution that leaves me atop a hill of the defeated! This cannot be me, torn between the soppy love of fables and the realities of Slytherin society!
Harry’s reaction had been less than calm. “What!? You knew? Are you kidding me? I kept this to myself for twenty years…and you knew?”
Harry collapsed onto Draco's back, kissing his neck and whispering his affections into Draco's ear. He stroked Draco's sweat and seed drenched back idly while catching his breath. Draco was in a state of near shock, traditionally sex left him energized and happy, but while he was definitely happy... he was utterly exhausted, so spent he could barely move or speak. Gods, the things that Harry made him feel! He'd never imagined that anyone could so routinely strip him of any sense of control. Even as a bottom, he had always dominated his previous sexual partners, making them serve his appetite for sex as he wished them to... until Harry. His woolgathering was suddenly interrupted by the realization that Harry was speaking to him. "Draco, love? Are you alright... can you say something... are you okay, baby?" There was a growing note of concern in Harry voice.
“No!” Draco’s voice was tremulous and hoarse, and a thread of desperation was clear in it.
They both nodded grudgingly, and Draco stomped to the door, slamming it behind him. Harry bit his lip keeping his silence, then stalked back toward his office, the look on his face scaring newer people out of his path.
“Shhh! You’re bloody pissed! Y-you couldn’ Apparate from…from here to the other side a the street w’out leavin’ behind your head!”
Sunlight. Very bright, skull-stabbing, eye-assaulting sunlight. Pain. Not the rather annoying, ’give me two aspirin’ kind of pain, but rather the ’how long do I have to live’ kind of pain. Harry tried to move his arm to shade his eyes, but found that it was paralyzed. Panic struck a second later, and he flicked a bitter eye open, only to realize that he wasn’t paralyzed, just hampered by the man who was curled against him, sleeping on top of his arm.
Draco stifled a whimper. It would be terribly undignified to transform into a simpering puddle in the midst of Fortescue’s. Damn the ice cream! What the bloody hell could anyone do when told something like that…by someone they genuinely wanted, badly enough to fight for, even when it looked like it was pointless or completely implausible? Draco placed his spoon on the table calmly, rose with all the grace he could muster, tugged on his jacket and turned to Harry with a nod of agreement.
Harry barely supressed a snicker, then got his poker-face back into place. "Poor Ron. I'm afraid the die is cast. Choose your lot."
Harry paused from a mouthful of eggs and sausage. “I don’t know, but it looks more like your appetite is ruining that tray.”
Neville was hurrying off to prep the staff room, and Harry fiddled with his hair and robes just a bit more, still feeling out of place in professor's robes after fifteen years. Some days, like today, it was hard was hard to believe he'd ever been a wide-eyed little boy, wandering the halls and being spooked by ghosts and staff alike, and it was equally hard to believe that he had found himself a home here, even if everyone else simply thought of him as Professor Potter.
Dora snatched the coffee off of her desk and grabbed her coat. Kingsley was unusually perky this morning…which was probably almost directly linked to Deirdre being in a better mood now that they’d gone back to almost normal shifts. Maybe Dawlish and Scrimgeour were glory hounds, but they had their own staff handling the work that had really been more than two people could handle. It was good to get home at a decent hour, even if the sting of being moved out of the top slot for the investigation hadn’t completely dimmed.
We talked…after. He was upset mostly because he was scared, but also because I cringe when I think things are going to get violent. Especially with him. I’ve started to realize that, just because I believe in him and love him, it doesn’t mean that I’ve forgotten my instincts. Getting hit is something you get used to…something you learn to expect when dealing with alpha males. I usually use sex as a distraction, but I fall back on complete submission when I think I’m in real danger.
Draco makes a face, then cowers a bit as Dobby stalks across the rumpled sheets towards them.
Dobby, it's-it's fine,' Harry says, charitably repressing memories of the entirety of second year. 'I just, I understand. Thankyou for being my friend, and looking out for me.'
Fuck, he is so fucked. Fuck.
'Do you want me to..?'
?' He waves a hand at Draco. 'He's not gonna hurt me
Dobby looks at Harry. Then, slowly, he turns his big eyes on Draco. Pulls off one of his socks
'No, I-' Potter replies. The line of his lips tightens. 'Look. I brought your gloves back.' He says and fishes in his robes' pocket.
It's a different angle and it's...really weird...having a cock in his hand that isn't his own, but, well: Harry's been a teenage boy for a pretty long time now.
'I'm not going to hex you Draco—'
Harry's just in time to catch Draco around the waist as he snarls and dives for Dobby's ears, holding him back as there's another loud crack of magic and the two of them are suddenly being attacked by the flailing curtains of Harry's four-poster.
It feels like the first time he travelled by Floo powder: his head spinning, the floor slipping from under his feet...
Draco rolls his eyes so hard it's audible.
(Harry really wishes people would stop slamming things.)
Carefully, Harry pushes his wand into his pocket. Reaches across with cold fingers and pulls Draco back to him.
Harry snorts. Has to swipe the wetness away from his eyes again. But Mrs Weasley's looking very serious.
He heads outside; finds Draco at the garden table with Hermione, watching Ron and Ginny racing each other to the old yew at the end of the far field and back, Ron looking green-faced but determined as Ginny loops him and laughs. Harry puts his hand to the back of Draco's neck and feels him shift his head a little into the touch.
Dobby meets his gaze with wet eyes: 'Dobby will always be Harry Potter's friend.'
, what the
though, am I?'
'Hang on—' Draco says roughly, pulls back. Harry blinks.
'With all these people about?'
'Stop following me.' He says, in a tone that Harry just...can't interpret at all. Despite everything, Harry half thinks (hopes) he's going to kiss him again. But he doesn't. He just looks at him for a second longer before he shucks his kit bag further up his shoulder and stalks out, smacking the door off the wall once again.
worse than a dagger to the chest, Harry Pott
'...Dobby doesn't question the great charity and benevolence of Harry Potter.' He says eventually, in a voice that is, actually, very bloody questioning. He steps down from the bedpost onto the mattress; spares a withering glance for Draco's floating form. 'But Dobby served the Malfoy family for many, many years. Young Master Malfoy is a bad boy.'
Fuck, the team. Harry glances for the wall clock. It's stopped, of course.
Draco is already slick and this makes it easier. Experimentally, Harry drags his fist along the other boy's length. He's shivering so hard he's surprised he can move at all, but he takes Draco mouthing silent expletives at the ceiling as a good sign and does the same thing again, and again, shifting his hand to get a better grip, and Draco moves his hips and it doesn't take too long before they find a scrappy kind of rhythm, Harry pushing his own erection hard against Draco's thigh as he works his hand. Draco's trying very hard to stay quiet, but every tiny, needful sound that falls from between his lips is like a spark landing on Harry's bare skin and he realises...He wants this. He wants this quite alot. Trying to ground himself a bit, he cards the fingers of his other hand through the front of Draco's hair, messing it up purposefully and irreparably, and he holds Draco's gaze as he strokes him, faster and faster, and finds he isn't embarrassed at all.
He’d been out of the doctor’s care for less than two hours. They’d taped the gash over his left eye, set and bandaged his nose, cleaned and dressed the worst scrapes and small cuts and even…miracle of miracles…given him a painkiller that was almost worth a shit. He’d been out cold for most of the day after that, and allowed to rest up until the doctor was sure he was stable. Then they dumped him back into population. He was back in the city jail…among the temporary holding places for people who had been charged and arrested but hadn’t yet been tried and sentenced. If his lawyer hadn’t been a sniveling piece of shit, if he’d been able to reach the guy he’d been referred to, if they hadn’t been making him so hard to fucking find…he’d have posted bail and been out of here by now. At this fucking rate he could have been assigned a lawyer by the state and gotten things moving faster, but a state appointed lawyer was the equivalent of saving the cops the trouble and just shooting yourself in the face. The whole situation was fucked.
The speed with which Draco recovered from his moment of grief was utterly shameless. "Trust me, nothing will happen. Do it, Harry. Do it just for me. If you really love me, you'll trust me and give it a try. I promise you nothing will happen." Draco was back to cooing plaintively before the moisture in his eyes had even dried, but it worked on his Harry, just like it always did. He kept his face serious, but deep in his little Slytherin heart, he was congratulating himself on keeping his boyfriend fully wrapped around his finger.
“Yes. Absolutely yes. Not just because of Harry, either, but I admit to that being the biggest part of it. Keep Harry, fight evil, get rich, and do it all while helping to save the world? I’d have to be crazy to say no to that. I’m all yours, signed, sealed and delivered. Here’s the contract.”
It became necessary for Ron to flee the common room almost immediately after that comment.
“Now this…is the best…birthday…I’ve ever…had. Mmmm.”
I don’t give a flying fuck about what you were or where you’ve been or anything you felt you had to do along the way! None of that means shit to me! All I know is I’m crazy about Drake here and now. So forgive me if I take fucking exception to the idea that you’re some kind of whore! I would never have a whore in my home…or in my bed…or anywhere else for that matter! So drop that thought and leave it behind or I’ll…I swear I’ll…”
“We had a lot of weird events that all tied into the first killings after the riot…little things that hinted at big things, but we couldn’t make a solid connection. It’s my hunch that they mean more than people think, but I couldn’t prove it in a court of law. First…power outages on the nights of the first killings, targeting specific neighborhoods for exactly the few minutes it would take a killer to leave the scene. No cameras or other evidence left behind. Second…computer records from the prison referring to Harry Black completely disappeared, and even though he was supposed to have been transferred to the SuperMax facility, no one ever heard from him again. The guy just disappeared like he never existed in the first place. Third…within a few weeks of these incredibly clean, execution style killings, all using different methods, different guns, and targeting different organizations, the power outages stop and the gangs start killing each other off on their own.
Dora and Remus rolled their eyes and restrained their smirks. Luna and her conspiracies. What a freaking trip!
When he’s gone, my mind is back, even if it flutters with memories of him and crazy, lurking desires at every turn. I can think about where I am and what I want, and even here…now…lonely and horny and curled around a book and a glass of mimosa, I want him back. He wants me to define myself…and I think I want to let myself be defined by him. I could be anything I want, but I am a lazy fool because I want nothing more than to be his?
“The cruel eld doth palsy. The price of long years I suppose. A man cannot expect to cheat Death of his due forever, and I’ve already made quite a good run of it. Needn’t worry. It hasn’t really diminished my enjoyment of life in any meaningful way…although…I do rather miss clapping. It seems wrong to never applaud something when the occasion seems right for it.”
"This is the almighty savior of the wizarding world?"
“No Malfoy has ev’r, ev’r, EV’R…lowered…themselves t’ crude con…confer…conveyance! I’d sooner splinch!”
“I have…gotten the impression that…my father was not, to put it in as politic a way as I can, well-liked here. You don’t seem to share the petty prejudices that others might indulge themselves in. I assume that this is why your reputation for wisdom is well-deserved. May I ask what you thought of my father? You did know him while he was in school here, didn’t you?”
“I guess you love a lot of weird things, don’t you? That certainly explains how you wound up with me. I wouldn’t trade that for the world. I may never like brains, or snails, or cold soup, but I know I’ll always love you. I’m sorry, love. I freaked out a bit, and I didn’t mean to get that worked up. The wine is perfect, and the company is amazing. Forgive me?”
After a nice dinner and some conversation with Therese and Maria while we clean up the kitchen, I take my leisure in the library, in the huge, padded leather chair next to a small table and an exquisite little lamp. It’s just me and Samuel Taylor Coleridge for a few hours. Even through the opium, the man’s brilliance shines. Don’t think ill of him for being stoned most of his life. He had afflictions of several kinds that would have left him in crippling agony if it hadn’t been for the soothing power of the poppy. He produced his most scintillating works within a few years, captivated the attention of his peers even during his own time, and he produced very little that wasn’t memorable. The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, Christabel, Kubla Khan…all three poems have endured as classics for almost two hundred years. The English, in the great scheme of things, may have been a big thorn in the rest of the world’s ass, but the bastards really knew how to write.
Draco pinned Harry’s knees to his chest and started thrusting slowly again. Always he aimed for the spot he now knew drove Harry crazy with pleasure, and though Harry’s cock had softened, it twitched to life slowly while Harry moaned and thrashed with desire.
Harry Potter had looked utterly psychotic, almost crazed with rage and grief. Draco should have known better than to bait him. He should have done something different, anything, but he hadn’t. He pushed the man a little further and all hell had broken loose.
Harry hadn’t realized that Hermione might share the compliment with Draco quite so openly, and it took him off his guard. “Well…yes, in some ways. Professor Granger-Weasley, her husband, and I went to this school together. She was always a superb student in every sense of the word. She sometimes neglected her social life in exchange for additional opportunities to learn, and while that worked out well enough for her, I still think you might make the most of your time here by letting yourself make some friends. She, her husband, and I have been friends for a very long time, and that’s as precious an accomplishment to me as the education I received here, if not quite a bit more so.”
Ron shuddered. “Brrr…weapons that kill cars. Bad. I hate them on principle. Good for us, but it still makes me queasy just thinking about it. You got any idea how hard it is to replace or repair the onboard computer for a new car? It’s a lot worse than cleaning the upholstery because you had a good date night!”
‘Yes!’“I don’t even know what books to ask for, I didn’t worry about these things until after Harry was in the picture. I just need books that are explicit about what I should do to please a lover. If you find them, I’ll read them and have them back before the weekend is over. You have my word on it.”
Draco looked ecstatic, wanton, and triumphant. His face was flushed, and his right hand was working furiously. He still had the presence of mind to give Harry a broad wink just before he closed his eyes and tipped his head back as orgasm overtook him.
"Draco."
And that’s that. One phone call later, a date will be set and the clock starts ticking toward the end of Blaise’s carefree life. Maybe I’m a son of a bitch for doing it this way, but I wanted this, and now I’ll have it. Blaise Zabini is going down.
“Bloody Hell, mate! It’s going on seven. Snape does his walk through in a half hour! You do like to live dangerously, don’t you?”
Kingsley tugged gently at the sleeve of Dora’s coat, and the reminder of his presence grounded her. She’d put too many hours in, and was tired right down to her bones, and frankly more than a little emotional about the implication that they’d failed. The meeting room was quiet for a moment while their superior nodded calmly.
Narcissa smiled softly. “Yes, indeed. I believe, my dear young man, that, despite every expectation to the contrary, you and I are in perfect agreement.”
There was no sign of his presence even being acknowledged, and Draco panicked a second before wresting control of himself. They shouldn’t find him like this. Tear-stained and rumpled, whiskey and shattered glass everywhere. He deserved better than this. The wards could be dealt with in a moment, but he could salvage a shred of the man’s dignity right now.
"Smartass! True 'nuf though. Can't blame anyone for finishing here. Still the best school in the world for my money. C'mon! With Potter and Weasley on the job, who'd let their kid miss out on a four-star education?"
Harry chuckled softly. It was a refreshing level of honesty from Draco. “Okay...okay...just hit play. We'll train up and then see what we can do...together. I think...as long as its with you...I'm going to be happy no matter what it is we get up to.”
“Draco.”
Malfoy’s snicker was as genuine as his smile. “Really, Harry. This morning was a bit of a farce, but upon reflection, it wasn’t so awful. If you’re feeling a bit less inclined to abuse a guest verbally, you could repay my small kindness by taking me to a decent dinner somewhere. Just nice to get out once and a while, and you really were good company last night. If you rule out this morning’s chaos, I had a wonderful time last night, and sad to say, my life has been sorely lacking in them for too long.”
’Ron Weasley! Is it absolutely necessary for you to be a complete and total ass?! After this long, and you can’t even at least manage that without putting forth so much extra effort?! Please!
So matter of fact, but I can tell he’s impressed, unsure of what to say while he peers at them one after another.
One soft hand was massaging the muscles behind his balls, the other was smoothly stroking his shaft, and Draco’s mouth was working its own magic at the head. Holding out longer than a few minutes was a lost cause.
I can hear that throaty chuckle from him. He has a cruel streak. He really does. The toy keeps flirting…in…out…almost out, then in just a little before he pulls it away entirely and rolls to his right. I have no idea when he cracked the edge of the foil around that condom, but it’s the most joyful sound I’ve ever heard while I shudder with relief, hearing him rip the rest of the package open, knowing that, already wet and ready for him, my wait is almost over. I’ll be connected to him, filled by him, feeling him hot and alive within me again…so very, very soon!
“What? You do?” The crestfallen look of shock and hurt was pure and puppyish in its innocence.
“Good. Stay still, stay silent, and this will be fairly brief and easy. Move around and you’ll be swapping one scar for another. Understood?”
I can actually hear his teeth grinding. “Great night. Yeah. For you. I spent the last couple hours getting hit on…by GUYS! Not really my idea of fun.”
“I think you deserve to hear the rest, Harry. You guessed some of it, but there are things I don’t think you could understand. Fuck all, I didn’t understand them until recently. It took weeks just to get it all out and look at it from a distance, and my therapist told me a lot of things about the way I treated you, and how it related to Flint.
“Sure. You know I’m not worried about that. You don’t have to do anything for me. I love this…this life we’ve got here. I love you, and I’m happier than I’ve probably got any right to have expected, but I’m all ears if you want to try something new. Just don’t feel like you have to because of me.”
“You did not make me sick. You didn’t make me remember anything. I’ve always remembered, and I’ve run away from it all for a very long time. You made me stop running. I’m grateful. If I’d faced any of the things I should have faced years ago, you couldn’t have provoked me. I’ve been nursing the same old wounds for much too long and frankly I feel like I’m waking up after a long, bad dream. I’m not sorry that any of this happened…not anymore. I’m just sorry that you got pulled into this. It wasn’t anything you did, it’s just who you are. Can you understand that?”
Water splashed behind Harry and he looked back to see Draco standing up behind him, looking at Harry almost reverently, yet tinged with a dark and powerful lust that fluttered just beneath the surface of Draco’s famous self control.
Harry only took a couple of steps into the water, stopping midway in. His hand slid down his stomach in lazy circles that Draco watched with interest, until it reached the downy fur that surrounded his rapidly rising cock. Harry ran his fingertips down the length of it, pausing at the head, tipping his chin back and smirking wickedly.
I can walk in heels again. I knew a little practice would bring it right back. It’s like riding a bicycle…you never really forget how to do it. I’m getting fretful waiting for Harry, but the food is good, and the girls are nice, and everything is so comfortable that I can wait a little longer if I have to. I trimmed my nails back, since Maria has some press-on nails I can wear later. I hate to waste all the effort I just put into my own nails, but at least now I can play the piano a little more deftly.
“Sir Albus?”
I stopped being Flint’s bitch the minute Harry broke Flint in front of me, but today…today I’m really free. A laser scalpel burned away the last evidence that a mirror could show, the last remnant of a life that got flushed down the toilet because of the things I’ve done and the choices I made. The rest is up to me. The past is dead, and the shadow of it is buried in a clean, white, sterile little room in the suburbs.
Harry grinned hugely, all flushed cheeks and giddy cheer. “Beg to differ, Ron. You’d take that much time, too…if you got off five times…and each one was better than the one before it. Take my word for it, mate…we’re doing it right.”
“How? How did you get out? I…I saw the news. I’m glad you’re alive.” He’s standing behind my right shoulder, ice clinking in his glass while he sips his scotch. The smoldering nearness of him makes my skin hot and prickly.
“No, as a matter of fact, I’m not. Remember…I don’t get around that much. When I really feel enthusiastic about someone, it isn’t that unusual for me to stay excited for quite awhile before I finally tire out. Ginny and I were the same way for the first two years. We were like bunnies on Ecstasy.”
I arranged for a few mischances to fall upon his other regulars. A couple of jailings, some visits to relatives, an inexplicable free vacation, what have you. Just a few magical interferences and some money to push things along and the deeds were done without anyone the wiser or any great harm. By the end of the month I had him mostly to myself, which is what I wanted. I don't like to share. Secondhand goods don't appeal to me, and Potter certainly started smelling better after getting showers on a regular basis.
Self respect was a fine thing, Harry thought, but it had a price of its own as well. He was lonely. Not for friends…he had those and loved them dearly. He was lonely for Draco’s touch, and in a way he hadn’t expected, given that the past several months had involved seeing Draco every night.
He paused and flopped back against a wall, catching his breath while his thoughts raced. Harry had been…incredibly decent. Speaking openly of Durmstrang, and of the event that had set him apart from the rest of the students…it had been intoxicating. Cathartic. Sweeter than any wine or candy by a thousand fold! No one had so consistently proven that they cared enough to even listen to him, not for eighteen years, and now Prewett and Harry both allowed an openness he’d never imagined. To say things like those, and to go without being judged in haste. It had made him reckless.
“You know mother and I had…the ’talk’…about girls and boys and all that. It’s not like I don’t know at all about that stuff. I just wondered…that’s all. I mean…you couldn’t really blame a person for wondering…could you?”
The Echoes Of Yesterday…by Samayel
“Yeah. No worries. We have enough people here to do this without keeping you here all night. Besides…the map’ll likely sort this out shortly enough. Give ‘mione and the kids my love then.”
Harry had come to the conclusion that he was bisexual more than a year ago, but Malfoy had never been part of that equation. Cho Chang was pretty. So was Ginny. And to Harry’s mind, so were Seamus and Oliver Wood. All he’d ever seen of Malfoy was a sneer or a scowl…until now.
It’s the first time he’s ever spoken of getting hurt doing what he does, and I can’t suppress the chill that runs down my spine, even while the rest of me is intoxicated by the idea of kissing this filthy fucking scar goodbye. When you carry a mark like this, you get used to it, and it becomes a part of you. I feel like I could actually shed my skin and move on, leaving that place and time behind me forever. Of course, the image of a bullet tearing through his perfect flesh just destroys my elation on the spot. He is perceptive. He pulls me a little tighter when I shiver, kissing my head.
“FUCK! Fuckers! Fucking fuckers! I hate replacing glass! Can’t you just kill these cockroach fucks?! To hell with subtle! We’re doing eighty miles an hour and dodging traffic! This is NOT subtle! We hafta get the fuck outta here…with no tail…NOW!”
And yet…here I remain. Exactly that.
Drop the hooks into the water…and let’s see if the fish are biting. Vinny leads me down the hall, stopping at the door to what must be the kitchen. I can smell garlic and good sauce wafting through the air.
Harry’s vision blurred while utter self hatred and nausea overwhelmed him. He stumbled out of the bath and staggered into one of the toilet stalls just before his rebelling stomach forced what was left of his dinner out and into the toilet bowl.
“I suppose you already knew that part though.”
“WHAT!?”
The miserable little man-mattress beside him shrugs and lips up.
Horses, as Ron found out, are quite a bit different from cars. For instance…if you’re uncertain and don’t know what to do next…a car doesn’t sense it and respond accordingly, just leave it alone and it'll do its job...at least if its automatic transmission. The staff was kind enough to chase Ron down on horses of their own, allowing Harry and I to have a quiet ride after they wrestled for control of the rather spirited stallion Ron picked, which ran off with him hollering bloody murder all the while. His face was as red as his hair when they brought him back. I can’t help but tease just a little.
Then Harry finally paused, breathing faintly heavily, and his eyes were tinged dark by visible lust. There was something pleading, searching and yet respectful in them.
“Anything you want.”
Minerva smile at Harry’s wry smirk, and nodded approvingly. Albus’ portrait had woken up and applauded lightly, smiling down at them.
He’d grown more confident, and more aggressive, as the weeks had passed. With a hand firmly holding Malfoy’s chest to the wall, Harry dropped to his knees. He’d tasted his own come more than once by now, and Malfoy’s as well on several occasions. There was no shyness in him when he licked Draco’s body clean of every trace of their respective orgasms, even working his way teasingly along the flesh of the cock he had previously only touched with his hand.
The world swirled around them and the cottage dissolved, and Harry found himself in a vast and superbly decorated ballroom, still alone with Draco, still in the arms of his lover. Music played on charmed instruments in the background, and Draco had twined his fingers into his hand.
Draco shuddered. This didn’t bode well at all. “Marinated and seared calf brain.”
“Very well, but don’t short change yourself. If you have a question, however small it might seem, feel free to ask it. I’ll see in you the usual classes, and after if you have any questions. You are excused.”
Had it all been worth it? Turning his back on the Phoenix Corporation, slipping information to Riddle until he’d been forced to flee, signing a deal with this living devil just to secure a living for himself where his former employers could never find him?
The office. Those words meant something entirely different now. Now they had offices in Malfoy Manor, with huge and ancient desks and comfortable surroundings with properly compensated hired house elves to see to their comforts. Harry didn't like paperwork...or long meetings...but he'd carefully picked a staff that would translate legal documents into legible forms and do the investigative work he needed to be sure of proper candidates. It was a good cause. He felt good about it. He woke up knowing that he'd made a difference and that it mattered.
“You want to…come? We’ve only started, love. I can…if you want?”
What if he’s like Blaise? He was kind to me…in there…but he was on the job, making things happen, and he needed a quiet accomplice. Maybe he was nice because…because he wanted me to stay quiet, and not betray him like I did Flint. He could get here and be different now that his job is done. I’m too scared to be turned on or horny anymore. The rush of freedom is still with me, but I don’t feel anything like what I felt the first night. I’m a very pretty toy, and the kind of men that want me get bored with all their toys eventually. Some hate to admit their own infidelity, and their cruelty is the way they amuse themselves in their boredom, so that, when you run from them, they can call you the coward, and absolve themselves of all blame because you left them.
There are other pictures, some just as informative in their own way as the ones of his parents.
“Well, it’ll happen a lot more if you don’t start moving! NOW!”
The serpent that had attacked Draco was a Soul Winnower, and came from West Africa. It was an ancient creation of Dark magic, and a servant to powerful wizards and witches. They were incredibly rare, but possessed intelligence far beyond a normal snake’s, and they were highly resistant to magic. The venom they carried was not merely deadly, but also horrifyingly painful, leaving victims screaming for hours as the toxin destroyed internal organs before it stopped their hearts. Draco had nearly met such a fate, and Harry felt a prickle of fear when he thought about how close a call it had been.
Draco nodded and Apparated home with a muted pop. Sleep easy. Sleep easy, he said. If only it were that easy. Another glass of wine later, Draco Malfoy fell asleep in the canopied antique masterpiece that was his bed. The last person he’d shared it with had been the woman who took their child from him and hid her away at all costs. He hadn’t once considered sharing it with another person, male or female, since the divorce. He’d never let any of his trysts into his personal life.
The Savage Gambit (Part 9)...by Samayel
In the history of comedy, there have been many great strides forward. From ancient Rome’s comic plays and farces to amuse the masses, to the more contemporary Shakespeare’s careful quatrains. The humble Punch And Judy shows and Voltaire’s skewering satires. Then came Ron attempting to ride a horse.
I hear thy name spoken,
“I didn’t hear an answer! AM I UNDERSTOOD?”
But Harry was a lot more than that…wasn’t he?
‘There’s no one like you, Harry. No one.’
Draco put down the fork, eggs and all...swallowed his tea and tried not to let his hand shake when he placed the cup to the saucer. He'd nodded yes, but talking only made this worse. All he could do was stare at the plate in front of him.
He had other talents he bragged of loudly, not that many listened. In the nearly six years since the wars end he'd taken the mantle of the Malfoy name despite the damage done to it and not given a damn if his conduct injured it any further. He had his own interests at the forefront of his mind, and with his parents dearly departed in the chaos of those final days, he'd simply shuttered and locked the mansion and moved to London where he could pursue his own interests at his leisure.
