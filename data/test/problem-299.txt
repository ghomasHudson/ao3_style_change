“I’ve got to go for dinner in Ottery St Catchpole.” Harry looks across at Draco as they walk. “Otherwise—”
“Not a word,” Draco mutters. The bitter taste left in his mouth from discussing his father fades and he gets a peculiar flutter of excitement in his stomach at the thought of there being somewhere for people like him. Somewhere the
The only people who had been in Dumbledore’s office weren’t talking, and he wondered if that was due to Umbridge. Was she mad that Dumbledore had slipped through? Or was she embarrassed?
“Freedom. They don’t understand what it’s like for Dobby. Dobby gets to choose what he wants, and Dobby
“Not quite so hungry anymore.” Harry shrugs and fiddles with one of the beer mats. “In a bit, maybe.”
“And we are going to have so much fun. I can show you the new greenhouse Gran set up. It’s nothing big, just a small space, but it’s big enough for the Devil’s Snare I’ve been growing since first year.”
Snuffles let out an odd noise as Lupin shook his head rapidly. “Lupin is fine. Mister Lupin doesn’t quite fit me.”
“They think that I can offer something that she can’t. And I suppose compared to her, then I wouldn’t make a bad teacher, though I’m not really qualified, you know? I’m just a teenager, really. What do I know?”
Chaos erupted as his fellow Slytherins ran at the noise of the walls shaking, some rubble falling onto the table and into the food.
There was nothing that could make his life easier to deal with, nothing to make his father be a better person, and nothing to make the world a safer place.
Before Draco could respond, Weasley pulled Potter into a boring conversation regarding Ministry policies. He could have saved him, but what was the fun in that?
As the Dark Lord turned towards Draco, he knew that he had to remain calm and not show the panic and horror that had seized him. His father had promised Draco’s servitude? Promised something that was not his to give away?
Draco ignored the curious stares from his peers when an owl flew into the opened window of the History of Magic classroom. He rushed forward, knowing exactly what the letter was—his parents only liked to send things during breakfast where they could show off gifts—and no one else would have sent anything to him.
Draco nodded once to Potter and Granger. He tried to nod to Weasley too, but it was more of a grimace and a jerk of his head… but it was
.” He grimaces. “We don’t want a load of people coming in just to have a gawk, either. Next thing you know we’ll be having hen parties at our drag nights like those Muggle bars.”
“Not anymore.” Draco rubs his arm and presses his lips together, fighting back the heat in his cheeks. “Not for a long time.”
Draco wanted to continue with his point, wanted to tell Potter that he could still do what he wanted, but the hypocrisy burned his throat. He understood what Potter meant, understood exactly why doing what one wanted didn’t always pan out.
Harry padded back and forth in front of the sitting room fire at Grimmauld Place, waiting anxiously for Draco to fling open their bedroom door and strut out onto the landing, only to noisily but evenly descend the stairs and pause at the mirror in the entryway to check his hair. Then they'd be on their way—but not before Draco had a quick twirl or two in front of the grand full-length mirror.
But that was just as scary. Draco wasn’t sure what happened to Regulus, and the letters weren’t an absolute truth, there could be problems in them—and it wasn’t as if Draco could fact check any of it. It was either trust Regulus’ words, or discount them completely.
“I’m not sure.” Neville was watching the spot Potter disappeared from with a frown. “There are many plants that have magical affinities that could help.”
“I didn’t know that,” Draco promised, not liking the distance. “I’ve only just found out. I don’t know what it does, but I can promise you that it’s nothing good. You need to get rid of it.”
“Why?” Potter takes a bite of his cake and lets out a sinful groan of pleasure. “Would you like to come over for your tea one night?”
“Oh, come on.” Harry pulls Draco over him and looks up at him, heartbreakingly lovely. “I’m not a blushing virgin, just get your cock inside me and stop being so noble.”
Potter blinks at Draco. His lips twitch as if he’s trying not to smile. “Is it the logistics that are bothering you?”
“They aren’t normal dreams, Hermione!” Potter’s voice increased in volume and his hands started to shake. “How do you explain Ron’s dad, then? What about that? I knew what had happened to him.”
“Mistakes are inevitable,” Potter said as they locked eyes. “Even if this is a mistake, then it’s one that I can always fix later on. No path is irreversible.”
“Bully for you.” Draco glances at Harry. “I don't care. I don't mind talking about it. I'm not ashamed of any of it, even the days when I was fucking just to feel wanted by someone for a change.” He sounds fiercer than he intended and Harry turns properly to him, his eyes fixed on Draco. There's a warm curiosity behind his expression, a flash of empathy and understanding that takes Draco by surprise.
“He loved you,” Harry says. It makes Draco irrationally angry because Potter doesn’t understand the first thing about Lucius Malfoy, or how men like Draco’s father place conditions on their
Voices could be heard, but neither moved. Draco lowered his head till it was resting on Neville’s shoulders.
“But why? Why does there have to be violence to know peace? Why can’t there be good in the world? Why do people like my father have to perpetuate their beliefs?”
They walk in easy silence and Harry is as lost in his own thoughts as Draco is. There’s something dizzying about being above ground, out in the open, and brushing up against one another as they sip the coffees they grabbed from Soho.
“Not many of those.” Draco takes the invitations to scrutinise Harry’s face. He’s hardly the careworn, lovelorn man the
“That’s good,” Draco whispered as he placed his head on Neville’s shoulder. “You deserve to be happy.”
Draco clasped his hands together as his mind whirled. If he went, he’d have to face the opinions of others, the opinions of students who didn’t know him—didn’t know who he really was. No one Potter invited would be willing to see a different side of him.
“Arthur is ill, is he?” Augusta said as she ushered them out of the room. “I’ll have to send the house elf over with a basket of goods. I’m sure Molly would appreciate it. Must be stressful with so many children to take care of and handle Arthur being ill too.”
, he’s going to get the full force of Draco’s very best seduction techniques. If he thinks he can throw Draco off his game just because he’s had more anonymous fucks than you can shake a broomstick at, he’s sorely mistaken.
McGonagall sobers. “Ah yes. We volunteered for a group who set up lesbian blood drives. My one deepest regret as part of my work at Hogwarts is that I have never successfully been able to ensure the syllabus equips witches and wizards with an understanding of the history some want us to forget, and to provide them with the resources to take the best care of their sexual health.” She tuts under her breath. “Professor Snape held one extra-curricular class in the late eighties and everybody was so traumatised it simply never returned.”
Before Draco could tell Potter that he was being weird, Potter stood up and looked towards Dumbledore’s office.
Draco fights back a rush of heat which threatens to leave him embarrassingly flushed. There’s something quite peculiar about being at the swapping numbers stage with Potter. It’s dangerously flirtatious. Even adding his number into Potter’s phone before giving it to him felt like an invitation of sorts.
He had never given much thought to Thestrals, but he was curious to hear what Potter thought. Draco wasn’t sure he would ever want to see them.
“What is it?” Draco asked curiously. He could tell that it was a portrait, but why would Sirius want to show him that? Was it an heirloom of some kind?
Ah, there it was. Draco had finally found the chapter about mending bones, and was now trying to figure out how many drops of Skele-Gro he could safely administer to Git in order to heal his wing. Thank Merlin, all the potions and ingredients from the Manor — at least those which weren’t confiscated by the Ministry — were also in Draco’s trunks. Buying potions really was out of the question with his meager funds.
Draco thinks, even if it’s not the kind of thing he wants to say out loud. His heart gets too big and tight for his chest as images of the last few weeks flicker through his mind, in a kaleidoscope of colour. Harry pouring over Sirius Black’s diary, waking up in the morning and putting on his dad’s silver wedding band and Professor Lupin’s brown leather bracelet. The satchel he carries everywhere is battered and old, as if it spent more time than most holding Hogwarts textbooks. Harry carries his dead with him, wearing the reminders of them on his body. Like Little Compton Street’s perpetual sunset and sunrise, Harry is caught somewhere between the past and the future. His ambivalent present makes his future direction hazy and unclear, and even as he pushes resolutely forward, he will always be surrounded and shaped by the ghosts of his past, constantly being pulled back into another time with every twist of the ring on his finger.
Draco can’t quite believe the niggling guilt which suggests that maybe he shouldn’t go with the attractive stranger. Harry has a veritable buffet of choices and Draco doesn’t owe him any kind of misguided fidelity. Besides, if Draco has his own fun, at least his mind won’t be consumed with the jealousy that’s eating away at him.
In fucking, Harry is just as Draco imagined. He’s utterly committed to his task and he drives into Draco with restless passion and boundless energy. He makes all the right noises and slides against all the right spots, finding the angle that blows Draco’s mind. He leans over Draco as he fucks him, the puff of his breath hot on Draco’s skin and the scent of perspiration heavy in the air. He’s uncompromising, just as Draco asked him to be, thrusting into him with long hard strokes and taking Draco closer to the brink with every movement.
“The ring?” Harry holds his hand up and studies it, giving Draco an opportunity to admire it in the candlelight. He really does have excellent hands. “It was my dad’s wedding ring. I found it with Sirius’s diary when I was going through things at Grimmauld Place. I’m redecorating.” He touches his fingers to the leather band on his wrist. “This belonged to Remus. Professor Lupin,” he clarifies.
"Yes, sir." Draco gave a short nod and turned away to take care of the owls while Mr Willis left the owlery in a huff and walked across the small yard to the back entrance of the post office.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco puts some money on the table and stands, pulling on his coat. This time he’s going to leave first, and he’s going to find somewhere to go which is far away from Potter. “You think your godfather’s little club was just for people who deserve to feel safe being queer, don’t you? Good luck getting your invite and enjoy your precious little street full of
Growling pleasurably and deep in his throat, Draco withdrew his hand from under Harry's t-shirt. Harry heard the elastic slap of pants hurriedly shoved down, shortly followed by the frenetic strokes of Draco's hand on his own cock making soft sounds of friction on denim fabric.
Both grunted and the door had almost closed before Draco realized he needed to add more. “Don’t harm Weasley or Granger either.”
“It’s not your place to question my actions.” His tone was firm, and if Draco was anyone else, he might have fled, but he couldn’t.
Potter’s eyes were narrowed on the letter in Draco’s hand and he knew that it would raise questions—it always would when it came to Potter, the bloody nuisance.
“Wow,” Draco whispered, loud enough that several people heard him. To think that people that ignorant existed.
Why would Regulus suggest that the Dark Lord would come back? Or was Draco looking too deep into it? Was Regulus implying the war would have continued onward? It wasn’t as if Regulus could predict the future, perhaps things at the time seemed endless.
Draco shook his head. “I only heard the end of an order calling for silence. It was clear that I wasn’t supposed to have heard it.”
Time meant nothing when it came to the curse. What could have been only one second felt much longer and it skewed reality.
He blinked rapidly as a shame filled him. Draco wasn’t the person Dobby saw, wasn’t someone worth being praised, nor was he worth the adoration in large eyes that blinked up at him.
“The Potters were powerful,” Regulus said with a nod for emphasis. “It does not surprise me that he chose to take them out. But to target their son?”
to remind Harry of the first time they discovered a whole new world. In some ways, Draco thinks of that as the start. In others, today feels like the real beginning.
. We could do that.” Harry stretches out, palming his half-hard cock lightly. “We don’t know each other. You could just be waiting for me. I could be anyone.”
Harry seems to give that some consideration, picking thoughtfully at his beermat before answering. “If I was bothered by your last name I could have just left that coffee shop and not come back.”
Weasley snorted as he shook his head. “Right. I don’t know how you can be so wise one minute and then so stupid the next.”
He glanced to the Gryffindor table as he wondered how Potter was feeling. Would he be relieved that it was almost over? Nervous that whoever entered his name would make an appearance? Or was he finally enjoying the tasks?
“You should go,” Draco said as he reached forward to wipe Dobby’s eyes. “Before my father comes back.” It was always a possibility, but Draco doubted it. His father wasn’t one to continue after losing.
Pansy went on to explain that, since she and Luna had been dating, Luna had introduced her to a wonderful array of Muggle songs by all kinds of singers. How Luna had an incredibly diverse and intriguing taste in music. And admired the outfits the Muggle singers and female-presenting people featured on the album covers or in the video clips wore. And loved strong and uncompromising people who challenged society's norms. The way Luna's mother had always been; the way Luna was now.
on the doors don’t exactly attract the diverse club scene crowd. When he drinks in London he doesn’t really favour the cheesy pop of Village or G-A-Y anymore. Even though he’s not even thirty yet, he feels old and alone in those clubs. When he discovered the blissful pleasures of Muggle drugs, dancing on the vast floors of Heaven after the war was like a religious experience, the sweaty bodies, beating music and pounding hearts enhanced by the chemical du jour. Draco left that behind some time ago, and now he prefers a glass of something expensive in Claridges or The Savoy. It’s boring, clubbing alone.
When Draco pushed passed them and entered his dorm, he wasn’t surprised to see it occupied, nor was he surprised to see them reading the article too.
models. Sebastian and Seamus (the names Draco has given them on account of not remembering their actual ones) had been an unexpected find. It’s rare that Draco manages to find any wizards that don’t flinch when he tells them his name, and Diagon Alley doesn’t have any gay bars to help the process of meeting other wizards along. After coming out in a blaze of post-war defiance, with an array of young models and actors looking to get their pictures in the press, Draco largely gave up on finding anything meaningful in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. Pissing Skeeter off and scandalising the pearl-clutching society stalwarts his mother and father associated with was fun at first but being made to feel ashamed of perfectly natural inclinations took its toll after a while. Now he rarely tries to find people in wizarding spaces, unless he’s trying to make Harry Potter jealous, apparently.
repeat itself—something he had no control over. But perhaps Potter and Regulus were right, Draco could control his own choices—he just had to define them first.
“I got your letters,” Draco continued as he blinked rapidly trying to see through the wetness. “And I wanted to let you know that you have changed my
“—with a hero complex and a broomstick up his arse?” Greg clicks his fingers. “Oh! You also said he looked like a mountain troll.”
but thinks that now’s probably not the right time to point out either of those things, as Potter launches into another dramatic coughing fit.
His room didn’t hold much. A single bed was standing along one wall with a small bookshelf at its head. He’d engorged his favourite potions books and a few of his dragon sculptures when he’d moved in, and left most his other possessions shrunken down in one of the trunks at the end of the bed. Seeing those familiar items always gave him a sense of safety and home. The same could be said about his blue cauldron and his brewing utensils which were on the work table standing opposite the bed. A small sink with a cupboard above it was on the wall between bed and work table, and right next to the sink, a door led to the bathroom. Draco had tried to make the place as comfortable as possible, hanging up the posters he’d had in his dorm room at Hogwarts, on which famous Quidditch players zoomed around on their brooms or posed enticingly. A huge Slytherin banner was stuck to the wall next to the entrance. Above the banner, a tiny charmed window close to the ceiling gave the illusion of a view into rolling hills under a starry sky. In reality, the window just let you see the dirty facade of the houses opposite; not even a tiny bit of sky could be seen through it, no matter what angle you tried. So Draco had charmed the window as best as he could, and had tried to replicate the view out of his bedroom window at the Manor. On the floor of his basement room was a thick warm rug, also from his room at the Manor. He’d had this dark purple rug forever and loved curling up on it with a blanket, a cup of tea and a good book. He could read there for hours.
“But I can appeal to his heart. I can try and ease the pain, and I can be there for him through all of it.”
“We’ll see,” Draco says. He can’t bring himself to stay angry at Potter for long and the fury that welled up so quickly within him fades away. He suspects there’s an element of truth to Harry’s assumption in any event. “I suppose you want to go and find this lost street of yours now.”
When a demonstration of the curse was added to a spider, Draco felt his stomach knot. That wasn’t right. Theory of spells could be practical—there was no need for it to be
Draco shrugged once. “I don’t know. I would like to think he did. I would like to think that all bullies grow up at some point.”
Draco thinks he might have to take up diary keeping again. He makes a mental note of his first entry, because there’s something about this moment with the not-quite-setting-sun and the Muggle disco anthems pulsing around them that makes him want to immortalise it just like Black did.
Part of him could imagine the loneliness that Regulus faced. It had taken a lot of courage on Draco’s part to approach Neville. Even with Dobby’s friendship, life had been lonely—that coupled with not knowing what do when it came to his father created a disassociation with other students. They got to be young and carefree. None of them had to worry about their future in such stark terms, and he envied them, might even hate them.
As Potter and Granger tried to voice their own questions, it was the same disinterested snubs. Umbridge was far from unbiased and was taking the Ministry’s interest too far.
“If you aren’t his heart now, then you will be,” she continued, uncaring of his glare. “I’m just asking you to not hurt him.”
“We’ve been up all night, Potter. Obviously, I’m tired.” Draco could sink into the comfort of Harry’s sofa and fall asleep right here, with Harry working his fingers into Draco’s feet as if he’s just cast
“You must prove your loyalty, prove that my doubts of you are nothing but rumours. If you are as competent as your father claims, then prove it to me.”
“Perhaps.” Draco wets his lips and studies Greg, finally taking a decision. “I’ve actually been spending some time with Potter.”
“Maybe,” Potter began hesitantly. “Maybe you should trust your gut. That’s what I do when I don’t know what to do.”
Draco chatted on while rearranging a few things on his work table, making space for the bird with one hand before carefully setting it down and taking off his gloves.
“I couldn’t care less about your personal life. Besides, it’s not as though I’m not used to being called similar.” Draco can’t quite bring himself to apologise. “Don’t be a pillock. Finish your breakfast, I’ll leave you in peace.”
got the homosexual bit right, I really would recommend that book and I’d like to order some food because I’m hungrier than a Hippogriff on a Gamp’s Decidedly Dreary Diet.”
“That’s putting it politely.” Millicent rolls her eyes and has a drink of her pint. She looks across at Draco. “It’s alright. If Ginny here can give you a second chance, I’m sure I can.” She sticks out her hand, and Draco shakes it firmly. “I know you’re loaded though, so you can get the next round in. That would probably help too.”
“I thought I should have one picture, at least. I like this one. I don’t much like having pap shots on my mantlepiece.” Harry’s hand is warm and comforting on Draco’s side, his lips close to Draco’s cheek. “Thankfully, now I have a massive oil painting.” He sounds amused, his voice low and teasing.
“Now who has been spending too much time with Trelawney?” Draco drawled, smirking when Weasley laughed.
“Very fancy,” Draco observes. He goes through the cupboards until he finds the coffee, switching the machine on and leaning against the counter with his arms folded as he watches Harry. “Do you want one before you shower?”
“One of these days I’m going to run away. Somewhere tropical where I can surround myself in silence, and men—definitely men.”
sign casts peculiar shadows on his face, lifting his cheekbones and making his teeth glow strangely in the light as he opens his mouth and closes it again. Draco is acutely aware of how close they are; pressed into the small space behind the curtain. Harry’s breath is ragged and loud in the quiet box of a room. He reaches for Draco and clutches his arm as he struggles to control the jagged huffs of breath that hiss from between his lips.
The sound the door made as it slammed against the wall was almost as good as the way a few stragglers startled in surprise as Draco stormed into Severus’ last class of the day.
Paul takes a breath before continuing and Draco notices his hands are shaking, as he clasps them together. “For all we think we’re the bees’ knees with our magic and clever spells, our lot wouldn’t put time, money or resources towards any of it. We didn’t even get postscripts in the
“You think you’re the only one who has no clue what’s in store in life? I’m in a tournament against my will because someone wants me
“It’s one way to get people to change their mind,” Neville continued. “I can’t imagine there will be a single student who will have not read this by the end of the week.”
Draco stares at Harry. He takes in the firm set of his jaw, the crumpled, messy appearance and his shock of inky hair. He lets himself drink in the pulse of Harry’s magic and the way his spirit shines through in everything he does, even when those things include shouting at Draco and ruining his potential orgasms. Draco’s stomach flips and his heart beats soundly in his chest. There’s nobody here that compares to Harry. Everybody pales in comparison. It’s no wonder people gravitate towards him. Draco doesn’t want to push Harry away, but he’s terrified of this thing that wells within him. The hot curl of desire, the desperate
“As do mine.” It’s not exactly a lie. Pansy does work, so does Blaise, Theo and Greg. The fact they work in other countries and most haven’t made pains to contact Draco in ages is none of Potter’s business. Draco has friends in London. He just doesn’t choose to spend every waking minute with them. They’re really more acquaintances. Draco isn’t sure you can call someone a friend if your main interactions include a quick shag and not sticking around until the morning. “Why are you so bothered about my social life all of a sudden? It’s not like you give me any information about yours.”
Draco fell silent as the words left him. Talking to the dog had been therapeutic in a way. He was no longer afraid of the silence in his mind, and perhaps it was for the best to stop talking to animals that couldn’t talk back.
When the dog laid back down, head on Draco’s knee, he pretended that it was in support of his words.
“Okay. Bring it next week if you can. Same time, same place?” Potter has the audacity to wink. He stands and drops some money on the table. “This should cover my food and a tip.”
Draco wasn’t sure if he had ever noticed how quaint Hagrid’s cottage was before, or whether the Black Lake had ever shined so much. Small things changed next to Potter, and he wasn’t sure whether he liked it.
Before they left, Fred had looked back to give Draco a wink, and Draco hadn’t bothered to hide a smile. Weasleys were trouble, that much he had always known, but those two were a different kind of trouble—and Draco kind of liked that about them. Fred just needed to be knocked down a peg or two.
“Please do.” Draco pulls Harry out of the downpour, under his umbrella charm, and they laugh as their lips connect.
Despite their family relations, he knew his father would go after Umbridge. His position as the only heir would guarantee that.
“Hello, you! I’m sorry, I didn’t want to make you wait,” he said, trying to go for a cheerful and carefree tone. His little guest had quite enough troubles which needed to be taken care of first before Draco could think about wallowing in self-pity.
“Enjoying the peace and quiet. Or at least I was until I had to hear you try to charm anything with a pulse in that oafish way of yours.”
“One rule for one, one rule for the other, is it?” Potter’s clipped tone bellies his annoyance. “You know nothing about what I want, or what
“I’ve never heard his name.” Harry’s jaw is set, and his gaze fixed on the poster. “I worked on the honours list after the war, and I don’t remember seeing his name on that. If he was an activist, why wasn’t he awarded an Order of Merlin?”
He knew that Neville had been lonely before they became friends, and Draco was a little miffed that the rest of the Gryffindors hadn’t been close with Neville, but everything worked out in the end. What they didn’t see about him was their loss.
“Hi.” Harry slides his fingers out of Draco after another minute and moves up the bed. His hair is damp with perspiration, beads of it on his torso and his back. Draco answers him with a kiss, dirty, hot and open-mouthed, sliding his tongue into Harry’s mouth and tasting him.
Potter huffed, the sound not quite a laugh, but it wasn’t the derisive noise he thought it would be.
“You told me my path was set in stone, and you were right. People look at me and they see a complete picture. They see my etched lines that
?” He couldn’t fathom what would make Dumbledore think Severus would make a good Occlumency teacher—not just for Potter but for
Draco elbowed them both as Potter’s face turned an unattractive shade of red and he jerked out of their hold.
He picked up the book and wondered why it looked familiar. The pages were empty, and the cover was old, but it still felt as if Draco should recognize it.
“Go ahead,” whispered Draco. Parting from them didn’t seem as daunting after he had already voiced his thoughts. “Just, give them back to me? When you are ready?”
“If you ever leave me alone with her again, I will feed you to my plants, and I’m not kidding this time,” Neville warned, eyes serious but mouth twitching.
Draco rolls his eyes. How flattering to be an afterthought in Potter’s sexcapades. He can feel Harry watching him and he pointedly doesn’t look at him, speaking low enough for Potter to hear. “Do what you like, Potter. I’m sure I can find my own way home. I’m a big boy.”
Harry tongues at Draco and the intensity of the pleasure, the firm heat of Harry’s hands holding Draco open and the tender caress of his magic chases away any further thoughts of the past.
Draco glared at the ground before he schooled his features into a blank mask as he looked up at his father.
“There’s no protection charms,” Draco ticked off one finger. “You don’t have any vanishing spells guarding the base, where it’s the most noticeable tell of a Venomous Tentacula.” Another finger.
Draco stares after Potter’s disappearing form. Despite his scathing comments about Potter’s clothes, the jumper fits perfectly. The black wool is warm and soft in appearance, and the flash of yellow at the base of the jumper sits just on the top of Potter’s arse which is actually quite attractive in his light jeans.
Her eyes were still on Draco, and despite the urge to look away, he wouldn’t—not when he needed to say as much as he could silently.
“No, no,” Draco said as he shook his head. “That’s not true. You listened to Regulus and got out of the cave. You took the locket and tried to do as he said. That’s not failing, Kreacher.”
intently. His stomach lurched at the report. 10 convicted inmates escaped. He read over the names with a heavy heart until he came across one that had anger mounting.
“I do.” Draco wasn’t sure why he still felt so strongly about it, but with everything he had learned about Potter’s dreams, the lack of Occlumency shields, the Hall of Prophecies and then Kreacher’s behaviour—he was certain that Black had been there. He had to be.
“How did the press get the photos?” Draco waits impatiently for Potter to order some food before asking his next question. Having a Muggle hideaway makes perfect sense because the wizarding press doesn’t venture much beyond the magical parts of London. The fact the
Draco pushed the door open further, the action caused a small creak that drew the attention of the Weasley twins.
“There’s a certain intelligence to Lovegood that you don’t see often. She’s open to the belief of things that others lose faith in.”
“Didn’t realise you were so concerned with my erections, Malfoy. Spend a lot of time thinking about them, do you?”
“The Headmaster seems reluctant to offer any information. I wonder if you might know where Hagrid might be? Or what is causing his extended absence?”
Potter cocked his head to the side as he regarded Draco closely. “Do you know Occlumency? Is that why you are okay without the lesson?”
Draco looked to the ground as he fought the urge to shake his head. Of course. His use only mattered when he could provide something for his father.
As Granger’s face pinked up and she began muttering about making a point and not wanting to actually leave, Draco narrowed his eyes at Moody.
Noise drew his attention towards the walkway he’d come down. The sight of Dumbledore with the Minister had him wincing before he chose to enter the surrounding forest instead.
Drawing attention to the letters wouldn’t end well. Part of Draco wanted to hoard the knowledge and never let go, but he knew that one day it would be revealed. It had to. Severus deserved to hear about the latest letter—or any of them really.
Potter’s eyebrows rise. “I’m not cheating on anyone. I’m also not engaged anymore, not that it’s any of your business.”
“No, it’s not good. Not according to the BBC, anyway.” Draco closes his eyes for a minute. Harry smells like shampoo, soap and like everything Draco could possibly want. Even with Harry looking as good as he does, he fights back a yawn and wiggles his toes. He extracts his wand from his pocket and casts a lazy freshening charm in the direction of his feet.
Draco read the letter with trembling fingers, and he wondered if he could blame it on the vibrations of the Hogwarts Express. He stared out the window as his emotions warred with each other.
"They've become dangerous," he sighs, carding his hands through his tangle of curls. "They are operating outside the grid, not following any rules. Calling themselves the "light-bringers." I fear they are lowering themselves to the level of the Death Eaters." He flinches a little, casting a furtive glance at the mark marring my left arm. I shrug helplessly. It hurts but he's not wrong. He reaches out, fingers gently caressing the mark as I shudder beneath his touch, trying desperately not to pull away. I know it's his way of trying to sooth the burn. "I do my best to keep them in check, but I'm losing my grip."
“Harry… do you even remember what we were supposed to do today?” She asks sullenly, backing away from him, fresh tears falling down her cheeks in thick, perfectly round droplets. Harry’s heart sinks into his stomach as he tries desperately to remember just how terribly he has fucked up. He knows it’s not sex – Ginny’s ovulation has already passed. He can’t for the life of him think of anything else.
“I need to get out of here.” He croaks, wiping sweat from his brow. His eyes sweep the crowd again, but he can’t seem to find what he had seen just seconds before.
It’s not just being with Harry. It’s not just topping him for the first time. It’s doing it here, in Godric’s Hollow. This small, private, magical space that is in no way associated with Harry looking for a quick shag and a distraction from the job that isn’t working out exactly as planned. The cottage is so ineffably
All he had to do was look towards Malfoy to know that any child Lucius had would be condemned to a depressing fate. A fate with no choice, a fate filled with despair and one so lonely that it would crush the poor child.
“Yeah, well. It’s new to me too.” Harry has a long drink of his pint, before sitting back and looking at Draco as if he’s trying to see through to the very heart of him. “Do you think I’m ashamed of you because you’re a man?”
The more he learned about Regulus, the less it all made sense. Just who had been Regulus Black? And why had he sent a letter long after his death?
Draco’s brow furrowed sometime near the beginning of the letter and they never mellowed out. As he tried to understand it all, he worried his lip between his teeth.
,” Draco growled harsher than intended. “Don’t tell me that he cares. Don’t find a silver lining in this bullshit. Don’t preach about what you don’t know. Because he doesn’t care. He never has, and he never will.”
It hadn’t been long since their last kiss, but it was new in a sense that they were new, not new people, but new in the knowledge of what they had to do. Draco felt grounded as the kiss deepened and his emotions exploded.
“—Stop being wankers?” Draco interjects. He smiles serenely at Harry, who scowls at him. It’s not that Draco has suddenly become a great defender of Hermione Granger and her countless causes, but he does love an opportunity to have a dig at Potter.
“I don’t know,” Black admitted, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was upset over the question or the answer. “I would like to think that I would have been there for him.”
The crowds part and Harry makes his way towards the makeshift stage set up in the middle of Compton Common. The cameras flash and the hub-bub of noise drowns out the first few words of his speech, until he clears his throat and casts a
If there was one thing Lucius Malfoy wasn’t, that would be pleased. Draco wasn’t sure it was in his vocabulary.
“Like friends,” Draco offered as his mind went to Neville, Luna, and reluctantly Granger and Weasley, too.
“Your surprise is incredibly flattering.” Draco rolls his eyes. He puts Harry’s lube easily to hand and nudges Harry. “Hands and knees for this bit. You can turn over when you’re ready, so I can fuck you on your back.”
“Put your back into it Potter,” Draco says. He refuses to be embarrassed by the naked arousal in his voice and Harry doesn’t seem to mind in the slightest. With a murmur of Draco’s name, Harry slides his forefinger out and pushes his two middle fingers deep inside Draco. The heel of his palm is firm against Draco’s body, and he works his fingers in and out with a curling motion as he pulls back a little. His breath comes in shallow pants as he bites down lightly on Draco’s skin, finally fucking him with the force and pressure Draco wants. He hits all the right places, finally finding the part of Draco that makes everything get hotter, more urgent and desperate. With his legs shaking, Draco grips onto his cock and mutters a charm to leave his hand slick.
Draco contemplates Harry, thinking of some of their conversations since this all began. “Didn’t you say yourself that you lost a sense of purpose after the war? Maybe this is your new fight.”
Draco wasn’t too sure about that, but he could pretend. By the way Neville sighed, he didn’t think it was going over so well.
“They’re fine.” He sweeps his eyes over Greg, trying to gauge his reaction to his next revelation. “Anyway, I’m off the market.” It gives him something of a thrill to say it. He and Potter haven’t exactly had the
It hadn’t exactly gone that way. Draco had told him that he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do outside of Hogwarts. That seemed so far away, what with the war happening, and his family issues, a career seemed years away. But Severus had urged him to think on what he wanted to do, and not let other things stand in the way of his future, and his scores were good enough to give him a head start in a wide variety of jobs.
Draco ignored the incredulous look from Marcus’ face as he looked to Granger. “If you want to insult her, there is an immeasurable amount of material to do so. Her lack of humour is a start, or her inability to tell the difference between the effects of Aconite powder vs liquid.”
“Well I don’t exactly have any other leads, do I?” He says defensively, shivering against Draco’s withering look. “You know Annie’s been sick, with a-“
“Hi Arthur, I’m fine thanks. How about you?” He replies politely. Arthur wipes some sweat from his brow.
"Voldemort is planning to send scouts nearby tomorrow. He has an idea of where you and your friends are located, but thanks to me, doesn't know exactly where you are and is tired of coming up short. But the idea is to scare you off, have you retreat to Hogwarts. He has connections there that will allow him past the wards...and then he's coming for you, Potter. He will be there himself."
"It worked. They are all back at Hogwarts. They don’t understand entirely what is going on, but they trust me. The Aurors are with them...and we will be ready." I nod, taking in a deep breath.
Harry already knows that any research into Dresden himself is a dud. Since he was disowned by his family long ago, his name was actually changed and his existence erased from his family tree. So Harry resolves that maybe he should switch tactics and start just taking his picture around and asking if anyone recognizes him. It would be a long shot, but Harry feels he should exhaust all options. Once Dresden’s name is made public, he would be able to ask about him freely.
“So much better!” Ginny replies, “The potions you have been brewing for her have done wonders!” She exclaims. “I don’t know what would have happened if you hadn’t have invented these treatments when you did!”
On his way out of the hospital room, Harry runs into Narcissa Black Malfoy. Her soft lavender robes billow around her at the waist, pulled tight above it in a fetching manner. Her eyes are sparkly silver, the same as Draco’s, and Harry realizes just how much he looks like his mother. Everyone says he is a mirror image of his father but that’s not the case at all. They share the same angular features, hair and eye color, even the same mouth shape (that delicate bow and arrow that Harry just can’t forget). She tries to be regal as she thanks him, but there are tears in her eyes and her mirth is palpable. He tells her that it wasn’t a problem, and that he would have stopped at nothing to find Draco’s killer regardless. It’s the truth, after all. He is pulled into a surprised embrace, and it’s tighter than he thinks should be humanly possible, but somehow not uncomfortable.
“Even when he did those horrible things, I kept think- thinking of you…” His voice cracks at that statement, and for a moment he looks embarrassed at his admission.
They are laughing together about a very particular story, involving Draco forcing the house elves to play dress up with him and have a tea party (Hermione would not be amused), when she suddenly turns to him with seriousness in her familiar eyes. Soft, warm sunlight shines through the small open window and bounces off of her sleek, pale hair. She looks stunning and terrifying all at once. Harry swallows down his bit of bread and waits for her to speak to him. She reaches a regal, glove covered hand out to his arm and rests it on his bicep before giving a firm and gentle squeeze.
“You can thank Draco for that, he cooked everything for dinner today, from scratch.” He tells her, and Ginny nods in approval.
When it’s over, and Harry stands to follow his best friend out of the holding cell, Shacklebolt says his name in a low and treacherous tone. Harry turns stonily to look down at the man, eyes glaring absolute daggers at him, and waits for him to say whatever it is he has left to say.
“I was so scared to lose you! I still love you, Gin, you’re my best friend. I was too scared to admit that I was gay, and even worse, in love with a man that you and your family have a history with. I’ve never even said those words out loud to anyone before. I just didn’t want to lose my family. You guys are all I have.” He sobs openly, and for a minute the room is filled with only the sounds of their sniffling as they both blow their noses.
"I know all the signs, Potter... I've basically made a life here, in the muggle world, and I'm what muggles call a 'substance abuse counselor.' I've done it for years."  Malfoy is nervously tracing a tattoo on his left wrist, it's a muggle tattoo of a dragon, leaving the serpent's scar that Harry knows is there, completely unrecognizable. Harry recognizes the dragon from childhood, it's not a dragon from the Wizarding world, but a Chinese muggle dragon from fairy tales, long and deep red, wrapping almost all the way up Malfoy's arm.
The only thing that will put Harry’s mind at ease now is solving the case once and for all. So he decides to make that his main priority, despite the fact that he has exhausted all avenues of investigation and has no idea where to go from here. He knows he is probably too close to this, and he should just divulge all of his research to another Auror. But his gut is telling him that he is the one who needs to finish this. He trusts Draco so much, despite his strange behaviors and coping mechanisms, no matter how alarming they are. The part of him that is an Auror has made Draco a prime suspect, which pains Harry down to his very core. He vows to investigate and find out the truth, regardless of how painful that truth might be. The only thing Harry can think to do is to go back to the cottage where he and Ron found Draco. Aurors already investigated for evidence, but maybe there will be something that was missed, or at the very least, some source of inspiration.
other than waste your life away in this blasted old house,” Ginny waved her hands around, gesturing to the entirety of his home, “I am asking if
Harry pushed himself from the table, quickly standing straight as he took a hesitant step towards Malfoy. “No! No, that’s—that’s not it, Malfoy, I swear.”
Harry watched dumbfounded as Ginny scrambled from the loveseat towards the hearth, reaching for the Floo powder to call Hannah while the rest of them remained seated.
“That’s it, Harry,” Draco rasped, biting at Harry’s jaw as his other hand began to pull at Harry’s nipples.
“Oh...” Harry frowned, nursing his Firewhisky in the quiet of the room, the only sounds the crackling of the firewood and Gary’s purrs. Narrowing his eyes, Harry paused, thinking back to whenever Ron spoke of his raids as an Auror. Never once had he mentioned seeing Malfoy in the aftermath.
“What?” Teddy’s face fell, eyes beginning to glimmer with tears, slowly shifting from brown to a stormy grey. “But, why?”
Draco turned away, striding to the armchair closest to the hearth. Gracefully, he sat, sprawling across it. He threw one leg over the arm of the chair, legs spread wide as he took a leisurely sip from his drink. Harry’s gaze was drawn to him—to the
Harry turned his attention towards the back of the cottage, soft voices drifting in from the gardens. His lips began to curl and he bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from grinning too much before making his way outside.
“Oh, no. I think it’s time for bed,” Harry chuckled, standing up from where he was sprawled on the ground.
“Hello,” she slowly closed the book she had been reading and set it on the end table beside her before resting her hands in her lap. “You’re here early today. Lunch hasn’t been served yet.”
As soon as Andromeda was out of sight, Teddy spun and looked excitedly up at Harry. “Can we go now? I want to see Gary!”
Harry could feel the blood draining from his face. His hand shook as he reached for his bedside table, needing something to hold himself up with.
Harry could hear Jesse’s deep voice begin to question Draco as they walked away, but he ignored it, focusing instead on putting enough distance between them.
Jesse stood next to Ginny, grinning brightly and laughing at something that she said, her cheeks flushed in the afternoon heat. The man looked happy—ecstatic—and Harry could not help but grind his teeth, nails digging into his palms as his fists clenched tightly at his sides.
“I’m not a bloody horse, Tedward, don’t kick! I’m going.” Draco huffed, turning and striding out of the kitchen as Teddy cackled.
“Oh God, Gin, really?” Harry rolled his eyes and Ginny laughed loudly, pushing herself up from where she sat. She kissed the top of his head before making her way towards the entryway to the kitchen.
Malfoy huffed, his pale brows raising and disappearing behind the tousled strands of hair that fell across his face. “My job, Potter. My career, occupation, profession,
“Not that it should be any concern of yours,” Malfoy huffed, turning back to the sink and the task in front of him, “but I was spending the morning with my aunt and cousin, as I do every Saturday.”
“What?” Harry turned slightly towards George, narrowing his eyes. That smirk never meant anything good.
“Well then, we will see you tomorrow, Andy.” Harry addressed Andromeda, hesitating to move his gaze from Malfoy’s stiff back.
“But Harry...Uncle Ron says that you watched Draco all the time back at Hogwarts,” Teddy said, wide eyes gazing at Harry with feigned innocence. Harry had no idea what his godson was playing at, but he didn’t like it.
“Maybe she thought Teddy should get to know some of his family?” Ron interjected with a shrug as he sat back down.
“Oh, that’s wonderful, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, clapping her hands in front of her and startling Gary from where he was curled in her lap.
Slowly, his fingers dropped lower, brushing over his hardening cock. He dipped one finger beneath his foreskin before tugging it towards the base of his cock, indulging in a leisurely wank. His breath shuddered and Harry groaned, letting his mind drift as he reveled in the pleasure building at the base of his spine.
” he exclaimed, rolling off of the bed and tripping out of the room. “I’m going to get dressed! Hurry up, we need to go!”
“Why’d he want a Kneazle so badly?” Ron asked. “Teddy hasn’t ever seemed like he wanted a pet. Loves creatures, sure, but a pet?”
“So, this is the creature you gifted my grandson with?” Andromeda questioned, eyeing the Kneazle suspiciously.
“Yes,” He nodded once, crossing his arms over his chest. “And he is going to call me Harry. That’s what Teddy calls us, and we want to make sure that Teddy knows he doesn’t need to worry us about fighting. This makes sense.”
A halo of light reflected on the crown of Teddy’s platinum blond curls. His cheeks were flushed, bright green eyes wet with the last of his tears, one dimple pulling at the corner of his mouth as he smiled shakily at Draco.
He would meander throughout London, stopping in cafés and various stores, exploring gardens, thinking about how much Draco would enjoy this or that, how nice it would be to have the man at his side.
Harry bit at his lips, trying to stop himself from teasing Malfoy for his flushed face, when his eyes caught on a streak of flour across Malfoy’s left cheekbone. It was a thick, white line, standing out starkly against the blush spreading across Malfoy’s sharp features.
He was beginning to think that he would not be content with any career. Everything felt like a chore, or a favor that he was fulfilling for his friends, or something that he was expected to do as
“I love you, too, Tedward. Always.” Malfoy placed a soft kiss atop Teddy’s head before standing once more. His fingers graced the boy’s shoulder as he turned, his gaze catching Harry’s.
Malfoy caught Harry’s curious gaze, shrugging elegantly as he took the plate of toasties in hand, nodding to the pot with a smug smirk. “Tomato and basil soup. One of my specialties. Tedward thought that it would go well with the toasties. If you would, Potter?”
Draco and Teddy sat in the middle of the room, the muggle board game set up between them, colorful pieces already placed into position as Teddy explained the rules of the game to Draco.
“Teddy, why don’t you go gather your things? I will be off momentarily, and then you and Harry can go to Grimmauld Place. I am sure that dear Kreacher will have prepared a wonderful luncheon for your return.”
Draco’s words staked him in place. Harry felt frozen in fear, unable to breathe. Harry thought his entire body might burst into flames, hot hope licking over his skin.
Harry began to walk towards his family, gravel crunching loudly under his feet. Teddy turned quickly at the noise, a bright smile spreading across his face once he saw Harry.
Draco’s gaze flickered to the mugs, and he raised a brow at Harry. Harry shrugged sheepishly, cradling his mug between his hands and lifting it to his lips. Draco huffed a soft laugh before turning back to the story, his soothing voice bringing to life the adventures of
Harry threw an annoyed glance at Ginny, who only grinned sharply back at him. “Er...a plant might have...burst, at Neville’s shop the other day. He didn’t really need me around anyhow, and...well, I’d really rather not be covered in plant saliva.”
“But you said you would stay until we went to Harry’s,” Teddy’s high voice whined, echoing down the hall.
Harry groaned, running his hands through his hair as he glared down at the sticky bar table, before leaning back in the booth and looking at his friends. Ron and Hermione sat across from them, each nursing their own pint. George was sprawled next to him, one arm resting across the booth behind them while a smirk tugged at his lips.
The room was quiet for a few minutes, filled with only the sounds of Teddy’s sniffles and hiccups, and Harry’s voice humming a made-up lullaby.
“You fell, Harry!” Teddy cried, gazing up at Harry with glistening grey eyes, tears beginning to roll down his flushed cheeks. He rubbed his face against Harry’s thigh before turning it to the side and reaching a trembling hand out to Draco, fingers grasping at the open air. “Draco—” Teddy choked on a sob “—you
was altogether unexpected. Brilliant, surely, and a testament to the skill that he inherited from Tonks, but a shock nevertheless.
“Harry!” A loud squeal echoed throughout the kitchen as Teddy ran into the room. Harry laughed, forgetting his discomfort of only moments before, as he knelt down to pick up his godson.
The three of them stood silently in the ward as the door closed behind Maggie. As subtly as he could, Harry cleared his throat, “Well...should we go, then?”
“Of course,” Harry confirmed, giving a gentle nudge to Teddy’s shoulder before the boy ran out of the room.
“Master Harry called?” Kreacher’s hoarse voice grated against Harry’s nerves, and he grimaced before opening one eye to look at the decrepit elf at the edge of his bed.
Harry blinked slowly, watching as the early morning sunlight reflected off of Draco’s platinum hair. He coughed, “Er...so, he’s good?”
“Of course you’re not,” Draco said, his voice low, hooded eyes looking down at Harry’s body. Molten silver irises slowly began to make their way back up Harry’s form, lingering for a few moments, before they met Harry’s gaze.
, suddenly, he felt this need to approach Malfoy—not in opposition, as he always had before, but with something else.
“Yes!” Teddy squealed, hugging the Kneazle so tightly that it squeaked. “Did you hear that, Gary? You’re coming home!”
A hard length, firm and larger than you ever would have imagined, pressing against your hip. Cool fingers, pulling at your shirt, lingering on your stomach and dipping below your trousers.
Just as Harry lifted his tea and took a large gulp, Andromeda delicately cleared her throat, gazing at him over the lip of her own cup.
Ginny stared at Harry over the rim of her wine glass as she took a deep sip, one delicate auburn brow raised in question. She sat in the corner of his loveseat in the sitting room at Grimmauld, feet curled beneath her, the fire of the hearth reflecting brilliantly from her red hair.
tell Molly Weasley that. You’re right fit, honestly. You’re a bloody Healer, for Merlin’s sake, and you’re good at it.” Harry’s voice softened, his smile shy and genuine, nervous as he whispered vulnerably. “...You’re brilliant with Teddy.”
“And?” Draco questioned, humming as he observed the results of the diagnostic charms. He pulled his fingers from Teddy’s curls, brushing them gently against Teddy’s cheek, before shifting so that his wand hovered over Teddy’s injured leg. His wand hand began a slow, complicated movement—some healing charm that Harry surely did not understand.
. What in Merlin’s name could he be doing? Instincts or not, it’s not as if he has the means to coordinate any sort of intervention.”
“No. Malfoy spends Saturday mornings with Teddy. That’s the deal, right? What could possibly be more important than spending time with your cousin, Malfoy?” Harry spat, taking a step closer to Malfoy, tilting his head up to glare at him, standing so close that he could feel Mafloy’s breath against his face. “So what’s your excuse, huh, Malfoy? What was
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, pushing herself from where she had leaned against the side of the Burrow. “Teddy has the genes of a were, whether or not he himself is a werewolf.”
Harry cringed. He knew that his face must be flushed—if not from the heat of his cheeks, than by the amused twinkle in Andromeda’s eyes.
Harry hummed, settling himself between Draco’s spread thighs and wrapping a hand around the base of Draco’s cock. Lazily, he leaned forward, raising his eyes to meet Draco’s heatedly as he wrapped his lips around the head.
“Of course. Why am I not surprised that Ronald will be late?” Draco drawled as Ginny let out a loud bark of laughter.
Teddy sucked on his bottom lip, shifting from one foot to the other. “But...do you think he will be mad at me?”
“Yes!” Teddy exclaimed with one last push, surprisingly forceful as Harry tripped into Malfoy’s chest. Malfoy’s hands reached out to stabilize him, before Harry quickly pulled himself back. “Draco is a
Malfoy shrugged apologetically at Teddy, “If you want to have any sort of command over others later in life, Tedward, you must have the skills to present a provocative argument. Unfortunately, you failed at that today. Confidence and determination only go so far.”
“Er...” Harry stuttered, glancing between his two friends, who acted as if nothing had happened—as if Harry had not just lost himself in thought—staring up at him curiously. He nodded, “Yes. Yes, she’s planning on starting me in the kitchen right away.”
Draco was silent, a deep flush spreading across his pale cheeks. The freckles across the bridge of his nose stood out and he looked to the side, nose wrinkling as if debating what to say.
The library was quiet but for their shallow breaths as they stared at each other. After a few moments, Malfoy’s gaze shifted, hovering just beyond Harry’s shoulder.
“Er...” Harry coughed, refusing to meet Malfoy’s gaze, instead turning to stare in astonishment at his godson. “Yes, I’m sure he is, Teddy...but that still doesn’t explain
Harry glanced back at Malfoy, watching his lips part as he grinned, teeth glinting in the bright room, his eyes crinkling with mirth as he watched Teddy play. The sun reflected from his platinum hair, enveloping him in a warm glow. It was disconcerting, how relaxed and content Malfoy appeared, talking softly to Teddy as Gary bounced around.
who was up to something. And yet here you are. You go from hating me one moment to—what?—asking after my career?”
Harry coughed, his eyes widening slightly at her clear dismissal. “Er...I’m not—that is, I didn’t just come to—well certainly
started!? You’re the one who is intruding in his life, Malfoy, when you shouldn’t be there at all! What are you doing, hm? Teaching him
The door to Teddy’s room was ajar, light spilling into the hallway. Harry approached it slowly, listening to the soothing voice that came from within. He paused, leaning against the frame, crossing his arms over his chest, eyes focused on the scene before him.
“Of course I do!” Teddy exclaimed, wide eyes beginning to glimmer with tears again. “Let’s go! Let’s go find Gary!”
“So?” He could hear George and Teddy’s voices in the distance as they continued their game. All three of his friends were watching him carefully—it was unnerving. He hesitated before lifting his shoulders dismissively. “He’s cute as a blond...it suits his complexion.”
to what the customer wanted. The comfort that he had experienced in the kitchen at Andromeda’s cottage with Teddy and Malfoy, or when he helped Molly at The Burrow, had been completely absent at The Three Broomsticks.
Hermione hummed, lifting the tumbler to her lips and taking a delicate sip before setting it back on the side table.
“Nothing, Mr. Potter, sir. I will leave you to it,” Maggie winked. She rested a hand briefly on Teddy’s shoulder, squeezing, before turning swiftly and leaving the room.
Kneeling down beside them was a wizard, dressed in a tight t-shirt with a crossed wand and bone embroidered on the breast and tucked into dark jeans. Chestnut brown hair shone in the morning light and as Harry met the man’s concerned eyes, he felt as if he had been suddenly doused with a cauldron of ice water.
“Of course he’s not too young. Bill and Charlie taught me when I was three,” Ron shrugged, smiling crookedly towards his girlfriend.
“Oh, no! I just meant—” Harry spluttered, eyes widening as he realized what he had asked, and what it could imply. Not that he didn’t want that—bloody hell, and he
For a few moments, no one spoke. The only sounds in the room were Teddy’s heavy footsteps overhead, and their soft breaths.
Draco would teach Teddy how to fly—which surely meant that Teddy had exaggerated his injuries the day prior. “Damnit, Draco!”
As Harry placed the final dish to his side to dry, he wiped his hands against his jeans, not bothering with a drying charm. He turned, gazing around the room—quiet and empty.
They landed firmly on the green grass of the Harpies’ Quidditch Pitch. Almost instantly, Teddy screamed in excitement, waving frantically as Ginny and Angelina flew past them and rushing towards the center of the Quidditch pitch, where a crowd was beginning to gather
Teddy wriggled out of Harry’s arms as Malfoy turned around, running over and wrapping his arms around one slender leg. A fond smile pulled at Malfoy's lips, and Harry was momentarily stunned, before pale fingers ran through Teddy’s tussled turquoise hair. “Goodbye, Tedward. I will see you on Tuesday.”
“Did I?” Ginny asked dismissively, not bothering to look at her brother, instead continuing to watch Harry.
Harry laughed, kneeling down and wrapping his arms around Teddy as he collided with him. “Yes, well I didn’t have anything else to do this morning, so why not spend extra time with my favorite godson?”
“Look at you!” Harry called out, a wide grin splitting his lips as he walked towards the two. Both of their heads snapped quickly towards him, though while Teddy yelled in excitement, Draco’s cheeks colored slightly as he pursed his lips together.
Harry swore under his breath, swinging his legs over his broom and shooting into the air, making his way towards where the children were beginning to fly basic drills around the pitch.
Harry rolled his eyes, having already figured that. “Yes, of course. And what are you betting, Gin?”
Draco tilted his head, silky blond hair falling across his forehead. He blinked slowly and tucked the strands behind one ear.
Of course, Harry had started arriving earlier than expected, and today would be no different. Harry had every intention of arriving well before lunch, to allow him more time to investigate what Malfoy’s motivation actually was.
Teddy readily agreed, lifting Gary so that the creature could perch on his shoulders, before skipping after the man.
“He‘ll be back this weekend, Gary. It’s just you and me, now.” Harry sighed, running a hand over the Kneazle’s small head as he made his way out of the room and up to bed.
Harry grimaced. He hadn’t looked, not really. Teddy had been screaming, so desperate with his pain that Harry had not thought to question it. “Er...well, I tried.”
“Yes, Draco. I have,” she confirmed, eyes settling on Malfoy for a moment before flickering towards Harry. “And I trust that Teddy’s waltz lessons have been going well?”
“Oh...well,” Harry bit the inside of his cheeks, feeling his face flush, “Er...what were you going to ask?”
Letting out a soft sigh, Harry walked towards the sitting room, looking inside to see Andromeda sitting in a plush armchair in front of the hearth, a worn book propped in her lap as she stared at him, amber eyes sparkling.
Draco paused—and whether it was because of the desperation in Harry’s voice or the fact that Harry was literally holding him back, Harry did not care.
“Alright, Tedward,” Malfoy murmured. He rested his hands gently on Teddy’s arms, eyes focused on the enthusiastic boy. “Are you ready?”
They walked towards the sitting room in comfortable silence. Harry strode to the hearth, reaching for the Floo powder and presenting it to Draco.
Malfoy blinked, and with a shiver his body finally relaxed. The tension left his shoulders, and his head rolled back, neck presenting itself subtly as a smirk pulled at his lips. “Oh, are you?” he sneered, narrowing his eyes before he began to push forward, forcing Harry away from him. “You’re not going to find out
You huff a choked laugh, tears wetting your eyes as you frantically look around the darkened room. “You’re not, Potter. I don’t need—I don’t
Harry furrowed his brows, biting his lower lip as he stared down at the buttered bread he had torn apart. When it had only been Teddy and Andromeda who seemed immune to Malfoy’s schemes, everything made sense. It had to have been
“Er...” Harry shot an icy glare at George, who only snickered as he walked towards the Pygmy Puff display to return the ball of fluff. There was no way he could get out of this now, he realized, so with a sigh he nodded, resigned to his fate. “Yes. I thought you might like to look at the...er, the Kneazles.”
“Er...” Harry cleared his throat. There, upon Malfoy’s cheekbones, leading into his platinum blonde hair, was a light flush. The rosy hue was painted against delicate cheekbones, against the bridge of a pointed nose and the tips of pale ears.
Teddy stood stiffly at the threshold of the room, amber eyes bright as he stared at them. Slowly, he turned to focus on Draco.
“Oh, er... He can’t control it well yet. But he’s been practicing,” Harry coughed lightly, shifting on his feet. He didn’t meet George’s eyes, instead keeping watch over Teddy as he lifted a Pygmy Puff into the air and sat it on his head. The Pygmy Puff was white, fur shining brightly in the morning sunlight. It made Harry remember when Teddy morphed the previous day, platinum blond hair glimmering as he defended his cousin. “I think a lot of it is still unintentional.”
Draco smirked as they stared at one another. His eyes sparkled with amusement, “It’s about time that you realized I was better than you, Potter.”
“Will we see you at the Quidditch Camp on Saturday?” Harry asked quietly as Draco took a handful of Floo powder.
“Well, look at that!” The shop owner grinned crookedly. “He likes you. Looks like you’ve got yourself a familiar!”
“Alright, Tedward. Are you ready?” Draco asked slowly, his voice soft. It was deep, smooth as honey, a comforting blanket wrapped around them all.
Harry had never seen Malfoy like this, quite so relaxed. He looked as if he was no longer playing a role, no longer trying to appease anyone else—simply enjoying himself. The light from the windows created a halo around Malfoy, and he
Teddy turned to look at Harry as he finished his meal, smiling happily up at him, silver eyes alive and sparkling with pleasure.
“You brought him here—” Draco paused, his voice soft, almost vulnerable. “You brought him to me, because he asked?”
“D’you promise you’ll stay?” Teddy rubbed his face against Draco’s chest, his breathing beginning to slow. “Want you to be here in the morning...”
Snickering, Harry picked up the remainder of his toasty and unceremoniously dunked it in his soup, lifting it to his mouth and taking a large bite. As he chewed, he glanced to his side and caught Andromeda’s cool gaze.
Andromeda hummed, narrowing her eyes for a moment before pulling away as Teddy clambered down the stairs. “Alright. Floo me if you need anything, then.”
Two months ago, Andromeda made the decision to move to France to be with Narcissa and foster their rekindled relationship, now that she knew that Teddy would be well taken care of with Harry at Grimmauld Place. After transferring custody of Teddy to Harry, Andromeda sold her cottage, returning to England to stay in the guest suites at Grimmauld when she visited Teddy once every week or two.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle as he looked down at his godson, so adamant in his argument as he stomped his foot against the floor. Despite how progressive Andromeda seemed to be, she still had pureblood tendencies—obviously encouraged by Malfoy, in this instance, as they tried to instill the importance of a proper waltz in Teddy.
“Well, I do not know, dear. It is only that I never quite know what you are working on,” Andromeda’s eyebrows rose slightly in astonishment, “Perhaps you got caught up in that glass blowing studio you experimented with the other month, and forgot the time as you have done before.”
“Er...” Harry blinked dumbly. Of all of the stupid, provocative things he had spoken in an effort to rile Malfoy up, this was
Why would he, after all? There is not reason for him to return. Not when he could find so much better than you.
“Well, where is he?” he demanded. Teddy began to squirm uncomfortably in Harry’s arms, and he slowly knelt to let him down. His godson hesitated, wringing his hands together and looking between Harry and his grandmother, as they stared at one another.
Hermione was determinedly avoiding his eyes as she settled on the loveseat. She smiled down at Gary, waving her fingers in front of him as he rolled onto his back, small paws batting at the digits.
Maybe Draco wouldn’t want him, Harry thought as he looked at his empty home. Grimmauld was not as dark as it had once been—Harry had made sure of that, remodeling what he could. But someone with Draco’s tastes surely would not be swayed by
“I’m joking!” he wasn’t, not really. But Harry was still certain that Draco would be welcome at the Burrow. And more than that, he
The children continued flying, Teddy included, preoccupied with the Quidditch Camp, while Harry stared at the border of the pitch.
Harry paused, thinking back to the camp— watching Jesse from across the pitch, arms resting tenderly on Ginny’s arm, and Ginny gazing up at him with sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks. He had thought they were flirting...and they
A soft purr began to vibrate around him, and Harry’s eyes snapped open to look directly into feline eyes staring back at him. Teddy had stepped forward, clutching the Kneazle to his chest and standing directly in front of Harry, bright eyes fixed on Harry’s own.
“Shh, it’s okay,” Harry whispered, walking towards the bed in the center of the room and laying Teddy down upon it. Teddy sniffled, turning his head into the pillow beneath him, tears beginning to crust on his cheeks.
Malfoy merely gazed back, cool grey eyes firm as they watched Harry, proud yet resigned. His shoulders were stiff, as if he were preparing for a blow.
The three of them began playing, laughing at each other’s antics and competitive natures. Teddy nearly screamed ‘
“Oh, Tedward,” Draco pursed his lips, the corners tugging in an attempt at a smile. He lifted one hand to brush Teddy’s chestnut brown curls from his forehead. “It’s alright. I’ll have you healed up before you know it. Don’t you worry.”
“Harry!” Teddy scrambled up from the ground, stumbling towards Harry in his excitement. “You’re here so early!”
“Of sorts...?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest, raising one eyebrow as he stared directly at Draco.
The sudden iciness of Andromeda’s glare struck Harry, reminding him of the sisters she had distanced herself from. He had never felt that Andromeda was dangerous, but in that moment he knew that she could be just as much of a threat as any of the Black ancestors.
Harry smiled serenely, relaxing against the door frame, and charming two of the mugs to set themselves on the bedside table.
Teddy giggled, grinning up at his cousin, gap-toothed smile wide in his happiness, before he finally caught sight of Harry standing in the entryway.
Draco gracefully began to remove his robes, revealing a simple white shirt tucked neatly into dark trousers. Harry’s gaze wandered over Draco as the man looked around the sitting room. These clothes suited Draco much more.
Harry groaned, arching against Draco at one particularly long thrust, cocks dragging against each other. He couldn’t think beyond the pleasure coursing through his body, beyond the heat of Draco caging him in. He whined, “
Harry leaned forward, pulling Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth and suckling at it before he sat back. “Mmm...probably. But you should, too.”
When Draco pulled his hand away, his fingers dragged against Harry’s arm. Harry inhaled deeply and lifted his gaze to Draco’s, whispering a hoarse, “Thanks.”
“Well…” Ron frowned, shrugging on shoulder, “I mean, I did the other week. But honestly, mate, it just didn’t seem like that big of a deal. He did his job, is all. And I was doing mine. It just felt like we were beyond our schoolboy rivalries after everything, you know?”
“Harry!” Teddy called out as he and George reached him, an excited grin splitting his godson’s lips. “Did you see me? I flew, and I caught George,
“It’s just that you have had this obsession with him before. And other than helping Neville with his shop, there’s not much to distract you right now,” she explained carefully.
Teddy squealed excitedly, wriggling down from Draco’s shoulders until his feet were firmly on the ground beneath him. He thrust his training broom at Harry before reaching out to them both. One small hand grasped Draco’s, the other clasping Harry’s. He smiled brightly as he looked between them.
“I would have warned you if you hadn’t bitten me,” he taunted, knocking twice on the front door before pushing it open.
Harry tilted his head forward, an affirmative answer to Draco’s unasked question, and Draco’s shoulders immediately released the tension that they held. He sent a shy smile towards Harry—genuine—before turning to look back at Teddy, “I will come as soon as I am finished here, Tedward. I promise.”
Draco exhaled slowly, pressing a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead before standing up. “I will see you soon, Tedward.” He glanced quickly at Harry, head tilting in a question. “If your godfather allows it, perhaps I will visit you while you reside with him this week.”
Harry hummed as he looked around the garden, gaze settling on the lemon tree beside his kitchen window, its leaves vibrant in the sunlight, fruit heavy on its branches.
“I think that is a brilliant idea, Harry,” she stated, “After all, it is so important for children to have a positive and loving familial unit. You and Mal—Draco, rather, being friendly with one another will certainly help facilitate that.”
The kitchen was silent as Harry swallowed his latest morsel. Hesitantly, he raised his eyes to his friends. Ron and Hermione were staring at him, looking equally shocked and exasperated. Luna calmly observed him, head tilted slightly.
It had been the shortest he had lasted in any job thus far, but Harry did not regret leaving. He smelled heavily of coffee, his chest still stung from where the burning coffee had splashed against him, and it was only 10:30 am yet he had been awake since 3:00 that morning.
“I suppose I will be green,” Draco said, reaching for the tiny pawns and placing them on the board game.
“I mean...it really is quite cute,” Harry paused, considering for a moment before smiling softly. “You know, I bet he’d look adorable when he morphs like that but with green eyes.”
“I don’t know what you are talking about, Potter,” Malfoy sneered. Harry took another step forward, pleased as Malfoy took a faltering step back. He continued his advance until he had Malfoy backed up against the nearest bookshelf.
it mean?” Ron questioned, widening his eyes as he blearily gazed between his sister and best friend.
be the career for him, he thought. After all, he had enjoyed making lunch with Teddy and Malfoy the other day.
Of course Malfoy would take his involvement in Teddy’s life lightly, Harry thought, as he began to imagine all of the excuses the prat must have given Andy. Didn’t feel like leaving the luxury of the Manor this morning, perhaps, for Andromeda’s quaint cottage. Had to go to Gringotts to count his galleons and make sure he was still a rich prat. Was too fucked out from another evening with Lord What’s-His-Name from the gala the night before.
“A homeostasis charm. It is used to prolong the effects of any potions used for healing, which in turn amplifies the intended benefits,” Malfoy stated, gaze flickering briefly to look at Harry before he turned back to Teddy.
Harry licked his lips nervously, blinking as he swallowed, trying to think of something to say, when suddenly a delicate cough sounded from across the room.
Malfoy moved so elegantly it looked as if he were dancing on clouds, Teddy giggling along for the ride as they swayed to the music. The two paid no attention to Harry as they focused on their choreography, gliding across the floor completely in tune with the melodious song resonating throughout the room.
The welcomewitch squeaked behind them, and when Harry spared a glance her way he could see her smiling, hands resting clasped against her chest, watching the three of them with a soft look in her eyes.
“Hey!” Harry cried, grinning as he petulantly slapped at Draco’s bare chest. They laughed, shoving at each other, before Harry placed his hands on either side of Draco’s sharp face and pulled him forward, kissing him soundly. They slowed, Draco’s hands wrapping around Harry and tugging him closer as their tongues intertwined, hips rolling against one another.
“Er...right,” Harry mumbled, frowning quizzically as he looked between the two. He was not sure if he should be relieved that they seemed to get on alright, or terrified.
Harry quickly bit his lip, holding his breath in an effort to keep from bursting with laughter at the image of his godson, innocently placing the wooden spoon back into the counter.
Within moments, Andromeda joined them, gliding into the kitchen gracefully as if she were entering a ballroom. She helped them retrieve the hors d'oeuvres from their stasis charms, placing them in the center of the table.
“No, ‘Mione, don’t,” Ron hushed, eyes flickering between Ginny and Harry as if watching the climax of a seeker’s match. He whispered speculatively, “Let’s just see what happens...”
“Oh,” he whispered. His voice sounded hoarse—slow—as if he were dragging himself through molasses. He swallowed thickly, found himself taking a halting step towards the other man. “Well...I suppose, then, if—”
Harry threw one last glare in George’s direction as Teddy hastily tugged him down Diagon Alley toward Magical Menagerie.
Teddy whined from where he lay, limbs spread-eagled across the floor, looking up pitifully at Harry. “But I don’t
“Alright, Teddy. Why is the waltz so important for wizards to know?” he asked, smiling as he indulged his godson.
They were silent for a few moments. It wasn’t awkward though—rather, it was like a balm, comforting at the end of a long day. Harry cleared his throat.
“I know I did, Tedward,” Draco said. His voice was low, soft and apologetic. Harry turned the corner to see Draco kneeling in front of Teddy, one hand resting on the boy’s shoulder, the other smoothing down Teddy’s tangled, curly, turquoise strands. Teddy looked up at him desperately with wet green eyes. “But I am training in the A&E, and I cannot ignore St. Mungo’s when they call me in. Someone is hurt; I have to go and help them. You know that, don’t you?”
“Ah, yes,” Draco snorted, turning his head to look away. “When you were attempting to catch me in the midst of being
Rolling his eyes, Harry shot an unimpressed look at his best friend. Ron shrugged apologetically while Hermione pursed her lips, a worry line lingering between her brows.
Draco exhaled shakily, warm breath ghosting over Harry’s face, and Harry raised his gaze. Their eyes met, sharp and heated, and they both stilled.
,” Draco whispered against his lips, breath warm and intimate as it caressed Harry’s skin. “You bloody git...of course it’s not. How are you
“Er...sure,” Harry nodded, glancing down the hall to where the drawing room was as he allowed himself to be led into the sitting room.
“It was okay, though!” Harry insisted, raising his hands defensively. “I brought him to St. Mungo’s and Draco sorted him out. It wasn’t anything serious—only bruises!”
They returned to the sitting room, embers in the hearth blazing softly and casting a warm light across the room, as Draco poured both of them a couple fingers of Firewhisky. He turned, one glass in his hand, stretched out in offering to Harry.
“He...Draco isn’t here, Teddy,” Harry spoke slowly, gently, trying to soothe the boy. “But it’s okay. I’ve got you, Teddy. I’ve got you.”
Teddy stood atop a wooden stool so that he could see the contents sizzling on the hob, a wooden spatula clutched in his hand, while Malfoy stood next to him, one pale hand gently resting against Teddy’s back, stabilizing him as the boy swayed with his exuberant gestures.
“That’s better. Now, Draco—” Teddy tugged lightly on Malfoy’s hand “—you have to accept Harry’s apology. That’s how this works, right Nana?” He turned inquiring eyes up to Andromeda, standing next to Harry with a soft smile curling at her lips.
Ron choked on his Firewhisky, coughing hoarsely as he cleared his throat. He looked over at Harry, waving a hand in front of him as his eyes teared, “Sorry, sorry. Went down the wrong way, mate. Go on.”
Teddy took a shuddering breath, lips wobbling with his sobs. He opened his eyes and focused quickly on Malfoy. Letting out a pitiful gasp, Teddy stumbled towards his cousin
“Draco is my cousin, of course,” Luna smiled lazily at Harry, head tilting slowly as she watched him. “We often spend time together. Why wouldn’t I know what is important to him?”
Harry watched as Teddy wandered off before turning around to ask Andromeda if he could help prepare lunch. Before he could, he stopped in place at the strength of Andromeda’s glare, brows furrowed in frustration and fists clenched on her hips.
Teddy parted his lips, preparing to speak, but before he could Gary let out an alarmed hiss. The Kneazle scrambled away, claws drawn, in an attempt to escape from the shocking morph. In his determination to withdraw from Teddy’s reptilian appearance, Gary’s claws swiped at Teddy’s face, four deep gouges tearing at his face.
Resolved to his fate, Harry reached for the parcel and walked back to his bed. Hesitantly, he opened the package, revealing the dreaded contents.
Harry gaped as his eyes flickered between the two, dumbfounded by the bizarre rapport they had. Just as he was about to question what
Harry’s vision blurred and he took a shaky breath, eyes flickering across the Quidditch pitch. Teddy was jumping off of his broom, waving eagerly to his new friends as they began to depart, the day camp finally finishing, before turning to run towards Harry.
Malfoy quirked one brow towards Harry—a question, though Harry had no clue what. He merely rolled his eyes and shrugged in response. Malfoy’s lips twitched in what Harry might have thought was amusement had it been on anyone else, before he turned his gaze from Harry and focused on Teddy.
Cool fingers wrap around your wrist, pulling your hand to a firm chest. You focus on how it expands—inhales and exhales—breathing.
“You have to understand,” Draco started, voice soft, “that Jesse looks out for me. More than anyone has since the war...since my parents.”
As they approached, Harry took a sharp turn, whipping around it with a finesse he hadn’t used since playing Quidditch for Gryffindor prior to the war. He laughed aloud as Teddy cried out in frustration, eyes zeroing in on the lemon tree straight ahead.
Teddy’s hair began to lighten as he gazed up at Harry, morphing to a sandy blond, before a cough sounded to his side.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter. But Trainee Healer Malfoy is currently in the A&E assisting with a procedure.” Her tongue darted out to lick her lips and she smiled shakily up at him. “I am sure that another Healer would be happy to help you—“
Malfoy furrowed his brows, looking at Harry in confusion, his nostrils flaring. “I beg your pardon?”
, alright!?” Harry suddenly yelled, throwing his hands in the air and flinging bubbles from the soapy water into the air. “I bloody well
He had been trying to solve the mystery of Malfoy since he dropped Teddy back off at Andromeda’s cottage on Sunday evening. After three days, nothing new was brought to light. Andromeda had only given him a stern look, reminding him that he was not to speak ill of Malfoy. Teddy, meanwhile, didn’t mind talking about his cousin at all.  In fact, when the topic of Malfoy came up, it was difficult to get Teddy to
Harry clenched his teeth as he stared at Ginny. The room was quiet, save for the soft crackle of logs from the fireplace, and Ginny’s intimidating gaze never wavered from his.
“Magizoology is a fascinating area of study,” Hermione nodded contemplatively, deftly ignoring Ginny’s chuckles.
Draco nodded curtly towards Ron, barely sparing a glance toward Harry before turning on his heels. He strode to the center of the Quidditch Pitch, calling Teddy over to him to say his goodbyes.
“No, no!” Ron shook his head, eyes lifting to the ceiling as he took a deep breath, “No. I just mean that sometimes he helps. Aurors get roughed up a lot, you know? And he’s not so bad, when I do see him.”
Andromeda’s voice called from the sitting room, and Harry winced. Of course Andromeda would know that he was there. She seemed to always notice everything, no matter how inconspicuous he thought he was.
I am still selfish enough to take what I want when I have the chance. Merlin, Harry—if you want this—”
The library was larger than the cottage would imply, and as he looked around Harry couldn’t see anyone. Rows of bookshelves expanded in every direction, overflowing with books and scrolls. Teddy and Malfoy must have been hidden between the shelves further in. He could hear voices in the distance, more distinct than they had been from behind closed doors.
“Goodbye, Nana!” Teddy smiled up at Andromeda and they watched as she called out Narcissa’s home and stepped into the green flames, Floo-ing out of sight within seconds.
Harry laughed, returning Andromeda’s exuberant greetings, before smiling cheekily, “We did enjoy our time together, Andy. If you ever feel the need to visit Narcissa for an extended leave again, I’m sure that we will be fine.”
“I’m ready!” Teddy yelled, sliding into the kitchen, arms windmilling about in an effort to keep himself upright. “Can we go see Gary, now?”
“Well, er...” Harry licked his lips quickly, nodding towards the hallway that would lead towards the kitchen and dining room. “I suppose we should join them...”
“Mhmm,” Hermione nodded, shifting to tuck her feet beneath her legs as she curled into the corner of the loveseat. Gary meowed pathetically at the loss of her fingers, and quickly moved to seat himself upon her lap. “Have you determined what Malfoy is up to?”
Malfoy drew himself away from Harry, lifting himself so that his hands rested on either side of Harry’s head. They both froze, faces mere inches from one another, eyes wide as they stared at the other.
“Sure. Yes, right...” Turning around, Harry reached for the refrigerator, bending to grab the produce and meats they needed. He could feel the cloth of the bottoms pulling taught around his arse. A choked gasp sounded behind him, followed closely by a squeak.
Teddy whimpered, nuzzling into Malfoy’s neck and wrapping his limbs around him as the man stood gracefully from his armchair despite an armful of child.
“Must you eat like a Neanderthal, Potter? Surely you know how to eat with some manners,” Malfoy sneered as he gracefully took his knife and fork in hand, cutting a delicate triangle from his toasty before dipping it into his steaming soup.
“Yes.” Andromeda nodded curtly, crossing her arms under her chest as her sharp eyes bore into Harry. “Draco had no obligations aside from Teddy this morning, and yet shortly after you arrive, he hurries off. Why?”
They were silent for a moment, the only sound in the room the crackling of embers in the hearth, the clinking of ice against glass.
He froze as Draco shifted, resting his hands on either side of Harry’s face and propping himself above Harry as he began to catalogue their injuries, sharp grey eyes wide with concern as they looked over Harry’s torso and limbs.
Harry hesitated, remembering when he had last seen George at the pub earlier that week, before he had stormed out. He hadn’t spoken to him since then, and even though he didn’t think George would hold a grudge against his temper, Harry didn’t relish the idea of encountering his friend just yet.
“Mm...” Ginny hummed, leaning back contemplatively against the arm of the loveseat. “If I lose, and you last more than one week at the café, I’ll convince the Harpies to let you try out our new brooms—maybe keep one of the prototypes.”
They stood in silence on the outskirts of the pitch as Ginny flew away, until Harry shook off the shock of the encounter and snapped his head towards Draco. “What the bloody hell was
, but what if he does in the future? What if something happens where knowledge of how werewolf hierarchies function—their underlying purpose—is absolutely dire for us to know?”
He was not expected until after lunch, and he could picture Hermione and Ron smirking at him for his early arrival, believing he would be carefully observing Malfoy for any suspicious activity, but Harry dismissed any doubts as he strode inside. The cottage was comforting, the life and excitement thrumming inside of it much more desirable than the empty halls of Grimmauld Place. He had nowhere else to be that morning, so thought it would only be practical to see how he could be of assistance with whatever was planned at the cottage.
Harry blinked, licking his lips as he attempted to reorient himself. Turning back to Teddy, who watched him inquisitively, Harry smiled shakily.
“Alright,” Harry shrugged, inhaling quickly as he pushed himself away from the counter. If Malfoy said he was fine with Teddy leaving early, then Harry would just have to take his word for it.
“What!?” Harry gaped, looking quickly between all of his friends. “What are you talking about? I’m not
Harry’s eyebrows slowly rose as he stared at his best friend. Ron had calmed in the five years since the war, maturing with his experience as an Auror. And yet, Harry had never once thought that Ron would ever reference Malfoy as being competent. Ron’s hatred of Malfoy had always rivaled Harry’s own. This sudden respect was unprecedented. Harry had no idea how to react, beyond staring incredulously as Ron turned back to the stew.
“You’re doing this,” you whisper. Potter narrows his eyes, clenching his jaw. “Potter…what are you doing to me?”
Andromeda hummed, her thin lips twitching as she lifted her book, gaze settling onto the yellowed pages. “Teddy and Draco are in the kitchen.”
“Potter,” Malfoy nodded curtly, sparing a quick glance of acknowledgment towards him before turning back to the crumble on the counter.
“You forget things, pet. We’ve talked about this.” He’s stalking towards you, a fire burning in his eyes—the twin flame to that which consumes you.
Draco licked his lips, taking another slow sip from his drink before setting it gently atop the table to his side.
“Yes?” Draco asked, tilting his head to the side and lifting one eyebrow as he gazed across the room at Harry.
Hermione hummed softly as she stood on tip-toes, pulling down bowls and plates from the cupboards, “It does sound like he’s changed. It has been five years, after all.”
“What. Happened.” Draco spat, glaring daggers at Harry. His voice was deep, crisp, sharper and more venomous than Harry thought he had ever heard before.
A cool breeze caresses your skin. The violent flames flicker, dying down until they are nothing but embers, their heat radiating a warmth that wraps around you like a blanket.
“Oh, er, thank you.” Harry felt himself flush at her assumption that he would ask where they were before inquiring about how she was. “And...how are you, Andy?”
Teddy suddenly jumped from his perch on the end table. He smiled brightly as he skipped towards Andromeda. “I told Harry that he didn’t understand the importance of the waltz, Nana!”
Biting his lip, Harry tilted his head back until it rested against the shower wall. He closed his eyes, imagining what it would be like to have a partner standing next to him under the heat of the shower...
. Harry shifted, pulling his knees towards his chest and lifting his arse in the air. Draco did not falter—following his every movement as he ate Harry out, fingers digging into his hips.
Harry groaned, trying to burrow further into his pillow as the early morning light made its way into his room. He felt as if the Sword of Gryffindor was piercing his skull. He thrust his arm out of the blankets cocooning him in warmth, searching blindly for his glasses on the bedside table.
“I won’t, I promise.” Harry peered around the corner to see Malfoy kneeling down and enveloping Teddy in a tight hug, holding him close for longer than Teddy ever allowed before he would inevitably wriggle away. Malfoy pressed a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead before standing and bestowing a kiss to each of Andromeda’s cheeks in farewell.
“Or he’s teaching Teddy to morph so they can take over the ministry, free all of the criminals from Azkaban, and start a new Wizarding War!” George exclaimed.
Malfoy stared off to the side for a moment before his lips trembled, pulling into a shaky smile as a huff of laughter escaped his lips. “Well then, Potter. I suppose that is all we have to discuss, isn’t it? If you’d excuse me, I shall be returning to my dilapidated manor promptly to reflect upon all of the ruins I have left behind me.”
“Really, Gin?” Harry huffed exasperatedly,  pinching his lips together as he narrowed his eyes at her feet.
A few hours passed before Harry heard the Floo roar to life. He was in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner, while Teddy changed into his pajamas upstairs. He had taken to washing dishes the muggle way again, but at the sound of a voice calling out from the sitting room, Harry threw a quick charm at the sink so that the dishes would finish cleaning themselves.
“You are a menace,” Harry narrowed his eyes at the Kneazle, who merely blinked in response. Shaking his head in exasperation, Harry motioned towards the creature, tapping his shoulder. “Well, come on, then. Let’s go see Teddy.”
“Of course you are,” Harry agreed, securing his arms around Teddy as he stood up, shifting slightly so that Teddy sat on his hip before continuing towards Andromeda. “At least until Hermione and Ron start their brood.”
Harry was not sure why he was suddenly so concerned about Malfoy leaving, when surely it would only benefit Harry and provide him with more time alone with his godson. And yet, he also recognized that he
With a slow, graceful movement, the Kneazle leapt from its perch and strode towards the barrier until it was on the opposite side directly in front of Teddy. Blinking, it sat down, tail wrapping pristinely around its front paws, steady gaze not faltering from Teddy’s own.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled. He couldn’t very well let Ginny think he was scared. Besides, he was sure he could last a week working at a café.
“No, no!” Harry shook his head vigorously, “No, she just—you know what? It doesn’t matter. Shouldn’t we finish the toasties?”
were together, and that...well. She didn’t really say, actually.” Harry frowned, recalling how Ginny had urged him to talk to Draco. “But she said that there was a reason that Jesse didn’t like me...And that I should ask you about it.”
“Oh!” Teddy suddenly scrambled to stand up, nearly tripping over his own feet. He spun to look at Draco, wide emerald eyes shining. “Can you read
Harry let out a soft huff of laughter as he let his fingers caress his skin, spreading the soapy lather across his body. Malfoy would be so easy to rile up.
Harry grimaced. He could not deny that he hadn’t been the best dancer in fourth year—nor was he now, nearly a decade later—but he couldn’t admit that to Malfoy.
“Teddy!” she cried, resting a hand gently atop Teddy’s shoulders, eyes wide as she stared apologetically between Draco and Harry. “I am so sorry—he ran out before I could stop him!”
“Mmm...and nothing else of note happened, aside from Teddy’s endeavors at his Quidditch Camp?” Andromeda questioned, settling back into her armchair and gazing at Harry unwaveringly.
Malfoy sat in front of Teddy, back straight, silver eyes unblinking as he stared at Harry, on guard like an animal of prey, frozen in the moment before flight.
.” Harry laid himself over Draco, nuzzling into his neck and pressing soft kisses against his pulse. He did not say he was sorry. This was not the time for apologies and long conversations.
“Don’t what?” Ron asked. His eyes were wide, shining with feigned innocence. He was a Weasley...younger brother to the founders of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. There was no way he was innocent.
? There’s an entire chapter on the subject,” Hermione’s fingers squeezed his shoulders gently, a fond smile tugging at her lips as she looked down at her tipsy boyfriend. Ron had always been easily affected by wine.
Without sparing another thought to the matter, Harry summoned the brooms and made his way back into the cottage. Setting them beside the doorway, Harry strode towards the sitting room, where he could hear voices speaking softly.
Andromeda hummed, raising one eyebrow just as Malfoy had earlier, amusement shining in her eyes. She patted Harry’s cheek once more before looking back at Teddy, “Darling. Be good for your cousin and godfather while I am away. Do you promise?”
To his side, Ginny squeaked, her hands lifting quickly to her mouth in an effort to withhold what Harry suspected was laughter.
“Hello,” Draco replied. A corner of his lips twitched, the dimple revealing itself in his left cheek, and Harry couldn’t help the soft huff of laughter from escaping him.
Ginny and Ron laughed as Harry’s face flushed and he turned back to the gardens, watching Teddy and George as they looked for gnomes.
The soft notes of a piano echoed through the room, string instruments rising to accompany its delicate sound as the melody swelled. Gliding gracefully across the floor were Malfoy and Teddy, ignorant of their sudden audience.
“Ah, of course,” Harry nodded, grimacing as he recalled only weeks before when he had all but forced Malfoy to leave early.
“Er...yeah, it was,” Harry stumbled for a moment, thrown by the sudden spark in Andromeda’s eyes as she watched him.
“Mmm,” Ginny nodded, one finger lazily circling the edge of her wine glass as a corner of her lips pulled up in a smirk. “It could be your incompetence with herbology...or was it the fact that a plant exploded and covered you in purple slime?”
Harry swallowed thickly at Draco’s gentle touch. He bit his lips and averted his gaze, his cheeks heating as he felt a sudden flood of warmth rush through him, followed immediately by the cool comfort of a healing charm. It felt too intimate—in the middle of the Quidditch Pitch, a crowd gathered around them—to have Draco’s magic wash over him, caressing him, lingering like a lover's kiss and easing his pain.
He reached for the mug he had drank his tea from this morning, dipped it into the soapy water and began to wash it as he listened to Ginny’s light footsteps echo down the hall.
With a cheeky wave from Teddy, he and Draco disappeared into the cottage, leaving Harry standing alone in the garden, Teddy’s training broom and Draco’s
Teddy’s silver eyes widened as he watched Harry. His calico-colored hair began to lighten, orange hues morphing into a strawberry blond before continuing to bleed of color.
!” Harry spat. “Whatever you’re up to Malfoy, it ends now. You’ve clearly bewitched Andy and Teddy. You’re manipulating them, slithering into their lives and forcing their trust only to abandon them, and
“Alright, Kreacher, I’ll be back later with Teddy!” Harry called out. He could hear the elf grumbling in the distance, and laughed under his breath before heading into the sitting room and Floo-ing directly to Andromeda’s cottage.
“Oh, really?” Harry questioned, chewing at the inside of his cheek to keep from chuckling as he turned an inquisitive eye towards Malfoy.
created?” Malfoy’s face shuttered, his sneer falling away quickly to be replaced by a blank expression as he stared at Harry.
“You’re leaving already?” Harry frowned, pushing himself from the wall, “You don’t normally go until after lunch.”
“Of course,” Harry nodded, walking further into the room. He sat on the loveseat by Teddy, where Malfoy would remain in his peripheral vision.
Harry’s eyes roamed over Draco’s body, spread wantonly across the armchair. Gods, but he looked absolutely
A huff of withheld laughter sounded from across the table. Harry wasn’t sure who was trying to hide their amusement, but he ignored it for the moment. George’s accusation was more important right now.
They lay beside each other for a few moments, listening to the sounds of their soft breathing. Harry fingered the sharp lines of Draco’s jaw, the tendons of his neck. He lingered on the curves of Draco’s shoulders and the freckles he found there. “Stay with me tonight,” Harry whispered hesitantly, slowly raising his eyes back to Draco’s. “Please.”
Their gaze held, seconds seeming to run together, when Malfoy’s lips parted, eyes flickering—so quickly that Harry
Jesse knew that Harry fancied Draco. He was glaring at him so much during the Quidditch Camp, how could he not have known Harry wanted the man’s boyfriend? Ginny, however, shushed him before he could do more than squeak.
“Have you noticed anything peculiar about when he morphs? Any particular emotions he is experiencing, perhaps, or commonly adopted features?”
Harry didn’t move from the counter as he watched Malfoy wash the dirty dishes, his eyes roaming the other man’s pale form. Malfoy’s shoulders were tense as he stood straight, stiffly lifting a freshly cleaned bowl from the sink and deftly placing it to his left to dry.
Harry felt as if the air in the room was suddenly gone, vanished, as his breath caught in his throat.
an idiot,” Draco growled, voice vibrating deep in his throat as he took a quick step towards Harry. He lifted his hands, threading his fingers through Harry’s curls and
“Hi there, Tedward,” Malfoy grinned, running a hand through Teddy’s hair, before heading further into the garden. He had yet to spare a glance at Harry, focusing instead on Andromeda as he strode forward. “Good morning, Aunt ‘Dromeda. I apologize again for my tardiness.”
Draco smiled fondly, running a hand through Teddy’s dark curls before turning on his heels. Just as Draco was about to cross the wards, he lifted his gaze. Harry wanted nothing more than to take a step forward, to chase after Draco, follow him as he crossed over the wards.
“Good,” Andromeda smiled, approaching him slowly. As she stopped in front of him, she raised her hand and caressed his cheek. They stared into one another’s eyes for a few seconds, considering each other, before Andromeda spoke again. “Do not hurt him.”
sounded on the other side of Harry’s ear, causing him to startle and groan as his head swam with the sudden movement.
Teddy’s eyes were squeezed shut. He clutched at his leg, head tilted towards the ground as his tears soaked into the dirt, his sobs muffled by the earth beneath him.
“Oh, shut it!” Harry laughed. He could get used to this, he thought—to this easy, teasing exchange between them, soft smiles and bright grins.
“Yeah. Yeah, it is,” Harry nodded, smiling tightly at Ron before beginning to walk to Teddy. “Anyway, Ron, I’ll see you later, yeah?”
He was shocked, that much Harry knew. After all...they had only just shook hands, agreeing to be friendly towards one another. Perhaps referring to Malfoy by his given name was one step too far.
Draco pulled away, and Harry whined at the loss. A hand stroked up the center of his back, fingers squeezing at the base of his neck soothingly.
“Draco helped me practise my morph again this morning!” Teddy squealed. “I can do something else, now!”
Andromeda reached for Teddy’s hand, grasping it securely in her own before striding back to the cottage. Harry stood alone in the garden, watching as Andromeda and Teddy disappeared inside, before glancing back at the boundary where Malfoy had Disapparated.
Harry scoffed, fuming, “If it means that he is abandoning his responsibilities to Teddy, then I should know, as his godfather.”
Hermione took a deep breath before steepling her fingers, much like he imagined she did before calmly eviscerating a witness on cross-examination at the Wizengamot. Harry suddenly felt like he was on trial.
“No, Andy!” Harry spared a quick glance at Andromeda’s furious face before glaring back at Malfoy, who remained still. His pale face was frozen, unmoved by Harry’s accusations, only his stormy grey eyes showing any hint of emotion as they roared with life.
“I might have done,” Harry shrugged one shoulder, grinning mischievously. He raised his hands to Draco’s hips, slipping them beneath the material, fingers slowly tracing the lines of Draco’s body, lifting his shirt until Draco raised his arms and allowed the garment to be tugged over his head and thrown to the floor.
“Is it true? I can go see Mr. Neville’s plants soon?” Teddy asked, wrapping his arms tightly around Harry’s neck.
Harry huffed a quick laugh, relaxing in his seat. Relieved that Andromeda was not worried that Teddy had been hurt while in his care, he reached once more for his tea. “Yeah, he was. Teddy wouldn’t let me heal him—only wanted Draco. And Draco was brilliant!”
The music swelled, and Teddy and Malfoy continued to spin around the room, slowing only as the instruments began to quiet, until all that remained was the quiet echo of the strings.
Harry and Teddy stood in silence, watching as the heavy door slowly swung closed behind Malfoy’s retreating form.
“Good. I’ll see you on Sunday, then,” Ginny winked, sending a wry grin his way, before striding from the kitchen. Within moments, Harry heard the
Tripping up the stairs, they made their way to Teddy’s room. While Teddy rushed around, grabbing the toys and books he wanted them to play with, Harry couldn’t help but wonder what he was getting himself into tonight.
Torn jeans adorn your legs, a too tight t-shirt clutching at your chest, revealing far too much of your abdomen. No wonder the chaise lounge is scratching at you—you are practically
Teddy and Gary spent every moment together, running throughout the halls of Grimmauld Place and generally creating a ruckus. Harry didn’t mind—even when he had to listen to the grumbling from Kreacher after his godson departed on Sunday evening—because despite the house elf’s complaints, Harry was certain that Kreacher missed listening to Teddy run around the house just as much as Harry did.
Having decided to leave Rosmerta’s employ, and with no other career prospects lined up, Harry spent the majority of his time the following week lingering around Grimmauld Place, preparing it for guests. Teddy would be staying there the following week while he attended quidditch camp, as Andromeda had decided to extend her weekend visit to France to a full week, and Harry had eagerly jumped at the opportunity to care for his godson for more than a weekend at a time.
“That’s right,” Andromeda set a comforting hand on Teddy’s shoulder before looking back to Draco, “Thank you for coming by, dear. We will see you next week.”
The table was set and they all sat down—Andromeda and Teddy sitting opposite one another at the head of the table, Harry and Malfoy sitting across from each other at their sides.
Harry groaned, rubbing his hands over his face. Ginny was relentless in her teasing and had the unfortunate talent of finding the worst ways to embarrass him.
“Nothing,” He shrugged, turning back to focus on the dirty dishes. He rinsed his mug, placing it to his side to dry, before reaching for his dinner plate.
“Of course,” Malfoy nodded, standing in one graceful movement, his lean body towering over the table. “Mother will surely be looking forward to your arrival. Do you need any assistance with your luggage?’
“Er...with what?” Harry blinked, confused. This conversation felt like it had taken far too many turns for him to realistically have been able to follow it.
“Of course. And Jesse—he’s a Healer, too—he can help,” Draco tilted his head towards the other man. Teddy followed the movement and watched as Jesse smiled, waving at them.
“That they are.” The shopkeeper nodded sagely, calm eyes focused on Teddy. “You know, they say that Kneazles choose their companion, not the other way around. Kneazles know to whom they are to be a familiar.”
Music began to echo throughout the room. It was the same ensemble that Harry had heard when he first arrived. Malfoy’s soft
“You did!” Teddy agreed. He grinned up at his cousin and then turned around, looking frantically through the crowd until his eyes landed in Ginny. “Auntie Gin! They’re fixed now!”
. Running down the hallway, following the soothing voice he could hear murmuring in the distance, Harry skidded into the kitchen.
“Er...Teddy,” he coughed, running a hand through his messy hair in an effort to gather his thoughts, “I’m not sure that we can keep him. Andy won’t—”
Instead, he began to make his way down Draco’s body, placing gentle kisses against porcelain skin, until he reached the top of the first
Malfoy immediately raised a hand to his right cheek, wiping it from cheekbone to temple, and then back down to his sharp jaw, before pulling his hand away to look at the residue it revealed.
“Er, no. No, I didn’t,” Harry said hastily. Malfoy was smirking at him, a mischievous gleam in his eyes, and Harry waved a hand through the air as if to further dismiss Teddy’s accusations. “Anyway, you didn’t answer my question. How is it your
“Well, he was kind of upset on Saturday,” Harry shrugged, looking down at the bread in his hand as he began to tear it apart, “I may have yelled at Malfoy in front of Teddy. He didn’t like that much...so I figured maybe buying the Kneazle would help smooth things over.”
Andromeda hummed softly before giving a curt nod, “Well, alright then. As long as your lessons were completed. Now then, it is time for lunch. I have prepared stuffed guinea fowl with new potatoes and roasted vegetables. Come along, darling.”
Harry watched as his godson scampered off to pick out the best Kneazle beds, food, and toys for his new companion. He still did not understand how he had so quickly gone from Fortescue’s Ice Cream to purchasing a Kneazle, or how Teddy had suddenly gotten
. Harry grimaced before taking a deep breath, tilting his head forward slightly in acknowledgement of Teddy’s request.
“Why, Draco?” Potter runs his fingers along your neck. He leans forward, lips brushing against your ear before he suckles at the lobe. “Do you not want this?”
what he was meant to be doing with his life. The fact that he had lasted for even less time at Rosmerta’s than at Hannah’s was something that he was determined not to reveal to anyone.
They made a few more turns around the room, bodies pressed against one another, the heat steadily rising, before Harry glanced to the entrance of the sitting room, stumbling when his eyes caught on Andromeda’s.
” Ginny mirrored Harry and placed her hands on her own hips. “How do you not realize where I am going with this?”
Teddy ran into the room, dragging a charmed trunk behind him as he skidded to a stop next to Harry. “I’m ready!”
“Oh, er...yeah,” Harry’s eyes shifted down the hallway and he ran a hand through his messy hair, fingers catching in the curls, “Er...I got done at Neville’s early and figured I’d drop by, have lunch with you and Teddy before you Floo-ed out.”
“Mmm...don’t stop on my behalf, Potter. I was quite enjoying the show,” Draco leered, cheek dimpling as he spread his legs and let his eyes roam over Harry’s exposed body.
“No,” you spit, fingers clutching at the wall behind you as you stand to your full height. “Something is—something is
“Because, I...” Harry swallowed, licking his lips nervously before squaring his shoulders. “I like you, Draco. Rather a lot. And I know—I
Harry hesitated for a moment before turning to look at Malfoy, who continued to focus on scrubbing the dirty dishes. “Er...Malfoy? Are you sure you’re okay with him leaving now?”
“You fell asleep. Did you rest well?” Potter asks, raising one thick eyebrow as his bright green eyes stare into your own.
“Now that you are here, love, I must be going. I trust that you will all behave?” Andromeda gracefully stood from her chair, giving a firm look to Malfoy and Teddy, and staring pointedly at Harry while she waited for an answer.
A sudden heat roared through Harry’s gut as he stared at the image, watching raptly as Malfoy repeatedly leaned towards the strange man.
“Hello, Andy,” Harry smiled tightly as he turned around. Andromeda was watching him from an armchair in the sitting room, one perfectly sculpted brunette eyebrow raised as she observed him, a curious smile pulling at her lips.
Harry and Draco stared at one another for a moment before Draco called out, eyes locked on Harry, “I’m here, Tedward. I will be right there.”
Potter lifts your forearm to his mouth, his lips brushing against faded ink, teeth nipping at your skin. He lifts his gaze to yours, something possessive and dangerous flaring in his heated eyes. “You’re mine now. Not
The garden was silent for a few moments before Andromeda let out a soft breath, “Well then, shall we have tea? We can then begin to prepare luncheon. Harry, do be a dear and pick a few tomatoes, won’t you? Come along, Teddy, let’s go wash up.”
Harry pushed himself from his chair, striding over to the sink and thrusting his hands back into the water to resume washing the dishes. He could not afford to think that he had a chance. Even if Draco was not with Jesse—even if he were unattached to
Draco was dressed pristinely in flying gear. Tight cream trousers, molded exquisitely to Draco’s form, led down to knee-high leather boots. A loose white shirt, nearly translucent and billowing from his body, was tucked neatly into his trousers, held in place by a thin leather belt. The shirt was open at the front, revealing the tantalizing line of his collarbones, the dip of his throat.
“Er...” Harry wavered, hesitating as Teddy’s eyes widened even more, grey morphing to a vibrant silver.
As he stepped back through the Floo and into the sitting room, Harry deflated. The house was quiet, save for an inquisitive meow as Gary observed him from his perch on an armchair—questioning where Teddy had gone.
, hypothetically. But...no. You can’t mean that. That would mean that Draco—“ Harry breathed in sharply. “No, he doesn’t.
“Harry...” Andromeda’s brows lifted, eyes lingering on the print of his t-shirt. Delicately, she cleared her throat, “Good morning.”
Confident in his conclusion, Harry strode out of the kitchen and towards the sitting room. Teddy’s laughter echoed down the hallway and as Harry entered the room, it was to Teddy laying on the ground again, Gary leaping over his small body.
against the door to prevent any noise from waking the sleeping child, before he followed Draco back downstairs.
“Anyway, I must be off,” Ginny mounted her broom in one swift movement, throwing a wink Harry’s way before speeding off. “See you later, losers!”
“Harry,” Hermione spoke quietly at his side, gently grasping his arm as she stepped to his side. “Regardless of Ron and Ginny...I do think that you should consider, at least, what this may mean for Teddy. What his
“Harry, what color do you want?” Teddy asked as Harry sat down beside him, his knee brushing against Draco’s as he folded his legs.
A small hand tugged lightly at Harry’s shirt, and Harry startled as he looked down to see Teddy staring up at him, turquoise hair glimmering in the early afternoon sun and silver eyes sparkling. “Is the soup ready, Harry?”
The garden was silent but for Teddy’s stuttering breaths, desperately inhaling between his sobs. Harry’s gaze flickered between the three of them. Andromeda slowly raised her eyes from her grandson, her icy stare suddenly intent on Harry. Malfoy was focused solely on Teddy, his lips parted in shock.
“He really wasn’t mad at me,” Teddy whispered, gently running his fingers across Gary’s back, a loud purr reverberating throughout the room.
the other month, and how close you were. And...I mean, at the camp last weekend, I don’t think I was exactly
“What do you mean?” Harry narrowed his eyes slightly as he stared across the table, watching Ron shuffle in place.
Harry blinked, staring uncomprehendingly at the entrance to the sitting room. Everything, from the moment he arrived at the cottage this morning to dancing with Malfoy to this very moment, made no sense. He felt as if he must surely be dreaming, because how could any of this had actually happened?
“Yes, but I missed him, Nana!” Teddy replied, squirming around on Harry’s lap so that he could rest his back against Harry’s chest and look over at his grandmother. Harry wrapped his arms around Teddy’s torso, ensuring he was secure and wouldn’t topple over the edge of the armchair in his excitement.
Draco studied Harry curiously for a moment before tilting his head in acknowledgement. “Very well. I will owl prior to any visit. Thank you for the invitation.”
A sharp inhale of breath broke his attention, and he looked up into Malfoy’s eyes, widened in shock and pupils blown as he stared back at Harry.
As Harry explained what had happened to Ron and Hermione, George swiftly lifted Teddy from the training broom and placed him firmly atop his shoulders, running around the gardens with a roar as Teddy squealed. Ginny laughed and summoned the training broom, making her way towards the trio.
Teddy pouted. His gaze flickered between Harry and Draco before he stepped forward, wrapping his arms securely around one of Draco’s slender thighs.
“Harry, I’m getting better!” Teddy exclaimed with a squeal. His tiny hands grabbed at the broom handle securely as he slowly made his way towards Harry, hovering only a few feet above the ground. “I’m ready to go
had perched before he rolled his shoulders, turned and continued to make his way towards the sidelines.
“Of course.” A small smile graced his lips and Teddy stepped forward, wrapping his arms tightly around Malfoy as he burrowed his face in his cousin’s neck.
Lazily, Draco turned his head, one perfectly manicured blond brow lifting as he stared at Harry. His lips pursed, fighting a smile, though the dimple in his left cheek revealed his amusement.
“Yeah, the Harpies told us about it yesterday when we went to their practice,” Harry chuckled as he recalled the conversation—or lack thereof.
“Oh!” she gasped. “Yes, of course, Mr. Potter. Uhm...” She looked down at her charts, scanning the contents before meeting his eyes. “You may wait for him in Room 7. Down the hallway, to your left. The procedure should be complete shortly and I will alert Trainee Healer Malfoy right away.”
He watched, hypnotized as his tan fingers pressed into the pale flesh of Malfoy’s cheeks. A deep flush was spreading across those cheeks, and Harry wondered if it was from the pressure of his own thumb against the porcelain skin.
Standing up, Harry listened for any sign that the creature was on his way to the sitting room. The halls remained quiet, no indication of paws padding across hardwood floors, and Harry rolled his eyes. The Kneazle was certainly a Black—overdramatic and stubborn.
. He then made his way to the kitchen and began to reorganize everything so that they would be up to the standards of...well, others. He scrubbed the surfaces until they gleamed, spotless in the midday sun.
team allowed to make use of the company’s new brooms for the first year after their invention. The brooms were rumored to be the fastest, most agile that the wizarding world had ever seen. “Gin, I’ve been begging you to let me try one. You said it was impossible!”
“Hey there, stranger,” Ginny greeted, striding towards Harry and jumping up to sit atop the counter.
With one more self-assured nod, Harry walked out of the cottage and spun on his heels, Disapparating on the spot.
He was met with silence for a few moments before George spoke again, amusement poorly disguised as confusion, “Luna? She would have told me about that, certainly.”
Teddy pouted unsuccessfully at Malfoy before turning his gaze. Heaving in a deep breath, Teddy jumped from the stool to stand directly in front of Harry. “Harry,
Andromeda suddenly stood in one fluid movement, brown eyes sparking with fury, “Harry James Potter. What did I tell you about speaking ill of Draco in this house?”
Harry grinned down at his godson before glancing hesitantly towards Malfoy. “Er...Malfoy, do you mind if I join?”
She sighed, pursing her lips in a tight smile as she rubbed a soothing circle on one of his wrists. “It’s about the hierarchy, Harry. Maybe his morphing is related to that. Perhaps a part of Teddy is trying to appease those who he views as being...more superior to him. His alphas, for lack of a better word.”
“Er...we were racing. And, well,” he hesitated, biting at his lower lip, glancing sheepishly at Draco before quickly looking away when he realized that Draco’s focus was solely on the child in front of him. “Teddy fell from his training broom.”
“Brilliant!” Ginny squealed, lunging forward and wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck, pulling him in for a tight hug. “Oh, I’m so glad you agreed, Harry! You’re going to be
Ginny hummed next to him, drawing her knees to her chest and resting her socked feet on the edge of the kitchen counter as she stared at him.
After all, he had grown up with nothing but stern. He did not want Teddy to ever experience what he had. And yet...well. Perhaps he could be slightly more firm...only sometimes, of course.
“I must be off,” he said quietly, turning to smile down at Teddy. “I will see you in a few days, Tedward.”
. Despite his experience with the Dursley’s, he did enjoy cooking. Perhaps this would be the career that Harry finally connected with. The corner of his lips tugged up in a smile as he circled the word. He would have to reach out to his friends, perhaps owl Rosemerta to see if she would be willing to take on an apprentice at The Three Broomsticks.
“Oh, Potter,” Malfoy heaved an exasperated sigh, running nimble fingers through his pale hair. Harry watched as the strands fell from Malfoy’s grasp, wondering briefly what they might feel like as they slipped between his own fingers.
“Of course. Anyway...” Draco smiled tightly—though Harry noticed that his dimple did not appear—looking just over Harry’s shoulder. “Unfortunately, I must depart. I have been called into the A&E this afternoon, and cannot be late.”
Harry froze, eyes wide as his eyes flickered across Ginny’s face, looking for any hint that she was lying to him. Slowly, she lifted her finger from his lips. He took a shaky breath and whispered, “But...they were at that gala together. They were pictured in
“Does that mean—” Teddy inhaled sharply, a bright grin splitting his face. His eyes widened dramatically, shining brightly with his excitement, and his hair began to morph, shifting quickly between blond and black. “Does that mean that you are
Teddy eagerly waved back, although Harry hesitated before lifting his own hand, his eyes lingering on Jesse before turning away.
Malfoy’s hand was surprisingly warm, his grip firm. For a moment, Malfoy’s gaze was focused solely on their clasped hands, holding still between them, before the silver irises flickered up to meet Harry’s.
Harry startled, eyes widening with indignation, “He’s not my—what? No! He’s not my favorite anything!”
“Er...Teddy is in his room, getting ready for bed,” Harry explained, nodding his head towards the hallway that would lead upstairs. He paused, shifting slightly on his heels before blurting out, “I’m glad you came.”
“No, I didn’t!” Teddy stated, straightening where he sat, stormy grey eyes sparkling as he smirked. “Draco
subtle when it comes to Draco. Nearly everyone knows you fancy him—everyone except, perhaps, Draco. And Jesse to a certain extent.”
to bring Teddy to Draco, and Harry couldn’t regret his decision. Even disregarding Draco’s training as a Healer and the fact that Teddy had asked for him, Draco’s response was reason enough. Rushing into the room, frantic and disheveled, yet calm and soothing when healing Teddy, Draco had been extraordinary.
“Yes—wait, no!” Harry frowned. “No, nothing like that. Andy would sense if it were something big, but she’s enamored with him. No...whatever he’s doing, it’s more subtle. It must have something to do with them—with Teddy and Andromeda. He’s trying to manipulate
“Yeah, and maybe I’m the bloody Queen of England,” Harry scoffed, crossing his arms as he leaned back in his chair, “They’re not his
, and there’s nothing going on?” He laughed incredulously. “No. No, something is going on. He didn’t admit to anything, but something is going on. He wasn’t only there to visit. Andy would have told me if she and Teddy had been seeing Malfoy. I’m telling you, he is
“Thank you, darling. Have a wonderful weekend with Harry. I will see you upon my return.” She placed a soft kiss to Teddy’s forehead before he skipped over to Malfoy.
Harry instinctively pulled his broom to a halt. He snapped his head around just in time to watch as Teddy took a sharp turn around the bed of lilies, his training broom tilting precariously to the side.
” Draco smirked “—I have, on multiple occasions, had the unfortunate privilege of assisting Ginevra and her teammates with their assorted injuries. The lot of them are entirely unable to keep themselves balanced atop a broom. How on earth they have managed to become professional Quidditch players, I will never know.”
“Teddy? Andy?” He called out, frowning. He had expected to hear activity from the direction of the library, where Teddy liked to practise morphing with Malfoy, or the kitchen, where Teddy liked to watch Malfoy prepare lunch—and the image of Malfoy cooking was something Harry couldn’t possibly fathom, so he hastily pushed it from his mind.
“Draco doesn’t go out much. He’s quite dedicated, you know. It would take a lot for him to miss spending time with little Teddy.”
Harry licked at his lips subconsciously as he catalogued every change. Malfoy really had grown into himself since the end of the war...and it did seem like, perhaps, his character had changed for the better as well.
“Okay!” Teddy stumbled out of the sitting room, footsteps tripping as he made his way clumsily up the stairs to his room.
They continued to play for nearly an hour—Teddy won the first two rounds, and the last was taken by a rather smug Draco. As Draco preened—“My
Teddy’s bright eyes locked on Harry’s. Shining beneath a messy fringe of platinum blond curls were brilliant emerald irises, flecks of silver lending them an ethereal sparkle.
perfecting something so common as a crumble. “Alright, then, Malfoy. Go on, show us what you’ve got.”
, Harry!” Ginny stuck her tongue out, leaning forward to shove Harry. “And I’ve barely heard from you the past few days. What’s been going on?”
Harry quickly sat back in his chair, raising his hands in the air in surrender as he said with a full mouth, “I’ll look at it, Kreacher. I promise.”
“But...” Teddy whimpered, chewing his bottom lip as he hugged the Kneazle closer to his body. His eyes flickered quickly around the room as if trying to think of something—
Hermione rested her head against Harry’s shoulder, reaching out to squeeze his hand. “I’m glad, Harry. We all are. You deserve it.”
he would be with blond hair and green eyes. How his friends had all looked at him as if he were the stupidest man alive.
Hermione sucked at her bottom lip for a moment, breathing in deeply as she considered Harry. With a quick exhale of breath, she asked, “What features does he morph into when he is feeling strongly, Harry?”
“He...what?” Harry froze, trying to school his features as he realized that Malfoy had ditched, abandoning Teddy during his regularly appointed time with the boy.
His lips were parted around a large wooden spoon, cheeks puffed out, blackcurrant filling leaking from the corners of his mouth. His bright eyes widened as he looked between Malfoy and Harry before pulling the spoon from his mouth with a wet
A sniffle sounded, followed closely by Teddy’s choked voice, “I know. But you’ll be back next week, right Draco? You can’t forget.”
“Er...well, like I said. Ginny won a bet and...you know,” Harry shrugged awkwardly, gesturing to his apparel.
The Kneazle was tiny, the size of a kitten. It resembled a calico with its orange, black and white coloring, splotches of color painted across its fur. Bright green eyes shimmered as it stared at Teddy, tail twitching lazily.
“No, certainly not,” Andromeda agreed, setting a hand gently on Teddy’s shoulder, “I am sure Draco momentarily forgot himself. Although, wizards often do when confronted when they least expect it.” Andromeda’s steady gaze settled onto Harry, one eyebrow raised in accusation.
Teddy cried, letting out a high pitched scream of agony. He began to plead between choked sobs, crying out for his cousin.
Yes, surely this would be the catalyst that Harry needed to make everyone realize the truth to Malfoy’s schemes. With a huff, Harry shoveled the remainder of his breakfast into his mouth and pushed away from the table. He stared down at the
“We will see you on Monday, dear,” Andromeda smiled, nodding as she placed a comforting hand on Teddy’s shoulder.
” Ron spluttered. The Harpies had signed a contract with the Cleansweep Broom Company after their last winning season, ensuring that they would be the first and
“What!?” Ron chortled, leaning forward with his palm beneath his nose to catch any ale spilling from his mouth. “You were
“Great!” Teddy exclaimed, smiling brightly. He reached out to grasp Harry’s hand and began to tug him towards the kitchen.
Harry grumbled as he tied his trainers. Teddy had begged that Harry bring Gary to the cottage today, so that Andy and
Draco placed his hands on Teddy’s shoulders and began to slowly guide him back towards the cottage, “Well, then, we must begin to prepare luncheon before Andromeda departs. Come along, Tedward. Potter, be a dear and clean up the brooms, would you?”
They made their way to the edge of the pitch. As they reached the border, they turned and caught sight of Ron, Ginny, and Jesse. The three of them stood together and waved their hands in farewell, watching as Harry and Teddy departed.
“You think he’d be any better rotting away in Azkaban like the rest of them? At least I can do something for him. He didn’t have a choice in any of this…not really.”
“What do you mean, you don’t know what I am referring to!?” Harry threw his hands exasperatedly into the air. “Draco, you kissed her hand and bowed. You called her
“Here they are, young man.” The elderly owner stopped in front of a wall of cages, all interlocking to create a maze. Kneazles of various sizes and colors lounged about, keen eyes observing the newcomers, while others jumped from one perch to another.
Standing on the outskirts of the pitch was Ron, a triumphant smirk upon his lips as he watched Harry chasing after Draco.
It was not as if Harry had planned on saying no, anyway. But with Teddy looking at him so earnestly, desperate to experience his first Quidditch Camp, Harry had quickly agreed not only to enroll him in the day camp, but also to purchase his first training broom so that he could begin to practise at home.
When they were far enough away that Harry could no longer hear Draco or Jesse, Ron cleared his throat.
With not even a backwards glance, Malfoy placed a hand gently atop Teddy’s shoulder, guiding him to the cupboards so that they could gather plates and utensils with which to set the small kitchen table. Despite Andromeda’s initial insistence on proper decorum, they had all begun to dine together on Saturday’s at the table at the center of the large kitchen, an informal and intimate affair that Harry took comfort in.
Teddy shifted excitedly from one foot to the other. He reached eagerly for his broom and swiftly mounted it, smiling proudly when he did not need Harry’s help.
“I was not!” Harry spat. “I was just watching him. He was always up to something at Hogwarts! And it’s a good thing I did, too, because I was
“I see,” Hermione nodded slowly. She steepled her fingers together and pressed them against her lips, eyes sparkling as she stared at him. “Do you have any thoughts about that?”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat, lips parting as his eyes flickered across Andromeda’s face. Her smile was soft, loving, as she watched him. But her eyes were firm, a threat hidden within their depths.
“Damnit,” Harry groaned as he rolled off of Draco, rubbing his hands across his face in dismay. He adored Teddy, but the child had
“Honestly, Harry. You should pay attention to these things! The case was not relevant, but the inherent hierarchy that they were contesting is.”
“Oh, Harry, guess what!?” He exclaimed, eyes shining as he pushed himself up to his knees. “Guess, guess!”
“Okay!” Teddy skipped his way out of the kitchen, clambering up the stairs to grab his overnight bag.
. And not like they did at Hogwarts, either. Almost like they’re...Merlin, like they’re friends. Like it’s a
“I do, but...I really want to see Gary,” Teddy mumbled. He shuffled back and forth for a moment before stammering, “Draco...? Would you mind if I went to see Gary now?”
On Thursday evening, as he stood over his sink, hands pruning from the soapy water as he washed the dishes from his evening meal, Harry heard the familiar
Ron hesitated briefly, biting his lower lip before shrugging one shoulder, “I don’t know, mate. The ferret seems pretty responsible these days. He probably had a legitimate obligation.”
“If that is all, I will show myself to the guest quarters. Good evening, and thank you for your hospitality.”
“Harry—” Hermione interrupted before he could begin to argue with George “—you still have not provided any evidence that would support that theory. I’m not saying you’re wrong, but you are jumping from one theory to the next with very little proof, if any. Despite Malfoy helping Teddy morph—and it does sound like he was
Harry grinned brightly. “Good.” He leaned forward, brushing his lips briefly against Draco’s, before tucking his head below Draco’s chin. He breathed in deeply, reveling in the sharp scent of citrus, drifting asleep to the feeling of fingers carding through his hair.
As Harry observed the camp, his eyes caught on Teddy, who was flying circles around the other children—quite literally. He handled his training broom with such finesse that it was clear he had an innate talent...or he had practiced for far longer than Harry had helped him.
“It’s short for Garfield Lasagnaface McWhiskers,” Harry grumbled. A loud snort of laughter escaped Ron, and Hermione and Luna smiled indulgently.
“Oh, shut it,” Harry laughed, grinning at the other man. Draco’s smile softened and he looked down at the game, pale lashes fluttering against his rosy cheeks, freckles prominent against the flush.
“Well, mate,” Ron set his glass down, sucking his teeth, “I hope you know what you’ve gotten yourself into this time.”
“Harry James Potter!” Andromeda hissed, features sharp in her fury. “I will not have you speaking with such foul language in front of Teddy, or towards Draco. What did I tell you the other week?” Behind her, Teddy whined softly, his fingers clutching at her robes.
He could safely say that his latest career attempt was a failure. As he slowly made his way to the second floor, Harry mentally cursed Ron for ever thinking he could be a
They stared at one another for a few moments before Teddy’s peal of laughter echoed down the hallway and Harry looked away. Teddy adored Malfoy, and it was clear that Malfoy likely felt the same, if his interactions today meant anything at all. Maybe—at least in this instance—Malfoy wasn’t
. Choose whichever explanation you understand,” Narrowing his eyes speculatively, Malfoy sneered, “I thought you kept track of my every movement.”
Harry stumbled into his bathroom, tugging his t-shirt over his head before turning on his shower. Within moments, the room was filling with steam. He turned to look at his reflection in the mirror, at the angry red of his chest where the coffee had scalded him. Grasping his wand, Harry murmured a quick healing charm, relaxing at the instant relief it provided. He quickly shimmied out of his jeans and pants before stepping underneath the spray of water with a loud groan, closing his eyes as he let the hot water wash over him.
clutched in its talons. Harry glowered as he looked at the rolled up paper. He had wanted to cancel Grimmauld Place’s subscription to the paper, but Kreacher had declared that
Harry blinked, dumbfounded, at Hermione. “Are you joking? What about just being there, at Andy’s? She and Teddy are obsessed with him! It’s not right!”
Harry raised his eyes to meet Malfoy’s as he began to cut his own toasty, replicating the precise movements that Malfoy had made with his own meal. He dipped a triangle of his sandwich into his soup before slowly lifting it to his mouth, wrapping his lips around the parcel of food with a soft hum, never once letting his eyes part from Malfoy’s sharp gaze.
His friends’ teasing from the night before came back to him in a rush, and Harry frowned as he pushed himself from his bed. He was certain that they did not know what they were talking about. He wasn’t obsessed, and Malfoy
“No, not really,” Harry shrugged, not taking any offense. He did like creatures, but certainly not with the passion that Luna did, or Hagrid. He’d rather his care be put towards those he loved, like Teddy.
“Harry!” Teddy squealed, scrambling up and running towards Harry. Without hesitation, Harry knelt down, enveloping Teddy in his arms as he ran into him, laughing as they fell to the ground with the force of Teddy’s embrace.
A soft cough sounded from behind him, and Harry turned his head to see Malfoy standing awkwardly at the side of the kitchen, watching Harry as he held his godson. Malfoy’s pale brows were furrowed, and he looked confused, before he straightened and offered a smile towards Andromeda.
Harry stumbled after him. They made their way downstairs to the kitchen, where Draco set the mugs of cocoa on the counter with a swift
He drew back, straddling Draco’s hips and looking down into bright silver eyes. Draco paused, his tongue darting out to wet his lips as he watched Harry carefully. After a moment, he inclined his head in a hesitant nod.
Draco ran his fingers through Teddy’s curls one last time before turning around, pausing when his eyes met Harry’s.
“I mean—well, he’s your friend.” Harry shrugged, biting nervously at his bottom lip. “He’s your friend, and he doesn’t like me. But I want him to...” Harry took a deep breath, eyes focused on his thumb as he began to slowly rub it against Draco’s smooth skin.
“Harry, no.” Draco shook his head once, firmly. “It’s in the past. We have both changed since then...” Draco looked away, eyeing the exit, as he swallowed. “Unless this changes things for you. I would understand if it reminds you of our pasts, or if you realized you did not want—”
“He is,” Harry nodded, grinning broadly as he watched his godson toss the quaffle through the hoop behind Ron, thrusting one fist into the air as he cheered in victory. He stood up, clapping as he cheered. “Great job, Teddy!”
“Potter—” Harry stiffened, hating the sound of his surname on Draco’s lips after only a few weeks of going without it. After a moment, Draco whispered, “Why, exactly, do you think that Jesse doesn’t like you?”
Bending at his hips, Draco leaned down to press a kiss to the crown of Teddy’s head, then turned on his heels and strode gracefully from the room.
Ron brushed by Hermione, gently squeezing her shoulder as he made his way to the stove, checking on the rest of the stew that they were preparing.
When he finally raised his eyes to meet Andromeda’s, she took a delicate sip from her tea, brown eyes twinkling with mischief, one side of her lips tugged up in an amused smirk.
“Oh, certainly,” Andromeda grinned sharply, “Teddy told me all about his adventures at camp. He was quite enthusiastic about it. It sounds like it was quite the event.”
Teddy giggled, squirming in Harry’s arms in a weak effort to escape his grasp. He wriggled down, eventually making his way out of Harry’s arms and skipping back towards Malfoy and the stool he had abandoned.
Ginny stuck her tongue out at him, her nose scrunching up, before she lifted the wine glass to her lips again. Harry glared at her, wondering—not for the first time—what he had ever seen in her. She was trouble, that one. Too mischievous and bold for her own good.
He continued to cheer Teddy on, waving whenever he paused mid-flight to look over and make sure that Harry was watching. As camp drew to a close, Harry chanced a look towards where the instructors and volunteers stood.
Draco barked a sharp laugh, limbs tangling with Harry’s as they rolled around on the bed, snickering as they each tried to pin the other down.
As he approached the kitchen, Teddy’s voice rose, desperate in its pleas. “—you can’t go yet! We haven’t had lunch yet!”
They spent the next few minutes on the side of the pitch, silent but for Ron’s occasional snickering, as Harry observed Teddy—carefully avoiding looking in the direction of Draco and Jesse.
Harry frowned as he watched Andromeda leave, pondering her departing smile. She acted as if she knew something.
“I’m okay, Teddy,” Harry said quietly, trying to smile despite wrapping his free arm around his ribs to ease the pain.
“Finally!” Teddy cried, scrambling from the armchair. Gary squawked, hissing his displeasure at being disturbed from his perch. “Can we go
!” Teddy cried, stampeding down the stairs and stumbling into the sitting room. “We’re going to be late!”
ingredients for their meal, Harry took a moment to gather his bearings. She moved around the kitchen as if she had not just scolded Harry with the ferocity of a dragon, humming softly to herself.
Glancing down at Teddy, however, who was staring up at Harry with pleading grey eyes, Harry let out a soft sigh, “Of course, Teddy. Finish your ice cream and we can go say hi to George.”
“Lunch will be served first, Tedward,” Malfoy’s clear voice stated. He stood straight as if nothing had happened, save for the slight blush at the tips of his ears.
as Malfoy swallowed, his fingers twitching and brushing quickly up and down his trousers before settling once more at his sides.
Working as a cook for Rosmerta had not gone as well as he had hoped it would. His back ached from standing over the stove all week, cooking orders that had to adhere
Teddy was hovering on his training broom by Draco’s side, flying smooth circles around him as they spoke to one another, Teddy’s left hand grasped in Draco’s to keep him balanced.
She looked up as he approached, hazel eyes widening as she immediately recognized him. “Mr. Potter, sir!”
“Er, well...” Harry cleared his throat, suddenly feeling uncomfortably hot as his friends gazed at him. “Well, he is surprisingly good with Teddy...and Teddy and Andy like him. So, I mean...I guess he’s got to be okay, right?”
There had been multiple occasions when, upon Harry’s arrival, Andromeda had informed him that Teddy was busy cleaning his room or finishing a project, but
“I’m sorry!” Harry spluttered, twisting around where he sat so that he could look Draco in the eyes. “I know we didn’t really talk about all of that, about you staying, but...I’d like it. If you stayed...today, tomorrow. Whenever you’d like, really.”
Draco hummed against his throat, tilting his hips forward so that Harry could feel the thick girth of him against his hips. Harry shuddered, his body arching into Draco’s as his hands roamed lower, caressing Draco’s sides. He gripped sharp hip bones, and without a second thought, twisted them into the disorienting spin of Apparition.
“Draco can come visit us tonight!” Teddy chirped. “Please, Draco, will you? You can come to Grimmauld and play games and we can have a
Harry froze in place, just over the threshold of the kitchen. He could hear Teddy running around upstairs, Andromeda down the hallway in her room as she packed for the trip she took to France every weekend. While her husband had been sentenced to life in Azkaban, Narcissa had been cleared of all charges and fled to France. Andromeda had reunited with her sister and now, five years after the war, spent every weekend visiting her, while Harry watched Teddy.
Malfoy’s face was relaxed, looking content and happy as he watched Teddy, silver eyes sparkling with adoration. He chuckled, twirling them around the room to the graceful rhythm of the music.
In the soft evening light, Draco’s porcelain skin glowed, lit from within. His cheeks were flushed, the smattering of freckles across his nose standing out. Long, graceful fingers caressed the top of Teddy’s head, voice fading as quiet snores became evident, indicating that Teddy had at last fallen asleep.
“So then...why are you telling me?” Harry asked, glancing to his side to see if Luna and Ron were as confused as he was. They seemed to be following along perfectly.
“Wait, what?” Harry spun around to look closer at his room. All of his clothes, normally strewn haphazardly throughout the space, were gone. “Kreacher, I said I would be right out. Not to wash my clothes! I have to go to Andy’s, what am I going to wear?”
“Er...” Harry coughed lightly, clearing his throat as he glanced up at Malfoy. Slowly, Malfoy’s gaze shifted from Teddy, icy silver meeting emerald.
. No, he was protecting his godson and Andromeda. This was what family did, after all. They watched over one another.
Harry grimaced, turning back to the sink of dirty dishes. There was one last glass to be washed, and Harry reached for it, desperate for something to do with his hands as he searched for something to say.
“Er...I’m not sure. Luna is trying to convince me to help her at the sanctuary. She thinks I’d make a good magizoologist...”
In the silence that followed, Harry refused to meet Andromeda’s eyes. He could feel her firm stare on him as he fidgeted in place. Before he could suggest that he and Teddy begin to prepare lunch, her cool voice cut through.
Harry hesitated as he looked down at Teddy, who gazed up at him with bright, glimmering silver eyes, lower lip trembling with his pout, before looking towards Malfoy.
Harry felt like he must be in an alternate universe. There was no other logical explanation for why Malfoy was comforting Teddy, tending to his wounds, speaking softly with reassuring caresses.
Startled, they sprang apart. Harry’s hand felt cold, bereft after the sudden loss of Malfoy’s warm palm.
Harry lost himself in the heat of Draco’s mouth, his back pressed firmly against the wall, Draco’s hard body at his front. He threw his head back, gasping as Draco mouthed along his jaw.
Turning the corner, Harry leaned against the doorway, resting against it as he had the previous week, watching the scene before him.
Draco reached for the untouched mugs of cocoa on the bedside table and walked towards Harry. He brushed past Harry on his way from the bedroom, and Harry couldn’t stop from inhaling the whiff of citrus that followed.
“Er...it’s fine,” Harry shrugged as he collapsed in an armchair. He didn’t know when Hermione had the chance to talk to Andromeda recently, let alone why she was asking about his time at the cottage, but one could never be too careful when Hermione began to question something.
Draco leaned forward, resting his forehead against Harry’s. For a few moments, the room was silent, save for the quiet
“Mm...perhaps not,” Hermione hummed. “It is curious, however, the instances in which Teddy appears to morph without control.”
Platinum blonde hair framed his face. His right eye remained a brilliant amber, glimmering with mischief, while the left was a stormy grey, silver threaded throughout, a perfect mirror of those belonging to the man behind him.
“We were flying at Grimmauld, in the gardens,” Harry started, swallowing thickly as he watched Draco work, his cheeks beginning to flush in embarrassment. He had been a horrible godfather—unable to protect Teddy during a simple flying lesson—and now Draco was there to witness his complete lack of competence as a caregiver.
Ginny heaved a deep breath. “Harry—” she started, looking firmly into his eyes, “—will you join us in running a monthly Quidditch Camp? As a job. That you will be paid for.”
“If I win, you’ll wear those jogging bottoms that Dean so thoughtfully gifted me last Christmas. You’ll wear them to Andromeda’s.”
Teddy opened his mouth widely, taking a deep breath as if preparing for a long winded story, when Draco quickly interrupted him, rushing over to place a gentle hand on Teddy’s shoulder.
Draco threw his head back, exposing the long line of his throat, a loud bark of laughter escaping him—free and wholly undignified. Harry grinned as he followed in their wake, unable to take his eyes off of Draco as he laughed aloud, spinning around and wrapping his arms around Teddy before throwing the boy over his shoulders and making his way out into the garden.
He stood up, fingers still clutched in Teddy’s tiny fist. “Well, then, Tedward...” He smiled fondly at his godson, “Shall we go home?”
“It’s delightful to have you join us early. Teddy and I were just deciding which vegetables we would use for today’s luncheon,” Andromeda nodded towards the vegetation in front of her, “Teddy thinks we should use fresh tomatoes in our pasta. I am of the opinion that we should experiment with aubergine. What are your thoughts?”
“Don’t.” Harry snapped, stepping to the side of the Quidditch pitch. He could see Draco and Jesse in the distance, talking heatedly. In the middle of the pitch, Teddy maneuvered between various obstacles, cheered on by the Harpies and other children as they practiced tossing Quaffles to one another.
“I’m sure.” Harry agreed, hooded eyes falling to Draco’s lips. “Promise me, though. Promise me, we are not rushing this.”
,” Harry repeated, frowning as he looked between his two best friends. There was no way Andromeda would willingly let Malfoy spend time with Teddy—let alone
Harry stumbled on his next step as his arm was pulled backwards. He glanced behind him, tilting his head in a question as Teddy stood frozen, staring up at Harry with wide grey eyes.
on the bedside table. With a grace that Harry knew he himself would not have been able to achieve, Draco untangled himself from Teddy’s arms, leaning over to place a gentle kiss against the boy’s forehead.
Draco smiled softly, threading his fingers through blond curls and placing a fond kiss to the boy’s forehead. “Yes, Tedward. I will be here in the morning.”
Draco huffed, rolling his eyes so thoroughly that his head followed the movement. “Yes, Harry. He is
Hermione cleared her throat softly, smiling indulgently as she watched Harry. “Did you hear me, Harry?”
“Because, Harry,” Hermione huffed, “It’s about werewolves and pack hierarchy. Teddy may not be a werewolf, but Remus was. We already know that Teddy has Tonks’s metamorphmagus abilities. What if he also ends up having some of Remus’s werewolf genetics? There’s still no clear evidence if bitten werewolves can pass the genes to their offspring. Don’t you think we should be prepared if Teddy is influenced by something?”
Ginny hummed, tilting her head as she observed Harry from her perch on the loveseat. Slowly, her eyes glimmered with mischief, her lips splitting with a sharp smile.
Teddy squirmed, burrowing further into Draco’s side, though his eyes did not leave Harry’s. One corner of his mouth rose in a small smile, a dimple that had never been there before appearing on his cheek.
With a quick bite to Draco’s chest, Harry began to make his way down his torso, placing wet kisses to the salty skin along the way. He popped the button and pulled down the zip of Draco’s trousers, dipping his tongue into Draco’s navel, evoking a stuttered groan from the other man as his hand grasped at Draco through the thin fabric of his pants.
Harry paused, letting the door slam shut, separating him from Draco and Teddy momentarily. He took a deep breath and clenched his fists, letting the pain of his nails digging into his palms pull him back into reality, away from the fantasy of having
“You heard me, Malfoy. If you are such an expert at baking crumble, I want to see what you can do,” Harry smirked, his tongue darting out and wetting his lower lip.
“Wonderful,” Andromeda interjected before Harry could respond, “Now, why don’t we all adjourn in the sitting room for tea before preparing luncheon?”
