On a get well card
That I'm skin and bone /
“I let myself get swept up in it. Even Ron and Hermione thought so. You made it hard not to, I guess.”
Draco feels his breath catch, watches as Harry pushes himself up to mirror Draco’s seated position. He is close now, perhaps too close, and Draco observes the sweep of his eyelashes as he blinks, sees the bob of his Adam’s apple as he swallows. There is potential here also, Draco knows, a sense of expectancy that leaves the moment charged and electric.
“I was under the assumption that this had already been established, Harry, or did you not attempt to curse me in sixth year and almost leave me to bleed out on the bathroom floor?”
“Mistakes are a natural part of living,” he answers, and cannot seem to pull his focus away from that gaze, that startling shade of green which somehow takes Draco’s breath away and makes it come easier to his lungs simultaneously. Draco is enraptured, has lost himself in this boy and knows, without a doubt, that wherever Harry goes will always be where Draco belongs. “We were rivals. Had I been in your position, I can’t say that I wouldn’t have done the same as what you did. Any dislike you held towards me was very much mutual, and that made us foolish. Let the blame be shared; I can assure you that I warrant a significant amount of it.”
When the world gets too heavy /
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry says, and his voice is determined, uncompromising, but Draco can’t. Not with this. Not with Harry a line of warmth and comfort and safety along his side, a reminder of something that came before, something whole, and soft, and always startlingly absent… until.
Rivals, he recalls distantly as he takes the long way back to the dormitories. Schoolyard enemies, without a doubt, and yet, had they not transcended that? At what point had the line begun to waver between adversary and hope, between rival and, possibly, a flickering reminder of freedom?
“The same goes for you. Words matter, Ms. Weasley. I would expect you, of all people, to understand this. We do not need any more divides within this school; we are all hurting, but we must move on, and allow others to do the same. Antagonising only divides. Unity is needed more than ever. Consider yourselves warned.”
Familiarity, Draco realises suddenly. After everything, here was something that Potter saw as constant, something that reminded him of a time lost to fear and the unspeakable acts of war. Like the glimpses Draco got of Potter in the hallways — and what did that mean, then?
“I was a failure.”
It was always you falling for me /
“Do you see that?” Draco asks, and points with a perfectly manicured finger up at the sky.
Harry smiles mirthlessly. “Seventeen years, give or take, though I guess the dementors in fifth year helped a bit…”
Potter keeps coming every Saturday night after their first encounter.
“Desperation fuels more than dangerous fuck ups based on pure selfishness,” Harry says. “I learnt this when I watched Snape give up everything for my mother. I learnt this when I watched Mrs. Weasley step up to protect Ginny from Bellatrix. I learnt this when you lied that night in the manor to give us some more time, and when your mother lied to Voldemort’s face in order to make sure you were alive and safe.”
Draco rolls his eyes, the corners of his lips twitching upwards involuntarily. “My mother used to tell me that they were the most pure hearted of souls, radiating their light from heaven to watch over us. That if you ever felt alone — wherever you were — you could always look up and take comfort in their presence. It’s… I mean, it’s kind of childish, now, I suppose, but…”
He strips out of his robes methodically, the awareness of the other sleeping Slytherins a reassuring hum at the back of his mind. It is far from his home, Draco knows, but here there is no Dark Lord, no screams of the unfaithful or the unworthy, no frightened mother casting hunted looks around every corner, and no father whose only aim was to survive, survive, survive.
“You know,” he breathes, and Potter says nothing, but that is all the confirmation that Draco needs.
“How long did that take?” Draco asks, and wonders briefly if he even wants to know the answer.
Another unsung hero, Draco muses, and begins to make his way to the library.
He blinks. Potter looks up, dark circles under his eyes, and offers Draco a ghost of a smile. “Malf-uh, Draco.”
“You weren’t a killer,” Potter repeats, and this time he steps closer, his stance firm. “You wanted something else; you were desperate, but killing him, it wasn’t-”
Potter throws back his head and laughs, sudden and clear, and Draco’s eyes flick to the unmarred line of his exposed throat. He swallows reflexively, his mouth dry.
Draco thinks that, this time, it is enough.
Draco feels Harry’s fingers spasm around his own, the calluses sending shocks of awareness up his arm and throughout his body. It is real in a way that many things have not been, and Draco feels something begin to gradually unravel as he listens.
“Watch as I tried and failed to kill Dumbledore,” Draco finishes for him bitterly, and Potter nods. “And I couldn’t.”
“The stars, yeah. They’re pretty. I guess.”
And yet, despite the fact that Draco’s presence is a given, Potter continues returning to his table every Saturday night, always with a few books, a piece of parchment and some quills and ink to pass the time. Draco decides to leave it be. He refuses to give up his spot — it had taken him so damned long to find a good one, after all — so if Potter wanted to sit across from a previous source of his teenage angst for a few hours a week, then Draco wasn’t going to be the one to begrudge him the opportunity.
He had not really unpacked in the few days he had been home, so it took a quick wave of his wand for everything to be packed back up. He laid his peacoat back overtop- maybe he would stop in at Hogsmead, and he would like something a little warmer to wear than his robes if he did so.
“Well, we need to see if it even is what I remember it being. Then, I suppose, we’ll have to do it tonight, where we can get a bit more space to try it out.” Granger smiled, the first genuine smile in a while. “Ron, help me look through the library.”
“I wish it wasn’t you but I’m trying to work with what I’ve got!” Potter replied, stalking over to Draco. Draco cringed, looked to the side. It almost felt like he couldn’t keep looking at Harry.
Draco opened his mouth to reply, and then stopped. He awkwardly cleared his throat and gave a noncommittal shrug, dropping his eyes to try and break away from that green stare. Sure he didn’t have any real reasons to think about Potter, but to say there were no reasons was a bit far from the truth.
with you making such a racket at someone who is supposedly your best friend-”
A strange thought struck Draco- where was Potter's wand?
Before he could guess anymore, the person stood and turned around. They made eye contact, and at once froze. Harry Potter stared back at Draco, looking like a petrified deer.
“Tell them everything. How you found me. What’s happening now.” Potter said.
“Well, we weren’t expecting to you show, really. It was just a slight chance that you’d try to see what it was.”
Draco didn’t want to make the first move, but he did.
"Just out for a walk." He replied idly, pulling off his coat. His hands came up to his neck to remove his scarf, just to find it not there. He frowned- where could it be? He couldn't even remember the last time he had even seen it. He almost missed what his mother said next, he was so distracted about his scarf.
Suddenly, Potter stopped at a corner. He glanced over his shoulder at Draco. For a moment, Draco was taken aback. He was still tired, still skinny, still had bags under his eyes, but there was a fire in his eyes, wildly stuck up hair, and a slight flush in his cheeks that made him look so alive, so very human.
“Wait, you can?” Potter turned toward him, cocking his head to the side. His bangs swung aside, revealing his scar.
won’t wait three seconds because he got a bit pissy.” Draco griped.
“Hi, sorry to drop in but it’s important.” Mental facepalm, please. Draco braced himself for something bad to happen as Weasley gawked open-mouthed at him. He took his chances, and continued. “Please don’t yell! I have something to tell you. H-Potter needs your help. Please?” Weasley’s face fell into a deep scowl.
By the time he headed down to lunch, Draco had a plan figured out. He would go- all eighth years were allowed free reign of the village on the weekends, so regardless he wouldn’t be doing anything that broke school rules. He just would keep it casual, pretend he was stopping off there for a quick break away from the noise of the village. It wouldn’t be suspicious- everyone went there at some point or another. The last time he had been there was when he was attacked by those wild, random snowballs (somehow, he was convinced Potter had a hand in that too somehow).
"I won't tell anyone." Draco sputtered- Potter looked like he was about to actually send him flying down the rest of the stairs. "That you're here, I mean."
“We can figure it out.” Potter said firmly. Then he quickly looked away. “We’ll just, um, let’s just get going.”
“Fair point.” Potter turned to Draco, finally looking at him fully again. “I should probably go and help Hermione and Ron.”
“I’m here because Harry asked me to be here.” Draco said quickly. “I don’t know where he got this but he gave it to me too.” Speaking of the Boy who Lived Twice, Harry had crossed the room and was perched on the top of one of the trunks at the foot of a bed. His own bed, probably.
Just was he looked around himself at this time, he saw thousands of muggles both loving and hating the stress and the season. It was all very fascinating. A clock on a streetcorner told him that it was getting close to eleven now- he should get back home, as his mother liked having him up early in the mornings, and he was quite nasty when he didn't get enough sleep.
Weasley and Granger sighed, glancing at eachother. Draco could only imagine what unsaid words were exchanged with those looks. Gently, he stood.
“I’m going to try to touch him, just to see what happens.” Granger said, determination leaking across her face. She reached out a hand and… Suddenly it went off to the side. She pulled her hand back, and contrary to what Draco was expecting, her face lit up.
Speaking of Nott, he slipped into the bench across from Draco looking just about as tired (though at this point Draco would be surprised if anyone could be as tired as he was, what with being on three hours of sleep for the last four days).  Theodore Nott was probably not the first thing you’d think of when you thought of a pureblood. He was a kind of lean, tall scrawny boy with black hair almost as messy as Potters, though he towered over everyone else at the table. He has become one of the more athletic people of the house, transforming from the weak weedy boy he used to be, now spending his afternoons going for a run to keep in shape and his nights showing off to the girls of Slytherin.
“Between him telling me to ‘get out.’” Draco replied, raising an eyebrow. “Ask him. He’ll be able to tell you a lot more than I can.”
"Draco? Where were you?" His mother met him at the front door as he stomped dew from his shoes before kicking them off.
Two girls, one after another, were stepping out through the hole behind the portrait. The painting was swung open, but Draco immediately could see how small the window of time they had to slip in was. Potter gestured frantically and leaped through the hole in a very practiced manner.
"Get out." Potter repeated. Now that Draco could somewhat see him (the light was coming from behind his head, which only helped accentuate his awful bedhead) he seemed even smaller and thinner than he had been back at Hogwarts. He couldn't help but stop and gawk for a second. Potter was only wearing a tee-shirt with the pub logo on top of a pocket and some jeans, but they both hung off him like he was a skeleton. The lighting threw the shadows under his eyes into sharp relief, despite the glasses.
The smile that lit up Potter’s face was unexpected to say the least. Draco couldn’t lie and say that didn’t make him want to smile too. He controlled himself as much as he could, but the corner of his mouth still twitched.
The story exploded the next morning. Somehow, Potter was captured in the photograph, despite not being seen by Weasley, Granger, or the reporter. Right there, in the photo, standing right next to the two, but looking backwards over his shoulder at the mark Draco knew was him.
“I need your help. I left because of this. I didn’t—I didn’t want to do this.” The toast was tossed down and he was drinking pumpkin juice instead. “Sure, I always wanted people to recognize me for who I am, not the Boy who Lived, but I didn’t mean to do something this extreme.”
“You don’t have to have him make me stand still.” Potter grumbled, but he stood in the middle of the room, and held his arms out in a ‘well I’m here’ motion.
“So, Harry is here right now, but we can’t see him?” Granger finally said.
But it was nice to see. Kind of. Draco had no clue why he was thinking that. Finally Potter slowed down, slowly walking and looking curiously at the doors. He finally came upon one that he stared at wordlessly. Walking up beside him, Draco realized he could hear faint voices through the door. He couldn’t recognize them, but by the look on Potter’s face, he could. He almost seemed frozen in place, a mixture of excitement and worry dancing across his face.
Potter practically was flying up the stairs, he was moving so quickly from muscle memory. Draco stumbled after him, feet clumsy, trying to keep a hold of the silvery fabric of the invisibility cloak. He saw how the people he passed were giving him strange looks, turning their noses up at him, turning away to whisper about him. It was suffocating. Especially being here, closer to the Gryffindor common room than he had any right to be. Well, that’s what it felt like anyway. He couldn’t call out, couldn’t ask Potter to slow down, he made a promise…
“I can’t.” Draco replied, cool. He gently covered the corner of his scarf that he exposed with the ripped paper. He could look at it properly when he got back to his dorm- he didn’t have to do it in a threatening situation like this. “I promised.”
“Well, I could hear them at the very least.”
Now that he realized more about how bad he had been to Dobby, he wished he could apologize. The house-elf would probably never want to see him again, though.
He checked the clock on the corner, spotting that it was already 11:30. He had taken his time to linger over everything and not rush himself, which clearly paid off in the time that he killed as intended. He took a quick pit stop off at the Three Broomsticks to grab himself a couple bottles of butterbeer, and then he was off. It was a decent walk to the Shrieking Shack, as it was off a side-road that distanced it from the main town, but he took his time. It wasn’t twenty minutes worth of a walk, no matter how slowly you went.
He had to pull himself back as his mind drifted into more silly and useless facts. How did he know this wasn’t a note meant for Weasley and Granger? They were Potter’s friends leagues before Draco would even enter the picture. He was on the edges of enemy territory he was sure, if he had to place himself somewhere.
“Well? Open it!” Oh how the tables have turned. Draco could remember the times he had harassed these two and Potter about his broomstick package. He didn’t say anything, though, and tore open the corner.
“Well, I thought I had the book in my room but I guess I either left it at home…” Granger was muttering. “Oh, it shouldn’t take me too long to find it though. We do have one of the best libraries here!”
“Right you nudged my foot and-”
It's been a while since I've posted anything for this chapter, but I had this one mostly written out and I figured I could at least try to finish it! I'll try to get this finished in the next month or two so I don't leave anyone hanging!
His feet had brought him more into the heart of London. He never really knew where he was going, but just wandered mindlessly. He swiped a hand through his hair, brushing it out of its stiff hairdo he generally donned around his parents. It felt much natural to just be brushed back from his ears and forehead, and at once the last bit of tension drained from his shoulders. He paused to let a group of people pass at a narrow section of the cement, and his eyes drifted up. He was standing next to the door of a small pub, two steps up from the sidewalk. A painted wooden sign hanging from the small overhang told him the name was “Flying Eagle Pub.” The eagle looked more like a dragon to him the longer he stared at it, and he could’ve just sworn it winked at him.
“Why me? Why not Malfoy?” Weasley groaned, but he was already standing up.
help you because I can’t
“He’s there.” Draco pointed to his feet.
“How long-”
“I’m tired.” Draco snapped, huffing a little. He was trying to ignore how his face was getting warm.
“What?”
“Oh damn he’s blocking the door-” Harry spoke over Draco’s shoulder. Heart in his throat, Draco acted without thinking. He pulled the cloak off his head.
Enjoy!
Draco didn’t take much time to really enjoy the atmosphere, though, before he was heading to his dorm-room. Secretly he was hoping there was some kind of message pinned to his scarf, and he didn’t want anyone else to see it if there was one- not that he was expecting Potter to have something to say to him. He wouldn’t say he was surprised if there was even a little something, though.
Potter was standing in the middle of the common room. He looked like he had been struck over the head with nostalgia, so painfully sad was the expression on his face. He looked like he stood out so much, muggle clothes with a plain black cloak pulled over the top, no house colors, nothing. But, Draco noted, he fit into the room so well despite all that. Like he was at home.
“Oh, I have a way to get you in.” Harry hummed quietly, piling his plate full again. “I retrieved it earlier.”
“Well, Malfoy needs some
“Okay, hang on.” Draco pulled his hands back up to his head, rubbing his temples. “Harry said something about this happening because of a
“Where?” A thought dawned on Draco. Weasley and Granger didn’t know where Potter was, and he was their closest link to finding out where he was.
“It’s clear, hurry!” Draco slowly mounted the stairs, trying to steady his own breathing. At the top Potter was bouncing on the balls of his feet.
“But I can touch him without issue.” Draco said, without thinking about it. There was a pause.
"Thanks, mother. No, nothing good from what I can see." He folded the paper up over the face of the Kingsley Shaklebolt (the photo was taken at a conference where he revealed that the last of the stolen wands were returned to their muggle-born owners; Kingsley looked tired, but fiercely happy.) and picked up his own tea. His eyes drifted over to the fire that was keeping him warm. It was cold in this big mansion, drafts curling slowly through the halls. It was also deadly silent, so he often locked himself away in this smaller library, far from his father. He hadn’t quite forgiven him yet for everything he had been a part of.
Wow, it's been a while since I worked on this story. I have returned to writing recently, and it didn't feel good leaving this unfinished. I know I had at least one additional chapter, but that was lost with my last computer. So! This is an all new chapter I wrote up this week. I have been making progress on the following chapter, and predict there to be around 8 chapters + a planned epilogue.
“What are you talking about Malfoy? Why are you here?”
"Thanks." His voice was quiet, but it reached Draco easily. He nodded, and turned hastily on the steps, descending them quickly. He wasn't sure why he had chased Potter exactly, just to leave like this. Something about seeing him looking so miserable made him just want to leave.
with this.” Potter stepped back, grumbling.
“Yeah. Take this.” And he handed a strange cloak to Draco across the table. The fabric flowed over his fingertips like water, and he scrambled to not drop it as his stomach dropped. It was familiar. “This is my invisibility cloak, remember it?”
“I wanted to go to sleep but sure I guess we could hang out.” Draco grumbled.
“How did you know that’s his stuff?”
“Someone… took a photo?” Draco ventured to ask, glancing between the two (and over Granger’s shoulder at Harry who had his empty hands thrown out in front of him). They startled, like they didn’t know he was there. Draco ignored the fact that Granger had her wand trained on him for a few seconds, and the crawl that went down his spine.
He ducked back through the kitchen, apologizing to the chef who he had nearly knocked down before, and back out into the main room. Idly he wondered if anyone noticed- but no one looked when he reentered, so he left it at that. All thoughts of getting alcohol had left him, and he numbly put his coat back on, practically smacking his head on the door as he headed out. Harry freaking Potter was a bartender at a muggle pub? Sure he had thought before about where would be the best place to hide from the wizarding world (primarily Voldemort) but he had never thought of being out in the middle of everything, pretending to just be a normal muggle.
“Yeah I mean I can just-” Draco gestured vaguely and then placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Potter jumped again.
So sorry for the delay with this chapter! I was quite unhappy with it, and still aren't the happiest, but its better then what it was. Thanks for reading!
I promise the next one will be longer-- Please leave any feedback, I'd love to hear it!
“Yeah, well it wouldn’t have to fall on my shoulders if you guys stopped idolizing him too much!” Draco snapped back.
Draco immediately forgot about the letter for his mother that was clutched in his fingers, choosing instead to flee quickly back to his dorm. He tumbled onto the bed and tugged the curtains closed before his brain finally caught up. Was this for him? From Potter? Why and how would it have been there though? His first concern was how close the location was to school. From all his speculation, it seemed like Potter didn’t want to get close to the school right now- so why would he suggest a location close by?
“I almost killed someone,” Draco admits to the still, early morning air. It’s quiet, a rushed confession, like all he had to do was open his mouth for the words to come tumbling out.
“And take him with us? It’s hard enough staying hidden with three people,” comes Granger’s voice, although still worried.
“Oh,” Draco says, standing up but not knowing what else to say. ”Alright.”
Draco stares at it. “A cup? You ditched us and ran off into the woods to look for a
Draco frowned. “You were excellent in sixth year, though. Slughorn loved you.”
himself.”
The two of them went silent after that, and the only noise coming from Potter’s table was the steady
Draco tries to open his mouth, tries to tell him to sod off, that he’s fine, that he isn’t crying, but all that comes out is a choked gasp for air, his heart still pounding, the sheets suddenly tangled up too tight around his torso. He tries again, letting out another hiccuping gasp.
“He looks like he’s been tortured,” notes Potter, still speaking in a hushed voice. He comes up next to Draco, where he’s crouched ungracefully next to the bush. “Draco?” he asks softly. “Are you feeling better now?”
“You like rain and floods,” Harry remembers. “Is that why?”
No way. Oh, there was
They find him four miles west of Malfoy Manor, curled up on the ground. It’s mid December, the ground has frozen solid underneath him, and if he concentrates, he can make himself as still as the ground, encased in ice, preserved. He can lie here all winter and be safe until the spring, come out brand new.
Does he feel anything? He feels the soft brush of Harry’s fingertips over his palm, his steady gaze on Draco’s face, a shiver running through him that has nothing to do with the cup. “No,” he lies. He’s a liar, he’s a coward. He’s always been these things and he always will be.
is going on,” he shrieked, starting to rub his eyes and freezing at the sight of the yellow goo covering his fingers. “It smells like a swamp in here!”
“It wouldn’t?” Potter asked, softly, after a very heavy pause. “I thought. Well, to be frank, Draco, I thought you hated my guts. I thought you… Well, I thought you wanted me dead. Until…” He trailed off, suddenly looking resolutely at the ground in front of them. He didn’t need to finish his sentence; Draco could hear the unspoken words: until you saved me at Malfoy Manor, Potter was going to say.
he scrawled on the piece of parchment he was holding,
There’s high, cruel laughter from somewhere in front of him, but he can’t bring himself to look up. “Go on Draco,” the voice croons, “prove your loyalty to me.”
“What the hell,” Draco whispered, as he walked towards his bed, trampling a load of flowers in his wake, but they seemed unharmed. He set Potter’s cloak down and brushed a hand over the petals; they came away smelling like he dipped them into his mother’s perfume - a scent he usually enjoyed but was now enough to almost make him feel sick-
Hearing Potter say his first name made his stomach do weird things, like the two of them were
“You’ve got some Stinksap on your face, did you know?” asked Potter, and stepped back with a quick swipe of his sleeve across Draco’s cheek. Ah, yes. Draco felt the side of his face immediately start to get warm where Potter had wiped the Stinksap away, and he reached up to touch it. Was Stinksap poisonous? Did it leave a rash? He didn’t remember Professor Sprout saying anything about that, but for all he knew, Goyle accidentally cursed the plant before spewing its sap everywhere. He would have to remember to ask Professor Sprout the next time he saw her. He turned around to walk to his desk and stumbled into the corner of the cabinet.
Inside was a gold clasp for his cloak, in the shape of a snake curled into an infinity sign, and roughly the size of his thumb. As he watched, it swirled and writhed, occasionally flicking its tail or flicking its miniature forked tongue. “I love it,” he said, and he truly did. She waved again, dismissively, as he pinned it carefully to his cloak.
“They’re loud,” he manages to get out, struggling to keep his breathing even. This is stupid, he knows, for a Malfoy to be so uncomposed, unheard of, but Potter doesn’t seem to care. “They’re all I can hear.”
or maybe
“You,” Draco agrees, watching him scramble backwards, through the tent flap, and out of sight.
and tapped the plate smartly with his wand. Nothing happened. The cookies didn’t move. Alright, so not poisoned, then. The house elves must have brought him a plate; they could actually be highly intuitive sometimes, and maybe Dobby had told them about his favorite before… well…
His father used to insist on it, when Draco used to be afraid of the jolting cracks of thunder and the sharp, lively, flares of lightning. His mother would wave her wand and mutter some spell that sounded intricate and complex to him when he was younger, and suddenly, the dark and cold night wasn’t so frightening. Still, he’d find refuge inside his bedroom, tucked away beneath his sheets and a cup of cocoa that an equally frightened house elf would bring him, listening to the rain as though it was storming five miles away, and fall asleep to the low crackling of the logs in the fireplace.
It wasn’t addressed to Harry’s aunt, though.
“He saved my life,” Potter says, quietly like he’s hoping Draco won’t hear. “At least for a little while. We have to.”
though. But that’s… that’s fine.”
“I know,” Draco interrupts him. He doesn’t get up and go inside, just yet, but neither of them say anything else until he does.
, ended up sprawled on his arse. “It should keep the cold from coming back. You should get inside.”
his head dizzy but not from the pain, not from the dreams, not from the memories, just full of Harry. He’s so relieved he wants to laugh, his knees are halfway to giving out from a kiss that’s lasted all of five seconds long.
Harry was standing outside the Owlery when Draco found him. “No, go on,” he was saying to Dean Thomas, who was waiting down the hall for Harry, who was rummaging around in the pockets of his robes. Draco waited for Dean to turn the corner and disappear from view, before approaching.
“Oh no,” she says, already sprinting outside. “Harry! Harry are you there?”
That got his attention. Potter frowned. “You can’t copy off me, you know. These are supposed to be different for each of us.”
“Still,” Granger insists, walking away and coming back, walking away and coming back. She’s muttering something under her breath - spells, Draco recognizes, through the murky fog of thoughts. “There’s no one here,” she confirms after a few minutes, voice tense but already more relieved.
Hogwarts had outdone itself, surely, this year. The Great Hall was lined with evergreen trees so tall that they seemed to disappear into the enchanted sky, which was softly flurrying. The teachers had donned their Christmas best, and the tables, which had been pushed together in the center of the hall, were heaped with so many glistening gold decorations that it was hard to see the enormous platters of food around them. The two of them took a tentative seat between two Ravenclaws, and Pansy began piling food on her plate with admirable gusto. “What?” she asked around a mouthful of bacon. “I’ve been working my buttocks off the last month so I wouldn’t get shipped off to Richard Rimble's tutoring lessons. I’m hungry.”
Christmas morning dawned bright on Hogwarts, and the people who had stayed behind seemed uncharacteristically cheerful. It made sense when Draco thought about it, since the months after the war had been gloomy and depressing, to say the least. Obituaries had filled
“If we have to,” Weasley agrees, and then there’s a terrible feeling, like he’s being compressed into two dimensions, he’s Apparating, he realizes, before the pressure suddenly releases and the churning in his stomach reaches a crescendo and he turns to the side and promptly empties the contents of his stomach into a nearby bush.
Pansy grimaced. “I’m sorry Draco, I can’t,” she said, and she really did sound sorry about it. “I have to finish Binns’ stupid essay about the Mer-Revolution of 1490.” She gestured at her own piece of parchment, where about half was filled with her neat cursive writing. “I need another foot of parchment after this, too.”
That seemed like a lifetime ago. Draco found himself in front of the Astronomy tower, and started climbing the steps up to the top. The storm was raging louder than ever here - he could see the rain pelting the castle through the windows. He could smell it here, too, that rich, earthy, metallic scent that reminded him of lazy days at home, napping in front of the fire and drinking hot chocolate from earthen mugs, strolls with his mother down Diagon Alley, before everything got complicated. If the storm quieted down by just a touch, he’d be perfectly content to curl up with a cushion and a blanket, and pass out here on top of the tower.
of thunder echoed through the room. Pansy seemed unbothered like always, and the two second-years sitting next to the fire were so heavily bundled up in their dressing gowns, robes, and hats, that Draco doubted that even a banshee’s wail would’ve pierced their ears. Whoever spelled that rain was going to have hell to pay.
Draco lets out a sigh of relief and lowers his wand. “Potter,” he says, trying, and judging by Potter’s expression,
“Oh shove off,” he said angrily, picking up a quill and splattering ink across his paper by accident, of course. Pansy looked up at him from where she was sitting near the window, and frowned.
“No doubt about it,” Harry murmurs against his lips, before pulling him back again.
cried Potter, and Peeves’ laughter turned into a panicked, gurgling, choking noise before he zoomed away.
Potter laughed, suddenly and unexpectedly, the sound echoing through the stone corridor, and Draco was taken aback by how much he liked the sound; he rather expected Potter to sound like a toad when he laughed, yes, a toad, to match his
. “What are you, uh, working on?” He had no idea why he was trying to make conversation, really, but suddenly, the idea of returning to his common room alone was entirely unappealing. It was much nicer here in the library, really, where the lamps had dimmed to a soft amber glow and it was warm and smelled nicely of cracked leather. Potter made a good study partner too, not that they were studying together at all, but Draco found that he enjoyed someone else’s presence near him, just staying quiet as he worked. Pansy was smart and organized, but she kept interrupting their study sessions with some jibe or another, or even just letting out loud exclamations out of frustration.
And then he froze.
Potter’s eyes roam his face over the rim of his cup, searching, searching. His expression stays carefully neutral. He shrugs. “You deserve to be spoiled sometimes,” he says, taking another sip, not looking Draco in the eyes.
indeed a very rare occasion. That didn’t stop him from wanting to reach across and smack that stupid expression off of Potter’s face, though. He ought to close his mouth - he looked like a frog, gaping at him like that. He sent a scowl back in Potter’s direction, hoping that it correctly conveyed his feelings of
When he looked up again, Potter was looking at him with the strangest expression on his face -  not quite smug, almost pitying, but mostly just a little sad.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Potter said at once, and with a muttered spell and a wave of his wand, Draco felt a welcome rush of warmth spread through his body, until the tips of his ears down to his toes were tingling nicely. “You’re still wet, though,” he noted, and with a soft rustling noise, pulled off one of his three cloaks, and handed it to Draco, who begrudgingly admitted that maybe three cloaks were not so unnecessary after all. “Here,” he said, pulling Draco to his feet after he had, once
Potter blinked at him. “Slughorn’s- oh, yes. I mean, some of it was pretty basic stuff, but then there was one thing- well, er, Hermione helped me figure that out pretty quick. You know how she is.”
“Are you kidding me,” said Pansy at breakfast the next morning, slamming closed her copy of
“Draco!” Pansy swatted his arm with
“So why’d you run off, then,” Draco says, motioning for Potter to sit next to him. He does. “If it was storming so bad, why couldn’t you wait?”
“Looking for something?”
is undoubtedly the most comprehensive,” she said, not looking up from where she was rummaging around in her book bag for something, “given that it has the most in-depth section on Amortentia I’ve seen so far.” Draco saw Weasley and Potter lurking around the corner, clearly trying (and failing) to act like they weren’t watching the whole thing, probably waiting to see if Granger needed saving, as if he was about to hex her or something. He wondered why they were bothering; out of the three of them, Granger was absolutely the most terrifying.
Draco goes quiet, listening to the soft thrum of rain hitting the ground outside. It’s spring, the wildflowers coming into bloom cautiously, the winter frost giving way to dew. “That’s one reason,” he admits, pulling Harry closer.
“I’m not in pain,” Draco says, but he takes a sip of the tea anyway. It’s not as strong as he usually takes it, but it’s warm and on the right end of too sweet, and he realizes that his entire body has been shivering slightly from the cold.
he murmurs once he’s outside, pointing the wand at the tent. He doesn’t want to hear any of it either, not after last time.
“Tell me about something,” Potter says, sounding a little less far away now. “What’s your favorite food?”
“Not much,” he admits. “Really I just figured that you guys were on the run because the entirety of the Ministry and You-Know-Who’s army wanted to kill you all. Rather like myself,” he adds as an afterthought.
“Yeah, and then I got tortured to the brink of death for it.”
“You can’t blame me,” Draco huffs, feeling rather put off by Potter’s smug tone. Really, it’s dark and there are untrustworthy people running about, and Granger and Weasley left him out here with the shittiest wand he’s ever used. “It’s dark and we didn’t know where you were,” he says finally, stowing his wand back in his robes.
Malfoy Manor wasn’t warded against storms.
All in all, it wasn’t entirely his fault that he was late to Potions again. Double Potions, with the Gryffindors no less, as if an extra-long lesson stuffed in the dungeons breathing in cauldron fumes wasn’t bad enough. He supposed that it wasn’t so bad with the Gryffindors anymore, not after the war. Most of them had stopped throwing him murderous glares in the hallway, and he hadn’t had someone try to slip a Hair Removing Solution into his pumpkin juice in quite some time. Things were more important, as everyone seemed to realize, than hating on Slytherin house.
excessive, but Potter was often very unnecessary like that. His hair was also unnecessarily tousled and his face unnecessarily flushed with the cold, but he didn’t seem to notice. On the contrary, he was beaming down at Draco, who was still sitting on his arse on the freezing cold ground like an idiot, like he was the one person whom Potter wanted to see the most.
“You will be once the sleeping potion wears off,” Weasley replies, draining his own cup in a few gulps.
This, for one, is true. Draco looks down at the expanse of forest, at the unassuming gold cup laid out in front of him, and feels pure fear tug at his heart.
“I figured,” he says. “Can you walk?”
“Ah, fuck me,” he groaned aloud to his empty dormitory as he threw the door open, fully ready to collapse on his bed and pray to Merlin that this was all a dream,
Potter laughs gently. “Me too,” he says, “the best thing I’ve ever had.” He takes in another breath and Draco can feel his fingers clutching embarrassingly tight at the material of his jumper. He goes to pull it away, a halfhearted twitch of his palm, but Potter tightens his grasp. “It’s okay,” he says, voice gone soft. “Breathe. Keep going.”
“Nothing,” Potter said, much too quickly. He covered his parchment with one arm. “Erm, nothing that’s important. Just writing a letter. To my aunt and uncle. Wishing them a merry Christmas and all.”
came zooming around the corner and hit him squarely in the side of the head, and he nearly fell over with a soft grunt.
“He’s not there,” Granger says, poking her head back into the tent. Her voice has gone high with panic. “Should I take the wards down so we can go bring him back?”
Draco scoffs and looks away. “You don’t wake up screaming,” he says. It’s the first time either of them bring it up, much less in the open, not tucked away in the back room of the tent on a rickety bunk bed. “You don’t throw up like I do.”
“Malfoy?” asked Potter, frowning and waving a hand in front of his face. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
His father’s hands push at his back, urging him forward, but his nails dig into his shoulder, like he’s trying to hold him back. “Go on,” his father repeats, despite the crack in his voice.
“Basil,” muttered Draco to himself, pushing back the jars of dried herbs. He needed one sprig of fresh basil, which was nowhere to be found. “Where’s the damn basil?” He turned around, intending to inform Slughorn that they were out, and found Potter’s face barely five inches away from his own. “What-”
. “I got my entire middle paragraph on the Mer-Revolution wrong. The position of High Chieftain was created
Potter raised his eyebrows and stared at him, confused, and then reached into the pocket of his sweater and pulled out two pieces of bright orange foam. “Earplugs,” Potter said, squishing one between his fingers. “A muggle invention but they’re pretty neat, you just shove it in your ears and everything gets quieter.”
The morning after they find him, Draco wakes up in an unfamiliar bed, rickety and low on the ground, but the sheets are worn soft and comfortable. The walls are so transparent that morning light is leaking through them - a tent, he realizes, he’s in a tent - and it smells like pine and fresh air. Weasley’s standing in the corner, busying himself in what looks to be a kitchen of sorts, or maybe a living room. It’s comfortable in here, spacious but cramped in the cozy sort of way that the Manor never was.
“Well,
“Is that so,” Draco whispers back, and then they’re kissing, Harry’s hand coming up against his jaw and his throat, the other in his hair, the rim of his glasses getting pushed up uncomfortably against Draco’s cheek, but he couldn’t care less. The heady rush of it is a relief, his heart slowing and speeding up on the offbeat like it’s saying
“Oh no, Draco,” Potter said, clearly resisting the urge to laugh. “I’m sorry, you must be freezing.”
“All right, Draco?” Blaise snickered at him from where he was sitting a few feet away, clearly having had noticed who he was looking at.
Instantly, he’s on his feet, wand out. He undoes the
out here?” Draco says, somewhat incredulously. “Is there where you all ran off to?”
Harry doesn’t call him out on his ridiculous question though. Instead, he picks up the cup gently by what used to be an intricately carved handle, and presses it softly to Draco’s palm. He flinches away, expecting the pressure, the voices, the pain, but nothing comes. It’s cold, dead, lifeless, pathetic. “Do you feel anything?”
Pansy retired after dinner, claiming that she was too full after the pudding to do anything but lie in bed and groan to anyone who would listen about how full she was. He had already walked her to the common room and was now wandering aimlessly around the courtyard, reveling in the crisp, cold air and the way it made the tip of his nose turn a bright red. Draco had to admit that the food was nice, albeit nowhere near the same as a proper dinner at home, and wondered briefly whether he should send an owl to his mum, wishing her a merry Christmas.
, read the heading, and with a sudden bittersweet feeling, realized that the letter was from his mum. He hadn’t heard from her since the beginning of the school year three months ago, which was highly unusual, but he couldn’t say that it was unexpected. The Ministry had put a watch on the Manor, probably to make sure that his parents weren’t hiding any more Dark Lords in their basement, but that meant that all of their correspondence was being tracked and his mum couldn’t so much as send him a parcel of mince pies for Christmas without a team of Aurors knowing every ingredient she used to make them.
scary. His father would bring home associates and acquaintances who wore strange masks and conjured strange spells in their living room, and his mother would tell him urgently to go to his bedroom, warding the door from the outside when she didn’t think he could hear her. But stormy nights were suddenly the safe nights, the nights when no one dared to Floo into their house in case the lightning struck down the chimney, and no one dared to Apparate in case they got blown off course. They all knew that Lucius could have put up a ward with no trouble, that it didn’t take a particularly skilled caster, not when the rest of the Manor was so heavily guarded against everything else. But they didn’t mention it, they quickly changed the subject when his aunt Bellatrix brought it up with a suspicious sneer, and moved on.
“She does that often.” Weasley muttered awkwardly.
"Oh. Yes, mother." He had completely forgotten- he had told his mother he would not be attending the family dinner this year, and instead wanted to return to Hogwarts. Everything had been arranged with Headmistress McGonagall and Professor Slughorn. He would be flooing back at 10:00AM so he could enjoy his day there, but still have Christmas breakfast with his parents. "Thank you for the reminder. I lost track of time." He kissed her cheek goodnight, and made his way through the maze of halls back to his room. How he used to get lost in these rooms for hours at a time. His parents never noticed, and it was always Dobby who would find him for meals.
“Why did you plant the message? I most likely wouldn’t have found it.”
Draco thought maybe he’d stop by and light a candle while he was in town. He stood up from the table, leaving half of his lunch just as he had left half of his breakfast, turning and heading out of the doors and towards the owelry. He had to finally send this letter off to his mother- Draco couldn’t help but think his head would explode if he went much longer without caffeine.
"Get out." He was roughly righted on his feet, and he had to grab the arm-rail to keep from toppling backwards again. Potter's arms, now that he wasn't holding Draco up with his magic, wrapped around his sternum and stomach protectively.
Draco slipped away onto the frost-covered lawn of the home soon after dinner. There was still a couple days to the new year, and though he appreciated spending time with his mother, he needed time alone. The eighth year students were allowed to go anywhere as long as they passed their apparition test, so Draco knew exactly where he wanted to go. Making sure he looked as muggle as possible with a peacoat instead of robes, he turned quickly on the spot and zipped away.
“Dumbledore’s wand?” Potter nodded.
“Malfoy if you snuck your way in here to just insult us-”
“Oh, my scarf!” Gently Draco ran the fingers of one hand over the familiar knit. So that’s where it had been! It clicked- he had left it at the bar when he chased after Potter, and forgot to pick it up on his way out.
“-will that take?” Potter and Draco exchanged glances but Harry dropped his gaze quickly. Draco had to resist saying ‘jinx’ so hard.
Draco willed his legs to move, and slowly, they did. He passed Potter, determinedly looking forward only, crouching at the bottom step of the memorial and fished around his bag for the candle he had bought earlier with his other purchases. Taking out his wand, he lit it with a small flame. He still kneeled there, watching the flame. He was very aware of prickling at the back of his neck, eyes watching his movement.
"I won't tell anyone." Draco repeated, shifting a little where he stood between two steps. "You obviously want to get away from the wizarding world. I wouldn't-" he cleared his throat, "Now I wouldn't do that."
He found himself a dark corner, turned, and apparated home.
“Hang on. Have Harry stand still for a second.”
Draco Malfoy just sighed and turned the page of the paper, not even bothering to finish reading the article. They had been repeating the same thing over and over since his disappearance, and they would keep repeating it until they got more than just the assurance from Weasley and Granger that he was still alive. Still, he couldn't help but find it impressive that he's managed to stay hidden for so long from a whole wizarding world looking for him. He could just be in the muggle world, but--
The students give him a wide berth. Not just him, though; the Slytherins, in general, are avoided like the plague and whispered about in the corridors, whether that be in disdain or fear or disbelief that they all actually had the nerve to show their “despicable, no-good” faces back at Hogwarts. Draco likes to think that it was because they all wished to redeem themselves, but realistically he knows that it was a matter of pride more than anything else.
“You could stay.”
Blink back to let me know /
“What if I do? I could be a prefect, for all you know.”
Harry snorts. “We haven’t even pulled out the firewhisky, and you’re already getting philosophical on me?”
“That bit was reasonable, considering the situation,” Draco interrupts, and Harry shakes his head.
Draco snaps out of his reverie, and a bolt of ‘no, no, absolutely not’ flashes down his spine, leaving him dazed because this was not how things were meant to go, but he couldn’t just let Potter get the upper-hand, that was unacceptable. “Harry Potter, sneaking through the hallways at night. What would dear McGonagall think of such a rule breaker, I wonder?”
It isn’t just the library where Draco sees him, either; it was like the dam had broken, and now every way he turns there are flashes of dark hair and green eyes. It infuriates him, but, oddly, Draco welcomes the familiarity.
“Harry,” Draco returns with a nod, the syllables foreign as they trip off of his tongue. “My table…” He gestures, and Potter flushes slightly.
“No,” he responds honestly, and it surprises him how easily the words spill from his lips. “My father hired tutors. He… cared for me, but had no time. The Ministry was unstable, and there was a massive influx of cases back then.”
Draco internally curses the impatience of Gryffindors as he reaches to grip Potter’s wrist. They still, and Potter stares, confused. Distantly, Draco wonders if his eyes were always so… green.
Blink back to let me know
Draco remembers back to his childhood: toy broomsticks and snitches and moving portraits and endless amounts of Quidditch games. He had been safe, loved — for a few years, at least — and despite what had followed, Draco had known what it was like to be free.
Weasley nods, eyes glistening, and as the crowd disperses Draco catches a glimpse of the shadow that falls over McGonagall’s face before she turns; she is old, and tired, but still determined and unmoving in the face of adversity. He is reminded, then, that this was once her mentor’s school to head before he had died, that McGonagall had loved and lost over the course of her life and was still ready to do her duty as a headmistress. And do it well, apparently.
Harry reaches out and intertwines their fingers. He squeezes them, just once, and Draco holds on. And perhaps, this time, it is enough.
“I never actually apologised for that,” he says wryly, and Draco softens enough to sit up and cup Harry’s face with both hands, meeting his eyes squarely.
Potter’s stare is assessing now, and it takes Draco a moment, but then:
I'm a fly that's trapped in a web /
They were all from fucked up families, were all trained to be monsters for a bigger cause or, at least, to stay neutral when given the choice amidst the desperate bid for power. But underneath that they were still kids, children with blood and bones and skin that could tear like any other no matter what side they stood on.
No person in their right mind would go and study on a Saturday, Draco thinks. Especially in the library.
Harry Potter is hailed as a hero, the ‘chosen’ saviour; Hermione Granger as the smartest witch of their generation; Ron Weasley as the bravest wizard. ‘The Golden Trio’ is what they’re dubbed as — set to lead the magical population into a new era — and Draco thinks, privately, that it’s a heavy burden to place upon three war-torn teenagers. A small, bitter part of him scoffs at the fact that it would be perfect, golden boy Harry Potter that would earn such a role, but Draco shoves the thought firmly aside.
“The invisibility cloak,” Potter explains, and Draco is numb, numb, wants to cover his ears and block out everything, wants to leave and never look back. “I… we came back, Dumbledore and I, and he put me under a spell. I couldn’t move. All I could do was watch-“
“… and you’re not even listening to me, you prat, why do I even bother?”
“I’m here,” Potter — no, Harry, Harry tells him. “I’m right here.”
“If this is your fumbling attempt at conversation, Harry, then please send my sincerest condolences to Weasley and Granger,” he drawls in response, and it’s automatic, at this point, to feel the rush of exhilaration that follows.
Potter turns, wand drawn, and Draco rolls his eyes as he approaches and leans against the window ledge beside him. His mind catalogues the short distance left between them, the light that plays across Potter’s face and illuminates his profile just so, the gentle swell to his lips as he moves them…
He feels the rush of blood in his veins, the fiery bitterness a stark contrast to the frigid air against his skin. He had not confessed this to anyone, never let the words escape from the tight coil deep within his stomach, because what was the point before now? What was the point — and yet he had yearned for it, yearned for a place to simply be, and say, and receive nothing but honest acceptance in return. Where once there was a curl of a lip and a swish of robes, there now was a hand, steady and grounding in its strength and Draco wonders, just for a moment, if it is the chill or something else causing his heart to constrict in his chest.
“I hated you,” Harry tells him, and Draco raises an eyebrow, amused.
“I liked getting under your skin,” Draco admits quietly, and Harry’s eyes are inexplicably fond as he leans into his space.
Lonely, lonely little life /
“Look, I’ll just…“ Potter mutters, and moves to begin collecting his things, his skin now red down to his neck and disappearing into his robes after the pause had continued to drag.
The reason for such uncertainty dangles in the air between them, unspoken but suffocating as it weighs down the ensuing silence. Draco hears the clock on the wall tick down the hour. He counts — 1, 2, 3, 4 — and then Potter hums noncommittally, nods, and the pressure eases. The rest of their time is filled with the scratching of quills on parchment and something that verges on companionship.
“You’re not meant to be here.”
“If you mention the cursing incident again-“
You are taking me apart like bad glue /
He clears his throat, withdrawing his hand hurriedly. “I was taught this writing style when I was young. My father” —the word is acidic on Draco’s tongue—“was insistent on proper penmanship.”
Astoria scowls but inclines her head in assent, and McGonagall rounds on Ginny Weasley.
“But it does,” Draco insists urgently. “It matters, because we were so blinded by it; don’t you see? Our desperation for power, for survival, for fame, and recognition, and everything else — it wasn’t a coincidence that most of us were Slytherins, Harry, because ambition is dangerous when you have a fuel like that.”
Potter leans forward, and a lock of dark hair travels from behind his ear to land on his cheek. Draco resists the urge to reach up and fix it, tries focusing on the curve of Potter’s jaw or the line of his nose instead, but finds himself equally distracted. “Did your father teach you?”
Headmistress McGonagall, although strict, could always be counted on to be fair. After setting aside all of his pre-conceived house prejudices (albeit reluctantly), Draco admits to himself that he admires her, in a way — certainly more than he did Dumbledore, anyhow.
I could kid myself in thinking that I'm fine.
A bridge, Draco reflects later. An olive branch, extended to begin paving the way down a delicate, untrodden path. There is potential; for what, Draco is unsure of, but it is pure, and bright, and for that Draco will cup it in his hands and treasure it for however long it lasts.
Potter’s cheeks grow scarlet, his eyes avoiding Draco’s gaze and flitting around the room. “That’s not what I meant, not at all. I just — it’s still neat and, I mean, it’s – it’s been a while…”
“And you think bravery isn’t dangerous?” Harry questions, and there is an undercurrent of resentment there, of loss, and Draco cannot bring himself to look over at his face. “Do you think intelligence, or loyalty, or any human emotion isn’t dangerous when fuelled by desperation? It’s not clear-cut like what the houses make you believe it to be, Draco, and I learnt that the moment Peter Pettigrew was revealed as a traitor to my parents because he was desperate, the moment Sirius broke out of Azkaban to kill him because he was desperate. The moment Dumbledore sent a child out to war because he thought there was no other choice, even.”
It starts like this: they’re all sent back for their eighth year after everything is over. Hogwarts is still in the process of picking up the pieces — so is everything and everyone, really — but the Ministry and the school board decide that there should be a modicum of normalcy within the chaos.
He gets a shove in reply, and jabs his elbow into Draco’s ribs in retaliation — which, of course, results in a kick to his shin and… well. It’s a short-lived wrestling match, and when they’re finally left panting next to each other, gazing upwards in companionable silence from the astronomy tower floor, Draco repeats: “Do you see that?”
“Sixth year,” Harry says, and Draco sighs, exasperated.
His hands curl into fists; he is shaking, has to stop and choke back the scream of frustration that threatens to escape from the writhing mass inside his stomach.
“Your handwriting is still the same,” Potter remarks after four weeks had past, and Draco almost drops his quill.
He’s in the library, and it’s a Saturday night.
And then Draco feels the press of lips against his, soft, gentle, on the edge of too dry, with their hands still intertwined between them as he tilts his head and moves to better the angle. Draco tastes the lingering traces of chocolate on Harry’s lips, tastes the freshness of the air around them and something familiar, something innately human and Harry. The kiss is slow, curious, fragile in the stillness of the night, and Draco feels his heart unfurl and send spiralling waves of warmth throughout his body.
And Draco believes.
Just a king, and a rusty throne /
Now there's always time calling for me /
It takes only three weeks for Draco’s fragile peace to be interrupted.
“You say that like you have the right to be up here,” Potter accuses, and Draco smirks.
But I'm thinking that my spider's dead /
It isn’t perfect, isn’t Earth-shattering — but it is them, is theirs, is another step in something they are building together. It is safety, and solace, the beginnings of peace, of home, and Draco…
Potter hesitates, and Draco looks away uncomfortably. “It’s- I’ll just be studying, anyhow, it doesn’t really matter-“
Which is why, when Draco shuffles in, bleary-eyed with his bag slung across his shoulder, it takes him a moment to register that Potter is sitting at his usual table. Studying. In the Hogwarts library. On a Saturday night.
to get there to explain that but
Draco was starting to have an appreciation for the muggle world. Without magic, they’ve somehow managed to make up for all their shortcomings with inventions. He had scorned them as lower before, but now he could see how amazing some of the things they did were. A car zipped past him, and he watched its glowing brake lights fade down the street. He would still stick with what he knew, and the power of his own two legs, but they really were quite genius. Not that he would admit any of this to any of his fellow wizards- but he almost found a kind of comfort being around people who didn’t know who he was.
“Shut up, all of you!” Draco snapped. “Potter if you don’t stop yelling I
