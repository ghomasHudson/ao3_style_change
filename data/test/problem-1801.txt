She had been overly concerned about why Draco had left in such a hurry and what horrible thing Harry must’ve done to him in order for him to leave with such a gloomy expression.
“You like me?” Potter eventually said, after a long pause. “I’m sure I made myself very clear, Potter.” Draco jeered, but his voice didn’t hold any animosity only a slight tremble of nervousness.
“You have no idea. I mean they are two of the bravest people I’ve ever met, and I would never trade them in for anyone else, but my god…!” Hermione threw her hands up.
He looked back to see Potter groaning as he had taken a direct hit. Draco staggered back on his feet trying to deflect the curses, but he was a split second too late. He felt another curse hit him straight on, and he fell back down once again.
“If there’s something I can do to help you, then I won’t hesitate you know.” Harry said, as he leaned in and kissed him. “Also, I love you, so I might just allow you to take advantage of me whenever you like.” He gave Draco a lopsided grin.
“Yes… Oh God… please.” It didn’t feel like he was himself anymore, the look of lust in Harry’s eyes was making him shiver uncontrollably, and he couldn’t help the strong desire of wanting to both feel and satisfy the man in front of him.
“That’s asking a bit too much.” Draco huffed, unable to hide a small smile tugging at his lips when Harry laughed loudly.
Harry could feel a heavy lump in his stomach start to form at the realisation. Draco had been completely reliant on him for quite some time now and had changed from a constant expression of stress and tiredness into a more cheerful one.
“As if that mud-“ The words were already spilling before Draco could properly process what he was saying. One might blame it on the panic he was going through, but he should’ve known better by now. Draco knew it was wrong, and he knew that him saying it was even worse, neither did he actually care too much about blood purity these days, as it no longer held the same prestige. He was also well aware of Granger’s talents and considering he himself enjoyed intelligent conversations, the situation between the two might’ve turned out very differently had they just been kids unaware of the power balance put between them by parent’s and society.
After dinner they gathered around the fireplace and the Christmas tree that was protecting the little bunch of presents underneath it.
“I… actually think they’re decent…” Draco said in a low voice, having difficulties with actually expressing such a horrid opinion. By Merlin, how bad that team was. But oh well… Ron was the worst one to deal with, so the only thing he could do was lean into the awful idea of the Chudley Cannons actually being somewhat good.
After the both of them had been reading for about two hours, Granger decided to break the silence. “Looks like there’s little chance of finding a potion that can actually redo the effect.” She sighed while rubbing her temples.
“Well… one of our family friends were hosting a big dinner party, but half of the desserts had somehow ended up splattered over the parking lot, so they gave me a call pleading for help” Harry started going towards one of the big windows looking out at the small city, that had fewer people standing around.
“Huh? Um…” Draco got a bit taken aback by the fact that he hadn’t ordered it. “Oh! Don’t worry it’s on the house. It’s a new recipe I’ve been working on, so I just like to get the customers opinions” The guy smiled at him.
Draco stood across from Granger. It was strange to be duelling her of all people. He hadn’t really experienced her duelling style before.
He was a coward… He had always been one. Unable to ever express what he truly felt and fearing rejection more than anything. Yet he had chosen to do something so drastic and stupid. He had probably deserved the surprised look on Harry’s face, and the stuttering of words that left his mouth after.
It had been easy when it was just sitting there watching a movie and drinking tea, but once the movie was over, Draco felt himself become a bit more rigid. He had no idea what he was supposed to do. How he should act.
“What if she actually doesn’t figure out a solution?” Draco tried sounding unbothered, but it was difficult to conceal the worry in his voice at the unlikely but potential scenario that Granger didn’t find a solution.
“You and Harry.” Luna said before her eyes widen slightly. “Oh, was that supposed to be a secret? I’m so sorry, Draco?” It felt odd hearing his first name spoken so lightly by someone not in his group of friends.
“What is?” Potter tilted his head slightly upwards to look him in the eyes curiously, and it was almost too much of a view for Draco to keep his composure. Having Potter sitting down in front of him, made it seem so easy to take control and let go of his restraints, but somehow despite Potter’s calm and peaceful demeanour, there was just this feeling of not knowing you wouldn’t be in control if you started something. Draco didn’t know if it was because of Potter’s magic and how it constantly seemed to exude this powerful aura around him, or if Potter himself just had that effect on people these days.
“Alright, fine. I’ll admit to it. I can’t take this anymore, Potter. You’ve provoked me more than enough. Now why don’t you fucking kiss me already?” Draco hissed.
Draco quickly glanced over to check if Potter had awoken from the commotion. He blinked twice as he looked straight into a wall.
Potter, on the other hand, looked nonplussed as he smiled and stepped forward. Weasley trailing behind him cautiously, disbelief openly plastered on his face.
“Lucky for you I’ve got access to the potion classroom.” Granger looked overly satisfied with the wide-eyed look she received from Draco. “How?”
The last weeks had made Draco’s world spin more than once. Harry was being strangely intimate at times, and Draco was too flustered to react with any sort of grace. He couldn’t remember ever having turned red so many times before because of one person.
“Fuck.” He murmured. “You’re so tight, it’s amazing.” He groaned in pleasure. The thrusting became rhythmic and faster, Draco felt himself tighten even more at the thought that Harry was feeling the pleasure as well from thrusting into him.
“You tell him! I’m a good keeper you know!” Weasley was still hung up on the taunt and seemed to have taken massive offense from it.
The only thing that kept Draco going for the remainder of the day was the thought of the absolute riot he would cause once all the customers were out the door. Pansy was not getting off easy on this one, he thought grudgingly.
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled warmly, and Draco still felt an odd sensation at having Harry direct such kind and loving expressions his way. It had always been sneers and glares back when they were still students.
“Yes, absolutely! I’ll get to it first thing in the morning!” Granger said, and Draco knew she wasn’t lying about that. Of course, she would be all over this issue until she found a way to fix it. It was ingrained in her to always figure out solutions after all. “However…” her voice sounded a bit more hesitant now as she was addressing Draco. “It would really help if I knew what lead up to this moment.”
“Why are you here, Potter?” Draco huffed, trying to busy himself with stocking ingredients on the shelfs. God, why did Potter of all people have to come waltzing into his shop? It made no sense.
“We thought about it, but she would be furious about it since it’s a homemade potion gone wrong. Hermione is trying to find a solution, so we’ll wait for her to do her research first.” Potter said sternly, which seemed to appease the others if only a tiny bit.
Draco’s hand stilled mid-air, as he was just about to put a vial of Gillyweed onto the shelf behind him.
Sure, Draco had been working on ways to make some of the potions either more stable, longer lasting or have better taste, but to hear Potter saying he had picked up on it was truly a compliment. The guy used to be the most oblivious person he had ever come across, but perhaps that had changed with the years as well, Draco thought.
one to talk! Having spent most of your years at Hogwarts obsessing over the git day in and day out.” Weasley scoffed. Draco just shrugged and resumed his eating. Was that how they had been viewed by people? Being obsessed with one another? Sure, they had spent most of their school years trying to get under each other’s skin and taunting each other whenever they got the chance, but that was just pure rivalry, Draco noted.
Draco had also spent the few moments by himself coming to terms with certain feelings. He had already given up on the idea that the dreams he had of him and Harry being a little too intimate with each other, would go away.
“Of course, it’s loose. I’m not an Auror.” Draco tried to sound indignant, but the embarrassment still pushed its way through his words.
“Potter! Nice seeing you again.” Pansy gave a quick smile in Potter’s direction before nodding her head curtly towards Ron. “Weasley.”
It was a wonder, Draco thought, that his voice sounded as steady as it did. He certainly wasn’t feeling very steady as he stood there with Potter’s hands on his cheeks and their faces mere inches apart.
“We should be friends Draco, don’t you think?” An offer of friendship from someone he least deserved it from. It only showed how remarkable she was.
“I didn’t know how you felt, so I didn’t want to ruin the friendship we had managed to build.” Harry shrugged, being too calm about the situation for Draco’s liking.
Harry started smearing the lube around Draco’s hole. He circled his finger a few times before he gently pressed against his entrance.
The pacing got faster and faster, and soon Draco couldn’t tell if he was breathing or not. “I’m… I’m gonna-!”
“So, you find me cute?” The playful grin on Harry’s face was infuriating. “Shut it, just be glad you have a body like that.”
“I’ve drank too much.” Draco said honestly, giggling at the lightness in his head. He was more than a little tipsy and it felt good. Almost as good as Harry’s hands holding him tightly.
“Stop trying to justify me! I wasn’t your responsibility, and I did a hell of a lot of things that shouldn’t be forgiven!”
“Oh, come on. Why not? If anything, the two of you know more about each other than anyone else. Rumours during school was all about how obsessed you two were with each other, you know. I remember actually getting jealous over you back then.” Ginny said, leaning back and absentmindedly placing her arm around Luna’s chair. Much had changed since their time at Hogwarts.
Draco had given Granger an alarming stare as he didn’t know how Potter signed his name. Granger looked just as alarmed as she shrugged her shoulders in defeat, knowing she couldn’t help him. Draco ended up writing Harry Potter in cursive with a bit of flare at the end. He knew it would be far from what Potter probably did, but he also felt a bit of satisfaction in knowing people would be wondering what was going on if they ever saw the signature made by him and not the real Potter.
She shrugged. “Well, when one of your best friends is the number one rule breaker in school it’s difficult not to be affected by it.” Maybe Granger wasn’t as bad as Draco had always assumed.
“Of course, I did! You’ve been a loyal customer and a good babysitter for my brother, so I need to thank you in some way” Amelia said jokingly with a big grin, as Harry gave her a disapproving look.
Draco felt himself turn even redder, and he wanted to retort, but couldn’t as Harry dipped his finger into Draco’s hole. It had loosened up by him coming, and the finger went in deep. But just as it pushed in, it retracted back out again. This continued for a while until three fingers were effectively pushing in and out of him in a steady rhythm.
“What? There’s no romance! Stop it!” Draco said as Pansy raised an eyebrow in disagreement. “You had a bet with him too?!”
“I wasn’t snuggling, you twat!” Draco spat out, trying to lift his head up and throwing a disgusted look at him to hide the embarrassment he felt. “If it makes you feel any better I haven’t the faintest clue myself.” Draco huffed out, letting his annoyance drip through his words.
Harry chuckled, the vibrations sending shivers through Draco’s body before he let go of his cock. “I’m trying.” The smirk on Harry’s face showed promise of more to come.
“You’re a prat…” Draco mumbled, feeling a bit heated as he was pinned to the wall after having given a confession.
He had been keeping a low profile for several years after the war but being constantly holed up in the manor had made him restless to the point where he couldn’t take it anymore. It wasn’t until Pansy had trotted along one morning and demanded that they did a brainstorming as to find a hobby for Draco.
“Only for the time being. Once you get over your awe of the guy, you’ll realise that he’s just a human like all of us.”
“I think I should bring him home now. Molly’s been watching Rosie, so we’ll have to get back soon.” Granger said, taking another sip of her tea before waking Weasley.
“I came to return your tracking device.” Draco said as he entered the room and closed the door behind him. Potter just gave a small hum without looking up from his work. He had a frown on his face as he concentrated.
“You know, I’m not usually that perplexed by anything that happens around you anymore, but really…” Granger trailed off, she was moving as she talked and as she reached the side of the couch it was clear as to who was currently sat in Potter’s lap.
Potter left the store while continuously praising Draco, which only made it harder for Draco to hide the tint showing on his cheeks.
He didn’t have as many nightmares when he was in Potter’s body, but he did occasionally wake up in the middle of the night anyway out of pure habit. He looked over at Potter’s bed, a bit surprised as he realised it was empty.
“I’ll have to explain it to Granger again, won’t I?” Draco sighed as they were both back on their feet again.
“What’s his Patronus?” Draco furrowed his brows at that. Sure he knew Potter could do one, but he had never seen it before with his own eyes. He also wasn’t aware of Pansy actually knowing Potter’s Patronus. When on earth had she seen it?
“You bloody well know.” Potter said, groaning slightly as Draco’s legs pushed his groin down on him. Then his demeanour changed to a slightly serious one as he hesitated before speaking again. “However, I have to ask. I’d like to know if you want to go further as well, or if you’d want to take things slow, either way is fine for me.”
“What happened at the quidditch match?” Now Draco wasn’t sure if something had happened that he hadn’t been aware of.
This will be the death of me, the thought ran through Draco’s mind as he tried to collect himself and avoid the heat threatening to rise to his face.
“Well, I didn’t really have the luxury of time to wait around and ask for your permission.” Potter shrugged; his relaxed behaviour was only igniting more anger in Draco as he came to the realisation that Potter was, in fact, not afraid of him regardless of the power balance between them.
“I’m sorry.” Potter chuckled. “I have one request though.” Potter said, eyeing him carefully. “I know it might be hard, but I’d like it if you were to try calling me by my first name.”
It was over way too quickly Draco thought, before feeling Harry’s mouth plant butterfly kisses all the way down his stomach. He felt his stomach contract at each kiss and anticipation started building as Harry got closer and closer to a place that was burning with desire to be touched.
“And what of it?” Draco barked back, the whole proximity issue making it difficult to sound as emotionless and unbothered as he wanted.
Draco twitched as he knew in whose hands his freedom was held. After the war, Potter had testified for both Draco and his mother, saving them from a lifetime in Azkaban. Although he had managed to get a job as a potion master in a small, run-down shop on the outskirt of Hogsmeade, he knew that there were many people out there who wanted him behind bars. If it had not been for the fact that Potter was the one who testified and told people to stop directing their hatred his way, then he most likely wouldn’t be where he was. It was all thanks to Potter’s status and protection.
Hesitantly, Draco took a breath before nodding. The next second he felt Harry start to push his lube covered cock towards his entrance. The tip of his cock prying its way inside. It wasn’t easy due to the size, but after a few slow tries, he finally entered. Both gasped loudly, feeling each other link together. Draco felt a sharp pain from being breached for the first time, but somehow it felt less painful when he saw the look of pleasure wash over Harry’s face.
“Come on! I’ll get you anything you want if you manage to keep up a civilized act around them.” Harry pleaded, making circling motions on Draco’s stomach.
“Are you looking for Harry?” Amelia asked, as she had noticed Draco’s attention being drawn towards the rest of the bakery.
“Why the hell does she think I would ever sink that low?” Draco huffed, still perplexed about someone as smart as Granger could come to such a conclusion.
“Please… I really don’t want to see you close to danger like this ever again.” Harry chuckled, his worry showing through his words.
As Draco opened his eyes to the sound of birds singing outside the windows, he realised his attempts had been meaningless. Once again, his body had decided to get as close as possible to Potter during the night. However, instead of letting his hands roam as they wanted, he propped himself up on his elbows to see if Potter was awake.
Somehow it felt like the times that Potter came by the little potion shop increased over the next weeks. He seemed to always be in need of various potions that could most likely be bought cheaper and pre-made at another shop. Draco neglected to say anything about it though, as he had started enjoying the few times he was able to see Potter. They weren’t exactly friends yet or anything, but the atmosphere between them was much more relaxed compared to their first few meetings.
Their teamwork had managed to knock out a few of the people attacking them, but not nearly enough as it only seemed like the number of dark cloaked figures were multiplying by the second.
Draco shot up, breathing hard as he took in the nightmare he had just witnessed. ‘The hell?’ he muttered to himself as he realised that the nightmare wasn’t like his usual ones. It didn’t make any sense. The nightmares were there, but they weren’t… his?
He hadn’t really meant to stare at him, and usually Draco was pretty good at handling his emotions and facial expressions as he had a lot of training from the constant meetings with ignorant douchebags.
It’s because I’ve been falling behind on work lately, Draco thought to himself as he didn’t want to admit the fact that he wasn’t all too keen on meeting Harry at the moment.
He felt the vibrations run through him as Potter lightly chuckled. “I’ve just become very good at differencing between good and bad. And you are definitely not a bad person, I’ll continue to fight you on that until you realise it yourself as well.”
“That’s great!” The happiness in Harry’s voice surprised Draco. Sure, they were finally together, and he knew how Harry felt about him. However, he hadn’t thought Harry would be that excited about them committing freely to living together so soon.
“I love…I…” He felt his breath stop for a second as he convulsed, white streaks smearing over his and Harry’s stomachs.
Draco just looked at her wide eyed for a second, unable to process how in the world she had managed to sneak up on him like that, how long she had been there and what exactly he should be saying at this point.
Harry continued on chatting as he carefully put a few variations of pastries into a small white box with a baby blue ribbon. It looked charming Draco noted.
“Listen, I’m sorry if you didn’t like me talking to Ron about everything, but he kinda had to understand the whole picture in order to get a better understanding of you as well. If you just give him a change, you’ll see that he’s a good guy. Hermione too, the two of you would probably find that you have much more in common than you might think.” The conversation became more serious with Potter’s words and honesty.
Somehow Draco found that the conversation had become a lot more fun. Weasley was easy to rile up and even with the most outrageous plans, he seemed to fall for the bait again and again. Potter was sitting, mostly quietly, seemingly enjoying the little drama that was unfolding.
Draco stepped back desperately trying to maintain a decent distance from the half-naked man, but he couldn’t help it when his eyes darted down to the muscled chest in front of him. Having him up close made it even easier to trace the fine muscles. It was a surprise to Draco as he hadn’t realised just how buff Potter had become after the war. His eyes were once again caught by green ones as he felt his back hit the sturdiness of a stone wall.
“Cus it’s not healthy. And seeing him takes the edge of, doesn’t it? You don’t have to constantly worry about running into him now that you’ve finally met after all this time.” Pansy looked pleased with herself, despite Draco thinking she had absolutely no reason to.
“I suppose that won’t be an issue. It’ll take about an hour and a half though.” Draco turned and walked into the brewing room, knowing Potter would follow like he usually did. However, still not feeling overly excited about the idea of having a Weasley enter his sacred space.
“You better not regret it…” He sniffed, earning a chuckle from Harry “I won’t” He said before kissing Draco.
It wasn’t until later in the evening when both of them were sat at the couch huddled up in blankets with a glass of fire whiskey each, that they started talking properly to one another.
“Sure enough, but you haven’t done anything as far as anyone else knows, and it’s not like I’m interested in having you sent to Azkaban when I spent so much time and energy on keeping you out of that place.”
“Speaking of experience now, are we?” Draco knew Potter had enough experience in that aspect to last a lifetime. The prophecy had been following him around like a hawk, making sure to note down every single thing the man did. Draco had been jealous of the heavy attention before, but now… now he wished nobody knew about him at all.
“Forgive me if I’m being rude, Granger, but that doesn’t sound like a very good option.” Draco gave a hesitant look at the vial in front of him.
“I can’t! It’s weird if I go too often, isn’t it? I’m sure he or Weasley will pop by any day now anyways.”
“It’s not too bad though.” Draco noted. Pansy gave him a side glance as she spoke. “Same with Potter. You two might not have the best relationship, but at least he doesn’t seem hell bent on some form of revenge or anything.”
“What a shame.” Luna’s airy voice sounded slightly disappointed, before she suddenly lit up. “At least now you can both be friends. I always thought the two of you could’ve been good friends in school.”
“Go grab the ingredients needed and then start reading the instructions. Call out if you need help.” The students started gathering at the small room lined up with shelf’s full of ingredients. Draco waited for a bit before heading over, having felt the hostility of quite a few students, he thought it best to be a bit careful whenever he could.
“Found it!” Draco said, feeling more excited than he had in a while. “It’s most likely this one.” Draco pointed at the top right of the page. “That’s great!” Granger said enthusiastically.
“The saying, I could eat a horse, isn’t that far off it would seem” Draco got a quick jab at his side for his comment before Harry chuckled.
Positioned at the back of the class, Draco listened as the new Professor named Shrew talked rapidly, seemingly not in need of air between his sentences.
“No…” Ginny sighed. “He’s not someone we can trust fully, and therefore we won’t know for sure if he’ll alert them. That could prompt them to go into deeper hiding and we’ll have to wait forever to catch them. We’ll also loose the advantage of them not knowing we’re out to get them.”
Draco was trying to avoid showing too much of his neediness and would only occasionally come up with excuses as to why it would be better for him to just stay the night at Harry’s place.
“Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’m partly doing it to save our friendship, but it’s not JUST that!” Harry said, still holding on to Draco, making it impossible to run away from what was going on.
Harry reached a hand up and sank it into the back of Draco’s hair, gaining control over his body as well. Draco felt his own lip’s part slightly as he anticipated Harry’s move.
Draco felt himself lean into the touch and closed his eyes briefly. The feeling of Potter’s hand and the soft sheets beneath him was tantalizing. Oh, how he wished he could stay like this forever.
Draco was grateful that everyone seemed to not mind their relationship. He was sure Amelia had pressed Harry for intel on their relationship, and it seemed like the whole group was more or less aware of it.
“I suppose the backup would be nice.” A small grin spread across Potter’s face as he spoke, playing into Draco’s sarcasm. “And you’d be able to experience how to properly fly a broom for once.”
Draco leaned back, yawning as he felt Harry’s chest against his bare back. The water in the tub was warming them up after the chilling adventure they had while playing quidditch in the snowy weather with the Weasleys earlier in the day. It was the day after Christmas, and they were finally back home in their own house. Exhausted from the long weekend of non-stop eating and playing games or sipping hot chocolate by the fire.
“Yeah, I suppose the news would travel quickly and we would probably have people snooping around for a scope or whatever. However, it might be a good idea, nonetheless. Especially if Hermione can’t figure it out.” Potter said, perching up from his unwillingly intense conversation about dubious creatures with Luna.
“That’s a workout for you.” Draco muttered as he allowed himself to process the aftermath of the sensations fully. Harry chuckled lightly as he also seemed to do the same.
It made him a bit curious as to why someone who was such a good baker would be working in a small-town bakery compared to at a high-class restaurant or so. The salary would be on a completely different level, Draco thought.
“And what if they can’t do anything about it?” At this Potter looked Draco in the eyes. “Then we’ll just have to deal with it. We’re still able to live like this, so we’ll figure it out somehow.”
“S-Sorry, I just... Your hair is surprisingly soft compared to how it looks.” Draco said, withdrawing his hands and awkwardly shifting over to the cauldron, ignoring Potter’s small smile that was utterly too endearing.
“See? I told you I was bringing you to the best potion master in England.” Potter said, a hint of proudness in his voice, that made Draco’s face heat up.
“Hmm…” Harry hummed seemingly unconvinced by Draco’s objections as he headed towards the small kitchen.
“What? Are you mad that you haven’t had the chance to see him in his pretty little uniform, or are you blushing because you can’t stop picturing how he’d look?”
“Don’t get ahead of yourself. People don’t have to be in love in order to want to fuck you. That thing you’ve got down there would make anyone want to have a go.”
He slid his hands down Harry’s chest before struggling with opening his trousers. “Take them off.” Draco breathed into his mouth. “I want to…” Draco trailed off, understanding the intention, Harry squirmed out of his trousers taking his underwear along with it.
“Well, I’m not really, I just…” Draco trailed off, wondering to himself why he took it so seriously all of a sudden. Perhaps it had more to do with the calmness and joy he felt now that he could sit here and relax while having a normal conversation with someone that didn’t have to involve Death Eaters, the war or being on the run from countless dangers.
“Flattery won’t get you anywhere.” Draco sighed for a moment before accepting to take the bait. “What do you have in mind?” He knew full well how persistent Pansy could be whenever she got in that particular mood.
After scurrying off towards the potion classroom, they made quick work of obtaining the needed ingredients before hurrying back to the room of requirements.
Although Draco had always listened to his father, he still couldn’t help but like this smaller and much more homely place he was currently in.
Harry knew that Hermione was right. He wouldn’t be able to keep the friendship if he didn’t agree to a relationship. He just wasn’t sure he would be able to love Draco and hurting him because of his own selfishness of not wanting to let him go was a gloomy thought.
As he tried to reason with himself and force his body to keep walking, his eyes were caught, and his escape plan dissolved in seconds.
“Oh! Yeah, it’s not that… I just… I don’t want you to feel like you’re doing it out of charity or anything. I’m perfectly capable of finding somewhere to live.” Draco knew that wasn’t exactly true. He didn’t have the wealth that he used to harbour, and finding work wasn’t exactly easy for him either. But he had his pride.
“We weren’t going to say anything…” Pansy looked uncomfortable as she shifted slightly in her chair.
“What can I say, I’m very talented.” The tiredness he felt, made the sarcasm slightly less apparent in his words.
Harry slowly pulled out, watching Draco’s face for any hint of discomfort. When he was almost at the edge, he pushed back in even slower.
Harry slowly slid a finger over Draco’s hole a few times, before lightly pressing at it. Draco could feel his legs shaking. Harry rested one hand on Draco’s thigh and soothingly caressed it, trying to make him relax more.
Everything leading up to the sucking had already made Draco dripping wet, and having Harry suck him off, licking and sucking at the most sensitive spots, Draco couldn’t help feeling it build up inside of him.
He wanted to know more about Draco’s expressions. Just how red would he get if he… Harry didn’t manage to stop himself from the temptation.
The bell jingled, signalling someone entering the shop. Draco groaned inwardly, as he lifted his head and looked towards the door.
“Well, you got what you wanted, didn’t you?” The faint grin on Potter’s face was intolerable, and perhaps a little bit charming as well.
“You agree with me, don’t you Harry?” Ron was leaning over the table with desperation in his eyes as he continued to fight a losing battle.
“Here, you got some on your lip.” Potter reached out and with his thumb he swiped across Draco’s mouth as effortlessly as if he had done it a million times before.
Once again Draco saw Harry rise to the same height as him and scout over the pitch for a minute. After a while Harry flew over, coming side to side with Draco.
“Fuck.” Harry muttered as Draco pushed down, taking him as deep as he could. He pushed down a few more times, earning himself a string of moans, before pulling away slightly. He pumped his hand down Harry’s cock, licking the slit at the same time. He felt Harry tug at his hair, and as he leaned up, he was caught in a messy kiss.
“Yep! He might be one of the best duellers out there, but even he needs saving occasionally, ya know.” Weasley looked more than proud of having saved the saviour for once.
As Harry opened the fly on his trousers, Draco raised his hips to allow him to pull both his trouser and underwear off in one swift motion. Draco gasped loudly as he felt the chilly air hit his semi-hard cock. He looked up only to find Harry staring down at him without any reservations, his eyes darting over his body hungrily.
Draco nodded wildly in response, gripping his back tightly, feeling his nails dig into the skin. He needed something to hold on to, something to keep him grounded as he could no longer control himself.
“Yeah… You’re not gay, I heard you” Amelia sighed. She was already pretty frustrated over the situation, as she knew her brother was too stressed about the whole ‘gay’ part instead of strictly contemplating his feelings.
“Okay, good. I’ll head back home for now, and I’ll contact Hannah first thing in the morning!” Granger gave them a look filled with both remorse and determination before stepping into the fire and leaving the two boys alone in the embrace of one another.
“Haaah…” Draco sighed as he started driving. He had thought the relationship between them hadn’t changed at all, but when he thought about it some more, he realised that Harry was being a bit closer to him in general and was also doing things like hugging him and telling him to be safe.
They had found a cosy little corner in the pub which gave them a bit of privacy as Draco had made ‘not being spotted easily’ a requirement for him joining her outside.
“What?” Draco looked down at the board and saw his pieces mulling in defeat. He had been too worried and barely paid any attention to the game. However, it was a lost cause to try and blame it on that, as Weasley simply wouldn’t allow it.
It took a moment as they both lingered in the feelings that had just shot through the both of them. They were panting heavily as Harry slid out of him and lied down next to him.
“Auror Weasley, are you really suggesting I smuggle my own potion into St. Mungo’s? And here I thought you weren’t one who stood for corruption.” Draco chuckled.
“We’ll have to stir it for a moment now, so we can take turns doing it.” Draco said as he motioned at the cauldron filled with the varied ingredients.
“What are you reading?” Draco asked as he sat down, trying to read the title on the book. “Oh, it’s just a muggle book, ‘The Blue Bakery by The Ocean Side’ it’s called.” Potter shrugged, before putting it down on the table.
“Welcome new students at Hogwarts, and welcome back to all old students!” McGonagall’s welcome speech boomed over the great hall as she continued on to matters regarding the older years. “This year will include an added 8
They had already gone as far as Harry pushing his fingers inside of him, and Draco had started to get used to it more and more.
“Hi!” Potter said, as he looked more dishevelled than usual as well, Draco noticed. His black hair sticking out at odd angles and his eyes still filled with a hint of adrenaline and mirth. It was intoxicating to look at, and it gave Draco some mental images that he had to shove to the back of his mind in order to function in front of the guy.
“Alright, just stop by again if you have any questions.” Draco said, as he tended to a customer who had entered a few minutes after Pansy had gone out to fetch lunch, meaning Draco had to deal with him.
Draco sat down as Harry placed a cheesecake on the small staff table. He then sat down opposite of Draco.
Draco could do nothing more than wait patiently, despite the awkwardness of being around Potter at all times of the day.
“It’s bloody brilliant! You always liked potions, and you still have quite some money to your name. Why not buy a small shop?”
“Thank you” Harry looked at him with sincere happiness in his eyes, giving Draco this weird feeling of… butterflies…?
“I’m telling you! This is just crazy… I don’t know if I’ll be able to live through this whole tense atmosphere” Draco sighed, as he watched his childhood friend devour yet another one of the blueberry pastries.
Draco glanced over at Potter who were enjoying the view with a smile on his face and various colours caressing his features, making him look even more stunning than he already was.
I don’t want to die! He felt the desperate plea rush through his tired body mustering up just enough strength to apparate. The shouts and screams disappeared as he felt himself being jerked away at the exact time that another spell came at him.
Draco had become accustomed to the infrequency of when they ate, and wasn't much surprised when Potter decided to make dinner at eight in the evening.
“S-sure.” Draco closed his eyes for a moment, trying to clear his thoughts and find a moment of happiness to focus on. He was proficient at occlumency and legilimens, so clearing his mind wasn’t difficult for him. He remembered the times when he was young when life had been peaceful and filled with joy, unaware of the dark future he would be facing. He switched through his memories easily navigating his mind. A memory of him playing in the garden with his mother surfaced, and he focused on it.
“Well, they all chalked it up to you being butthurt over the fact that Harry didn’t want to be your friend during first year’s introductions.” Ginny seemed more than amused at the current conversation.
Pansy sat down opposite of Draco while Blaise took the spot next to him. “I’m glad you decided to come back for this year.” Pansy quietly said with a faint smile on her lips. Draco couldn’t help but feel like there was a hint of pity in her eyes. Draco gave her a sharp nod before looking away. Pity was not something he wanted directed his way.
“Then why not get back together?” A weird sensation washed over him at his own words, he couldn’t quite figure out why he felt like he didn’t fully mean it.
And with that Weasley seemed to be in too good of a mood to let the presence of Malfoy ruin it. Instead, he, surprisingly enough, thanked him and started discussing chess strategies all the way to the door, until Potter managed to drag him away with a short “Thank you, bye!”
Draco stood there for a moment, shocked at the fact that he himself had been expecting…. Wait… What exactly had he been expecting? Draco thought to himself.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “What do you think?” Draco shivered, feeling a surge of relief. “Let’s do it.”
“Are you kidding me?” The despair in Potter’s voice would’ve been offending, had Draco not shared the sentiment.
However, although begrudgingly, Draco couldn’t get himself to throw the most advanced hexes. His energy level was just too low, and he could feel that his magic was weaker than usual.
“Stop it. You’re not a death-eater anymore, and I know you never wanted to follow that path to begin with. You were forced.” There was a hint of comfort in the words Potter was saying. His strong faith in him was admirable, but it also made other feelings rise inside of Draco. Sure, he hadn’t wanted to be a death-eater, but he hadn’t gone against it, not enough. He had been too much of a coward to choose a different path, and he knew he would’ve never had the same courage as Potter had in order to defy and kill the dark lord.
“For a little while now, yes.” Potter just rubbed his eyes and yawned, paying very little attention to the prior happenings.
“I’m alright, I… I just realised I had some unfinished work I really need to get done by the day. I’m sorry, I’ll just head home for now” Draco stumbled on his words, as he quickly grabbed his jacket and shoes before saying a quick ‘bye’ and heading out the door before Harry could get a word in.
“To see if we can get some help fixing whatever this is.” Potter carefully made his way down the stairs while Draco masked his fear of being dropped behind various curse words. Always in need of other people’s help to figure shit out, Draco thought and scoffed, before realising what exactly Potter had said.
“The T-shirt. It’s quite…loose.” Draco looked down, seeing that his whole chest was showing as he leaned over to get settled in. He awkwardly tugged at the back of the T-shirt to hoist it up, weirdly aware of how thin he had become and the embarrassment of Potter seeing him like that.
“If you mean by ‘not doing half bad’ that they managed to come second to last for once in their bloody careers, then sure, they did marvellously!”
“Come in.” The familiar greeting was heard as Draco knocked on the doors. He took a breath before opening the doors.
Two more days went by before Draco could start brewing the potion. He had to ensure that Potter would be occupied for a substantial amount of time before he could do anything.
“Well, there must’ve been some reason to it, as I don’t suppose you normally go around attacking people in their own homes.” Draco wanted to protest and throw a remark at him, but Potter continued. “As far as I’m able to discern from both the state of your clothes and exhaustion of magic, it looks like you’ve been in a pretty heavy fight.”
It was strange really, but not very surprising. Each one of the golden trio seemed to have the most forgiving attitude Draco had ever seen. How on earth could they all thank him so sincerely when helping them should’ve been the least he did after everything. But maybe that was exactly why those three ended up saving the whole wizarding world. Perhaps their kindness and forgiving nature were the reason as to why love prevailed.
Everyone had just kinda quietly accepted the closeness that was suddenly evident between Harry and Draco.
“I regret falling in love with you.” Draco gasped between the kisses. “Too late.” Harry grinned, Draco rolled his eyes as he reached for Harry’s hand and guided him over to his bed.
“No! Don’t worry! Everything is fine, I just got a bit stressed out about the work I had forgotten all about, so I rushed a bit too much I guess” Draco said as an excuse to the whole mess that had happened two days ago.
Without properly thinking and seeing the look of happiness on Potter’s face mimic his own, Draco felt a laugh escape him as he threw himself forward and hugged Potter tightly.
“Are you okay?” Draco felt himself tense for a second, he hadn’t noticed Potter scrutinizing him, and now it was too late. Potter was standing close enough to see the worn-out look on his face, which Pansy had been nagging him about for days now.
“Seems like it.” Potter shrugged. “Although I’m not sure you’ll manage to convince her as easily this time around, considering you literally threw yourself at me.” Draco once again heard the faint teasing in Potter’s voice. It wasn’t malicious, but it was provocative.
Pansy rolled her eyes, clearly not amused by Draco’s unimpressed tone. “Everyone who shops there, of course!” She said, matter-of-factly. “If they see me outside of the store wearing something atrocious, then they’d never trust my sense of fashion, dear.”
Before Potter could make another witty retort, Draco leaned down and pressed their lips together once more. It was intoxicating, and Draco just couldn’t get enough of it. It felt like he was complete whenever his lips were entwined with Harry’s. His hands were clutching at Harry’s hair, firmly keeping him in place so that he could continue his kissing spree.
Once more Potter’s eyes landed on him and this time, they seemed to scrutinize him more properly. “Why would you?” His voice was stern, and it made Draco feel a tinge of annoyance rise within him. It was frustrating to see none of the old Harry Potter left in the current one. The young boy who would always push back and retaliate regardless of what you said.
Draco groaned as he was getting nowhere with this. It couldn’t be that he liked Harry, right? He didn’t! He just… Draco stopped for a moment, what did he feel for Harry? Was it possible that he wasn’t even aware of his feelings?
At first, Draco was allowing Harry full control. Harry roamed his mouth trying to reach every nook and cranny he could get to.
“Oh, I know right? It’s not enough that he’s such a bloody natural when it comes to duelling and spells in general, but he’s actually smarter than I think anyone gave him credit for.” She sighed dramatically. “No wonder everyone is after him, trying to get hold of the bachelor.”
“Don’t worry. I trust you.” Draco said reaching his hand up to brush a strand of loose hair from Harry’s eyes which were still filled with uncertainty. “I’ll tell you if I want to stop.” Draco said, knowing he had to reassure him before he would continue.
Potter followed his gaze towards the flames, cracking and sending small sparks flying. “I’m sure she’ll pop by the minute she has something to share.”
Draco tightly held onto the snitch as he flew down taking in the sight in front of him. His teammates were cheering loudly, their cheers intertwining with those of the crowd.
“Well, it was never McGonagall who used to hold the speeches before anyway, she must’ve made some changes to it.” Blaise shrugged. Draco could feel himself tense at the conversation steering towards the headmistress. It only reminded him of Dumbledore and the moment he had watched him die.
After a split second of shock at what Granger was seeing compared to what truly happened, Draco scrambled to get up from Potter’s lap, wanting to reassure Granger that she had once again had very bad timing with her entrances.
He knew Potter wouldn’t like it, and perhaps it had been a desperate attempt at getting him riled up enough for him not to call Granger. However, he hadn’t truly had time to contemplate exactly what Potter would do, and he definitely didn’t expect the reaction he got.
“Oh, most definitely. Ron is more upset about Harry not telling him about it at once than the actual situation itself. I’m sure he’ll come around once the shock of it all starts to ebb off.” Hermione seemed more or less used to the weird antics of the two boys and just patiently waited it out.
This time around Potter wasn’t wearing a robe covering up his uniform. The material of the uniform wrapped tightly around Potter’s arms, showing just how much muscles the guy had somehow managed to obtain throughout the last couple of years. It showed off his broad shoulders and strong thighs. It was like the uniform itself was enticing him to reach out and touch every part of Potter’s body. Draco didn’t know if he should curse or thank the person who had decided that Auror uniforms had to look so bloody hot.
“If we fuck up, even just a tiny bit, everyone will know about it. Sure, you definitely get a worse response, but I’m not easily let of the hook just for being who I am. Instead, they will at once start writing conspiracies about me, wondering if maybe the ‘great Harry Potter’ has decided to go dark or some nonsense like that.” The way Potter said his own name was with so much disdain, it felt a bit unbelievable to listen to.
“I’m joking!” Potter laughed loudly at the look of disbelief on Draco’s face. “I’m fairly certain you wouldn’t sell me out. How could you when you’ve been so openly in love with me all these years?”
Slowly he felt Harry’s cock drag out of him and then just as slowly slide back in. The first few pushes were difficult to keep up with as Draco kept his focus on his breathing. The burning was slowly ebbing away as the thrusts became more steady and quicker.
“Yeah, I’d say he’s far too optimistic for someone who has to go through that on a daily basis.” Draco agreed thoughtfully.
“Wake up, Malfoy.” Draco groaned as he felt someone shake his shoulder. “I must say you’ve lost quite a bit of handsomeness during the night.”
Just then Draco realised he was still holding on to the pictures in a tight grasp. “This… I was just…” Draco wished he could’ve just apparated away from there at that very instance. Sadly, the heavy warding forbids him from doing so.
“Oh, who knows. Maybe they do have reasons to be cautious of me.” Draco felt his words spill out of him without the chance of stopping it. Why would he go so far just to challenge Potter? Was he this insistent on obtaining a reaction that would break Potter’s calm mask?
Truth be told, Harry had never had such a friendship with any of his male friends before. Even Ron who was his closest friend. Sure, he could talk to Hermione about more sensitive and emotional stuff, but Draco was just… different.
“You alright?” Draco croaked out, coughing to try and cover up the strange pitch his voice had decided to take on.
Draco could feel the differences compared to his own villa the same way as he had when he first visited Harry’s house.
“Because I don’t think I’m gonna be able to outrun those who want me dead. I don’t want to live on the run or fear what might be around the corner every single day.”
Seemingly in a much better mood, Granger turned on her heel and walked towards the fireplace. “I’m still swamped with work, so I’ll head back now. I’ll tell you once I find something that might do the trick.”
“What topics?” Draco disregarded Harry’s comment about breakfast, feeling worry sink through his body at what exactly Harry and his mother had been conversing about.
“I would’ve expected it to be more evened out, but she seems to have inherited your brain solely.” Draco chuckled.
“Don’t act so surprised, Potter. With your recent behaviour anyone would’ve started imagining things.” Draco said, trying to hide his embarrassment at his slip of the tongue.
Potter grunted as he barely opened his eyes, annoyance was dripping from his voice as he spoke. “What?”.
Potter proceeded to lean in further as he turned the tap on, his chest leaning into Draco’s. Draco’s hands flew up on their own accord, gripping onto Potter’s shoulders for a split second before he abruptly jerked them away, finding no good place to put them as he stuttered on, pressing himself back against the sink, but finding no escape from the closeness. There was no way Potter didn’t hear Draco’s frantic heart trying to break free from his ribcage.
“Oh… Is it bad? I’m sure Hermione has some medicine laying around if you-“ Draco cut her off before she could finish her sentence. “It’s fine, I just need some sleep and quiet” Draco said. He was sure Amelia had noticed his strained expression and that something else was up with him, but she did not press the matter.
“Then what the hell are you going to-“ Draco almost managed to supress a startled gasp as he felt a tingle creep over his skin. He could feel the warmth of a drying spell and then had to uncomfortably witness Potter manage to put on some sweatpants while still having Draco glued onto his upper body.
Potter arched an eyebrow as he walked over to the desk. “You seemed pretty lost in thought there for a moment.”
“He’s old.” Potter retorted and then stopped to look at Draco’s frowning face for a second. “Be careful with how you address them though, they do have better rights now. If Hermione was to hear you, you’d get an earful.” The low chuckle that escaped Potter caught Draco’s interest. It sounded almost too friendly between the two of them.
After dinner Draco kept his promise to Rosie who had, to Harry's dismay, completely changed the list of her favourite people.
It felt like eternity, where Draco was focusing on his breath while Harry slowly pushed his finger in and out of him.
“Thank God! I thought all of the compartments were occupied already!” Draco looked up from his book only to find none other than Pansy Parkinson standing in the entry with Blaise Zabini trailing behind her. “It’s good to see you!” She beamed at him.
“I’m certainly that type of person, aren’t I?” Draco muttered, knowing the position would be fitting for Potter.
“Will you ever stop with that relentless kindness of yours? With you constantly being nice, it’s making me into the biggest asshole, you prat.” Draco hissed back in a low whisper; his voice did not hold much animosity he realised after he spoke.
This guy… Why was he so thoughtful and kind, Draco thought to himself. He was such great boyfriend material, but why was he using it on Draco instead of finding himself a girl? There was no way that girls wouldn’t be all over him.
“I don’t fancy Potter. I… We’re merely on friendly terms is all. I hardly think Potter would appreciate us assuming his sexuality, much less assuming he would ever like someone like me.”
“Are you sure you weren’t sorted into the wrong house at Hogwarts?” Draco lifted one eyebrow, clearly indicating that the Weasley girl, of all people, actually seemed to have some Slytherin qualities to her as well.
“I suppose. It’s still up and coming, but it’s only been a year and frankly I’m surprised at how well it’s doing so far. It’s not exactly a big shop either and can’t rival shops like the Apothecary and such. But I suppose some people enjoy the smaller, quieter places, and that’s enough for this shop to still function decently.”
He had awkwardly followed Potter to the door and sighed once it closed. He turned the ‘open’ sign to ‘close’ and got halfway through the shop before the door jingled again.
Draco was stunned. Why the hell was he unable to fight back? And even more so, why was he starting to feel some sort of excitement? It was like he couldn’t control his body anymore. He knew he shouldn’t want anything from the current situation, but somehow, he couldn’t help it. Had Blaise and Pansy been right?
Draco blinked as he groggily tried to wake up. He hadn’t had such a decent sleep for months now, and it was difficult to tear himself away from the comfortable heat underneath him.
He felt shaky as he lied down, looking up, Harry was towering over him. He accepted the light kisses as he felt Harry open his shirt buttons and he perched up ever so slightly allowing Harry to get rid of the shirt completely. Harry quickly got rid of his own Auror robes, and it made Draco feel awfully self-conscious at how ripped Harry was.
“Shouldn’t you tend the counter, Pans?” Despite feeling relieved that he was no longer outnumbered by Gryffindors, Draco felt himself uncomfortably wanting the conversation to end, never being sure whether or not Pansy would think it appropriate to indulge the present guests with more information than needed.
The potion book had said to only inhale it right before going to bed. Draco gathered his stuff and went to the bathroom to get himself ready for sleep.
“Not sure that’s possible when I decided to pursue the golden boy who-can’t-stop-getting-into-trouble.” Draco sighed, allowing Harry to drag him to his feet.
Harry grinned, and Draco couldn’t help but smile a bit. He had missed Harry a lot, so it was nice being together like this again.
“Sorry, I should’ve sent a notice before I came!” Granger looked apologetic as she slid out of her jacket and raised her purse slightly. “I was too excited, so I just went straight here from work.”
It had been tough after the war, and he had been lucky enough to be able to buy a small store where he could brew potions and sell potion ingredients.
“I already contacted Ron when I went after you. We’ve been observing the group for a while, but I kept anything about you out of it. I’m sure he’s apprehended the guys by now, in fact-“ Harry fished out a small amulet from his pocket only to show it glowing at him. “Seems like I’m right.” Draco knew only a little about the various equipment’s of Aurors, but he knew enough to tell that the amulet was one used between Aurors indicating whether a mission was successful or not.
“Oh! I hadn’t realised how late it had gotten” Harry said, before looking over at the window. “It doesn’t look like it’s going to stop though…” He said as he pointed towards the window.
They kept on working in a comfortable silence, both silently agreeing to a truce for the time being.
“What?” Potter had just reached the door to the bathroom when he stopped and turned to look at Draco. Both of them wincing slightly at the creeping pain that arose from both of them not being close enough. Still, Draco didn’t want to give in first.
“You’ve got Parkinson and Zabini which is great, but you need to open up a bit if you want to keep good relations with the both of them.”
Granger stopped short as she took in the sight in front of her. For a second everyone is just frozen in place, when finally, Potter decides to act.
“You brought him medicine?” Lovegood’s dreamy gaze was focused on the dark purple vial standing on the bedside table.
“I’m sorry, mate.” Harry looked genuinely apologetic as he spoke. “I knew you wouldn’t like it, so I thought it would be better to keep it between me and Hermione until we found a fix for it. Ginny and Luna came by unexpectedly, so they found out as well.”
Somehow, touching Potter’s hair had always been something Draco hadn’t even dared think about. It just seemed too intimate and too off-limit for him to even consider a possibility.
“Fuck, you’re big.” Draco murmured as he stroked slowly up and down. Harry had leaned back and closed his eyes as he arched up to the touch.
“Luckily for my own pride, I know how unbelievable oblivious you can be at times, so I figured I’d ask to check whether or not you’re even aware of it, which I see was a good thing to do, all things considered.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t think you’re aware, Potter, but most people aren’t as desperate to forgive as you are. I’m still shunned by the public, and the few years that have passed since the war hasn’t really changed anything in that regard.”
“Alright, fine. Obviously I’m not as dense as you two are when it comes to seeing what’s right in front of me.”
Sorry for taking some time before posting another chapter. Work is tiring and taking up a lot of my time.
“I see… I thought so.” Draco huffed in response, feeling slightly ill from the notion of knowing it all had had no intention behind it.
“Yeah, of course. He was so excited to hear about the whole romance going on.” Pansy said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Again, Draco found himself frowning at the man in front of him, who was now holding a spoon up to his face.
“That’s quite the promise…” Draco huffed out in a hopeless voice. Of course, Harry was the best, if anyone could get the remaining Death Eaters it would be him. However, Draco knew it might take some time, and what if it took way too long? Would Harry still offer him shelter then?
“Draco?” At the mention of his name, Draco widen his eyes in shock. “How did you?” Draco stopped himself as he looked over at Potter, who only shrugged in defeat.
Draco felt himself relax into the touch. He knew that no matter what Potter wasn’t a bad guy. He wasn’t someone who would hurt him.
Harry waited for Draco to adjust, not moving an inch. But Draco could feel how Harry was desperately trying to keep himself in check.
Draco could feel tears pressing at his eyes. He had never felt this loved and wanted his whole life. Not like this… Not from someone who was filled with unlimited love for him.
Draco nodded, and Harry leaned in closer, gently pressing their lips together. Draco leaned into the kiss feeling his hands reach up to touch the mess of black hair on Harry’s head. Harry lightly bit down on Draco’s lower lip, earning him a moan and access to Draco’s mouth. There was a sweet tingle that shot through Draco’s body as he felt Harry trace the inside of his mouth. He couldn’t quite believe what they were doing.
“Yet even I have noticed changes in the wizarding world that has been extremely beneficial to those who used to have close to no rights. Perhaps Weasley isn’t far off in his assumptions.” Draco said, remembering how he had read a few papers about new laws that had been implemented after Granger took over the position.
“It’s fine… I’ll live.” Draco said back, reasoning with himself that Potter had already gone through the trouble of keeping him out of Azkaban. It would be a bit farfetched to think he’d bother with him after all that. Although he would probably be able to do whatever he wanted without anyone questioning him, Draco thought. It was highly likely that Potter could’ve gotten away with murdering him in broad daylight if he so wished. Luckily for Draco, he knew Potter was not evil. That much was certain, so perhaps he could survive this year even under the current circumstances.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d say you enjoy hanging over my shoulders and watching me work. At this point you spend more time here in the lab than you do in the Auror office.” Draco sighed, as he focused on the dented device in front of him.
Draco normally didn’t enjoy the cold and crisp air that always came with autumn, but for once he felt lighter and more content as he made his way over to the Malfoy Company.
Draco noticed the look in his eyes and felt heat slowly rise to his cheeks at the feeling of having become so important to the man in front of him that he would look this down from not being able to properly meet for a week or so.
“And for your information, I do, in fact, know how to properly ride a broom.” Draco subconsciously lifted his nose the way he used to do when he was a child. Potter really was the best at rekindling the bratty arrogance in Draco.
“That’s bloody ridiculous!” Weasley said loudly, looking absolutely exasperated by the new info he had just received.
“You were backed into a corner. If only I had been able to help you back then. I should’ve realised it earlier myself.” The calmness and melancholy sound of Potter’s voice only frustrated Draco more.
“Then I suppose she was exaggerating when she told me you used to talk about me all the time whenever you were at the manor. She said she thought you were in love with me since first grade.”
“I remember. You never seemed fully interested during the matches.” Luna said, her eyes seemingly drifting back in time to the years at Hogwarts. “Thank you for proving my point, Lovegood.” Draco said, glad that someone else was taking his side in this, making the story more believable.
“We couldn’t be more different though.” Draco said, busying himself with the sleeve of his shirt as he felt himself being far more honest than he had intended. “He’s the saviour of the wizarding world, and I’m a former death-eater.” Draco noted how difficult it felt to say the last words in front of Hermione. He was aware of how much she had sacrificed for the cause as well, and she had every right to hate him for the side he had chosen to follow.
“At least that’s something we can agree on, Weasley.” Draco chuckled. This might’ve been the first time the two of them had ever seen eye to eye on anything. And it had to be over a bloody Burn-Healing Potion at that.
“Might’ve been.” Potter said absentmindedly, getting up from the couch. Just as he aimed for the kitchen, a surge of pain crashed into Draco’s chest and he yelped loudly “Bloody hell!”.
“Here you go!” Draco thanked her before getting out his book that he had been trying to read between meetings, with very little success.
“Yes… I remembered you telling me about it, so I thought it would be a good addition… I kinda panicked and just threw in a lot of things…” Draco said a bit embarrassed.
Draco eyed him for a moment, annoyed at how Potter was once more trying to appear as this perfect Auror that never got bothered by anything that were said. It was distressing to not get any reactions out of him, especially now that Draco knew he was still the old Harry Potter that he had known during his school years. But Draco was much more cool-headed at this point, knowing he should not escalate things the way he had done before.
“Malfoy” Draco felt a shiver surge through him at the mention of his name. This year was going to be hell, he thought. “Room 2.” McGonagall said and a few murmurs were heard around the room.
“She’s getting help though. Seems like Luna will be taking over the head position at the prophecy soon. That will definitely make the paper much more reliable.” Potter spoke with a fondness in his voice, showing how much he cared for and believed in his friends.
“That’s fine. I’m sure he’ll thank you once he’s feeling better. Perhaps we can even have tea together one day!” Lovegood looked excited as she spoke. “Harry joins me once in a while, so next time I’ll ask that he bring you along.”
“Er… Perhaps we should wait it out a couple of days together? Just to be sure that it’s properly working?” Potter said, looking unsure as to whether Draco would agree to it or not.
Draco barely registered Potter drying his hands on the towel behind him as his brain had now decided to start the shutdown process by itself.
Draco could feel himself burning up from embarrassment. He felt so vulnerable and exposed. Yet, strangely, in all the passion and embarrassment there was a soothing sense of security as well. He felt safe being at the mercy of Harry.
“Your mother sent me a letter; you know” Draco didn’t know. “She asked me to keep an eye out for you if I could. She was worried with you going back to England again. It was what prompted me to change the wards in the first place.”
“I’ll get you some tea as well!” Pansy said, obviously pleased that her little scheming was working perfectly.
“Page 354, we will look at how to brew a wit-sharpening potion.” Professor Shrew said while pacing back and forth in front of the class.
“Oh, yes! Many just want him for the fame though. I can’t imagine how hard it must be to deal with that every single day. Makes it difficult to know who’s genuinely in love with him.”
“Of course not! Why even have the door open when you’re almost naked!” Draco stuttered back, as his words faltered more and more with Potter slowly closing the distance between them.
When Draco didn’t immediately answer, Granger continued. “You’re both able to understand each other on a whole different level considering your pasts, and you’ve both had times where you were obsessed with the other. What harm would it do to date?” Granger was far too unbothered by her own words at this point.
Draco thought, but his mind continued through the memory. His gaze had nervously flickered towards Potter a few times before turning away. Once though, he had let his gaze linger despite the other man looking back at him. He had felt himself heat up at the smile Potter was showing him. The smile that was so comforting, so inviting, making it impossible not to have even a fraction of hope for something more. For a future where Draco could be truly, and utterly happy.
Draco barely managed to get the last words out of his mouth before Potter closed in on him. Draco was fairly proud of himself for having only looked down towards Potter’s naked chest once.
As Draco climbed into bed, he reached out and opened the drawer containing the vial. With a quick glace in Potter’s direction making sure he was sleeping; Draco unscrewed the lid and gave it a good sniff.
“Yeah, customers feeling that way is what makes it all worth it for me” The guy grinned, making Draco’s eyes linger a bit longer than necessary. He once again took note of the fact that the guy in front of him was fairly handsome even in a guy’s opinion.
He surveyed the long tables until he finally got hold of Granger, still seated at her usual spot besides Weasley.
“I see, Pansy was the one handling the appointment. If you’d like to come back at a later time, she will be available to help you.”
A few seconds passed before Potter opened the door slowly. “Why ask when you do whatever you want anyway?” Draco huffed, not meeting Potter’s eyes.
Draco felt too exposed as he walked down the corridor to the great hall. Breakfast was almost over, which meant students were starting to slowly pour out of the hall, heading towards their classes or dorm rooms.
Harry’s movements were interrupted quickly as Draco grabbed the back of his neck and yanked him back into his personal space. Where the sudden confidence was coming from, Draco had no idea. But he was sick and tired of having Potter so close and then for nothing to happen a second later.
“As a matter of fact, I do have some skills beside my broom, you know.” A cheeky grin spread across Potter’s face as he lowered his hand which held the golden snitch tightly. Thundering of applause could be heard from beneath them as Madam Hooch’s voice roared out that the match was over.
Harry had asked Draco if it was fine that Hermione and Ron slept in the guestroom. Draco had just looked at him for a moment, thinking it was funny how Harry felt he needed permission from Draco to give out his own guestroom.
“Hold on. How do you know about the potion?” Draco felt himself tense up, both in anger and in fear of having been caught. It had to be bloody Potter!
Harry slowly reached forward again and graced along his hole; Draco felt himself shiver. The feeling of having Harry touch him so intimately was overly erotic, he felt himself respond to the touch.
“I doubt anyone would ever believe anything of such. How are they even allowed to print stuff like that? Wouldn’t they get sued and publicly shamed for it?”
Draco stood outside the Blue Ocean Bakery, clutching his umbrella. It had been a week since his first visit. He had been swamped with work all week, and it was finally time to once more sit down with a book and allow time to slow down a bit. Even with the heavy rain cascading down the windows of his office, Draco had decided to walk back home once again. He had been waiting for a day where he would be able to enjoy some peace without having to sit in the complete silence of his villa. The bakery had been such a place to him. Not too crowded, and not too deserted. It was a perfect mix of having people around him without it being overly noisy. The heavy rain was also making the bakery seem even more inviting.
“Tell me about it! The bakery was packed almost every day. Seems like everyone decided to stop by before New Year” Amelia sighed, looking a bit worn out.
, of course, it’s the whole creating a Patronus that matches that of the person you love. Gotta be quite the strong love for that to happen though, so...”
“She’s smart Malfoy, if anyone would be able to figure this out it would be her.” Draco scowled at him, unable to deny the fact that he had a point.
After a moment of silence Granger looked between Draco and Potter with a stern look. “Now, just until I can make some sense of this, please do try to be civil with one another. We’re still not certain as to what this spell does to you, and it might affect you in the long run if you fight it too much.”
“Are you good at making food, or do you also depend on the microwave being your saviour?” Amelia added with a knowing look from having spent an hour crying when her microwave broke down on her once before meeting Sebastian and Harry being on vacation.
Draco felt more content than he had in years. Finally, it felt like he had found someone who he could easily hold both light and deep conversations with. He wasn’t feeling that gloomy anymore as he made his way back home to his villa. Being able to look forward to the days where he could go and hang out at the bakery made it so much easier to deal with his usually stressful work hours.
When Draco only gave a short nod in return, Granger seemed to gather herself a bit more as she continued. “Please sit.” She gestured to one of the chairs in front of her desk. “Can I help you?”
It came as a bit of a shock to Draco. They hadn’t really hugged before when they were friends, and now with the whole situation they had going on, called try-dating, it had an even bigger impact on Draco.
“That’s quite the compliment” The guy grinned “Thank you! I was considering making it a regular, but it’s always nice to get some feedback on it before doing so”.
“You just have to heat it up, but if you don’t feel like it you can eat it tomorrow instead. It’s good for another two days if put in the fridge”.
Sure, he had a few crushes back in the day, but the feeling wasn’t the same either. He didn’t just feel attracted to the way a person looked, no, with Harry he felt attracted to his behaviour, the way he smiled and laughed. He liked how caring he was and how serious he looked when he was baking and creating new pastries.
He carefully lifted his head only to realise he was literally clinging to Potter. His hand draped over his chest, and one of his legs sprawled over Potter’s own legs, trapping the man underneath him.
“Yeah, and playing wizarding chess with someone you used to hate is also not a way of trying to get along now, is it?”
The audacity! Draco wanted to go off on how he was the one who was having a hard time dealing with Potter, but bit it down, knowing the prat was right. He finally felt the tiredness creeping up on him as he was no longer focused on breaking the damn spell.
“Cheers to finally breaking the hex.” Harry said, raising his glass. Draco raised his own, feeling a bit lightheaded as they had been drinking for quite some time already.
“Well, after I told you I wanted to try this, I did do some light research. The moment I realised I did love you, I started doing some in-depth research” Harry winked at Draco.
“I can’t believe things turned out this way between you two.” Hermione said after a while of silence.
Draco felt a bit of gratefulness from it, as he was not fond of pain and had been scared of being on the receiving end. Yet, Harry seemed more experienced, so Draco trusted him.
Having been so focused on trying to ignore the aching pain in his chest, Draco jumped slightly when he heard knocking on the door.
Ron looked sullen as he waited for the painful itch. After a few minutes had passed by his brows furrowed as he studied the skin around the paste. A perplexed look on his face, before he looked up slightly surprised.
“If you give me a hand with my potion homework, I’ll do your next transfiguration paper.” Pansy looked hopeful while trying to keep an air of business.
After the Valentine’s day, things had changed between Harry and Draco. They had barely managed to get any chocolate cookies done in-between kisses and Harry finding it increasingly hard not to touch Draco.
“Oh, hello! I just wanted to stop by and have a look.” The woman said, a big warm smile on her face that Draco was rather unfamiliar with. “I’ve been ordering the No-Nauseous potion specifically for pregnant women. It’s been a game changer I’ll tell you that!”
Two fingers in, and the burn was less than with the first one. The lube definitely helped in making it easier to slide into him. Harry curled his fingers upwards, making Draco gasp loudly. “You okay?” Draco could hear the worry in Harry’s voice as he kept his eyes closed, taking in the feeling. “Yeah.” He barely breathed out. “It’s… good.”
A time to face your fears and try new things. A time to finally allow yourself to be honest with what you’re feeling, Draco thought to himself.
“What the fuck am I watching right now?” Draco frowned and looked between the two guys having some sort of ‘bro moment’ going on.
“I’ll have to make sure it’s evenly spread and that it reaches each strand of hair.” A moment of hesitation as Draco considered the idea. “Unless, of course, you’d like to keep some of it.”
Pansy peered over him as he sat casually brewing a headache potion. He had found it difficult to concentrate, so instead he had spent two hours working on making a headache potion that would mimic the taste of treacle tart. For no reason whatsoever. It was just for fun he reassured himself.
Draco had always found it difficult to deal with Lovegood. She seemed to be perfectly able to let the past be past as she had already said she had forgiven him a long time ago when they coincidentally met once a few years back. After that he had received a very unexpected letter from her where she asked to meet for tea one day, in which Draco had politely declined the offer.
“You’re also the fastest when it comes to repairing stuff, which is great as I’m not sure I’d survive another scolding from Ron if he knew I had once again broken the same device for the fourth time now.” Potter chuckled, although Draco could see that he meant every word of it. Getting a scolding from none other than the Weasel himself would be torture in Draco’s opinion.
Once he saw hesitation, Harry hurriedly said. “Of course, it’s only if you want to! I’m not forcing you or anything.”
“Hah, is that why Harry comes here? Are you acting all friendly with him now or what? Sucking up to the hero, eh?”
As things had finally started to calm down since the war and students were returning to Hogwarts, people were in desperate need of something to ease the tension felt between certain students or houses.
Draco’s gaze wandered back to the Slytherin table, as he tried to scrutinize his own face from across the hall. He knew Potter must be experiencing his nightmares the same way he was, but somehow it looked like Potter was doing alright so far. The dark circles weren’t as evident as it had been before. Perhaps Potter wasn’t experiencing all of his nightmares, or maybe he just knew how to deal with them better. When he realised that Potter had noticed his stare and was glancing back at him with a curious look in his eyes, Draco averted his attention back to his plate of food.
found himself looking into the eyes of a dark-haired male who had some seriously scary resemblance to the black-haired girl. Must be her brother, Draco thought.
Once again Draco had to partake in sitting down and telling the whole story of why in the world he was currently housing with Potter.
“I’m aware that the Chudley Cannons aren’t the best. I’m just being awfully loyal to Ron for his unyielding support towards them. Secretly I do believe the Holyhead Harpies are, indeed, superior.” The small mischievous wink was outrageous, and certainly too familiar to be directed at his former nemesis, who did not get even the slightest red from it at all…definitely. So, all Draco could do was gape for a second before averting his eyes and muttering “That’s right, you git…”
For once Draco could actually breathe, he thought. This gave him a feeling of being away on a vacation and to be honest, he felt like he deserved a bit of rest now after having had no time for himself during the past years.
Draco ignored some cold stares as he headed towards the Head Auror office. He knocked once and listened intently for someone. Not hearing anybody, he tried opening the door. Luckily enough, Potter only had wards up but hadn’t locked the door itself.
Draco didn’t look up from the book he was reading as he heard Potter rummage through the kitchen cabinets. A few minutes passed by before Draco sighed and put the book down. The aching was still present despite the less harrowing affect it had on them. Draco found it difficult to concentrate much when he was constantly reminded of it, so he decided to join Potter in the kitchen instead.
He had heard snippets here and there relating to Draco’s family, but what he had gathered from it was that his parent’s rarely spent time with him, instead they were living in a different country.
But, of course, Potter had never been able to read a room before, and that certainly hadn’t changed despite the years that had passed by.
It felt strange so see this side of Harry. To see him vulnerable and peaceful at the same time. He seemed younger when one couldn’t see the burden of carrying the weight of the world in his eyes. Draco lightly touched Harry’s lightning scar. It was a reminder of everything that had happened, just like Draco’s own Death Eater mark. Yet, Harry’s was a symbol of greatness and promise rather than darkness and evil.
It was a beautiful place to live, he couldn’t deny that. Yet, he already knew that the biggest reason as to why he wouldn’t want to leave this place, wasn’t the endless beautiful scenery surrounding every part of the place.
“Auror Potter needed the potion at that time, who am I to deny him of it when we had the opportunity to be of assistance.” Pansy slid of the table lightly before circling around him. She looked like she was hunting a prey with her slow, calculated steps. “And I knew you would run and hide or make up some excuse if I told you who it was. Not a risk I was willing to take with such an important customer.”
“That would be bad, wouldn’t it?” Potter chuckled, the vibrations running through Draco’s chest as well.
Okay… So, I might’ve just decided to extend the story by a few chapters. Just had some inspiration come to me, so I thought, ‘why not?’.
Just then Potter caught Draco’s stare and Draco furrowed his brows giving him a glare. Potter was just as infuriating as he had been since the start of 8
“Oh, yeah. I woke up in the middle of the night. It wasn’t exactly the comfiest place to sleep so I carried you upstairs.”
“You’re just imagining things, there’s no way he would do that.” Draco said. That damn Potter, not able to suppress his goodie-two-shoes nature at all.
It was strange how different it had felt this time around. He wasn’t shocked like he had been the first time, and he got to properly feel the kiss.
“You were stealing ingredients and making a potion in secret. Anyone would be worried about what you might be putting together!” Potter huffed.
No, Harry was also a good person, he seemed gentle, listened earnestly to everything anyone told him, and would easily offer up help whenever someone needed it.
Also I just want to say... Your very kind comments and kudos have really motivated me and just made me want to keep evolving the story more. It's such a joy to see whenever you guys comment on it and I love reading them, thank you so much!
“Yeah, yeah. No need to get worried, dear. I’ll be out of your hair now.” She gave a mischievous wink before leaving the room.
“Right?! I knew it! They said they don’t remember how to do it from school, but I always thought they just didn’t know how to do it in the first place!” She deadpanned, making Draco laugh loudly. It was weird to think he was actually getting along with the child of Weasley and Granger.
“I’m glad. Hopefully he didn’t ruin the elegance of this place by being a twat to you.” Pansy felt the glare at her back from Draco, but didn’t bother to acknowledge it. Her tone had been playful enough in her opinion for Draco to forgive her sometime in the near future.
“You know about the that?” Potter’s face shot up to look at him, and Draco felt a small thrill at finally having piqued his interest.
Draco knew he had changed drastically since the war, and with the help of Harry and the others, he was no longer a Malfoy that would make his father proud. Deep down he felt a hint of satisfaction from the thought of it.
“So, I thought I should check in and tell you I’m okay. Luna told me you looked rather worried when you visited me.”
Draco had no idea how it was possible to go from all that adrenaline to relaxing despite being on top of the person who just kissed him. Somehow, the steady rhythm of Potter’s heart and the slow strokes through Draco’s hair had an instant effect of making him sleepy. It was a feeling of comfort and safety that he hadn’t felt since he was a young child wrapped up in his mother’s protective arms.
“Why not? You’re a quick dueller and I happen to be quite aware of your magical abilities, you know.” The reply was nonchalant and instant, surprising Draco slightly. He had never imagined Potter to think highly of him or his magic, considering what it had been used for.
“That’s good! Do you have any idea of what’s needed for it?” Potter sounded cheery as a possible solution was mentioned.
“I’ve seen Parkinson and Zabini there before, and I’m sure Harry will be there if you do decide to go.” Granger said, trying to make the offer sound more inviting than it really was.
“Is it okay if I take a quick shower first?” Harry asked, and Draco nodded as he went over to the living room. He had started to become really comfortable being there.
However, something else was taking up a bigger portion of Draco’s mind. Why the hell had he just sat there like an idiot clinging to his broom as he let Potter control the whole situation from start to finish. At the very least he could’ve made some sort of comeback that wouldn’t make him look like such a fool.
As they closed the door to the room, Draco sat down, out of habit, in his own bed. Pansy walked over to him briskly, and Draco was almost certain she was about to attack him before she stopped and leaned in. Inches from his face she scrutinized him for a moment.
more unfair treatment, I’m gonna snap!” Granger looked furious, everyone seemed to back off at her words, feeling the intimidation of one of the brightest witches known.
But then why was he feeling so bothered by it? Draco though. He did find Harry’s appearance to be attractive, but any guy would be able to agree on the fact that Harry was attractive. It was just a fact, nothing more…
“Can I help you, Auror Weasley?” Draco spoke as he had been trying to ignore the intense ogling Weasley was directing his way, not seemingly blinking as he watched every move Draco made.
He had a basic potion for feeling nauseous and combined it with another potion that would enhance the effect as well as add in some pain relief and general well-being. It was something Draco had concocted before for another customer who was having the same issue as Granger where nothing had helped during her pregnancy.
He was a Malfoy after all, and that meant pushing his feelings far down while keeping his chin raised high. “I’ve spent years at Hogwarts already, one more won’t make much of a difference.” He told her as she hugged him goodbye.
It was strange. People were smiling and saying good morning to him left and right. All the younger students looked awe-struck whenever they passed by him. It was a feeling he had completely forgotten existed.
“Come off it, Ron.” Potter sighed, gesturing for him to enter the room, as he had been standing in the doorway suspiciously looking into the back room filled with potions and cauldrons boiling. “He’s a potion master as you can see, and he’s been supplying me with various potions for a while now.”
“Nonsense! Ron is just being ridiculous right now. I am the Minister of Magic now, yes, but I just got the position two years ago.”
Guess this is how a small-town works, Draco thought. He had realised that the people in this small-town seemed eager to help each other at any given time, which was very different from what Draco was used to in the big city life.
They talked for a long while about Harry’s pastries and Draco’s work. Harry was a rather easy guy to talk to and he also seemed genuinely interested in whatever Draco was telling him. It felt like, Draco thought, as it had been far too long since he had gotten along with someone else this well.
“Well, I just kinda like the atmosphere here in the morning hours before anyone has woken up yet. It’s rather peaceful, don’t you think?” Potter said. “That’s true… Makes it easier to clear your thoughts.” Draco murmured back.
“Today’s a bit… Perhaps another day would be better.” Draco tried to reason, as he would much prefer making the potion another day when Pansy could be present and occupy Potter’s time, allowing Draco to sit in peace while brewing it.
“Heh! Didn’t see that coming, did you?” Draco snickered, glad to have Potter at least half-heartedly backing him up even to his best friend.
“Yes, I was just about to apparate when I felt myself being hit with a spell. I couldn’t make out which one, and I thought I apparated before it could hit me. But now I’m not so sure I did.”
Ron Weasley croaked out, looking flabbergasted as his eyes darted between Malfoy and Potter. “What the hell?”
Potter seemed startled enough at the sudden outburst to regain his position kneeling in front of Draco.
“I like you in this kind of way” Draco said once more, feeling himself blush at having to state it so many times.
“You don’t have to strain yourself.” Now Harry’s voice just held amusement as he spoke. “You know,” he said as he leaned in and bit Draco’s ear, licking at it, and earning himself a strained moan. “I would love to watch you come all over yourself.”
“I can imagine… I didn’t have time to stop by during the week, but as I passed by it did look awfully cramped with all the people”
Draco didn’t trust his words to hold as he simply nodded. Potter leaned in closer, and Draco’s eyes fluttered shut as he waited in anticipation.
“That’s true… You just have to get past the heavy amounts of bad ideas and lack of self-preservation, and you’ve got yourself a very decent guy.” Hermione joked.
“I suppose this is something I can get used to.” Harry gently stroked Draco’s cheek as he took in his features.
“Harry is bi and that’s not something he’s been hiding. That’s why so many guys are after him too, knowing there might be a tiny chance he’ll fall for any of them. He’s also not someone who would base his love for someone on their past. If he likes you, he likes you. Simple as that!” Granger said, sipping her tea.
“Alright class, after handing in the papers from last time you’ll be dismissed!” Shrew said, and everyone started cleaning their desks and handing in the homework.
It took a moment for Draco to realise that he had muttered his thoughts out loud, and he instantly felt heat rise at the back of his neck.
Slowly, Harry pushed into Draco’s tight hole, stretching him to his limits. He felt both his and Harry’s breathing become shallow, trying to overcome the overwhelming sensations.
“Really? You’re feeling better??” Weasley looked just as surprised as Granger for a second before he masked his expression.
The only times he felt a bit sad was whenever he had to say goodbye to Harry and head home to the villa.
“Please.” Draco breathed out, the plea being drowned in a loud moan as Harry let his mouth engulf Draco’s cock, sucking on it.
“And that makes some people a bit afraid. Thinking I might actually use it for evil, despite having seen what that does.” The bitterness was clear in Potter’s voice as he spoke. “Also, the papers can basically write whatever. Or at least they could. Hermione is working on making it better, less conspiracy and more truth, that kinda thing.” Potter said, his voice more relaxed.
“Oh, you’re such a fool! Open your eyes, love.” Hermione chuckled as Ron desperately begged her to tell him what was going on.
“You’re in love with Harry?!” She yelped, having misheard him during her arrival, only making the situation so much worse.
“I was just making a play on what Ginny and Luna was going on and on about… I didn’t mean to-“ Potter started, but Draco cut him off.
“If you’re up for it, I’d like to try going a bit further” Draco looked at Harry, amazed at his resilience in such a situation.
Draco focused his attention to the chess board, trying to force the heat from rising to his cheeks. There was no way Weasley of all people would pick up on any feelings he may harbour towards Potter, he reassured himself. This was just him trying to be polite and accept Potter’s decision to let Draco even a tiny bit into his life.
Draco had been able to deal with such antics so far. However, things got a bit trickier as Potter waltzed into the shop one day at an odd hour when only Draco was working at the shop.
“Impossible…” Draco grumbled as he cracked one eye open and peered up at the figure in front of him. It took him a second before he jolted up, coming dangerously close to the person in front of him.
It was still difficult to even imagine something like this working out, but Pansy had always been good at convincing people, and that included Draco as well.
“I wouldn’t be able to survive if it wasn’t for Seb being an amazing chef” Amelia grinned, as Hermione had been roasting Ron’s severe lack in cooking skills.
He had won. The applause could be heard as Slytherin was going wild. Having lost to both Gryffindor and then Hufflepuff had been difficult. Getting a win like this would boost the whole team’s spirit to the max.
“Huh? Oh…Oh!” Draco felt himself become slightly uncomfortable as he had kinda hoped Potter would forget all about it.
“Poor darling… Maybe if you send him a letter begging him to wear one, he’ll come by and let you have a look, eh?”
“Alright.” Draco closed his eyes again. He tried searching for a memory as he had done so many times before. The memories he had tried to use had either helped making the blue sparks from his wand stronger or end up not showing sparks at all. Finding the perfect memory was harder than Draco had anticipated, and many of those he had thought would be him at his happiest, wasn’t giving the spell enough strength. He sighed inwardly, when suddenly he was confronted with a more recent memory. It just popped up before he had a chance to do anything and despite his better judgement, he let it consume his mind. He was laughing and joking with Pansy and Potter as they sat and had tea together.
“How thick are you? I’m not in love with you! Do you honestly think everyone just automatically falls in love with you cus you’re the saviour, the wonder boy?!” Draco started to rant, unable to hold back, as he realised that he himself was spouting lies, and it didn’t taste well to know that.
“Right answer. Cus that one could’ve been a deal breaker, you know.” Harry said teasingly, laughing at the wide eyes on Draco.
“Sorry…” Weasley looked worried as he patted Granger’s back carefully. “She’s feeling really nauseous from the pregnancy. Nothing’s been helping either, so I was thinking-“
“What do you-“ Draco was cut off before he could finish his sentence as Harry leaned forward and kissed him.
Potter turned to look at him for a moment. A few seconds passed as they both stood there watching each other, taking in the years that had gone by. Potter looked more mature now, more confident in his own skin. It suited him, Draco thought bitterly. He knew that on the other hand, the years had not been as good to him as they had been to Potter and he wondered what exactly Potter saw when he looked at him. He felt a tinge of heat rise to his ears as he could no longer take comfort in the superiority of his looks. Did Potter really have to take it all? Was the boy who lived so greedy that he needed to make sure Draco could never reach the same level as him? Draco felt the thoughts taking over his confidence and had to steel himself in order not to shrink under the intense green gaze.
“Exactly! I’ve always told him to talk to me if he needs to, and although he smiles at me and tells me he will, he never comes to me with any of his problems.” Hermione sighed. “I think he doesn’t want to add more to my plate, and I’m sure he must feel a bit left out now that Ron and I are together.”
“Are you sure about that? You see, your mind might be clouded from your desperation of wanting to see the best in people even when they don’t fulfil that requirement.” Draco knew he was making the situation worse. He should’ve put the device down on the desk and walked out. But he had spent too much time working on his own, having little interaction with the few people who didn’t mind him too much. Nothing of what he was used to existed around him anymore, so if only he could see a hint of the old Harry Potter once more, perhaps it would give him a sense of calmness or a sense of belonging.
“So that’s why you were so snarky against Ron earlier!” Granger said thoughtfully, finally understanding the situation.
Granger seemed satisfied with the reaction as her lips turned upwards. “So, you’re not denying it, that’s a good start at least.”
There was no way she was ever going to allow herself being late for the British bake-off show…. No way…
That was the first of many encounters where Draco was left wordless at people’s kindness and willingness to allow him back into society. More people were stopping by day after day, and at one point Pansy had agreed to working almost full time at the shop to help him. However, he no longer felt the need to scurry off into the back of the shop whenever the doorbell jingled.
“I’m thrilled.” There was definite sarcasm dripping from his words as he kept his eyes focused on the uneaten soup.
“Yes, no, I didn’t mean it like that.” Potter said, shifting slightly, Draco could now feel that Potter was looking at him, but he still kept his eyes closed. “I just…why apparate to my place? How did you even manage to do that?”
‘Then… do I… want him?’ Draco could faintly see his reflection in the glass window as it had become dark outside.
It went in easier than Draco thought it would, considering the size of it. The many times he had been fingered had definitely paid off.
“Hey! Long-time no see! How have you been?” Amelia said, sliding up beside him with Sebastian at her side.
It took Draco a moment to process why Granger was looking so overwhelmingly shocked as well as what exactly was creating said astonishment. He looked back at Potter and then it hits him. He was literally sitting in Potter’s lap with his arms clutched tightly around his neck. Even Draco found that to be a rather precarious situation to be in.
“So, you being in love with me, is-“ Potter started, but couldn’t finish before Draco’s head jerked to the side and met his eyes.
“Oh… Well, as long as everything is fine” Harry said, Draco could feel that Harry wasn’t overly convinced, but he was kind enough to let it be it seemed like.
He took in his whole length before slowly letting his lips drag upwards, letting go of his cock with a loud pop. Before Draco could protest at the lack of contact, Harry was back on him. This time he let his tongue work, sliding up and down the back of his cock, while his thumb rubbed at the slit.
How ironic that he would end up right in Potter’s lap. Was this his punishment for choosing the wrong side during the war? Did his magic really just undermine his own wishes in order to seek protection once more from the one person Draco would rather spend the rest of his life avoiding? Sure, things had changed. They were no longer kids and Potter had testified at his and his mother’s trials, making sure they didn’t go to Azkaban. It was almost impossible, even for Draco, to consider Potter a bad person. And perhaps that’s what made it all so much worse. Draco could no longer blindly follow his father’s hatred and was instead forced to see Potter for who he was. A much better person than himself. It was agitating and only helped in making Draco feel even worse about himself and his previous choices. Perhaps that was why it was so immensely difficult to be nice to Potter as well, because in a way, Draco didn’t feel like he deserved to receive any kindness in return.
“Well, continuing on where we left off, I never said you weren’t proficient in charms or DADA, I just think you were and are more suited for potions.” Pansy shrugged, enjoying Draco’s current discomfort.
Draco felt himself freeze up for a second. Not in his wildest dreams had he ever expected to see a Weasley step foot into his shop. It didn’t help that the current Weasley wasn’t exactly a big fan of his.
“Harry, Look! I found a location that might be linked to the case!” The door was slammed open and the tension broke as both turned to look at the intruder.
“Then it’s a date! See you tomorrow” Harry smiled, and Draco could only look flustered as Amelia was now standing within hearing distance and was giving him some weird wiggles with her eyebrows. Perhaps it was a way of cheering him on? Draco didn’t know.
Pansy sighed, already showing signs of defeat before starting. As they walked over, Draco saw Abbott join in from the side giving Pansy a supportive smile and handing her one of the ingredients she was gathering. Pansy had apparently managed to form a bit of friendship with the Hufflepuff already.
“It’s fine, we’re just about to clean up anyway.” Potter said as he had just been cleaning of the table when Hermione dropped by.
“If you don’t turn that page soon, I’m gonna get seriously worried.” Draco jerked his head up and was met with Blaise’s scrutinizing eyes.
He felt a burning sensation as a finger entered him slowly. Although Draco could see the desire burning in Harry’s eyes, he also noted how Harry kept looking at him making sure he wasn’t hurting him.
“I see… Well, I should probably get a bit more familiar with how everything works around here” Draco said back, knowing he had taken very little interest in the small town since he moved here.
“Seems like you’re a bigger issue than Weasley.” Draco scowled. “Careful, wouldn’t want to harm your own body, would you?” It was provoking Draco to see how easily Potter could make him flare up, while he himself remained composed no matter what and was seemingly having fun with the little quarrel.
He wanted to decline the offer of a shower, based on the weirdness of it, but the thought of having to sit in his already wet clothes seemed less favourable at this point.
He felt a knee grace his under the table, and he looked up to see Harry looking at him with a hint of worry in his eyes. He must’ve made an expression as he was lost in his thoughts. Through the loud bickering of Ron and Blaise about quidditch teams, he mouthed an ‘You okay?’ Draco lightly pressed his knee into Harry’s and smiled, giving him a quick wink.
“I’m fairly certain I know which ingredients are needed to counteract the one’s you used, although I’m not completely sure about the first vial one.” She said as she skimmed through a few other potion books to make sure of her deductions.
“How many vials?” Draco grabbed lavender and valerian sprigs before heading into one of the storages and getting the rest of the ingredients. He neatly put them down and started working on the potion.
“I’m only here to address the truth.” Draco snickered before turning on his heel and heading into the locker room.
“Draco…” Harry gasped. “I need to -ah- can I move?” Draco knew it must’ve been difficult to keep himself still. He appreciated how Harry wouldn’t move before getting a reply even when he was shaking.
“I’m… I’m sorry….” Draco managed to stutter out before turning around and quickly making his way for the door.
“You already know that I’m not completely innocent, so it would be foolish not to be pointing a wand at you.” Draco scowled. “And I didn’t ask you to save me, now did I?”
Draco thought for moment, trying to systematically go through the previous days. He had been so deprived of sleep that some of the days felt more like blurs than anything else.
Harry sat back down besides Draco and started chatting away about what had happened during the two weeks they hadn’t met. It mostly revolved around work and the many people that was ordering from the bakery from various different towns.
“I’m sorry.” Pansy sighed again. “I’ll try not to intervene too much. How about you just see where things go for now? He’s not a bad guy, you know.” She muttered.
Draco felt himself catching his breath and his words falter into a low mumble of nothing as Potter had walked up to him and proceeded to wrap his arms around his waist.
His father had said something about making it look more ‘homely’ in order for more people to want to work with them. It was perhaps a good business tactic, Draco thought, but to him it didn’t really matter. He was just glad to be able to escape the big cities where he had spent most of his life.
Harry slid in surprisingly smoothly. Draco felt a slight burn, but nothing compared to what he thought he would feel from it. Slowly and steadily he felt himself being filled up to the brim.
Draco had taken notice before of quite a few girls seemingly having their eyes on Harry. Many of them made some seriously obvious passes at the guy, but somehow, he seemed rather unaffected by it all.
As he realised what she meant he sighed and turned back to the microscope. “Haven’t anyone taught you to knock before entering?” Draco said in a boring voice, unsure as to why they were even having this conversation.
“I’m beat! I don’t remember the speech ever being that long.” Pansy complained as they were heading back to the common room.
“Even then.” Harry chuckled, smiling warmly at Draco. It was too wonderful of a smile, Draco thought.
That evening Draco sat with his legs crossed in his bed as he finished up some of his overdue homework, when Potter broke the silence. “Tell me… When you were in my body, did you experience any nightmares that were mine?”
“Don’t you like me as well?” Harry gave him a look full of hope and desperation. Draco could feel himself having trouble resisting the guy in front of him. He looked so vulnerable and… cute…?
“Having done one ‘heroic’ deed that was forced upon me doesn’t mean I’m capable of absolutely everything.” Draco felt himself scoff loudly at that. Had the great Potter just diminished the importance of defeating the dark lord to just a small ‘heroic’ deed?
The next day Draco was still considering heading home straight after work, but before he could make good on that promise to himself, his phone beeped.
“G-Granger is fine.” The words were stuttered out and Draco saw how Granger glanced at Potter with tremendous confusion written all over her face. “How in the name of Merlin did this happen?”
Draco was a bit taken aback by the friendliness of this stranger who seemed to be around his own age. That would indicate she was more than aware of the past and should know who she was currently talking to. “I’m glad to hear that. I was helping a friend at first, but word must’ve gone out as I’ve been swamped with orders of it now.”
Draco learned, to his glee, that Potter actually did have things that he was absolute shite at. And after just two rounds, Weasley groaned and resigned to the idea that any other player would be better than Potter.
He guessed it was about five months now since the few remaining death eaters out there had turned their eyes towards him. He was, after all, a traitor who hadn’t stood by Voldemort until the bitter end. Draco had lost everything after the war. Once the trials were over, he and his mother had travelled to France in order to avoid the contemptuous looks from every wizard and witch alive. It had been alright in France for a couple of years. He and his mother had mostly lived on the money they had left, which was far less than they thought. The ministry had sealed off most of their values and vaults, making it difficult to continue living without working. Narcissa had managed to find some work at a local flower shop getting by on her own and rebuilding her life again. Draco, on the other hand, had a harder time adjusting to the work life in France. He had then made the idiotic decision to return to England.
“Sorry, I’m just tired.” Draco said, trying to mimic Potter’s usually soft and calm tone. It proved more difficult than he had expected.
“Why bring up the past, Malfoy. If you go around talking like that people might misunderstand, I don’t suppose you’re that foolish.” Potter had seemingly abandoned his work as he was now crossing his arms as regarding him over the distance between them.
Ginny apparently had managed to get whiff of her brother being at Harry’s place, and had dragged Luna with her to watch the whole show. The disappointment was clear on her face when she stumbled through the Floo and saw that the drama was already over.
“I’m not about to obsess over the guy and stalk him through every single news outlet, you know. And I told you I would take those feelings towards him with me to the grave.” Draco had been fairly adamant about that thought up until now. But after having met Potter again after such a long time, it was difficult not to give in to it even just a tiny bit.  “Also, he wasn’t wearing an Auror uniform when he came here, so how would I know.” Draco said defensively, trying to shrug it off.
Now was a little bit different though. Just by hanging onto Potter’s body, Draco realised that he unexpectedly seemed like the scrawny one. The years after the trial had been difficult to deal with, and it had also affected his appetite greatly. It was infuriating to see their roles reversed like this.
The small quirk of Potter’s lips was an answer in itself, and Draco once again went back to flailing dangerously. Luckily, they were now in the downstair living room, so the concern with being dropped wasn’t bad enough to refrain Draco from trying his best to get away.
“It’s not right, I know I’m the last to say anything considering our past, but things have changed now, and you shouldn’t need to go through something like this every day.” Potter had sat down and was looking at him intently. It felt weird being stared down by your own eyes.
The day had been extremely hectic. It seemed like everyone wanted to buy some chocolate in the nick of time. Although there had been quite a few customers throughout the week, there were still a bunch of people who came in on Valentine’s day.
“Do you still think I won’t be turned on by you?” Harry glanced at Draco with a smile threatening to form.
After being informed of what type of spell it could most likely be and the symptoms Potter was showing Draco got to work. He could see that Potter wasn’t doing too good. Despite his best efforts in hiding any discomforts. Draco had, after all, studied Potter throughout years which made him more than capable of noticing when the saviour wasn’t feeling alright.
“Already thought about it, but it just doesn’t make sense for anyone to want to put you through that.” Draco muttered back, as he lay on his bed, flicking his wand between his fingers.
“Usually people don’t stop and stare though.” Draco felt awfully small, despite him being slightly taller, as Potter’s gaze and close proximity kept him glued to the wall behind him.
“But I do have this potion I got from Hannah. It will help ease the pain to an extent, making it possible for you two to have a bit more distance between you. Although, I must warn you. It’ll most likely let you get into different rooms on the same floor of the house without both of you crouching over in pain. However, the magic keeping you two together is strong, so it’ll still feel fairly painful.”
“Yeah, thank you ‘Mione.” Potter said giving her a hug before she stepped into the fire and disappeared.
“Great!” Granger looked much more optimistic now after hearing his blatant lies. “I’m looking forward to it.” Draco couldn’t know for sure whether or not she was spitting lies herself at this point, as he gave her a confused look. She just smiled warmly before leaving the room.
“That’s too unfair.” Draco breathed as he traced Harry’s defined muscles. “What is?” Harry said, earning himself a scoff from Draco at his obliviousness.
“Definitely!” Hermione seemed to have calmed herself down enough to sound certain as she spoke. “Hang in there for the night, and it’ll be back to the way it was tomorrow. I’ll discuss these findings with Hannah, and we’ll figure this out, I promise.”
“Say… You seem rather worried yourself. Is it because of Harry?” Weasley didn’t look up as he spoke. His eyes focusing solely on the chess pieces in front of him.
Draco felt himself shudder as Harry started kissing his neck and collarbone. He lifted his head giving more space for Harry to explore.
“I merely answered your questions, Potter.” His gaze faltered slightly in the face of Potter’s own intense gaze. “Only trying to be civil.” Draco murmured.
With a swift move, Draco closed the gap between them and gave Harry a kiss. It was incredible, making it feel like it lasted for much longer than it actually did.
Pansy scowled at him before grabbing her own potion book as well. She sighed before setting her eyes at Draco like he was the next prey. “Hey there pretty boy, are you in for a trade?” Draco knew that tone she was using, and it usually meant something bad coming his way.
Before another word could be uttered, Hermione’s attention was drawn towards the cauldron. “Look!” She said excitedly. “It’s changed colour!” Draco peered into the cauldron, and it was indeed a different colour. It had taken the form of a deep purple.
“I know you do. That’s why I’m trying so hard to help you. I just… I get so excited whenever things are going in the right direction that I sometimes get ahead of myself. I want you to be happy, that’s all. Merlin knows you deserve it.” She sighed, slumping down on one of the chairs.
“Right.” Draco breathed, he was still processing the sensations of coming and being filled up. It was something he had never experienced before. Something that felt too addictive.
Pansy shifted a bit indicating that she clearly had something to say but couldn’t quite figure out how to go about it. Finally, she decided to speak. “How… If you don’t mind me asking… How did the trials go?” Her voice was hushed as if she feared that anyone could be listening through the solid walls separating them from the rest of the students.
“From my own experience, I can tell you that it did help quite a bit.” Harry traced his fingers along Draco’s arm as he spoke in a silent voice.
“How dare you suggest I’m less handsome?!” He gave Potter a pointed look, which in turn just made Potter laugh loudly, the awkwardness quickly dissipating.
“They only need to understand you more, Malfoy. If you would let more people in, then I’m sure it would make it easier. You should try getting along with Ron and Hermione, they are good people and they won’t be too unreasonable if you give them a chance.”
“Eh? I…What? It’s not like I’ve never had any interest, it’s just that no one made me feel any kind of love”
“We came to the conclusion that finding a potion that could turn you two back was impossible. So, we decided to brew it ourselves!” Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit of pride at the work he and Hermione had put into this. If it did work, then they would’ve created a brand-new potion from scratch. That was pretty amazing in itself, sadly they wouldn’t be able to put it on their resume’s considering the circumstances.
He sat down on the stool next to a table housing five cauldrons. The aroma and soft bubbling of potions brewing were soothing and able to slightly calm his anxious mind.
“Yeah, I added homemade gingerbread on the bottom of it. I thought it would be perfect for the holiday season” Harry grinned.
“I would normally be offended for not knowing about it, but I can’t help being grateful for it right now.” Draco huffed out, his lips quirking upwards.
“Yes, I suppose I can see why dating anyone would be tedious for him. I would hate to never know for sure whether something would end up in the papers or not.”
“I’m just average at it, really.” Draco said, feeling slightly proud at the compliment and not being able to be overly humble about it either.
Draco felt his cheeks get red before he even uttered a single word. “If you let me win…” Draco started slowly, his eyes darting over the pitch before settling on Harry with determination. “I’ll give you a free pass to do whatever you want with me. No complaints.”
“Yes, I’m not dumb, Potter. Why the hell are you asking me? If this is some sort of joke, then it is in very poor favour.” Draco could never know what exactly Potter was thinking, and this could very well be some sort of cruel payback for all the times he had tormented Potter during school.
Before it had been a much easier task to avoid Potter, but now it had become tedious. Pansy and Blaise had decided to sit with Hermione, Weasley and Potter whenever they were in the great hall. This resulted in Draco having to do the same.
He wouldn’t make it in time, he knew that. Still, he threw himself forward trying to grab onto his wand just as a crucio was directed at him.
“Why?” Harry looked alarmed as he took in the worried look on Draco’s face, thinking something right here and now was frightening the man in front of him.
“Put it in.” The demand was weak and barely a whisper. “You sure?” Once more, Draco couldn’t help but feel himself relax at Harry’s calm demeanour and how he kept to Draco’s pace at all times.
The other Aurors on Harry’s team was quick to join in and Draco could barely pick out some red hair flowing to his left as Ginny sent a spell that made a Death Eater fall to the ground with a scream. Ron was there too, and two others that Draco didn’t know who were. The Death Eaters didn’t stand a chance after coming face to face with the number one team of Aurors surrounding them.
“I can’t promise you I’ll feel the same as you do, but I like you… I like you a lot. I don’t want to end it just like this without even having tried. I was just too surprised at the party, and I never considered myself being able to love a guy, but who knows. I might actually realise what I really feel if I give it a shot”.
“How the hell would Malfoy winning be something that would make Harry happy?” Ron furrowed his brows and sighed in exasperation.
“Oh wow… I didn’t mean to stay for this long” Draco said, feeling a bit bummed out for having to end the conversation. Just casually getting to know someone and not feeling like there were any ulterior motives behind it was refreshing.
“Don’t worry, I’m sure he’ll be thrilled with whatever you give him. Just find something you think he’ll like, and I’m sure he’ll love it”.
“You didn’t stop to question whether or not I did it because I wanted to? It’s not always someone would need a reason to do bad stuff, Harry.” Draco said, a bit agitated that Harry was so utterly convinced about him not being a bad person. The faith Harry had in him shouldn’t be that strong.
“Still… We’re sorry…” Pansy said, she had a grim look on her face. He knew full well how much Pansy and Blaise cared for him. They were his best friends and they had tried to help him, tried to find a way to get him out of it all. However, it had been to no use. He had been too far gone at that point. The only thing that got him through it at the end was the chacne of saving his mother and his desperate hope that Potter would claw his way through it all and come out victorious.
“Look, if you can’t stand someone then look the other way. We’re here to study for our N.E.W.T.s. not bicker about something we can’t change.” Blaise sighed, not liking to be the confrontational type.
“I mean, you’ve known him for many years, but it’s only recently that you’ve been properly hanging out with him and sharing a room with him. Have it changed your view on him at all?” Hermione gazed at him with a look that only showed an honest interest in the topic, nothing else.
“Thank you! I would, of course, appreciate it if she becomes as selfless and kind as her father, however I suppose I’d rather her liking homework than being unable to look at a paper for more than 10 seconds before getting ill, like a particular someone.”
