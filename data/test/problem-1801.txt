In his dreams now he would wake, and turn around to embrace Harry, but instead of finding him as he was, he found him as a mangled body, ripped, shrunken organs and face that was no face at all.  It was terrifying. Both the idea of having lost him again, and the thought (the fear) that he would have to see his corpse one more time.
and Draco surveyed the dishes she had left behind.  She had done a good job: there was bread and fruit, eggs prepared in 4 different ways, sausages, beans, waffles, pancakes, muffins, and many different pots of tea.
When they reached the clearing, he took off the cloak at last.  He was well dressed, his hair combed, his teeth minty fresh. As she looked him over, he could see the gleam of pride in her eyes.  He took in her appearance as well and spotted a cloth bag tucked against the lining of her cloak.  She pulled it out and handed it to him.
They were in a meeting together, and he sat as far away from him as politeness would dictate.  He had stayed quiet all meeting long, in his beautiful new indigo robes, the trimmings golden in the firelight. He had just been admiring the sleeves when the Dark Lord asked him a question.
“Okay.”
He ran out of his room, not caring that he was only wearing underwear, not caring that there was blood on him.  With his lit wand ahead of him he dashed through the hallways, his ancestors in their portraits shouting after him.  When he reached his parent’s bedroom door, he pounded at it, loud enough to wake the dead.
“I have much to say, my Lord,” her voice was steady and smooth, as if she were addressing a dinner party and not presiding over the probable death of her entire family.  “We have made many mistakes.  Draco was mistaken in bringing that boy back, and I was mistaken in letting him keep such a creature in our home-” her tone and eyes sharpened, a tinge of anger present in both.  “It was nothing against you, my Lord, we are devoted servants.”  Draco knew her enough to be  sure that if she were not bound, she would be bowing to the ground but instead she merely lowered her eyes, staring at where the Dark Lord’s robes dragged on the floor.  “Our mistakes have not been of faith; they have been of love.  And it is for that which we should be punished.  We have never, for one moment, wavered from our devotion to you.”
“All I want is your happiness, my love,” she said, and she kissed each of his cheeks.  “I will try to help him any way I can.  I will try to extend this for you, but it won’t be forever.”
To this Harry leaned forward and kissed him.  “It’s not my favorite thing.” He repeated.
Throwing caution to the wind he magicked the door of the library open and shouted for Narcissa.  “It’s gonna be fine,” he assured Harry, his hand feeling the boy’s thighs.  “It’s probably just temporary, a spasm or something-” his tone was not convincing, it was panicked and they both knew it.   He turned to the door again and shouted for her.  “Mum will know what to do-” he said, although those words, foolish and hopeful as they were, were ultimately empty.
Although he felt neither tired nor hungry he knew that he should.  He had been neglecting his physical needs for a long time.  He sat cross legged on the cave floor and summoned bread from his bag.  He ate without tasting it, his mouth dry and crumbs rolling down his dirty robes.  He summoned wine next, and then drank it straight from the bottle.  He could only imagine the look of horror on Lucius’s face if he could see him now: wet and filthy, on the floor of a cave, crumbs on lap, and chugging his very expensive  1956 Château Lafite like a hobo who didn’t know any better.
He summoned the knife.  It was a family heirloom, of course, more than two centuries old and probably never used.  The Malfoys were not big on bloodshed, his father liked to call this a “ceremonial” knife.  The sheath was encrusted with rubies, but the knife itself was intricately carved ivory, white and pale as his fingertips.  He gripped it in his right hand and just for a moment closed his eyes.
Harry looked at him.  “It’s not my favorite thing.”
Draco sat up and looked crossly at his mother.  “But what happened? Is that the end of the story?”
“You’re lying,” it was the first words that came to him, and they came without him taking any time to think.
“Is he going to be okay?”
She beamed.  “Do you want to hear about Great Aunt Cassiopeia sinking submarines during the second muggle war?”
Draco struggled against Selwyn. He wanted to rush to Harry, to help him somehow.  He looked so small like that, so vulnerable, the four black figures towering over him. There was already blood dribbling out of his mouth.
There was laughter again and Draco hung his head.  She was trying to save him, he could appreciate that, but the words still stung.  Was there anything she could say to get them out of this situation?  Had she planned for this contingency?  Was she prepared for it?
He remained over the open sarcophagus for a long time, his mind muddled.  He felt an immense clash within himself.  A clash between the madness of his mother’s family, and the control of his father’s.  Between the path he should have taken long, long ago and the one that he was now considering.  But most of all he felt the clash of all of his desires, all of his dreams for the future.  He wanted this – with whatever consequences would follow – he wanted this dark power, and he wanted Harry, desperately, urgently, maddeningly.  But part of him also wanted something else – some impossible alternative where he could turn back time and start clean, start fresh, do everything over and do it correctly.  And yet another part of him, a pure Slytherin portion, wanted only the future his father had so carefully crafted.  Wanted only to grow strong by Voldemort’s side,  to continue cleansing the wizarding population, to cement a name for himself that all would bow before.
Narcissa came with a start, at her own pace.  Her eyes cold.
Voldemort laughed.  “Is that still what you call me Draco? I am surprised.”
“Many people have sought it, my own father among them, but nobody has found it yet-”  she was quiet for a moment, and then she added.  “It would take a very great and very clever wizard to find Cepheus’s grave, don’t you think?”
Harry opened his eyes, staring first at Narcissa and then at Draco beside him.
“I’m fine,” he said, in a tone that was quick and automatic, and a lie.
They went outside every day now.  They made their way through the house, Draco pointing out every portrait and explaining how he was related to them, while his elders sneered and rolled their eyes.  They took books from his father’s library to entertain themselves at night and read them out loud to each other by wand light.  He suddenly craved pudding, and turkey, and wanted his eggs scrambled instead of sunny side up.  Every single time he asked for something Draco felt greater satisfaction in what he had done.  It didn’t feel so selfish anymore.  It wasn’t about him needing Potter, it was about them both needing each other, and now he was sure of it.
“You’re wrong-” his voice shook noticeably.
He wanted the process to be quick.  He wanted only to read a spell and have Harry back with him again.  But of course, this was not to be.  He sighed and sat down on the grass, resting against a tree trunk as he pulled out his translator.
“Hi mum.”
Lucius frowned.  Maybe there was something wrong with him too.
“Harry,” he whispered, tentatively.  He wanted a response, illogical as that was.  “Harry?”  He paused again, but he couldn’t hear anything, not the wind, or the sea, or his would-be friend.  He was alone.   He turned onto his stomach on the bed, burying his head in one of the pillows.
“I think it’s important for young men to see the world a little, to travel.  It was important for you, wasn’t it?”
They would be lying in bed together, the sun barely rising, and then next moment he would be at the dinner table, listening to her talk about Rockwood’s new wife.  His days were all mixed up, and time itself was behaving strangely, as if it had all gotten moved around.  Sometimes, one morning led to another morning, while other days he felt like he had been asleep for weeks.
“He did.  He was the most powerful wizard of his age, maybe the most powerful wizard to ever live.  He was a master at killing, and he became in time a master of death too.  He came up with a counterpart spell for Avada Kedavra.  A spell to breath life back into the dead.”
He had read the entirety of the Black Chronicles several times by now, and although he had yet to taste any success, he had the strangest feeling that it was coming, that he was getting closer and closer to it (to something).  It was difficult to place, or to understand, but Draco was certain that it was his destiny to succeed where his ancestors had failed.
He felt filthy in his clothes, and one by one stripped them off, leaving them puddled on the floor.  He got into bed in only his underwear and, at once, Harry moved towards him, as if drawn by his warmth.  He lay his arms around his waist, both facing the same wall, Harry’s head positioned right at the crook of his neck and shoulder.  “Who was that?”
He straightened up when he finished and looked over his shoulder.  Narcissa was just where he had left her, still in that black cloak that was blending more and more into the background with every passing moment.  “You should leave,” he told her.
His head was pounding, and he was covered in cold sweat.  This was a nightmare.  “I-” he croaked the word.  He would never be able to admit it, not in front of all these men.
He did not want to see this.  He could not stand to see it.  Not again.  There was a horrible gut churning noise of flesh being hit and then he put his arms over his head.  He wanted to tune it all out.  To be elsewhere.  But where?  Where would he possibly go? Even if he could get away, what would be the point if he and Harry were not together.
Harry opened his mouth and a gurgle of blood came out.
In another of her letters Narcissa mentioned that a few of his school fellows had come to see him at the Manor. Among them Goyle and Pansy.  They, of course, couldn’t know what he was up to, and his mother was not foolish enough to confide in them.  But she had written that they missed him, and that Pansy, especially, was concerned since she had not seen him since the Battle.
The Death Eaters roared and hooted, like children eager to beat a piñata.
She observed him with her grey eyes, chin slightly raised.  She had the ability of making him feel small, childish, like he could still run into her arms and weep on her sleeve.  “May I come back tomorrow?”
Even his parents, as much as it hurt to say so, had never really loved him.  Would they have loved him if he weren’t a Slytherin? If he hadn’t had a pureblood girlfriend? If he hadn’t been a great student? All of these conditions were requirements for their continuing affection and support. Take them away and no, his parents did not love him.
“Like your body is numb?”
“Are you? Do you hurt?”
Sweating in his bed, he relieved year after year, altercation after altercation.  They had so much history together, and there had been so many opportunities for one of them to turn the tide. What would have happened if, instead of running away during their detention together in the Forbidden Forest, Draco had stayed with him? Would the fear have bonded them, as fear has a way of doing? What if Draco had approached him in second year and asked him how he became a parselmouth like he had wanted to?  Would that have led to an argument, or to an actual honest conversation between them?
Draco slid to his knees on the dungeon floor.  He stared at the blank wall in front of him, nausea rising up from the pit of his stomach.  He was sick all over himself, gagging and hurling, the sounds monstrous in the echoing chamber.  And for a long time afterwards he stayed right there, filthy and empty.  Something had gone terribly wrong.  He was living and Harry Potter was dead and that was simply not how things were supposed to go.
It didn’t escape Draco’s notice that he was already speaking in past tense.
“Dumbledore always had this ridiculous notion that love was the greatest power on earth-” began the Dark Lord, in a voice that was almost droll.  “That love could conquer anything, even death-” he chuckled and so did the Death Eaters who followed his lead.  “But look what love has done-” he gestured around the room, to his mother's corpse, standing like a statue, to his father on the floor like an infant, to Harry or the bits that remained of him burned and butchered, and to Draco, clinging to the Dark Lord’s robes, literally begging for death with every bit of strength left in him.
Sometimes he was not even sure when he was dreaming and when he was awake.
“I don’t know-” she answered, her eyes on Draco rather than Harry.  “I can’t have you running around and cursing your father.”
He did not know how much blood the average human had, but this looked like
“Yeah,” he pulled out his wand and summoned the invisibility cloak from his room.  It zoomed towards them.  If Narcissa was right, if their time really was limited, then he wasn’t gonna deny Harry anything.
Then I raised it.
But maybe Harry didn’t have an undercover role. After all, he was parading around the base with nary a precaution. Draco had watched as Harry exchanged a brief joke with an officer, clapped a private comradely on the back. Harry appeared well-liked here.
Another mystery to investigate.
It made sense, I told myself. He was my guest. Don’t think too much of it.
“They’re the heads of past house-elves,” Potter said shortly. “We tried removing them, but they’re stuck on the wall with Permanent Sticking Charms.”
“I didn’t do much.”
I was not sure what I expected when it came to her office. Her assistant at the front gave us a polite nod as we walked in.
“You were scanned by at least five different systems before you stepped onto this floor,” Malfoy said. “What? Did you think I’d just let anyone waltz into my home?”
“I should return to HQ,” Harry said finally. He extricated himself from further conversation with Fudge, who looked disappointed that Harry was leaving. The reporters had finished with the other opera-goers and the junior officers and were finally making their way past Fudge’s security. “Shacklebolt will want a full report.”
I hung my head. I did. “Can it wait until after all this is over?” I asked with a small smile. “I think we have a lot on our plate right now. I’m not sure I would be able to handle the conversation while my life hung in the balance.”
“How am I suppose tell what it is from the hundreds of junk that’s in here?”
“I’ve been busy,” I said mulishly. “You didn’t just Firecall to make fun of me, did you?”
“Voldemort was unwieldy,” the librarian said, stretching out the name with distaste. “He was too deep in his megalomania to be of use in the end. He would have been the most suitable candidate for the key, being the actual Heir of Slytherin.”
“Malfoy! What are you doing up so early? You’re usually still in bed at this time.” He replaced the newspaper on the table. His hair was still wet from his shower, and there was a faint outline in his grey joggers that could only be –
“That and I heard you offer a good deal,” Draco said, rather sharply. Bringing all that old business up rather upset his plan of a charm offensive, but this burst of reality seemed to have clinched the deal.
“We don’t need his cooperation at this moment,” Dolohov said. “And your methods are perhaps too amateurish to do much. No offense,” he added at Greyback’s scowl. “We want his willing help, not somebody broken.”
“I would’ve brought it over to you, you know,” I said without turning. I sat down on the barstool. It was cool against my bare buttocks. Belatedly, I realized I was still naked.
“A fraction of our drug running and cyber distribution activities  have caught the attention of the FBI and the NSA,” Wormtail said. “The information the Chinese provided lists the operatives that have somehow embedded themselves. We have taken the steps to plug the leaks.”
“Hello, Draco.” They greeted each other with air kisses. “I haven’t seen you in a while.”
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask what those differences were, but my self-control checked me just in time. In any case, there were more pressing matters to deal with.
I knew, without even hearing it, what kind of protection he was casting. It was powerful and difficult to penetrate — I would not be able to do it on my own. But I did not need to: I had Potter on my side.
My father snorted. “Anyone with a proper education knows of it. And don’t be idiotic. Of courses I haven’t seen it.”
Granger had been watching our exchange silently. “Oh, you should go, Harry. They’re quite fun sometimes. Free food and booze, and you have the pleasure to see distinguished professors making a fool out of themselves when they’re drunk.”
Harry released him. Fletcher fell forward with a choked gasp. Massaging his neck, he looked angrily at both Draco and Harry. “I’m just a humble man trying to make a living in a hard world. No need to use such force.”
Potter stayed silent. Then he said: “Me too.”
He watched the two with a faint expression of distaste, surveying them as one would upon a mess to be cleaned.
Whatever it was, Harry had abandoned him. Somehow, that was what spurred Draco into action. It snapped Draco into autopilot; Draco reentered the house and grabbed his coat, thanking his hosts and begging to borrow a phone to call a cab. He’d be damned if he stayed a second longer, and Harry had been the one to drive them. If Draco didn’t have other matters on his mind, he’d be enraged at how Harry had taken the car with him too.
It was hard to not worry about Harry. He had been in poor spirits ever since they returned to London.
“Smells amazing.” My stomach rumbled. “Though I never did manage to acquire a taste for black pudding.”
A fragment of a soul? I snorted. “Potter, you’ve been reading too many novels. You’re describing a Horcrux. That’s ridiculous. No one had made one since the fifteenth century.”
Draco stared at Fletcher, every line of his body tight. “In my experience everything is negotiable.”
“He’s going to miss breakfast at this rate,” I said. I did not particularly want to dwell on what my mother said. “Should we have an elf fetch him?” I did not particularly want that either, but I would be a poor host if I let my guest starve.
He nuzzled my neck as he set down his glass. “I’ve been busy,” he said.
Malfoy ran his hands up and down his arms. “Thank you, Potter, for that most insightful advice.”
“We have to go,” Potter shouted over the noise; the sound of wood cracking ominously rang around us, and I was struggling to breathe in enough oxygen.
“Harry, look out!”
“Yes, but even with that, you can do more good than as a private individual chasing down lost cats and cheating spouses.” This seemed to be an old argument they were replaying. I listened with barely disguised fascination.
I stared at the mess, eyes not seeing. Despite his unexpected kindness and his surprising acceptance of me, Potter was still as different from me as day from night. I already owed too much to him. No matter how much I wanted him, I could not let myself become entangled any further.
Hedwig’s voice intruded. One vehicle matches the parameters set, she informed him. Permission to display enhanced visuals.
Harry laughed. “Come on. I want some breakfast and coffee before we go exploring dark caves for long-lost books.”
His father had been right about Rosier being a poor writer, shrouding his analysis and thesis in obtuse academese that left the mind boggled. After several readings of it, however, Draco finally understood what it was saying.
“Come here often, do you?” Draco didn’t do so well in keeping the note of jealousy out of his voice.
“What happened? Harry!” Granger’s voice demanded. She pushed through a ring of onlookers that I just now noticed. “Why aren’t any of you lot helping?”
His T-shirt was too big on me, Potter being rather broader than I in the shoulders. I had more space in the arms than I was used to. His jeans were looser than I was used to, hanging a little baggy around my waist. Potter must be joking. Or he needed new lens prescriptions.
“Not with Draco here bent on living his unnatural lifestyle,” my father said. He gave me a dark look. “It’s fine when you’re young, but you’re not anymore. As a Malfoy, you have responsibilities to fulfill.”
“I like defying the odds,” he said. “And you keep apologizing to me. You don’t need to, you know. It’s putting me off.”
“I mean different, Potter.” Malfoy turned to Harry. “This schematic is not the same as the one on file with the Unspeakables.”
“Okay, fine, you can come with us,” Potter interrupted loudly. “As long as you don’t try to teach us any more history and listen to everything I or Hermione tells you. Got that?”
In addition to his poor mood, Harry’s appetite also increased, to the point where he was eating twice as much per meal every day.
“No,” I said, fluffing up my pillow. “Thank you.”
And it left me surprised. Of all the ones, they’d have the most reason to hate us, considering what they suffered and our mutual antagonism at school. But Saint Potter and his friends were too good for grudges, arguing instead that we, the children of his enemies, were as much victim as anyone else.
Draco jumped away from Riddle, who careened blindly, the Shield and Decoder and lamp clattering to the floor. The lamp bulb shattered, pitching the room into black. It made the noises of struggle more wrenching to listen to, but Draco forced himself to ignore them – he kicked out at the antiques, sending them skidding across the room. At the same time, he aimed a blow at Riddle – no need to fumble blindly in the dark, Riddle’s hoarse agonized voice was a beckon. A thud and Riddle stopped, the wail cutting off from as Riddle fell unconscious.
“Do you have any other details?” she peered at me. “I mean … a man with a cloak who doesn’t like you … that doesn’t quite narrow it down.” She gave me a lopsided grin. “You know you have a way with people.”
“I need to speak with your bosses,” Harry said.
You’re not a Death Eater, Draco,” Potter said quietly. I started at the use of my given name. “You might’ve taken the Mark, but you never were a Death Eater.”
Weasley seemed surprised at Draco’s question.
“Nah,” he said. “Most of those bastards went to the front, and Hermione and I were more than able to deal with the ones who came from the back.”
“Oh. It’s you.” Somehow Draco wasn’t surprised to see him. “Why aren’t you sleeping?”
It was with a titanic effort that Draco managed to pull his mind back from the bog.
“That’s impossible!” Ron jumped up, glaring at Malfoy. “Malfoy, your computer’s sprouting nonsense.” He glared at Harry. “And you – why are you here listening to him anyways? You know we don’t sell to bigoted fascists.”
More accurately, it was an explosion which set off a chain reaction of dust erupting. It took a good time minutes before Draco could breathe properly.
Harry made a sudden movement.
“My friend here doesn’t like you,” Draco said, and on cue, Harry inched menacingly towards Fletcher. “I wouldn’t recommend provoking him.”
“Well, if you must know, Potter, I am the owner of the Leaky Cauldron.”
“I know someone who can sail us to the location.” Draco leaned back into his seat. The thrill of making a discovery overlooked by the world for thousands of years was electrifying. Draco barely held himself back from telling the pilot to fly faster.
“Are you done?” Granger was unimpressed. “I’m not out here to gloat – there’s nothing for me to gloat about. There’s nothing for any of us to gloat about. We care about Harry and Harry cares about you, so by extension your wellbeing matters to us, whether we like it or not. Now get your arse back inside before I drag you in myself.”
“I know what a laptop is,” I said quickly. “Some of the Muggleborn scholars use them. It’s nifty, though I don’t think I’ll ever be able to figure one it.” And I wondered at myself – the younger me would never have deigned to even look at a Muggleborn, let alone listen to one explain how a computer worked.
All right, Harry agreed reluctantly. He didn’t see the point of fiddling with his brain chemistry for something so minor, but he trusted Hedwig to keep track of the levels released.
Dolohov chuckled. “Oh, you will, one way or another. It doesn’t matter whether you help with this or not. We have other experts that can verify the object’s provenance.”
“No time,” Draco said. He didn’t elaborate further. “I think we might be in the right place.”
“Tell us about your research, Draco,” he said. “You’re looking at artifacts now. What does that entail? Any old objects? You can start with the Manor, you know. We have objects that dates back to when our ancestor came over with the Conqueror.”
“I’ll send Kreacher to the Manor,” Potter said. “He can organize the elves to put out the fire. And I’ll contact Hermione as soon as I’m sure you’re alright.”
Draco didn’t know how to ask. He avoided conversations like these with a ten-feet pole. And he worried that he was part of the reason why Harry seemed so unreadable these days.
“This isn’t going to work,” I said, ducking under my counter and pulling Potter, the brave idiot, with me. He had been standing, trying to get another shot in. “His Shield’s too strong.”
“We just want to talk,” Harry said. “Talk and figure out the truth.”
“No, it’s the only smart thing you’ve said so far that makes sense, Potter.” Malfoy shifted in his seat.
“Hello Lucius,” Harry gave my father a curt nod. “Narcissa.” His greeting to my mother was far warmer. “How are you?”
The scabbed-over scar that was my Dark Mark itched, as it usually did whenever I thought about the War. I had thought of – and tried – various methods to rid myself of it, from a glamour to a Muggle technique known as laser removal, but none worked. There was no point; even without it, everyone still knew who I was and what I had done.
Draco wanted to retort that nothing had been wrong until Harry broke their relationship, but he couldn’t steel his heart to do so. Instead, he laid his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Tom wouldn’t give you a spiked drink. Would you, Tom?” Malfoy asked the wizened man behind the counter.
“How many do you see out there?” Weasley asked, locking his rifle.
“Hmm.” Malfoy raked an eye over Harry. Despite himself, Harry couldn’t help but grow warm under the once-over. “This about your bio-enhancement parts? You’re due for an upgrade. And your SI … she’s evolved well, but there’s going to be trouble syncing with the various software if you don’t do anything.”
Dawlish burst out laughing. “That seems a bit of a stretch to extrapolate from a few couplets.”
Draco’s pulse quickened. That must be it! That must be Riddle and his Mors Mordre minions behind that.
“That Blaise –”
Potter waited besides me, his face taut. Despite our assurances that I would be safe, he had insisted on being with me every step of the mission.
“Yes.” Malfoy took out his palmtop. “I know that.”
“—the Weasley too, and I can explain the full story to him. And Granger would be interested in listening to what I found out. I want to pick her brain on some ideas I have.” With a deadened, hollowness, I realized that the key was still at the Manor. That book … I was not worried about its survival, as I was certain whatever protective magic laid on it would not allow the fire to harm it. But it was another matter to go back to the Manor and sift for it through ash and ruin.
“But – I thought – only the scum in Underground use Elixir –”
Draco wondered idly what had become of his father’s offices. Likely they had been re-let and redecorated, thus obliterating any remnants of its erstwhile occupant. Real estate in this city was a premium after all, and one didn’t waste it on sentimentality.
“Our house-elves cook well,” I said, hurriedly moving past him. I didn’t look at him as I set the cutlery down.
“Yes, I know that,” Draco said impatiently. “What does that mean?”
I nodded. “He seems like he’s in a position of some authority,” I said. “I don’t know, but he said that he wants me to voluntarily help him find it. I don’t know why he doesn’t try Veritaserum or Legilimency instead of me joining him.”
I didn’t blame myself if I hallucinated the lines on the paper moving. But this was not a magical book — I detected no traces of enchantments. The only noteworthy thing about it was its lack of a cover, which I attributed to carelessness than any intentional actions.
“Do you … want some refreshments?” Potter asked after a while. “Tea? Coffee? Butterbeer?”
“Yes,” Draco said. He looked at the door. It was blocked by uniformed men. “Do you think you can handle her? I’ll go talk to those officers.”
Harry leveled a look at Draco. “Are you? Hurt, I mean.”
Harry unlocked the doors. “It’s part of my job. And I think my help was pretty effective, wasn’t it?”
I knew it was a slippery slope from settling petty vendettas to abusing this sort of knowledge for personal gain. It was like a fire: once the spark lit, there was little one could do to stop it from raging out of control.
“You didn’t bring a jacket,” Harry remarked, noticing.
“It’s not so bad here,” Draco said. “After all, compared to being stuck in a cave in a desert, this place is positively Elysium.”
A part of him wanted to wait for Harry. Draco had jabbed Harry’s number into his Blackberry several times, only to be met with voicemail.
“Yes. Having fish and chips sent to a lavatory would be a bit odd.” Draco had thought it strange when the directions Shacklebolt gave him led him to the entrance of a public toilet. He had only entered out of curiosity when the lights went out with a whirl of machinery. He had found himself in a spacious, if rather utilitarian, foyer where the receptionist showed him to Shacklebolt’s office. “I would have thought you would’ve been at that monstrosity at Vauxhall Cross. I had hoped to sneak a peek inside.”
“Potter’s interference should have been taken into account,” Riddle interrupted, and there was no denying the danger in his tone now. “After all, was not the plan crafted to snare him too?”
There was no point in lying to myself about it. I thought of all the secrets in this tiny little book I held. After all the trouble I suffered to obtain it, there was no harm in drinking its wisdom…. And I would be able to pay Cross back for what he did to me.
Which was why they were not going to Athens right now, but to a small island in the middle of the Aegean, where Rosier had postulated the currents had taken the shipwreck.
I aimed, a silvery rope issuing out of my wand. It changed into a snake that hissed and struck at the intruder. The intruder slashed at the serpent – it vanished in a puff of smoke.
“I wouldn’t forget,” Harry said, and the lightning scar on his forehead twinged. “But I would admit I don’t much about the details of what happened, except for what Riddle did. His helpers and such – I didn’t follow much of the trials after.”
Then I was ashamed of myself. It was an unparalleled invasion of privacy, breaching one’s psyche, especially for a matter that was trivial in nature. Even with someone I disliked, it was near anathema to abuse my talent in such a manner. Besides, my instruction was incomplete – I was more liable to confuse myself sifting through the mess of emotions and memories.
“What?” Draco stared at Shacklebolt as if he had just grown an extra head. “This isn’t Indiana Jones. I’m not going to take off and chase after some legend, with or without your permission. We don’t even know if the Shield is real.”
“And if I make it a nonnegotiable part of my compensation?”
“What’s the plan, then?” Draco asked. “What steps do we need to take next?”
“I’m sorry, Draco, but we need to get you of here.”
“He?” Fletcher looked confused. “I don’t know about a ‘he’. It was always a woman who contacted me.” He gave a description that fitted Bellatrix.
Draco froze. He didn’t need to open the link to know its contents. Another car collision…. First his father and Harry’s parents … now this Professor Rosier. Draco wasn’t a conspiracy theorist, but coincidences like there never happened. It was not an accident that left Rosier silenced forever – this was the work of men.
“In the fridge.”
It was the one I had seen in my visions, and sure enough, resting on top was the Grimoire. It was smaller than I remembered, fitting squarely on top of the plinth so unassumingly. And yet … even at this distance, I sensed its power like a blazing furnace in a closed room.
“Kingsley can have you sent to the hospital,” Granger said, wiping away the blood. “From my admittedly limited experience, it’s mostly superficial, but you’ll have to have your arm bandaged and out of commission for at least a week.”
Potter tensed at that, and I waited for my father’s inevitable rant on pureblood supremacy.
“It was my fault,” I whispered, my throat hoarse from the effort of keeping the spell together. “I was showing Harry something and then I accidentally touched it. He just – jumped in front of me.”
“But – but –” my father sputtered, at a loss for words. “At the Belgravia townhouse? I forbid it.”
“I see being stuck on bedrest has not diminished your ego.” I sat down next to him on the bed. “I am sorry, though. I should’ve paid more attention and been aware of my surroundings. I’m not a fieldwork kind of person—”
“Spent the entire day with your books again?” Millicent gave me a disapproving shake. “I told you; you need to learn how to take care of yourself. You can’t just survive on coffee alone, you know.” She was completing her Healer’s residency at St. Mungo’s, and had developed an annoying tendency to lecture about healthy living.
Harry couldn’t be more floored if a train had just ran him down on these disused tracks. “I had no idea. And the ones who scouted and reported back, they never said.”
“You’re swearing more than usual,” Harry observed with a smile. “It’s very atypical of you.”
Harry said as much, though in a much more concerned tone than the voice which spoke to Draco in his head.
I looked away, embarrassed. “No. As my boyfriend.”
Never had I seem the Dark Lord so bemused. I readied myself to run, but instead of raining destruction on the man, he gestured for him to continue.
“No.” I forced a smile. “Nothing’s the matter. I just got tired of holding it and wanted to give my hands a break.” It was a weak excuse; the Grimoire, though deceptively substantial in weight, was no trouble to carry beyond the possibility of it attracting unwanted attention. “And I wanted to use the toilet in the village,” I added. “I don’t want to take it in.”
Draco stiffened.
What did they want? They left the most obvious valuables – granted, the Bellini would have been hard to take with its heavy gilt frame -- but the rare books, the collection of Montblanc pens, those would have fetched a tidy sum.
Draco wanted to laugh if his shoulder didn’t hurt so much. Leave it to Harry to tell his boss he would be late to his own reprimand.
Granger laughed. “Who would have thought Draco Malfoy would be a dedicated bibliophile? If you need anything, you can just let us know. How are you with the progress on breaking the protections on the book-key?”
“The only danger that’s out here,” Draco said, “is the risk of hypothermia.”
That last battle had provided more than enough experience for both of them.
“They’ll be handed to the Afghan Ministry of Information and Culture,” the commander said.
Harry produced the Grimoire from under his robes. “This book can take a lot of damage. Not a scratch. I’m very impressed.”
I waited. Would he take the bait?
We were standing on the banks of the lake, the water smooth and unbroken. The huge trees I was used to were only saplings, barely able to reach my shoulders. Even though I knew it was nonsense, the air itself seemed younger somehow, fresher and less ladened. Of course, a thousand years ago, there were no factories and power plants belching their filth out.
“I got it,” he said, warm air from his mouth ghosting on my face. I saw it out of the corner of my eye. It was a little yellow thing of a leaf.
“It’s rude to leave without a farewell, even for uninvited guests such as yourselves,” Draco said, unfurling from the tree he was behind.
Harry paused. “You mean … these wands are specifically made to fight people like me? Aurors?”
“Well, I’m still not trusting you with a gun. Who knows if you’ll turn on us the second you get?”
And no matter how deep Potter had inserted himself into my psyche, I knew every time I looked at him, I would be reminded of all the mistakes I had made. And it tore at my soul. Unreasonable or not, I lacked the courage to face it, especially not with someone that I had somehow grown to respect.
“Shark attacks are rare,” Theo said, and Draco could tell he was trying to maintain levity despite his obvious concern. “In any case, it might be easier to swim away than shooting it.”
“Oi!” Dawlish called. “If you two are done being lovey-dovey over there, we need to discuss what’s going to happen next.”
Harry grinned at Draco sheepishly. “Sorry. Ron’s … well, he’s very protective.”
“No,” I said, pulling him down for a kiss. “I don’t mind that much.”
Madam Rosa nodded. “Good. What I have here is the Rider-Waite deck, which is the most popular. There are seventy-eight cards, each with a picture, a narrative, and attendant symbolism.”
I whistled. “A thrilling tale. If, of course, there wasn’t a confidentiality agreement. Must be a contrast to sitting here going over dusty over papers.” A wave at them stirred up a fresh round of dust. I sneezed.
Harry wasn’t able to stop staring at Malfoy. Here, of all places.
It didn’t seem like a good idea to Draco for Harry to provoke Greyback. “Harry ....”
“Then why aren’t you shooting right now?” Draco saw Theo pale at these words.
“What?” Potter looked at me, concerned. “Did it hit already? I didn’t even see you touch the book.”
Shacklebolt steepled his fingers. “Harry, you don’t need to work so hard to prove yourself. We all know how good you are. No one is going to think any less of you if you follow what others did in cases like these.”
“I don’t know.” It came out at a low volume, barely louder than a whisper. “What was it to you?”
Harry winked at Draco. “I’m the wise one, it’s true.”
“What’s wrong, Draco? You look faint. Have you had too much to drink?” Harry appeared and handed me a glass of water. “Here, water. What’s this?”
“I’m guessing the victims you’re investigating came down here for personal reasons. Most likely, to enjoy themselves.”
“But what do you think this reference to the Shield means?” Shacklebolt asked. Unlike Dawlish, he showed no incredulity, but listened with a quiet patience. He had a thoughtful expression. “Do you think the discovery of the Shield will have any impact?”
He shook his head. It must be the exhaustion, if Harry was fantasying in his shower about someone he had just met.
“I’ll leave you to unpack then,” Harry said. He hesitated at the door. “Let me know if you need anything.”
“Leave him to me. I can wipe his memory as well as I wiped yours.”  She narrowed her eyes threateningly.  “Don’t you dare disrespect him like that again.”
Narcissa did not seem to have a retort to this, for she remained silent, and the Dark Lord switched his attention back to Harry.  “What do you have to say on the matter?”
For a moment he really believed it, and then he realized what had happened.
.  And Draco was determined to be grateful for every moment, for every day.
The magic he was now facing was nothing like the one he had learned at Hogwarts.  There was a huge gap in his education, and he was surprised by the fact that neither Narcissa nor Lucius had ever tried to teach him about this side of magic.  Old magic was not a simple spell and a wave of the wand.  It was potent and long lasting, born of a different age.  The spells were generally longer, more intricate incantations, and many could only be performed through rituals.
“We won’t know that until we find it,” said Draco.
“What about you, Lucius? Do you have anything to say about your son?”
Slowly Harry’s eyes fluttered open.  One socket was empty, the other had the familiar green eyes that he had so often admired from a distance.  “Harry?”
When the spell lifted there was no change in Harry, either in his posture or expression and, as Draco looked at Voldemort, he thought he saw a flicker in fear in the red of his eyes.  “Impervious as ever I see.  We shall simply have to do a better job of cutting you up.  What do you say, boys?”
The edges of Harry’s mouth lifted into another smile.  “Now you won’t have to.”  His voice was so gentle as he said those words.  It sounded almost nothing like the voice he remembered.
“I do.”
He blinked often as he practiced his breathing, desperately trying not to pass out despite his weak genes.
“I want to look for Cepheus’s grave.”
He slammed a book shut.  “Leave,” he ordered her.
His dreams were growing even stranger than his waking hours.  He dreamt of doors left half opened, revealing bits flickering images peeking out like warped photographs.  He dreamt of Harry Potter, sitting in his library, with one eye and Draco’s pajamas.  He dreamt of his son, with shoulder length hair, covered in blood and shouting at Narcissa.  He dreamt of boys’ laughter.  He dreamt of mice who came to fill the bed with secrets that itched and poked at his skin like a locust.  He dreamt with discomfort.  With danger.  With Harry Potter, living and dead, waking through his house, and buried in the Malfoy family plot, mingled with the bones of his father.
Harry leaned closer into him, intertwining their hands.  He lay against his chest, quiet, staring out at the garden beyond them.  Draco kept expecting him to speak, to elaborate, to mention the silence of death which evidently kept haunting him.  But after a long time, Harry remained silent. “You want to go back?” Draco asked, the words burning as they were spoken.
“That’s what becomes of things when you leave a Black in charge.”
After about an hour the hand was back to normal, but they left it there a bit longer.  “Do you want breakfast?” Draco muttered.
Late at night, when sleep would not come, he would lay out on the bed, his fingertips running up and down the long scars on his torso.  Where had Harry even gotten that spell from?  The last thing Draco really remembered before passing out on the bathroom floor was the bewildered look in his eyes.  It was total surprise, total horror, but what kind of idiot used a spell like that without knowing what it would do?  Was he really that naïve? That trusting?
He moved more slowly as darkness came.  He was afraid of missing a sign, of overlooking something, but as the moon slowly began to rise, a serenity settled over him.
For the first time a spell shot across the room, knocking her back against the wall.  “I must say,” said Voldemort. “You keep your composure well.  You keep your secrets well.  The same cannot be said for Lucius, or-“ his eyes rose to look at Draco.  “For your son.  I have seen into their minds, Narcissa.  I have seen what they think, what they feel, how they see me.” He paused.  “You say they are devoted, but I saw none of that – all I saw was apprehension and fear.”
“Don’t listen to her Harry,” said Draco, grabbing the other boy’s hand.  “She doesn’t understand.  You’re alright, none of this is temporary.”
“I suppose not.”
.  Or when he was getting dressed in the morning and looking through his vast collection of clothes, he would think what would be useful to bring with him.  And every night without fail when Narcissa came to see him, he would ask her to tell the story of Cepheus again, and again.
It must have been very close to midnight when Draco knew that he had, at last, arrived.   There was a narrow entrance to a cave.  It bore no engraving, no markings or symbols, but old magic could not be so easily concealed.  There was something coming from it – like a faint heartbeat.
He tried to look at Harry, but he couldn’t turn his head the right way. The only thing he could see was the wall next to him, and his ancestors in their old fashioned robes chasing after them from portrait to portrait, ever hungry for blood.
“He should stay in the room,” she whispered.  “He’s too weak to be outside.”
Draco’s eyes fell closed, and he shuffled a little closer to Harry, laying his head down in the space between their two pillows.
Around these figures were dried flowers and herbs.  He recognized many of them from potions class and wondered if they were somehow helping preserve their forms. He also searched for an engraving, something that he hoped would have Cepheus’s name, or perhaps even that of his wife.  But there was nothing, no other marking, no sign of who this had been.
With sudden resolution he walked out of his bedroom and down several flights of stairs. As he went the portraits of his ancestors followed, some of them calling out to him, nosy as ever.  He had grown up with their voices in the back of his head, never quite alone, never quite himself.  He walked all the way to the dungeon without looking back, his footsteps echoing on the stone.
Draco  stared at his lips, pink and wet with water, then looked back at that one green eye as if asking for permission.  Harry didn’t say anything, but he did lean forward, kissing him.
Draco knelt by the bed, trying not to hear their discussion.
In August, to his parent’s relief, his health took a turn for the better.  His diet was limited mostly to fruits and vegetables, occasionally some bread, or light soup, and all in moderate amounts.  But it was the start of something and they all sensed it.  Suddenly, he didn’t want to lie in bed all day.  He would get up with the sunrise and walk the gardens that his father was trying to restore to their former grandeur.  He was too weak to go far, but the fresh air invigorated him.
His love for Harry was also a different thing, incomparable with any sentiments he had had for others.  He loved Harry in his entirety and without question.  He loved the Harry of his memories, quick to anger, quick to act, always in the middle of some mischief.  But he also loved the Harry who lay next to him, peaceful and sleepy, and, more likely than not, dreaming of death.  This Harry who was gentle, and hurt, and a smaller version of his old self, just like Draco was.
“Unfortunately, this magic has been lost for a long time, barred from being written by those like Albus Dumbledore who separate magic arbitrarily into good and dark.”
“You didn’t either.”
He watched them pull the boy apart, limb by limb.
One time, during his third week of searching, he found just such a thing.  There was a small flat stone sitting at the edge of a field.  He instantly sensed something about it, a sort of heat, and magically turned it over.  On the other side there was an inscription.  Although he had taken Ancient Runes for 4 years and had gotten decent grades at it, it all seemed to have gone straight out of his head.  He summoned his translator as he knelt down, trying to interpret the small hand-carved symbols.
“I guess,” he whispered.
Finally, after an interval that could have been hours, he was lowered to the ground.
“I-”  Harry looked up from his plate of food.  “I don’t know, I don’t really feel my body very well.”
There was another moment of quiet, where the only sounds Draco could hear was the pounding of his heart and his father’s feeble crying.  And then the Dark Lord made a large, sturdy chair appear out of thin air.  He sat back on, surveying the scene – the four of them all wounded, the seven Death Eaters ready to pounce.  “Let us start with Potter-” he said quietly.  “We’ll decide the rest later.” He turned his head to look at the four who surrounded Harry.  “Well then?”
Draco waddled in the water, trying hard not just to look at Harry.  It was hard though; it felt like his eyes were magnetized to him.  He dipped his head down into the water, feeling his hair gain weight and float around him.   He closed his eyes.  He loved the dimness of this room most of all.  It had always made him feel like he was hiding, like he was safe from others.  This had been the only room in his house that was really only for him.
Thank you also to @lovestillaround for telling me about this fest and putting up with my endless rambles about this story.
And in all truth, Draco had no idea how he would bear it.
But slowly, day by day, the idea began to take shape, to grow stronger.  Now when he managed to eat a little more than usual he found himself thinking,
“Anything,” was her reply.
“Yeah.  My father had it redone while I was in my first year.  He wanted it to be a surprise for me.  Theirs is even bigger, if you’ll believe it-” He tried to sound casual.  The truth was, he was uncertain of what the standards were for other people. What they thought of as ‘nice’.  All of his friends were rich, not as rich as he was, but significantly more than anyone Harry knew.  “Did you have your own bathroom when you lived with the Muggles?”
“It’ll stop once we have more Dittany,” said Draco.  But Harry was right.  It was now happening almost everyday.  He summoned the Dittany from across the room and filled the usual bowl, soaking Harry’s fingers in the liquid.
He had dreamt of Harry.  The exact circumstances were blurry and incomplete. Even Harry’s face was distorted.  And yet Draco knew it was him, he had a presence, a heat, a magnetism.  It had always existed between them and now (although Harry was dead) it had somehow continued drawing him in.
“No, it’s not!” Draco answered fervently.  “It’s just-”
Weeks passed.  One after the other, the days all melting together, and all full of Harry.  Harry kicking him in bed while he slept.  Harry asking for bacon in the morning.  Harry kissing him as they walked through the frozen garden, their footsteps on the soft snow the only proof that they were really there.  Harry reading over his journals from school.  Harry laughing at his worst jokes. It was the happiest time of Draco’s life.  It was like he was getting to see Harry become human again, day by day.
It took minutes of pumping to even get him hard.  He tightened his grip, running his thumb over his head, keeping his eyes closed.  He let images run through his head freely in his blood-lost daze.  Harry nude to the waist during the second Triwizard task.  Harry wearing that Weasley sweater that brought out the green of his eyes.  Harry with his hands splattered with ink stains, nervously fidgeting beneath the table.  Harry swerving in the air during a Quidditch match,  sweating and concentrating and glorious in the light.
It was at the very beginning of his fifth day in the Forbidden Forest that he found it.  The page bore a beautiful illustration at the top of a sunrise over the mountains.  Below in Cepheus’s slanted writing it said:
He had to think, he had to figure out something to do.  His wand was still in his hand.  Surely he knew some spell that would be helpful, something that would fix whatever was happening.  He looked at Harry’s face. There was no panic and there was no pain; he could not even see helplessness in his expression.  It was maybe a little surprising, but that was all.
If he was going to do this very mad Black thing, he was going to do it looking like a Malfoy, and at least faking the control he didn’t truly feel.  He was not going to let himself grow unhinged.  He was not going to be like Bellatrix, all chaos and darkness.
That night however, when they undressed each other, Draco saw for the first time the black rot that had begun spreading on his toes.
He stared expectantly at him and for a moment thought that he would get no reply but then Harry opened a toothless mouth and said: “Draco.”
“It was most imprudent of you to shout like that-” she said through gritted teeth.  “Your father-”
“For one day, when he was away, a band of wizards came into the village.  They were the children he had grown up with at Hogwarts and they believed in a very different world than he did.  They said they had come to ‘liberate’ the village, but that was just rhetoric; really, they had come to destroy.  As they liberated the village, they crushed it, and sent the muggles fleeing.  As they liberated the Castle, they slayed the dragons, fearing their power and superiority.  But they did not stop there.  They claimed that the beautiful Princess had been bewitched by Cepheus, that he had stolen her from her father in the dead of the night.  That she did not belong to him, and so they took her, too.”
“I’ll be right back Harry,” said Draco, approaching the bed. “We’ll figure out what’s happening.  You’ll be okay again.”
“What?”
“I know, darling” she pressed him closer to her.  “But how can you expect mudbloods, and half-bloods, to understand how we love.  To understand that when we love nothing could stand between us, not even death? They do not feel things like we do.”
“No, my Lord, I-”
Draco couldn’t imagine that.  “What did you think it was?”
Draco dropped to his knees as he gaped at it, not allowing himself to really believe it.  Harry had all his limbs, and all his features.  Like Draco, he was fully naked, with new scars where his limbs had been detached and his tummy ripped open.  But he was whole and unmistakably human.
When he turned his eyes back, Harry was being levitated between the four men, so still he looked dead.  Somebody had cursed his jaw so that it hung unnaturally open and was knocking out each of his teeth with what looked like the back of a knife.  Another was making flickering black flames come out of his wand and using them to trail burns down Harry’s leg, destroying his clothes as well as the skin underneath.
The only answer he got was a smile.
“No sense of family, really,” a nasally woman added.
For a moment Harry considered him, then he shook his head.
Draco knew what it was at once.  “Where did you get this?”
“I’m in the Forbidden Forest, and you must come before the full moon.”
He had thought that Harry was sick – maybe he had eaten something that hadn’t agreed with him.  Instead, Harry was sitting there, his mouth dripping with blood, the green sheets stained red all around them.  Draco blinked against the light, suddenly questioning if this was really reality or another of his disturbed dreams.
“What does that mean?”
people, who
Draco poured them each tea and then grabbed a few pieces of fruit and some toast.  He ate slowly, looking up at Harry every few minutes.
He turned around to see his mother just where she had been.  Her hands and feet still bound.  Whatever magic had been binding her was also stopping her corpse from falling.  The last expression on her face was anguish.  He could not remember Narcissa joyful, he could not remember Narcissa sad, and seeing her like this, every inch of her face overcome with agony, was like seeing a stranger.
He sighed and closed the book.  Why were things never as easy as he envisioned them? Why was it never just about him and what he could do? It was frustrating how he always had to rely on others, how he always had to play the political game.   He hadn’t been able to go in search of Cepheus’ grave without lies and manipulation, and now he had to use those same methods again to attain what he so desperately wanted.
Then came bath time, another activity that stretched on for hours.  They would soak in the water together, sometimes quiet and almost sleeping, sometimes engaging in silly conversation.  Draco did most of the talking, but Harry chimed in with comments.  They talked about Quidditch, and trips to Hogsmeade, and all the particular moments they had shared.
“I did this so that we would be h-happy-” he found himself struggling with the words, as if they were in a foreign language.  “But if you’d rather-”
In that moment Draco would have liked to feel empty.  He had always assumed there was a finite amount of pain a human could take and that after that limit was breached the numbness would come.  But that was not what happened to him.  He felt everything.  Every bit of the sorrow, every bit of the fear; he felt the physical pain of his body, of his broken ankle, of the place where his head had been bumped against the wall hours before.   He felt disgust for his own form, for the vomit drenching his clothes, for Harry’s blood which tainted the whole room.  He felt everything, amplified like music, to the point that it  was so loud it felt as if it would break him, but no break would come, no sweet release.
Harry shrugged.  “Okay, I think.”
“No, he could not.”
They walked into the forest and Draco could feel his heart pounding.  Tonight.  He would have Harry tonight. Everything was ready for it.  His thoughts were so fixated on him that he didn’t even consider how much of this Narcissa guessed at.  She had come here as he had expected, without questions and without judgment. She was solidarity itself, and she loved him.  But of course, there were things Narcissa would not stand for.
“Bathroom,” said Harry, his eye on Draco’s chest beneath the cover of bubbles.
“Yeah…”
He took a step back from the window.  It was strange to think that Potter had been here.  That he had seen their home.  Had he noticed the gardens? Had he seen any of his father’s albino peacocks? Had he noticed the large family portrait that hung over the hearth? The one that showed him at seven years old, standing solemn between his parents, one of their white hands at each of his shoulders?
A sound emerged, cracked and infantile, but it was no word.
Draco reached across the table and grabbed a hold of his hand.  He walked him to the bed and, before getting in, undressed him down to his underwear.  His body was full of scars, everywhere the flesh had been pieced together by magic was red and raw.  But even so, he was beautiful, lithe, lean, and small.
Draco slowly turned back to the Dark Lord.  He knew that every eye was on him.  “Please,” he begged, although he knew it was no good.  “Please,” he held on to the bottom of Voldemort’s robes with his hands, the good one and the maimed, desperate, absolutely desperate to die.
“In a bit,” he answered.  He moved up to a sitting position, feigning strength he did not have.
He poured it into a silver bowl and Harry dipped his entire hand into it.  For a long time, they sat in silence.  Harry was looking out of the window.  Draco was watching the slow process of his hand turning back to normal.  Despite the fact that they were in bed, comfortable warm sheets around them, and the whole day open for them to enjoy, Draco had a nasty feeling it was all ruined already.
He had never said it before.  He had always thought of it as a silly phrase. Love did not need to be spoken, it was something you felt, something you did.  But saying it didn’t feel silly anymore.  It felt important.  He needed Harry to know that he was loved, that Draco had and would continue to do anything in his power for him.  Anything at all.
“We were just grabbing some books.”
“I could have-” he didn’t finish the sentence but they both knew what he meant.
He lay his head against Draco’s shoulder.  “At least we got this time,” he said after a moment.
“No,” he said simply, stretching out his hand for Draco to tend.
not anything anymore. Potter was a hero. Potter had been many things.  He let that thought rest with him as he closed his eyes.  It had been a long 36 hours, a long battle, a long year.
He nodded against his pillow.  “I didn’t understand, you know.”
The Dark Lord came right to him and Draco raised his gaze to look at him.  He felt like an insect staring up at God.  And he had no defenses, no will left to shield himself.  Voldemort could have it all, his memories, his thoughts, he did not care for any of it.  All he wanted was death, and those red eyes glowed with that promise.
“Is there really nothing you can do?” he asked Narcissa one night while Harry slept.  He had brought her to the library, showing her all the books that he had been sifting through, desperate for information.
He didn’t know where, exactly, it was coming from, as Harry looked perfectly himself, but he kept remembering Narcissa’s warnings that this body that Draco had scarified so much to get was nothing but a temporary vessel.
He was pale, with one hand still held against his mouth, sticky with blood.  “Does something hurt?” said Draco as he pushed the wet sheets away from his body, trying to see if any of his scars had burst open, or if he had any bruising that might explain this.
Draco could tell by the heavy chandelier above them that they were being brought into the dinning room.  Whoever was dragging him pulled him up by his shoulders, bringing him to his feet.  Draco tried to get away from their grip but Selwyn was large, and his muscular arms went around him easily, pressing in on him like a snake.
They went under the blanket together, so close that it was difficult to know what warmth was Harry and what warmth was his own limbs intertwined with Harry’s.  It was easy to close his eyes, and effortless to fall asleep again.
“Draco, with the Grimoire, you’ll have the power to persuade Mr. Potter here to join us. You would like that, wouldn’t you? Have him stay by your side? Without it, he’ll leave you eventually. You know he will.” Cross looked upon me with avuncular wisdom. “After all, your past and his are incompatible.”
“Nothing. It’s just … you look nice, that’s all.”
“The file’s firewall is well protected and we cannot bypass it,” the SI said. “It isn’t a matter of resources. We simply are not able to penetrate it.”
Not that the risk was to be taken lightly. Draco’s hands flexed from the memory of being bound in that cave.
“It’s quite full in there,” Draco said, not wishing for conversation to stray beyond the practical. Even so, a lump lodged in his throat. “We’re going to have to wait half an hour by the looks of it.”
“That’s why I treasure my friendship with Goyle and Blaise so much,” I continued. “They’re not perfect, and neither am I, but we’ve known each other for so long, it seems a pity to throw it away over small differences.” I looked at Potter. “Sounds a little pathetic, doesn’t it?”
They drove from the warehouse to central London, Harry checking once in a while the GPS that monitored Bellatrix’ progress.
“What do you mean, you don’t have permission?” Finnegan asked. “It’s just a list, isn’t it?”
The iron-wrought gate opened at my touch. A peacock turned its head at us before returning to back to its strut. The hedges which used to be so familiar now towered over us, as we walked in its sinister shadow it left.
“I’m sure that is not the case,” Dolohov said. He sat on a stool, eyeing Draco like a puzzle to be solved. There was that madman’s glint on his eyes again, and Draco remembered what Shacklebolt had told him, that this man was a former KGB assassin. “I think you know a lot more than you think. You just need a little more ... persuasion.” He raised a hand and stroked Draco’s cheek. Draco jerked away.
“Rough night, was it?”
I watched as shadows seemed to spill from the book-key like spilt ink, pooling under it. The book-key itself disappeared. In its stead was a liquid-like substance that seemed to absorb what little light there was in the room.
I knew what I had to do. I could never accept Cross’ offer. But he needed me. I was the only one who could use the Grimoire – that I knew for certain. It was not out of some long-held loyalty to Slytherin’s directive that he refrained.
They looked up at Draco — and ran. Without hesitation, they charged at the window, the glass shattering with a resounding crash on impact.
“What part of piss off don’t you understand?”
Cross looked – well, cross -- but he inclined his head.
I was so elated, I even offered the librarian a smile as I exited. He watched me with his cold eyes, his lips pressed into a thin line.
“What do you have to say, Malfoy?”
I sipped my coffee. The machine had arrived faster than expected, even though I did pay for expedited shipping. I was irrepressibly excited at the prospect of Potter visiting, even though I knew it would be strictly business. I resisted the urge to order the house-elf to clean the flat, knowing that Potter would need it to be as it is to search for traces of the invader. He would need to be in my bedroom too, and didn’t that just leave me in a state?
There was silence. Then: “Would advise against that. There are three unmarked cars in front of the house, and it appears they all have men inside. It might be innocuous but the fact that you were just shot at, and that there are three occupied vehicles where you’re planning to go can’t be a coincidence.”
“Stop it,” Draco rasped. It didn’t. He tried again. “Please.”
“Get out of here!” Harry shouted. He ducked as Bellatrix released a hail of bullets that studded the table. None of them penetrated but it was close.
“Alright.”
He didn’t bother. Harry pocketed his wand and grinned at Padma. “All clear. Not carrying any concealed weapons or viruses in my parts.”
Harry shook his head. “All the chatter we picked up suggest that something big is going to happen, but nothing is clear enough for us to take action on.”
Draco raised his arm. There was a relief of cold brushing across his chest, followed by Harry’s hand, hot like coals.
My political opinions were also high on the list of my father’s disapproval.
“I know,” I interrupted. I gestured at the overturned thermos. Thankfully, the cap was still screwed tight and no liquid escaped. “It was an accident, you see. Me and my clumsy self.” I smiled sweetly at the man. “And would you mind calling me Dr. Malfoy? I worked hard for my DPhil, you see, and it’s one of the few perks I get to enjoy.”
“What time is it?” Harry asked.
“I didn’t eat lunch today,” I said waspishly. My fingers dripped with grease. I hastily wiped them on a serviette.
“Draco isn’t his father.” Harry cut in. “He’s just as much victim as the rest of us.” Harry remembered what Malfoy had confided in him. “Don’t take this out on him.”
“Ah!” His knees met gravel. Harry’s breathing became labored – every sip of air turned ever more difficult to take. He was hot, like his blood was boiling in his very veins.
Draco stared at Harry. “You know her?”
Harry hoped that she covered her tracks. If discovered, he could arguably make an excuse to why his SI needed to access confidential files, but he hoped it wouldn’t come to that.
If McLaggen was a wiser man, then he probably wouldn’t be in this line of work in the first place, Harry thought wryly. There were plenty of sinecures in the Ministry that a man with McLaggen’s connections could obtain. However, Deputy Head of the Aurors wasn’t one of those.
“What is this, a therapy session?”
“What? No! Just – it’s distracting!”
Draco understood that. But he also hated the idea of being left behind, even as he knew he had no military training, and probably would get himself killed the moment he stepped out the base.
“A most unsuitable match if there ever was one,” my father sniffed. “Radical opinions, much too wild. Shocking morals.”
“What did you do?” Potter grabbed the librarian in a fury. He raised his wand –
“They were hooded in black robes, and talking in low voices that overlapped with each other. It was so loud but I couldn’t hear anything useful; it was like an angry buzz. Like the one you hear when you’re near a beehive.” Malfoy closed his eyes. “But I did see my father in the center of the room. Even in those clothes, I could tell who he was by his posture. He was talking to a man – that man’s face, though, I couldn’t see clearly.”
“It is,” Draco confirmed. “Lots of marble statues and jewelry and coin. Oh and don’t think of selling of them illegally,” Draco said sternly. “It’s a small world; I’ll hear of it if you do.”
“I will hide my grimoire in the home of my enemy, under that Muggle-lover’s very nose. You will guard the key to it.” It was a command, not a request, and it was phrased as such. “My grimoire will contain my wisdom and knowledge, a source of guidance to my heir. Of course, do not make it so easy for my heir to find it. Test him, for many will seek my power.” Slytherin’s face was etched with lines of age, as unmovable and cold as stone.
I sat at my counter. I had meant to go to the British Library. Why did I change my mind? My intuition told me that the answer wouldn’t be there, but in Gringotts Reading Room where I found it. Pity. The British Library had much more accepting patrons, and its librarian was much friendlier.
“I’ll go with you,” Weasley said. He glanced at Harry. “We need to balance out our firepower. Unless you want to go with her ….”
The car sped through the London traffic erratically. With every turn came a twist in Draco’s stomach and he braced himself for further bullets.
“What?” Harry spun around to glare at me, almost dropping the vase.
Draco discarded that idea. He wasn’t sure how to operate it, and in any case, it was too heavy to be wielded properly.
Draco eyed Harry. “Since when did you use words like ‘penurious’?”
“Receiving signal from console,” Hedwig said aloud. “How do you want to engage?”
“Can’t say I enjoy sitting behind a desk.” Potter’s eyes were fixed ahead. “Though if it were up to me, I would go in already. We’re too exposed here; we’ll lose the element of surprise.”
“Well, our systems couldn’t analyze them except to tell they’re some sort of plugins for the web components between SI and our biomechanical parts.”
I took a deep breath. I wanted to argue with Potter, but he was right. “I know.” I looked at him. “Let’s go back.”
“I have some other work to catch up on,” Harry said. “Besides, I have a strange feeling that I need to be here, in case there’s something sensitive that can’t be communicated over the Web.”
“What’s this?” I opened it. Lying on satin stained with age was a pair of platinum cufflinks set with small sapphires. I looked at Harry. He had an air of a bashful child giving his first Christmas gift. “You didn’t need to buy me anything.”
It was eerie to be in a lobby of glass and marble at night. The distorted reflections in the sleek surfaces shimmered like some otherworldly portal, beckoning one to look into a grotesque version of himself. Noises echoed, twisted and elongated by the sheer acoustics and by the lack of the usual chatter. It was a place where a hushed whisper stretched long and loud until it lost its own identity.
I stared at my reflection. An elegant figure that would not look out of place sipping cocktails by the bar at the Savoy gazed back. Outwardly, I appeared every inch the aristocratic Malfoy, unruffled by the swells of life. And inwardly – well, perception could easily be turned into reality.
“No,” Harry said, and he finally paused. “Not everyone.”
“This makes it easier, then. That you know what kind of family we were.”
“Might be a good idea,” Draco said with a strangled laugh. He didn’t stop with the kisses, mouthing Harry’s earlobe, trailing from his collarbone down his chest, on the flat planes of Harry’s stomach as Harry untwisted to undress.
I would never tire of this, Harry impaled in me. Slow and steady, like clockwork but infinitely more enjoyable. Sweat drenched us both, my hair sticking to my eyes as I cried out and my vision blurred. My knee weakened and splayed open as he came with a deep shudder.
“Well, just that I was thinking about how well you handled yourself out in the field,” she said.
“Thanks, Theo. I appreciate it.”
“Oh, come on, Draco, don’t be such a skeptic. Besides, it’ll be fun. Don’t you want to know what the future holds for you?”
The Tube at this point of the night was still busy. The car they got into was full of teenagers who barely outgrown their spots chugging water bottles full of a liquid that was clearly not water. The press of the bodies made it claustrophobically humid after being out in the open, and Draco wrinkled his nose at the unwashed bodies.
Draco touched his face. It was damp. He should have the groundskeeper come and check the building to check the building again. He blinked hard, swallowing the lump in his throat.
“Get some rest, Harry,” Shacklebolt said. He grinned at Harry. “I remember when I was in your shoes. Always on the go, always trying to prove myself. I learned over the years that one can’t advance his station in life until one learns how to take care of himself. You should remember that too, before you learn that lesson the hard way.”
“I’ll have Dennis owl you an invoice,” Potter said. “Payment half in advance, half on completion of the job. And expenses, of course. Though that usually just amounts to cups of coffee.”
“Can’t you assign an Auror to me for protection?” I demanded. “Or have someone shadow me?”
“I touched the book-key. I know I shouldn’t have. But I couldn’t help myself….”
“Fees?”
I met the man’s eyes, trying to probe into the librarian’s mind, trying to see his most recent memories of this ‘Circle’ he mentioned.
“Then I’ll meet you in front of the church. There’s somewhere I want to go first before we leave.” Without asking, I knew Harry wanted to visit his parents before we went back to London. I bowed my head.
The clock ticked. Time stopped. No one moved.
“Are they from the source? From Afghanistan, that is?”
There was a sharp pain in my head as a loud crack sounded. I fell on my knee. The impact only registered faintly, subsumed by a greater agony that left my entire body on fire.
Harry saw the same problem Draco did.
My father’s face turned a blotchy red. He hated reminders, even more than I did, of the past. It was a symbol to him of his impotence, of a world that no longer feared or moved to his whim. I knew he was likely to lash out at Potter any second now.
Draco grinned. “Yes. And I’ll try to contact my … ahh … more disreputable sources, about artifact smuggling. See where the biggest leak of Afghan artifacts are coming from. Hopefully, that’ll give us another lead to where Mors Mordre is.”
“How familiar are you gentlemen with your Homer?”
“I’ve already deactivated them. Besides, you’re with me on official Auror business. You have nothing to fear.”
The man narrowed his eyes. “I’ll get one of them.”
There must be someone maintaining all of this, Harry thought, trying not to trip over his feet. The entrance had sounded loud to Harry’s ears, but it worked seamlessly, and its decibel wouldn’t have registered to the cams that monitored this place. Harry wondered who it was. While not terribly sophisticated, it still suggested a technical proficiency beyond what a campout of vagrants could afford to muster.
“Help us and we’ll tell you,” the taller man said. He had a sinister face: long, pale, and twisted, with a madman’s glint in the eyes. “Or we’ll be forced to use harsher methods.”
“You’ll stay?”
“How come they’ll listen to you and not to me?” I complained, annoyed. “There’s a wing in this damn hospital here named after my great-grandmother, you know. Can’t believe this. So ridiculous.”
Ah. That made sense. The machinery of State was efficient when it wanted to.
The air fell still and heavy in the mausoleum. Generations of Malfoys were buried here: from Nicholas Malfoy, who made a fortune, it was whispered, from highway banditry and cattle-thieving, to his grandfather Abraxas, who barely escaped prosecution from war profiteering during the Second World War.
I sat, waiting in a brightly lit antechamber, looking impatiently at Potter’s closed door. I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection.
It was a relief to feel the fetid air of the Underground against his face as Harry stumbled out. His chest heaving, he made his way to the nearest alley.
Hermione met Malfoy’s gaze evenly. “Then why aren’t you arresting us? We both know that the Order has been declared an outlaw organization by the Ministry.”
An idea came to me. I had rudimentary training in Legilimency. From – from during the War. Aunt Bella had trained me in the fundamentals along with Occlumency. It made sense: they were two sides of the same coin. If I asked my questions strategically, I could probe his mind for clues.
Thankfully, that didn’t seem soon. I walked down the streets with a bounce, my shoes alighting on the cobblestones with airy steps. I didn’t even mind the hostile ogling; they slid off my back today.
She was fierce like this, Draco thought. She would make a good mother one day.
I sneezed. Then I tensed, waiting for ghosts and ghouls to attack me.
Draco’s throat caught at the implications of that statement. But Dolohov was still speaking.
“He?” Potter gave me a sideways glance. He settled down onto my couch. “It didn’t last?”
The door flew open after a few knocks on the porch. Granger stared, her eyes the size of saucers.
“I don’t like to sit with my back to the door,” Harry said as he eased into his chair, “but when I have to, I like to know if an enemy’s approaching.”
“Hermione and Ron?” Potter jumped up. “What does she want?”
“Have there been a lot of other cases like these?” Harry asked, ignoring the advice.
“That’s a kind offer, but I’m much too busy at the moment to return to school,” Draco said quickly. “But what do you mean by full clairvoyant powers?”
“I wonder where their office will be,” Draco said thoughtfully. “Security will probably be tight, given all the multinationals headquartered here.”
“It might not blow up in your face, but it still is a millennia old book, Harry.”
“Oh.” A spark of pity twisted Harry’s chest. “But the media still think he had something to do with it?”
“Harry, we’re going home now. I don’t know where Malfoy went, so tell him he needs to make sure you have your pot – Merlin fucking Christ!”
Draco took a deep breath and flipped a card over. It showed a man holding five swords slipping away from a tent guarded with two upright swords.
So this was fun to write. I began this as a project to practice writing consistently within a deadline. I'm proud to say I managed to stay mostly on schedule. I did post without editing or revisions, so I imagine I would need to go back later and do that. B
“As a matter of fact, it isn’t,” Harry snapped. “It’s a damn nuisance and it makes my job harder.”
It was strange to realize that only a week had passed since Draco had stumbled upon Dolohov breaking in. Since then, life transformed into unrecognizable form. Or perhaps it reverted ... the reappearance of Harry, being shaken out of his staid routine of office-sleep-Manor. His pulse jumped. It was exciting, and strangely addictive, like a sugar rush or the flood of endorphins after finishing an intense run.
I woke feeling much refreshed. Harry had already risen. He was not in the room.
“Do you have an extra?” Draco asked, indicating Harry’s gun.
“There are several, but one has been providing the vast volume of these goods,” Fletcher said. “And what’s interesting is that even with the quantity, the quality of these are superb. Museum pieces. Gold and silver, marbles, coins. Things that haven’t been turning up in such numbers in a long time.”
Potter wetted his lips. “You look good in my clothes.”
Harry’s grip tightened on the Grimoire. “Let Draco go and I’ll give you the Grimoire.”
“Oh.” I shifted awkwardly in my seat. Silence fell between us again.
He sat next to me, still bare-chested. “Needed to stretch my legs. Moving always helps the hangover.”
“A general doesn’t need to fight on the battlefield to command,” Harry said.
“I haven’t seen you wear a suit in … well, never actually.” When Draco used to invite Harry as his escort for formal events, Harry usually showed up in his dress uniform.
“That’s impossible,” Finnegan said. “You mean you can’t break the encryption?”
The librarian recovered first. He drew his wand, waving it in a figure eight movement as he opened his mouth –
Despite my cloak, a chill went through me. “They sound illegal.”
Draco had to admit it was impressive. Overly done — a diplomatic way of saying paranoid — but Draco was considering upgrading the Manor security along these lines.
“Nice work,” Harry said, the words coming out a little thickly. “That’ll probably get you disqualified at the next fight tournament, though.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s well.” Draco took a sip of his lychee and elderflower drink. It flowed down smooth and then – it exploded.
Maybe he would know about the book, an idle whisper came into my head. After all, I discovered it here, and he was the librarian. He was the most likely to have information regarding it out of anyone I could possibly ask.
“That’s Slytherin,” I mouthed to Harry. “Salazar Slytherin.”
There was a gentle cough.
Damn bureaucrats. I was at loss. Do I make an appointment? It seemed a comical response when someone tells you his life was in mortal peril. I narrowed my eyes. No doubt if it had been one of the Gryffindors or anyone else, the witch would have leapt to help. Probably accompanied by maternal fussing and offers of a warm cup of tea.
“You could have come in soon,” Harry groused. “Taking your bloody sweet time.”
Harry chuckled. “Not everyone has your style.”
Leaves crunched. His face smarted from the icy blast of wind. But Draco didn’t stop. He was almost there – if he took even a second’s break, he would lose the two men. They had answers, he had questions. He had questions ever since his parents’ crash.
I had already established that he knew more about the book than he let on – this was the proof. And though he had not told me about its origins, his diction provided clues. Lost manuscript … working with … Instead of using misplaced book or reading … was this a lost manuscript? And he knew it revealed its contents atypical of a regular book – or even a magical one.
“Indeed.” My father looked at me and Potter. “Well, you might as well seat yourselves.”
“Well, I’m not going back up there,” she said huffily. “It’s your turn to have a pillow thrown at you.”
I saw myself sitting in the Reading Room, with a burning desire to wrap my fingers around the neck of the Malfoy boy — I felt the seething just underneath the surface every time the Malfoy boy came to speak with me —
Camp Bastion, Helmand, Afghanistan:
Draco didn’t want to sit here talking about the coffee. “So you’re a spy now and you’re the one those two back home decided to pair me up with. Are you fucking serious?”
I only had a few seconds to act. I tapped my wand thrice to my palm, making sure the tip dipped in blood. Then I flicked, in a wide arc up.
“Surely it wasn’t bad as that,” Draco said. He hid a glimmer of a smile. “I do rank that incident as one of the top three most idiotic things I have ever done.”
“Is that what you do?” Harry looked at Draco in the eyes. “Live one day at a time?”
“You look like someone just stole your supper,” Malfoy said, chortling. “Surely you weren’t relying on little old me to solve your case for you, were you?”
“Help yourself,” Potter said. “But be careful. There might still be doxies in the curtains.”
Silence.
I let out a huff and resolved to complain to Astoria about the deplorable state of our police force next time I had dinner with her. She had married some high-up on the Minister’s staff; I’ll have her give him an earful.
I subsided in impotent rage. I needed to think clearly. I could not perform magic effectively without my wand, and no sharp objects laid within my reach to use.
“No.” Harry said with finality. “No matter how good you are, you don’t have the training I have. I’ve been trained to provide close protection to VIPs up to the PM.”
He gave a low rumble of a chuckle. “You enjoy a bit of rough, don’t you?”
“It would be nice to confirm my suspicions,” Draco said. He gestured at Harry. “I’m not rash like my friend here.”
Mr. Weasley interrupted.
“This is the only room that’s in any semi-decent state,” Potter informed me ruefully. “No one lives here except for Kreacher, and he obviously does his best to keep things up to standard, but ….” He gave a slight shrug.
“Of course,” I said. I raised my wand and casted a Shield around myself. “I should be good to do that.”
I hesitated. Did I want to confide in Granger about my discovery regarding the Grimoire? She was the only other one besides me to read Hogwarts, a History from cover to cover.
“And you think my club has something to do with it?” Malfoy raised a neat eyebrow. “Dead patrons aren’t really good for business, you know.”
I looked up. My vision blurred, my ears rang, filling with a muffled roar. A shadowy figure stood above me, a wand out.
I’m an Auror, Harry told Hedwig. Traffic grid rules don’t apply to me.
“I know,” Harry said. He smiled at Hermione. “You two are two of the best people I’ve ever known. Of course I know that you wouldn’t do anything that’s –” Harry hesitated. “Anything that’s against your conscience.”
Before them were at least a dopzen crates filled with artifacts. Even from this distance, Draco saw that were on par with any displayed at the British Museum or the Metropolitan Museum in New York. There were coins stamped in the Greco-Bactrian style, Roman cameos in bas-relief, Buddha heads that still exuded a serenity despite being broken and pillaged from their homes. Draco wanted to weep in outrage. The cultural massacre this represented spanned centuries and multitudes of civilizations that interacted at this crossroads between the East and West. What was dumped in those boxes should have been lovingly categorized and preserved, not treated like debris from a construction site.
“Here to save your lover boy, Malfoy?” Bellatrix taunted in a sing-song voice. “I’m not sure who I want to get first, you or Potter. I wonder if I can try both.”
Goyle tried to shove off Harry’s hand, bumping into a neighbor that returned the favor. Harry was the one who ended with a wet face and sticky liquid staining his front.
Interrupting the quiet was an explosive sneeze from Draco. He rubbed his nose.
“It was the easiest way to get the knife,” Harry said, sawing through Draco’s cords.
“The effect could be delayed,” a young Healer, one still sporting the spots of youth, informed me. “There have been many cases of curse effects kicking in even years after the initial contact. I think there was this one incident –”
“Now the querent – that’s you – pick a card.”
“Oh, it went fine. Caught a few reporters trying to sneak past the cordon. Was that Draco Malfoy with him?”
It made Draco miss his own. After all this was over, he would reconnect with them, he vowed.
“You laugh,” I said darkly. “But I can tell you stories of houses where stairwells cracked and walls shattered, all because the owners slammed the door too hard. These old houses – better not to offend them.”
I glowered at her. That incident had brought her no small amount of amusement. The Weasley was surprisingly supportive of it. He had merely given me a beady look and grunted, “Hurt him and I’ll hex your balls off.”
“I just know they won’t hold me,” said Harry with another shake of his head. “They just – they just feel dead.”
He turned over on the bed, laying down on his stomach.  The Slytherin crest had been intricately carved above his bed.  He stared at the eye of the snake and a shiver ran through his spine.  He had spent far too much time with Nagini not to be apprehensive of serpents.  For a moment he wondered if he should put something over the crest, an old sheet, or a tapestry.  He didn’t like that snake looking down on him.
Harry evidently thought the same. He stood behind me and grabbed my wrist. “Wait.” He performed a quick Summoning Charm.
“Ron!” Hermione gave him a sharp glare. “I’m sure Harry isn’t here to rehash old history.” She raised an eyebrow. “Are you, Harry?”
I raised my wand. “Accio.” Nothing happened.
His destination was around the corner, overlooked by most in favor of the Starbucks and Pret a Mangers. Draco didn’t understand why; this café served better coffee and had the best tea cakes in the entire district.
And that was my leverage.
“What Harry means to say is thank you,” Malfoy cut in. He shot a quelling glance at Harry. “I think I’ll take my friend to my private box. Tom, why don’t you have something sent up there?”
“No, he hasn’t. But I do have a doctorate in archaeology and history of the Mediterranean region.”
“That … doesn’t sound very intelligent.”
I took a deep breath. I needed to push through the panic, to think. My first instinct was to Apparate to the Ministry and drag someone from the Auror’s Office, by force if I had to, to show him the scene. Their inaction was the cause of this.
The fear when they talked about him … it made sense.
“My, my, you’re cute when you display your naivety. That’s one thing I disliked about Lucius — he was much too clever for his own good.” Dolohov shrugged. “Maybe you’ll make the same mistake as him, maybe you won’t. But rest assured that the Shield is going to further a greater cause than you — or anyone in the world — can imagine.”
“I thought you wanted my help with my father’s papers,” Draco said, “not go off on some wild goose chase in the middle of Afghanistan.”
“How?”
“Oh.” Nonplussed, I turned to Granger. “What are we going to do now?”
“Be careful,” Draco said to Harry. “Don’t do anything stupid.” He had an inexplicable desire to go with Harry. It was ridiculous: this was Harry’s job. Draco’s job was to wait for the artifact, determine its veracity and how it fitted into his father’s death. It wasn’t Draco’s role to be in the field.
“Me too.” Harry sounded wistful. “I really do too.”
“It has survived two thousand years of being underwater,” Bellatrix said. “It’s a lot sturdier than you think. And who said we were going to sink the Decoder along with the boat?”
“I have poor aim,” Draco said. “Come aboard and get it yourself.”
“What? What about the mausoleum?”
Some days, he would gladly toss the lot of it.
“Don’t break any confidences, Mr. Malfoy,” she said. She tapped a tin can. “Biscuits?”
McLaggen nodded. He knew not to push further. “Alright.”
“Duck!” Harry shouted as a ripple of gunfire dotted the wall. He raised his rifle. Draco averted his eyes, focusing his body on grappling with one of the men, trying to wrestle the gun from the man.
She nodded. “So far, it’s only been rumors and conjecture. We have nothing solid yet. And there’s evidence that their network reaching deep into all parts of Wizarding society.”
Harry waved a hand. “They’re welcome to it. Sirius never liked this house, and neither do I.”
“What of Potter, master?”
“I made some progress. I think the spell on it is an Inesco Loop, and I’m not exactly certain how to break that.”
Potter shook his head. “I can’t anymore. It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later.”
They were in a cave. It was clear that this was used as a hideout, evidently had been for some time. Draco had no idea where they were, his grip on the geography of the desert vanishing the moment he felt the gun.
Malfoy seemed to have picked up on Harry’s unease. “So,” Malfoy began, glancing around. “Pleasant as it is to make your acquaintance, this isn’t the reason why Commander Potter and I are here. We’re here –”
What caught Harry’s attention was the man besides Fudge.
Harry only glanced at Draco. His face was devoid of emotions, a startling change to what was usually so expressive.
But Malfoy’s mask had already slipped back into place. “Anyways, let me take a quick look. It looks strangely familiar. Metis, analyze this and compare it with our records.”
Fine mists of water sprayed Draco’s face. It was still decently sunny, though that was deceptive; the air was chilly, despite the field jacket Draco had on, and he knew the sea would be even worse. It was one of the reasons why Theo had been readily available.
“Cunning I can do.” Draco gave Rosa a slight smile. The house he had been Sorted in at school, Slytherin, had a reputation for underhanded tricks. It didn’t help that several of the Slytherin alumni went on to become famous – or infamous – for investment antics that brought the wrath of the Financial Services Authority on their heads. “But hopefully, it doesn’t come to that.”
“I suppose I should thank you for your high opinion of me,” I said, “though I believe some of your compatriots do not share it.” I thought of the librarian, now hopefully rotting away in prison, and his contemptuous looks.
Draco had thought about trying to contact Harry; he had contemplated even driving to the Burrow and demanding that they give Draco Harry’s address. But it all came to naught – Draco knew that if Harry had wanted to contact Draco, Harry would have.
“Finnegan, take the Land Rover back,” Harry told him. “I’ll drive Draco back. I think we need to get our stories straight for the brass when we return.”
He ignored me. “Dr. Malfoy, where is that book?”
My father’s face creased even more in displeasure.
“It’s alright.” Blaise gave me a rueful grin. “I need to head out anyways. I have a shoot today. Mind if I use your shower?” He gave me an appreciative once-over. “Pity that our time’s cut short.”
“Really? I was just asking to make sure you know what you’re doing.” Malfoy put his face close to Harry’s. “If not, I can show you.”
“You must be a strong Legilimens if you managed to use his attempt to breach your mind against him.” She digested information the same way I remember her studying before exams. “This definitely proves that you’re meant to find the Grimoire. And that you need to do it before this group does.”
There was silence for a minute or so. Then Hedwig said: “Hopkirk is an Unspeakable with the Department of Mysteries, in the research department. His cover is an employee with the Department of Transportation.”
Draco was aware he wore an obnoxious grin. How every stereotypical of him. And here he had imagined himself to be already set on the path for celibacy. Perhaps not.
“I was on a call with my parents,” I said. Harry had gone to fetch a drink for me at the bar.
“We also recovered the Shield and the Decoder,” Draco said. “I put them in the hallway.”
“What?” I moved back to admire my handiwork. It wasn’t a complex knot, but I approved of my choice. It really did bring out Potter’s eyes. “Are we what?”
But he couldn’t remain an Operative forever. Harry had to move on with his life, no matter how reluctantly. It was the nature of the world. The commensurate salary increase didn’t hurt either.
“I’m coming with you,” Potter said.
“Let’s keep looking,” Draco said. He didn’t want to think of the possible actions he might have to take to keep these out of Dolohov’s hands. “The Shield might be in here somewhere.”
“Tomorrow might be dangerous,” Harry said and his voice was low. Wistful, even. “Can we just, for a second, pretend like nothing’s wrong?”
Harry frowned. Why so low?
“Yes.” His eyes met mine. “I’m really glad that you came to my office that day. This has been quite an adventure so far.”
I flushed. Potter looked at me. “Must have been an oversight.”
Weasley gave Draco a distrustful look. “If I find out Harry’s somehow hurt, I’ll rip your balls off.”
Bullets peppered the deck as they scattered for cover.
“The audio will be off, so we won’t eavesdrop,” Riddle said, with the confidence of someone convinced he had already won. “There’s only one entrance to this room, by the way. Bella and Dolohov will be guarding it, so there’s no need to be foolish.” He called to Wormtail. “Let us go prepare the lab for Draco’s inspection.”
“WE are doing nothing. YOU are going to stay somewhere safe while I try to figure this out.” Granger nodded at her men, who carried the librarian out of my flat. She glanced at Potter. “Can you keep an eye on him?”
Draco scowled. “Compared to yours, yes.” Draco had booked an appointment for Harry with Draco’s own stylist once – it was an exercise in futility. Not that Draco would admit it, but he rather liked Harry like this. Much better than buzz cut Harry had sported when Draco had first reencountered Harry.
“Yes. Not only Aurors, but most of the Ministry security forces.”
Harry had heard of those, though not in precise detail. They were a potent mix of computer and physical viruses, designed specifically to target those with extensive bio-enhanced bodies.
“Sorry!” Draco shouted back. “I bought us some time, didn’t I? Anyways, you should be blaming Harry. He’s the one with the gun!”
Rolling his eyes, Draco settled against one of the pillars, out of sight should a passerby walked by the clear glass and peered inside. He waited, his entire body a twisted knot. There was no good explanation for why they would be here in the middle of the night.
There was a knock at the door.
He rearranged his legs, hoping a change in posture would shake him from his besotted, hormonal behavior.
I will, Hedwig promised. I receive millisecond updates from the medbots in your bio-mechanical prosthetics, and should be able to adjust before anything becomes remotely dangerous.
Releasing stimulant neurotransmitter, Hedwig thought. My sensors indicate that you require some sort of stimulant to function. You are on the verge of falling asleep.
But, bull-headed as he was, he still persevered, and in the end, worn me down to agreement. I had a sneaking suspicion that he would have secretly followed me in any case.
“Hello, pretty,” the man said. “We’ve heard about you. I knew your father, Draco.”
“He was a traitor,” Dolohov said. “No one betrays us. And he was the one who handled the transactions for the experts responsible for the breakthrough in the location of the Shield. He … intercepted some of them as insurance. He evidently thought giving that information to our enemies would have ensured his safety.” Dolohov gazed at Draco. “In a way, your help would wash away the sins of the father.” He inched closer.
“I was already being drawn into the hunt for Riddle,” Harry said. “That night, it was the night when they had found him, exposed, alone, without his guards. He was somewhere close by to the Burrow, irony of ironies. And I left – well, because I wanted to be the one to take care of him myself.”
“That was incredible.” He pulled out and laid his head on me. I could still feel his heat in me even as I was enveloped by his body.
“Molly wants to kill me anyways,” Draco grumbled. There was no love lost between the Weasleys and Draco’s own family. They had been rivals for three generations now, though it was like a match between a lion and a sheep – no contest at all.
“Goyle,” he shouted over the din. “We’re leaving. Come on!”
“I will make the necessary arrangements, my lord.”
“Ah. Of course.” I felt a sudden surge of jealousy. I was being ridiculous, I told myself. I had no reason to begrudge Potter his friends’ company. I took a sip of the coffee to avoid saying anything further.
“Yes, master.” Slytherin’s acolyte bowed his head. “I will do as you ask and ensure your legacy remains at this school.”
Draco peered over Harry’s shoulder. Harry hooked a finger into the crevice of the tile, so small that it was barely visible, and jiggled it.
It was not in Draco to deny Harry anything.  He left to arrange things with his mother so that Lucius would be kept out of the way.  Then they walked out into the garden together, Harry under the cloak.
“I know.”
It was only the thought of Harry that made him raise his wand and mutter the incantation.
Harry’s free hand touched the deep red scar right above the pelvic bone.  “I don’t know,” he answered.
“Thank you,” Harry said when the sun had properly risen and the last glorious bits of dawn were given way.
“I knew it!”
“I don’t know if I hurt either, to be honest,” said Draco.  With the only two fingers remaining in his left hand he picked up his discarded wand from the grass.  He murmured a healing spell to close off the wound in his arm, and then another on his bloody, stumpy fingers.  “I guess that will do for tonight,” he said as he took a tentative step towards the tent.
“I need you,” he said, throwing both of the doors open.  “Now.”
Draco squeezed his hand tight.  He was going to get to see Harry in situations he never had before.  He was going to fill his head with happy memories of them, to overwrite all the violence, and hatred, and bickering.  They were going to be together, to have a happily ever after, like heroes did in fairy tales.  Like Cepheus’s had in his mother’s story.
Somehow, going back to the clearing in the Forbidden Forest where Harry lay felt more like coming home than returning to the Manor had.  He crouched by the grave as the bits of brightness filtered in through the high canopy of leaves above them.  It was a golden hour of sorts, with the sounds of the forest filling the air around them.
“Did something happen?”
He shook his head and kissed him.  “No.”
Draco laughed.  “Yeah, with lots of baths.”
“Once upon a time…” she began.
And Harry would always answer with total candor, as if lying was beyond him. “No, but I was scared of you.”
“You sure you feel strong enough for this?” he asked for the third time.
She looked at him appraisingly and then, to his relief, got up.  They went through the corridors at a run. Draco noted that the portraits were all empty this time, and he could just picture all his puny, detestable ancestors crowding around the pictures in his room, hungry for disaster.
Draco was so surprised he jumped, looking around before remembering that Harry was invisible.  “I can’t believe you did that!”
“We hold out until the reinforcements Kingsley send come.” Harry checked his watch. “They should be here any minute.”
They moved out, Dolohov trailing after them with a wary distance.
“Why are you bringing wine with a duck on it for dinner with your parents? I doubt it’ll pair better with foie gras. And — hang on — is that Potter?”
Draco subsided back against the wall. He wished he could stretch his legs at least, but the area which was hidden from view was too small even for that. He was forced into a cramped half-sitting, half crouching position with his buttocks over his heels.
“They made a mess of the changing room,” Blaise said with a shake of his head. “And then somehow they got out and ran around terrorizing my assistants.”
Draco attempted to still his fear, taking slow sips of air through his nostrils. It was hard to breath, the atmosphere choked by dust, smelling fetid and stale. Odors of cooking clashed with sweat and unwashed bodies.
Malfoy recovered himself quickly, smoothing over his features like linen being ironed.
The book laid innocuously on the wooden table, absorbing the shadow from the numerous shelfs that jostled for space in the cavernous space. It was somewhat dim, the room being underground with the rest of the vaults, with the only illumination from the enormous chandelier. The space was surprisingly utilitarian, with straight-backed chairs and huge tables in dark wood hues. There was little other decoration. Dust floated gently, caught in the beams of light.
“We do have some lovely Muggle neighbors,” she said. “Old Mrs. Maple just had her third grandson. She’s a fat bouncing baby. Very adorable.” She gave a melodramatic sigh. “I wonder if I’ll even have one of my own in my lifetime.”
“You can multitask, can’t you? Besides, those two are linked somehow. I’m just as uncertain as you are about how, but all the indicators suggest that you are the best man for the job.”
Dolohov’s head poked through. “You’re dawdling,” he said with a cold sneer. “Better hurry up. It’s pointless to delay the inevitable.”
