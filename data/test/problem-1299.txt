Draco had already been frustrated with how things were on Čarobnjačkom, and that story increased his anger and determination. They should not be allowed to treat people as they do. That was when he made the decision that he was going to change everything. And well, he aimed high. The last six years, he had been working, pushing, and gaining support for his anti-slavery bill. He did not have the support in Čarobnjačkom for that, but there were other systems that did. If he could not change his planet, then he would change the galaxy.
Unfortunately for Father, he had not possessed that same talent with animals. He was walking in forest, barely meters from the edge, when a chimaera cornered him. He tried to escape it, tried to stun it, tried to restrain it, but it was all for not. He was killed within minutes. Even though the current beast tamer and I were nearby, there was nothing either could do to help Father. He was killed right in front of me.
Harry entered the kitchen, a basket of eggs balanced on top of a basket of apples at his hip. He had a lot of work before him. He just hoped he was able to finish it all to the standards the Dursleys expected.
Draco grinned. “Well then, farewell, Harry,” he said, “I hope to make your acquaintance again.” He smirked. “Maybe without getting hit with apples?” He chuckled as the blush brightened. Then he rode off, back to the palace. Lyra would be so happy with the apples. Pink Ladies were her favorite, and they had not been able to get any for several years.
“You’re a menace,” he griped as he turned back to the stars out the front window, “And what did you mean by that? What you said …”
The man shook his head. “It was decided he should remain at the manor, instead of here,” he answered. Draco vaguely remembered seeing a room in the house with smaller furniture, like it had belonged to a child. “Said the town would be too overwhelming for the boy who had just lost his father. His only parent.” The man rubbed his face. “I would have looked after him, but some relatives were brought in to care for him. Comtesse Lilian had an older sister, who had married a baron … I can’t remember the name.” He glanced up at the covered painting. “He should be eighteen by now. Soon, he’ll probably come back here.”
Luna, Draco’s cousin, smiled back and released his wrist. “It’ll be fine,” she said in her slightly airy voice, “Oh, it’s starting.”
“I will bring the diary over when we have all the other ingredients. No sooner.” Lucius said and Cas nodded
Harry nodded, watching the stars blur as they jumped to hyperspace. “If you want,” he replied. He had faint memories from his time in the palace, but those were from so long ago and buried under horrific ones. It would be good to know some about the tensions within the royal family.
Draco nodded, bringing his mind back to the current conversation. “Time changes everything,” he replied, “Especially people.”
Also, Harry had his parents all through his childhood. However, they were killed in a car crash the summer after Harry’s second year. They were on a trip as a family when a truck ran them off the road and into a tree filled ditch. Harry was the only survivor. As per Lily and James’ will, Sirius Black was appointed the boy’s guardian. So, Harry James Potter became Harry James Black, when Sirius adopted him and made him the heir to the Black family besides the heir to the Potter family. Thus, Harry never met the Dursleys, the family Lily wished she did not have.
The way to get to Durmstrang explained here is born from my own mind. Lots of times, Durmstrang is thought to be on an island somewhere in the North Sea. However, going off descriptions of mountains and glaciers (and looking at maps of northern eastern Europe), I decided to put the school up a fjord on the northwest side of Norway. I decided the students get there via ships (general consensus and the fact that Durmstrang students arrived at Hogwarts via ship. And also, teleporting ships, because how else would the ship get into the land-locked lake at Hogwarts?). I chose three ports/ships because the size difference. Eastern Europe is vastly larger than the UK, and it would be completely impractical for, say, a student from Austria to travel all the way up and over to Saint Petersburg, and then go to Norway. Three locations spread out over Eastern Europe makes more sense. Once the ships were out to open sea (and away from land/muggles), they would descend below the surface. Underwater, each would teleport out to the Norwegian Sea and resurface together. From there, they would north up the coast until they reached the fjord, and then up to the fortress. I have decided the ships must be equipped with some teleporting capabilities, since in canon the Durmstrang ship in the books surfaced in the landlocked lake at Hogwarts.
Severus apparently could still read this expression, because he continued his explanation. “There was …” He trailed off with a choked sound, as if the words were stuck in his throat. “He became so sick. So rapidly. Poison was considered, but nothing I did …” His eyes glistened, tears threatening to fall. “I couldn’t figure it out, and he died.”
“Destri.” he said in a commanding tone and the matchbox grew and morphed. When it was done it now was made of white gold with a stain glass cover depicting a red dragon in flight. When Draco opened it up it began to play a sad tune.
“Potter, Harry.” The woman called again looking pointedly at him. Hadrian smirked at her before she went on. Finally, he was the only one left standing.
Draco caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned back to watch the pair in gold. They had taken a step towards each other so their shoulders now brushed. They raised their wands out in front of their chests, and Draco realized they were opposite of each other: the one on the left right-handed, the one on the right left-handed. As one, they moved their wands in mirror images of the other, weaving intricate patterns. Above the students, the gas creatures began to spiral towards the center of the room, getting faster as they moved closer together. The creatures collided with a bright flash. When everyone regained their sight, they saw the crest of Hogwarts suspended in the air.
Draco tapped his fingers against the tabletop at his spot next to the window. He was impatiently sitting in a busy coffee shop. It was right near the campus, so it was crawling with college students. He, himself, had a large textbook spread out in front of him. Ethics. Or was it molecular physics? Maybe philosophy? He did not know. He was not a real student; he was just casing his mark, who should be crossing in front of the coffee shop any moment now.
“One more time,” she said, waving her sword as she walked back to their starting positions, “I’ll come at you with a downward strike.” She wiggled her eyebrows. “Block me.”
Remus listened, absorbing and analyzing. “You cared for him?” he asked, though it really was not a question. He could infer the answer.
Draco nodded, dropping his hand into his lap to cover his sister’s. He gave it a squeeze to let her know he was back in control of his emotions. “Thank you,
Harry followed his finger and groaned, shaking his head. “They’re too fine for me, sire,” he replied.
The prince smiled softly. “There’s nothing to be sorry for,” he replied, “It must be overwhelming. And unfortunately, there are a few more stocks in store for you.”
“Andromeda was disowned when she ran off and married a scavenger. She ‘sullied’ the bloodline by reproducing with a non- Krv Čista. Their daughter is a wonderful, bubbly klutz and is a Metamorphmagus, like her father,” Draco said with a smile, “We have lunch whenever she’s on Coruscant. She’s a blast.” Draco chuckled softly. “And I am Narcissa’s only child. Sirius decided to stay the Crown Prince for two reasons: one, it would piss off the King and two, I could do more good as a senator. That I had the chance and motivation to change the things that he couldn’t.”
Glancing down at Draco with a flirty smirk, Harry nonchalantly leaned his hip against the arm of the throne. The man then looked at the Dursleys and levered them with a  very unimpressed look. “Really?” he asked, the sarcasm dripping from his words, “I died, did I?”
The Baron Petunia Dursley was his mother’s older sister. She had married the Baron Dursley just before Lily had married James. Dobby had shared some gossip he had heard. Petunia was jealous of her sister, of her beauty, of her grace, of her personality. She was always passed over in favor of Lilian. Their father, Swedish ambassador Valter Eka, had married her off to the first noble that showed interest: the Baron Dursley. There were rumors that Petunia was angry that she, the eldest sister, married a baron while her younger sister married a comte.
Draco finished his apple and sighed. He pressed a kiss to the top of Lyra’s head. “Something the caretaker said is bothering me,” he said as he stood up, “I need to go to the noble registry. I think … there might be a noble claiming land that is not his.”
Lyra nodded, still clutching tight around his waist. Draco sighed and glanced at the guards. The men were staring unwaveringly forward, ignoring the pair. Draco then maneuvered them into the room and closed the door back. He led Lyra to a chaise, sitting down as well when she refused to let him go.
And then the blond had another surprise for him. He had come back with an old man. An old man who tickled something buried deep in Harry’s mind. When the man had spoken, the memories had risen to the surface. Things Harry had long discounted as dreams: playing on the floor next to the man in the paintinf, running through the gardens with this older man right on his heels, Dobby as he called him. How could he had ever forgotten all of that?
Draco sat up as well, rearranging them on the chaise. “When I rode out to clear my head, I came across an orchard of them,” he answered. He leaned back, wincing as his shoulder blade rubbed against the back of the chaise. It seemed he had a bruise from where the apple hit him. “I don’t think the caretaker liked me.”
Harry rolled his eyes in exasperation but went willing with Draco. A few minutes later, they reached the study with the painting. Draco settled Harry back against the desk before turning to remove the cloth again. He heard a small gasp behind him. Draco turned to see Harry staring up at the painting in shock.
Why was Draco, a trained killer and mercenary, dealing with the pervert professor? Dr. Piers had exploited the wrong students: a set of twins, Nika and Anton, in different section of his economics course. What was so special about these two students? They were the heir and heiress of a Russian mobster. And thus, Draco was hired to take care of the man.
A throat cleared, disturbing the soft ambience, but Harry could not muster up the energy to jump. He glanced up and saw Draco. Heat bloomed throughout his body at the sight of the blond man. He knew he should not … swore to himself that he would not … But Harry just could not resist how he felt when in the Prince’s presence. He walked to him, careful not to show his back or how weak he felt. He remembered how the blond been with simple black eye; he worried about how Draco would react to lashes.
“Well, Bill and Charlie are like us but they are off doing jobs elsewhere in the world.” Said Fred. Hadrian noticed that Fred’s voice was a bit deeper than George’s and he seemed a bit calmer.
I’m sorry if any of the Russian terms is used incorrectly. I decided to use archaic Russian family terms, because I feel like that would be something Russian Purebloods would do: hold to the older versions of the language to expression their superiority.
Draco stared out a stained glass window, the colored glass distorting the world outside. He absently ran his fingers over the frame, lost in thought. Still nothing. He had hoped this house would give some answers, but he was wrong.
The Jedi stood there, robe billowing in the wind. Draco could barely see the other’s face with the hood up against the cold. Light and shadows played over the Knight’s features.
“Why don’t you boys go explore, the wolf pack is by the lake if you wish to visit them. All I ask is that you take Bartholomew and Toto with you. They have been cooped up in the house for far too long.” Hadrian’s father said from where he sat at the table. Hadrian nodded and grinned happily at Draco causing Draco to smile back. They left the cottage and headed towards the stables with the two wolves following.
Deciding she looked as good as she was going to get, Petunia left the entryway and walked down to where the carriage was waiting. With the boy gone, they had to rehire some of their former servants, the twins of that redheaded brood. The two were not her first choices, but the elder siblings had found employment on a different estate. Even through her gloves, her skin crawled from their commonness and hatred burning in their eyes as one of them helped her up.
* I have attention issues and get bored easily. So, I have been working on all of my different stories at the same time (not writing full chapters, but still progressing all of them)
“And I was her sister!” she yelled, startling everyone. Even Draco’s parents. And Lyra emerged from her book. Miracles could happen, apparently. “But that didn’t stop her from ruining my life!”
Hermione cleared her throat. “I’m Senator Hermione Granger,” she answered, “I am close friends to both Senator Malfoy and Knight Wolfe.” She and McLaggen turned to look at the other man in the room.
Lucas, oh, his beautiful Lucas. He worked as Draco’s beast tamer for a little over a year. Luca was the antithesis of him; where Draco was light, Luca was dark. The man’s ebony skin was flawless and a striking contrast to Draco’s pale ivory. Luca had started two years ago. Draco thought the man was beautiful, though not really his type. He was broad, muscular, and well-toned. Draco covertly watched him for six months; his every move oozed strength and power. Draco remembered when Lucas first showed interest in him …
A loud clatter sounded in the silent courtyard as Draco’s sword fell to the ground. Lyra smirked as she held the point of her sword just below her brother’s throat. A
"Come on, Draco. Let's get this over with." Hadrian said before they headed over to the giant. Once all the first-years were gathered together they made their way to boats.
“It’s an emergency, Dr Piers,” he said, changing the tone of his voice to pleading. It made him sound younger. He had also raised the volume of his words, so they would be easily heard within, as well as down the hallways. “Please, I need your help.”
Once the young Knight was gone, Master Flitwick turned to McGonagall. “You did not tell Harlan he would be going back to Čarobnjačkom,” he noted, “This could be very traumatic to the man.”
Harry groaned softly as he woke up. He frowned. He was laying on something soft, softer than anything he had ever lain on before. And the bedding … It was smooth, not rough, and he was warm. He could feel a heavy blanket weighing down comfortably on him. Where
Beside him, Draco stood up. He walked over to stand before the thrones, immediate in front of the Durselys. Harry knew the man well enough to knew he was smirking, enjoying this. Harry’s enjoyment was tempered with anger and sadness, but this would be cathartic for him.
And there Draco was, left on the pad. Alone. A throat cleared. Oh right. He was alone, with a group of bureaucrats. Perfect.
Draco took the man’s hand to offer some comfort, and led him up the stairs. Reaching the door, he pulled a key out of his pocket; Dobbeson had given it him before they left the last time. ‘So you won’t break in again,’ the old man had said. Draco smiled at Harry as he pushed open the door.
Harry nodded, sitting down. Draco joined him. He reached into the basket and began to serve them. It was really nice, but what he needed to tell the other man was eating away at him. Draco distracted himself by looking at the other man.
Draco answered before he could. “Wolfe,” he said, “This is my friend. He asked to accompany me when I told him I was leaving, because he didn’t want me to have to travel alone.” The blond wrapped his arm around his shoulders. “Isn’t that just the sweetest?”
“My night couldn’t get much worse could it.” He mumbled before mentally preparing himself for the Gryffindor.
“When you’re at school, if a teacher comments about the dark art in any way that you do not like, tally it in your head. Don’t lash out immediately. Wait for an opportune moment and then strike back.” Cas said in a normal voice as if talking about the weather.
“Of course Father, but it says I can only have an owl, a toad or a cat. Why can’t I bring Toto?” Cas cast a freshening spell on himself and changed into a set of black robes.
His friends nodded, though he could see the curiosity about the stone written all over their faces. Hadrian debated for a bit, about telling them what exactly the Headmaster hid there with all the students. After a moment, he decided he trusted his friends; over the previous term, they had become very close and protective of each other. “The stone is the Philosopher’s stone.”
He blushed, thinking of the siblings. The man, who he met before, and his little sister. Draco and Lyra. The
What a shocker. The respectable Lord Malfoy had tattoos, as in more than one. The first was a not well thought out. That one resided on Draco’s left forearm. It was a snake slithering out of the mouth of a skull. It was an identifier for a cult. He would willingly admit that he had been a part of an elitist group. The motto was ‘Pureblood is the only blood’. Draco only lasted two months before he was kicked out by the leader, Theo Nott, because he was not devoted enough to the cause. Draco had never really wanted to be a member, so it was fine when he got the booted. However, the tattoo could not be removed, so he was stuck with the reminder of his stupidity and gullibility. The other tattoo was on his right shoulder. It was another snake, but this one wrapped around his upper bicep, ending with its fangs spread at the base of his neck. Draco loved this one because it reminded him of the dangers of life. Life was fragile and could be taken in seconds. This snake was jet black with vivid green eyes.
“I want you to make them into music boxes. Any style.” She said. Hadrian nodded and she moved on. Draco picked up his matchbox, looked it over and set it back down.
Draco grabbed the fabric and pulled it off. That left him in just his thin undershirt. He sighed in relief. The wind went right through the material and cooled him down. “Much better,” he murmured, then looked to the other man. And frowned.
Draco shook his head. “The Chancellor knew,” he answered, “And he asked the Jedi Council o assign me a bodyguard.”
Draco frowned. That was all the book said. How useless. He moved that one aside and moved on to the next. A few hours later and still nothing. Shifting through a stack of documents, he finally found something. A death certificate. For Comtesse Lilian Potter. Cause of death was complications from child birth. Underneath, he found another a birth certificate. What his mother had said was true. But what happened after? He kept looking, and his throat tightened when he found another death certificate. This one was for Comte Jameson Potter, four years later. Hunting accident. So. What happened to the child?
Fudge took that moment to take command of the conversation again. “Pleasure to meet you, my boy,” he said, shaking Haydrien’s hand, “I want to introduce you to someone. Maybe you can help me.”
“The charges,” Draco continued, “Theft of property of a noble of higher rank, abuse of a noble of higher rank, and attempted murder of a noble of higher rank.” Harry could tell the blond was really enjoying this. He would be too, if it was not so awful.
The man nodded. “Yes, I gave Knight Wolfe aid on board the ship,” he answered, “Rudimentary aid, given I was working with a basic med-kit.”
Outside the courtroom, I found Harry waiting for me. He asked if I cared to get a drink with him, and I agreed. As we walked, Harry pulled something out of his pocket and held it out to me. It was my wand he stole when he was at the Manor. He said he wanted me to have it back, and to know that without it, he never would have succeeded in defeating the Dark Lord. I accepted and shared a companionable afternoon with the man I loved.
“No, he’s more likely to nitpick your essay. And mine too since we’re friends. That and he hated my biological father.” Hadrian said and they got to work barely speaking except to help the other.
The most becoming blush spread across the other man’s cheeks. “Harry,” he answered with a shy smile, “My name is Harry.”
Draco hummed as he navigated the ship. “Well, if you weren’t a Jedi, they would believe you were my lover,” he said with a wink and an eyebrow wriggle, “But we’ll want to keep you in uniform, to intimidate and scare anyone with intensions to hurt me. Also, you look very dashing in that.” Another wink.
“I have a present for you,” he murmured, reaching for his bag. Lyra’s head popped up. Even though her eyes were red and puffy, which he felt extremely guilty about, she had that mischievous and excited glint to her silver eyes. The same look she always got when Draco brought her something.
“I was in the archives earlier,” Draco drawled, taking a sip of his wine to play at nonchalance, “Looking through the noble registry to evaluate the different families, when one caught my eye.” He heard Lyra try to swallow her giggles against her cup, and he attempted to kick her under the table, to no avail. “Potter,” he stated, “I’m not familiar with them.” His eyes flicked between his mother and father to gauge their reactions.
Of course, not all of that was visible to Draco from the window. The grounds were vast, spreading out for many kilos around the manor. The grounds were not natural, enchanted into their current state. It was done centuries ago by Taurus Malfoy. This was the Malfoy line's ancestral home, so, of course, a Malfoy created the grounds. The window faced south, so the current visible piece of the ring was the forest.
“Down to business.” He said as Lucius sat, “I don’t have to warn you about what would happen to you if any of this got to the wrong ears.” Lucius nodded
The siblings continued down the streets until finally Draco held up a hand to Lyra to stop. They had reached the townhouse. It was on the end of a row of houses that belonged to various courtiers. Draco hopped down from his horse, then went to help Lyra. The pair tied their horses up to the fence and climbed the stairs.
Finding Dobbeson took longer than Draco expected, but eventually, after searching through two floors, he found the old man up in the attic. They made their way back down to the study. Draco opened the door and looked around.
Draco was distracted from his murderous annoyance by Severus reentering the cockpit. He immediately turned to look at the older man. Draco tried to get a read on him, but Severus, at that moment, was impossible to read. It appeared he would have to get information the traditional way. By asking. Ick. But, needs must and all that.
“You, Dudley Dursley,” Draco atoned, drawing the man’s attention. The man had been horror-struck as he looked between his parents. “Did you know of all this?”
“Come along, boys,” Lucius said, Narcissa’s hand held in the crook of his arm, “The Minister is expecting us.” Draco stepped into pace with Haydrien as they walk behind the pair. Ahead of them loomed a giant stadium.
Piers slipped into an apartment building, swiping his card to unlock the door. Draco waited about ten minutes before approaching the door. Earlier in the week, he had made a clone of the building’s card. He had stolen a youth mother’s card as he helped her get her shopping and infant out of the car and up to her apartment; he had returned it the next day, claiming he had found it on the ground outside by her car.
“Because he was scared,” a voice said behind him, causing Draco to jump dramatically. He turned and glared at Severus, who just smirked as he sat in the copilot’s chair.
“Very well. I called you here because you have a duty to the wizarding community. You are the Boy-Who-Lived and you must defeat the Dark Lord.” Dumbledore said sagely, as if it was a grave thing he was saying.
, meaning there was a two inch strip of exposed skin on the outside of each leg. The ‘pants’ were then tucked into dragon-hide boots, the only normal thing of the whole outfit. The shirt was a
Those plans went up in smoke when the head bureaucrat stepping into Draco’s path. He only just stopped himself from groaning. Maybe Granger would come with him. To keep him company. And to stop him from killing the bureaucrats.
“Looking good, love,” Draco whispered to Harry just loudly enough for Lyra, who was only a couple of steps away, to hear. Louder, he said, “Care to battle a master?” His tone was arrogant and cocky. Oh, Lyra would love knocking him down a few pegs.
So, I included the link to the image of the Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe coronation because this is sort of what I imaged for this coronation: with Draco and Harry as Peter and Edmund, and Lyra as Susan.
Oh, this man was Draco’s tutor, and his cousin’s lover. Harry vaguely remembered a man with black hair and a large nose looming around them. He does not get the impression of being scared from the memory. He does get the same warm and fuzzy feeling he gets whenever he is near Remus. A feeling of being loved and protected. He wondered if the man would recognize him, but he reasoned that if Draco did not then the other would not either.
“Wingardium Leviosa is a basic spell because it doesn’t require much power to produce. However, they always fail to mention that it takes quite a bit of concentration at first to master. I would suggest practicing it for a while in a quiet place without anything to distract you. Once you get the spell to work constantly there, you should work on it in increasingly more crowded and noisy places.” Hadrian explained
With one last glance at Harry, Draco nodded. The guards snapped to attention. The drummers, stationed that corners of the yard, began to beat an ominous rhythm which echoed against the stone walls. The crowd buzzed with anticipation. After a few moments later, the gate opened, and three people stepped out: two guards with the criminal between.
Draco smiled wistfully at the memory. Harry was the greatest best friend Draco could have. We were nearly inseparable during those years. The other boy had such a connection to animals. Harry showed Draco many creatures as they grew up. Draco thought he wanted to follow his parents' footsteps and become a beast tamer. Already, he was able to influence some of the more dangerous creatures not to attack us.
. Draconis. The attack. Burning. Jumping into the ship. Then nothing. That was where his memories stopped. What had happened after?
The book had been enlightening. There is not much known to the greater public about alchemy. Alchemy was generally considered a Light art. Based on what the book said, it was actually dark. Very dark. There were detailed instructions for the process of making a Philosopher’s stone. Necromancy, Dark but mostly socially accepted, seemed tame in comparison; even with bringing back a person, there was no human sacrifices involved. If only everyone knew the truth. He had chuckled to himself at that thought.
Harry nodded, settling down in his seat. He wrapped himself up in his robe, feeling chilled. Space was cold, but he was pretty sure it was memories from his childhood, of running around without a shirt all year, that made him cold at the moment. Memories he had repressed were resurfacing, proving to Harry just how not ready he was to go back to Čarobnjačkom.
“Zabini, Blaise Zabini. It’s a pleasure to meet you Heir Mort.” The dark-skinned boy said. Hadrian took his hand and shook it once
"It will be remedied immediately if you have the key we can…" the goblin began but his father cut in
“This is outrageous,” Vernon spat. Petunia could tell he was working himself up to a full tirade. In those moments, she knew decorum is the last thing on his mind. If he had his tantrum here, it would drastically affect their already shaky standing.
Draco chuckled. It was one of their old riddles, to make sure it was the other before opening the door. In case it was one of their parents. He cleared his throat. “The Dragon Constellation,” he answered.
After a minute, the older blond turned to his nephew. “It would seem,” he drawled, “that a zealot has escaped confinement.” His tone was matter of fact, as if conversing on the weather.
Lyra smiled and picked up the man’s sword. “Not as much as the other times,” she said, winking. She offered him his sword. Harry rolled his eyes at her before taking it back.
“You’re not allowed to have books like that. Headmaster Dumbledore banned all books about necromancy from the library and if he thinks they're bad then they must be.” She said smartly.
Hadrian had never seen so many people before. There was a muggle town about thirty miles south of his home but even that had barely a tenth of the people that were in Diagon Alley. Father had only chuckled and grabbed Hadrian’s hand as they pushed their way through the crowd.
Hermione nodded. “Thank you,” she replied. The hologram of the Knight disappeared, leaving emptiness with the occasional blip of static. After a minute, the call connected to an empty room. Well, not actually empty. She could hear someone moving around and grumbling that sounded like “Twice. Twice now.” Then, Remus appeared on the hologram. A very sleepy looking, rumpled Remus. Hermione arched an eyebrow; she had never seen the Knight look that disheveled. He blinked slowly a few times at her, then jumped, flailing around a bit. She could not hold in her laughter.
Draco barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes. Of course, the masters would be enigmatic and only give him the barest of details. “I am Senator Malfoy,” he answered, “And you are coming with me to Čarobnjačkom.” The Knight’s whole body tensed and his eyes widened in fear, much to Draco’s surprise. Interesting reaction for a Jedi. “Let’s go,” he said, turning back towards his ship, “We have a tight schedule to follow.” He glanced over his shoulder to make sure the Jedi was coming. After a moment of hesitation, the other man began walking. Draco turned back around and headed to the cockpit, checking everything one last time.
The Felidaen tilted her head to the side, her ears moving as she thought. “’Him’? Your Jedi protector is a guy?” she asked, “What’s his name? I know a lot of Knights. If you remember, I studied –”
The other man smiled back, but he looked off. Tired. Beaten down, more so than before. Draco could have sworn he saw the man wove a little bit as he walked, but passed that thought off as his overactive, protective imagination. He walked forward to embrace the servant. Comte, he corrected in his mind. That was going to be a fun conversation. But food first; that would hopefully soften the blow.
She waved at her husband at those words. The man, who had been staring at his wife in shock since the start of her rampage, finally moved. He sputtered, his face getting red in anger as she insulted him. “You’re no catch,” he retorted, “I only married you because there was no one else willing. And your father offered me a hefty dowry.”
I just stand there, stocked. His words are not processed by my brain. It could not be. Harry, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, The Boy Who Lived Twice, The Savior of the Wizarding World, could not be dead. It must be a mistake. I stare at the box Kingsley holds, not comprehending. Slowly I reach out and take it from him. I gently lift the lid.
Air control was taking them to the landing pad closest to the hospital. Each city has its own medical facilities, but Cadmus had the largest, being the capital and all. The planet’s university is right next to it, which is very convenient for their medical students. Ever the knowledge seeker, Hermione spent most of her time there when she was not needed in government.
Lyra smirked, slowly bringing her sword over her head in an exaggerated move. Harry brought his sword up to guard his face. With a wink, she brought her sword down. The clang of metal on metal rang out. Lyra grinned; Harry had successfully blocked her without falling over.
Draco chewed on his lip, feeling extremely guilty. The Knight would not have gotten hurt if he had not stubbornly demanded to go to Čarobnjačkom. They were nearing the landing pad, so Draco pushed down those feelings to focus on landing the ship. The faster he landed, the faster Harry, no
Remus nodded. He leaned forward a bit, resting his arms on the bed. Harry. His Padawan. The boy he watched grow to be a man. The boy he trained to be a fierce but compassionate warrior. It had been years since Harry had been injured enough to go to a hospital.
After asking around to a couple of servants, Draco made his way to Lyra’s chambers. Apparently, his sister had managed to escape their mother’s clutches. A worthy feat. He knocked on her door.
He also had an idea about using the Elixir in the ritual for the Dark Lord. In an old shaman’s journal, he had found directions for creating a new body for a restless soul; with the Dark Lord’s horcruxes keeping him arching to the land of the living, he counted. It would be best if he had more of the Dark Lord’s horcruxes when he preformed the ritual, but the one Lucius has will suffice. The diary was the oldest of the horcruxes, so it will therefore contain the largest part of the Dark Lord’s soul.
Hadrian hummed, putting a bookmark to hold his place. “How about the common room?” he asked as he looked around the group. Since no one else in the house had stayed over break, there was no one to complain about the two Gryffindors hanging out in the rooms. Also, their redheaded moronic stalker could not follow them inside. Total privacy.
“Because I found the Knight unconscious with a blaster wound to his side,” Severus replied, tone reminiscent of times in the past when he thought Draco to be extremely idiotic, “He needs professional medical attention, preferably on a planet that does not want you dead.”
The pair continued through the trees, looking for a good place for their picnic. They finally found a spot and dismounted. Draco took basket off his saddle while Lyra set up the blankets. With the horses tied off to a tree, they settled in: Draco with his head in Lyra’s lap and Lyra reading a book, occasionally running her fingers through his hair. And so, they waited.
Harry was going to throw up. He needed to get himself under control. To stop panicking. To breathe. He leaned against the wall and starting to count as he took deep breaths. Like Snape taught him to do whenever he had panic attacks. Which he got occasionally due to his past.
He frowned when two figures dressed in dark gold robes slowly opened the large doors. He had thought the Hogwarts’ uniform robe was black. The hoods of the robes were up, hiding the pairs’ faces and gender from the watching students. The two nodded to each other, and the one of the right drew its wand. With a silent wave, a badger made of colored gas appeared above the open doorway. A double line of students in black robes with yellow badges appeared under it. They walked to the left side of the hall and stopped. The badger followed them and paused above their heads, looking around curiously. Draco leaned close to Alexei’s ear. “
It took him a lot of effort to not smile like a love-struck loon at Draco. The Dauphin. The middle of a trial was not the time to show off his affections towards the other man to the court. He turned back to facing the Dursleys. He wanted to watch their faces, to see their reactions when their sentences were read out.
Harry might have been graceful when he walked, like a jaguar on the prowl. But the moment he had a sword in his hand, he was like a fawn discovering how his legs worked. This was their third practice. The man had the proper grip down, but the footwork was tripping him up. Literally.
Draco stopped it, giving his sister a meaningful look. “A dress,” he said, “We will be out with the townspeople, and it is unbefitting of a princess to be seen in pants.”
Draco grumbled as he was slowly led to the landing pad by Felidae’s air control. Very, very slowly. Don’t they remember this was a medical emergency landing? He really wished his ship had a horn, like his speeder. He would definitely be laying on it if he had one. Why was this taking so long?
The Baron sputtered, his face an interesting mix of pale and bright red; horror and anger warring for dominance on its pudgy canvas. But it was the Baroness that soon drew attention. Her face had contorted into an ugly, rage filled snarl. The other courtiers backed up from her.
Severus nodded, taking the cloak and lightsaber. The man then head down after the hover stretcher. Draco followed a moment later, intending to go to the hospital with them.
They walked over to their seats, and to a man in robes styled in the Eastern European fashion. “This is Edgar Oblansk, Bulgarian Minister of Magic,” he introduced, “And he does not speak English either. Do you happen speak any Bulgarian?”
Draco woke up to loud banging on his bedroom door. He blurrily opened one of his eyes and squinted angrily at the bright sunshine sneakily peaking out from under the heavy drapes across the windows. He did not want to get up. Today was not a day he wanted to face. Maybe if he was quiet, she would go away.
Severus nodded, visibly pulling himself back together. “Thank you,” he said. He coughed softly and rearranged the book on his lap. “Back to my story. Once Prince Draconis was born, I was recommended to be his caretaker and later tutor.” He smiled faintly, obviously remembering sweet moments from the Senator’s childhood.
Severus frowned, nodding. “Yes, it was,” he answered, “And what a bloody war, if I’m recalling correctly. One of the Elven races attacked the other three, right?”
That woman certainly had a pair of lungs, Draco could give her that. Since she was there, it had to be four o’clock. She determined to ‘help’ him get ready for the ‘party’. This party she planned had been the bane of Draco’s existence for the last two weeks. He did not, under any uncertain terms, want to attend, even if he was the guest of honor.
Before the angry boy could explode again, the Minister finally noticed the quartet. Haydrien barely held back his eye roll. Cornelius Fudge was a useless, meek wizard, but he was the perfect puppet for their Lord, with Lucius as the puppeteer.
Severus bit his lip and shook his head. “No, not exactly,” he answered, “I mean, I don’t know the man, the Jedi Knight Harlan Wolfe. I knew the child, Harry.”
“Harry, this is my sister, Princess Lyra,” Draco said, waving his hand at her, “Lyra, this is Harry.”
Harry shrugged those thoughts away. It would not do him well to dwell on his hatred of the Dursleys. It would not change anything, except possibly get him fired. He did not know what he do if the Dursleys got rid of him. The estate was all he had known his entire life.
Draco stood back to let the pair work. He dismissed the Marquis, who was looking rather green. Harry’s back was cleaned. The cuts were stitched up. A paste was spread over everything to help with healing before the whole thing was bandaged. The pair left, and Draco made his way to the bed. He brushed a piece of raven hair away from the man’s face.
That was the start of our tentative friendship … later relationship. Our first date was to a muggle movie: a silly, epic drama about pirates. For it being something muggle, the evening was quite enjoyable. Our first kiss was during a romantic picnic on the hills overlooking Loch Ness. Our first intimate endeavor was on a beach in Iceland. He proposed on the top of the Eiffel Tower (after insisting that we take the stairs to the top). We were married on the shores of the Black Lake on the Hogwarts' grounds, with our friends and family all gathered around. One year after the wedding, we adopted a beautiful baby girl and named her Laetitia Siria Potter-Malfoy. In total, we have been together for 5 years.
I pull myself together enough to pull my daughter into my arms, hugging her to me. "Sweatheart," I whisper, "Da-Da is not going to come home."
Once they were alone, door locked, Draco dropped his bag, the textbook inside making a loud thud. With a dramatic sigh, he started to walk around the room. He knew it drove marks crazy, how calm and unconcerned he was. As special instructions, Vadim Kuznetsov had told Draco to torment the man a bit before killing him. While Draco was not fond of physically torturing people, he could psychological.
Harry looked to the thrones and saw Draco pull out a stack of parchments. When the blond cleared his throat, all eyes zeroed in on the Dauphin. The courtiers around them vaguely knew what was going on, but not the specifics. The three Dursleys flinched a little at the harshness of the sound, and Harry could not help feeling a bit smug.
Draco shook his head as he walked towards her chambers. Such the flare for the dramatic. It must run in their genes, since there was lots of shouting and door slamming during the argument. Got to love that fiery royal blood.
I'm sorry it took forever for me to post. I overcame vast amounts of writer's block and lack of motivation to finish it. But, it's longer than the first part (by almost 3k words!!), so I hope that makes up for it. =)
“Forgive me. I am not used to human contact and you caught me off guard.” Cas said calmly bowing slightly. The other man glared at him
“I don’t care.” Hadrian said before going back to his book. It was only then that the idiot realized what he was reading
Draco nodded, checking the controls. “I know,” he said, “We’ll be there shortly. Severus is with him.”
The older man rolled his eyes at Draco and then stood up. “Let’s go greet the welcoming committee, shall we?” he asked in a bored tone.
For the rest of the day, Harry continued on with his duties. The time in the orchard had taken a large chunk of his day. Normally, that would not be that big of a deal, but today it was. The Baron and Baroness were holding a feast for Dudley, in celebration of his eighteenth birthday, which Harry was in charge of preparing. Even though the young baron’s birthday was before Harry’s, they had postponed the celebration because some of his friends were out of the country.
Remus remembered that argument. And, he also remembered the sex afterwards … Pinning Severus to the wall … The red bite marks across pale skin … the combined smell of their release. He mentally shook away those thoughts, returning himself to the present.
. It barely covered anything. It stopped above Draco belly button, exposing a pale blond happy trail and a
Harry always sent me letters when he must leave for his job. Being the lover of an Auror was a hard life, but one I would never give up. Harry, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, and the Savior, was the best Auror in the department. He always catches the Dark witches or wizards, always fighting crime, always saving the day. He was such a hero, and that's why I love him.
---.---.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--
Harry huffed, standing back up. “Well, that was embarrassing,” he said as he brushed the dust from his leather pants.
“It seems you do not know very much. Peter Pettigrew did indeed seem to work for the Dark Lord but he was only a spy for Dumbledore. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to pay for these.” Cas said stepping past Sirius Black and up to the counter.
Looking out over the courtiers, Draco’s eyes narrowed in on Harry. Unlike before, when the man was been subtly hiding behind the others, Harry was standing tall, in all his noble, righteous anger. The others parted as the man made his way towards the front. Confidently, Harry walked through the gap between the courtiers and the thrones to stand next to Draco’s.
. It was hard to wrap his head around. That the sweet, demour child became the stunning Jedi Knight he met on the flight over to
The Knight nodded. “I am,” he said, then frowned, “One thing I don’t understand. Why are you so adement for abolishing slavery?” He ducted his head a little, almost like he was expecting a hit or something.  Draco would file that reaction away to be analyzed later. “I mean, you grew up on a planet where slavery is deeply rooted in its culture. It seems a bit strange that you would reject that so whole-heartedly.”
“There was a considerable amount of damage,” McLaggen said, “Large blaster burn, cracked skull, four fractured ribs, and a broken wrist.”
It was true. Draco had no patience for children. He loved his nephews, but he could only handle them in small doses. Like, twenty minutes at most. It was also true, that his patience was pushed by most of humanity. That was probably why he enjoyed being an assassin so much. He got paid to help cull the hoards.
“I have a friend in the Temple,” Severus said. Draco was surprised, and very curious. Severus never mentioned having a Jedi as friend, never in all the time the man had been his tutor and proxy father figure. Draco knew the man went to university on Coruscant, so he guessed anything was possible. “Once Harlan was as stable as I could make him, I sent a message to Re – my friend, asking about the Knight. Since most information about Jedis is classified to outsiders, he told me what he could.”
“Granger,” Draco said, turning to face his friend, “Would you – ” He cut off when he saw her walking towards the medical team. That was odd. “Granger?” he called after her.
"Hello, Hadrian. I think it's time to go, don't you?" He murmured rocking the toddler into a deeper sleep.
Right before the war began, I came to terms with the fact that, while I loved Harry Potter, it would never be; we were on opposite sides of the soon-to-be battle. I never wanted to be on the dark side. My first act of rebellion was when I could not killed Dumbledore. My second came as I refused to identify a very swollen-faced Harry when the Snatchers dragged him and his friends into the Manor. When Harry pulled me from room of hidden things, from the cursed fire, I hoped against all odds that it meant he cared about me.
“Twenty points to Ravenclaw for helping another student and explaining successfully how to transfigure something.” Professor McGonagall said from right behind Draco. Draco jumped in surprise and when Hadrian chuckled at him, he pouted. McGonagall moved on to observe other students as well as collect something from her desk. When she returned she set down two match boxes in front of them
“I know.” Was all Lucius said before leaving the cottage; Cas looked down at his forgotten tea. He just hoped that those around him could forgive him for his mistakes.
“What is it with people barging into other people’s compartments without knocking?” Hadrian asked Draco, ignoring the girl completely. She humphed before noticing the book that Hadrian was reading
Glancing to his left, Draco could see Harry, who was scratching his neck. Draco bit his lip to stop from laughing at his love. While it was amusing how uncomfortable Harry was in the formal attire, now was not the proper time. Glancing to his right, Draco smirked at Lyra. She looked thoroughly annoyed as she cooled herself with an ornate fan. She was not happy to be out there. Firstly, she was required to be out there with him and Harry, in the awful heat. Secondly, their mother had forced Lyra into
“I thought you lost that gift. I thought you weren’t a seer anymore.” Lucius said softly. Cas looked down into his teacup,
On that day, the garden no longer contained white roses. On that day, Draco bewitched the white rose bushes to bloom black flowers. On that day, Draco decided to shield his heart from love because love hurt too much.
The man’s bright green eyes light up. “You’re from England as well?” he prodded as he plopped into the seat, “It’s so nice to meet someone from home. I’m Harry.” He stuck out his hand.
“DRACONIS LUCIUS MALFOY! I KNOW YOU ARE IN THERE, PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP! YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO AVOID THIS PARTY! YOU HAD BETTER OPEN THIS DOOR THIS INSTANT! SO HELP ME, IF I HAVE TO REMOVE THESE WARDS, YOU WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUNCES!”
There was a hiss of pressure being released, and the bay door slowly began to lower. Draco stood at attention, hands resting against the small of his back with thumbs interlocked and fingers extended. He wished he was a bit more formally dressed. Not to the extent of his Prince garb, but at least his Senator attire. Felidae was big on ceremony; he hoped they would excuse his informality based on the circumstances. Next to him, Severus mimicked the stance.
*gasp* What's this? Another chapter?! Magic!! It's not as long as the last one, but it's longer than the other chapters I've been posting recently. <3
Draco sighed dramatically, snapping his book closed and draping himself over Hadrian. “I’m so bored,” he whined, his eyes darting to the bookshelves and back, “Why don’t we go somewhere more comfortable?”
After dragging Lyra from her books, the pair made their way to the family dining room. They stood by their chairs and waited patiently for their parents to arrive. After only a couple of minutes, King Lucius and Queen Narcissa entered. Then, they all sat.
Apparently, the other man wanted conversation. Draco could handle that. He could be polite, charming, when the situation called for it. He turned a page and was completely confused by the diagram display. “Yes, I am,” he answered, hiding his confusion behind a smug mask, “Chemistry Masters. What about you?” He looked back to the other man. The book in front of him was thick and titled “Cognitive Development”.
For a few moments, Harry allowed himself to enjoy the early morning sunlight dancing over his skin. He then patted the sill and straightened up. He sighed, turning back to face the room. Absently, he opened his trunk. He glanced back out the window, smiling faintly.
The other man just shook his head, waving his hand at the other man. “It’s nothing,” he reassured, “Don’t worry.” He smiled weakly. “So, I’m surprised you’re here again.” He bit his lip. “Not that I’m complaining or anything. I like you being here.” He ducked down, obviously embarrassed.
“Ravenclaw!!” The hat shouted and his once plain black tie changed until it was bronze and blue. The Ravenclaws were cheering and celebrating. They had gotten the Mort heir who was also technically Harry Potter. Hadrian glanced at the Slytherin table where Draco was sitting. Draco grinned at him and did a shooing motion. Hadrian grinned wickedly and went to join his new housemates.
Draco nodded back, then turned to the guards back at the door. “Take them away,” he said, motioning to the former Baron and Baroness, “They’ll await in the dungeons.” He turned back to Dudley. “I can have a guide found to take you to your lands, if you wish.”
“ – in the Archives of the Temple,” Draco recited with a small smile. He had heard her say it enough to be able to repeat it from memory. “His name is Harlan Wolfe.”
Draco laughed maliciously. “Well, of course, he is family, after all,” he drawled. If possibly, the boy looked even more horrified. The twins laughed at their brothers’ distress, and even the little girl looked amused.
With the stable done, Harry walked to the kitchen to get his basket. He frowned down at it. If he filled it would apples like he normally did, he was not sure he would be able to lift. Not in his current state. However, he really did not have much of a choice. He had found a note in the kitchen, which read that the Dursleys wanted apple Canelés with dinner. He needed fresh apples for that.
The other man flinched away from the touch. “Nothing,” he said, jumping up. He wavered, like it hurt, and then stood tall. He looked over his shoulder at Draco, forcing a smile. “This was nice, but I have to get back to my duties.”
“Indeed,” Haydrien replied in the same fashion, “I will alert our Lord of this development.” Idly, he spun one of his rings around his finger. This dark-metaled ring bore a skull and snake for a signet, identical to the ones his fathers wore.
“Harry, my love, I know it has not been even a full year yet, but you mean the world me. I love you with all my heart. Even before, when we did not know your heritage, I loved you. Dieu, did that mess with my head. I had all these plans, of rescuing you. Of making you a noble, or if you did not want that, I would have found a way for us to be together. And then, finding the truth, I fell even more in love as you reclaimed your birthright, your life. I want to be a part of your life, forever.” He paused, pulling out the ring. “Harold Valter Potter, will you agree to be my Consort?”
“Looks like you got some fans.” Draco joked. One of the Slytherins that he didn’t know came up to him and held out his hand
“Please call me Hadrian.” He said as they began to move across the lake and towards the looming castle. Theo kept a tight grip on Hadrian’s hand until they climbed out of the rickety boats.
Draco managed to get Harry sitting down on the blanket, and Lyra pulled the food out of the bag. The three ate in silence, relaxing in the shade of the trees. Once the food was gone, Lyra looked at Draco and nodded meaningfully at Harry. Draco sighed again.
The console beeped, alerting Draco that they were nearing Čarobnjačkom. “Looks like we’re almost there,” he said to Wolfe, “Ready to meet the family?” He glanced to the side as he adjusted their trajectory.
Everything made sense now. The reaction to Čarobnjačkom: of course, since Harry escaped there, he would not want to go back ever again. The similarity in their looks and mannerisms: obviously, because they were the same person. The knowledge of
Haydrien smiled, nodding at the Minister. He waved his hand, gesturing for the older man to lead the way.
“I know, Hermione, I know. I’m sorry,” Draco answered. He only ever used his friend’s first name in serious and emotional situations; this one was both of those. “But I couldn’t not go. This was for Sirius, the only member of my family I actually liked.” Draco looked up to meet the Felidaen’s eyes.
Draco mentally shook himself as he walked down the street, his mark a few yards in front of him. What was he doing? Flirting with the grad student? Promising him that they would see each other again? That was nonsense. Once this job was completed, he would be off on the next, wherever that would be. Another city, possibly another country. He floated from place to place, having no roots, except maybe with his mother, in France.
Draco turned back to face forward. The three of them were standing on the balcony overlooking the main courtyard of the palace. The ground below them was packed with the common people. In the center, a wooden platform rose above their heads. The executor stood upon it, waiting for the criminal. His ax gleamed in the sun where it was resting against the wooden block. The guards at the gate on the opposite side were waiting for a signal. Draco’s signal.
I know that Russia’s capital is Moscow, but I am not having that be where the ministry is based. I want the Russian ministry to be based in St. Petersburg (a coastal city partially because of the Durmstrang boats and partially because trade by ships was still a viable and safe way to transport magical goods). It’s sort of like how the MACUSA is in New York City instead of Washington, D.C. It makes sense that trade/travel centers are where the magical governments are hosted; London follows that pattern. Unlike the UK, Russia and USA are much larger in landmass and population. Because MACUSA is modelled after the muggle government, I like to believe that each state has its own smaller governments (like the state ones) which fall under the purveyance of the MACUSA. I think Russia would do something similar with provinces, since Russia is more than twice the size of the USA.
When no blaster fire was heard, Draco stuck his head out. He saw the Knight standing alone by Draco’s ship. The Knight nodded and waved them forward. Draco led the way, Severus just behind him.
This time, Theo answered. “They’re friends. Well, maybe at least colleagues. They worked together on used of dragon’s blood.”
Draco turned back to the man, arching a pale eyebrow. Should he lie? Come up with an alias? For some reason, he against it. He took Harry’s hand in a firm grasp. “Draco,” he answered, glancing back down at his textbook. Those eyes were intense; living emeralds that boar into your soul.
“I saw you that night. I know you used your bloody undead wolf to steal my godson. I should have been the one to raise Harry.” Sirius growled and Cas scoffed
, Harry thought as he ducked his head in embarrassment. He opened his book and started to read. Well, at least pretending to read. His mind was racing at lightning speeds. All because of the blond man seated across from him. A wink. Some mild flirting that was not even really flirting. That was it took to reduce him to a teenage girl with a crush. He chanced a glance up at the other man. Fingers trailing over the text, the blond’s attention was directed out the window.
“I will continue to fuel power into your undead dragon and keep our gold here as long as you make sure Albus Dumbledore has not touched a knut of my son’s inheritance.”
He stepped out from behind the tree, brushing off his clothing. “Who dares throw apples …” He trailed off, the other man’s words finally registering. “Hang on, ‘Dursley’?” he asked, incredulously, “These are not Dursley lands.”
Severus sighed. “Of course that is not satisfactory for you, you curious Knight,” the man said fondly, “Give me a second to gather my thoughts, and I’ll start at the beginning.”
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here!” Came a booming voice and Hadrian winced. The owner of said voice was a giant of a man.
Draco slunk forward on his long legs to stand before her. Instantly, he was immobilized, and Pansy’s face stretched into an evil smirk.
. That sealed Lily’s fate, and further testing sealed James’. James was executed immediately, and Lily was executed five months later after giving birth to a healthy baby boy. Sirius had tried to keep the baby, the last part of his best friend left, but he had been whisked away, already lost in the system.
** There is a description of a tongue being cut out, a person being branded, and an execution involving a beheading. I will denote the paragraphs with double asterisks so you can skip them if wanted **
Draco shook his head to clear those thoughts away. Now was not the time to fantasize about his Jedi Knight of a bodyguard. Prep the ship, get off this nightmare of a planet,
Holy hell, guys, my training is kicking my ass. I hope I'll manage to get a handle on everything once the school year starts, but for now, I don't have much time to write. I'll try my best, but updates will probably be sporadic.
“How Slytherin from a Ravenclaw. Then again, you always did belong in the house of snakes. I’m not sure how you managed to convince the sorting hat that you didn’t.” Came a familiar drawl from behind them. Hadrian immediately stiffened and his face became an emotionless mask. Cas chuckled
“My people,” he began in his normal voice, the sound carrying easily, “We are here to witness the execution of Vernon Dursley. For crimes against the aristocracy, you are sentenced to death by beheading. Comte Potter.” He raised his left hand forward. “Claim your justice.”
Harry did sigh this time as he fell into step behind the group. These next two days were going to be very erratic and stressful. He already felt exhausted.
Draco glared at them, causing all three to flinch back. That look promised pain and suffering. “No,” the blond spat, “You were told to take care of the property for their son, which you were also to take care of.”
Harry left his room and headed out of the kitchen to collect eggs from the coop. After, he would make breakfast for the three Dursleys. Then, off to the orchard. Then, take the rye and extra eggs to market. He sighed. Another long day, just like every other day.
“Then it’s a good thing we’re about to land,” Draco murmured. He continued to slowly maneuvered the ship behind the air control ships. “What exactly are his injuries?”
“Because most wizards are close minded. Don’t worry, I’m sure Toto will miss you as much as you will miss him.” Cas said leaving the bathroom, “Now go get ready. We’re going to London.”
It must have been bad. Because, the previous times, he had not been given something to hide the blood stains. Maybe since he was going to the market this afternoon, they wanted to hide ... but why? A master was allowed to whip a servant if they did something wrong. Why would it matter if anyone saw or not?
Severus sighed in exasperation, mumbling something that sounding suspiciously like ‘fixatedly idiotic brat’. The man cleared his throat and levered a very unimpressed look at Draco. “Were you actually listening during our talk earlier?” he asked, shaking his head. “Yes, it may be Harry, but not
Hadrian nodded, still running his fingers through Draco’s hair. “Yes, I heard from him,” he replied, “Father has the stone.” He had stared with his friends that Dumbledore let slip that whatever behind the Cerberus was some type of super powerful stone. “Apparently, the traps were ridiculously simple to defeat. Obviously, Dumbledore created the obstacles for a first year to complete, meaning it was a test for ‘The Boy-Who-Lived’. The stone is somewhere safe.”
---.---.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--
A book thudded loudly on the floor, followed by muffled cursing. Hadrian sighed. It seemed like their shadow was back. Ronald Weasley had been following them around since his meeting with Dumbledore. It was like the boy was trying to catch Hadrian in the act. Probably hoping it would be something bad, something to get Hadrian in serious trouble as payback. However, the boy was not stealthy at all. The group always heard or saw him. Toying with the pathetic boy was becoming a game to them.
Draco nodded, thinking over everything his former tutor said. One thing stuck out to him. Just as the man was stepping out of the cockpit, he called out, “Hey Severus?”
She spun in a circle, looking around the waiting room. Ronald was leaning against the ugly yellow wall, arms crossed over his heavily muscled chest. Still healing scratches were visible across the man’s exposed arms and shoulders. Remnants of their earlier spar. She knew she should feel sorry, but she did not. It was the man’s job to keep her safe and sane. That sometimes included let her claw him when she needed to her frustrations. Or anger. This time, it was both. Better him than Draco. Or the Jedi Council. Or Harlan, when he was better.
Harry blushed bright red. Draco chuckled softly as he straightened back up. With a wink and a smirk, the blond left the coffee shop. Harry collapsed into his chair with a sigh. That was intense. And a little bud inside his chest took root, encouraged by the man’s parting words. Hopefully, their paths would cross again.
he said, then switching to English, “Now, let us greet our guests from France: the students of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.” He motioned to the back of the room, and the door opened.
Resting on the wood, a blood red stone sat. it eerily glowed, as if lit from within. Like it was the flame of life, given solid form. From what he had learned, that was essentially what the Philosopher’s Stone was. It had been very auspicious, that while he was younger and had traveled around the world, an old book at a market stall in Istanbul had interested him. It had just set on a bookshelf, untranslated except for the first few pages; alchemy had never held much appeal for Cas. Until now, the book had just been gathering dust.
“If I get put in Gryffindor I’ll AK myself.” He said back and Draco laughed. The train came to a slow halt and the two boys cautiously entered the hallway and joined the hundreds of other trying to get off the train.
“Of course. I’m not stupid. They would probably never find the body, would they.” Lucius said solemnly. Cas chuckled
I wish to share a poem with you, though not one of my own creation. I found it in an anthology at a book store next to my hotel. It's by the muggle poet Sheelgan Lennon (do not roll your eyes – yes, I know you are rolling your eyes).
A tense silence settled as the food was served. Draco glanced to the side at Lyra, seeing her try not to squirm in her chair. Thankfully, it was not a fancy meal, just the minimum courses. Hopefully, they could get through this meal quickly. Without conversation. But it was not to be.
The man nodded, sending his messy black hair bouncing around. “Yep, I am as well,” he said, “But nothing as intense as you. Masters of Education in Child Psychology. And I’m getting my teaching credentials.” He smiled sheepishly. “I want to teach primary school. Or be a counselor.”
After the second course was brought out, his father cleared his throat and looked determinedly at Draco. Great. “Son, about what we discussed,” he began, but Draco cut him off, not wanting to continue that rehash that conversation. He needed to distract and redirect.
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. “Only you,” he said, then sobered up. He took one of Harry’s hands in his, kneeling before the man. He began speaking.
All the courtiers were looking between the enraged Baroness and the cool Comte leaning against Draco’s throne. Harry gave off the image of calm and collected, draped against the back of the throne with his arms crossed loosely over his chest, but Draco knew better. He could see the tension in every muscle. Subtly, he moved his hand to brush the other man’s thigh, to offer support. And Harry leaned into the touch, which caused Draco to have to fight back a smile. Now was not the time for that.
“And we want to be your friend.” Fred added as an afterthought. Hadrian stared at them with a look that seemed to pierce their soul. They squirmed after a minute and both broke eye contact. Hadrian grinned and looked out the window.
"You do have one of the Dark Lord's Horcruxes, it's a book or a diary. He would have told you to protect it at all cost. The pages are probably blank though. And what I need it for is to revive our Lord. Though it still would take a while. Dumbledore is keeping a close eye on some of the other ingredients that I will need. And then there's the living human sacrifice. That will be tricky but I'm sure I'll manage. It doesn't have to be a wizard-" Lucius cut Cas off
Harry mentally shook himself and started on his reading. While not the most interesting of topics, he did find it fascinating. How the mind worked, particularly as it was developing and changing through childhood and adolescence. Time flew past without his notice.
Draco groaned in frustration. “Oh, for the love of –“ he cut off, bending to grab his bag. He riffled around until he found the small coin purse he kept in there. Without bothering to count, he just tossed the bag to the other man. It contained way more than the price of the apples he took, but it would hopefully shut the other man up. “There, now I’m not a thief,” he said, walking over to his horse.
Dinner finished with no other conversation. Draco and Lyra stood as their father escorted their mother from the room.
Lyra met his across the blanket, and he could see his anger reflected in hers. They needed to plan. But later. Now, they would sit and enjoy with their picnic.
Draco moved to stand before Petunia. “Since you are fond are cut words and harsh work, your tongue shall be cut out and you shall become a servant.” The blond looked around the gather courtiers. “Is anyone in need of a maid?”
Harry raised his eyebrows as he read the email the college sent out. Apparently, Dr Piers had been found dead in his apartment a couple days ago. The police were investigating and want anyone with information to call the list hotline. Along with the body, there had been evidence of exploitation between the man and students. The college made an official statement about it, vilifying his actions. They also stated any student affected by the man’s actions should got to the police station to file a report.
The Quidditch World Cup. He was there, though not as he had expected to be. He was disappointed but also proud of his best friend. Viktor had beaten him fair and square.
“Hey! That’s my godson!” Came a shout. Cas looked up to see both Hagrid and Sirius staring at him. Sirius took a step forwards and Cas mirrored the action with a step back.
There tears streaming down from Harry’s emerald eyes, but the man’s face nearly broke with his blinding grin. He moved so the ring slid onto his finger. “Yes.”
"Dear Mr. Mort. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begin on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall. Can I really go? It's not a trick?" Hadrian asked looking up at his father and Cas chuckled
“Yup, that’s Toto.” Hadrian said going over to the puppy who was yipping happily at its master’s attention.
He and Harry turn to look. Lyra was standing up by the blanket. She raised an eyebrow at Draco. He sighed.
“Don't worry about it. We're all scared of something. We just can't let those fears consume us.” Hadrian said.
Remus hurried through the corridors. He had just landed on Felidae. Finally. It had taken ages to get to the planet from Coruscant. It was times like these that he almost wished he owned a ship. It would have been so much faster than the public transport he took. He swore, the thing seemed to stop at every planet between the two planets. But then again, he hated piloting ships. He rarely went anywhere not on Council business anyways; he would just use a ship from the Jedi Temple on assignments.
It couldn’t be, could it? The senator couldn’t be Draconis Malfoy, one of Čarobnjačkom’s princes. He couldn’t be Harry’s childhood friend, Draco. The boy who gave him a name and never treated him as a slave. As a lesser being, like the Dursleys. Could it really be true that his friend grew from a prince of a slave-based civilization to the senator leading the galactic anti-slavery movement? As shocking as that revelation, Harry realized it had to be true. The senator was an older mirror of Draco: white blond hair, silver eyes, pale skin, and angular features.
Draco gave him a faint smile. Harry counted that a victory. The blond had been, on and off, glaring out the window like he wanted to murder it. “We’ll see,” he said, leaning closer to whisper in Harry’s ear, “Can’t keep Hot Teacher waiting, now can I?”
“Oops,” Hermione said, blushing. It had not occurred to her to think of the time on Coruscant when she called. She filed away the rest of what Remus had said for later. Someone else had interrupted his sleep? Who? She was so curious, but now was not the time. “I’m sorry, but this couldn’t wait until morning.”
I fully believed all of that, until the trials came around. My trial was the last of my family's; my father tried to life in prison and my mother on house arrest for life. I never expected anyone to stand up for me; I was the hated child of Death Eater scum that in turn became Death Eater scum himself. Facing the Wizengamot, I was shaking behind my Malfoy mask. Then, the doors opened and in walked Harry. He requested to speak, and was granted that right. He told of everything I did: how I was horrified by Professor Babbling, how I only half-heartily attempted to fulfill my obligation to the Dark Lord, how he saw me lower my wand in surrender when facing Dumbledore, how I did not turn him over to my parent and in turn the Dark Lord, how I never wanted to be a Death Eater, how he saw me crack under the pressure to protect my family at the young age of sixteen. He pleaded that I be pardoned, and surprising enough, I was.
McLaggen cleared his throat. He seemed uncomfortable and a bit peeved, but Hermione could understand that, considering Dr. Snape had basically treated him like an child seeking approval. He cleared his throat before talking. “Right. At the moment, we have Knight Wolfe in an induced coma. We are hoping to get the burn mostly healed before he wakes up, and with the head injury healed, he could have woken up at any moment. This way, his body will have more time to heal before its attention is divided amongst conscious functions. We plan to change the bandages on the burn every couple of hours, with fresh paste.”
“You knew the Dark Lord was going to die that night, didn’t you?” Lucius said, his voice cold and Cas shook his head desperately
The pair made their way down to the stables, where their horses were saddled quickly by the stablehands. They rode down the path that hugged the castle wall, towards the town.
I awake to pounding on the door. I must have fallen asleep. I look down to see Tia curled up on me, still sleeping. Around 10:15, she came into the sitting room, wanting to be held. So I emptied my lap and settled her in it. We both must have dozed off. I see the time is now 11:38. I look about hopefully, but there is no owl, no letter.
Lyra nodded, picking up a book from the table and getting comfortable on the chaise. “You go do that,” she replied, “I know you won’t let it go until you figure it. Have fun.” She waved him off, already lost in the pages.
“Shut it,” he said, tugging on one of her curls, “As I was saying. How would you like to go on a picnic tomorrow? Just you and me? We could go for a ride. Explore the countryside. Settle in for our meal amongst the trees.”
Draco found the man where he expected: on the bench under the Weeping Willow. Sirius had planted the tree for Severus when they got together; the tree was nearing on thirty years old. Draco glanced at the Knight before parting the canopy to join Severus. Wolfe turned his back to them and the tree, giving them the illusion of privacy and keeping watch. Draco hesitantly approached the older man and sat down.
The only other person in the waiting room was a man. An unknown. Well, obviously, Draco knew the man, since he had come off the blond’s ship behind the medical team. He had walked with them to the hospital and up to the waiting room. He then sat in that chair, and had not moved. At all. The man just sat there, silently, holding a Jedi cloak and lightsaber. She assumed those were Harlan’s. Who was the man? And why was he there?
The throne room was full. All the courtiers currently at the palace were in attendance, mingling and gossiping amongst themselves. A riot of colorful fabrics, like a flock of exotic birds. And in the midst, a raven and a dove.
The woman nodded. “That’s good,” she said, looking slightly less upset, “But what happened then? You should have been completely fine.”
With barely a nod, the servant turned and headed up the stairs. Like it was expected of them to follow, without a word being said. Petunia bit her tongue at the slight. Her husband did not seem to be able to do the same.
“Albus Dumbledore. Headmaster’s office, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” She said throwing the floo powder into the fireplace and sticking her head in.
In the front of the room sat four thrones, the middle two larger than the others. Those two were filled by King Lucius and Queen Narcissa. Draco’s mother looked elegant and regal in a
“How is Lord Black doing these days? I haven’t been in such a populated area in a long time.” Cas said changing the subject
So this chapter is shorter than the last. I didn't realize how long chapter two was or else i would have cut it in half. No point in doing that now. Just so you all know I average between 1700 and 2000 words in a chapter. Sometimes they will be long but never really that long. Sorry if that disappoints you. Anyways I'm introducing a semi new character in this chapter. He's going to be very important.
That morning, Harry was dragged out of his room. His room, which had been his safe haven. His door at banged open, jarring him from sleep. Baron Dursley had then grabbed him by the throat and pulled him outside. Once tied to a post, the baron produced the whip and started given Harry lashes. But this time, it was worse than ever. It was like the leather had been dipped in something, maybe salt or lemon juice. Harry had backed out after fifteen.
Draco clapped Severus on the shoulder as he passed the man. “Set the coordinates for Coruscant into the hyperdrive, would you?” he called as he made his way to the cockpit.
“Unfortunately, you gave his key to Albus Dumbledore.” The name was spat out as if it left a bad taste on his father’s tongue, “Why, I’m not sure since he was not the owner of the vault nor was he the guardian at the time.”
Cas snorted at the books. Hadrian was well beyond most of them and would more than likely find the classes to be easy. Hadrian had always shown remarkable skill in Transfiguration and Potions, the two hardest classes. The Trimble book would probably insult Hadrian as well which wouldn’t go over well.
Kingsley clears his throat. "There is something else. We found this on the desk in Harry's hotel room". In his hand is a letter addressed to me. I opened it and read it and cry at the last words Harry ever wrote to me.
, so Draco was alone in the cockpit. He accepted the call, and a projection of his friend appeared. She did not look happy. Her ears were flat against her head towards the back, and what he could see of her tail was fluffed up and twitching quickly side to side.
Hermione hated that her friend was essentially being forced into slumber, but she understood their reasons. “When can we see him?” She asked. Hearing all the injuries and treatments, she just wants to see Harlan. Be close to him. Possibly, hold his hand.
I changed my mind about translating things into Russian for this chapter because of the flashback scene I added in. It fit more with how I wanted that scene to go, and the links offer an audio reading of the translations if wanted. In the next chapters, it will go back into italics.
. He shook his head at the ludicrousness of the whole experience. The royal siblings, heirs to the throne of France, had spent several hours relaxing in an orchard with him. The concern that burned in Draco’s eyes … it had felt … so wonderful.
“It would be nice to have more friends than just Dray.” He said softly and could practically feel the grins the twins sent his way.
“And here is the best place to do that?” Draco asked incredulously. She just glared, twirling her finger at him.
Actually, like this, Jedi Wolfe deeply reminded him of Harry, his childhood friend. Harry was his slave, but Draco never thought of the boy as that. He was his companion. Draco had not seen Harry since they were six, and the boy was sold away.
Draco saw red, his hands clenching. Those people … Draco would make sure they were punished for what they did to Harry. That they suffered. He was distracted from his murderous plans by Neville returning with Severus Snape, the court physician, and the older man’s assistant.
Was Draco … flirting with him? Harry could hardly believe it, but all signs pointed that way. He fought hard not to blush. He knew he failed when he saw the blond smirk in his direction. The ship touched down, leaving no time for Harry to respond.
“Only bad wizards come from Slytherin. And Malfoy here is probably just using you in order for his father to hand you over to You-Know-Who. He’s not really your friend. I can be a real friend. You don’t need him.” He snapped glaring at Draco.
was a jerk and an idiot, but that should not warrant a harsh punishment. Not like the Baron and Baroness. He nodded to Draco, waving his hand down to communicate to lessen Dudley’s sentence. The blond nodded, understanding.
As delightful as those hours had been, he knew it could not happen again. Would not happen. Dieu, it should not have happened in the first place. He was just a lowly servant. No, he was essentially a slave to the Dursleys. And Draco. Draco was the Dauphin. Destined to be King of France.
Dobbeson stepped slowly, as if afraid this was all a dream. Harry frowned in concentration as he tried to place the old man. “Little Master Harry,” Dobbeson whispered, his voice choked with emotion, “You’ve returned.”
“Settle down. Now today we will be turning a matchstick into a needle. Now the incantation is easy, it is ‘Destri’. Begin.” She said sharply. Hadrian nudged Draco whom he was sitting beside and quickly scribbled down Intent is important here too. On a scrap of parchment. Draco nodded that he got the message and they began to try. Hadrian got his to transform on the first try, he had done things like this before with his father.
The Healer nodded. “Then let us go to my office,” he said, turning to the hallway. The black haired man stood up and walked behind the Healer down the hall. Hermione followed the pair, Ronald her ever present shadow.
Draco watched the carriages land in front of the school, the black leads snorting and tromping the ground. He found it ironic that the school that snubbed all things dark would have what most consider dark creatures pulling their carriages. Then again, most of Hogwarts students were sheltered and have never witnessed death, unlike most of them at Durmstrang.
, with pearls and other jewels sparkling among the strands. She was beautiful and obviously happy. A glance to Prince Oliver showed he to look completely besotted as his bride made her way down to the aisle towards him.
... hey guys ... sorry about the long wait in between updated ... I have been suffering from both writer's block and writer's scatterbrain (besides just being overworked and extremely tired) ...
"Draco, I'm afraid I have some bad news," he says. "There was an incident late last night. Harry was working on tracking Avery, as you know. Avery led Harry into a trap. We could observe that Rookwood, the Carrow siblings, Greyback, and Yaxley were in the room where Avery led Harry. From what we could gather, it appears that Harry cast a very powerful Confringo curse. However, it seems that he changed the nature of it; he poured all his magical strength into the curse so it exploded out from him, killing everyone present. Everything in the room was incinerated, but we could identify the people who were there by their magical signatures. Also, this was left in the center of the burn pattern." Kingsley pulls a long skinny box out of his robes and holds it out to me. "We are very sorry for your loss, Draco; Harry will be greatly missed by all. However, take heart that he died sacrificing himself to rid the world of the last loose Death Eaters."
"Fetch, Bartholomew." Cas said and the wolf slunk over to where a small bundle sat in the tag-along seat of a motorcycle, with an innocent baby sleeping soundly inside his warm cocoon. Bartholomew gently grabbed onto the boy's blanket and carefully lifted him before taking the boy over to where it's master stood and setting the baby down. Cas bent down and scooped the sleeping boy up off the cold, hard ground.
Finally, after some very comfortable moments, the older blond submitted to the ritual. Lord Malfoy bowed his head and crossed his left arm in front of his chest, hand fisted. “
Lyra chuckled as Harry paled, stammering in shock and panic. She stepped forward and patted his cheek. She decided to put him out of his misery. “Don’t worry, Harry dear,” she said, “He was talking to me.”
Back to the present, Vernon was now up on the platform, on his knees before the block. It was time. Draco raised a hand, and the drums stopped. Silence reigned on the gather people in the courtyard.
“I don’t care,” Senator Draconis Malfoy, the Dragon of the Senate, snapped as he stormed towards the Chancellor’s office, “I am going back to
Draco shifted uncomfortably, glancing back out the front window. He hated being scolded, and Severus always had a way of making him feel especially stupid and ashamed. “Right,” he said, greatly wanting to change the subject, “Are there any other injuries?”
The world spun as Harry finished mucking out the stable. He was so lightheaded. And weak. He could barely lift the pitchfork. And bending over caused his back to stretch and burn, wetness dripping down his skin. Thankfully, he only had a couple more chores before he could go to sleep.
He nodded. He had been thinking the same thing. He cleared this throat. “Let’s continue looking,” he said softly. The air was heavy, with what he could not pinpoint, and he did not want to disturb it. “Hopefully we’ll find something.”
The ride was short, and soon they were arriving at the palace. Petunia frowned. They were not announced, no fanfare to greet them. And there was no one in the courtyard to greet them. Well, no one of importance. A royal servant waited to lead them to the throne room. They were of the nobility. They deserved more than a measly servant as their reception.
=) I told you there would be another one coming soon. I had not thought it would be quite this soon, but inspiration (and insomnia) hit me
After a few minutes, Cas managed to push Lucius back enough to look at the man. He smirked. “I’ve had a breakthrough,” he said.
“Hadrian.” Draco’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts. He turned to see Draco along with Theo and a few other Slytherins.
“Well, back to Knight Wolfe’s treatment,” McLaggen stated. He opened a life on his desk, shifting softly through the papers. “The bones were easy to fix. We put a brace on the write, because joint breaks are still fragile for a couple weeks after being healed.”
“Ancient Arabic,” Hadrian answered. He could see the eager glint in Theo’s eyes. He just knew the boy would ask to borrow the book once Father was done. Hadrian did not see the harm. Of course, he would run it passed Father first. Maybe it would spark an interest of Alchemy in Theo. An alchemist would be very useful to have around.
Draco sighed. “Yes,” he answered, tipping his head back to look at Hadrian, “Have you heard from your father?”
“You’re awake,” the blond murmured, leaning forward. He gently ran his hand over the back of Harry’s. “That was terrifying. It was iffy there for a bit; some of the cuts were gaping and almost infected. But you’re going to be fine.”
The ship dropped out of hyperspace. Čarobnjačkom loomed before them. It looked just as it did when he left fifteen years ago. He remembered watching the planet disappear behind them as the Jedis flew them away. While the planet hadn’t changed, he sure had. Harry was no longer that helpless little boy. He was a skilled Jedi Knight. He was not helpless. Not anymore.
; she still hated wearing dressed, especially ones for formal occasions. Luna, for once, was dressed, normally, in a
“I need to use your floo. I must call Albus Dumbledore.” She practically shouted at Tom, the barkeeper. He nodded dumbly and she pushed past him and towards the fireplace.
“When he collapsed,” Severus answered, “There was a spear of blood on the corner of the control panel. I think that is where he cracked his skull. The rest of the injuries are consistent with how I found him lying on the floor.”
“Father! Father! It came! By a living owl too!” Cas woke to his Hadrian bursting into the small bedroom that he was sleeping in. Smiling as he sat up he looked at the huge grin on his precious son’s face. His little necromancer in training.
He slumped into the pilot’s seat, his mind conflicted. He wanted to go back to Čarobnjačkom to pay his respects to Sirius. The man was like a father to him. No, that was the wrong analogy. Sirius was like an older brother, playing with him after Harry was gone and then taking Draco under his wing when he was older. Sirius was the only family member Draco actually liked, and now he was dead.
, valued for its ability to rejuvenate the skin. Speeds healing and helps prevent scarring.” He began to rub at his chin, the faint shadow of scruff across his skin. “Marigold,
She had not been the same since Father died. She had taken to stare at things for long periods of time, being oblivious to everything around her. Losing Lucius was taking its toll on her. Though they loved each other, they were not in love; it was more like the love between siblings than between lovers. Their families were very close so they basically grew up together. Their marriage was an arranged one, like most pureblood marriages. It was a good thing they never made an arrangement for Draco yet. That would have definitely lead to awkward complications due to his orientation.
Remus lifted an eyebrow at the other man. That was very much over simplified. He wanted a more in-depth answer, because the man’s reason just lead to more questions.
Draco cleared his throat to regain the Dursleys’ attention. Their eyes snapped away from Harry to focus on Draco. He arched an eyebrow at them, hoping to silently spur them into changing their answer. When the look did nothing, he spoke, “Well?”
He could feel a bandage on his forehead, as well as a brace on his wrist. He did not remember injuring those. Just the blinding burn of a blaster on his side. Speaking of that, he could feel more bandages wrapped around his torso. Each breath ached a bit, and there was an odd tingling feeling where the burn was.
, Harlan. Just Harlan, no last name. It took several months before he opened up to me, so shy. Quiet. Scared.”
The pair tentatively went through the house. Furniture was draped with linen, to protect from sun and age. Each room was more of the same: elegant cravings, covered furniture, and heavy air.
They dissolved into fits of laughter. The rest of the trip was spent like that. With laughter, with smiles, and hopes for the coming year. Little did they know of what fate had in store for them.
After a moment, Lyra’s eyes widened and her mouth formed an “o”. Finally, she understood his meaning. “Yes,” she said, “Just let me change into something suitable for riding.” She made to close the door.
The ritual also requires two necromancers; Hadrian will have to participate. Cas grimaced at that. He would rather his son not be involved, but there was no other option. The ritual would take place on Midsummer’s Night, which was just a couple weeks after his son would return from Hogwarts.
“In my possession? I don’t have a Horcrux of the Dark Lord. And what would you need it for?” Lucius asked startled
“You two should probably go. We wouldn’t want Dumbledore to get suspicious.” Draco said and Hadrian heard the twins slip out the compartment. There was a long time where Hadrian stared out the window at the passing countryside. Once again, their peace was interrupted when the compartment door flew open.
The angry man turned back to the thrones, but was stopped from continuing his tirade by the king. King Lucius simply raised his left hand, and it was like the Baron’s voice was stolen right out of his throat. With a vaguely bored expression, the King waved his hand, indicating that Draco should continue.
Draco’s eyes were rimmed in black liner. His one victory over Pansy was that he was not wearing another other makeup: no eyeshadow, lipstick, blush, or any form of glitter. He drew the line there. His hair was down, flowing down to his shoulder blades. It was tussled every which way, which felt very unnatural to Draco. He never wore it down; his hair was either in a braid or bun at the back of his neck. The finishing touches to his ensemble were his Malfoy crest ring, his
“How droll.” He said before opening his book and beginning to read. Draco followed the suit and they settled in silent companionship.
Time seems to past slowly. Its 9:45 … 9:50 … 9:55 … With each passing minute, my heart painfully contracts and I start to panic.
Another memory pops up, though not as happy as the previous, this one from when I was eight years old …
This is what happens when you get stranded with a broken car, no internet access, and a dying phone: you write on your stories =)
The air control ships ducked below the canopy, Draco following close behind. Vines tries to tangle and ensnare the ships. Only the spires of the few tallest buildings were seen from the air, but once under the treetops, the city spread out in all its glory. Seemingly endless miles of buildings blended perfectly with the natural beauty of the rainforest. The other cities were similar, flowing seamlessly with their environments. While Čarobnjačkom’s architecture was generally aesthetically pleasing, Draco loved this style much better. He thought it to be magnificent, completely embodying primal elegance.
When the Knight entered, Draco pointed to the copilot’s chair. “You can sit there,” he said, “You don’t have to do anything. I’ve already put in the destination; we’re going to the Royal Palace in the capital.” Draco frowned, something just occurred to him. “I don’t know your name.”
Harry hummed softly to himself, carrying a basket at his side, as he walked to the orchard. His stomach growled, unhappy at being empty. He had not prepared himself something when he fixed the Dursleys’ meals, not that he would have been allowed anything in the kitchen. He would eat an apple or two off the trees. Those would not be missed, since the orchard was barely tended.
Theo smiled faintly, taking one of each of their hands. He kissed their knuckles and let their hands rest on his lap. Draco rolled his eyes at their couples’ behavior. “But that does not explain how Dumbledore got a hold of the Philosopher’s stone. The only alchemist who is known to have successfully made one is Nicholas Flammel. The man is extremely secretive. No one knows how he did it or where he keeps the stone. How did Dumbledore get it?”
Lyra flinched at the tone. Draco stepped in front of her, to shield her at least somewhat from the man’s ire. “I am Prince Draco and this is Princess Lyra. We were looking for information about the Potters.”
no matter what anyone says. With or without permission, I am leaving Coruscant.” Attendents, both his and the Chancellor’s, swarmed around him and tried to keep up with his long strides.
Draco was pulled from his panic by the sound of a lightsaber engaging. He looked over to see Harlan next to him, wielding his indigo lightsaber. The Knight must have come back to them while Draco was frozen with panic.
This was his punishment for ignoring the planning of her wonderful party for him. Pansy was going to dress him. Great. Draco was sure he would end up looking like a man-whore.
Blaise nodded. “Okay, so we know the Headmaster set up that corridor as a test for the Boy-Who-Lived, and that he used the Philosopher’s Stone as bait. Who was he trying to attract to the school?”
Absently, Draco patted his pocket, feeling the outline of the ring he was hiding there. He had it commissioned, though with the royal blacksmith instead of the jeweler. His Harry, though he wore the elegancy of nobility well, enjoyed the simpler pleasures. So,
Harry sighed again, fiddling with his lordship ring. It was a habit he developed after Dobby had pulled it out of the safe in the master suite: spinning the silver band with the Potter crest pressed into the metal around and around his middle finger. Harry glanced back around and again took in the beauty of the gardens. He thought that, just maybe, he could get used to this.
Draco couldn’t believe his thoughts. In no way should he be thinking a Jedi Knight, a highly trained warrior, as cute, but he is. When the other man had pulled the robe around himself and snuggled down into the chair, Draco had to bite down a coo. A man who has the ability to wield the Force with deadly accuracy looked more like a young child waiting for a bedtime story. Especially with those wide, earnest green eyes.
Draco sighed sadly, nodding. “Alright,” he answered. He tucked the papers behind his back. It was not important right then. Harry, and what happened, and what Draco was going to do about it that was. He watched the other man leave.
Draco cleared his throat and looked to the man that appeared to be the highest ranking of the bureaucrats. He would kill that man first, he decided, when he began his murderous rampage. “Senator Draconis Malfoy, Crown Prince of Čarobnjačkom,” he stated clearly, schooling away his grimace at the second title, “Requesting emergency medical assistance for Jedi Knight Harlan Wolfe.” He then watched the play of emotions on the faces of the gathered Felidaens.
As he walked through campus, slipping his coffee, he thought back to Draco. He had not seen the blond since that day in the coffee shop, but he was still optimistic. He had gone a long time without crossing paths with the man before. Four days was nothing compared to that.
“So,” Draco said as they approached the palace landing pad, “There are customs that I’m not sure you’ll know.” The man frowned for a second. “Not that I’m implying you’re stupid or ignorant, Harlan, but Čarobnjačkom customs, well Krv Čista customs to be exact, are inane, obscure, and complicated. I think it would be best if you just act like my shadow and don’t speak.”
“Hello Lucius.” He turned and saw the boy standing beside his once lover, “This must be Draco. It’s a pleasure to meet you, this is my son Hadrian.” Cas said smiling. The boy still looked nervously at him but when he looked at Hadrian the look changed to curiosity
Severus nodded, shifting in his seat. “Yes, Healer McLaggen said you were Wolfe’s next of kin,” he answered, “So I knew you would be here soon.” A faint smile ghosted over harsh features. “Still don’t like piloting?”
She sighed, understanding. “Just … tell me you weren’t stupid about it. That you didn’t sneak off Coruscant without anyone knowing.”
Inside, nestled in a bed of red velvet, is my husband's wand. The eleven inch holly wood and phoenix feather wand is mockingly unharmed, just like when Harry first bought it twelve years ago. It is in the wrong place, though; it belongs in Harry's hand. That is when it hits me: Harry is never coming back to us, to me.
, he was attractive: pale olive skin, raven black hair held back from his face that curled slightly at the ends, emerald eyes that sparkled in the city lights. “I know you are a galactic senator,” the Knight said softly, “I was told I would be escorting you to your home planet.”
Draco’s anger boiled again. It was infuriating, how little the other man thought of himself. He had been so conditioned, by the Dursleys, that he accepted his horrible treatment like it was commonplace practice. The information he gained about the Dursleys came second to the insight to the man sitting there in front of him.
Silence reigned as the pair stared down at the young man lying between them. He looked so peaceful, his chest moving faintly with each breath. After a while, Severus opened his book again and continued reading where he left off. Remus tucked an errant piece of raven hair back behind Harlan’s ear before settling into his chair, to wait.
Haydrien and Draco were rehashing the plays as they headed to their campsite. After that initial discussion of Durmstrang, Draco joined into the conversation with the Bulgarian Minister. Fudge, left alone with the people speaking only Russian, wandered away to converse with someone else, in English. The redheads had given them a wide berth, but the twins kept sending them curious looks. When no one had been paying attention, they had nodded in Draco’s direction, and the blond nodded in return. Slytherin solidarity at its best, even amidst a blood feud.
On either side of the altar were the family of the bride and groom, both sets of ruling couples standing across from each other. Draco felt a pang of sorrow. This is how his and Harry’s union should have been like, with Harry’s family standing there up with them. But, that was long in the past, and Harry was flourishing at court even more as time wore on.
Cas stood watching the Potter house burn. A zombified wolf stood at his side. Nearby Sirius and Hagrid stood yelling at each other.
She made a face, pulling something out of the bag. “Changing,” she answered, “I hate riding in skirts, but Mother visited me in my chambers while I was getting ready. Hence, the dress.”
Harry sighed but nodded. “That sounds like a good plan,” he replied, “I will go along with whatever you say. You can figure out how to explain my presence.”
Harry sighed, turning to his worn trunk. “Time to start the day,” he murmured to himself. He then started getting dressed. His clothing had, at one point, been of decent quality, as was fitting of a servant to a barony. But not any longer. They were threadbare and mended repeatedly, barely holding together. They were ill-fitting, made for a larger man; they used to belong to William, who was taller and broad than Harry. But, there was no money to get a servant new clothing. Or so the Dursleys said. He was not sure he believed that.
Finally, he reached his throne and sunk into it with a bored air about him. He blankly stared at the Baron and Baroness, gleeful as they squirmed under his scrutiny. Then, he smirked evilly at them, which seemed to upset them all the more. This would be fun.
The pair rose together, arm in arm. They turned to face the cathedral and all the people gathered. There were cheers, and tears, and tossed flowers. Harry turned his head to look up at Draco, a soft smile on his face. The blond looked down to meet his gaze, a soft smile on his lips. This was Harry’s life now, and he could not be happier.
Students in baby blue, fluttery robes. They split into two lines, walking down the sides of the room. Then, the students drew their wands and conjured multicolored ribbons of light. Those strands danced over the heads of the Durmstrang students. Draco just watched impassively. It was a moderately impressive display, but very flashly and pointless. Utterly useless. He looked to Alexei and saw the same thoughts reflected back at him. They looked back up at the ribbons and watched them slowly wink out. The pair dutifully clapped, like the rest of their school mates.
He was alone in the antechamber of the cathedral. Everyone was inside. Lyra. Luna. The King and Queen. Neville. Blaise. The other nobles. Visiting nobles. Other royals. So many people. But most importantly, Draco was there. Waiting for him at the altar. Because today was the day he became Lord Consort to the Dauphin.
This time, his friends vocalized their shock. There were shouts, and much cursing, both elated and horrified. Draco jerked upright, turning his head to stare at Hadrian in shock. “Really?” he exclaimed, “Is Dumbles completely insane? That’s an extremely dangerous, highly sought after magical artifact. How did he get approval to house it in the school? With all the people that could go after it, it would put the students in danger.”
The Knight nodded. “Alright, lead on,” he conceded, “I’ll guard our backs.” He turned to look at Draco. “Senator, stay between us so we can protect you better.”
Hermione gasped, grabbing her necklace in distress. Poor Harlan. That sounded so awful. She knew that, as a Jedi, there was always a chance Harlan would get injured, but she had never faced the reality of that before.
Draco shook his head at the empty room. Dieu, Lyra would be the death of him. She always managed to see through his fanciful words to the truth. And what she had said about the food, that was brilliant. He had thought to himself that Harry had looked a bit thin, and bringing addition food, enough for the other man, was no hardship. With a slight smile on his face, Draco went back to his chambers. He could not wait for tomorrow.
Harry scrunched up his nose. He guessed that could explain what she and the Baron did once the Comte and Comtesse died. They were supposed to take care of Harry and the estate. Instead, they claimed the land as theirs and treated Harry as a servant. No, more like a slave. Being around the castle, Harry realized just how badly he was treated compared to the servants here.
Draco nodded. “That makes sense,” he said, “Very few outsiders are trusted with Temple knowledge. My friend, Hermione, is the only person I know that had been allowed unlimited access to the Jedi Archives.” Draco cleared his throat. “But that is beside the point.” He motioned at the older man. “Continue.”
Harry made it to the Chamber in a few minutes due to his eagerness. He bounced on the balls of his feet as he waited to be called in. Try as he might not to be, he was nervous. This would be his first major mission, more than likely on his own. Right after he passed the Trials, Harry was immediately assigned to the Temple Guard. With what Remus just told him, it made sens that the Council would want him in that as soon as possible. And it also made sense why the head of the Guard said he could come back any time. He spent three years in the Guard. Then, Master Flitwick asked him to accompany him on a recruiting mission. They went to six different systems and found twenty children with the potential to become Jedi Knights.
Harry blushed bright red. “Thank you,” he murmured as he hugged the man again. He pulled back after a few moments, a cheeky grin on his no longer blushing face. “Well, best not to keep the Council waiting.”
“I am an eleven-year-old boy. The only duty I have is to attend my classes and make good scores. I have no duty to defeat any Dark Lord. That is up to adults like you.” Hadrian said before standing
Silence reigned, and no more apples came his way. Cautiously, Draco poked his head around the tree to see. A man stood between the trees, a basket resting on the ground near his feet. He struck an impressive figure against the foliage: proud and strong. The pose was at odds with his attire, which even from a distance, Draco could tell was haggard. Who was this man?
The letters were signs of his love. Harry never wanted to leave, but his sense of duty to the Wizarding World forced him to. Whenever he was away, I received a letter in the early morning. How he managed to have them arrive at the same time every time was a mystery to me. However, I did not really care because I loved those letters. I had a small wooden chest that I kept them in. His job took him away so frequently that the chest was almost full. I would have probably needed to get a bigger one soon; not many more letters would have fit.
Draco was wary of love. All it did was hurt, leaving large, gaping holes in his heart. He loved his brother in all but blood, and he never really got over the pain of losing him. He loved his father, and the man’s death haunted him even if his spirit does not. He had felt like he was slowly and steadily falling for Lucas, but the man had been violently ripped from him before he could know for sure.
Granger made a noise of sympathy and concern. “That’s horrible,” she said, “But everything will be fine. Felidae has highly advanced medical practices.”
Remus nodded. “The Blood Elves turned on the Night, Forest, and High elves. It was gruesome. Eventually, the other three managed to defeat the Blood Elves.”
I know Draco and Haydrien seem a bit OOC in that bit in the bedroom, but I did that on purpose. The pair are the pureblood heirs of old familys, basically the wizarding nobility. There are expectations on how they should act around people. Alone, together, is when all masks are dropped. These two have grown up together. They know each other intricately and intimately. There is no need to stand on propriety just because of their status as heirs and betrothed. Draco can be promiscuous and a bit forward if he wants, and Haydrien understands. Haydrien can be needy for physical touch and comfort, and Draco understands. They know the person under all the masks, so why wear them at all when only around each other?
Draco cursed as something small hit him, hard, in the shoulder blade. The pain shocked him and caused him to drop his saddle bag, apples rolling out onto the ground. A male’s voice shouted out from behind him, calling him a ‘thief’. He turned towards the voice, and then ducked to the ground. Because another apple was heading towards him. It soared over his head and hit the trunk of the tree, splattering on impact.
Lyra opened the bag, then squealed. Very loudly. Right near his ears. “Dray, where did you find them?” she asked, bringing an apple up to her eyes to inspect. She took a bite and hummed in appreciation.
Draco sent for a page and Dudley was taken out. The courtiers are whispered excitedly and flittered around the room. The blond walked back to Harry, eyebrow quirked in question. Harry grinned back and nodded. Together, they made their way out of the throne room.
. If they hadn’t been there waiting, Draco would have pulled his blaster, which he had grabbed from his pilot chair and strapped to his thigh, and started shooting bureaucrats. Pakao, he still might start shooting them, if they annoyed him too much.
Harry stood from the bed, his back creaking. The scabs across his shoulder blades twinged with the movement, but he ignored that. He was used to waking up with the pain of half healed wounds. Harry walked over to the window and opened the shutters. He leaned his elbows on the sill, closing his eyes and breathing deep.
Harry looked so relieved. He bowed slightly to her. “My lady,” he said, backing up to where the other nobles were standing to watch the fight. Draco picked up Harry’s abandoned sword, checking the balance of the blade with a frown.
A throat was cleared, which Draco brought back to the present issue. Pansy was glaring at him, practically burning holes into him. He saw her draw in a breath, and he waited to see what she shall do.
Draco smiled softly, shaking his head. He was glad she enjoyed reading more than other frivolous pursuits, like embroidery, but sometimes she got so absorbed that she ignored the real world. “I’ll come get you for dinner, then,” he said as he opened the door, “Father wants us all there. Some big announcement or something.” That said, Draco left and headed down to the archives, where, in large bound books, were a record of all the nobles of France and their holdings.
It was a couple days after Draco had brought Harry to the palace. The man’s wounds were healing nicely, under the surly but excellent tending of Severus Snape. The two butted heads, but Harry gave into his ministrations with only minimal griping. The man had not left Draco’s rooms, still too nervous to venture out of the safety of those walls. Draco was fine with that. Courtiers were exhausting and rather vindictive; he wanted Harry more comfortable with himself and his standing before braving those vultures.
Draco grimaced. “How can you be sure of that? What if he was hit after he boarded, before the hatch closed?” In the back of his mind, he noted that this was the second time Severus eluded to having close contact with a Jedi. He wondered about that, then put it out of his mind. Now was not the time.
When Draco got back to the palace, he went looking for Lyra. From a servant, he discovered that his sister had locked herself in her chambers, refusing everyone entry. Apparently, she was upset by Draco leaving for his ride. She had thought he was running away when he stormed off after his argument with his father.
Haydrien rolled his eyes. “Maybe, but we are evenly matched in skill,” he replied, “But the rest of our teams …” He trailed off with a smirk and a shrug. Draco laughed, shoving at his cousin’s shoulder. After that moment, they both returned to acting like the pureblood heirs they were.
Draco filed the reaction away for later analysis. Right now, he had an angry servant, though he did look regal, threatening him with an apple. How absurd. “Do you know who I am?” he asked, a smug smirk on his face.
“Not now,” Petunia said, laying a hand on his arm, “Later.” Dudley looked between them, confused. It was a normal look on his face.
Severus shook his head, lank hair flipping about his face. “No, I’m sure,” he replied, “Regardless of how large and deep the burn is, it was an indirect hit. Since the blast only grazed Wolfe, there would be damage in the bay where the blast hit. There wasn’t any.”
Endnotes are in three parts; only read the first one (the gore/violence description) if you need to because the second could be considered to have spoilers.
The day Draco lost his one and only best friend was the day he grew up. Never again did he act like that carefree child he was before. Father was proud; Draco was finally acting like a proper Malfoy heir. Mother was sad, because she saw her son’s pain. He never acted like a child again because it was too painful. Every childish act reminded him of Harry and he could not take it. He felt less pain if he stopped being a child.
Draco shared a look with Lyra before stepping closer to the man. “What can you tell me about their son?” he asked softly, trying not to antagonize the man.
Harry bit his lip in nervousness. The gentle squeeze from Draco had helped some but not enough to make his nerves completely go away. He started to fidget with his cuffs, unless a slight hand grabbed his wrist and pulled it away. He looked up into gray eyes and smiled, nodding his head.
Draco was also hiding the man from his father. Not that he was ashamed of Harry or anything. However, he wanted to be a bit more prepared before he faced his father. He needed Harry to believe in his birthright, and then he needed the man to agree to his proposal. While it was a bit unconventional, it had been done in other countries and would work here: taking Harry as his consort and naming his heir to be Lyra’s child, when she has one. Her marriage could still be used to political advantage; she would just marry a second or third son of a country instead of being married off to an heir. His marriage had always been planned to be in house, from one of the nobles of French court, to help solidify the nation.
,” the man continued, “I was appointed as a researcher at the Royal Science Academy. I’ve been working there ever since.”
In Harry and Hermione’s fourth year, the Tri-Wizard Tournament did happen. The champions were chosen: Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons, and Viktor Krum from Durmstrang. Cedric won. Since there were no casualties, it was decided that the tournament would happen every three years, which meant Harry and Hermione would be eligible to compete. The next tournament would be held at Durmstrang. As soon as it was decided, the pair started learning Russian, the language they heard most of the Durmstrang students speaking.
Draco watched the procession walk down the hatch for a moment, then he looked at Severus. He held out the items to the older man. “Could you …?” he asked, tilting his head towards the team.
Remus’ breath caught as his eyes landed on the bed. Harry looked so broken. So still. So unnatural. The younger man was always in some form of motion. Even with all the training, he still retained some of his nerve ticks. More than a year of abuse would do that to a person.
Draco watched his friend worry her lip between her teeth, the sharp points threatening to break the skin. “We were fine, but … it all went bad.” He ran his hand through his hair, messing up the perfect arrangement the royal stylist forced it into for the coronation. He sighed. “The worst thing,” he admitted, “is that I don’t even know what happened. He told me to get the ship ready to fly, and I was doing that. I was so focused on that nothing else registered. I vaguely remember seeing the notification that the bay door was closed, meaning he got on board, and then … nothing. He just … didn’t come up to the cockpit like I expected. And then Severus found him unconscious in the cargo bay.
“I see you still have Bartholomew. And I’m guessing the little black one is Hadrian’s.” His father’s voice drew him to see the two undead wolves that were laying on a pile of blankets in the corner. One looked older, it had thick silver fur, blind eyes, and just had a feeling of a well-loved toy. The other was a polar opposite. It seemed to be a young wolf pup with black fur and from the way it wiggled it had the energy of a puppy.
McGonagall smiled at the young Knight. She had a soft spot for Harlan. He was exceptional and his control of the force was sampling astonishing for one so young, but his past still haunted him. She hoped this mission would help him face his demons. Quite literally. “Jedi Harlan Wolfe,” she began, “The Chancellor has requested a Jedi Knight to be a protector for a senator. His life is in danger because of his involvement in the anti-slavery legislation.”
The younger students started clapping immediately, the older ones soon joining in. The pair pulled off their golden robes with a flourish, sinking into deep curtsies. When they rose up, green and blue badges were seen on their black robes. They made their way to their respective houses as an ancient wizard walked up to greet Karkaroff.
And, I think I finally have the number of chapters left figured out! It's seven, though I don't know how long each of those will be. I'm not going to change the number of chapters in the story description just yet, because the number could be subject to change (I could add more, but I'm 89% sure I won't remove any). There will be some time jumps, but I will announce them at the beginning of the chapter when they happen.
The senator stood up, motioning for Harry to follow. “Let’s get this over with,” he said as the hatch began to open, “Just be my handsome shadow.”
“That’s not my name. My name is Hadrian Mort. You never called my name so I never was called up to be sorted.” Hadrian said coolly.
Draco was talking to someone, probably the planet’s air control, requesting permission to land. The blond stated a clearance code, and the permission was granted. They started their descent. Harry steeled himself. This would not be pleasant, but he could handle it for the brief time they are there.
. “Remus,” he said as his mentor came up to him. It had been three years since they had seen each other. Remus had been stationed near the outer rim to keep the peace in a power struggle between two systems and the Hutts, and Harry had been part of the Temple Guard. They hugged silently, because neither of them were loud people; they were the silent and watchful types.
“I want a foot on how intent falls into play with Transfiguration.” McGonagall said above the noise.
“A townhouse belonging to the Potter line,” Draco answered, “I don’t know what we’ll find, but hopefully it will be more than I found down in the archives.” The path ahead was busier, closer to town. “I found two death certificates, and a birth certificate. Like Mother said, the Comtesse died from child birth while the child survived. The Comte died four years later. There was nothing about what happened to the child. That was fourteen years ago.” He looked over to Lyra. “The child would be eighteen, if they are alive.”
“If you remember,” Severus started, “I was summoned back to Čarobnjačkom. The Crown Prince had just died in a racing crash, and the new Heir Apparent asked me to come back. Once back, I started working for the royal family. Mostly archival work.”
As the pounding starts again, I remember why I was awoken. I gently lift Tia up and resettle her in the chair with a blanket tucked around her. She just snuggles into the warmth I left in the chair, still sound asleep. I walk to the door and open it, blinking in the blinding sunlight. There, on our doorstep stands Kingsley Shacklebolt, Head Auror and Harry's boss.
Remus pulled a face at that, rubbing circles with his thumb on the back of Harlan’s hand. “That does not seem,” he paused, rethinking, “You were passionate about biology and politics. Why archival work?”
Draco and Lyra set out from the castle, his black stallion and her white speckled mare riding side by side. There was a basket attached to the back of his saddle, while in Lyra’s saddle bags contains the other supplies: blankets, utensils, etc.
Baroness Petunia Dursley sneered at her reflection as she adjusted her hat. When the royal messenger came, summoning them all to the palace to appear before the King, she had wanted to get new clothing commissioned for them all. But she couldn’t. Because that
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, they’re not. I promise, just put them on,” he said, “And don’t call me that. I’m Draco to you.” He winked. “Be back in a few.”
Draco left his chambers to find Severus. He wanted to discuss their plans for the older man to come back with him to Coruscant. Harlan detached himself from the shadows and fell into step with Draco.
Draco shook his head to clear away the thoughts. Recently, he seemed to get lost in memories far more frequently than normal. It was probably caused by coming back to Čarobnjačkom.
Behind them, completely ignored, stand Draco and Fudge. The older man sighed. “Well, at least they’ll each have someone to talk with.” Draco did roll his eyes that time.
The ships in front of him disappeared while Draco marveled at Cadmus, having slipped into the cave landing bay. He followed their lead and carefully brought his ship in. Cave was a generous title. The landing pad was nestled under an overcropping. Buildings were built up and on the ledge of bedrock. The hospital was right near the opening.
“The mood needs to be set before you make your grand entrance, so wait an hour before coming down. Come to the north door, which will open to the backstage area. I will be there to meet you, and will announce you to all the lovely men on the dance floor. Maybe you could find Mr. Right out on the dance floor.” She gave Draco a cheeky wink and exits the bedroom.
Harry could almost see the sarcasm drip off the words. With what Master McGonagall said and his firsthand knowledge of Čarobnjačkom, that made sense; the Senator was a Krv Čista who was pushing to abolish slavery. Of course, relations with his family would be stranded.
Shacklebolt sighed, glancing at the other people in the room: the other senators pushing for the anti-slavery bill and a representative from the Jedi Council. “I cannot allow that, Senator Malfoy,” he said regretfully, “Because you are spearheading the anti-slavery bill, it is in your best interest to not go back to Čarobnjačkom. The political unrest of the panet makes you a target.”
He could hear Severus sigh. “That Jedi Knight, Harlan Wolfe, is one of the most powerful Jedis to pass the Trials in centuries,” he said.
Harry tried to get out of bed again, going slowly this time. He pushed through the pain as silently as possible. Not as quietly as he hoped, though. At one of his gasps of pain, the blond jerked awake. The prince rubbed at his eyes as he sat up straight. He looked over at Harry on the bed and smiled soflty.
He still had moments where he could not believe it. That he was a Comte. That all that land was his by birthright. He scowled. That the Baroness was his aunt. That she had treated her one flesh and blood like that. He took a deep breath to calm himself down. She, and the Baron, and the young Baron would get what was coming to them. Draco had promised that they would stand for their crimes, all of their crimes, and face the dire consequences.
I know it's short, but it had to be that way. That's how it panned out in my outline. The next one should be longer.
“Potter, Harry” the annoying old woman stated and the whole school seemed to wait with baited breath. Hadrian didn’t move. They had already passed the Ms and his name hadn’t been called.
The man looked confused, his arm with the apple lowering. “But if …” He trailed off. He shook his head, wild black waves dancing around his face. “No, stop, you’re wrong,” he said, glowering, “And you’re distracting me from my point.” He raised his arm again. “Thief! How dare you?!”
Harry sat in his chair as the blond maneuvered the ship. He needed to process everything he just learned. Particularly, the part about him. It did appear that the senator was Draco, his friend before the Dursleys.
The ceremony passed in a blur. Harry knew he did everything correctly, repeated the appropriate lines when prompted by the bishop, but his mind was focus on the blond in front of him. The man he loved with all his heart. He came out of his daze when the bishop decreed them bound as Dauphin and Lord Consort, and Draco leaned in to kiss him. He melted into that kiss, the kiss that sealed them together before their family, their country, and their God. He pulled back after a few seconds, because else the kiss would not have stayed chaste, as customs demanded.
That was the image that still sticks the most in Draco’s mind. The roses had an abhorrent beauty to them. The dark red of the blood stood out so piercingly against the perfect white of the petals. The roses had made the whole scene surreal. They had been everywhere; some had still been whole while others had been reduced to just petals, fluttering occasionally in the wind. Everything covered in blood.
An hour later, they heard leaves scrunching as someone approached. “Back again?” a voice called out.
Also, just as a warning, I probably will not be posting as regularly as I had in the past. While my wrist was broken, I was hired as a math teacher. I will be busy getting everything ready and organized for when school starts. Hopefully, I will still have time to write, at least a little bit here and there.
“In my defense,” he stated, “I’m still not fully awake, and I’m panicking. Sorry, but social decencies are not a high priority right now.” The Knight stood up, cloak and lightsaber in hand. “I’m now my way.”
Remus chuckled softly. “No, no I still don’t,” he replied. He sighed, looking down at Harry in the bed. He hated this, hated seeing the young man in the hospital.
After Lyra changed, dress tucked into a bag, they were off again. Draco led them down the path for about an hour, then veered off it. The trees were thick, the light green and shifting with the leaves. Soon, they could see gaps in the trees ahead, and the trees looked more uniform. They were nearing the orchard. At the border to between orchard and forest, there was a crumbling stone retaining wall. Draco nudged his horse to jump over it, Lyra following just behind.
, would get the medical attention he needed. But Draco refused to sacrifice precision for speed. Felidae was notorious for its awkward landing pads; many ships had crashed trying to land on the planet because the pilots were not paying proper attention.
After a long while, Draco stood up, pressing a softly kiss to the man’s raven hair. “I’ll be back in a few minutes,” he murmurs, “There’s someone you need to meet.” Harry nodded absently.
“We were wondering if you understood the charms material. Professor Flitwick didn’t explain it very well.” Draco said a blush covering his cheeks.
Harry had wanted to laugh at their reaction, but he managed to hold it in. Around him, the other nobility tittered in excitement. Dieu, they were vultures; they fed on the downfall of others of their kind. Harry glanced to the side, glad he had made a friend in Luna. He nearly ducked down when Dudley looked around the gathered courtiers, as if looking for help. But his rational mind stopped him; with his new look, none of three would ever recognize him.
Harry smiled in response. He pulled a textbook out of his bag and put it on the tabletop. He narrowed his eyes from behind ugly glasses, obviously trying to figure out what Draco was reading. He whistled softly. “Molecular Orbital Theory,” he read, “That sounds so crazy. Are you a graduate student?”
The left hand side figure raised its wand, and a magnificent lion leap from the tip. Lines of students with red badges walked beneath the proud beat to the ride side of the hall. “
“He looks for the godson he lost. The one you stole from him.” Lucius said, “Why did you take the boy. You’re a Death Eater for Merlin’s sake.” Cas sighed
Just then, the large double doors opened before him. Harry took a deep breath and began walking forward. There were … so many more people than he exacted. And not all of them nobility. He vaguely recognized faces of the common folk of France in the back of the cathedral. As he moved further down the aisle, the nobles came into sight.
Draco felt a hand pull on his arm. He startled, looking to Severus. He had practically forgotten the older man was there. Together, they ran to the ship. As Draco was about to step onto the ship, he spared a glance back towards the fight. He saw Harlan holding the men off, moving as if part of a deadly dance. The Knight fought so fluidly, so naturally. It was magnificent to behold. And so hot, too.
Draco could already feel a headache coming on, and he still had to suffer through dinner with his father. Joy. Their argument that morning about his marital options was still fresh in his mind, and he really did not want to be in same room as the king.
Slowly, the Baron and Baroness realized who exactly was leaning against the Dauphin’s throne. It took a while; in their defense, Harry looked nothing like he used to as the mistreated servant-slave. Horror and panic filled their eyes as they looked over the man. Harry smirked at their reactions.
Harry smiled. “And, since we can all speak the language,” she added, “we’ll have a leg up above the other girls.”
Harry sighed as he wandered through the palace gardens. They were beautiful. They had a feel like organized, meticulously maintained chaos, which in Harry’s opinion was much prettier than the rigid layout Baron Dursley had demanded for her gardens.
Also, as a side note, apart from my two one-shots, this is the first fic that I've actually completed!! (which is actually rather sad since I've been writing for over 8 years, maybe longer)
Interesting. Very interesting. You are smart, definitely could be in Ravenclaw but also cunning, like a Slytherin. The hat spoke directly into his mind.
"That, my pet, is the bank. Gringotts. Now, remember, don't touch anything until we get to your vault." His father said as they entered the building. They strolled up to the large counter and before the goblin could ask anything his father was speaking
She frowned, her ears twitching forward. “Are you alright? The medical aid is not for you, right? You should be perfectly safe on Coruscant.”
“I... I lied. I couldn’t keep telling our Lord things and watch as things went differently. It was easier to say that I used a botched ritual and keep the things I Saw secret. Time isn’t like a straight line, Lucius. It’s like a tree with so many branches that even the littlest thing can change which path the world takes.” Cas said, desperation lacing his voice.
Chancellor Shacklebolt rubbed his temples as the doors closed behind the blond. “Impetuous youth,” he muttered. Master McGonagall and the other senators just chuckled.
Hey guys! So, kind of random, but there's this rp game my friends are running, called the Prefect Problem. It takes place during fifth year. Character applications close the 15th (so, in 6 days, sorry about the last minute notice). I hope you guys will check it out =) . Here's the link to it: http://the-prefect-problem.deviantart.com/
“Hadrian.” Cas said calling the boy over from where he was looking at a pair of dragonhide boots. They were currently in Madame Malkins waiting in line to be fitted for the robes.
Draco’s throne, to the left of his parents’, was empty, but Lyra was in hers. Of course, that was under protest. She was dressed like a proper lady, in a two tone
Petunia scoffed. “Because you, Vernon, are vile, and everyone always compared me to Perfect Lilian,” she said, pointing a finger at Harry then, “
Severus sighed, shifting his hands on his lap. Clenched in one fist was a pendant Sirius gave him on their tenth anniversary. “You’re right,” the man conceded, “I would have access to many more resources. And I’d …”
Haydrien breathed deeply as the portkey landed. His family had a private portkey, so it was just the four of them: Ui Luc, Uika Cissa, Uiets Draco, and himself. Of course, only amongst family would those names be used. They were elite Purebloods, after all. Certain levels of decorum were expected. Like not sprawling on the ground after a portkey. All around them, other portkeys were arriving, and most of the people ended up on the ground. Haydrien sneered down at them.
Draco smirked from his spot next to the window. He orchestrated it all, and he could see the effect it was having on the Dursleys. The tension in their bodies. The red rue to the Baron’s face. The unease in the Baroness’ eyes. He could see the unease grow as they were essentially ignored by the courtiers. Oh, he knew that they were all very aware of the trio’s entrance; they just did not care that much. At least, not yet.
However, Draco’s smile soon melted to a frown. Harlan should have come into the cockpit by now; the ship was not that large. He had a bad feeling in his gut. He turned to Severus.
,” the man said, stressing the word, “is that while the Knight might look like our Harry, he is not still our Harry. The child we knew is buried under layers of trauma, experience, training, and masks. All carefully crafted to protect himself.” The man turned his chair to the side to face Draco. “Now, imagine. You’ve created this armor around yourself that shields you from threats and hides your vulnerabilities from others. And then, a blast from your past re-enters your life. Shakes everything up. Rattles that armor you built. Would you open up or hunker down to weather the storm? I think Harlan chose the latter.”
Severus arched an eyebrow at Draco, sitting back in his chair. “What I was saying before that little tangent,” he started, “Harlan Wolfe may be this powerful Jedi Knight on the outside, but he is probably still that timid little boy that we knew on the inside. Maybe.” The man shrugged. “We don’t actually know what happened to him in the intervening years. We know your father sold him when you both were six. We don’t know to which family you father sold him. There are many horrible, horrible people, much worse than the royal family.”
The package attached is the anthology. It is filled with love poems that make me think of you, of us. I'll be home soon
Draco cleared his throat, refocusing on the task at hand. “So, Sirius Black,” he started, “Son of King Orion and Queen Wallburga. We’re going back for his funeral.” He swallowed down his grief. “Sirius and I did not fit in with our family. We aren’t, well weren’t in his case, subscripted to their beliefs. We saw the flaws of our home.” Draco was a flash of some emotion cross over the Knight’s face, but it was gone too quickly for him to read. He mentally shrugged and continued.
Draco glanced at the gardens, situated right next to the manor. From the window, he could see the rose gardens. They were arranged by four sections in a square, each side a different color. In the center of the square was a fountain. A very beautiful fountain. It was of a mother unicorn with her foal, both of them drinking from the gurgling spring. Mother sat on the edge of the fountain, dripping her fingers in the water and staring blankly at the roses.
“Father is close to figuring out how to go about brewing the Elixir of Life,” Hadrian responded, “He tracked down a book, and now he is working on translating it.”
“What are you miscreants doing?!” A voice shouted, causing the siblings to nearly jump out of  their skins. They had thought they were alone, but apparently, they had been mistaken.
The rest of the group looked fascinated with the topic. Theo, in particular, leaned forward. “What language is it in?” he asked. The boy had a strong interest in languages, specifically old and unused ones.
“You’re not getting rid of me that easily,” the Knight said, “Just leave the landing hatch open for me. When you’re ready to blast away from this planet, I’ll hop aboard.” With a wink, the Knight turned around, raising his saber in time to deflect a blaster shot.
Hadrian watched boredly as the rest of the school filled in the tables that morning at breakfast. It had been a week since school had started and rumors about him were flying around. Some were harmless but some were downright hurtful. Still, he didn’t let anyone see how much they affected him. He watched as Draco strutted in. So far, they hadn’t really had much time together. Hadrian wasn’t sure if it was because of the old man or if it was just coincidence but Hadrian saw a lot more of Granger and Weasel than he did his own best friend. Sometimes he saw the twins but they were often with older students and he didn’t feel like explaining why he was talking to the twins to those who would never understand. Classes were easy and rather boring. Hadrian often spent the time he should have been paying attention reading higher level books.
Draco stepped in front of Vernon, biting back a smirked. “You are sentenced to death,” he said, then paused for dramatic effect, “You will be beheaded by the afflicted party.”

Hermione was not familiar with those herbs, and that irked her. Vaguely, she knew them to have healing properties, but not what those were, specifically. She looked to the other man; with a doctorate in biology, he could know more about the herbs. She watched, gauging his reaction.
“Happy Birthday, Harry,” he whispered to himself. Though he turned eighteen today, the Dursleys did not care. It was just another day to them. The last people to care had been the Weasleys, the Dursleys’ other servants. The family had been employed on the estate as long as Harry could remember. He had memories of the family’s matriarch presenting him with a small pastry as her children gathered round to celebrate. But that had been many years ago. The eldest son, William, had been the last Weasley still left working as a Dursley servant, and he had been let go two years ago. For a lack of funds to pay him, so the Dursleys claimed. Now, it was just Harry. Alone.
“Potter? How am I supposed to know?” his father answered, leaning back in his chair, “There are too many courtiers to keep track.” The man waved his hand dismissively. “What does it matter, anyway? One courtier, either way. There are so many to choose from. Just pick a different one.”
Draco shrugged. “It did not say,” he answered, continuing before Lyra could protest, “The certificate in the archives was an incomplete copy: no name or gender listed for the child.”
Draco stood up and walked quickly to the other man. He lifted a hand up, fingers almost touching the purpled skin, but he held back. It angered him. Someone had dared to touch the man. To hurt him. To mar his perfect olive skin. He wanted justice.

Here, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are not an inseparable trio. Actually, all three of them are in different houses: Harry in Slytherin, Ron in Gryffindor, and Hermione in Ravenclaw. Harry and Hermione had bonded on the train, and that bond could not be broken by their sorting. They grew to be the best of friends, studying and working together. The pair was very intelligent in their own rights, and together they soon became the top students of their year, if not the entire school.
