. I know myself well enough to be realistic there.
He racked his brain to think of something to say that would sound even remotely sexy (rather than him coming off like a grunting cave man). But then he thought, bugger it, he was trying too hard. Draco, with his expansive vocabulary and an intellect that rivaled Hermione's, got him hard as iron with the simplest of phrases. Harry could give him exactly what he asked for.
"Apparently not," Harry groused, but he stooped to pick up his newspaper anyway. He surreptitiously adjusted his trousers and jogged to catch up to Draco.

He pushed his free hand under Draco's jumper to find one of his nipples. When he did, he gave it a hard pinch.
He leapt onto the table to appraise the two plates. They were nearly identical--both heaped with juicy baked chicken, golden fried potatoes, and vibrant steamed broccoli--but one featured the addition of two boiled eggs. He instinctively knew that plate was meant for him and he silently thanked the house-elves for their thoughtfulness. He hadn't even been certain they'd noticed him in the kitchen, so enamoured were they with Potter's presence.
"What I want," Draco began as he moved to hover over the Auror and smile, most evilly, above him, "is something to say 'hands off!' To anyone who might be interested besides me."
It was a flattering, if somewhat overwhelming, thought.
Despite his best attempts not to, Harry
"I know," he said simply, smirking down at his lover with a deliberately long lick of his lips. "Now, do you want to fuck me or should I ride you?"
Draco finally released the grip he had on Harry's ass and slid his hands instead to the Auror's hips. He pushed up, arching his body away lazily, and turned until he was facing Harry again. His arms went around Harry's neck and his lips moved to kiss and nibble along his jaw.
Draco bounced on top of him, flushed and grinning. Harry wanted badly to kiss him. Touch him. Ride him. Use his hands again. Maybe his tongue.

He grasped the base of his prick tightly to keep from spilling his load right then and there.
appeared as any other upscale restaurant would from the outside. The whole street, at first blush, seemed almost like Diagon Alley--and in a way it was, only far more expensive. There were shops, of course, including a chocolatier Draco occasionally frequented and an owlery down the street that he knew housed only Eagle owls. And all of Wizarding London's best fashion houses were crammed along the narrow alley (much larger on the inside with the judicious application of wizardspace).
Malfoy's face was unreadable--competing emotions chased their way across his sharp features so quickly Harry couldn't keep up.
Harry turned his face heavenward. Whether for an answer, a prayer for peace, or that they both might be smote where they stood, he wasn’t sure.
It was
He watched closely as Draco took a cautious bite. "What do you think?" he asked, expression eager.
Harry delighted in the sounds Draco was making, from the unrestrained noises of pleasure to the flippant commentary, even the wet squelch of his prick sliding between his fingers.
"Merlin's tits!" Harry yelped. He didn't turn around, though. That would give her too much satisfaction. No, he marched with as much dignity as he could muster to the owlry (arsecheek stinging all the while) to set up his appointment with Malfoy and request permission to access the restitution fund records. It would be easier for him if Malfoy was willing to meet at his office but Harry offered to return to his residence if he'd rather. Now that he'd been there once, he could apparate directly to the front door, at least.
"Keep that up and I won't care that we have an audience,” he whispered darkly before slamming their lips together in a fast, hard kiss. “I mean it.”
Draco nodded, reluctantly.
Malfoy drew his arm back sharply, Harry noted that that, too, was not as smooth as a gesture as it should have been. The Slytherin's own long-fingered hand was slightly clawed where it came to rest at his side.
"Laugh it up, fuzzball," Potter intoned. He pointed a finger at Draco and sardonically declared, "I should feed you to Mrs. Norris."
Dear Malfoy,

At Parkinson and Zabini, sure--snakes were apparently taught how to handle an interrogation at an early age; their refusal to talk convinced him of their guilt--but mostly at himself. His job would now be a whole lot harder because he'd been hasty in bringing them in. And Draco might be in even more danger because of his lapse in judgement.
******
He pulled the apron off over Draco's head and palmed his hardening shaft, combing his fingers through the soft, blond thatch of curls from which it sprouted.
Harry snorted, shaking his head in amused exasperation. "Are you quite finished?"
(It wasn't bad, but it could have been better. You know Ravenclaws, they think too much about everything--even kissing.)
Draco glowered but indicated the first response with a single grunt. It was the more accurate of the two.
Yes I fancy you. I thought that much was clear. I would rather not say for how long.
He glared unblinking at the one who looked to be the leader of the pack as they passed lest the bloke consider starting trouble. He might still, of course, especially while their backs were turned, but Harry wanted him to know beyond a shadow of a doubt who it was he'd be causing grief and just how bad an idea that would be.
We've got time. The tournament isn't for another three months. For an event of this size, it is crucial to iron out such details as who will be playing and what sorts of accommodations they might need well in advance (those details will all be in your contract.) And, Salazar, it sounds like I'm going to  need it if I'm to have any hope of keeping up with you...let alone giving you a run for the Snitch (if I should be so lucky)!
"I don't know," he said in reply to the first question, running his palms up Draco's (almost hairless) thighs, over his sharp hips and trim waist, and returning to do it over again. "But I would do almost anything for you," he responded to the second, fully honest.

******
"What are your qualifications?" Malfoy demanded, with a disdainful arch of his pale brow.
Though irritated, Harry could understand where the man was coming from--appearances where everything for a pureblood, and Malfoy was steadily losing control over his. Never mind the dreadful sense of powerlessness, which was surely an important theme in Malfoy's life (if Harry's own experiences were anything to go on).
"Don't play dumb with me, Collins," Janine warned. "The best part of my Mondays isn't here and you've got 'it's all my fault' written all over your stupidly handsome face."
It used to be that he said it to everyone he dated, starting with Ginny, until he realized that it wasn't true. What he felt was similar, but not the same: fondness, lust, infatuation, attachment.

Draco fell uncomfortably onto the Head Auror's desk with Potter on top of him. He didn't have time to enjoy the hot licking to his ear before they Apparated and his back banged onto the old wood- barely missing the sharp quill stand. He looked up at the man straddling his hips and pouted.
specifically to create a possible suspect list. Once I get a good look at your attacker in the pensieve, it should be a relatively simple matter to whittle down the results by physical description." Unless, of course, the individual was clever enough to use polyjuice or a glamour. But Malfoy didn't need to hear anything so discouraging; it was clear that he was having a hard enough time just being in the Ministry, despite his casual mien.
Dear Potter,
“Do you make a habit of ordering your ‘manservants’ to strip?” he fired back, sneering around the offending word even as a part of his brain cautioned him to avoid upsetting Malfoy on day one of Operation: Grand Gesture (and another smaller but no-less-compelling and entirely Gryffindor part was urging him to just get on with it already and see what happens).
Dear Draco,
Pansy flinched, but recovered quickly.
. Harry nearly cringed but he managed to smother it. Malfoy went on, none the wiser. "My symptoms have steadily worsened to the point that I can hardly use a quill or wield my wand with any precision, and I can no longer hide my condition. And you will wipe that pitying look off your face this instant or I will march out that door and file a complaint with both your superior and

rather substantial, it is easy to overlook in our field of work.
"It'll be an early bedtime with no treats for you, Edward," Andromeda informed her grandson, frown severe. "And you'll go straight to the bath when we get home," she added, eying the sticky mess with distaste.
At this rate, he'd be back to himself in no time!
Harry popped his still-piping bite into his mouth and chased it with a spoonful of ice cream, which melted immediately and mixed with the soufflé, cooling it and making it sweet enough for his jaw to tingle.
Draco grabbed Potter's hands and pulled him forward off the desk. He made sure to immediately wrap an arm around his waist to ensure he would remain upright.
“What time is it?” Malfoy asked slowly, getting his bearings while he remained perfectly ensconced on Harry’s lap. His voice was deeper, slightly husky, rough around the edges and not quite as crisp as in full wakefulness. And it did dangerous things to Harry, summoning thoughts and associations that would have been risky on a good day but were downright suicidal with Malfoy lounging in proximity to his groin.
He wasn't quite ready to reciprocate in kind, but he was eager for the feel of Draco in his hand. He snuck his left under Draco's jumper to stroke his leanly muscled back and brushed the other along Draco's thigh to cup his package, kissing all the while.
Harry
So just the three? Well, damn. Looks like I have plenty of room for improvement, then. Those are good qualities to have all the same, so thanks, but a lot of people are selfless and brave--like Neville or Hermione. What makes me different? Besides being speccy. Unless you think glasses are sexy.
Auror Potter
"I wouldn't say no to a second helping sometime."
Dear Draco,
So, ignore what I said before. There is only ONE chapter left, just the one. Not almost or just under ten. Derp.
Draco saluted and moved to the steps off the marble platform, ignoring the expected hissing of gossip. The blonde silently cackled at the subdued outrage and shock of the other guests.
"I'm glad you like it," Draco replied with a chuckle as he avoided the vegetables, despite having cooked them. "I wasn't sure how you would feel about beets or the seared brussel sprouts, but I am glad you enjoy them. In fact, you can have them all! I mostly added them for color and tried to cook it to my tastes, but alas... I shall never be a health nut."
He dropped onto the sofa and ran his hands through his hair, attempting every self-soothing trick he knew. They weren't particularly effective just then.
you want to change back?" he asked teasingly, ruffling Draco's scruff. "You're more likable as a ferret, you know."
They'll confiscate it as contraband and try to duplicate it for their own use and profit. Unscrupulous pit vipers.)
He waited until Potter was reasonably ensnared by the satiny garment before beginning to unbutton his robes, starting at the collar and working his way down slowly.
The risk of scarring is great enough as it is and Merlin knows you've got plenty of them already. You look like you got into a fight with the Monster Book of Monsters and lost.
"Draco," he choked, pleaded. "Come on, baby."
He was about to find out. Minutes after the last letter was sent the floo turned green and expelled Draco into the downstairs living room. Despite their conversation, his last letter hadn't been... Entirely truthful. He was still wary of germs and the idea of kissing his sick partner was something he might have an issue with.
"You know," he announced, "I may skip the meal and jump straight to dessert."
He began to walk again as he dug back into his fish. He was even brave enough to sample the two meal components together and found it wasn't so bad.

oo00oo00oo
Draco,
You have many problems, Potter.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said, pointing with his fork, "you are full of shit."
He peered in the windows of shops as they passed, noting eye-catching displays for the latest broom models, self-cleaning owl cages, magical weight loss potions, and the like, everything vying noisily for attention (and galleons). He was looking forward to the relative quiet of the restaurant.
Speaking of, Potter sat right across from Draco in an equally comfortable looking seat of a different colour (chocolate brown and pale gold, respectively). In fact, everything in the sitting room was colourful and mismatched, but in a purposeful fashion.
As Draco unscrewed the cap, Harry shed his trousers and pants, tossing them into the pile of clothes that already occupied his bedroom floor. Thus freed, he positioned himself at the foot of the bed, kneeling with his knees spread wide so they'd both have a good view. He took his prick in hand and waited.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hope you like blueberries."
"Later. After dinner. And something about a show? In the mean time I shall plot ways to win you back from this villainous noble."
"Enough of that. This subject is far too depressing. Let's dance!"
He fell atop Draco as soon as a sofa of some sort was in sight (never mind that it appeared to be a priceless antique). He pushed Draco's long legs wider and immediately began to grind and thrust down, as eager as a wild dog.
Harry waited patiently for Draco to come out from under the dress. He bent down as far as he could comfortably go (nearly toppling over) and grabbed Draco around the waist to lift him up.
"Good," Draco uncorked the bottle and lifted it up for Harry to sniff (just as he realized Potter had gone from "Potter" to "Harry" via the magic of fluffy words and a great blow job.) He poured some directly onto the tip of Harry's cock, letting the thick, blue liquid drizzle down the length on its own until it was circling the base of Harry's cock. Draco put the bottle aside on the bedside table and grasped his Gryffindor's cock once again--stroking it languidly.
Truth.
He dipped into a perfect French accent as he spoke the name of the dish and flipped a page in the menu without seeming to notice it.
His eyes flicked over the mess--which looked as though someone had cast a large expulso at Draco's wardrobe and desk--and took in the general decor.
Merlin, how was he ever going to make up for taking advantage of Draco like that?
Harry looked up from the book he'd been skimming to pass the time (
"Shut it, you," Harry grumbled, elbowing his smart-mouthed boyfriend in the side.
He regretted the words almost as soon as they'd left his mouth.
"I don't believe I am under the influence of any potions at present," Draco said as he mentally shrugged off the sting of rejection (not that he expected Potter to take him up on the offer). "What was the last question you asked me? Something about my friends? Did it have to do with the memory?"
Much obliged,
It was glorious.
"You like it rough, do you?" he responded, voice like gravel. He withdrew completely and flipped Draco onto his stomach, hoisting his arse in the air before entering him roughly from behind. "That more to your liking, pet?" he drawled.
*****
Harry silently wished everyone else would follow suit and leave him and Draco alone to process the horrible evening, but he would never be so lucky.
******
Draco just smirked as he served up the meal and sauntered over to the table with an exaggerated sway in his step. Harry shed his boots and outer robes, but kept his shirt and trousers.
"I finally know what it feels like to be tall," he chuckled, before taking a few (somewhat clumsy) steps back to peer over Draco's nude form. His grin, and his obvious erection, grew with approval.
"When I met you as a patient, you told me I had to trust you, and then you betrayed that trust."
*****
"The show's about to start," Harry murmured reassuringly.
"Wouldn't you like to know," Potter smirked.
"Auror Potter is your client for the evening," Draco announced, motioning casually at the wizard who needed no introduction. "There is the dress. We are under something of a time limit as dinner will be ready soon, but please do ensure that it fits him flatteringly and securely. He will be wearing it for a full day."
, Malfoy," Harry hissed, glancing around to see who might be watching, "put your bloody hand down. You're making a scene." He moved to stand between the infuriating prat and the majority of their curious onlookers.
He also hoped Draco's affections didn't reflect poorly on him, given his shite taste in friends.
Pacing the length of the Burrow's crowded living room with an excess of agitation, Harry said the first thing that came to him.
Draco finally set his glass down and turned to fully face Potter. He offered a long, pale hand again and flashed his teeth in a playful grin.
Sweet Merlin, those shiny white trousers were like a second skin. They may as well have been laced with Amortentia for the way they captivated him.
Harry spluttered, nearly choking on his tea. "Oh. I wasn't planning on--" he cleared his squeaky throat and scratched the side of his head awkwardly.
"You know," he began again, attempting to be coy, "since we're on the subject of you and blokes... How is the git--I mean, Malfoy's case coming? Find the fellow who nearly did him in yet?"
Draco sighed. He hadn't been concentrating much on his mind (hoping he could distract Harry enough to have him forget their conversation.)
It was definitely different from a toy. Harry was hot, his velvety skin moved and bunched with Draco's movements, and the flavour was musky and bittersweet. He loved it. He took a deep breath before sliding even further, inhaling deeply the scent that was all

Godrick, it would be so satisfying to deck him right in the condescending smirk. Even better than Zabini. He just needed a reason...any one would do.
Potter
"You tell me, since you seemed to have kept up with my lack of appearance--or so you indicated at the wedding. I was almost touched! So, exactly how long have I been out of the constant lime light?"
Positions reversed (and all thoughts of illness far from his mind), he pushed Draco's legs up and away to have a clear view of his sweet pink, glistening hole. He'd intended to pick up right where he left off but he couldn't resist the impulse for a taste.
Following directions was not one of Malfoy's strong suits (no real surprise there). Harry went to get the vegetables he was supposed to add to the skillet and did it for him, stepping back quickly to avoid a face full of hissing steam. He then filled a bowl with boiling water for couscous and saved the rest for tea.
While Harry wished Ron could have had a better attitude about the whole thing, the dinner went about as well as he could realistically have hoped.
Do you still favour the Falmouth Falcons? They're playing well this year. Here's two tickets for their Boxing Day game against the Cannons. If you haven't got anyone to go with you, I'd be happy to. As long as you don't mind your companion rooting for the enemy.

But as far as convincing goes, you got it perfectly right (for once).
"I assume you mean the needle incident? Quite a strange instrument, a muggle syringe. Normally magic would destroy certain muggle technologies, but a syringe is manual--metal and plastic. No mechanics involved... Almost unassuming and so tiny. You can probably imagine how surprised I was to learn about it."
Was that a challenge?
. Harry did like it. So much so that his bollocks drew up tight against his body (quickly enough to make him somewhat queasy) as he careened toward the precipice at a breakneck pace.
Harry turned Draco's patented smirk-and-sassy-eyebrow maneuver on the sexy Slytherin and shimmied lower on the mattress, pulling the blankets all the way over himself and covering Draco up to the waist so he wouldn't get cold.
"I want to see you naked," he answered simply. "I want to wash you. And then, after we eat, I plan to enjoy every second of making you dirty once again. And if you're
Harry and Draco waved good bye until their guests apparated away, and then the door closed. The blonde huffed.
He sighed and settled back in his seat.
Believe me yet?
"My first time was excellent and I am quite glad I waited, but I doubt it would have been anything less even if it wasn't--considering my partner." Draco cast his eyes upward at last and grinned.
He now had the challenge of deciding just how much 'exploration' he wanted to do with Malfoy and when. His prick had a clear opinion but Harry wasn't going to take someone's virginity on a lark. Even if Malfoy acted like it was no big deal, it was to him.
"You've mentioned it," he replied. "But it's still nice to hear. What did you think of the music?"
******
“I hadn’t noticed,” Malfoy replied, not unkindly, but Harry was sure he was just being polite. (Fancy that.)
I can now appreciate your qualities for what the are, along with the striking package that contains them. You are quite a man, Harry Potter.
Despite Harry’s meager attempt at damage control, an awkward silence descended. He cast about for safe topics of conversation to fill the void, feeling it even more acutely now that they had been conversing so well.
Harry,
"Stop before you embarrass yourself, you silly man," Draco answered, but his viselike grip on Harry's hand betrayed the flippant jibe.
, especially after everything he had done during the War, was such a far cry from reality for him that every day he spent with the man felt almost like a dream (though all of that was far too Hufflepuff to ever admit out loud.) Finding out Blaise and Pansy, his two closest confidants, might truly be "out to get him" was just as unbelievable and practically Earth shattering. And he hadn't been allowed to speak to either them, by floo or owl. Draco had expected them to at least attempt to speak with him, though--orders to avoid him or not, but received nothing. It almost felt like weird cosmic sacrifice--Pansy and Blaise in exchange for Harry. One he was more than willing to make if they were really behind any of the attacks.
No matter. Despite the inauspicious start to his afternoon, things were looking up.
If I was being subtle I doubt you'd have noticed. I was dropping hints far longer than items and not once had you bothered to take the bait, so instead I went with a more physical approach--
"I have to change," he sighed dejectedly. "Should only take a minute." (There was no way that was true.)
Harry
Draco sighed.
He squeezed tightly as Draco had instructed and rubbed his thumb over his sensitive slit, gasping at the sensation combined with the incredible visual. Draco's hand was a blur, three fingers inside his body now. It really seemed like he was going to come just from that. Harry hadn't known that was possible. He stared unblinking, panting, as his own hand matched Draco's punishing pace and he hurtled toward his orgasm. His thighs were burning and his heart thundered in his ears, almost loud enough to drown out the lewd squelching noises of their mutual gratification, but not quite.

“I believe you’re right.” Saw, poke. “It seemed almost to be wild magic.” Bite, chew. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Have you?”
"Go on then," Harry prompted, giving him a nudge.
oo00oo00oo
Draco thought confidentially as he strode forward to the only table in the room, an antique pearl-coloured dining suite with matching champagne trolley.
The blonde wore a surgeon's mask with face shield, medical robes, and a cap over his hair. In one hand was a small bag--a briefcase, rather--and in the other he held his wand and began casting disinfectants and cleansers as he slowly made his way to the stairs and toward the bedroom.
It would lend credence to his idea that Malfoy's sex scenes were pure fiction.
And if I get sick I expect proper care in return!
The words stung like a slap.
Draco,
******
Tell me the truth, do you want me?
Harry could not but agree. He hadn't meant for any of this.
His voice cracked a little at first, but quickly gained a snarky momentum.
Draco's entire body visibly relaxed. He smiled again as his hand slid from Harry's cheek into his hair and pulled him down for a quick kiss.
Bixby glared sidelong at Harry but replied, “Of course. When is Master Draco...and
Harry decided to leave work a bit early because Draco's anxiety over dinner had reached a fevered pitch. No matter how many times and how many different ways he tried to reassure him, Draco seemed certain the evening was going to be a disaster, so Harry packed up his work in progress, bid goodbye to Ron, and made his way home.
Harry gleefully dove back in for another glorious snog, mirroring Draco's tactics and snaking his hands into the other man's shirt to clutch at the lovely muscles of his back.

Draco, instead of growing instantly annoyed, merely chuckled and lifted himself to stare darkly down at Potter. His hand pulled out teasingly slow from Potter's hot chute and instead gripped the body of his own cock.

Harry fought down the urge to follow.
Draco
I appreciate your offer of assistance, but I shall not be joining you in the library. I don't want someone to catch us together and turn you into a pariah. If you could please just tell me the topic of the essay, that will be more than enough.
There was plenty of innuendo laced around that single syllable.
"'Any minute', you said? You may want to move a little faster. Or does the thought of seeing me nude intimidate you that much?"
"Hm," was all Harry said in response before employing the foolproof defense mechanism of falling asleep on his lover.
"You're not bloody fine, Malfoy!" he shouted, taking an angry step closer to the blonde. "That's why you're here!"
Harry grinned wolfishly. Malfoy's pupils were blown wide, his lips flushed red and cheeks tinged pink, and he panted for breath. He'd reached for sass and couldn't find it, which meant a job well done for him.
. Never mind the fact you "borrowed" mine for, oh...a whole bloody year!
Harry snorted.

He lifted his head and tossed it to the side in an attempt to force his hair away from his face. He frowned as parts of it either didn't move, heavy from sweat, or fell right back into place over his eyes.
"... Muggles have a procedure to fix eyes?" The very idea of it was mind boggling, at least to Draco. He lifted his glass to his mouth once more and mulled over the magical possibilities of a similar, Wizarding version as he drank.
Rather than fighting it, he embraced it, humping into Potter's fist until he was on the very precipice.

Draco didn't take the time to think about it. He didn't have to.
No need. I took care of your reports just this morning, as I had all
He looked good.
When Draco rubbed his finger against Harry's prostate again, the whole experience went up a notch in his estimation. Everything was suddenly great. (Draco was great. The oral sex was great. Even the finger in Harry'sarse was great.) His nerve endings flared and his prick spasmed and his muscles contracted hard enough to lift his feet off the table.
Details you say? Aren't you at all concerned they might distract you from your very important job?
I am fairly certain that soliciting sex from a muggle while your prick is lit up like a Christmas tree is a violation of the Statute of Secrecy. But
He released Draco's arms entirely to ruck up his shirt (which was already riding deliciously high) and pull it up and over his head. When Draco's smooth, pale torso was exposed, he ran his hands and lips and tongue and teeth over it greedily. He laved one of Draco's small, pert nipples with his tongue until it pebbled, then took it between his teeth to gently tug.
An intense look in his eyes over a wild smirk, he bent down to latch his mouth onto Harry's collarbone. His hands nearly broke the zipper of Harry's trousers in his growing agitation at the Auror's lack of nudity.
"Wouldn't dream of it," he answered mirthfully, just before lifting Draco off the mattress with a sizable thrust that startled a gasp out of his lover. "I've got you exactly where I want you," he added, following the declaration with a steady pumping of his hips.
Draco
Malfoy,
*****
"You have such a poetic way with words," he replied sarcastically, in good humour. He released Draco and took an unsteady step backwards. "Have you ever considered writing professionally?"
After all, a private gathering of pure-bloods was one thing... Going to the place where almost half of Wizarding London (and then some) worked was entirely another. But he was determined to show Potter he could handle it, at least to some degree. Real men don't want other men who acted like cowards, after all.
"Actually, the chips are a bit lackluster... But this fish is rather delectable. I wonder what batter is used?"
Draco shook his head slowly and turned away from Harry. One hand slipped over his mouth as his brows furrowed deeply and his frown became an anxious grimace. His breathing increased and his eyes stung with unshed tears. He shook his head again.
Anyway, your mum sent me the glass you drank from the night you started acting queer and it came back positive for an Amortentia subtype. I'm working on a list of suspects now.
"Now this is something I could get used to," he grinned, looking Draco over appreciatively (his bare arse hanging out with a little string bow over it was both comical and weirdly hot).
"You look good with your prick in my hand, Draco," he drawled, voice low and gravely. He felt vaguely embarrassed saying it but Draco's tiny gasp of response was plenty motivational.
Draco hissed, fiercely torn between charging the bastard and fixing his fur.
Answering his own question, he rolled his hips to slide his prick against Draco's, aided by the slickness of his spit.
"Just sad then?" Potter asked, stroking two fingers down Draco's spine, making him shiver. He inclined his head in a slight nod. "Hermione will figure it out," Potter replied reassuringly, endlessly confident. "You'll be back to your grumpy, not-at-all-cuddly self in no time."
He stood up suddenly.

Harry noted the hand in Draco's lap. He shook his head as Draco began to touch himself through his trousers. He mouthed the word 'evil' before returning his attention to the tailor, who had him hold his arms out and spread his legs a few inches. Gieves pulled out a measuring tape that was obviously charmed to work on its own (much like at Madame Malkin's) while the man took notes.
It was heavenly.
Dear Harry Potter,
Only once they'd arrived and the door was firmly shut and locked did Draco's arms fall and the blonde finally began to unbutton his large coat. Beneath he wore a nearly skin-tight, short-sleeved, half-zip shirt and a pair of brown trousers. The knee-length white boots he had at the wedding were now black (or he had an exact copy in black) and seemed to make him look taller, or at least make his calves look longer. He sighed and clapped his hands together.
Dear Malfoy,
"Checking for weapons, Potter?" Malfoy asked sarcastically.
Given the unusual way this conversation came about, I am trying really hard to shake the sensation of fate; a) because I hate it, and b) because I don't want to scare you away.
"So impatient," he tsked, nipping Draco's bottom lip. "Remember 30 seconds ago when I said I was going to do this right? I meant that."
Malfoy watched him expectantly.
Harry ran straight up to Draco so he could see his face (and read whatever subtle nuances might be there). He held his wand at his side--ready in case he needed it but hopefully not too threatening if he didn't. Draco's casual pose and attitude suggested that he wasn't the one who'd left the traps, though if he really was a master actor, such artifice wouldn't be difficult to pull off.
He tiled his head and arched a brow.
Back muscles screaming with strain, he used his arms to pull Draco down hard on him with each thrust up. Draco gasped deliciously.
"The place looks good," he commented vaguely. "As do you. Nice hair."
He sighed heavily. Malfoy may not have cost him his job--yet--but he was about to cost him his pride.
He released the breath he'd been holding several second later when the group walked on in the other direction. His senses remained finely turned for threat, however.

Unless the new heir agrees to sign his rights over to you, Harry James Potter, you will be made to vacate the premises and surrender the aforementioned properties within 30 days of your receipt of this owl.
Your Secret Santa
Spluttering and disoriented, Harry stumbled out of his sleeping bag and drew his wand on an unseen assailant.
“A man could get used to you in this position, Potter,” Malfoy drawled from somewhere above him.
*****
"Yes, please!" Harry said emphatically, looping his arms around Draco's neck and giving him another sound snog.

He attempted to slither and found himself hampered by four skittering limbs.
"Before we're done today?" Draco asked, wondering exactly what Harry meant (today or at all?)
"Oi, Malfoy!" Ron shouted through the aluminum, sounding none too pleased. "Trousers up! I told you the next time I see that lily-white arse of yours against my will, I'm hexing first, asking questions second. Harry, you and I will be having words later."
******
A cry was wrenched from his lungs as his joints snapped into place--shoulders, elbows, ankles, and knees; knuckles, writs, and jaw--all at the same time, excruciatingly. His fur receded, teeth and nails flattened and dulled. His stomach threatened to unload its contents but he forced them down.

"We are going home," Andromeda announced, chiding. "But first you will apologize to Harry for ruining his cake, Kreacher for making a mess of the kitchen, and Draco for carrying on in a way most unbecoming."
The buzzing of Harry's wand woke him up the next morning as the sun's first rays pierced the sky. He had trouble locating it in his disorientation. Waking up in Draco's bed was confusing enough--although the hot human blanket twined around him had become comfortingly familiar. Remembering that his wand had been carelessly tossed in a laundry hamper the night before took his sluggish brain several seconds to accomplish.
"Mm," he murmured through a sigh. "Who knew I was bent? Everyone, of course. Not like I ever hid it."
A matching smile spread across Harry's face. "Gladly," he said, quiet and sincere, before shucking his trousers and pants and crawling over Draco to kiss him soundly.
Heart thumping wildly, Harry conjured a generous amount of lube into Draco's waiting palm.
No, it wouldn't.
"... Harry?" Draco asked carefully as he moved to hug himself loosely. "You... All right?"
Malfoy waited unobtrusively as he did a visual sweep of the grand entryway (noting points of egress, potential hazards, and which antique furniture would provide the best cover...because old habits die hard).
Harry snorted and picked up his own menu for perusal. "Your life is so hard," he replied sarcastically.
*****
I have no idea what she put in it and I can't get a hold of her now. There may be some special Granger meddling involved... That or she knows I'll yell at her.
Draco sat back on his haunches. "Oh, that's right," he said, "you wouldn't have known. Father was able to keep it out of the papers, but my mother lives in France now. I thought she was just on a long leave, but alas parents are separated and on the way to divorce. Which isn't to say they aren't friendly. Father even greeted her with a hug and they enjoyed a long tea time together upon her arrival. I don't know the reason for their separation and I only just discovered the news of the divorce myself, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact my father and I have more in common than our coloration and regrettable past behaviour," Draco shrugged as he paused in his explanation to take a much needed breath. "I always suspected Father had something of a crush on Severus... When he was still part of the council he would use that authority to visit the school after hours on the pretense of meetings with my Godfather for one 'official' thing or another. That, and he had taken a fancy to a retired Quidditch player who looks almost exactly like the man. It wasn't until Severus died that Father finally woke from his insanity."
"Hey, Pans... Got a minute?"
become terribly offended and leave in a huff, but that didn't seem very likely), Harry touched his tongue to his bottom lip to moisten it and said, "Actually, if you're willing," he paused to swallow and steel his resolve, "I'd like to watch you pleasure yourself. With your fingers," he added, since that hadn't been clear.
*****
The soufflé was surpassingly good, cementing the idea that Harry was good at literally everything he cared to try, but with the addition of the ice cream Draco's senses were treated to a novel delight.
“What is this, Potter?” he said in wonder, craning his neck to actually look Harry in the eye. Spots of colour highlighted his sharp cheekbones and his whole face was flushed with pleasure (rather making him resemble one of the figures in the room’s artwork, where it not for the leanness of his face).
You won't have to bother with my clothes--I won't be wearing any.
Draco's mouth formed a small "oh" of surprise as Harry fell to his knees. One hand instantly went to land on the drowned mass that was his hair, the tendrils of which seemed to curl about his fingers. His other hand braced the wall as he bent forward over the Auror. The first lips on cock contact he ever had was surprisingly electric, sending a shiver down his spine that ended just at the base of his shaft.
*****
"You're so fucking sexy when you come," he rasped, still tugging Draco's softening prick. "Hell yes I was determined. I'm determined to do it again as soon as you're ready."
," he groaned, the words long drawn out.
Draco leaned his elbow into the arm of the couch and then placed his cheek into his open palm. He frowned softly at Potter.
Malfoy kept his promise.
Ron rubbed his neck until it turned pink.
Let me make sure I am understanding you correctly--
He mused bitterly over just how many galleons Malfoy must have been paid for the tip, the afternoon's idle fantasies turning to ash on the spot.
classy.)
"Yes, like a tiger," Draco irritably snapped. "And you can check your tone or vacate the bed."
Harry chuckled. "I picked up for you. You should be flattered."
"Tell me something only Potter knows, then," Draco demanded, still tense in his stance as he stared coldly at the Auror. The soft laughter and playful lust once open for display in his eyes was gone.
******
Harry got himself ready in record time. He didn't know how much leisure constituted 'a bit,' but he didn't want to waste one minute of it--he had an agenda (and books and cards were not on it).
Draco blinked. "... A greasy newspaper cone? Why would anyone eat anything out of a newspaper cone?" He didn't mention he hadn't even had chips before, though he knew of them, of course. "Especially a greasy one."
Forgive me, but that sounds almost too easy.
“It is not without complication,” Malfoy countered, tucking both hands into his sleeves, a plaintive look on his face. “She keeps pestering me to see my work. I told her I destroyed them all in a fit of pique but now she is insisting I begin painting again to build up my strength."
Or anyone, really.
It sounded stupid even to his ears and he received instant confirmation of that notion when Hermione's eyes bulged nearly out of her skull.
Draco stared at Potter for a long moment as he considered the request (demand?) with trepidation. It wasn't just the attack itself that made him nervous about entering the memory with the Auror; there was something in there that he was certain would screw up whatever tentative association was forming between them.
It was so powerful it left him lightheaded, with his face tingling and spots dancing before his eyes. "Holy

The Manor was different than Harry remembered it. Still cavernous. Cold. Absolutely dripping with valuables. (There was enough gold in the fixtures alone to make a dragon jealous.) But where it had been library-quiet the few times Harry had visited in the past, an almost perfect silence permeated it now. And if he wasn't mistaken, several portraits were missing from the walls.
Draco watched as Harry licked Draco's semen from his fingers, smirking at the happy grin on his face.
Harry,
"Come with me," he directed, nodding toward the basin. "Two pairs of eyes are better than one and it will be helpful for the memory to be fresh in your mind if I have any follow-up questions for you. I have a calming draught in my desk if you need," he added as an afterthought.
******
"Tell me what you want me to do. I know what you want, but I like it when you boss me around... which is a surprise, considering I usually hate that from other people."
like being pushed! When we're being playful is one thing, but that didn't feel playful and you have not put me in any sort of mood to joke.
Draco took a long sip of his tea, nearly burning his tongue in the process (but his nerves were so shot he hardly noticed.) He grinned at Potter and held his tea out to him indicating he should hold it. Once it was taken did he have both hands free to dig into his paper bag for the treat.
He slipped his fork into his mouth and sucked on it as his gaze stayed locked with Potter's. He let his tongue flick off the prongs. "My point is... I'm glad I didn't just get off on anyone when the opportunity presented itself, but I'm also no prude. I want to fuck you, but I'm willing to wait. Good thing we can explore and play in the meantime!"
, Harry thought, a frisson of excitement running up his spine and making his fingertips tingle. But the firecall was apparently an unpleasant one, if the pinched lines around Draco's smile were any indication. He didn't seem to want to talk about it, though, so Harry let it go for now. He filed the information away for later, however.
*****
Filtering out the sensory noise as best he could, he cautiously poked his head out and saw what he'd expected--Potter was indeed wanking.
******
"I took a blasting curse to the upper leg, losing sixty percent of it in the initial wounding and another five in the healing process," he said clinically. "Honestly, it was miracle I didn't lose the entire thing. But my days of running, jumping, and dodging curses are over."
Draco
Draco laughed despite himself and decided he was quite all right with the events of the day for bringing him there. Difficult as it was to believe.
For once.
The Slytherin's playfulness turned into challenge as he stared down the inch or so below at Potter's annoyed features. Something seemed to flash behind the silver of his eyes, coupled with a smug smirk reminiscent of their childhood days.
******
Oh calm down, Malfoy. She works in Records. We have a standing meeting on Wednesdays so she can show me everything I mis-filed or filled out wrong. (I keep trying to tell Robards it would save the Ministry both dollars and man hours if they'd just hire someone to do my paperwork for me; he's yet to see reason.)
Draco closed his eye again and returned to his impersonation of a limp doll.
...The black market sex industry is truly disturbing.
*****
He was considerate to have started with just one, but it was an unnecessary kindness.
“Oh.” Malfoy‘s face fell. “I left it in my room,” he almost mumbled (if any of the Pureblood’s utterances could ever truly be described as a mumble, what with his usually precise elocution). “I’ll have to go get it.”
Adoption is a long process, but I am not in a hurry. Like you, I wish to embark on that journey with a partner (a husband, more specifically) and preferably not while my job carries such a high level of risk. So it is a few years down the line, I'm sure.
"I wouldn't mind letting you keep doing what you're doing," he drawled in answer, sluggish from a long day, a full belly, and the warm night air. (Also the skilled hands on his prick--those were pretty great.) But he knew that he'd want to go to sleep as soon as he came, which meant Draco had to go first. He slid backwards until he had room to open Draco's trousers, which he did with haste.
Malfoy took his sweet time sidling up next to him, selecting a knife, and making his first precise cut. Harry waited until he got into something of a rhythm and had a nice little pile of carrot slices forming before leaning over to whisper in his ear, voice husky and commanding, "Put them in the skillet when you're done."
Harry half-led, half-carried Draco to the bathroom down the hall, where the sound of a piano drifted out the open door.
They would be
"'A little' is my least favourite amount of touching, you bloody tease," he complained, but Draco's wicked hand won out. He leaned into the seat back and widened his knees as his prick began to swell in response to the relentless stroking. His ears strained to listen for approaching footsteps lest their busty server get an eyeful when she returned with dessert.
Malfoy, for his part, appeared transfixed by the brilliant Lumos—the light it cast so blinding, even the rosy-cheeked cherubs in the room’s paintings had taken cover lest it singe their golden eyebrows.
Before anyone could snap at the red-head, especially Harry, Draco planted a hand on his lover's shoulder and replied, "You are well deserved of such a jab, and perhaps you're right. But this dinner isn't about the past... It's about creating something better for the future. You don't have to like me, but at leat save the insults for when we aren't about to sit down for dinner, please."

I am not allowed to work with any potentially dangerous ingredients, which is nearly all of them. Even such basic ones as frog's eyes are off-limits because they are poisonous (or can be depending on the species). Not to mention they took my wand and I am forbidden from casting spells with a replacement. It turns out house arrest really isn't much fun at all.
Dear Shrew-Who-Used-To-Be-My-Best-Friend,
Hoisting Draco's hips so he would have more access and using the hand that was already lubed, he rubbed the pads of his index and middle fingers over Draco's slick, winking pucker.
"Draco," he implored breathlessly, "if you don't stop, I'll come..."
(It is not
Draco seemed to he doing his best to live up to his threat to suck Harry's prick off. The blowjob was a bit toothy for his liking, but otherwise good.
Three orgasms seemed to be his limit.
I like it.
The barest hint of hard-earned pride in Malfoy’s tone warmed an answering feeling in Harry. "That’s brilliant!" he beamed. “It’s a right clever lie.”
Only one thing was certain: he owed Malfoy an apology.
Draco rolled his eyes and let Harry's arse go to dig his heels and the balls of his hands into the mattress. They were still hanging off the edge of his bed, which made leverage a little tougher but Draco succeeded all the same as he pushed himself along the bed--wriggling his hips and bucking off to dislodge Harry in the process- until he was sitting, knees up, in the middle of the bed.
Harry needed a new best mate, he decided irritably as he stomped downstairs to Gladys's lair. Maybe Seamus was available. He was always good for a laugh and would do almost anything on a dare...including snogging Harry once, but they were both completely pissed at the time. (Harry only knew it had happened because Dean would never let either of them forget it; fortunately, what happens between Gryffindors stays between Gryffindors).
"Look," Draco straightened up in his seat and offered Potter a sad, but soft smile, "I appreciate what you're trying to do, but defending me is only going to make your life harder. Those 'rubbish publications', random dark anything, and anyone from Wizarding London--including the possibility of your own friends--will turn, bite harder, and make your life a virtual hell because you stood up for me. The time you did... before... people saw it as forgiving and heroic, but this time they will suspect favoritism through deep pockets."
As for kids, what can I say? I love children. I grew up without siblings or much family at all, and despite their financial struggles, being with the Weasleys made me happy. But I don't necessarily need to be their biological father either. I have Teddy to satisfy for now; as for my own kids, I'd like a girl and a boy at least. A big family has always been appealing to me since my own lackluster childhood.
~Harry
Thus settled, they made their way down the cobbled street and into the brightly lit ice cream shop. There was a family ahead of them deliberating over flavours in the glass-paneled freezer box. The shopgirl's hazel eyes widened when she noticed the two of them waiting in the queue. She was young--maybe 18--skinny, with a nose ring and several studs in her ears and a shock of violet running through her otherwise black hair. She took in their casual proximity and a genuine smile broke out over her features before she returned her attention to the family's patriarch as he began placing orders.
For whatever it's worth, I do not trust that David. He's got crazy eyes. If you hold my opinion in
Dear Harry,
Harry suppressed a sigh. It was his fault, he supposed. Draco'd been in a right sunny mood when he arrived. But he was bloody hungry. It wasn't fair to hold him accountable for things said and done when he was running on biscuits and tea fumes.
A loop for binding, a figure-eight for permanence, and a harsh slash for the anger he poured into the fibers of ropes that didn't yet exist. (Not exactly Ministry-approved, that one.) With a grim smile, he finished off the spell just as Parkinson broke through.
He babbled senseless encouragement through it ("Yesss...so good...Draco...Godrick") and slowed his thrusting when Draco was finished, unsure how he would feel about continuing after coming.
Are you in Slytherin then? Your sentiment and optimism says no, but I can't see someone from another house being so supportive of a former Death Eater. Well, unless you're a Hufflepuff. Fairly forgiving lot, those.
"I didn't realize you made house calls, Potter," he drawled, pulling a silvery housecoat closed about his chest. Harry took in his uncharacteristic state of dishevelment, albeit mild, and deduced he’d been awakened from a nap (serves him right, he thought). "That would've saved me a great deal of hassle.”

Harry released Draco's wrists with one hand while maintaining his hold with the other and rolled to the side so he was straddling Draco's thigh.
"Who says they're about you?" Draco asked, mainly to be a brat. "Kind of presumptuous, don't you think?"
Draco quirked a brow at the Auror shaking with need below him. His grin had fallen to a surprised frown.
It was unrealistic to think that she could translate enough to begin developing an antidote that evening so the ask was not unreasonable. But still, it made him uneasy. Not that he doubted Granger's word.
If you have any further questions please contact the Ministry at the Department of Inheritance.
Hermione would forgive them. Eventually.

"Oh come on, Draco," Harry exclaimed, incredulous. "I know you grew up under a rock but you had to have had curly fries before!"
In good news, there are still more "Love and Letters" to come. There's about 20 stuck on Playout's phone that would take a millennia to manually remove (we did it over text) so if we can ever get those there will be even MORE than what is already coming to enjoy later~ I, in particular, have wanted to reread them for some time (we did a LOT of super fun, interesting ones I loved) and I bother her about it at least once every other month. xD
Draco thrust his fingers into Harry's mouth gently, letting Harry do most of the work. His other hand pressed into Harry's hip. Once his fingers were wet enough, Draco pulled them slowly away from the Auror's mouth and slipped them back down toward his hole.
"You're pretty great," he mumbled into Draco's heated skin, feeling like one lucky SOB.
*****
******
likely to believe me if you knew who I was, I'm afraid. Hence the letters. Suffice it to say, I am not a Slytherin.
"I know I look great, Harry," Draco rolled his eyes. "It's impossible for me not too. I just..."
He smiled when he noticed Draco. "I won't breathe a word of this to anyone," he promised.
Draco held out one of his long, pale hands with a slow sigh. It was more of his need for an anchor versus the usual affection.
*****
You are dead to me. And not like the last time I said it when you were able to reclaim my affections with your sincere and heartfelt apologies (ten dozen roses, a case of champagne, and an all expenses paid holiday at the Swiss chalet). I mean it this time. Blaise is my new official best friend. I hope you're happy.
Growing up the way I did, people think I was spoilt--and I was, rather a lot. But that came with strict rules of etiquette. My summers were generally spent with tutors (one of whom had the gall to smack my fingers with a ruler whenever my lines were anything less than perfect) or learning proper pure-blood traditions from my parents. Even my meals were regulated lest I become "fat"(though Mother snuck me treats at school). Dance (both ballroom and ballet), foreign languages, comportment, manipulation (tears are something to hide unless fake; real tears mean weakness), homework of course must always come first, family history, wizarding history, etc. I barely had any time for friends. But quite the opposite of feeling like a freak, I felt like a prince being prepared for his throne.
A yelp of surprise was all he had time for just before he was pulled into the most intense snog of his life. His hands instantly moved to grip the Auror's hip and around his waist--one hand digging underneath Potter's dress robes in order to grab at and loosen the starched top underneath, pulling it from the tight band of his trousers.
if you want to have a significant other. So that goal is dead in the water.
"Do you want to take this inside?" he asked breathlessly, grinding his prick against Draco's and reveling in the feel of him rapidly swelling to hardness.
It was time for a N.E.W.T.-level tactic.
*****
for worse," Harry agreed ruefully.
******
******
He squirmed his way out of his robes and twisted his over-long spine to inspect himself and was met with a sight that chilled his blood--
It is entirely none of your concern, but my relationship with Blaise has been purely platonic since fifth year...with the exception of a handful of incidents that fall under the "never to be discussed" policy. (See above.)
Malfoy returned several minutes later to find Harry pacing a hole in the floor (he’d lasted all of 30 seconds sitting down).
Harry hastily looked away, gulping nervously. Malfoy seemed totally oblivious to the show he was putting on (and the effect it was having on him).
Harry was not known for his patience. Or following directions, usually, but he could support these ones wholeheartedly. He re-positioned them with Draco closer to the edge of the chaise and stood over him, half kneeling on the cushion with the other foot planted firmly on the ground. He conjured a bit of lube, caught and held Draco's eager eyes, and rubbed the slick head of his prick over Draco's furrowed hole.
He wasn't thinking all that clearly now.
Harry wanted to intervene but he knew it wasn't his place. He just hated seeing his godson looking so downtrodden. "Can I pack some food for you, at least?" he asked Andromeda, surveying the veritable feast Molly had prepared. All his favourites were there, arranged buffet-style on the kitchen island, steaming under warming charms or chilled under cooling ones. He stomach rumbled hungrily. It could have been such a nice surprise party, if only he'd known about it ahead of time.
"I meant that If you sensed a problem in your relationship or if Draco himself was pulling away, would you fix it or try to regain his attentions? If you broke up over something petty, would you try to make it right?" Lucius almost seemed to speak directly from experience with that. "Love is not nearly enough, and you don't have even that yet."
"As for position," he began with a thoughtful hum and a grin that could rival the Cheshire Cat's, "Lay on your back with your hands above your head. And remember that you trust me now, or at least I hope you do."
pillow.” The decorative cushion obliged, soaring straight to Malfoy, who caught it deftly in his left hand.
he scolded himself sternly.
"Bollocks," Harry scoffed, fingering the edge of Draco's mask before untying the satin ribbon that held it in place. "It was completely sincere and you know it." He smirked into Draco's pale, pretty eyes (what right did he have to have lashes that thick and long? Harry'd never noticed before because their colour was so light they were hard to see from a distance). "But if you need more convincing," he purred, cupping Draco's cheek and sliding his hand around to the back of his head to pull him down until their lips nearly touched, "I can give you more convincing."
Harry
Harry was vaguely offended at Malfoy calling him weak and scrawny earlier. He was small, sure, but he wasn't weak. Malfoy had been able to disarm his attacker so easily because the person moved with the characteristic lack of coordination of someone with a drastically different body type than the polyjuiced individual. If Harry had to guess, he'd say the assailant was a tall, broad, and burly male. He also knew Malfoy very well, or had paid off someone who did, given that he knew where Malfoy's unexpected interests laid.
*****
Harry hadn't realized what Malfoy meant to do in the space, although in retrospect, it made sense that he hadn't brought him there for tea and crumpets. Too bad. Harry's stomach gave a dejected rumble that for once Malfoy didn't seem to hear. (Small blessing, that.) He couldn’t recall how long it had been since his last proper meal.
"Oh," Harry blinked. That had been unexpected. "Well. Yes, that would be helpful, thank you," he replied, somewhat stilted.
*****
Harry went through the motions of making tea while he struggled to process this information and figure out just what he was going to do about it. It would be a lie to say he wasn't interested, but he wasn't entirely comfortable with that interest, either. And who knew how Malfoy would feel about everything once the potion wore off.
Draco's muzzle wrinkled in distaste. In his opinion, the only thing those awful trousers had going for them was the fact they sat low on Potter's hips, thereby displaying the lovely musculature of his lower abdomen. Daily flying was fantastic exercise, apparently. Perhaps he ought to take it up again. They could--
Well...maybe he was.
You fancied me? I had no idea! You never let on. Knowing that might have solved a few things...
Hermione
He jogged up the stairs and knocked on the door of the loo. "Draco? Hermione and Ron are here."
Malfoy's wiry muscles shifted and flexed beneath his painted-on shirt as he went though the motions of withdrawing the memory. Harry tried focusing on his face, which remained serene even through the intense concentration needed to perform the spell. The only other person he'd ever seen remove a memory with that much finesse was Dumbledore. He was reluctantly impressed.
even when bottoming: Potter was doing most of the work, but
The good news is, you'll be back to yourself in no time!
Draco grinned. "Oh, I will be, undoubtedly," he admitted easily. "But not half as much as you, I think. Especially not after what I plan to do to you later." His silken tone was filled with promise and his heavy-lidded eyes hinted at just what kind.
"Sorry about that nasty business, gentlemen," the girl apologized sympathetically, surprisingly formal in her diction given the way she looked. "Do you know what you want or would you like to try some samples? The chocolate maple bacon is quite good, actually." The last was directed at Draco.
"You won't get anything more out of me," Harry vowed, levelly as he could manage, clenching his hands at his sides. "No matter how long you sit there staring. So you can see yourself out or wait for an escort from Security, who I am going to summon now."
Unfortunately for the surprisingly eager Harry, Draco was satisfied by leaving the man's neck bruised with love bites. With one hand he held his cone, and with the other he briefly cupped and pressed into Harry's growing erection... Just before letting go and turning to walk away--attention once again on his food. He quickly ate the remainder of his fish.
Harry took a moment to clear his mind of all potentially-incriminating images. Just in case.
*****
"You're ridiculous," Harry said affectionately to his rumpled boyfriend, bending down to kiss him good morning (or, more likely, goodnight, since there was no way he'd be staying up).
Harry approached Malfoy’s wand arm from the side—it was never wise to stand directly in front of another caster’s wand—and gingerly cupped the back of his hand with his own to steady it. Using his left foot, he nudged Malfoy’s trainers to hip-width apart for better stability (wizards often overlooked the foundations of good spellwork, in Harry’s opinion—particularly those, like Malfoy, who were naturally gifted casters). Malfoy was tense as a coiled spring. Harry thought he might actually be holding his breath, so he hastened to correct the awkward grip on the wand rather than risk the man passing out on him. The moment the fingers of his left hand touched Malfoy’s, however, something peculiar occurred.
Why did the two of you "take a break" and then not get back together?
"M-Merlin... Fuck, nnn..."
She would have figured it out the moment she laid eyes on him and probably been halfway to developing a reversal potion by now.
But then it rolled through his head again and it didn't seem quite so ridiculous the second time. At least not compared to all of Malfoy's absurdity.
"We can explore after if you like," he added, indicating the street Harry was busy observing (whether for the sheer novelty of it or signs of possible danger, Draco wasn't sure). "If we have time." It was already nightfall.
"The fact that I can't apparate us from here, unlike other Level 7 employees," Draco replied with a chuckle even as he dragged Potter towards his office floo (after grabbing their wands.) The flames came to life in the same instant that Draco pressed Potter up against the old brick mantel and returned his biting kisses.

"Really? That's it? You don't remember how to feed yourself? I knew I should start sending you lunches, and as punishment I shall send them with sappy notes that I hope all your colleagues read."
Harry grinned like a fool at Draco's sweet gesture and the suggestion of him shedding his clothes, but the smile melted into a pinched frown at what came next.

Draco's quip was delivered on a smile, indicating he was merely kidding. He kissed Harry's lips one last time.

"I know," he said, feeling inordinately proud of Draco for having come so far from the nasty, spoilt git he'd been groomed to be. Here he was on a fully muggle date--his fifth if Harry's math was right--and he was practically bouncing in his seat with his excitement. Harry experienced the swooping elation of spotting the snitch and held more tightly to Draco's hand.
"First of all..." His hands moved from Harry's deliciously toned rear to his waist again as he struggled for words between gulps of air. "First of all, kissing you is bloody
"I like this… I really do," he panted minutes later when he came up for air, "but if I don't eat right now, I might pass out. I haven't had anything today except four biscuits, two cups of tea, and a chocolate frog."
He thought of all the men Pansy had slept with and left the next day and realized she might not have been the best person to seek for advice. She wasn't exactly the committing sort (except when it came to the betrothal contract they shared, which would

What harm was there in a bit of flirting? Especially if, for all intents and purposes, they were strangers who would never see each other again. He licked his lips and took a step towards the man, who proceeded to walk right past him.
"And please feel free to leave the deadly plants off the menu," he quipped, taking up the soap once again. "It's too bad we didn't get to do what I had planned in the Garden Room, though I have faith that your plans will more than make up for it."

Once again, Harry was conflicted. (Draco had that effect on him.)
But it wasn't just any bloke. And it wasn't just fucking. It was Draco and it was his first time and he'd said he loved him and wanted to be made love to so Harry kissed him deeply and thrust gently, pouring all the emotion he felt for him into all of it.
Harry
Harry shook his head. Nothing could be easy with Draco.
Your words are quite kind, and I thank you for them (prank or otherwise), but unless you're willing to tell me who you are and speak them in person, I can't say I believe you.
Malfoy's hair was slicked back severely, as if he took comfort in exerting control over a part of him that still submitted entirely to his will (as opposed to, say, his wayward right hand, which trembled slightly at his side). Or perhaps it was a throwback to a simpler time. Or force of habit. Or maybe he just liked it that way. For his part, Harry didn't prefer it that way, but it wasn't
Harry's breath hitched. Thank Merlin Draco wasn't in a cruel mood. At least, no more than usual.
I didn't say "not completely natural." Merlin. These looks are 100% Malfoy. I just meant I have to watch what I eat and get my time in at the gym to maintain my figure--I don't have the metabolism of an adolescent any longer. More's the pity.
“We will be needing lunch for two this afternoon,” Malfoy stated. “Make it a hearty one, please.” (The fact it was phrased as a polite request wasn’t lost on Harry.)
I dare you to wear your hair loose all day tomorrow.

Are you free this evening?
"Easy there," Harry chuckled, extricating himself from Draco's grip to save his robes from stains. "You're inky as a squid."
"This will be a tremendous help to the investigation," he said reassuringly, passing the opaque bottle to Malfoy. "And I won't dillydally in your memory--we should only have to watch it once." Harry didn't have a perfect memory, but his mind did a good job of honing in on the relevant details and retaining them well enough to develop a good general picture of a crime scene.
Cheers,
"As you so astutely pointed out," he drawled eventually, "I don't get out much and I find myself wanting for good company of late." Here he paused to eye Harry critically. "I

Arthur was visibly shaken by the exchange. He sat heavily in the chair George had just vacated and pulled a handkerchief out of his coat pocket to dab at his brow. He responded lowly with words carefully chosen and precisely delivered, "
"Even without the long hair?" Draco asked playfully as Harry enjoyed his eye full, while still maintaining that delicious up and down motion. The blonde bit his lip as he stared back with lust evident in his eyes. That didn't stop him being an ass, however.
Potter held out his arms and attempted a pirouette that very nearly ended with a broken ankle. Fortunately, Draco's reflexes hadn't dulled in his years off the Pitch. "You'll have to work on your balance if you want to leave your desk at any point tomorrow," he critiqued, righting the heavier man and maintaining a grip on his forearm lest he stumble again. "Your steps must be light, your weight forward on the balls of your feet. It's different than stomping around in your boots or trainers.
He sat across from Draco--who'd either finished or binned the rest of his ice cream--and gave him a crooked smile. "We made it this far without being hexed. I consider that an achievement."
Draco gasped hotly as Harry suddenly began to swallow his cock. His pants had been tossed to the floor. It was another pleasant shock, having Harry eagerly eat his prick--his throat and mouth already constricting so perfectly on the sensitive length.

Harry propped himself up on his elbows to cock an incredulous brow at Draco. "
Harry felt an instinctive urge to clench and retreat from Draco's wandering fingers, but then he thought: if he was going to do this whole gay thing, he may as well do it right.
Harry couldn’t say how many minutes had passed before he finally acknowledged that he was neither as young, nor as energetic as he used to be and that he desperately needed a break. His days of abysmal sleep coupled with the magic fatigue of a night spent trying to break into Malfoy Manor had left him sorely depleted. Add to that Malfoy’s near maniacal attempts to cast every spell in his repertoire for the past who-know-how-long—which, while fun, meant Harry was now running entirely on fumes—and he

Harry signed his name with a flourish and floated the report to the top of the stack. The teetering pile was a testament to how hard he had worked to get everything finished before Draco whisked him away for an extended weekend of birthday debauchery. (He already knew what the present was and he was half-hard just thinking about it.) He needed to complete the last bit of paperwork, head home to pack an overnight bag, and then it would be off to the Manor for three days of sexual pampering. He couldn't wait!
I am not the hesitant one in this exchange. It is not a question of if I want this, but do you?
Draco nodded. "I wasn't going to let her through. No offense, but she hates you," he shrugged as he stood and gathered his dishes to set into the sink. The half full plate of dinner he left on the counter in case Harry was a stickler for saving rather than wasting any food.

tools I like?" There was something in the way he grinned and quirked his brow even higher at that offer. It was a mix between evil and excited. "Well, luckily for you I have a number of useful tools."
Draco, trembling, sought for calm in his reply. "Yes, but... But full grown Devil's Snares aren't easy to come by," he answered as steadily as he could. "Especially not in this quantity. There are only three sources in the country, including your Longbottom, which makes me think the person who planted these must have acquired a pod. So we should expect between five and seven in total." He exhaled heavily, finding comfort in old facts, and shook his leg to rid his skin of the creepy-crawly feeling of the vine. "In other words, there could be at least a few more... And that's if they only had one pod."

Granger and Weasley were obvious even to me (before they knew it, I suspect). I agree that the word 'inevitable' applies. Good for them.
Harry marched up the marble steps of the Manor's entry, riding high on a wave of righteous indignation.
After long moments of hugging the man in his lap and trying to ignore the growing issue in his tight trousers, Draco regretfully pulled away and swallowed hard for air.
Draco gently pulled the door open, looking like a doctor ready to operate sans gloves. He smirked underneath his mask and quirked one fine brow as he approached. Once he arrived, he placed the briefcase on the bed.
Draco tolerated Potter's oppressive embrace until it was too hot and uncomfortable to bear...which was all of thirty seconds. If the man wanted cuddling, he should have held out for a bed--Merlin knows there were plenty of them in the Manor.
"Potter?" Malfoy repeated, a hint of something beneath the impatience in the word. Concern, maybe.
"Ah," Draco gasped at the odd feeling of Harry pulling out to his head again. His muscles immediately began to calm, though he could feel himself gaping somewhat from the progress Harry had made. Draco nodded again.
Harry couldn't help but to laugh.
He chuckled as he nibbled on a chicken chunk and licked the sauce from his lips.
"It's customary to stay when one has already arrived, of course. I may not attend these things so often anymore, but manners dictate I stay at least until the cutting of the cake. And I do enjoy cake. I deserve something sweet after all my evening's suffering!"
"Other than feeling extremely nauseous and off balance, I think I'm okay," Draco cringed at the bodies laid in his bedroom and shook like a leaf as he stood up slowly from the side of the bed. He hugged himself over his bare torso to try and steady his frayed nerves. "What did you do to them? That was
It can get pretty draughty in your office, so when I saw these gloves, I instantly thought of you. They're soft as butter and shouldn't hamper your dexterity too much. And they're elf made and the height of fashion. Or so I've been told. Honestly, I have no idea one way or another. But I think they'll look good on you.
Nothing too out of the ordinary, but for the first time in his life, despite having seen plenty of cocks before, Draco's mouth watered. He immediately pressed the flat of his tongue into the crevice between Harry's sac and straining manhood and licked a slow stripe upward until he could flick the tip over the opening slit.
Draco let the mask fall after the ribbon was pulled away. It made a dull sound on the floor as it hit the ground. The blonde wrapped his arms tight around Potter's waist and jerked him forward to plaster their torsos together, earning him a gasp. Draco smirked again.

"You! I will not pleasure my boyfriend while he eats," and yet despite that Draco pressed harder--sliding his foot up and down the growing bulge he felt under the Auror's old denims. "Mm... Either you like treacle tart a lot more than I thought or perhaps you're just faking your patience?"
He let go of Draco and stood back up in time to be pulled away by the insistent tailor once again.

Dear Harry Potter,
His flexibility was still quite good in spite of everything.
And I did not leave the country to avoid talking to you, twat. This holiday has been on my calendar for three months and you knew about it well in advance. You were probably plotting to help yourself to my belongings the moment I set foot out the door!
That flat-faced, dead-behind-the-eyes Ukranian has nothing to offer beyond his six-pack. You have terrible taste in men.
"Shower, then dinner, then I'm on top," he dictated haughtily after breaking away. He smirked down at his still-dazed partner who smiled up at him with unfocused eyes. "With you in the dress again," he stipulated.
After sucking the mark into being, he moved his mouth to Draco's ear. "You should know," he breathed across the shell, "I plan to know every inch of you before we're through."
I never tease.
You could be persuaded into how many? Boy or girl? Twins (one of each) would be nice, though a major handful. But with the right partner it's manageable, I think.
"'Ello, 'Arry," she said in her most flirtatious tone, which sounded cracked and oddly monotone. "Come ta see me again, yea? Is this a subtle way of lettin' a guhl know?"

"I want you to put a finger in me, Draco," he directed, almost shocked he'd managed to say it out loud. His stomach muscles jumped and spasmed when Draco lifted his head and fixed him with his liquid metal stare.
It was that those notes comprised nearly all of his life's work and what may very well be his greatest accomplishment as a potioneer. Not something he was eager to part with.
An update?! It's a Christmas miracle!

"Don't stop," he begged.
Now. I'm curious: Why aren't you an Auror? I had heard it was your dream job. Danger, excitement, adventure...though perhaps the paperwork, not so much.
Draco leaned close enough to Harry's back for his body heat to be felt, or at least to cause a frisson of energy between them (as the water was hot enough to disguise any additional warmth).
"How long 'til dinner?" he asked with clear intent.

"Come on," he said, dropping his quill and standing. "Let's go home."

"How embarrassing," Potter smirked. Draco fluffed himself up and chattered at him in annoyance.

"All right there, pet?" Potter simpered with mock-concern. Draco hissed, baring his claws, but it only made the prat chuckle harder. For that, Draco took a swipe at him when he went to collect him from the statue, deeply satisfied by the wounded yelp that followed.
It hadn't escaped his attention how Harry had referred to Grimmauld as "home" and not "my place", which caused an enigmatic smile to grace his features as Harry politely agreed with his suggestion, but chose not to comment on it in case it was a slip of tongue.
"Come on, up you get," he prodded his clinging paramour. "You went through all the trouble of making dinner. I don't want it to go to waste." He kissed to Draco on the tip of his (pointy) nose and helped him up off the ground. "We've got all night to 'talk about our feelings'," he grinned, making air quotes around his unsubtle innuendo.
“Is Master’s guest needing anything?” Bixby grated, looked as if it pained him to even ask.
On that particular Thursday, at least, the intrepid retorter had done wonders for Harry's productivity.

He wasn't considering anything romantic in the flowers and heart-shaped chocolates/boom-box-in-the-rain sense Janine probably had envisioned, but a grand gesture could be just the trick to finally getting through to Malfoy. He'd have an opportunity to put a chink in the man's notoriously impenetrable armour--one hopefully large enough to let him worm an apology through. Harry was reasonably sure that if said gesture involved his own discomfort, it stood a better chance of succeeding.
He was relieved to learn they had the place to themselves (except, probably, for house-elves; at least their lot tended not to be shocked by much). He was highly curious about the 'instruments of torture' Draco kept referencing--his imagination was supplying him with all sorts of sordid possibilities and he was eager to learn which, if any, best reflected reality.
Malfoy,
A wide grin nearly threatened, but Draco kept it at bay with great difficulty and a deep, discrete breath.
Though he had no idea what he would say or do, when had that ever stopped him?
*****
It was a good plan.
"You are racking up quite the tab with my clothes," Harry replied sardonically, "but, yes, while you're at it, a healing charm would be nice."
"Worship later," he countered, a pathetically needy whine to his voice. "Tonight. Tomorrow. I don't care. Just not right now." He interrupted himself with a pleasured grunt because he'd finally gotten his prick angled well enough to rut in the tight, hot space between Draco's inner thigh and his pelvis. If the devilish Slytherin tease would just stay still for 30 seconds, that would be enough for Harry, but he feared it was too much to hope for.
*****
That was when he noticed what was in Harry's hand: his wand. Held at the defensive, tight at his side. And he was giving Draco such an intense, pointed look that his befuddlement (fear and sadness) immediately morphed into rage.
He moved to the sofa and asked Draco to sit with him, racking his brain for the best way to tell a man that his supposed best friends were out to get him.
"I'm sure we'll think of something," Harry replied airily. He had a few things in mind already. "But let's move this party to somewhere more comfortable. I don't think shagging is what this table was designed for, in spite of its admirable--and memorable--performance."
What attempts?
He smiled with false-innocence as he curled his hands around the one Harry used to hold the sudsy oatmeal bar. He pecked Harry's wet lips and took the soap from him.
Draco thought with a chuckle.
With an evil cackle, he left the loo with book in hand. He held it behind his back so Potter wouldn't see it at first, but when he was close enough he produced the glossy novel and chuckled, "Nice tub-side reading, straight man."

"I think it's because I identified with Leopold," he answered truthfully (grinning internally at the somewhat mean way he was twisting the screws). "The lost prince raised as a pauper until he's suddenly burdened with ruling a kingdom that can't decide how it feels about him. I resonated with a lot of what he felt."

If you'll notice there are two packs. I bought one in order to try it for myself and after a single sip I was almost sick. What is so appealing about this swill? Besides the alcohol content.
Amidst the ensuing gasps and swears, streamers and confetti, Ron's patronus dashed through the wall to alert the partygoers--Harry's nearest and dearest all--that he was nowhere to be found and might arrive any minute.
Panic threatened once again but Harry stomped it out.
Dear Harry Potter,
As soon as Draco stepped through the floo his facade of superiority and haughty grace fell to the floor in exchange for a long yawn (which he hid behind a hand
But seriously, what are the odds?
"Just relax, I've got you."

"I believe this is the start to a beautiful partnership," he declared.
Harry was sure he knew why. He'd done the same at Grimmauld Place, after all. Stairs were still a right pain for him even with modifications and practice. The Manor probably had enough of the ruddy things to rival Hogwarts.
Draco shook his head, turned off the water, and turned to Harry.
Harry chuckled at Draco's keen insight, relaxing in the face of the barrage of mostly harmless questions. "She did hyphenate," he answered smoothly. "Granger-Weasley. And she thought about going into Magical Creatures but decided she'd have a greater platform for real change if she got onto the Wizengamot herself someday."
Harry
Won't you send me something of yours I could hold close to my heart? Preferably imbued with your intoxicatingly masculine scent.

Draco nudged his foot surreptitiously and Harry bit his tongue on the next scathing comment. By the chastened expression on Ron's face, Hermione must have done something similar.
If having good taste makes me a ponce then I will take that as a compliment, thank you.

'!" He threw his hands up as if in a prayer for patience. "You've literally been banging down my door to speak to me for hours and the best you can come up with is 'hullo'?! The tabloids are right, Potter--you're barking mad!"
"... I had forgotten about that, you know," he began as he took his wand and began to unlock his door. "I've been rather adept at Occlumency since I was very young. Father demanded it. Anything I didn't want to remember, like nightmares, I would put away. Including certain incidents I couldn't handle thinking about when I was 12. Blaise had just turned 13 and had spent a month at the Manor while his mother was off on yet another honey moon. It was fun, at first, but that was when he began to pester me about fucking him. Or blowing him off. I didn't take it seriously, until he pulled that bullshit. I had him sent away claiming illness afterward."
That was probably the most reasonable Harry had ever heard Lucius. Coupled with the presumptuous arse's newly relaxed (read: no longer threatening) posture, it was enough to coax a reply from Harry, though not the one Lucius sought.
Your father's story I know from several sources, including memories left behind with Dumbledore. My godfather allowed me access to them during his time as Headmaster and told me a few directly. At least the man changed into someone worthy of you and your mother before it was too late. I am sorry you never had a chance to know him--the world is cruel and unfair.
Oh well. He still liked the man (against his better judgment). Sex wasn't the only thing he was interested in. And this revelation took a lot of pressure off so--
Harry'd lost his appetite--the tight knot in his stomach precluded the enjoyment of food at the moment--but the shopgirl's pleasant demeanor was helping to subdue his ire. Seriously, though, the guy can't go on a fucking date in this town without expecting the good possibility of a fight? It was infuriating.
"And I don't do revenge," he added, growing serious. "I've seen where it leads."

"Not that I mind the view--because I really don't--but I've got clean pyjamas up in my room that you probably missed in your search for clothes, if you want them," he offered.
You're the seeker? No offense, but you're not a "celebrity". How are you playing in this? Unless you kind of decided you have the right to or something, like you did in school. Not that I'm opposed to seeing you in Quidditch leathers again.
7:00 is fine.
"You are exactly as horrible as I would expect a Slytherin to be," he retorted, waving his empty fork accusingly. "Bite stealing cock tease."
He steeled himself with an indrawn breath. There was no time like the present.
Harry slid his hands from his pockets and hung them loosely by his sides. He tried his best to keep his stance and gaze relaxed as he watched what he could of Draco's ministrations and those long, elegant fingers curled around his zip.

Harry was relieved to see a walk-in shower (big enough for five adults to use comfortably) in addition to the enormous clawfoot tub he would have seriously struggled getting into and out of.
Harry immediately regretted his phrasing. It was thoughtless and harsh. He really should've eaten something before coming over, he didn't make good decisions on an empty stomach.
Oh well. It is in the past now. I am assuming you mentioned it in order to say you might fancy me again? If so, you should know that the feeling is very much mutual.

Harry didn't have time to celebrate. The reporter was tripping over himself in his haste to reach them, quill in hand.
He only had eyes for Draco's cock, half hard and laying heavily against his thigh. Merlin, it was a thing of beauty. He licked his lips eagerly and reached for the prize.

Dear Malfoy,
He smoothed his hands over Draco's thighs, waiting for him to come down from his high so they could talk. When Draco, panting heavily, finally lifted his head and looked at him again (pupils blown wide and eyes unfocused), Harry, grinning, smeared two fingers through the come on his belly and brought them to his mouth for a taste.

Draco curtsied dramatically, since he had been the follower, with a light-hearted roll of his eyes.
"How many fingers do you want?"
"Look," he said, measuring his tone, "I know you don't like me and you'd probably rather be anywhere but here, but I'm trying, ok? If it's that bloody miserable for you to have to be in the same room as me, I can refer you to someone else."
Harry joined Draco at the table, unfolding his napkin and placing it in his lap and tucking into his meal enthusiastically.
At any rate, he'd gone straight from work on Friday and spent the better part of the evening trying various ploys to be invited into the sprawling residence, to no avail. Malfoy house-elves were as tough as Gringotts goblins were security was concerned and the man of the house had remained stubbornly absent. The grumpy elf Harry met the day he'd cocked everything up popped over to check on him periodically but seemed content to sneer in response to his heartfelt requests for a brief audience with Malfoy (ostensibly reporting back to him about Harry's whereabouts).

Thanks anyway.
Oh. In that case, I'll see you Friday. And I hope you're mum won't be home. And I may or may not be wearing pants.
"Did you know they have bacon flavors now?" Draco pointed to the sign to bring Harry's attention back to the joys of ice cream. "Chocolate maple bacon, orange bacon, and syrup and bacon. I think we should stick to something more basic today, but I had no idea bacon was such a popular flavor."
Draco turned back in time to catch Potter using his infamous grin, the one Draco was very familiar with but had never been given the pleasure of being the recipient of. He smirked down at the hopeful ravenette and sighed with a slight shake of his head.
"I'm getting the lava cake," he declared, adding his menus to Draco's pile. "A la mode. And I'm going to eat protein and veg as a formality first because you aren't supposed to live on sugar alone." He raised a pointed brow.

Draco lifted his menu (just realizing the two men from before were blushing now, after a quick glance) and set about deciding his order. He quirked a brow as he eyed a chicken dish with mushroom sauce.
Potter remained unmoving, expression soft and kind, putting the ferret part of Draco at ease. Perhaps he'd learned that trick from the Groundskeeper. Warily, Draco extended a paw towards him and held it there.

Fortunately, he was pretty good at ignoring intimidation (he'd had practice). Encouraged by Draco's breathless, sultry urging, he wrapped his hand around the hard length and noted its similarities and differences to his own. It was hot, smooth, and had a nice weight to it. He began to tug with the long, easy strokes he preferred at first and watched Draco closely for his reactions.
Draco had expected Harry to simply keep thrusting or to continue on once Draco was laid back, but having his hole tasted (though extremely pleasant) was a huge surprise. He let his head fall to the pillows (after attempting a look) with a loud gasp.

Unobtrusive classical music was pumped in through hidden speakers, setting the atmosphere for the evening's entertainment. Art in an assortment of styles lined walls. A young woman took their tickets and escorted them to the box--very near the stage, two stories up. The legroom left something to be desired (especially for Draco), but the velvet seats were otherwise comfortable, the view was good, and their privacy was assured, which Harry appreciated most of all.
Draco was only half-listening. The entire walk down the street Harry hadn't really held his hand. Sure, their hands were connected, but Harry's grip was loose and almost board-like. Draco had squeezed and in exchange Harry twitched. Apparently he didn't like holding hands. Draco's Malfoy pride was the only thing that kept him from dropping Harry's hand away like a stone, and once they had their food he used the excuse of needing both hands to eat to let go. He frowned down at his food, and for more than the greasy newspaper with their so-called dinner inside.

Harry didn't hear Draco's questions. He was too busy with his violent orgasm.
Harry kneeled beside him and pulled him into an embrace. "Accidents happen," he answered easily. "And you didn't ruin my party," (he'd done a bang up job of that one on his own). He squeezed the end of Teddy's pointed chin between his thumb and forefinger. It was so much like Draco's. "I'm not mad at you," he continued gently, "but you must do a better job minding your elders, pup. I've told you not to climb the shelves before and you knew we were waiting until after dinner for cake."

"You're perfect," he babbled. "Absolutely perfect."

He detached himself from Draco to pull the steak and potatoes out of the oven and hopefully keep them from becoming overly dry. Draco stayed rooted to the spot, tense and unsure.
His wandering mind came back to Malfoy. Harry could just picture him insulting a poor, cowering sous chef until the girl broke down in tears. Could see him smirking haughtily as his restaurant earned its third Michelin star. Trailing warm chocolate sauce down his--
Lucius sighed and stood up from the chair, without panic or rush. He settled both hand on the head of his cane after adjusting his clothes and hair. With a nod, he turned to leave for the door--his shoes' hard heels clacking against the old wood.

Concentrating on his food, and the fact that it was such a rich chocolate, definitely had a relaxing effect. He sucked on his thumb and then practically fellated his own middle digit. He placed the rest of the cookie into the bag, to save for later, and then proceeded to clean his fingers--not noticing the spot on his lip.

Good gracious, Life has kicked me in the teeth lately. Thanks to you, dear readers, and Prinn for being so patient with me.
And suddenly it all made sense: Harry was being tested. Malfoy wanted to know how far he could be pushed.

He continued tonguing Draco's arse until his jaw ached something fierce. He would have kept at it even then, but his neglected cock was becoming evermore insistent, particularly with all the needy sounds and muffled swears coming from Draco.
Despite your reasoning, I can't imagine what you see in me, and this exchange continues to reek of deception. Either be honest with me, completely, or cease with the owls.
"Aw, but I like the feel of you wrapped around me like this," Harry half-whinged, but he agreed it would be difficult to carry Draco around in stilletos. He hesitantly set his partner down, immediately turning him around and pressing him against the cool stones of the hearth. He grabbed Draco's hips and rocked his silk-covered cock in the crevice of Draco's arse.

"Yes, sir," he murmured with a seductive smile as he looked through his lashes at the man.

Draco blinked in surprise as Potter grew intensely angry. He took a few steps back with his hands up on the defensive and eyes wide.
"Like that, do you?" he asked smugly, leaning up on his elbows to see Draco's face. He looked half-shocked and entirely awed, his hands were white-knuckled on the slats of the headboard. Harry felt a surge of mixed triumph and lust.
Finally he was able to choke out, "Don't think there's anyone in the Ministry who--
Oh well. She could think whatever she wanted as long as she brewed his antidote.
"No. Now stop talking."
"What are you doing?!" he protested, holding his fiendish husband at arm's length.
Drakey wakey,
New plan: free now. Get your lily white arse over here, my darling Slytherin Prince.
"I know what you're doing," he declared with a smirk, "and it's a waste of your time."
Tucking his head into his paws, he kept a listening ear out for the sound of approach. After a minute of Potter thumping around the bedroom, he heard the the en suite shower come on.
I'll provide the tie.

"Come here and make yourself useful," he instructed, holding the spatula out to Draco. "You just need to keep the food moving so it doesn't stick or burn. You can stand there looking pretty while you do it."
Hearing Harry describe his partner that way caused an old flare of jealousy to rear its ugly head.
"How's that unboxing coming along?" he asked after swallowing conscientiously.
He reached up to wrap an arm around Draco's waist and hold the back of his head with the other so he could give him a proper snog. He held nothing back.
At first his memory seemed blurred, his mind sluggish. It took a solid minute of blinking his grey eyes and taking a cursory look around to remember he wasn't home... That the last place he had been was the Ministry, with Potter. He loosed a deep yawn as he moved to straighten himself on the foreign (though surprisingly comfy) couch.
"How did you know I don't like pickles?" Draco asked first as he took his burger. He eyed the yellow, crinkly wrapping dubiously, but as they were having a sort of "disagreement and feelings" talk he chose not to comment or examine too thoroughly. It at least

She told me I would have to keep him hidden from then on or risk losing him for good. He's been near me ever since.

Harry frowned. He knew the anti-Death Eater sentiment was still strong but he hadn't realized it was bad enough for Malfoy's
He groaned long and low at the sensation of his hand gliding smoothly over his swollen prick. He wasn't usually very vocal in bed (especially not when wanking), but he thought he could put some effort into it considering what Draco was doing for him.
Draco awoke with a start, disoriented and alarmed. He didn't know where he was and his gut twisted in agony.
Malfoy glided through the steps more easily than him, as expected--the man possessed more willowy grace than was fair or reasonable for someone so pointy and acerbic--but he seemed affected by Harry's unexpected prowess. He watched Harry with slightly widened, appreciative eyes and a small, genuine smile playing about his mouth.
Harry rolled up his shirt sleeves and donned an apron. He'd shed his robes while Malfoy slept. He set the kettle to boil and rummaged in the pantry to see what he had on hand that would be quick and easy.
I am sorry for the double devastation of your loss, but glad you found a German bloke in a pub to straighten you out. In a manner of speaking.)
"The only way Pansy or Blaise would ever be caught dabbling in the muggle is by being dead or stunned and therefore having no choice. Pansy works at St. Mungo's now as a Healer, or rather a Healer consultant, and Blaise is still happily unemployed and can often be found charming his way into the skirts and trousers of anyone he fancies all across Europe." He sighed sadly as he considered Gregory, though. He had no clue what the man had been up to the past seven years. Maybe he should have stayed in touch somehow after all?
Apparently I was wrong.
It was him.
The blonde, however, wasn't letting go. Not for food or gathering the aforementioned book. He was too busy pressing himself close and nibbling Harry's ear.
“I didn’t realize it was such a touchy subject, Potter,” he claimed, taking a half step back as he did so. “I’ll stop. Put your hackles down.”
"Obviously that's me," he answered, resigned to his fate. He stepped back a pace to give the agitated man some breathing room, bumping his glasses up his nose as he did so. "And it should be equally obvious why I practice under an assumed name."
? It tastes like sour mated with rotten and had a baby! What is that?"
“What’s the point?” came Malfoy’s tetchy reply as he looked away sharply. “I can’t do anything with it.“
Potter's expression faltered. "That's just not fair," he whinged, succumbing to the desire to tickle Draco's downy pelt despite his protest. ...They both enjoyed it probably more than they should.

Ron's expression was bewildered at his mention of the implement so Harry took the time to explain (pantomiming the act of injection), "A syringe is a device muggles use to inject liquids similar to potions into someone's bloodstream, usually for medicinal purposes but sometimes for recreational drug use. It's unlikely it would have been fatal even if the wizard had succeeded in stabbing the victim with it, but enough of a gas injected intravenously, or worse into an artery, can stop someone's heart."
"I know how to use a comb, prat," Harry rejoined. "My hair just resists all attempts to tame it."
Harry was just turning to leave when sudden recognition hit him over the head like the club of a cave troll.
He gingerly withdrew his softening prick from Draco's arse, making both of them hiss and Draco wince.

," Harry groaned, eyes glued to the sight of Draco's finger disappearing into his body, which was spread open wantonly before him.
They couldn't quite get their tempo together with Draco moving to meet Potter's brutal thrusts, so he stiffened his arms and flexed his core and focused on holding steady under the glorious assault. Each trust forced out a small gasp; he couldn't catch a breath to tell his dress-clad partner it was perfect. Even with the table's edge biting into his naked thighs and his chest rubbing hard against its surface, stinging sweat dripping into his half-closed eyes, and a cramp forming in his right calf, the impossible heat and delicious friction in his arse and on his prick more than made up for it.
Harry groaned. Ron saved himself a scolding by offering to help search for the attacker rather than saying something unconscionable like Malfoy deserved it, but he really wasn't being a team player here. And Harry really, really didn't want to put up with Gladys's leer three times in one day. One more would put him off dinner, he was sure.
Harry counted to ten. He clenched and unclenched his hands and practiced breathing through his nose and reminded himself that Ron was his first and best friend. And then he did it all again, until his magic had settled to the point that nothing in the office might spontaneously burst into flames. Particularly his arsehole partner.
Wondering where Ron was, Harry acknowledged Malfoy's heckling with a wave of his hand and hovered by the basin of the pensieve.
Draco pulled out to the very edge of his glands and flexed his hips forward--slamming back in once again, as deep as he could go. He hooked his arms, one at a time, under Potter's knees to give the man's arms freedom and leaned over him with a smirk.
Draco collapsed into the chair and brought Harry down with him. They both panted heavily. Harry felt warm and boneless, content to smother Draco until he was evicted. He drew one leg up against Draco's side but left the other on the ground for balance and the lack of space. Draco trailed light fingers on his back and Harry pressed sloppy kisses into his neck and collar bone.
The shade of the tree provided little shelter from the heat. Draco had one leg crossed over the other and his hands behind his head, cushioning it from the unyielding bark of the tree. There was likely to be a patch of dirt beneath him, but the concern for his trousers was temporarily nixed (Harry wouldn't care, except maybe to make a silly remark, and his robes would hide it from the rest of the world). He was smiling at first when he noticed Harry, but that quickly turned to concern upon noting the man's heavy breathing and serious expression.
He meant it.
Unfortunately, the unyielding wood of the table was destroying his knees; loathe as he was to stop, things needed to be changed.
Dear Draco,
Had he misinterpreted Harry's purpose in being there? That seemed to be what he was implying with his dig. As if Harry would use the pretense of Auror business to pull a bloke. (He'd only ever done that once, and it had been to pull a
Harry set his paperwork aside and faced Malfoy fully. "You've got to be okay with sweating and being pushed," he said frankly. "Sometimes, the exercises will hurt. Frequently, you will attempt a task and fail. It can be humbling, humiliating--it's downright shitty not being able to do things that used to come easily to you, things that other people take for granted. But that's all part of the process. You've got to push past your quitting points." He leveled Malfoy with a challenging stare, adding, "You'll have to
Choking slightly at the suddenness and force of Harry's orgasm, Draco swallowed as much as he could, thoroughly pleased with the rousing success that was his first foray into pleasuring another man. A few drops spilled past his lips, which he wiped off with his thumb and promptly licked clean. He smirked as he sucked on his digit and slowly stood back up.

"No? Really? Are you just not that adventurous or have you not had someone long enough to experiment with?"

He squeezed a generous amount onto his middle three fingers and spread the gel until each one was heavily coated. The tube was abandoned to the nightstand before he moved to grab one side of his arse by the cleft and pulled to make room for his right hand and the first slick finger.
P.S. Your desk is surprisingly clean and organized, despite its surface indicating otherwise. Bully for you!

Harry beamed. “
"Leaving," came the terse reply.
It wasn't even noon yet when he heard the rapping of knuckles on his door. Draco was finishing up his second cup of extremely strong tea with a tired glare and pajama bottoms covered in penguins. He hadn't bothered to dress in anticipation of the Auror's visit. Hell, he couldn't fathom why the Auror even wanted to come to his home. If it was "official business" as Potter said it was, Draco thought it might have been more prudent for the man to demand his presence at the Ministry. Not that he was entirely complaining... Despite his annoyance with the hour, he didn't mind a surprise visit from the handsome, gruff Savior.

"You know," it was practically a purr, "you are incredibly good looking. But I bet your fans remind you of that all the time. The last time someone told me that was probably last year, when I came out for the Winter Gala and this reporter from Witch Weekly begged for an interview... And something about a photo shoot. If it was anything like what Longbottom did, I'm kind of sad I said no. Been a while since someone other than Pansy or Blaise wanted to see me naked, or close to. How about you? Get laid often?"

Merlin's tits, it was worse than a snit. Draco had his knickers full in a twist. And Harry's begrudging remorse was quickly giving way to annoyance--he did not appreciate being raked over the coals for things that, while clumsy, weren't ill-intentioned.
When he opened his eyes again--when had he closed them?--Draco was grinning smugly down at him behind a fall of silky platinum hair. He was poised, thighs tense, over Harry's prick.

(which is, in fact, how he responded).
When the prat continued standing there, not inviting him in, Harry looked pointedly at the fat raindrops falling down around him and raised his brows.
Draco arched a brow in return. "You're late," he chided and began making his way down the stairs, trailing a hand lightly on the high-gloss wood of the banister.

“Just a towel, thanks,” he replied, scrubbing his hand through hair that was tacky with sweat and grimacing in response. Although he was almost faint from hunger, it would feel good to be clean finally. Maybe then he wouldn’t feel quite so out-of-place. (Unlikely.)

Licking his lips, he increased the pace and robbed Draco of breath. He wondered just how virginal the gorgeous man really was and thought about asking him later, but decided to attempt a bit of dirty talk of his own to find out. He was curious to see how Draco liked a taste of his own potion.
*****
"I noticed you avoided the Triple-O statement," Draco replied first with a forced chuckle, using the joke as a way to distract himself. He pointed his fork at Harry.
Draco's brows furrowed and his eyes nearly closed with the power of his orgasm as it ripped through him and into Potter. It was by pure will alone his gaze had remained on the spasming, sated body below him--determined to watch every moment to the last. Once he finally felt emptied, Draco slowly slid his cock out--dripping wet--with a slow sigh (a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding during the last few seconds.) His hands moved to shakily, carefully drop Potter's legs down until his feet were on the office floor. Once that task was done, the blonde levered himself over Potter and kissed him gently.
Draco arched his back as it was touched and chuckled as his hips stuttered slightly from surprise. It was unexpected to be conducting a conversation while having sex, but of course that was
Fortunately, that worry, at least, proved unfounded. After a minute or two of Harry attempting to regulate his ragged breathing to something that sounded slightly less like the Weasleys’ Ford Anglia (after its run-in with the Whomping Willow) and Malfoy trying unsuccessfully to replicate any of the previous spellwork, the Slytherin pocketed his wand with a thoughtful expression pinching his pale brows. He seemed to have a philosophical outlook on the whole affair—Harry could practically see the gears turning in his head even from his ground floor vantage point (as well as wholly new angles to torment himself with remembering in the dead of the night). Malfoy and Hermione were more alike than he had ever noticed before. What he really ought to be worried about, he decided, were the experiments Malfoy would almost certainly dream up to test the theories he was developing at the moment.
"This is going to sound really awful," he said regretfully, releasing Draco's back and preparing himself for a slap or hex, "but can I ask you a couple questions first? Somewhere more private, maybe?"
, I will gladly pretend this encounter never took place."
"Come for me, Harry... I want to see you spray the wall..."
Another lewd, languid stretch and he was being dismissed.
Some time later, a ginger head peeked through Harry's open office door. "Hey, mate," Ron greeted affably, "Can I tag along when you head home tonight? Hermione thinks she left Rosie's favourite dummy at your place."
his inner voice strongly cautioned.
“You were acting to keep yourself and your family alive.

"No way, mate! I'm not suffering her pinching fingers for a
That's so creepy.
Draco openly sighed with disappointment, though he was still grinning to ease any hurt Harry might have felt from the noise. (He decided he would hold Harry to that 'next time' clause, however.) He gave the uncapped lube a sniff and made an appreciative hum.
*****
Draco pretended not to notice, though inside he rejoiced.
“May I?“ he asked (still soft), gesturing to indicate his desire to correct Malfoy’s grip.
“Right,” he said simply, nodding a brief acknowledgment to the elf then turning his back to set to his belt buckle.
******
"Please," Harry replied, plating everyone's meals. He might need to break out the Ogden's, actually. He'd put on a brave front for Draco's sake, but inside he was just as anxious (if not more so). He had a lot riding on this dinner and too many wildcards to be able to feel at ease.
"To embarrass me, then," he ventured, knowing full-well he sounded like a right arse but feeling too committed at this point to quit.
Kris Kringle
He'd thought Draco's kisses were going to drive him up the wall, but they paled in comparison to his soapy hands sliding over the tense muscles of his back. He went rigid when Draco dragged his fingertips between his arsecheeks, unsure if he was interested in exploring any of that just yet (though the anxiety had been accompanied by an electric thrill at the intimate touch).
Harry turned him on his side and kissed a path from his ribs to his hip, pushing the knee of his top leg up to his chest and mounting him in a modified spoon position. It didn't require quite as much gymnastics as some of the front facing options but still offered the closeness and ability to snog, which were a requirement for Harry this time around.
With half-hearted cushioning charm cast on the grounds, he settled in for a few hours' rest.
"Come on, Drakey!" Pansy simpered (using the nickname she used to use for him back at school when she thought they were going to be inlove) as she approached the bedroom door from the entrance. "Come down and play! From all the hospital and Ministry rumors I have heard over the years while working with field officers, you enjoy a good threesome. I wonder if you could take two at once?"
"Where's your lube? We left our wands in the kitchen... Unless you'd like to start me off yourself? Rim me until I'm wet enough to test how many fingers I can put in?"
"Just pretend you're really fucking me and have at," Draco stated playfully and winked.
Write to me at least once a day until my arrest is over and the Estate and any items you choose to keep are yours. I want to know where you've been. You have been absent from the public since the war and it leaves me curious.
Draco laughed and opened the door just wide enough to let Harry and his load in. He grinned from ear to ear.
. Godrick. Harry stared and felt no shame it in. It jutted from Draco's body at a forty-five degree angle, shiny and hard and begging to be touched.
He carefully withdrew his hand and added more lube--no such thing as too much in this instance. He leaned low over Draco to take his mouth in a searing kiss as he inserted two fingers where one had been before.
He then offered his arm to Luna and the two walked out into the warm night together. Luna blew a final kiss over her shoulder (making her pickle earrings sparkle in the light) before shutting the door with an audible click. It seemed unusually loud in the silence that followed.
Harry nearly gasped. Draco took a quiet, rattling breath. "I appreciate your charity, Mr. Weasley. Your family has suffered more than most because of me and mine." He sniffed once and swallowed loudly; Harry recognized the signs of distress for what they were, though he didn't expect anyone else in the room would. "I have more that I would like to say on that particular topic but I don't believe now is the time."

With a muttered curse and angry
It wasn't exactly a walk in the park for Harry, either. He was trying to be a good little Auror and solve the case for his ex-arch nemesis (/current confusing wank fantasy). He'd had one too many unexpected revelations to be a perfectly buttoned-up professional, however.
Apparently Draco didn't have a say in the matter. That was fine--he really was hungry and it would be challenging to forage for himself as he was.
Draco's head fell back against the table, but his gaze never left Harry's. He moaned and grinned as Harry began to slide their cocks together once more. It was an oddly heady feeling, Draco decided as he opened his legs for better rutting access, to have his childhood crush so eager for him. He couldn't contain his hands--one squeezed a full cheek and slid between to tickle at the Auror's hole as the other slithered up Harry's back and down his sides. Draco thrust hard into his partner from the table.
Draco wrapped himself in the protection of his most prideful bearing. He didn't do that often anymore, didn't feel the need to; it broke Harry's heart that he needed it now. "I have nothing but the noblest of intentions with Harry," he declared, tone clipped, posture ramrod straight, hands folded tightly in his lap.

That's part of its charm.

Draco's outfit was ridiculous. Just completely absurd. Did he look good in it? Yes, absolutely. Was it enticing? Sure, in certain lights. But it was also impractical, ostentatious, and totally bizarre when compared with the attire of most of the rest of the establishment's patrons. And it had probably cost more than Harry's entire wardrobe combined. He would never understand haute couture.
Draco raised his eyebrows in mock fright. "
Malfoy sprawled on the sofa like he was seriously considering a nap. The potion must be working, then. (It was a good one. Brewed by Hermione herself. She kept her boys well stocked in emergency supplies that could easily be picked up at the first aid station, but then they'd have to actually go to the first aid station and fill out paper work and make do with an inferior draught and that just wouldn't do.) Malfoy didn't even bother opening his eyes to answer.
He nipped the end of Potter's nose hard enough to draw a speck of blood. Potter yelped and dropped him onto the sofa, where Draco glared murderously up at the erstwhile Saviour.
Well, I'd have to have a particularly good excuse... It is a seminar based on the book Hermione and I wrote on Tom Riddle and the rise of Voldemort. She is going as well, so I could weasel out if I beg hard enough and bribe her with rare books.
Draco turned his head to kiss Harry's neck, from his collar-bone (where he nipped) to the edge of his jaw (which he licked.) He nuzzled into the soft skin just below his ear.

"Use your mind to make us less sticky," Draco practically demanded as he curled around Harry and kissed his cheek. He nuzzled his lover's ear with a satisfied smile. "It's sexier than

Draco huffed internally.
He shrugged out of his coat--made difficult by the way he was pinned--and went to work open the buttons of his shirt. He winced with a sucking gasp when his bruised knuckles brushed Draco's abdomen.
He came up short in his steps, halting suddenly and ducking behind a wall, hoping against hope he hadn't been spotted. Or heard.

Quietly, Draco led him with a light hand on the small of his back to the seats left for them, giving him a reassuring squeeze as they sat. (Who exactly it was mean to reassure was open to debate.)
Draco gaped.
"Good thing," he wheezed, having a difficult time pulling off the sarcastic tone he was going for with his windpipe thus compromised.

Sweat beaded on his body and ran stinging into his eyes. He blinked it away as best he could, unwilling to let go of Draco in order to wipe at it, and stared transfixed at the sight of his Auror partner/ex-nemesis/perfect wank fantasy bouncing on his cock with abandon. Draco's hair swung wildly and bright spots of pink tinted his cheeks and chest, which had its own thin sheen of sweat. Harry wanted to reach up and lick a stripe across it, but he was unwilling to interrupt Draco's train.

He'd been using that brand at least since taking the Flying Instructor's post at Hogwarts. And Draco had been noticing it just as long. It was always there, subtly, beneath the layers of sweat and grass and broom polish. Potter smelled like the outdoors--in the best of ways. He smelled like flying. Like sunshine. Freedom. Adventure.
Draco quirked a brow at his date. At first, he thought Harry had followed him out of impatience (he must have taken at least ten whole minutes) and found it somewhat amusing, until he noticed the Auror's serious grimace. The way his brow furrowed and his lips thinned meant trouble either happened or was afoot.

Draco dug into his pocket and produced a black velvet box. It was thin and square, and when he opened it he revealed a small crystalline disc with what appeared to be white specks suspended inside. He handed it to Harry carefully.
Potter followed behind, assessing the scene with a practiced eye. After a minute, he stooped to pick up Draco's robes and wand, the latter of which he stowed in his back pocket. Despite the way his own clothing had been strewn about his living quarters, he carefully folded Draco's and found a clean place to put them.
At any rate, the truth of Malfoy's brief tenure as a Death Eater came to light during his trial before the Wizengamot and was the chief reason he avoided time in Azkaban. No matter his motives, he was no friend of Voldemort. And Harry's estimation of him had risen considerably since then. There'd just never been a good opportunity to tell him so.
Harry snorted and took Draco by the elbow to apparate them to their destination. "Why," he smirked, "

His chest was heaving and a flush climbed his throat. From Potter's carding, his hair had gone from a somewhat artistic mess to just messy--and he couldn't care less. Having someone tug at it was far more pleasant than he expected.
The tension in Draco's body melted and he offered up a smile and a casual brush off. It was exactly what Harry wanted...except not like that.
That much was true, at least.
By "before" he meant at his trial. He remembered the entire proceeding with regret in his eyes.
That's how it's going to be, is it?
"Anyway, yes. Same restaurant, same girl. I'm sure of it. She was unaccountably rude so her face stuck in my mind."
If you don't want me, that's fine. But I refuse to hear you or anyone say that you're not worthy of me. I am the only one who gets to make that decision and I am more than a little peeved you would suggest otherwise.
"What's on the file?" he asked to change the subject.

"I don't know... That apology wasn't very sincere," he replied with a grin Draco rarely displayed these days. "I might need more convincing."
Harry knew Malfoy didn’t like to look at it if it could be helped and was self-conscious about others seeing it. For his part, Harry could care less about how the thing looked, he simply wanted to help Malfoy—like any of his patients—regain as much capability and confidence as possible. He had a sudden, crazy urge to seek out and grasp the offending extremity. But seeing as he didn’t have a death-wish (several stern lectures from Hermione on the subject notwithstanding) and the fact there had been rather a lot of hand holding already, he thought better of it.
"Don't mistake me," he began, indicating the get-up. "I just don't believe you realize half of what you're doing right now."
Old habits, Harry thought.
Regrettably, Draco didn't have the luxury of continuing that line of thought--Potter was a spartan bather. The water shut off mere minutes after he started and the door to the loo opened another minute after that. From it wafted the alluring scent of Potter's soap.
I have been dared to pay you a compliment. (The dare-giver mistakenly thought this would be a challenge for me.)

Surrogacy to me is too messy. I would hate to have the surrogate become attached to the child, thus resulting in a bitter custody dispute. Unlike my forefathers, I don't require a child to be biologically mine to know that it is my own.

"Let me take care of you," Harry said hugging Draco to him, voice a warm caress. Draco had been beyond wonderful all through the night. He and Ron more or less pretended the other didn't exist, which was fine; Hermione, on the other hand, was a champion about letting bygones be bygones and Draco had responded in kind.
After saying something really quite strange.

Potter kissed his clavicle. "Does it help any if I say you make a particularly fearsome ferret?" he simpered.
Big, round watery eyes stared up at him, set in a withered face that looked none too pleased.
"With that hair?" Harry asked facetiously, twining a lock of it around one finger. "You can be the prettiest of princesses." He gave the strands a tug and released them to begin plating the meal, instructing Draco to set the table as he did so.
Malfoy made a noncommittal sound, but Harry was encouraged by the fact his frown wasn't quite so frown-y. It was more of a 'this-is-how-my-face-is-used-to-looking' frown.
Draco slowly withdrew his hand, shivering as he did. He was nice and wet and so close to the brink. He crooked his shining fingers at Harry with a smoldering grin.
"Easy there," Potter murmured gently, lowering his hands. "I'm sorry I scared you."
Bloody hell. He was
"'Mione's going to be disappointed."

His hands were on the move again: first roaming over the Auror's hips and under the curve of his ass before grabbing both globes and squeezing tight. He shifted his legs apart to accommodate Harry's stance and forced their erections to rub together even harder by jerking him forward.
Harry stamped out the small thrill he felt at Malfoy's (sort-of) compliment. "Thanks," he said off-handedly, pressing the button for Level Two. "And thank you for meeting me here today. I've been looking over the names of those who applied for restitution from your family and cross referencing them against anyone who might hold a grudge against
(I used that word with full awareness and I meant it.)
...There were pros and cons to all possibilities.
Harry had two false starts before he could reply properly because Draco had picked up the pace and it was just really fucking fantastic. He opened his mouth to respond but his words were swallowed up by his own gasps and grunts. (

Harry grinned, charmed and eager.
He was not even remotely prepared for what he stumbled into.
He dropped to his knees (with a jarring rattle of bones; he'd been too fast and too careless) and eyed Draco's prick like it was a challenge. He maneuvered Draco's body so it blocked the stream of water, held his prick steady with a loose grip around the base, and pressed a tentative kiss to the crown.

," interrupted his thoughts. Janine (42, housewife, rotator cuff surgery) sidled up next to him with a knowing smirk.
"I'm going to enjoy this... And if we are going to use all my torture devices it may very well take a few days. You will need to inform your loved ones of your capture, of course."
After spending the night Wednesday (and every other night for a full week before that), Draco reluctantly announced the next morning that he should return to his house to make sure his owl was okay and that spiders didn't move in in his absence. Harry hadn't tried to stop him--why should he?--but the estate had felt surprisingly cold and empty without him that night.
Gladys was grinning lewdly at her magazine when Harry approached. He'd already seen this one. Everyone had seen it. Neville (aka Hogwarts Herbology Hunk) had finally been talked out of his trousers. The issue sold out in record time.
"Try that again and you're on your own," Potter warned darkly. "Spiteful little bastard," he grumbled under his breath, shaking out his stinging thumb.

A wide grin split Harry's face after he recovered from the electric jolt of Draco impaling himself on his cock.

Draco's clothes were gone with a thought.
"Dessert. Here," Draco said with a chuckle as he leaned away and sat back properly in his seat with a smirk. "You can just wait to 'whip something up' later."
Harry slumped. "Not yet," he answered on a gusty exhale. "But I will be."
What I want to hear is that
It felt like it was a mile, not twenty feet of office-grade carpet and crown moulding. And because Harry's uncanny good fortune was a fickle mistress indeed, Sarah was busy with a caller when they finally arrived at the appointment counter. Because
He leaned forward in his chair, pinning Malfoy with a significant look, and continued, "You are right that catching him wouldn't eliminate every threat but it would send a message. Every citizen is equal in the eyes of the law: you are entitled to the same basic protections as everyone else, just as your assailant deserves to stand trial for his crime."
Incorrigible. Absolutely incorrigible.
"The procedure is muggle. You wouldn't have heard of it," he said dismissively. "But did you report that attack to the DMLE? I don't remember it from any of our briefings and you're high profile enough that it would have come across an Auror's desk at some point."

honest but in general that is still better than lies or withholding information), elegant, sophisticated, tall (I find I have more of the advantage being short than most realize). You have lovely eyes and pretty posh accent. And it doesn't hurt that you're gorgeous.
Fair enough.
"We should ask Harry his intentions with Draco, as well," Luna interjected in her gentle, singsong way. "Besides wanting to have sex with him, of course."
"...That too weird...?" Draco asked with a wince.
"I'll trust you, since you're being so adorable and sexy," he replied easily. "Now, get on with what you had planned, if you please. I'm curious to know if you're a 'god of fellatio' like Carter down in Accounting claims."
He cackled evilly at Harry's exaggerated frown, but stopped short a moment later upon registering the content of the parchment he held.
My own confirmation was right after the war.)
He smiled into Harry's wild black hair as his breathing gradually evened and he was claimed by sleep.
He dropped his arms to his sides and shuffled minutely where he stood, all too aware of their audience.
"Those were a gift, you berk," Harry replied, leaning against the counter content to watch Draco work. "And I hardly think you'd look any more ridiculous than you will eating dinner in your altogether. But if you'd rather be nude, I'm not complaining."
Draco appeared to be dozing when Harry finally returned but he cracked an eye open at the sound of a floorboard creaking.
******
"I'm not going to try to justify it," Harry went on. "I was inappropriate and out of line. I shouldn't've accused you, and I definitely shouldn't've come to your home to do it. I was wrong. And I'm sorry."
Draco panted through his nose, both from the exertion of being deflowered and from the intensity of the kiss. He suckled on Harry's tongue and lips for distraction until his arse muscles began to calm (not entirely, but until the burn was tolerable). He licked his lover's bottom lip before breathing, "Move," and starting the kiss all over again.
"Seems you got a smear, love. Just what were you up to?" Draco said innocently as he imagined the looks on Weasley and Granger's faces upon seeing the spot.
Draco concentrated on Harry's hansom, though a bit muggle, outfit versus the idea of the crowd surely awaiting them. The stares and gossip he could handle without issue (he was used to them), but it was the strong possibility they might be approached... By anyone... That made him most uneasy. He took a long breath, kissed Harry's temple (silently begging not to be left alone anywhere), and walked with Harry through Diagon Alley.

"You ok?" he asked breathlessly, brushing Draco's fringe off his forehead and noting the way he bit his lip.
Draco grinned as Harry rolled off to the side. He sat up, first swatting Harry's hand away from his prick and then moved to straddle him--shoving the man aside to straighten him up on the table to avoid falling off. It was only just wide enough for them to lay tightly side by side. Draco leaned down to give the Auror's lips a hard, demanding kiss that only lasted a second before Draco was sitting up again.
Draco's heart was thudding hard against his chest. Of course Harry-bloody-Potter would be that good at hand-jobs and even better at such rough, verbal seduction. For a second he thought he might come from Harry's words alone.
Your go.
Potter laughed, but it wasn't the rich, joyful laughter of the last many minutes--there was a bitter edge to it. Draco felt the difference acutely.
Harry
Harry took the sound of the door unlocking as invitation and stepped inside...only to be almost bowled over by the thick wall of steam that met him.
He dragged his palm down over his nose and mouth and gave in to the impulse to groan since it would be muffled. Malfoy looked fucking...
Her assumptions? Associate? Being as she is your closest friend (or so I presumed), I thought she would know everything about you. I am guessing you're mad at her... Though I'm pretty glad she did what she did.
The world was a strange place.
Harry gave a lopsided smile, feeling oddly buoyant over the fact Malfoy was making fun of him again. "It's part of my charm."
"Come on, you," Harry said to him, making to leave.
Unfortunately, Sarah proved harder to shake.
By the time Harry arrived, Draco had a chocolate stain on his cheek and pants on. Nothing else. The door was waved open with his wand.
. And no use trying to escape--anti-apparition wards are a girl's best friend sometimes."

He released Draco's hip to begin unbuttoning his own shirt with his off-hand, maintaining the tempo of his right with little difficulty (he'd always been good at split-mind tasks). He finished off the buttons and opened his shirt to expose his chest and abdomen--scarred and lightly furred, but not unappealing, he knew.
Dear Malfoy,
Draco fell back easily. He immediately wrapped his legs around his lover and hugged the Gryffindor with his entire body. When their kiss broke, he frowned and glared at the Auror.
"... Excuse me?" he asked with a short bark of a chuckle. Harry wasn't the type to joke about such thigs, but it didn't quite click. "Pansy loves me, despite her occasional bad attitude. And Blaise has wanted me since his bollocks dropped. They're the only ones besides my parents who bothered to keep in touch. They always kept their standing visit with me every month, and Blaise even procured us private arrangements when the three of us would meet for coffee or dinner! Because he understands how I feel about the public now. He was even accommodating when I told him I would only see him with Pansy in tow because he knows what a horny bastard he is! Why would... They wouldn't."
That was almost just as bad.
Malfoy took it and inspected it closely. "What's this?" he frowned. (Pinched brows, slightly downturned lips... Confusion; Harry was getting good at identifying them.)
You are the one who seems uncertain.

“I’m being sincere, Potter. I’ve not even attempted to cast a spell in weeks. I haven’t the faintest clue what that might do to a wizard’s magical expression.”
"He's interesting," he explained hesitantly. "He makes me...interested. I mean, all the witches I've dated have just been so boring. They agree with everything I say and laugh at all my jokes and stare at me like I'm some kind of fucking living-legend and just lay there in bed letting me do whatever I want without actually participating and I'm bloody sick of it!" He gained steam as he spoke, leaning forward and gesturing wildly. "Malfoy actually listens to me and doesn't just do what I say and he challenges me and, Merlin, he's half daft and he drives me up the wall, but he
“You said it was a blasting curse?” he intoned.
Draco snorted. "I can attempt to be good in the behavior department, but unfortunately all I own is skin-tight or revealing clothing," he replied with a one-shouldered shrug (though it was meant as a joke, the statement was about 80% true, however). "I do admit it may be hard to keep from wanting to touch you myself... You're a very sexy man, did you know that?"
*****
Their table was a semi-private one with walls on three sides. They gathered a few odd looks on their way to it, but most of the restaurant's patrons were well bred enough to keep their glances subtle and their gossiping quiet. That was one of the main reasons Harry had chosen this place. (The other was an off-hand comment Draco had made about liking the duck.)
"I'm not sure about this," he replied eventually. "But it's not my decision. I get it... But it's Malfoy! Why couldn't it have been someone who isn't a complete wanker? Ugh..."
"I just haven't seen you in robes in a while," he finally managed. "You look good."
P.S. Not that I want to control your decisions, but please do me a favor and avoid anything too tight or revealing (unless you're planning to cheat.) Thanks!
