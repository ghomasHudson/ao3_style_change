I turned to Snape who was holding the book I had been trying to grab, his expression dark and fearsome.
I wanted to get rid of the diadem, but there was never a time I could practice the fire spells without anyone else watching. Not to mention I needed the slytherin pocket watch back from Snape who I was currently ignoring.
“The Ministry of Magic is a new change to how we handle laws. We used to have a monarchy we plan to bring back to life. A new leader and new sign of hope. They would have a new council to replace the ministry of magic with certain rights, so some separation of power. Giving all the power to one group of people is clearly not the way forward. ” Snape explained rubbing his head, a headache clearly building from the cruciatis curse.
"But you also would know if they are destroyed, right?" I said pointedly. He stopped pacing considering this.
I felt nothing bowing at his feet, my submission a normal part of life at this point. Whatever it took to stay alive.
I managed to keep my thoughts off of Snape very effectively learning new defense spells, but the moment the class ended I felt my worry for tonight’s lessons coming back.
“I specifically said NO dark arts books Granger.” I snapped stalking to her intimidatingly. Her eyes widened at first in fear, but then she smiled a bit. My annoyance increased.
"Three. Confundus!" The room seemed to lose air in an instant. It was like a vacuum had been started and every ounce of oxygen had been sucked out with the flip of a switch. The spell had been heading towards me, but the magic vanished with a wisp of gold color extinguished by some unknown source.
“Did you see how she panicked there? She’s way more afraid of you Severus. Not to mention your so much more entertaining to watch. Her time turner escapades have ensured she’s of age. No more arguing by, get to it Severus.” Voldemort said with finality that left no room for argument. Snape picked me up by my robes in one swift motion and I tried to scream but couldn’t. I tried to wiggle out of his grasp but he was surprisingly strong, more muscle under his shirt than I realized.
“I…I was with the Dark Lord. Now I’m here though and I don’t want to go. Ever. I want to stay here, with you!” I announced twirling her around, her light dress flying up a bit. She smiled with a small giggle, but then her seriousness returned.
"Just what Granger? It's not like I risked my life every time I told him no when he wanted me to bring you. It's not like I have given up years of my life for ungrateful people like you. Yes, I did horrible things, but surely your not so stupid as to see WHY I did them." He said angrily, shoving me away when I tried to grab his arm. I didn't know what to say, but he stalked off before I could even formulate a coherent response.
“Good. Let me get you one of everything.” He said happily. He delivered on his promise and the elves had copious trays of beautiful delicious dishes before me in seconds, their excitement tangible with my every bite.
"Kill him and I will give you anything you want. I see the desire in your eyes for greatness. You would be a hero to our side." He said enchanting from about ten feet behind me.
“Who exactly do you think you are you little mudblood?” He asked so softly and quietly only I could hear him. He was baiting me. I was sure of it. He wanted me to yell and make a fool of myself just to make me look bad. Hearing him call me a mudblood though seemed to do the opposite. I felt my heart race thinking of every way I wasn’t good enough. Every time I had failed. Every person who hated me at the school just because of my parents.
"Why do you have it?" The silence stretched on longer than what was comfortable. She looked at me with utter contempt.
Harry poked her in the side and got her attention again and just like that the feeling was gone. Her smile returned and it was only then that I realized it was fake.
"Well, you truly are oblivious, aren't you. Surely he told you where we are, didn't he?" She said with a wry laugh. I shook my head looking around.
"Looks quite happy indeed." Minerva said with a tight smile mirroring my earlier statement about the picture in the article that started the morning's drama. I snorted in amusement, shaking my head still quite shocked.
“Of course. It's worth it.” I said with an air of triumph that only angered him more. Harry gave me a pitying look, but in a manner of minutes Snape and I were the only ones left in the room.
“Is that what your plan was for tonight? Corrupt Granger so you get bragging rights?” I said with amusement drinking slowly.
"What's wrong? Surely you don't regret this?" I said hopefully. I had enjoyed myself quite a lot and wanted more. He looked at me shocked.
"He wasn't alone." I said harshly, but so quiet he was barely able to hear me. The burning anger I had for the man and every time he tortured me flooded back. The horrid things he stood for, and most importantly him taking Severus from me churned within. The magic from Severus had melded with mine and begged for release.
"Miss. Granger, will you marry me knowing I WONT die, at least not of any immediately foreseeable circumstances of course." He asked, chuckling a bit at his dark humor. I nodded, smiling sure I wanted nothing more than that.
"Oh? What effect does it have to not add fairy wings Potter?" I questioned him silkily. He was silent, his gob smacked expression quite hilarious.
"So what? I'm supposed to forgive you for intentionally making me develop feelings for you just because you didn't think you would get feelings? Sounds like a personal problem. Sorry the plan didn't work out for you." I said curtly turning again and twisting myself out of his grip. I had actually made it part way back up the hill to the castle when he called for me.
“Of course not. I noticed Ron was left off your list of people to protect. Looks like that ship has sunk, hasn’t it?” He teased mirthfully. I blushed at the insinuation.
"You gained access to my magic, but I also gained access to yours. While you were over there panicking I was stealing enough of your magic to heal myself. When I was done I gave that and as much of mine as I could spare to you. Hence the giant explosion." He said, his eyes shining mirthfully.
“Enough Potter. I’ve already arranged for her release.” Snape said as if he were the hero of the evening. Harry drew his fist back to punch Snape in the face, but Snape grabbed his fist midair and threw him back effortlessly. Draco was standing back watching everything unfold angry, but calm, his grey eyes flickering between Snape and I as if he understood something maybe I didn’t even know.
I heard him cursing under his breath and knew if he wasn’t in his rooms, he was most likely with Voldemort. What I had seen...it meant he was going within himself to escape something. Pain most likely. I thought to Neville's parents and hoped that wasn’t the case.
"I have known him since I was born and I haven't ever seen him look at someone like that." Draco mused looking at me like perhaps I had the answer.
My smile fell and I could have kicked myself for my stupidity. I had just willingly become the biggest tool for the Dark Lord that he had yet. We were supposed to be ready to kill him before that happened.
"Oh, don't have enough juice for your next article?" I asked harshly, still angry for her betrayal. She sat down fidgeting with her red hair nervously biting her lip.
A slightly easier possible horcrux was the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. It had a long history of being stolen and then hidden or lost and would have attracted Voldemort since it supposedly made the wearer more powerful. I knew if my suspicions were correct, that Riddle hid the diadem here at Hogwarts. No one would go looking for a horcrux under the very roof that his greatest enemy inhabited.
“My family had one. I couldn’t ever go near it.” Draco commented looking at me curiously and almost suspiciously like I was up to no good.
"Old dear Dumbledore has an empath right under his nose and didn't even know it. Not so brilliant now, is he? Brightest witch of our age. Except she's no ordinary witch. Her DNA is from an entirely different branch of witches and wizards that died out thousands of years ago. Or so I thought. It seems she somehow managed to get both copies of her families recessive genes." He said getting pleasure out of having one upped the headmaster.
“Why are you smiling you know it all? You want to be tortured until you're ready to beg for mercy? Do you get off on that?” I asked her, shoving her against the wall and pinning her there with one hand. Her eyes looked me up and down and hovered for just a split second on my mark and my silver chain curiously.
I sat at the late night staff meeting barely paying attention. They were arguing about which colors to display for Christmas holidays and I just couldn’t be bothered. My mind was on her.
His words echoed in my mind making me uncomfortably warm for some insane reason. While my logic said I should have him, my body clearly had other ideas. He had wanted me to enjoy it and had even refused to go further until I told him I was ready. It was bewildering how he had taken every ounce on control from me, but yet had still made sure I knew I could stop him at any point.
"Of course. Here I was thinking we made progress this morning only for you to go back to ignoring me. Clearly you just don't want me." I said hating myself for caring, but unable to not care.
The water poured over me cleansing me and washing away his scent just to be replaced by my lavender body wash scent. I needed a sense of normality back. When I was done I stopped in front of the mirror since I was alone looking at myself almost fascinated. He had left bruises on my hips and arm from where he had me roughly. I traced a finger over the sensitive skin and closed my eyes replaying the scenes in my head repeatedly. It wasn't necessarily a bad feeling that replaying the memories brought back.
Instead I just felt his kiss was gross and sloppy. I pushed him away as soon as I came to my bearings. Snape had vanished in that few seconds it took me to end the kiss.
I responded back with more than a hint of innuendo. She was quiet after that so I had no idea if she approved of the flirtation, but my mood was high enough I didn't care.
"I'm fine." She mumbled sitting back down slowly refusing to look at me. Poppy sighed and nodded giving her a firm pat.
"Feel his magic? Of course. It courses through you like an unstoppable waterfall." He said with a sarcastic laugh feeling the air around me feeling what I supposed was my magic.
"Oh no Granger. Your secret is safe with me. There will be of course a cost." He said watching me excited at the very prospect of whatever he was going to demand. My mind went to dark places thinking of all the vile, gruesome things he could request of me and I started to regret my plan. Perhaps being tortured to death didn't sound so bad after all.
He said glancing down at me seeing me nodding off a bit. I sighed and wrapped one arm around his neck closing my eyes obediently and I was out.
"I don't really have time for that." I said evenly used to her prying. She was a kind old lady, but rather nosey.
"Severus, please be serious. I can only turn a blind eye to your behavior so many times. We can't have you going off being a vigilante making yourself jury, judge, and executioner. We have the legal system for a reason." The judge said impatiently. Severus snorted in humor.
I had to assume it was due to the empath DNA in her that made her different. Much like a Veela, people were drawn to her in a way that wasn’t logical. She was oblivious, but I had seen the envious glances from the male population and heard the horrid things they whispered after she left. I wasn’t the only one who’s mind wandered in an unsafe direction when she was around.
When I got into the common room to my surprise Harry and Draco were sitting together in front of the fire laughing about some game they were playing.
“Want some hot coca dear?” The kind old store owner offered bringing me a cup to help me warm up. It was freezing outside and I was wearing a petticoat and my school skirt since I couldn’t find any outfit that worked nicer. The only thing that gave my legs anything warm was black thigh high stocking I put on. I had spelled them to stay warm, but the charm had worn off about an hour ago.
“You remind me so much of my granddaughter. Your hair has those same curls and all. What are you doing here alone?” She asked curiously. I smiled with an ironic snicker.
"I asked Elijah what he wanted for Christmas. I delivered. I couldn't deny a young boy his Christmas wish, could I?" He said with an ironic smile.
I couldn't admit to myself that I was lovesick over Snape. My thoughts continually went back to him though and I found myself crying more than a few times before taking a deep breath and throwing myself back into my studies.
"Wow. I think whatever reporter that wrote that story is in the wrong field. They should get a job in divination instead." She joked amused.
Snape had to have removed his tracking curses on the pocket watch at some point. He had no idea it was destroyed.
“You know, it’s strange he likes ya so much. He seems to be drawn to ya.” Hagrid said watching the little bird try to get out of his cage to get to me.
“I don’t want any interruptions this time.” He explained throwing the powder in the flames and calling his rooms for me. I was sure students were not allowed in professors privates rooms, but I had been in them already so I didn’t complain.
“He had a meeting with Tom.” He said pointedly trying to speak in code. As if it mattered. I sighed, throwing up a Muffalito spell.
I drank my hot chocolate considering his words. He was right. I had crossed the line of decency, but she hadn’t really. She hadn’t opened up at all let alone let her guard down.
He grabbed me by my waist and put me on the ground ending my height advantage for the argument. He had only done so to grab me by my coat and shove me into the bookshelf hard enough to cause some books to fall off.
“Yes, I just got caught up with school work. That’s it.” I lied not wanting to burden her with the details of my every move. She rolled her eyes dramatically.
“I think he’s not done with me.” I said quietly. The words lingered in the air thickly and I hoped the headmaster would speak and wash away my concerns, but he was silent.
Snape appeared in front of me, the invisibility charm he had used fading away as his body slumped forward.
"I don't want to do wicked things to you just to abandon you Hermione." He said finally using my first name again. I smirked taking one last long drink of the wine, the liquid courage helping tremendously.
"You're saying you want me to refuse him knowing he will try to kill me and trust that you WON'T let him kill me?" I asked for clarification. He nodded.
"No, I want you." I said letting his shirt come off. I hadn't noticed it last time, but he wore a silver locket. It was familiar, but I only got to focus on it for one second before he kissed me again, not letting me stay distracted for long.
"I thought you were a goner for sure!" Draco announced sounding entirely uncaring of my return safe and sound. Harry gave me a slightly better welcome and ran to me throwing his arms around me for the biggest hug possible.
“I hope this is important Severus? We were having an important conversation.” The headmaster said with a sigh leaning back in his chair waiting to hear my explanation.
"How would you know Severus? Your magic is almost as dark as his." My reply lingered and his amusement died down a bit realizing I was right.
“Severus, not insulting is not the same thing as showing genuine affection and sweeping her off her feet.” I couldn’t deny he had a point.
I didn't know what I would do with a child. I had done so many crazy things through the years, breaking curfew, fighting dark wizards, sneaking around getting into mischief.
The death eaters had Harry held up by his arms, everyone else had lost. It was just me that hadn't been captured yet, though why, I didn't know.
"Yes well, your forgetting the bonding goes both ways Miss. Granger. You didn't just fall in love with me, I fell in love with you." He said as if that explained it all. He sighed a bit seeing my confused expression.
Trusting him was hard to do. Everything about him shocked me, finding out he led a huge company was just the tip of the iceberg of what I didn't know about him. I could only imagine the hidden life he lived went far deeper than what I assumed, especially considering how at ease he seemed to be getting arrested. They didn't even bother restraining him as if just knowing he wasn't going to try to run or anything.
"You should probably go to her. I'm sure she's upset." She said after a long considering moment. She wouldn't give me her blessing, but the meaning made clear. She wouldn't stand in my way either, no matter how much she disproved.
I was seven eating a small snack in a corner of my room trying to remain unnoticed. I had been starving and my mother had forgotten to feed me yet again so I had stolen the crackers.
"Look. I was meanin' to ask you about some potion for my knarls. They've been lookin real thin lately." I didn't stay around to see how it played out, I carefully got out of sight of them then ran inside thankful to get freed from Severus's grasp.
He was fairly light skinned, but he had not a single wrinkle on him. His hair was thick and glossy, its health evident even without me touching it. He didn't have a single grey hair anywhere.
"Why would I do that? You never even told me you had a horcrux." I said hoarsely shaking my head empathetically trying to play dumb.
"To pull her out would be admitting guilt and that something untoward has happened." I said firmly not wanting her life upended even more than before. The Headmaster sighed tiredly rubbing his long beard sitting back in his chair watching me.
"I...I was trying to make...nevermind." She said deflating at my comment, her confidence leaving in a split second. She usually argued back with me, or would meet my gaze with even more hatred than mine had.
"You're here! I'm dead, aren't I? Oh I don't mind, I'm just relieved to see you." I said in a rush, Madam Pomfrey's calming spell released with a snap. Severus chuckled, shaking his head and picking me up, putting me back in bed easily.
It was a gorgeous blue and silver piece that looked timeless and yet so beautiful I had to admire it. The moment I touched it I could feel the darkness it held within it.
Empaths were forced to work for corrupt witches or wizards they bonded with and this is how the dark arts came to be." He finished reading the passage and looked at me ashen, his mind thinking the same thing as me.
"Technically, yes. Its rarity is what makes its value so high. I created it myself. So no, you wouldn't ever read about it." He said with an amused smile. It was only then that I looked at him, more than just looked at his individual features but rather the whole picture.
"The ring." I said feeling my chest noticing its absence. He pulled out the ring from his pocket taking it off the chain.
"Good luck, don't die." A first year said with a hopeful look. Everyone suddenly wanted to wish us good luck and we left to a chorus of 'Good Luck, don't die', their excitement quite tangible.
There was a black figure coming towards me quickly, a glint of light off their bone mask the only giveaway. I opened my mouth to scream, but their hand covered my mouth silencing me, my fear dying down catching the familiar musky, intoxicating scent of the death eater.
"Miss. Granger. We meet again." The Dark Lord said, his nose turned up at me disgusted, what was left of it anyways. I tried to right myself wearing just a skirt and white shirt and having fallen over quite brilliantly when Snape threw me.
"I had no idea she had any magic in her lines." I said honestly. It never mattered to me. I could tell it meant everything to him though.
I pushed her roughly and waved my hand opening the door behind her. I had been about to go into my rooms when she stopped me so the positioning couldn't have been better. It was like fortune wanted us together.
The sound of my hand slapping her reverberated in the otherwise empty hall and I felt shock go through my body.
“I don’t know.” He said simply. He sent a patronus towards Snape’s rooms, but headed towards the front doors anyways. Seconds later his patronus was back shaking its head no.
"I think we're done for the day. Class dismissed." Professor Lupin said staring at me as if I somehow was the reason the air was so thin. His brow was furrowed and he put away his wand absently staring at me.
"Perhaps, yes. Hmm...Severus, your dismissed." He said waving me off in a distracted way not even giving mind to my presence anymore. He had no idea how much information he had just given us. We had no idea he was monitoring the horcruxes, but now that we knew he could remove the tracking we would catch him even more off guard.
"I'm sorry." I told her hating to see her cry. I didn't want her to be hurt. No one should hit their wife like that. She looked back at me with contempt through the tears.
I went to transfiguration class early and made a point to sit away from my normal seat so Ron wouldn't sit by me. Professor McGonagall raised an eyebrow seeing me come in early clearly charged about something and she put away her book.
"Stop holding back. I know you desire him. Your so-called morals are pointless. You have one life, you might as well enjoy it." I nodded breathing a sigh of relief only when he was gone.
"I think we will all shed a few tears when he finally gets you knocked up." She continued a bit sad at the very thought.
"I knew it was cursed, it's a bit of a research project on the Dark Lord. Draco helped me find the diadem, but I haven't been wearing it. I wanted to destroy it actually." I insisted putting the diadem in my luggage and locking it before someone else stumbled on it. Ginny's eyes widened even further.
I had seen how stressed she was. She had lost weight for sure, and while she was normally the calm one of her friends she had lashed out more often than was normal for her. Yet, I had to continue on. To not go along with the Dark Lords plan would mean she wouldn’t serve a purpose anymore. She would be dead.
“I don’t know what game your playing at, but I would be careful who you talk to like that. You want dark? I can show you fucking dark.” He whispered harshly, his anger tangible in the small book store. His dark eyes flashed dangerously and I knew I had crossed a line. I wanted to make another smart comeback, but my thoughts went into another direction entirely. I felt myself blush and I wriggled trying to escape his grasp.
"Some welcome. You invited me just to curse me?" I asked with amusement. He relaxed slightly, putting his wand away, but still seeming on edge.
“Where are you REALLY?” She said pulling back a bit and looking in my eyes. She seemed concerned. Her brown eyes were so gorgeous, yet I rarely had the chance to appreciate them in real life.
I got dressed slowly my thoughts swirling and rushing back and forth trying to make sense of everything. I was late for Charms, but luckily no one seemed to care and I slipped into my desk quietly taking notes.
"How long..how long was I wearing that?" I asked, taking a few deep steadying breaths. He gave me a weird look and looked at the diadem skeptically.
"I could say the same thing about you." I growled and went to lunge at him, but the cruciatus curse hit me before I could attack him.
He said back possessively. He tipped my chin up to him and I felt my heart racing realizing he was going to kiss me. I closed my eyes waiting curiosity overwhelming me even in my pained state. When he didn’t kiss me immediately I opened my eyes back up wondering what was wrong. He was staring back down at me with a small smirk playing at his lips, his dark eyes filled with mirth.
I didn't realize how anxious I had gotten until I relaxed in his embrace. How was it that someone that drove me absolutely insane was also the source of my deepest inner peace?
“Then why yous has his magic Misses? House elves give their masters some of their magic to stay bonded with them. You want to bonded with Professor Snape.” He said earning himself a rush of whispers from the other house elves agreeing with him.
"Finally someone has gotten her out of here." The librarian said shaking her head amused, misreading the situation entirely. I bit my tongue wanting to tell her I most certainly did NOT want to go with him, but I held back.
“Everything okay Severus?” The Headmaster asked. I hadn’t realized I had frozen with my fork halfway to my mouth. Even Hagrid had noticed and gave me a weird glance.
When I went to my safe place during torture, I saw her. Somehow I had summoned her in my mind, the fact that she left to go find me and had shown up where I was proved that she wasn’t just a figment of my imagination. I pushed away a stray piece of her hair from her face and let myself indulge looking at her despite feeling guilty.
The last time I was at the ministry of magic was a very unpleasant one, so I felt chills go down my spine walking back into the familiar building. Memories of the horrid day we lost Sirius ran through my mind making me waver in my desire to be there for Severus. I had assumed I was over it, but my breaths started coming in quicker and the oxygen in the large building seemed to drop.
"I'm here on his orders actually. My task was to keep him from doing anything useful for the day , apparently he thinks someone's trying to find something that belongs to him. Not sure why he would think that." Draco said with a shrug. I froze realizing the Dark Lord could tell I was messing with the horcruxes. It never occurred to me he knew when one was moved, but I hoped he didn't realize Severus took off his pocket watch. That would put us both in danger very fast.
What I felt for him wasn't logical, but it was there. My mind wandered back to Riddles comments about me being an empath.
"Is that so? Well it's clear to me that the law only applies to those that don't hold a seat on the election board that keeps you in power. Finnely was one of your staunchest supporters and part of the reason you were elected, was he not? Clearly the law doesn't apply to him." Severus said silkily, his voice so smooth it could cut ice. The judge's jaw dropped a bit and he stammered for words shuffling his papers.
"The stress would make you get wrinkles. You couldn't keep a rich wizard with wrinkles you know." I was saved from blowing up at her by the library doors slamming open.
Ginny dragged me up the stairs, her excitement quite intense for someone who just wanted to get me to sleep more.
She was my weakness, my kryptonite I didn't know I had. I had fallen for her and didn't even realize it. I was so foolish to have thought I could keep my distance. It was impossible. Much as Lucius couldn't stop himself from pursuing her, I couldn't stop myself from falling in love with her.
"Oh, but I do. I have you." He said standing up stalking to me dangerously. I didn't fear many things in life, but I felt more than a twinge of fear piecing together where this was going.
“She’s in love with Weasley.” I said angrily pacing the room again in the familiar path I took when I was stressed.
I left quietly to my rooms to get out the booze. Never a better time than now to get smashed and forget who I was.
“Hermione, stay behind will ya?” He asked me gruffly. I started to feel nervous worrying Snape had told him about everything with how secretive he was being.
"Of, of course your honor. Yes. The same legal system that did nothing when I reported the broken bones Elijah came back with after every vacation, every break. The bruises that were ignored and my countless pleas for assistance ignored." Severus said harshly, his lighthearted attitude gone for the first time since he was arrested. The mood in the room shifted and whispers floated down the stadium style seats.
"AGH!" I was so bored and sleepy I had walked right around the corner and into someone knocking them over.
"Shhh." He said silkily, leaning over me slightly. My mind went to dangerous inappropriate places seeing him in his full death eater robes and mask and with him clearly in full control mode.
‘Severus…please. I need your help. I just don’t have the expertise.” The headmaster asked again. Snape looked at him finally taking his attention off me. After a long moment he nodded seeming to finally understand whatever the headmaster was hinting at that was so important.
"It seems you and I will have a very fruitful relationship to come." He announced the wicked thoughts he was having apparent for everyone in the room.
"Make your breakfast then get to class." He said backing up lost in his thoughts before turning to leave. I barely caught him before he got out of the office.
“How the fuck do you get them to submit like that?” One of the masked men asked from not too far away from me. I blushed and tried to get dressed ashamed, but Snape stopped me with a quick slap.
"POTTER! WHAT THE FUCK...nevermind, come here girl." He said grabbing me roughly evidently just realizing Harry wasn't dead. I fought against him, but he dragged me, throwing me at the feet of Dumbledore, who was bound by what looked like thick green snakes around his hands and his feet. He was floating in the air suspended, but he was calm even as he faced his death.
"Is something wrong Severus?" The headmaster asked me closing the book he was reading and peering at me calmly, his lack of emotion pissing me off. I slammed my hands on his desk. I probably shouldn't have, but it was that or I would deck him.
"No. Harry, please..." I said crying instantly, my heart entirely crushed and I fell over him desperate for him to live.
"No. She's not. I went through her memories to make sure. What you saw must stay between you and I, understand? I had your back, now you must have mine. A wizard's word is unbreakable." I told him firmly stressing how important this was to him. He nodded empathetically, his eyes wide at the seriousness of the order.
"Of course you were. Now though…my family is very traditional. I don't think they could accept…" He said unable to actually finish the sentence due to his immaturity assuming we had gone further than we had. I rounded on him fast not in the mood to deal with his crap.
“Thank you Minerva, if you don’t mind I would like to speak to Hermione alone.” He asked her kindly. She gave a flustered huff and gave me one last annoyed glance before leaving us alone.
"Because the Headmaster asked me to. I'm sure there's a valid reason." Professor McGonagall said, her own tone disproving. They didn't have time to argue. The Dark Lord's ranks came forward, their masks on and wands out.
Life continued on over the next few weeks giving me a break from his drama. When we had our training sessions together he kept everything perfectly professional and made no comment to our night escape. During classes he was predictably jerkish and docked points as usual for every little infraction.
"I suppose so. Though strangely enough you seem reluctant to oblige." I said getting up and sitting in his lap. His shock was tangible, but he adjusted quickly , his hands wrapping around my waist protectively.
I should have known he was well endowed with how tall he was, but it still surprised me how big he was when erect. I moaned into the kiss and moved so I was facing him. He pulled me down harder to him, his force so much stronger than my own. I should have felt some sort of panic, but every instinct in me just melted at his command letting him do anything he wanted to me.
“Why would you keep mine? You never keep any. It’s not like you would need it that often, right? How often can he possibly torture his own followers?” I asked confused. He was still drinking the bottle I gave him and stood up waving me to the fireplace ignoring my question entirely.
“Where I want to be forever. Your arms of course.” I said relishing the freedom of being able to be with her without guilt. Without worrying about other people’s desires. It was serenity.
"Severus, I have some important matters to discuss." He said urgently. I passed the lines of students making sure to take extra measures to ignore Hermione.
“I understand. But you can’t use the same tactics with Granger as you would a one night stand. You have to be kind to her. Woo her.” He explained as if this should be common knowledge.
All I could remember was the pain. So much pain.  Never-ending pain that flowed in endless currents through my whole body.
"Coming into class." She said unsurely after a moment. So it wasn't a long term thing, just short term. That was a relief at least. I walked to her slowly pulling her up against me savoring her warmth after such a troubling day. Her smile returned and she looked so innocent having no idea how close she had gotten to death in her stubbornness and Gryffindor recklessness.
Of course it is. They are homophobic, racist, narcissists, but they are just people. People don't join the Dark Lord for the pleasure of being associated with insanity. They want to be a part of a family usually. It's a very deceptive and enticing offer for many people.
"She's normally very sweet, pregnancy makes her mental though." Severus said drinking the hot chocolate slowly, enjoying the warmth.
We got to the great hall just in time. Granger was reading the paper and I could hear some of the whispers going through the hall with laughter as I stepped in. I wanted to curse every single one of them that was saying anything mean to her, but I knew I couldn't. I had to act natural.
"Voldemort is at the ministry of magic. He is demanding complete power, the Headmaster and Snape already left. Harry and Ron are about to leave, I was hoping I would get to day bye, but thought you might have left with Snape." She said all in a rush. My veins filled with ice realizing we were out of time.
"Knew what specifically?" He asked quirking his head trying to read my mind without actually reading it. He never dared to actually go through my thoughts.
I woke up sore from head to toe, every inch of me aching with the lingering pain from the cruciatus curse. I tried to move to get some of the soreness from my muscles out, but my eyes shot open instantly feeling a lump next to me.
I had never felt anything but dull annoyance for my students. I couldn’t deny though that feeling her fit perfectly against me, remembering the kiss we shared was almost enough to wake her up in the most evil of ways.
"Ron, let her be. Not today, okay? You can argue about this another time." Harry said gratefully coming to my defense. Ron thankfully knew what was good for him and let me move past to get ready. I grabbed my things and went to the shower desperate for some hot water and to feel clean again.
"Perfect, let's give yours a try, shall we?" I snapped, grabbing a glass flask and filling it quickly with some of his beautification potion.
The look in his eyes had been relief, like he could finally relax now that he had found me. Was it possible that he felt some sort of affection for me now that we shared magic?
Snape knew what he was doing and his confidence teased me into a relaxed state I didn’t know I wanted to be in. His kiss was deep and controlling leading me down a path there wasn’t any going back from. It was wrong. He was my teacher.
"When your father died? And you always wear it?" I asked nervously. He fed me a bite of the french toast. It was absolutely divine and erased the icky feeling the watch gave me instantly.
I watched him sleep and couldn’t help but smile at how non intimidating he was like that. He had made it a point to make my life hell for years, but the way he had gasped my name before collapsing had made that all seem like such a distant past.
“Yes, well, do you do personal checks on all your students that skip or just the ones you kiss?” I asked him crudely wanting him to leave. I had been doing so good trying to ignore his existence. Him existing was messing it up. I tried to go back to my book, but he slammed my book shut almost shutting it on my fingers in his anger.
I let him finish dressing me in silence, my head falling to my chest not wanting to see the room and trying to block out the comments I heard from the onlookers. Whatever trance he had put me under was entirely broken and reality seemed to settle around me. He tipped my chin up when he was finished dressing me and I could see the smallest of smiles flitter across his lips.
“What? I didn’t use my magic! I used my fist!” I said indignantly holding up my bruised and quickly swelling fist. Even I wasn’t that stupid to use magic when so angry. He had the audacity to chuckle at this once he recovered from his shock.
Yet I knew watching her be with anyone besides me would kill me now. She was supposed to be mine. I always thought the war would be the death of me. Here I was completely oblivious to the real threat right in front of me.
My racing heart skipped more than a few beats as relief overwhelmed me and I sat back letting her sit up. She was alive.
"She's an empath." I said watching his reaction. I expected guilt, but he actually seemed surprised.
Harry caught sight of me and came to me relieved. He was in his pajamas and his hair a right mess, but he was somehow adorable in his sleepy state.
“You still haven’t explained how you ended up like this.” The Headmaster said sitting down in the armchair, the stress showing on his old wrinkled features. I had noticed earlier that his hand was blackened, but I was silent. It looked dead and disgusting, generally only dark evil curses could do such a thing to someone. Snape coughed a bit clearing his throat getting my attention.
"Good. The house elves will be able to make it for you anytime you wish. Just remember they want to be tipped accordingly." He advised me referring to the manor he was leaving for me on his death. The cold gold ring hung around my neck as always and I found myself fidgeting with it at the very thought.
“Leave it to you to give me a death hug after I finally escape alive.” He said sarcastically, his voice was raw and yet barely above a whisper. I didn’t have to ask to know he had been tortured again.
“I have spent the nighttime studying curses and spells to protect Harry and I. Don’t act like you don’t know where this war is headed Professor.” I said quietly watching his stern expression with a mixture of my own curiosity now. He raised an eyebrow to this.
I said to her using our connection trying to act as casual as possible walking towards her. She crumpled the paper in her hand beyond furious and stalked towards us.
"Hermione is practicing the dark arts. It's not my foray obviously so I was hoping you could talk to her. I'm rather concerned. She's been seeming stressed lately and has been ignoring her friends. All the signs that generally lead to the dark arts." He explained. I let out an amused chuckle at his ignorance.
“I suppose your right…a boy wouldn’t want a bookworm…a man though…” She said trailing off with her own knowing smile. I choked a bit on my hot chocolate realizing her innuendo. She seemed so sweet and innocent.
“Using a spell on a potion knowing full well it is banned…bold even for you Granger.” He said the moment we were alone.
The thought was hilarious. Here I was sure I was totally incompetent with everything in life and the darkest wizard ever felt nervous with me touching him scared I would try to kill him most likely.
“I will teach you…if…you never touch one of these books again. You can stay after class on Mondays.” He said holding up the dark arts book.
It was only then that I remembered the hundreds of students and teachers watching in total and utter silence, their mouths quite wide open.
My hand grazed over his mark and I could feel the dark energy coming from it, twisting and turning around my hand. I broke off our kiss and I leaned down kissing the mark gently my feelings made clear. I didn't care about the mark, he was exactly what I wanted.
"You realize you're a death eater." I said plainly. I loved him, that much I was sure of. I knew though the horrible acts he had committed and I couldn't help the small worry that he was just using me. He manipulated the most brilliant wizards I had ever met and then just went about his day as if it were nothing.
I didn’t even mean to think it to her, but I knew she recognized the thought because her smile fell a bit.
"It's complicated. Aren't you worried about you-know-who finding out you're hanging out together?" I said quietly surprised to see them being so blatantly open even though there were only a few other students staying over break. Draco waved me off moving his chess piece.
"You have to eat something Hermione!" Harry urged me putting more food on my plate at lunch. Professor Snape was nowhere to be found at the head table much to my relief. I pushed around the food uninterested in the mixture of steak and vegetables they gave, my appetite nonexistent.
My curiosity was piqued even more realizing where we were headed. We weren't going towards the doors outside, but rather the astronomy tower.
"Nevermind. What is the last thing you remember?" I asked worrying how deeply the memory issue went.
"Well...maybe I didn't do so great." He admitted unwillingly. I smirked and handed the glass vial to Hermione. She stared at it shocked for a split second before taking it.
“So, show them what this side is capable of to build a better support system for ourselves?” I asked. Snape nodded.
“Thanks.” I muttered not opening it and just leaning exhausted against one of the cauldrons I had put on the floor to clean after I got tired of standing. He opened his mouth to chastise me again, but the fire in his fireplace turned green and in a second Malfoy Sr. stepped through.
“I’m fine.” I insisted, but by the time I got out of the common rooms Lavender had shoved Ron after me.
"It would be worth it." Harry blushed but smiled a bit trying to hide his embarrassment behind his drink.
“Not for the reasons you think though. I regret you not getting to make the same decisions you made there in your own room. I regret not being able to have you so relaxed you were moaning with pleasure, sweating from how hard your heart was beating, begging me for more.” He said simply, his eyes grazing my body slowly as he explained. My heart started beating so fast I was sure I was going to have a heart attack. I could only imagine how red my cheeks were. He brushed my hair out of my face and pulled my chair to his without asking.
I didn't expect him to jump at my offer so quickly, but it was like every part of him had been just waiting for me to be ready.
"Why do we keep doing this?" I spun around and almost spun into her not realizing how close she was. Her lavender shampoo wafted up at me teasing me.
I loved it. It was so perfect for me, it was as if it was designed just for me. I walked along the bookshelves touching the old tombs, letting my fingers drift over them and smelling the crisp parchment that they contained.
“I wont forgive myself. This wasn’t how its supposed to go. I have done worse than tonight’s deed so many times I lost count. I don’t even register it half the time. Its impersonal and serves a purpose.” I explained trying to articulate without giving details since I knew he was squeamish knowing exactly what I had to do to keep my cover. He hummed peering at me over his glasses.
"He definitely takes care of himself. No complaints there." I said knowing I was blushing furiously remembering his well toned chest. Her eyes went wide.
“What, have nothing smart to say now?” He asked louder with a smirk earning himself a few snickers from the Slytherins.
I hadn't expected him to hit me at all. He seemed just as stunned. His anger evaporated in a second, horror written across his face. It was strange, he was such a guarded person, but when he fucked up it showed in every inch of his body.
"I see. Are you not able to feel that it was cursed by Voldemort, or do you just not care? How on earth would you find a missing diadem anyways? Did you want even more knowledge? Is this how you've been passing all your classes?" She ranted hotly, her normally pale cheeks red with fury.
"It's always been part of the plan. A final fuck you to the Dark Lord. Lately though the plan has taken on more meaning. I know how much he means to you." He said with a bit of a grin musing at how ironic it would be for the Dark Lord to be killed off by some kids and his most trusted servant. Irony was bright in this plan.
"Somewhat. They are a bit early I think, though someone took my pocket watch so I can't be sure." He said with a pointed glare at me without any real venom.
"Of course My Lord. A deal is a deal." He said formally, giving a small bow. Voldemort waved us in and welcomed us to the feast.
I woke up with a start sure I wasn't alone. Ginny had been rooming with some other girls after my kiss with Severus so I should have been the only one in the dark room, but I heard a small shuffle near the door.
Snape came up behind me quietly and carefully placed his hand over mine on the wand. He was so close to me I could feel his breath on my neck. His hand slid almost instinctively to my hip, pulling me to him gently.
“Go? No. Stay. I can’t live without you Miss. Granger.” I said panicking feeling her try to leave. I clung to her tightly, but she wiggled away knowing my greatest fear was hurting her so I would never keep her in my grasp for long.
“All I’m saying is, be careful with her. She seems tough, but she has the weight of the world on her shoulders right now. One little breeze can knock her over.” He warned me, then left leaving me with dark thoughts.
The conversation was easy with them throughout the evening and I felt more at home than I ever had at Hogwarts. I didn't understand why they accepted me with open arms considering I was a muggleborn, but they all talked to me with such a respect I could almost believe the farce. Almost.
“She did?” I asked, surprised how I could have made her cry. She was tortured for an hour and had stayed silent the whole time. I had barely even insulted her. I could be so much more cruel than I had been to her.
"Clearly. Incendio!" Draco said decisively, trying to light the diadem on fire. It didn't work. I could still feel the dark magic calling to me.
"What are you doing?" My mother said coming in waking from her endless lines of naps. I felt a bit of relief. She would protect me at least. She looked at me and was horrified.
"I didn't want the magic from the ring to interfere with the healers spells. I think it's time I do this properly anyways." He explained getting down on one knee making my already overpowered heart stammer.
"Don't worry. I'm just kidding. If I thought for a second I would survive the war though...well you would already be quite knocked up." He confessed with a shrug thinking about it. It took me a bit to get my bearings realizing the magnitude of what he said. He had said he loved me, but I kind of figured it was the heat of the moment type thing. He was over here clearly wishing he could spend forever with me and I couldn't even say I loved him back. He didn't seem to care or need my confirmation.
"You see my faithful servant. I have noticed changes in you. Your temper has been more erratic lately. I can feel her energy pulsing around yours not mingling, just dancing with it taunting me. The moment she came of age I knew she was one." He said reaching out to touch me but stopping just short. I knew some wizards could feel power, but he had never admitted he was one. It made sense now why he was obsessed with purity. People who could feel the power usually became obsessed with it, feeling the many varieties and temperaments of magic.
“Do you think he invented them?” Harry asked curiously glaring at a picture we passed that was wagging their finger at us disapprovingly.

My hands went cold seeing Voldemort’s smile and I didn’t even have time to prepare before I was hit with his first curse.
“You are a pawn in the Headmaster's game. Same as Potter. Same as I. So when I say I don’t give a fuck if I cross a line of decency, realize I mean it.” He said with the upmost sincerity. I felt conflicted. One side of me wanted to follow the rules and ignore Snape, but the other side heard the truth in his statements and was so pissed I would have done anything wrong just to anger the headmaster.
"Ah, look! Severus's pet has lost its way." Lucius said, finding me with his gang of cronies quite drunk if his stumbling was any indicator. I felt my breath hitch knowing this was trouble.
“Don’t touch me.” I snapped daring him to try again. I would love nothing better than to try some of my curses on him. He chuckled darkly.
"Oh shut up woman. The only reason you didn't die too was because I didn't want to leave Elijah an orphan. I picked the worst of the two evils to eliminate. You stood by while your husband hurt your child and did nothing." Severus said darkly, the coldness in his tone silencing her and making her drawback afraid.
“This goes no further than between the three of us Miss. Granger.” Snape warned me, ignoring my question. That meant yes for sure. I felt sick.
"I think the Dark Lord killed your father Severus." I said hesitantly. He had the slightest smirk and he leaned on the counter opposite of me folding his arms.
His lips were on mine before I could register him leaning in and I felt my next scream muffled by him.
“Levimus.” He said confidently. The mouse slowly rose up and turned upside down rotating silently in place. It was disturbing to watch, but I needed to learn someway. He released his spell and ushered me to go forward and give it my shot.
The brick mansion was large and steady, and when we went inside the grey brick transformed to a beautiful white marble floor that gleamed. The entrance hall was massive and held a huge glass chandelier above it, reflecting the pristine white surface back on itself.
He toyed with his wand relishing my panic. I looked to Snape, but he stood there motionless. I could tell he was as surprised and frightened where this was going based on his cold empty mask he wore when he was holding back.
"I forgot the fairy wings." Potter admitted suddenly, more panicked at the thought of someone else taking the potion.
“I take it you were with Voldemort?” He asked sympathetically having noticed my shaking from the crucio curse after effects.
I slowly poured my ingredients for my cruciatis curse healing potion in my cauldron watching them simmer slowly. We were working on potions we had designed ourselves, which was going as expected of course. Neville had burned something that smelled like rotten eggs, Harry was trying to keep his cauldron from overflowing, and Ron wasn’t even bothering to put anything in his boiling water.
I went immediately to the spells section and looked for anything that could help me in my task. I was looking to explore the idea of using existing spells to combat multiple people at once and I was sure there had to be a workaround.
His face was a pale white and he looked at me calmly, a small smile spreading on his face despite being clearly pained.
“Clean all the cauldrons by hand.” He said scribbling violently on a paper he was grading taking out his annoyance on the scroll.
"I'm sorry...I shouldn't have touched it...it called to me...I wasn't strong enough to resist." I said with a choked whisper playing on the dramatics as much as possible.
"Getting into trouble yourself eh? Better be careful Snape doesn't find out. He's quite possessive." Draco said amused. I scoffed at this almost walking into a statue in my sleepy state.
"Maybe I want a bit of trouble." She shouldn't have opened the door. I had too much to drink also and everything about her taunted me. Watching Lucius kiss her had made my blood boil and I knew I wanted to claim her in every way. I wanted her to be mine.
My potion was one of the few in the room that didn’t have gooey sludge in the works besides Draco of course. I had ten minuets before my potion would be ready for the next ingredient so I took a deep breath watching the blond bully glance at Harry between making his own potion.
"I just came back from sneaking to the quidditch patch with Harry." He said casually as if this was the most obvious thing in the world. He looked me up and down taking in my tired state.
After what felt like forever I took a deep breath and pushed my racing thoughts away needing to focus on getting back to Snape. I tried to wind my way through the many halls, but every time I was sure I was in the right place I would end up back where I started. It was like they were enchanted to keep me lost.
“I’m fine Albus. I just mouthed off about how needed I was, and well, he seemed to despise that fact even if he agreed since I’m still alive.” Snape explained as vaguely as humanly possible.
"I got lost!" I said defensively taking a step back. He grabbed my arm roughly and dragged me down the hall towards the room everyone was in.
"A year without him trying to kill me. Refreshing." Harry said way too happy to accept the rapid change of pace.
“So feisty. You know…the Dark Lord has been asking for a way to terrorize the little brat. Stealing his girlfriend and torturing her would do quite nicely.” He mused backing up to discuss with Snape.
"Sorry, I tried to go to bat for you. Obviously I know most of the article is garbage." Lupin said breaking the silence.
"You think Granger is an empath? There's no evidence to support that Dark Lord. She talented sure, but there would be other signs… not to mention there hasn't been one in many generations." I said shaking my head wondering if he lost it. His sneer grew in darkness and humor.
I grabbed the stool and reached up to grab it. Even with the stools extra height my fingers barely grasped the worn book. If I was just two inches taller…
"Thanks." She said out of breath, but the success was quickly forgotten as another death eater attacked. It took everything in me to keep cursing dancing around the quick shots of light in all directions.
“I may be a mudblood, but at least I know penough to put the mandrake root in AFTER the unicorn tears to remove the effects of the cruciatis curse.” I said softly finally bringing my eyes up to meet his after gathering my strength. He had made a comment two classes prior about the current potions for that specific curse being so mild you didn’t even bother using them. The original formula was one of his own izealnvention so I knew the insult burned like a hot knife.
"What do you need wolf? It's nowhere near a full moon for your potion." I said not wanting to go into the countless reasons I was most certainly not the hero in this war.
Draco looked at me like I lost my mind, but I also earned myself an admiring glance from Harry who just loved to see Snape suffer in any way.
“Bonding with her? She hates you Severus. Maybe you should try not insulting her for a few days if you want her to not hate you.” Minerva said with a sardonic laugh.
Nothing would work with the combination she drank. Who would invest an antidote to a slightly mis brewed potion anyways?
"Hello Granger. I hope Severus here has been treating you right?" Narcissa asked with what could be considered a kind yet formal tone. She tossed her light blond hair behind her, her dress beautiful and shimmering gold as opposed to my pure white one.
"You should know by now who you are...what you are. There isn't a spell to fix me yet. I want you to create one and do it for me." He said, his vanity evident in the obsessive way he recalled his former beauty. I couldn't blame him, I wouldn't want to look like a snake either. My mind flashed back to the countless failed lessons with Snape trying to create even the most basic of spells, and he wanted me to fix his entire body disfigurement?
“You helped me when I was in a bad place finding me. I got you out of the Dark Lords grasp mostly unscathed. We are even Granger, don’t flatter yourself to think otherwise.” I said harshly. I wanted to bond with her, but the way she looked at me made my desires too hard to keep at bay. I couldn’t encourage her too much without risking hurting her. She was quiet for a moment.
“AND…and…your not thinking straight.” I said stammering loosing my focus as his hands traveled across my skin igniting a fire within me. Why was this a bad thing again?
“Boys. Its been a long night. I will make sure Miss. Granger makes it to her bunks safely.” The headmaster said trying to get some privacy for us. I didn’t look at either of them as they left. I was transfixed by how sweet and innocent her round face was. Remembering the trusting way she leaned back when I told her to knowing the moment I saw her face I wouldn’t be able to control myself. I was a demon.
"You took a contraceptive potion, right?" She asked more seriously. Every single thought in my mind stopped in that very moment. Her eyes couldn't possibly have gotten any wider.
"She's nineteen thanks to the time turner actually that you gave her. With my potions my age stopped changing in my twenties. Its unconventional, yes I have to admit that...but if you want me to apologize I won't." I told her firmly not caring if she never spoke to me again. I was dying soon anyways, the least concession she could give me was to make Hermione smile like she did in the picture at least one more time.
I didn't have the chance to stop and think, he kissed me deeply, drowning out my thoughts, overpowering any objection I would have come up with.
"Do you think I'm an empath?" I asked, taken aback still by Riddles soul ramblings. I wanted to believe it was just him trying to manipulate me into wearing the diadem to possess me or something, but I knew reality wise his admiration and excitement had been genuine.
Even if that wasn’t enough it was his dark black eyes that seemed so dark yet this close I could see an almost playfulness left in their depths. Something you could only see up this close, which only made it more enticing.
"Please don't tell anyone. Harry would be...I can't let him know I failed." I said horrified at the very thought. He had been lost in thought, but his snake like eyes flickered back to me, his smile returning.
