again, not after the friendship they’d developed.
you can’t turn someone into a table with a potion?”
“Professor,” Draco greeted her with a polite nod and a tight smile, resisting the urge to grimace as heads turned at the sound of his name. She laughed, patting his shoulder and grinning at him fondly. He could smell Firewhisky and Butterbeer and he had a sneaking suspicion that she was very,
“Oh don’t you look precious!” Molly cooed, hurrying down the path to greet them. She was wearing a very detailed cardboard pumpkin costume and Harry wondered, not for the first time, why he was dressed up as a snitch.
“Not long enough,” he muttered, as she helped herself to one of Draco’s drinks. She laughed, high-pitched and over the top, resting her hand on his arm.
Draco had sand all over him.
This could be his chance to beat Potter, to finally get one over him and prove Potter wasn’t as invincible as the Wizarding World seemed to think he was. He should have known it would be impossible to break his tradition of losing to Potter.
nonsense now, it’s Minerva to you.” She gestured inside, where Draco could already see the press swarming towards the door like seagulls honing in on a discarded chippy carton. “Harry’s in there somewhere. Hasn’t stopped talking about you all day, the silly goose.” There was a knowing glint in her eyes and Draco did his best to stomp down the hope that bubbled in his chest at her words.
“And what does this board game involve?” The only board games wizards had were chess and a strange version of drafts played with miniature quaffles and snitches - this ‘Cluedo’ sounded rather interesting.
“They’re very responsible,” she insisted, staring Potter down and making Draco very glad he hadn’t refused a lunch invite. “They don’t need help. Besides, with you we have a perfect number of players.”
Potter.
As he approached the cafe he could see the staff cleaning and quickened his pace, hoping and praying that it was still there. He hadn’t realised how close it was to closing time and he hoped he wasn’t too late.
when he was surrounded by the children. He wasn’t foolish enough to throw such an opportunity away and he shook Potter’s hand, cherishing the warmth of his palm against Draco’s own.
Ms. Gallagher was overjoyed to hear that Draco was bringing children over. She was a painting that had come with the house and an 18th-century farmer’s wife who took great joy in mothering him excessively and criticising his eating habits. Her favourite past time was pestering Draco about starting a family and following him from portrait to portrait around the house, insisting that he wasn’t getting any younger. She was a pain in the arse most days, but he was certain he would have gone insane without her incomprehensible nattering while he brewed in his lab.
He could see the outline of one of the plaques on the steps as he entered the building, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to take a proper look at it. It already felt wrong to be setting foot on Hogwarts’ grounds after the part he played in the war, he didn’t think he’d make it inside if he read the name someone on his side of the war had killed.
And, of course, they were
“These two need hot chocolate and biscuits to distract them, they don’t enjoy shopping very much.” Judging by the weary look on Harry’s face, he didn’t either.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
They all said their goodbyes and then Neville went to talk to professor Sprout; Ginny, Dean and Seamus headed down to the carriages and Hermione took Ron with her to say goodbye to Flitwick. Harry would have followed, but professor McGonagall called him back:
“Don’t ask questions, Draco,” said his mother.
Malfoy scoffed.
“Is that what you think?” she said.
Harry had a hard time believing that Malfoy’s friends would abandon him after a fight if they had stuck with him until this point. And though Harry had noticed Malfoy’s exclusion from his usual pack of Slytherins, the otherwise alert system of gossip within Hogwarts hadn’t picked up on it, which meant the fight, whatever it had been about, couldn’t have been too dramatic.
“No, it’s not.”
It was three days ago that he and Potter had trained with the Dementor-boggart. Three days since he’d kissed him, and Draco hadn’t had a chance to talk to him since. He had been going up to the secret room a couple of times, on the off chance that Potter might be there, but he never was and instead Draco had had two very awkward conversations with Potter’s friends of mumbled excuses for why he had come and would now leave again. They said there was something Granger wanted him to look at, so he supposed he would have to deal with that at some point, but at the moment he had told them he was busy.
They mounted their brooms. Draco kicked off and was the first one in the air, the others took a little longer before their passengers were settled and they followed. Draco flew ahead, leading them as close to the small house as he dared. Then he turned and they left the mainland, flying straight out over the ocean.
Her wand whipped through the air and the curse took him by surprise. He didn’t know she could do non-verbal spells.
“I’m not concerned that you’re talking to him because of your childish rivalry, Harry.”
“That sounds… right,” she said, pulling the book towards her. “But for that to work – there are hundreds of prisoners in Azkaban. It would be impossible to cast enough patronuses to shield all of them.”
He turned to Jansson and Belby.
"Anyway," Harry said quickly, "what do you guys do?"
“But that’s what they all have in common, isn’t it? That’s why they keep to themselves like that.”
“Sorry, then. I was just trying to-“
Harry slipped between two students in front of him, reaching the table but getting out of earshot of his friends. He picked up two of the shiny, green beetles from a big jar on the table.
“It was.”
“Here,” she said.
“Well, Lovegood suggested, that a horn from the- what did she call it?” he reached for the notes.
“Dad, can you hear me?” Draco said.
”You were screaming your head off…”
Nott returned to his book and Draco headed towards Professor McGonagall’s classroom.
“I just found out that a lot of it’s pretty much Herbology. It just means I can figure out the ingredients, I still mess up the on rest.”
“Right. Potter – I can’t believe you’ve actually ensnared him with your tragic tales.”
He looked at Draco.
"Well, being good at Quidditch in school isn't the same as playing professionally," said Harry.
"We've uh… known each other a long time," he said.
“So you do think you’re one of the heroes?”
"I know, Potter," he said. "Everyone knows. I also couldn't care less."
“Really? And he’s still going along with it?”
Draco nodded.
“Okay, well, whatever happened, I reckon you should apologize to her. She gets much better when you talk to her about things than if she’s just left alone. Then she might just explode in your face out of nowhere a week later.”
“Nox,” he whispered.
"Be right back," he said.
Malfoy had already pushed open the door, holding it open awkwardly, and for a second Harry considered just taking that opportunity; rushing out and going home and pretending none of this had happened. He couldn't do that though. He needed to get this done. And then he could go home and never think about it again.
Pansy shrugged.
Harry wishes he could feel that certain about Dumbledore’s intentions.
Also, he had definitely not considered that when he insisted he wouldn't wait outside, that meant he would end up in Malfoy's bedroom.
“I want to.”
“I’m sorry, I honestly didn’t think-”
It was past midnight when Draco slid silently out of bed. He got dressed but didn’t put on his shoes until he was out of the dormitory and had pushed the door closed behind him. Pansy was already waiting for him in the common room. She stood up when she saw him
“Oh shoot, I’m sorry! I was being an
He picked up his cup and went to sit down on the couch. Malfoy stayed on the sill and lit another cigarette. There were a couple of newspapers spread out on the coffee table.
When Draco reached him, he immediately turned to walk down the stairs.
“Whatever you say. Please let me go up to my dorm now,” he said. “The others are asleep, right?”
"I've been telling you that forever."
A charred log snapped in the fireplace, sparks flying up from the embers, and they both started. Harry realized how loud they had been. The common room was dark and quiet around them.
“Pretty dumb to cast a shield that only protects from dark curses.”
He lay down, his legs trailing behind Draco’s back. Draco waved his wand at the lights, and they went out. The room dissolved in shadows. He allowed himself a second in the dark, sitting on the edge of the sofa and listening to Potter’s breathing. Then he pulled up his feet and lay down next to him. There was space enough that he could have kept an inch between them. He didn’t.
"I see," he said.
Then Pansy put the wand away, and Ginny turned away from her, pushing back a lock of her sweaty hair and the moment had passed.
“Neville and I can do the runes by ourselves,” said Lovegood. “You three head for the pit.”
“Not really,” said Harry.
“Thank you.”
Ron and Ginny laughed, Hermione cracked a smile and Harry looked from one to the other, not sure what it was that was funny.
“No. I’m not. He isn’t just some mean, spoiled brat anymore; he’s emotionally amputated – no, listen to me! He’s been a Death Eater since he was sixteen, that’s not just being a bully, that’s wanting people like me killed, and he did. He tried to kill people. There’s something deeply wrong with him, Harry.”
His father looked at him, or looked over him or through him. Draco felt sick. Narcissa let go of his hand to kneel in front of the corpse of a man. When she spoke her voice was soft and soothing. She told him that she and Draco had been pardoned. That they still had the manor and most of their assets, and everything was all right. It smelled terrible in the cell. There was a drain in the floor.
“She’s good with words.”
“With my luck, the castle would be overtaken by feral nargles the first time I ever tried a sleeping potion.”
It could have been sarcastic, but there was no edge in his voice.
Draco cleared his throat.
The students starting their second year were the smallest class in Hogwarts history.
“We can do it the Slytherin way.”
“Good,” said Harry quickly, knowing he had probably looked horrified for a moment.
He didn't know why Malfoy wasn't hanging up either.
“If you’re looking for something to do, Harry, then there is still all that stuff in the attic. We need to get it cleared out at some point,” Hermione added.
They left the hospital wing and walked most of the way back to Gryffindor tower in exhausted silence. Harry drank in the normalcy of being back in the corridors at Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione – even without the daily bustle of students, in the silent twilight hours before dawn when they were too drained to talk to each other, it still felt like coming home.
Potter finally lowered his hand, though he still looked just as belligerent.
Harry nodded.
There was a moment of silence. Harry listened for Ron and Hermione's voices. He couldn't hear them anymore.
he felt that way was that Uncle Vernon used to scoff at certain people in television, it was because of the way Petunia would talk about certain neighbours with other neighbours, it was because he remembered the tone Dudley used when he had called him those names.
He wondered how long it would be before Ron came looking for him. He was probably waiting for Harry to calm down. Or for Hermione to come home. He hated when they ganged up on him. He hated when they ganged up on him because they were worried. It made him feel like such a shit. He just didn't want to talk to them about it was all. He knew he was being stupid, them telling him he was being stupid just made it worse.
What part of ‘I want you there’ didn’t you understand?” He was laughing now and Draco could feel himself blushing.
He had no such luck, and, less than a minute after setting off down the street, someone was calling his name. Draco turned around to find Harry stood behind him, with two small children attached to either arm. He recognised the boy as his young cousin Teddy, who he had visited with his mother once or twice. “We’re heading to the cafe at the end of the street if you want to join us,” Harry said, adjusting his grip on the girl’s shoulder as she made an attempt to run off into the crowd.
to be a source of entertainment.
There was rustling on the bed next to him then a little nose pressed against his arm, reminding him why these past few weeks had been particularly bad. He lifted his arm up and a small, fluffy grey rabbit hopped onto his stomach. The rabbit snuggled down onto his chest, tucking his paws underneath his body and making a content clicking noise with his teeth. Harry smiled and gently scratched between his ears.
A picture was stuck to the next page. A young boy with blue hair and fluffy wolf ears—who must have been Teddy—was holding up a pumpkin cupcake to the camera. The man next to him was hugging Teddy to his side and Draco nearly gasped out loud when he registered that this ridiculously handsome man must be Harry.
Harry Potter.” Longbottom grinned and pointed across the grass, where Potter was kicking a ball about with the younger kids and making exaggerated dives. “He’s a softie, really. He isn’t interested in old grudges; he wants to move on from the war. That’s why he worked with McGonagall and the Board of Governors to set this camp up, so we can educate children about Muggle and Wizarding culture, and teach them skills that aren’t covered in the Hogwarts curriculum.”
Now that he thought about it, Draco’s affection seemed to be reserved only for Harry. On the few occasions where Hermione and Ron had visited their dorm, Draco had been skittish and shied away from being pet by them. He spent most of those visits curled up in Harry’s lap or in his arms, resting against Harry’s chest, head by his heart.
Draco would recognise that hair anywhere.
“I think you’d enjoy it,” Luna said with a smile. “It’s a muggle board game. We normally play them on Thursday nights on the tables outside, but I suppose it’s a bit too damp for that now, and drying charms don’t seem to like wet grass very much. Must be all the nargles.”
“Hermione’s right, you know,” Longbottom said. “You aren’t a
He was looking down at Teddy with a soft, affectionate smile that told Draco volumes about how much he loved the boy. He didn’t even need the diary to tell him how sweet Harry was when he had that picture.
The child - Jess or Jackie, he couldn’t remember - nodded and frowned, deep in thought. “Maybe that’s what I’ll do when I grow up. Invent the table potion.” She stood up and hurried across the grass to another blanket, waving goodbye to Draco and immediately engaging in a very intense conversation with her friends, presumably to inform them of her future plans and the benefits of a ‘table potion’. “
just there to see Harry. Luna was going to be there, and so was Blaise. He was going because it was a chance to catch up with some of his old classmates, he told himself, not to see if Harry looked as good in dress robes now as he had in fourth-year.
“For how long?”
He pulled his wand out of his pocket and lifted it to the door to lower his wards when he noticed a note had been stuck to the door. It was written on bright paper with little bees around the edge and Draco was quite certain that Luna was behind it.
He had been trying to catch up on the work he’d missed in the three weeks he’d spent in France looking after his mother, who’d fallen down the stairs in her home. Hermione had been a great help at first, but for the past few days, she’d been stuck fending questions about baby names and her due date from her mother-in-law, and hadn’t had the time to shove her notes down his throat. On top of worrying about his mother’s health and trying to study nearly a month’s worth of work alone, someone had spilt their coffee all over him and his laptop on the train and he’d lost half of his files. He’d carried more books back and forth from the library in the past four days than he had in his last three years at university.
Harry’s eyes widened. “That’s what Lavender and Bill used, isn’t it?” He asked. “That’s the potion Padma talked about, the one that controlled her urges around the full moon.”
He was saved from wandering the streets aimlessly by a very welcome voice shouting his name. Harry was leaning casually against the doorway, paint splattering his jeans and dust covering his hair. Draco had never wanted to kiss him more.
“You’re a Gryffindor. You’re all meant to be huggers.”
They were pressed close to each other, whispering and smiling together. Harry tilted his head back, laughing at something she had murmured into his ear. He had never looked so beautiful and unattainable. The pair moved around the dance floor, hands resting intimately on hips and shoulders, moving with a casual grace that made it clear just how familiar they were with each other’s bodies.
Draco shifted, his furry little nose twitching, and sat up. He kicked his front paws out like a tiny, fluffy boxer and started cleaning his face, pulling his ears down to lick them. Over the last two weeks Harry had learnt that a rabbit cleaning itself was the cutest thing on Earth. Watching Draco lick his adorable little paws and wash his face warmed Harry’s heart, and reminded him that there was still a piece of Draco inside the bunny Harry had been caring for. Even as a rabbit, Draco couldn’t bear to look anything less than perfect.
It was a peace offering. If Draco had known that all it would have taken was a silly board game, he would have taken more of in interest in Muggle culture at Hogwarts.
How could he have ever thought that Harry returned his feelings? How could he have allowed himself to get his hopes up? And really, how could a washed out, reclusive potions master compare to the perfect woman Harry was wrapped around?
asking questions.
Draco sighed, folding the little note back up and sending the little Elf owl on its way with a pat on the head and a treat. He should have closed the door in Potter’s face as soon as he realised who it was, Merlin knows the man only brought him trouble.
He'd hand it into one of the cafe employees before he left. Harry didn’t need to know Draco had read it.
They bowed and there was a brief period of hesitation where they merely stared into each other’s eyes, waiting for the other to make the first move. Draco could have stayed like that all day, staring into Potter’s rather captivating eyes.
” Draco retorted. “Besides, I doubt she’d be happy to have me in her home with our history.”
Luna nodded. “He teaches them how to duel safely so they can enjoy and defend themselves. He just wants the best for them, because he didn’t always have that growing up.”
“I’ll be back, Harry. Surely it could wait?” He apparated away without waiting for a reply and told himself he was imagining the disappointment on Harry’s face.
Luna reached out, grabbing his arm and yanking him back towards the group.
“Oh, do go fuck yourself, Rita dear, and let an old woman sit down.” Molly Weasley appeared at the bar next to Skeeter and none-too-gently shoved her off her seat, taking her place and waving down the bartender for a round of Firewhisky.
painted and Draco poked at the skirting board with his brush - telling him all about everything from the classes he was going to offer, to the extension charms he was using on the building, to potatoes he’d eaten at the Weasley house when he got back from the camp.
“I don’t need
Despite McGonagall’s best efforts, she had been unable to return him to his normal state because the spell had been so inexpertly cast and hadn’t responded to the usual reversal spells. She’d eventually made the decision to wait until the spell wore off itself, which she guessed would take anywhere from five days to a month.
Someone tapped Draco’s shoulder. Startled, he dropped the book and turned to face the person who’d interrupted him.
Draco was too late.
Draco reached down and picked a battered notebook off the floor. It was a bright red spiral notebook, with bits of paper and several photographs sticking out the pages. It was clear that the book was old and well-loved; the colour on the cover had started to fade and small chunks of the front cover were peeling off. He pushed the stuff that was sticking out back in and opened it, hoping the owner had written their name and perhaps their phone number so he could return it to them.
Luna had owled him a few times, to let him know that her blue-haired vine plants were growing at a rather alarming rate and that she had noticed Harry seemed to have a lot of Nargles buzzing around him recently. He had replied politely, doing his best to skirt around the subject of Harry - he couldn’t bear to go back to calling him
“It looks brilliant, Teddy.” That was true, of course, but it didn’t mean Harry had to like his boyfriend snake-ifying Teddy.
Teddy picked out a reindeer shaped biscuit that was bigger than Draco’s hand and the girl - Victoire, he learnt - settled for one that had been decorated as a Christmas tree.
An hour later Draco had barely made a dent in his work, his croissant was gone and the book was burning a hole in his pocket.
Teddy, his sweet, future-Hufflepuff godson, was dressed up as a
He had intended to make a quick exit after the duel, unwilling to stick around after his rather horrifying realisation and wanting nothing more than to hide away in his lab and drown himself in dusty old potion texts until he forgot all about Harry
“We were discussing his right to go to school! And you’re right, I don’t think he should be in Azkaban, I think he deserves to be forgiven by the school and by the court, but not by
He had his arms crossed and looked very much like he would prefer to have left with his friends. Draco waved his protest off.
He takes another step, close enough to be able to peek through the door.
Back at the table, Malfoy and Mark were still missing. Harry took his jacket from where he had hung it on the back of his chair. Irie looked up at him.
”Really?” he said. ”I thought that was the whole point of being in Gyffindor.”
“I never thought of it.”
“What?”
“Sure, what?”
They heard her footsteps on the stairs and a moment later she appeared in the kitchen in one of the nice sets of robes she usually wore to the ministry, her hair still damp from her bath. She always looked very adult when she was going to the Ministry. There was an unlikely, well rested air of responsibility about her that to Harry seemed unfair for anyone to possess at 19 and this early in the day.
“I was
“And I just – I really like him. And if keeping it from them is what it takes for him to want to be with me, then I’m fine with that. I’m happy with things as they are.”
"What?"
"I'll be quick, alright?"
“This isn’t about your
"Yes."
“Ron and Hermione live there too.”
them to persuade him to go. He cast a pleading look at Pansy - she knew how he felt about this, she could make them leave him alone. But Pansy just raised an eyebrow at him and there was no pity in her eyes.
“I suppose you’re the most experienced…” said Lovegood quietly.
“How much time did we lose?” asked Draco.
Malfoy shrugged.
As soon as they were through the door, he let go.
“What do you want?” she asked.
? Besides, the aurors are a Ministry organization, and I know your lot think you've taken over the whole thing by now, but it
“Hi,” he said.
Her eyes darted to him as she said it. Of course it was already obvious that the “unexpected complications” had quite a lot to do with house Malfoy losing what had previously been their almost absolute control over the paper, but he still had the strong, flickering impulse to hex her for being so indiscreet. She might have felt him tensing up, because she quickly continued talking:
“I would have done the same,” said Ron.
“Are your parents here?”
“Would you calm down?” he asked. “If I had known you treasured your personal space that much I wouldn’t have invaded, but that’s no need to get bloody violent.”
, what are you thinking-“
“The whole wizarding world knows you have terrible eyesight.”
“Yes. I’m- I'm terribly sorry for calling you so late. I hope I didn’t wake you up.”
They stand too close together in the quiet and the darkness of the attic room at the Burrow, not touching and not talking. Harry listens to Draco’s quiet breathing. He feels the weight of the fake horcrux around his neck. The wedding is tomorrow, and after that he and Ron and Hermione are leaving, and all of it is so incredibly unfair.
“Yes!”
“Are you tired?”
“You were sixteen, you were in over your head in something you didn’t fully understand, and a decision was made for you. It doesn’t matter how you felt about that decision – Draco, don’t look away, listen to me: It wasn’t your fault.”
She stood up and picked up the book, upsetting a couple of her notes.
“I had to. Goodnight Potter,” he said firmly.
“A little bit.”
His hands were curled into tight fists.
She raised her head.
“Have you ever been there, professor?” he asked.
“Back me up here, Harry,” he said. “They’re being fucking indecent.”
“I uh… I need to go back and get some new quills, actually,” he said.
“Honestly, I’m surprised that this wasn’t your first thought as well.”
“Because we’re not,” interjected Draco, still looking hard at her. “We’ve found out what to do about the dementors, yes, but there’s still the pit and whatever it’s doing to the tower, we still know nothing about that.”
“Weasley has insulted my family just as often as I have insulted his, that’s just mutual dislike. And the song was a tactical thing, I knew it would mess him up and I wanted my team to win.”
“Last night?”
"I was distracted," Malfoy said indignantly.
“That’s insane,” Ron said. “I’d rather spend all eternity digging through the backrooms of Borgin and Burke’s than ever have to look at his ferrety face again.”
“Sirius Black?”
When he reached the secret room, Malfoy was already there. He stood by the sofa next to a mountain of books that had been arranged into a couple of neat stacks on the low table. He had his back to the door and held a piece of parchment in his hands. His brow was furrowed, but a wry smile played around his lips, like he was reading some kind of private joke. He didn’t notice Harry coming in and Harry felt for a second like he had walked in on some private moment. He never saw Malfoy so unguarded, his narrow shoulders relaxed, for once not holding himself like he had a broomstick for a spine. Harry looked away. There was something strangely intimate about watching his quiet concentration.
She turned to Irie and Chris, who had stopped in the middle of whatever they had been doing and were staring wide eyed at the spectacle, at the spilled coffee and the screaming girl and Draco who stood frozen and silent in the middle of it.
a few years ago. They only made a few, since it’s pretty much the same broom just with a few adjustments.”
Draco shook his head almost imperceptibly. He walked with his eyes empty and fixed straight ahead, his hand resting against the doe’s flank, his wand held limply down his side.
"Uh… I don't?" Harry asked.
They glared at each other.
"Right, then," Malfoy said.
because of it.
“Well it was just a thought. Kissing is the sort of thing you do when you fancy someone.”
"No."
He practically kicked the door open in his hurry to get outside, and then slumped against the wall, dragging in breath after ragged breath, his eyes squeezed tightly shut. He felt like he was falling, like the world had dropped away from under him. His throat was painfully tight. He wasn't going to cry.
“Harry-”
“Wow, that’s… That doesn’t sound like her,” Harry said.
He hadn't known Chris was on this shift too. All those precious hours of sleep had been for nothing; the day would end in homicide after all.
Potter grimaced and slumped back against the wall. He really was very drunk, clumsy and heavy-limbed, still holding a beer in his hand that he should probably give up on. It ought to have made him less attractive, Draco thought, and yet somehow it didn't. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes unfocused, his movements badly coordinated, but all of it just meant he was leaning against the wall closer to Draco than he ever would have if he had been sober. Close enough their shoulders nearly touched, and Draco wished he hadn't noticed that because now those inches between them felt burning. He looked away and took another drag of his cigarette.
She looked at Neville and Ginny who half shrugged half nodded. Then she turned to Harry.
He had thought so too. He wasn’t sure how to navigate the tight hold of the hand on his shoulder. He scrambled clumsily back from the corpse, his limbs still felt weirdly disconnected from his mind.
“Tell Granger I’m sorry about Alain.”
“Sure. Pass me the orange juice?”
“Alright,” he said.
His voice still felt very close, and now Harry had to twist awkwardly to even look at him.
The Great Hall was half empty when he got there. His eyes skipped quickly to the Slytherins, but Malfoy wasn’t among them, which was a relief. He couldn’t see any of his friends at the Gryffindor table either, but Luna was sitting by herself at the Ravenclaw table reading the
“Yeah. She’s interning at The Prophet.”
“Don’t, Draco. If you want to roll over that’s fine, but I’m not going to sit here and listen to her telling lies about us.”
"How the hell have you been in London this whole time?”
"Why not? I can't keep carrying this shit around."
“Shut up, Potter,” he mumbles, and kisses him again, slower this time, carefully.
“I’ve been sick.”
"Potter," he said carefully.
"Merlin, how long are you going to keep punishing yourself?"
“That sounds like something she would be good at.”
Blaise huffed.
"Of course not. I don't even want to be here."
“Sure.”
She put her cup down with a gentle clink of porcelain.
“I’m going as soon as she takes that back.”
“Well, then thank you for your concern, professor, but I am fine,” he said, his voice taking on the sharp tone of civility that passed for anger in polite society.
Potter looked disoriented and Draco felt like he was in free fall, not even sure if he wanted Potter to go along with his ridiculous excuse or not. Then Potter halfway returned the grin, though it was more of a grimace.
Potter frowned.
Harry pushed back his chair and picked up his plate.
She shrugged again. Then nodded.
It was like a punch in the stomach. Harry glanced at Malfoy, expecting to see his own disappointment mirrored in his face, but instead Malfoy was smiling. A wry, bitterly amused smile, like this was exactly what he had expected.
Potter nodded.
It has been weeks since Draco was separated from his mother, when they were both supposed to leave the country and only she made it out. They haven’t been in contact since. The people from the Order assured him it had gone well, so he tries to believe that.
“Maybe one of the Gryffindors will tell you if you ask them nicely,” said the professor.
“If I had known we were holding council, I would have been on time, but since no one bothered to tell me-”
"Oh, that's right!" said Irie suddenly, and Harry jumped a little.
“No, they’re amortals, they’re not alive to begin with. I don’t even know how sentient they are…”
“Draco…”
Harry didn’t say anything. He should, of course. He should say something reassuring so Malfoy would stop looking like he had just been stabbed and was trying not to let it show on his face. He just couldn’t really think of anything.
“It’ll work better if I don’t tell you.”
Harry sighed.
The clack of his shoes on the marble floors echoed in the hall. He saw a sudden movement out of the corner of his eye and started, whirling around to see Harry standing up from where he had been sitting, on the staircase to the upper floors.
“Will you be waiting up here while I take them down, or are you going back now?”
He felt blood rushing to his face.
“You’d love Molly’s cakes,” Harry said, brushing his hair out of his eyes and showering his shirt in dust. “She makes the most amazing lemon drizzle cakes. You should come to the next Weasley dinner. I’m sure she’d be delighted to have another person to fatten up.”
”Good,” Harry said shortly, stirring his marshmallows into his drink and avoiding Draco’s eyes.
With a heavy sigh, Draco turned around and picked up his trunk. Maybe he’d work up the courage to owl Harry this week.
It was a book about caring for rabbits Hermione had given to him after Draco’s accident. He’d read the first and most important pages about diet and exercise straight away to make sure he was looking after Draco correctly, but he’d not looked at it since. He opened it up at the next chapter.
As Draco pushed the door open—the sweet, familiar scent of the cafe washing over him—a man shoved past him and ran from the shop, hitting Draco with his bag as he turned out of the door with no hint of apology.
They’d become inseparable in the weeks before Draco’s accident. Hermione had gone into full study mode right after Christmas and Ron, being the loving boyfriend he was, was right by her side. Harry couldn’t bear sitting in the library for hours on end listening to Hermione mumbling about goblin wars, despite Hermione insisting that he needed to focus on his grades more. Instead, he’d persuaded Draco to pick up his broom again and they spent their evenings chasing snitches and throwing quaffles around.
Baby Rose was born about an hour after Harry got to the hospital. Once she’d been passed around the Weasley’s and sufficiently fussed over, he excused himself and headed back to the cafe. He’d have all the time in the world to spoil her when Hermione and Ron brought her home, but right now all he could think about was getting the diary back.
Two games later, when the rain was no longer hammering against the windows and some of the younger students were dozing against their friends, Draco shared a triumphant high-five with Luna as he won his first game. He’d enjoyed this night far more than he thought possible and he was starting to think that maybe children weren’t so obnoxious after all.
He visited the hospital in Switzerland as often as possible, throwing himself into finding a working potion to distract him from anything related to Harry
“I need a duelling partner.”
Potter’s anger had dissipated over the last few days - Draco could finally breathe around him without being glared at - but rather than make an attempt towards some sort of truce as Neville had suggested that he would, he was doing his best to pretend that Draco didn’t even exist. Potter seemed to look right through him, as if Draco was a ghost that he didn’t particularly want to deal with. Draco had made one attempt to talk to him to alleviate the tension between them, but Potter hadn’t even glanced at him. He was too terrified of accidentally revealing his feelings by doing something stupid, like kissing those damn perfect lips, to try again.
Then Draco noticed a hand on Harry’s hip, and the beautiful woman that it was attached to.
” he spat, “I don’t need any of your advice, Potter.
“I suppose we can’t,” Harry said with a smile, returning the squeeze and pulling Draco along the street to join in with the snowball fight.
Of who?”
Draco reached the edge of the field, where the ground sloped down into a hill.
Draco highly doubted that. Longbottom had yet to speak more than four words to him and Potter hadn’t so much as looked him in the eye since the duel, while the other members of staff - Padma Patil and a witch called Natalie he didn’t recognise - had hardly been around.
attractive since they were at school.
Merlin, he was going soft.
He spent the last few hours arguing with healers from St. Mungo’s about an ill child’s right to medical treatment, regardless of them being a werewolf or not, and he had been aching to get back to the camp so he could complain at length to Harry and be comforted with Luna’s questionable cakes. He found himself regretting not sticking around to hear what Harry had to say. Draco had thought about it all week, his minding running around in circles coming up with increasingly ridiculous ideas when he wasn’t focusing on his potions. He had hoped Harry would owl him and had waited eagerly for an owl to arrive at his window each morning. Nothing had arrived, other than a few short letters from Luna, and eventually Draco had decided that whatever Harry had to say wasn’t important. He probably just wanted to ask him about the pool arrangements for the week, Draco told himself.
Most female werewolves were too scared to have children, out of fear that they’d pass their condition onto their children. It wasn’t genetic, but bloodborne, so many children caught it while they were in the womb or during labour, and the hospital had been working tirelessly to stop mothers feeling so guilty about having children.
” Potter’s legs froze and it was with great satisfaction that Draco noticed the shock on his face - he clearly hadn’t been expecting Draco to make the first move. “
“We’re all going,” she continued, adjusting her flowery cap. “Even Hermione and she doesn’t much like the sand. I think the sand drifters affect her concentration. It’s very difficult to read with those little creatures nibbling on your toes.”
Harry definitely wasn’t expecting to find
“I’m going to be a Slytherin when I’m older, just like Uncle Draco and nanny!”
They were huddled inside the largest of the cabins, the fireplaces lit and extension charms covering the walls to fit everyone inside until the rain died down. Draco was squashed between Martine - a first-year who seemed to have become rather attached to him - and Luna. He was beginning to wonder if it was considered bad manners to disapparate in the middle of a conversation.
Harry laughed and elbowed him good-naturedly, leaving a streak of white paint down the side of Draco’s jumper. He was glad he hadn’t bothered dressing to impress - Harry was going to have his clothes filthy before the afternoon was out.
He hoped someone had handed it in. It just wouldn’t feel right if he had to buy a new notebook to write in, plus all of his favourite pictures were stuck inside it and he’d be devastated if he couldn’t get them back.
Draco could feel his cheeks heating up at Potter’s condescending tone and scowled. “
“I do enjoy Cluedo, though. Don’t you Martine?” Luna asked. Draco had lost track of the conversation at least ten minutes ago, when talk had turned to muggle toasters and something called Scrabble.
and smirking at him in a way that made Draco wish he could punch the expression off his stupidly handsome face.
Underneath, all the children had signed their names and some had left their own little notes and doodles for him. Draco cast a preservation charm over it, not wanting to damage the wonderful little note. He carefully removed it from the door, unable to keep the smile off his face as he read through all the little additions thanking him and telling him how much fun they’d had with him. There was another note tucked underneath.
Draco flicked his wand and Harry had to blink several times to comprehend what he was seeing.
Draco adjusted his robes for what must have been the millionth time and smoothed his hair down. He had no idea why he was so fussy about his appearance all of a sudden. Being a potions master wasn’t the most glamorous of jobs and it had been a long time since he’d made a decent attempt to look presentable, much to his mother’s horror.
,” she corrected, shooing him into the hall and greeting more people. Skeeter was at his side in an instant, her gaudy quill flapping in his face as he edged through the crowd towards what seemed to be a bar.
”I suppose we are quite busy,” Harry said, “We’re fully booked until March.” He sounded exhausted and Draco felt like telling him to go home and sleep and let Draco look after the kids.
“Please Uncle Draco?” Teddy asked, grinning up at him. He’d lost a tooth since Draco had last seen him. “You can tell us about your potions again!”
without the children.” Harry smirked, taking advantage of the fact that Teddy and Victoire were too distracted by the falling snowflakes to kiss Draco again, his cold fingers sliding across Draco’s jaw and a hand resting on his hip. Draco found himself running his hand through Harry’s unruly hair, silently marvelling at its softness and tugging slightly to bring Harry impossibly closer.
Draco groaned as the cafe came into sight. Every table was full and with his luck, all the croissants would be sold out. Those book club ladies were like vultures when it came to fresh pastries. After the week he’d had, he was quite sure suffering through a banana muffin for breakfast would tip him over the edge.
With that he exited the cafe, leaving Draco speechless and red-faced. Being forced to write that diary might have just been the best thing that’s ever happened to him.
“Nonsense! Harry and Hermione have told me how brilliant you are at potions, I’m sure plenty of the work is down to your intelligence.”
. Underneath someone had stamped ‘Property of Hogwarts High School’. He recognised the name, as Hermione loved talking about the time she’d spent there, and he vaguely recalled her mentioning someone called Harry. It was a very common name though. He couldn’t be certain it was the same person.
“I never thought you’d turn to teaching. I think everyone expected to see you become the youngest Head Auror the Ministry had ever had.”
After the trip to the beach, Draco had expected himself to be able to keep himself under control around Harry, despite his gorgeous figure.
Longbottom laughed. “We aren’t twelve anymore,
“Opening party?” He wouldn’t promise Harry anything - he still thought it was far too optimistic to believe Molly Weasley would welcome him into her home - but Draco supposed he could try for Harry.
Draco sighed, glancing mournfully at the antique shop and agreed.
played Cluedo?”
“I think I’ll join the Scrabble group,” Potter said suddenly, moving to follow Natalie.
“Of course, Potter.” Draco sneered, gripping his wand tighter and willing his hand to stop shaking. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly why he was so terrified about dueling Potter, but he simply put it down to a fear of embarrassment and refused to dwell on the issue any longer, lest his brain begin coming up with ridiculous suggestions, like he was scared of hurting Potter.
Harry was resting against the wall next to him, lazily kicking his feet under the water as he supervised the children. He was telling Draco something about lunch arrangements, head tilted towards Draco’s face, leaving their lips just inches apart. Draco was far too focused on the little water droplets sliding down his toned chest to pay attention to anything Harry was saying. He wondered what it would be like to trace the path of the droplets up Harry’s chest, mapping out each dip and curve of his body with his tongue and hands and listening to Harry cry out in pleasure...
“Depends on how you look at it.”
“But it isn’t! He tried to kill Dumbledore, for Christ’s sake – he almost killed Ron.”
He nodded.
Irie had gone to the bathroom and Maya was talking to the people at the other end of the table and Draco had mostly turned away from him and was deep in conversation with Mark. Harry pushed his chair back and stood up.
“Me too,” said Harry.
“That was your father’s mistake, not yours, and it is the one I will never be able to forgive him for. But it’s not your fault, Draco.”
“Yeah.”
Hermione cast a concerned glance after him.
"You're leaving?"
“Why did you want to meet here?” asked Draco, following him.
Harry relaxed a little. That was safe enough.
“I’m good at the almost getting myself killed part of it.”
Draco shrugged.
The wind outside was freezing, but after the stuffy air inside it was pleasantly sobering, the cold lifting some of the drunken fog from his mind. He put a cigarette between his lips, fiddled clumsily with the lighter. The flame wouldn't hold for more than a second no matter how he turned to shield it and it took him upwards of seven tries before he remembered where he was and pulled out his wand. He took a drag and felt the gentle buzz of nicotine flood his veins. He did kind of want to go home. He was tired and he wanted to sleep and the thought of going back inside the noise and the stuffiness didn't feel very appealing. He supposed he would have to go back in to say goodbye, though. Pansy would kill him if he just left.
“Sorry. I thought I would come up here to – I assume we’re still doing research on Azkaban?”
Harry snorted.
“You’re right – you’re not. Just because I’m stuck here doesn’t mean I’ll talk to you, so piss off.”
Also you should all send kind thoughts to Morphine for betaing/giving me feedback, which made this so much better than it would have been without her.
Draco nodded.
“Right,” he said. “So I guess I’ll see you around?”
“I like it up here.”
“We do,” said Longbottom.
“It worked, didn’t it?” she asked. “I think we felt it all the way here. I’ve been so fucking worried- where’s Weasley? And Lovegood?”
“What have you found?”
“I know, Harry. Shit, I’m not trying to make you talk about it.”
“There’s Dean and Seamus – not quite sure what the status is with that at the moment, it’s not official or anything, but you know…” she shrugged, then picked up again: “And Ginny says Lavender and Parvati were together last year. She seemed so silly to me, but they all talk about her very differently now, it might just be because she’s – no, sorry, that was an awful thing to say. I’m worried about Parvati, though. She’s grown really quiet…”
She dragged her friend away from the counter, but then Emma twisted free of her grasp.
“Ready?” he asked.
“Guess you couldn’t sleep either?” he said.
Blaise ignored him.
about you, you arrogant prick!”
After lunch he went down to the greenhouses. They had Herbology with the Ravenclaws, so the classes were usually good – everyone was focused, most people were prepared for class, there was generally less noise than in any class with Hufflepuffs or Gryffindors in it. Today, however, they were studying weeds, and they had all been given a small Acheronta* – also known as Hell Bramble, which seemed a more appropriate name – that they were supposed to figure out a way to exterminate, so the lesson was a chaos of fearful screams, minor injuries and people volunteering to escort their friends to the hospital wing. Draco was still observing his angrily thrashing specimen from a safe distance, not quite decided upon how he was going to try to kill it, when someone gently bumped into his shoulder. He turned to find Luna Lovegood edging past him.
“No, fuck this,” he says. “I shouldn’t have told you.”
“We’ve figured out how to kill the dementors,” said Granger quietly.
Potter.
“You think I’m attractive?” Harry probably should have been a bit more concerned about Draco reading his diary, but the man who he’d been pining after just admitted that he found Harry attractive and that was all his brain wanted to focus on.
If possible, he blushed even more, his cheeks scarlet. “It doesn’t sound completely awful.”
Harry couldn’t be certain when Draco would be back to his usual, less furry self, but he knew that when he was, Harry wouldn’t hesitate to show Draco just how much he cared.
The cafe was tucked away between a stationery shop and a broom servicing store. It was decked out for Christmas and Draco had never seen so many tiny christmas trees in one place. Everything was covered in a fine layer of red and green glitter and Draco could already tell he was never going to get his new jumper clean again.
Draco turned down the flame, sprinkling the last few grams of powdered unicorn horn into the bubbling green mixture. Ten more minutes and he’d be able to add the final vial of dragon’s blood and let the potion simmer until tea time.
“A date?”
“I suppose.” Potter sighed, relenting almost instantly. Even the Savior of the Wizarding World couldn’t stand up to Luna’s stare. It took Draco a while to get used to the rules, what with all the cards and little pieces, but he found himself enjoying the game immensely. It was rather thrilling, trying to figure out who the criminal was and waiting on tenterhooks to see if someone had guessed right. Muggles were so much better than Wizards at this board game stuff, he thought.
Something had changed between him and Draco after that. Draco had risked his time with Harry by fixing his friendship with Hermione. He had no way of knowing if Harry would bother with him once he had his friends back, but he did it anyway and Harry respected him for that.
“It’s a
“That’s too kind of you, Mrs. Weasley.”
“Magic word?”
”How’s the dueling centre going?” Draco asked as they sat down in a booth. He was already starting to regret agreeing to join them; Harry seemed distant and rather off and Draco anticipated a long hour of silence ahead of them.
As he looked through the notebook, he began to realise that it was, in fact, a diary. Each photograph and written entry was carefully dated, and the bits of paper seemed to be from significant points in Harry’s life. One was his A-Level results, another a letter from someone called Sirius, and several were Christmas cards with long, heartfelt messages inside them.
Draco hurried to the door and the children poured into the hallway in a sea of multicoloured raincoats, dripping mud all over his shiny, freshly cleaned floor. He sighed quietly and reminded himself that Luna probably wouldn’t be too happy if he jinxed a child, dirty floors or not.
It didn’t mean the lack of contact from Harry hurt any less.
One of the employees—Kate, according to her name tag—stood next to him, looking apologetic.
” Draco cursed his luck as he fell to the floor, wand slipping from his grip. Potter was on top of him in seconds, kneeling over him as he pushed his wand against Draco’s chest and reversed the spell. Potter’s face was close, too close - Draco could see every speck of colour in his irritatingly mesmerising eyes, see every little crease in his lips and each and every freckle covering the bridge of his nose. He pushed Potter away, the applause from the children gathered around them snapping him out of his thoughts.
“Then we should do this again sometime.” Harry was smiling softly, all dimples and barely-there freckles and Draco couldn’t hardly say no to such a request now, could he?
The sudden lack of animosity between them was doing nothing to help Draco’s situation. Harry insisted on sitting next to Draco as he read under the shade of one of Luna’s umbrellas, asking Draco questions about his book and humming quietly under his breath as they sat in peaceful silence. It wasn’t quite perfect - they had yet to talk about anything more serious than a child with a sore throat and had been avoiding any mention of the war, but Draco was happy to pretend that everything was right in the world if it meant Harry sitting so close to him.
“You’ve corrupted him!” Harry whined as they set off towards the village. “And why am I stuck as a bloody snitch?”
Draco flushed bright red and looked away. “Who wouldn’t?”
“Mr Malfoy!” Professor McGonagall called from the door to the Great Hall, beckoning him over. “What a pleasant surprise!”
he simpered, perching on the bar stool next to his like a bright green vulture as he ordered two butterbeers. “It’s been so long!”
About two weeks ago, Draco had a run in with a group of fifth years working on a transfiguration project in the library. They were attempting to turn shoelaces into rabbits and guinea pigs with little success, when one of them thought it would be amusing to try the same spell on Draco. One poorly pronounced incantation later and Harry’s roommate was much smaller and much furrier.
he reassured himself,
That was probably the Dursley’s fault, he reasoned. From what Harry has written about them it was clear they cared very little for him and were certain to make sure he knew it.
“I’ve been waiting to do this since you left for Switzerland,” Harry said breathlessly as they reluctantly pulled apart, Harry’s thumb rubbing slow circles against Draco’s cheek. “We could have saved a lot of heartache if you’d just given me a few moments to explain myself before you left.”
Draco groaned, banging his fist on the workbench in anger. He’d been working on this potion for 3 days, for an old lady up in Kent with chronic knee pain who was one of his regular customers. He’d yet to let her down in the years he’d been sending her potions and he didn’t want to start now. The potion would be ruined if he didn’t add the dragon’s blood exactly ten minutes after the horn. Whoever was at the door would just have to
Draco ignored the flutter of hope in his chest and took a tentative nibble of the cupcake. It was rather enjoyable, to his surprise, and tasted like cherries.
“Martine?”
All of a sudden Potter was moving his wand again, casting a Trip Jinx and sending Draco sprawling across the platform. Potter was back on his feet before Draco could say
“I’d forgotten how witty you are! Now tell me, what are you doing here? I was under the impression that you and Harry Potter were sworn enemies.” Her quill was poised like a weapon besides her, waiting for Draco to speak.
“It was a team effort.”
He’d stayed in Switzerland too long,
Draco paused for a moment, his guilt slowly returning. The diary was clearly deeply personal to Harry and he was quite sure that he wouldn’t want a stranger reading his private thoughts, even if Harry was pining after said stranger.
“I’m a ghost.” Draco said, giving Harry a twirl. The eye holes were different sizes and the mouth was far too big and Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or coo over how endearing he looked.
The knocking was louder this time, and more insistent. He supposed it was too much to hope that someone who had gone to the trouble of climbing up a hill to his front door would just give up after a few knocks. With a heavy sigh and a great deal of annoyance, Draco threw his cloth down and extinguished the flame underneath the potion. He’d give the lady a discount and hope he didn’t lose her business over the delay, he decided, vanishing the potion that was rapidly turning a dark shade of purple and checking that the batch of Wolfsbane in the corner of the lab wouldn’t bubble over if he left it unattended.
He was very wrong.
The kids burst into laughter as Potter began dancing uncontrollably, performing an odd jig that was probably popular sometime during the 18th century. Draco muttered another spell and watched in satisfaction as Potter found himself sneezing and suddenly unable to move his legs again.
“You lasted longer than most people. The kids are used to duels that last a minute or two and Harry winning with ease, not by chance. They look up to you. Nothing cooler than someone who almost won a duel against
On the inside of the front cover, a name had been written in cramped, spidery writing, which Draco could just about make out as ‘
Draco thought reading the diary was going to sate his curiosity and that he’d be able to just hand it over to the staff to give it back when Harry came looking for it. Instead, he’d been left with a growing desire to find out even more about Harry.
The further he flicked through, the guiltier Draco felt. The diary was clearly full of deeply personal memories and definitely not something Harry would want a complete stranger reading through, even if it was just to find a way to contact him and return the book. He flipped to the last entry, deciding to just hand the diary over to one of the staff to return to Harry when he came back in for it, despite his growing curiosity about the man who’d written the diary.
.” Draco’s thoughts were interrupted by flowers and chunks of grass being ripped from the ground and flying towards him, catching in his hair and sliding down the neck of his shirt. Potter was smirking again and he opened his mouth - presumably to critique Draco’s momentary lapse of concentration. It was with great satisfaction that Draco watched as Potter realised he couldn’t offer him any sort of advice or criticism.
“I have no idea what this ‘Cluedo’ is.”
“Harry get your arse down here! We’re going to be late!”
Draco hadn’t spoken to Harry since the party.
It surprised him, the intensity of emotions Potter was awakening in him. The swirl of anger and competitiveness rising in his chest was something he hadn’t experienced since the Gryffindor and Slytherin quidditch matches at the height of their rivalry, when his life revolved around finding ways to attract Potter’s attention. The thrill he got from Potter’s unwavering gaze awoke old emotions Draco had forgotten existed and he knew that this could only end badly.
Granger made a noise of agreement around a mouthful of cake. “You’ve changed since we were at school,” she said, swallowing and reaching for a sandwich. “I think you’re starting to win over some of the adults too.”
It covered his arms, in between his fingers, in his hair and some had even found its way into places where no man should ever have sand.
holding his diary.
Harry pulled a face. “I don’t think I’d last very long in the Ministry. Too many slimy politicians wandering about with punchable faces. Besides, the idea of fighting criminals and being expected to save the WIzarding World for the rest of my life wasn’t too appealing and I’ve always liked children.” He laughed and elbowed Draco playfully in the side, in a display of casual familiarity that made Draco’s heart ache. He wouldn’t get to experience this for much longer - he didn’t think maintaining a friendship with an ex-Death Eater outside of this camp would be high on Harry’s list of priorities, especially with a new business. “I never thought that you’d spend your spare time making joint potions for old ladies and mucking about with nosy teenagers.”
There were very

“Salazar, Potter. Have you got any idea much it hurt? Have you?”

"Harry- Are you-"

"Then what is?"
“Send him an owl. Maybe he’ll listen.”
Malfoy's Animagus form was knocked into the crowds of Hogsmeade. Immediately recovering, his vision blurred. All he could make out was the legs of many wizards. His breathing quickened along with his heart, ducking himself to avoid being stepped on. He began to run as fast as his small paws could take him. He went between many legs to avoid any more hexes. Nothing like a wild ferret running around in Hogsmeade. Nothing so wrong with that. Especially when four men are after him. After a

All those times he believed being an Animagus was a waste of time, he finally took his time away to learn it. Because of that, he never stopped attempting to keep the Mandrake leaf in his mouth for a
He had to act fast. Malfoy would hate himself later, but, for now, he needed cover.
"Oh, Salazar-"
- ☞ ✎ ☜ -
So he did; as of now. Potter wasn't going to let this go. This was his business now. But, he didn't want to scare Malfoy off. "So, yes or no?"
"Malfoy- Draco, wait!"
Malfoy slowly scrambled away until his back hit the railing. Thank Salazar railings were there.
Malfoy got a cube of sugar and began to stir it into his tea. Delicately, he blew on it slightly before taking a sip. The sounds of his dress shoes tapping against the floor echoed the quiet room.
"What did you just say to me?" From the corner of his eyes, he realized now all four of them had their wands facing him.
"I knew it- I bloody knew it," Malfoy mumbled as his shaky hands fumbled away from Potter's, shooting himself up from his seat as he stumbled in the process. "I was a fool to trust you. You were just trying to
Exiting, Potter made his way towards his dormitory to fumble in his trunk. Pulling out the Marauder's Map, Potter tapped his wand on it, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." The map unraveled, immediately searching for Malfoy's name. He silently cursed to himself as he tapped his wand against it once again, "mischief managed."
Malfoy turned on his heel and began to walk straight out of the club without looking back. He turned into an empty alley and Apparated to their flat.
year, another chance, to restart.
He was always so delicate. It reminded him of potions class. Malfoy always knew how to stir, measure, and cut. Some days they were partners, not by choice but by force. Potter would always sit and watch as Malfoy did most of the work and of course, not get any credit for it. Either he sneered at Potter or didn’t dare say anything, there wasn’t any in-between.
Potter seemingly was taken aback. He only stared blankly at him, lips parted once more as his words were unable to form. His expression was soon washed over with confusion. "Malfoy, I- what? Who's doing- "
Slowly opening his eyes, Malfoy couldn't adjust to the bright lights on the Hospital Wing. It was white everywhere. It practically burned his eyes as he groaned lightly, throat all scratchy as he rubbed his hand across his face roughly.
Times change, and so do people. But, no one dared to listen to the Death Eater. There wasn't any opening for any student to change their minds about him. Every student hated his guts, even wished for him to disappear. Malfoy understood; no one wanted to be reminded, and he played a huge role in just that. This is why he spent most of his time in his Animagus form than his own human form. After the
Malfoy begged to stay low but Harry insisted they would be alright.
Oh, bloody Salzar, the famous Harry Potter was
With a soft smile, Harry would gladly pick up the ferret and place it next to him on the bed.
Slowly, Malfoy relaxed his shoulders, feeling more tired than he already was as he seemed defeated. He didn't have the strength to argue anymore. "Is someone putting you up to this? To just humiliate me?" His voice was weak, now unable to look at Potter.
"You're staring dead at me. That's bloody weird."
"I'm not entirely sure what a ferret eats. You can have the Mash. You can eat that, right?" Potter pushed the plate towards Malfoy. With ease, Malfoy sniffed the food with suspicion. Not even Malfoy knew what they could and couldn't eat. All he knew that he

Malfoy and Potter eventually started dating.

It wasn’t Malfoy. Just another man ordering a drink, so he shrugged it off.
“Sod off, Harry!” He playfully shoved him away while Potter laughed.
Potter grabbed a hold of the student, shoving them roughly off of Malfoy. Winding his fist back, he threw a hard punch against their nose. Grabbing their robes, he pulled them close to him. "Touch him again and I
“I’m going to the loo.” With a small laugh, he pulled away from Potter and made his way to the loo.
Why did he even dare to come back? Malfoy only assumed Hogwarts was his home.
Malfoy slowly leaned into Potter's lips, kissing him gently.
“Do you think you’d like to get some dinner sometime?” Potter placed the book back, not entirely wanting to buy a book for today.
Malfoy didn't even breathe for a hot minute.
He began to pounce all around Potter's legs, even attempting to climb up.

“What does it look like, Potter?” He flicked his wand towards more clothes in their drawer. “I’m going back home.”
As if he could hear just what he was thinking, Potter gave a nonchalant shrug, brushing two fingers along Malfoy's soft coat while pocketing Malfoy's wand.
He looked more ill than ever. Malfoy seemed like he had gotten no sleep from their last encounter. Potter wanted to engulf him in a tight hug. He looked so
“Malfoy is the least of my problems. What he does is none of my concerns. Bloody hell. Have you been seeing him?”
“What’s this you wanted to talk about, Harry?” Hermione started as they sat in silence for a while after receiving their Butterbeer.
"Are you spending New Years' with me?"
"Putting me- Malfoy, who's doing these things to you? We should tell someone-" He reached out, but Malfoy moved away, clutching the strap to his bag until his knuckles were even paler. Potter almost missed how Malfoy's body was shaking, hearing those silent sobs breaking out from the blond.
There was no bloody way Potter was going to pick him up, let alone
"Get away from him!"
Speaking of, Potter took out his wand, putting it between the two, but he made sure to hold it in case Malfoy was going to snatch it.
“Good riddance, ma- oof!”
He would come in day after day, buying books he claims to be “presents for Hermione and Ginny.”
Malfoy cringed. “You seriously can’t go out like that; you’ll not only embarrass yourself but for me as well.” He threw a black button up at him. “At least put this on.” And Potter didn’t protest.
"You were chasing a ferret with your wands. Why is that? Have you gone mad?" Potter's brows knitted together, actually shaming them like a bloody

“Draco?”
However, Potter wasn't the same. The spark in his green eyes behind those signature glasses died down. Malfoy only assumed everyone's spark died ever since The Battle. His spark died too. Malfoy wasn't himself anymore. He was quieter, involved himself less and less with every passing day. His whole demeanor changed, but, no one cared. He was still a Death Eater. That was unchangeable. No one asked how he was. No one ever dared to talk to him, not even a single glance towards his direction. It was better to be ignored than sneered for ever existing.
Waking up next to Potter for the first time would’ve been the best day of Malfoy’s life.
He hung his head low, sitting in the back of every class with no one next to him. Either too afraid or hated his guts. Malfoy didn't care. Of course, he never cared.
Without another word from the men or Potter, he turned on his heel, walking the other direction with Malfoy still resting on his shoulder.
Just like that, Malfoy got away.
Harry leaned forward to kiss Malfoy passionately. Malfoy released Harry's hand, now slowly working his fingers up to Harry's hair, clinging to it lightly.
Malfoy led them to the counter, settling Potter down to sit as he stood next to him. With the bartender in front of them both, he ordered two Vesper Martinis. Downing it in one go, Malfoy led them to the dance floor once Potter finished sipping his.
"This is humiliating." Malfoy peeled the sheets away from his skin and pocketed his wand. Getting up from the bed, he stumbled from the dizziness.
Potter cupped a hand against his cheek, which Malfoy slowly sank into, tired eyes staring into sparkling green ones.
Over time, people had gotten used to it. Mainly because of how protective Potter was when it came to the Daily Prophet and how he kept things hidden from them. Any other story about Malfoy and he would've punched the publisher right in the face himself.
There was a lot being covered in the Daily Prophet when Malfoy had finally left the Muggle world.
Malfoy clambered to get up to his feet, hands gripping the railing for support, attempting to stop his legs from buckling beneath him.
It was an ambush, then, and she wasn’t about to let him go now that she had cornered him.
thought you would be able to do a job that requires you to take orders is beyond me. You have a serious problem with authority - I mean, there were times where it seemed as if just the fact that someone was an adult in a position of power was enough to make you disregard everything they said. Also, can you imagine yourself being responsible for upholding all the old wiz- the old laws? Was there a single rule in school you
Ginny smiles.
Draco nodded.
“You’re the one who kissed me,” Potter said.
“You could get a sleeping draught from Madam Pomfrey.”
”I suppose.”
McGonagall regarded him for a long moment.
Harry closed his eyes and pushed his glasses up to pinch the bridge of his nose.
be playing by the rules, Potter," he said.
“So, two on two?” she said addressing all of them.
“Oh, hi Harry,” she said. “You’re back late.”
“What about your father? Are you okay?”
“No? Well, no, I suppose not…” she said lamely.
“Did you sleep in?”
“Draco, wake up!”
“No, I just – I wouldn’t exactly say we’re ready to go since we still haven’t figured out what to do about… about the dementors.”
"Yeah. Did uh…" Harry's shoulder brushed Malfoy's again and he opted for leaning forwards, resting his elbows on the table. "Did Malfoy tell you about me?"
"Please, I-" he began, but she cut him off.
Ron didn’t laugh.
For a second it looked like she was about to cry with frustration.
Part of him even wished Potter had stayed with the Weasley girl. Then Draco would probably have followed Pansy's advice and actually made an effort to move on. Instead he had seen that magazine article, had realized that Potter wasn't going straight down the road to contented, Weasley-esque domesticity, and the stupid idea of Potter, heartbroken and adrift, had spread in his mind like a plague. The idea that maybe he could see him again, maybe he could show that he was different now, that he had grown up at least a little bit, that he had left the Manor and then… then nothing. He knew Pansy considered him completely delusional when it came to Potter, but it had been a very long time since he had managed, even in the privacy of his own mind, to take it beyond anything other than chilly forgiveness. A slightly better ending. Turned out even that had been too far-fetched.
"I'm glad you came," Malfoy said quietly.
Malfoy shrugged and looked away.
“Sorry. You’re the only one I know who sort of liked him.”
He supposed that was all the approval he could have hoped for.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I just have to go and… to go.”
"Oh, that one," he said.
“But dementors can’t
Draco looked around the faces in the room. They were all watching him impatiently. They did not seem inclined to let him leave.
“You know,” he said very quietly. “I know you won’t believe me, but I know what that’s like.”
Draco really thought he should, but before he could begin repeating any of the wonderfully sappy quotes he had picked up, Slughorn showed up and pushed his way past the students, apologizing and rambling about how he got held up in the teacher’s lounge. Potter nodded to Draco, and then trickled inside with the other Gryffindors. A moment later, Pansy was at Draco’s side.
“It’s probably not a good sign that we need to be putting ourselves in mortal danger to avoid getting bored.”
“And he didn’t even recognize us! You dragged me all the way to that fucking prison, and then he had no clue who we were!”
“Why haven’t you told us?” asked Harry.
"I've heard of
They'd just reached the entrance to St James's Park at this point, and Draco squeezed Harry's arm. "I love that you remember that," he said. "This'll sound a bit patronising, sorry, but there was so much new music you heard that week that I'm impressed you remember any of the details. "
, but once a year is enough for that, so I'll find something else for you to see."
Ron shuddered. "Look, Malfoy, I'm not saying I don't believe you when you say he's changed. Harry and Teddy have both told me the same thing. But I'm not sure I actually want to
"Ah," said Harry. "I think I can see where this is going."
"Come on, then," said Ron. "I’ll put the kettle on. So, have you found anything out?"
Draco updates his accompanist.
Draco nodded, smiling.
, but there was a children's choir singing in the foyer before the proper concert started, and this was their finale."
"I bet you were just flustered at the thought of me," said Potter, grinning. And was that a
"Kreacher? The house-elf? I'd forgotten he was yours," said Draco. "But... Look, it's a very kind offer, and I'd love to be able to accept, but... it would be difficult for me to live anywhere other than the Manor. At the moment, at least. I can understand why you might want to never set foot there again, but... please will you just come and see, before you decide? It'll make more sense when you're there, I promise."
Ron grinned at them all. “I’m just feeling smug for having the best mum in the world,” he announced.
Draco tightened his hug. "Let it all out," he murmured into Harry's hair. "I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere." Harry didn't say anything, but Draco felt the man's body shaking with quiet sobs. He began rubbing reassuring circles with the hand he had on Harry's back.
"There’s no evidence that they do – it seems likely that any ill effects are caused by the recipient’s fear. But that fear can be quite extreme. In Italy, people have believed in curses for centuries, and Hermione is right: 'sia maledetto' just means 'may he be cursed'. Maybe the actual curse – if indeed the guy
Harry sat up. "When
Potter's face hardened instantly. "Hermione? Is she OK? And why are
I can see what you mean," he said after a moment. "I've never seen a bonfire with quite that many colours, though."
It took Draco a while to get rid of Scorpius so he could start unpacking. He had managed to resist the temptation to tell Scorpius that he'd be joining him at Hogwarts for the next two weeks, although he

Draco shifted slightly, reminding Harry that his exploration had only just started. He was very tempted to continue kissing Draco forever, but the thought that there might be even
Harry shook his head, smiling slightly. "I said the exact same thing to her," he said. "She pointed out that I
Humbled, he stood there and bowed and waved and smiled; he brought Rabia out for another bow, and then they both bowed and waved and smiled some more. When they went off for the second time, the stage manager was still smiling.
"I'm not entirely convinced 'amazingness' is a word, but thank you," said Draco, with a quick kiss. "And please don't do yourself down. You
"Understood," said Draco. "And do we do anything in particular for… well, shitting?"
Draco nodded. "Where to next, then?" he asked.
He hadn't seen Harry since his trial just after the war, six years earlier; he'd been embarrassingly grateful that Harry had spoken up for all three Malfoys (albeit somewhat less firmly for Lucius, who had been spared Azkaban as a result of Harry's intervention but was still on house arrest). Draco had managed to speak briefly to Harry to thank him, and had been surprised and delighted when Harry had given back his hawthorn wand. They'd both spoken in a civil manner; Draco couldn't tell whether Harry still thought of him as an enemy, but there was no sign of it if so. But then Draco and Narcissa had agreed that they would stay at home for a while, partly to keep Lucius company and partly to lie low until the dust of the war settled; they were both well aware of the reception they were likely to get in Diagon Alley, even though they'd been found not guilty.
You know even less about me than I thought you did."
By the time they were all inside, they were all exhausted. Hermione insisted on St Mungo's being contacted immediately, though. So Ron went there, and returned with a Healer, who examined Hermione and announced that she was healing well, all things considered, but that magical healing could definitely speed things up. He told them that she could be safely Apparated, thanks to the plaster casts; it wouldn't have been safe without them, though.
"Well, that's where you're wrong," said Draco. "I mean, I
"He told me that he hasn't been out in the wizarding world in years, because he doesn't want any trouble, and he thinks people won't want to see him. But he's a different person to who he used to be, and I want to help him show people that. So I want to bring him to Diagon Alley."
His thoughts were interrupted by the return of Potter, who was now bundled up in jeans and a black fleece, with a green scarf wrapped round his neck.
Harry held the ring on the palm of his hand, as if weighing it, then exhaled and put it on. "It feels weird," he said, gazing at his finger.
"OK," said Draco, relieved. "Where shall we go? There's nowhere round here I fancy walking."
been perfect so far, so yes, I'd like to make sure that our first shag is too. I did consider for a moment suggesting that I could top, because I'm not as big as you, and you…"
all over it? I might never take it off!"
"Well, if you're going to get married eventually anyway, you could just do the spell now, couldn't you?" suggested Joanne. "Then when you have the ceremony they can just say it again. What difference does it make?"
As Harry stood there, he felt a sudden breeze, and the next moment an owl swooped past his head, moving very quickly and carrying a large box. It flew directly into the house, through a flap near the top of the wall which Harry hadn't previously noticed, and landed in the kitchen. Draco immediately got up from his chair and went to investigate. He looked pleased when he saw the box, and gave the owl a treat from a jar on top of the fridge. As the owl flew out, Draco tore the box open and started putting groceries away.
"Yes, and Ron… helped me… wrap them round me," said Harry, increasingly breathlessly. Draco hoped that this was due to the fact that he was planting tiny kisses along the path of the lights as he removed them – one of his better ideas, he congratulated himself privately.
, though, to get all the facts clear from the outset," mused Harry. "We can talk about that another time, though. Thanks, Hermione. All of that should have been quite obvious, but it helped to have it all stated as clearly as that. Let's move, though, before we get distracted again. Draco, why don't you take Hermione and I'll take Ron?"
"This is nice, isn't it?" whispered Harry into Draco's ear, as the world spun around them.
Harry took a deep breath. "Erm... Well... I've been thinking about... you know, sex. Erm, proper sex.
Harry's cock, which had been half-hard ever since he'd woken up, became significantly more interested in proceedings when it was suddenly pressed against Draco's. Draco laughed. "That's reassuring," he said. "I wasn't sure how comfortable you'd be with this – I know it was you that suggested it, but you weren't exactly thinking calmly last night – but your cock certainly seems to be happy with the situation."
After they'd been at the buffet for fifteen minutes, Harry was starting to fidget. "Look, I'm really going to have to go," he told Draco. "I've got so many things I have to sort out before tomorrow. I'm sorry. I honestly would like to stay and chat. Maybe another time?"
Draco took a long time to get to sleep that night. His mind kept coming up with question after question: How had Harry found him? Why could Harry see the house? Why had Draco hidden from him? What would he do if Harry came back?
Hermione nodded slowly. "That makes sense," she said. Then she punched Harry in the arm. "But you! Why didn't you say anything about this until now? It's a great idea!"
"Right, well, in that case I'd probably better go and warn her," said Ron. "Unless you want me to come to the Manor with you?"
Draco gave him a matching forehead kiss. "That sounds perfect, Harry," he said.
(Seamus and Ron heard it on a jukebox in a Muggle pub once, and have teased Harry about its existence ever since!)
"I think you've transferred some of your bravery to me," said Draco a few minutes later. "There's another Cole Porter song that I think I'm going to sing to you now. Before I lose my nerve."
Hermione had indeed grabbed his hand in excitement when the fury of "He Trusted in God" had died away and Draco had launched into "Thy Rebuke". And they'd both been surprised to find themselves in tears when the Hallelujah Chorus started and everyone in the audience stood up.
"Oh, I've done both of those. But I've never swallowed."
"I'm trying to be better about that," Harry told him. "In fact, you'll notice that I'm in my pyjamas? I was about to go to bed, but then I remembered I wanted to ask you something."
Harry stepped out of the fireplace at his home in Devon, feeling slightly queasy. Partly this was because of his aversion to Floo travel, which had diminished over the years but never quite gone away; mostly, however, he was worrying about what reception he'd get from Ginny when she saw him.
"I... have to confess that I haven't tried that yet," said Draco.
Needless to say, that was the moment that the applause finally started to die down, and Harry found himself staring straight at McGonagall as she clearly heard his last statement. Her eyes twinkled at him, and this just made him laugh even harder. He held up Draco's and Rabia's hands on either side of him; the others followed suit. "That's all, folks!" Harry shouted to the audience. "You've been great, but we have to go now. Bye!" And with that, he led the way into the side room.
"You saw... How?"
Ron grinned.
"You do know they haven't thought of you like that in years, don't you?" said Harry, putting his glass down and turning to face Draco in the flickering light.
"Mother is 46 and Father is 47," said Draco. "But it
we did such bad things, and he had some sympathy. He still liked
Less useful, but more of a relief, was a silver Sword of Gryffindor pin that had been a present from Ginny just before they'd split up; Harry hadn't wanted to admit to her that he'd lost it, so he was pleased to spot it on the floor near the coat stand in the hall. He still wasn't entirely sure what he was supposed to wear it with, though; Draco had laughed quite a lot when Harry had admitted this, and demonstrated how to use it to fasten a cape.
(Note: this was supposed to be the last part, but technical issues mean it isn’t - more tomorrow!)
Harry looked aghast. "I
Harry was silent for a couple of minutes, and Draco sipped his coffee, waiting for him to process his thoughts.
Harry wasn't sure which he was enjoying more: the music, or the audience's reaction to Draco. Probably the latter, on balance - this wasn't Harry's favourite genre of music, but he appreciated anything that was

, remember?"
Draco looked slightly offended. "I know my history doesn't give you much reason to trust me, but I promise I have never lied to you – even when we were at school – and I never will."
"I did point that out to her, but she was insistent," Draco told him. "With it being pop, backing tracks would probably have been better, but the organisers wanted live musicians only, and when Rabia found out she said she didn't want anyone else accompanying me, she wants to keep me for herself, bless her. So the deal is that she'll go first, so that at least there'll be a bit of a break for her; there's another pianist who's accompanying the flute and cello, and then I'm last."
"Of course I have, but that just seems to get them more excited," said Draco. "They all
"Oy, what about me?" complained Harry, grinning.
"It's pretty impressive, isn't it? But it was a bit awkward while the guy was doing it, because Ted insisted he was doing it wrong, and was trying to tell him what dragons
Draco looked distraught. "Erm," said Ron. "You don't, I'm afraid. It's kind of permanent."
Hermione tells Harry about Draco.
Draco's eyes were dancing. "You must be
"Well, not the
"Well, it was bloody impressive," said Harry. "I could hear all the admiring comments people were making, and I wanted to rush up to them all and say 'he's my BOYFRIEND!'"
Harry wasn't sure, but he thought he might have actually passed out for a while due to the overwhelming sensation. If not, it was only a split second before he was coming even harder than before, and Draco was swallowing all of it. When he eventually released Harry's spent cock, he gave it a final all-over lick before sitting back on his heels, looking flushed but satisfied.
, though, don't worry. Just people who are special to me."
"I know I'm an insensitive prat when it comes to letting you talk," said Ron, "but I'm quite observant. And I know you hate it."
"I meant to ask you about that, actually," said Draco, yawning. "You said last night that you'd never fallen asleep in someone's arms before. I know you said you and Ginny never did much in bed even at the
"That is very much alright with me," Draco assured him, sitting up and taking his hand. "Which I hope should be obvious, given that I can't help feeling that if I hadn't said something you would never have kissed me."
, said the text.
"Well, we've seen you perform," Ron pointed out. "You're pretty bloody talented. You know, for an ex-nemesis."
Harry was mortified. "You'd think that by now I'd be used to the idea of everyone talking about me," he muttered. "But I didn't know they were
Luckily Ron has grown up a bit.
The kiss was a little restrained at first, as if they were both trying not to do anything that might put the other off. But then Harry wrapped his arms more firmly around Draco and, as if a switch had been flipped, everything immediately became more intense. Their tongues touched now and again, but what really made Draco's blood rush was the feeling of being joined to Harry; they were breathing as one, and Draco could even feel Harry's heart beating next to his.
Harry looked out over the icy water. "This park reminds me of Hogwarts grounds, a bit," he said. "At least, in the snow it does. The Black Lake is similar in shape to this one, isn't it?"
Draco laughed. "Nemesis? That's a fancy word for it!"
An hour later, Harry and Draco were outdoors again, this time walking up a long wide path towards an impressive old building. "That was a lot less painful than I expected," Harry was saying. "I think having the singing first made all the difference. You could tell how impressed they were, I hope. Anyway, where are we? I don't think I've been here before."
fancy you. It's just too soon for me to get my head round all this. But... I appreciated the fact that you didn't let Ron force us into a discussion about sex before, and that you said we wouldn't have to do anything. I'm... I just need some time. But I'm not ruling it out in the future. Which, if I had been forced to discuss it when we were at the Leaky, I don't think I would have said. So... I'm babbling now. I'll shut up."
"So your plan was to
"Ooh, that was one of my cousin's favourites when I was little," Harry said, his eyes widening, when Draco brought it out of the kitchen. "They never let me try it myself, though. I always wanted to. It smelled amazing."
"Well, given how most people seemed to feel about me, it didn't seem likely that I'd be able to get a job here, so when I was offered the chance to be part of the research project, I jumped at it. It was actually Snape who'd recommended me, it turned out – he knew the guy who was running things there."
"I'm fine," said Albus. Scorpius turned to look at him searchingly, and Albus flashed him a crooked smile and pulled him a little closer. "I am, really. We've all known for ages that something wasn't right, and James was so worried that he even tried to speak to Dad about it. I didn't know till tonight that James knew Mum was with Dean, though. It was all a bit of a shock at first when Mum and Dad said they're really getting divorced, but then I realised that nothing will really change all that much from our point of view, other than that they'll both be much happier. At least, I hope they will."
are using a Muggle pen. What the bloody hell is going on?"
sorry." He collapsed onto the sofa and leaned forward, resting his head on his knees.
"Go and look in them," Draco instructed.
"OK," said Seamus, "that sounds great, but I don't see where I come in?"
," he said to Draco. "All of it. I couldn't look away – you were totally brilliant. And it wasn't what I was expecting at all – I presumed it would all be opera stuff like that one you sang in the park, but there was lots of different stuff. And I loved
They got the giggles in the bathroom, when they decided that it would be easiest to just both piss at the same time; this soon became a contest, in which they each tried to disrupt the other's stream. The lighthearted mood helped dispel any possible awkwardness when they had to do even more embarrassing things a minute later. They were very short of time by the time they got in the shower, which Harry decided was probably just as well, as he wasn't quite ready to think about the feelings he got when he saw the water running over Draco's glistening body.
, you said it would lead to a longer conversation. I meant to ask you about that, but I got distracted. Is this what you meant?"
"Oh, to keep my eyes dark-adapted? That makes sense."
," he said, holding the audience with his gaze until the chord behind him died away.
do a gesture!" said Harry, remembering. "He stuck out his index finger and little finger and pointed his hand downwards. What does that mean?"
Fifteen minutes later, they were sitting side by side in the folding chairs, each cradling a mug of hot chocolate. The Christmas pudding had been heated up and devoured long before the hot chocolate was ready.
- the choir does most of the hard work in
Harry could feel a knot of worry in that part of him that was Draco, and he felt oddly shaken himself. He looked at Hermione enquiringly, suddenly unable to decide what he wanted her answer to be.
"Get dressed before you freeze to death," said Harry, after he read this. He cast a wandless warming charm over Draco just to be on the safe side. "And don't worry. It was the old Malfoy that did all those bad things, and they will know that I wouldn't be with you unless you'd changed. They are good people and they will give you the chance to show them what sort of a person you are
"It wasn't exactly a difficult solution," said Draco, feeling oddly defensive.
"Tabby," said Draco, smiling fondly. "Her name is Kilgharrah and she's
people staring at you, and there's a lot of whispering, but nobody actually looks hostile."
Lucius held out his hand to Harry, who grasped it firmly. The two men locked gazes for a moment, and then the solemn mood evaporated and the three Malfoys sat down, with Narcissa giving both Teddy and Harry a hug before doing so; Draco followed her with handshakes.
Suddenly it occurred to him that if Draco came out of the shower and found Harry still sitting there in his towel, it might look as if he'd waited there just to ogle him. He jumped up from the sofa and rushed into the bedroom to change; he had to admit to himself that he
"I think it must be," said Draco. "I thought at first it might be Venus, but it's not quite bright enough, and then I remembered that Venus was due to set just before the Sun and Mercury just after the Sun."
Harry looked concerned. "I don't want you spending all your free time on something for me," he protested.
"No," said Harry. "At least... No, I don't think so. I don't think I told Ron or Hermione, and I haven't really talked to anyone else."
Harry and Draco are each quite surprised at what the other has been doing.
, did you? I don't know what you're playing at, but I'm not going anywhere with
"I'm sorry to hear that," said Draco. "What did you say to her?"
forgive you, years ago. Because we had a big row about it when your name came up in conversation and they found out that
The plan was for this to be the last part, but I'm not quite there and I can't stay awake any longer! So there will be one more part tomorrow.
"They are," said Ron. "I never dreamed I'd say that, but Draco has changed, and I'm proud to call him my friend. And I've never seen Harry as happy as he has been since Draco turned up."
"Do you really hug everyone you side-along with?" he asked.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Draco, good luck. If you can make any progress, I'll be very impressed."
"I hope you're not in that mood right now, though? said Harry worriedly. "You'd tell me if I was irritating you, wouldn't you?"
As he finished, he found Harry gazing at him. Draco gazed back, feeling his face redden, but then Harry collapsed in giggles. "This is now the official most unlikely moment of my life," he managed to get out. "If you'd told me, when we were at school, that one day I'd be walking through London in the middle of the night with Draco Malfoy singing me a song about Christmas crackers, I'd have thought you'd gone mad."
Draco’s flush deepened. "It’s not just that," he said. "I’m gay, and I’m never sure how strangers will take that if they find out, and I suppose I’ve always been a bit paranoid about what people think of me, especially since the war. That’s the main reason I moved to Manchester, after all. So it’s sort of become second nature to hide stuff from strangers."
was fun. The only trouble is, it turns out I can't have a crutch! I was sort of looking forward to being Long John Silver."
"So it's not that you have anything against Christmas decorations in general?" asked Harry, looking troubled.
"But you... I didn't think you were gay," said Harry, confused.
"I know," said Draco, sounding defeated. "But I think we both know the reason they didn't, don't we? I'm almost positive it's to do with what we discussed the other day. At least, I
"Well, I suppose it may seem as if we're moving a bit fast," said Draco, "but life's too short to waste time when I think we both know what we want. It's not as if we've just met, after all."
Draco nodded, and Harry grabbed a handful of Floo powder. "Pendennis View," he said, throwing it into the fire. He took hold of Draco's arm, and they both stepped into the flames.
Harry had shivered deliciously as Draco's fingers brushed his nipples. "Don't apologise, I'm loving it," he said. "I hope that's not all the nipple measurements?"
Harry looked up sharply. "

"Nonsense," said McGonagall. "Being treated normally is a two-way process, and it sounds as if that's far from what happened on the train. I can assure you that I will be speaking to all the students about this matter when they arrive."
"I'm not surprised," Draco told him. "Not many people your age can do it. And lots of older people can't, either. I've never managed it."
"Nineish sounds fine," said Ron. "Better not leave it much later, anyway, because if we haven’t found any evidence by two o’clock we’ll have to release him. Our three days expire then."
"Got it in one."

"I think it's possible to see even more from here, but not till we're out of twilight," said Harry. "In the meantime, please remind me where Draco is. I can never remember."
“Wizard rather than magician, but yes,” said Harry. “And yes, Draco is too, and so are most of our friends. And probably most of those strange people who’ve turned up to watch you.”
"Bedroom?" asked Harry at the next pause. Draco responded by grabbing Harry's hand and pulling him towards the only part of the flat Harry had not yet seen.
The basking only last for a minute before another customer turned up at the window, but Draco was in a sufficiently good mood that he hardly used

"Sounds good," said Harry. "What's your usual?"
"I take it you heard everything the doctor said, then?" he asked. "And, sorry for not asking immediately, but how are you feeling? I must say you seem quite a bit better than when we arrived."
"… That you’ve only had one serious partner since you came out, and that ended amicably a few years ago, and since then you’ve apparently not seen anyone, so you’re currently single. Yes."
needs his voice to be perfect by then."
Draco had already blushed more times in the previous hour than in the whole of the rest of his life, he decided, but at Ron's words he felt his entire body become flushed with colour. He bowed his head to give him the chance to restore some of his dignity. When he looked up again, he found both Ron and Hermione gazing at him with... could that be

The café was on the edge of what was clearly the market square, although the stalls were currently deserted.

"I know, it's just... still strange to see
"Potter, I am impressed," said McGonagall. "And not just because I heard you correctly use the word 'exacerbated', startling though that was. I am impressed, and slightly embarrassed. I'm embarrassed because everything you said is not only very wise and sensible but also very obvious... yet you are the first person to make this suggestion, and it should have been
"Better," said Draco into Harry's shoulder.

obvious."
Draco strode to the counter and returned soon after, carrying two cups, one of which he put down in front of Harry.
"Next Saturday. Against Gryffindor. We should win quite easily, in theory. The only good player on the Gryffindor team is James Potter, but the rest of his team is terrible, so the only way he can save them is by scoring millions of goals single-handedly. No-one on the Slytherin team is individually as good as him, but we're all fairly competent and we work well together. Al and I seemed to take the other teams by surprise last year – they all assumed that because we're both quite skinny we wouldn't be any good as Beaters, and by the time they realised we're stronger than we look we'd usually already won. This year will be a bit harder, because now they all know what we can do, but I still think we can beat Gryffindor."
as keen as you, so please stop apologising for the raincheck. If you'll recall, one of the main things we've been talking about recently is how tired you are and what we can do about it, so I'm pleased that you were comfortable enough to say so that night."
"Thanks, Harry," she said, then turned to the first customer in the queue. "Right, love, what was it? Fish and chips twice? D'you want salt and vinegar?"
," he said bitterly, and went on to describe his toilet-related nightmare.
"What the bloody hell was that?" asked George, from behind Harry.
"Oh, shut up, Joanne," said Ginny a bit too loudly, turning to look. "He knows I exist. He'd just rather be at work than be with me. But I'll forgive him because he's HOT." She jumped up from her chair and tried to step towards Harry, but somehow managed to get her feet tangled with each other and fell sideways into her friend's lap, giggling.
This last word was a yell, and moments later could be heard the sound of someone galloping downstairs. Teddy appeared in the doorway, wearing pyjamas.
"Damn, indeed," said Harry. He sighed. "If this was a one-off, I might suggest we try without. But I want it to be perfect."
there. She was distraught the year you finally called things off with Ginny and then stayed away at Christmas."
Draco opened his eyes and found Harry looking back at him.
"Yes, one each, please," said Hermione, at which Harry nodded. Draco thought it seemed a little unprofessional of Harry to serve his friends when all those people were before them, but he kept his mouth shut.
"And... maybe you could call me Draco? Malfoy reminds me of the boy I used to be, and I don't like to be reminded of him."
It's all to do with David Beckham. I actually thought of the vague outline of this story ten years ago, and I remember discussing it with
Harry looked at him, intrigued, and Draco led him over to the piano, where he opened the stool and rummaged through a pile of music books that were inside, before choosing one and opening it.
Harry grinned. "I knew I could count on you," he said. They left the lift and turned a corner, and found Ron in discussion with several other scarlet-robed Aurors. Ron’s robes clashed horribly with his hair, and Harry suspected Draco must be biting his lip in an effort to refrain from commenting.
growing on their head?"
stay for dinner first, won't you?"
Why Manchester? Not that I'm complaining – I've never been there."
"There you go, changing the subject again," said Harry, stroking the side of Draco's neck with his thumb. "I'm starting to think that maybe you don't want to kiss me after all?"
fansites. We all share an obsession of thinking about Merlin and Arthur together."
He led Draco into the front room and muttered a spell to light the fire. A second utterance lit up the fairy lights on a Christmas tree that had previously been lurking in the darkness. Draco smiled at the sight, and moved closer to the fire to warm himself.
I saw the Houses of Parliament once, but I might have imagined that. But it
"Only daydreamed? What about at night?" asked Harry, half-jokingly.
Draco stared at him for a moment, and then beamed and kissed him. "I love you too," he said. "I hope you already knew that, but I'm glad we said it. And I kind of like the fact that you were buried deep inside me when we did."
, honestly."
"I don't think they'll bother you if we're not here," said Harry tersely. "And it's not as if you have no
"Is that what it is?" asked Harry. "I saw it yesterday, but I only really registered that it was a big bird. Should've recognised a phoenix, I suppose. Bit harder to spot when it's all white, in my defence, though."
"What's a countertenor?" asked Ron.
Harry took both of Draco's hands in his, as Beth played the intro, and then sang looking directly into his eyes.
"Huh," said Ron, from the front row of the congregation. "Never seen that before."
to the other one," Harry said.
Harry, who appeared to be at the ugly-crying stage of appreciation (not that Harry could ever be described as ugly, Draco thought), sat there transfixed as Draco sang the last verse staring straight at him. They held each others' gaze as the audience, led by Pansy, whooped all around them, until finally Draco grinned and bowed.
Draco smiled. "Well, it's a better bedtime story than what
"Alright, Harry?" he said, grinning and shaking his hand. "Gracias, Lourdes, yo... erm, I've got it from here." The woman nodded and left.
"Hot chocolate," said Harry suddenly. "That's what I want. Are you really tired? There must be somewhere that's still open that has hot chocolate. D'you fancy sitting down for a bit and chatting? It's fine if you need to sleep, though. We can always do it another time."
Draco stared at him. "I'd be delighted," he said. "But are you sure? What happened to waiting a few weeks?"
mother, and it skipped a generation," he suggested, then nodded to someone behind Harry. Harry looked round to see Albus and Lily approaching, flanked by Scorpius and Draco. Albus and Scorpius were holding hands, and Harry grinned at them, at which they both blushed but didn't let go.
"Do you remember the last line?" asked Harry. "
"Go through to the kitchen," said Hermione. "I just need to put Hugo to bed, and then I’ll join you."
Harry nodded, lost in the view. He jumped a little a few minutes later, when Draco nudged him. "Harry... there's something I need to talk to you about, and I've been putting it off for ages. Can we go and sit on that bench before I lose my nerve?"
necessarily mean that Harry was ready to be ravished to within an inch of his life. "Bedtime," he said. He pulled back the duvet and got into bed, holding his arms open in invitation. Harry didn't hesitate: within seconds he was lying next to Draco and covering them both with the duvet.
Draco pulled the red hood over his head, and bent his neck so that his face was invisible. Slinging Harry's book bag over his shoulder and shoving his hands into the hoodie's front pocket, he nudged Hermione with his elbow. "After you," he said.

Harry has a talkative visitor.
"How long will it last?" asked Ron, who had relaxed but was still slumped on the floor with his back to the door.

a good idea, and I’ve been here ever since," said Draco, who was apparently quite amused at Harry’s slurping, if the look on his face was anything to go by. "It just seemed like a good idea to make a break after the war, and get away from all the places where I was well-known for all the wrong reasons. But I wanted to be in a big city, so since London was out of the question it seemed obvious to try Manchester. I was told the wizarding community here is very welcoming, and that’s definitely true."
Harry digested this while Draco took the biscuits out of the oven and put them on the worktop to cool. "I want to fix this," he announced, after a minute. "I want to take you shopping and glare at anyone who looks at you even slightly the wrong way."

stuff. It’s not worth arguing, trust me."
"Ice-skating? No," said Harry. "I always wanted to, when I was little, but they would never have let me. And I’ve never got round to trying it since. Is there a rink near here, then?"
"Malfoy?" she said. "Am I imagining things? I know I hit my head, but you seem a strange thing for me to invent."
"If I can," said Draco. "What do you need?"
"Oh, bloody hell," said Ron, flushing even redder. Harry, however, put his arm round Draco and grinned at him wickedly.
He hadn't thought it was possible for Harry's blush to deepen any further, but it did now. "I think you must be getting delusional in your old age," said Harry. "But thank you for the compliment. It's been quite a while since I was called good-looking. Especially by someone like
"It'd be a bit weird at first, I suppose, after we've been sleeping together for so long," said Ron thoughtfully. "Stop smirking, you prat! But, like you said – well, like you said in my

Harry looked at him in horror, and Draco just laughed all the more. "I'm
"Of course," said Harry. "They obviously make each other very happy, which is all I'm bothered about." Draco nodded his agreement.
," he said. "Please will someone explain it it me in short words?"
He stepped over to the window to see what the view was like. It had just started to snow outside, and the sky was already quite dark, although the very tip of the sun was still just poking above the horizon over to the far left. Draco deduced from this that the window faced north, and belatedly realised that of course Harry's rooms were in the Training Grounds Tower. Peering down, he now noticed the Training Grounds, with the Quidditch pitch in the distance to one side and Hagrid's cottage just visible to the other.
"It's my pleasure," Draco assured him. "But I'll feel better when some actual tangible progress has been made. I wasn't entirely happy with how things were left; there was no definite outcome or action points, he just said to leave it with him."
"I'm not sure I should tell you," said Draco. "It might exacerbate your injuries. Your husband almost died laughing when I told him."
"Well, everything I currently own is either in this wardrobe or in those two drawers," said Harry, pulling them open to display their contents. "I have no idea how many clothes normal people have, but I'd quite like to have a few more than I have now. So, a full wardrobe, I suppose, please, because all this stuff is getting a bit tatty. Are you sure you don't mind, though? It sounds like a huge job."
"The main thing that's occurring to me right now is that I'm really impressed that you're doing this at all, but I suspect that'll be ongoing, so just take it as read," said Harry, smiling. "In the meantime, the most important things about camping are to keep dry and warm, to be comfortable, and to eat and drink all the time. So sling that bag into the tent, put an extra jumper on, and bring the chairs out. We may as well have some of that cake, mightn't we? And how about hot chocolate?"
"No, I don't really need one," said Harry. "Ron's got one – he doesn't really need it either, but he likes it – but it's in Devon. It's fine, though, we'll just get a cab. Once she's at Grimmauld Place, we can get someone from St Mungo's to come and see her. I'm not sure whether or not it'd be safe to Apparate her while she's got broken bones."
Harry smiled, and was about to answer when a large silver bird floated through the ice-covered window behind Ron's head. The bird landed on the table in front of Harry.

"Hello, Ginny," said Harry, as Draco nodded politely but remained silent. "So what's this solution you've found, then?"
been an emotionally draining few hours – but he was keen not to spoil this surprising new whatever-it-was with Harry. "OK, you're on," he said; he was pleased to note that Harry appeared delighted at this response. "But only if you promise to tell me about you as well. I assume you're Head Auror by now, are you?"
"It was quite a good one – the best
"How long have you been up here, then?" asked Draco.
Draco burst out laughing. "Is that your best line, Potter? I'd've thought even you might be a bit more suave than that."
say I didn't want to break the bond!"
"Ouch," said Harry. "No, you've never told me that before. But remember how awkward you felt round about that time? You were so worried about being fair to both me and Ginny that you hardly said anything to either of us for ages."
"True. And Ron would probably have freaked out even more when I made him help me. He was already unimpressed at having to touch my…"
"Oh, please," Padma said, grinning. "Ravenclaw here, but more importantly someone who grew up with you and saw what you were like with him. You weren't friends with him at school, but you always paid attention to him, and everyone knows that you both saved each other's lives during the war. There's no-one else I can think of that you'd describe as "an old friend but it's a bit more complicated". Plus, I've seen even Hermione and Ron try to get you to do sensible things such as eat and sleep, and you've always come up with an excuse, so it figures that the one person you'd listen to would be the one you were obsessed with at school."
to be done on the first Monday of the month, of course, but there always seemed to be people who thought they did). On top of all this, there were several train cancellations and many delays, due to the snow. By ten o'clock, though, things had started to calm down, and Draco was finally able to think about the events of the night before.
"I do miss our villa in Tuscany, I must say," said Narcissa. "But we've grown used to having to stay in England. And it's a lot better now we've moved north – I love it up here. I can't wait to show you round. But that will have to wait till tomorrow. Now, come and say hello to your father. Are you hungry?"
Harry smiled. "Well, if it does make you feel better, I'm very glad. And, if you recall, you apologised to me at the same time as thanking me, so as far as I'm concerned we're even. The only thing I regret is that we've never had the chance to talk
An hour later, the three Malfoys bundled themselves up in coats, scarves, jumpers, gloves and hats, and set off tor a walk . The tour of the house had indeed been quick: two rooms downstairs (living room and kitchen) and two bedrooms upstairs, one either side of the minuscule bathroom.
"Yes, definitely," said Harry. "I'm freezing. It's pretty, though, isn't it? Let's see – I think there's an Apparition point in the middle of Grosvenor Square. That's near here, isn't it?"
"There's a story behind that," said Draco.
"Eventually. I scored four, but the Cannons were unusually good. Every time one of us scored, they got one back. But then Gemma finally caught the Snitch, and here I am. Now, answer the question!"
"As you all know, this bonding originally happened because I was an idiot," said Ginny. "But in this case I'm glad I was an idiot, because otherwise we might never have found out how well these two are suited. They bring out the best in each other, and I think they're both better people when they're together. I didn't think they'd ever forgive me for what I did, and I wouldn't have blamed them. But they've both been kind and thoughtful to me, even when I didn't deserve it. And I want to tell them both, on behalf of everyone here, that we love them, and that we're all thrilled to see them so happy."
A couple of days later, Draco was in the foyer of the Guildhall, staring at the baubles on the Christmas tree and lost in thought.
"If they think
"Same," she said. "But that's enough work talk. How's Harry, and how are the two of you getting on with the reinvention? I was so pleased when I got your text about that - I know you'd been worried about him for a while. And... there it is!"
He was intrigued to notice that Draco's blush deepened. Emboldened, he decided to risk not letting go of Draco's arm when they started to walk again. Draco glanced at him and smiled shyly, but did not resist. "Where are we going, then? Do you live nearby?" he asked.
"I blame myself, though," said Harry. "And I

he was doing, but I did get a few glimpses. And you were there a lot of the time. When he made you torture that blond Death Eater, for example."
"More than me, apparently," said Harry ruefully. "I seem to have pushed it to a corner of my mind and forgotten I needed to address it at some point. Poor Draco spent weeks trying to find the right way to mention it, and when he eventually did, I didn't realise what he was talking about at first, and thought he was breaking up with me."
now in the Hogwarts Library!" Draco held Harry to him, shaking with laughter. But then he stopped quite suddenly.
"As you're probably aware, I was an Auror until this time last year, as was my good friend Ron Weasley," he went on, nodding to Ron and receiving a grin in return, "but at that point we'd both been feeling for quite some time that it wasn't really what we wanted to be doing, and that there were probably other people who would be better at it than we were. But we'd never talked about it or done anything about it, until Draco Malfoy came back into our lives and we found ourselves talking about things that had been unspoken for too long." He beckoned Draco forward.
"Not at all," said Draco. "I'm well aware that you're Harry's family. I suspect it would take a lot more than an awkward scene with an ex-girlfriend to keep him away, and I wouldn't dream of discouraging him from anything that was important to him."
(See the end of the chapter for
They stopped to stare at it again, and Harry tilted his head to one side. "I
There was a silence in which they all gaped at him, and then Professor McGonagall smiled fondly at them as her ex-students all bellowed "WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PUB!"
"Not since… we last saw you," said Narcissa. "That was one of the conditions. It took us a while to learn, but we both enjoy cooking now, although Lucius does more of it than I do. He makes a particularly excellent chicken and mushroom pie, which I suspect may well be making an appearance tonight."
"Our song? Why?"
*******
"Pity," said Harry. "That piece of knowledge is really the only thing that makes it exciting to look at. It's just a fairly unimpressive blob really, isn't it? Not like the Pleiades. They're my favourite thing in the sky, after Orion. Look, they're already up." He twisted around to point to the north-east.
Harry was quiet for a moment, and then laughed. "You know what? It occurs to me that whenever I've been with anyone, it's never started with an in-depth discussion of why a serious relationship might not work," he said. "Usually I've at least kissed them before we get to the soul-searching. And I've always wanted to see what it's like to kiss you. Can I?"
"Yes, I'm being paid and everything," Draco said. "So, I think you know most of this, but just in case... It was arranged via the college, but they haven't been involved in any of the details. There are four performers, and because we're all postgrad they're letting us sort it out ourselves. There's a flautist and a cellist, and Rabia's playing the piano, and then there's me. We're each doing twenty minutes, and the only request is that there's a romantic theme, and they've asked for well-known popular things. Oh, and the curator is sorting out the seating and decorations in the room - she says she's got a load of holly to put all over the place. Should be pretty. "
"OK, but don't say I didn't warn you," said Draco. "I've been living in Muggle London, and I have a job in the ticket office at my local train station."
Harry winked at her, laughing giddily. "Glad to be of service," he shouted. "Now, does anyone have any objection to us just walking off while they're still clapping? I have some important fucking to do."
Draco nodded. "I’m confused, though," he said. "Where are we going? I thought the detention area was near the courtrooms, so we got out of the lift too early, didn’t we?"
"I didn't realise I was so tired, but I feel amazing now," said Draco. "I hope you haven't been waiting for me before you could eat? You should have woken me."
"Well, there's still time," said Potter, and grinned at Draco. "But he hasn't done anything to upset me yet, so I've had no excuse."
"Thank you, Professor," said Draco, bowing to her and trying not to think about how pink his face must be. "I hope so too." She nodded with a smile, Apparated, and was gone.
"I'm fine... at least, I am now," said Harry. "I wasn't at first, but this summer has been just what I needed. And I know it was you, Ron, that persuaded your family that it was fine to leave me in your room on my own for most of the time, so thank you."
He took Draco's hand, and they continued to wander past the market stalls, comfortable with their silence.
more than just friends? I suspected, but I wasn't actually sure till just now. Good for you.
, by the way. I'm going to have wank fantasies about that for years."
a slight change to the format this time. They've decided that there's a whole category of voters that they're not paying enough attention to, so there's an additional speaker today, and he'll go right before you. Just thought I'd better warn you first, because it's probably a few years since you've seen him, and I'm not sure how you'll feel about it."
"None taken," said Draco. He hadn't actually expected Potter to answer his question, and the fact that he
"Draco, you're scaring me," said Harry, suddenly wondering if maybe the last twelve months had been a dream and this was his rude awakening. "What's wrong? Is it something I've done? Please tell me, so I can fix it."
"Popular as in pop songs, or well-known classical?"
"I'm so sorry, Harry, Draco," said Teddy, who had been hanging back until now. "He asked me to bring him here when I told him you were together. I thought he just wanted to come and say hello. Erm, are you two naked in there?"
?" he asked, incredulously. "Oh, no, wait. There’s a cricket ground too, isn’t there? I can picture you watching cricket."
"I don't know how much I've changed since I last saw you," mused Harry. "Maybe you can tell me, after we've talked. But mainly I was just intrigued. I have no idea what you've been doing since we left school, and I hadn't realised I
Harry scratched his forehead, still holding Draco's hand with his other hand. "Yeah, sorry about that," he said ruefully. "I asked Seamus to create a distraction so people would have something other than us to stare at. I didn't know he was going to actually put your name in it."
"Have you ever..." started Harry.
"It's well known that Draco Malfoy has been missing from the wizarding world for many years," said Rita. "Where has he been? Have you been in touch with him all along?"
"Fine by me," said Ron, getting to his feet. "Hermione? Any objection?"
Harry started to smile. "It's fine," he said. "Actually, you're completely brilliant, because I feel quite calm now. How do you
"It's not quite as bad as it was," said Hermione. "And he seems happy enough there. These days, anyway."
It turns out they're both on the same page.
Narcissa had reached the table by this stage, and she nodded approvingly as she settled herself in her chair. "You'd better wake your father, Draco," she said.
"Oh, bloody hell, here we go again," moaned Ron.
"You're all more than welcome to visit any time, of course," added Draco. "Just let us know when, so we can open the wards for you."
. You're always sitting reading a book, and Mum's always writing long messages to people at work." James didn't meet Harry's eyes when he said this, which was unlike him, but starting conversations about his parents' relationship was also not something he'd ever done before, so Harry didn't worry too much. About
been to sleep) Draco was running up the steps from Warren Street tube station. It was quite a bit warmer than the day before, but there was still quite a bit of ice and frost around, so he was careful to keep hold of the handrail. When he reached the top, he was startled to find Harry waiting there.
many people at once," Draco added. "It's only fair to tell you that I doubt any other wizard in the world could do what Professor Potter just did.
"Well, yes and no," said Harry. "I think we definitely have a deeper connection than we did yesterday. But it doesn't feel to me as if that's part of the bond spell. I think it's just because we've got to know each other so much better."
Draco and Harry had spent most of the rest of Saturday ambling round the grounds, after Harry realised how much he'd missed fresh air; they'd then spent the whole of Sunday planning their curriculum for the week, and had even had a few practice duels, all of which had ended in fits of giggles. They'd still been laughing when they'd finally fallen into bed, but they'd quickly been distracted by each other's nakedness. Draco had considered mentioning how much he was desperate to fuck Harry, or be fucked by him – either would be fine – but he knew that Harry would mention it himself when he was ready. In the meantime, he was still happier than he'd ever been.
NB this may make your teeth rot due to extreme fluffiness.
"I had nightmares for years about Dumbledore falling from there. It's not something I like to remember," said Harry. "Anyway, you
"I think it’s nice," said Harry. "Do you think she’d like to do mine, too? I’d ask Helen, but she’s a bit… Well, she’s a great PA, but I don’t think decorating is her sort of thing."
Draco took out a handkerchief and wiped the moisture away, before covering Harry's hand with both of his own. "I'm sorry, love," he said. "Please don't worry. It's not even really anything that bad, I've just been bottling it up for too long and now I've made it seem worse than it is."
"Fucking hell, Draco, that feels amazing," said Harry weakly. "I've never had that done to me before. Don't stop."
"That was a lesson for all of us," agreed Harry, blushing. "But you're right, Draco and I are great. In fact, he's made me realise I'm been ignoring a massive issue, and that's what I've been thinking about all week."
proud of you. So much so that I'm going to throw caution to the wind here: I can't help noticing that you've been holding my hands for several minutes now, and that you've turned me towards you and our faces are very close together. So I can't help wondering whether you were ever planning to kiss me?"
. I had an owl from Ginny, and I suppose it's unsettled me a bit. I was feeling quite positive this morning, but now..." He shrugged his shoulders.
Receiving a nod from Hermione, he went on: "The first song I'm going to sing today is actually the first one I ever sang for Harry. It's called
and was written by a Muggle composer called Puccini. It's fairly well-known among Muggles, so those of you who are Muggle-born may well have heard it before. It's in Italian, but the title means "None Shall Sleep". In the opera that it's from, it's sung by a prince who falls in love with a princess, and she will only marry someone who can answer some riddles that she's set. He answers all of them, but she still doesn't want to marry him, so he sets a riddle of his own, which is to guess his name before dawn - if she can't, she has to marry him. She decrees that none of her subjects are allowed to sleep until someone finds out his name, and she'll kill them all if they don't. For some reason he still wants to marry her despite this, and that's when he sings this song."
"Sorry, Gin," said Harry, smiling ruefully. "I had fun this afternoon, though – it was good to catch up. Say hi to Neville for me, yeah?"
Draco took the proffered note and read it.
"Well, I can hardly forget you said anything when I'm
want to?" he finished, suddenly worried.
"Well, actually, if you hadn't been here I would probably have just kept it all to myself. I love Ron and Hermione to bits, but neither of them is very good at giving me space. They always try and get me to talk to them if something's bothering me, but sometimes I just don't want to talk, and they never seem to accept that. What you did – making me feel comfortable enough to talk when I felt up to it, but not forcing me to do it
Draco's songs:
He noticed, as he catalogued his surroundings, that Harry had hung several porcelain snowmen from the curtain rail, and they were all moving ever so slightly, catching the glow from the street lights outside in the square, which had just come on. The snowmen each wore a big smile, and Draco realised that his own mouth was fixed in a huge grin, and had been ever since he'd lain down. Experimentally, he tried to
"It's a more powerful spell than it seems, isn't it?" he said. "Don't expect to be able to disarm more than one person at once straight away, though. It takes a lot of focus and determination. And practice."
"Bluetooth speaker," he said, to Harry's quizzical look. "Just watch." He set the speaker down on the bench between them and spent a minute fiddling with his phone. Then Harry gasped as the sound of an orchestra suddenly burst out from the speaker. Draco stood up.
He shook everyone’s hands, kissed Harry, and stepped into the fireplace with a wave.
reassuring to know that we won't be forced into anything. Thank you."
"The pavement wasn't even that icy, actually," said Hermione. "But yes, I did slip, and twisted my ankle. And I put my hand out to break my fall, and that's how I snapped my wrist. And I think I banged my head on the railing at the entrance to the tube station. I'm not sure, though. It felt like everything went into slow motion for a minute, and I was split between trying not to fall and trying not to drop my bags, and the indecision meant I did both."
Draco grinned and reached inside his coat for it. Hermione's jaw dropped open as she took it. "Malfoy, I take back anything I've ever said about you," she said, smiling. "Thank you so much. Does that mean my other stuff is here too?" Her eyes widened as Draco nodded towards the pile of bags under the chair.
leave, wearing this hoodie with the hood up, and Ron and Hermione leave with me, I think there's a pretty good chance your stalkers will think I'm you, and follow us. All you have to do is wait a few minutes while we lead them away, and then you can escape and get some time to yourself."
“You’re incorrigible, but I love you,” Draco told her. “Thanks so much for today.” He gave her a quick peck on the cheek; Harry copied him, and then followed him out of the room.
"You're a better person than me, you know," said Harry after several minutes. He gazed out of the window, not looking at Draco.
"You know, I'm relieved you're here," said Harry. "Last night felt a bit like a dream by the time I woke up. I did briefly wonder whether I'd imagined the whole thing."
better to just make them forget about you. Anyway, are you ready to go, Hermione?"
"I promise to try not to look at you too invitingly," Draco promised, grinning. "Now, isn't it about time we set off?"
"Blissfully. It'd be quite sickening if it wasn't so adorable. You can see for yourself - I'm definitely going to want them to meet you at some point."
Teatime the next day found Harry and Draco waiting for Ginny in the garden at The Burrow, both in a very subdued mood. Ginny's message had caused their nascent relationship to falter for the first time, and Harry wasn't sure how to fix things. Draco had instantly closed himself off emotionally, and he'd reacted noncommittally to all Harry's increasingly desperate attempts to talk to him. Harry had mainly been thinking out loud, wondering what the chances were of Ginny having found a solution where
Malfoy had still been sitting separately with his head down until this statement, but now his head snapped up and he stared at Harry, his brow furrowed with what appeared to be a mixture of fury and bewilderment. (Harry was a bit taken aback to realise that he could interpret Malfoy's body language, but decided to put this thought aside to examine later.)
"I know, but we both really like it, so we thought we'd have a bonus early one. It won't be as good as Mum's, obviously, but I'm looking forward to it."
Draco rolled his eyes, nodded and Apparated.
Seamus laughed. "Of course you don't, because you never expect anyone to do anything for you," he said. "But I will just point out that this is something I
Draco blushed at that, but was unable to remove his grin. "I think it's surprised both of us, but we certainly seem to be on the same wavelength. We have more in common than anyone would have predicted. I'm enjoying spending time with him."
," said Teddy. "I thought they would have tried, if they'd wanted to."
Harry was mortified, but decided that he'd never forgive himself if he didn't take advantage of this opening. "It is," he said. "I am, too. Very happy, in fact. But... Look, this is really hard for me to say." Draco laughed out loud, startling Harry until he realised what he'd said. "Oh my God, are you
Draco stared at Harry, trying to decide whether or not he was serious. After a few moments he realised that Harry was actually clueless.
THE END
"It felt weird
"You mean to say you weren't sufficiently entertained by Harry's snowman?" demanded Ron, reappearing with the drinks.
“OK, well I’m a bit confused by that, but always willing to try a miracle,” said Harry. “What do you need?”
"I've never thought of it that way before," said Harry. "I mean, Cho was the first person I ever fancied, and then it was Ginny for years, although I realise now that that did fade a bit. But, because I was with Ginny, I didn't really ever think about whether or not I found anyone else attractive."

"Well, that wasn't really a proper concert, was it? But I suppose it counts," said Harry. "The one tomorrow is definitely a proper one, though, isn't it?"
"When I got home after I saw you on Saturday night, I went straight to bed, but I didn't sleep for quite a while, because I was thinking about you. Most of all, I was thinking about the way you
Harry let out a relieved sigh. "I do," he admitted. "I really, really do. But I've been trying not to think about it, because... well, what else is there for me to do? And we're partners, so if I quit it'd have an impact on you too, which is why I kept wanting to talk to you about it, but it was too difficult to contemplate, so I kept putting it off and hoping things would just get better."
is the reason I wanted Rabia as my accompanist," Draco said. "She's the best, and I didn't think any of the others would be up to that one."
"I think you can expect to be here until the morning – maybe ten o'clock, but not much later," said the nurse. "We need to keep up the intermittent obs until breakfast, but there hasn't been anything to worry about with the ones I've taken so far. If that remains the case, we'll just send you to the plaster room to get your wrist and ankle plastered – they only work daytimes, so you can't go till then anyway – and then we'll discharge you with a week's worth of painkillers and an appointment for the fracture clinic. You'll need a lot of help at home for a while, though – will that be a problem?" She looked at Ron expectantly.
Harry smiled. "Well, I'd love it if you'd sing one more song before we go."
"No."
Draco nodded. "I notice you've not mentioned his sister, though," he said, carefully. "I'm curious – are you still with her? If you don't mind me asking, of course."

"But, sir! That's not fair! You let Caroline go. And Elizabeth. And Michael." The girl glared at Draco balefully. This, it turned out, was just what Draco needed to regain control: by reflex, he glared back, and the full force of

Harry stared at Ron throughout this speech, increasingly dumbfounded. Ron cocked his head to one side and raised his eyebrows as he finished, with a clear look of "am I right or am I right?"
"Must be an R in the month," said Seamus. Then, off Harry's look, "What? You're hardly ever around! You're either teaching or off prostituting yourself for the bloody Ministry. You're certainly not doing anything sensible like... oh, I don't know, sleeping or eating properly. And I

Ron shot him a look.
Draco couldn’t think of any words. He was staring at him, he knew he was staring. He could feel his breath on his face too, and it was impossible not to think about it. That he was close enough to kiss him. And that he wanted to. And that he could.
“He’s changed, that’s all,” said Harry defensively. “I think we ought to give him a chance.”
“I know, but it’s important that she understands-“
“I’m a legilimens,” said Draco.
“Potter-“
Draco reached the empty corridor and counted his steps down to the blank stretch of wall that was the entrance. He whispered the password and pushed the door open when it materialized.
Harry had stopped himself there. Forced himself to start over from Mrs Weasley’s look of surprise. There would probably still be that painful flash of anger, but it wouldn’t be Lucius who stood in her kitchen. Harry had reminded himself that Mrs Weasley was the only one who had never, at any point, forgotten that they were children when they fought in the war. So maybe she would remember that for Draco too.
? Wait - what time is it?"
“Go on,” said Lovegood, gently pushing him forward.
“I have an appointment with the headmistress,” he said.
He nodded. He stood next to his chair with a hand on the back of it.  He was only half listening to the headmistress now. He was remembering Azkaban, but more than that he was remembering his fight with Potter and wondering why that had happened.
“If they’re pure evil, maybe they can be destroyed the same way as the horcruxes? Basilisk venom or fiendfyre?” said Longbottom.
“Those are females. The males have antennae – really, Potter, such a big mistake and you haven’t even started on the potion yet. One might think you didn’t listen when the professor was going over the instructions.”
He would apologize in the morning.
His palms were starting to get sweaty. He glanced towards the door. How long could it take to smoke a cigarette?
“But it’s over now,” Harry said.
“Right, yeah, I do,” he said.
“Why else would I be here?” he asked, a tiny sliver of impatience slipping into his voice.
“It was mentioned briefly in one of my mother’s notebooks – she had a very interesting theory that depression was caused by dementor-possession, but-“
"After they lift it, I will
"I'm not going to sit on your doorstep for two hours, Malfoy. It's bloody freezing out here."
Then the images of Azkaban were drowned by the light of the silver stag that erupted from Potter’s wand.
"I almost got run over five times on my way here," Draco said waving a hand dismissively in his direction. "Just be glad I made it."
“Come off it, Ron.”
The four broomsticks skimmed low over the water. There were the thuds of their shoes on the rocks of the barren island when they landed. No one said a word as Draco led them to the stairs. He felt terribly exposed when they made their way across the island; there was nothing but the darkness giving them cover, and though he was grateful for the moonlight it also meant that anyone looking out would have easily spotted them. But there were no cries of spells from above and soon his hand closed around the slick, cold railing of the stairs. He turned to look back at them.
But there was nothing about Azkaban. The front page was mostly taken up by an article dedicated to the Gringotts tax conflict that had filled the news for the past week. Draco scanned the smaller headlines of other articles, and there was still nothing.
"It's not like recent events did anything to help us past it,” he said.
“Were we?”
“I don’t want you to think-“
“I’m not sure if I am allowed to tell you this, but I know that Kingsley Shacklebolt is currently trying to pass legislation that’ll improve the justice system, possibly even do something about the dementors.”
She stabbed at another Brussels sprout. Harry tried to imagine that conversation and couldn’t think of anything he could say that wasn’t likely to end with Malfoy cursing him.
He leaned his head against the wall behind him.
Draco waited half a metre behind him while he looked out the door to make sure the corridor was empty. Then he stepped out and Draco followed quickly.
feel awful.”
“That’s what your mother told me, but I was wondering if perhaps something else might have happened while you were at home?”
The stairs creaked and groaned as Ron came back down the steps.
Half an hour later, the train pulled into King’s Cross Station, and all four of them turned to the windows, scanning the crowd to look for their families. Harry thought he caught a glimpse of bright red hair and his heart skipped several beats. The breaks of the Hogwarts Express shrieked and Harry climbed onto the seat to pull his trunk from the luggage rack. Draco looked paler than usual, like he might faint any moment.
He took a step back, holding the door open, and Harry stepped inside.
happy thoughts? I swear I’ve never seen her smile.”
“I am serious. It’s just as she said, the Carrows gave us special treatment, and in return they expected us to be cooperative and sympathetic towards their cause and sometimes to be cruel, so we were. Especially the older Slytherins, we were hoping to take some of the attention off the younger ones.”
She nodded.
She sighed.
Then Dean and Seamus came in and Ron turned to them instead, and Harry didn’t try to explain the thing with him and Ginny again. They all began talking about something else and Harry got off his bed to go to the bathroom and brush his teeth.
“You shouldn’t sound so surprised, Potter,” said Draco in the exaggerated, condescending drawl Pansy would use when she was mocking him.
"There's a wizard community here?"
He sounds pissy and obnoxious, and something settles inside Harry. It feels familiar. He knows how to talk to this version of Draco, knows the routine push and shove of their interactions. So he puts a hand on the door and pushes it back.
“I just heard, and I thought since you two were such a picture perfect couple-“
“You should ask him, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Maybe you should have thought about that before joining Voldemort.”
,” he laughed. “This is
McGonagall frowned.
Ron snorted.
The room was empty. The furniture was still there, looking sad and abandoned, but everything else had been tidied up, all the maps and notes and mess. He suspected it was Weasley, or maybe Longbottom who had carefully removed and destroyed all evidence of their mission. The books were gone too. Draco had forgotten all about them, so despite the favouritism of Madam Pince, Hermione Granger had apparently proven herself to be the most conscientious of the two of them and had actually managed to remember something like library fines even in the wake of being nearly burned to death.
Draco looked like shit these days. He shouldn't have tried to see Potter again. He should have kept the mark covered. He should have known he couldn't stay hidden.
too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” his mother said. “Yes, love, it’s me. Draco is here too.”
Ron shrugged.
He hesitated. He didn’t know what to tell her – not about Harry, obviously, but she was looking at him now, and listening, and he didn’t want to waste that on some vague half-truths.
“I’m not… trying to be nice,” he said. “I’m just sort of awful at this… things like this.”
!” to come from Blaise or Matthew, but it was Pansy who said in a curious tone of voice:
"Of course," Daphne said. "You think I got this dressed up for you?"
“I wanted to take the mark,” he said, his voice thick.
“I’m not sure it is.”
“You’re playing into
“To talk to me. I might go see him later.”
Harry stared down at his still half full plate, but his stomach had twisted into tight knots and he was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to eat any more of it if he tried.
“I never really pictured her as the… you know, the most academic type of person, though.”
Ginny shifted.
Malfoy stood up as well as he could with the table and chairs being crammed so tightly in the corner.
“Well,” said Ginny earnestly, “first Professor Snape died…”
He shrugged again.
“They think it’s too risky to associate with me. And by shunning my family for our association with you-know-who they make themselves look better and less like they were all quietly supporting him as well. Why do you think I’m even here in the first place? I wouldn’t need you if I still had them.”
“Firewhisky, was it?” he asked.
Or maybe Potter had already figured it out. Draco had no idea how he could have; he had been so careful around him. He had done his best to act normal. There had been times he had almost made himself forget it. But this wasn’t the sort of thing Potter would just
“Didn’t see you cast one.”
“But if we can’t-“
“How can you get bored with quidditch, though?”
Draco nodded – he wasn’t an idiot.
Harry thought he was feeling a slight buzz from the alcohol. Malfoy seemed more relaxed as well, but he wasn’t sure if it was because of the whisky or because Harry had conceded to the agreement.
“What is wrong with you?”
“I would love to go to Sweden,” she said dreamily. “Bu father really wants me to stay at home.”
Sometimes Longbottom would stop to glance nervously back towards the top of the tower. They probably wouldn’t even hear it if there was a duel up there, but maybe he was hoping to notice light from the spells if something went wrong. Granger would check her watch every time she moved forward to draw the next rune. Draco didn’t know if she was actually keeping track of time or just making sure she didn’t accidentally look into one of the cells. Draco didn’t have any trouble with that – his eyes were constantly and inevitably drawn to the pit. It was the sort of darkness that sucked at your gaze, complete and impenetrable. It wasn’t like looking into a dark room, it was like having a blind spot in the middle of your vision and it was impossible not to try to stare through it.
“It’s alright,” he said. “I don’t mind.”
“But that doesn’t make
“I’ll leave with you,” she said. “We’re not headed in the same direction, and Draco is just going to the library after this anyway.”
“I have never used that word.”
“I don’t see why he would be plotting anything.”
“We’ll have another meeting.”
But he’s fine, he’s holding it together.
Then he too caught sight of the Dumbledore's Army veterans. He grimaced.
Malfoy halted in his urgency.
"He drinks," Malfoy said.
“It was about you, you twat! It’s always been about you.”
"Why would I want to know that?"
“Yeah. And I’ll... think about what you said.”
There was a worn plastic entryphone by the door, peeling labels with the names of the people living there next to the doorbell. And there at the bottom was one that said "Malfoy". Harry stared at it. He had begun to hope that he had made a mistake, that he could just go home to the warmth of Grimmauld Place and feel that at least he had made an effort. But this was apparently it. He hesitated, finger hovering over the button, then took a deep breath and pressed it down.
“I know. And as soon as I manage to escape she’ll be demanding grandchildren. Did you see how she was acting around Fleur?”
Maybe he flinches a little bit, but he doesn’t say anything, so Harry pulls his hand back.
“Well, that’s the important part, isn’t it?”
“How come you’re not on the quidditch team this year?” asked Harry, breaking a long stretch of silence.
Harry’s voice rose loud enough that it echoed up the stairs.
?” Draco gestured to the drop. “There isn’t one! There’s only dementors down there. This is it! This is the core of Azkaban, just thousands of dementors breeding and sucking the life out of this place. I never thought there would be so many in one place, but that certainly seems evil enough to me to explain this place.”
Once they reached land, they disapparated in quick succession.
Ron’s eyes widened.
you, Potter! I thought you had figured that out, but apparently I was giving you more credit for your intellect than you deserve. And I know how very inconvenient it is, which is why I tried to tell you that we should just ignore it.”
"Yeah, I suppose living with someone all the time you're in school forces you to get to know each other."
They were all getting to their feet around him. Draco stayed stubbornly seated on the couch.
"I don't know why I did it," he said instead.
“She’s not my girlfriend,” Harry says reflexively.
Harry smiled back across the ocean.
"Only one way to get over that, mate," said one of the boys. "First beer is the hardest. Then you've scaled the wall and it's all downhill from there."
He was still drunk, but in that unpleasant way where the ease and numbness starts to fade and you can feel the uncomfortable press of a hangover reaching for you. He was definitely not drunk enough to say yes. He was surprised Malfoy was drunk enough to ask.
“You said you had a fight with them.”
A second wave of nausea hit him. He was drained, unfocused - he might be able to cast the spell, but he definitely wouldn’t be able to control it.
Harry turned his attention back to the leaflets, and slowly he began to shuffle through them.
She put down her wand and picked up a large, ceramic jar.
“Alright.”
“Yeah, just a second,” he said.
Draco almost laughs. He can feel it rising through him, ugly and hysterical, when it becomes clear that that is actually what Potter wanted to talk about. Not the astronomy tower, not Draco’s murder attempts or his desertion from the Death Eaters. This is about fifth year and all the stuff Draco had almost started to believe was only in his head. It’s too absurd. To hear it brought up now, like this, when they’re at war; when the adults are downstairs talking about shipping Draco off to safety while Harry and their own children stay here and fight; when he is standing there with his wand in his hand, saying that he knew Draco was responsible for Dumbledore’s death, and somehow, it’s still about what they did an eternity ago at Hogwarts.
“He’s not a dark wizard,” said Harry at the same time that Hermione said: “That’s just a myth.”
“It’s fine, I don’t mind talking about it. I just don’t like when people think they’re entitled to my private life just because they’ve already read about it in a magazine. Just because the journalists don’t give a shit about my privacy doesn’t mean it’s a fucking free for all, but… yeah, whatever, it’s fine.”
Harry stopped. The lightness in his body dropped out of him. His stomach turned to lead.
“If you want to,” Potter reeled. “If you were planning on moping around the Slytherin dungeon all evening, I won’t stop you.”
“They seem to think it’s all over, don’t they?”
. You never see people or actions or history with any gradation at all and you forget that other people don’t always feel the same way you do – like the way you’ve been defending Snape all year-”
“Yeah.”
“Sorry,” she said, running a hand through her hair. “I had a bad night. I didn’t mean to be snarky.”
“Next time I’ll cast the patronus charm before it gets past you. And if I can’t, one of us will just cast
Harry stared at him.
“Of course fucking not – Merlin, I spent
A small smile curved the edges of Potter’s mouth and a flood of relief surged through Draco.
“Really?”
“What?”
“Really, Potter?” he asked. “You want to have that conversation? Swap lists of dead people? Merlin, you’re messed up.”
Harry went back to his dormitory to try and get some homework done. Since the mission of Azkaban had started, he had actually managed to get behind on schoolwork again. But he struggled to keep focus, he kept forgetting his place and had to start over again, so he hadn’t read more than a few pages when Ron showed up.
Harry hesitated.
“Have you told anyone?”
For one day, the stunt the Gryffindors had pulled at breakfast was all over the school. The theories for why it had happened quickly spun out of control. A few of them even included the detail that Draco Malfoy had learned the patronus charm, a piece of information that received intense scrutiny and debate, especially from former members of Dumbledore’s Army. For one day, Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were dodging questions and deflecting attention, corroborating Draco’s story when necessary, defending the decision when challenged. And then the
Over time, Draco had become very good at compartmentalizing his feelings. It was a useful skill. It had made it easy for him to learn occlumency.
Ron and the others were waiting by the door.
Pansy looked equally surprised and annoyed to see her.
“Out.”
“I just wanted to see you,” he said finally, which sounded needy and dumb, but felt pretty close to the truth.
Tracey shrugged.
“I suppose not. But it doesn’t really make sense if you can just
“But it’s not just snogging, is it?” asked Hermione cautiously.
“Did you want something?” asked Potter.
“Alright,” said Draco.
“I don’t deserve it,” he said. “I don’t deserve what they’re doing for me.”
He took a step closer to the wall to their left – or towards where it should have been. He reached out his arm and didn’t touch anything.
“She just said you were being an idiot and didn’t elaborate further,” said Daphne. “And I didn’t have anything to add.”
“So everyone knows what to do next time?” asked Longbottom, looking around when it seemed they were done.
, “looks an awful lot like the symbol for
Malfoy lets out a sharp breath that isn’t really a laugh.
Thomas and Finnigan were a few tables over, but they were following the scene with interest and looked like they would jump in the second it turned ugly. Granger hadn’t gotten up to join the wall of Gryffindors between Draco and Potter, but she was watching the scenario attentively. He couldn’t tell from where he stood if she had her wand out, but he remembered the warning she had given him. He suddenly missed Crabbe and Goyle – everything had been so much easier with bodyguards. Draco turned his attention from Ginevra to Ronald.
“Alright,” said Hermione before the two of them could start fighting again. “It’ll just be Malfoy, then.”
“I didn’t know she would be here-“ he began.
"Should I get your friends?"
”No, I mean, why we
“I said I was wondering if-“
“A bit.”
She shook her head.
"Sorry, what?" she croaked into her hand.
“So are you two okay?” she asked.
"D'you want to stay?" he muttered.
There was a slight hesitation in her voice. The words hitched, the pause caught in his ears. His eyes snapped back to her, but her expression didn’t reveal anything. But did she know? Was this about Potter?
The hallway was thankfully empty when he got there. He tried to be quiet, but they must have heard him anyway. He had only just stepped into his shoes when Hermione showed up. Ron didn't. Maybe that was what they had discussed while he was on the phone, the best
“We’re not going to be friends.”
He regretted that decision now. He regretted a lot of things, one of them being telling Potter that he could bring half of Gryffindor if he thought that would help, because apparently the git had taken him on his word. He had expected him to bring Granger, maybe even hoped that he would. As obnoxious as she was, he could see the use of having Potter’s smarter, more magically talented friend working along with them. He knew that Potter would probably bring Ronald, which would be a pain, but an unavoidable one that he would have to work with. He had thought it would end there. He had not expected Ginevra, and definitely not Lovegood or Longbottom, who had just followed her into the room.
“Don’t act like you haven’t given me reason to!” said Potter, stepping towards him. “You’re the one who’s acting suspicious, suddenly not talking to your friends and skulking around outside Gryffindor tower in the middle of the night.”
"Do you miss it?" Malfoy asked.
“Where?” he asked.
“Yeah, I know.”
!” Harry and Draco said in unison.
,” cried Potter again, and then he forced out a “ha!”.
“I’m alright for a little while.”
“It’s too far,” said Seamus. “The Three Broomsticks is right down here. We can visit Aberforth some other day, yeah?”
“Don’t tell them until after Azkaban,” he said.
“Nah, I just wanted to fry some eggs, I haven’t had time to make proper breakfast in a while. There’s tea as well.”
“Right. She seems alright.”
It didn’t come.
Draco kissed him again. He buried his fingers in the dark curls and felt Potter’s hands on his hips and moving up his sides, stroking his back and pulling him closer.
And this was the prison of Azkaban: an enormous, open space between the three outer walls of the tower. An external gallery ran along the walls with cell doors on the right, an iron railing on the left. The galleries below were visible, each forming a band of dim light until some way down, where the lowest stories were swallowed by darkness, making the drop seem endless. And there were dementors. In his mind he had imagined them swarming all over the place, but they were only shadows passing on the galleries below, or they were movements in the deep pit, rising from or descending into the darkness. He dragged his eyes away. He stared at the floor under his feet, at the hem of his mother’s robes. It had not been necessary to tell them not to look into the cells. He didn’t want to see what was in there. He didn’t want to know what happened to people when they were put in a place like this.
“I didn’t mean to – I didn’t mean for something like that to happen,” he pushed on. “And I didn’t know it would bother you so much, but of course I should have thought of that. I wasn’t messing with you when I said it’s not a big deal for wizards. I thought you’d know, but you can ask anyone, they’ll tell you the same thing.”
“Don’t you have anything you want to say to your father?”
“Why didn’t I know about that?”
He moved his wand, their shadows jumped and twisted over the walls. There was an unpleasant crunch from the lock.
“No, you’re right,” said Draco bitterly. “I should have been able to. Like you said, it was just a boggart. And I stood there like a bloody Hufflepuff, I didn’t even-“
Draco didn’t actually know that. He hadn’t found the time to ask him. But he thought it seemed likely, and anyway, if he didn’t know, then neither did any of his house mates.
He felt compelled to go get his broom and take off immediately. Maybe if he had been in Gryffindor, that was what he would have done. Instead, he made his way to the secret room.
“You look very disturbed.”
“So it probably won’t help the cooperation if we tell him not to bring Parkinson because we don’t like her.”
He nodded at the girl across from them.
“How can I be a freeloader? This is my house, I’m saving you guys from paying rent in London.”
,” she said hesitantly. “But they’re not always very good at it…”
"It'll wear off," he said, hoping it was true.
“Hi Draco,” said Daphne. “She’s in there.”
"When doesn't she worry?" he grumbled.
"Goodnight, Draco."
He had also gotten to coach some of the first years for their flying lessons one time when he went back, since Madam Hooch had retired after the war. He had liked that. They’d all been so excited. And they were so tiny. He couldn't believe he had been that small the first time he flew a broom.
There was a second of hesitation before Potter released Draco’s shirt and stepped back. He did not take his eyes off him.
“Yeah, I heard. I thought maybe a troll had gotten in here.”
“I’m not saying it’s your fault, they’re just too Gryffindor for their own good. You know they would all happily die for you.”
“I’m not saying we give up; I’m saying we might have to think of another solution – the others are waiting for us, if we’re not back at the castle by morning-“
Two days before the wedding, the Delacours arrive at the Burrow and the general stress and excitement about the wedding increases even more, half of it now playing out in rapid French. Harry is surprised when Mrs Weasley corners him to ask how he wants to celebrate his birthday – he hasn’t considered it at all; they all have more important things to think about.
Potter groaned and turned around so he had his back to Draco. They still had about forty minutes until breakfast. That meant their dorm mates would probably be awake, so they wouldn’t be able to go back to bed and pretend they had never been away, but it was enough time that Potter could get back to Gryffindor tower and change into something more appropriate before students flooded the halls. Draco picked up his tie.
, in theory. The less specific that place is the more difficult it is. Do you think
“But I suppose we’ll have to split them up for now. You should take the restricted ones; I won’t be allowed to check them out anyway.”
“What’s your point?” he asked tentatively.
Harry glanced up at Granger, who nodded stiffly. Then he stood up and allowed Draco to take his place. Legilimency had always been tied to Slytherin house, and because the Dark Lord had been so skilled at it, it was closely associated with him. Draco couldn’t tell if the expression on Harry’s face was one of worry because of what Draco was about to do, or distaste because he possessed the skill at all.
It felt very strange to climb through the portrait hole to the common room. He felt sure that everyone would be able to tell just by looking at him exactly what had happened. He was very aware of his face. And his mouth. But no one seemed to notice him at all.
Malfoy’s expression doesn’t change.
Draco woke with a start. He had no idea where he was, what time it was, had no sense of anything but the feeling of wave upon wave of panic crashing through him. His whole body was grimy and damp with sweat, the sheets were twisted around him and clung to his skin. His heart was pounding away. He gasped for air. When he tried to sit up, his arms collapsed beneath him, weak with sleep and panic. He swallowed sharp gulps of air as if trying to scream backwards.
“I should have given better directions, I suppose.”
“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Draco says flatly. “I’m sorry to break it to you, Potter, but ever since the redheads adopted you as one of their own, I’m pretty sure they’ve all become targets, whether you’re sleeping with them or not.“
“Clear,” he mouthed, and they all followed him.
Hermione shrugged. She looked nervous.
, and some people can get away with that, fucking Potter senior got up to all sorts of shit when he was in school, but he got to grow up to be a man and a hero, and maybe you’ll get to do that too, but I’ll be
"It'll be fine," Harry said, when it looked like she might go after him.
“You should probably roll down your sleeves first.”
"She went home."
“I suppose,” he said, and it should have sounded haughty, like he only deigned to approve, but it was just breathless and toneless and quiet.
“No, I suppose I’m not.”
A dark blush coloured Hermione’s cheeks, but she pushed on:
Hermione raised her eyebrows in surprise.
Harry looked up, forgetting himself.
Lovegood nodded and began turning the pages.
“Everyone ready?” he asked so quietly the tremor in his voice was hardly noticeable.
“Put yours away first.”
“Ginny. I’ll talk to her, get her to come back. After all, Pansy wasn’t
“I didn’t see you at dinner.”
"So it isn't true?" asked Malfoy.
“How was I supposed to know?” he asks.
“Right?”
“Shit. I swear when I get out of here, I’m never playing cards again,” he said.
"It would spare us both from what I can only assume will be an awkward time in unpleasant company."
He looked into the cells on the way up. It didn’t matter now. He knew what was in them. Some prisoners were chained to the wall, though he couldn’t see any reason for it. Some were drooling and rocking themselves back and forth, but most didn’t move at all. He thought at some point that he wanted to stop looking, but then it seemed he couldn’t. And they walked forever. He had no idea how far up they were when they passed her. A young woman, who moved closer to the bars when they neared her cell. There was something odd and disjointed about her movements. Her features seemed elongated and inhuman, but she was looking right at Draco, and her eyes weren’t dead. She could have been his age, hardly much older.
"Can you make it inside on your own?"
“Yes, I think so. All sane people are.”
“She is my
The doe took a step towards Harry and Draco followed. The dementors had retracted into the darkness, leaving a narrow path for Draco to be led back to the others.
Draco snorts.
"Alright," Draco said. "Get up then, I'll help you find Granger."
Harry suppressed a smile.
Only then did he seem to notice the burns.
reassuring,” said Draco icily, but he was smiling a little.
“We should hurry before a teacher shows up,” he said to the backs of the others.
Granger stood on the path only three meters ahead of them. She hadn’t been there a second ago and they hadn’t heard the crack of someone apparating.
They were getting looks from Ravenclaws as well as Hermione, but Binns just droned on and didn’t notice their whispering at all.
“I’m sure I’ll manage. I try not to think too much about it.”
“But-“
Ron pointed at Draco with a chocolate frog card.
“Piss off,” he said.
“Aren’t we putting an awful lot of trust in Malfoy’s gut feeling about Azkaban?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “See you tomorrow.”
“You told Hermione.”
“But you knew she had studied them?” asked Granger, sounding slightly disappointed.
“Screw that! He’s the one who let the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, he’s the reason Dumbledore is dead and the reason Bill’s-“ Ron stops and glances at his brother.
This time, it was definitely a sigh from Malfoy.
"It's a Starbucks," he said. "You work at Starbucks?"
“Of course I do, I’m helping you keep this a secret, aren’t I? Even though that was never the plan.“
Potter was leaning over his potions textbook, frowning at the instructions. He didn’t even notice when Draco passed his station.
“Well,” she said. “I’ve had to hear from professor Slughorn of all people that you’re planning on taking a year off? Apparently, Mr Malfoy told him.”
"No. It's muggle."
“So do you have to learn Swedish, then?” asked Ginny.
“Doesn’t look like it.”
Harry stared at him. The boy was ginger and freckled enough to pass for a Weasley. His name might have been John or Josh. Malfoy was staring at him like a deer caught in headlights.
