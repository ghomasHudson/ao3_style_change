With one last swipe at Harry's bottom lip, Draco pulled away, his face flushed. "Was that…" he asked weakly, turning a darker shade of red.
Ten seconds later, he had to admit that it wasn't one of the wiser decisions he had ever made in his life because just after arriving at their destination, the cat took off into a run and sprinted into the crowd.
And Draco laughs again, giddy and warm, and he wipes his eyes with his other hand, the one hit by the hex, and it still hurts, that one, but it’s nothing compared to finally,
The cavern echoed with their footsteps, made by boots splashing on puddles. Droplets of water fell from stalagmites and made ripples on the water flooding the cavern floor.
Draco didn't leave his room. What was he supposed to say if he went to Potter's? Sorry you almost died because I was such an arse? No, he didn't know if he could say that. He
Fleur Delacour's hot tears falling on his damp neck as she sobbed in his arms, thanking him for saving her sister.
A wave of guilt and regret gripped his chest. It wasn’t an unfamiliar sensation, but they were becoming more frequent the more of these missions they finished. They were becoming more frequent the less time Harry had left.
“His potion against the sun,” he said, holding the black suitcase up between his thumb and forefinger. “Give it to him on days that he wishes to go out. And –“ He held the brown suitcase up this time. “Your Wolfsbane potion.”
As they got nearer, Blaise showed off his ring with a similar grin. "I just said it was terrible. Didn't say I disliked it."
Professor Albus Dumbledore looked down upon them, a delighted smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes. “It’s not every day that I get visitors in this room.”
After a small pause, Harry nodded slowly. Taking a small piece of spare parchment, he picked up his quill and wrote on it.
Harry was good at this, good at keeping things civil enough – not too friendly but also not awkward. They lived in the same dorm, had the same classes, attended the same fancy parties that Snape forced him to go to every summer, and had the same circle of 'friends'. He convinced himself each and every time that he was satisfied with this.
Harry couldn't take it anymore. He made a grunting noise (Yes, way to go, Potter, very civilized.) to get Draco's attention and when Draco snapped his head up to look at him, motioned towards him with his hand.
He grabs his own robes from the bed, crosses the room, pulls at Draco’s shoulder to turn him around, and can’t help the big smile that slides its way to his lips when Draco simply lets him.
Harry blinked, feeling embarrassingly stupid. He had left the Self-Erasing Parchment upstairs with Ron, so he had nothing to write on. He only hoped that his confusion showed clearly on his face.
And he doesn’t know if it’s because it’s the first time he’s managed to stop himself from falling in the rabbit hole his mind has made, or if it’s because of the pride in Potter’s eyes as he looks at him, or Potter wanting to stay with him, that he finds his eyes becoming warm.
They've talked about it, and Draco barely even batted an eye when Harry mentioned it—simply understood, as he had numerous times before, that it was part of Harry's station as Head Auror and that no matter their relationship and the occasion, there is a grander scheme of things and there are people needing to be saved.
and right now, my opinion of you is becoming less and less favorable the more time I am forced to spend holding this dirty towel –"
“I’m well, Potter, no need to worry your pretty little head over it,” Draco said with mild amusement. His head was still throbbing, but he reckoned the potion was already starting to slowly kick in. He glanced behind Harry’s shoulder, to Kingsley sitting behind his desk, staring back at him with a pointed and exasperated expression.
Ron shot her a nervous smile that probably made him look constipated, before steering his sister by the elbow, efficiently leading her away from the plate of treacle tart that she seemed to be set on monopolizing if her hovering by it and emptying it slice by slice for the past hour was any indication.
“There’s been some research in the healing industry about magic extraction,” Hermione said. “It’s different from magic nullification or magic reversal or even magic destruction. It started in the underworld, I believe, because of the frequency that Dark Wizards used curses on each other. These curses were often body-debilitating curses or magic-sapping curses, very potent ones that had dire consequences on the body the moment it even touched you. That’s why
On his good days, he liked to think of how good his self-control was that he hadn't done any of the two yet. On his bad days, he'd look back on his life choices and wonder what he did to deserve falling in love with possibly the most infuriating (but also undeniably the most gorgeous, most hard-working, most dedicated and most hilarious) man in the whole world.
"Can't really trust the memory of someone who just suffered a concussion," Draco muttered, biting off a big piece from his tart. "I just Levitated you. Almost gave me a fucking heart attack."
"You know," Theodore started when they left the Potions classroom and were ascending the stairs for Defence against the Dark Arts with the new, creepy professor. Slytherins liked anything creepy, if they were going to be honest, but how Mad Eye Moody had enjoyed casting the Unforgivables on that spider the other day was just downright unsettling.
"The first is a locket," Harry explained, as he pushed a branch away from his face. Leaves crunched under his boot, starkly loud in contrast with the silence of the Forest of Dean. Behind him, more crunching sounds followed, and he craned his head to check on his companion, almost expecting a pointy nose scrunched up in disgust at all the moss and wet leaves.
“Six years too long,” Dumbledore had said sadly. Snape didn’t bother asking anymore. The last time he tried, he only got a multitude of riddles for his effort.
There were days when Draco would let himself believe that he could get used to this, that he could allow himself to. He wanted to believe that Harry would do, that they'd keep doing this even after they've graduated and maybe more – but he would crush that thought quickly because it wouldn't do good to dwell on petty wishes and dreams.
Then, as if realizing what he had just done, Potter quickly let go of him and flushed red. He mumbled an apology, before coughing. "Err – I've been sneaking in Severus' room at night with the Invisibility Cloak. He leaves the Daily Prophet on his desk. I think he Apparates somewhere before breakfast every morning to get it."
Draco follows his gaze, towards the table with two sets of breakfast: French toast, runny eggs, slices of fruit, and a cup of coffee. He sighs. “Well, sit down, Potter. There’s nothing much I can object to when even my house elf’s making you breakfast.”
Underneath the window and the sunlight that made his hair shine gold, Draco stared dumbly at the wood of the table and slowly fell apart.
Draco sighed. The meeting had just started and his head was already starting to hurt. Stupid Potter. Stupid Potter not telling his merry band of friends. Stupid Potter expecting
When he arrived at the Hospital Wing, Draco was there, alright, even though Harry could only see his white-blond hair. Madame Pomfrey was standing beside Draco's bed, her back turned to Harry who realized that the Mediwitch's shoulders were actually… shaking.
in front of the other students. Severus never reprimanded him for those but Harry still felt guilty.
Then, Harry turned but Draco still couldn't see his face because he had his head ducked down. His body remained stiff and Draco could see Harry's hands still shaking because Draco notices stuff like that, especially about Harry, who was walking towards him now and Draco actually held his breath in – fear? Nervousness?
Remus was surprised that the object the boy had hid was merely a pencil. The surprise didn’t last long, however, when he thought of how the boy must have been longing for remnants of the Muggle world.
Draco blinked, taken aback with the earnest compliment. His cheeks flushed and he turned his head to the side. "Of course I am, Potter, have you learned nothing about me for the past four years?"
. “—should be easily compensated for. Muggles compensate for trifle disabilities all the time, do they not?”
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry's jaw-dropped expression and merely nodded his greeting quietly, before ignoring him completely and turning to the arduous task of swallowing a glass of medicinal potion that probably included all sorts of animal tongues.
And as he turns around and walks through the doors—because if he is going to hell, he certainly isn’t going to be
He pretended to be preoccupied with his chiffon cake, but out of the corner of his eye, he could see the way Potter’s shoulders were slowly stiffening and at the way he was trying very hard not to look away from his treacle tart.
Potter persisted. “Kingsley said it himself. If you requested for it, he’ll allow it. No questions asked.”
“That’s…” Potter settled back down on his chair with a sigh of relief, before his eyebrows furrowed together with worry still. “That’s good.”
Two weeks later, Draco was back in Hogwarts, in the Headmistress’ Office, and while he was in high spirits, Potter beside him was decidedly not.
Even Potter understood the ridiculousness of what he was saying based on how he was now shifting in his seat. “In exchange for a shortened sentence.”
"Hullo, Harry," Ginny greeted him innocently as she sat down on the couch beside him in the Gryffindor Common Room.
“Oh, don’t play that card with me,” he snapped irritably. He wasn’t in the mood to comfort misplaced self-deprecation. “We both know who’s at fault here.”
He doesn’t really know how he gets there, his vision’s blurred and Harry belatedly realizes that they’re tears. There’s something really painful in his chest, like something clamping on his heart, and all he can think of is
Draco glared. "What should I be mad about? The blood thing? That's hardly within your control, and –" He paused, raising an eyebrow at him. He looked at Potter up and down. Potter had lost weight. "Considering the two times it happened, you seem to be more bothered by it than I am."
Harry thought. He blinked some more, not really expecting that but thinking that he probably should have. He did have Malfoy's wand, in his trunk in Gryffindor Tower. He had thought of returning it, but either forgot about it or lost his nerve whenever he'd try to. Besides, Draco already had a new wand, but Harry reckoned it didn't work as good as his old one.
So with his heart beating nervously in his chest, he rounded the corner and headed straight for the Hospital Wing.
Draco pried Harry's lips apart gently with his own, experimentally sliding his tongue across Harry's bottom lip.
Only this time they were older and the world was a dark place and Lily was dead and he was here to pick up her son.
away) today, Harry immediately brightened up and he showed her the scroll of parchment he was holding in his hand with a goofy grin.
He quite liked the feel of Draco's pulse underneath his fingers though. And how Draco's eyes, bright, widened almost imperceptibly as he stared at the messy handwriting on his pale skin.
After half an hour, he sat in the infirmary with Madame Pomfrey tending to his bloodied fist littered with splinters.
"No," was Ron's unapologetic reply. He peered nervously at Harry. "You're not mad at Ginny or anything, are you?"
Harry was wearing royal green robes, its sleeves and openings lined with silver. Each of his hand was covered by thick, brown gloves, and one of them held the Nimbus 2001. A team of Beauxbaton sixth years had been in charge of their uniforms, and they weaved each one especially for each Champion. For Harry's part, he looked like he was part of the Slytherin Quidditch Team.
Harry remembered, of course. He remembered that particular night—Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle chasing them until Crabbe let loose a spell that he couldn’t control. He remembered flames licking up the walls, engulfing all of the hidden things, and threatening to engulf them, too. He remembered Malfoy’s young face, panicked and afraid and begging for help.
“Good. Now, I don’t want you near that boy again, do you hear me? Merlin knows you might have gotten his
Really. Didn’t Potter understand this by now, after all their eventful years together? Draco noticed
He glances at Ron beside him, who just shrugs before returning to his breakfast, and then at Hermione across from him, who smiles at Astoria in greeting, before turning to Harry and nudging her chin towards the door. “Go on, then. We’ll save you a seat in Professor Slughorn’s class.”
He had done some exploring of the house, but most of it were just old, dusty rooms with cobwebs and spiders.
Harry did. Ever since that night in the Astronomy Tower, and that time in Malfoy Manor when Draco had been asked to identify them and didn't. Harry trusted him.
Beside him, Theodore was practically livid. "What! I've spent the past four years trying to convince you to join the Quidditch Team and it takes Draco only four seconds?! You and I are going to have a long talk about this, Potter –"
They’re old recipes, hailing from his Aunt Petunia, with advice from Molly, and tweaked to his own taste. He doesn’t cook that much anymore, but it’s an old skill from childhood and one that you don’t really forget. Also, it reminds him of his days in Privet Drive, memories that he really doesn’t care to recall, but he’s getting better. After all, since his relationship with Draco began, he’s started to associate cooking with different memories.
There was no Time Turner to help him now, he had left the Time Turner in his chest in the Slytherin Dorms, vowing to never to use it again, and Harry thought that was
Almost as soon as she walked away, Draco lay back on his bed, pulled the covers up to his shoulders and turned on the bed so that his back was facing Harry.
Holding his breath, Draco taps the parchment with his wand and says, “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
The sound of Ron's head hitting the table was ignored by Binns and the rest of the class, who were already fast asleep.
, he was sure and Merlin's balls, why did everyone keep on asking that same stupid question about the stupid cup – and then Sirius' head added, "Because it's absolutely something that James and I would have done and would have roped Moony into doing back in our day."
Potter grins at him in reply. He taps the lower right corner, the Slytherin Dorms, right where their names are placed beside each other.
Harry thought as he swerved sharply to the left, almost hitting the wall as the broom responded late to his movements. Madame Hooch was flying beside him, muttering under her breath. Then, she suddenly swerved so close to him, almost dangerously so, and tapped her wand on his head. It hurt, really, since she had involuntarily used more force than what was necessary due to their shaky flying, but Harry could forgive her since she had just cast a Disillusionment Charm on him.
"Yeah, and you only agree to play Quidditch with me during the summer." Theodore's voice held a bit of an accusatory tone in it, as if he still wasn't over the fact the Draco Malfoy got Harry to agree to join the Quidditch Team after years of his efforts in doing the same thing.
“No –“ He found himself croaking out on impulse. “Absolutely not.” Inwardly, he cursed himself. He should have explained this better. “I have to… work for a while. But I can’t take you with me. It’s too dangerous and I don’t want you to get hurt. So I asked the help of some…
If Draco thought about it, Potter was also pretty injured back in Little Hangleton, wasn't he? The last time Draco saw him, he had been tied to a gravestone with his arm dripping red with blood.
“It was probably either Sir Potter’s cat or Draco Malfoy,” Frank Hartsman supplied from his cubicle helpfully.
if it isn't Hogwarts' Champion!" reached his ears as soon as he entered the Slytherin common room. Sniggers resounded from around the room.
They didn’t talk about Draco’s mission with Ron because Draco didn’t bring it up and Harry didn’t want to bring it up, because he still smarted from the fact that Draco had easily accepted another partner other than him.
And then the man was making that shocked face again that quickly transformed into a scary one. The same thing happened last night when they first arrived in this place and Snape had shown him to his room.
A wistful smile slowly slides its way on Malfoy’s lips. "I did, didn't I?" And there is a distant look to his eyes, as if he is mulling over a thought that he has long since pondered. He sighs and fixes his robes, if only to avoid Harry's gaze.
Draco furrows his eyebrows at him, and then at the pancakes on the table. It takes a while for him to respond, but his eyes clear and he says, “Get your filthy fingers off my pancakes.”
Just as he moved to stand, the doors to the Hospital Wing opened. Severus walked in, a shadow in the dark of the Infirmary. Only the moon served as light that illuminated his pale skin and crooked nose.
“Hey!” Potter yelled indignantly. “We had an all-nighter, okay?” He grumbled, swishing his wand to collect all the messy pieces of parchment into a single pile on the desk. He sat down on the chair behind the desk, and waved his arm around the room. “You can sit wherever.”
He raised a hand cautiously and gently pried the child’s arms apart. With a certain sort of marvel and emotions that he thought had long since died within him, he placed his hand on top of the boy’s head.
And he knew that it was to keep sensitive information funneled around Potter, to make it easier to control the information that went out and to track if ever there would be anyone that even thought of leaking them.
Harry hugged him back, and that, Remus supposed, was probably what made Sirius start crying for real.
Dumbledore’s eyes turned downcast towards the wood of his desk. He sighed then, and Snape realized with a bit of a start that Dumbledore actually looked…
Draco's eyebrows rose to his hairline. "Do you mean to tell me that there is a stray cat in the Auror Department of the Ministry of Magic and that you, Head Auror and Saviour of the Wizarding World—"
Sirius was downstairs trying to get Kreacher started on dinner and chicken soup for Remus, which left the latter alone with Harry’s curious eyes that shone bright against the darkness with only the light of the moon from the window.
He wished he didn't sit with his back facing Draco though. His eyes still burned with that image of Draco sitting under the window and the sunlight, looking relaxed for the first time in weeks.
Potter sighed heavily. “Nott is currently in Ministry custody. He was arrested just last night in England. We’re thinking if he’ll be willing to do what you’re doing for a lighter sentence.”
The look of amazement was gone, replaced by a flat look. “Not when their boss gives them a rare week off. Some wizards go to the pub.”
The grin that was about to worm up to his lips was cut short when the hat was taken away from his eyes and he saw the disturbed expressions of the crowd of unsorted first years. He didn’t even need to look around the room to know that others wore the same expressions because he could hear them, the words they said –
Maybe he'd have time to figure it out, if Potter would stop being such a wuss and face him. Maybe Draco really would feel better after a hex or two. He wouldn't do anything that would seriously
Harry didn’t know what he looked like now—he was barely holding himself together—but whatever Malfoy saw in his face made his grip on Harry’s collar loosen.
Draco had just Scourgified his clothes and his bed, unable to stand the grit and the dirt anymore, when Potter asked if he knew that it was the Forbidden Forest he was walking to, which evolved into the conversation they are having now.
What Snape saw clearly, however, was the array of emotions that crossed Black’s face when his eyes landed on the boy. He didn’t even make notice of Snape. Black’s face transformed from disbelief, to despair, and to relief in a matter of a second and he had immediately dashed forward, on his knees, to hold the boy to his chest and sob.
Draco's stare turned incredulous. "I just took out my wand, Potter. I might as well be ready to hex you!"
. Hermione’s taken to spending long hours in the library just to be able to study in peace, with a grumble of
He grits his teeth and walks away, before he can do anything else that he might regret later. “I don’t even know why I keep trying. I’m done, Malfoy. I hope you’re happy.”
Astoria relaxes, knowing that she doesn’t have to introduce herself after all. “Yes.” She glances at Harry’s already empty plate. “If it’s alright, can I talk with you?”
Potter’s smile gets bigger, and Draco curses his heart for feeling whatever it is that it’s feeling. Must be the nausea.
“It kept me from giving in to the terror that the Dementors wanted me to feel. But the more I did it, the easier it got, and the harder it was to come back.”
As he held on to Severus' robes, he looked at his parents' faces. His father's face was as stoic as Draco expected it to be. His mother's was stiff. Draco could see she was still uncomfortable with this situation.
Snape pinched his nose and bit his tongue to keep himself from saying anything that might sound like he was insulting Harry’s artistic prowess.
worried about his grades since he still couldn't speak and he didn't want to worry her any more than she already was.
Harry glared at him. And not at the way Pansy had her arm hooked around Draco's. They had started to get physically close ever since fourth year started, and Harry knew that everyone had noticed but was just politely letting it run its course. Even Blaise sometimes had started to hang out Theodore and him more frequently nowadays.
“You boys,” she sighed, shaking her head. “All these years. Both of you shouldn’t be doing this anymore.” She took a deep breath to compose herself. “Nevertheless, I…
Snape, who had probably been expecting him, didn't even pause in his work of checking papers and marking them all with Dreadfuls. "I'll give you until 8 o'clock sharp, Potter."
Draco almost started his 'what did I say about sparing me from your horrid handwriting?' speech when he realized that Harry wasn't taking out any parchment. Instead, Harry directed the sharp nub of his quill to the table and slowly carved out a word.
It was this that Draco pulled tighter around himself as he sat on the floor of the Hospital Wing. For the past few hours that he had sat there, no one had come and gone. No extra beds magically appeared. No hidden doors opened.
Severus' jaw clenched. He looked like he still wanted to argue. Draco could actually see in his expression and in the lowering of his shoulders the moment he started to back down. "He wouldn't want it… forcibly taken."
He’s still lying vertically on the bed, turned to his side, watching the ribbons of names glide over the Map. Potter didn’t go back to the other bed anymore and had settled for lying down horizontally, just below the pillows. His thigh is just above Draco’s head.
Faint knocking from the window caught his attention and he cracked open an eye to peer at the source of the noise. The cat was tapping its paw on the glass.
“I’m not really ‘keeping it’,” Harry said, shrugging. “It comes and goes. It doesn’t even sleep or eat here. It just lounges on my couch a lot.”
“Livid… you say,” Draco commented with amusement. He could already imagine what’s gotten Saint Potter’s knickers in a twisted bunch.
Draco raised an even pointier eyebrow back. “It really was just that. It felt like Crucio, the one that Voldemort used to do on us to make the Marks hurt.”
He’s tired trying to avoid the press, trying to avoid the Ministry, trying to avoid the Burrow and the Weasleys’ insistence that he’s family now, even though he’s not, not really, and he feels like an intruder to their grief when they see him and have to pretend that they’re not mourning a son, a brother.
She was the only girl, but the rest of the team had long since accepted that she was the Man in the group.
He doesn’t think his help will be welcome, but it’s better than watching Draco struggle like this, and Harry looks up, but the words die on his lips when he sees Draco’s gaze is vacant again. He’s not moving anymore.
What replaced his thunderous expression was a look of worry, as he surveyed Draco up and down, looking for any signs of damage.
Immediately, Harry opened his mouth to say (or at least try to say) something stupid like sorry and the like so Draco saved him from further humiliation by quickly raising a hand up. Harry obediently shut his mouth, looking remorseful and just very put-out.
Draco shook his head, frustrated at himself. He hadn't gotten a wink of sleep last night, kept awake by thoughts of a madman in his home and a snake slithering in his room. His home. His family's home.
He raised his head sharply to glare at the other boy, but stopped short when he was greeted by Harry's dazzling smile. What he did to deserve that smile, he may never know, but it never stopped him from wondering.
Harry actually had the urge to recoil from the room, especially when the Slytherins finally saw him and erupted in joyful yells and whistles.
He hurried after them, sticking as close as he dared so as not to be stopped by the tapestry when it fell down again to close the entryway.
"Oh, don't think like that, Harry," Ginny said nonchalantly, waving whatever thoughts that Harry was presumably having with a scoff. "I'm trying to help here."
“That’s a pretty name,” Draco said politely. “There! That’s a white lily. Your mother must have been beautiful just like it.”
!” chorused two female voices scoldingly. Hermione and Ginny, Harry’s befuddled mind helpfully supplied.
Draco still remembered Dumbledore’s face that night in the Astronomy Tower. He remembered Dumbledore’s words very clearly… as clear as his Aunt Bellatrix’s:
Severus bellowed, and this was it. This was one of the moments that Draco knew that Severus was really angry. No, not just angry. He was
Draco leaned down to plant a kiss on Harry’s forehead. “Articulate, Harry,” he said teasingly, finally standing up from the sofa.
"For now, just sit there and shut up. I like you better when you can't defend yourself from my clever wit."
Potter winced and looked up, anywhere but Draco's eyes. "Well," he mumbled. "For starters, I sucked your blood."
He decided against it though because he still wanted to indulge in his 'immature musings' and ire towards one Draco Malfoy a bit more.
“You’ve been barging in here for the past two weeks, or so my mother tells me. Don’t let something as trivial as the lack of my permission stop you now.”
“If you don’t want it, it’s fine. I’ve got another gift for you but I have to place it under the tree first –“ Harry rushed out, but stopped when Draco flicked his forehead with a finger. “Ow!”
Draco turns to him, glaring, but he still looks pale and tired and despite what a git Draco’s being, Harry can’t help but be worried.
Ron sighed once more, this time exasperatedly and with a roll of his eyes. “Temporarily incapacitated and possessing the attention span of a baby Kneazle, but he’ll live.”
He was grateful that he had studied and practiced the Riddikulus Spell on his own before the Third Task. He was grateful that it worked. He didn't want to ask for help from Severus or Remus, because he was already sure what form the Boggart would take.
“I left my inkwell,” Draco sighed irritably and started to walk towards the library – towards Harry. He called over his shoulder. “Wait for me, Pans.”
Draco had started on a new book titled Potions, Jinxes and Hexes: Laws of Attraction. It was definitely not about love magic. He had been sitting there for the past half hour already and hadn't quite gotten past the third sentence of the first page yet, but he kept his eyes firmly on the paper and not on the shelves where Harry usually appeared from with a shy grin and a tray of breakfast.
Draco shook his head. “No,” he sighed dramatically. “Mother and Father just scold me for getting my clothes dirty and then magic away my injuries.” He scoffed, jutting his lower lip out in a pout.
"The floor looks infested," he found himself saying instead. No wonder his mother never brought him here.
Harry frowned, eyes glancing over Draco as well despite his efforts not to be obvious, because someone
“That’s what Granger is for with that big head of hers. She is the most brilliant Witch the Wizarding World has ever known and will probably ever know in this century,
like it was sixth year all over again but worse, because back then, Draco had something to fight for.
Draco pursed his lips in confusion, as if he was perplexed that Harry didn’t want to drink his blood. “But aren’t vampires supposed to drink blood?”
He had a point. A very good and practical point. Still, it churned Harry’s stomach at the thought of Malfoy having concern over him. He pushed that thought to the side. “But what about you? What if you—”
He guessed that Potter's room might be upstairs. As for the loud thumps, Severus only had one word for them: "Mutts."
Without looking at Draco, Harry turned away and walked out of the Hospital Wing, shameful and at the same time burning with rage.
He sounded desperate and Harry had to close his eyes to push down the anger that was bubbling inside of him towards the wizarding world for being so close-minded, towards Lucius Malfoy for being a selfish bastard and towards Voldemort for fucking everything up.
He manages to get himself off the floor and towards the fireplace in the master room, taking the liberty to Floo himself back to Grimmauld Place.
Draco sighs, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. “And besides, why would you even want to be friends with me?”
Draco continued on obliviously. "You can also use a Bubblehead Charm, but that's less efficient. Gillyweed will let you breathe underwater for an hour, swim like a fish, and even enhance your vision so you'll be able to navigate the Lake faster."
He couldn’t imagine a younger Potter diving into cold, dark caverns and doing things that no child should ever have to do.
Potter is leaning back on his arms, keeping his feet and his own dirty boots firmly planted on the floor.
"Harry's body is rejecting everything. If it goes on for a long enough time, his body starts to reject
“Then you know what it feels like. And to go through it again and again, every day, for three months.”
Harry, who was sitting on the armchair beside the couch, wisely kept mum about his cat (who was nowhere to be found right now, which wasn’t a surprise because the cat never stayed the night in his flat anyway) making a mess of Draco’s desk. He also wisely ignored the bit of skin that was exposed by the loosening of Draco’s tie.
The hooded figure continued, its voice trembling even more this time, as he procured a knife from his pocket.
that kept giving Harry those nightmares. And it was also banking on the theory that to nullify the dormant magic, one needed to use Voldemort’s own active magic, which they also theorized still lived on through his Dark Marks.
"No," Draco replied easily. He was seated on one of the plush couches in front of the fireplace with the fourth years, as well as some other students from the higher years who were looking at their exchange with interest. "You never did know what to do with fame and power. You never would have thought of that brilliant scheme to get attention."
Dumbledore hadn’t been surprised at his sudden arrival or at the manner that he decided to do it. He remained sitting behind his desk, pushed his glasses higher on the bridge of his nose, and sighed morosely. “I had thought…”
of August, the day before the start of classes in Hogwarts, Severus Snape stood in front of his fireplace with a fidgeting Harry Potter beside him. The boy still didn’t know how to wear robes properly.
There was something heavy in his chest, something that he wasn’t sure was a figment of his imagination and his increasingly frequent nightmares. He wanted to believe that it was just something he had made up in his paranoia and countless nights awake.
At some point in the past minute, Malfoy had caught up to him and had clamped a hand around his arm. Harry shifted his gaze from the clearing, from the ratty tent that wasn’t there anymore, and instead forced himself to focus on Malfoy’s piercing, gray eyes.
When Malfoy found out, he had fallen back on the snow, face deathly white and eyes wide with horrified disbelief. He had said, “I won’t do it.”
For the past six years, Sirius had plenty of time to imagine what life with the Muggles was like for his godson. He had imagined… no, he had
When Draco came back to himself, he turned his head to look at Severus, and he realized that Severus had been looking at him this whole time. Warily.
The closed curtains were not a surprise. If these Muggles were half as intelligent as Snape thought them to be, then they would have already figured out that sunlight was bad for Harry Potter.
And it’s when Potter comes in, stumbles on him sitting on his bed with a mess of opened letters scattered around him and cradling his wrist that he remembers what Potter had said:
Remus smiled to himself at the scene the two were making. The house was going to be a lot quieter now without Harry around. Of course Sirius would still make it a point to blow things up around Grimmauld and make a racket, just to spite his mother’s portrait, but it was still different having a child’s laughter ring around the halls.
Seven horcruxes. Each one had been a vessel of a corrupted power, created by way of murder, an essence desperately clinging to immortality by feeding on the souls of others…
Ron sighed and decided to do his mate a favour and tell him what happened during his mission with Draco. “Remember that mission that he and I were paired off to?”
It would have been around this same hour. Almost dusk. The sky dark and gray. Death Eaters surrounding him, all in black. Voldemort, with his disfigured face and sneer, the tip of his wand, and the gleeful voice that shouted
It had been a Christmas gift from Sirius and Remus during his first year, with a note from Remus about how it had been his father's and explicit instructions from Sirius to
But it was all droned out as the other Slytherins pulled him further inside the room with the intent of involving him in the party.
Harry's shoulders slumped dejectedly. He voiced out what he had been so vehemently hoping against since last night. "So there's really no backing out from this Tournament?"
There’s another howl that sounds and echoes around him, and he doesn’t know where he’s going. He thinks he’s walking, he’s not sure, but it’s dark here, and Potter’s not around.
and his father falling in front of him, dead and lifeless. Sometimes, he would see the Dark Mark on his arm.
Malfoy’s screams got louder and more frantic when Harry touched him, but Harry held on tighter, closing his eyes because his vision was still useless anyway, until he could hook both arms and legs around Malfoy, shoving Malfoy’s head to his chest with one hand and shoving the other hand down his pocket to curl around the spoon.
Draco didn't know what possessed him to write such a thing on Harry's Self-Erasing Parchment that was laid carelessly on top of their table (just in case Harry needed to write something urgent).
Harry was beside him in an instant, moving him out of the rock’s way so that he was on his bum.Harry kneeled in front of him and his panicked eyes stared straight into Draco’s. “Merlin, Draco, are you okay? Uhm, I need to call Severus,
Moments later, as they all stood to leave, Black – who had wiped his face clean of snot and tears – nodded awkwardly at Snape. “Thank you,” he said gruffly.
Draco was already starting to doubt that they were hiding Potter in here somewhere. He was hungry. And sleepy. And he couldn't feel his legs anymore. What a sorry state for a Malfoy to be in. Maybe he should go back to his dorm…
Sitting next to Draco in his usual seat again, Harry took away the Invisibility Cloak and reveled in Draco's wide-eyed, slack jawed expression. When Draco turned that expression to him, Harry could only shrug self-consciously.
Draco scrambled to his feet, gathering the Invisibility Cloak in his arms. He spoke, nervous and eyes wide, "I just… I just wanted to see Potter…"
Draco sighed heavily, burying his face against his knees. He was ashamed to talk to Potter. If he closed his eyes, he could almost hear the sickening sound as the bludger made contact with bone…
Harry realized this belatedly, because it was sickeningly quiet and no one was helping him stand up and his ankle
He put his pudding down, leaned in and pressed his lips against Harry's for the umpteenth time in two days. Harry immediately pressed back, parting his lips slightly as an indication of what he wanted.
Harry barely survived that meeting and had come out of it with his glasses broken and his manly pride shredded to pieces.
Harry felt warmth spread across his cheeks. “Whaddya mean finally,” he muttered, shoving Draco’s shoulder slightly, playfully.
Ron also frowned, but only because of the sudden downturn of his friend's mood. He grabbed the parchment from him and tried again.
Perplexed at the sudden change in Myrtle’s tone, Harry whipped his head to look back at him in disbelief.
The Manor is beautiful in the morning, with its pristine white walls and marble floors. Sunlight filters through the halls and the air is fresh and crisp. Harry definitely believes that there is some magic in the works here
For the past two nights, his sleep had been wrecked with nightmares of graveyards and snakes, sucking all his blood until all that was left of him was a dry husk made of skin and bones. Sometimes the snake transformed into Potter. Most of the time it transformed into the Dark Lord.
Draco coughed loudly. “This talk about me is interesting and all, but can we please talk about something else?”
“Is food the only thing occupying your head?” Draco says exasperatedly. He waves towards the table, where two plates have appeared during their frolic in the garden. On each plate lay a generous slice of pie. “Blueberry pie.”
Draco makes a face. “I absolutely can’t imagine myself in Gryffindor,” he says, but he’s raising his arms, letting Harry slip the sleeves onto them.
Harry missed talking. Really. There were times when he'd get frustrated again, but memories of the splinters imbedding themselves in his skin always stopped him whenever he'd feel the urge to punch something.
Harry felt his fingertips go cold. He vaguely heard Draco growl but it was getting harder to concentrate on the words with the loud sound of his blood rushing in his ears.
And then Draco was laughing, laughing so hard that he started clutching at his stomach and bending over sideways to avoid his knees. He could feel tears forming behind his eyes, which was worsened when he chanced a look at Harry and saw that the boy had a gobsmacked expression on his face and was red to the ears.
Harry’s face scrunched up in confusion because he had no idea what Seamus had just said, and Seamus howled in pain because the cat had suddenly embedded its claws through his pants and his thigh.
Harry probably wasn’t trying very hard to get away because Draco caught up to him in no time even with his skinned knees.
The next day, Hermione pulled him aside just after leaving the Great Hall for breakfast with a hand on her hip and a stern look.
It’s a command, not a request, and Harry stands up eagerly. If he’s being honest with himself, he just likes the thought of them trying on each other’s clothes. He shrugs off his own robes, and puts on the offered one slowly.
And Draco had expected it to feel like tattling, or like giving up, but when he says it, he finds that he’s just really, really relieved to finally be able to share anything with this man.
Harry nods, shame making his cheeks burn at how he just simply turned tail and ran from the Manor. “Thanks, Ron.”
For a moment, Harry was filled with a sense of longing and maybe even anger because the old Draco would have insulted him on the spot without a second thought. He didn't know if he was angry at Draco or at the world in general for having made him that way. Draco wouldn't have… just sat there, looking sullenly at the empty glass.
He watched as Ronald Weasley’s expression transformed from shock, distress, and then to a fearful resignation.
Draco brushed it off, long used to Severus' expressions that usually scared all children away. Not Draco. He'd been with Severus long enough to know when he was
He returned back to reality with a slam at the touch of Malfoy’s hand curling abruptly around his arm.
Then, Draco laughed lowly. It was a hollow laugh, one that made Harry cringe and vow to never hear again. "Right," Draco said, swallowing with difficulty. He closed his eyes, and then opened them again. "Right, you don't think I can. After all, what can I do against Harry Potter?" he muttered, but there was no bite, just… resignation.
"I suppose it's not Finch-Fletchley," Draco mused thoughtfully, as if oblivious to Harry's internal turmoil.
The ink disappears in a heartbeat and the paper folds itself once more. Potter pockets it together with his wand.  He crosses the room to get the Invisibility Cloak on Goyle’s bed, and then pauses. He turns to look at Draco. His eyebrows are creased with worry. “You okay, Malfoy?”
Whenever he’d leave for work, he’d leave the window open just slightly so that the cat could wiggle in and out as it pleased.
Draco doesn’t stop, of course. He enters the bridge that leads to the Stone Circle, not once looking back.
Ginny merely looked at it before smiling at him charmingly. "I haven't seen Malfoy in the Great Hall either."
to discover a photograph of him in Harry's bedroom, even if it was hidden under a pile of knick-knacks. When he first devised The Plan, he had no expectations, really. All he had was the intelligent guess and the hope (a
"We can gel it back, just like Draco's here. What do you think, Draco?" Pansy grinned, looking towards the blond.
Harry’s heart fell. “I got it,” he said, sighing heavily. He raised a hand to rub at his temples, feeling like he had just swallowed a lump of lead.
And then the ground underneath Harry cracked, and Harry watched, terrified, as a sliver of white dust rose from the crack and into the cauldron. The liquid in the cauldron sizzled.
"You're still here. That means you're still in hiding from Brown and her little posse of delusional teenage girls," Draco said, shrugging. He raised his own eyebrow. "You still haven't gotten that Jinx off you."
, Harry thought, inhaling deeply and releasing it on a slow exhale to force his nerves to calm down.
And Harry would apologize for what happened next, really he would, because Madame Pomfrey had finally stepped aside and Harry could finally look at Draco and see the angry, red welt marking a path on the pale skin of the side of his neck, from his jaw to hide under the collar of his cloak and if Harry closed his eyes, he could imagine what it looked like before Madame Pomfrey did her fancy wand-waving, bleeding and open and red –
Harry rushed to the Potions classroom after dinner the next day. "Professor, can I borrow your bath tonight?"
Nightfall had him staring up at the roof of his bed, head swirling with mixed emotions. First of all, he was desperately trying not to succumb to the fear that felt like it wanted to crawl out of his heart and all over his body.
"Why wouldn't you ask for it?" Draco mumbled awkwardly. His anger had dissipated the moment Potter showed him that expression. To be honest, Draco was pretty sure it really wasn't Potter he was angry at.
is too formal, too reminiscent of their old relationship, especially in this house. “And no. You don’t have to apologize for that.”
The door opened, the yellow lamp light from inside filtering through the gap. Madame Pomfrey was still in her uniform, even though it must have been past midnight already.
Harry thought of a life without them, without Severus, and wondered if he’d be allowed to go to Hogwarts at all if Severus hadn’t taken him from the Dursleys. Would he have learned of this magical world? Would he have met Draco?
to stop the smile from worming up his face. They were on a mission to destroy the remnants of Voldemort’s magic. Malfoy was about to be horribly subjected to a Crucio-like curse in a few minutes. Focus on the mission, not on Malfoy’s wit.
The next time he woke up, it was to sticky sheets and the realization that he really did miss Malfoy's sneer. The bed next to his was empty and so was the rest of the Hospital Wing. With a burning face, he quickly Scourgified himself and the bed, and convinced himself that Madame Pomfrey wasn't going to send an army of Inferi towards him if he went out of the infirmary now.
They had walked back to the castle, Malfoy walking in front of him the whole time, but each step they took tightened Malfoy’s shoulders more and more. Harry, for his part, felt numb and didn’t have the words to… To do what? Comfort him? Assure him? Apologize to him?
Harry immediately looked away. It made him feel funny. He swallowed and opened the seventh cupboard. "Well, have you snogged her yet?"
And then Potter looks up, catches his eye, and then sends him the most dazzling smile, and Draco thinks, with his heart dropping to his stomach and his fist crumpling the note,
“Yeah. I might take a walk in the garden today,” Draco says, smiling slightly as he turns to look at the budding flowers.
He has a headache, but he forces himself out of bed anyway. He thinks he looks awful, his face feels sticky, but there’s no point hiding it. Not from Ron, anyway.
Harry usually avoided starting conversations with Draco, but he also usually avoided being alone with Draco, so this was… Well, this was uncomfortable.
At around that time, Malfoy would have been in the Manor, living day and night with a murderous madman just down the hall, fearing for his life, fearing for the lives of his parents. Harry wanted to ask.
Potter gave him a dry look. "Well, vampire and apparent Dark Wizard here. What have you got to offer?"
Severus continued to eat his breakfast without looking up. "It's been resolved by your father. And the Ministry right now will not bother with such a small infraction. They're currently… busy with other things."
He glanced at the crowd again, this time searching for another familiar person to seek comfort in. Instead of searching for Severus' all-black ensemble, now he was searching for something brighter. White blond.
For a while, Draco remained silent, frowning at the Parchment. Harry almost thought that he was mad at him or something. Finally, Draco looked away, and returned to his book. "Whatever, Potter," he muttered stiffly, but his ears were pink and Harry was smiling.
"Severus said you didn't eat dinner," Potter said, sitting himself comfortably on the foot of Draco's bed. He held out the tart.
“No—“ Harry is quick to cut her off, disturbed to even hear those words from her. “No. I – I wouldn’t be here. If I didn’t want to.”
The sky is blue, the air is refreshingly cold, and in the middle of it all is soft, blonde hair swaying with the wind.
It was uncomfortable, at first. He isn’t used to talking about himself. But Draco’s a good listener, all eyes and ears, nodding at the right times, and asking questions, but never too much. He doesn’t pry, but Harry tells him anyway, because he likes the way Draco looks when he’s really curious and invested.
At that, Severus' face immediately transformed into a dark scowl. "Yes, and I've already rightfully threatened Albus with bodily harm for that."
Draco grinned at him unrepentantly, effectively sending the butterflies in Harry’s stomach into flight.
was the one who was supposed to pout petulantly. He closed the door and plopped down beside Draco. “Have you been crying?”
They've talked about this before, Harry was sure, but he just couldn't remember because the way Draco ate pudding was so distracting…
, if he really did read those words. It could have been just a dream, or – or his imagination, or something.
Harry knew that he wasn't going to get any answers from Severus. The man, despite being a Slytherin, was still a very strict professor and never once showed any favouritism towards Harry in all his years as his student. Snape wouldn't give him anything that would give him an unfair advantage in the Tournament.
And Harry kind of wished that he chose something else to say, because it really was awkward talking about his bits with the person he'd been pathetically pining after for years.
"My – my wand," he muttered, yanking his wrist from Harry's grip. He then took his wand and shoved it in Harry's palm. "Take it. I might… I can't – You keep it. I can't."
At Harry's confused expression, Draco went on but kept his eyes firmly on the book as if the conversation bored him. "The other thing, to take the Jinx off."
Harry knew that whatever insults that Ron and Draco still sent each other were mainly due to traditional obligation than any sort of real animosity, so he didn’t reprimand Draco for that. Instead, he accused Draco of another deed. “You went through my alcohol stash!”
Potter leads them out of the Common Room, out of the dungeons, and out of the castle into the Transfiguration Courtyard. The sun is peeking out from the horizon, painting the sky and Potter’s glasses.
Draco sighed, accepting that he wasn't going to get any information out of Potter after all. "Aren't you
Harry sits up straight, startled at what she’s insinuating. The defence is immediately on his lips. “I don’t… I don’t mean any harm,” he says, hurt.
Harry smiled slightly to himself at how red Draco’s eye was. He didn’t like the idea of Draco crying but the thought that the other boy had cried
This both surprised and not surprised Harry, because Draco did spend most of his time nowadays in the library but he was so rattled earlier, that Harry wondered why he didn't retreat to the dungeons. Harry was glad he didn't though – made it so much easier to get to him.
Draco knew. Even before they went to Gloucestershire, he knew that he could quit and Kingsley wouldn’t bat an eyelash. But could he himself live with that?
“You weren’t at dinner,” Potter says, continuing their conversation. “I checked the Map and didn’t see you anywhere.”
With the help of the Invisibility Cloak and Hover Charms, Harry managed to get the tray to the library with no problems. The library was empty, even Madame Pince was at the Great Hall eating her dinner, but Harry knew that there was at least one occupant that he would find seating at the very back of the room.
Maybe it was the fame from the Triwizard Tournament getting to his head and giving him an unnecessary confidence that Harry forgot himself enough to say, carefree and earnest and with a laugh, "Merlin, I missed your whining."
Briefly, Harry contemplates quitting his position and living a secluded life with his lover in peace and gluttony. He thinks Draco would approve of that. But, he chuckles to himself, he thinks that he would probably go crazy with nothing else to do.
"Nothing!" Draco answered quickly, pressing the Cloak closer to his body, as if it might protect him from Severus' wrath. Draco hadn't seen Severus that mad since the Weasley twins charmed his hair into pink two years ago. The Weasley twins weren't seen around Hogwarts for a week.
Still, when he saw Draco already sitting at the same place he sat in that morning, he couldn't stop himself from feeling lighter.
He swallowed down his fear. He trusted Severus. He trusted that they were all against the Dark Lord now, and they were going somewhere safe.
That's what his whole life had been about, right? His father had told him countless of times that he was foolish for still wanting to befriend Harry Potter after the boy had refused his hand during first year, so Draco stopped mentioning it. His aunt Bellatrix would pull him aside, press her nails against his forearm, and whisper to him to forget all about Hogwarts and his friends and just be a
"So Harry," Ginny said smoothly, after she had pretty much ambushed Harry as soon as he had stepped out of his last class. She had dragged Harry away from an incredulous Ron and Hermione for a walk to the Paved Courtyard, taking advantage of his inability to voice out his protests. "Anything new?"
Malfoy’s lips curled up into a dry smile. “I know, Potter. That’s why Kingsley gave us a Portkey to St. Mungo’s, right?”
After the war, Harry had a lot of time to think about whether the younger Draco actually had any idea of his father’s schemes for power. Now, he had his answer.
But even after four years, he could still remember how it felt when he last held Draco Malfoy’s hand.
Draco saw the exact moment that Potter realized his presence, because Potter had abruptly stopped in mid-air, almost falling off his broom, and looked like he'd just been caught doing something he wasn't supposed to.
Severus put his quill down with one last defeated sigh at the papers in front of him. He waved offhandedly at the teacup sitting at the edge of his desk, steam still rising from its contents. Harry reckoned Severus had put a Warming Charm on it.
wasn't going to be like other mornings because it was then that Harry's eyes turned to him and they were unusually brighter than normal and Draco realized that
," he rasped out, and it sounded painful to his ears. His throat hurt, after having not spoken in a long time, but Harry forced it to anyway because he needed to say this, needed to tell Draco.
It was Draco who had decided for Harry that he change his wards and, well, it was an embarrassing truth that he had never denied Draco Malfoy anything ever since he found out he fancied him.
the magic, rather than combatting it. It’s all in the beginning stages of research, but it’s worth looking into.”
Sirius rolled his eyes and threw an arm around Remus’ shoulder. “Come on, old man, you’re probably more tired than he is. Joints already creaking?”
Swallowing, Harry willed his feet to move. He awkwardly placed the books on the table beside Malfoy's and proceeded to flip through the pages, feeling very self-conscious.
“Mm-hmm,” said Draco distractedly as he took Harry’s offered wine and disappeared in the kitchen in his search for a wineglass. “You wouldn’t love me if I wasn’t.”
"In his room," Severus replied easily, already having expected the question. "He ate lunch ahead of us."
Harry rubbed his own jar with an apologetic smile. "Yes, Draco, you've told me that ten times already for the past half hour we've been doing this." He put his already clean jar on the shelf, resolutely not thinking about what was inside. It looked very disturbingly like tongues, but ignorance is bliss, as Sirius always said.
Another disturbing incident occurred half an hour later. He was getting the boy to count with his fingers when Potter mistakenly uncurled seven fingers while saying ‘six’. Snape had reached out with the intention of uncurling another finger when Potter flinched, shut his eyes closed, and ducked his head.
A girl, tall and with brown hair falling down to her waist in soft curls, looks at him nervously. Around them, the people nearest are starting to whisper, watching with bated breath and wondering why a Slytherin would talk to Harry Potter.
“Talk to me again when I’ve sobered,” he muttered, and winced when the effort of talking sent a lance of pain through his head. “
“No, it’s fine,” Harry replies, and it is. “It’s alright. If you want to talk. I want to…” He pauses, surprised at the truth in his next words. “I want to listen.”
He relaxes, assured that Draco’s safe and that he’s coming back to Hogwarts after all. He knocks on the door, but that’s the only courtesy he’s willing to offer because he slides the door open immediately after anyway.
Draco raises an eyebrow at him. “I’m actually asking serious questions here. You’re the one being all defensive about it.”
And Harry thinks that she’s not just asking about the now, she’s asking about the yesterday, the tomorrow, and his every day. And he doesn’t know why he wants to be honest at this moment, maybe it’s because Narcissa has also already bared herself, that it seems… safe to bare himself, too. In the end, he allows himself a little bit of honesty.
At that, Harry flushed and nodded in greeting, managing a weak grin. Draco nodded back, and then simply returned to his book.
“Oh, for the love of –“ Harry huffed out angrily. He whipped out his wand, fully intending to cast a body bind or a levitation charm on the feline, when the cat found an object of interest and patted it with its paw.
she allows it," Severus added dryly. They all knew how protective Madame Pomfrey was with her patients.
But as far as Time After the Time Turner was concerned, Narcissa never said those haunting words. She never visited Snape Manor during that fateful summer, she never grabbed Draco's arm and forcibly pulled him towards the Floo, and never forbade him from being friends with Harry Potter.
Harry scrambled to his feet, panic and adrenaline making him charge through the chaos and seeking that one single voice, in that sea of screams, that one single voice that mattered—
“Well, I shall continue my search for the best drawn tart in Hogwarts,” Dumbledore said merrily. He winked at them both. “Perhaps Severus might care to join me.”
“He actually didn’t want to tell me anything at first. I was the one who insisted. It helps, you see. He likes talking about you.” Here, she smiles at him, but it looks sad.
“Invisibility Cloak,” Potter explains, as if that says everything about why he’s suddenly in Slytherin, in the middle of Draco’s room,
Its neatly brushed and short fur was a pure white with strawberry blond spots and its tail was rather long. Harry only noticed because when he opened the window to give the cat a scolding, the cat had jumped inside his living room and raised its nose and bum up in the air, as if haughtily reprimanding Harry for not letting it in sooner.
Draco's lip curled. "How chivalrous," he said, and then turned to his book, making it clear that he did not want to talk anymore.
He supposed his father decided not to tell her. His mother had always been very vocal about her hatred of vampires. She had actually stopped talking to Blaise's mother because of it, after she had dated one. She might actually file a criminal case in the Wizengamot if she knew that Harry Potter had bit her son. But why… Why would his father be protecting
“Magical reactions are usually two-way, as I’m sure you know,” he started. “I get hit with Crucio, and the location gets blown to bits.”
"Wonderful," Voldemort said, his thin, white, and bloodless lips smiling. He turned his back to Draco and addressed the others.
The skull stared straight at him, eyes dark and menacing. The hissing in Harry’s ears grew louder, more impatient, but the snake coming out of the mouth of the skull remained still.
Harry looked at Seamus in horror. “I’m not sure I’m comfortable with you guys talking about me in an apron,” he squeaked out.
Harry couldn't resist his eyelids fluttering closed or the sound of pure contentment that rose from him as Draco pressed their lips together for the second time. He hovered there, as if hesitant, but Harry pressed back eagerly and the moment's hesitation was gone.
The boy started at the question, blinking at Snape in surprise. Then, he looked at his hands and started uncurling them one by one, hesitating when he reached the sixth. He stopped after the seventh finger and showed them off to Snape. “Seven,” he said quietly.
“I wanted to. Here, catch.” He throws the chocolate frog and is not surprised when Draco catches it easily. He grins. “Ron told me to give it to you.”
If Hermione's not available – or, err, back in the Great Hall with a mob of crazed students, then one has to make do with the library.
Ron simply rolled his eyes exasperatedly. "Well, go on then. I'll go have a romantic dinner with my girlfriend, and you go have one with yours."
The train gave one big hoot and gave a sudden lurch forward. He realized, with a mix of excitement and trepidation, that the train was already moving.
Then he realized his mistake and slapped both of his hands on his mouth, wondering if he’ll get clocked for speaking out of turn.
Harry felt humbled, and ducked his head to hide the redness of his cheeks. He shrugged self-consciously.
He takes Harry’s silence as a yes. He sighs, stares at the floor. “Man, I still don’t like him, but. I can’t say I’m happy about what happened to him.”
Potter grins at him. “Trade secrets.” He nudges his chin towards the wall. “I’ll tell you when we get inside. Can you stand now?”
"Besides," Theodore continued. "If you die, you get to haunt Hogwarts forever like the Bloody Baron! Doesn't that sound like a lot of –"
Harry grinned, feeling warmth bloom in his chest and across his cheeks. He could actually imagine Draco throwing a tantrum with his friends and demanding things.
Harry could feel his bones and muscles screaming with fatigue, but most of all, he could feel his fractured leg – courtesy of the spider – begging for attention.
And Harry realizes that Draco remembers him, remembers a lot more about him, if he’s going to go back to old habits and his usual snark. He feels unbearably happy at that.
The fact that Harry had felt all fluttery and warmed at Draco’s snarling (because that really meant Draco had been worried for him, right?) disturbed him enough that he realized he really was sick.
"Mister Potter, how nice of you to join us," said Madame Pomfrey with amusement as she neared him with two glasses and a bottle of questionable liquid.
With one last nod, he took the parchment with him and left the library, feeling considerably lighter with his admission.
Before he yelled out his destination to the fireplace, he narrowed his eyes at the cat and scowled. “If Harry really does enter a ménage à trois with Dean and Seamus, I’m blaming
Draco smirked, raising the Snitch in his hand back between their faces. “Is this what you meant by the inscription?
Harry's head snapped up, surprised at the words and the man they came from. Severus didn't pause in his ministrations of decluttering his desk.
Harry's face burned a fiery red and he groaned. He did not want to look behind him and see Malfoy's expression. He looked out the window and gaped as the mob spread out all over the courtyard, screaming his name and other obscene pick-up lines.
As they neared the Quidditch Pitch, Harry could see the black form of something curled up on the grass… A black cat.
He had half a mind to Reducto the whole house. Set Fiendfyre on all of them. Crucio all the inhabitants until they cried and begged for mercy, the same way that this child –
Deep inside, Draco knew that he was obsessing over this only as a way to distract himself from the bigger problems. The Dark Lord was alive, and he and his father had almost been murdered. He had almost
“I’ll be peachy, don’t worry about me, Potter,” Malfoy said with a huff. “Just can’t help but feel like the universe’s getting a kick out of this. Putting us back in places that had us in each other’s throats.”
He had clutched his blanket to his chest, fervently trying to convince himself that his parents were safe and that his nightmare wasn't true.
They reached his room, the farthest one on the second floor, and he was at least relieved to see that the room had been spelled so that the walls and floors did not resemble the ones in the living room. The wood was scrubbed smooth and shiny, and Draco could see no holes. In the middle of the room was his bed with its frame made of black wood. Green curtains fell down the sides, and on the far wall was a Slytherin crest.
By the punch table, George Weasley narrowed his eyes at Seamus. “Did you just mess with the charms on my Traveling Mistletoe? I put magic-impervious charms on those.”
And behind him, he doesn’t see Draco fall to the floor, bury his face in his hands, and mutter with a sad, shaky laugh:
Harry doesn’t know what to feel with the knowledge of Draco and Astoria being close enough that she can call him by his first name and that he had already told her of what had transpired last night. “Oh.”
Remus laughed right alongside Sirius. “Well, if you don’t believe us… Go on then, Siri. Run right through that wall.”
Draco looked nervous. His eyes were on his book but one could see that he wasn't really reading, more of idly flipping the pages back and forth.
Yes, the Gryffindor Tower would have been more practical and less of a hassle, but he figured that some advanced reading wouldn't hurt… and Hermione really
Harry felt the panic build up in him. He forced it down, swallowed down the urge to cry and run away.
"Detained. Locked up. Forbidden to leave. Can't even Owl my friends or Floo-call my parents. And I need to shop for a new cauldron in Diagon Alley," Draco said, determined to stand his ground.
Draco grips Potter’s hand back. It feels right, Potter’s hand in his. “Give me a moment,” he says, and it’s almost a plea. He doesn’t want their first kiss to taste like tears. He takes a deep, shaky inhale, and musters the courage. “Give me a moment and then I’ll kiss you.”
He remembered what happened a few days ago, when they had last talked about the Jinx. He still had doubts on whether Draco was the one who wrote the words
Draco makes it through half of his plate, before the fork slips from his fingers and clanks loudly on the marble floor of his balcony, and Harry looks up at him, ready to ask if he should get it for him, but Draco’s gone again.
a vampire?” Draco asked an hour later after Harry was done with the tour of the mansion. They were in the front gardens now, where Harry was still touring him around in, but he couldn’t contain himself anymore. He had minded his manners for the past hour, listening attentively to Harry’s simple descriptions of the boy’s room and giving his own comments and comparisons with his own home, and figured that that was good enough.
“Hmm, that’s true. And Snape wouldn’t have known whether to dock House points from me or give me more.”
Harry exhales, slowly. He now feels Narcissa’s same surprise when he asked her to call him Harry instead. It feels… nice. “Narcissa. There’s no need to request. I had already planned on it.”
"I'm almost sad I didn't think of this sooner," Draco commented musingly as he held up his own Potter Stinks badge and perused it.
And he leaves, stomps his way through the bridge and back to the clock tower courtyard, hands shaking and heart beating furiously in his chest.
“Just go through that wall,” Sirius told him and it wasn’t really Harry’s fault that he whipped his head around to look at Sirius disbelievingly because the man did have a starling record of pranks. Sirius laughed at his expression. “I’m serious, Harry!”
Harry backed up a bit, nervous at all the attention he was getting. He thought back to his flying and remembered with a dawning dread that
The paper plate filled with a variety of desserts in Ginny’s hand toppled to the side dangerously as she exclaimed in a shrill voice, “
"Don't you think you ought to retire, mate?" Harry asked in pity as he kneeled down to untie his letter from the owl's legs.
It’s hard when Potter’s sweet enough to get angry for him. Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before he does something stupid like confess.
All heads turned to Severus, who leveled his gaze on them all, cool and firm. Lucius and Narcissa were both hardheaded, Draco supposed it came with being a pureblood and all its entitlement, but he also secretly believed that his godfather was more stubborn than both of his parents combined.
Harry stood up abruptly from his crouching position in front of an open trunk and hid the pencil behind his back. He didn’t think Remus would get it from him like Aunt Petunia always did but he wanted to be sure. He fidgeted guiltily.
“No. We’re not in the Manor anymore. You don’t have to keep any more favours for my mother. You’ve done your part.”
When Draco comes to again, the pieces of pancake on his plate have gone cold. Harry’s already on his third.
He probably did the wrong thing though, since Draco bristled and then stiffened. "Yes, well, we all know what happened the last time I offered my hand in friendship."
Potter stopped avoiding him. And Draco stopped bringing up the whole blood sucking thing every time they met each other. It was getting boring, anyway.
Harry joined him, stepping beside him. He tried not to comment about how tightly Malfoy was gripping his wand.
"I think you're looking at this very negatively, Harry," Ginny remarked the next day as they were walking the edge of the Hogwarts Lake. They walked side by side, relishing the quiet atmosphere along with the slightly cold wind that brushed past their cheeks.
his father believe? That there would be no half-rotten Dark Lord to meet him when his Dark Mark surged with pain? That it was okay to bring his son? That if the Dark Lord saw that the Malfoys were still ready to pledge allegiance to him, the Dark Lord wouldn't do anything to them?
"When are you going to keep this up anyway?" Ron asked, shoving half of the tart in his mouth. "Really, Harry, I'm also starting to miss having a conversation with you," he said through a mouthful of tart, which wasn't very comprehensible but being his best mate has its merits so Harry had no problems understanding him.
gasped Petunia Dursley. Her eyes were wide with panic and Snape saw her fingers on the doorframe start to tremble. She narrowed the opening of the door, looking behind her once with an expression of fear, before turning back to Snape with a pleading look. “You’re here to take him, aren’t you?”
Harry smiled at the flower in full-bloom, the colour of its petals transforming from yellow at the root to a pure white and then to a soft blush of pink. “It is.”
Draco's quiet voice made Harry jump, both in surprise and anticipation, and he quickly moved in his chair to look behind him.
It left a bad taste on Harry’s tongue, how Malfoy naturally expected (and accepted!) that he was like a lamb being led to slaughter.
. Severus Snape. Ex-Death Eater. Sent to retrieve the son of Lily Evans, the only person he ever truly loved, and James Potter, the person foremost in the list of those he truly hated.
Draco was almost scared to ask. "What happened to…" He glanced at his father, not wanting to say the name.
. If only I had known that Severus was actually keeping something like thathere, I would have sent you to your Aunt Anabelle.”
And no, they’re definitely not supposed to be doing this, this little tryst while everyone’s asleep, like a secret.
that Malfoy didn’t need to know to fulfill the assignment, and yet Harry still found himself wanting to share them. It only seemed fair, after all, to tell him exactly what they’ve been asking him to do.
Ron and Hermione themselves had already voiced out those very same concerns, but—they weren’t the ones to pick up Malfoy’s convulsing body or hear his tortured screams. Weren’t the ones who had to hold vigil next to his bed and see the healers’ pressed lips and hear Madame Pomfrey’s displeased mutters of “
Harry's expression softened and he sighed, rolling his eyes as he leaned forward to capture her in a hug.
They probably looked rather weird – Savior of the Wizarding World and a former Death Eater sitting beside each other at the back of the library under a window with sunlight that made their hair shine and their eyes brighter.
"You're not coming?" Draco asked, unable to keep the surprise from his voice. He immediately felt embarrassed. It almost sounded like… he wanted Potter to go with him.
Draco snorts, shaking his head in incredulity. “You certainly have a lot of things, don’t you?” He kicks his boots off and, uncaring of how muddy the ends of his robes are, puts his feet up on the bed and arranges himself so that he can look at Potter while keeping his throbbing head lying down. He’ll Scourgify his sheets later.
And it seemed Malfoy knew that, too. With a sigh, he yanked the sleeve of his robes up, and shoved it towards Harry.
And Potter’s too close, too near, and there is a traitorous hope crawling up his stomach and swelling in his chest at Potter’s proximity, his words, the way he’s looking at him. “No.”
"Yes, but I vaguely remember falling off my broom, but not hitting the ground. I wonder whose fault is that," Potter replied patiently.
. She turned to Harry. "We visited you in the Hospital Wing earlier, but you were still sleeping. Don't worry, I'll talk to Ginny later," she said firmly, giving the mentioned girl a stern glare.
Dark Lords were vanquished, Wizarding Worlds were saved, and he and Ginny had come to the agreement that they were better off as friends.
Harry, who had been in the middle of washing the dishes (because old habits die hard and Scourgifies can only do so much), popped his head out from the kitchen. He blinked at them with incredulity. “What are you guys doing here?”
Harry smiles at her gratefully. He stands up and motions towards the door. There are too many people watching here. He hates it. “Mind if we take a walk?”
“Good morning,” Draco whispers, a small smile on his thin lips. The adoration on his face is clear as day, and Harry is grateful that it is still there even after five years.
“That’s asphodel, not a lily, although asphodel’s part of the lily family too,” Draco was explaining three days into his stay as they crouched over a small portion of Snape Manor’s garden that held a variety of flowering plants.
“Don’t encourage him, darling,” Draco replied smoothly before Potter could. “Next thing you know, he’ll be yelling at everyone.”
. Draco and his love for plants never disappoints. Harry ignored the twinge in his chest as he remembered the days in the garden of Snape Manor whenever Draco would talk his ear off naming each of the flowers. He even named each of the ferns! And shrubs! Ferns and shrubs all looked the same to Harry; they were all green.
“Okay, I’ll lay off.” She grins, eyes twinkling. “But could you maybe sit in on some practices? Beat some skills into our Seeker? He’s good, really good, but he just doesn’t have the same sense for the Snitch like you did.”
And he was starting to get hungry. Again. What time did he have dinner? It must have been six hours ago. Draco wasn't sure. He didn't want to cast a Tempus lest someone hear him.
He looked around for any sight of that white-blond hair but could only see a mixture of brunettes and gingers. The blonds he saw weren’t the right shade.
Draco felt soft, velvet cloth tumble down his head and shoulders. He opened his eyes, and was surprised to see Harry so close. He was also surprised to see that he could still see Severus' office, even though he was well-aware that there was something separating them.
Maybe it was the carefree conversation he was having with Draco after so many years. Being in the same year and house for the past three and a half years, of course he'd had conversations with Draco before in the common room, in between classes, or in those fancy balls, but not like this, with just the two of them in close quarters. Harry had made sure to avoid conversations like this as much as he could.
Ever since breakfast yesterday, Harry was finally getting glimpses of the Draco that he once knew. Hell, Draco was even
And so it was on the seventh day that a determined mob of girls flocked to the Gryffindor Table during breakfast and stared pointedly at Harry Potter, who had his sandwich halfway to his mouth.
What did he say to Potter again? Potter was mad. It’s been a long time since he last saw Potter that angry. He doesn’t like it. He never did like it. But he could stand it then, years ago, so why does it hurt so much now?
Harry was well-aware of the privilege he still held after all these years. He knew some of the reports about him and the scores given to him by his superiors were sometimes exaggerated in poorly-concealed efforts to get on his good side. It had taken quite a bit of work as well, to prove to himself and to everybody that he
