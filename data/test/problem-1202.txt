As soon as the lady has finished, Harry leans over and whispers: “I want you to get on your knees right now and blow me nice and slow.”
Or so he thinks, because he can’t remember more than a few minutes. It’s a shame all of this isn’t even enough to convince him that things have to change, but a terrible argument with Harry is what finally does the trick.
At first, he thinks it's Lucius Malfoy, and he has his wand raised before he even finishes the thought, ready to curse the bugger into oblivion. But then he takes a closer look. The differences are subtle - the hair is different, not as long or slicked but shoulder-length and soft-looking. Matted with blood. The build is both slighter and bulkier. The hips are slimmer, but the shoulders are more pronounced. The skin is milky white and clearly visible under the torn jumper.
It lasts for several minutes, all of which Harry is frantically wondering what he could do to help. His mind is blank, he can't even remember the simplest spell to stop nose bleeding, although he knows they learned one in their third week of first year. His fist clenches around his wand whenever a scream is especially bloodcurdling.
However, they refuse to let Draco help and no matter how hard he fought to make them see reason, they wouldn’t allow him anywhere near the girl. St. Mungo’s has his back, but they’re also powerless when faced with determined parents and stubborn patients. He tried to help Healer Neill from afar, but they both know it won’t do any good as long as Draco isn’t allowed to see the girl for himself.
The door opens without a hitch and swings open to reveal a dark hall. While the bedroom is dirty, it’s not overwhelmingly so. It’s more like a well lived-in room with an owner who is a bit lazy. The hallway is, in contrast, the epitome of dirt. Cobwebs are everywhere - there is a huge one that nearly covers the whole passage from wall to wall (Ron would have a heart attack), and the carpet is grey from all the dust. His steps are muffled and barely noticeable. Enormous patches of paint are missing from the walls, and where he can see wallpaper, further along, it’s peeling and moulding.
“Why do we both have matching rings?” It’s out before he can hold the question back. Of all the insignificant things in this situation, two silver rings should be the most insignificant. He doesn’t expect the light blush that gives Malfoy’s deadly pale skin the illusion of life.
Feelings rush through Harry’s veins, a heady mixture that sets his blood on fire with want. He wants to shout his passion into the sky, make the world witness what he can’t put into words.
Minutes later, when they finally step out of the shower, Draco finds his voice.
The door unexpectedly opens and familiar footsteps announce his husband. Wide grey eyes meet emerald green as Harry pushes his Auror robes off his shoulders. They land on the bunch of Draco’s carelessly tossed away Healer robes, crimson red and lime green, a fitting analogy for their own deep bond.
“What, Potter? What’s this?” he demands in his haughty voice, but it’s missing the bite of previous years.
It takes some time, but she finally lets go of Harry’s hand and follows one of the other Healers. Immediately Draco is up again and talks to Milo.
With a frantic “NO!” the otter weasels its way between them, then launches itself right into Harry’s face.
Through the rush of blood in his ears, he hears faint music, a crescendo of sound and light that explodes the same time as he empties himself into Draco.
St. Mungo’s is busy today. Draco has been on his feet since four in the morning, replacing Healer Jackson, whose wife currently delivers their first child. The fourth floor is extraordinary uneventful, but the emergency room is full of sick children and the victims of a severe Quidditch accident. It’s a dangerous sport and despite Draco’s love for it, he sniffs in disdain whenever he treats an injury caused by a wayward bludger or the fall off a broom.
His stomach grumbles with emptiness. He isn’t fond of breakfast, of mornings in general, and today started way too early with the unexpected floo call at an ungodly hour. His head aches, likely the lack of sleep and food, but there is no time to sit down for something so mundane.
The feeling of closeness, of love, of brain-melting pleasure can't compare to anything else in this world. No drug or alcohol can mimic the ecstasy of a mind-shattering orgasm. And that's just the normal days.
They all share a quiet moment - Harry’s throat is so dry, he can’t reply even if he wanted to. His mother kisses him on the cheek, a whispering sensation that burns like fire. In this moment Harry is sure he will never forget it, the feeling of her lips on his skin, and he doesn’t care that she isn’t here with him but already beyond.
Draco knows it’s still a long way before he’s forgiven and he thinks some people never will. His name is ruined, not that he cares much for it, but it still causes some of his patients and visitors to frown at him and demand a different Healer to treat them or their relatives. He can understand their reservations, but it’s still frustrating, and some days it outright hurts him down to the core.
“Draco, be a dear and get us some drinks. Something light, we want to keep a clear head for the second act.” It’s a promise and they both know it.
It takes another ten minutes before Draco stops in front of the shelf, finally admitting to his interest. His face is flushed, but it’s different now. It’s lust, plain and simple and Harry feels himself harden at the sight.
The glasses are already forgotten when he pulls Draco down onto his lap. Harry leans forward, burying his face in his neck, inhaling the unique scent that is his husband’s. There’s an erratic thrum under his lips, and he can’t help biting down, enough to make Draco hiss, but not enough to break skin or leave a mark. A fact he rectifies a few seconds later as he begins to suck at the alabaster white skin, leaving a trail of love bites like a second collar. Draco moans softly, his hand fists in Harry’s suit jacket like it’s the only connection to reality he has. He’s not in subspace yet, and maybe he won’t get there today, but Harry’s going to do his best to fuck his brains out when the time comes.
“There’s nothing going on. We’re just spending some time together. You know, like normal people. Talking. Nothing more.”
He finally reaches the platinum blond hair, silky to the touch and Harry’s fingers itch to run through it, to feel the softness, to smell the ridiculously expensive shampoo. Soon he will do just that, just a few more minutes.
This is the last chapter of this work. It was meant to be a writing exercise, you know, writing every day about 100 to 1000 words. I thought it was a good idea because I tend to overthink things alot and wanted to make myself just go with the flow, just write away. It's why I don't have this beta read, but merely proof-read by my fiance, and was going lightly on the editing afterwards. It's basically still a raw draft, but it's okay for me and I think some of you enjoyed it.
Quick end notes: I consulted a "How to" for the nipple piercings. While there is no graphic description, there are some things taken from that guide. In the Muggle world, nipple piercings take about 3 to 6 months to heal (can be up to 12), but that wouldn't have worked with the story and we are in the Wizarding world anyway.
“Where are we, Professor?” he asks, although he knows the answer, somehow. But somehow he doesn’t. This place is confusing, and at the same time, it’s not.
It only occurs to him what real darkness means when something crashes into his head, rendering him unconscious.
It’s not necessary to lock Draco up while he’s alone, but it gives them both a thrill to know that there is only one key and only at one person’s disposal, and it’s not Draco. Despite a recently shattering orgasm, his cock tries to rise at the pictures that form in his head.
As he watches Malfoy sleep, he can recall the deep-seated hatred he felt for the longest time, the bewilderment when the git refused to identify him at Malfoy Manor. Those memories seem even farther away, like so many things happened between then and now; it’s all washed out. Harry wonders just how close they work together when thinking about their school days feels almost nostalgic.
It's not the prestige Draco wants back, he is glad the Malfoy line will find its end with him. But he misses the bright smiles on his parents' faces, the high spirit. They never were real parents, having the House Elves raising him, but in those days he had felt near to them. Before it all turned to hell, before the Dark Lord, Draco had felt loved and treasured.
Ginny begging him not to make a mistake, not to rush into this scam of a relationship since Draco only wanted to use him.
Draco is nervous. It’s been a long time since he allowed Harry to see this special side of him, but over the last few months the creature inside him got restless, and so did Draco.
How many nights had he been awake, the ghosts of all the lost his only company.
Everyone - except for the man in the other box. Harry’s sure he’s only clapping for them.
Beyond, there is an overgrown garden, but the trees look all wrong. They’re wound around themselves like they suffered incredible pain and tried to shield themselves from it. Some of the trees even seem to have faces, contorted in agony. Dean has made them all watch Muggle horror films, and the feeling that Harry is trapped in one gets stronger with each passing second. There are pieces of evidence that something is very wrong, the least his totally changed body.
Malfoy trails off, but it’s enough information to paint a gruesome picture. He can understand what Malfoy means. Harry is bulkier than him, knows he isn’t bad looking, but he’s a far cry from someone with centuries of considerate breeding, the extravagant limbs of noblesse. He swallows the bile that’s been steadily rising in his throat, shakes off the disgust that tries to settle in his bones. There’s time to really think about what happened in this house, what might happen in the next hour. It’s just not right now.
With stiff knees Harry stood up, just then realising Pansy and Blaise had been there the whole time, silently watching their interactions. They both wore a soft smile and Harry knew it was another fight he had won. They never doubted his relationship with Draco ever again.
With a start he realises it is, indeed, an angel and his very own. He has never seen Draco’s Veela but he couldn’t have imagined a better place or a better time. The sunset is the perfect canvas to highlight the beauty of the creature that is his husband. His torso is naked, but the cold doesn’t seem to faze Draco as he draws closer and begins to dance.
For a few years they developed a taste for morally questionable places. But having sex in a graveyard was nothing compared to a quicky behind a tree at the Weasley Orchard, mere metres away from an enthusiastic Molly, picking apples, chatting to Arthur about another grandchild on the way.
“I know it’s not the same, but I charmed the room after the meadow we went for your initiation. Can you feel it?” And Draco can. The magic settles round him, soothes his aching head and awakens the Veela.
It took an obscene amount of money to secure the box only for them (they’re usually shared), but the money’s worth it as they sit down in the first row with a perfect view of the stage. The lights are already out and it doesn’t take long for the orchestra to assemble.
Harry doesn’t care. He leads them to a secluded corner with a small table near the bar and sits down. When Draco tries to sit next to him, he shakes his head.
“u ok?” it spells. Probably Hermione who still waits for him at her table. His fingers glide over the raised letters, spelling a simple “ok” to alleviate her worries. She surely has seen him sitting down with Malfoy and is now concerned they might try and resume their childish feud.
After the war he had been severely depressed, guilt and shame weighing him down as well as the people. Everyone was always staring at him, judging him for his failures, never for his accomplishments. When he started Healer training at St. Mungo’s patients refused to be treated by him, always reducing him to the ugly Mark on his left arm.
The chicken is simmering in the pan next to the onions he slowly heats. It should be all ready in about fifteen and he hopes to Merlin Harry will be in time when he gets everything on the table. The caramelised onions only taste good if they’re fresh out of the pan. If they sit too long they lose their hearty taste.
“potter stinks” glows red and unforgiving back at him. He looks at it, outraged, before he looks back at Malfoy. Despite the words, he doesn’t look malicious. More like playful. Like it really is just a joke, not some insult to start a fight. He grins softly and it transforms his whole face. Instead of looking sharp and pointed, pale and unhealthy, the slight smile gives his face something round that soothes the angles of his cheekbones and his nose. His grey eyes glitter with mirth, almost erasing the slight bruises under them that speak of some sleepless nights. His hair shimmers golden in the warm light of the pub.
He barely makes it out of the fireplace when he is assaulted by the intense smell of roasting meat and freshly chopped garlic. It’s odd, since they never eat at any of their houses. Pansy and Blaise meet them at the chosen restaurant, ten minutes after Draco and Harry arrive, since it’s fashionable to be always the last one to arrive. They have it down to an artform, and are always punctual on the second, and Harry suspects more than witchcraft behind it. Judging from the evil twinkle in Pansy’s eyes whenever he admits that they were exactly ten minutes late, not a second earlier or later, she seems to be in league with demons or the devil.
Harry isn’t surprised to find Malfoy in the library on Monday evening, furiously writing on an essay for Charms, for the same reasons. They are comfortable around each other now, working on their homework and occasionally complaining about the antics of the couples. Seamus and Pansy have been sneaking off between classes. They laugh for a good solid hour about it, imagining McGonagall's face when she finally caught the lovebirds.
He feels the moment when Draco gets too enthusiastic and the humbler works his magic. Just like with crawling, Draco’s movements are restricted, and the more he moves, the more it hurts. His tongue falters, but Harry will have none of it. He tightens his grip on the wet strands and forces Draco’s face right back.
“Sounds like a good plan to me,” Harry agrees enthusiastically and rushes out of the bathroom to get dressed.
He collects a box of chocolate frogs and sugar quills, stopping shortly at the liquorice wands before he puts it all on the cash desk so the clerk can ring it up. She’s looked at them in anger when they entered the shop, but now she smiles, adding a small box of heart-shaped nougats.
Draco does, and the horrified expression on his face makes Harry’s dick twitch in interest. His arousal has subtly burned the whole time, but he allows himself some comfort and finally unbuttons his pants and lowers the zipper. The relive is instant and he sighs in contentment.
“No, the house won’t let me eat. Water’s allowed, thank Merlin, but it punishes me for doing something not to its liking. And it would really like for me to not eat.”
Draco is standing in front of him, in his ever ethereal beauty: white faced, slender limbs and silver-blond hair, his skin unblemished, his body whole. Harry doesn’t want to trust his eyes, and tries to remember what Draco had looked like at Malfoy Manor when the Snatchers got hold of him, Ron and Hermione. Different, to say the least. Gaunt and stretched thin, his eyes dead and without any hope, dark bruises colouring his face, his arms and every other patch of skin Harry could see then.
While Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star, Harry and Draco are fast asleep, dreaming of each other.
Draco finally settles on the step below him, panting and sweating, but still ethereally beautiful. His hair is plastered to his neck, wet and dark, but Harry still grabs it firmly and pulls Draco’s head up. He unconsciously licks his lips at the sight of Harry’s cock, but before he is allowed this treat, there is other work to do.
The hallway to the small bar is crowded with wizards and witches from seemingly all kinds of nations. There are two Indian women, dressed in colourful saris, talking to two women wearing hijabs. There’s a group of men in scarlet robes, not unlike his Auror uniform, but the robes are only half-long and are combined with golden bloomers. Every one of them is wearing a decorative sword and broad peacock feathers. There are people who are dressed formally in suits and dresses.
Harry gets up from his chair, stepping behind Draco, who hasn’t so much as twitched since he knelt down. He shudders when Harry kneels next to him and grabs his balls, but he doesn’t move otherwise. Harry rolls them in his hand, his grip firm but not painful, not yet anyway. As Draco’s breath hitches, gooseflesh marking his perfect skin, he lets go and unscrews the wing bolts on each side. His dragon flinches when the relatively cold metal meets his bare skin as Harry pulls his balls back behind his legs, forcing him to widen his stance and finally let go of the now useless parcel.
“If this is a station, where do you want to go?”
Harry watches for another minute or two, before he spells his clothes away, hopefully into the hamper in the laundry room, but he can’t be bothered to care right now. He easily overtakes Draco, who whimpers softly every other step, and settles down, legs spread, his cock proudly pointing at his sub. A wave of his hand summons a cushion, making it comfortable for him to sit and he passes the time by wanking, his movements slow and deliberate, to keep the fire burning.
Once they even got a spectator. Well, Harry is not certain, but the evidence speaks for itself.
“I know it’s been a long time and I’m sorry I didn’t bring Harry with me. I know you deserve to meet him, but I’m not ready. He’s too precious to wallow with us in the dark.”
The days in the force are long and vicious, blood, death and despair his companions with barely a ray of hope. But Harry has a rule and in his endless years as an Auror, he never strayed from it, no matter how horrible the day.
For now, they’re making out like teenagers, kissing and biting at each other, small pecks and entangled tongues. People are milling around, talking, and laughing, but Harry only registers the soft lips that willingly part for him, for soft moans and whimpers, a hand in his hair.
It’s a bit much, really, but despite his earlier protests, he kind of enjoys himself. And Malfoy. It’s surprising what good company Malfoy actually is, even if he’s the most snarky, most sarcastic bloke Harry’s ever met. He makes up for it with genuine compliments and actually talking without sounding condescending. And he knows a lot of things about fashion and clothes and the importance of thread counts. He’s also surprisingly open to Harry’s likes and dislikes. Although some pieces are colours and styles he’s still not sure aren’t too risky, the things they’ve chosen do not only suit him, but are also things Harry can see himself wearing in his everyday life.
Draco’s eyes were closed, his hair a mess, but Harry hadn’t seen anything more beautiful than his boyfriend lying next to him on a rainy Thursday afternoon. He gave Draco a last lingering look before he sank down, settling on Draco’s collarbone, pointy and slightly uncomfortable, but there wasn’t a place Harry would rather be.
To their credit, they aren’t always like that. They had days when everything went fine, when conversation was easy, the food good and Harry felt just the same around them like he did with his other friends. But the situation is always fragile and a wrong word can set Pansy off on one of her rants that end with the accusation that Harry set the hat on fire in an act of revenge, because Pansy tried to give him to Voldemort. Which is ridiculous because if Harry wanted revenge, he wouldn’t destroy a perfectly good hat. And why had she worn the hat in the first place?
On one absolutely orgiastic weekend, Harry did not only finish his first triathlon, but also found out that men were capable of multiple orgasms - but only after coming so many times that his dick was ready to quit on him forever. Seeing the Veela in all its glory, uninhibited and free, the huge, white wings wrapping him in a cocoon of warmth had been worth the months of tireless training and the soreness that slowly seeped into his joints.
Harry should’ve known that Malfoy is a sneaky bastard. “I said ‘I’ll promise’. I never actually promised anything and you didn’t ask me for it.” His smile is smug, but it doesn’t carry the air of superiority he had in fourth or fifth year, so Harry doesn’t mind. Much.
In the end, everybody comes around, even if it takes some years and, for some, is still taking time.
Malfoy, Harry decides, looks like a completely different person when he smiles.
“Panties, really? You won’t need them tonight, so take them off. I want to see what’s mine at any given time.”
Malfoy convulses for another minute, his nerve endings fired up enough that they don’t immediately realise the hurt is gone. He begins to sob, his cries muffled, but clearly there. Harry's chest swells in accomplishment until soft, pathetic whispers reach his ear.
There are fairy lights, some of them Muggle since the Wizarding community opened up and slowly adapted, but most of them are made of real fairies who are flittering around, drenching everything in bright red and green and gold. It’s still a whole month until Christmas, but Harry is in a decidedly festive mood. Just this morning, he had a taste of the first gingerbread of the season and it was spicy and tasty and perfect.
The Opera: For those who didn't get the "hints": It's Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, probably one of the most known operas, I think. I have seen it like, 15 years ago in music class, so I mostly followed the Wikipedia entry for any information.
Harry finds Malfoy cowering between two bookcases, like the frightened coward that he really is. He doesn’t seem aware of the danger he’s in, preoccupied with wiping blood away from his bare chest. He doesn’t wear a jumper, his trousers are almost shredded away. What’s left of the fabric is drenched in blood and other liquids Harry doesn’t want to think off, so he lets that fact go.
“I hate to urge you on, but we don’t have much time and there are others who want to see you.” That breaks Harry’s calm immediately. Draco is right, of course, he can’t afford to linger in the past. Surely he will have enough time for that when all is over.
It’s bitingly cold and Hogsmeade is covered under heavy layers of perfect snow. Icicles adorn every roof and everyone is bubbling with pre-Christmas-excitement, despite the wounds of the war fresh in their minds.
Harry gives the tits a few more slaps, then presses his mouth against them. The skin feels hot against his lips, and he can’t help himself and decorates them with another chain if hickeys. Tomorrow, Draco will look even more like a slut, soft bruises, and dark marks everywhere.
It isn't actually my fault it took so long to update. My fiance pestered me every day if I have something new for him to correct (he does a quick grammer/spelling check) and I always told him that I hadn't anything finished. So when the day came and I actually had the chapter, I told him right away, but he didn't have time to read it. And the next day I told him again, but still he had no time. And then again and again and again and now we're here.
Almost immediately he frowns at the unknown feeling, the weight restricting his movements. He has yet to find out what it really does, but Harry is glad to help. With only the tips of his fingers he caresses a sensitive spot on Draco’s hips. It’s equally ticklish and arousing and normally Draco would squirm away, trying to escape the sensation.
Special thanks, again, to hmn007, who did a great, perfect, beautiful job beta reading and gave some valuable input!
“And if I wanna reach everyone?”
“De Rais, he liked kids. He would take them from their families, make them pliable with food and alcohol, and then string them up, rip off their clothes and show them how he got off on their helplessness. Then he or one of his accomplices would kill them. He was a monster. And he liked boys best. Those with elegant hands and feet, graceful bodies, fair hair, and fascinating eyes.”
“Do you,” Malfoy swallows painfully, “Do you remember anything?”
please let me in your pants,
The white marble has darkened with the years, but at least the inscription is still clearly visible. ‘Narcissa Malfoy, beloved mother of Draco’ is all it says. Dates are not important. Her sacrifice is.
There’s a rush on the stage, and it interrupts Harry enough that he becomes aware of his own pressing problem. Between his very fitting trousers and a wiggling husband, he barely gets his fly open. He’s just as wet as Draco.
“Marriage rings? You mean you and I are married?”
The trail gets thicker and fresher as he slowly walks down another hallway. He isn’t in a hurry, finally understands why anticipation is half the pleasure. There’s something primal and animalistic in hunting someone down. It’s almost like he can smell the fear in the air, a thick stench of despair and agony creating an enticing flavour. He licks his lips as he rounds another corner.
His husband is still sitting straight, almost unnaturally even for him, like he’s waiting to be called every second now. The dress is tight enough to give a hint of what’s hiding underneath, and Harry knows exactly who’s going to fetch them another round of champagne.
He arrives late at the Manor, but there is still a bit of light, painting the sky an intriguing orange and pink, and Draco takes a moment to appreciate nature. He knows that Veelas supposedly are the most alluring things in existence, but he could never see himself as this ethereal beauty. He knows his faults and errors better than anyone and it marrs this perfect picture. Looks can be deceiving, he’s learned that the hard way, and Draco never made that particular mistake again.
And how can he not, when his husband is the epitome of sex, with his slender built, his soft alabaster skin, his perfect lips that can snarl and smile and suck? With his hands that look so delicate, yet are so strong that they can lift him up and move him around (all within the reasonable time of three seconds, but still)?
Draco gets up and steps between Harry’s legs. He’s blushing again, and Harry has seen him looking at the auditorium. While it’s highly unlikely that anybody sees them, it is possible though. However, with his back to the open space, there won’t be much to observe. Not yet anyway.
It's such a normal thing to do, cooking together. Other couples do it and they are doing fine. But for them it's one of those things that doesn't work, no matter how hard they try. It's not the only one: buying furniture is another occasion when they will be more likely at each other's throats than have a civilised conversation. Draco remembers that one time they tried to buy curtains, which ended with them not talking for days.
He checks if the man is still watching, then turns Draco’s whole body so they face him completely, before putting both his hands back on the breasts. He feels perky nipples under his palms and rubs them softly in a few circles before he pinches them both between his thumb and index finger. He and the man exchange silent words while Draco throws his head back onto Harry’s shoulder, the sensation too much for him to stay still any longer.
It had been a complete surprise to see Harry on a bench overlooking Ladies Pond. They had sat there, watching the night making way for a spectacular sunrise, cuddling close under a conjured fleece blanket, not talking but enjoying it nevertheless.
His throat is dry, and his cock is practically ripping through his jeans.
The blindfold is damp, soaked by tears of frustration and it conjures a smile on Harry’s face. All these years and he can still elicit this kind of reaction with a bit of prolonged foreplay. But he doesn’t need the blindfold now, and he pulls it away.
Harry isn’t a big fan of winter. It’s cold and dark and gloomy. When he was young, he was always freezing because the Dursleys couldn’t have been bothered to buy him a fitting jacket or some sturdy boots. It all changed when he finally got the money, his vaults full of shiny gold, and the first winter after the war he maybe had gone a bit overboard. He still owns three of the five different greatcoats he bought that day and more boots than he cares to count and while he is slightly embarrassed about it, the certainty to have clothes, no matter how harsh the weather, doesn’t allow him to feel bad.
It’s all worth in the end, when he sees the little twinkle in Harry’s eyes, the only sign that despite the endless questions and the fretful politicians. Draco knows his husband likes to do his duty and a successful gala is a job well done.
The centerpiece is a black stand with a thick cushion, and it reminds him of some Muggle sports device he's seen at Teddy's school years ago. The children vaulted over it, helped by something like an elastic spring, but that can't be it, especially not in a place like this. Draco doesn't think of himself as innocent, not even naive, but he's not as comfortable as Harry is in expressing his sexuality and often finds himself at a loss with all the fancy things that can be bought nowadays.
For all the foreplay they’ve enjoyed this evening, the initial penetration is rushed and artless. Harry uses short but brutal stabs to fuck Draco open enough, then plunges in, burying himself to the hilt. Even the panties aren’t enough to muffle Draco’s scream. Sharp fingernails bite into Harry’s shoulder and both legs wrap around his hips, gravity allowing Draco to sink even further on his cock. The first thrust sends the hair tie flying into the audience, never to be seen again.
Anyway, I had the feeling it was all too cheery and relationships aren't like that. So I felt I needed to write something more realistic ("The more I read, the more I think you are processing our relationship," my fiance says. What a surprise!).
Next to the door that leads from the room, lies a crimson robe. Harry picks it up, surprised but not, when he finds his own name stitched to the inseam. It fits him perfectly, just like the strange jeans and jumper do. In the pocket he finds his wand, the only thing that is somewhat familiar. It gleams in the weak light, freshly polished like he’s never seen before. Whoever he is now, whatever version of Harry, he obviously takes good care of his things. There’s a spark of curiosity in the back of his mind that wants to know more, like how old he is, but the voice calls for him again and the thought is forgotten in an instant.
There are potatoes and roast beef, pumpkin juice and pie, carottes râpées, small quiches, madeleines and tarte tatins, treacle tart, custard-filled pastries and other delicious things Harry can’t be bothered to name. With a family as big as theirs, there are influences from all over the world and it reflects on their meals. On the far side is something Romanian. Harry can’t remember the name but he knows Draco will gorge himself with it.
Despite the obvious grossness I don’t think you should tell someone your dick is itching. Sounds mighty unsanitary to me.”
Temptation is something that is always present in his life, ranging from staying at home and let the Ministry fend for their own, from going out and burning down the Prophet headquarters.
He also remembers the first time they kissed and it was also a moment full of doubts, of what-ifs, before Harry had leaned down, touched his cheek almost hesitantly, his emerald green eyes questioning and Draco had closed the gap, throwing everything overboard. He hadn’t wanted to make the first step, had been afraid he was reading the signs wrong, the surreptitiously glances and barely-there touches.
There’s silence afterward, except for their heavy breathing. Harry has barely time to open his eyes, when the clapping starts, just a trickle at first before it’s evolving into standing ovations. He’s confused for a second before he realises they managed to finish in time with the opera, and people are cheering on the orchestra and singers.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts like a bitch, his muscles scream at him like he just ran a marathon, and his throat is parched like he hasn't had anything to drink in eons. Despite all that he's relatively comfortable. He isn't in his own bed in the eighth year dorm, but the mattress is soft and the blankets warm. Through the curtains falls soft, dim light, typical for a winter day in Scotland.
For all the danger Draco poses to people who are dumb enough to cross him, as soon as they’re in bed, he turns into an almost submissive cuddly type. And Harry doesn’t mean sex, no. He means literal cuddling.
“I couldn’t have wished for a better present,” Harry says and means every word. “Although there’s something not quite right, don’t you agree? You can’t go with a collar. It doesn’t match the dress at all.”
He sighs, letting his mind drift to better days than this one.
“I’m gonna turn you around, and you’re gonna hold onto the banister and look at the box over there.”
He reaches around the tight-laced bundle and slowly helps his present to right himself. His knees must hurt, but he doesn’t concern himself with that. Harry has switched from loving husband to Dom just this second and a bit of discomfort never hurt anyone.
Instead he watches the perfect backside arch into the pleasure, the bound hands helplessly searching for something to grab, something to hold onto, but there is nothing, just the gradual burning pleasure the plug gives. It’s not enough, not by far, but it keeps the fire going, slowly driving his lover mad. Harry likes himself some good bondage, loves the intricate patterns he can create, loves the attention he can pay to the body under his hands.
It's a cold Walpurgis Night. Draco pulls his cloak tighter around himself, but the shivers don't subside. He feels ill, part of it the headache that hasn't let go since the early hours of the morning, the other part the sick anticipation of today. He always comes here alone.
Draco gives curt and sharp orders, snapping at an unfortunate photographer who didn’t get out of the way quick enough. Harry sees that his eyes are clouded in pain - that damn headaches again - but when he kneels down in front of Mila and softly murmurs to her, there is nothing but concern for her well-being there.
“Draco,” Harry says evenly, like nothing happened at all, a poster boy for calmness. He sees the blush spread and intensify, a lovely pink.
A pop announces Harry’s arrival. They agreed to meet here, where nobody can watch. It’s a well kept secret between just the two of them. The air is heavy with anticipation. For Draco it’s always strange to give up the control over his body, to let the creature out. They are two different persons, even if they share the same body.
I don't have a concrete timeline set for this. It's more of a writing exercise to me, to get a feeling for the characters and to write something that is short but to the point. That said, I imagine this piece happens way in the future, but I think it's vague enough to leave it to the reader's imagination.
When Draco opens the door, he wonders if he mixed up the doors. Instead of hospital dreariness, he steps onto a sunlit clearing. A small stream gurgles in the distance, accompanied by a happy, chirpy song of two starlings, huddled together in a tree nearby. Amidst the flood of wild flowers stands Harry, a wicker basket in one hand, his stiff Auror robes covering the grass in a makeshift picnic blanket. Magic permeates the air, a sweet and enticing smell that touches something inside him.
“That said, you don’t look too fresh either, so why don’t you lay down for a bit. It will be some time before dinner is ready.”
It seems like an impossible demand, but Harry is the living (not for much longer, though) example that even the impossible can be achieved if one pushes their boundaries far enough.
They’re still young, barely fifty, which means they didn’t even finish a third of their lives yet. In fact their parents were that one crazy generation that got kids as soon as they finished school. Back then everything was so unsafe and people clung to each other, finding comfort from the terrors of the first war.
“But I’m not gay! And I’m with Ginny!”
“What’s the matter with you, Harry?” Hermione asks as he sits down at the Gryffindor table, picking a plate and loading it with scrambled eggs and bits of sausage and toast. He smiles at her.
In the middle of the room, supported by an old stool, cowers Draco Malfoy. He’s grown up as well, is bloody and hurt, but Harry immediately feels hostility rising in him. There’s no question in his mind that Malfoy is the culprit of this. He’s the reason Harry can’t remember growing up or doesn’t know why he’s here or where ‘here’ is. And it doesn’t matter, not anymore, because Harry will make him take it all back, be it giving the memories back or turning him into a lanky eighteen-year-old again.
“Fuck!” It’s such a strong word, one that he would never have expected from Malfoy.
“Good, I want you to show me,” Harry demands, a little cold, but only to suppress his own excitement. He has strict rules, not only for his sub, but for himself. Never showing his cards until the end is one of them, and he revels in the desperation Draco sometimes shows because it’s hard to get a reaction out of Harry.
Draco is the Master of Blowjobs, courtesy of years and years of training. He remembers fondly that wild week some decades ago when they both trained how to deep-throat. Ever since, his husband’s mouth is like a black hole, sucking everything in with vigour. It’s an art form, really.
“Pansy was devastated, you see, because Finnigan had a hand in her blouse and you don’t want to know where she had her hand in turn.”
He looks up at his last guest, suddenly ashamed that he hasn’t addressed Remus before.
His husband is frantically grabbing for something to hold onto when Harry uses both hands to pull on the piercings. They’re magically reinforced and can’t damage the nipple in any way, but they still hurt - and obviously in just the right way. Precome is gushing from Draco’s slit, fat drops that look and smell delicious. His lips are moving without rest, probably begging, if he’s still present enough to form words.
Finally Draco nods. He looks dazed, but there’s a glimmer in his eyes. Anticipation. Excitement.
“Draco,” he finally says, his voice different than before, lower and more commanding. It gets Draco’s attention every time, and Harry delights in the way his husband suddenly sits straighter in anticipation.
Enough is enough.
she has a lovely rack,
There were many things that had been whispered in Harry’s ears over the years. Countless plans during their time at Hogwarts, confessing dreams during the long days while searching for Horcruxes and sharing fears in the furious days after the final Battle.
A moan brings Harry back to his favourite part of his birthday, the present. He has made himself one just before he left for work this morning and it’s time to open it. He smiles as he sips the whisky, looking at the tightly bound bundle right under a potted palm tree.
Harry's fucking tall. The floor is ridiculously far away, and he sways slightly as he fights for balance. His arms are massive. They're long and muscular; he feels them bunching under the black jumper he wears. It looks almost obscene how the soft fabric stretches tightly over his biceps. As Harry grabs for the nightstand to keep himself from falling, he sees his hands.
Harry puts the parcel down on an unused sideboard and settles in his favourite armchair. A fresh glass of firewhisky tells him Kreacher is aware he’s home but decided not to disturb him. The Elf knows their traditions and he knows not to show himself for the next forty-eight hours.
Patience is a virtue, one that Harry has perfected over the years. Still, this last half an hour is torturous.
“Forth.” It’s all Harry needs to say.
Walpurgis Night paints it all in shadows, only allowing the ghosts to linger. Instead of laughter, the Manor is now a place of tears and crippling sadness. Everyone is dead and long forgotten and the pain squeezes Draco's chest painfully.
He still blinks owlishly when he’s pulled forward, strong arms closing around him, unforgiving but infinitely gentle. Draco murmurs sweet nothings in his ear, stroking through his hair, oblivious to the grime and dirt.
“You look gorgeous, Dragon.” They kiss softly, not much more than a small peck.
It’s hard to stay silent right now. Because he wants to try the horse, even though he can’t imagine how exactly it would work. But that’s the beauty of it because, in this role, he doesn’t have to imagine. He just has to let himself be led by his Dom. So he waits for Harry to decide and shivers in excitement when, finally, Harry turns and unhooks the leash, a delighted glint in his eyes.
As always, if you find any horrendous mistakes, please let me know. I will correct those mistakes I see after a few days and a little distance, but hmn007 and me hopefully managed to erase them all beforehand.
Also, I consulted three different websites for the language of flowers and they all had different meanings for the same type of flower, it was exhausting. So please, if you're well versed with colours and flowers and what it all means, don't be mad at me if they mean something different for you. I eventually settled for one page and that's what my flowers mean.
“Let’s get back to the castle, shall we?” Malfoy - no, Draco - asks and grabs Harry’s right hand with his left. They lace their fingers together, the grip tight and not willing to ever let go. Harry nods and they begin their walk back, but then he stops.
It's a BAD HABIT Harry can't seem to break him from, no matter how hard he tries. Even years of promising that he is forgiven, that everything is well won't do anything. It's infuriating, really.
(See the end of the chapter for
They sip their drinks in silence, but it’s not uncomfortable. Harry thinks it’s a great trait in any relationship when two can enjoy silence between them. Talking is overrated. His Galleon vibrates in his jeans pocket and he fishes for it, putting it on the table.
Malfoy finally seems to notice that he isn’t alone. His face lights up for a second before he must see Harry's expression.
‘Her hair is black,
(See the end of the chapter for
And those are only the visible features. The real treasures are the things Draco usually keeps hidden. Thus began a game between them, almost two decades ago: the Veela would send out subtle signals for Harry to pick up, promising him delightful hours, depending on the kind of thing he did to finally get its attention.
It’s the last Harry hears before he steps onto the clearing, facing Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and letting the ring fall between into the shadows, forgotten for all time.
He remembers dying on the mossy floor of the Forbidden Forest, surrounded by the vilest people that ever lived, in an act of love.
People said he got more reckless after everything had ended, but Harry liked to think of himself as more trusting, which was why he opened the door without precaution. Nothing at Hogwarts could hurt him now.
In hindsight Draco is glad that Harry had been away in Poland on some Auror conference and hadn’t noticed Draco’s relapse in old habits. But those Muggles… he still shudders in disgust, thinking about them. He has never seen more hatred, never heard more vile insults outside the war that weren’t directed at himself. Hermione and him had only been able to obtain what they needed with a mix of force and well-placed blackmail, and they both agreed to never mention to a living soul what length they went.
He remembers Narcissa Malfoy urgently whispering in his ear, while he lay on the damp forest floor, just coming back from the death.
Harry looks up at Dumbledore again, and again he sees the other one, the figure in its dark cloak. He understands where all ways lead to, in the end, no matter how long or short the distance. The knowledge weighs heavy on his mind, and this time, it sticks with him. It’s another decision he has to make, too young to have to do it, but forced to anyway.
They spent another weekend in Hogsmeade after Malfoy told him between classes that he needs something from Tomes and Scrolls. Harry’s never been inside the shop despite Hermione frequently trying to make him go with her, but he’s not surprised when the interior is dark and musty and full of books. It seems typical for Wizarding stores to be stuffed full to the point of overflow, like Ollivander’s or George’s shop. The books are stacked high under the ceiling, inside of shelves, on tables, chairs and every other available surface. It smells old, no thanks to the blocked up windows (more books). Malfoy slowly weaves through the rows, careful not to trip over tomes that look ancient. There is a faint whisper in the air and Harry isn’t sure if it’s a Wireless somewhere or the books themselves, trying to lure him in. His skin crawls and he tries to rub his arms sneakily. He’s sure he’s offending someone, being on edge in this shop. It takes several minutes, then Malfoy stands beside him, holding a brown parcel as far away as he can without dropping it. He looks unhappy and hurries Harry out and into the harsh cold of the Scottish winter. He’s never been so glad to feel the sun on his face, not even after escaping from Gringotts on the back of a dragon. Malfoy heaves a relieved sigh, before he shakes himself like an animal. His blond hair flops around, the light catching and setting it aglow. It looks almost ethereal and Harry is confused why, for Merlin’s sake, he even notices.
The End.
Spikes the size of a small Abraxan drum through his skull, but Draco knows he can’t bail on this. Despite Harry’s reluctance to go to those happenings, his husband is a dutiful clerk to the Ministry and wouldn’t miss a single minute.
He doesn’t need to count the beat in his head, doesn’t need to watch his feet. Everything falls into place.
He spent the day mostly by himself, although his friends asked him every few minutes if he really wanted to be alone. “No problem Harry, you can join us,” they said, but Harry didn’t want that. They are all on some post-war euphoria that includes a lot of cuddling, kisses, and extended snogging sessions in the common room. Thinking of it, almost everyone went and found another. Ron and Hermione, of course. Neville and Luna are a thing now, just like Pansy Parkinson, of all people, and Seamus, who is disgustingly besotted. There are Parvati and Terry Boot, Ginny and Dean, Hannah Abbott and Millicent Bulstrode. Michael Corner is dating someone from a lower year, just like Blaise Zabini. The castle is full of couples and Harry is an island of seeming loneliness amongst them. But he feels good. He doesn’t need a significant other, he’s content by himself. Sure, physical intimacy might sometimes be nice, but it isn’t anything Harry can’t do with his own two hands (and a couple of magical toys). He is a teenager after all.
He murmurs a preparation spell and slicks his fingers with precome, then roughly prods at Draco’s hole just to check that everything is fine. They don’t use much prep, both enjoying the slight pain that comes from plunging right in, but that doesn’t mean they don’t use any lube or prep at all.
It happened often when he was fresh out of his apprenticeship: people refusing to be treated by him because he was Draco Malfoy, son of a war criminal and Death Eater himself. It’s why he was transferred to the fourth floor. People in a coma didn’t complain about who treated them. The families, of course, were another matter, but a formidable success, finally waking up a war victim of a prolonged Imperius curse, helped him get through some of those thick skulls.
“Anyway, we got sucked in through the door. When I woke up, you were gone. I wandered the halls and found our necromancer - he is dead. I was relieved at first until I realised what he had done before his death.
After the war another time in his life began, and while he didn’t need to hide inside his mind anymore, Draco liked to think about the worlds he created, the story that hid around every corner of his fantasy.
And, alright,  maybe Harry has some Bad Habits too, he thinks as he sits on his hospital bed, a distressed nurse bandaging his badly burned arm in Murtlap-soaked gauze while his enraged husband prowl back and forth, left and right through his private room. They actually named the whole wing after him, the Harry-Potter-Magical-Emergencies-And-Maladies-Wing.
Harry vanishes through the Floo with one last, lingering and sweet kiss, leaving Draco behind with a painful half-erection and barely reigned in impatience for the week to be over.
Together they make their way over to the tables, which dangerously bow under the weight of pans and pots, plates and glasses.
“You know, being Pansy’s gay best friend doesn’t always have its perks. Just last week she got a delivery from France. She pulled me out of Arithmancy, claiming she had something life-threatening to tell me, so Vector let me go. Probably thought the Dark Lord was back with all the ruckus Pansy was making. Anyway, she dragged me to the girl’s dorm only to show me the lingerie she got and ask me which one was the most sexy on her so she could wear it for her date. I had to scrub my eyeballs with Mulpepper’s, but I’m afraid the pictures are seared into my brain.”
Harry lies on the sofa, sprawled over the cushions, deeply asleep. His glasses are askew and his Auror robes are on the floor, crumpled and forgotten. The song that plays hasn’t any lyrics and it doesn’t sound familiar to Draco, but it’s beautiful anyway.
Draco doesn't know what Harry has planned. They talk about kinks and how to explore them often enough, but never in concrete detail. It's always Harry who makes the scenes come alive and that's how Draco likes it best. He's just not creative enough and it astounds him just how plentiful, mean, and erotic his husband's fantasies can be. He's a completely different man when he's in 'dom mode' as he calls it, and Draco is helplessly at his mercy.
Then a branch breaks right beside him, but he knows it’s not one of the Death Eaters, coming to get him. He turns, smiling.
Grey eyes blink furiously to focus in the dim light before they find his and Harry falls in love once more with the depth and the sincerity of their expression. It was the first thing that caught his attention all those years ago, after the war, after everything was said and done and Harry was left with no plan in his life. They always broadcast everything so clearly, so openly, vulnerable but strong at the same time. They never once betrayed him, even when words tried to.
I'm back! Since everybody got some resolutions for 2020, I made some too, and while some of them include impossible things I somehow have to pull off, finishing this story was high on my list and even doable! The secret to success is simple: it was already finished, but not proof-read. I bothered the fiance for quite some time, but he just didn't do it, claiming 2 in the morning wasn't the best time to remind him of his obligations. Anyway, here are all the missing chapters. Please look at the end notes of chapter 30, where I will do some more explaining, seeing this was always meant to be the first part of a series.
“It’s not your fault,” Draco says, but that only makes the tears come faster. “They would have killed me anyway. My life was over the second the Dark Lord knew of our connection. I was living on borrowed time when they caught you.” His hand lifts from Harry’s shoulder and begins to pet his hair. It feels more like a soft breeze than actual fingers, but it’s soothing nonetheless.
Somewhere behind him Calliope chuckles and it shouldn’t turn him on so much, but it does.
When he’s in position Harry spreads his arse cheeks. His hole is hot and swollen, and despite his willingness to tease him even more, Harry can’t wait any longer. Draco’s still tight, but smooth enough to glide back in. He shudders when Harry hits his prostate, so he does it again. They fuck for a minute or two before Harry comes up with an idea.
Harry finally stops, but only because he is tired of the teasing. He’s eager for the next step, or steps, of their session. He gets up from his knees, picking up the leash that dangles forgotten from the collar. A slight tug signals Draco to get moving and, like the good sub that he is, he almost immediately begins to crawl forward.
“So,” Malfoy says, “Pansy and Finnigan?”
The question seems to come out of nowhere, as Draco turns to look at him for a second before he remembers their rules and lowers his gaze. It doesn’t go unnoticed, though.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asks, still not sure if what he sees is actually happening.
Draco does turn his head away, trying to hide his burning face, but Harry doesn’t let him. He lets go of one tit and forces him to face the masses. There’s one man who watches them with hawk’s eyes. He licks his lips when he notices their attention and raises his drink in a silent thanks for the show. Draco chokes on the gesture, his squirming intensifies.
Draco turns just in time to see Harry step forward, oblivious to the tomatoes rolling around, crushing one with a squishy sound, seeds, juice and pulp splattering everywhere. He looks confused, his eyes clearly asking why there are tomatoes on the floor, but it doesn’t help the mess that slowly conquers the formerly pristine kitchen.
They were lying in bed, exhausted after a day of intense play, sweaty and relaxed like never before. Draco was breathing heavily, having done most of the work, small rivulets of sweat running down his temple. He looked positively delicious and despite his bone deep satisfaction, Harry felt a faint stirring in his groin. How couldn’t he, with this naughty angel right beside him. He glanced at the endless legs, the concave belly, dusky nipples, the whole picture only slightly disturbed by a criss-cross of scars that he still couldn’t look at too long without feeling guilty.
“Draco, I want you to fuck yourself on my cock. Make it hard and move your hips.”
The way this day is going, he doesn't find more words to describe himself. Tall, huge, massive, long. Different, confused, frightened. Nothing makes sense anymore. Especially not the ring on his right thumb, gleaming in bright silver. There are faint lines on it, but in a language he can't read. He feels his emotions choking him at the sight, but he doesn't know why.
“This house is - was the hideout of a very dangerous necromancer. You and I, we work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, although we aren’t partners or even work for the same division. I am a Cursebreaker, you are an Auror. This necromancer was said to be the next Dark Lord, so everyone tried to catch him. Still took us six months to finally pinpoint his location. We followed him to this house. You and I, we wanted to wait for reinforcement, but Croaker, the Head of the Department of Mysteries, was adamant we go in immediately, arrest the necromancer and destroy any artifacts we could find. He pulled rank on us, so we had to obey him. We all knew it was a huge mistake, but he didn’t care. He just wanted to get one over Head Auror Robarts. They’re always fighting…
Over the years they explore more of the Muggle world. Paris, Venice, Rome, New York and one memorable night at the Forbidden City, and Harry will never admit out loud what they actually did there. There were quite a few things that were forbidden up until then, and they shattered a lot of inhibitions on top of the golden roofs.
It’s his insecurity that tells him he’s making a big mistake, that Harry would never appreciate a gift like this. The personal belongings of his parents will only be hurtful, never something he’ll be glad about. It’s causing Draco a headache, pondering about these things, but he has done it all now and he won’t back out. He isn’t a coward anymore.
“Don’t worry, Dragon, I made it easier for you. See, those are not our usual stairs. If you make it half-way up, I might even have a reward for you.”
Hours seem to pass by, and Malfoy doesn’t even twitch. It gets boring fast, with nothing to do. He’s surrounded by books, but can’t read. There’s a whole house to explore but he doesn’t want to leave Malfoy alone, a strange sense of duty is keeping him rooted. All he can do is watch the gnarled trees outside. There is no sun, only a homogenous grey sky, an ugly colour devoid of any nuances. There are no leaves flying around, although the trees are whipping in the wind. It’s oddly rhythmical, like the dance of damned souls, luring his mind away from the situation.
It’s a mistake.
“Harry, darling, do you want to try? Just to get a feel of the possibilities?”
The way Draco first kisses up and down the length, feathery soft, a teasing whisper of what’s to come. He knows the exact time he can spend on kissing before Harry becomes impatient, so he switches to kitten-licks that drive him even more crazy. And he’s fast about it. One second he laps blissfully at the precome on Harry’s tip, the next he mouths at his balls. It tickles a bit but the sensation oddly mixes with the surge of lust that runs through Harry’s veins.
Which is why Draco presses closer against him, trying to melt into Harry's embrace. They're sweaty and it's too hot to be pressed together like this, but only an emergency could make Harry abandon their bed now. He slowly strokes through the soft, white-blond strands, twirling them around his fingers.
A bell chimes somewhere in the back as he opens the door. Calliope has redecorated, again, and the walls are draped in red silk. The pillory in the corner, with its black wood, is a strong contrast, an immediate eyecatcher and he wonders how many of those she has sold since she made it the centerpiece of her shop.
It’s the very thing Harry has tried to avoid since waking up, comparing this reality with his meagre memories because he realises it’s impossible. Impossible to think about his life, of ten or more years, missing when he can’t remember graduating.
The voice in his head tells him it’s Malfoy’s blood, that he’s hurt and easy prey. Maybe not as satisfying as if he was uninjured, but enough to quench the bloodthirst that has built in Harry’s veins. His stomach turns in anticipation. With his added height and his bulky muscles he isn’t a weak, malnourished eleven-year-old but a serious predator.
Draco’s positively wild with lust, throwing his head around, his ponytail only held by willpower. Blond hair flows messily around his shoulders. In the hollow of his throat is a small pool of sweat.
“Draco,” he murmurs, before he leans down and captures the soft lips in a delicate kiss. It’s as much a part of their sessions as the collar or any other toy they use. It’s a reassurance for their love, a promise that no matter what is said and done, as soon as the session ends they are Harry and Draco again, devoted to each other.
“Shut up, Malfoy. I know you like all this sweet stuff and I’m pretty sure you don’t get it as much as you’d like. Merry Christmas… or something.” Harry steps out onto the streets of Hogsmeade, but he hears the silent “Thank you” nonetheless.
Like today. Draco is the only Healer experienced enough to treat the little girl that came onto the ward this morning. Her parents have taken care of her for a long time, but her condition unexpectedly turned worse and now her life is on knife’s edge. Nobody seems to know what spell hit her and reversing such a thing is almost impossible, but the parents were willing to try as soon as they realised their daughter would likely die without proper care.
There are many memories Harry treasures and likes to relive. They're a part of him, made him who he is, and while some of them are painful, most of them are good.
A loud gurgle breaks the silence. His hand comes up to his stomach and he realises he hasn’t eaten in forever. He can’t remember the last time, but it isn’t a surprise considering he also can’t remember growing up past his school days. Something catches his attention, an insistent blinking in the corner of his left eye, and he follows it to find a fully equipped kitchen. The blinking turns out to be an oven lamp, signaling that the baking is now done. It’s the same oven that Aunt Petunia has in her kitchen and it’s absolutely out of place. This house feels like a Wizarding place.
“I really need you to remember.”
Draco Malfoy sits there, nursing a tumbler of amber liquid on his own. He looks a little lost without his friends, but Harry has seen Blaise sitting with a group of Ravenclaws, and Pansy and Seamus aren’t even here today. Millicent and Hanna sit with Neville and Luna and some other students from different houses. If anything was achieved after the war, it’s house unity.
After a war memorial service, they stayed at Hogwarts, lingering on the Grounds, hidden by a series of Notice-Me-Nots and Muffliatos as Harry fucked every coherent thought out of Draco just behind Greenhouse 3. Clearly the Mandrakes were in the peak of their puberty because Harry could hear their excited chatter, some of them even cheering him on to go harder and faster. The isolated windows muffled their screams enough that they didn’t pass out, but their potent voices seemed to egg him on even more, making Harry weak in the knees and frantic with lust.
For now, Harry has planned to climb the Kilimanjaro. Draco was surprised by his plans, stating that it was equally impressing and stupid to go mountain climbing when one hadn’t ever done something like this before. Harry knows, but he sees the promise of the Veela whenever he comes home from his tiring training sessions and he knows the sex will be worth the effort.
He tries, but a yelp lets Harry know that the humbler does its work. Draco’s balls are pulled tightly away from his body, held in place by the humbler. Whenever he moves too much - and even the smallest movement is enough - his balls are pulled even farther away. It hurts, plain and simple, an ideal device to ensure only small movements and absolute obedience.
my dick’s itching like ants.’
Some decades ago they even tested it with twins, back when sick medical experiments were allowed and encouraged, and while they fit all criteria, they weren’t able to conceive, thank Merlin for that. It means that it’s more likely another Dark Lord rises, creates a horde of Horcruxes and claims immortality than finding a perfect pair.
Sometimes, on very, very rare occasions Harry records his own voice, telling stories about that one time a young Wizard and his friends broke into a bank and stole a special cup and fled on the back of a dragon. Draco was scandalised at first, protesting that they couldn’t tell children what happened in the war, but with a little help, the nasty reality was morphed into an exciting tale that was suited as a good night story.
For a long time all that is to hear are different moans of pleasure and pain along with the wet sounds of a sucking mouth and furious wanking. Just before he actually blows his load, Harry janks Draco’s face away from his arse, eliciting more pain from the humbler, but he can’t bring himself to care right now.
The silence between them is uncomfortable for the first time. Harry shuffles his trainers over the stony ground, willing Malfoy to say something, to set this right, whatever this is.
Draco’s eyes are screwed shut, giving himself over to the rough throat fucking and the pain like a good sub, and he can’t be any more beautiful than he is at this moment, when Harry comes with a strangled scream. His sub takes it all, panting harshly through his nose.
The headaches are slowly killing him, and it’s on a sunny Thursday when Draco realises it can’t go on like this. He’s barely functional. He can’t keep his eyes open, because the lights hurt him fiercely, aside from the fact that he barely sleeps these days. His hands shake and most days he’s just glad he isn’t a Muggle doctor and doesn’t have to give shots on a regular basis or perform surgery. His mood swings from sleep-deprived high-as-a-kite to a deep depression in the span of minutes, leaving his co-workers offended and his patients confused.
“Enough already, Draco! I know you Healers are stubborn and downright stupid, but I can’t stand and watch you destroy yourself over your stupid pride. I’ve had enough. I never thought I’d say these words, but I want you to listen to me and listen good. Either you seek help and allow me to actually be there for you, or you’re on your own. Do you know what it does to me when I have to watch you waste away? I barely recognise you anymore and we’re married for decades. Decades, Draco. And you just throw it away, being like this.”
The plans for the next Picnic start about twelve seconds after the last pie is consumed. The children bustle around while the adults slowly drift off into food coma, when somebody - usually Molly - will bring up an idea what to change next time. It can be anything: place, time, activities, food.
Harry smirks, does another round of laundry and heads to the kitchen. He has an appetite for some fried eggs and enough time to satisfy his urges. A self-inking quill is already waiting next to a fresh piece of parchment.
“I love you so much. Let’s go!”
Eventually, Draco pulls the dress up until his panties are revealed. Harry smirks - they’re the exact same colour as the dress with little rhinestones. His husband, the fashion queen.
What stands out is the blood and grime on his hands. He doesn’t feel hurt, just tired and a bit bruised, so it seems to be a valid question why there’s blood.
As Harry stands in front of his wardrobe, he ponders which coat he will wear today. It’s a quirk he won’t ever admit to, but he likes to choose the colour depending on his mood. Draco always tells him he has an atrocious fashion sense, and maybe he has, but Harry learned early how powerful colours could be to the mind. And despite having a husband worthy a supermodel, Draco never even notices that Harry is manipulating his moods with subtlety.
This year, they are very basic. While the food is on tables, everyone is seated on blankets in the grass, holding onto their plates or simply enjoying the sun.
“Tell me too,” Draco demands and Harry loves to comply.
“I know,” Malfoy sighs, a desperate and tired sound. “I’ll try to explain as much as I can, maybe it’ll help?”
Draco follows them to the centrepiece of the shop, that strange stand. Upon closer inspection, the leather looks extremely soft and inviting. It’s the highest quality someone could ask for, but it doesn’t surprise him. Everything in this shop is exquisite and expensive. He graciously kneels beside Harry as Calliope starts to explain.
There is a story there, but, even after countless years of being married, Harry and Draco have secrets. Nothing big or life-changing, they have a very open relationship, but small things. Like the reason Harry still carries Dumbledore’s Snitch around or Draco won’t tell him where he vanishes to every 2nd May from noon to six in the evening. There are couples that share everything, but they never felt the need.
Calliope is a Dominatrix who either can’t let go of the personality or won’t, and she has to dominate the room and her shop at all times. In one of their tea-and-buy sessions she has admitted to love the power she holds over her customers and Harry can understand and accept that. He knows the rush such power brings, the enticement of control.
The fit seems to last forever and ends rather abruptly with Malfoy collapsing on the floor, silent at last, but now convulsing and twitching. Harry drops his wand in shock, but at least he knows how to handle those kinds of situations: he can remember Muggle first aid just fine. Just in time, he turns Malfoy from his back to his side, grimacing when the git vomits all over himself and the floor. There’s only bile, at least, but it raises the question when he ate last. Harry still has half of the rolls in one of his robe pockets, maybe he should share them. He knows hunger intimately, knows how hard it can be to concentrate, to function, while your stomach cramps around emptiness for days. It’s nothing people should experience.
They’re both propped up in fancy garden chairs, courtesy of Draco, who insisted on making them as comfortable as possible. His husband is the biggest mother hen Harry knows, which says a lot, since Molly is serious competition to him, but, being a Healer, Draco knows all the horrible things that can possibly happen. Not that they will or ever did. It’s just extreme precaution that Draco can’t seem to let go.
There is the tree he and Ginny planted. They all had drawn lots with different “chores” which lead to a furious weekend of renovation works at the Burrow to surprise Arthur and Molly for their 25th wedding anniversary. Ron and Bill had to reroof the Burrow while Hermione and Fleur replastered the outer walls. Draco and George had lucked out and were responsible for the new coat of paint inside while Charlie and Angelina tidied the attic and made a new home for the family ghoul. Finally it was Harry and Ginny’s task to clean up the garden and add a few plants. Hence the tree that has grown magnificently ever since.
And it’s just so ridiculous, Harry laughs again. That’s a match he would’ve never thought possible, but somehow it still happened. Of all the couples around the castle they both seem like the most fake one, but also the most genuine one. It’s a strange contradiction, their relationship, but Harry’s the last one to judge. Not when he has his own secrets.
As far as information goes, it's absolutely useless, but he doesn't get more, because suddenly Malfoy starts to scream. At first, Harry thinks it's just for show, he knows Malfoy has a flair for the dramatic, but he soon realises it's completely different from the Buckbeak incident in third year. Back then the git had cried bloody murder, barely able to refrain from laughing between his fits.
To the third Christmas after the war. It was a quiet affair, even Celestina was pushed into the background. Still it was one of Harry’s best holidays. The sparkling eyes of Teddy reflected the fairy lights as his hair colour changed rapidly from red to green to blue to gold to silver and back again. He bounced happily on Draco’s lap, and Harry’s heart threatened to burst from all the love he felt at that moment.
His left hand fiddles with the ring on his right thumb. It’s made of silver, in a fashion that Harry wouldn’t willingly wear, but it has been there since he woke up, and he’s reluctant to take it off. It’s just a small movement in the corner of his eyes, but it’s enough to catch his attention. As Malfoy puts the cup away, Harry sees a copy of the ring on his right thumb, too.
It’s a mistake to open the door, but neither of them could have anticipated that. The door, sturdy, ebony wood, and copper hinges, makes an ominous, creaking sound before sucking them inward, trapping them inside. The darkness swallows them and fear is rising in Harry, reminding him of a cupboard long gone. He doesn’t know where up and down are, seemingly suspended in nothingness. He reaches out, trying to find something to hold onto, but there is nothing. Just darkness.
“Welcome back, Little Dragon,” a voice says, and despite the words, it’s cold and lifeless.
Another special thanks goes out to the husband (for the regulars: yes, we finally did it), who did his duty and played living puppet whenever I needed to check certain positions, hands and stuff. We both don't have any experience with very small breasts, so hopefully it's not too unrealistic.
Alas, if you want to leave it like this, this work stands alone and can be seen as 30 chapters of domestic fluff and a bit of angst that was even resolved. Or you can follow me and we'll explore what I have planned, even if I have to admit it is a bit of a cheap turn of events. ;)
It takes some time for Draco to come back enough to realise he needs to answer the question. But he isn’t capable of more than nodding frantically, constricting his own airway by pressing his throat against Harry’s firm hand.
He takes in the different ornaments, some are centuries old and some were only acquired over the last few years. There’s clutter everywhere, but they both agree they love it as tacky as it can get. An angel in a colourful crochet dress winks at him, wings flapping in excitement. The ornaments have seen their fair share of special traditions and are getting naughty themselves.
When he wants for Draco to take notice of him, Harry knows exactly how to get his attention. He just needs to dress nice, maybe arrange for a candle light dinner or a nice walk on the beach.
“Yes!”
“You have been disobedient. You were a raunchy dragon, weren’t you? You know not to move when you kneel by my side but you did. I have to say, you’ve been disobedient for some days now, mouthing off, not doing what I ask of you. There is a parcel right on the sideboard. I want you to bring it here. You will crawl there, so you can practice some more how an obedient slut behaves, but you may stand up before giving it to me.”
“No,” he says, shaking his head, his voice soft and understanding, like Harry’s question isn’t weak and childish. “It’s easy, like going to sleep after a long day.”
Harry’s right hand finally settles on his throat, above the leather collar, and he squeezes lightly, just enough to let Draco know who’s in charge of the situation. He’s practically melting into Harry’s broad chest, wishing they were alone and could explore the situation more. The discomfort from sitting on the horse is overshadowed by the rush of lust in his veins.
As it comes closer, Harry can make out its features. The wings catch his eyes and it’s not the dying sun colouring them golden, it’s their very own colour. They are big, bigger than a Hippogriff’s and rich like Harry would imagine an angel.
Finally, he allows the cage to open, and vanish, with a snap of his fingers. Immediately, there’s another spurt of precome and Draco swells to fullness. It’s impressive how fast he manages it, although Harry hasn’t expected anything less. Together, they manage to pull the panties down and Harry stows them in his pocket. He allows Draco to sit down again.
It makes him suspicious. Malfoy in general makes him suspicious (and he was right all those times before), and he thinks about refusing. Thinks about the wand in his hand. About the fact that he hasn’t seen a wand on Malfoy, who is weak and doesn’t seem to expect an attack. It would be really easy to overpower him. He actually looks quite pretty, in pain and bloody like he is now, Harry thinks, surprised at the thought, but not.
He knows it's because he's the Saviour and the Boy-Who-Lived-Too-Many-Times-To-Count, but also because of his own hubris. Just like Draco, Harry knows he's the best Auror, that most of the old stagers are either dead or finally retired and the new generation of Junior Aurors has grown up in a time when the last war is almost forgotten, only living in the stories of dinosaurs like him.
The piercing cry of a baby sends a jolt of fresh pain through his skull. The mother desperately tries to shush it, but the wailing only gets louder. Draco exchanges looks with Healer Neill and collects the file from Mediwitch Goldblum. The mother eyes him warily, obviously recognising who he is.
There have been many first steps, many first times and they mastered them. Still, Draco’s stomach flutters nervously as he nods, sensing Harry needs more confirmation than his weary eyes can give.
Harry snickers but refuses to rise to the bait. He knows it’s just friendly banter, but the idea to share it with Malfoy is equal parts intriguing and baffling.
Pansy sees him first. “You look like shit”, she says in a charming and warm way that all Slytherins seem to have in common.
And while the Veela still demands his attention from time to time, the hurt fades over the years, leaving him content, happily surrounded by his family.
After that, they continue to sit in silence. The day passes by, but neither of them realises just how much time passes.
“Tap it three times.”
Harry shudders. He isn’t easily fazed by dirt and finds it even comforting to know that he doesn’t have to clean up as soon as he sees a grain of dust, but this is too much, even for him.
“The Manor,” he gasps, regret and grief making his voice deep and rough.
“Dragon,” Harry says and has to try a few times to get Draco’s attention. He stops his thrusts when it’s obvious that Draco is too far gone.
Truthfully it will be a reward for Harry, but his sub is content to serve, so it may as well be for him.
It’s settled, then, no reason to delay the inevitable. The walk through the Forbidden Forest seems both to last forever and be the shortest walk Harry ever had. They don’t talk, don’t need to, because Harry feels their well-wishes in his very core. He’s brimming with their love, so full that all the bad thoughts leave his mind. When they breach the premise of Voldemort’s camp, he doesn’t feel the dementors. He slips through them, easy like breathing.
Draco swallows hard, not sure if he should believe what is happening. He’s wanted his nipples pierced for a long time, has talked about it at length, but somehow there was never the right time for it. And he’s old, forty isn’t just a number anymore. Maybe he’s too old for things like pierced nipples, but that doesn’t stop him from wanting. He can just imagine the delicate pain and shudders when he imagines Harry pulling on them. Thinks of a heavy chain connecting them, or weights that pull them down.
Are you ready? Read on your own risk, and please keep in mind that it's merely a bridge to the actual sequel that is going to come soon. I can't make promises when that'll be, but I made it my resolution to write more and I'll try to keep it ;)
They stayed for dinner, too weak to Apparate just then, and as they walked the school, they stopped to chat with some of the portraits. While Snape only huffed in disgust at seeing them before he vanished and refused to come back, Dumbledore clapped his hands in delight, chuckling and winking at Harry. He’d never been so embarrassed in his life, and he still wonders how Dumbledore could even know what they did.
Descending the stairs is hard since he has no feeling for heights, but he manages without an accident and only two almost-slips. As soon as his feet meet the rotten floorboards of the ground floor, he hears the voice calling for him again. It’s soft, maybe muffled, like the person wants to call him, but is afraid they are too loud. Why they would be afraid to call out for him, he doesn’t know. Despite the eerie feelings the house provokes, Harry hasn’t seen anything dangerous. He doesn’t know if that’s a good sign.
“Ha-harry?” he asks timidly, obviously noticing that something is wrong. There are many things wrong in this world, but Harry is about to rectify some of those things. He smiles at the cowering mess before his feet with as much kindness as he can muster, which is none.
“Of course,” Draco says, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, escorting his boyfriend into death. “I would have gone anywhere with you, Harry, forever.”
He opens the parcel still in Draco’s hands and carefully lifts the contents out of the box. He has inspected it in the shop with Calliope, so this is just for show. Draco isn’t allowed to look and his hands tremble slightly, even though the parcel isn’t heavy.
“Nothing important. I just thought about all the times I told people what I love about you.”
“Harry, please!”
He watches helplessly when the mother sneers at him, pulling her baby closer to her chest as if to protect it. His steps falter and he briefly wonders if he should argue with her. Draco knows it’s futile. Regardless what he says, it won’t make her change her mind.
The sterile smell of St. Mungo’s burns his nostrils, the soft beeping of monitoring spells fills his ears. His mind is flooded with memories.
He was just drifting off when he heard Draco, softly whispering: “I love you.”
He puts everything back into the box and stashes it under the kitchen sink - a place Harry will likely never see. Draco is pleased with himself and Hermione. They did the best they could and hopefully it will be a gift Harry loves.
Whenever ‘Uncle’ Draco keeps an eye on his nephews and nieces, he feels bittersweet happiness. The gleeful little faces and chubby hands, holding onto him so tightly he barely feels his fingers after a few minutes, remind him of he fact that he and Harry don’t have kids and most likely won’t have them.
"So, what went wrong?" Harry asks because it's obvious things don't go according to plan. Malfoy's injuries are a testament to that.
Sex is an important part of their relationship. Harry fondly remembers the times when they couldn't be bothered to leave the bedroom, content to be wrapped up in each other. Over the years those days got less, naturally, but they still try to find some alone time every now and then.
Once the vomit stops, Malfoy falls still. He’s still breathing, but it’s shallow. His face is a mess of grime, tracks of tears breaking thick lines of blood. He looks eerily young like this, eyes closed, his wrinkles smoothed by his unconsciousness. It’s odd to combine the memory of Malfoy in sixth year with this adult version. There are so many similarities, but so many differences, too.
It might not be Harry's own bed, but he isn't worried. Someone is calling him, the voice female and somehow familiar, but he can’t place it.
They eye each other for a moment, like old friends, before Harry nods again and walks over to the platform. He passes through the brick wall, but this time his hands are bare and he is alone. He doesn’t think he will need much where he’s going and he understands that some journeys must be taken alone, but he still wishes for company.
“It’s okay. No worries. Everything is fine, Harry, it’s all fine. No worries.”
The door falls closed behind them, shutting out the stress of the hospital for a few, precious minutes.
As he looks through his crimson robe, he finds a bundle with bread rolls, a lot of lint, and a handkerchief. It isn’t his, Harry is pretty sure, because the fabric is soft and stark white, embroidered with a stylised crest: the antlers of a stag encompass three long, colourful feathers. It’s a pity to use it, but it’s the only thing at hand.
While he needs a good twenty minutes and two different dictionaries, Harry is proud of the result. He imagines Draco reading the note, fuming with anger but secretly ridiculously pleased Harry would do this for him. He is almost sorry he can’t be here when Draco finds the parchment.
(See the end of the chapter for
He remembers everything.
He slowly pulls away, letting Draco sink back on all fours, before he stands and conjures a leather leash, matching the colour of the collar. He hooks it in the small silver-ring on the front and pulls gently, catching Draco’s attention through the haze of stimulation.
He buries his hands in Draco’s hair, not demanding but there, and a definite reminder to not play too long but get to business. Blowjobs are always spectacular to watch, but today is special. From this angle, Harry has the best view of his birthday present. The small breasts look ripe and swollen framed by the dress. They jiggle enticingly with every movement. It sets him on edge more than it should, but that’s exactly the fantasy he’s envisioned for years.
For now, however, Harry has slipped on his dominant personality, brooking no argument. And he wants to open his present, to unravel the delicious package and ravage the core. He frees the hands, Draco will need them soon.
It had been one of the most interesting if not saddest days of his life and it was the beginning of their relationship. It was soon after that Harry had to justify himself and his blossoming relationship with Draco for the first time.
There's no mirror in here, but Harry’s had enough of self-discovery for the moment, so he leaves without any more explorations. The light has changed since he left the bedroom and now he can see more details. The room is dusty and almost empty. There is only the bed and a nightstand, but no light. The window glass is tinted with grime. There are definitely no house elves here.
Fucking finally Draco takes him into his mouth, immediately starting the suction. It startles Harry into a deep moan, and he gets a cheeky look for his uncharacteristic sound. Which Draco is going to pay for later. For now, Harry lets him get away with it, too caught in the sensation of a skilled tongue lavishing his shaft. His glans is sensitive on the underside and it positively drives him mad when Draco uses the barest hint of teeth to tease him further. Tension is building deep inside his gut and it’s going to be a devastating orgasm once he finally reaches that peak.
“I know. Although nothing can mar the beauty that lies beneath, don’t you think?” His playful tone quickly falls flat again.
A deep rumble in his belly reminds Harry that he hasn’t eaten properly today, between a new case disrupting his Saturday morning and a long investigation in Cornwall there hadn’t been enough time for more than a hasty cup of tea. He winces when he hears a loud clang in the kitchen, the slight headache that accompanied him for most of the day suddenly getting stronger.
“Harry told me he wanted to give you something special for your birthday and told me about your wish to get your nipples pierced. While you both are in a safe, sane, and consensual relationship, this isn’t something we can do without your explicit consent and me explaining what it will entail. Please sit down and let’s talk.”
They don’t speak as they walk into the village, watching the few people that still have to get Christmas presents. Harry walks a tad faster than Malfoy, still unsure of what he should do, if they should talk of if he should just let it go. They have something nice between them, something he never thought possible. Can he really throw it away on some chance meeting?
After another speechless minute and a soft cough from his husband, Harry finally gets his bearings.
Sometimes he is embarrassed by how much he needs and craves this, how much he loves being at his husband’s mercy. That he gets off on pain and humiliation. He’s a slut for rough sex, for degradation or any form of debasement, and he’s the luckiest bloke alive to have a partner that is equally into those things, eager to explore the depth of perversion.
“I know, Babe, I know you’re sorry. It wasn’t your fault.”
The first step is always the hardest, Draco knows. It’s all those what-ifs keeping him from doing it. What if he does it wrong? What if he forgets something? What if he can’t do it at all? What if the others will laugh at him? What if…?
An angel guards the entrance of the graveyard. Despite their believe in superiority over the Muggles, the Malfoys are laid to rest under the watchful eyes of their symbols and Gods. Most of the headstones are withered, illegible with age and decay. So many generations of Malfoys rotting away, but Draco can’t offer them any consolation. He doesn’t care about those things anymore.
A shudder runs down his spine, although he can’t pinpoint a real reason for it. His head is a bit jumbled, a bit bruised, just like his body. There’s this itch, something that begs him to stop and see, but it’s muted and seems far away.
Draco still remembers all the lessons his mother drummed into him. Walking and standing, sitting and dancing, speaking and keeping quiet. Philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, rhetoric and poetry, but also astrology, proper manners, music and so many other things Draco didn’t care for nor ever needed in his life.
Harry manhandles Draco into standing, then presses him against the banister, lifting one leg.
“Why are you hurt and I’m not? I have a few bruises, I think, but you look… Malfoy, quite frankly, you look horrible!”
Needless to say that, while he wouldn't embarrass himself in front of all people by crying his eyes out, Draco soon excused himself from the mass of well wishers to quietly break down in a bathroom. Of course, Harry found him and that had been even more embarrassing than a crying fit in front of everyone.
The moan is louder, coming right from inside the door and Harry is pleased. He has been afraid the long hours he had to spend at the office would kill the mood, but apparently all is well. He just stands there for a few minutes, listening, going over his plan for the evening. Everything is prepared and he is ready to get this show on the road.
He knows it's normal, even for Veela mates, and he and Bill are in some kind of challenge who the bigger dork is when the allure gets too strong and they do stupid stuff.
My fiance changed the title to "Cocking Together" and was somewhat disappointed I wouldn't keep it. *smh* He's also the one who complains if I have too much smut in my work because he has to read it all...
On some days it’s incredibly hard. Sometimes Draco has to fight to keep it together for hours on end; when the pressure of society is crushing his spirit and making it almost impossible to do his job. A Healer needs to be strong for their patients, unwavering and willing to endure. He’s all that and more, but some days it all seems futile. When his every step is met with hatred and contempt, when doors are slammed in his face, sometimes quite literally.
It isn’t the right time of the year for a prolonged walk on the beach or visiting the zoo. Draco grows more desperate with every passing day and the headaches don’t help at all. It’s hard to think with the stress of work and the constant pain in his skull.
“It’s lovely of you to finally come to visit me. I’ve been dying to get your opinion on my new plaything,” she says, without greeting Draco and only meaning for Harry to hear.
The question is mumbled, much like Draco was already about to succumb to sleep but decided otherwise the last second. His voice is raspy, and Harry smirks. He did that.
Sorry for the non-existent smut, but if I would get started, you'd be easily reading 7k, which are a bit much for this ;)
“Just some ingredients for potions. Steph is a master at Herbology.” He waves his hand, like this explains everything. Maybe it does.
He leads them to a private entrance, guarded by a single wizard. It’s refreshing to be in a country where nobody knows him or Draco, so instead of gushing nonsense, the bloke only compliments him on his stunning wife.
His eyes turn forward, and he thinks he sees the people there, waiting for him, ready to put their arms around him and welcome him in their midst. He looks at Dumbledore, who is patiently waiting for his answer, calm and harmless.
“It’s alright, Harry, I’m not hiding anything, I promise.” And Harry believes him.
His good mood isn’t even soured when he messes his potion and it slowly burns a hole through his best jumper before he can get it off. The cauldron is lost, but thankfully someone reacts quickly and vanishes the mess before it can do more damage.
He remembers that day in their eight year, a stormy November morning. He walked the halls, still reeling under the PTSD from the war, feeling deeply wounded inside. Nobody seemed to understand him, seemed to acknowledge that fighting a madman since he was eleven, and dying in the end, even if he came back, had a lasting effect on one’s psyche. He tried to get better, even saw a Mind Healer regularly (they all did), but it wasn’t so easy, wasn’t over and done within weeks.
Sometimes they are bigger, like the black dragon hide boots Draco treasures with an insane amount of intensity. He vividly remembers the row they had about wearing boots in the house. Okay, maybe he’d been a bit obsessed with them.
“You’ll be with me the whole time?” Harry asks.
He’s fitted with a cock cage and his collar, completely naked while Harry carefully dresses in black trousers, a simple black jumper, and dragonhide boots before he pulls on his crimson Auror robes.
When they finally finish, Draco wipes a tear from the corner of his eye before he swipes his hand over the messed up kitchen, Vanishing the white mess, leaving behind the buggered mashed potatoes and the chicken, now nearly black. Dinner’s ruined and Draco sighs in defeat.
He tugs harder on the leash, wanting, needing to get started. Draco hates being led like a dog and Harry has dressed him up like one more than once, but today it’s just for the fun of it. He feels the reluctance in the way Draco moves, and as he looks down, he sees the blush covering the usually white neck. His dragon blushes so beautifully, not only do his cheeks heat up, but his whole upper body. It’s a nice contrast to his milky skin and even after all these years, Harry can’t get enough of it.
“Granger made these? It’s genius. No wonder we couldn’t catch Dumbledore’s Army,” Malfoy says, almost to himself. His fingers swipe over the letters, setting them all alight as a sign they are activated, before he does another round, turning them all off. “How do you send it?”
Draco crawls to the fireplace, too weak to stand properly and summons the Floo powder, silently thanking Merlin for not spilling it or accidentally setting the den on fire.
The content of the box is quite unspectacular. Some Muggle-photographs, a child’s ring with a big fake ruby, a mothy blanket, formerly a crass violet but now turned a soft lilac. An equally old stuffed lion and, curiously, a stuffed snake, entwined with the lion.
“What do you think?”
It’s even worth the barely veiled insults and surprisingly open threats.
His tongue spears Harry’s rim, dipping inside the tight muscle and it lights his prick on fire. He speeds up his wanking, wondering if he should shoot his load now, quickly realising that if it isn’t now, it will be a long time before he has the chance again. That’s not a reason to rush things, though.
He likes the way a selected bouquet can influence the outcome of a difficult meeting. When he first met the Weasley family after he became officially Harry’s boyfriend, he agonised over what to bring with him. He knew the Weasleys were still wary of him, and they had all the right to be, but he needed to make a good first impression as much as he could, what with tormenting their children for six years at school and being a war criminal and such.
“Yes, Sir.”
It isn’t unusual for wizards and witches to wait a few more years - decades - before procreating. It’s something they have to be sure about, and most people just want to live their life first before being responsible for a child.
“Please, Sir, please, let me come.”
Harry helps him straddle the thick cushion. Draco sees that the sides are slightly slanted, reducing the space to sit quite a bit. It’s not obvious on the first look that the sides slope down, but he realises why almost immediately. His centre is settled on a relatively narrow cushion, his weight pushing, his legs pulling him down. It gets uncomfortable rather quickly, although the horse doesn’t look like it. The leather is high quality, soft and warm under his fingers as he subtly tries to brace some of his weight on his arms to relieve his core. The longer he sits, the headier he feels. The magic of the wood slowly seeps into his clothes, igniting a spark. His cock stirs. Draco blushes and hopes nobody is paying any attention to him.
The water is cut off as Harry steps between him and the shower head to get wet. He reaches for the body wash, his eyes still fixed on Draco, and begins to soap himself up. When his hands reach his cock, Draco has to look. He licks his lips, watching a clever hand slick the hard member up, stroking up and down with deliberate motions. Harry doesn’t want to come yet, he just puts on a show for Draco, who is intrigued and at a loss what to do next. Does he want to watch or does he want to participate.
Calliope’s shop is one of a kind. It’s located in a back alley of Diagon and has a huge variety of products, both Muggle and wizard alike. There are normal spreader bars or those that can be manipulated with a simple spell. Crimson feather ticklers are in the same shelf as Quick-Tickling Quills, much like the Quick-Quotes Quills. They look for the best places to stimulate all on their own, while you still have both hands free to do something else. Their magic, however, fades quick enough, a lesson Harry and Draco learned after a weekend of fun that ended in an unforgettable laughing fit when the quill wouldn’t stop and had to be destroyed.
It takes some time before the words really hit him. Before he realises that Harry has had enough. That he wants to leave. Not because Draco is sick, but because he won’t let anybody help.
Nevertheless, Harry has learned to eat when the opportunity presents, so he carefully eases the tray with the freshly baked bread rolls out of its contraption and sets them on the table. A creek startles him badly, but when he turns it’s only the door of a cupboard, revealing an untouched jar of strawberry jam. He thinks about the possible consequences of eating strange food in a strange place, but his instincts don’t tell him that it’s a trap. They’ve been an invaluable help during the War, so Harry trusts his gut feeling more than anything else.
They don’t have time to do this very often. Harry is going to be the next Head Auror and Robards is keeping him busy every day and more nights than Draco cares for. While the Dark Lord was a prime example for a megalomaniac mad man, he wasn’t the first and certainly won’t be the last.
But he’s planned this evening almost a year in advance, found the perfect setting for tonight.
He remembers the delicately carved saltire she displayed last year, exquisite ebony and dragon leather, the leather rubbed with Appetentia for heightened pleasure, more intense orgasms. The potion is forbidden in Britain, but the saltire was made in Spain and it is not illegal to import products made with it. Calliope confided in him she made three years worth of rent just selling this.
The deafening clap of thunder interrupts Draco quite suddenly, but he isn’t ready to let it go so fast. Suddenly everything is clear in his mind. With a flick of his wrist he summons some pergament and a self-inking quill. Despite the hammering in his head the words flow out of him, filling page after page as time flies by.
The whole day has been about first steps, about rising upon their innermost doubts, beating insecurities, about showing the world they’re meant to be together. Everyone had been against them.
Despite all the magic in the world, it takes about a month for his nipples to heal properly. Draco is impatient, but he knows he can’t rush the process or it might take much longer. His nipples ache in just the right way, and the itch he’s feeling is purely sexual. He wants to test them, wants to play with them. They seem like the best decision he’s made in a long time - which is, of course, the reason that Harry has to go abroad on a mission just in time for the healing to be done.
It can’t be something as simple as going out for dinner. They do that often enough that it wouldn’t be special, and the restaurants they usually don’t visit are too expensive and Harry would never agree to that. Or enjoy eating there, for that matter. Despite Draco’s best efforts, his husband never liked the high society the Malfoy name can still give them access to, never liked the stiff and impersonal atmosphere of Michelin Guide restaurants.
Draco’s still wearing the black leather collar which is clearly out of place, but Hermione, of all people, helped him choose an appropriate neckband, although she’s asked a million questions why Harry would buy something designed for a woman. After tonight, he and Draco need to buy a dress that matches the neckband, so they can give it to her for Christmas.
Finally, Harry is allowed to see his birthday present. Without the dress, they seem bigger, but they’re still not much. Draco’s nipples are standing up, golden hoops glittering in the faint light. He pushes his chest up enticingly, and Harry doesn’t need more invitation.
While he walks back to Hogwarts, it never occurs to him that Malfoy openly admitted to being gay.
And he’s different. His feet look huge, his thighs oddly muscled. The black jumper he’s wearing stretches over his broad shoulders. He’s grown up but can’t remember anything past eighth year. The thought isn’t as disturbing as it should be. There’s a small voice in his head insisting he find out what’s wrong, but it’s very faint, and Harry doesn’t listen to the voices in his head on principle. It’s a lesson he’s learned.
Grey eyes snap up to him, but they’re not as sharp and calculating as Harry remembers. There’s pain there, making them dull and glazed over. It makes him ache in return, somewhere in a corner of his heart that he wants to rip out immediately after he registers it. It feels wrong to have this reaction to Draco Malfoy, but Harry can’t help it. The house is seriously messing with his mind.
“Wait. If you would remember your training, we could maybe try to get out. But without my wand and your knowledge, all we can do is wait. Granger and Weasley are out there, working on our rescue. Sometimes you can hear their voices calling for us, so hopefully it won’t be long before we’re free. If you’d remember anything, maybe we could help from this side, but the house is doing something to you, suppressing your memories.”
He strokes the sweat-soaked hair, love evident in every movement. It’s not uncommon for him to break character during their sessions for a minute or two, especially when he makes Draco suffer fiercely, but his dragon is always too far gone to notice. As soon as Draco overcomes his desperation, he slips back into his role as Dom.
There are boots on his feet, heavy and sturdy, shimmering in the pale light. Dragonhide, his mind supplies, but he doesn't know how he knows. He's wearing black jeans that fit surprisingly well. There is a hole in the knee, but it doesn't come from prolonged use. Except for the small rip, they are immaculate. His legs feel wrong, look wrong even, but he only understands when he stands up.
The Manor is dead, has been abandoned for years. Draco remembers the times when there were soirees, pompous balls and the occasional hunting parties. When the high society of the wizarding world would twist themselves into new and interesting shapes to get an invitation. Back when the Malfoy name meant something.
Decades after the war, years after he married Harry, the Ministry likes to remind Draco exactly what he did when he was a stupid and terrified teenager. He earned it, there is no question, but he knows it hurts Harry whenever his husband hears the snide comments and barely concealed insults and that’s why Draco hates going there.
Draco pets the snake’s head, finds the worn fabric surprisingly soft. One eye is missing, the other one replaced with a black button. The stitches are sloppy, obviously the work of a child, but it’s charming and Draco imagines a little girl with auburn hair, her emerald green eyes fixed on the needle. At the tail is a crooked “L” embroidered. Did Lily ever learn how to sew properly? Did it matter? Probably not. Lily Potter’s qualities, no matter what they would have been, can be summarised by a simple phrase: She saved Harry.
When he finally sits down in his favourite armchair and allows Draco to rest by his side, his patience is frayed thin but he has to withstand the temptation for a few minutes longer. His lover is not yet ready for the next step of their session. So he waits and watches.
He blushes when his stomach begins to growl loudly in the otherwise silent parlour.
Without a word he rushes to the bathroom, throwing himself down to hug cool porcelain, but all that happens is dry heaving and bad cramps in his stomach. At least the room is dark.
What makes him feel even better is that his husband, filthy rich since his birth, never judges him for it. Of course, Draco snorts when they tidy up the wardrobes, putting away the summer clothes to make room for their winter collection. He always looks at the three coats, still immaculate and slightly out of fashion, but despite all his snark, he never jokes about it. Their school days are long over and ever since it started, ever since they got to know each other so well, he refrains from teasing Harry for his misshapen childhood.
The Unforgivable is on his lips without thinking about it, as fury consumes him.
He still remembers Molly’s stunned expression, a tell-tale sign she knew how to read his present, but despite her short nod of acknowledgement, she hadn’t made it easy for Draco in the beginning.
When they started dating, Draco thought he needed to buy Harry’s affection. He isn’t proud of it and still cringes in embarrassment when he remembers some of the things he spent his money on. It had taken a stern lecture from Hermione to make him stop, and ever since, she is his confidant whenever he wants to give Harry something important.
The magic of flowers is very subtle, but even those who don’t know about it understand it to a certain extent. Back then, Draco had crafted a beautiful bouquet of asters, bluebells, irises and purple hyacinths. It’d been hard to come by all the different plants since it was in the middle of a particular cold winter, but he managed just in time. The flowers spoke the words he couldn’t voice. They spoke of love, asked for forgiveness for his sins, begged for friendship, expressed his hope for a new beginning.
It’s maybe selfish of him, but all his life he waited for something, somebody. He waited for somebody to save him from the Dursleys, he waited for something magical to happen. He waited for Quirrel to take the stone, for Sirius to take him home, waited to see Draco again, waited for Voldemort to finally kill him. This time, people are waiting for him. This time he can choose where or when he’s going.
It’s a tricky matter, tempting Draco to let go of his unyielding control over the creature. While the Veela is an inseparable part of him, he hates giving up his body. They never talk about why that is, but Harry knows it had been Voldemort who woke the Veela, and had even witnessed some of the things that had been done to Draco while being inside Voldemort’s head.
“Didn’t know you were such a jester, Malfoy,” he says, an indignant eyebrow raised. He almost regrets it, when he sees the light in Malfoy’s eyes go out and the slight smile fall flat.
For all of you who like to know the WHY?!:
I will post chapter two on Friday, July 31st.
In those ten minutes, Harry closes his eyes. He lets his mind wander.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts like a bitch, his muscles scream at him, his throat is parched. He’s not at home in his own bed, not at the Burrow or at Ron’s and Hermione’s, and it takes an embarrassingly long time to recognise his surroundings.
“Does it hurt? Dying?”
Sometimes Draco feels the sharp pang of longing. Before everything happened - before the war, before his creature was awoken, back when he barely hit puberty, his mother had filled his head with a fairytale. She told him that one day soon he would marry a nice pure-blood girl, and they would have an heir. Then he would be Lord of Malfoy Manor, surrounded by his children until they grew old enough to have kids on their own.
Later, in their bedroom, Harry shows him a case with seven unmarked flasks.
“Draco,” Harry commands, voice firm. “Look up!”
It’s Dumbledore’s voice, and the person looks like him, but for a split second Harry sees something else. A shadowy figure, draped in a dark cloak, looking unbelievable old and oddly kind. Just like the thought before, the image vanishes. He smiles as he sees his old mentor again.
With a hoarse scream, he passes out.
“H-here?” he asks, as if there’s any question about it. Another mark for tonight’s tally.
“Put me back in and then come sit with me,” Harry says, a bit kinder but not less demanding than before. Draco lets him go, giving his dick a cursory inspection for residual come, then puts him back inside his pants and trousers. He’s a bit shaky from kneeling too long, so Harry pulls him into his lap, for once nothing sexual on his mind.
Leave it to Ron to be equally insightful and oblivious. Like Harry doesn’t know it isn’t like sixth year, doesn’t know Malfoy just likes to spend time with him. Like Harry actually claimed that Malfoy is doing something sinister and Harry just keeps an eye on him. Like they both aren’t a bit lonely in this castle full of couples. So he just shrugs and proceeds to peel an orange.
They say that your wedding day is the best day of your life and Draco knows it's true.
It’s primal, raw, a Veela mating dance, without the finesse of a professional dancer, but even more intoxicating.
It’s out of the question to find a surrogate, even if they never talked about it. Draco wouldn’t be able to allow some woman to carry his or Harry’s child. There’s just too much that can go wrong when involving another person.
I was like "I want to do a reaaaally short one, because sometimes everything is said and done in a few words" and well, I think it fit perfectly.
Draco suddenly appears at his side and Harry’s voluntary solitude ends in the best possible way: with a kiss and the promise of more as soon as they are home.
“We’re still on for Saturday, aren’t we? Three o’clock at the gates?” Malfoy asks, trying to keep his voice normal, but Harry can hear the fear underneath, the insecurity.
His dragon shakes with pleasure, gooseflesh marking his perfect body. His hair is tousled, the perfect state destroyed by Harry’s eager fingers and the dampness of sweat. He’s breathing heavily and Harry can understand why: being pleasured for hours on end without rest can do that to you. He doesn’t have mercy, never has for things like this, and he knows Draco’s limits by heart.
“Well, I remembered how to transfigure something into a cup, but not much else. No.” Harry shakes his head.
“Make it good and I might even spare you the rest of the stairs,” Harry promises. It’s heady to feel every flinch, every soft puffed-moan against his sensitive skin. And Draco knows how to make it good, even if he is slightly incapacitated right now.
The path to his mother’s grave is still recognisable. Draco carelessly stomps on the weeds claiming the bare gravel. Winter will kill them all and he won’t be back before Christmas - why should he bother?
Somewhere a woman cries.
Working as a Healer, Draco has surrounded himself with flowers. His office looks like a tropical greenhouse: white-yellow plumeria and countless orchids, red poppies and white roses, all symbols of his work. Draco needs to surround himself in perfection and beauty, needs to remind himself of the sacrifices his job demands.
It makes Draco wish for another time, back when everything was fresh and exciting between them. Not that their relationship isn’t exciting now, but it was quite different back then. Every day had held a new discovery of themselves, now facets of Harry and things Draco hadn’t known about himself before he entered a relationship with somebody who really belonged to him.
It’s hard to let go of that delicious nipple, but just like the opera they’re nearing their grand finale, and there are still some things Harry wants to do.
Obediently his dragon lifts his eyes, settling them on Harry’s lips. He isn’t allowed to make eye-contact and it isn’t necessary. It doesn’t take long before he fixates on the humbler with a puzzled expression. So he hasn’t got a clue, which suits Harry just fine.
When he pulls forcefully on one of the hoops, Draco nearly shoots off his lap. His moan is hastily silenced by Harry’s hand. With the right stimulation, Draco could be so loud, even the passionate aria that is sung below wouldn’t be enough to drown out his pleasure. On a whim, Harry produces the panties from his pocket and wedges them between Draco’s lips. At least he can use both hands again.
It’s a short walk until he’s standing in a parlour. The room must have been a sight to behold in previous days, but it’s just as dismal as the hallway. The only interesting thing is fresh drops of blood leading him further on.
“I’m so sorry”, Draco whispered over and over again, broken by pitiful sobs.
The scenery on the stage has changed. The mountains and trees have vanished, instead, there is a rich bed chamber and a woman sings. It sounds imposing, powerful, but it’s certainly not Harry’s kind of music. He just waits to let the anticipation build and spends his time stealing glances at Draco.
He clears his throat when he stands in front of the table and sees Malfoy flinch. For a second he looks horrified, but he regains his composure soon enough and looks up at Harry.
“Settle down!” Harry demands, relishing in his sub when he goes still immediately.
(See the end of the chapter for
A few people greet Harry as he makes his way towards the east end, and he’s glad the hype about his person has died down, because he wouldn’t want to be seen going where he’s headed now. It’s a small alleyway, barely room for three shops per side, and it’s rarely frequented during the day, but that suits Harry just fine.
Harry holds his wrists together with his left hand, while his right begins to caress first his belly, then wanders up to his nipple. Draco wears a tight black t-shirt, something simple, but showing off his slim waist, defined chest and broad shoulders. His nipples both peak through the thin fabric and Harry doesn’t hesitate before he roughly twists one, eliciting a whine that Draco just can’t suppress. He feels himself blush furiously, but his cock is more than interested as it presses against the dark denim of his Muggle jeans.
Images flood his mind, coming and going fast, reminding him of the past three weeks. The first time they drank butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks, laughing about all the couples. The day they bought Harry new clothes and discussed Seeker’s gloves for nearly an hour. All the times they met in the halls between classes, greeting each other with a nod and a smile and a “Hey Potter!”. Malfoy’s undeniable joy at getting sweets. Hours in the library. Hermione smiling like she knows something he doesn’t. And suddenly Harry knows what she knows, probably has known from the first second. He likes Malfoy. Likes him a lot. Likes to spend time with him. Likes his smile and his sarcastic humour and his silent patience. Likes walking through the snow, watching fairy lights. Like a couple. He likes Draco Malfoy, is actually in love with him. And Malfoy is in love, too, he realises.
“Harry?” Malfoy’s voice is still broken, but stronger than before. It’s still nothing more than a whisper.
He knows he can cheer Draco up with his ridiculously orange and yellow sweater Dobby sent him for Christmas a few years ago. The bright red pompoms are ridiculous but they can crack a smile faster than any lame joke Harry could make. Or his emerald green vest, combined with the grey dress shirt with the burgundy hem will make Draco randy as fuck, barely able to hold himself back as long as they are in proper company.
Draco’s cock is red and wet and swollen. It looks good enough to eat, but this is about Harry, not his lusty dragon. He can finally fulfill his wish, though, and he doesn’t waste time and pushes both straps down Draco’s shoulder. They fall away easily and the dress slips down to his hips.
Calliope is waiting for them; they have a private session since neither of them wants anything of this in the Prophet. They don’t do this very often. Sometimes Harry just orders things by owl, but today they’re looking for something special.
It’s hard for Draco to accept that in some circles he’s just seen as an addendum. Nobody is disrespectful or rude, but there are rules that are followed to the “T”. It’s still strange and it doesn’t help that they agreed to all of it in the beginning and adjusted the rules over the years to both their liking.
He is suddenly bent over, a strong arm supporting his back and then Harry kisses him chastely, the solid press of dry lips against Draco’s own. It’s a promise for tonight, when they will be finally alone, but also for a future together.
His gaze wanders up, pleased to see the black leather collar. It had taken some time before they used it in their sessions, but now it’s an essential part of their playtime. He knows the collar is soft to the touch, nundu with polar fox lining, comfortable to be worn for hours. The row of silver buckles is charmed to only open at Harry’s will or in case of an emergency. It’s the most obvious claim of ownership and the primal part in him loves it nonetheless.
Draco looks at the table outside. Everything had been ready. Their best plates, their best silver, the napkin Grandma Black hated because they were made by Muggles but that Draco loves because they are the same colour as Harry’s eyes. The candle holder from Tesco, the only thing they possess that’s totally cheap but means a lot to them both.
It could be worse, Draco thinks. He takes two glasses and the bottle of wine, already open and utterly inappropriate for Indian food, and heads for the door.
When he went to Hogwarts those fantasies slowly faded into the background. Draco had a House to rule, top grades to get and a certain boy to harass. It all demanded his full attention and there was very rarely the right occasion to visit his old playgrounds.
Just when he wants to give up and curse his way through the walls - his
He suffers through those evenings, glad when they finally stayed long enough to alleviate Draco’s conscience, and gets home, emotionally exhausted and sometimes even physically injured. Alright, maybe he exaggerates a bit, but there had been one time, when Pansy had poked him with an actually hat needle (what is it with her obsession with hats) and he bled onto the white tablecloth. Needless to say Blaise made fun of him for that incident for the next three meetings.
Still, it’s the thoughtful things that get Draco every time. Like the snitch. During one of the many games in the orchard behind the Burrow, Draco finally managed the unthinkable - he caught the snitch before Harry could. He wanted to keep this memento but after the deafening cheers had died down it was nowhere to be found. Draco only saw it again at his wedding, when Harry put the ring on his finger. While it was the simple platinum band they agreed on, Draco's had rich golden ornaments and a small stone, equally golden. It was the snitch, worked into the metal in an intricate pattern that ultimately symbolised the wings. It was the inscription on the inside, however, that got to Draco “You caught my heart first”.
It only takes a short reply by owl and twenty minutes for Harry to rush to Draco’s side.
If he would give into his primal urges, he would barely be inside, his wings free and his mate always by his side. It’s almost worth it for the amount of time they would spend connected to each other, fucking like rabbits, only stopping to pop out one half-blood after the other.
The first thing he sees grinds his mind to halt, leaving him speechless. It’s a delicate ankle, wrapped in equally delicate black lace. It’s translucent, just hinting on the stocking, much more revealing than covering. Alabaster white skin shimmers through, and Harry unconsciously licks his lips at the sight. Draco wears black high heels with an ankle strap, and they make his feet look so elegant, you wouldn’t know that he’s usually a man with manly feet.
As it is, he is only here to pick up his order. Calliope was very helpful with deciding what to get this year and Harry looks forward to give it a go.
He finds everything else he needs- a plate and a knife - in another cupboard, and even a kettle and some tea. It isn’t much, but it makes for a good breakfast, and it doesn’t take long before half of the rolls are gone. The other half, Harry decides, will be kept for later. Merlin knows when there’s more food. A quick search of the kitchen reveals it to be empty of anything else. He leaves, his search for the owner of the voice now pressing in his mind.
He knows that Draco has been taking the potions dutifully, but he could have never imagined the result would look like this. Instead of being flat-chested, his husband now has small breasts. Barely enough to fill half his hand, just the hint of a swell, but they’re there.
Slowly recognition seeps into the flat gaze. Malfoy tries to get up from the floor several times but then just sinks back against the couch. His palms leave bloody fingerprints on the wooden floor, but he never takes his eyes off Harry. Like he’s afraid Harry might vanish if he looks away for the barest second. Finally, he stops his struggles and just sits there, shoulders slumped, posture defeated.
They both love to have sex in strange places. Their first 'special' sex had been fairly normal. It was at night on a park bench near Buckingham Palace. After the most intense orgasm of his life so far, Harry had confessed that the hottest thing hadn’t been Draco riding him to oblivion, but the fact that they could have been caught any time. The way Draco’s cock twitched at the notion was all Harry needed to confirm that they had the same fantasies.
As he enters the Three Broomsticks, he brushes the snow from his cap, quickly vanishing it before it can fall onto the ground. Rosmerta is a fierce lady and Harry doesn’t want to tempt fate by disobeying her rules.
A strap of the leather harness prevents the plug from falling out and it obscenely dents when the plug goes back only to plunge back in a second later. Another moan goes straight to Harry’s groin and he feels himself harden. The feeling is familiar, the anticipation rising, but he denies himself for just a few more minutes.
It’s more of a frantic rutting for a while, just the tight drag of Draco’s channel against Harry’s overheated cock, animalistic and simple, yet satisfying. Draco’s breasts bounce around enticingly, and when Harry leans down to get one of them into his mouth, he sees something familiar in the corner of his eyes. He lifts his head, searching - and sure enough, the man from before has his eyes on them again. Suddenly it’s perfect.
“That’s nice,” Harry says and finally gathers enough strength to move on. He doesn’t feel brave, doesn’t feel like a hero, and he thinks again of lambs and slaughter. Multiple hands hold him: Draco has slipped his hand into Harry’s left, his father has his hand on his left shoulder. Sirius holds tight onto the right one.
His gaze never leaves Draco, not when he pulls off his socks and especially not when he steps out of his pants. Draco swallows with effort, his mouth suddenly dry. His body is reacting like they are still eighteen and not thirty one, his hard-on quick and surprisingly persistent. Sex wasn’t on his agenda, but Draco won’t complain.
The kinky days are indescribable.
is famously strong - they open up to something that seems to be an entrance hall. He’s on top of an impressive staircase that leads down to the ground storey. He sees a huge window that reaches from the bottom to right under the ceiling, equally grimy, but still good enough to see through.
Draco tries to wriggle out of them without much success, although not for lack of trying. The dress interferes with his jerky movements.
It’s hard to have the Saviour of the Wizarding World as your husband, when you yourself are a low-life Death Eater with a Dark Mark to show. To this day there are still speculations if their marriage is just part of an elaborate scheme and that, maybe, he controls Harry’s mind with the Imperius Curse, nevermind that they’re married for decades and not even the Dark Lord could cast a spell strong enough to hold a single person for this long. Certainly Draco couldn’t. He’s good with any kind of spell, strong and able, but he could never muster enough meaning to make his Cruciatus Curse work, and he certainly was too weak-minded to control somebody.
It always annoyed Draco, the constant noise in the background of his life, but he couldn’t resent Harry’s passion when he only just learned to life after his own rules. It took some time, but eventually he got used to it, and even developed his own taste.
Calliope was delighted when he told her what he wanted to try. She has some experience and she readily described it in vivid pictures, all the pleasure that could be found using a humbler on a sub. Harry can see the appeal now as Draco tries to limit his movements, panting harshly against the pain, but the rosy colour of his arousal hasn’t abated much. He’s a slut for pain in the right dosage, just like Harry is eager to deliver it.
Room 4 is the smallest one, more of a broom closet than anything else. It’s so small it doesn’t even have a charmed window. Except for some cupboards and a cot it’s empty.
The room before him is dark, but in the silence of the house every harsh breath and whimper is amplified. Harry has finally found his target. The solid layer of dust makes him almost silent as he approaches, wand at ready. He’s contemplating which hex to use first. There are some deliciously wicked. Curses that peel away parts of the skin - not enough to incapacitate someone but painful enough to make them suffer. Hexes that slash only a few layers of skin and flesh but leave important blood vessels intact. The Cruciatus Curse, basic but effective. He could simply conjure a knife and do everything with his bare hands in any case.
While he’d been tending to Malfoy, he tried to remember anything, but there is a huge blank space in his mind. Between a winter’s day at Hogwarts and now seem to be some ten-odd years, maybe more, but whenever he tries to recall something from his past, Harry’s brain starts to itch in a very uncomfortable way, getting unbearably stronger until he stops thinking, stops trying.
Despite all the extravaganzas that happened over the years, Harry likes the simple ones. He is the happiest when they all meet at the Burrow and enjoy Molly’s home-cooked meat pies and the best treacle tart on Earth.
“I’m sure he is, but you might have noticed that Longbottom and I aren’t on the best of terms. You know, with me bullying him and mocking his parents and all.”
“I guess I am. Although I can’t remember since when you’d call me Harry. Or the actual year. Or anything else,” he says snidely, waiting for a melodramatic fit. Hopes for it, really, because it would be the only normal thing he’s encountered all day.
A door creaks ominously, revealing a bathroom. As he gets up, everything feels odd for a moment, but he can’t see why, and he doesn’t linger on the thought. Although he realises now that he isn’t in any dorm, isn’t sure if he’s even at Hogwarts, he isn’t worried.
Harry notices they’re both wearing basically the same clothes, a black jumper, black jeans, and dragonhide boots. There’s probably a crimson robe somewhere around here, too. It’s his first question.
Over the course of the next hour they talk about everything and nothing: her plans for the summer; Harry’s receipt for strawberry-cheesecake-cream filled eclairs; her preference of erumpent skin-made switches over normal leather because it stings so good; before she hands over the long, narrow, brown parcel with Harry’s order over, wishing him a happy birthday and closes the shop up right after his arse is out in the alley.
Over the years they got tamer, less reckless. They still try to have an active sex life, but with Draco’s headaches getting worse, they hardly get the chance to explore that particular kink. Still, vanilla sex is better than no sex, and given their explosive history, it’s always wild, sweaty and mind-blowing.
“Won’t the others not be suspicious if they see us hanging out?” Harry doesn’t really mind what they will think, but maybe Malfoy does.
He likes the weight of the knife in his hand and decides that it’s the perfect tool to teach an unforgettable lesson about loyalty and treachery and that one doesn’t fuck with the Chosen One and his loved ones.
He remembers the War and all the trauma it caused, but it feels equally long ago and recent. He remembers the decaying body of Voldemort, crumbling into a pile of stinking skin and bones after the magic that held it together was gone. He remembers the stomach-turning stench, the disgusting colours. But his memory is muted, dim, like an old Muggle film in sepia. He can’t tell if he was alone or surrounded by people or even where he was when it happened.
“Is it really you, Harry?” he asks. His voice is rough and cracks at the name.
They exchanged the same words over and over again before Draco calmed down enough to finally fall asleep again.
Harry knows he’s extremely lucky to have found a kindred spirit in his husband. Not many couples are this happy and content in their relationship, but somehow they manage to click in all the right places.
Draco complies without a hitch, taking over the movements. He uses his arms for leverage and pulls away before snapping his hips hard and going back down, taking Harry in as far as he can. He stays there for a second, clearly enjoying the fullness before he picks up again.
“And new jeans and shoes. And if you’re already there, maybe a whole new set of jumpers and trousers - not those atrocious denim abominations.” Malfoy puts his wand away and ticks his fingers as if making a list.
He hasn’t seen the frozen puddle underneath his feet and the abrupt motion makes him slip. He throws his arms up, uselessly grabbing at the air, and then hands are on him, trying to prevent his fall. It’s useless, though, and both he and Malfoy crash down. Harry lands hard on his back, Malfoy above him. As he opens his eyes, the glimmer of the fairy lights above catches in Malfoy’s hair, red and green and, again, perfect. Harry wants to touch it because it looks like spun gold. He sees something else, though, something leafy and green.
It went all well until one day Harry asked him, why he didn’t write his stories down. They were fantastic and he was sure Draco would be able to pull of an amazing story, since writing wasn’t that hard. But he couldn’t. It didn’t feel right to express his silly ideas, make them real on paper. It was nice of Harry to indulge him, to support this childish pipe dream. As soon as the suggestion was out there, Draco found all the reasons why it was a bad thing to try and write about his fantasies.
He turns to the mantle, where he’s put the long, thin box with the neckband not moments ago. It was his only stop between getting back from his mission and coming home.
“Since you’ve been a naughty boy, I decided to take you down a notch or two. Your constant nagging and violent fits don’t suit a good sub and I think this might be a good outlet for all that anger and frustration in you. It’s called a humbler and you will get real close with it tonight. Maybe after some quality time you will calm down a bit. If not, we can always play with it again. Let me show you how it’s used.”
Smiling to himself Harry watches his family. Draco is still mothering the girls and won’t be approachable until he runs out of things to do, so Harry roams the large garden behind the house. He delights in the few minutes he has to himself - alone but not abandoned.
Draco licks at Harry’s crack like he’s dying for a taste, wet and thorough, alternating it with kitten licks around the rim, teasing and barely there. It’s the only form of power he has over Harry and he revels in it for as long as he is allowed. Usually, Harry will take over and point that clever tongue in the right direction, but not today.
Draco is on edge when he gets up from the wet tiles. Harry barely has to touch him before he pants and comes.
“Harry!”
Music never has been important in Draco’s life. His parents never allowed him time for such a useless hobby, and of course it was strictly forbidden to create any disturbance with something so common as the wireless.
There once is a rooftop party in Kensington, and having sex around the homes of the Royal Family is a theme they follow for some time. After that it’s public buildings and Harry is overly proud of their wild night on the roof of Big Ben’s tower. Not that he could bragg about it: despite their mutual fondness of defiling each other in public, Draco is very closed off around their friends.
Her voice is soft as she caresses the plain black surface. Her eyes travel over the horse, before landing on Draco. He lowers his gaze immediately, just in case. He isn’t forbidden to look, but he doesn’t want to risk bad behaviour when they’re out. He sees her smirk out of the corner of his eyes but keeps his head down.
Harry cards his hands through Draco’s hair, slow and soft as not to wake him. They’re watching Star Wars - Draco’s choice, because he is fascinated with the concept of traveling through space. Despite his obvious interest it took all of thirty minutes before his eyes closed and the soft, regular puffs of breath tell Harry that his husband is asleep.
Diagon Alley is unsurprisingly empty. In contrast to Muggles, Wizards hate the oppressing summer heat and many shops are already closed up for the day. Flourish and Blotts is dark, as well as the branch of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes since George and Ron have decided to take some time off to be with their families. Eeylops is still open due to the fact that the owls need to be fed daily anyway, so they keep it open throughout the whole year. Gringotts, of course, never closes - the Goblins hate the summer since everyone gets lazy in the sunshine, but closing up equals lost money, and this, the Goblins despise even more.
“Nice of you to finally show up, Potter!”
Most of the time Harry starts with heated gazes, but always when Draco is slightly distracted. His subconscious will see them, but he won’t be tempted to act on the promise of hot sex that Harry gives him. It’s not for him, anyway, but for the creature that always watches its mate.
Her voice is cheerful and smoky, so sexy it makes shivers run down his spine. It’s her special kind of magic - she can make the knees of any gender, and orientation, weak, wake desire where there should be none. Desire sparks through Harry, makes his stomach flutter and he feels a bit guilty that he has this kind of reaction. But that is just Calliope and she has this effect on everybody.
It’s a sign of their deep devotion, of the love between them, that they still are together, dealing with their issues, and still are willing to put up with each other’s bullshit, knowing full well that despite the endless talks, nothing will change. Bad habits, small or with capital B and H, will always be a part of their relationship, but Harry and Draco have found a way to live with them. And love with them.
After getting ready to work and doing the laundry just like Draco asked, he sets to leave his own note.
“Huh.”
“There’s a fat chance that won’t happen. It’s not like I’m not trying, you know?!”
“Remus, your son…” He chokes, unable to say more. But Lupin just smiles, the same that everyone else has given him, without lingering resentment that he is alive while they’re not. He only sees love, no matter who he looks at.
It can’t be too expensive, Harry is very adamant about such things. But it mustn’t be cheap either, since what’s left of the Malfoy pride refuses to have an anniversary with cheap Tesco wine and chocolate.
Draco’s eyes glow with elation. Harry would like to ravish him right here at their table, but it’s not the time yet. Soon, though. He smiles when Captain Sullivan signals him that they’re about to dock in a few minutes. Time to get this show on the road.
Also, I'm interested in a long term beta reader, if one of you is interested. ;) Until the next time!
Nevertheless he has no choice in the matter, so he pulls his best robes from the closet, midnight blue with small silver stars, and goes through the motions he learned at the tender age of four. Brushing his teeth and his hair, taking a nail file to clean the ragged spikes he calls nails before applying clear nail varnish, making a mess out of things just like three decades ago. He gave up on immaculate beauty around the same time that the Dark Lord burned his Mark into his arm. He likes fashionable clothes and a nice cut, but that’s the end of it.
There is nothing worse for Draco than boredom. When he was a child everything that he might have enjoyed was quickly forbidden and he vividly remembers the hours he spent in his father’s study, getting lectured on proper behaviour for a Malfoy. Whenever he had time to do what he wanted - riding his training broom through the narrow halls of the Manor, playing hide and seek with the House Elves or simply reading a book that had a different topic than history - his father would soon put an end to it, dragging him off to the study for some ‘quality time’ between father and son.
Before the evening is over, the only moans he will hear are ones of exhaustion and he likes both equally fine. But he knows his lover needs a bit of comfort right now. It isn’t easy to lie on the floor for hours, sexually frustrated, being kept in the game with no possibility of relief.
“You’re welcome, Potter,” comes from behind him, and he slowly turns to see Malfoy with his wand pointing at the now cleared working station. He smiles at Harry, but it’s small and soft and he doesn’t think anyone else except him sees it. Which is fine, because since when does Malfoy smile?
Draco’s panting harshly by the time they stop, his desire fueled by passionate kisses and the plug still working his hole. Harry hears it vibrate, feels the shudder wracking the slender body in his arms and he doesn’t want to wait any longer.
“Why are we wearing the same clothes?”
George showing off the crater of his ear, waving around painful memories of Fred to guilt him into breaking up. Harry is still furious with him, despite many apologies and years behind them.
In the end it isn’t a hard decision. Harry had a painful life, although not all times were bad. But he’s had enough of longing for people that are long gone, for giving and rarely receiving in return.
“Why would I think that?” Harry asks. His eyebrow is still raised and he finally understands why Malfoy uses it to underline his sarcastic statements or disbelief.
They weathered many storms together to be were they are now. Which changes nothing of the fact that Draco is alone in the shower wanting nothing more than Harry to be there with him.
Some chapters were reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally hard to write, and others.... were not. This one came to me when I was at work, thinking what on Merlin's Earth I could write for this topic (and another chapter, maybe I'll remember which). Anyway, this is what came out of it ;)
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco remembers their first date - not the fancy restaurant they both hated or the paparazzi following them, demanding to know what the Saviour was doing with a disgusting Death Eater, but their chance meeting at Battersea Park in the wee hours of morning.
It should end with his shrug, but Ron still has something to say.
He can see the annoyed eye roll, hear the pained sigh. His husband, for all that he is a romantic sap and a cuddle monster, hates corny professions of love - or nicknames. ‘Babe’ is the only one Harry can get away with, at least sometimes. Anything else Draco will protest faster than Harry can finish saying them. He remembers an epic argument at the end of their second year as a couple, when he wouldn’t stop calling Draco ‘Honey’.
He reaches the stairs long before his dragon and checks for the adjustments. Instead of their normal staircase, there are many more, albeit flatter, steps; the staircase magically expanded to accommodate the changes.
Draco picks up the parcel, carefully like it’s a delicate glass figurine or a century old heirloom. He comes to a halt in front of Harry, sinking immediately to his knees, holding out the parcel like a tribute to an angry god. He knows he’s in for a rough time and he already tries to placate Harry, to appease the sadist in him. Too bad it’s too late for it. And even if Draco could do something to make it better, Harry has planned this for quite some time now. He will follow through with it, good behaviour notwithstanding.
He should see something, shouldn’t he? Is he too late? Too early? Why doesn’t he see something?
Exhaustion is pulling Harry down into its abyss, now that everyone is safe and they’re back at the Ministry, and the weight of the boy is getting heavier with every passing minute. It was a horrible week and an even more horrible day and if he could just rest for a minute, that would be enough to pull through the next hours.
The snitch opens at the press of his lips, just like Harry thought it would. Inside is a familiar ring, small and almost unremarkable if not for the deep gauge left by the sword. The third Hallow, completing the collection and making Harry the Master of Death.
The words are harsh, hurtful. If he had the strength to flinch, he would have done so, but as it is, Draco can only watch his husband running down the hallway. It’s been so long, he doesn’t even remember when he’d seen Harry this angry. Maybe never. But he stays silent, doesn’t know what to say when faced with those accusations. Those threats.
Draco takes Harry’s hand in his, and they kiss, slow and chaste, for the first time in a very long time. They hold hands as they board the train, a journey they can finally make together.
Every day, he takes ten minutes for himself. Draco knows this and even helps him find the time, if life gets too stressful.
This time Draco doesn’t hesitate at all, practically flying from his seat to kneel between Harry’s legs. Sure hands open his fly and it’s so good to be finally free of the confines of the trousers. Harry leans back in his seat. There are mountains on the stage again and the feather bloke is back, but it’s all just background noise to him.
The room is dark, only small stripes of led-lights (and that Draco knows and recognises them says a lot) illuminate the small paths, and bright spotlights highlight the displayed goods.
Harry can see how desperate he is, his dick hard and dripping onto the stairs, flushed red with need. They long since abandoned cock rings, as Draco has learned to never come without permission, and it must be quite urgent for him to speak up now. He’s probably seconds away from coming.
Malfoy tries to get up, scrambles to get up, but there’s no way to escape, not with his extensive injuries and a very agile, very non-injured Harry ready to hunt him down.
Small nicks are littering Malfoy’s body soon enough. They paint a fascinating pattern across his chest and down his arms. Harry pays special attention to the hand-shaped bruises on Malfoy’s hips, tracing them with the tip of the knife for a lasting image.
“You’re still wearing your cock cage, are you?”
Harry doesn’t realise the day turns into night, hypnotised by swinging branches and Malfoy’s steady breathing beside him.
He chuckles darkly, and Harry doesn’t follow the thought. They both haven’t mentioned the war and it’s better to let the topic sleep, anyway. Better not to wake those horrid memories. Harry isn’t even sure if Malfoy knows he was connected to Voldemort and saw everything.
He is just about to add the powdered sugar when two strong arms close around his chest. Draco flinches - Harry is stealthy as a cat when he wants to - and firmly squeezes the package. The sugar scatters in all directions, painting them both white, mixing with the mashed potatoes but, thank Merlin, doesn’t get near the chicken. Draco looks dumbstruck, his mouth opening and closing like a fish, as laughter booms behind him.
“I want to go to Spinwitches,” Harry says. Usually he has to wait for a long while before Ron allows him to drag him there after a visit. Malfoy merely shrugs, a small smile tugging at his pale lips, and says “Sure.”
Malfoy only shrugs, so Harry takes it as permission and pulls out a chair. With his back to the room and the table tucked away in a corner, he momentarily feels like he is alone with Malfoy, far away from the rush of the crowd and the pressure of life. Then somebody stumbles against his chair, interrupting his thoughts and the sounds of the pub come buzzingly back to his awareness. It’s odd, but he doesn’t comment on it.
“Shit, I’m sorry Malfoy. D’you hear me? I don’t know why I did that, I’m sorry.”
“Shall I put the horse on your shopping list then?”
A clammy hand grabs his, strong and sure, but obviously just as nervous as he is. He looks at Harry, their eyes meeting in silent agreement.
Now I wanted to use this work to introduce it to a longer universe with Veela!Draco and Auror!Harry. If you're still interested, you should read the secret chapter 31. I wanted to include it in this chapter, but the finace was heavily protesting, stating he found that idea stupid and dumb and he was enraged beyond measure I would use such a 'cheap trick' on my readers.
The song gets louder, more intense and now he sees something - someone - rise from the closed treeline and he is momentarily blinded by the last remains of the sun. The creature is illuminated by a golden halo, majestic and breathtakingly beautiful. Harry longs to touch it, wants to give all his love and compassion to it and never let go.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Draco remembers the day he found out Harry had a disgusting addiction to cinnamon in his coffee and the awkwardness that ensued after the “confession”. Or that one time Draco was so deep in thought that he unexpectedly meowed, and Harry replied, equally confused and intrigued.
Sirius gives him a smile. He looks younger, more content than ever. He looks like moments before he fell through the veil, strong, powerful, capable. So full of himself and of life.
They finally finish looking for clothes and Harry chooses a warm jumper to wear since the one he came in with is really pathetic. When he compares it with all the stuff they just bought, it’s obvious even to him. Malfoy is right, somehow. He’s Harry Potter, he’s a public person. Even if he doesn’t like fancy clothes, his hand-me-downs are embarrassing. But he has money now. He actually can afford new clothes every now and then.
Do you know how hard it is working with my fiance? He messes with the words on purpose, because he thinks he's so funny (he is -.-). And then I have to correct it and it's soooo hard.
Draco remembers the endless fights. Opposite sides in a war that took too much from them, winner or loser, it didn’t matter. Fighting against feelings he didn’t want to admit even to himself, fighting the growing attraction. Fighting to be accepted by the two most important people in Harry’s life, closely followed by fierce confrontations with his family.
Harry watches as he stops mid-movement, recognising the mistake he just made. He’s well aware every movement will hurt, but if he wants to go anywhere, Draco needs to make very, very small moves. He learns that lesson quickly, as he shuffles behind Harry, stopping every so often to relieve his bollocks. Harry gladly gives him the time, because he knows Draco hasn’t thought about the struggle that is waiting for him, and he waits with anticipation for the moment he realises that their bedroom is on the second floor and he will have to climb the stairs in this state.
He pulls the quilt higher, wrapping it around them like a cocoon and sighs in contentment. He tries to keep his eyes open, but they won’t obey him.
Malfoy’s face is relaxed, a ray of light hitting his face just right (how does he do it?), so his skin looks like it glows from within, white and pale and perfect. Harry swallows the lump that suddenly clogs his throat and dumps the rest of the rejects into Malfoys open hand. He watches avidly as Malfoy eats one after another in rapid succession, like once he has started, he can’t stop. Soon his hand is empty and when he opens his eyes, he looks almost disappointed that there isn’t more. He suddenly becomes aware of Harry staring at him.  He’s blushing - and Harry has never seen that before. Not like this. He’s used to Malfoy getting red in the face in anger and outrage, ugly splotches on his cheeks, but this is different. It’s eerily soft, but it suits him. It’s like Malfoy is now: a bit subdued, not obtrusive and fighting for attention.
Finally at home, Draco saw Harry’s stag waiting, telling him he would be alone for the rest of the day after an important case had come up. He doesn’t like to be alone, especially not after those demanding days at work, but there isn’t much he can do. Except have a shower to get rid of the hospital stench.
“For free. They melt every heart, trust me.” She winks at him, but he isn’t exactly sure why. Malfoy’s waiting for him by the door, his hands thankfully empty. He looks surprised when Harry dumps everything on him.
He’d been in a relationship once that was so point- and loveless, that he was tempted to cheat on said poor sod, and even if he didn’t do it, he came close to do so.
Okay, maybe he slightly exaggerated, since Harry has it worse than him, but deep down Draco is still a selfish bastard and he really hates those fancy-schmancy evenings when people look at Harry like he hung the moon and the stars (which he absolutely deserves) and look at Draco like he is the vilest creature that ever crawled out of the sewers (which he also deserves).
He goes over to Calliope, greeting her and exchanging pleasantries. His gaze never leaves Draco, noticing his every move and, more importantly, waiting and watching what will catch his husband’s attention. He’s always subtle, only hidden glances and inconspicuously coming back to the same shelf over and over again.
Lately he discovered the healing power music has. It helps keeping his patients calm, and some even show improved stats. The few children on the ward enjoy the audiobooks he brings them. They’re mostly Muggle fairy tales, but the Wizarding world caught up over the years and there are the stories of Beedle the Bard and Marvin Miggs, too.
As a small consolation I will be posting 4 chapters, so I hope your forgive me and/or direct your anger and resentment at the fiance.
“I want you to take this potion while I’m gone. It shouldn’t take longer than a week, so I left you seven doses. There are instructions inside the box. I want you to read them and decide if you are willing to take them. When I’m back I’m going to take you out. That is not dependent on you taking the potions, but it will be more fun if you do.”
Or when he chews on his lips, sucking the lower one in between his teeth and then letting it go, again and again. It’s just a cute, adorable bad habit until he’s done it so often, so intense that the lip begins to bleed. Then it’s a Bad Habit.
Although some memories are bad, the good ones outweigh them by far. It’s enough to fuel an army of Patroni. And it’s necessary doing the job he does.
That’s an odd statement, but Harry complies without questioning it, at least for now.
They join Calliope at a small table that is cluttered with legal forms and various kinds of jewelry.
Did you see what I did there?
“Aguamenti!”
It took an hour to regain his composure and explain the whole thing to his boyfriend. Orange lilies symbolise hatred and the withered flower clearly indicated that the former hate Molly Weasley felt for him, had slowly died, just like the lily.
Why is he here? Where is he? And Merlin's bullocks, who is he?
Harry can't help the bright grin on his face. It’s absolutely ridiculous and the more he thinks about it, the funnier it gets: His big, bad Veela-husband, the incarnation of sex and passion, turns scarlet the second they enter the sex shop.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s one of Harry’s secret kinks finally coming true. He’s never wished for a wife, never had the urge to sleep with a woman once he discovered his taste for blokes, but he’s always fantasised about mixing both. There’s something naughty, something salacious about a man with breasts. It’s making him hot and bothered for reasons he can’t explain.
The day he met Draco again was the first day of spring, the first day the sky over London cleared up that year. The first day of the rest of his life, so to speak.
Just as he steps outside, he feels a miniscule twinge in the back of his mind. It barely lasts a second and as he sits down, waiting for Harry to join him, it’s already forgotten.
Sure enough, when he wakes up a the next morning, the bed is cold again, but another note is waiting for him.
Tonight isn’t about extreme pain, but Draco doesn’t know that. Harry knows he loves this kind of insecurity; it gives him a thrill.
The neckband fits like a second skin. It’s the same midnight blue collar with little diamonds. When he’s done, he lifts Draco up and steps back to take it all in once more.
Draco whines pathetically at the stimulation, but he keeps still like he’s supposed to. Harry has his Dragon tamed very well.
Minutes might pass, or hours, but it doesn’t matter to Draco as he relaxes for the first time today.
First the air was filled with flying cups, plates and Grandma Weasley’s ugly gnome figurine, then clothes flew everywhere.
Malfoy is rambling, his eyes blank as he stares ahead from his prone position on the floor. Harry is at a loss on how to help him. He’s looking for something useful, like how to perform first aid in a situation like this, but except for
It’s not like he doesn’t want to get over it, but he can’t. All this blood still stains his hands and Draco doesn’t think he can ever wash it away. Harry tries to assure him that he paid his dues, that the way he helps people now makes up for his mistakes. That he was just a child and couldn’t have done anything to prevent what happened.
It’s when he sees the creature more often looking back at him that he knows it’s waiting for his bold declaration of devotion and strength. Whatever it is the next time.
Harry saunters over, finally having had enough of just looking. He needs to touch, to taste and devour and he can’t wait any longer. He reaches out, barely touching the blond strands, just enough to let his present know that he is there. He strokes up and down, slowly increasing the pressure and it isn’t long before his fingertips gently scratch and massage. The moan comes again, now with a note of comfort and Harry savours it.
“Cooking dinner, I’d say. Draco called to cancel our date, so we decided to make an exception this month, come by and cook dinner.” Pansy sets the spoon down to grab a glass of rich red wine, expertly inhaling the bouquet. It’s a good vintage, that much Harry can see, even if he still doesn’t understand anything about wine, much to everyone’s disappointment.
Ron and Hermione are long gone when Draco yawns and stretches his arms, the picture of a graceful if lazy cat. They are still on the sofa in the sitting room; Harry hasn’t dared to move, content with watching his husband’s slumber.
Once they had an amazing Picnic in the middle of the night, while the Leonids showered them with wishes. Harry rarely experienced such a beautiful night. The downside, however, was soon clear. Every parent complained about hyperactive kids. Since they were awake at night, their sleeping schedules were completely off and according to Fleur and Hermione it took the better of two weeks to get back to normal.
It’s an ongoing argument between them, those Bad Habits. Harry hates Draco’s, Draco hates his, and so they go in circles again and again.
Malfoy looks at him then, letting his hands fall down, horrified: “Merlin Potter, you look like a heathen! Or like, stuck in Muggle America! You are a public person, you need to maintain a certain standard. Think about what Rita Skeeter would say!” He opens his eyes wide in sarcastic outrage.
“Please, Sir,” he whimpers, not that Harry could be convinced by that - and they both know it. They’re just the most coherent words he’s capable of right now. Harry strokes him torturously slow, never enough to satisfy.
They soon decide to spent the last weekend before the break in Hogsmeade, again. Harry thinks it’s nice that they both stay over the Holidays, since the castle will be nearly empty. They won’t need to find excuses for why they spend so much time together. Ron still thinks Harry thinks Malfoy is up to something. He spends every breakfast pointing out how nice Malfoy has been in the last months, how he doesn’t pick fights anymore, and that this is evidence enough that something's wrong. Hermione, in turn, doesn’t say a thing, but she looks at Harry in a way that tells him she knows something he doesn’t. It isn’t her usual know-it-all look, but something softer. Sometimes she looks at him, snorts and shakes her head, like he’s the biggest idiot in the room, which is a feat considering they’re in the Great Hall.
He nearly gets sick again when a door is thrown open and it crashes against a wall. The pain is consuming his thoughts, so Draco is surprised when Harry is suddenly in front of him, talking and gesturing furiously. The words don’t reach his addled brain immediately, but when he finally can make sense of them, he gets sick again.
It comes as a total surprise when the boy is lifted from his arm and given to another of Draco’s colleagues. Harry blinks, having missed the last few minutes and he’s suddenly alone with Draco. He tries to sort his thoughts, to maybe say something, but nothing will come out of his exhausted mind.
“Kind of stupid how this turned out, huh, Potter,” Draco says, but his voice is soft and melodic, and even his sneer has no edge.
“You think you have it bad, try listening to Seamus composing poems for her.
He feels lonely some days. It isn’t like he’s dependent on Harry, Draco is perfectly capable of living his life on his own. He just doesn’t want to. Harry is the balm that soothes his soul - or something equally corny. It’s true, though.
Draco is fucking his tongue in and out of Harry’s hole, moaning from more than just pain. His hands spread Harry’s arse cheeks even more and he dives in, sealing his lips around the rim, sucking wetly. He alternates his licks and his sucking in a steady rhythm, driving Harry slowly insane. When he starts nibbling, Harry can’t hold back anymore and starts moaning alongside his dragon.
At Hogwarts it was much of the same. Scheming Slytherins didn’t have much time to sit down and enjoy Celestina Warbeck, or whatever other nonsense was on.
Milo is clinging to Harry’s neck, refusing to let go, and he hasn’t felt his left hand for some minutes now, as Mila has it in a powerful grip. They are just two of five children they rescued from a cult of necromancers, willing to sacrifice them on the upcoming Solstice ĺnight.
Harry's birthday is about a week away and Draco is slightly panicked. He’s been thinking about the gift for a very long time and has driven himself into a tie between smug satisfaction that his gift will be the best Harry will ever get, and paralysing terror that it will be a huge mistake. This isn't helped by the fact that Hermione is equally unsure and delighted by the idea.
