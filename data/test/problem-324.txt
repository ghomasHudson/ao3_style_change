“Like you can do better?”
Harry quietly sang a couple of lines from a muggle song that he had heard when he was younger, “Like a river flows, surely to the sea Darling, so it goes, some things are meant to be. Take my hand- Take my whole life too- For I can't help falling in love with you.” He set a flower crown on Draco’s head and looked at him. Draco looked content, and with the last bit of sunlight quieting, he looked quite- well- beautiful.
“Where are we going?” Draco asked, a small smile plastered over his face.
“Draco-”
“I need something simple, understated, but could brighten a room at the slightest hint of light.”
Draco felt completely sick when he had been asked to use the unforgivables. How could he? They were innocent people. They had lived, probably families, loved ones. None of them deserved to die. None. And he couldn't cast the spells anyway, he didn't-
Summer nights in Northern Ireland, from when he was little. Mother and father… when they were still happy. It was a long time ago.
Draco smiled, "I guess we have."
“Yet. We haven’t yet.” Harry gave him an accusatory look and Draco booped his nose, making Harry go cross-eyed. “Merde, Tu es tellement stupide. Mais Je t'aime.” Harry had no idea what he just said, but he smiled regardless.
“S’okay ‘Mione.”
mean it.
As Harry walked out of the fire and dusted himself off, Hermione made a pot of tea. “So… did you find a ring?”
“How do I know you won’t step on my feet?”
“Ah- You filthy little-” She chuckled, shaking her head.#
Still young, still recovering, they spent most of their time together- at home, at muggle movie theaters, restaurants… you name it. But after three years of it, you can understand when someones ready and sure on their feet.
and then,
“We could eat at home or we could go to Fortescue’s?”
Harry sighed and scourgified the ring. “Shut up and look at it.” He handed it to her.
. He was fighting. And he someone to fight for, someone other than his best friends, someone he loved and loved him in return. It felt
“What was implied?” A voice said from the fireplace. Harry looked up, it was Hermione.
“You don’t, but I think the risk will be worth it.”
“I think I have something…” The jeweler walked to the back of the shop, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts. Five minutes later, she came back with possibly the most Draco-like ring Harry had seen in the last three shops he had been to.
“I’m not the only one.”
“Did you know that The Beatles used the word ‘love’ 613 times in all of their songs?” Harry ignored Draco’s comment.
“I don’t know French.”
They walked a bit more, hand in hand, feeling the wind and enjoying the cool air. Then they came upon Harry’s setup, which included a bouquet of daisies, crocuses, jasmine, and purple peonies, a woven picnic basket, and a bottle of rose cider. Draco stared at the sight, and the ring started burning holes in his pocket.
It took him almost the entire year to show up. Draco was furious and relieved to see him. They couldn’t talk to each other much, personally. Not in front of everyone, but when Harry had appeared through the portrait in the hideout others-mostly Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaws- it was okay. They had talked for a couple of moments and Draco had surprised Harry by hugging him before they all had to leave. Draco cried that night. Harry was there for one day, gone the next. They would see each other soon enough, though, if not too soon.
“What? I don’t!”
“You’re insufferable.”
Everything after that was a blur, a mess of this and that, of death and guilt. They were all walking towards the entrance. The death eaters were there. Voldemort was there. Hagrid was there. Hagrid was holding Harry. Harry wasn’t moving. Harry was pale. Out of life. Harry was gone. It was silent, so very silent. The only break they got was when Ginny Weasley pushed her way up to the front. “No! NO!” She wasn’t the only one who felt any remaining strands of hope, of light, disappear. “Just because Harry’s gone, doesn’t mean he’s left us! He's with us! In our hearts, in our memories. And YOU! He’s still with you, Voldemort. I’m not afraid of you!” Neville was holding the sorting hat, he reached in, and out came the sword of Gryffindor. He swung it around and held it pointed at Voldemort, who laughed. “You think a sword can stop me! Ha! Foolish child, just like your parents. I’m your leader now, Harry Potter is DEAD! So come forth and bow to me! The most powerful wizard in the world!”
“Unreal… like it’s too perfect to be real… but it is- real. Almost like running on clouds or walking on water.”
“Shut up.” Harry playfully shoved Draco to the ground and sat down beside him. He pulled out the silverware, set out the tea sandwiches and croissants, and poured them each a glass of cider. After a while of eating, Harry reached in the basket, pulled out a radio, and tuned it to a station with slow music.
“Well, you could’ve just summoned it, or put out the fire, but that works, too.”
“Really? Can I see it?”
Harry stood up and set his hand out to Draco. “Dance?”
"I don't know, Draco. It'll take a long, long time for everything to be okay, and I doubt anything will ever be normal, ever again. Not that it ever was," Harry traced shapes and random lines up and down Draco's arm and across his back. "Once, I thought that I'd never, ever, see what the real world was like, or have friends, let alone a boyfriend. I thought the only place I would ever be able to go, was a cupboard. Sometimes I wish I could go back there. It's, er, hard to understand, because the people I was with were abusive, but, it was a safe place. I could think about what living was actually like.
“So…” Ron clapped his hands together. “Who tops?”
“Exactly.”
“Mhmm… sure you did.”
Draco saw Harry when he and Ginny were kissing. Hell, he was close enough to hear Ginny say, “I just had to do that once.” Harry looked dumbfounded, Draco felt betrayed. He turned around and ran as fast as he could. He ran past people dueling, he ran past Severus, he ran from it all. He ran to the forbidden forest, he ran and ran and ran. He ran until he felt like he was on fire, or maybe he felt ice cold. He didn’t know.
He rolled out of Hagrid’s arms. Everything seemed to be in slow-motion. Draco grabbed his mother's wand from his pocket. “POTTER!” He threw it. Harry caught it. He caught it and ran. He ran before anyone could move. Not that anyone would or could move. Draco watched after him. Not with awe, as most everyone else, but with hope and discontent.
“Yes, indeed. I am absolutely and entirely a talking chair,” the voice said in an extremely high-pitched mocking voice. Draco, startled, looked beside him to see Harry wearing baggy worn blue jeans, a tee, and a grey light-weight jacket.
Harry hadn’t any idea when or how they ended up half an inch apart in the forest (the one strictly banned to all students) or how they had not yet noticed the increasing chill in the air. Possibly, it was because the heat was radiating between them, maybe it was because they didn’t care, because they were so, so, close that ghosts of warm breaths were shadowing their faces. When they had noticed, it was Draco who stumbled away, screamed, ran, who had left Harry alone, with no knowledge of how to protect himself against the hooded thing, but a simple, most likely ineffective, disarming charm. Yeah, he was mad, and he wouldn't have lived if it hadn’t been for the centaurs.
She looked thoughtful for a moment, then asked, “What would you do if it meant he was safe and happy?”
do to the others."
They finished their food and sat back-to-back, looking at the clouds as they passed. Draco realized that now would be the perfect time to propose. Harry was thinking the same, the sky was turning a darker blue but the sun was just above the horizon, setting off a gentle light and causing a ripple of different colors flowing out above them. They both simultaneously pulled their rings out of their pockets, without knowing they were in sync.
"No, Weasley, I won't. In case you didn't notice, Harry just
Harry was high on adrenalin, the air whipping in his ears, stinging his scar, his legs growing tired but not noticing because he was
Draco raised his left eyebrow in suspicion and curiosity, but he listened. Five minutes later he was wearing black jeans, a tee, and a charcoal-colored jacket. I should grab the ring now, in case the time comes, Draco thought. He picked the ring up and flicked in the air, catching it smoothly.
“Alright you two, I’m going to stop by mums, be back in a few hours,” Draco said as he slipped out the door, leaving Harry no chance to answer.
After:
“Oh, that wasn’t a joke?” Draco replied.
“This place,” he walked into taller grass while Harry watched him. “It reminds me of... home. I mean, not the manor. A place we'd occasionally go in the summer. Before Hogwarts,” he looked at Harry, “Before you.” At this moment, Draco didn’t feel grounded, warm, cold. He felt, he felt like he was running, but not running at all. “Do you ever feel like-” Draco whispered. “Like you're running, but never really running, just the out of breath feel, but not? Like you’ve run your whole life and then, it just stops, you stop. And everything is just, floating…”
“It’s funny, no one would buy it!” The jeweler exclaimed.
“Where did that come from?” Harry questioned. When Draco looked at him to answer, the late-day sun was causing a glow behind Harry and made his eyes glow dark green. The rims of his dorky glasses shone in the light.
“I do, and it’s a good thing you don’t.”
“I despise jeans…” Draco mumbled, standing right next to Harry.
“Julia. Julia Evans. Now go!” And with that, Harry turned around and walked out of the shop.
“Ehm…” Hermione cleared her throat.
Harry bit his lip, a memory- though not his- triggered, reminding him of a man he was not always fond of, but knew that in the end loved him. “Always,” and smiled at the jeweler. “Thank you. And, I never quite caught your name.”
and tapped it twice to make sure it was there, and he wasn’t going crazy.
“Harry, mate, that was bloody brilliant.”
“Right on then. I’ll floo back and see you in about 5 minutes?”
He did it. He won. It didn’t feel like it, but he had. He had defeated Voldemort.
“Love, the truest and most important love, is worth more than any amount of gold, silver, life, death, money- could ever buy. And that,” she put the ring in the box, “is why you will take this ring,” bagging the box, she continued, “and only if you are 100% sure that he is the one,” she shoved the bag in his hand and took a deep breath to hurriedly spout the last bit, “give it to him, not to show how much you love him in objects, but to show that you will stay by his side and love him for who he is, till death do you part.” She took a step back and brushed herself off from her previous stance, which would be leaning over the counter and pointing her finger into Harry’s chest.
They had both been to a mind healer, some appointments were together. Most of the time they spent together was after a really bad night.
“Are you okay?” Harry shook his head, sobbing. Draco pulled him in and let Harry bury himself in his chest. Draco held on tightly, it hurt to see Harry the way he had been- no longer laughing, smiling- he looked no longer like the boy who could cause mischief in the blink of an eye without realizing it. He was no longer the boy who snuck around in halls at night, who could laugh at the Weasley twins' new tricks. And perhaps he wasn't- perhaps they weren't those people anymore- but it was okay. Harry lifted his head after who-knows-how-long and kissed him softly.
things not to her but me and everyone important to me," he gestured to Harry, "also. Not to mention what they
Hermione rolled her eyes and grinned but took the ring. “Oh, my- Harry. It’s beautiful!”
“Oh, so it’s my stupid face that made you facepalm?”
“Harry! You did it! It’s over. He’s… gone...” Hermione became less confident in her voice as she looked at Harry. Draco remembered vividly what had happened. Hermione and Ron ran after Harry. Harry who had just killed someone. Guilt consumed him. He drowned in it. He fell to his knees. He curled up in a ball, wanting the Earth to swallow him. “Harry. Are you okay?”
“Fine, I’ll come through, watch out.” Hermione stepped away from her fireplace while Harry grabbed a handful of Floo powder and called out the address.
Draco knew he was thinking about all the people they had lost, and yeah, it was a lot. Everyone knew that. He couldn’t lie, they lost good people. Remus, Tonks, Fred… he could go on. “Harry, look at me.” Draco didn’t know what he was going to say, and instead opened and closed his mouth trying to figure it out. Harry squinted at him and grinned. “What?”
someone. Even if that someone was a secluded, evil, plotting, maniac, that tortured and killed muggles and muggle-borns and made others squibs for fun," Draco snapped. "He may be your friend, but he's
"You mean
“Ron!”
“I wasn’t talking about Malfoys, Draco, I was talking about you,” Harry drawled. Draco leaned forward and gave Harry a chaste kiss. “What was that for?”
"I meant, what happens when you kill V-Voldemort-"
And then they landed themselves in detention together.
he stood for a moment more, watching. He solemnly walked up to Voldemort and was greeted in a most unpleasant hug. It was cold. Draco felt cold, empty, heartless. He wasn’t whole. He had never been whole. Not without Harry. Harry made him whole. He never had a home. Hogwarts became his home. Then it was Harry. Harry was his home. Have you ever felt so low, so lonely, that even just someone saying hi to you, can make your day? Draco had felt the exact opposite of that. He had felt happy, and peaceful, content. But now he felt torn and numb like his soul was torn into so many different corners and only left him enough to live. But he put on a mask, one that he had spent so long forming, the mask that he had only let fall in front of so many people.
“Harry, It’s fine.” Hermione put her hand on Harry’s shoulder. “When are you proposing?”
“Oh, before I forget Harry, I found the thing you asked for…” Hermione pulled out a few items from the other side of the sofa she was sitting on. The items included consisted of: An oak picnic basket, a light lavender-and-white checkered picnic blanket, and plain white plates with matching cups.
"What happens when the war is over?"
“You sure took your time leaving, even though I was late.”
“Then this one is on me.”
“What’s that?” Harry questioned. “You don’t usually forget anything.” He slightly teased.
“I know! And it’s so Draco, too!”
“I mean it, otherwise I’m going to have to tackle and kiss you.”
“Nope. Here,” Harry handed him a bag that looked like it had clothes in it. “Put them on and then meet me in the garden.”
Goyle was the one to start the fiendfyre. Harry was the one who saved him. Draco held on so tight it hurt. Ron had saved Blaise. Harry flew them out, landed, and immediately turned to Draco and kissed him. It was goodbye, perhaps forever, and they both knew it. It was a passionate kiss, fueled by hate and love, sorrow and joy, it was both hello and goodbye. Ron flew out with Blaise as they parted. Draco was surprised that no one had noticed by then, except for Hermione, but Draco had had the feeling that she'd known for a while. Before Harry flew off to the forest, and Ron flew with Hermione to kill the last Horcrux, Harry’s voice was filled with regret as he said, “I love you,” and kissed Draco one last time.
He was at the manor. He was there. In front of him. In front of his Aunt Bella, his mother, his father, Greyback… “Call him! Draco! Call him!” He hadn’t got the chance before Bellatrix was grabbing the back of his neck and forcing him down on his knees, snapping his head forward, in front of the three captures. None of which looked healthy, or well, at all. He didn’t identify them. How could he? But that had only meant that when they had found that it
“Thank you, Hermione. I just knew that these would be hard to find and I don't have anything at home and-”
“Yes! It’s PERFECT!”
“Really?”
Draco didn’t seem fazed by it at all… in fact, he smiled gently, and opened his eyes to look directly into gentle, and bold, green ones. Taking a breath he said, “It’s funny…”
“Hm… and it’s your stupid face that’s making me do this,” Harry turned and grabbed Draco’s face and kissed him softly, but using his magic he sent a whirlwind of strength, warmth, and as much love as he could before pulling away and resting his forehead against Draco’s. “I can’t help falling in love with you,” Draco smiled gently and rubbed noses with Harry.
"That's not what I meant, not entirely."
“What are you- leave him alone!”
“I never said you did. I merely said I’m not the only person in existence that has a dark and fairly odd sense of what is funny to them.”
Draco smiled and his eyes crinkled (though he would deny that later, for no particular reason). Harry folded his hands behind his fiance's neck and pulled him in for another kiss.
? What happens to us?"
They met in Madam Malkins, briefly, before Draco was called by his mother. Harry stared into his intriguing grey eyes. Draco stared into Harry’s marvelously green eyes. They reminded him of someone, sometime, before he could remember barely anything. They had not asked one another’s name, but they were instantly connected, even if Harry had thought that the kid was a prick. Draco had had a similar thought himself.
Ron still looked opposed to the idea but flushed and backed off. Draco sat down next to Harry and set a hand softly on his back. “Harry.” Harry looked up at him. His face was wet. Draco wiped away the tears with his thumbs.
“I didn’t know you danced, Potter.”
“You two do know there are other people here, right?” Hermione gushed.
"And I wasn't alone, I had toys and my imagination. When I was little and couldn't do any magic, or it was easily covered, Dudley used to play with me, but then my magic started growing stronger, so Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had to make it stop." Draco let Harry talk, he knew by now that it was what he needed to do. Plus, on occasion, it was nice to just listen to Harry's voice, even if he was talking about unhappy memories or bad days that he'd had. Draco found it helped him, too.
“Draco, We haven’t even-”
long.
Harry realized he was staring and turned red, “Nothing, just... you.”
When Draco “came out”, his father banned him from going anywhere with anyone and therefore locked in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor for the entire summer. After all, in his father's eyes, Draco was made to be the father of the next Malfoy heirs. This meant that he would date a girl, he would marry her, and he would have children, whether he liked it or not. Harry was, when he eventually “came out”, showered in love and support from everyone. Mrs. Weasley had knitted him a rainbow clad scarf and a jumper that included a bunch of different colored snitches that he wore everywhere.
“Oh hey, ’Mione. Nothing.”
Harry hummed and contemplated for a beat. “I mean, yeah. But…”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
," Harry interupted.
“I know.”
Draco, lo and behold him, had lost the coin when his father- quite literally- threw him in the dungeons. He had been through multiple crucio’s in a week, he couldn’t move. After the crucio’s stopped, he was starved. At least I can move, was his only thought. One day, after an ever-so-sparse meal that his mother had begged his father to give him, he sat up, and still recovering from the weeks of crucio, crawled over to where a shred of light was hitting something and bouncing into his eye. He picked it up, the coin, he remembered. It felt warm in his hand. Comfortable. He gently whispered,
Neville's expression was a mixture of alarm and amusement. "A snake?" he guessed.
"Alright," Harry agreed. He was looking forward to seeing his friends again, although he was torn between anger at their silence and delight at rejoining them. "Who else is here?"
and had married a
"Wow," Hermione breathed. "This is
a cobra hissed worriedly. Several snakes chorused in agreement. They pointed their tails towards the back of the store. Harry maneuvered between cages until he found himself in front of a small terrarium with a very small, shiny snake.
"I defeated Voldemort-" Harry ignored the flinches "-three times, not including the time when I was a year old, because my mother did everything. A clause in all of the founders' lordships is that if you defeat them three times, you take the founder lordship, as well as any other lordship they have. That's how I got the Peverell lordship, too."
As he thought about the message, another house popped up between numbers eleven and thirteen. A huge black manor with a blood-red door and a demonic doorknocker had just appeared out of nowhere.
"Heiress Bones is her niece, and only living relative."
read, but you were a child. Albus, as your magical guardian, was given control over your properties and whatever else you inherited. Although, he wasn't at the will reading, so I don't know if he's aware of that..."
As he spoke, Harry realized that several of them applied to him. They'd started after the graveyard.
He barely caught a glimpse of an elegant room before he heard a shriek and someone attacked him. He immediately registered Hermione's bushy hair and hugged her back.
"What's your Patronus, boy?" Moody growled. "And how could you not be using your magic!"
Iris bounced a little on his shoulders.
Dobby squealed.
"Don't lie," Dudley laughed. "I heard you! 'Draco, oh, don't stop-' 'Malfoy that's so sweet-'"
Harry lifted his right hand and pointed to each ring as he said them. "Most Honorable and Ancient House of Gryffindor, Most Honorable and Ancient House of Slytherin, Most Honorable and Ancient House of Peverell, Most Honorable and Ancient House of Canavas, Most Ancient House of Potter, and Most Honorable and Ancient House of Merlin."
"By all means," Harry agreed. Vic sat down and waved a hand.
"Sirius is innocent," Harry said firmly. "Peter Pettigrew-"
"Dobby, I know you're used to being treated horribly, and are really happy at how kindly I'm treating you. I know you're not used to being given a choice with every order, and being allowed to decline orders you can't physically do. But I need you to act with decorum and grace. I can't have you sobbing every time I treat you with respect. A simple 'thank you' is fine."
Immediately his wand was in his hand and he was hissing, "Dobby, come quietly!"
"Hello, Iris," Dumbledore responded with a warm smile. "I cannot speak Parseltongue," he explained when Harry stared at him, "but I can read body language. Please, sit. We have a lot to discuss." He sighed heavily. "And I have much to apologize for."
A transparent wall shimmered into view. They all jumped.
have to return there again," Dumbledore promised, eyes darkening.
"Thank you," Harry said calmly. "Yes, Ron? I couldn't hear anything over the commotion."
"She's with a friend of mine, I can't keep her at my relatives' house," Harry explained. "But I'll be bringing her to school, so you can meet her on the train. I'm planning on making her my familiar."
He was tall, skinny, with a wild mess of stark-white hair, electric blue eyes, and a lab coat. He grinned maniacally at Harry, showing off two perfect dimples.
"Well met, sir goblin," Harry said absently.
Dobby reappeared and waved eagerly at Remus, who chuckled and nodded back. At the same time, the shield was removed. Harry descended the stairs, keeping his wand in his hand.
"They're sure to treat me kindly -- or as kindly as the Dursleys are capable of -- outside of the house," Harry replied. "And I am good at acting."
"A stag, sir wizard," Harry answered coldly. "Your eye apparently cannot see house-elves. Dobby!"
They nodded.
-------
Harry allowed her to hug him briefly, feeling himself relax. "Hi, Mrs. Weasley," he said warmly.
"Lady McFinnish-" Harry began.
"Neville!" Harry grinned, turning and hugging the plump Gryffindor. "How was your summer?"
"And you can call me Vic," the mad scientist responded. "May I sit?" he gestured to the desk chair.
Remus chuckled. "That's Nymphadora Jones-Tonks. She prefers Tonks, though. That witch next to her is her wife, Hestia Jones-Tonks."
"Does that mean we didn't all have to come here?" the raven-haired witch asked dryly.
"As our Lord commands!" the twins sniggered, taking seats on either side of Hermione, who was trying not to laugh.
"I'm buying
Moody was arguing with a young, pink-haired witch and a black-haired witch. The raven-haired witch seemed to be defending the pink-haired witch, who had accidentally broken a dish.
"Never, ever,
"She says hello," Harry said. "I'm ready, Uncle Pads."
"I'm not, sir wizard," Harry said icily. "Uncle Moony, what was the creature in your office on the first Hogsmeade weekend?"
"What's ketchup?" the twins chorused as Dobby disappeared briefly before returning with a bottle of ketchup.
Griphook looked as astounded as Harry did. "Ah... yes, I believe so. I will give you a list of charities and you can decide how much you want to donate. However, you cannot donate any money from heir vaults. Those are specifically for supporting the heirs before they turn eighteen. You can donate from the lord vaults."
Ron looked like was going to be sick. Hermione was teary-eyed and sniffling.
"Why wasn't her will read?" Harry demanded. "Did my -- did James have a will?"
"Master's bad Muggles," Dobby replied, scowling.
"I'll tell him his godson's here," she agreed, winking at Harry before dragging the other witch inside.
"Say, 'I, (full name), accept Dobby the house-elf as my servant,'" she said.
"What!"
Harry thought sardonically.
Hermione looked startled. "'Mia?'" she repeated.
better wardrobe."
Harry sighed and rubbed his face. "I will always care about you two. But this summer was... I needed you, and you weren't there."
Ron glared at him.

Harry thought. He knew he couldn't ask Moony about the Order out in the open, so he kept quiet.
"Oh, cub," Remus breathed, dropping the paper and pulling Harry into a hug. Harry buried his face in the werewolf's shoulder.
Harry sighed and concentrated. "Dobby?"
"I'll... explain later," Harry muttered.
"I tricked Lucius Malfoy into freeing his house-elf," Harry admitted. "He was mistreating Dobby. I was just-"
His voice was smooth, light, and a little suave.
"Why didn't we think of that!" Sirius complained.
"'Lord Dumbledore?'" Hermione questioned.
Harry nodded and went up to a teller.
Harry blinked, then corrected himself: "Fair eve, sir goblin. How has your gold prospered?"
"Dobby be waiting for Master Harry," Dobby answered before disappearing.
"The Weasleys -- although Bill and Charlie just come and go, and Percy's estranged since he took a job at the Ministry-" Sirius began. "Minnie -- er, McGonagall -- Filius, Snape, Dumbledore, and a lot of people you wouldn't know."
Dumbledore looked startled. "How?"
Harry's birthday fell on the same day that he was going back to Gringotts for his Blood Test. He knew that it would reveal something irritating, painful, and shocking, because every birthday since returning to the wizarding world had had the same outcome.
"They're getting better!" Ron protested.
"What?"
"You told me to dress like a Muggle," Vic shrugged, "but you didn't specify which one. I chose Dr. Frankenstein."
"I'm sorry, Harry," Hermione whispered. "You're right. We..."
"It has prospered well," Griphook grinned. "You came for a Blood Test?"
"Yes," Griphook agreed. "If you take a Magical Aura Test, you can find out. But you won't be able to take it until next week.
"I... I'll think about it," Harry said slowly. "Dobby, would you mind taking my things to my bedroom and blocking anyone from entering except me?"
"As you are not of age, yes, would you have to stay with an adult wizard," Griphook agreed. "I believe you do not want to stay with Potions Master Prince?"
Iris greeted eagerly, waving her tail at him.
"Take it from my... er, the vault I've been using for school," Harry amended.
"Madam Black," Harry said icily. "You are a shame upon your House. You are no longer Lady Black. The head of House is Lord Black. You are belittling and insulting his guests and family. Any pureblood would be ashamed of how horribly you treat the guest of House Black. I expect you to apologize to my
"Mia, a house-elf is connected to their master's magic," Harry sighed. "If you free them, they die of starvation." Hermione paled. "Besides, Dobby has days off, is allowed to eat with me whenever he wants, and has a uniform. Dobby, can you get me some ketchup?"
The meal was delicious, and Harry enjoyed talking with his house-elf. Dinner lasted until seven o'clock, at which time Harry told Dobby to head back to his godfather and future familiar.
Remus was the first to notice that he wasn't descended from Merlin or Gryffindor. When Sirius did, he asked confusedly, "How come you're only descended from Ravenclaw, Canavas, and Prince? And why are you Sni -- Lord Ravenclaw-Prince's heir?"
"What happened here?" he demanded. "What self-respecting pureblood family, Dark or not, would cover up their respected ancestors?"
" Harry said sleepily.
"Potter, your solicitor is here," Petunia said frostily.
father.
Harry wordlessly slid the paper towards the goblin.
Neville nodded. "See you on September 1st?"
Harry blamed his "saving-people-thing" for how easily he said, "I forgive you."

"Uh..."
Harry took a seat and pulled Iris into his lap.
"Aww," Hermione suddenly exclaimed, and Harry pulled out of the hug, confused. "Iris is so cute! Can I hold her?"
more interesting than the goblin wars. Especially since Canavas was
Harry stared at him. "Lord Ravenclaw-Prince told you -- he knew Petunia?"
Dumbledore was silent for a long moment. Then he took a deep breath.
"You have a teaspoon of dew?" Remus said in surprise.
Gasps and muttering. Moody went white.
"Come here, boy, I need to Disillusion you," Moody growled.
" he mused. "
"I'll see you later," Harry told them. "Well, I'll see Hermione by September 1st, if we can get her out of here."
"Boy!" Vernon yelled from the next room. Harry's wand vanished back into his pocket. "Go mow the lawn!"
"About the
"I have changed a lot this summer," Harry acknowledged. "But the one thing that hasn't changed is my loyalty to and interest in my friends.
His godfather's fiancé gave him a gentle nod.
"Dobby, create a shield between me and them," Harry muttered.
The house-elf appeared with a pop. Dobby looked a lot skinnier and more ragged than usual. His skin was sagging and his eyes were dull.
Remus opened the door, revealing a dimly-lit front hall with portraits, which were covered with curtains. Harry stared around incredulously.
"Remus will be back for dinner," Sirius promised, snorting. "Albus is just through there." He pointed to the left. Harry could just see a group of very cushiony chairs and a desk between the shelves. It looked very cozy.
"No, I haven't had time for the meditating," Harry replied, "and I haven't found a Mandrake leaf."
"Yes," Harry agreed. "By the way, thank you for not telling me that my mother was descended from a Squib."
Harry stared blankly down at the test for a solid thirty seconds. Then his magic exploded.
"-want to discuss, Harrikins?" the twins asked.
"Dreaming about your boyfriend again, Potter?" his cousin gloated.
They had reached the top of the stairs. "Your room is the second door on the right," Sirius told him. "Do you want to have a bit with your friends first?"
He realized his mistake when the sky grew cold, and Dudley collapsed, shaking.
"No that's just for school, outside of Hogwarts he's Lord Ravenclaw-Prince," Sirius corrected. "Where'd you learn pureblood etiquette, pup?"
"Even if I weren't," Harry barked, "it would be none of your business, Mr. Moody! And if you do not treat me with respect, I will announce you an enemy to six houses!"
"That will not do at all!" Griphook exclaimed. "General Canavas is one of the most important figures in wizarding history! He was essentially the leader of the vampires in 1450 when the vampires, werewolves, and Fae waged war against the magical humans-"
Taking a breath, Harry started explaining what had happened that summer, starting with the Inheritance Test.
"You will
Dumbledore looked shocked, then delighted. "Well, my boy, you seem to be a prince twice over!" He chuckled. "Ah, a Prince. Oh, I make myself laugh sometimes."
As soon as Dobby had disappeared, Harry pulled a piece of parchment out of his bag and began writing.
"I'd love to!" Hermione beamed.
"-little lord?"
At around four o'clock, Vernon marched up the stairs.
Of course, he'd discovered while reading it that, as a descended of a vampire, there was a possibility that he could become one when he turned seventeen, especially if he had a vampiric ancestor on his father's side. From this rose several questions, especially about his diet. He could not (and did not want to) imagine drinking blood. Luckily, Griphook had anticipated this question, because he had provided him with several books about vampires. Thank goodness there was a Blood Replacement Potion.
Harry pursed his lips. "My relatives... are not especially fond of me. They would most definitely hurt her if she were there."
of snake, Uncle Pads," Harry snorted. Hermione giggled, letting Iris curl up in her arms. Immediately, Ginny and Tonks began cooing over Iris. The little snake began preening.
mistreat their elves. I wouldn't be surprised if you started a movement for elf rights," she added mildly. "I have to get back to work. Farewell, Lord Potter."
As soon as Harry heard the front door shut, he called, "Dobby!"
Harry nodded, hiding a blush. "How much do I owe you?"
Harry sighed and yelled, "SHUT UP!"
----------
"Do I need to repeat myself?" Harry asked icily.
"What do you-"
"What?" Harry said again as he took the sticky-note.
"It's a Muggle food," Harry explained, taking the bottle from Dobby. "Some of them, and I like to do this too, put it on eggs." He squirted some onto his plate and mixed it in. "Want to eat with us, Dobbs?"
"-was the Secret Keeper, betrayed Lord and Lady Potter, and is still alive," Griphook finished, eyes glittering.
Harry snorted again and changed the subject. "Sir, about my trial-"
Hermione bit her lip. "Harry... we did try to write about things we thought you would be interested in."
Harry grinned. "Pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen." He paused. "You told me you were making Shield Hats and Cloaks?"
grew up with knowledge of magic. Since then I have been attacked by Voldemort-" he ignored the flinches "-a Basilisk, dementors, a dragon, and a diary full of Dark magic, forced to compete in a deadly tournament, and was part of a ritual that brought back Voldemort." More flinches. "You? You just got knocked out by a chess piece."
She blushed a little. "No, it's fine." She quickly followed Ron down the stairs.
"Dobby will be doing that," Dobby agreed.
Harry squeezed him back. Then he said, "Are you going to introduce me to your friends?"
"All right, Harry, de-"
"Ooh, what's my little Prongslet planning?" Sirius asked eagerly.
"Good mor --
"Ron," Harry said dryly, "they think Dumbledore is trying to take over the Ministry, and I'm helping. Of course they're searching my mail." Luckily, Dobby could glamour letters to look harmless and keep people from tracking Hedwig.
"Yes," Harry agreed. "I recently found out that I have so much money that it would make the Malfoys jealous. I've donated a lot to charity, but I figured I could help you with your endeavors as well. How do you feel about 3,000,000 Galleons, 2.5 million Sickles, and 2.5 million Knuts?"
"A ghost and all he talks about is the goblin wars," Harry answered.
"-could pull that off."
Ron stormed out of the room.
"A few!" Mrs. Weasley cried. "All of those books have Dark magic in them! It's too dangerous!"
She gave him an alarmed, concerned look. "A free house-elf?!"
Harry glowered at him.
Stunned silence.
They looked stunned and, in Remus' case, a little awed. "Have you shifted yet?" Sirius whispered.
"You bought it," Griphook reminded him.
"I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles-" Ron continued.
He could hear them complaining about the bad service.
"All Muggleborns are descended from Squibs, Mia," Harry explained. "You can take a Blood Test in Gringotts if you like."
Immediately, she stopped shouting, causing the others to silence as well. "L-L-L-Lord Canavas?
"Harry!" Griphook shouted. Harry jumped, and his magic settled. The desk stopped shaking. "What's wrong?"
Harry entered the kitchen, ignoring the shouting from several of the Order members. He took a seat next to Sirius, who looked torn between glee and shock, and Remus, who was gaping. Then he turned to Mrs. Weasley and raised his voice above the din. "I've already had dinner today, Mrs. Weasley, but I wouldn't say no to the dessert."
"Breathe and explain who the h*** Canavas is," Harry advised.
"You can't sense the Dark magic?" Harry questioned.
"Ooh! What is it what is it what is it?" Sirius asked eagerly.
"False, just highly regulated by the Ministry," Harry retorted. "My mother used Blood magic to protect me. And the goblins are a separate community. It's not against their law."
The curtains covering the largest portrait in the front hall had flown apart, revealing an ugly old woman. She was screeching at the top of her lungs. One by one the other curtains flew open and the other portraits began screaming as well.
"Dobby accepts being the great Harry Potter's servant," Dobby said reverently.
"Sirius and I will show Harry to his room," Remus told her, taking the trunk from the pink-haired witch. The raven-haired witch handed Harry his broom and Hedwig's cage.
"Dobby, would you like to be my house-elf?" Harry asked.
"Thanks, Dobby," Harry whispered to the elf. Dobby nodded and disappeared.
Iris agreed. Harry put her back on his shoulders.
"I like her," Harry mused, watching the pink-haired witch.
"Yes," Dumbledore agreed. "How he knows her, I cannot tell you, as it is not my secret to tell."
"Longer than that, actually, if my plan works," Harry said with a little grin.
"We have them connected to our floo," Griphook said with a slight frown. "Would you like me to call them?"
"Concerned for him," Healer McFinnish finished. "That's quite all right, Lord Potter. You had no idea what that would do to Dobby. And many wizards
There was a flash of magic in the air, and when the light cleared, Dobby looked completely healthy and utterly happy.
"Madam," Harry asked as she was about to return to her office, "do you know how to contact freed house-elves?"
"We have books in the library about wizarding lordships, if you want to take a look," Sirius offered, seeing Hermione's intrigued look. "I'll take you up with Harry."
Several of the Order members shouted in shock. The twins came forward, grinning, and bowed.
"Yeah, he's in the library," Sirius replied.
"Thank you, sir goblin," Harry said dryly. The teller summoned another goblin, who led him back to Griphook's office.
"What was it you were going to explain to us?" Remus asked. "I asked how you could sense Dark magic."
Iris asked curiously.
"I'd like to be a silent partner in WWW," Harry answered.
Cursing his "saving-people-thing," Harry immediately headed inside the store.
Sirius pulled him swiftly into a hug, careful not to dislodge Iris. "I love you too, cub," he whispered. Harry swallowed and hugged him back.
The twins scanned the paper and grinned. "We think we-"
"Dobby said that Lord Dumbledore was here," Harry said to Sirius, dishing some eggs and toast onto his plate.
"General Canavas!" Griphook sputtered. "Who don't know -- you're related to-"
"That would be Lady Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement," Griphook informed him.
"What, boy?" he barked.
----------
the python responded.
Harry was woken rudely by sudden pain. He looked up to find Dudley sneering down at him.
"Here," Harry said, handing the bottle to Fred as Dobby sat down on Sirius' other side. "Just a little bit."
"All of them."
Harry loved vampire/werewolf love stories.
She was
Harry gave him a sharp look. "How?"
everything. He was looking forward to pointing that out to him.
"But..." Hermione whispered. "Dumbledore... he had people watching you... and Mrs. Figg... wouldn't they have noticed...?"
"Light magic has the capacity to be dangerous as well," Harry said, looking around absently for the ketchup before remembering that wizards didn't have any. "
"Then how did you get the Canavas lordship, boy?" Moody barked. "That leech's descendants are all dead!"
She blinked. "What?"
"I'm buying the snakes," Harry said briskly.
Sirius pouted, but snatched up Harry's broom and the cage. "You're rooming with Ron, by the way."
"I'll tell you later, Mia," Harry replied.
"It belongs to Sirius-"
Hermione stuck her tongue out at him, and Sirius led her away, laughing. Harry grinned and walked over to Dumbledore.
"You're a
"He doesn't like that I'm Lord Slytherin," Harry said dryly. "Everything good seems to happen to me, and nothing happens to him. At least from his perspective."
"Now, I'm certain" Hermione talked to herself. "There is something keeps him off balance"
"I am not mad at you, Ron. I've never been mad at you for being together, it's what you don't understand. I'm only mad about the fact that you haven't been honest to me and didn't tell that to you best friend. Even Dumbledore knew, heaven's sake!"
"So, why have you been spying on me?" Draco asked this question like it was an everyday question. Harry froze, he didn't know how to respond.
"What?" it was the only thing he could say.
"Studying? Honestly girl, when will you stop being awesome?" Ron said, smiling at her lover with admiration. Hermione smiled back.
Draco took one more step to Harry and now they were close enough to still look each other in the eye but feel each others' breath in their face. Harry was slightly shaking, he couldn't say a single word, he was still freezing.
Still, he couldn't understand why Draco was literally obsessed with him. It was not hard to see, they run into each other on everyday basis whilst going back to their common rooms, which is not a sight that is seen everyday because the Slytherin and Gryffindor common rooms were in completely different places. It got to a point where Harry almost seeked for Draco when he's going back to his common room. The last thing that was in Harry's mind before he fell asleep is that he knew he needed to win the quidditch tomorrow. _________________________________________________
"You're right... But we apologised to you like a billion times and did everything we could to make it up Harry. We miss you. I miss you. I miss my best friend who's always been there for me" Harry finally turned and looked at Ron. He was now fully dressed, his hair wasn't messy and his bed were made. Harry let out a sight, opened his arms to the sides, shook his head so Ron took this opportunity to hug his best friend.
Harry thought to himself.
"Oh, Harry. Would you like to come home with me? Mum really wants to have you as guest" asked Ron.
"Of course he did. Is there anything that old bastard doesn't know?" Harry said almost laughing.
Harry took out his wand and pointed at Draco. "Go away" he said.
"A-actually Ron I thought it would be better if you'd pair with Hermione. You two never paired before and since now you're together, I think it should be nice" Harry spoke.
"It's nothing, I'm just thinking about the exams" Harry poorly lied.
They were losing. The score was pointing that the Slytherin team were winning. Harry knew only he could end the game now with the golden snitch. Unfortunately, Draco was as ambitious as Harry is. The golden snitch were now at Harry's sight but he wasn't the only one who has seen it. With the advantage of his new broom stick, Draco flew faster than Harry and caught the snitch. House Slytherin was cherishing the moment of joy and he has seen the disappointed gaze of professor McGonagall. The only thing he wanted to do was go back to his friends who would comfort him. Unfortunately, Ron and Hermione weren't around.
___________________________________________
"Alright mate?" Ron talked to Harry, still in his bed, his eyes were bearly open and his ginger hair was messy.
That afternoon, Harry went to the library alone. Hermione and Ron asked if they should accompany him but Harry refused saying that that will only make him look weak and scared by Draco. It was half past seven already and Draco wasn't around. Only couple of witches and wizards were left in the library, and they were finishing off with their work. It was not a time that was close to the exams so students were not trying too hard and only studying for their homeworks. While Harry was checking a book, there were only 2 students were left in the library, they were -judging them on their looks and the fact that Harry hasn't seen them before- probably first years. Harry, still holding the book in his hands, looking at the two young witches and smiling softly, remembering his first year days. His concentrate was broken when he heard the familiar footsteps.
doing here?" Harry thought to himself. "And what exactly are they talking about at literally 5 am?" As he kept staring, Lucius put his hand on Draco's back and they both went in the castle, Lucius was constantly checking if anyone was around to see them. "
"Why do you care about a bully anyways, Harry?" Hermione asked Harry. Her voice tone wasn't sarcastic, she was merely asking out of curiosity. Harry knew that. Yet, he couldn't come up with a proper response.
___________________________________________
sorry this chapter took a little longer than the previous ones. like I said in my previous notes, I really would appreciate any comments, good or bad
"Couldn't sleep?" Ron asked after a few minutes, now was sitting in his bed, his eyes were fully open but his hair was still messy.
"So where were you guys anyways?" Harry asked after couple a minutes of silence. Ron and Hermione both went red.
"Oh, tell your mom I said thanks but I think i'd feel a lot better if I spend a week of silence, Ron" said Harry.
_________________________________________
"Harry... You did the homework didn't you..." Hermione asked. Of course, that wasn't a question. She knew exactly he didn't do the homework. Hermione knew there was something in Harry's mind that kept him busy, and she didn't want to push him on telling them what was wrong, since he just started to talk to them properly. So she offered help. "Don't worry, I can help you on lunch break. Mine has unnecessary details anyways. I could use some help with giving out someone some of my information"
"I'm sure we'll find time to speak, Potter. We got the homework just today" Draco said sarcastically, he had the confidence the house slytherin had given him. He continued "What's the rush" Harry left there with feeling embarrassed.
Harry thought to himself, and just like Hermione, he didn't dig the subject any further.
" Draco said, now quietly that only he and Harry could hear. Draco was examining Harry's face now, almost like memorizing it. He slowly took his eyes off Harry's eyes to his nose, then to his cheeks, and finally, his lips. His eyes were locked there. They both started to breath heavier than before, Draco felt his temrature rising.
"We still haven't done it" Harry responded.    "What? The deadline is this Friday and you know Snape doesn't forgive" Hermione cried.
Harry smiled at her. He appreciated Hermione's offer of help. That brought to his mind that if he should talk to them about Malfoy and his weird actions lately. But later that day, he was too busy doing homework so he didn't have the time.
Draco and Harry talked to each other for the first time after 2 weeks from that day. Harry couldn't help but worry about why they haven't been talking. Draco would always find a reason to talk to him- to mock him, of course, but still talk to him- so Harry thought why would him finding a reason to talk to him every once in a while should be a problem. Fortunately, Harry didn't need to.
"Curious" Hermione frowned her brow, "It looks a bit too big to be caused by a frame" She didn't dig any further.
"Whoever's left I guess" Harry said, looking around to see who was sitting alone. There he is. Draco Malfoy with his poker face, sitting alone. Harry knew that he intentionally hadn't partnered with someone and he was eager to find out why.
"We good?" Ron asked, excited.    "Yeah, Ron, we're good. How can we not be?" Harry smiled, still thinking about Draco and Lucius. He decided he wouldn't tell about this to ruin the moment.
"Oh, really?" Ron was a bit surprised. "If you think that's fine..." Harry knew that even tho Ron loved him, he still wanted to partner up with his new lover and he wanted to give him this chance.
"What you probably don't know is that wands can be spouses too, which means even though they can fatally hurt each other, when united, they are unstoppable" Harry was now even more confused than before. Draco, examining his face expressions, knew that Harry had a question in his head. "Now you probably wonder why our wands are spouses" He said, giving back him his wand "That is something I am yet to figure out. Some say the reason shall only be known when such event of union accurs, some say they are random, so that doesn't have any meaning"
, Harry thought,
Of course, it didn't escape Harry that Draco didn't leave. Only few people were left at Hogwarts so it was quite hard to miss someone there. The moment Harry saw Draco being alone at Hogwarts, he knew he was up to no good.
"Yeah" Harry responded.
____________________________________________
"I think you shouldn't waste time, Hermione said. "You should talk to him as soon as possible"
"Yeah, if I'm not completely mistaken, he was" Harry said softly, he was surprised yet calm enough to not raise his voice.
It was a rainy Wednesday morning. Harry, Ron and Hermione were walking to their common room in silence. Ron was the one who broke the silence.
, Harry thought to himself. He didn't like the Malfoys, and the Malfoys certainly did not like Harry Potter. After all, he was the reason why their lord has fallen out of strength.  Their son, Draco was poorly trying to follow his father's footsteps. The only thing he would do is to mock Harry whenever they run into each other. He had too much pressure on him from his last name, Harry understood him in a weird level, and he was old enough to not to care about childish stuff like being mocked.
"Well I really think you should talk to someone, mate. Hermione and I are dead worried about you. You being like that, and you still are mad at us for being together"
"So now that's how we achieve this potion" Hermione spoke, holding a small glass in her hand, smiling in confidence. Harry and Hermione were in Gryffindor common room, doing Snape's homework.
"Hm-hm" Draco shook his head, still looking at the wands. You probably already know that the wands can be brothers/sisters, which means the owners of the wands can harm but cannot fatally hurt each other" Harry shook his head.
"Your wand" he said. Harry stopped and turned his back, now facing Draco who was holding out his hand "Might I have a look?" Harry couldn't understand why Malfoy wanted his wand for, but the was curious enough to take it out and give it to him. Draco took out his wand too, now comparing them, looking through all the details.
here is the second chapter people. I appreciate everyone who's read and left kudos for the first chapter. I see u :)
"Furious" Draco dramatically reacted, "I'm scared"
"Okay, now, what was that, honestly?" Hermione asked, still surprised.
"I don't know yet. He must have done something. Something's up Harry. Between you and Malfoy. If Snape's involved I'm afraid it might not be something good" Hermione said. "She really is clever" Harry thought to himself. "Even when she hasn't a clue on what's going on, she still knows something's going on"
"So, how was your homework "date" with Malfoy, Harry?" Ron asked, obviously mocking with the "date" word.
"For this month's project you will be paired to two" Snape spoke. "Ah" Harry thought to himself "No doubt Snape will pair me with Draco, he'll do anything to make me suffer"
Now Harry was obligated to talk to Draco. There was no escape. Not that the wanted any escape anyways.
"I see that the two of you still haven't partnered up" Snape's voice made the whole class go quiet. "I think it is your destiny now..." Snape spoke slowly "Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy"
"I know that you've seen me and my father the other day. Don't worry, I didn't tell him. So you won't be murdered..." Draco paused for a second, slowly walking towards Harry "...not for today anyways. I figured I can deal with you on my own. Hasn't anyone ever told you it's not polite to spy on people, Potter?" He was still walking towards him, Harry put one of his feet back but suddenly brought it back to where it was. He wasn't gonna appear weak. He just stood there, looking Draco in the eye.
"What?" He asked. He knew he couldn't make his way out of it and pretend he wasn't daydreaming. Instead he justed asked her what was she saying.
Hermione spoke, now has lowered her voice "Harry, we were going to tell you- i promise"
By that time, Harry just realized how close they were and took a few steps back and quickly started to pack his belongings.
?" Harry asked in confusion.
"Just as I thought" Draco spoke in full confidence. Harry frowned his brow at him, Draco knew he had no clue what was going on. "Our wands... they are... bonded" Draco took his time explaining. "They are spouses."
"This time you are free to choose your own partner"
"I'm trying Hermione, I real-"
Harry and Draco hadn't talked after the day they found out that they are somehow bonded. It's been a few weeks since they last talked to each other. Their "running into each other" had been really awkward for both of them. Neither of them had talked, however the tension between the two boys was almost seeable. They would stare each other and they would need to be distracted by their friends. It would usually be Ron since Hermione can't get into boys' bathrooms.
It was now Harry's turn to speak "Which one do you believe is the truth?" he asked.
____________________________________________
Harry got up of bed feeling defeated by insomnia. He washed his face, looking at his reflection in mirror which made him feel disgusting. He poured the concealer in his hands, poorly applying it under his eyes and blending with his fingers. "Who am I fooling with this?" Harry aggressively talked to himself "This is fucked up" The sun was bearly rising, he decided that if he can't enjoy the feeling of sleeping properly, the least he can do is to enjoy the sunrise. When he was looking outside of the window, he saw the siluette of a man and a boy. He couldn't figure the faces but that silver hair was enough evidence for him. Lucius Malfoy and Draco Malfoy. "What is
"What's going on Harry? I feel like there is something going on that you won't tell us"
"...harry..." a female voice spoke from the void. "Harry?" her voice was now more vivid. Hermione. Harry quickly shook his head and met with Hermione's slightly worried and confused face.
Why do you always catch me in my most miserable times?" Harry asked, tired.
"We were... Studying..." the ginger spoke "To help you finish Snape's homework" he finished his sentence, now was confident.
"Draco!" Crabble and Goyle came in the room, running and shouting. "We've been looking for you everywhere, where have you been?" Goyle said. Before Draco could even find time to reply, Grabble spoke."Your father came, he's expecting you in the garden, Snape gave permission."
"Yeah, mate, the one with the ........" Ron said. Harry just froze and tried his best on pretending he hadn't completely forgotten about the homework.
____________________________________________
"You have absolutely no idea what did I just do, do you?" Hermione asked, annoyed.
He felt lonely, like he couldn't talk with his best friends without telling billion lies now and they were doing the same. The worst part is they all are aware of what's going on and still continuing to do so. "Will Hermione and Ron getting together destroy our friendship" Harry tried to push away those thoughts, they made him feel uneasy. "And why do they even feel the need of hiding it from their best friend, me!" Harry was thinking out loud now in the restroom while washing his hands.
"I know. I told him many times and he always delays saying we'll get it done"
" Harry replied as always. They started the duel with bowing each other, turning their backs, walking five steps and using their spell skills. "Expell.." Harry started but he was late. Draco used a stronger spell and the brunette fell on the ground, knocking his head.
"McGonagall's homework?" Harry asked, confused.
"Now that's just amazing" Harry talked to himself while making his way back to the common room. "You need them once, just once and they're gone" he continued to mumble at the empty corridors.
"Honestly, boy, you really are the only company you need" Harry didn't need to look back to see it was Draco. If not for his shining silver hair in the reflection of the mirror, the voice tone was so unique anyone could've notice it in a second.
Ron couldn't go any further and all he could do was to nod. Ron religiously hoped Harry was alright and he really only wanted quite, not anything else.
"So, Harry, what will you do this Christmas?" asked Hermione.
"Oh and who will you be paired with?" Ron asked after a while.
"I'll probably enjoy Hogwarts being quite for a week and hang out with Hagrid in peace" Harry replied. Hermione pinched Ron with giving him the look of "tell him"
"Well if so than you might as well just pay attention"
"See, I told you we'd finish" Draco said after two and a half hours when they were finally done with the homework. Harry didn't reply, just gave him another awkward smile. They sat there in silence for couple of minutes. Harry felt like Draco wasn't done with his words so he decided to remain quite when they both got up and collected their stuff.
Draco Malfoy, for the first time didn't leave Hogwarts for the Christmas. Him and his father wasn't getting along lately so he decided he'd remain there and his father didn't object, even though his mother insisted for him to come home. Draco promised her that he will write to her often and Narcissa told him she'd visit. Draco was more than happy to hear that. His mom also informed him that she will talk to Lucius about him to break the ice between them. Draco always appreciated his mom's efforts on trying to make him happy and keep the family united. It's not like Draco didn't love his father or the other way around. They sometimes don't get along and they mostly decide to avoid each other in order to not argue.
"Not now, Malfoy" Harry replied.
"Yeah, look at him, he's frozen" Goyle responded and joined in laughter. Draco didn't say or do anything, he just packed his stuff as quickly as possible like Harry and then left with his friends. Harry left there after couple of minutes to make sure they're all gone.
____________________________________________
That night, the trio said their goodbyes and in the morning when almost all the students were gone, Harry took a deep breath and hoped this week would be like a vacation and help him get over the dreams.
Harry suddenly woke up, again in sweat. His insomnia was getting worse, ever since that day, Harry would have the same dream over and over again of Draco kissing him that day. Harry couldn't figure out why he was keeping on having the same dream. He tried to tell Ron once at night, then he realized how absurd would it sound if he tried to tell Ron "Well Ron, you know what? I've been having these dreams were Draco and I practically kiss on that day. Oh, what day you ask? The day where he literally stared at my lips when we were less than a feet apart"
"Are you done with figuring out my wand's weaknesses?" Harry asked after a few minutes.
That night, Harry couldn't fall sleep. The only thing that's in his mind was how Lucius Malfoy bought the entire Slytherin team the brand new nimbus 2002.
"Yeah, yeah" Harry was finally distracted from his thoughts.
"I want them on my desk by Tuesday" Snape spoke. "The quidditch match outcomes will not be taken as an excuse" he hissed looking at Harry. Hermione was trying to write everything the potions professor has said, Ron was trying not to fall asleep and the only thing Harry could think of was the quidditch tomorrow. It was Monday so
____________________________________________
"Let us hope it's not something bad" Harry spoke. "And we still haven't talked to each other"
"I think you're right" Harry spoke "Malfoy really can't change to a better person"
Harry woke up in sweat. He had his now almost usual nightmares with Voldemort. Harry wasn't able to sleep properly for the last few weeks, his under eyes were always either puffy or purple, which made him look like a drug addict, he had started to use some weird liquid that had the same color of his skin Hermione gave him. "concealer" as she called it, if he recalled correctly.
"Since when did you care about lessons much enough to ditch a quidditch, Ron?" Now it was Harry's turn to be suspicious.
" a boy spoke. None of the tree needed to even turn to know who it was, yet they were all surprised to know that he was there all the time listening to them and not making any sound. Crabble and Goyle were trying to catch up with the silver boy, they were out of breath. It was obvious that Draco walked fast enough to catch Harry off guard.
"Going mad yet?" a sarcastic male voice spoke. Harry turned around and saw the silver haired boy with his mocking smile.
"I see" Harry said, trying to look interested.
Next day was the first time after that day Harry noticed Draco. He seemed so quiet, his friends were constantly telling him about what seemed like a dull subject according to Draco's face expressions. Harry couldn't help but staring at the bored yet somewhat handsome face. Why was he just realizing that? And more importantly, why was he realizing that at all?
"Dumbledore knew?" Ron's voice became shrill, he was in shock.
Harry continued "It's just a bit weird, he doesn't usually miss classes. And he wasn't around at the lunch too"
Harry looked up to meet Hermione's eyes "I've been paying attention to you and Ron" no response. He continued "I pay attention to how you and Ron don't show up to quidditch anymore. I pay attention to how you two sneak up behind my back. Guess I am paying attention to everything that's happening after all"
Draco offered his hand for him to get up, put on his most dramatic face and spoke "You know what's wrong, Potter? You are too predicable. You think using the same spell all the time will save your ass when Voldemort returns" by the time Harry could even think of a reply, the silver haired boy was already walking away. ________________________________________________
Then I was dumped with the only other living family I have who treated me like a house-elf. And
"Dobby will be doing that!" the elf said happily, disappearing with a pop.
The headmaster looked surprised but proud. "You seem to have everything sorted out." He saddened slightly. "I am sorry that you felt you had to rely on yourself for all of this, Harry."
"Tomorrow morning," Vernon grunted.
Harry frowned a little, but he pricked his finger with the needle.
He headed to his and Ron's room first, carrying the terrarium with him. Ron was downstairs, probably eating. He set Iris on his bed and started getting dressed.
"Oh, don't worry about that, Harry," Dumbledore said amiably, "I have everything taken care of."
Harry chuckled and patted the excited elf's back. "Dobby, this is Healer McFinnish."
" Harry asked in concern as he went over to the glass cage. He opened the lid and lifted her onto his shoulders.
After he'd calmed down, Vic laid down the plan get Harry acquitted. He told Harry that he could either present his memories of the attack, or take Veritaserum. Harry chose memories, because there were a few things that happened that night that would remain between him and his relatives. It involved Vernon's belt and a
"Lord Dumbledore-"
"Do you have any other questions?"
"Harry," Griphook said again. Harry looked up at him. "Do you want me to contact Potions Master-"
Harry sighed. "It's a long story..."
"I WILL NOT-"
"I'm buying a new wardrobe anyway," Harry retorted. "Can I keep this?" He gestured to the Inheritance Test.
"I want you to call Magical Child Protective Services," said Harry.
"Good. What did you need?" Harry pulled a pair of black jeans out of his trunk.
"Hey!"
"What about your lordships?" Hermione asked eagerly.
"Ah, Mr. Potter," Griphook said with a thin smile.
can kill a person. Magic is about intent. Dobby!"
Iris stopped and turned eagerly towards Harry's voice. The baby serpent accidentally rammed her head against the glass. Undeterred, Iris shook herself and cried happily,
"Uncle Moony, why do I need to be Disillusioned?" Harry asked.
Ron immediately agreed and left, but Hermione looked suspicious. "What business?" she asked.
Harry had to stop himself from cackling. "Well met, Commander Winters. You can call me Harry."
Harry, the twins, and Sirius had a wonderful discussion about Muggle foods. When Harry finished eating, he took Iris from Hermione. "I said I would introduce her to everyone, and I have to talk to Lord Dumbledore about something."
"Maybe a few minutes," Harry agreed.
the snake replied nervously.
this house against Death Eaters," Remus sighed exasperatedly.
Harry gave her a "no s***" look. She immediately began pulling snake cages over to the counter.
"Are you questioning me!" Moody yelled.
"Harry Potter called Dobby?" he asked in a monotonous tone.
Petunia immediately left, and the man stepped inside, setting a briefcase on the floor beside Harry's desk.
"Taking more than one magical test a day is not a good idea," Griphook said sternly. "Now, do you want to accept your lordships now? If you do, you'll be expected to wear a
"Griphook expected you ten minutes ago, Lord Potter," the goblin drawled. Several wizards within earshot looked startled.
Harry woke up to excited hissing.
Dumbledore grimaced. "That title is so elegant, it doesn't quite suit me. I prefer Headmaster or Professor."
"What's wrong?" Sirius demanded. "Other than Snivellous being Harry's dad?"
When Harry had read the Commander's reply, he had immediately been interested. He was glad that the solicitor had agreed to represent him, because his official title had been a pain in the a** to write. Hopefully he would find a spell that could copy and paste his full name.
"That's Blood magic!" Ron snarled. "Blood magic is Dark magic and it's illegal!"
Harry cleared his throat. "Let me ask." He stroked Iris' head and hissed, "
Harry perked up. "Library?" He'd gained a newfound love of books since reading the ones on the list Griphook had given him.
Griphook waved him off. "What was your question about your ancestors?"
"Control your rude brat, Lupin," Moody hissed at him.
you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know we haven't really written you -- but we couldn't tell you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn't, oh, we've got so much to tell you, and you've got to tell us -- the dementors! when we heard -- and that Ministry hearing -- it's just outrageous, I looked it all up, they can't expel you, they just can't, there's provisions in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations-"
" Mrs. Weasley shrieked. Everyone jumped and turned to Harry.
"You already know what it is," Remus said in surprise.
~" Harry said quietly to the snake, touching her tail to Sirius' shoulder. "
"I want to know why it says I'm descended from them, but not Potters, Peverells, Slytherin, Gryffindor, and Merlin."
"Great," Harry agreed. "I'd prefer to have it by Halloween, if that's possible."
Harry hesitated and glanced at the Healer.
Ron," Hermione said with a sigh.
"We're taking you to a safe place, but we need to keep you hidden," Remus explained.
"Padfoot and I sleep at the end of the hall," Remus told him. "You can come to us for anything, okay?"

Griphook retrieved a piece of parchment and a needle from the desk. "Three drops of blood," he instructed.
"Healer Finnish," Harry amended, "when you've finished helping Iris -- er, the clear-scaled baby snake -- I would like to have Dobby bring her to me, unless I'm still at the Dursleys, in which case," he told Dobby, "I want you to bring her to Remus Lupin."
"Dumbledore said not to say anything," Ron said with a frown.
"Dobby would be very happy," the elf rasped.
"Yes," Harry agreed. "And I have Vic working on getting Sirius a fair trial."
Harry and Remus disappeared to Moody shouting at empty space. They reappeared in a little park across the street from several broken-down Muggle houses.
Harry lost track of time, and soon the twins came to summon them for dinner. Although he'd already had dinner, Harry decided to come down anyway.
"No," Harry said abruptly. "And I don't want to talk about it." He changed the subject swiftly. "Since my mother has vampiric ancestors and Snape is a vampire, does that make it more likely that I'll be one?"
