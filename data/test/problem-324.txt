“Oh, come off it, Harry. I dropped by your room this morning to see if you were up for breakfast and Malfoy said you’d buggered off.” Her voice wasn’t accusatory but Harry still felt like he’d been caught out.
Harry frowned. He didn't know what Malfoy meant by that. “I do hate hotel rooms, though, so it’s a bit of a catch 22.”
“By the power vested in me by the Department of Magical Games and Sports, I proclaim Lochinvar Quidditch Academy open for business.”
Harry awoke with a start and the overwhelming feeling of wrongness. He looked around the room in his half-asleep panic before realising that the problem was that it was quiet. No Tempus blaring, no Malfoy humming in the bathroom and clattering around getting ready. Harry slumped back down on his pillows with a huff and then winced. His head felt like hell, and the morning light seeping through the curtains wasn’t helping. He vaguely remembered taking Dreamless Sleep the night before which always made his hangovers significantly worse.
Benjy Williams stood just to their left, wand aloft. A breeze blew across the grounds and the sun shone down on all they had built, and Draco’s heart felt a little like it was going to explode. Williams lowered his wand with a sharp flick.
“Tough luck, Potty,” he called and Harry felt the eyes of the rest of his team on them. “Tell Ginerva I say hello.”
“She’s terrifying is what she is,” Harry replied. “She was having a go at me about my bloody cufflinks. How did she see that I wasn’t wearing them from all the way across the room?”
“It’s not like that,” Harry sighed. “They’re nice now, but the headlines were brutal when Ginny and I broke up, and it only gets worse when I’m seen out with girls.”
The water was so cold it knocked the breath out of him. He emerged gasping and spluttering and heard Draco laughing at him. “Fucking hell!” Harry squawked.
Once again, Harry felt that familiar anger twist in his chest, and a small part of his brain registered that it felt good.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him, putting his bottle down. “Are you here to use the gym? You don’t look like you need any more exercise.” His eyes dragged over Harry’s very sweaty and presumably disgusting appearance.
he thought finally. Harry had never been known for his self-control so he wasn’t particularly surprised to find himself reaching for the little silver device on the bedside table after only a minute of internal battling. Just one text couldn’t hurt.
Malfoy didn’t return to their room until it was practically morning, but Harry pretended to be asleep, wanting to delay the awkwardness as long as possible.
It was an odd feeling to celebrate Malfoy winning a Quidditch game but Harry did his best, sending him what he hoped was a gracious smile across the changing room as he won man of the match. Malfoy didn’t return it.
“It’s just that you’re there all by yourself, and half the rooms are locked off.” She looked at Ron desperately for backup.
They made their way back to the castle where Draco went straight to bed. Harry spent the rest of the day reading a book about the Quidditch school that Draco’s aunt had run. He was astonished to find that almost every major name in Quidditch over the past forty years had attended at one point or another.
Malfoy scowled at him, “I didn’t…No, not as such.” He admitted through gritted teeth. Harry had to clear his throat again to hide the snort of laughter which bubbled up at that. “This isn’t a proper duel anyway, though I wouldn’t expect you to know since you’re practically an honorary Muggle.”
Ron sent Hermione a look of such raw, unadulterated love that Harry had to look away. “Thanks, mate.” He cleared his throat. “And, erm, we’re very happy for you too, about… you know.” He looked deeply uncomfortable.
To be honest he hadn’t even really thought about that being an option before. Dudley and his friends used to enjoy calling him gay, but until he was about 10 he’d thought that just meant stupid. One day when he was at the supermarket with Aunt Petunia and they had seen two men kissing in the confectionery aisle.
“Firstly, as his agent I need to ask you to leave Draco alone.” Harry blinked at her, but she wasn’t done. “I know that this is all very new and exciting to you but he has a career to worry about.”
“I don’t know!” Harry pressed his fists into his temples in frustration. “Do you want a relationship?” he asked.
“Give me your other hand,” he said with a put upon tone, but when Harry looked back at his face there were two little spots of pink on his cheeks. Harry watched as he threaded the other link through the cuff, his long, agile fingers deftly twisting it through.
“Well, I just mean what you said about me the other night.” Even to his own ears, Harry’s argument sounded weak.
They were both speeding up now, gasping more than kissing into each other's mouths. It was filthy and ridiculous and they were both still wearing their pants. Harry knew he wasn’t going to last long, and by the sounds Malfoy was making, he wasn’t going to either.
Harry could do nothing but laugh and allow himself to be debauched against the china cabinet in his sitting room.
“Hang on,” Harry said, stepping towards him but he was already out the door and Harry heard the Floo in the kitchen go.
It was safe to say that he felt rather stupid about having believed the rumours about Malfoy and Ginny, and more than a little guilty for being so hostile. He was supposed to be representing his country and his club and instead he’d acted like a jealous teenager.
“It’s not a matter of wanting to - there’s nothing else I’d rather do once I finish playing.” The muscle in Draco’s jaw twitched. “It’s just a shame that no one in the wizarding world would trust me with their kneazle, let alone their children.”
Ron grimaced and tugged the magazine out of Angelina’s grip. “Don’t lose the plot, alright?” He handed it to Harry warily.
Malfoy must have noticed because after a moment he pulled Harry back up to kiss him. Harry’s pride was saved by the fact that Malfoy was obviously getting close, if the pink on his cheeks and the heaving of his chest was anything to go by.
Because there was no way that he was attracted to Malfoy. He was pointy and mean, and his hair looked stupid and overdone all the time. Not to mention the fact that he was a man, which was a whole other kettle of fish that Harry didn’t want to begin to look into.
Harry blinked at him, trying to process why the hell Hermione and Ron would have invited Hermione’s ex-boyfriend to their wedding. It felt rude to ask, so he just smiled. “Thanks, Viktor. Good thing I’ve got you looking out for me.”
As soon as Harry walked in, Ginny waved at him to join them but he just gave her a smile and walked over to Malfoy, sliding in to sit across from him. Malfoy looked up, not bothering to hide his astonishment.
They made their way out of the dining tent and towards the press tent, which was empty at the moment because there was a game on. Draco stalked in and took a seat near the back, tearing open his banana and taking a large bite. Harry followed him cautiously and took a seat on the other side of the aisle.
He resolved to put his head down and focus on winning, and so that was what he did, right up until he came into the dressing room to get changed for the last practice before the final and found Angelina and Ron pouring over a brightly coloured magazine.
He paid the bird quickly and then retreated back to bed with the letter. It was addressed to him and when he turned it over he saw that it was sealed with the crest of the English National Quidditch team. Heart pounding, Harry wrapped the blankets around him tightly and began to read.
“And whose fault is that?” Draco asked. “Fortunately for you, I asked Una to whip us up some breakfast.”
“I mean,” Harry summoned his courage. “What if this is it? It’s been a year since we split and we’re nowhere near getting back together. What if we’re better off apart?” He could see Hermione giving Ron a pointed look.
Malfoy was looking down at him, regarding him with an intensity that made Harry feel as though all the air had disappeared from the corridor. “I thought perhaps we could be adults about this, but it seems you are determined to act like we’re back at school. So be it. I’ll see you on the pitch, Scarhead.”
Malfoy opened his mouth and closed it again. His eyes narrowed. “What is this about, Potter? Why are you being all weird all of a sudden?”
You have the capacity to hurt him very deeply, Pansy had said. Harry tried to look at their relationship from Draco’s perspective. He’d always assumed that Draco held the power between the two of them; he was more experienced, more decisive. But now Harry wondered if that was the truth. He remembered what Angelina had said about the difficulties Draco had faced when he first came to the Magpies. Had Harry helped him? Had he encouraged the English wizarding world to embrace him?
Draco turned back to him, mouth twisting into a smirk. “So demanding. Never let it be said that I don’t deliver on my promises.”
As he did every morning, he looked at the red highlight labeled ‘2006 Quidditch World Cup’, and his face hardened into a determined frown. That was his goal. No matter how tired or grumpy he was or how sore his head got, that little red highlight on the planner always filled him with purpose.
It was one of those freezing, cloudless days that only happen in Scotland, the type of cold that made everything clearer and sharper. The crisp loch air reminded Harry so unbearably of autumn Quidditch games at Hogwarts that he had to close his eyes and take a deep, shuddering breath. It felt like the first time he’d been able to breathe properly in years.
Malfoy cleared his throat, making Harry jump a little bit. “I’ll show you that move I used against you in that game a while back if you like," he said quietly and Harry had to turn and look at him to make sure he’d heard correctly.
Harry took another step forward while Draco’s eyes tracked him carefully, and sat down on the bed, still in his formal clothes. He ran his fingers gently over the sharpness of Draco’s collarbone, the broad plane of his chest. He felt like he was looking at him for the very first time.
The next night, Malfoy came back even earlier. Harry still had the light on, trying and failing to read his book. This time he didn’t seem surprised to see Harry still awake. He came in silently and sat down on his bed to take his shoes off.
Harry had the next afternoon off as he wouldn’t be playing for a few days so he decided to do a bit of exploring. The Marvelous Magical Map of Melbourne he picked up from the front desk of the hotel told him that the inner city was set up like a grid with trams going in all directions. The map had a handful of little glowing spots that expanded into descriptions of the magical sites when he tapped his wand against them.
“I was just going to the showers, actually,” he replied, feeling hot and off-kilter under Malfoy’s gaze.
Harry smiled half-heartedly and looked down at the table. The past few weeks had been a nightmare in the press (not that he didn’t deserve it) and he’d been well and truly ripped a new one by Davies. All he wanted to do was crawl into bed and hide from the world but if he pulled out of the tour now, it would look like he was doing it because he lost the League Cup. He would not only look like a sore loser, but Malfoy would know that he had won. Even so, Harry couldn’t imagine being away from home for a month. The idea made his heart race and stomach clench.
It was only then that he noticed the deafening silence in the stadium, and the fact that gameplay had stopped as players on both sides stared at him in astonishment.
The man himself came in a little after everyone else, and Harry almost choked on his beer when he saw him. He was wearing a pair of light blue trousers which were slightly less formal than his usual, but still obviously tailored, and a white button down with the top three buttons undone. He looked summery and relaxed in a way that made Harry feel itchy under his skin. He looked away quickly, and stared out at the boats instead, trying not to have an aneurysm.
“So, Potter, what was it like being beaten by your old school rival Draco Malfoy?” a man in green robes called.
Malfoy sighed and rubbed his hand over his face. “I mean that person that the fans see is a character. I’m not the same person on the pitch as I am off it. Not because no one would want to watch the normal me, mind, because I’m extremely interesting.”
Over the next few weeks, he was so busy that he almost forgot about the entire ordeal. They were only a few weeks out from the final of the British and Irish League cup and it was looking as though the Magpies and Puddlemere would both make it. Harry had had little choice about keeping up with Malfoy’s runaway success as the press took any and every opportunity to ask him about it.
At the mention of his name, she turned to Harry, wide-eyed. “Mr Harry Potter, it is an honour to have you at Lochinvar Castle. Master Draco is telling Una a great many things about you over the years.”
Harry stayed close next to Draco, hoping to be able to intervene if he needed to sit down without looking like he was hovering. He wasn’t entirely successful but luckily Draco was too ill to really kick up a fuss.
He managed to find one at the station next to Draco’s room. After casting a seemingly endless number of diagnostic charms, she pulled a vial of an emerald green potion from her robes.
Malfoy blinked. “Oh, right. I see.” There were two tiny spots of pink right at the top of his cheeks.
“Don’t,” he said coldly, stepping away from Harry. “Go back to London. We can speak after the World Cup.”
Pansy rolled her eyes again. “You’re not listening, Potter. What I’m saying is he’s more fragile than you think and you need to be careful with him.”
“Since when has Harry Potter cared about what is and isn’t a good idea?” Benjy asked, cocking his head to one side. “You know, my mentor had something that she used to say whenever I was afraid to take a risk. ‘Benjy,’ she used to say. ‘Grow a pair’”
He wanted to go back to sleep very badly, mainly so he didn’t have to face the memories from the night before that were slowly but surely trickling back into his consciousness. He couldn’t quite believe it all had actually happened, but the proof was in the fact that he was definitely not in the hotel room he was meant to be sharing with Malfoy.
“Pretty good, eh?” Harry jolted at the shopkeeper’s words and then felt his neck grow hot when he saw his knowing smile.
He turned to ask about it but Draco had his eyes closed and a pained expression on his face so Harry resolved to bring it up later.
It was so rare for Harry to have a Saturday off that he didn’t quite know what to do with himself. By 3 pm he’d barely managed to drag himself from his bed to the sofa and was trying and failing to eat his Chinese takeaway while horizontal. Safe to say it was a shock when his phone buzzed.
Draco closed the book quickly, looking a little queasy. “There’s definitely mermaid blood in there,” he said, putting it carefully back on the shelf.
“I don’t need you to say you’re sorry, I just wanted to tell you that I thought what you said was out of line,” Harry said, forcing himself to look Malfoy in the eye.
Finally, he got his chance. Malfoy was briefly distracted by O'Flaherty and so Harry moved, flying leisurely but intentionally towards the spot above the stands where the Snitch was currently hovering.
He couldn’t watch Draco’s games because he was so busy, but he caught the highlights from Davies: Scotland were progressing almost as well as England. The likelihood that they would meet in the final was growing by the day.
They made their way back to Draco’s rooms, where a light breakfast was laid out on the table in the corner.
Harry came back over to have a look, much more cautiously this time. Draco was looking at the title page of the first chapter which did have a suspicious-looking stain in one corner, but it was the chapter title that caught Harry’s eye.
Malfoy made an annoyed noise and Harry felt a surge of satisfaction before he remembered that he was supposed to be being nice to him.
Harry’s jaw clenched, trying to stop himself from saying what he was thinking. He’d never been much good at that. “Where’s Camille?” he asked and it sounded bitter even to his own ears.
Well, he couldn’t very well claim to care about Draco the way he did and still think that, could he?
After lunch, the other guests began to arrive. Everyone made their way to the courtyard in the keep which had been set up with chairs and a small podium. The press filled the first two rows, and for the first time, Draco could feel Harry tensing next to him. Luckily for him, Draco felt perfectly at home in front of a crowd of hostile reporters.
He'd received enough blowjobs that he had a general idea of what might feel good, but nothing could have prepared him for the feeling of having another man in his mouth, knowing what it must feel like for him. It was a level of control and satisfaction he’d never felt before, especially knowing that it was Draco he was doing this to.
“That reminds me - are we still on to watch the Magpies play the Cannon this arvo?” Ron asked over his shoulder. Despite being employed by Puddlemere United, he was still a dyed in the wool Chudley Cannons supporter.
“I suppose. Just one,” Malfoy replied, voice warm and soft in that way it only ever was over the phone with miles and miles between them.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Merlin’s arse, why do I even bother.” He closed his eyes for a long second, mouth pinched in a thin line and then opened them again. “I just came over to say - you’re overthinking it. You’re a much stronger player than Matthews. You need to relax and focus on what you’re there to do. Also, I really want us to win so get a move on.”
Cormac made a rude gesture but Harry ignored him and looked back down at his drink. He was focusing very hard on not looking over at Malfoy because he could sense that his feelings were written all over his face and he didn’t want anyone to see them. He was still staring down at his glass when he felt Camille getting to her feet.
“God, no.” He rubbed his hand through his hair. “I mean it was stupid because even then things weren’t great, and I thought somehow proposing would fix it, but I don’t regret being with you for one second.”
He paused in the doorway. Malfoy was leaning on the balcony, staring out at the city. The lamplight from the room spilled out and made his back and his shoulders look like they were luminescent. Harry took a sip of his drink, and a deep breath.
Despite his protests, Harry followed Draco to the far edge of the outcrop where a small path led down to the stoney loch’s edge. The water was clear but it didn't appear overly inviting.
The thing was though, Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t, which may have explained why he was slipping out of bed at 11.20pm.
“Speaking of…” It was Rita Skeeter piping up this time. “When will you both be ready to be honest with the public about your relationship?”
“What are you talking about? I’m out of the house now, aren’t I? And I’ll be out of the house when I’m playing in front of a few thousand people on Saturday.”
Now that it was full of people, it finally felt like a real Quidditch school, rather than just the idea of one. Draco had based much of the design on old photos he’d found of the original school, and he had never been more proud of anything in his entire life. Part of him wished desperately that Aunt Delila could have been there to see it and to meet Harry. He felt deep in his bones that she would have loved both.
“Where do you even buy this crap?” Harry asked, inspecting the elaborate label. He was pretty sure they didn’t sell anything like this at Madam Primpernelle’s.
“Alone time?” Harry could practically hear the leer in Malfoy’s voice. “Is that what the kids are calling it these days?”
Ron’s brow furrowed and he seemed to consider his question for a moment. Harry was struck with a sudden rush of affection for his best mate. He was so out of his element but he was really, really trying.
He tapped his phone against his lip, waiting for a response, but it never came. When Harry woke up on the sofa an unknown amount of time later, there was still no message.
“Harry…” He looked up at her finally. She was nearly three months pregnant now, and it had made her cheeks fuller and her eyes brighter. She looked younger than usual, and it made Harry’s heart hurt.
“It’s just that I’ve never been with someone like them before. I’m not sure that it’s a good idea.” Harry gnawed on the inside of his cheek.
“Harry! Harry! Malfoy, and the Slytherins! My camera!” He was so panicked that he could barely form a sentence.
“Morgana’s saggy knickers, I cannot believe I almost married you,” Ginny sighed, throwing her hands up dramatically.
Harry pulled away and gave him a watery smile. “Everything is fine. I need to go, though. I’ll see you at training?”
“No! Well, not no but… It’s complicated.” Harry glanced around quickly to make sure no one was listening.
An unfortunate side-effect of catching up with his friends was that Harry now had approximately three times more people interrogating him about his personal life. He was inundated with invitations to blind dates and dinner parties. It was rather overwhelming. He resisted for the first few months, but that only caused more questions and he could tell they were beginning to suspect that he was seeing someone. So, against his better judgement, he gave in and agreed to go on a date set up by Hermione - much to Malfoy’s amusement.
“Well, we’re very excited to have you here, Zoe,” Harry said, smiling at her brightly. The poor girl went beet red and hid behind her father.
Hermione had instructed him to meet Beth at a little cafe on Diagon Alley at seven, but Harry had spent so much time trying to make his jacket look less rumpled that he arrived at one minute past, feeling extremely frazzled.
The first game took place the day after that initial awkward breakfast. Harry was watching from the bench and, from the offset, it was clear to him that the Thestrals were the weaker team. McManus and O'Flaherty just weren’t gelling, Wood let in a few easy goals, and no one seemed on top form - no one except Malfoy. The casual observer wouldn’t have noticed the skill inherent in the way he played, but Harry could see it all in excruciating detail. He was one of the most controlled, relaxed players Harry had ever seen until he caught sight of the Snitch. It was impossible to tell the exact moment he saw it; one moment he was hovering high above the pitch and the next he was dropping - no - diving towards the flash of gold. As the Snitch darted and sped off, he saw Malfoy lean forward almost imperceptibly, and speed up, arm outstretched. The other Seeker hardly stood a chance.
His brain was lagging a solid ten minutes behind the rest of his body, and only caught up with him when he found himself standing in front of Malfoy’s door. He hadn’t made a conscious decision to go there, but if he was completely honest with himself, it seemed inevitable.
That old taunt should not have made his blood boil the way it did. He wasn’t even self-conscious about the scar anymore - he was twenty-four, for fuck sake - but something about that nickname in Malfoy’s stupid, plummy accent made him feel like a teenager again.
She didn’t look very impressed but strummed her instrument nonetheless and a small doorway opened up to her left. “Appalling manners, these Quidditch players,” he heard her mutter as he scurried inside.
He stuck his face directly into the stream of water, eyes closed, and let the rushing sound drown out his thoughts for a moment.
“I don’t know what you want, Harry.” He sounded exhausted. “And the worst part is I don’t know if you know either.”
If Harry had hoped that that experience was enough to deter Draco he was wrong because he was already reaching for another book, bound with something that looked suspiciously like hair.
“I’ve been standing here for about three minutes,” she countered, an unimpressed look on her face. Harry felt his cheeks heat up.
“It was all true,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t be half the Seeker I am now without you pushing my buttons. I’m sorry I’ve been such an idiot.” He felt his words spilling out as usual but now he didn’t try to stop them. “I don’t expect you to forgive me just like that but I wanted you to know that I understand why you were scared of what this could be. But I think that this could be really good. I mean, I think that we could be really good together, properly this time.”
All throughout dinner Harry kept finding his eyes straying back to Malfoy as he chatted easily with Wood and the New Zealand tour manager. It was getting slightly ridiculous, so Harry did the only thing he could think of and got very, very drunk.
“How do you forget cufflinks? I swear, Potter, you’d forget your head if it wasn’t attached.” He came over and inspected Harry’s sleeve and sighed. “These robes really do need cufflinks, you know.” He seemed to consider something for a moment and then undid his own and held them out to Harry.
“No, I’m not and yes, I do,” he argued, but it was slightly undermined when he swayed again. Fuck, he was dizzy.
Then a horrible thought struck him, what if Malfoy told people Harry had kissed him? That would be awful, he would never hear the end of it from the Slytherins and it would be humiliating having the whole school think he had a thing for Malfoy. Which he didn’t. Right? That was a whole can of worms Harry wasn’t brave enough to open, did he like Malfoy? He was pretty certain he didn’t. He’d never really liked anyone before, other than an actress he’d seen on television at the Dursley’s on an odd occasion when he’d been allowed to watch. She had been fighting someone in some action movie and Harry had thought about how pretty she was for at least a few days afterwards. But he’d never liked an actual girl or a boy for that matter, and anyway, Malfoy was git of massive proportions, not to mention the fact that he was a boy.
“Eloquent as always,” Malfoy smirked and so Harry dug his elbow into his ribs. “Fuck, you have bony elbows.”
The handwriting was so elegant and delicate that Harry had to look up for a second and catch Malfoy’s eye to confirm that it was actually his. He considered his answer carefully. Did he actually want to duel Malfoy for Colin bloody Creevey’s bloody camera? Not really, but there was something about Malfoy’s supercilious smile that made Harry want to one-up him more than anything in the world. He scrawled his answer on the back of the same scrap and, when Snape looked away again, sent it sailing over.
“What do you think I’m doing, idiot? I’m giving you my cufflinks so you can look like a grown-up for once in your life.” He rolled his eyes and reached for Harry’s hand, wrapping his index and thumb around his wrist and turning it to place one of the studs in his palm. Then he picked up Harry’s other wrist and pinched the cuff, sliding the silver stud through the two holes in the fabric. His fingers were tight and warm where they circled Harry’s wrist and it was unexpectedly intimate.
He glanced down at his wrist, he knew exactly where his cufflinks were, on the dresser in his bedroom, but there was no use telling Mrs Patil that. “Right, thanks. I’ll get right onto that,” he mumbled.
Over the next four hours he de-cobwebbed the library, discovered a Doxy infestation in the third spare bedroom, and finally managed to convince Kreacher to help him cover up the third ugliest portrait in the living room. He was just pulling on a clean t-shirt when there was a rush in the floo and Draco stepped out. He was still in his uniform with grass and sweat stains all over it and he looked wind-swept and gorgeous. Without saying a word, he crossed the room in two strides and kissed Harry thoroughly, cradling his face in his leather-gloved hands.
“I’ve been thinking about this all afternoon,” he murmured, trying to undo Harry’s shirt with one hand while the other slid down the back of Harry’s trousers. “I’m going to ruin you.”
A few hours later, when the party had wound down, Harry found himself sitting on the roof of the Burrow with Ginny, passing a bottle of Firewhiskey back and forth between them. The first year after the war this little section of roof - which could only be accessed by climbing out of Ginny’s bedroom window - had been their escape. They used to come out when neither of them could sleep, just to sit and look at the stars.
“Erm, yes.” Harry had no idea what to make of the little man. He was looking directly up into Harry’s face as if searching for something. His dark brown eyes were so surrounded by wrinkles that they seemed in danger of disappearing into his face.
He wondered why Malfoy had chosen to come back now, perhaps he was hoping to play in the World Cup? If Campbell did end up retiring like everyone seemed to think he would, the Scottish team would be in need of a new Seeker, and if Malfoy was based in Scotland he could potentially be eligible. It was an unpleasant thought, but Scotland hadn’t even qualified for the World Cup in years and without Campbell, their chances weren’t great. Surely if Malfoy had been any good Harry would have heard about it?
She paused, glanced back down at her notebook and then back up at him. “Please don’t get upset Mr Potter. I do have some more Quidditch questions, actually. First, how much personal responsibility do you take for the loss of the 2002 World Cup, and what do you say to fans who feel that you let the entire nation down?”
Harry swallowed. He couldn’t form a coherent thought, let alone speak. He couldn’t even answer that question in his own head. Their lips were so close together - did he want Malfoy to kiss him? Did he want to punch him? Malfoy leaned in even closer, their mouths a hair’s breadth apart, and Harry closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable.
“So,” Harry said, a little breathlessly. He felt drunker than he should be. “Are you going to apologise?”
At first glance, Lochinvar Castle wasn’t much to speak of - barely a ruin, no more than a few stones piled at the end of the outcrop which stuck out into the loch like the knob on a puzzle piece. As one got closer though, the glamour began to clear a little and the full beauty of it came into focus. It was less a castle and more a fortress, a collection of buildings and lawns on the peninsula, connected to the land by a thin stone road. There was one main building, a tall, square stone keep, at the far end. Like all the other buildings, it was made out of dark grey stone that looked so ancient it might have grown organically from the rolling grass. The outcrop overlooked the loch, a wide expanse of inky blue water that lapped at the shaggy rocks below.
Most of the blowjobs Harry had received in his life had taken place either standing up or in bed under the covers, lying flat on his back. He’d never considered how much more intimate it would be to be sitting up like this, how much closer they would be. He didn’t even need to extend his arm to touch Malfoy, to run his hands over his back and wrap his fingers in his hair.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry groaned, covering his face. “I had no choice. Hermione just doesn’t take no for an answer.”
The biggest thank you ever to my wonderful friends for your unwavering support, but particularly to Lucy for getting me drunk and making me send her the first draft and, then spending months editing it for me. You are the best flatmate in the world and I am unbelievably grateful to know you!
He definitely should have left when he walked into the room and found Rita Skeeter smiling broadly back at him.
Up close things weren’t any better. Malfoy looked calm and comfortable in his surroundings; like he’d been playing there his whole life. Inexplicably, Harry felt like the new kid.
Unfortunately, his silence did not seem to be having the intended effect as Malfoy immediately glanced at him in confusion when he didn’t say anything about the alarm. When it became clear that Harry wasn’t going to complain at all he started to get ready but looked a bit perturbed.
“Look, what I was going to say is that I’m sorry about hitting you.” He paused. “Even though you did actually ask me to do it.”
“The flattery never ends,” He turned slightly and cocked his head. “Look, if you really want it back, you can duel me for it.”
Harry pulled Wood to the side with slightly more aggression than was necessary. He was fuming. “What the fuck, Oliver? You’re putting me with him?”
“They’re bloody everywhere these days, it’s disgusting,” She'd muttered. When Harry had asked her who she was talking about she just sniffed, looking pointedly at the men down her long nose, and Harry had put two and two together.
As he flew down towards his teammates, Harry searched the ground until he spotted the blond head looking back up at him, an appreciative smile on his face.
Frustrated, Harry rolled the paper up and tossed it at the already overflowing waste paper basket in the corner.  He didn’t know what to feel. He’d followed Malfoy’s career enough to know that he played for a provincial team in France, but that was about it. After the war Lucius Malfoy had been sent to Azkaban but Mrs Malfoy and Draco had escaped prison, in no small part due to Harry’s testimony on her behalf. They’d been stripped of their house and lands though and so they had left the country and, as far as Harry knew, hadn’t returned.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed in spite of himself. “I probably won’t be dating another ginger for a while to be honest. Ron said I should try blondes.” Malfoy coughed and when Harry looked over his eyebrows were raised. Harry flushed, realising belatedly what he had said. “I didn’t mean…”
“Fucking Christ, Draco.” He pulled Malfoy’s head off his dick with both hands and brought him up to kiss him deeply, greedily. Malfoy pulled away slightly, one hand still gripping Harry, raising an eyebrow questioningly. “I was going to… I’m going to be useless once I come and I want to… to do that for you first.” Harry knew he sounded like an idiot but Malfoy didn’t seem to mind. He grinned and pulled Harry in to kiss him again.
She nodded, still looking pale. “We just found out, we wanted you to be the first to know. We didn’t know…” She swallowed. “I’m sorry for invading your privacy. You can tell us about what’s going with… all of that, whenever you’re ready.”
Ginny looked away, out at the backyard of the Burrow where the pre-dawn moonlight light illuminated the light frost like diamonds. “Sometimes I think you would have been better off without me.” She sounded uncharacteristically uncertain. “I was never any good at being there for you when you needed me.”
Just as he was sinking into a properly crap mood, the fireplace sparked and a prim woman's voice boomed out of it.
Later Harry lay in bed sprawled across Draco’s chest, tracing the long, sliver scars which crisscrossed his pale skin. He felt, for the first time in forever, completely and utterly at peace. He was just beginning to nod off when he realised, with a start that he had completely forgotten about winning the World Cup. The thought hit him so hard that he sat bolt upright.
The morning of the game against the Magpies was overcast and a bit grim - perfect conditions for a great game, in Harry’s opinion. The commentators had projected an easy win for Puddlemere, and while Harry didn’t want to count his chickens, he felt relatively confident in his abilities. Put it this way: he’d never lost to Malfoy before.
Draco was nowhere to be seen during the aftermath celebrations, nor was he at the afterparty at the England camp afterwards - not that Harry had really been expecting him to be.
“Oh, Christ,” he heard himself gasp, biting down hard on his hand to stop himself from coming then and there. When he had control of himself, he moved very slightly deeper, and felt more than heard the noise that Draco made.
“Gay?” She gave him an unimpressed look. “I don’t know, it can be really difficult for gay players even these days. Why do you think we’ve never had an openly gay male player?”
Marseille was stunning. On the pitch, the sun was so bright and blinding as it glanced off the metal stands that Harry had to wear his tinted goggles. Unlike the oppressive heat in Australia, the French spring was mild and pleasant, usually with just a hint of a breeze. It made playing a joy, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder why on earth Malfoy had ever left.
Draco pulled him back so he could look into his face and kissed him gently. “Don’t be stupid. No one would stand you up — you’re the saviour of the wizarding world.”
“It was confusing, okay? He’s very secretive about his feelings.” Harry felt like he needed to defend himself, as difficult as it may be.
Pansy gave him a tired look. “Not intentionally, perhaps, but have you’ve always been more than happy to throw him under the bus when you lost your temper. You’ve never tried to use your position to help him. You know he still can’t walk down Diagon Alley without getting spat at?”
To be perfectly honest, he’d given himself a bit of a shock too. He didn't know where it had come from. He looked down at the Firewhiskey - perhaps he’d better slow down. “Sorry,” he said with a laugh.
“Thanks, mate. I really appreciate it.” He smiled at the other man. Krum just nodded, and mimed sealing his lips and throwing away the key.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her. “I think the public is quite aware of our relationship, Ms Skeeter. A little too aware at times, some might say. I’ve heard from a few people that they’d like to see a little less of us if you’re looking for feedback.”
“Christ,” Harry said, watching as Campbell was whisked away by Healers, blood pouring from his head.
Malfoy laughed quietly. He hadn’t moved from where his lips were almost pressed up to Harry’s ear. Harry swore he felt him more than heard him. “Please what?”
He felt for just a second that aching, bone-deep loneliness he’d felt for the first year after his breakup with Ginny, except this time it wasn’t her he was thinking about because she was right there in his arms. He felt like a bit of a creep watching Krum and Charlie as they obviously didn’t want anyone seeing them but his eyes kept glancing over in their direction.
It took him a good few minutes to pull himself together enough to climb down and walk out into the bathroom, by which time Malfoy was long gone. As he walked toward the door Harry caught sight of himself in one of the mirrors in the centre of the room. He moved closer to get a better look, almost not recognising himself at first. The boy looking back at him still had dodgy glasses, unruly hair, green eyes, and a scar, but Harry felt as though he was looking at a stranger. The last time he had looked in the mirror he had been brushing his teeth in the Gryffindor boys bathroom, getting ready to fight Malfoy. The last time he had looked in the mirror he hadn’t been kissed, and now he had, and by Malfoy of all people.
When Draco told him to slick himself up, he nearly passed out, but managed to gather himself long enough to do as he was told and slide carefully into the unbearable heat and tightness of Draco.
To Harry’s dismay, Ginny immediately snatched the phone out of his hands and began to examine it. Harry winced as she flipped it open. “It’s a mobile phone. I just bought it so please be careful.”
“He’s secretive about his feelings?” Hermione asked incredulously, “You’re so secretive about yours you’ve kept them from yourself.”
Malfoy raised his head after a moment and he was grinning, and Harry felt like he had just caught an enormous fucking golden Snitch.
“Hi Benjy,” he said, feeling more than a little guilty as he remembered the unanswered calls and letters. “Sorry about how long it’s been.”
“Sure you are,” Malfoy drawled. “To answer your question: I’m lying on my bed recovering from a long hard day of being Britain’s best Seeker. It’s a tough job but someone has to do it.”
“Right.” Davies’ thick eyebrows were drawn together. “Well, if you do need any extra support, make sure you ask for it. You’re important to this team.”
Harry sent Ron a silent plea for help, and he grimaced back sympathetically. “Harry, mate, I would love to back you up on this but honestly I think you’ve buggered it up a bit.”
He looked through the window and saw a pretty witch with long dark hair sitting looking back at him. Beth raised her hand cautiously and waved and he waved back, feeling idiotic. She looked like she was waiting before the firing squad.
“Good morning, Mr Potter!” she purred. Her long fingernails were painted shiny black, clicking alarmingly on the table.
On one hand, the group rounds were a great opportunity to play together as a team and see how they matched up against the other international sides. On the other hand, they required a ridiculous amount of travelling.
“Alright, thank you, Una,” Draco interrupted, sternly but not rudely. “That’s quite enough, I think.”
She didn’t look convinced. “It was rude of him to bring someone back to the room? I thought you two were getting on a bit better the past week?”
Sadly his maturity had its limits, which he reached when Malfoy began trying to argue that Harry had fudged the numbers on their race times.
Harry winced. “I’ve talked to her in the sense that I’ve played against her and last week some of her mail accidentally got delivered to Grimmauld Place and I forwarded it to her.”
He squeezed his eyes shut. “I’m going to kill you after this,” he said finally, turning to take his seat across from Skeeter as she watched him hungrily.
Harry watched as they walked away from him towards the house with a feeling like the floor had just dropped out from under his feet.
“Crikey, you’re Harry Potter, aren’t you?” he said finally, his mouth stretching into a wide smile that seemed to contain an unnatural amount of teeth.
“How about this? You apologise first, and then if I feel like it I’ll think about apologising too,” Malfoy replied, and Harry opened his mouth indignantly before seeing Malfoy’s smirk and realising that he was being teased.
The rest of the evening was the most comfortable Christmas he could remember having had for a very long time.
He had snatched the Snitch almost directly out from under Krum’s nose so he almost expected to get decked, but as they were all shaking hands he was shocked to see Krum smiling.
Catriona’s smile grew even wider. “Played against or been beaten by?” she asked in her broad Scottish brogue.
Camille smiled, completely unaware of the tension she was causing. “He is always saying Potter did this, Potter did that!”
“Bugger off.” Harry put down his book and muttered a quick Nox, leaving the room lit by Malfoy's wand alone. He closed his eyes and tried to look like he was asleep.
He didn’t even bother reading it, just threw it down and stormed out of the room. He could hear Ron and Angelina calling after him but he ignored them.
t-shirt that he had presumably designed and manufactured himself. He had tried, without much success, to convince Draco to wear one on the rare occasion that they attended games together.
“No,” Harry said immediately, tossing the letter back on the table. “No fucking way. I’m not doing some stupid little photo shoot to try to compete with Malfoy. You can tell
Draco tsked. “If you just cast a light Stasis on them when they were freshly pressed you wouldn’t have this problem. Or better yet, you could purchase some nicer robes.”
Hours later, Harry Apparated right to his front door and almost fell through it in exhaustion. The team talk had been even worse than normal. Ron had spent almost an hour speaking and Harry had seriously considered just going to sleep on one of the mats in the training room. He barely made it upstairs, and only had time to kick his boots off before he fell head-first onto his bed, fully dressed, and slipped into blissful darkness. His last thought was that he was definitely going to regret not taking off his jeans when he woke up.
“Sorry - you just told me that you, Draco Malfoy, dated a Muggle, and you expect me to act like that isn’t the most insane thing I’ve ever heard? Did they ask you to get a mobile?”
“You haven’t asked me for the traditional maid of honour and best man dance,” she said accusatorily.
After she had left there was a moment of unbearably awkward silence before Draco spoke quietly. “It was nice of you to stay with me last night but you don’t have to do this.”
“Unbelievable.” He gave a long-suffering sigh and Harry had about half a second to feel embarrassed before Malfoy started kissing him again. And, oh god, his hand wasn’t still any longer.
The Snitch was down very low, about a metre below the Scottish Keeper’s feet. Harry only looked at it for a second and then glanced back at Draco, but it was too late: as soon as they locked eyes, Harry knew that Draco had seen it too.
Instead of heading back to the hotel, they made their way down to the waterfront. It was a series of wide walkways lined with a few bars and boat sheds on one side and the harbour on the other. Small lights on the ground and in the eves of the buildings lit their way. They passed a few people as they walked, but it was quiet for the most part. The wind was strong enough that they would have been chilly without warming spells, but as it was it was rather pleasant.
She studied him doubtfully but luckily for Harry Ron chose that moment to remember that his next batch of pastries were ready to come out of the oven.
“Can you drive?” Harry was struggling to process this. It was so different from what he had expected.
Something in the conversation felt as though it had slipped sideways and out of control and so Harry made his escape from the bathroom as fast as he could and got dressed quickly, deciding that he’d get an early morning workout in.
“Oh.” Lucy blinked up at him, and then her brow furrowed. “You’re sort of my aunt. Will you teach me?”
“And where do you think you’re going?” He was so close that he didn’t even have to raise his voice for Harry to hear him.
“To answer your question, house-elves are usually very secretive about their offspring. Many pure-blood families aren’t keen to have children running around, as you can imagine. But my aunt had… a different attitude about it.” Draco smiled at him innocently.
Experimentally, he took Malfoy deeper until he could feel him right at the back of his throat, making himself gag a little.
“These are Una’s children, Kipsy and Luli.” Draco gestured at the ball, which, at the sound of his voice, separated into two tiny house-elves. Harry had never seen a house-elf that wasn’t an adult so he had no frame of reference to tell how old they were, but they looked like wide-eyed children with exceptionally long ears. When they caught sight of Harry and Draco, their eyes got even wider.
There was a lull in the conversation then and Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy again. He was looking back up at the sky and so Harry could only see him in profile but it was still fascinating to be this close to him and not trying to hex each other. The low light made his cheekbones look even more dramatic than usual, and Harry had the oddest urge to reach out and run a finger over the ridge of his nose and cheeks and feel the structure of the bone underneath. It looked so sharp that he wondered nonsensically if it would cut him. As he watched, Malfoy blinked slowly and his eyelashes were so long they almost brushed his eyebrows.
Malfoy’s eyebrows raised a bit at that and Harry was gratified to see his cheeks were going a bit pink.
He opened his eyes and found Malfoy looking down into his, haughty and challenging - but there was something else there, the faintest hint of vulnerability that gave Harry the confidence to reach up and pull Malfoy’s lips to his.
“Exactly, and then you’ll be in huge trouble again,” Hermione said sternly. “You’re smarter than this Harry.”
He was still grumpy when he climbed into the shower and for the millionth time that week he found his mind wandering. It was their last night on tour. If he wanted to talk to Malfoy, it would have to be tonight, before they left their odd little Quidditch bubble and returned to real life. But based upon their interactions today, Harry wasn’t sure he could actually get Malfoy to speak to him. Even if he could, he had no idea what he would say.
“What?” Harry was starting to get a bit annoyed by this whole thing, and his nose was getting awfully cold.
Puddlemore Park was uncharacteristically full for an early-season match, Harry noted as he got into position. He wondered how many were there to see he and Malfoy go up against each other - a fair few if the signs were anything to go by. He didn’t blame them.
Draco shook his head in amusement. “It’s possible. I always thought that your adoration of Cedric Diggory was more than platonic.”
It was a sentiment that Harry had heard more than once but something about hearing it from Benjy made Harry feel as though a weight had been lifted from his back. “Thanks,” he managed to croak.
“Fucking hell, I’m close - just a tiny bit tighter and…” Malfoy’s body tensed below him and Harry pulled away just in time to see his face and feel the way he shuddered as he came. Harry stroked him through it.
What he had said earlier stuck in Harry’s mind and before he could stop himself he had opened his mouth again. “So, are you dating someone then?”
In that moment he couldn’t be sure who had caught the Snitch, but lying there, staring up into Draco’s face, he found he didn’t care in the slightest.
Harry laughed and shook his head ruefully, moving on to study a large scene from the final moments of the 1974 World Cup.
“I said...” Harry flew closer so that he could prod Malfoy in the chest with his finger. “Fuck off, okay?”
They followed Una inside the gate and into a walled courtyard overlooked by the castle windows. It was carpeted in lush green grass with a stone pathway bisecting it, leading from the gate to the front door. Some sort of rain repellent spell kept the courtyard dry but not very warm so they were happy to reach the warmth of the inside.
Harry sat up a little too quickly and got a headrush. The Magpies had a game against the Wimbourne Wasps later that night but Harry hadn’t been expecting a text from him as they’d seen each other just the weekend before. He typed out a quick text back:
Benjy had been Harry’s mentor when he’d first been recruited to Puddlemere, as he had been their Seeker for nearly twenty years. He was about Harry’s height and build with a wide, friendly face, dark brown skin, and tight curls that were growing increasingly salt-and-pepper as he got further into his forties. He had retired a year before the 2002 World Cup and recommended Harry as his replacement for England. It had been one of the proudest moments of Harry’s life. Benjy’s opinion meant everything to him, which perhaps explained why Harry had been avoiding his calls for the past year.
He wondered if he should be hurt that Malfoy had left, but part of him understood. They couldn’t be caught together, and if they were naked in the same room it would be difficult to deny.
“Oh.” Draco blinked at him, brow furrowed. “I think I remember, but honestly my head hurts so much I can barely think at all.”
Harry always thought that everyone felt the way he did in the dressing room, that everyone was careful to make sure that they didn’t look at any of their teammates for too long when they were getting changed or walking around mostly naked. He knew that some of the lads were more comfortable than he was with hugging and touching each other but he’d never been a very touchy-feely person to begin with so that didn’t strike him as odd. He’d always put it down to never having been hugged as a child and being a generally awkward person. Davies had a habit of slinging his arm around your shoulders after a good game and ruffling your hair, and it always made Harry tense up. He’d be hyper-aware of not doing anything weird, almost holding his breath in case he made the situation uncomfortable.
He couldn’t wrap his head around Malfoy’s complete disregard for him. It was rude and disrespectful. He took a big bite of toast. Yeah, disrespectful, that was the word for it.
Oliver leapt up on a bench as they were packing their things and cleared his throat over the chatter. “Well done, team! I do have notes but they can wait until tomorrow. For now, I hear that we’re off to a Muggle bar, so I expect you all to behave yourselves.” A cheer went up amongst the group.
Draco explained that his great aunt had held very progressive views about the rights and powers of house-elf magic, and had insisted that Una and her mother be educated and provided for generously.
It was so out of character for Draco, whose emotions were never this close to the surface. Before he could think better of it, Harry began stroking Draco’s hand with his, and was rewarded with a soft sigh.
“Honestly, she drives me mad sometimes,” he griped but shot Harry a nervous smile. “She seems to think that the cake needs a fifth layer. I keep telling her that it’s too late but there’s no reasoning with her.”
He sipped his coffee, letting its warmth seep through him as he idly studied the planner he had tapped to his fridge.
Harry was starting to feel a little more comfortable so he offered to buy the next round, but just as he was making his way to the bar he found himself intercepted by a very large gentleman.
“Hang on.” Harry turned to face him fully. “That’s not how this works. You’re supposed to apologise too.”
To his surprise, Draco actually picked up, but he didn’t sound thrilled about it. “What is it?” he snapped.
As soon as he stepped into the water he regretted it, but he wasn’t about to let Draco win so he kept going, teeth chattering horribly. Draco, who had by this time come back up, watched him in amusement. There was nothing for it but to dive in, Harry decided, and so he did.
Harry didn’t have a response to this, so he looked around the room for something to comment on. “Your room’s smaller than mine usually is.”
Harry felt a roll in his stomach and barely made it to the wastepaper bin before his lunch came back up. The Australian witch watched him, her smile wavering only slightly.
“I wanted to ask… When you said to me at the hospital that Draco’s not as tough as he looks, what did you mean by that?”
Malfoy was standing with his teammates at the other end of the pitch, broom in hand, wearing the new black and dark grey Magpie robes. Harry’s navy blue gear suddenly felt bright and garish. Malfoy was off to the side a little from the rest of the team, tightening the straps on his wrist guards primly and Harry's stomach gave a lurch as he turned and they made eye contact for the first time in six years. He didn't register his feet carrying him over until Malfoy was within arm's reach.
The team had started training for the World Cup playoffs, as well as gearing up for the regular season with Puddlemere, so most of Harry’s mornings were spent on conditioning and fitness training, followed by strategy and drills practice in the afternoons. By the end of each day, he barely had enough energy to shuck his clothes and collapse into bed.
Harry thought about this. He couldn’t imagine just picking up some random person and going back to their flat. What if they sold the story to the papers? What if they were secretly a Death Eater and tried to kill him?
“No, you don’t,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Because if you did you’d know that they don’t take place in a bathroom.”
Harry managed to stammer out something resembling an affirmative, and followed him to where he was rooting through the fridge. He pulled out two small blue bottles of gin and summoned some glasses with a flick of his wand, pouring in the gin and a splash of tonic water, before handing it to Harry. He turned and walked out to the balcony. Harry followed again meekly.
He looked around the garden in desperation and found Harry and Granger watching his predicament with amusement. He gave them a dark look, but before he could rope them to help him in he was practically swarmed by the rest of the Weasley offspring demanding a tour of the dormitories.
With the key safely in his hand he made his way back to the old room, steeling himself for the inevitable awkward conversation. He pushed the door open gingerly, half hoping that Malfoy would have left, but there he was lying on his bed on top of the covers. At the sound of the door opening his head snapped up and he regarded Harry warily.
“I wouldn’t have given you a drink if I’d known you were already three sheets to the wind,” Malfoy said, not unkindly.
Hermione stood and wrapped him in a warm hug that smelled like new parchment and coffee. He took a deep breath and let himself relax into her arms for a second.
“The real question is what are you doing right now, Potter?” Malfoy asked, voice a little lower than before.
Harry turned and was met with the sight of the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen in real life draping herself over Malfoy.
Harry felt himself inexplicably moving closer rather than further away, and it must have taken Malfoy by surprise because his lips parted but nothing came out. Too late Harry realised that he was looking at Malfoy’s mouth, and when their eyes met again there was something in Malfoy’s that made a bolt of terror shoot through Harry.
“Did you build this?” he asked in amazement as they walked slowly around the perimeter, taking in the hoops and the stands.
Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t one of those, although he hadn’t had any idea he was a wizard at that point so it was really hard to say for sure. He forced himself to think about kissing a boy, Ron for example. The thought made him wrinkle his nose, too weird, and he knew how much Ron burped so there was a very high possibility that kissing him would mean getting close to one of those which was highly unappealing. A girl then, Harry considered kissing Hermione. It was better, but not by much, he couldn’t help thinking about how she would tell him off if he tried to kiss her and it stressed him out more than anything.
He slipped into his bed as silently as possible, though the boys had become so used to Ron’s snoring that he needn’t have worried, he probably could have let off fireworks in the room and they wouldn’t have stirred. He lay there staring at the top of his bed, mulling over the night's events.
“Great,” Baxter pulled out his headphones, not bothering to hide his annoyance at having his staring off into space-time interrupted. “What kind of phone do you currently have?”
“Not bad.” Harry turned to see Ginny surveying the scene with an appreciative look on her face. As best man and maid of honour they were the first people to arrive. “Our wedding would not have been this nice,” Ginny said, giving him a wry smile.
Draco responded with a rude gesture. The truth was he did rather like those shorts on Harry, ridiculously tiny as they were, as they showed off Harry’s wonderfully strong thighs. He wasn’t going to give Harry the satisfaction of admitting that, of course, but he did have a little peek when Harry turned around to root through his wardrobe. Like Draco, the past few years showed on Harry, in the light speckles of grey in his hair and the slight softness in his belly, but it hadn’t made him any less handsome. If anything, it only made Draco want him more.
That got Harry’s attention. He rolled out of the bed, his head and stomach protesting vehemently, and began the process of trying to find his things. Luckily for him Malfoy had already packed so he was able to locate his glasses, then his shoes and shirt without too much hassle.
“Very fragile,” he nodded wisely, and then caught sight of someone over Harry’s shoulder and his face broke into the widest smile Harry had ever seen on him. He turned to see who Krum was looking at and was surprised to see Charlie Weasley making his way through the crowd towards them.
As soon as he got to his new room he practically sprinted to the shower, tearing his sweaty clothes off as he went. He didn’t take an actual breath until he felt the water hit him, cold because he hadn’t given it time to heat up. The icy water felt wonderful on his overheated skin, and he leant his head against the tiles miserably, trying to catch his breath.
He knew he should leave then - that when Draco wasn’t drugged up he would find it odd that he’d stayed - but he was so tired, and Draco looked so pale and soft and sickly. He let himself drift back into sleep.
Harry was passing the gym on his way to the showers when he caught sight of a familiar blond head in the mirror. He doubled back and stuck his head through the door. Malfoy was on the rowing machine facing away from Harry. He was wearing a grey workout t-shirt that was stained dark with sweat. His arms and the back of his neck glistened, and the hair at the nape was dark and slightly curled. He was working slowly but powerfully, pulling and releasing the cord with tight control that made Harry’s mouth dry.
They were only a few metres above the ground now, and still diving. The Snitch hovered just above the grass, as if deciding which way to go, and Harry made a decision. He let go of his broom and dove, arm stretched out towards the little gold ball. Unfortunately, Draco made the same decision at the same time and they collided mid-air, landing heavily in a tangle of robes and limbs. They rolled a little way, mud flying up and coating both of them. The crowd were on their feet, holding their breaths.
The team flew down and landed on the grass. Somehow O'Flaherty had got Ritchie Coote in a headlock mid-air and they both fell off their brooms into a heap, laughing uproariously. They made an odd pair: she was a sturdy, good-natured Hufflepuff, and he was a scrawny, quiet Griffindor, but they’d made fast friends and in the year since Coote was recruited had become notorious for their antics. They played well together. She had power, he had accuracy, and together they were responsible for one of the lowest Bludger injury rates in the team’s history.
“Take your trousers off, you bastard,” he choked out, pulling his fingers away from Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy snorted, but let Harry’s hand go so that he could push it down the front of the trousers.
“Because I was trying to be nice,” Harry snapped back. “Just like I’ve been trying to be nice to you all week, you ungrateful prick.”
“He said that I jeopardised the team by abandoning the Snitch during the final and that if I can’t put my ego aside to be a good player he will have to look elsewhere for England’s Seeker.” Harry’s voice sounded hollow and croaky even to his own ears.
Harry felt a lump rise up in his throat but tried to smile back at him. “That’s great. That’s really great, mate. I’m happy for you. Not sure I believe you, but I’m happy for you.”
“Well, I’m far too tired to unpack all that tonight, but just so you know: denying yourself the things you want has never been the path to happiness, in my personal experience.”
The next painting depicted a young Catriona McCormack in her Pride of Portree gear, lifting the League Cup above her head and grinning from ear to ear.
Harry was drunk. He hadn’t intended to be but the drinks were free and he was miserable, which was always a recipe for disaster.
Talking got a bit difficult then because Draco pulled him back in for a good snog. Harry clutched onto him, revelling in the feeling of having him back in his arms. He felt as though he could burst with the joy of having Draco right there with him.
They headed back towards the chaos of the house. In the front yard, Bill, Charlie, George and Angelina were entertaining Teddy and Victoire Weasley with a Quaffle while Percy watched. As Harry and Ginny walked past, Charlie called out to them: “Come and show us how it’s done, number seven!”
“Is true,” Krum said matter-of-factly. “But still - was not way I wanted to win.” He paused for a second. “Wanted to visit hospital but Wood said no.”
Thursday arrived and Harry was genuinely looking forward to going to the Pickle and Pumpkin, right up to the moment he got to the front door. It wasn’t that he was scared to see his friends, necessarily. He just couldn’t stop imagining himself walking into the pub and everyone staring at him, laughing at him, judging him and every move he made. He could feel that familiar panic rising in his throat like vomit. Just as he was about to turn and leave he felt a large hand land on his shoulder.
Wood cut him off, “You’re playing the same position, you’ll have the same schedule. I’m not having this argument with you right now, Harry.”
“What? No, I think I saw it in the paper.” Harry felt all prickly with embarrassment. “What is your type then?”
A sudden wave of nausea had him staggering out of bed and to the bathroom to retch into the toilet for the next ten minutes. They had one more day in Wellington before they were due to head to Auckland for the final game. Harry would have dearly liked to go back to bed until it was time to leave, but downstairs there were hangover potions and breakfast.
Harry shook his head. The truth was that ever since his injury, his breakup with Ginny and the media frenzy following both, he hated going out. Even walking down Diagon Alley made him feel raw and overexposed like he wasn’t wearing any clothes.
Now, Harry wasn’t homophobic - at least, he was almost positive he wasn't. He’d always been fairly neutral about all the gay people he knew. Granted, it was mainly women - like O'Flaherty - but that was just because that’s how Quidditch was: there weren’t any openly gay male players in the UK and only one or two in Europe, but the league was practically crawling with lesbians. The only gay man he’d ever spent any actual time with was Charlie, but he hadn’t actually known he was for most of the time he’d known him.
The ceremony was short and sweet, and when they were done with their vows all of the wizards and witches raised their wands together, wrapping Ron and Hermione in beams of white light that bonded them as a married couple.
Ron cleared his throat. “Look, mate, you know we just want both of you to be happy. But this just all seems so out of the blue. Is this still about the World Cup?”
Harry nodded. It did feel like that. Like the rocks and the dirt hummed with something ancient and powerful. The only comparison he could think of was the feeling he had had when he visited Stonehenge with Hermione and Ron, but this felt even older and more powerful. Usually, when he cast he drew from his inner well of power, but here he felt as though he could draw from a blade of grass or a stone in the dirt and feel the same power.
“Or not,” Draco turned to look at him finally, and Harry felt a sudden chill. Draco didn’t look angry or upset, just perfectly blank and cold.
“Jesus, Draco…” he breathed. He was so close he could feel his leg shaking. He tapped Malfoy on the shoulder as a warning, as he was unable to form a coherent sound, but it only seemed to encourage him.
Una served them up a hearty breakfast of porridge and eggs on toast, with huge steaming mugs of the best coffee Harry had ever tasted and then disappeared too. Harry and Draco ate in silence for a few minutes, sitting on either side of the long wooden table that ran the length of the kitchen.
He felt a little guilty for using that excuse, especially when he saw the flash of concern in Angelina’s eyes, but it worked a treat and within ten minutes he was back at the hotel.
Draco smirked, and it did extremely odd things to Harry’s stomach. “Ah, but the difference is, I can do that because I’m extremely talented.”
Harry felt Malfoy’s eyes on him. They were an hour into the game and both teams were playing excellently, but Harry could barely pay attention because Malfoy was everywhere, watching. It made Harry furious, and not the useful kind of furious. He could feel Malfoy hovering just out of his periphery, and it felt like he was breathing down Harry’s neck. Harry twisted and flew up, trying to put some space between them.
The Cannon’s Beater had turned and Campbell had smashed into one of the hoop poles with a horrible sound that echoed throughout the arena. The Beater recovered quickly, but the same could not be said of Campbell who was flying jerkily down to the grass.
“There’s no winning for me - can’t you see that? If you win, you won’t need me anymore. And if you lose...” Draco’s voice wavered slightly at the end and he got to his feet quickly. “I have to go. I’m expected back at camp.”
That was the curse of the Seeker, Benjy always used to say: all the glory, all the blame and no in-between.
Part of him wanted to confront him, but about what? He couldn’t very well accuse Malfoy of sexually confusing him. It was impossible, really, and thinking about it made Harry’s head ache.
“What are you overthinking about?” Ginny’s voice cut through his thoughts and he found her looking up at him.
In the centre of the party the gaggle of six-year-olds who would make up much of the first class, chased one another around the lawn, squealing with joy and excitement that Draco felt reflected 100 times over inside him as he looked out onto the rest of his life.
It was still early so once Harry had settled into his room he decided to do a little exploring. A door on the left wall led to a small water closet with a bathtub and loo, and the door on the right was locked. He knew he shouldn’t, but his curiosity took over and he found himself trying an Alohomora on the lock. The door popped open with a soft click and Harry was surprised to find himself looking into Draco’s room.
Malfoy pursed his lips but gave no reply, and Harry took a large bite of his sandwich. They ate in silence for a few minutes before Malfoy finished his food and got up without saying anything. Harry watched with a sense of accomplishment as he stalked out of the cafeteria. He had got the last word, and Malfoy hadn’t tried to hex him. He counted that as a win.
Harry clenched his jaw. He hadn’t heard those particular ones but it wasn’t as if he hadn’t thought it was a possibility. “I think if the Magpies are desperate enough for that, they shouldn’t be in the league.”
Malfoy let out a surprised snort of laughter, which made Harry laugh, their shoulders bumping together as they sniggered like schoolboys.
The first picture was of an older woman, probably in her sixties, on a broom with a tiny blond child perched in front of her. As he watched, the woman did a loop-the-loop, holding the boy tightly, making his face break into an enormous grin. The brass plate on the bottom of the picture said: Aunty Delila and Draco - first time on a broom.
“You’re hot,” Draco countered, his face so soft and fond that Harry had to forcibly stop himself from touching him.
“I thought you worked in entertainment news, not sports,” he said, a bit nastily. “What, the rumour mill running a bit low on poor sods to prey on?”
Wood, who had been listening intently, gave the team a stern look. “No embarrassing me in front of the Australians, okay?”
The Snitch was hovering high, just above the Magpies' third goal, and as he watched it darted further to the left. A large part of the job of Seeker was to be able to spot the Snitch without alerting the other Seeker to that fact, and Harry was good at it if he did say so himself. He allowed his eyes to sweep the rest of the pitch, remaining still and relaxed.
Instead, he changed into some warm clothes and lay down on the bed, staring at the ceiling. It was one of those horrible popcorn ceilings and it made Harry feel deeply depressed. For the first few years of his career, he’d been thrilled with every new place he got to visit, but now that he had no one to tell it all seemed a lot less fun.
He wanted to see if Malfoy’s lips were as cool and soft as his cheek but unfortunately, his eyes wouldn’t focus and so he wasn’t sure which of the three Malfoys in front of him was the real one. He used his hand to feel around until he located Malfoy’s mouth. He felt quite proud of himself for that practical solution.
“You spend all your spare time holed up in the hotel room like a shut-in. It’s strange,” Malfoy said bluntly.
It was a long room with a low, curved stone ceiling - not low enough that Harry had to worry about bumping his head, but it definitely wasn’t designed for human use. Una was leaning over a pot on an enormous wood-burning stove set back in a stone alcove which took up an entire wall, with copper pots and pans hanging above it. At her feet was what looked, at first glance, like a ball of limbs.
He nodded, giving her what he hoped was a reassuring smile and then motioned for her to accompany him to a quieter part of the bar. With some distance between him and Malfoy he felt like he could breathe a bit better.
The Burrow was filled almost to bursting with Weasleys and their children and spouses, spilling out into the front and back gardens despite the chill in the air. They seemed to occupy every available surface, and a few that probably shouldn’t have been available. As Harry made his way up the drive he spotted George chasing a few of his nieces around the garden with his coat pulled up over his head, pretending to be a dementor.
“Are you just going to watch?” Draco asked, and somehow the little hint of embarrassment in his voice made Harry ache all over.
It all started with a commotion at the end of the Slytherin table during breakfast. Harry couldn’t really tell what was going on until little Colin Creevey ran up to him, looking close to tears.
Malfoy was really smiling now, and Harry couldn’t help himself. He reached for him again, and this time there was no pause. Malfoy was on him the moment their lips met.
Malfoy’s neck still tasted like sweat and tequila and Harry basked in it, becoming more and more aware of Malfoy’s ragged breathing beneath him.
Because it was a wizarding hotel, Harry was able to Apparate directly into the lobby. He’d stayed here plenty of times before so he knew exactly where he was going as he headed for the elevator and rode it to the fifth floor.
“Malfoy!” Harry interrupted in a slight panic. “I’m not a little kid. I know what… what you’re talking about.”
writers had cooked up for him, much to the joy of his team’s management. He never thought he’d miss it.
He sent her a grateful look and downed it in one, grimacing at the bitter flavour. Angelina watched him with amusement, before turning back to her book. As he waited for the potion to take effect he studied her face for any sign that she’d seen or heard about any of the things he’d done the night before.
A note about the game of Quidditch: It makes no sense and I have done my best to rectify this but have probably just made it worse, so try not to overthink it!
Granger, unlike her husband, had warmed up to Draco extremely quickly and much to his chagrin Draco had found himself growing increasingly fond of her too — not that he would ever admit that in words.
They stood in front of the large stone arch in front of the training pitch, a thick red ribbon strung across it. Draco could feel Harry’s stress rolling off him, so he reached out and gripped his hand. “It’s time,” he murmured. Harry nodded. They held out their wands and together drew them up and then down, severing the ribbon with a swoosh.
On nights like this, when the rest of his life yawned out in front of him and made him feel small and anxious, he would stay behind after the team had left and work out in the gym until his body was so tired that he wouldn’t remember falling asleep.
“I’m thinking about it,” Malfoy replied, taking another sip of his drink. A droplet of condensation dripped from the glass and ran down into the dip in his collarbone, and Harry finally had to look away before he did something stupid.
Draco’s eyebrow twitched and then he turned and strode out of the room. “Hang on, where are you going?” Harry called after him but it was no use. He sighed and went after him.
“Probably not?” Malfoy asked, and Harry knew he was being goaded into sharing but he found that he didn’t mind. It would be nice to talk about it with someone who wasn’t Ginny’s sister or friend.
They fell into a sort of routine now that the regular season was well and truly back; whenever they were both in London for games, which was about once a month or so, Harry would wait for Draco to text him and when he did he would floo directly into his bedroom in his London flat.
which caused Harry to jump so hard he nearly toppled off his perch on the toilet seat, as Filch kicked one of the cubicle doors open. Malfoy moved with lightning speed, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist in a vice-like grip, and clamping his other hand over Harry’s mouth to muffle his squeak of surprise.
Harry turned to find Malfoy watching him archly. “Don’t worry, Potter. If I wanted to hex you, I’d do it on the pitch.” He turned on his heel and stalked away.
who was the first person to hear this silly little idea. A huge thank you to the mods of this fest for all your hard work, and for all the extensions.
“It just seems weird, don’t you think?” Harry wished he could just shut up but the words were spilling out of their own accord.
The doors opened again a second later and he stalked out, through the lobby and out into the night again. It wasn’t midnight yet so the level of drunkenness on the street had yet to become unbearable. For a moment, Harry considered going back out to a bar. He tried to remember the direction of the pub they’d been to earlier in the night but his stomach began to rumble loudly, so he decided to make his way up the street towards a brightly coloured sign that promised coffee and cakes.
Harry rolled his eyes and came over to sit on the end of the huge bed. “No, you couldn’t. How’re you feeling this morning?”
“Awww Potter, are you worried we’ve damaged your new headshots?” He held up the camera and snapped a picture of Harry’s furious expression.
Even when he was snoring softly, Harry didn’t let go. He wasn’t sure how long he sat there for or when he fell asleep but when he was jolted awake by the mediwitch  coming in, the sky outside was dark, and they were still holding hands.
Draco had a movement that looked like it was meant to be a shrug but turned into a wince halfway through. “Just wonderful, thanks.”
The questions went on like this for a few more minutes before the Puddlemere spokeswoman finally called it to an end and he was able to excuse himself, head throbbing and in a foul mood. Instead of heading back to the changing rooms where his team would be gathering he turned the other way and walked back out towards the pitch.
“Ah.” Malfoy’s confused expression was becoming smugger by the second and it made Harry want to deck him.
He had just landed and began to walk towards the changing rooms when he saw someone standing in the doorway. He paused, and almost turned around and walked away when Pansy Parkinson stepped out of the shadows.
He’d wondered whether the connection between them had weakened over the past few weeks, but as he felt Draco’s strong legs intertwine with his under the water, any lingering doubts dissolved. It was a lovely kiss, not hurried or drunken like so many of theirs had been, just long and gentle and sweet. They kissed until Harry could no longer feel his hands, lips, or, most alarmingly, his lower body.
“No,” Harry had to give him that. However, the idea of it happening again, or turning into something else, seemed less like a recipe for disaster and more like a large sign pointing directly at a cake that read ‘eat for guaranteed catastrophe.’ “It’s a terrible idea.”
“I’m fine. Happy?” Draco's voice was carefully blank. “I’m sorry for not replying to your text but this is exactly what I didn’t want, Potter. I don’t need the stress.”
He glanced at her tentatively. “Uh, yeah, I’m glad I did too. I mean… it’s been better than I expected.”
The rest of the morning was taken up by tours of the grounds and facilities, which had all been renovated and improved over the past two years so that they were of the highest standard. The building next to the practice pitch had been converted to dormitories for older students, while the equipment shed had been updated to include brooms and equipment for all ages. The pitch was freshly mowed and the hoops painted.
“Do you ever think things would have been better if we’d never been together?” she asked quietly, picking at the blanket they were sitting on.
“What are you doing here?” Malfoy leaned a strong shoulder against the doorframe. He wasn’t wearing a shirt. Harry did his best not to notice. He was standing so close that Harry could have counted the flecks of silver in his eyes if he wanted. Which he didn’t.
“Potter drinks for free,” Wood announced, to whoops from the team. “If I see him paying for anything tonight, you’ll all be up at six for drills tomorrow morning.”
“You’re being weird.” Malfoy broke the silence after a few minutes, glaring at him. “Why are you just watching me get ready like some kind of pervert?”
He was sure he hadn’t bought it, so the shopkeeper must have slipped a copy in when Harry wasn’t looking. Attempting to dissect why he’d thought Harry would want it was enough to send him back into a spiral so he focused on the magazine instead.
On reflection, Harry should have probably prepared himself better for how strange it would be to hold another man’s dick in his hand, but he had never been known for his forward-thinking skills. It was hot in his hand, both soft and hard. After twenty-four years of only holding his own, he decided it felt a little like touching his arm after he’d laid on it for too long. He looked down at it. It was pinker and paler than Harry’s own, but at the end of the day it was a dick and a dick was a dick.
He hesitated for a moment outside room 104 until his impulsivity overtook his overthinking and he found himself knocking on the door.
“Of course he didn’t.” She rolled her eyes. “He’s too proud, and he would never want it to seem like he’s using his relationship with you to benefit his career.”
Malfoy made quick work of Harry’s shirt and pants. He soon found himself completely naked sitting on the floor with his back against the foot of the bed, with Draco Malfoy kneeling between his legs. In one quick movement he sucked Harry into his mouth, knocking the air out of him.
Each country designed their own camp, and Harry had to admit that they were quite entertaining to see. Germany’s, for example, seemed to have been based on a medieval village. A small group of wooden buildings which looked a little bit like gingerbread houses were clustered around the square. If Harry had walked closer he would have seen a practice pitch and probably a gym of some kind, but he kept moving.
“Good morning, darling.” Pansy leaned in to kiss Draco on both cheeks before turning to Harry with a pained expression. “Potter,” she acknowledged, nose in the air.
“Alright, Mr Potter, I only have ten minutes so let’s make this fast.” She paused, tapping a long dark nail against the desk. “How can I help you?”
Harry felt the usual pang that came with thinking of Cedric, and then the larger pang that came from remembering anyone who’d died in the war. “Right,” he blinked at the ceiling.
“It is not!” Harry was properly blushing now. “It’s for me.” He’d forgotten Ginny’s ability to see through him like a window.
“He probably won’t turn up anyway,” Ron added helpfully. “He’ll snitch to Filch like he did last year.”
He didn’t think about Malfoy at all for the next hour, until he went for a slash. As he was walking down the corridor towards the bathroom, he saw Malfoy and a brown-haired man he didn’t recognise talking closely in a little alcove. For a moment he thought that they were having an argument, but then Malfoy said something and the man laughed and leant in a tiny bit closer.
The shopkeeper babbled away as he totted up Harry’s purchases. Harry was only half-listening, though, distracted by the pile of brand new
Harry hovered above the game. Sometimes when he did this it was like he could see every moving part of the game, like he could predict what would happen next.
Skeeter didn’t look the slightest bit embarrassed but a few other reporters did. “But you’ve never publicly discussed when and how the relationship started.”
He splashed some water on his face and looked up at himself in the mirror. He didn’t look too bad but his robes, which had been perfectly pressed when he left the house, were looking a tad rumpled. He tried to fix them with his wand to no avail.
She looked unsure but began typing on her computer. “Alright, sir, I’ve added the new room to your booking. Here’s your key.”
They were still entangled, Harry on his back and Draco leaning over him. Harry looked up and their eyes met.
Harry couldn’t help cracking a rueful smile. “You’re probably not too far off there, to be fair. But you didn’t answer my question.”
“Well that’s good because I also…what I mean to say is, I feel the same way.” Draco managed, still looking dazed.
“Last night! I got up to get some water and your bed was empty so I figured you’d taken him up on his offer!” Ron bounced from foot to foot impatiently. Now he had his glasses on, Harry could see that his red hair was sticking up in all directions so he must have only just woken up.
“It’s your own fault for not bringing your broom. You’ll note how generous I’m being by using a Firebolt 1994.” He pushed off effortlessly and hovered lazily a few meters above Harry’s head.
“A Weasley jumper? Sweet fucking Merlin, Potter.” Malfoy sounded exasperated. The rumble that had been in his voice a second ago was gone. Harry could tell he’d said something wrong, but didn’t know what.
“Draco.” He tried it out and found that it felt both easier and much more dangerous, especially when Malfoy gave him that wolfish grin and sucked Harry back into his throat. “Oh, fucking hell, Draco.”
Having completed his errands, he decided to pop into the bookshop to see if he could find something for Hermione. As soon as he stepped in, however, he was instantly distracted. Along one wall was the largest collection of Quidditch magazines he’d ever seen, in every language he’d ever seen.
“Oh lovely, Permanent Facial Disfigurement for Beginners.” He crinkled his nose in disgust. “That’s fucking bleak.”
Ron cleared his throat gruffly. “I suppose that just about covers it.” He reached out and patted Harry’s shoulder firmly. “I just wanted to say that even though it’s Malfoy, I’ll make an effort to like him.”
A blonde woman in the corner raised her hand. “Can you respond to the rumours that he was picked because the Magpies knew he’d get into your head?”
“...totally unacceptable, please see previous correspondence… Harry!” She cut herself off and beckoned him in, flicking her wand at the quill so that it froze mid scrawl. “Sorry about the wait. We’re in the middle of contract negotiations with a Russian player's agent who I swear is part Nogtail.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry snapped, more harshly than was strictly necessary. “The away team changing rooms are on the other side.”
They were so wrapped up in each other that they didn’t hear footsteps outside the door or the handle turning. It wasn’t until the hinges squeaked in warning that they leapt apart.
Lennox Campbell was the Seeker for both the Montrose Magpies and the Scottish National Team and, while he’d let them down a few times in the past, he seemed to be having somewhat of a second wind this season.
“Oh,” he blinked. “Yeah, you look, erm - really, really nice.” He gave a thumbs up, which he hoped looked less awkward than it felt. “Ron will be really happy,” he tacked on for good measure.
“Sorry, Cap,” he called, flying as far as possible from the hoop in question. Hovering above the pitch he watched his teammates zipping around below him. The Chasers Angelina Johnson and Graham Montague were running drills with Keeper Grant Page and Ron, who had just been promoted to junior coach, was observing and occasionally directing them. Cormac McLaggen - who was, much to his own annoyance, the reserve Keeper - was at the other end of the pitch dodging the Bludgers, which Beaters Maxine O'Flaherty and Ritchie Coote were enthusiastically whacking in his direction.
He chose a pair of black dress pants and a white shirt but left his dress robes hanging up — he’d put them on later when the formal festivities started. Just as he was pulling on his shoes Harry came in, still in his stupid little shorts and a hooded sweatshirt.
“Like I said: things are different in Europe,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. He hesitated for half a second. “And I dated a Muggle for a bit.”
Harry let that news settle for a minute. He was a little taken aback to find that he wasn’t shocked. It was like a little puzzle piece in his head had slotted into place. “Oh, right,” he said finally.
“Oh, but I think you do.” Malfoy’s voice was low and teasing. Harry couldn’t figure out if he was being made fun of or not. He decided it was safer to assume that he was.
Harry realised belatedly that his other hand had closed tightly around the other stud and it was cutting into his palm. To distract himself from his racing heart he examined the cufflink. It was much nicer than anything Harry owned, two silver disks inlaid with green stones, connected by a silver chain. On the back of the larger disk there was a little inscription, and Harry rubbed his thumb over it but before he could examine it any more closely Draco plucked it from his fingers.
After an age, he finally pushed his fingers past the elastic and wrapped his hand around Harry, who had to bite down hard on his cheek to keep from embarrassing himself. Malfoy’s hand was so much bigger than a girl's, maybe even bigger than Harry’s own, and rough and strong from years of gripping a broom.
He popped it easily and poured them each a glass. “Merry Christmas,” he said, clinking their glasses together. They drank together in easy silence before Malfoy finally spoke again. “I feel I’m obligated to ask: are you freaking out?”
“Oh, stop, George. You’re embarrassing them,” Angelina chastised as she wrapped Harry in a hug. “Hello love.”
“Take a deep breath Colin, what’s happened?” Hermione said, a lot more patiently than Harry felt. Colin took a huge gulp of air.
. He padded carefully down the hallway, taking care to keep his footsteps light so that his tattered old trainers didn’t squeak on the grey tiles. The end of the hallway curved around a corner, with a storage cupboard on one side, and then opened up to the bathroom itself. Harry peeked around and caught sight of Malfoy’s shock of white-blond hair and black and green robes. As it was after-hours the only lights in the bathroom were low burning torches in the wall sockets that cast long shadows, giving the high-ceiling room a cave-like quality. In this light, the blond boy looked tiny and somehow even paler than usual, as if Harry could see right through him if he looked hard enough. He was standing in the middle of the bathroom, wand in one hand, nibbling anxiously on the thumbnail of the other. Harry could see a pair of checkered pyjama pants poking out from under his robes and for some reason, it relieved a bit of his anxiety and inexplicably he had to press his lips together to stop a nervous giggle escaping. Honestly, he was a bit impressed that he’d actually shown up. He considered for a moment leaving or hexing Malfoy while he was invisible, but his conscience got the better of him. As far as he could see Malfoy hadn’t brought any of his cronies with him unless Crabbe or Goyle were hiding in one of the cubicles waiting to jump out at Harry the moment he revealed himself.
Draco nodded at Weasley and she gave him a wide grin. They weren’t yet bosom friends but she was important to Harry, and even he had to admit that she was difficult to hate.
“Don’t worry mate, you’ll be great. Bloody Malfoy doesn’t stand a chance.” Harry pulled the covers down and smiled at him weakly.
The man in question was just across the table from Angelina and Harry, chatting to someone Harry recognised as the mediwizard for the opposing team. He was tall, broad-shouldered and tanned, with an easy smile. They were laughing now, and as Harry watched, Malfoy placed a hand on the other man’s shoulder, grinning up at him. Harry had a bitter taste in his mouth and had to force himself to look away, downing about half his drink in one go.
Harry snorted in disbelief - that was understating it a bit. He knew he should stop reading for the sake of his sanity but his curiosity got the better of him.
Honestly, the whole situation was starting to feel slightly ridiculous, and more than a little embarrassing. It was clear that neither boy was willing to strike first and the longer they waited the more they both began to feel a bit silly, standing there in the bathroom.
Draco turned on him again. “Do you want to know what I think? I think that you felt bad after losing the Cup, you wanted to make yourself feel better, and I was there. You think that the moment you win everything will be fixed, that you’ll feel whole again. But I don’t see how you plan to fit me into that.”
Harry made a very embarrassing noise and lurched forward. Malfoy’s mouth was salty from sweat and his hair was damp when Harry pushed his fingers through it, but it was anything but disgusting, especially when Malfoy gripped onto the front of Harry’s t-shirt and made that sound that undid him.
Harry nodded, still slightly befuddled, and followed Draco into the cab. Sure enough, instead of a regular navigation system, there was just a steering wheel protruding from the smooth dashboard, presumably so that if they began careening off the cliff one could redirect the vehicle. It wasn’t an overly reassuring sight, if Harry was honest, but Draco didn’t seem nervous so he let it go and closed his door.
Malfoy turned his head, just slightly, to glance at Harry, the light from the room illuminating the sharp features on the right half of his face. “Alright,” he said expectantly.
He sat in his bunk, blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He’d seen Draco from afar at dinner the night before, chatting to some of the Scottish players. Harry watched the back of his head as he leaned in to say something to the person sitting next to him. It felt too much like being back at school, so Harry looked away quickly, embarrassed. It was pathetic how much he missed him. How had he ever thought they could just not speak for the whole competition?
Malfoy huffed out a tiny breath he had obviously been holding, and the motion drew Harry’s eyes to the other boy’s lips. Harry felt something flip in his stomach that he’d never experienced before, like a monarch butterfly fluttering its wings for the first time as it emerges from the chrysalis. The feeling made his head swim and his mouth dry, and he felt more than a little bit faint. His eyes flicked back to Malfoy’s and somehow he knew, he just knew, that Malfoy’s veins were thrumming with the same electricity. He tightened his grip on Malfoy’s robes.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Look, I’m not going to argue that I didn’t provoke you, but it’s all part of the performance.” He noticed Harry’s furrowed brow and paused. “Don’t tell me you think you have to be Harry Potter: Quidditch Star twenty-four hours a day?”
“Cosy.” He heard Malfoy moving about on the other end of the phone, like he was getting comfortable, and then he was back, somehow sounding even closer than before.
Harry closed his eyes and willed himself not to get annoyed, and when he opened them again Malfoy had thankfully turned his back on him. He watched in silence as Malfoy went about his complicated and frankly exhausting morning routine, a full hour of which took place in the bathroom.
Harry felt another wave of nausea and leant forward to rest his head against the seat of the toilet. It was lovely and cool and he closed his eyes. “I’m just going to rest my eyes for a second and then we’ll finish this conversation…”
“That’s because that is the character he’s playing. You need to ask yourself who the character you are playing is.”
At the mention of Ginny’s name Harry felt a familiar lurch in his stomach but he swallowed it down and flew back and forth across the pitch, halfheartedly practising feints and manoeuvre until Davies called time.
Harry scoffed and tried to shoulder past Malfoy but he stepped in front again, using his height advantage to trap Harry. “Let me go,” Harry ground out.
“Look, if we just blend it here - no, Mrs Granger, don’t take that off!” Padma was red faced and flustered. Harry began to back out of the room, but before he could Ginny spied him and grabbed his arm with surprising strength.
He watched as Malfoy swooped over the crowd and winked - winked! - at a woman waving a black Montrose Magpies flag, and rolled his eyes.
“Look, Potter, I don’t need you to feel guilty about anything. I actually think you were right to end things when you did.” Draco’s tone was even but he looked very tired.
Even Hermione had turned to look at him with an encouraging smile. Harry wasn’t sure who had died and made him the Hogwarts anti-bullying officer, but it felt supremely unfair, he was the last person the Slytherins would do anything for, especially Malfoy. He looked over at the table again and saw the boy in question looking back at him with an extremely unattractive sneer on his face.
The next morning Harry was awoken to the unbearable sound of a Tempus clanging. He blinked, the world a blur like it always was without his glasses. Even in this state, he could tell it wasn’t time to wake up yet.
Draco’s face did something funny, but he smiled slightly and came over to sit at the other end of the window seat, burrowing his sock-covered feet under the quilt. Together they watched the sun come up over the hill and bathe the brutal landscape in warmth. The silence was companionable, Harry realised. There was no pressure to say or do anything.
Harry turned back to him, rage making him feel lightheaded and shaky. He pulled up so that they were face to face. “Do you know what…”
“Perhaps I’ll join you,” Malfoy said, a little too casually. Harry swallowed and nodded, unable to think of an intelligent reply. Malfoy stepped closer. “That would be fun, wouldn’t it? In the shower together, in front of everyone. Not able to touch or even look at each other.”
She looked up from her breakfast and gave him a wide smile. “Good morning. You have to try the pancakes, they're insane.”
He slipped off the invisibility cloak and shoved it into one of the maintenance closets. Steeling himself, he rolled his small shoulders back and tried to stand up as tall as possible. He gripped his wand in his pocket and then stepped into the bathroom. Malfoy wasn’t looking at him so he cleared his throat, causing the Slytherin to jump about a foot.
Pansy Parkinson and Parvati Patil were the first to arrive, one after the other. They had become reluctant friends the past few years, primarily bonding over their shared frustration at Draco and Harry.
Harry tried to ignore him but it was tough when he was so close. “Why don’t you spend more energy on catching the Snitch and less on bothering me?”
Just as he was almost mentally prepared to get out of bed there was a thump — Harry was back, wrapping himself back around Draco and holding him so tightly he could feel his bones complaining.
It was hard to think objectively about it because he was still hurt and angry with Draco, but the worst part of it all was the little voice in his head that wondered if he was right. Would he lose interest when he won? He wanted to say no but part of him wasn’t sure. He’d spent so much of the past four years working towards this moment, and being so certain that it would fix everything.
“Hello,” he started, shocked by how hoarse his voice sounded to his own ears. “I’d like to get a room. Well, I already have a room, but I’d like another one.”
Parvati’s office was on the 15th floor of a wizarding office building in central London, with a wall of glass that overlooked the Thames. It was spacious and modern, and when he walked in she was sat behind a long glass desk dictating a letter to a frantically scribbling quill.
Malfoy was very obviously used to being in charge, and that was fine by Harry. He enjoyed the way he used the tips of his fingers to adjust Harry’s jaw and obeyed willingly.
Priya Patil was a tall, striking woman with black hair that fell to her waist and sharp dark eyes that could make even the bravest witch or wizard shake in their boots. Harry remembered vividly the day she had walked up to him at the Ministry when he’d been leaving the Auror’s office.
The domestic Portkey was nowhere near as bad as the international one, but it still made Harry feel nauseous, and he had to swallow hard to stop himself from dry retching when the world finally stopped spinning.
The Portkey delivered them to a small stone building on the mainland, which was good because it was absolutely bucketing down outside. To Harry's astonishment, there was a large dark green vintage-looking car in the little building with them. It looked like the pictures that Mr Weasley had shown him of a Roadster from the 1920s with it’s long bonnet and big, round headlights.
had managed to get such a flattering photo of Malfoy moments after an international Portkey trip. The last time Harry had returned from a trip abroad, they’d published a photo of him so hideous that George had had it framed and given it to Ron for Christmas.
The United States had raised a few eyebrows with theirs. They’d designed what was essentially an enormous stadium-shaped hotel with a pitch in the middle for their squad. It took up so much of their allocated space that they’d been forced to remove a few of the outside bits, making it look even more like a fortress. They had also been forced to place extra strength silencing charms over it as they’d received so many complaints about their noise levels. Even as Harry walked past he could hear some of the commotion emanating from the middle.
Harry wondered if he should leave them to it, but before he could escape Ginny looked up at him over Hermione’s shoulder. “Oi, you. Get in here, idiot.”
The photo was bad - extremely bad - but if possible the words emblazoned across his chest were even worse.
“He’s rehabilitating his image, and doing a damn good job of it too.” She tapped her quill against her lip thoughtfully. “This has got Parkinson’s grubby little fingers all over it.”
It was the pressure from the World Cup, he told himself. It had nothing to do with Draco. Things with Draco— with Malfoy had gone the way they were supposed to, the way he’d always known they would.
Harry didn’t know exactly what she meant but the fondness in her eyes sent warmth all the way down to his toes. Or maybe that was the alcohol.
Harry hadn’t taken Dreamless Sleep in months but he needed to turn his brain off, so he grabbed a vial out of his bag and downed it. It took a few moments to take hold and the only thing he could think of before the potion took hold was the look in Malfoy's eyes when he looked down at him.
Harry was shaking his head before she even finished. “Sorry, I just don’t think it’s a good idea.” Hermione and Ron shared a concerned look, which annoyed Harry even more. “Don’t look at me like that.”
He had no choice then but to get back on his broom and continue the game with the Magpies' reserve Seeker. He barely remembered the rest of the game, except that he spent most of it avoiding Davies’ furious gaze. The reserve Seeker was useless, which was the only reason Harry was able to catch the Snitch - it was more muscle memory than a conscious move.
Ron nodded. “That makes sense, I guess.” He paused for a moment and then spoke again, quieter. “Do you feel protective over him?”
Harry rubbed his palms over his face in frustration. “So that’s why he was upset? Because I didn’t acknowledge him publicly?”
Malfoy moved down and began to kiss Harry’s neck, and Harry became painfully, horribly aware of how turned on he was. He gripped Malfoy’s stupid hair to ground himself more than anything, tipping his head back shamelessly to allow him to lick all the way up to that thin, sensitive skin behind his ear.
“Did you hear what I said?” he asked impatiently, trying to regain some semblance of control over the situation.
He was right. There is truly nothing worse, in Harry’s humble opinion, than waking up wearing jeans and a belt. It felt similar to what he imagined it would be like to wake up in a straitjacket. He tried to get them off without opening his eyes, but he was still lying on his front so he only succeeded in nearly falling in a tangled heap on the floor. With deep annoyance, he opened his eyes and winced at the morning light streaming through his open curtains. He finally managed to get his jeans and t-shirt off, throwing them on the floor and immediately flopping back onto the bed. He closed his eyes again, trying desperately to slip back into sleep, but to no avail. He’d entered the land of the living, and his head hurt - like it always did. In frustration, he threw one of his pillows at the window. This, unfortunately, caused one of his potted plants to topple over, souring his mood even further.
Harry was equally gratified and disturbed to see Malfoy looking rather haggard at the Portkey terminal in the morning. He had slept in uncharacteristically late and obviously rushed through his morning routine. Harry, on the other hand, had managed to squeeze in a workout and a full breakfast. He felt quite pleased with himself.
Harry didn’t have the energy to snap back at him. “The real issue is that I forgot my cufflinks and Mrs Patil is going to hex me.”
A while later, once the reception had got into full swing, Harry was making his way back to the bar when he almost walked headfirst into Krum. The Bulgarian reached a big hand out and steadied him. “Watch out, no more head knocks,” he said with a laugh.
He cleared his throat. “Now, I don’t want any of you to collapse in shock, but I wanted to say that I’m really proud of you all." The team let out a roar. “Alright, alright, I’m serious. When I took over this job they said we’d be bottom of the league for years, and we’ve proved them wrong.”
Patil and Pansy had joined the rest of the party and seemed to be in the middle of a furious argument. Draco carefully avoided being roped in.
He found Draco in the recently cleaned sitting room, inspecting a bookshelf that, if Harry was honest, he’d never looked at. Harry glanced self-consciously around the room. It had certainly improved in the past few months but there was still a yellow tinge to the curtains and a musty smell that he was sure wouldn’t go unnoticed.
Draco was nowhere to be seen, Harry could only assume that he had gone to take his regular early morning bath, so Harry was forced to drag himself out of the warmth to retrieve the letter in the bird’s beak.
Angelina Johnson and George Weasley were the next through, glowing with the excitement of the very freshly engaged. Draco liked Angelina immensely and thus had grown to like George. He was awfully loud, but Draco had to admit that he adored Angelina and made her very happy. He hadn’t missed a Puddlemere match in the two years they had been together and was often seen wearing a
Harry stayed in the changing rooms, twisting his gloves in his hands until the rest of the team had showered and left. He was so furious - at Malfoy, at Davies, but mostly at himself. He couldn’t believe he’d let the team down again. His stomach was in knots, rolling with embarrassment and anger, he couldn’t even look his teammates in the eye as they had quietly filed past him. Davies had patted his shoulder and told him gruffly not to let it get to him, but it was no use.
Harry froze for a fraction of a second, and then quickly turned and slipped back into the crowd, hoping Malfoy hadn’t seen him. His heart was racing for some reason, so he headed straight for the bar and ordered the strongest drink he could think of. As he leant against it, he tried to slow his heart rate and process what he had seen.
Harry’s mouth felt dry. The real question was: how had he never asked himself this before? It wasn’t as if he had been consciously ignoring it. It just had never occurred to him.
“Those belonged to Sirius and… Alright, alright, I see your point.” He rubbed a hand over his face, feeling exposed and weird.
In the kitchen, Ron and Mrs Weasley were having some kind of battle over the cake while Mr Weasley tried to get between them.
The whole article was infuriating. Malfoy was clearly trying to charm the pants off the reporter, and annoyingly it seemed to have worked. It didn’t even sound like him, except for that part about Harry - that was pure, vintage Malfoy nastiness. Harry pushed the magazine away from him in disgust.
“Harry.” She put the phone down and looked at him carefully. “When we were together, we had a four hour long fight when I suggested that you get a new television because yours is from approximately the 1740s. Now you’re telling me that you just went out and bought a mobile phone because it was a good idea?”
Krum nodded. “Am happy for me too. And you will see when you win World Cup - means nothing if you have no one to share with.”
“Right.” He was watching Harry with a funny expression on his face. If Harry didn’t know better he’d say it was fond.
Malfoy laughed again, but it sounded sadder now. “That’s one way of putting it. We can’t all be national treasures.”
Harry made a noise of frustration. “Because it's not fair. Ever since you said that my head’s been all messed up and it’s your fault.”
Angelina was still looking confused. “Were they on your bed or something?” Harry shook his head, and her frown deepened. “Why did you get a new room then?”
She glanced around to check that no one was listening and then leaned forward. “I heard he had a really hard time when he first got to the Magpies. I wonder if that was what it was about?”
“Well, firstly, she’d be the one doing the popping out,” Harry laughed. “And yes, that was the plan, for a while anyway.”
It certainly wasn’t the experience he had pictured, though to be perfectly honest he hadn’t spent much time thinking about it. He suspected that was about to change, he couldn’t imagine thinking of anything but that kiss for the rest of his life.
In the torch-light, Malfoy’s normally icy grey eyes were softer and bluer, and Harry found himself transfixed by them as the footsteps stopped outside their cubicle door. And then something miraculous happened; Filch’s footsteps kept moving, and in fact, they started to get further away.
Ginny pursed her lips. “Not to be that ex who tells you how to live your life, but I know how bad you are at having fun. You need to let loose once in a while, it isn’t healthy to deny yourself.”
“Harry, my boy, you played so bloody well,” he beamed, smacking Harry on the shoulder with a power that was very reminiscent of his youngest son.
All he could think about was the expression on Draco’s face. He’d been happy for Harry, happier than he was sad for himself. It felt as though Harry had been struck by a train, physically and emotionally.
Filch was coming closer and closer to their cubicle and Harry took a deep breath, sure that at any minute he would be dragged out by the scruff of his neck.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Calm down, I was just checking on the set-up down by the pitch. Besides, I thought you liked these shorts on me?” He waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“Welcome home, Master Draco.” She bowed slightly when they had exited the car and were standing in front of her.
“Think on it,” she replied as she got to her feet. “I will do my best to fix this all. Good day, Mr Potter.” Without another word, she swept away in a cloud of expensive perfume.
“Oh, for the love of…” Harry muttered and then stopped himself again and forced a smile. “I’m just resting.”
“No!” Harry pulled his arm away sharply, and almost fell backwards into the railing. Malfoy looked startled at his outburst. “I mean… Can I just sit down in your bathroom for a bit?”
He spent the next hour curled up in one of those armchairs engrossed in a book about the 1809 World Cup called Attack of the Killer Forest.
“Great!” She smiled even more broadly than before. Harry wondered idly if she was in danger of splitting her face in two. “Welcome to Australia, team! My name is Chanel. I’m a representative from the Department of Sports and Games, which is part of the Australian Ministry for Magic.”
He’d hardly spoken or eaten for the first month, just slept and watched the tapes of the game over and over again until Hermione and Ron had put their collective foot down and moved him into their spare room. Ginny had tried her best, but she had a career too and she had never been very good at traversing the darker paths his thoughts took.
Once they got inside Malfoy pulled the door shut behind him but didn’t move anywhere, trapping them in the entryway.
“We’re going for a dance,” she announced, gripping Malfoy’s hand in hers. Cormac looked like he wanted to get up to join them but Angelina held him firmly in his seat. Harry watched as Camille dragged Malfoy towards the packed dance floor. For the briefest second Malfoy glanced backwards but then he was engulfed in the mass of moving bodies.
He headed back to the hotel and straight to the front desk where a sleepy-looking witch was reading a magazine.
He refused to touch himself - that would turn this nightmare of an evening into something real, and he was holding onto reality by a pretty thin thread as it was.
Harry was still laughing as he began to walk down the tunnel towards the pitch. It wasn’t until he reached the green and saw the Scottish team assembling on the other side that he realised that he’d been successfully distracted. Ron was a lot sneakier than he let on.
He checked in on Draco every hour or so but in between he explored. The weather was still awful so he didn’t venture out of the keep but by the end of the second day he had almost completely covered the second and third floors.
With his free hand, Malfoy put his index finger under Harry’s chin and pushed it gently until Harry looked him in the eye, and then pulled him into a kiss.
“You seem happy,” he observed as they came face to face. They were the last in the lines as was customary.
He was just about to make his escape - the memories of the night before were beginning to swim back and he was relatively certain that he didn’t want to be near Malfoy when they did - when he felt a hand on his arm.
Draco was everywhere, long legs wrapped around Harry, hands in his hair and on his waist and the back of his thighs, pulling him in deeper than Harry thought possible.
Malfoy’s press conferences had also become notorious for his snarky comments and he had gained a few enemies and a legion of fans. Harry couldn’t understand it, but apparently the bad boy of British Quidditch (as he was quickly coming to be known) was irresistible to young witches and wizards up and down the country. There was a rumour that he had received invitations to the Yule Ball from over fifty per cent of the final year girls at Hogwarts.
Malfoy made a noise of agreement. “I read a book once that said that it’s because the magic that was practised here for thousands of years is so different from ours, much more ingrained in the earth. It’s almost like it’s seeped into the ground. Can you feel it?”
Harry looked at him finally, trying to convey his anger but as soon as their eyes met he knew that he was done for. Malfoy’s grey eyes were teasing and warm and Harry felt his anger and resolve melt like snow on a hot day. Malfoy’s hands relaxed on his wrists and he intertwined their fingers instead.
He shrugged noncommittally and then watched in alarm as she reached into a drawer and handed him a glossy magazine.
“Yes, Potter. Fragile, delicate, whatever you want to call it. You have the capacity to hurt him very deeply because for some reason you are a weak spot for him. Now that you’re aware of it, I trust you will use your Gryffindor honour to prevent that from happening.” Harry was about to say something else but she got to her feet. “I’m afraid that is all the time I have. Please consider what I’ve said carefully.”
“That’s putting it mildly,” Ginny added. “I am suddenly much less confused as to why our relationship didn’t work out.”
“Well, it is an honour to have ya in my humble shop.” He shook Harry’s hand with surprising strength. “I was going to nab ya for loitering, but Harry Potter? Feel free to browse for as long as ya like.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said miserably. “I shouldn’t have kept you a secret. I shouldn’t have assumed that we were on the same page.”
“Good to see you, Harry,” Benjy was saying, patting him on the shoulder. He turned to Draco and gave him a warm smile. “Thank you for reopening this place, lads. Zoe is very excited to be part of the first class, aren’t you — love?”
It was blunt but Harry didn’t mind. “No. I didn't have anyone to do that, really. My aunt wasn’t exactly the, uh, nurturing type. I used to imagine, though, when I was sick. I used to close my eyes and pretend that my mum was making me soup or brushing my hair.” Harry felt a familiar lump in his throat and swallowed it down quickly, but when he glanced back at Draco’s face he was horrified to see his eyes welling with tears. “Sorry, that was depressing.” He attempted a joking tone but it landed more in the realm of apologetic.
The only thing he could remember saying was telling Draco to go back to France. He hadn’t meant it as anything more than a comment on Draco’s playing style but he doubted it had come across like that.
“No,” Malfoy admitted, and he had suddenly become very interested in the strap of his bag. “It’s just that owls don’t really listen to Muggles, and every time I sent him a note he’d get pecked really nastily. And it was, well, more… subtle.”
“Potter, if your broom obstructs the goal one more time, I will genuinely come over there and beat you to death with it, alright?” Davies’ tone was light but his expression made Harry relatively sure he wasn’t joking.
Benjy looked at him with those sharp eyes. “Don’t apologise. You’ve been dealing with things the best you can, that’s all anyone can ask of you.”
It was rather late, though, so if Malfoy was asleep Harry would just tell him about it in the morning, he decided. He slipped his key into the lock and pushed the door open as quietly as possible - and froze.
He was so flustered that he virtually fled the shop the moment he had paid, clutching the bag to his chest.
“Uh, pancakes?” he said hesitantly, tapping his wand against the white china and grinning when a pile of fluffy cakes appeared on it. They were loaded high with fresh berries and cream and maple syrup. Oliver was going to kill him. He glanced at Angelina and Ginny and took a deep breath - there was nothing for it but to try and enjoy it.
“Stop doing that, I just came over to get it back,” Harry snapped, trying to snatch it from Malfoy’s hands.
Harry looked up and found Viktor Krum’s handsome face staring back at him, looking about as shocked as Harry felt.
“Make me a cup of tea, would you?” Draco asked over his shoulder as he went to sit down at the table.
“What’s happening here?” he asked in that blank tone but there was a challenge in his eyes. Harry was gratified to hear a slight breathlessness to it.
“Hi. I’m just hoping to buy a mobile phone,” Harry tried, hoping he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
Benjy allowed Harry a moment to gather himself while he pulled up a chair. “So, Harry,” he said, once he’d settled so that they could look at one another. “What else is going on with you? Dating anyone?” Benjy asked cheekily and then chuckled when Harry’s face went scarlet. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
He made his way back to the Gryffindor tower so lost in thought that he was startled to find himself face to face with the Fat Lady’s portrait with no memory of how he got there. She gave him a disapproving look but let him in with a warning that he would catch his death of cold wandering around so late.
“Hello Viktor,” he mumbled into his beer. Krum didn’t wait to be invited and took the seat next to Harry, indicating to the bartender that he wanted one of what Harry was having.
“Harry Potter,” he said with a grin when he pulled away, gripping Harry’s shoulders in his big hands. “It’s been far too long, my boy.”
It was far grander than the guest room, Harry was amused to note. A huge bed with thick green velvet curtains was against the far wall. Draco was already in bed, his hair splayed out against the thick, white pillow and the quilt pulled right up to his chin. He looked so pale that the bags under his eyes were almost purple.
After breakfast, Harry went back to his room and studied some of the diagrams that Davies had sent for pre-World Cup prep. That took about two hours, after which he was out of distractions - no, activities. He felt restless. Part of him wanted to go out and explore but that raised the danger of running into Malfoy - or Angelina, who was definitely growing suspicious. Instead, he settled on lying across his bed with his head hanging off so he could look at the room upside down. From this angle, he could see the dust under the dresser and a pair of his socks that had become wedged under the armchair. As he panned across the room a flash of orange sticking out from under his suitcase caught his eye. He couldn’t for the life of him figure out what it was so he rolled off the bed and tugged it out.
He wondered if Pansy had been telling the truth about Diagon Alley. He hoped not but it wasn’t entirely unbelievable; he’d seen the signs that some English fans brought to games. He also knew that she was right that Draco would never come out and ask him directly to stand up for him because deep down he thought he deserved that treatment. Harry considered this. At one point not too long ago he might have thought that Draco deserved it too, but now?
“No.” Harry scrubbed his hand over his face, frustrated at his own ineloquence. “I just mean… Aren’t you worried about what people will say in the press?”
“Harry!” Hermione grinned, putting the paper down. “Come on through - Ron’s just made the most delicious pastries.”
. Harry pulled out his own wand, and again they stood there staring at each other daring the other to cast the first spell. Suddenly Malfoy lunged forward, causing Harry to step on the back of his own robe and fall sharply on his bum. He tried to scoot back to get away but his back collided with the sinks and Malfoy advanced on him.
“Really. But I had a wonderful aunt who taught me every day until I was the best in my class. Well, second best.” He glanced over at Harry who was deep in conversation with Hermione.
“Ah,” Harry attempted, sending a worried look to Draco who looked like a deer in headlights. “Hello. It’s not… I mean, I can explain…”
“Dizzy.” Draco scrunched his face up. “The potion makes me feel like I might float away at any moment.”
“I thought you were supposed to get married and pop out 42 little ginger children,” Malfoy said and Harry could tell he was curious, the nosey bastard.
“I won’t tell anyone.” Harry managed to croak, hoping that it would relieve some of the tension in Malfoy’s shoulders. It seemed to have the opposite effect, however, as the blond boy’s face hardened and he narrowed those steely eyes.
The height difference really wasn’t huge but it was still novel for Harry to have to lean up to kiss someone. He found he liked it, just like he liked the feeling of Malfoy’s strong shoulders under his hands and the way his thumb brushed gently against the light stubble on Harry’s cheek over and over.
Malfoy glanced at him in the mirror. “Why? Are you looking for advice? Because I think your hair might be beyond even my expertise.”
“I used to see him play Quidditch when my aunt would take me to Hogwarts games as a child. For a ginger blood-traitor, he's not half bad.”
But it didn’t come. Instead, he felt Malfoy’s breath hot on his cheek as he leaned in to murmur into his ear. The feeling made every hair on Harry’s body stand on end, and for a moment he could barely process what Malfoy was saying.
Harry woke up late. The storm was still raging outside and the light coming through the large windows was dull and watery. He felt so warm and cosy in bed listening to the rain against the window that it was only the smell of porridge emanating from the tray on his table that pushed him to get up.
Malfoy pulled his wand up again, hand still shaking but a bit less than before. “Because if you do, I’ll throw Creevey’s camera off the astronomy tower,” He hissed, clearly trying to be threatening.
Sometime in the night, he had rested his head on the bed next to Draco’s legs and woke the second time to the feeling of fingers brushing through his hair. He turned his head slowly and found Draco staring at him with such fondness that his chest felt tight. He spotted the empty vial on the bedside table. He reminded himself it was the potion causing this, and forced himself to pull away from Draco’s touch to sit back in his chair.
Malfoy cut him off by turning and walking back into the room. For a moment Harry thought that he was kicking him out, but then Malfoy called over his shoulder. “I need a drink for this conversation, want anything?”
The launch of the British and Irish Cup 2005 was an extravagant affair. As usual, it was hosted by the Minister of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, Marvin Boulcott and took place in the event hall of the Ministry, a high-ceilinged, marble-floored room with enormous curtains covering every wall. His first year there, Harry had made the mistake of looking behind one of the curtains only to discover that the walls were covered in the most hideous, vocal portraits of what had to be every former Minister of every department since the beginning of time.
It was oddly soothing to watch, like a nature documentary. Ginny had never really been one for intense beauty routines, which had suited Harry just fine, but as a result, he’d never seen anyone put as much work into their appearance as Malfoy. What was extra odd was that, in Harry’s opinion, Malfoy was just as annoyingly good-looking before the routine as he was at the end.
Once they were safely back on their feet Malfoy let him go and began to walk towards the bed, unbuttoning his shirt. Harry was only a little bit embarrassed to find himself following like a dog to a treat. He reached Malfoy before he got to the bed and finished the job of undoing his shirt. Harry admired the way the moonlight from the window danced across his pale, glitter-covered skin. He looked like something from another world.
“Why don’t you hit me?” Malfoy said calmly. They were so close that Harry could have just pushed him off his broom if he wanted to. “Give the people what they want.”
“That’s stupid,” she replied, not unkindly. “We’re your friends. We’ll be there whenever you need us.”
“Potter, if you don’t get your hands on the Snitch right now—” The yelling cut off abruptly as Harry ended the inner ear amplification spell with a mutter.
Malfoy looked at him blankly, eyebrows raised, but reached out for Harry’s hand nevertheless. “Potter.”
He could see Draco’s eyes getting heavy so he sat in silence and watched as he slowly slipped back into sleep, never letting go of Harry’s hand.
He shook his head at her but took the drink anyway - he had never been any good at saying no to her - and was rewarded with another hearty smack on the shoulder.
Malfoy pushed him away, holding Harry’s head up with the hand in his hair so that he looked up at him. “Hotel,” he mouthed.
This time when he felt Malfoy press against his hip he didn’t pull back, he pressed in closer and was rewarded with a desperate sound that ripped his self-control in two.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up. “I came to make sure you were alright. You got hit by a Bludger during our match.”
He let her guide his hands to her waist and into her hand and they swayed together with the other couples. This was probably the closest they had physically been since they’d broken up, he realised belatedly. It was so familiar and strange at the same time.
He took Harry through the wooden gates and down the road to the first of the other structures. It was a long stone building, not as big as the keep but equipped for living nonetheless. Behind it was the practice pitch, which Harry could now see also included a generous equipment shed and changing rooms.
Parvati arrived about halfway through the third round of drinks and made sure to sit next to him so that he was pinned between her and Hermione. He resented the fact that they felt like they needed to coddle him, but it was also a bit nice to feel cared about that much.
It was more than that too, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on what that more was. He just knew that the image of Malfoy’s hand in the man’s dark, messy hair was seared onto the inside of his eyelids so that every time he blinked it was like he was right there. The sound that Malfoy had made, that breathless sob, rang in his ears louder than the indie rock playing over the speakers of the cafe. Something twisted in his gut.
When his shoulders had stopped shivering quite so violently he turned to face Draco, so that their arms were wrapped around each other’s waists. Draco’s eyes were wary and careful, which made Harry feel brave enough to reach forward and kiss him tenderly. Their numb lips felt rubbery and weird but it still made Harry’s chest ache in the way kissing Draco always did.
Malfoy turned so he was facing Harry again. “Maybe next time. I still haven’t seen you on your knees yet.”
Draco wasn’t wrong about the potion. Within five minutes of taking it he was fast asleep and Harry was left to his own devices once again.
They showered in silence, everyone else on the team was gone by the time they were dressed, and Harry avoided eye contact as he packed his bag. Why had he ever thought he could be friends with Malfoy? He felt foolish and grumpy. It was so typical that Malfoy would use his own kindness against him...
