“I also,” Malfoy added, cheeks pink, “have a degree in Muggle Studies from the College.”
“Fine?” Draco’s frown deepened. “What does that mean?”
“How are you holding up? We have ten minutes left, but if you need to stop early—”
“Oh.” Harry, suddenly feeling small, decided to take interest in his food. This meant staring at it, since he was still feeling queasy, and now his insides were turning into hard rocks, grinding against one another. “Was it anything I said?” he eventually asked, unable to bear the strange silence anymore, or the odd way he was feeling.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, that’s…the glitter doesn’t rinse off very well most of the time. Maybe with magic, but I don’t want to strip all the effects of the bath bomb off, so the glitter stays.” He ran a hand through his hair. There was no glitter in it today, but it was silky soft from the cloud bomb he’d used the evening before. “Come with me to the store? I think you’ll love it.”
“I’ll win this game,” Harry said. “Watch me.”
“It sounds to me like he was respecting your boundaries,” Gladys said.
The scones were almost done, so while they waited, Harry prepared a pot of tea and arranged a tray with butter and jam (he had no cream), and milk and sugar for the tea. Draco watched the oven anxiously all the while, until he declared the scones ready.
“Mmhh, and I have this lovely comforter as well.”
“Are you coming to bed?” Ginny had withdrawn her hand, Harry now realised. She’d crossed her arms, and there was a small wrinkle on her forehead, the kind that usually meant she was concerned about something or was about to get upset about something—usually Harry and his reluctance to sleep with her.
“Yeah. It’s just nice. There’s not that much more to it, really,” Harry said. He put his own cup down and sent the tray away.
Harry didn’t respond to that. He could understand that this was shitty, he just wasn’t in a place where he could—or wanted to—acknowledge it.
Relief passed over Malfoy’s face. “My first term we had a class about terminology,” he said. “As in, just words, and what they meant. We covered technology and pop culture and things like that, which was really interesting. One lecture was all about the difference between very similar sounding words and phrases. For example—wait, do you know what a mobile phone is?”
“I cancelled practice,” Harry said, ignoring her question. She didn’t look angry, just confused and Harry realised he must’ve forgotten to duplicate the cancellation note for her. Shit. Another thing he couldn’t do right: avoid the person he actually wanted to avoid. “I forgot to tell you. Sorry.”
Still, the fact that she was here and had apologised—many times over—and was actively trying to make amends? Harry had to respect that. Draco had done the same thing and Harry had accepted it, so why shouldn’t he be able to give Peony some benefit of the doubt, at the very least?
Malfoy’s brow furrowed and he took several sips of his tea. He hadn’t touched his tart yet. “What do you know about house-elves?” he finally asked.
“Robots?”
“I should bloody well hope so,” Millicent added. “I need to fucking breathe. Oi, Pans. Who do you know who’s single?”
The next formation they attempted failed miserably, but the kids took it in stride and only seemed emboldened, and those waiting on the sidelines jumped and yelled with Harry and Ginny as goals were scored or lost and Bludgers were missed.
Harry paused as he got the jar of honey for Ginny. The kettle was just starting to boil, and while Harry stood there, trying to will away the pangs in his heart, it got louder. “No,” he eventually said.
Draco shook his head, buttoning up his shirt. “I’m going home.”
“You…look more like a wizard than you used to,” Peony then said. “What with the…” she gestured at him. “And the hat.”
Harry’s stomach dropped as an overwhelming sense of vertigo and deja-vu descended on him. “Okay,” he heard himself say, as if from a distance, and then Draco was gone.
Gilliam rolled his eyes, but he shook Draco’s hand politely and when Blaise went to fetch them drinks, inquired about what he did for a living.
cry, which had been in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom in sixth year. It was a terrible memory, and one that now seemed like it had happened to a different person in a different past.
Not many had come out this Friday either. Lee was there, as was Angelina (but no George in sight). Hermione and Ron hadn’t come, but Padma and Pansy were there, and Parvati had shown up single again.
, that he could put it off. Indefinitely.
(the desire to have sex, to have orgasms, to engage in physical touch of a sexual nature, etc.)
Record-keeping Theory and Practice was okay. But there had to be something
“No.” Harry reluctantly returned to the physical space he was in. “I was just thinking. Were you saying something?”
“I remember.”
“And did you get it?” Draco asked pointedly. “I don’t see you with a wife and two kids and a nice house and a cushy job and maybe a dog and family picnics in the countryside.”
“Well done.” Harry smiled back. “You can sit on it now if you’d like and go join the others.”
“Can I ask you something?” Ginny’s voice was small, unsteady.
“I can’t believe I’m in love with you,” Draco said, shaking his head and sniffing. “You’re so…you.”
The two of them lingered for just a breath, then started towards the cafe doors. The umbrella and the levitating crockery followed.
“Nothing really changed,” Harry said. “I just thought it’d be nice. I mean, I don’t always hate it, I just—I thought it’d be nice.” It was easier to talk about it when not looking Draco in the eye, so Harry continued: “I have a lot of complicated feelings about it but right now I’m really happy, and I just want…I feel like maybe I can make you feel what I’m feeling? That sounds stupid, doesn’t it—”
“No,” Harry replied, truthfully. “But I have made things break and rattle and get really scary,” he said, opting to not tell them about blowing up Marge. “Big emotions are like that.”
“Ginny and I broke up,” Harry said, wanting to get it over with.
“It matches,” Harry repeated.
Once upon a time, Malfoy would have (and had) made derisive comments about his Muggle upbringing. If he’d said those words then, it’d have been with a sneer, and it’d have been a mockery—intended to be cruel.
“We couldn’t wait,” Ron said, beaming. He laced his fingers with Hermione’s and for a second Harry thought they might start making out in the middle of the restaurant.
“I want to say honest,” Malfoy said, after a moment’s pause and a bite of pie. “I’d like the truth. But I’ve heard the rumours, and if the rumours are half true it must’ve been…a traumatic experience, for you.”
cramped, not really, the ceiling was high enough that Harry couldn’t reach it if he stood on tip-toes and tried, and he assumed the hayloft had an even higher ceiling. But it looked—it needed a massive overhaul. Proper floors, for starters, but also…
Everything was off kilter. Ginny was going to break up with him. Harry knew it as surely as he knew the colour of the sky.
. “Thanks,” he said, and left.
“Okay,” said Draco. “So your relatives abused you. That’s horrible in so many different ways, but…why are you meeting with them? You don’t have to do it just because your therapist said so.”
“I…technically, yeah.”
Calling in sick was a mistake. He should’ve stayed at work. He shouldn’t have cancelled practice either. He should’ve…he shouldn’t have let Draco leave, he should’ve tried harder, he should write him again, he should, he should, he should.
“Starters—go!”
“Mmh,” Ron vocalised, around a mouthful of sandwich. “What else is new in your life? You and Malfoy getting hitched soon or something?”
“I have made decisions,” he said, but it was pointless. “I got that bookcase.”
It was over now, and it was ending.
Draco weighed the two against each other. “The vanilla, I think. I’m not in the mood for peppermint.” He put the galaxy bomb back and handed the other one to Harry. “I’ve got to go check on the scones.”
because I don’t know what it is yet. It’s not been a week.” He threw the paper onto Hermione’s desk and started in on his soup. “I’d like to think it’s a good thing. Maybe permanent.”
Harry set the drinks on the table, ignoring all of Pansy’s unspoken questions.
“They've got this,” Draco said, coming up on his right side and gently bumping their shoulders together. “Stop worrying.”
Harry shrugged. “Maybe. I—” A whistle sounded. “I should find my seat. Let’s talk later? Enjoy the game.”
The meadow painting was sunny and a few butterflies Harry was certain he’d never seen before fluttered over the grass. They were a bright blue, bluer than the sky and brighter than the sun, and too early in the season to exist.
“You could.” Ginny bumped his shoulder. “For this kind of thing the parents usually bring the money, so you’ll have to rely on donations for uniforms and equipment. You can’t keep funding everything yourself.”
, and he tried to keep the ugly resentment from rising up. It wasn’t fair. They’d broken up; she had no obligation to be here.
That last question elicited a few giggles as the kids ascertained that they definitely still had their heads. Nobody seemed to have hurt themselves, but Harry would check them again later and let their parents know when they came to pick them up—he’d learned the hard way that sometimes kids weren’t aware of their own injuries and wouldn’t be for hours. Slowly, the crying ceased, and everyone’s faces got cleaned up.
Or maybe the kids were just getting bigger and as a result having bigger emotions. He’d had Charlie, Avery and Alice in his care since they were two, Betty had joined six months later, and Hugh a few months after that. He’d have the lot until the end of spring, and then Charlie, Avery, and Alice would be off to school full time and Harry would have to take on three new kids, or…let them all go and find another line of work.
To read more about asexuality,
“That’s great,” Ron said, sincerely. “We all could use some of that, yeah? Put our heads on straight and all.”
“Yeah—no—doesn’t matter, I guess. I’m going anyway.” He took Draco’s hand and squeezed it. “Let’s go. Now. No point in dawdling.”
Harry thought the curve of Malfoy’s ear might’ve held the secrets to unlock the universe. “In the sequel what?”
“Honest.” Harry couldn’t stop looking at him.
“Alice,” Harry said, then stopped. What on earth could he say to a frightened child who hadn’t meant to set anything on fire to begin with? “What happened?”
“Yes.”
Malfoy saw something in Harry’s face, because his cheeks were pink enough to match the bomb he was holding. He put it back. “Maybe another time?” he asked, brushing pink dust off his fingertips. “I don’t mean to…give the wrong impression.”
to know how long for.”
Guilt flickered across Draco’s face. “Yeah,” he said. “Did you say Blaise has a boyfriend?”
“Thank you.” He didn’t detect any lie in her face, even if she looked more reserved as usual. “Do—” he started, but was interrupted by Emma, who was holding up her broom and uniform. “Thank you, Emma. You did a good job today. I saw you whack a Bludger all the way across the field!”
“What?” She turned around. “Why?”
They finished eating in silence, each of them seemingly deep in thought about some matter or other. Harry found his thoughts straying to Malfoy and his odd choice in reading materials. What would one want to read three thousand coroner reports for? He resolved to ask Malfoy about it if he were to see him again.
“Do you want to take a letter to Draco for me?” he asked, even as he wondered what use it would be to write him. What could he possibly say that would make this evening less catastrophic and make Draco forgive him and set everything right?
“That,” Draco said, nodding towards Padma. “Magical repairs work short term on minor damage, but the effect will inevitably wear off. It’s not like a healing spell; wood isn’t alive in the same sense as a human is. The human body will repair itself, and the spells help with that process. Wood and rock and metal can’t knit itself back together.”
“Oh.” Harry looked at Malfoy, really looked at him, and tried to compare what he was seeing with what Malfoy had looked like when he’d first come into the Archive almost five weeks ago. He didn’t look chronically underslept anymore, or like breathing was a chore, or vaguely ill. He looked like what a normal person was supposed to look like.
Harry discovered a mismatched set of spatulas and stirring spoons in a box with a stuffed animal and a broken lamp. He didn’t recognise the stuffed animal, but it looked old and well loved—Ginny’s? Or did it belong to one of his kids? He set the animal aside, threw out the lamp, and put the cooking utensils in the kitchen. Ginny had already purchased a brand-new set to replace this one, when they hadn’t been able to find it, but Harry liked the blue spoon. They’d picked it out together in a second-hand shop on Direction Alley, the same week Harry had officially moved out from Ron and Hermione’s and in with Ginny and her flat share.
“You only want to talk on the train about serious stuff,” she said, her voice shaky. She shook her head, looking skywards, and Harry thought maybe she was trying to blink back tears.
Harry didn’t know. “…No,” he said. No house-elves? “I don’t get it. What have house-elves got to do with anything?”
“Potter?”
, with that frown on her face, and Harry didn’t want their first night in the flat to end with a fight. That wasn’t how new beginnings should start, and it wasn’t what he wanted for their future.
Harry gave it a cursory glance to check that it was indeed a request form. “All right, a ludicrous amount of deaths coming your way. I’ll be a moment.” He rolled his chair out from under the desk and headed for the levitating platform. (Why they didn’t simply install ordinary elevators was completely beyond Harry.)
“Yes?” Harry didn’t look up from the box he was poking through. He set it aside and opened another.
Dean cleared his throat. “Well,
“Those books you lent me,” Harry started, shoving his hands into his pockets so he wouldn’t be tempted to fiddle. Then he found he couldn’t continue, because Malfoy was looking at him, open interest and worry on his face.
, Alice’s fingers closed over something—
Charlie was still having problems with his broomstick, and now the malaise had spread to Alice’s broomstick as well. Which was odd, because there’d been no problem in the morning, but now that the kids had had lunch and an hour indoors with colouring pencils, two broomsticks refused to comply.
“I’d love that. The pass,” Malfoy said, and then suddenly he was leaning close and speaking into Harry’s ear. “Thank you for today,” he said. A brush of something warm and soft on Harry’s cheek, and then Malfoy had taken a step back. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Okay. Good. Thank you.” Harry sat again, suddenly exhausted. The food still wasn’t appealing, so he ignored his plate, which had floated over and was now bobbing in front of him, like some kind of buoyant little creature. Harry pushed it away. “There
“I don’t need you talk to me into it,” Harry said, deciding to just do it. Take the leap. “I’m going to do it.”
“What if I joined you?”
“Nothing caught fire,” Harry reassured them. “She cut all the hair off. I was bald as a baby, except for a bit in front to cover this little scar here because she didn’t like that either. And all night I was so scared I couldn’t sleep because I was worried the other kids would make fun of me.” He paused for a dramatic effect, giving the kids the opportunity to gasp in the right places. “Do you know what had happened in the morning?”
“Hello,” Malfoy said, having stopped short at the sight of Harry. He glanced at Harry’s shoes, his muddy cloak, the bundle of papers he was carrying, and his windswept hair. “Children?”
He could envision it—for a barn it was small (Harry guessed), having held up to six cows in the stalls, but for people? It could make a decent house. This open space they were standing in was large enough for a kitchen and living room, and probably a pantry, and the area with the stalls that wasn’t already occupied by Draco’s wood workshop could become something else, and the entire hayloft could easily house several bedrooms and a bathroom. It was all very dark and dim, however, and dusty, and it felt cramped. It
He couldn’t say he’d said it without thinking. He’d said it deliberately, to hurt, to shut Draco up.
Harry used the Archive’s owl to inquire with Gladys about another appointment. He received a prompt response that there was a slot open that same evening, so he sent back a confirmation. He’d talk to her about maybe setting up a schedule of a kind—he hadn’t thought he would, but after that first appointment Harry found there were a lot of things he wanted to talk about. Unburden himself. Have someone smarter than him who used words like
The pamphlet had said something about touch, hadn’t it? Only Harry couldn’t remember if it was about not touching or touching. His daycare kids usually calmed down when offered physical contact if they were upset or anxious: a hug, a pat on the knee, holding hands on excursions, that sort of thing. But Draco wasn’t a five-year-old, and Harry didn’t want to think about managing him like a child, either—but physical touch was physical touch, wasn’t it? People are people? It could be worth a shot—he could make the offer at least.
there for me. It was more like I existed for their sake.”
The Little League games were played on a proper Quidditch pitch, but on a smaller scale; the goalposts had been lowered so the highest ring was at fifteen feet and the lowest at six, and they’d been moved closer to the centre of the field. The entire match was contained, so that if the players or the balls touched the invisible boundary, they were gently guided alongside it until they veered back.
“That’s very good of you.” Harry was impressed; his knowledge of children didn’t reach far, but he was certain none of his own childhood bullies would’ve done this. Perhaps that was the difference—he’d had bullies, not friends who occasionally messed up. “Is that all, do you think?”
“Okay,” Harry said.
“Thank you.”
This was nice. Harry had missed Ginny—more than he’d realised. This, the casual closeness, the smell of her shampoo. Her insightfulness. “I love you,” he said.
The Montrose Magpies’ home pitch was the home for the Little League Quidditch Charity Series, and therefore also the venue for the press conference that started the Series off. The press weren’t the only ones who had shown up, however, as the Magpies were playing the Holyhead Harpies later in the day. The small crowd that had gathered on the stands was undeniably there for peeks at the Little League captains; Harry felt their eyes on him, in addition to the unforgiving glares of the cameras.
Harry woke up Friday morning with a puffy face and messy hair and a void of hunger in his belly. He hadn’t eaten since he’d had lunch the day before (and even then, he hadn’t eaten much) and he was really feeling it now. He’d gone to sleep without eating after Ginny had left, too caught up in his own head to even think about food, and then when Hilde had returned from an evening flight without a note from Draco, he’d managed to talk himself into believing all was lost.
. They were going to the finals.
He didn’t have to wait long; she’d showered quickly by the looks of it and her eyes had that determined look that usually followed a defeat.
something, not just lie there all paralysed and unable to deal with anything at all. If he’d been face to face with a dragon he would’ve done something, he wouldn’t be like this. But this wasn’t a dragon, this wasn’t life or death, this was a complicated tangle of emotions rattling around inside him, making it hard for him to think clearly—the only thing he could think about was how much he missed Draco, how much he needed him there, and how scared he was that he would never come back.
“No—that is, ah…” Malfoy cleared his throat. “Are you asking me like—like a
There is no evidence that PCD is directly related to past sexual assault or trauma. PCD can occur even if the individual did not orgasm, and there is no connection between PCD and the intimacy of the sexual encounter or the relationship; individuals can suffer from PCD after sex with someone they are in a strong committed relationship with as well as after casual encounters with strangers.
Tears welled up in Hugh’s eyes and streamed down his cheeks. Harry dug into the first aid kit for an antiseptic salve and band aids. “Chin up, Hugh,” he said, gently. “Okay. This is going to sting a bit.” He wiped most of Hugh’s tears away with his thumbs, then started applying the salve to the scratches. One looked deep, and Harry thought he’d probably find bits of Hugh’s skin under Betty’s nails if he looked.
“I don’t think…none of us came out of the War unscathed,” Ginny continued, “and I think all of us were impacted by our sentences in some way or other…maybe it was a slow change, I don’t know. But when you came back from prison, that’s when I noticed you weren’t the same person anymore.”
“It’s no big deal.” Harry buttered himself one of Draco’s scones next, trying to avoid his gaze. He realised now what it was he’d seen in Draco’s face: the same thing he’d seen in Ginny’s whenever she’d wanted sex.
“All right,” she’d said, and buckled down with him.
Draco smirked.
“I’m right here.” Draco’s eyes were sparkling with mirth. Harry was
Draco, bless him, and Harry had never loved him more, tried to distract Harry from his own head all weekend, going with him to the pub on Friday, taking him out for a date to the bookshop in Godric’s Hollow on Saturday, and filling his kitchen with the scent of freshly baked bread.
“He’s got an art show in Brixton,” Seamus added, proud and delighted. “It’s very good. I got an exclusive first showing, you know.”
He sent her off, and while Betty, Hugh and Avery were occupied with either watching Alice zooming between the apple and pear trees at the edge of the field, Charlie got his own broom to obey.
Everyone shot into the air and within minutes Harry was witnessing the dirtiest game of Quidditch he’d ever seen five year olds play. Love smashed a Bludger directly into the face of a Chaser from the other team despite the Anti-Face Charm on the Bludgers. A split second later, when it flew back at her, she grabbed it out of the air and threw it back at the same Chaser, but before Oliver could cry foul (not that it kept the spectators from collectively crying out) the other team’s Seeker pulled at Alice’s ponytail and nearly dragged her off her broom. Alice cried out and a flock of orange and black butterflies appeared out of nowhere to viciously attack the attacker.
apologising for?” Harry was uncertain of everything, but also oddly exhilarated because Draco was here and he’d brought
“There are several children on your team whose parents are—”
“Oh, I—you go, you’re already…” Draco gestured at Harry’s robe. “I’ll just…”
“Magic in England,” Malfoy said, smiling delightedly. “It’s the most extraordinary thing, really, the way Muggles write about magic. They keep coming up with new and ingenious ways to do magic that have no basis in actual reality, but are compelling all the same.”
“Wait.” Harry sat up. “Draco—”
They should talk about it, sometime, eventually—before…well, before. Just before. Talk about it properly, that is. After he’d talked to Gladys, maybe—she hadn’t been able to do Monday evening appointments anymore, but they’d set up a biweekly schedule, Thursday afternoons every other week. His next appointment was the following day. She’d been confident they didn’t need to meet more often than that.
to see good.” He collected the bowls and stacked them neatly. “I’ve thought about it a lot. All the choices I’ve made. All the choices you made. And I—I’ve come to the conclusion that I’d very likely make those same choices again.”
“All right.”
“A brilliant save,” Ron acknowledged.
Harry rolled over, putting his back to the book, and was faced with the empty half of the bed that had used to be Ginny’s. It still smelled like her. He turned onto his stomach and drew his pillow over his head, where neither Malfoy nor Ginny could reach him, and fell asleep.
“How’d you guess?” Harry replied dryly. He gestured with the bundle. “Paperwork, also.”
“Good things.” Harry touched his legs to Draco’s under the covers. “I was wondering how you sleep like that.”
“I think for now I’ll just get this book,” he said, eventually. “But thank you for your help.”
“Oh, there you are,” Draco said, turning around. “Where have you been?”
“Mmh.” Harry had a lot of favourite things about Draco, but this was possibly one of them. He never minded when Harry got all up in his personal space like this, and Harry loved it, loved touching him, smelling his hair, kissing him, and getting kisses back. “I was wondering, actually, if we could…do you want to come to bed with me?” Harry kissed him again, trying to tame his own heartbeat before he said the next bit. “Just to be clear, I mean sex.”
“All three of you need some of this blue for your cards,” he said, pointing at the paper. “The paper is this big.” He demonstrated with his hands. “Can you think of a good solution to this problem?”
Frustration roiled in Harry’s chest. He’d said no! Plenty of times! And then they’d fought about it! “I did,” he snapped. “Or do you not remember all those fucking fights?”
“Your hair.”
“Hi.” Ginny looked at the book in his hands, then at the other three books sitting on the coffee table. “You got books.”
“You already know some of my ugly parts, Malfoy. Do you really think anyone would be interested in…seeing
“That doesn’t make it okay.” Harry hadn’t touched his biscuits, but now he had a strong urge to crush every single one into dust, lest he crush his cousin’s skull through accidental magic. It was a wonder nothing worse had happened to Marge than her getting slightly inflated, really, given how angry the entire Dursley family made him.
While dabbing the salve onto Hugh’s face—a magic salve, with quick healing properties—he started talking, keeping half an eye on the trio that was outside. “What happened here, kiddos? Why were you fighting?”
“You didn’t tell me you’d met someone! Hello there,” Pansy shook hands with the newcomer sweetly, then turned back on Blaise. “Honestly!”
at pub night.
“Exactly. Do you remember how happy you were? And how happy the butterflies were?”
When the reports had all slotted themselves into the trolley’s shelves (now slightly bulging), a fresh ex libris list popped out of the trolley and into Harry’s waiting hand.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, realising his hands were all over Draco’s neck and hair and face. “You’re very warm.” He also realised that Draco’s hands were not on him; he was holding his floury hands away from Harry’s soaked self. “Uh, do you want to go finish those scones while I change?”
He’d taken Avery aside for a minute before they headed out and while Avery had promised to change his behaviour, Harry wasn’t convinced it was going to be that easy.
“Hello,” Draco said. “I’d apologise for stealing him away, but…actually, I won’t.”
“So you will neither confirm nor deny the rumours that Weasley is having a romantic affair with a teammate?”
Draco kissed him. “For luck,” he said and left, going to sit with Ron and Hermione. They were wearing badges, too, Harry realised. Hermione was showing by now and had put on robes that emphasised the growing baby bump.
“Yeah?”
The course as a whole had lost a lot of its shine. Using the new knowledge at the Archive was fun, but it was more fun being around people. People other than his colleagues, nice as they were.
“Yes, actually…I’ll owl you about it later if that’s all right with you? Give me a quote?”
Ms Baxter gave Harry a long-suffering smile. “He’s been practicing with apples at home,” she confided with a whisper. “He managed to charm them himself.”
Harry groaned. “Nothing I’m willing to share,” he said. He speared a dumpling of his own. “I’d like to say that you’d like him.”
Harry’s head was spinning.
“Is that why there’s so many house-elves at Hogwarts?”
Malfoy Disapparated.
Whatever it was he had with Draco, Harry didn’t want it to fall apart. So he was here now, for better or for worse.
Harry’s brain was still in the process of rewriting itself to think of Dudley as Peony, and not Dudley. He mentally ran over his schedule. Between work, Quidditch, school, his friends, and Draco, he didn’t know how he’d fit Dud—Peony in. Maybe if he brought someone? Would Draco want to? Maybe not. But Harry wasn’t entirely sure bringing either Ron or Hermione would be a smart move; both of them were liable to swing their fists. Hermione had good aim. “I’ll think about it. Bringing someone, I mean. Uh, I’m really busy though, I don’t know…when were you thinking?”
“Exactly! That’s what good winners do. Let’s go. Everyone, shake hands.” Harry ushered the kids up and back to the field.
ago and since then…I don’t know, more and more people I know did and then I realised…” he shrugged. “It was like…this feeling of peace? Of belonging?”
The documents didn’t take long to sort, and Malfoy had settled beneath the meadow painting in less time than it took to prepare a cup of tea. The meadow was sunny, snowdrops and purple crocuses peeking out of the grass, and a few birds were flittering about the tree. As usual, Malfoy didn’t notice.
Harry had been in the mood for the black bomb, actually. It was an annoying little thing, turned the water a gross dark brownish purple, but it had pepper and cinnamon and something else in it that was spicy and jabbed and prickled at him—it was a cleanser, of a sort, or so Harry felt; when he used it on bad days, it always felt like the negative energies washed off him and down the drain along with the water. However, most of Harry’s awful mood had evaporated when he’d seen Draco in a transfigured tea towel for an apron. (Draco had taken it off already.) “Whatever you want.”
“Yes, our murder boy,” she said. “He’s loitering out front. He’s not doing a very good job at pretending to be casual. He keeps looking in the windows.”
Harry understood just enough to know he needed to keep Malfoy from breaking.
And then…he had nothing to do.
“It was more like a
“Begging?” Draco grinned, delighted. “I’ll spare you the indignity. I would absolutely
Harry’s head felt like it was full of cotton. How could he possibly explain what he’d been thinking when he barely knew himself? Stopping hadn’t occurred to him as an option. He’d started it, so he’d finish it, let Draco do whatever he wanted to him. “Because you wanted to,” he said. “I thought you liked it.”
“What do
? Harry had said yes, but he didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want to talk about the Dursleys at all. He didn’t want to recount his meeting with Peony, or talk about his feelings, or bring up any more awful stories from his childhood. He was
“Gather round,” he said, beckoning the kids to come over. They did, forming a tight half circle. “When you’re very, very little, like you are—” Avery protested, and Harry smiled, “—like you are now, before you grow big like me, sometimes emotions can be so big they don’t fit inside of you,” he said. “All kinds of emotions can become very big. And big emotions turn into magic sometimes.”
Draco enclosed them in a weather bubble, to shield them from the wind. “Have you finished the book yet?”
“I know, and I’m sorry,” Draco said. “I just needed space, I didn’t mean—
This team he’d put together for the purpose just having some fun and raising money had become an entity of its own. Evolved beyond him.
“It doesn’t hurt at all!” Alice argued. “I can play—”
about seeing her. “How…are you?”
Dean and Seamus were sitting at a large table near the back, Seamus waving to get their attention. Draco had gone all stiff beside Harry, but Harry tugged him gently forwards. This wasn’t the first time they’d met since the war, Harry knew, that wouldn’t be the issue—hopefully. Dean had spent some time in captivity at Malfoy Manor, but neither Dean nor Draco had brought that up to him at any point leading up to this evening.
“We didn’t mean to,” Avery said.
This was boggling Harry’s mind. “How come? I mean, we never saw them—I didn’t even realise there were house-elves at Hogwarts until I went to the kitchens…”
“No problem,” Emma’s mum said. Wyncall, Harry recalled her name was. Emily Wyncall. “You need an assistant coach.”
Harry had no idea what an e-reader was. “Explain that to me?”
Harry blinked, his gut twisting. “No! Why’d you think—I’m not going to break up with you! I just like to talk on the train,” he tried to explain.
Inexplicably, Harry’s throat seized up. He knew, objectively, that he’d had a terrible upbringing, he knew it had been abusive, he knew it had been traumatic, he knew—he knew all those things. Hermione had pointed it out to him, Ron had been horrified, he would still make an offhand comment about something and meet distressed silence. He
“I have no plans,” Draco answered. His hands were on Harry’s waist.
Charlie and his mum were at the game, just two seats over from Harry’s. The game hadn’t started yet; they’d arrived early—Harry did indeed have a hangover, but he’d dragged himself out anyway—and Charlie was bouncing in his seat, waving frantically.
The kids stared at him, confused and hesitant.
Harry wasn’t sure what to say. He wanted to know, wanted to understand, but it was all very foreign to him. “Thank you for telling me all this,” he eventually said. “Was it hard? To tell me, I mean.”
& article about the book:
“Don’t try to understand it,” Padma said. “I’m a Ravenclaw, by the way. I’m not part of this Gryffindor-Slytherin thing.”
Harry didn’t know what gay robots were like, but he very much wanted to find out.
“Thank you.” Dean looked at the business card like it was made of gold, which for Dean it probably was.
Almost everything in that article touched a nerve somewhere deep in Harry; everything about expectations and pressure and the emotional crash afterwards—
Harry nodded, mouth full.
The others were filtering out of the classroom, but Harry wasn’t ready to leave just yet. He was staring down at his list, with notes and underlined and circled words, and feeling strange. A hotness spreading in his chest, almost like embarrassment, a lot like disbelief, something reminiscent of promise.
“You didn’t fight me on it,” Ginny pointed out. “The one time I wanted you to fight me on an issue, you didn’t. That’s why I left, we weren’t—look, I wanted more. You didn’t want to give me more. It was a done deal, in the end.”
“Are you ready to play another game?” Harry asked them, conscious of not using too much language about winning and losing, just in case they lost today’s game.
Malfoy stopped short. “Do you want the name and address of the clinic?”
Maybe he’d make a bookplate and number it, like Malfoy did with his books. The first book in his very own library.
Maybe he should cancel tonight’s practice? No, better not. Let them run all their steam off instead of keeping a lid on it until Thursday.
Harry was floating. Even if Malfoy hadn’t come to the pub with him, Harry felt lighter than he had in a long time and that, at least in part, was because of Malfoy.
“Yeah. I understand if you don’t want to, but I would appreciate the chance to have a sit down. You can bring someone if you want?” she added.
“Oh, yes. Er. Have a lovely weekend?” Harry floundered.
“That’s a good idea,” Harry acknowledged. “What do you think?” This he directed at Alice and Avery.
“It’s a relief,” Seamus said.
“That’s precisely what’s so interesting!” Malfoy gestured with his fork. “Muggles don’t think magic is really
Harry almost stumbled over his own feet as his heart skipped a beat. “Feel dead? How?” The same way Harry felt? Like there was a…something missing? An emptiness inside?
“Can I touch you?” Harry asked.
“I, of course, always wanted to be a Quidditch player,” Oliver said, stepping in. He gave Harry a wink and a nudge to go. “Got my first broom at age three, this fantastic little toy Cleansweep modelled after the 2, that my mother charmed to go a little faster.”
Hilde was resting in her cage, so Harry wrote a cancellation for Little League practice, duplicated it, and sent her off with all twelve notes. He couldn’t face people anymore, not with the growing abyss of terror and desperation within him.
An hour passed in this way, and then a half hour discussing what their team name should be, and then Harry let them play with the brooms as he went over uniform specs with the parents.
Malfoy’s shoulders immediately sagged. Was that relief? “Maybe another time, then.”
“Oh, for goodness’ sake, Potter, it wasn’t a one time chance encounter in the wild, nor did I go seeking them out like hummingbirds in an aviary!” Malfoy said, all fretful. “I worked with Muggles on restoring several Malfoy properties.”
Draco looked mildly terrified that he was going to be left alone with Dean and Seamus, but he asked for tea and took a seat. Seamus asked for a refill and Harry fetched the drinks, going for a tea for himself as well. If Draco wasn’t drinking he wasn’t comfortable getting inebriated himself.
“Yes. You too!” Harry called after her. He looked at the books Malfoy had brought, but instead of examining them he put them away. Then he went to the front desk and went over the collection of pamphlets and brochures they had displayed beneath the clock until he found the one about the archivist course.
There was a specific kind of relief that came with having words to describe what he was feeling, and the knowledge that he wasn’t the
Draco stopped what he was doing. “What changed?”
“Why don’t you repair it magically?” Dean asked. “We have spells for that, don’t we?”
“I’m sorry your girlfriend lost,” Charlie said, sincerely.
is a very real thing that many who suffer from don’t know they have, or have been misdiagnosed. As it’s understudied, we don’t know what is the exact cause/s, but we do know that it’s either a physiological reaction (chemical crash following a chemical high (orgasm)) or a psychological reaction (emotional crash following an emotional high), or
“Hey,” Harry said, drawing up short in front of them. He’d known, intellectually, that the Harpies were playing, which meant that Ginny would be there, but what with the press event and everything he hadn’t…prepared for the possibility of seeing Ginny, or how to react, or what to say to her. How to
Harry was almost too wired to be in his skin by the time he made it to the pub. He was early, too, unable to sit still—he’d tried to finish reading the young adult dystopian book Malfoy had lent him, but had been unable to focus. The only people already at the pub were Dean and Seamus. Harry fetched himself a pint of pale ale from the bar first, then wound his way over to the table.
minutes late. There’d been a conflict at the daycare, which had delayed everyone, parents and children alike, and eaten into Harry’s lunch hour.
That was the original plan, anyway. But Harry had a list of possibilities tacked to the fridge, and now the idea of turning the daycare from part time into full time, of taking on a new crop of kids, was exciting instead of depressing. Yeah, he’d gotten attached to these kids, but they weren’t really
“Yeah, I…” Harry exhaled. “Wow. Just…I’m still processing everything, you know?”
“Yeah, there’s a box with some things.” Harry hesitated for just a second—he did treasure her friendship and her professional qualifications, even if he didn’t want any trace of her in the flat anymore. “I also wanted to talk about the assistant coach thing. I’ve thought about looking for someone else, but I’d much rather have you—”
Ginny hesitated. “I—yes, okay.” She let Harry lead her a few steps away, to relative privacy—a few reporters were still hanging around and were no doubt taking covert photos of the two of them. “What’s this about? Is it about us? Getting back together?”
“Just now.” Harry dished out the food. “Sorry,” he said, gesturing at the food. “I forgot.”
“Mr Harry!” Betty was shrieking with delight. “I got it! I got the Snitch! The real one!”
“Good. Good. I need to wrap things up here—wait for me?”
“Good?” Draco asked, smug.
“No.” She shook her head. Her voice had taken on a sharp, angry tone. “It’s the same bullshit every time,” she snapped. “What’s the problem? What the fuck is the problem? Why is it you never fucking want to fuck me?”
“It could be,” Harry said. “I’d like it to be. Those always have a happy ending, right? I’d like a happy ending.”
It was impossible to stand still—his kids were giving their all, and their enthusiasm and excitement was contagious. Harry barely noticed the crowd in the stands, being too busy yelling encouragement and suggestions at his players and rotating them out when he saw them flagging.
“This weekend? Sunday?”
“Why do you always look like you just got off a broom?” Malfoy said in greeting. “The hair is one thing, but the mud?”
? Harry chanced a look at Draco, something he’d studiously avoided all this time, and saw he was hard. That was even more confusing; by Harry’s reckoning, if he was in the mood then…that was
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said, though he didn’t quite understand. She was the one who’d come back after a week and told him she’d met someone. And he’d met her, he’d shaken hands with Rhosyn. It’d been fine. “Later, then.”
“Better?” he asked.
“There is a point in that book somewhere, buried under all the crazy,” Malfoy said. “Not a lesson, exactly, but a kind of uncomfortable truth that no writer since has dared to express.” He held up one hand in imitation of a scale. “So on the one hand the novel is critically acclaimed for that.” He raised the other hand, now weighing the two. “And on the other it’s 400 years old, so the fact that it hasn’t been done again is in itself an uncomfortable truth.”
“No hexing,” Harry confirmed. “You don’t have to, like, talk, or anything. You don’t even have to sit with us if you don’t want to, I just—I’d really appreciate it if you were nearby.”
think they’re a metaphor for?”
Harry was at a loss for words. It hadn’t occurred to him that Draco would have such a different outlook on life than him, that he wouldn’t know—wouldn’t
“Darling, are you seeing this?” Pansy said to Padma.
“What’s the status on the farm?” Harry asked as he joined them. “Got everything sorted yet?” He slid Draco’s tea over, earning a soft thank you in return.
care. But…Malfoy had been selling off a lot of Malfoy property. Was one technically still landed gentry if one no longer owned land and didn’t have any tenants? Why had he done it?
Still, Harry had expected Malfoy to come in. Was he ill? He hadn’t looked chronically sleep deprived of late, but anyone could be felled by illness unexpectedly…
Draco snorted. “Enough of this.” He fished a handkerchief—a real, actual, handkerchief—from a pocket and dabbed at his face.
Even if he really, really wanted her to.
deserve a happy ending,” Draco said. “All the things I’ve done, I’ve—I’m not a good person. That’s just how it is.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry eventually said. He didn’t look her in the eye. “I’m just not in a good place right now.”
She winced, and apparently didn’t miss the hint.
“Thanks.” Harry put it away in a pocket. This new cloak had properly charmed pockets, so the notebook disappeared entirely, leaving not a single trace in the drape of the fabric. “Uhm, Gin—this is Draco,” he then said, conscious of the fact she’d declined to meet him, but also the fact that they’d literally bumped into each other. “Draco, Ginny.”
“Okay.” Harry waited for her to respond to the actual question.
Both Hugh and Betty ambled over, Hugh’s chin definitely wobbling. He was going to cry, Harry knew with certainty. Thankfully he also knew that Hugh was a silent crier, so he wouldn’t have to deal with the noise of it. He told them to sit.
Harry couldn’t help smiling. “There’s also one shaped like a robot. And there’s a galaxy one. You might like those too.”
Seamus was giggling. “Harry. Are you having a, a bisexual awakening?”
The ringing faded eventually, replaced with a small tendril of something else, whispering against his diaphragm whenever Harry thought about that smile, so small, so brief, but so infinitely significant.
“Why is it a
“No, not like that.” Harry gave her a smile. “I should warn you, I think the press is on to the two of you.”
Harry’s throat was getting raw from all the yelling, and from the sound of it, so was Ginny’s.
She let out a relieved sound, cheeks flushed, and smiled. “Yeah, sure.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “Do we know how much we raised today?”
song-and-dance. He’d watched Percy and Oliver squirm uncomfortably through it, seen George, Lee and Angelina on the defence more than once, witnessed Pansy’s raised hackles, and Padma’s carefully calculated defiance.
“Oh?”
straight is exhausting,” Harry mumbled.
“That’s it? All right?”
“Yeah.” Hugh sniffled again.
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry about them,” he told Draco. “They argue about everything.”’
“No, it’s not that. I think I just didn’t…believe it.” Harry’s eyes weren’t leaking anymore, but he still had a lot of unruly emotions he didn’t know how to interpret or handle. One was definitely relief. Another was also definitely love. But there was all the rest, all the fear and insecurity and hope and want and confusion.
Befuddled, Harry made some hasty excuses—“Be right back, we’ll be just a moment…”—and followed Draco outside. “What’s wrong?”
“Quidditch Little League,” Lee explained. “It’s a new thing, not terribly official. I hear the grand prize is a trophy made out of chocolate. Oliver is setting it up with a couple of lads he knows, all professional players. It’s a charity thing.” He grinned. “Don’t you have a little team?”
Pansy was giving Harry a knowing look over her own pint glass. Harry ignored it and decided to change the subject. “What’s Malfoy been up to lately?” he asked her. “You haven’t mentioned him in a while.”
“Whenever? First person to get there snags tables and I guess by eight or nine most people will have shown up that are going to show up…”
“I didn’t
“I can’t believe you carry around handkerchiefs,” Harry said. “Is it monogrammed? Please tell me it isn’t monogrammed.”
“Nobody ever died of blue balls,” Draco said. “No, seriously,” he continued when Harry was going to protest. “Getting laid is not worth it to me if it hurts you.”
“I don’t know what to tell you, Draco. I don’t know how to explain this all. I just know that—all of us in there, we made our
And then all the words came, all the confusion and conflicted feelings: his entire history with Ginny and how it hadn’t always been bad, how he’d actually enjoyed being with her at first, how he’d wanted it, and then how he’d stopped wanting it, and how it’d become this—obstacle, and how it felt like it was an obstacle again, what Draco had said, what he’d fought with Ginny about every time, the ways he’d found to manage their relationship, how he used to just get it over with, the rotten feelings afterwards, his feelings for Draco—everything, just everything came out until Harry wasn’t sure anymore what he’d said or not said.
If Harry had to be entirely honest with himself, the chance to spend more time outdoors was half the reason he’d formed a Little League team. Two afternoons per week outside with the kids and the enchanted balls, and soon enough they’d get games to play on the weekends, too.
?” Harry asked, unable to hide his incredulity. He fed the phone more coins. “Are you sure you’re my cousin?”
Harry leafed through it all, slowly remembering his last session with Gladys and why she’d sent him all this stuff. He took it all back to the kitchen and sat down to read, picking up his toast again.
“Hey!” Harry called out, letting the door fall shut behind him. He was regretting having sent Draco here, to have made plans with him in the first place, because all he really wanted was to mope and wallow and let the bad mood run its course.
“I do have a question,” Draco said. “Because I want to understand. You don’t have to answer. Your issues with sex…do they have anything to do with your being asexual?”
“No, not at all, he was a model citizen and all that. I barely noticed he was there.” That wasn’t a lie, technically; Malfoy had been very quiet and made no fuss. If Harry hadn’t known he was there, he might not have noticed him at all.
“Thank you.” Malfoy pulled his gloves off and headed off the direction Harry had indicated.
“I had to chew on it for a bit,” Draco agreed. “In the end, I didn’t like it.”
There had to be something wrong with that. All right, Percy tended to be embarrassed about public displays of affection, but he engaged in them all the same. But he and Ginny…they’d always been private, though even in private Harry had never gone for cuddling when he could just look at her instead. Surely that was fine? Not everyone had to be like…a Valentine’s Day postcard, right?
“You mean legally?” Harry frowned. “They aren’t married, if that’s what you’re asking. I don’t think the law has considered triads…but it’s not…
“I’m sorry to interrupt you, but we’re closing,” Harry said.
of this is easy.” Harry rubbed his face. His food had gone cold while arguing with Draco, but he didn’t feel like eating right now anyway. He hadn’t told Draco about his therapy session yet, or about his being asexual. He’d barely even processed it yet—he didn’t know what bearing it would have on their relationship, and now they were arguing about happy endings?
Draco gave him a searching look, but Harry distracted him with a kiss. The last thing he wanted was an argument of any kind, so even if the pit in his stomach was gnawing at him, he forced himself to push the whole matter aside.
“Oh! Yes—well, depends, I’ve most of my evenings full these days, but I’d love to.” Harry couldn’t help smiling, it’d been a while. Ginny didn’t usually care for babysitting, even if the kids were her nieces and nephews, so Harry usually wound up taking the sits by himself, when Ginny was doing late night practice or overnight stays for games on the Continent.
She came out of the shower, towel-wrapped and vibrant, just after the food arrived. “Hello, handsome,” she said, and kissed his cheek. The scent of her shampoo, floral and sweet, wafted over him. “When did you get home?”
wearing
“Bisexual isn’t bad at all,” Dean agreed. He was making eyes at Seamus, and now Harry didn’t want to sit here anymore either.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m good. Is this…?” Harry extended his hand to the woman by Ginny’s side. Her…new person? Or just a teammate?
“The, uh, I picked three charities, three-way split so everyone gets an equal share,” Harry said. He was going to have to work on this for the inevitable press interviews. “The Janus Thickey Trust, The Children of War Charity, and The Lupin Trust for Werewolves in Need.”
Charlie looked up from his drawing. He nodded.
“I’m glad you came,” Harry said, and kissed Draco again. His left hand had somehow found its way to Draco’s neck, his hair tickling his fingers. Harry’s thumb brushed over Draco’s earlobe. “What are you doing after?”
What was going on?
“Love is a
Harry regarded Malfoy, and the pink spots on his cheeks, and the careful way he held himself. “I liked that too.” Neither of them had said it out loud, that the book only had queer relationships in it, people who loved the uncommon and rare, aliens who loved in foreign ways, strange and wholesome and real. “Do you…have more books like that?”
hadn’t been in touch either. He’d continued detaching himself.
Harry thought for a long time, long enough that Draco seemed to have decided he wasn’t going to get an answer. “Partially,” Harry said eventually. “I mean, it wasn’t always like this, it’s not always been uncomfortable or, or, felt like some kind of…obstacle, and it didn’t always feel so monumentally shitty afterwards—I mean, it didn’t feel
,” Ginny said, but then Love was sent off-pitch and Ginny tucked her admiration away.
Harry’s stomach felt heavy, black and thick with dread.
And now Harry was here, two days later, at a Muggle library and looking for Dudley in the phone book, because
“If you win, tap it with two fingers, like so,” Draco demonstrated, without actually touching his badge. “Don’t do it now—it’ll only work once.”
“Ugh. I don’t know.” Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, glowing with happiness as they were. “I’m not, I don’t think. I mean, I’m not straight, not pretending. You know what I mean.”
He popped into a doorway set back from the street, and Disapparated.
Parents still stuck around for practice, watching from the stands—not out of distrust of Harry, or worry for their children, but because they were as excited as the kids were. Harry suspected they also liked socialising with each other, which was a novel concept to him.
“But.” Malfoy stopped, as if he wasn’t sure what he was going to say, and Harry was so surprised he didn’t continue. The pencil kept turning in Malfoy’s hands, his fingers quick and nimble. “I, ah, when does it start?”
Harry smiled. “Ginny Weasley, of course. She’s on the other team.”
“Originally I wanted to build a brand new house,” Draco admitted. “But then I set up my workshop here, and…I thought I could transform it into something else. It’s an ugly old stone building with a leaky roof, but it could become something beautiful. I thought—I hoped, really, that we could create a home here together, something that’s tailor-made for both of us. Nobody has lived here before except for cows and probably mice and maybe some birds, but it’s still got history, you know? It’s…I
They stayed like that for a bit, but then Draco pulled his feet out of Harry’s grasp and clambered over to kiss him instead. “I’ll find you a different romance novel,” he said. “Something with a secondary plot and no Black Moment.”
he wanted to scream.
Harry left Malfoy to his coroner reports. A flick of his wand and most of the mud on his cloak and shoes was scrubbed off. He put the cloak away and went to see Mildred about cataloguing tasks, since nobody in the study rooms needed him.
. But it makes me feel better, and that makes me feel less dead, which…” he trailed off. “It makes everything better.”
“We’re ten points ahead, that’s not bad,” Ginny answered.
Shit.
“I expect we’ll know by Friday. This weekend’s donation box is still open.” Oliver clapped Harry’s shoulder. “It’s looking good, I can tell you that much.”
“You’re not staying for the game?” Rhosyn asked.
He wanted Ginny to love him. He wanted to…to get to love her back freely, without expectations, without constantly having to navigate around a black hole of nothing.
“Don’t stop on my account!” Harry hurried to say. He liked this side of Draco, liked seeing it, and didn’t want him to take it back. He’d never seen him so excited about anything, not even the most obscure coroner reports he’d managed to dig up for him. “It sounds interesting. I’ve never thought about those things.”
-lanyard, even though the colours didn’t match his outfit, but he was also wearing a badge that said
The kitchen was silent in the wake of those words and Harry almost wanted to take them back. It didn’t matter; he and Ginny had reached the point of no return a long time ago and nothing he—or she—could say would change that.
He spent the rest of the weekend packing up whatever things of Ginny’s he could find, and reading; he peeked at the poetry volume (the bookplate for that one was as lovely as the rest; Malfoy had drawn little sunflowers and mice along the bottom) and read the Muggle romance in the span of an afternoon. It was quick, easy reading, and quite possibly weirder than even the bizarre four-hundred-year-old classic—Harry suspected the writer had never met a Muggle, or set a foot in the Muggle world at all.
romance novels?” Draco had never mentioned them. He’d only introduced Harry to romance novels about straight people—was it possible that Draco just didn’t
? Why didn’t you just
“Saved the world?” Draco answered. “Can’t think of anything else, really.”
The bath bomb had fizzed out completely a long time ago, and the water was a dark purple. It should’ve started cooling, but Harry had surreptitiously charmed it to stay hot. If Draco noticed, he didn’t comment on it.
Draco shrugged. “My parents are my parents. Love me unconditionally and all that, so they…it was never an issue that I’m gay. I think mum hopes I’ll find me a nice boyfr—” He stiffened, horror writ across his face. “Merlin’s tits. I haven’t told her about you and she’ll have seen the paper.”
Draco stilled. “You want to do that?”
Before the security guard could do anything, the reporter seemed to shut up of his own accord—though Harry noticed that George’s wand was aimed at the guy. George winked, and the wand vanished up his sleeve.
Harry went to fetch him the documents he wanted. When he came back, Malfoy was studying the painting of the cherry tree. It was naked—like the meadow painting, it reflected the current weather and season, as did all the paintings in the archive—but there was a bird sitting on a branch. The sun hit it just so that its feathers shimmered in the light, reflecting back a multitude of colours.
with Draco, for Merlin’s sake—and Draco had done the same, and more. “I’m…also glad you’re doing well,” he added.
“Yeah, another time,” Harry said, feeling cold. “All right, so, I’ll…” he gestured at the coroner reports Malfoy had already looked at with the notes he was still holding on to—slightly crumpled, Harry realised, from clutching them too hard. “Deal with this. Be right back.”
Ron hadn’t understood, at first, but he’d come around, the way he usually did. Harry didn’t know where Malfoy stood—if he was aware, if he cared, if he
“No, they aren’t.” Harry watched Malfoy drive the fork into the tart, the cracks in the meringue, the fork imprint in the custard, the crumbs of the crust scattering on the plate. “Dobby saved my life.”
“That’s what your father used to do,” Harry said, immediately wishing he could take the words back. Lucius Malfoy had died alone in prison. Edwarde Edgcomb had died alone in his mansion, but it seemed there was a small difference.
Harry led the way. The café was usually buzzy with people; customers from Direction Alley and Diagon Alley, workers from nearby businesses, the staff. Today it was a little fuller than usual.
And now it was Sunday, and the game was starting in just under five minutes. Harry’s stomach was in knots; the first League game had been Saturday, DragonTamers versus Hawkins’ Hawks. The Hawks had secured a narrow victory over DragonTamers, and Hawkins had wasted no time blathering to the press about how his team was going to take the Chocolate Cup home. Harry had read the play-by, which hadn’t made him feel any better, as it seemed both teams had not just worked well together, but had ‘several aspiring talents’ on their rosters.
Yeah. That was true. “Yeah okay,” Harry agreed.
Harry’s insides flipped and the familiar black feelings started roiling in his gut. “Yeah. It’s no big deal—I’m fine, really.”
“To be perfectly honest, Harry, I don’t think I’m what you want me to be, either, and I don’t want to change who I am for you, or anyone else.” Ginny gave him an imploring look. “Are you absolutely certain you’re not gay? It would explain the…lack of interest.”
“I can see that,” Draco said. “It’s not what I meant.”
“Anywhere—so long as you’ll be there,” Harry said. He was still riding a wave of exhilaration, but it was starting to come down. Now all he had was nervous jitters. “I’m starving. Food?”
“Well,” said Draco. “That’s off the table, then.”
She hadn’t brought her bag.
Harry didn’t turn around until he heard the front door open and close and he was certain Ginny had left. Then he let himself collapse, exhausted and confused—both feeling better for having cleared some of the air between him and Ginny, and worse. He needed to talk to Draco more than ever, to understand what exactly had gone wrong—Harry was sure he had part of the answer, but he needed to think, to see Draco, find out if there was a way back.
“You know how my research is going.” Malfoy frowned.
“That’s all right. I ought to be on my way or both Lee and Angelina will have my hide,” George answered, wiggling his eyebrows at Ginny. Ginny swatted him. “See you love birds later!” He ducked out of the door and was gone.
Pansy made a scary noise and spluttered. “
“Do you want me to stay?” Draco asked Harry. His hand was on Harry’s arm, squeezing gently. “I’ve brought a book. I can go sit over there,” he indicated an empty chair nearby, “or stay with you. It’s your choice.”
He felt strangely alive, and in love, and excited, for the first time in a long time.
“Do you like lemon tart?” Harry asked as he walked in.
dead. That he’d had to come back to a world in ruins, with the consequences of his choices weighing him down with no air left to breathe.
That wouldn’t be so bad, Harry thought. He’d take a smaller rush any day if it meant he didn’t have to feel shitty afterwards.
“I had a hunch.” Ginny shrugged. “I do like to think I know you pretty well, Harry.”
It was ostentatious and marvellous and completely ridiculous, but Harry loved it and the kids loved it—having stopped cheering and screaming just long enough to notice—and there wasn’t anything else Harry loved more in that moment but the pure and unadulterated joy and awe on their faces.
Malfoy smiled. “Thank you, Potter.” He seated himself at the desk and laid out the notebook and the pencil.
“Okay,” Harry said, slowly, absorbing this new information. “But if house-elves don’t belong to the family, then how come they serve them?”
“Why not? Everybody deserves a happy ending.” Harry pushed his bowl away and got up to fetch the book he’d gotten for Draco earlier that day. Draco followed him.
“It’s a mainly Muggle craft,” Draco explained. “I picked it up when I was restoring our old properties. It’s about transforming wood—not magically, by
Harry did not see, but he paid for the bombs (and was nearly short on Muggle cash, which he did not tell Draco—these things were
Julie, clearly uncomfortable with this awkward meeting, spoke up. “Call me if you need me? I’ll be just around the corner.”
Malfoy gave him a nod, and then started digging into the reports. Harry saw that his little black notebook was halfway to filled out, Malfoy’s hand neat and tidy. He leaned in a little to have a closer look, but was thwarted in his efforts when Malfoy put his hand over the notebook.
“See you on Monday.”
He’d seen Malfoy at the Archive earlier that day and had taken his coffee break with him to discuss the book he’d been reading. It’d been a day just like any other day: thoughtful conversation and insightful analysis of the YA dystopian novel Harry had just finished reading, and they’d talked about reading a book together, next time. As in, they’d be reading the same book at the same time, and then they’d compare thoughts after.
At precisely one minute past one o’clock, Malfoy came to the Archive. Harry had checked with Albert when he’d come in earlier, but nobody had requested coroner reports that morning, so Harry had concluded that Malfoy hadn’t come back after all. But there was, standing in front of Harry, clutching the request slip Harry had given him the previous day.
“Okay you know what, I’m taking my lunch and leaving,” Harry said, though he made no move to actually get up.
After a long moment of silence, of Harry trying not to let on how much he wanted to kiss Malfoy on pain of him running away and taking his friendship with him, Malfoy spoke up. “How are you liking the new books I lent you? We haven’t had a chance to discuss them yet.”
“I remember,” said Harry. “You told me that before.” He also remembered how Draco had looked those first few weeks at the archive. Tired, oddly void of emotion.
“Thank you, that’s awesome. You’re the best,” Harry said, relief flooding his system. “I—
Harry didn’t know if Malfoy would like to visit an Irish horse farm. “Yeah. Sure. I’d love to.” He bumped fists with Dean.
The moment he reached his usual chair the front door opened and Malfoy came in. Harry tried to suppress a grin; he’d have to ask him sometime what this all was about, but for now he was just pleased to see him.
“So…you don’t want a hand with that?” Harry asked, thinking he could do that. If Draco wanted to, he could deal with it.
Well, no actual blood had been spilled, but Alice had knocked Avery off his broom and Betty had turned into a bloodthirsty pink blur on her broom, shrieking every time she got tagged, and at one point—Harry had shut that behaviour down instantly—launched herself off her broom and tackled Charlie the second he tagged her. Blur was maybe an exaggeration as these brooms were child safe and couldn’t go as fast as adult racing brooms, but it was close.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged again. He didn’t say what he was thinking; that he’d needed to keep himself busy and distracted so he wouldn’t have to think about how they were breaking up.
“Yeah.” Harry bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. “I told them you and I are dating. Kinda had to, after that picture got in the paper.”
on the shelf below that one and kept the Quidditch books on the top shelf. The copy of
Winning today was the penultimate step towards the much-coveted chocolate trophy (and the announcement of how much money the Little League teams had raised for their respective charities, which, in a way, Harry was more interested in, though he also remained loyal to his kids’ chocolate-y priorities). He’d postponed both this week’s session with Gladys, so he would have the energy to coach his team at practice, and his second meeting with Peony. He’d see both of them later when he was less preoccupied with the Little League.
Draco looked at him. “Next week,” he said finally. “I’ll come next week.”
“Thank you.” Ginny gave him a brief hug. “You can tell him I said hello.”
The light from Flourish and Blotts spilled onto the street, catching on flecks of mica in the cobblestones. Harry stared at the sparkles, recalling that he only knew it was called mica because the countertop in his and Ginny’s apartment was stone, and had those flecks, and it was called mica because Ginny had told him so.
“All right,” Draco said and pulled a large hardcover book out of an impossibly small pocket. Peony’s eyes went wide and Harry tried to suppress a pleased smile.
“Yeah—she founded it. Don’t be fooled by my extremely aristocratic white English packaging. I got that all from my dad.” Gilliam shrugged, but he was smiling proudly. “Blaise showed me your painting, the one he keeps in the bedroom? It’s very good.”
Some of the articles he only skimmed, deciding they weren’t relevant to him, but there was one about asexuality that he read all of, and some about sexual dysfunction—one interesting article surmised that in men orgasms and ejaculation wasn’t one and the same—and then there was one that stopped him in his tracks entirely. It was about Post-Coital Dysphoria and came with a note attached from Gladys.
books that Sirius and Remus had given him. Harry placed the books in the bookcase: they all fit neatly into the topmost shelf, with room to spare.
“Do you want the honest answer or the sane-sounding answer?” Malfoy was looking straight ahead.
“Edwarde Edgcomb is a tosser,” Harry said the moment Malfoy walked in, at five to two. “Also, the distribution of Es in his name is uneven and it bothers me.”
“Merlin’s tears, Harry, I wasn’t ready! I wasn’t ready to have bloody children or, or, get married, or any of that shit!” Ginny snapped back. “I just wanted to
It was almost a relief. Harry hadn’t spoken to the press in five years. Maybe he’d eventually come round to not actively disliking it.
“Yeah. It was everything you said.” Draco looked at him. His voice was still thick, and his eyes were definitely shiny. “I’m just now understanding the extent of what you’ve been through and how it’s affected you, and yes, it’s making me cry because it’s awful, and you should never have had to suffer it, and I’m having difficulties containing my empathy.”
“More than one?”
?” Harry asked, pausing at the threshold, such as it was. The inside of the barn was dim, though less run-down than it looked on the outside. It didn’t smell like cow dung at all—in fact, the only thing Harry could smell was dust and wood and dirt. The floor was a dirt floor, packed tight from centuries of animals and people walking on it, and just inside the large doors were a work bench and tools and several half-finished pieces. Fresh wood shavings littered the floor.
“Harry! You didn’t show up for practice!
“I am one hundred percent free this weekend, Draco, and I am very close to begging you to spend all of it with me.”
Thankfully, Malfoy either didn’t notice or he pretended not to notice, so Harry’s dignity remained intact.
—it wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted to be a good person. Good people didn’t do that sort of thing.
Ginny’s eyes bored into him. Harry dunked his half-eaten spring roll into the sauce again.
He looked like a wizard—he looked like he belonged on the cover of a Muggle novel, while also looking like the smartest wizard Harry had ever met. He dropped whatever he was holding and went to meet him.
“Not as often as I’d like, actually…here, this one I use a lot at the moment.” Harry plucked a purple cloud shaped bath bomb from a nearby basket and handed it to Malfoy. “This one is a seasonal product, so I’m grabbing a bunch more of these today before they’re all gone.”
“I don’t think people should have to earn their happy ending,” Harry said. “I didn’t want them to break up first. It was unnecessary. They could’ve just sat down and talked about their problems instead of being all dramatic and breaking up. I hate breakups. They tend to be pretty final.”
“Oh, trust me, I know you’re not.” Draco’s thumb moved. “But you don’t pretend to be either. Look, I didn’t mean to dredge all this stuff about the War up. I just wanted to say, I thought you’d sympathise with the protagonist and I was pleased I was right. Pretty damn smug about it, actually.”
Harry frowned. “The what?” He had almost finished his pint and was considering getting another round for the table, or maybe something to eat.
“Didn’t ask him,” Harry said, snappish. His heart beat painfully against his throat, pressing tears into his eyes. He’d never got around to asking Draco if he wanted to live together and now…it was too late. Harry had missed his shot, his one chance at doing something right.
The dread in Harry’s stomach was expanding. “Are you mad?”
There was clearly—to Harry, anyway—enough of the blue paper to go around between the three of them, but having the kids figure that out for themselves and also solve the problem was usually the best way to go about it. If he went in like some kind of tyrant and either took it away or doled out a solution the kids often felt it was unfair and would be upset about it for a long time.
“A butt dial is when you have your mobile phone in your pocket, like a back pocket on a pair of Muggle trousers, and accidentally dial a number of somebody in the contact book on the telephone,” Malfoy explained, gesturing with his fork again. “Because the buttons on the telephone can get squeezed by accident as you move or sit down. And a booty call is when you make a phone call to somebody you want to have sex with, to invite them to your house to have sex. Presumably it’s a euphemism, where booty, or butt, is a stand in for sex.”
“Can we talk about it?” she asked, inspecting the Snitch. It looked fine. “If me being here is going to be a problem—”
He’d talk to Draco. That was the first step. He wouldn’t wait for an owl—he
“Oh?” Draco smiled, a corner of his mouth curling just so. Harry both loved and hated that he knew how to read it.
“Harry!” Both girls stood up. Harry’s cousin—Peony, and it was so much easier to think of her as Peony now that Harry was face to face with her—stepped forwards. “I’m glad you came.”
“Yes, I…haven’t actually tried any of the bath bombs yet,” Draco confessed. “It’s embarrassing, but I’m kind of intimidated.”
, she wrote.
That startled Malfoy. “Daycare?”
Harry couldn’t help grinning. “You were waiting for me.”
“Deal!” Ginny pushed at his shoulder, then turned a brilliant smile on Rhosyn. “Let’s go kick arse.”
“Precisely. Of course, he was a caricature, and the people this satire was aimed at failed to realise it at the time because he was so out there. But the essence of it was, I think, that if you share what you have you will gain in the end, and if you treat others badly, you will lose.” Malfoy smiled wryly. “At the time, the concept of
The rest of the time before the kids would be picked up, went with Harry dutifully letting them dictate him messages for the cards. They could all sign their own names, with varying levels of skill, and he asked them to sign his own two cards, all the while ooh-ing and ahh-ing over their penmanship; he’d keep one for himself and the other he’d find a nice home for eventually.
“I wanted to wait for you,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to pick up some books I’ve ordered, and I thought maybe…” He looked down, carefully pulling the gloves on. They were leather, soft and supple looking, and fit Malfoy’s hands so neatly that Harry could see the contours of Malfoy’s knuckles and the tendons on the back of his hands through the leather. “Do you want to come with me?”
“You’re welcome to come over sometime and look at the horses,” Seamus was saying. “Harry’s got a standing invitation; that includes you.”
She snorted. “No, you didn’t. It was always
Harry shook his head, but he was smiling. “Nothing heroic about it. It’s just—I want this. For me. Also for the kids, but I’m being selfish here. I’m—" He paused, trying to find the words. Gladys had had a good one. “It’s…reparations. It’s what I was missing when I was a kid, and I can’t fix that, but I can try to make sure no other kid goes through what I did, you know? And I just want to help.”
Butterfly Bumpkins were playing Dragonriders, which was—if Harry recalled correctly—the team captained by a cookbook author. Her profession was clearly not a mark against the team’s skills, who were all excellent fliers and players for their age, but to Harry’s delighted surprise his own team was
Beside him, Ginny drew in a deep breath. “Harry,” she started, then stopped.
“Hullo, Malfoy,” he said. “How is our favourite murder boy doing today?”
“Uhm, hi,” Harry said when Narcissa answered the door. “Is, uh, Draco home?”
Malfoy ignored the comment and stalked ahead into the café. Harry followed, and soon they were supplied with lunch and sitting outside, invisible umbrella shielding them from the light drizzle.
“Are you crying?” Harry asked. Absurdly, he thought of the first time he had ever seen Draco cry,
Harry kissed him. Draco took his hand and once they were out of the stadium, Apparated them to Godric’s Hollow, where he took Harry to an ancient bookstore that smelled of dust, oak and tobacco, and that also served tea and coffee. He got Harry an entire pot of black tea, a table under a window that overlooked a grassy field with sheep, and several brilliant smiles.
Malfoy stared at him. Then he blinked, slowly, not in that way cats do when they’re all snug somewhere outside one’s field of vision, but in that way where one keeps one’s eyes closed for several seconds, as if reciting a quiet prayer. When he opened his eyes again to look at Harry, he paused. Then he shook his head.
“That’s what you said to me.”
“So it was a setback?” Harry was having some difficulties comprehending what Draco was telling him; the words all made sense, but the issues he was describing—Harry just didn’t understand how or why Draco would have had problems
“Ron was too obviously hung up on Hermione to pay attention to me, and you seemed…Parvati couldn’t figure out if it was Cho or Cedric or both of them you were hung up on, or if you just hated the entire extravaganza to begin with,” Padma explained.
Harry nodded, wanting so badly to agree, for it to be just that simple. Then her words caught up with him. “How’d you know it’s Malfoy? I didn’t tell anyone that.”
“Yes, yes, but use the bat next time,” Harry said, still wtf’ing. “How’s your hand? Did you hurt yourself?”
“Probably,” Harry said, dropping himself into the other chair, and grabbing the other take-out container. “Where’s Hermione?”
