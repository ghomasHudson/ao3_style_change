He also received a collection of stories that he hadn’t expected in a million years. Accounts of Draco Malfoy, helping people.
“Hey, I would never shag Molly. She is a refined woman and she deserves better. And Ginny’s a lesbian and I respect that.”
He gave Ron a book on training to be an Auror since that’s what Ron was determined to be. It was a very rare book as they didn’t want just anyone to know how to be an Auror. But of course, who wouldn’t sell to Harry Potter, who wants to give it to his friend and fellow rebel, Ron Weasley.
As the train got closer and closer to Kings Cross Station, Harry found himself becoming a mix of terrified and heartbroken. What if adult life wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, what if he messed up, what if he lost it all, what if everyone abandoned him. In his head, a thousand things that he knew would never happen, became possible. His grip on Draco’s hand tightened a bit.
The moment of eye contact nearly stole Draco’s breath. Pleasure was written all-over Harry’s face and it hadn’t even been forty seconds since Draco cast the spell.
Harry let out a laugh. “If I had known my cooking was what it would take to make you mine, I would’ve made my way into the kitchen months ago.” He then leaned over the bed and picked up the bouquet of flowers on the floor beside it. He presented the flowers to Draco with a proud grin.
Draco let out a chuckle and he moved to sit on Harry’s thighs, leaning into his chest. He felt those strong arms wrap around him and an excitement spread through him. “You’re still wearing your necklace.” He commented.
The little break from reality also gave him mind a chance to clear and he was able to process everything a bit better. He wasn't rejected, he was told his feelings were reciprocated, and he was given a time frame in which he could expect a relationship. Less than two months. Was less than two months really so heartbreaking? Apparently.
Harry let out a laugh. He didn’t know why, but he couldn’t take the idea of sex spells seriously. “You know what, sure. Go ahead.”
The next morning, Hogwarts was filled with students once more. Amongst the chaos and reunions, a few packages arrived at breakfast.
Even in some vague memory of morning, all he saw was those silver eyes and hair as blonde and bright as sunlight. To think they'd risen together that morning. But now he felt drenched in night. Nighttime used to be his safety. Those who hurt him went upstairs and he could be alone and free. Now the darkness was nothing to him but suffocating and lonely. For the calm and cool of night, with all of his safety, he'd betray the moon for sunlight.
He decided to Floo home for lunch since there wasn't much he could do without dirt on Luther. Draco was sitting on the sofa, frantically writing in a writer's book. The difference between this and a regular journal is that the parchment was enchanted. One could erase the ink on it or move words around. Harry figured it was as good as a computer. Though he was oddly proud to see Draco was using a pen rather than a quill and ink.
“You’ve been messing around with the dark arts?! Seriously?! Harry you absolute git! Are you so dense? You were lucky to survive the war, and now you want to go on and mess around with something like that! Merlin, why?”
When they got in the common room, they found Hermione and Pansy sitting on the couch by the fireplace, chatting away about different professors and classes. They seemed to get along quite well, which was a bit worrying because somehow, genius and evil were getting along. Draco could only pity the poor soul stupid enough to get on their bad side.
Harry didn’t really ask them much since there wasn’t really a way for their lives to evolve. From what he’s gathered, there are people there that they don’t know and they’ve made new friends. Apparently a few new people will show up every once in a while, but time doesn’t really exist there so they aren’t sure how often it is.
Draco raised an eyebrow and sat down, his worries being overcome by curiosity. Though he’d never found politics terribly interesting, Draco knew a thing or two about what when on. He knew it could be cutthroat and he knew how Machiavellian the members of Wizengamot could get. But to hear that even Harry might not be invincible to the dark clutches of politics sparked his curiosity. “Like what?”
Draco froze. At first, he didn’t believe what he was hearing. But now, he was outraged, “Harry fucking Potter, you’re the most attractive man on the planet! Why would you think any different?”
Draco nodded. He started saying an unfamiliar spell, made a motion with his wand, and aimed at Harry.
"His vitals are fine. I'll send in a doctor and notify the Aurors." Kai said with a small smile before stepping out into the hall.
Ron was disappointed that his friend was so oblivious, Hermione was smirking over the fact that she was about to win so many bets, and Neville already wanted it to be over.
Harry had been trying for weeks to convince Draco to come and hang out with him and his friends. Draco’s excuse was always that he had bullied Harry’s friends and felt like his presence would make them uncomfortable.
She wrote Draco after receiving a letter from Harry Potter, asking her if she was interested in a position. Neither of them could believe he wanted her there, but lo and behold, he greeted her with a nervous smile the first day Wizengamot was called.
Neville was furthering his studies in Herbology. He’s started helping Professor Sprout take care of her plants, and he’s started working with Draco to understand the plants. Being a Healer, Draco had a mutual interest with Neville in plants that can be used in potions or on their own to heal people. He’s learned to care for the different plants in the Herbology department and often comes in on weekends and cares for the plants on his own.
Harry shrugged.  “I have always been pretty secretive about things.  Growing up as I did it was second nature to feel one way but act another.   I’ve always struggled with not really fitting completely in with the Gryffindor mindset.  It’s been said by many that I’m the Slytherin in Gryffindor, little do they know how close to the truth it is.”
“Pretty good, actually.  I will be honest and say I had my doubts but so far there’s been no problems.  I don’t know if it has to do more with our ages or the fact that we’re all so tired of fighting others and amongst ourselves, but so far so good.  Your contributions didn’t hurt anything either.” He answered with a smile.
As Harry stood in front of the mirror that night he vowed he would never again agree to any deal with Pansy without major stipulations or clearly worded promises.  He was clad in black leather pants so tight sitting could be an issue and a tight black t-shirt with a green foil image of a snake coiled around the side of it.  Sweet Merlin he’d kill her.  He heard the voices from downstairs calling him to hurry up and realized he was the last one to join them.  Fuck.  Now not only did he have to wear this out, he was going to make an entrance.  “Fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK! Parkinson!  I will get you back for this!” He bellowed as he opened the door to make his way downstairs.
With the feast ending she stood and walked to the podium to begin her announcements.  “Good evening and welcome to another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  I hope you’ve all enjoyed the feast and I know you are eager to get to your dorms and unpacked so I’ll keep this as short as possible.  The list of banned items has now grown to number 743 and includes most of the Weasley products I’m positive none of you have hidden in your trunks.” She smiled knowing that even without the Weasley twins in residence they would always plague her sanity.  She refused to admit she had favorites but those two Lions were among hers.  “It is updated by Mr. Filch as needed.  You can find this list outside his door on the 1
years only.  No one except yourself and staff may enter these rooms as it will be keyed to your magical signature.  I am going to open the door and as you pass through I will cast a spell towards you and the doorway to allow you entry.  After the spell is cast please continue on into the common room where the rest of us will meet you shortly.”
Harry was finishing up his class list as he looked up and smiled at her wishing her a good morning.  “I need clothes.  Hermione got me a few outfits last year before we took off, but they got a real rough treatment being repeatedly worn and hit with cleaning charms so much.  I think one more might tear them apart.  Did you guys want to join?  I know I need at least one or two decent robes, but I prefer muggle clothes, so I’ll spend more time focusing on that.”
The two spent the rest of the night laughing and dancing knowing that while there was still a long way to go, a tentative friendship had been made between them.
The floor of Harry’s bedroom was covered in wadded up parchment he had yet to vanish.  He’d tried so many different ways the past hour to express his regret that he’d let things slip so far with his best friends.  He finally decided just to put the quill to the parchment and be as honest as he knew to be.
Harry was confused.  As far as he knew he only had the one inheritance.  “I’m sorry, did you mean to imply there was more than just what my parents left me, sir?” Harry asked.
“Without a doubt, Ron.” Harry smiled at Ron across the table.  He knew how scared Ron was of living in his shadow but he had nothing to fear.  Even if Harry had joined training with him it wouldn’t take long before Ron proved them all wrong and showed just how adept at the training he would be.  “Term starts in just a couple of weeks, why don’t the three of us spend some time relaxing at Phoenix Perch?”
After apparating close to The Dragon’s Lair Draco soon began to regret his choice.  It was late but there was still a small crowd of shoppers out in Diagon Alley and so far, all of them had reinforced Draco’s belief that the Malfoy heir was still seen as worthless. He continued down the street with his head bowed and mumbled apologies as he brushed people as he walked past.  The sooner he got around the others the safer he felt he’d be.  Thankfully he arrived without incident and he entered the club.  He took a deep breath and began to scan the room.  The club had a large dance floor that was filled with writhing bodies and beams of light that struck through the darkness.  The other side of the club was covered in a soft warm light and had multiple couches and seating areas up a small flight of stairs.  It was here he spotted his snakes.  He made his way over from the club side of the room and as he climbed he noticed a well-placed charm that muffled out most of the music from the dancefloor while still allowing enough to drift in to remind those on this side that music and dancing awaited them.
“Bollocks. I hadn’t thought of that.”  Harry blushed and muttered an apology at a stern look from the Headmistress.  “I don’t think I want to do an entire day of teaching to be honest with you.  What other options do we have?”  After wiggling a few classes around and lining up his schedule with the first year’s available free periods, they came to an agreement that would work for all of them.  Soon the dishes were cleared, the paperwork was signed, and Professor Potter made his way back to his dorm with a smile on his face and another decision made.
Harry caught the snitch that had been hovering nearby during their conversation like it was annoyed it was being ignored then made his way to his room.  He grabbed a change of clothes and took a quick shower then made his way towards the Headmistress’s office with a minute to spare before realizing he hadn’t gotten the password.  He stood there for a minute before telling the guardian he was here for an appointment with the professor.  Thankfully, the sculpture began to move to allow him to make his way up the stairs.
Millicent was happy blending in to the background.  She didn’t dislike being around others, but she didn’t like being noticed or having attention brought to her.  She was able to learn many things this way as most disregarded her presence.  She felt all the eyes in the room turn to her waiting for her to pick the next slip of parchment and it made her skin crawl.  She took a deep breath to calm herself and pushed through the unease.  She had decided this year was going to be different.  She wanted the close and easy friendships she had seen so many of her classmates make.  She no longer wanted to be the girl everyone forgot was around.  She pasted a smile on her face and reached to the pile.  “Most likely to blow up the potions lab.”  There.  She did it.  Salazar’s balls, she did it.  Such a small victory filled her with so much pride as she told herself that she’d continue with the small victories until she was sure she’d overcome the larger ones.
“Yes, I got your schedule request and I’d like to come back to that in a minute.  May I first ask if you have any ideas on how to integrate the students together more?”
As she walked around the store pondering all of this she spotted what she had been told was called a mannequin sporting a pair of leather pants she knew would look amazing on Potter and smiled mischievously.  “Potter, I’ll make you a deal.  I pick out one more outfit for you and you wear it tonight and I’ll get you out of this place as soon as the sale is final.”  She had spotted a shirt earlier that would look marvelous with the skin-tight pants.  Draco would kill her she was sure, but it’d be worth it to see his face and Potter’s reaction when he saw just want she had picked out.
“As long as I’m not cooking it’s perfect.” Sirius replied. “I guess it’s about time to replace Kreacher now that things have settled down. Maybe get a few to whip this gloomy place in to shape since we’ve got little Teddy here now.” When Sirius walked in the house after the battle at the Department of Mysteries Kreacher had dropped dead in what was assumed fear and anger after his failed collaboration with Bellatrix to kill him. With Molly around cooking constantly for the Order there seemed no need to replace him since no one really actually lived there except Sirius and he didn’t really mind picking up after himself.
She was still pretty confident that Draco was in fact Smoke.  Approaching him and asking outright would get nothing but a blank look and a denial she was sure.  Best to let that conversation wait at least a few weeks until they all got a little more comfortable with each other.  There was really no rush to solve the mystery and it was better to be patient and wait for results even if the urge to know was strong.  She knew it’d never cross Ron’s mind, but Harry might start piecing it together soon, so she’d have to watch that.  She could subtlety guide him in other directions and encourage his investigation of other people for now.
As Minerva looked out over the hall she noticed many different emotions flickering across faces.  Disbelief, anger, pride, acceptance, and what touched her the most was the relief she saw on the faces of not only the Slytherins but several from the other houses as well.  “Now, I have trust you will take my words to heart and think before acting rashly.  Tomorrow starts your classes so it is best you get to bed for a good night of rest now.  I do ask that the 8
The game continued for the next hour and a half with all kinds of stories being told and secrets being revealed.  It was discovered that if you wanted a secret kept, you could tell Hermione.  If you wanted it to get out and hear it as gossip the next day, you’d want to tell Blaise.  Draco and Hermione split the votes for most likely to go into politics.  Harry had every finger pointed his way for most likely to break a rule and found himself pleasantly tipsy rather quickly.
as an incentive to learn faster.  After a particularly brutal morning where I had spent almost 3 hours combined under her curse before lunch, I broke.  I cried and sobbed and pleaded for death.  She then told me how death was not an option and began to regale me with her stories of torture.  That’s when I learned about the Longbottoms.”
He’d always been the kind to just rush in and damn the consequences so with the decision made to find a house he decided to head to Gringotts and see if there were any Potter properties he’d inherited that would fit his purposes.  He quickly applied a glamor to disguise his face and hair and apparated to Diagon Alley.
“That would be excellent!  I’ll take a few days to decide what to do then send you an owl.”  The smaller goblin returned with the list and handed it to Ragnok for approval.  After a quick glance Ragnok handed it to Harry who simply folded it and placed it in his pocket.  He’d go over it with Sirius later because he didn’t think he could handle any more shocks alone.  “Thank you so much for all your help and your patience today.”  He gracefully bowed to the goblin and made his way out of the bank and began to return home.
years were unsure what to do with all the information they had been given.  Where did they start first?  Checking out the rooms above?  Seeing what was in the box McGonagall mentioned?  Studying the class schedule to figure out how much they wanted to take on?  No one moved or spoke for at least a minute after the headmistress left the room.  Pansy decided enough was enough and rose to check the box.  A bedroom was a bedroom and could wait at least another few minutes.  Her curiosity always got her in trouble and what could be in the box was nagging at her.  She walked back to the table and took the letter from the top of the box.  After reading the letter she removed the lid and began cackling.
“Yes….and no. I just don’t really know what to do. I’m extremely honored that Kingsley is willing to waive N.E.W.T.s for us to join this fall but I’m also so tired of fighting. Hogwarts sounds great. A year to relax without Voldemort as a constant threat. But I’m worried that as bad as it was to be ‘The Boy Who Lived’ being ‘The Boy Who Lived Again’ will be even worse. I don’t really know what to do, Siri.” Harry replied.
He shot a quick drying charm at the parchment and called an elf to take it to the owlery.  It was a beautiful day outside and he thought he’d take advantage of the weather while it lasted.  He grabbed his broom and made his way to the pitch with his snitch in his pocket.  He had thought about asking Draco if he’d like to join in a seeker’s match with him but not only had he not made his way down yet this morning, he couldn’t quit thinking of the look the blond had on his face last night as Harry came downstairs.  He didn’t know what he’d done to upset him and kept replaying yesterday in his mind attempting to figure it out.
No one really knew how much he had accomplished so far as most of his experiments were inconsequential projects with no significant use.  He made a few of them taste better, removed a possible side effect or two, it was nothing that was going to change the world of potions.  There were however, two projects that were all his own and not just reworking of someone else’s discovery.  One he was finished with and was currently telling Theo about.  The other was almost there but he was stuck on where to go next.  He knew there was a way to accomplish it, but he was so lost in the desire to see it come to fruition that he was losing focus.  He needed a fresh set of eyes or to walk away for a while and try again later.  He had never wished more that Severus had survived the war, he knew without a doubt that he’d be able to point him in the right direction.
Harry drinks his tea and thinks about Draco making tea with the right amount of honey. He thinks about Draco reaching for his favorite mug, knowing exactly where he keeps it on the bottom shelf. He thinks about Draco casting a stasis charm to keep the tea at the right temperature.
Feeling sheepish, he grabs Malfoy’s hand and looks up—to find familiar slate grey eyes locked on his own already.
Living with Draco is something like this: in the mornings, Harry will inevitably wake up ten minutes late and spend another five rummaging under the bed for a missing sock. They take turns choosing Muggle films to watch on Friday nights; they drink a little too much wine with dinner. Draco argues that beer is the worst kind of alcohol, because alcohol is supposed to either taste good or get you inebriated, what good is a cheap six pack that does neither?
Red cannot be put into a box—it’s slamming your feet down on the breaks a second too late after seeing the stoplights.
of the scissors is accompanied by the almost imperceptible sound of hair falling onto the tiles. Draco brushes a lock of hair away from his nape, and Harry shivers.
He tells them about a coffee shop which has grown to feel like a second home, about tea in the afternoons, and about late nights spent in the living room, curled up under a shared blanket.
He watched Draco arrange marshmallows on the hot chocolate. Draco was wearing dangly earrings and a dove grey jumper; there was a single strand of hair falling into his eyes. Harry tried not to imagine reaching across the counter to brush it aside, tuck it behind his ear.
“And here I was, thinking those had slipped your mind when I found moldy dishes in the sink last week.”
“I had two shots, if you recall. Unlike you, who insisted on downing two-thirds of a bottle of chardonnay.”
When Draco opens his eyes, blinking against the brightness of the room, Harry holds his breath. This time, he doesn’t draw away. He keeps his hand still against Draco’s face, palm bracketed around the curve of his cheek.
Eyes downcast, she’d taken hold of his hand, the one still wrapped around the Snitch, knuckles muddied and bruised.
“You should’ve seen his face,” Pansy is saying as he stumbles into the kitchen. She’s a blur of dark green sitting on the countertop, legs swinging as she talks. Draco is at the table, chin propped in one hand. Neither of them turns around when Harry makes his entrance.
Harry came in during the evening, after clocking out of the Ministry, and passed the time sipping his drink. When Malfoy disappeared into the back room to take his break, he brought his empty tray to the trolley nearby and made clumsy attempts at conversation. They talked about monotonous things at first, like the weather and Harry’s job at the Ministry. Later on, he asked Malfoy about Jiji, and found out he always wanted a kneazle for a pet.
There was an odd sense of déjà vu when their eyes met across the room. Malfoy did a double take behind the counter; for a split second, Harry wondered if he’d walked into an alternate reality.
Draco raises his hand slowly, the way Harry imagines he might approach a wild animal. Draco has to rise on his tiptoes—according to him, their height difference is negligible—and Harry has to fight the urge to do something incredibly stupid. Like grabbing his face and snogging him senseless, or pinning him against the door and taking him apart on the spot. He wonders if Draco would return the kiss—
He tries, and fails, to remember the last thing he’d been doing before he found himself in this strange situation.
“You’ll have to do better than that,” Draco hesitates, and then his voice dips, just slightly, “Harry.”
If he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend what he held in his fist right then was something else entirely.
" You can't hurt him! I won't fucking let you! " His hands are shaking now as he grips the man in his arms, who is dazed and starting to mumble unintelligibly.
He’s familiar with wanting—wanting to touch, to hold, to consume. But this is different, somehow. He watches the way Draco sleeps, with knees folded and half of his face pressed into the pillow.
He stops to take a deep breath, eyes widening when he takes in the object in his hands properly for the first time.
He quickly copies Malfoy’s gesture, and is immensely relieved to find a similar piece of paper in his own jeans pocket.
“We do have cleaning spells,” he grouses, even as he’s moving to spread the newspapers out. He does not think about the second part of what Draco said.
In July, he asks Draco to clear his schedule for the second week of August, and proposes a vacation to Greece. “We should live a little,” he says breezily. “The Ministry has already approved my request for a leave of absence. Apparently, I’ve got quite a few vacation days saved up. A change of scenery would be nice, eh?”
Draco sets his wine glass down at dinner. “You didn’t have to do this,” he says. There's a pretty flush stealing over his face, but his gaze is unwavering. “I wasn’t expecting you to arrange something like this.”
The words come out slurred as he tries to figure out whether his trainers have laces. Draco is there, drowning in an oversized pyjama shirt, hair tousled like he’d just woken up. He looks disgruntled as he tugs Harry to his feet, holding his elbow to keep him steady.
Harry stays true to his Seeker’s instincts, dodging Bludgers while scanning the horizon for a glimpse of gold.
It feels something like being submerged in a world buzzing with white noise. He can make out thin rivulets of darkness seeping through the sea of light.
Harry gawped for a second too long. “Malfoy. Hello. Er, I’d like...a coffee to go. And a bite to eat as well—perhaps a pastry?”
The seats are upholstered in navy velvet, the windows framed with gleaming silver metal. Everything looks relatively posh- and more importantly, magic-free.
He’s just witnessed something personal, something which wasn’t meant for anyone, probably, much less him.
“ Here, “ he says, shoving something into Harry’s lap. He sits down again in the seat across the aisle this time, so they’re facing each other.
Draco set the mug on a tray, and one of the other baristas stopped by to collect the drink. He gave Harry an unfathomable once-over.
He was somewhat surprised, too: he’d never have pegged Malfoy as a cat person. Back at Hogwarts, Malfoy didn’t have any pets, though Harry did remember his eagle owl—a hefty, tawny-eyed bird—for some reason.
Even now, Harry flounders for the right words. For a long time, too long, they’ve become fluent in ineffable language. He knows how to read between the lines, to hold a warm mug between reverent palms and understand its weight. Words, on the other hand, sit heavy on his tongue. He opens his mouth and feels full to bursting with everything left unsaid. If he had to describe it one way or another, Harry would say—
“None at all.” He plasters on a wide grin, hoping to mask any signs of apprehension. “We’ll have a blast, I promise. And tomorrow we can spend the day at the beach. Maybe I’ll get that tan after all.”
They’re trapped in that moment for eternity, caught somewhere between hatred and something far stronger.
He forgets about the allotted one hundred and sixty seven words for the first time since the new policy was placed.
Malfoy has turned back around in his seat, so his face is unreadable when he answers, sounding faintly irritated.
Besides, there’s something slightly unsettling about the scene in front of him, though he can’t quite put his finger on it.
Filled just over halfway to the brim, the bottom of the Penseive is no longer visible within mere seconds, appearing to transform into a depthless void.
It was a force of habit, or so Harry told himself. He was reminded of sixth year at Hogwarts—checking the Marauder’s Map for traces of Malfoy, stealing furtive looks across a crowded dining hall, the deep-seated conviction that Malfoy must be up to something. It vexed him to no end.
“ It’s not like we’ve got much of a choice, have we, Potter? We’re still at square one. We might get some of the answers we need, but only if we finish what we started. Why, getting cold feet yourself? “
He’s fairly certain he’s able to distinguish dream from reality by now—he’s thirty seven, after all, and he’s been practicing ever since he could remember, being no stranger to nightmare plagued sleep.
“Your hair is getting long,” Draco says. When he lowers the cigarette and turns around, Harry finds himself rooted to the spot.
The blood roars in his ears. All he knows in that moment is pain. He lashes out at the hands restraining his body, the room tilts nauseatingly, the edges of his vision blurs, and the next thing he knows he's falling.
Draco comes in with a pair of scissors and a stack of newspapers. He tosses the newspapers at Harry and raises an eyebrow. “I’m not cleaning up,” he says. “And take your shirt off, unless you’re planning on changing into a new one.”
Their barbs no longer seem to have the lethal edge they used to hold back in their school days. Neither of them is willing to back down, and yet conversation is surprisingly not unpleasant altogether.
When Draco slipped away from the counter to take his break, Harry followed him. He ignored the way his palms were sweating.
The coffee was sensational. His first mouthful left the impression of a rich, velvety hot chocolate, shot through with just a hint of bitterness and the faint trace of something nutty. The pastry: a golden-brown tart topped with glazed raspberries. When the tangy cream filling melted on his tongue, followed by an explosion of sweetness, Harry thought his soul vacated his body for all of three seconds.
“I’m still afraid. Afraid of mucking this up, somehow. Or worse, what if I don’t? That doesn’t make much sense, I know. But what if we do this,” he lets out a harsh breath, “and it’s everything we imagined? Because right now, that’s what scares me the most. Knowing we could have that, but never trying.”
He’s familiar with wanting. He wants to sit at the kitchen table for hours, wants to dwell at the bottom of a swimming pool, wants to say, I know you like your tea with one sugar, and have it mean, I know you. His hand is suspended in midair, hovering over Draco’s sleeping profile. Harry is eleven years old again, trapped in the entrance way of Privet Drive. He reaches into the flurry of envelopes, desperate to catch just one letter. He grasps at air and they seep through his fingers like quicksand.
He became a regular at the café, and Malfoy made him something different every time. He tried sticky caramel buns with a frothy flat white, sour cherry and pistachio Danishes with a steaming mocha, and cinnamon apple beignets with a silky hazelnut latte; his days became that much sweeter around the edges.
Ron gripped the back of a chair tightly, face taut and stunned. " Mate, " he whispered at last. " I'm really sorry. "
The corridors were silent, just as silent as they were during the day. He thought about using up his words right then, whispering feverish wishes into the shadows.
He can all but feel Draco rolling his eyes as he reaches across the table to nudge them in his direction. “We’ll work our way to complete sentences sometime in the next hour,” he says.
It’s ugly, but the way it leaves him breathless makes him think it’s more than beautiful has ever made him feel.
In the tiny, cramped bathroom stall, he grips the edges of the sink and stares hard at his own reflection.
This is what he remembered: there was light, and there was music. He was floating in the pool, wet clothes clinging to his body like a second skin. He could hear someone calling his name, and when he opened his eyes, Draco was there, standing under the moon.
He freezes in the doorframe, caught between stepping forward- and facing his Slytherin classmate, and retreating before he’s noticed.
They were confused sometimes, if they happened to catch a glimpse of themselves in the mirror. He'd then quiet them with a forceful kiss which bruised and they'd forget the questions they'd been about to ask.
" I'm the bloody Savior, aren't I? Why won't you leave me alone? He's fine. I'm fine and we're both- "
They arrive at noon, to a clear blue sky and an expansive view of the rugged coastline. Santorini is warm, the air dry and the occasional gust of wind briny.
It’s a small victory, remembering this piece of his past, but he can’t help feeling marginally relieved, as if some of the weight on his chest had just been lifted.
He forces his eyes open again. Swings his legs over the side of the bed he's lying in. Ignores the stabbing headache pulsing in his skull constantly. Someone notices him.
“ But it’s one of my memories, yes, and it wasn’t tampered with or anything in case you were thinking somewhere along that line. It was... a dream I used to have. A recurring one. “
Harry pulls the ring box out of his pocket, and sets it on the table. “I want to marry you,” he says. “Will you let me, Draco?”
, he'll say into the darkness. The words are almost like an incantation. He savors the way they taste on his tongue.
Harry can’t help but notice that he looks even worse for the wear after their trip through the Penseive.
" Goodbye, " he says simply. He makes it as far as the other end of the room before someone grabs him.
It’s a brown leather suitcase, slightly battered but still in decent condition. The weight of it is considerable.
Frowning, he’s just about to lean forward to tap the man when he’s thrown off balance by an unexpected surge of nausea, sending him crashing none too gently into the back of the mystery man’s seat.
" Mr. Potter? " The nurse has been talking for a few minutes now, and is looking at him a little uncertainly.
When he reached the counter, Draco was there. He was pouring hot chocolate into a mug, the mouth-watering scent wafting in all directions. Alex looked frazzled, but she gave him a little wave from afar. “Hey,” she said. “Harry, what can I get for you?”
Alex looked between the two of them with palpable interest. “So, Harry,” she said. “How do you know each other? Draco never tells me anything about his personal life.”
He’s twenty-five years old, and he loves just as desperately. He holds Draco’s face in his hands. He says, I think about you all the time.
“ Ever so eloquent, Potter. Please do continue to enlighten me with these brilliant observations of yours. “
It’s a legitimate threat, Harry knows. He inhales deeply and tightens his grip on the mug. The weight of it, along with the heat, feels like an anchor.
It looked good on him. Malfoy looked every bit like he’d just stepped out of a cologne ad, in a collared navy button-up and dress pants. He was also wearing an apron.
He was thrown by the question. Before he could answer, Draco spoke up again. “You said you wanted the pumpkin drink, right? I’ll make you something else. And if it’s no good, well, it’ll be on the house.”
He lets loose a bloodcurdling scream of guttural rage. Ron is in front of Hermione in a split second, grabbing his arms and shouting words which don't make sense repeatedly in his ears.
Classes carry on in much of the same way, except these days the only sounds filling the classrooms are the scratching of chalk on blackboards and the occasional rustle of papers or scraping of chairs.
The previously clear liquid begins to glow as soon as it touches the Penseive, taking on an enticing golden hue and swirling around slowly.
Unblemished by clouds and veiled in a porcelain sheen, an air of threadbare chilliness bled slowly from the horizon. He stood amongst a tight huddle of others. The light was an unrelenting stream of energy etching itself into the back of his mind, even through firmly shuttered eyelids. A blaze of white against an artist's black canvas, perhaps. Or a comet in the night sky.
He no longer answered calls and increasingly lengthy letters from Ron and Hermione. He placed wards around his Muggle flat in Muggle London, cast disillusion charms over the shabby building he now called home. His robes lay dusty in the back of his wardrobe.
They nod and squeeze his hands. He never misses the way Hermione's shoulders shake as they leave, Ron's arms wrapped protectively around her. He sees the way her face crumples ever so slightly when he tells them he loves him. He can't fathom why, though.
These are clearly no ordinary memories, and he can’t help but think that there are far too many places in his own past he’s spent years running from.
He had no idea why Malfoy was working in a Muggle café. He didn’t have the faintest clue as to how Malfoy became a barista, of all things. Part of it was curiosity, but there was something else Harry couldn’t quite place his finger on. The café had a perennial quality to it, a sense of being removed from the bustling streets outside. At the same time, it fit seamlessly into the space it occupied. Maybe it was the ambient music playing softly over the speakers, or maybe it was the way the tables were never empty for long in the afternoons.
It strikes him as inexplicably funny for some reason, that of all people, it should be Malfoy in this hallucination with him.
He found a table by the windows, next to a bookshelf lined with old records. A black cat leapt onto the bookshelf and gave him an unimpressed look. The cat’s name was Jiji, he learned later.
“ No, I mean... it’s not just that. All of this, it feels off, somehow. I can’t pinpoint what it is exactly, but it’s bizarre. It’s like... we’re missing an important piece of the puzzle. “
Harry’s mouth goes dry, and the rest of the conversation is abruptly forgotten. “Come here, you,” he murmurs. Draco loops an arm around his waist before leaning in—to press a feather-light kiss to his cheek. He ghosts another kiss over the shell of his ear, and Harry makes an inhuman sound.
“ For the love of Merlin! Yes, alright? It was a nightmare I couldn’t shake for years—I even took sleeping potions at one point to try to make it stop. Forgive me for not being eager to discuss this subject any further. “
For a moment, Harry can feel panic rising in his chest. He hasn’t found any luggage with him, and he has no recollection of buying any ticket in the first place, either, so—
In the near distance, a tooting horn signal sounds, and Harry begins to question if he’s somehow stuck in a bizarre dream or hallucination.
The front door jingled as he pushed it open, and he was immediately greeted by a blast of warm air. The café was busier than usual, which hardly came as a surprise; it was that time of the year, after all—Christmas holidays. London was bustling with life: the traffic was even worse than usual, the streets were crowded with commuters, and shops everywhere were lit up late into the night.
He wakes in a blinding white room. Shapes move in the distance, eventually solidifying into human profiles. A thousand smells and voices hit him at once.
“It wasn’t even anything greasy,” he protests. “Besides, I only left the plates there for a night. How was I supposed to know mold could grow that fast?”
Wild windswept hair, eyes tinged with red. There are scratches on his face. His nose appears slightly swollen. His lips are bleeding and an unmistakable purple bruise is blossoming on his forehead.
Harry tries not to imagine Draco’s expression: lips pursed and eyes narrowed in concentration, brows just slightly furrowed.
He knows what it means to fall for someone: to want more than what the hands can hold. He lies in bed next to Draco, cups his face between quivering palms, and wants to wake up the same way again and again. He slots his fingers with Draco’s, cradles the fluttering pulse under his thumb, and wants to keep holding on, never loosening his grip.
His cheeks are slightly flushed as his voice rises, and it’s only then that Harry notices the bruise on his jawbone.
Saying his name out loud felt like a minor revelation. It came with surprising ease—the transition from one name to another. He wondered if this was what it meant to know someone, to have their name roll off your tongue without resistance. Draco refused to call him by his first name, but pink bloomed across his cheeks the first time Harry said his.
He’s grateful there are no probing questions, not even when he stays behind long after everyone else has left for dinner, only a bottle of water and a towel waiting for him in the locker room.
When he showed up at the café a second time, he asked Malfoy to recommend something else. Malfoy’s expression stayed neutral, but there was an infinitesimal quirk to his lips as he rang up the register, fingers flying deftly over the keys.
When he pushes open the rickety door in front of him, for a split second, he wonders if perhaps this is nothing but a strange dream after all.
“She used to be a stray,” Malfoy explained in between taking orders. Harry rested his elbows on the countertop and listened. “She’d show up outside the café at the same time every day, at nine on the dot. She napped on the windowsill.” He paused to take a ceramic tumbler from the cabinet behind him.
They sit across from each other at the table, sunlight spilling into the room and staining the walls. Harry takes a clementine from the fruit bowl and sinks his thumb into the top of the skin. He peels the pith and pries the flesh apart, wordlessly hands Draco half a clementine. Their fingers brush; neither of them looks away when their eyes meet.
Harry lifts the hem of his shirt, ready to undress before Draco snatches his hand. “Wait,” he says. They’re standing close, so close that he can see Draco’s lashes fanning out across his cheeks. He’s discomfited by the spike in his heart rate.
“ Merlin’s sake, “ he mutters under his breath, briefly wondering why he ever thought this would be a good idea to begin with.
“I hope that works out for you.” Dean said with a soft smile. He was a bit unsure of how he was meant to address Harry’s situation. It was strange, to say the least.
Narcissa gave him a small smile. “Just, give him some time. Eventually, he’ll want to make the best of it too. I think you two will learn to get along. I’m sorry Lucius did this to you, I tried to fight him on it but he’s the head of house, it wasn’t up to me.”
“Thursday? Thursday is tomorrow, Dean.” He pointed out and he then decided to ignore the fact that Dean’s eyes widened at the realization that Valentine’s Day is only tomorrow. He must have forgot. "That's a bit too soon for me. I need to think it over first."
Draco was hit by an overwhelming wave of pleasure. He threw his head back in a silent scream as he came into Harry’s mouth. He was silent only a few seconds before his body trembled once more and he began to chant Harry’s name in shouts that slowly quieted to broken whispers.
He shivered at the feeling and felt the tongue press against him. He closed his eyes and sighed when the wet muscle slowly slid inside of him. Only the tip was in and his hole gave no resistance to such a small and pleasurable object.
Harry’s messy mop of hair framed his face as he lifted himself from Draco's body. “Really?” There was something so sweetly surprised in his tone. Something so innocent. It was as if he'd just been promised candy or flowers. The child-like excitement that he had displayed nearly made his lover laugh. For as cute as it was, there was also something crude about it. He was so openly excited, without a hint of nervousness or shame, about being taken.
The blonde mistook Harry’s struggle for a hint and he raised up to pull his own shirt off, tossing it aside before he quickly went back to moving his hips. Though he teased, the sounds under him were amazingly beautiful. He could listen to them all day. They called out and without words, asked for more. Some sounded low and relaxed, others more frantic and breathy, it was all so tempting. Harry might be below Draco, but it was his voice that moved the blonde’s hips. Every movement was for him.
Seamus glanced at the necklace and commented, “Your dad must of been a real charmer getting your mum a necklace like that.”
Draco eventually looked down and raised an eyebrow when he saw he was being stared at. "Having fun, there?"
Because of it all, Draco felt like he was drowning in a sea of affection and love. He loved it. He’d never felt so cared for and pampered in his life. He found himself bragging to all of their friends about how amazing Harry is. They found it to be amusing, and it encouraged Ron to ask Harry for a bit of advice.
Alongside his newfound comfort, Draco was utterly shattered. His entire outlook on his father had changed, and he had to come to terms with the fact that even in his happiest childhood memories, his father wasn’t a good person. He was broken. He loathed everything, but he couldn’t loathe Harry. He was just too nice. “Why are you being so nice to me? You cook, you clean, you do everything.”
“Harry gave it to me.” He mentioned with a soft smile. “His mother had a silver necklace with a lily charm on it. Her name was Lily, and Harry’s father James gave it to her. Harry found the necklace earlier this year when he went through the things they left behind. He hasn’t taken it off since. He gave me this bracelet so we could match. He told me Christmas is when he realized he loves me.”
“As beautiful as it is when you wax poetic, now really isn’t the time. I’m certain you can find something a bit more helpful to do with your mouth.” He suggested.
For this, he relied on Seamus. Rather than mention the article about how desirable Harry is, he mentioned that his friend told him about an article on the richest wizard families and that Harry was on it. He went on and on about how surprising it was because there were so many rich wizarding families with big businesses, so he couldn't fathom how Harry was richer than them. He went raved about how improbable it is. Because of this, the ever curious Seamus silently decided he would buy a copy when it printed next week.
Dean turned around and grinned, giving his friend a hug. “Hey, mate! I haven’t seen you in months! I’ve read about all the things you’re doing in Wizengamot. You’re doing great.” He complimented.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Seriously?” He was genuinely surprised the weather was a reason to like Scotland.
Harry’s lips parted in shock and he felt his face burn at such a suggestion. No one has ever flirted with him like that before. But the comment went straight between his legs. “D-Draco.”
The blonde beamed. “I felt the same way. At some point I knew I was falling, and I chose to let it happen. I wanted it to happen. I ..... I can’t even begin to tell you how happy that makes me.” He pulled Harry close and wrapped him in a hug. He buried his face in the other’s wild curls and felt the gentle scrape of stubble against his neck. It was all so sweet and it warmed him to know that his feelings were finally, completely, requited.
Draco tilted his head, a bit surprised and impressed. "Huh, that's actually pretty smart." Though he didn't show it, his mind began to wonder. He'd heard of the Sorting Hat's struggle to place Harry in either Gryffindor or Slytherin, but he didn't realize how true it was until now. Perhaps Harry did have something cunning about him. It made him wonder what else there was to Harry that he didn't know about.
Harry gave him a broken smile, “Thank you.” He mumbled before curling inward and covering his face a moment.
The newfound honesty was strange to Harry. He never thought he would tell anyone about what actually happened. But there he was, spilling it all to his friends. He never thought anyone would know. But once he started, he let it all out, “Then school came around, it was the only place I could eat. But it was stressful to balance school, homework, and my chores. I didn’t have friends. My cousin bullied everyone into staying away from me. Most people ignored me, some helped my cousin bully me. I was isolated and abused. I had nothing. I didn’t even have a room, I slept in the cupboard under the stairs. Although we had a few guest rooms. I didn’t have toys, or anything. I never had birthday or Christmas presents. When they found out I was a wizard, they lightened up some because they were afraid of me. Now, I don’t talk to them, and they don’t talk to me.”
Of all things, Greenwood let out a laugh. "Of course. Some idiot wrote about how great he is and now he's leading a bunch of morons against you two."
Harry raised his eyebrows as he considered the theory and found that it sounded as if it was probably true. “Yea, you might be right about that.” He thought it was kind of funny that they acted as opposites. “I like when he’s reading a book and he’s really focused on it. He makes this little face when he’s focused and it’s so cute.”
Harry’s spent nearly three months focused on himself. He’s meditated, read self-help books, spent time with friends and family, taken time to mourn his losses, said his goodbyes, written down his feelings, recognized commonalities and worked on fixing it, he’s even taken care of himself a bit better by exercising when he can. It made him feel great. He no longer needs to stand in the sun to feel alive. But it didn’t fix him.
Harry let out a soft chuckle at how cute Draco looked. It made the blonde shout and squirm from the vibrations. Harry raised an eyebrow and seemed to somehow smirk around Draco’s tip.
It was then that Draco realized how old his mother was. Of course, he never thought her old. But the tired lines on her face, the grey streaks that Draco used to see as an aesthetic benefit, and her thinning frame made Draco realized how worn down she really was. Before the war she was as radiant as a young woman. But now, she was brittle and exhausted with age, the weight of the war speeding up the aging process. And now, this.
When she left, Draco and Harry were still pretty shaken from the news. They spent the rest of the afternoon in each other’s arms, only parting to eat dinner. Neither felt like cooking so they just had leftovers.
He glanced over a the book of erotica and considered picking it back up, when he was struck with a much better idea. He and Harry couldn’t be in a romantic relationship at the moment, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t still pursue Harry now that he knew their feelings were mutual.
The blonde was confused until only a second later, his necklace sent a warm feeling into his chest. He grinned and let out a chuckle.
Harry paused and seemed to think a moment. “It isn’t that I don’t want to. I do. I really do. I suppose I’m just scared. I trust you, but I can’t help being scared.”
He muscled through the last page and they finally finished. He cut the used parchment off of his roll and then packed his stuff up with Hermione. “I’ll sent it to Shacklebolt after I get home.” He said as they left the library and headed to Ministry. They said their goodbyes and each took a Floo home. Hermione seemed to be in a great mood, happy that they finally finished their project. But Harry was worried. This was so incredibly important to him. This was his childhood. He really didn’t want to mess it all up.
Harry’s heart stopped and his hand flew up to grip he silver Lily still around his neck. It’s been there for months. “You know her?” He was shocked to say the least. His voice was little and broken. “She’s there? I-In the same place as you?”
Harry’s lips parted in shock. He didn’t know how to respond to the filthy things Draco said. He wanted to touch himself. He craved pleasure. But he didn’t want to ruin Draco’s plans. He refrained, but he couldn’t stop himself from shifting his hips impatiently.
Harry bit his lip and looked away before giving a slow nod. “Y-Yea. I did. I needed to cum. I could hardly control myself.”
“Not that I’m complaining, but would you mind letting me up now? I’d like to hold you.” Harry said softly, somewhat hushed by the passion between them.
The first few thrusts were hesitant and careful. Harry didn’t have much of a response as the mix of discomfort and pleasure was almost confusing to his body. But as his form gave in and the discomfort slowly faded, he began to whimper and shift. But part of him was a bit smug as he felt Draco occasionally twitch inside of him.
"Of course. The wizarding world isn't modern enough to carry this stuff." He mumbled into his drink. The wizarding world had a fashion of it's own that centered heavily around long robes and modesty, while Harry was finally confident and reckless enough to show himself off a bit. So, when deciding where to shop, it was only natural for him to drift to muggle society. "I also got myself a self-help book, because I realized I might've spiraled a little out of control. I've also picked up meditation. I don't do it very often, but it's quite nice. I really think I need to figure out who the hell I am now."
He furrowed his eyebrows, slowly able to identify most of them. He and Harry’s lives had always been intertwined, and thus, he was present for many of them. “I’m so sorry to have marked you in such a terrible way. You shouldn’t have to wear them and be made to remember.”
"From what I've gathered, Pansy would fit well. They think her to be like them, but we know she has ideals closer to ours. We could offer her something in exchange for talking to Luther's followers after we slam him in the press." Hermione glanced over at a clock and grew a somewhat anxious expression. "Minister Shacklebolt is expecting me in the next ten minutes so there's one last thing I ought to tell you. I've heard of a group in Wizengamot that Ministry officials have dubbed The Silent Seven. Younger members who seem to be on our side but don't speak much." She pulled out a piece of parchment and a pen, since she was in too much of a hurry to bother with quills. She wrote down seven names and handed them to Harry. "I have to go, but I wish you both the best of luck. Send me a letter tonight and let me know what happened."
Harry did as he was told and felt the cool metal hit just outside of his shirt. The necklaces were simple chains of silver with a single rosebud at the end, carved in a great amount of detail. It wasn't too big, but it was just enough to catch eyes.
He wrapped his hand around himself and tried to think of anything else as he finally moved. His head turned to the side and he took a deep breath at the steady and relaxed pleasure that drifted between his legs. Draco was the type to enjoy taking his time. He knew where he was going and was languid in getting there. It was a lesson his old lovers had to learn the hard way as their impatient hands were chided by his slow mouth and hips. Frustrating as it might be, they always gave in to him, and enjoyed themselves far more than they expected. The thought of those old flames had him moving his hips into his hand, rocking himself in his tightening fist. His lips parted and he let his body relax against the bed, slowly taking his pleasure. He wished he could lay like that for hours, but if he tried, he could last a little over thirty minutes, though that required occasionally stopping. The thought of laying in pleasure was far more tempting than the frustration of stopping and his favorite nights went just like that.
Of course, it was noticed that Harry Potter was going to every table, except Slytherin, and whispering about something.
Draco squinted as if he knew exactly what Harry was doing and wasn’t going to allow it. “No, I’m not going to let you do this.”
He pulled himself off the floor and braced his body on the sink, staring at himself in the mirror. He hated everything that he saw, and it was so ugly, he laughed. He hid his face and carried his emotions to the nearest Floo.
A smile crept onto Draco's face and he shook his head. "I think it's going to happen soon. He said before February, and it's already January tenth. I think he needs just a bit more progress at work."
He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He went out with Draco that day, fully aware that they might be seen and made a public spectacle, but somehow, now that it's happened, he was surprised. The paper didn't even try to imply a relationship, likely due to their past, and he was grateful for this. He decided that this was the best possible outcome of their outing together and let it go.
As he was laying down to go to sleep, Harry realized that he would finally consider he and Draco to be friends. It had been rough, but maybe that’s what they needed to turn around and get along.
They talked a bit more about relationships and such, but Prongs didn't seem to have much to say. He wanted to say more, he was finally getting to have a conversation with his son. It was more than he could have ever hoped since he died. He wanted to give Harry advice on relationships, he wanted to talk with him about charming potential paramours, about his own dating experiences, he wanted to tell Harry everything. Even if it was eighteen years late, he was getting a second chance. At first he was saddened by all the things he missed out on. But now, he was determined to step up and play a role in Harry's life. He became ecstatic.
They both ended up talking. Laying their trauma on the table. Harry went from the day his parents died, the abuse at the Dursley’s, Snape’s obsession with his mother, the many times he’s almost died, the friends and family that died, all the way to the time that he did die. Temporarily.
“Oh lover, this feels perfect.” It was then that Harry decided he wanted to be immortalized in a living painting, just Draco and him, forever in hedonism. He never wanted to stop. They were nothing more than animals.
That received a few murmurs from around the room. Draco just looked at the floor, he hadn’t intended on anyone ever discovering his actions, but now he was thankful that people told their stories.
Although he didn't consider himself a celebrity, he was very aware of the power his name had, especially written on a bill. There was a weight to it that he used to despise, but now, he was finally seeing how to use it to his advantage. "So, how exactly to you plan to take on the wizard elite?" It wasn't that he doubted her ability, but he needed to know what to expect. All his wars and battles had been physical, he had never been in a legal battle like this.
Harry got up and rushed into the bathroom to dress and brush his teeth while Draco woke himself up and got dressed. They switched rooms so Draco could brush his teeth and fix his hair while Harry waited impatiently.
Draco watched him, he couldn’t help it. He had a refined taste and he knew when he saw something pretty.
“You never had to kill. Even when you wanted to, you never took a life until that day. You’re upset that you killed someone.”
kind of escort. Then again, I can appreciate a bit of assertiveness.” He commented as he trailed behind Harry.
The blonde chuckled and shook his head. “Not all the time. But ..... often.” He tempted as he reached for his wand, casting a cleaning spell on them both.
“Are you insinuating that infidelity isn’t grounds for divorce?” Molly asked, incredulous that he was so determined to take away any chance of divorce.
“Especially when this particular person is suppose to be sentencing a man who committed violent crimes.”
"Harry, I'm ..... I'm proud. I am so incredibly proud of you. You've come so far and you're trying to heal. I just think that's amazing." All charm and any silver tongue left him, and in the wake of such a raw and real moment, he couldn't utter the words hung in his throat. So he held Harry closer. Perhaps that was enough.
Harry then handed him the present he got for Teddy. It took him a long while to dig it up and get it ready, but he managed to do it a few days ago.
Draco let out a laugh, “What the hell, Harry? Is that really it? You’ve never been attracted to anyone else?”
Draco stood and headed into the kitchen, pouring two glasses of wine and pulling some of Harry's chocolate out of the fridge. He went back to the sofa and set everything down on the coffee table. He cast a quick charm to light the fire while he waited for Harry to return. When he did, he did so in his pajamas, completely done with the day.
"Does that remind you of someone?" Harry asked softly, not wanting to draw the attention of the Aurors just across the room.
Harry winced a bit, sort of nervous that his friends might not like that he defended Draco. But instead, they all seemed to be okay with him. They even congratulated Harry on his testimony.
A loud and low groan tore from Harry’s throat. It was unfiltered and raw. His face went red and he felt his inner thighs already starting to quiver. The rush of new pleasure had him aching from how hard he had become.
A confused smile graced Draco’s face. "What?” As much as he didn’t understand what Seamus was implying, it was still a bit amusing to hear.
Next up was Pansy’s solo mission. It was the start of October by then, everyone was getting fed up with how long it was taking.
Alex blinked a few times before moving to frantically take notes on what they had just been told. The nature of their conversation shifted into something more akin to an interview and Alex got their story.
It was so carefully thought out and socially perfected. Draco was momentarily confused as to why Hermione was a Gryffindor rather than Slytherin. He blinked in surprise and sent off a quick thank you.
Now Draco was hopeful. He felt his back straighten and he fought off a smile as it wasn't appropriate for such a serious moment. If Harry needed time then he could very much respect that. He was okay with waiting. It wasn't as if there was anyone else he could pursue. He didn't doubt that a few weeks ago, Harry wouldn't have minded if Draco saw someone else. Even though most couples with an arranged marriage didn't mind making it work, many were in a silent agreement that after a child or two, they would remained married but see other people. That sort of arrangement was once a possibility, but now, he couldn't do it.
“He doesn’t want me just for sex.” Harry whined in defense of Draco, “I don’t even know if he likes me back.”
Draco laughed and looked over at Harry with a grin. “You really are lucky you’re cute. Normally I wouldn’t let someone of such a low class even gaze upon my beauty for so long, let alone touch me.”
"It sounds like you were in shock. No one's ever attacked you for something like that. I see why you reacted differently."
They cried together, talked, and there was no judgement or hate, only openness and forgiveness. They all wanted to heal and they did it together.
Harry's jaw dropped. He’s never been so bluntly desired before. Draco genuinely wanted to flirt with him and he spoke about it so confidently. He almost didn’t know how to react. His cheeks went pink and his eyes flickered away to look at anything else. “Well, sure. That’s okay with me.”
Though the warning made him suspicious, he went against his better judgment and laid in the bed. Harry couldn’t help but to relax when Draco threw his arms around him. He scooted into the blonde’s chest and felt exhaustion take him from the near-week of shitty sleep.
From that point on, Draco never teased Harry again. But there was also a change. A permanent one. Draco and Harry had, without doubt, crossed into something deeper than casual friendship. They were close and held an intimate knowledge of the other. Perhaps this is what happens when two people are made to live together, but they couldn’t help but to get close.
Along with the imprisonments, many Death Eater families were hit with hefty fines to make reparations for what was destroyed in the war. Funnily enough, after Harry returned everything, most Houses ended up selling a good portion of their properties to take care of the fines thrown their way. It shook the finances of Wizarding society, and although Harry relinquished almost everything he had gained, the House of Potter was easily one of the richest wizarding families by the end of it all. Harry found amusement in this.
Harry shrugged. “Because we weren’t doing anything. Usually we start flirting and kissing before I do anything, or you’ll just sort of pounce on me, but we were just sitting around and I was looking at you and thinking about you too much. I didn’t want to bother you.”
Very short chapter on the one year anniversary of the war. I could have written more, I could have made it a huge event. But I didn’t. This is what felt right.
By some unspoken understanding, no one takes on the position of opposing Seeker to challenge him for the coveted Snitch.
Ron sets his beer down and exchanges a look with Hermione. Before either of them has a chance to respond, he continues. “It's weird, innit? We live together. In the same flat. I still can’t get used to some of the things he does. Like, he never squeezes the toothpaste from the middle. He rolls up the end of the bloody tube, who does that?” Ron fiddles with his coaster while Harry talks, and Hermione watches him with a knowing expression. Neither of them interrupts, though, so he plows on.
Draco made him a milky colored drink with chocolate sauce drizzled over the side and whipped cream on top, garnished with chopped peanuts. There was a small plate of biscotti, too: lemon and gingerbread. The lemon flavor was a bestseller, Harry knew. At this time during the day, they were usually long sold out.
The days pass easily. He finds company in an old lady next to his bed, and they discuss the weather sometimes. Occasionally he's allowed to go on walks in the gardens. He dreams of strange things some nights. Those are the nights he wakes drenched in sweat and a distinct feeling of unease.
“I’ve got to get this out, and this is now or never, so don’t interrupt, alright?” He swallows hard. “I used to be… I was afraid. Afraid of my own feelings. Of what they could mean. And I was—I was a right knob. After that night, when you kissed me in the pool, I should’ve said something sooner.
The tea sends warmth traveling down Harry’s spine. Heat lodges in his chest and wraps around him like a weighted blanket; he tastes honey. When Harry forgets to turn the mug around, he finds the chipped edge enveloped in a protective charm. A few days earlier, Draco grumbled about the stupid blue mug which ought to be thrown out, really. He reminded Harry, not for the first time, of the dozen other mugs they own, none of them lopsided or hazardous.
The roaring in his ears is getting more insistent by the second as he dazedly stumbles towards the sliding doors and nearly falls face first into the next train car.
They haven’t seen each other in years, and they’re both adults now—surely they can manage to at least be civil throughout a train ride.
, he'll tell anyone who's willing to listen. If he closes his eyes, he can remember standing in an ever expanding train compartment. He smiles when he sees someone walking towards him.
Without his glasses, he can’t make out Draco’s expression in the dark, but he can feel his pulse thrumming. As he drifts out of consciousness, the bed dips ever so slightly, and Harry thinks, home has four walls.
“I don’t know where we’ll be in another five years. Ten, twenty. And not knowing can be scary, sometimes. We could be completely different people, but… whatever that may look like, we’ll never be strangers again. Because I know you. I know you, Draco.
Draco glanced up from his drink and nodded at Alex. “I’ll just finish up here.” Harry began to apologize, but Alex waved him off with a wink.
Draco doesn’t answer right away. He hums in lieu of a response, taking a long drag from the cigarette pinched between his thumb and forefinger.
Harry was floored with how strict and proactive Professor McGonagall was being.  He didn’t doubt that without this ward there would be retribution seekers attacking in the halls and abandoned classrooms.  He was curious about the new dorms she mentioned since he trusted Hermione to take care of their shopping list and hadn’t seen the note about black robes instead of house robes.  He hadn’t even noticed the robes he was currently wearing did not denote a house.  He just put them on when handed them by Hermione.  He glanced around the few remaining in the Great Hall.  There weren’t that many of them.  Hermione and him were joined by Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Pavati from Gryffindor.  Slytherin had the next highest return rate with Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode, and Theodore Nott. Next came Hufflepuff with Justin Finch-Feltchley, Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, and Hannah Abbott.  Ravenclaw was only met with Padma Patil, Morag MacDougal, and Stephen Cornfoot.  He nodded in acknowledgement to a few and stood to step closer to Professor McGonagall when she indicated for them to come closer.
He heard the disbelief and scoffing from the crowd that had grown since he began.  He pushed down the nerves he had begun to feel and pressed on.  “You don’t believe me?  Voldemort started out his war to protect pureblood ways and stop the muggleborns from switching our traditions into theirs.  Before even the first war with him was over that agenda degraded into killing all muggles and muggleborn.  With the second it was anyone who disagreed with him or that he saw standing in his way.  Pureblood, half-blood, it didn’t matter.
Everyone in the room laughed and pointed to Neville.  “I can’t help it!  I’m actually not that bad when Snape isn’t breathing down my neck telling me how terrible I am.  I’d never get an O or even an E but I’m confident I’d get an A if not for him.”  He pulled his 12 shots towards him shaking his head.  “I might be the one running around starkers before long if I have to take all of these right now.”
The week passed in a whirlwind.  Draco met with Pansy and Blaise both together and alone, perfected the taste aspect of the Skele-Gro and was working closer on how to remove the pain the potion caused, and today was currently waiting on Pansy outside the new café on Diagon Alley so they could get the supplies they needed for Hogwarts.  Why he showed up on time was the question he was asking himself.  The day the woman was on time was the day he streaked naked in Muggle London.
Harry wiped the sleep from his eyes and grumbled as he rolled out of bed.  He had spent most of the night sitting up staring at the flames in the fireplace and drinking too much Firewhiskey.  When Draco’s owl came in he nearly threw up with nerves.  It was well past 4 in the morning when he pulled himself into bed to attempt to get at least a couple of hours of sleep.  He managed to drift off for an hour or two before his alarm began to wail bringing him back to a reality he wasn’t sure he was ready to face.
Standing on the platform of 9 ¾ was a bit over whelming for Harry.  The past two weeks at Phoenix Perch with Ron and Hermione was just what they needed but going from the quiet and calm villa to the absolute chaos that was happening in front of him was astonishing.  He loaded his trunk and boarded the train.  He was making use of a glamour again to avoid the masses as well as to hopefully find an abandoned compartment to relax a bit before the train left the station.  He soon found one near the back and entered.  He couldn’t lower the blinds until Hermione joined him but he wouldn’t remove the glamour until those were pulled either.  Hermione knew him well enough that she’d recognize him from his body language alone.
Pansy was floored.  She didn’t know what she expected to hear but this wasn’t even on the peripheral of her thoughts.  “I don’t even know where to begin, Draco.  Merlin, you went through all that alone?!  Why didn’t you tell us?  You know we would have helped you any way we could.” Pansy cried.  Her heart was breaking for her best friend.
Harry attached the letter to the leg of Siri’s tawny barn owl and watched her fly away.  He then walked back down to his bedroom and decided a bath wouldn’t be remiss.  He could soak away a few worries in the deep tub his bathroom offered and hopefully smother the nerves that were eating him up about the reply he’d receive from Hermione and Ron.
Hermione had been awake in the common room for almost an hour when she saw Harry head towards the showers upstairs.  She smiled and waved at him and went back to her quiet thoughts.  She had noticed Draco’s behavior last night towards Harry.  She didn’t let on and didn’t plan to at this point.  It could be nothing more than curiosity, but it felt much more possessive than that.  So for now, she’d sit back and observe.
“I am Dolly, sir.  I am Head Elf.  This is Suzy, Elle, Hetty, and Sammy.”  Dolly informed him pointing at the other four elves.  “We are Master’s personal elves.  If Master Harry wishes Dolly can call in the kitchen, grounds, and household elves for Master to meet as well.”
“I can understand wanting to live under the radar, but even if they don’t want the world to know, I need to know just to thank them for what they’ve done.  There is nothing in this world I could ever dream to repay them with and my thanks alone is almost insulting for all they’ve done but it’s something I must do.” Harry was vehement in his words and belief.  This mattered more than anything he had ever done.  The wizarding world wanted to paint him as a hero simply for doing what he literally had to do.  Smoke had the option to do nothing.  Instead they chose to fight at great risk to themselves.  That was a hero.  That person deserved the front page.  Not him. “I’m going to send an owl off to McGonagall, I want to see her letters as soon as possible.  I also need to inform her I’m returning after all.  If Dumbledore felt Smoke was a student I might as well track that lead down first and see what it produces.”
‘Ok,’ Harry thought ‘one thing decided.  I need a house of my own.  That wasn’t so bad.’  Maybe with this choice made the rest would fall into place.  At worst they’d still sit there waiting for action.  It didn’t really matter because at least he was making progress and would have something to tell Sirius at dinner tonight.
Theo taking a seat next to Draco brought a smile to her face.  She had such an enjoyable day out with him today.  The two spent hours talking about history, famous authors, and customs both magical and muggle.  He challenged her brain in ways that no one ever had before and pointed out inconsistences in her knowledge that would have taken her a very long time to recognize, if ever.  Yet, he did it in ways that weren’t spiteful or sneering.  It had actually taken her a while to realize he was even aware of what he was doing as his redirection and comments were so gentle.  She smiled as she made her way closer to the duo.  While she couldn’t talk to Draco about she wanted to tonight, she could get to know him a little more and if spending more time with Theo was a consequence of that, then all the better.
“Would you be likely to run through the Great Hall starkers, Potter?” Pansy smiled in question while they moved the glasses and Firewhiskey to the table in the middle of the couch.
Questions pushed aside as nothing more than the whining of a child no matter that he hadn’t actually voiced them aloud he took a deep breath and pulled the box closer to him.
“After all the romantic nights in the woods the three of us shared I thought we had left the modesty behind.” Harry smirked and pulled his pajama pants on as he rose to open his bedroom door.  He hadn’t slept much at all last night because he was so worried about the reaction his letter would bring.  He opened the door with a huge grin and threw his arms around the brother and sister of his heart.
Draco shut off the water with a wave of his hand and began to dry off.  He needed to let Blaise and Pansy know and plan something to do with them.  He also had to inform Mother and watch her try to contain her glee when she realized her plan had worked.  With only just over 2 weeks left until term started he could suffer through her smug knowing glances.  He dressed and called for Nippy and asked him to tell his Mother he needed to speak with her when she was free.  He then made his way towards his desk to start penning the letter to his friends.
Harry could see Hermione’s eye twitching so he politely greeted then dismissed the elves.  It would be much easier to sort out who did what without Hermione around to make him feel as if he was taking advantage of them.  “Well, I vote we explore at least the ground floor at least and then head back to Grimmauld before we dig into this box.”  He walked further into the entry way and was blown away all over again.  There was a double staircase leading up to the next floor.  The floors continued the marble throughout the ground floor at least but he felt confident it would be a feature that was carried on all over the house. He walked back towards the pool area and noticed the entire back wall of the house was made of sliding glass doors that disappeared as he slid them back to open the house into the deck.  The décor could use replacing.  It might have been Dumbledore’s Gryffindor pride or it might be the inspired by the name but the gold and scarlet that covered nearly every surface was just a bit much for Harry’s taste.
“That is completely up to you.  As our incoming first years were almost double the normal size due to parents either not sending them last year or them being muggleborn, we think it would be easier to have 4 classes instead of the regular two.  You’re looking at 2 classes of 40 students or 4 classes of 20.  You won’t have an assistant like you did in the D.A.”
Harry wordlessly handed the letter over to Hermione to read and then tore into the pile of parchments from Smoke.
“I’m not sure but hopefully it doesn’t require camping in the woods and living on the run again.” Harry joked.
He wasn’t exactly ignoring the jeers and hateful glances, but he wasn’t acknowledging them either.   If the past few years had given him anything it gave him a thick skin and an unwillingness to back down when faced with unpleasantness.  He watched the people passing while sipping his tea.  Most were content to ignore him just as he was to ignore them.
Draco laughed at her antics as he stood and sat back down in the chair next to her.  This Pansy was much easier to deal with than the crying Pansy.  “Thankfully with as far back as whatever ancestor it was the affects aren’t that bad.  I feel a constant pain without my mate but it’s manageable most days and when it’s unbearable a strong pain killer potion dulls the worst of it.  Physical proximity helps but contact is better for relieving it.  I do not have wings at this time and my research is contradicting itself with some books saying I never will and some saying they will only break through upon the first mating.  I haven’t noticed an allure either but I’ve not tried because trying to get other people off in the middle of a war is the least sexy thing I can think of.  I will not die without my mate, thank Merlin, but no other relationship holds any interest to me.  I think I could kiss or even have sex with others without any pain or backlash but I’ve no desire to find out if that’s true.  I want the best for my mate feel a desire to make sure they are happy and cared for but so far I’ve pushed down the desire to claim them as mine.  Seeing them with others isn’t enjoyable but I’ve yet to rip anyone’s head off.  Mother knows but I kept it from Father and see no reason to inform him of it or anything else in my life.  The day the Aurors lead him away was one of the best days of my life.  Mother thankfully doesn’t care about the need to ‘continue the Malfoy line’ that Father always spat at me so she wasn’t planning on pushing witches at me until I married and reproduced but I didn’t want to leave her in the dark either.”
I found a spell in an old family grimoire that layered on top of the potion could help as well.  It is supposed to remove ill effects of misdeeds but is rather open to interpretation.  It was widely used from minor effects to major effects.  The problem is that it requires multiple casters to fill roles.  One caster must have a personal connection to the victim, one to the original caster who did the harm, and then two grounding casters.  It appears to be an easy spell to learn and cast, but requires a lot of power and the intent must be pure.  It has failed in the past according to the notes due to unequal cooperation and the links not being close enough.  We’d have to have Lady Longbottom or Neville himself help.  Neville would be closer, but if it failed, it would be unusually cruel.  Myself or my mother would work for the connection to Bellatrix, or if she was uncomfortable with either of us, she could ask my Aunt Andromeda.  I’ve never met her, but I can’t imagine her refusing.
They all summoned a quill and parchment and wrote down their entry.  “I’ll clear the table off and get the shots ready.  Join me, Potter?” Pansy drawled.
He looked up as the others had finished reading the letter saw they all felt the same.  “I don’t know exactly how I’ll figure it out, but I need to know who this is.  Maybe McGonagall’s letters give more clues.  I’ll have to contact her.”
Minerva felt a bit guilty asking but she really had no other idea what to do.  There was just too much to teach and not enough time in the day for one person to do it.  “Harry, I’d like to offer you limited employment.  I’ve talked to the board and explained the issue as well as your history with the D.A.  They are in agreement that your results there and in your own life speak for themselves.  You are a superb teacher and I hope one day to offer not limited but permanent employment.
Harry raised his arm and looked upon the face of the man who had at one time been all he had ever wanted.  He closed his eyes when Draco placed his hand on his forearm and collected himself before they were whisked away in apparition.
I don’t really know what to say or where to start.  I sat up all night thinking what I’d say and trying to get the words together but it all came out as some kind of verbal vomit.  An apology is the obvious go to but what exactly am I apologizing for?  I am sorry you were left alone and had to go through all of this without me.  I’m sorry I missed out on so many years of my son’s life.  I’m sorry he doesn’t know me as anything more than an idea of a person.  I’m sorry I hurt you by walking away.
Pansy winked and replied “Who says I haven’t already?” She then took a seat and pulled Harry down next to her.  “Potter, take a seat. Let’s get the party started.”
“Of course, Mr. Potter, you can come back at any time and we can combine the vaults or direct the gold to wherever you would like it to go.  It’s no trouble at all.  If you’d like to owl ahead and request an appointment we could provide you with a portkey to activate 5 minutes prior to bring you directly to this room to avoid crowds if it is more convenient as well.”  Ragnok quietly summoned smaller goblin and instructed him to check and make a list of all properties under Harry’s ownership.
Caelum must come first no matter if we decide to pursue a relationship or not.   I think the best thing we could do at this point is put our feelings aside and focus on him and building a relationship for the two of you.  Maybe when that’s stable we can look at if there can be an us or not.  I doubt my feelings for you will ever really change and while I’ve gone on a few dates here and there with others, it’s not anything I’ve ever bothered with.
“Good morning. Hope bacon and eggs are fine with you again. Neither of us has been to the store in a few days.” Harry remarked as Sirius entered the kitchen.
“Just Harry, please.  Thank you for holding on to this for me.  No, right now I think we are just going to roam a bit.  We won’t be staying long today but I will be moving in soon.  May I ask your name, please?”
“Well, we’ve tried all we can and there’s simply no way we can fit all the DADA classes Professor Daniels has on his schedule.  We thought about asking the ministry for a rotation of aurors to help out with the lower years but are wary of asking them for help again after the disaster their last contribution was.”
Draco woke the next morning feeling as if a Bombarda had been aimed at his head.  He made his way to the bathroom and quickly downed a hangover and pain relief potion before making his way into the shower.  The steam and heat from the pulsing water helped wash away some of the aches and pains.  He was used to the low dull ache that always persisted but considering the traits his creature blood could have brought him he’d accept the pain.  It simply would not do to sprout feathers from his head nor for a beak to replace his mouth.  His research seemed to lead him to believe if he was closer to his mate the pain would lessen.  It could completely disappear with frequent contact but he knew that would never happen.  He had made it this long with no one the wiser and he would continue to do so.
“I appreciate the thought, but it’s us.  Together or not at all.” Harry replied.  He placed his hand on the box and felt a tingle of magic ripple across his hands to verify he was the one to open it.  Removing the lid, he saw a bundle of folded parchments tied together as well as an envelope with his name on it.  He pulled both from the box and opened the envelope bearing his name.
“Are we talking figuratively or literally on the bollocks?” Padma asked as she waggled her brows at Seamus.
There was a sharp tapping at the window.  Draco looked over to see Artemis, Blaise’s owl, at the window.  He opened the window to allow her in and called a house elf for owl treats.  “Have a rest, lovely.  I’ll send off a reply soon.” Draco quietly stated.  As he broke the wax seal and skimmed the contents he was surprised at how quickly Blaise followed up with the information.  Upon reading he understood why he sent it less than 2 hours after he left the manor.
The potion might never work and even if it did, it might not work for anyone other than the Longbottoms but he’d be damned if he’d not at least try to right the wrongs with the talent he’d been blessed with.  He no longer cared about bringing honor to his family name, he cared instead about bringing peace and maybe joy to those his family had hurt.
Dumbledore had left him 4 properties.  One called Eagle’s Landing that appeared to be another large manor, a cliffside cabin off the coast of Wales, a small cottage near Hogwarts, and something called Phoenix Perch.  There was no description of Phoenix Perch just the coordinates.   Harry was quite eager to explore both the cottage near Hogwarts and Phoenix Perch but he had no idea what to do with all of these houses.  Between the gold, the property, and the puzzle Harry knew exactly who he needed to help sort through the mess.  It was time to reconnect with Ron and Hermione.
“Draco. Did you know he was the first wizard my age I’d ever met?” At Pansy’s shake of her head he continued, “I walked into Madam Malkin’s for my school robes and was instructed to stand next to him for measuring.  Godric, but he was a little shit even then.  I didn’t say much to him beyond a few words as he looked down his nose at my lack of knowledge of anything.  I didn’t even know what houses or Quidditch were.  Eh, looking back it seems pretty inconsequential and I can see how he was simply imitating what he had grown up seeing, but as a kid who had always been bullied and treated poorly, it wasn’t a good first impression.  Add in to that Hagrid telling me about Voldemort and he had murdered my parents and then Draco’s dismissal of Ron as unimportant and beneath him on the train and I refused to be in a house with him.”
“Don’t think I didn’t notice your avoidance.  It can’t be that bad Draco.  Being in pain daily for pure stubbornness is madness.  Tell me who it is so we can plan how to make this happen.”  When Pansy paused Draco stood and walked to the large window that over looked the gardens.  She couldn’t remember when she had last seen him look so pensive.  She couldn’t understand why he was avoiding the question.  She had never spoken a word of gossip about him and had actually stopped it more often than not.  He was acting as if it was some major secret he had to protect.  There was no one that could be that big of a deal.  Whoever it was between her, Blaise, and a well behaved Draco they could repair any reputation or relationship.  Well, maybe except Potter.  That would be tragic and damn near impossible to fix.  Her eyes widened “Sytherin’s hairy nutsack, it’s Potter.”
Harry nodded as he put the last few products he had in the box onto the shelf in front of him.  He then stepped outside, raised the wards on the bottom half of the property, and conjured a sign on the door that stated they would reopen at 2.  Just a few minutes later Fred joined him, and they began the trek to Caelum’s school.  The two made small talk after Harry asked about George and were halfway there when Fred broached a subject that was normally intentionally avoided.
year students and would open it and the new rooms for the Heads next year.  When they reached the door Minerva turned to the gathered students to inform them how to access the rooms.  “This area is meant for 8
The notes went on and on in this manner.  This was extraordinary.  Whoever Smoke was obviously had their own reasons for their actions but none of that was important as how much death and destruction they stopped.  Even if they had only saved Sirius he owed them a huge debt but this?  This left no question in his mind that he had to find just who this unknown hero was.
As the first term went on they both realized how broken the other one was and took comfort in each other.  First it was simply helping each other through the nightmares and being on hand to talk about them if either wanted to.  Before long they noticed they both slept better if they slept in the same bed.  That inevitably led to cuddling, which lead to what Draco liked to call “Harry Potter’s Great Sexual Awakening”.  They agreed to keep it casual and secret.  There was no need for whatever they were doing to be known by anyone.  The papers would have had a field day crucifying Draco and doubting Harry’s sanity all over again.
The morning passed by quickly and before either man noticed it was almost noon.  “Fred, I’ve got to go get Caelum soon.  Why don’t we close up for lunch and you join me?  I can check with Molly but I’m sure she’ll watch him afterwards and I’ll come back and help you for a few more hours.”  Molly rarely turned down time with one of the grandkids.
“Morning Nev, not much.  Just about to send my owl off to McGonagall with my classes. Have you got any plans for the day?”
“So, you still want to sort the students, and give them a family so to speak, but you want them to also feel comfortable reaching out and getting to know other houses just as well?”
Draco let out a soft laugh. “No, I think it’s quite charming how you figured it out.” He paused a moment as he felt a rush of confidence from Harry’s reaction. He felt like he had a wining move in a game of chess. “I even figured yours out.”
The flirting only continued from there and it flustered Harry greatly. Nobody had ever flirted with him so openly and shamelessly before.
“You’re right, you aren’t. But you don’t have to be to feel numb. Taking a life, whether they deserved it or not, whether you wanted to or not, is traumatic. Numbness is how you deal with the trauma of having killed.”
Harry blinked a few times, “When did you get taller than me?” He had never really paid much attention to the other’s height. They had also never stood close enough for it to be noticeable. But here they were, half a meter apart, which was close for them.
Draco blinked a few times in shock. His mouth opened and closed, his lips tried to form words but nothing happened for a moment. “Alright. But why do you look and smell like you were near a fire?”
Through the rest of the conversation, his mind reeled. Moony has the same birthday as Remus, he died around the same time as Remus, Remus is a werewolf and therefore has a connection with the moon, and Moony always gets very eager when Harry talks about Remus’ son.
He gripped Draco’s thighs as he tried to bent his knees to get his heels on the edge of the bed, wanting the leverage to thrust into Draco.
It didn't surprise Draco to discover that his father was scouring legal texts for a solution. He didn’t doubt his father also yearned for revenge against Narcissa and Draco. His only hope was using the money in his personal vault to find his own place and escape, until he received a letter from Gringotts informing him that his account had been frozen by his father. When he asked about it, Lucius had the gall to laugh and said he wasn’t going anywhere until he had his wine back.
A groan escaped Harry’s lips. Heat flooded his lower half and he couldn’t think. He wasn’t used to that. He always thought. He thought about what to do with his hands, about the noises he made, about how he was moving his hips, and about what they would do afterwards. He was the Golden Boy and expectations followed him everywhere he went. But suddenly, they were all gone. Draco never saw him as the Golden Boy or the Chosen One, only Potter. In that moment he wasn’t sure of who he was or what he was meant to do. He was only a body that sought the pleasures of the flesh.
Just as he finished getting it ready, Draco appeared in the Floo. He'd spent the day in Paris with Blaise. Although he was no longer the man his father had wanted him to be, had separated himself from the elite, and was satisfied with his life with Harry; he still loved to indulge himself in the same sins that once owned him. Foods with names that were impossible for most to pronounce, designer robes, social gatherings with a more tolerable high class, ogling fine men, and it gave him the chance to practice his French.
Draco's voice came as a surprise to them both. Harry turned with a raised eyebrow, "Going to do what?"
“Do you think he knows that I love him?” Pansy, Blaise, and Narcissa look up at Harry, a bit surprised. “I never said it. But I should have.”
He followed behind Harry, ranting and raving about how terrible it is that someone may have had sex with Harry Potter, the world’s most desired virgin.
It took everything in Alex not to snort. “Oh yea, you’re a bottom. Which, somehow, is even more unexpected.” They tilted their head as if contemplating it.
Lucius raised an eyebrow. “He may try, but legal changes cannot be made without the presence of all members of Wizengamot, and with the full moon is approaching, some of those monsters will be gone for the next few days.” He grinned, deciding to rub his victory into Draco's face just a bit more. “But time really is of the essence, because if he refuses the offer, or if he takes longer than a day to respond, I'll sell your right to marriage to the highest bidder. I suppose you're lucky that Potter really is a nice lad, always putting others before himself. He would never let a person be sold like that, especially after his little outburst in Wizengamot. You should have seen The Quibbler yesterday! The story of Potter's childhood made the front page. Quite distressing, yes?”
They also realized it was well past sundown and they were probably going to be in trouble if they got caught.
Draco rolled his eyes and grinned at Harry. “Fine, but know that I usually don’t do it on purpose. I can’t help my beauty.”
Draco also spent some time keeping up with the news. He read all about Luther’s sentencing, the masked attacker, celebrity gossip, and other little pieces of news. He read on a series about people afflicted with lycanthropy, their struggles and the way they cope with their transformations. It was very educational and it made him feel stupid for having ever thought negatively about them.
He gave a soft smile. "Thank you for understanding. I really don't need a lot of time. Before February, I promise."
him have his orgasm. He felt like his desires were disgusting. They probably were, but he didn’t care. He wanted Draco to make him cum. His mind went to all the possibilities that Draco’s knowledge of kinky spells could bring. He had a twisted fantasy playing in his head. One where Draco uses magic because Harry needs to learn to relax, and pleasure is the best way to do it. One where he brings himself to cum against his friend’s hand.
Harry let out a chuckle and handed Draco a small baggie full of the gingerbread pieces. “Alright. Step one: assemble the houses. The icing is meant to act as a glue.” He said as he also passed over Draco’s icing.
Harry gave a nod, “Go ahead.” He could tell that Alex didn’t actually expect to get this far, they were probably used to being turned down.
“I didn’t think it was important. I also didn’t realize I had a crush on Draco until Christmas.” He never wanted to admit to feelings that he wasn’t completely sure about. He hadn’t been completely sure about how he felt until Christmas. With their increased intimacy, Harry felt like they were already dating.
It then dawned upon Harry that he hadn’t smiled in almost a year. “Oh. I suppose I just woke up one day and didn’t smile anymore.” He said with a casual shrug.
Draco, Harry, Dean, and Seamus were the only ones who knew what was going on. They were talking about what they were in to right under their friends’ noses. It was sort of funny to them. Like they had their own secret.
St. Mungo’s was easily one of the best hospitals in the wizarding world. They were known for their care of patients and families, hospitality, leading research in medicines and potions, 24/7 staff, and success rates. They also shared their research with other hospitals. He would describe them as the St. Jude of the wizarding world, but they worked with patients of all ages and went beyond cancer. They were also more localized and didn’t take on international cases.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Oh, well in that case I recant my apology because I don’t care.” His own sarcasm helped him feel a bit better.
But Harry changed too. His had his own silent and steady determination. Something of an anti-hero, willing to make sure the right thing happened, regardless of the cost.
Draco popped a window out of his gingerbread house and ate it while Harry moved to sit beside him, handing him the small box. He accepted it and eager unwrapped it pulling out a silver necklace with a small lily on it. He grinned and put it on. “Jewelry, Potter?”
Harry blinked at the question, still on the verge of hyperventilating. “Uh, b-blue?” He somehow wasn’t sure if that was the right answer.
There weren’t many emotions when he thought back on those days. In fact, he rarely ever felt anything when he thought about it. Which is why the way he felt now, sitting on the sofa with Draco, made no sense to him.
As for the situation with the House of Crouch, Bartimus Crouch Sr., who was now a very weary man, told Harry that the House of Crouch might be better off in his hands. He decided that if he was so terrible that his child would be a Death Eater, and he would be manipulated by Voldemort, then perhaps it was time for his House to come to an end. Harry was in line to inherit hundreds of thousands.
Hagrid’s birthday came around a bit later. Since he started teaching care for magical creatures, a lot more students have been getting to know him. Because of that, Harry managed to get a little over a hundred students to show up to a surprise birthday party that McGonagall let him hold in the Great Hall. Hagrid was so happy he nearly cried. Songs were sung, they danced, listened to Hagrid’s stories, and Harry baked Hagrid a birthday cake. “Thank you Hagrid, thank you for everything.”
They talked about plenty of things. But they didn’t talk about the dead, that was too hard and some things were just better left alone.
He never thought he would be physically attracted to Harry, but of course he was, Harry’s the most charming and hilarious man Draco’s ever met. Not to mention how gorgeous he is.
Pride filled Harry as he started going faster and sucking a bit harder. He needed to make Draco cum. He wanted that more than his own orgasm. Part of him was embarrassed by the pride he found in making Draco cum. But he also embraced it. It gave him a sort of sexual power that he had never had before. Right now, he was in control. He decided whether or not Draco would cum. It was an intoxicating feeling. The body before him began to tense up and the cock in his mouth felt as if it had just somehow gotten even harder than before. He knew his lover was about to cum. He knew and made he decision to let Draco cum. Now the power was in his hands.
“It comes with an ink cartage inside of it. A pen will usually last months before you need a new one, much cheaper than constantly buying ink and the occasional quill. They also come in big packs. You can get a couple for cheap.”
Harry was intoxicated by bliss, but Draco was utterly shattered by it. He was held captive by the noises Harry made. His tongue groveling for more. He was broken and the splendor of Harry’s pleasure was his only remedy.
Harry was offering him forgiveness for everything he's ever done, for both of their sakes. He was doing it so they might be happy with their lives.
He was getting better every day, and he was so proud of his life. Pomfrey even trusted him to treat minor injuries all by himself. He’s become especially fast at bandaging people up, and he’s always been excellent at potions, so he’s even brewed a few medicines.
Draco propped himself up on an elbow and he cupped Harry’s hand with his own, bringing it closer. Words couldn’t describe how sexy he found Harry’s innocence to be. He wrapped Harry’s hand around his length and the warmth made him let out a soft sigh. It felt nice.
The shower was much better. It took him a while to realized that he had stopped washing himself and was just sitting on the shower floor. He blinked and wondered when that happened, but no answer came. Still, the limited colors felt so much better to him. Their overwhelming nature made sense to him, but he couldn't place how they had become duller to him. If his hospital comparison was correct then it should feel brighter than normal. Whenever he pictured his sitting room before Draco was attacked, it was somehow so much brighter. But those memories didn't irritate him or his eyes. In the end, he didn't care very much to figure out why he colors were so different now.
Harry laughed a while and had trouble stopping, continuing to erupt into giggles every time he made eye contact with Draco.
Harry didn’t even hesitate to clap for his son, who looked back at him, unsure. But Harry’s smile and applause made him take his seat at the Slytherin table with a grin.
“I’m not. Most people who want to be with me, want it for their own reasons. They want to be with me for my fame, money, status, etcetera. Others don’t want to be with me for those same reasons. I want someone who doesn’t care about any of it. That doesn’t leave many options.”
He's never heard Harry screech before. He's never seen Harry flail his arms, fall off a sled, and tumble down a hill. He's never seen Harry throw his head back and laugh like he did when Draco fell. Not until today. Something about it was oddly intimate. This was a never-before-seen look into who Harry is as a person rather than as a student or a soldier. He saw a glimpse of something more, a glimpse he had never gotten until three weeks ago when they started spending their evenings together. Something about it was just so lovely and although it was beyond freezing outside, Draco felt warm. He also felt himself smile, his heart occasionally flutter, excitement rush through him for seemingly no reason at all, and he felt like a fool for it all. But he wasn't upset. Even if none of it worked out in his favor, he was happy to have what he had, while he had it.
"You've got to be fucking kidding me." Draco mumbled as he covered his face. He rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath, looking around the room.
Courtesan originally mean a person who attends the court of royals. Modernly, it refers to an escort with rich and powerful clientele. Both meanings seemed to intertwine for a sick and insulting play on words.
Harry tilted his head, he found himself at a bit of a loss. They knew so much, but there was no mention of three guys that his mother was friends with in her journal besides his father, godfather, and Remus.
“Still, you’re all out of it now and you look exhausted. Don’t do it again. You could hurt yourself.”
“Don’t worry about it. I’m Slytherin, most people don’t trust me.” He was used to being treated differently because of his house. He considered it part of the reason that everyone else in his house was so easily swayed to Voldemort's side.
He was about to shake Draco awake, but then he got an even better idea. He leaned down and pressed gentle kisses on Draco’s neck.
Draco only nodded. “That’s okay. Politics change people and makes them do things they normally wouldn’t. It’s alright that you don’t feel bad.”
Draco let out a laugh and shook his head. “Sure. Anyways, that one is called Call of The Sea, my fourth is Yuletide. It’s about two best friends who room together in Hogwarts. It’s their last year and they have huge crushes in each other, but one of them has to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, so the Yule Ball is going on, and they’re trying to work up the nerve to ask the other to the ball.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Whatever. You say this as if you weren’t there the same. You were your father’s little angel, remember?”
Draco frowned but continued to shop with Harry. He couldn’t believe how nonchalant the other was about the possibility of going blind. Still, he knew Harry was more concerned with Christmas and The Cupboard Project to worry about himself. He can only handle so many things at a time.
After spring holiday, a student was quick to point out the new ring on his finger. His wedding ring was silver with an emerald shaped like a snake’s head.
Harry thought a moment but soon realized he didn’t want to choose. He was embarrassed. So he only shrugged and said, “Do anything, I don’t care.”
Pomfrey tilted her head, looking at him a moment. She’s watched him grow up through the years, all in all, she’s proud of the person he’s become. She decided to take a chance and gave him a shrug. “Alright then. Come by whenever you can. Help out enough and you may end up being my unofficial assistant.”
Draco leaned closer so their noses were nearly touching. “Harry, look into my eyes. What color are they?”
It wasn’t hard to find some eager young member of Wizengamot, ready to prove themself. After making the idea of digging up dirt on Garren seem like the idea of the young man he’d spent the last half hour talking to, he encouraged his acquaintance to go after it and see what he could find. When he inevitably found complaints filed against Garren, he reported them all to Harry, who passed it on to Alex.
They were in a bubble. Just them. The outside world didn’t exist at all. There were no worries, hesitations, or doubts. There was nothing beyond the walls of their room. They were together, safe and sound in a bubble. Nothing else mattered.
Some of the mail was invitations to commemorations and events, and some of it was inquiries from journalists. Every once in a while, they would find that they had nothing better to do and found write letters in return to the journalists. A few questions weren’t too bothersome. But the events and commemorations made them all hesitant.
“I know. I'm used to seeing him in his school uniform, and where I'm from, I rarely saw men dress so nicely. It's just sexy.”
Harry then let his fingers slip under the waistband on Draco’s underwear and he looked up, asking for permission.
“Harry, that's called life. Much of it is the space in-between. There’s a lot of learning and growing to be done in those small hours, you know.”
While Draco was off with his mother, Harry went to the closest Muggle town and found himself at the library. He changed into “street clothes”, things he would never wear at Hogwarts. A loose white tee shirt, Sirius’ leather jacket, his mother’s necklace, black jeans that fit him well, and dark brown boots. He looked like he belonged in a rock band.
Draco took pity on him and let his hand slide down Harry’s body, rolling over his abs, and resting by his cock. He used the pad of his thumb to caress the underside of him, making Harry whine and roll his hips into the touch.
Hermione also happened to know a bit about love languages, and she was tempted to break the whole thing down for them, but she didn’t want to ruin the magic of it. She decided to keep quiet about the reality of it and instead, smiled along with Pansy. “He’s a right tosser, but he has his moments. When he really cares about someone, he knows how to show it.”
“I've seen the outfits you've dressed yourself in for nearly a decade, trust me, I know you're colorblind.”
But when he woke, that Harry was gone. What was left was much steadier and stronger. When he looked beside him, he saw a blonde, curled up, still asleep. The sight numbed him and made him small. He existed only in this bed, and nothing outside of it mattered. He could only feel his own contentment as he threw an arm around Draco’s waist and closed his eyes again.
Narcissa smiled as if she couldn't have been prouder. "You really are a politician." She joked. It was easier to smile now that Astoria was awake, and after an overnight observation, should be released in the morning. It gave them a hope about Draco's current state.
Harry spent the summer mourning and healing. He picked up the broken pieces of the life he was given, and he tried to make something out of it.
“You are. You’ve been staying out till two in the morning reading in the library, sleeping five hours, and then you’re on your way back to the library at seven. You read all day and you hardly eat. You aren’t living like this. I’m not gonna let you work yourself to death on a break. There’s a break for a reason. Take a break.”
