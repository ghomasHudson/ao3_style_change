Don't pretend like you didn't skip ahead to this chapter when you read my summary, just to see if my "explicit" rating was accurate. I said what I said, alright?
Someone dropped into the seat next to me, and I didn't even look up. Of course it would be Harry.
Once the bell tolled, we were off to Herbology. Sprout sent us all to the library again, and Harry and I were once again swimming in literature, wrapping up the loose ends of our project. As we sat compiling our notes, Harry's foot made hesitant contact with my ankle and slid up my leg. I cocked an eyebrow at him, finding he was already watching me.
I awoke with a start. Had I forgotten to take my Dreamless Sleep?
I already knew you were, but for you to make that kind of progress with someone like him in
from who you used to be." Finally, he tearfully glanced up at me, and I squeezed his hands tighter. "And now, neither of us has to be alone." My lips shaped a small smile, and a sob broke in Draco's throat.
'Lost in thought?'

So vexed was I with the role of
"Yeah." Was all he said. A grin stretched my lips, but before I could reply, he continued, "W-we should probably get to class."
"He called me Wolf," he whispered to Harry, who followed my lead and sat back down.
Hermione pretended to be hurt as I turned back around to my dresser, this time withdrawing a tie that I fumblingly tied around my neck (as always).
When class finally ended, Draco surprised me yet again as we were packing up our things.
"If you'd be comfortable, sure."
"Jesus Christ, Harry, I knew you were a powerful wizard, but to cast a spell like
"How the hell did I get so lucky?"
"Honestly, when did you become such a gossip?"
"Bloody hell, Harry." He flopped back onto the bed beside me. "You're scary powerful, you know that?"
I shrugged noncommittally.
My pace increased with renewed vigor as I gave myself over to my impulses. Shame and dignity were nowhere to be found as I pounded into him. Thankfully, toward our final moments, he took
back at me. I snickered quietly as he slid the page between two pages of his textbook. Soon after, the bell finally tolled and we began packing our things back into our bags.
"This is all happening so fast…" He barely whispered.
"Too bad you're not on the Wizengamot. I'm sure they'd be very interested to hear the opinions of two teenage wizards."
"It's not just beers they serve, you know. Cocktails and whatnot, food… I dunno… Customer service…"
"Harry?"
Another groan sounded in Draco’s throat as I threw the blankets back and went to one of the trunks I’d predesigned against the wall.
kind of action."
"Okay," I said.
"Just can't picture it, I guess.
nice, you ask me," Seamus muttered under his breath.
Several professors were hastily approaching the scene from the end of the room, but I’d immediately ripped my hand out of Draco’s and sprinted to the scene.
"S-so… Did I… Make up for it?"
Draco cast his eyes downward.
My hands were still acting on their own, and they flew up to seize Harry's throat. He didn't even flinch, though.
He huffed a laugh before tearing his glasses off to rub his eyes.
“No."
A flush stole into my cheeks, but I nodded. His answering grin made my face even hotter.
A grin spread across my face.
I tightened my grip on his tie subconsciously, pressing our bodies together. This physical sensation brought me back to my senses, and I suddenly released him.
He gave me a soft, wondering smile.
Downing the rest of my water, I sniffed and stood again. "Another drink?"
A strange warmth flooded my body. I could hardly concentrate on Sinistra's lecture, let alone the star map I'd pulled out. To be honest, I wasn't even sure I'd turned to the right page. To be even
Once everyone was seated, (as far from Draco as they could be), Slughorn took charge of the class and began rattling off uses and side-effects of this-or-that herb, and Draco realized he'd been scratching at his Dark Mark again. He immediately forced himself to stop, but the damage had already been done. He was bleeding.
Of course, Harry picked up on my mood. I tried to offer him a nonchalant glance as I asked,
…" Was all I could say in the split seconds before I climaxed inside him.

"Yeah," was all he said.
Draco paused tying up his hair as he turned a scowl to the floor.
"I need a shower," I commented as my fingers found a familiar stickiness on my stomach.

"I'm only using what
If this was to be it, I was both mortified and intrigued to see how he'd pull this off. "We… Right?"
The sudden realization that I'd already started investing in our relationship hit me.
For whatever reason, despite Slughorn's words, this was the foremost thought in my mind.
‘It’s not that I really care, I just’ His quill paused as he frowned. His previous message nearly disappeared before he continued again. ‘My love life has always been a major topic of gossip in school, even in the Prophet.’ My eyes scanned his words quickly before they were replaced with the following text: ‘I don’t like everyone knowing my intimate life.’
"Oh, I'm
"Not really. My father uses fear as a motivator, and I wouldn't have wanted him to target her any more because of me. It's his fault we drifted apart."
Something in my expression must've betrayed the panic I felt threatening to creep back up, because he renewed the strength of his grip in my hand.
"Excellent. I was worried I'd asked an impossible thing of you, but if you two can get along, I have hope for the future."
"Well, who was YOUR first time with? Anyone I know?"
With a reassuring smile, I released her and returned to Draco, who had remained frozen where I’d left him, looking on with his own awestruck expression. My cheeks warmed.
"Could ask you the same. You alright?"
His wand was at the ready again as he aimed it first at himself, and then at me. Another shiver ran through me as
Remembering this fact, I hastily arranged my own breakfast from the dishes set out on the Gryffindor table. Slowly, the rest of the group joined us, but Harry and I were done before the rest. We slipped away quietly, leaving Hermione to whisper animatedly to the redhead, and the rest looking half-awake as they consumed their breakfasts. Once outside the Hall, I rounded on Harry.
certainly didn't come across as a '
"I, uh… No clue," I concluded as I wrung my hands together anxiously. Harry approached me to take my hands in his.
"If we're both gonna… Forgo the Dreamless Sleep again, could I… Spend the night? Sleeping!"
"Er… Let's sit over there."
“Consider it your reward for surviving that.”
Heat started pooling in my face, and I silently cursed myself for letting Harry talk me into this. Still, if this was to be my grand apology tour, this was as good a place as any to start. I swallowed my discomfort like a golf ball.
And then something amazing happened.
"Thanks," I commented, taking my glass from him and propping myself up on my elbow. I hastily downed it as he sipped his own, curiously eyeing me.
"Right."
suddenly seemed lost for words. I was accustomed to seeing Hermione blush, but this blush confused me. She glanced up at me.
"W-what are you doing?"
"Among others, yes. It's Mister Malfoy I wish to address."
My legs carried me unnecessarily swiftly to the Great Hall, with Draco in uneasy tow.
Cocking an eyebrow, I responded.
"I'll see what I can do."
I hadn't expected no response from everyone else in our year. To be quite frank, I had expected a load of blow-back. Seamus in my ear, saying
My eyes widened.
"More? Or less?"
Images of Dumbledore falling over the railing flashed behind Draco's eyelids and adrenaline seemed to shoot straight up his spine, sending his heart racing. He was suddenly aware of how crowded the hallways he was in was, and his legs started sprinting on their own.
"Oh, I see. So you've replaced me."
"Wait, what? How…?"
Harry knelt to the floor to retrieve the telescope, looking it over to make sure it hadn't broken when he dropped it.
"M-most of my friends know I came from an… Unloving home, but… I… Might've hidden from them just how… Bad it was…"
“Not a chance.”
After the dust settled on the rubble and fallout of the Battle of Hogwarts, the remaining Death Eaters were rounded up and sent to Azkaban. For Draco Malfoy, this meant losing his father. His mother only narrowly escaped due to her choice to save Harry's life by lying to Voldemort's face about his persistent survival. Draco, being a minor, was not punished – at least, not by the Ministry of Magic. Instead, they decided to send his class of peers back to Hogwarts for a pseudo-"eighth year" to make up for the disruptions the war had caused to their education. While this was a right sight better than Azkaban, Draco couldn't help but see this as a form of punishment, too.
"Thank you for being here."
"Is it already? Feels like we just fell asleep."
did the right thing. Over and over and over and over again."
anywhere up there…"
I could barely concentrate on Flitwick's lecture with Harry stealing glances at me. I didn't give him the satisfaction of looking back, but at one point, the hole through the sheet of paper we'd been writing on clicked for me and I snatched it.
“I… Prob-probably?”
I cast a triumphant glance up at Draco’s awed reaction. He shoved his sleeve up to eye his Dark Mark, frowning at it before lowering his quill back to our note.
Suddenly, my father appeared in the doorway to our compartment. His expression was completely livid, like I'd only seen a handful of times.
"Luna. Hi."
My internal monologue was interrupted by Draco coming to sit beside me. His eyes were soft when I looked up at him, and my rage instantly dissipated. He smiled at me, and my heart swelled. Sinistra must've been uncharacteristically kind to him, and I suddenly wanted to hug the woman. He gestured for our note-passing paper, and I obliged.
"Come on, let's get back to lunch."
Harry's face lit up. He tried to conceal it, but it was too late. Before he had a chance to say anything, I continued.
I snorted as I sat up, but winced when I’d sat on my tender arse cheek.
He smirked down at me, hair still dripping down onto his face, and I swallowed.
"I… Went over to stay up to see the constellation together, and then… We…"
Conceit must've been the one to suggest that
I was still prickly by the time Flitwick started class, but soon settled into the familiar wand patterns and incantations. Hermione, of course, with her knack for, well,
“Is that so?”
‘No, of course not. I just wish people didn’t care.’
"Prick," I muttered against his throat, earning another chuckle from Draco.
“Draco, sweetheart…” His ears pinked at this term, and I took note. “I’ve been through more with them than anything
The glance he shot at me made my heart skip a beat. When he spoke again, I struggled to hear him. "I-I think…" His Adam's apple bobbed in his slender throat as he swallowed. "It might actually work…"
"Fine. Shift over, I'm pulling the blankets up."
"If it's you, it'll work," I promised. Once his cognitive abilities kicked back in, he smiled back at me.
“I… I guess there’s… Really no point…”
I swallowed at this, and Harry sobered.
"It was ultimately the decision of the Ministry, I believe, as a way to keep an eye on them. Do you see him as a threat?"
'She's given me the go-ahead to skip whenever I want.'
Pomfrey tucked the end of my new bandage into itself and left without a word. I supposed her giving me space was just another undeserved kindness, and I felt my eyes start to well up.
"I-I'm sorry about last night." My body froze and my mind went completely blank.
"Not at all. Honestly, I'd be posting flyers by now if I didn't think you'd hex me for it."
I snapped back to my body, where I had arrived in the Great Hall, and Harry had just used my first name for the first time ever.
without seeing me every week…”
Harry's lower lip started quivering, and I took his other hand.
I grinned. I knew what the truth was, but that he willingly opened up to me was a small victory.
"Jesus
"More," came his quiet answer. A grin spread across my lips before I pressed them back onto his.
"No, I didn't. Honestly, don't worry about them. If they hadn't pushed me, we wouldn't have started talking."
Harry seemed to consider this as I finally glanced up at his pensive expression.
gave me to work with." He sipped his own drink, and I was, again, impressed to see his lack of reaction. "How d'you like it?"
I hastened to my dorm, as if running from the inevitability of comprehension. Once the door was safely shut behind me, I slid to the floor against it.
"Ow! Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Can't promise I won't do it again, but…"
"Shut up," I retorted as I shoved my hot face into the empty pillow next to Draco's. With a chuckle, his fingers touched my bare back, stroking up and down the length of my spine. Despite the initial shiver this contact caused, it was very calming. I could almost fall back asleep, but then he leaned over and pressed a kiss to my shoulder.
"Suppose just being with me is enough to ward off any bullies?" I asked as I turned back to Hermione, who shrugged.
not worried what everyone thinks?”
The latter wouldn't make eye contact with me, but he still uttered a greeting.
"Well, not all of the relevant information may be useful for the project. I say we finish listing pages with said information, and then later, during free period, go back through them and cross out ones we can't incorporate, and narrow down the list. Or is that still too much for you, Mr. Minimal Effort?"
I had the sudden urge to take his hand like Luna had taken mine when we first returned to the Astronomy tower.
My saliva dripped down to wet my fingers, and I sought a goal even further down. He seemed to tense as my moistened appendages slid between his cheeks, but his '

"Just seem lost in thought is all. Anything… Troubling you?"
"Honestly, I've never felt more rested. Like I was actually awake when we woke up."
We left the library and headed to the astronomy tower.
The notion set me reeling.
Hermione's words rang in my ears.
"Yeah."
being a barman.
'You're not treating me differently just because I saved the world or whatever, right?'
As I smugly slid this message back onto his desk, I settled my chin back into my palm and glimpsed his red face out of the corner of my eye. Instead of writing back, he muttered

"That's true. School can be a nuisance. I think I'll get a muggle job for a while. No one will recognize me in the muggle world."
Pausing at his entrance, I observed his squinted eyes, his braced expression.
He glanced at me with a raised eyebrow.
Oh, you thought that was all?
So lost was I in my post-coital bliss that I'd completely forgotten to check. Draco pressed a kiss to my cheek before rolling out of bed. I couldn't resist following him with my eyes as I rolled onto one side.
‘I can’t exactly control what I do accidentally though, can I?’
The muscles in Draco's face fell completely slack. I gnawed my lip anxiously as I awaited his response, but his reaction told me enough, if I was honest. His mouth clicked closed, but he just stared at me silently. I braced myself for his walls to come up, for his defense mechanism to kick in, for the rage I'd expected from the beginning, but he was just… Quiet. When he finally spoke, it was barely a whisper.
“You little-”
'Maybe tell her that?'

My hips started moving of their own accord as I took him into him, again and again. Draco's hands came to grip my hips as he thrusted into me, and I was rewarded with that expression on his face again. I could hardly focus on it, though, so overwhelming was the sensation. My eyes rolled back in my head.
It was Rodolfo, of all people. I froze. Harry cast a curious glance back at him, gesturing for him to enter.
I hadn't considered this.
"Ow!" Harry laughed, and the sound seemed to slightly loosen a tightly wound coil of anxiety in me, but it wound itself right back up as I realized,
A few assenting hums sounded around the table as we started eating.
Once atop the tower, the whispers around us finally registered. Everywhere I looked, glances were cast at our clasped hands full of bewilderment, anger, even disgust. I felt my cheeks warm, but Harry just held on tighter. He tugged me toward the railing on the edge of class, leaning casually against the banister. I tried to mimic his nonchalance, but felt increasingly uneasy under the scrutiny of the entire class. However, Harry distracted me by leaning in to whisper in my ear,
"Hm," I agreed as my exhaustion finally overcame me.
I grinned.
The words died on my tongue as I realized
My kiss must've shocked his language functions to a halt, because instead of replying, he took my face in his hands and rejoined our lips.
He glanced up at me guiltily. The muscles in my face softened.
Once showered, shaved, and clothed, I left my dorm with my book bag slung across my body. It was quite a bit later than I'd
His words shocked me, but I realized he was right.
‘You’ve really thought this through I see’ Harry’s darkening cheeks spread pleasure throughout my nervous system. Before sending the note back to him, though, I continued. ‘And you call ME insatiable’
“D-Draco, we really
Within minutes of Slughorn's lecture for the day, though, a Horcrux note slid onto my desk.
"A-actually, I left something in the Hall."
A glorious cry broke on Draco's lips as his hands found mine. With one, he laced our fingers together, and with the other, he led me between us, as if to say '
"It's
I stared at the now-blank page, fighting off a grin but defeated by my blush. Slowly, I took the parchment and wrote a simple message before casually placing it on his desk.
"Wanna stay up together tonight?"
'What's got your wand in a knot?'
I wanted to say.
"Oh… Hi…"
"And you mine."
‘Like us, Ron and Hermione were the only ones who took this seriously’
"About that time," he groaned as he sat up, and I rolled to one side, disentangling our legs.
The hush that fell over the library was glaringly obvious, but neither of us indulged the stares.
Harry cast a suspicious glance around the faces in the hallway. I couldn't help but chuckle.
The concern in his face
'Oh. She used to be, though, right?'
My knee came up against the edge of the bed to follow him, and my hands supported me on either side of his head as he lay back on the bed. Somewhere under the mental monopoly of his mouth moving against mine, I was dimly aware of his legs uncrossing. This allowed more room for my other knee to join the first, but it was then, with his hands fisting in my hair, that I realized what a compromising position we'd assumed. I pulled back suddenly, my face incredibly hot. He released my head with a grin, instead replacing his hands on my ribs and slowly sliding down.
"Before you ask, and I know you're going to, dying… Hurts. A lot. It's like… Being forcibly ejected from your body. And there's a brief sensation of absolutely nothing before you end up wherever you end up. That's the most terrifying part of it. For a few seconds, I just… Wasn't."
"S-sorry, I-"
slowly push into him, and was rewarded with the same pleading expression I’d been looking for.
It was a while before Draco stole the sheet back to respond.
"Couldn't say. Might be too much work to get good at, maybe something easier…"
“I rarely… Have good ideas, but…” He chuckled breathlessly.
I'd never fancied a bloke before, so I really had no idea what I was doing, to be honest. If it hadn't been for that moment in the library, I probably still would've only thought of him as a friend. It was maddening, trying to gauge how much or how little I could touch him, how much or little I could say to him or ask him, how much or little time I could spend with him within reason.
"You alright? You look dreadful."
why I’m doing this! Hell, this might just be the
My attention was torn between Harry and Slughorn for several minutes. His must've been torn, too, because eventually a sheet of parchment was slapped onto my desk.
"Oh. You can't?" He shook his head. "Ah… Well… Probably? I mean, wouldn't you rather ask a professor?"
Somehow, I was still able to move slowly back into him as the sight of my own contorted face formed behind my eyelids.
"So…" I cleared my throat. "What're your weekend plans?"
"What time is it?"
"Was lost in thought? Seems to happen pretty often."
Once we were both confident that our project was ready for presentation, we packed up our things and left the library. We were still much earlier than the rest of the class, and we decided to descend to the courtyard to relax before Charms.
With a scoff, I joined him, snatching the other towel off the rack and drying myself off.
The tension in my chest seemed to relax suddenly. I would be the last one to hold myself up next to
"Guess not." I conceded as my head dropped back onto the bed. "Shit, what time is it?"
No sooner had these words left my lips than several Dementors flooded the hallway, dragging my screaming father back to hell. I actually
Draco was ripped out of his reverie by the familiar voice of Madam Pomfery. His reason for visiting the infirmary clumsily formed on his lips.
Harry gaped at my words for a moment, and I had to stifle a laugh. When he finally ripped the page back onto his own desk, it was with aggression.
think, even for a moment, that he'd
I couldn't think, so heady was the sensation. Draco's lips against mine, his skin on my skin, his… Crotch against mine. I was still self-aware enough to feel embarrassed, though. My reactions, as Draco had pointed out, were far too transparent.
"She asked you to do
each other…"
Draco's breath was coming more quickly now, and every exhale was a different kind of moan. His hand found mine on his thigh and gripped it tightly, and I, in turn, gripped his thigh.
was playing at his features. Suddenly, I stood and took his glass from his hands. His curious expression followed my hands to the floor, where I set our empty drinks before I braced my hands on either side of him against his chair, pressing my lips to his silently.
My gaze shifted from the passing English countryside to Harry's face. Nostalgia shone in his eyes.
“Honestly, they might. But you’re not forcing my hand or anything, I’m hanging out with you so much because I
“Oh, relax. Eat your breakfast, Potions starts soon.”
‘We should sneak out tonight’
'Both?'
“Maybe you don’t need practice after all. If all it takes is me making you a bit nervous…” He leaned in to pass his tongue across my upper lip, and one of his lightbulbs burst. “Honestly, I’m surprised the entire castle didn’t come crashing down the first time we fucked.”
"Errr, let's see… Um… Oh! I think I found it. Holy hell."
I attempted the transfiguration twice more before I was somewhat successful. Where his quill had transformed into a beautiful fern branch, mine became a shriveled sort of twig. I frowned at it as he snickered. My eyes rolled, but a grin threatened to disassemble my disappointment. Withdrawing a fresh quill, I finally responded to his last message.
"Harry…" I took his hand, drawing his uncomfortable gaze back up to mine. "You are
I gave him a quizzical look before he lowered his quill back to the parchment.
Draco suddenly looked like he might cry, and I leaned away to kneel before him, bringing his hands into mine. He swallowed and blushed down at his lap as I gripped his appendages, waiting for a reply.
"Oh… My god, Harry! I am… Just astounded. Who knew?"
"Right."
"Here, I bet this would make it easier," I said as I stood and extinguished his light. Joining him at the window, he pulled me against him and wrapped his arms around my waist.
When he didn't respond, it clicked.
Her arms wrapped back around me, and I heard her smile in her voice.
I withdrew his Slytherin robes and tossed them back onto the bed as he sat up, yawning.
“Mm,” was the only answer I got as we finished redressing ourselves and made our way to the Great Hall.
I cast a sideways glance at him with my next measured breath, and saw a small, reassuring smile in his eyes. The absurdity and irony of our current situation suddenly struck me. This was our first time back here together since…
We did end up being late to breakfast, but it was worth the entertainment of watching Harry frantically dress himself, cast his bodily cloaking spell, and try to work off his erection, all the while casting me scathing looks. By ten minutes in to breakfast, we were strolling into the Great Hall, hand-in-hand.
“Your, erm… Ties are switched.”
Draco blushed down at his hands before quietly responding.
"I'll be right back."
" I spat at him defiantly. "No one gives a
"I-I think I saw him go to the infirmary. Maybe he's sick?" Someone volunteered.
I made the “I don’t know” sound before realizing I
A sigh escaped my lips as I grit my teeth on the truth.
"You haven't?"
Draco and I compiled a list of books about antidotes from the back of our textbook and then set about tracking them all down from the library's shelves. It was times like these when the picture seemed incomplete without a bookworm like Hermione, but I wasn't displeased with the company.
“Nah, practice starts next week. I’m visiting Hagrid tomorrow, though.”
"You alright?" She asked once she had caught up to me. I sighed.
He shrugged.
My eyes slid shut on their own as a multitude of overlapping sensations crossed my mind.
"This is the best dream I've ever had," I realized as he tucked his head onto my chest.
"We really need to get to breakfast, though. Don't want to run into too many people on your walk of shame, do you?"
Hermione's coaching in my ear was the only thing that could break my panic. Apparently, she hadn't noticed anything and was (very formally) giving me directions.

"Just wanted to meet your new
'Stop flirting with me and pay attention.'
"How are things are going with Mr. Malfoy?"
but this clarification seemed to ease my anxiety somewhat.
Slughorn was calling me to the front of the classroom to speak to me. With a glance toward Harry's retreating (engaged) figure, I reluctantly met Slughorn at his podium.
In that moment, I realized truly just how alike we were. It sent me reeling a bit, but what my body decided to do was pull him into an embrace, my cheek pushing against his chest. His heart beat more loudly under my ear as I tightened my arms around him. Almost cautiously, his arms wrapped around me, as well, holding me to him.
He sat on the edge of the bed, raising an eyebrow at me. I hadn't convinced him, but he seemed to sense my panic, and thankfully decided to drop it.
"You should send her an owl. You said you thought she was lonely."
'Sure' was all he wrote back.
Of course, no one said anything. Everyone looked, to be sure of who was so late, but immediately turned back to the lesson. Not even a mention from Slughorn. With gritted teeth, I slid into the seat Hermione had saved for me.
"Did somebody say monster?"
"Ugh, he just said he thinks I'm brave and strong of character… Some other stuff… He's grateful to me, or whatever…"
and you
“What?”
I gripped Draco's sleeve and started toward the Gryffindor table. He stumbled before compliantly following and sitting with me. We ate side-by-side in silence for a few minutes.
My mind couldn't complete that thought. Wouldn't complete the thought. Couldn't comprehend that our feelings were mutual. I dropped my head onto the desk.
With an affirming pat on both my shoulders, Slughorn spun me around and sent me to my next class.
" He reiterated deliberately before dissolving into more incredulous laughter. "Brilliant!"
“And you
"The very same," Harry gave a half-hearted chuckle as the two shook hands. Rodolfo gave a disbelieving laugh.
I found I was intensely curious to see how Draco would react. Would he give me up at the first sign of trouble? Would he fight for himself? Class was over before I could reach a conclusion, and I was still deep in thought as we silently walked to the Great Hall together.
, and about to start our adult lives." Harry sniffed. "We could use- no, we
This thought, unbidden in my mind, warmed my cheeks a bit more. Memories of the previous night flashed behind my eyes. The sound of Harry's first moan rang in my ears, and my vision blurred. Clearing my throat, I endeavored to focus back on the task at hand, but he'd already picked up on my mood.
"Focus, Draco," he cautioned. I cast him a scathing glare, but my usual venom was nowhere to be found.
" The guilt in his expression didn't vanish as I'd hoped it would've, so I continued. "Fuck it, it's even okay if you actually do still have feelings for him.
"Really?"
I jumped slightly with surprise at the voice I
push me away, I subtly nestled my hips against his a bit more firmly. His knee lifted as a reaction, pushing me forward slightly. The friction this caused between our blossoming erections drew another gasp from his lips, and his eyes fully closed.
Why that mattered so much to me, I couldn't understand. Still, the last few steps to their table were agonizing.
"Look, I don't control my dreams, I just experience them."
‘Not as much as you put into me’ was his surprising response, though, and I quirked an eyebrow at him. His suggestive expression nearly made me burst into laughter in the middle of class, but I choked it down.
if that traitor dared show his face in a place like this?" I heard someone else whisper.
"Personally, I thought it suited you. You shouldn't hide it."
The somewhat-rational part of my brain that pointed this out also conjured images of him sharing himself with others like this, and I furiously shoved it away.
"Probably just because you finally got some dick," Harry retorted with a grin. I rolled my eyes. "How long had it been?"
"But you already are. Living your life normally won't undo what you've done for us all, so why not cut yourself a break?"
care that they all knew, it was the supposed importance I knew it’d have to them that bothered me. They’d all be offering me different looks, as if to say
moan tore from his lips, and I increased my pace. Every gasp was now followed by his beautiful voice, and his leg contracted far enough that he rested his foot on my shoulder. He was nearing his climax, and I craved it with him.
"Tell you in our dream?"
McGonagall's usually stern expression seemed to tighten as she considered her response.
"I… Just… Said he was brave, too… And surprising… And funny…"
"No…" I glanced behind me to see a truly horrified Draco, pressed against the tree.
As usual, I got up last to follow my class of peers out the door. Harry was caught up in a conversation with that Granger girl, and I cursed the envy this drew out of me.
He was still at the base of the same tree next to the lake, but as I approached him, I stopped.
Fighting off a grin was increasingly difficult as Harry's hand casually brushed against mine as we walked. A sideways glance at him told me he was having just as hard a time keeping his face neutral.
This was the repetitive mantra in my head for a good ten minutes. I'd seen it, after all. He'd been lost in thought about
"Come on, it's alright," Harry coaxed. With a scowl, I reluctantly followed to where his friends sat.
Harry blushed at the floor as I crossed my arms.

Not one, but
"I don't think anyone can reasonably hope he would change. I think it's more for the sake of the
His sigh interrupted my poor excuse for an explanation.
"I don't. Harry thinks he's being funny."
"Why show me this?"
As if it mattered!
on his face again. Serene, slightly pink, gentle smile, and I realized (again) that Hermione was right. It wasn't just McGonagall and I looking out for him, it was the entire staff. The contrast of their treatment of him with our peers' suddenly set off my frustration again. Draco plucked the paper back from my desk.
"Well, this is… Disturbing. Harry, Rodolfo, Rodolfo, Harry."
As I propped myself up on my elbows, I was suddenly distracted with how good he looked between my legs. My face must've betrayed my appreciation, because Harry frowned at me.
"You have no one to blame but yourself," I promised as I yawned. Draco stretched his limbs with a groan, but only thoughts of his face from our dream-sex dominated my thoughts.
"Th-thanks."
"Bollocks," Ron scoffed.
"Harry?"
"Wanna shower together?"
His agitation was endearing, but at the same time, worry clutched my heart.
Eagerly obliging, I tried to mimic his pacing and kept the rhythm synced between my hand and my hips.
Another hesitant laugh choked out of my throat.
He reached out to take me by the collar, but another hand reached out and seized his wrist. I twisted suddenly to see Harry, having seemingly appeared out of thin air, with a disappointed sneer on his face.
“Er… Have you met me? When have I ever willingly participated in social activities?”
effort, Harry tore my hands from his throat and stood.
"I'm guessing you're going for Auror?"
‘Don’t give me too much credit here. We still don’t know if it’s actually possible’
My goading disappeared as I recognized the authenticity in his expression.
I took a deep breath in through my nose and released it quietly as I felt Harry's thumb stroking the side of my thumb. With a set jaw, I forced myself to focus on the lecture. This time, when Sinistra called for us to take out our books, I was the one to hold mine open for both of us.
know what it is."
in me.
But beyond this simple interaction, Draco's posture spoke volumes. He wasn't curled in on himself, or hunched to make himself smaller, he was sitting forward with his elbows on the table, talking calmly with the fascinated Scot.
The first class of the year seemed to stretch painfully long, but once the bell tolled, Draco's relief was swiftly replaced with dread. He had sat the furthest from the door, but that meant he'd have to wait for everyone else to leave… Which, in turn, meant he'd be the last to their next class. He cursed his planning internally.
"I don't have time to educate the ignorant." I pushed past them, resolutely (maybe a tad arrogantly) as I continued, "If you have a problem with me going out with Draco, just ignore us like you're clearly ignoring everything
"Sprout is sending us to the library to work on our projects."
"You know, if you ever break my heart, it'll hurt that much worse now that you're
I rolled my eyes as I went to my wardrobe to pick out my robes for the day. Turning my back to her, I resigned myself with another sigh.
This thought only fanned my fury as I dropped into my seat.
My spine suddenly straightened as I stared at our Headmistress in awe.
"I love it when you talk academic," I teased with a grin. Draco smirked, but a faint pink touched the tips of his ears. "By the way, I've never asked, what are your plans for after graduation?"
I cast a curious glance over at Harry before writing back.
I stared at the words for a few moments, remembering our first interaction. Before I could think to reply, he snatched the page back and scrawled something else. When he finally slid it back onto my desk, it was much slower than before.
"Definitely not."
"Could be. But
"You must really love your parents," he said with a grimace.
apologize." I calmly informed them as I took a bite of chicken. A certain smug satisfaction glowed in my chest at the shock now evident on everyone's faces. I wanted them all to feel the shock I had felt, and…
When he turned with my glass of water in hand and caught me staring, my still-flushed cheeks warmed further. With a grin, he stepped back up to the side of the bed and handed me my glass.
My teeth caught my lower lip unintentionally as I took in the sight of him.
I scowled and set off at a slightly faster pace than we had been walking. Harry simply jogged to keep up.
"Harry." I stood, and he half-turned to look at me. My face arranged itself in such a hateful glare at my father, I could almost feel the distaste dripping from my expression. "He's not worth it. He only wants to control me because he can't control his own life. Look where your choices got you, you
This earned a subdued laugh from Harry.
"Someone… Asked you to be nice to me?"
My gut twisted as I realized now he wants to broadcast that

holding mine.
"Look, if things turn nasty, just imagine me naked, alright? I'm sure your subconscious will make quick work stripping me, and
"I-I need, um… Gauze. I… Have a few scrapes."
Hermione took one glance at me as I practically came bounding back, and my jubilance was suddenly sobered as she gave me a smug grin.
He was giving me that stupid grin again, and I felt my face get even hotter.
"Sure," he said as he withdrew his wand from his night stand and refilled both our cups. After handing me mine, he stood and went to his window, leaning against the wall and gazing out. After a few gulps, I swung my legs around the side of the bed and set my glass back down.
"Harry…" I said quietly, panic surging in my chest. My arm suddenly started burning where my Dark Mark was, and I cried out in pain.
"G'night?"
Each step felt like I was wading through quicksand, but as humiliating as it was having Harry follow my progress, I felt a small sense of security having him there. I knew he'd let me run if it came down to it, so there wasn't any pressure from him.
"Haven't seen them together since school started, though."
Our resulting moans seemed to harmonize. I couldn't begin to describe what he felt like inside me, but it was
With a chuckle at his eagerness, I handed the telescope back to him.
vulnerable as his hands spread my legs. He wedged himself between my knees, and before I could mentally prepare even a fraction, I felt his tongue trace up the length of my cock.
A million and one thoughts flew through my mind before I had a moment to process a single one. We were at the back of the class, and our overlapping robes obscured our gripped appendages, but even when there was no chance of anyone seeing, he still clung to me.
"Jesus… I… Don't know… How you manage… To keep… Raising the bar," I huffed. Draco's answering laugh was equally as ragged. My head lolled back as I fought to catch my breath. Sounds of clattering couldn't even incite me to raise my head as I assumed he was cleaning us up again.
Harry suddenly sobered.
me Seeker.”
"Yeah, well,
My right arm snaked under Harry's torso and hoisted him up further on the bed, once again briefly disconnecting our mouths. Once he'd realized what I was trying to do, he assisted, pulling himself fully onto the bed. I heard his shoes hit the floor, and I hastily shed my own as I climbed on top of him. He'd propped himself up on his elbows, and I took a moment to sit back on his lap and appraise him.
My experience with his fingers had taught me
‘It’s no saving the world’ was what I’d decided on. After I’d slid the note back onto his desk, he wrote only my name before shooting me a frown.
"Do you… Already have a partner?"
"Thirsty?" I didn't miss the double-meaning behind his words, but merely rolled my eyes in response. My mouth was parched, and I guzzled down the rest of my water greedily. As he sat beside me with a leg pulled up to face the headboard, he followed suit with his own glass on his night stand.
sliced through his heart.
moan sounded in his mouth as his fingers fisted in my hair.
"Harry!" He whined. I could only summon a snicker.
I took the glass, full of pinkish fluid, from his hands and hesitantly sipped from it. The flavor of alcohol still twisted my lips, but I found it much more palatable than the previous drink. He laughed at me.
For the second time, Harry laughed when I tried insulting him. Not a biting laugh, either. He thought I was funny? My face warmed.
"You really… Don't have to do that…"
"Point taken."
"Let them." I shoveled another spoonful of cereal into my mouth stubbornly. "I'm the reason they're breathing. Couldn't give a shit about their opinions of me, honestly."
“I’m sorry,” I repeated as I pressed a kiss to the brow in question.
‘Of course’ came my immediate reply. Still, a certain caution invited my next response: ‘What did you have in mind?’
With Hermione's insistence, I copied all the notes down from the entire class, but my attention was torn between the lecture and that damn blond in my eyesight.
"I think so, too," I decided to say. He cast another glance up at me, and I couldn't help but smile. "I hope so."
"Thanks, Luna."
My head snapped up, first to glare at his half-turned smirk, but then to McGonagall, because he wasn't actually wrong. I'd been zoning out in class far too often lately.
"Should I Legillimens you again or are you gonna say what you're thinking?"
"Morning." Ron's greeting was awkwardly short.
After what seemed like an eternity, we arrived at the top just as Sinistra was doing her head count. A few students cast dubious, even loathsome glances back at me, but when they saw Harry by my side, they quickly turned back around.
"Er… Sorry. It's nothing. L-let's get to dinner."
Harry beamed at me, but suddenly, behind him, one Dementor had taken an interest in us. Seeing the fear on my face, he whipped back around and drew his wand.
‘What would be an antidote for terror?’
turn to anxiously await my response. "I… Think we might be… Really similar… Actually…"
Both our mouths were very dry, so when our kiss ended, I reached behind me to grab our glasses again.
"Is this… Okay?" I asked between strokes. Harry nodded, his eyes still tightly shut.

'Not necessarily. I wish she'd worry about herself, though. I worry she's avoiding her own well-being with mine.'
I couldn't wrap my head around it. How could HE, the Savior of the Wizarding World, see similarities with himself and a

“Don’t apologize. Let’s go to class.”
The kindness they were showing me still shocked me.
would be helping him gather his books, quills and parchment and time seemed to stop.
‘You’re right. What would you say Death Eaters DID feed off of?’
"A bloody powerful wizard, but yes. You're just a kid. So am I. But here we are, having survived a
"You know, when I was young, I heard rumors about you. You were my hero, but the first time my father found a newspaper clipping about you in my desk, he beat me black and blue. Told me you were the reason the Wizarding world had been set back twenty years. I really hate that man, you know."
"Nine forty."
Once Harry released me, I chugged a good few mouthfuls of water to try to drown the lump in my throat. It somewhat worked, at least enough that I found my voice again.
My eyes narrowed at her as I briefly considered the possibility that she and McGonagall were in cahoots…
I wanted to laugh at her outrageous request, but the sincerity in her eyes stopped it in my throat. A whirlwind of emotions flooded through me, and I was silent for a long while. Finally, after what must've been 50 seconds, I sighed.
"Don't fret too much. You've given me some top-shelf liquor, and I appreciate it, even though you might not."
"What? It's… Practical."
"Here we go…" I commented grimly.
"You…?"
Again, she mimed zipping her lips, locking them, and throwing away the key, all the while grinning smugly. With a groan, I pushed past her and collected my book bag, when I suddenly realized I'd left my wand in Draco's dorm. I froze.
He nodded, and there was
"The fuck?" Draco sat up and looked around.
Anyone willing to hire an ex-Death Eater would either be engaged in something shady, or a bare-minimum level job. He shuddered as he considered the possibility of having to get a muggle job. Neither option appealed. A third option festered just beyond the reach of his perception, but he ignored it.
"I dunno, Harry. Not that I don't trust your judgement, but… I think we're gonna have to see the differences for ourselves, know what I mean?" Seamus scowled over my shoulder when I turned back around, and I sighed.
I froze in shock.
A tear slipped from one eye, but I was still frozen in shock.
I turned and fled back to the Great Hall. My thoughts were a broken record of,
his dreams? Unintentionally at first, but last night it was intentional, and…"
"Whoa, whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves. All I know right now is what we think of each other."
"Of you? Never." I took another valiant gulp of my drink, but stopped short of finishing it. My throat threatened a gag, but I breathed evenly to keep pace with it.
"Apart from being exceptionally boring, this scenario you've brought us into isn't that bad."
"What, don't you think I could do it?"
Seeing him positioned between my legs was both thrilling and nerve-wracking, but I'd already braced myself.
Harry's stifled chuckle reached my ears, and I felt a strange tightening in my chest. Is this what being friends with the Chosen One was like?
“It’s fine, Harry, really. If it’s something you enjoy, I want you to do it.”
"Yeah, g'night."
Harry held a hand to his forehead and sat back on his heels.
As the mocking voices around him died to a hush, he lifted his confused gaze to see
Our dream found us sitting across from each other on the Hogwarts Express. Seeing Harry there, I immediately remembered this was a dream.
times? Don't sell me short, now, Drag."
"I hope that's… Okay with you all?"
The class gave a half-hearted applause as the first pair finished, and returned to their seats. Next up was two girls who’d researched some flower or other that could be used in love potions, and my desire to kill myself grew.

my problem!" I was surprised to hear aggravation in Harry's voice. "It's just… McGonagall said this thing that I can't get out of my head, and against all odds you actually DO have a heart, and I can't just go back to blindly hating you. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?"
Our moment of bliss was cut short, however, when Harry suddenly propped himself up on his hands.
, but…"

"Night, Harry."
"North north-east, I think?" I said as I stood to join him. He peered through the lens and aimed it as instructed, searching the night sky.
Deathly Hallows?
"Holding hands? Being all friendly and such? Have you forgotten what he did to this school!?"
He cast me a sideways scowl but studiously tried to focus on the material before him. I withdrew my attention, suddenly feeling awful for prying. And what's worse is he didn't even know I'd heard what I'd heard.
an excellent listener, and sometimes gave very profound advice. I sighed.
"Bollocks," Ron doubted.
His thumb stroking my cheek seemed to bring some control back to my body, just enough that I could speak for myself.
If it were anyone else, I wouldn't have pulled her into a hug just then.
"For some reason, that sounded like an insult, but I'll let it go this time."
He used to sit happily atop the Slytherin social ladder, but since the war's conclusion unfolded as it did, he expected his house to be the victim of merciless bullying this year, especially for his peers. He was a traitor to his school and to the Cause, saddling him squarely between the resentment of both sides. Due to his father's involvement, he was unfortunately somewhat at the pinnacle of this tension, as well. That his family so readily followed the Dark Lord's leadership earned him the hatred of all those who fought against him, and that his family ultimately failed the Dark Lord earned him the hatred of those who would've seen him succeed. Yes, he was very aware of his position.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Your wish," he released me, smacked my ass (earning a surprised yelp from me), and withdrew his telescope from his desk drawer. "My command," he said as he handed it to me.
‘You and her? Skeeter must’ve been desperate.’
Harry's eyes were suddenly far away, and he spoke very calmly.
"Guess that's all it took."
"What's wrong?"
suddenly registered on my erection. The same thing happened to my fingers, and I experimentally touched them together to realize two of them were slick.
I smirked up at him, and he laughed.
"I can't believe anyone would say anything to you, honestly."
was my silver lining. I ducked my head.
His eyes quickly skimmed what I'd written, and a frown creased his brow. He snatched the paper from my desk before my words could fully disappear.
"Guess we both forgot our Dreamless Sleep, then."
“I’ll tell
When Harry didn't respond, I clicked my tongue and grabbed his hand. He didn't resist as I started walking toward the Herbology classroom.
"Ow!" I exclaimed, even though it didn't hurt. We both laughed.
I cast a sideways glance at the blond. She
"You mean Malfoy."
A flush stole into my cheeks as I entertained the unlikelihood that he felt the same way about me as I did about him.
"Thanks." I immediately went to the desk against the door's wall and unloaded my arms and bag. His room was tidier than mine, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was always like this or if he'd hastily shoved things into cabinets in preparation for my arrival (like I would've).
The look I gave him must've been desperate, because when he glanced at me and Hermione, another sigh broke on his greasy lips.
Being around Draco was like a kind of reward in and of itself. I loved my friends, but he was like a breath of fresh air. He certainly kept things interesting. I'd never been so consistently surprised by one person before, and I'd come to crave it. Thoughts like
I was rewarded with a gentle chuckle in my ear. Our telescopes were spelled to further the distance of vision, and a planet came into view. I was about to mention it to Draco when he pulled my earlobe into his mouth.
"Me too."
carefully, I slid myself down onto him.
He raised an eyebrow at me.
!" My kiss swallowed Draco's response as steam started to rise in the room.
After finally accomplishing what we'd originally set out to do, we were both exhausted, so sleep was the natural next step. Harry's limbs and bare skin on mine were a comfort, and we were both quickly asleep in my bed. A touch of anxiety gnawed at the back of my mind as we both skipped our Dreamless Sleep again, but the events of the night were too draining to stay awake fretting about it.
'Think we could cause enough of a disturbance that Flitwick'd have the balls to tell Harry Potter to move seats?'
"You sure you want to know? Here, in your head?"
"What… Do you usually dream about?"
His legs sliding back off the bed answered my question as his lips reached my navel. I wanted to look at him, but couldn't force myself to. All I could do was keep gasping in air as his fingers found my waistband. He started tugging, and I suddenly forgot how to breathe. Here, however, he paused.
It was my turn to scowl now as I turned my face back down to my book.
kill you."
Sitting in the grass, a question came to mind, and in my unconscious state, it seemed to voice
When I finally stopped, I didn't turn to look at Draco right away so he stepped around me to read my expression.
Thoughts like
"Sure, what can I do for you, Headmistress?"
"Come on. We'll be late for next period." He extended a hand to me, but I just stared at it warily. Harry clicked his tongue before leaning down to hoist me to my feet by my bicep. "Just… Come on."
role rather seriously?"
"I thought it was mental, too. But it turns out, people care about you. And I guess now it's MY job to fix everyone's damn problems."
“So… Everybody ready for the Herbology presentation?”
"I-I guess…"
had enough for one night," I insinuated, wondering if he was serious about
"The fuck do you think?" He barely whispered back without looking up at me.
Draco pulled his other leg up to sit cross-legged, leaning his elbows on his knees as his ears pinked.
His shoulders shuddered in my embrace, and I squeezed him tighter.
Predictably, my heart raced, but suddenly a thought surfaced that I immediately had to share with him. I pulled away, still leaning over him as his eyes refocused on mine.
My anxiety eased somewhat as I chuckled at this.
"Sorry… It's just… I actually
“Stop l-looking at me,” he complained as another groan tore from his lips. I grinned.
Instead of causing a fuss or making a mess, he grimly touched his magic quill to his arm, soaking up the blood to write with. He was only taking notes, so no one would see it but him. Still, he made a mental note to go to the infirmary later and try to find some gauze.
Draco started to laugh with me, when a dark shadow appeared before us and who should emerge from it but Voldemort himself, a vindictive sneer on his pale face.
"What's that?"
"Yeah, well, I was in the closet I guess."
"Er… So…" Harry started, but I'd already seen his
He seemed to be wrestling with himself.
"Thanks f-for letting me sit with you. I'm s… Sorry about… Y'know… Er…"
"No, it was… Er…" I perked up, his hesitance piquing my interest. "One of my father's friend's… Sons…"
I didn't immediately answer him, instead deciding to start walking to the Great Hall. As expected, he was quickly on my heels.
Twisting back toward the fireplace, I saw we had about five minutes to get to breakfast.
of it all, I couldn't even picture myself letting him in, telling him about myself. What exactly would he even want to know? I didn't think I was that interesting of a person, honestly. And my past was a topic I'd really rather avoid…
I cast another compulsive glance at his stationary name marker on the map. Every instinct was telling me to go knock on his door.
As soon as I was released, I all but ran out of the room, only to find Draco leaned against the wall outside, waiting for me.
"Gonna have to have the talk with the lads at some point, though," Ron continued through a mouthful of food. I grimaced.
I've done to bring about peace."
Draco's steps faltered, but he pressed on until we were walking into Charms together. He awkwardly tried to maneuver to a secluded desk, but I followed to sit next to him, ignoring the curious stares I got for it. He was purposefully not looking at me, and the ungodly pink in his cheeks made me want to press him, but I left him alone.
Draco couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't even breathe as he watched the brunette hold out a handful of his things to him. When he didn't immediately take them, Potter's lips twitched.
be able to cum again were instantly assuaged.
His answering flush earned a grin from me as the rest of our year started filtering into the classroom. Harry withdrew his textbook and notes from his bag, and I followed suit.
"No," Ron and I immediately answered in unison.
To be fair, I
"Tick tock, Draco. I won't be so gracious to allow you your life for long."
"I… I'm gonna be early." Draco stood and nearly ran from the table. As I watched him, perplexed, I saw him dodge Ron and Hermione, who were arriving hand-in-hand. Ron was giving me (or rather, trying
"Wanna be early?"
"Be better if you'd get your hand off me." He shrugged away the hand I hadn't even realized was still there. I awkwardly withdrew it and sat beside him on the grass. "Something I can do for you?"
“Your friends already know, why hide it?” As he pulled his shirt back over his head, he continued. “In fact, why even hide your neck at this point?”

"Everything alright?"
"Correct, Mister Malfoy. Now, can anybody tell me
I turned back to my cereal as they sat on either side of me. I braced myself.

sight I'd ever seen, but I was sure if I broke into hysterics now, they'd all think I'd played an elaborate prank on them, so I simply stared at the table in silence, waiting for someone else to say something,
"If you'd be interested to try, that is." I steadied myself and turned to face him.
Harry wheezed a laugh in return.
Harry made me feel… Safe. An emotion I was wholly unfamiliar with, but… If I had to pinpoint the moment I'd stopped seeing him as a threat, it was… When he came to talk to me by the lake. He'd sought me out, and seeing him calmly just sit beside me, tearing grass from the ground and complaining. He'd opened up to me, relaxed around me, and didn't treat me like a monster or a freak or a villain. The simplest of interactions had changed everything for me.
"Mr. Potter, might I have a quick word?" My eyes snapped up to McGonagall as the rest of the class was filtering out of the room.
so. She asked some pretty invasive questions this morning.' My eyebrows raised at this before this note disappeared, and Harry continued writing. 'As for why she is? I think' Here, Harry paused long enough for his writing to vanish. 'She feels responsible for my happiness. She's overly mothering, and I know she'd do anything for me.'
“Ah, well, you see…” Harry started to explain, but I interrupted him with a snort.
Harry’s
The night Dumbledore died was fresher still in my memory, here atop the tower where it happened. I remembered the terror in Malfoy's eyes, the way his hands and voice trembled. The class moved to the railing to look where Sinistra was pointing at the sky, but I was frozen still.
Harry didn't write back for a long while, and I found myself intensely curious where this line of conversation was leading. When he finally did take the page back, his response was not what I expected.
He didn't try to pry his hand from mine, either. I was suddenly aware of how clammy my palms were, and wanted to pull away to wipe them off on my robes, but… I didn't. Harry's hand was my lifeline in that moment, and I was sure if I let go, I'd fall to my death.
"There's just so much pressure to be 'The Savior' at all times, it, it's… It's a lot."
Draco's exhalations became gradually more vocal, and I was again lost in fascination as I drew moan after moan from his lips.
I wanted to say. My teeth shut with a click as I resisted this thought. When Draco saw I wouldn't finish that sentence, he rolled his eyes and left the shower to begin drying himself off.
To my surprise,
She held up a hand to stop me.
'I'd simply tell her I did my best but that you didn't want me around. So you do still hate me?'
'How can you be so different, but somehow exactly the same?'
He laughed.
"You know full well you're not just a Gryffindor. Don't let it go to your head, but… You've earned the right to a
I sighed,
"Yeah…" Was all I could think of to say in response.
I noticed his left hand flex and fist subtly as anxiety crept into his features.
"I-I mean, if you'd rather not talk about her, we-"
"I think expecting the best is just as silly as expecting the worst. All we can do is wait and see, and be ready for anything. Couldn't be worse than what we've already been through, right?"
in that thought drove my blush into my ears, but I propped myself up on my elbow to lean over him.
Harry suddenly seemed like he had something to say, because he inhaled like he'd speak a few times, but never did.
"Wow," came Draco's quiet assessment. I wanted to laugh, but found no humor to summon. I felt
If I was honest with myself, I had been a little afraid I'd lose friends over this. But now, I realized that was silly. I knew my friends better than that, and they wouldn't see me any differently for something this petty. Anything anyone else had to throw at us, let them.

I coughed to cover my laughter.
I started collecting my things.
I pointed at her increasingly amused expression emphatically as I twisted my door knob and retreated into my dorm.
She was
"I'm just saying, it might be intimidating for the first-years. Also, yes, the other teams wouldn't stand a chance."

Just as I reached for the door, though, it swung open and students started filing out. Harry and I immediately stood against the wall to let them pass, when Weasley and Granger exited. Suspicious amusement raised her eyebrows at us, but all she said was,
Once we finally made it to the top of the tower, Professor Sinistra called for our attention and counted us out.

"If you get to know all about me, I want to know everything about you."
"Guys." Weasley asserted, and I was surprised to feel the atmosphere relax slightly.
"You think it'll be really bad?"
“Jesus
that, by the end of the class, I unintentionally stormed out of the room, leaving Hermione to collect her (and Ron's) things and hastily follow after me.
Harry's cheeks were tomato red, and all manner of obscene scenarios involving him flashed through my mind.
I followed her to Dumbledore's old office -
Heat crept into my face as my thoughts strayed toward more…
"What exactly is even the point of this class? Can you name me one practical application?"
I slightly shifted my face to glare at him with one eye. His hands were hovering over me, as if he would touch me, but didn't know if he should. With a sigh, I flipped over onto my back and considered his offer.
tore at my heart a bit. "Also saw the piece of Riddle that had been inside me my whole life." Something I wanted to call disgust curled his lip slightly. "And when I came back, it didn't."
The professors who’d gathered took a moment to assess the situation, and probably catch their breaths, before they nodded and turned back toward the professors’ table.
A scoff broke on my lips automatically. I studied his expression with confusion, expecting a punchline.
"Mione wants to go that bookshop in Hogsmeade, so 'spose that's what I'm doing."
'Oh? Why's that?'
"This isn't f-fair…" I managed to croak as his fingers tickled my skin. A deep laugh rumbled in his chest.
"I don't want to do this," I answered through gritted teeth. She gripped my arm. We walked in silence to our third class of the day, Charms.
A chill went down my spine as I considered the possibility that he used Dreamless Sleep as recklessly as I. I knew all about the side-effects that came with overuse - hallucinations, insomnia, mood swings - but didn't dare use Legillimens on him again. I knew how uncomfortably invasive it felt.
"Hi there," he smiled at me.
My teeth clicked closed. This was
As I shoved my hands into my pockets, he followed suit and set his glass down on the floor, a teasing smile playing at his mouth. He stood and stepped so close, his gin-breath ghosted across my lips.
"Mate, I've spent
"Come on," I invited him as I stepped into the shower. It was far too hot at first, and I turned the temperature down immediately. Once Draco'd stepped in, cheeks already blazing, the water was tolerable. Shampoo, conditioner, soap, and even a razor had been prepared for us by the room.
"How did you even get in here? The doors-"
"Will you come to class this time?"
Draco didn't leave the infirmary right away after having his wounds dressed, and thankfully, Madam Pomfrey allowed him some solitude.
‘Celebrity life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be then?’
"Er… Well, I…"
"I… I said I'm sorry! Okay?"
"Honestly, I'm not even sure it's a real memory. If it is, I was too young to understand what they were saying. It's just them, alive, and interacting with me."
"You…" I couldn't find the words to express how insecure this made me feel, so I decided to roughly jostle him with my elbow in his rib.
"Were you… His first time?"
Pleasure, and embarrassment, warmed my cheeks further. I offered him a smile, but swallowed when I saw the same awe-struck expression glowing in his eyes at me.

And then there were the nightmares. The months when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was living under his roof, when the screams would wake him up at night and he witnessed true Evil, replayed behind his eyelids until he drove himself to exhaustion to escape sleep. Only when his pride was well and truly shattered did he resort to taking Dreamless Sleep before bed. Now he couldn't sleep without it. It was the first thing he packed, safely tucked away at the bottom of his luggage, when he prepared to go back to school.

"You're just full of surprises, aren't you?"
"Mugwort."
She gasped in false betrayal.
My face pressed deeper into his neck as our chests pressed together. I was completely out of my depth, but still, my arms wriggled beneath him to wrap around his torso. His tickling fingers on my skin turned soothing, stroking up and down my back.
His laughter infected me as we lay next to each other, fighting to control our respective breathing. My arm beneath him started to grow numb, though, and I withdrew it with another groan. We were both glistening with sweat as I kicked my pants and trousers the rest of the way off, but I turned into him nonetheless. The arm and leg I threw over him seemed to stick, but I didn't mind. I tucked my head onto his chest and sighed.
"I know what you mean. It's also sort of neat that we'll be teaching each other what we all are individually learning about, too, but if we were just gonna read the textbook on our own time, what exactly is Sprout's purpose?"
"Ginny? Nah, it was actually Cho Chang."

I was surprised to realize I hadn't noticed him and Longbottom staring at us.
"Fine. Tell me something no one else knows about you," I dared him.
"Me, too." Being on the receiving end of

Draco was clearly pleased, too, judging by the look on his face as he leaned against his bathroom door watching me.
threw me completely off-guard when he suddenly seized my tie and crushed his lips to mine.
"You know, I can't help but wonder who your first kiss was. I want to guess… That Weasley girl?"
Harry'd held my bandaged hand. Roughly, too, like he'd forgotten I'd been injured. I stared down at it, flexing and fisting my fingers.
As he washed the last of the soap from his face, he turned back to me, blinking through the water.
"Oh, uh… Y-yeah. Shouldn't be as late as tonight, m-maybe ending around eight thirty?"
I’d predicted a response like ‘you’re worth it’ or ‘it’s not a chore,’ or something sappy along those lines.
"I-I think it would be…" He swallowed. "Like a safety net? If our dream turned terrible, to be able to wake up… Not alone…"
I shot a shocked look up at her, which she chuckled at.
The twisting wasn't wholly unpleasant, though…
What, would you be, like… A

‘Maybe a bigger bed? More pillows? Some mood lighting?’ As soon as my eyes scanned his shitty handwriting, he was writing more. ‘And if anyone casts a location charm on us, we’ll appear to be right where we’re meant to be.’
When I paused my stride to rejoin them, she jumped up from the table and approached me, still grinning playfully.

Harry rolled his eyes.

'Tidier than yours, I'd assume.'

I simply could not comprehend any reason why he'd ever think we had anything in common. Much less why he would ever…

Draco cleaned us up before leaning over me on his elbow, a devious grin on his face.
is in any way asking me out?" He laughed again, and I pouted. This was far too amusing for him, so I decided to turn the tables.
“Please…” I rolled my eyes, finally tearing them from his body as I stepped into my pants and pulled them up, wincing again as the elastic passed over my tender skin. “There’s nothing you could do to me I wouldn’t be able to handle.”
"Well, for one-"
Harry had rolled his eyes before taking the page back, penning his reply hastily.
"Morning!" Hermione's overly perky greeting confirmed my suspicions, and Harry gave me a guilty smile. A groaning, ruffled Weasley joined us just then, and another round of '

Pomfrey took his hands in hers without another word, assessing his scraped palm.
"Snape must've had a
"Mr. Potter, might I have a word?"
A short laugh crossed my lips as my cheeks warmed slightly.
He laughed again as I groaned.
"I don't see why it matters, or what you're even still doing here, for that matter."
"I'll save a seat for you in Transfig."
We’d both finished our meals at this point, and I decided I had to speak with him in private.
A deafening silence stretched out after this question.

"And just who the
Class was over before I realized, and it came as a shock to me that I'd survived the entire lesson without incident. This small victory gave me a tiny ounce of pride. However, that was quickly replaced with dread when Sinistra asked me to stay behind. I cast Harry a worried glance, but he nodded encouragingly.
Rodolfo raised his hands in defeat.
Shock, once again, stained his pink features. He blinked a few times before refocusing on my face. My hand loosened to allow his tie to slide from my fingers.
Draco collapsed onto my heaving chest, also heaving. We lay there a few euphoric moments, catching our breath, before I felt his hand searching the bed again. Once he'd found what I assumed was his wand, he cleaned us up and carefully withdrew from me. We both groaned at the extraction, and sighed once he'd laid beside me. Once my wits had slightly returned, the first words on my lips were a question.
"That's him, he's the traitor," an older man in a conductor's uniform pointed to me before stepping aside to allow several aurors into view.
I killed your precious Dark Lord, didn't I? Quite a few times, if I remember correctly." Outrage quivered my father's snarl, and I suddenly realized I could move freely again. "I could kill you with my eyes closed."
"Y-yeah, I've got some homework to do, as well, so…"
"Have you tried removing that?"
Is it w-working…?” He asked between moans.
Harry suddenly barked a laugh.
Now it was Harry's turn to be shocked silent. I took this as an affirmative, and the heat in my cheeks spread to my ears. I scowled at the floor.
"Thanks, Hermione. And guys, I'd
When the bell signaling the end of class finally tolled, I waited for the rest of the students to leave first, but groaned internally as I realized Harry was waiting for me. I didn't want to be alone with McGonagall now that I knew what I knew, but I
The most beautifully strangled cry ripped from Draco's lips as he released onto his chest a second later. Our gripped appendages squeezed each other so tightly as I tremblingly pressed as deep into him as I could reach. Once I was sure I couldn't cum another drop, I fell back onto my hands.
I felt very strange. Or rather, I didn't know how to feel. If Harry was going to try to befriend me, what did that mean for the rest of the student body? They worshipped the ground he walked on, but would they just as quickly accept me? I couldn't help but doubt it.
"You know, I could really see you and her becoming good friends. She's a great listener, and annoyingly perceptive, maybe a bit of a busybody but she means well."
"What else… Do you dream about?"
You'll notice I switched perspective for Draco's POV in this chapter. It's an intentional decision meant to allude to Draco's slow but sure self-actualization. Just wanted to assuage any doubts about it being a continuity error.

"On the contrary, I think this is
No more than a moment after he arrived in the infirmary, his legs turned to jelly. He swayed towards an empty bed and stumbled to sit on it. His heart was pounding in his ribs as the implications of what had just happened set in.
“Oh, my god, I’m so sorry.” My fingers instinctively pried his hand away from his eye. “Let me look at it.”
Draco swallowed and ducked his head to watch his fingers tug at his sleeve. He sat, lost in thought, as the sorting ceremony commenced.
"Thank you." I answered quietly.
"Dunno… If you're going to see Hagrid, I might… I dunno… Visit Hogsmeade?"
As soon as these words left my lips, I regretted them.
"You… You
"About what?"
Draco laughed at me and stood.
'I said it doesn't matter. They can think what they want, I'm going to live how I choose.'
“S’pose I should praise you for that… Even though it’s

Occlumency was just the other side of the coin, after all.
"Draco?"
"Should've been locked up in Azkaban with his father, you ask me."
"No no, that I think I can at least manage."
The nurse pursed her lips, but withdrew a small roll of bandages from her apron and started silently dressing his wounds.
‘Guess we’ll both age each other quicker’
"Sounds about right."
This time, when my mouth returned, I took his head into my mouth. He inhaled deeply as I ventured to swallow as much as I could. Draco let out a stuttering breath as I tested my oral limits. The taste of him flooded my senses, and I was suddenly sucking off as much of him as I could handle.
"Huh-uh." He lifted his head to look back at me. "Why? Does that surprise you?"

He laughed, and I joined him as I suddenly remembered our conversation about
"And what did you say? Mr. Unimpressive Vocabulary?"
As defeatist as his statement objectively sounded, it sparked something like
something I enjoy, too.”
Next was Herbology.
" I hadn't meant to exclaim this, but it slipped from my lips nonetheless. Draco observed my expression with concern, but seemed to be reassured as he closed the gap between his hips and mine. An incredible sound slipped from his lips as he did this, and I gasped.
“No. Of
"If only the world were as understanding as you." I smiled back as Draco seemed to truly put thought into his ideal future. "I guess... I've always had a knack for potions. Maybe I could be a potions master?"
Word had seemed to spread like wildfire, because, as we walked hand-in-hand to Charms, the whispers followed us like an Oppugno charm. I found it didn’t bother me as much as I thought it would’ve, though. And it wasn’t just because the hand in mine happened to vanquish the Dark Lord, but because it was
“Git,” he uttered as he withdrew his textbook and notes. I followed suit as Slughorn began class, but my heart was still in knots several minutes into his lecture, so I gestured for our note-passing Horcrux journal page. Once it was placed on my desk, my quill was immediately on its surface.
"I'll see you in the library after lunch."
Now, Draco gasped in fake outrage, and gripped his chest as if I'd wounded him. I stifled a laugh.
Draco's moans were different than before. They were somehow more… Desperate. Urgent. I drank in the sounds he produced, but couldn't help but join him.
Withdrawing my own robes, I returned to the side of the bed. Draco blinked up at me, a bleary smile spreading across his face.
"Yeah…"
"It's only been forty minutes? Felt like hours. I was afraid we missed the constellation."
"I'm sure
With a groan of my own, I extracted myself from Draco's embrace and the sheets as I stumbled toward the bathroom.
"Sorry. Go on. We…?"
"Better safe than sorry," Draco assented as he polished off his pasty and knelt by his bedside cupboard. He withdrew two glasses, and I just barely glimpsed a very familiar bottle tucked away at the back of the cabinet. Setting the glasses on his desk, he pointed his wand at one, then the other. "Aguamenti."
I straddled him silently for a few moments to allow us both to catch our breaths, but didn't shift an inch. If his hands were to push me away, I'd let them. He blinked up at me, lips slightly parted and his eyes still hazy. When he
"Yeah…"
He didn’t respond through words. Instead, what I found was a smug kind of grin on his face.
"I would love to fuck you," I answered honestly.
"Hm, I see."
I nodded, a grin creeping into my face.

apologized."
Maybe this was to my benefit, though. I could fulfill McGonagall's request without a hitch AND still be respected by my peers? I also hadn't expected that the respect of my peers would become so important to me.
Draco's cheeks, still flushed from crying, darkened a shade as he dropped his eyes down to his water. His fingers worried his earlobe adorably.
“Right, of course not… It’s the weekend, after all, and… You said you’d let me know the moment she responded.”
Jealousy warmed my cheeks, but I realized I wasn't only jealous that he had more experience than me… I was jealous of
"What, um…" Harry looked up at me expectantly, and I cleared my throat again. "What did they say?"
Well… Half of it did, anyway. The other half was still swirling the drain of
Honesty with myself was a new skill I'd been forced to learn, but it was working itself overtime now that I had an inkling as to how Harry felt about me.
Longbottom's mouth was actually hanging open. Harry's chewing mouth could hardly stay closed as wide as he was grinning. Finnegan looked like he'd lost the ability to comprehend language. Even Weasley was leaning around Granger and Harry to make sure he'd heard me right.
“Mmf-!” I exclaimed in surprise. Once he released me, his face was bright red. Mine was likely similar, so warm were my cheeks.
, but the memory suddenly flooded back as I took in his marred skin.
'If we keep sitting together in class, neither of us will pay any attention.'
"I'd like to ask you a favor, Harry." I was shocked to hear her use my first name, but realized whatever she was about to ask was important.
I committed it to memory as I silently attended Harry's throbbing erection. He clapped a hand over his mouth, and I was all the more committed to having him yield to his pleasure. I reached my left hand up to peel his from his mouth, replacing it on my head. Another
He awoke with a start, and for a brief moment, I saw wild horror in his eyes. A look I was all too familiar with. When he found my face, his ears turned bright pink.

‘Of course. Still, that stick is rather pitiful…’ He turned a teasing grin up at me as he stamped out the final ellipses. His competitive nature inflamed my own as I snatched the page back from beneath his hand.

"So… How's your mum?"
"During sixth year…
I froze in shock.
A grimace twisted at my mouth.
She shied away from me initially, but once her eyes found my face, a kind of wonder overtook the terror. I reached out a hand to her, offering her a smile.
was only lesson one, you know…” My legs came into contact with his desk, and I braced myself back on my hands against it, but still he stepped closer. His next words ghosted over my lips. “There’s still plenty left to teach you.”
"That's… Amazing. Oh, my god."
"What do you want?"
Draco covered his laughter with a cough, the pink in his cheeks darkening a shade. I suddenly felt McGonagall's eyes on me, and strove to appear attentive. Eventually, though, my quill returned to the diary page.
This realization sent my thoughts reeling as I strove to focus on the text before me.
"No…"
Harry?
He reluctantly pulled up his soaked sleeve to reveal the still-bleeding wrist where he'd scratched through the skin at his Dark Mark. Pomfrey gave him a curious look, which he shied away from.
"There's, ahem… Also this…"
We ended up holding hands the entire class. I was unwilling to let his hand go, and he never tried to pull away, either. Which left us in a very awkward position.
‘You’re a fucking genius’
'If anything, he'd tell YOU to move.'
gonna know what we've done."
So exhausted and preoccupied was I that I was asleep beneath the covers before I could remember my Dreamless Sleep. It'd been longer than I'd care to admit since I last had a dream, but the dream I had that night was unlike the ones I'd come to expect.
'If you'd fucked up any more, I'd have to marry you immediately.'
"Malfoy's never going to change, what exactly does she hope being
His eyes opened slightly, and took a second to focus on mine.
"Anytime," he responded in kind. I didn't release his hand yet, though. I was afraid if I did, I'd lose the balance I'd just finally achieved.
"But I
The long-forgotten feeling of bare chest against bare chest made my heart race, and Harry himself was drawing in ragged breaths.
A sigh so relieved I thought I might pass out crossed my lips.
"Do what? Tell your father off?"
"Really?"
Draco lifted his head to offer me a curious expression, and my cheeks warmed as I realized what I'd just implied. Instead of shying away this time, though, I quirked my eyebrow back at him.
At a certain point, his hand clasped my wrist, and I understood this meant he was ready. I couldn't possibly be any harder than I was, so with utmost care, I removed my fingers and positioned myself where my fingers had been. A shaking sigh slipped across my lips as I pressed myself into him, and all doubts about if
"Wow," he assented. "That's weird. It's like… A blank spot in the sky. Like someone erased a few stars in one place."
"Don't get me wrong. I support however you feel. You haven't led us astray yet, so…"
Draco's flush returned, and I grinned.

Draco reached behind him and shut the water off. We stood there, dripping, for several tense moments.

Draco and I were at the same tree beside the Black Lake, sitting side-by-side and holding hands.

"At the time, it did feel like a slap in the face, but..." I winced. "Your intentions were different than they are now. You were just being nice because you were asked to."
"Tonight, I'd like you all to use your telescopes that you should have purchased by now, to find the dark cloud constellation pictured here in your textbooks. It should be visible a few minutes past midnight, at the coordinates listed beneath the image. Be ready to talk about your findings in the next class."
‘Love?’ My hand wrote slowly. Draco’s eyebrow quirked as I glanced sideways at him. Hastily, I explained my thought process. ‘When V’ I scratched out the V and continued, ‘Riddle tried to kill me as a baby, my mother’s sacrifice cast some sort of protection spell over me that ended when I turned 18. If love can bounce the Killing Curse off me effectively enough to slay the caster’
"Really?
"Of course! After glimpses into your head, how could I resist a full tour?" He grinned at me playfully, and I returned his playfulness with a weak shove.
"I'm so glad you came back," he said, and I couldn't help but return his smile.
"Then what!? WHY are you being so… So nosy about me? Getting involved in my business? Sticking up for me when no one asked you to!?"
me," were the first words out of his mouth. I cast a dubious glance back at his stupid, grinning face.
My arms hooked under his knees, forcing his legs further back, and I saw stars. Harry's back arched, and I couldn't help but climax. What I could only classify as a glorious, three-part scream nearly deafened my left ear as I came inside him.
The swiftness with which his quill came down to reply to me was encouraging, but I still anxiously awaited his response.
"I once inflated my aunt at fifteen because she talked shit to my face. Got an earful from the ministry."
“Have you got Quidditch practice today?”
"You should sometime," he commented as he pulled me into him.
"Never did get to that herbology project, either." He reclined on his bed, grinning at me shamelessly as my eyes strayed over his pale limbs. The damn flush that'd never really left my face warmed further as my eyes finally met his again.
Sure, I knew him as Scarhead, the Boy Who Lived, Saint Potter, but what about his childhood? What kind of environment shaped him? What were his nightmares about?
live in a closet for the majority of my childhood. Who'd have thought?"
“Look at me,” I requested.
"I presume you're aware some… Unexpected peers of yours have returned this year."
Once we were alone again, Harry turned back to me and knelt before me.
"Well… Balls of fire and such, but I don't see
"Of course I have. It's a handcrafted spell, though, so it's not like a removal spell is just conveniently lying around."
I swallowed and looked up at him. Instead of an answer, an apology found its way out of my mouth.
My cheeks warmed even further as I nodded.
We arrived to breakfast together, as per usual, but a knot of anxiety had begun to fester in my gut.
"Ten twenty. Still got plenty of time."
As painful as it was, I eventually withdrew my mouth and clambered back on top of him. His bleary gaze found my face, and confusion stained his features.
“Er… Dinner?” He asked, and I chuckled.
“Oh, we will. I just want to tease you a little before we go…” His knees pushed mine apart as he wedged himself between them. A whimper escaped my lips as I reopened my drooping eyes to see his intrigued observation of my face.
"Oh, right, of course, um… Well… Better than expected, I guess."
"Wanna walk together?"
say?"
I swallowed at his intense expression, but with a glance downward, he finally lifted himself off me with a sigh and stood facing the bed.
Frustration flickered in me at his persistence, but I couldn't just stand there stammering and blushing like a child as I tried to reason with him. I clicked my tongue and started towards the Slytherin table.
I thought as I forced my attention back to my textbook.
I glanced back to see Draco recognize the situation, turn bright red, and retreat from the room with the rest of the students. I sighed.
"We have our Herbology presentation tomorrow," he noted.
"My sentiments exactly."
I scowled, but the wandless, nonverbal magic we’d practiced the previous night gave me an idea. It was tricky, like trying to hit my own knee just right to cause the kicking reflex, but I tried to imagine the panic I’d feel if someone opened the door just then, and suddenly my tie loosened around my wrists.
My hand released his, and it fell to his side. I hadn't meant to act so negatively when I didn't feel that way, so all I could think to do to make up for this perceived dismissal was to tilt his dejected face up to mine and kiss him again. I couldn't get enough of his lips, if I was honest with myself. And the resulting flush in his cheeks was well worth it. I smiled.

Not in a million years."
'Impressive, Mr. Minimal Effort. Just how much schoolwork are you hoping to accomplish in one night?'
"You're fucking
His implication of my weakness didn't miss me, but Harry laughed.
Draco's chin came to rest against my shoulder.
I was speechless for a moment as I felt my eyes mist.
the one here now, aren't I?"
We lay there, panting and glistening, for a good several minutes before Draco finally withdrew from me with a groan and laid beside me.
My ears turned hot, and I didn't respond for several minutes. I wasn't sure why
"That… Might just be the most unexpecting thing of all. I mean, you've essentially been a celebrity since birth, I'm sure you've had girls lining up your whole life?"
"Hiya, Harry." Hermione smiled at me, bringing me back to reality.
“And you’re…” He pressed one more kiss to my lips. “So fucking hot.”
"You're probably right." He was worrying his lip, and I had the sudden urge to distract him.
Harry laughed as he pictured this.
"I… Don't know who I am. Where I am. What time is it?"
"Y'know…" Draco was idly picking apart a roll of bread as he spoke in a hushed tone. "People will talk…"
In my nightmares, having the Chosen One by my side was a comfort, but here, amidst the scrutiny and judgment of our peers, it was having Harry by my side.
"I-if that's what you want…"
"By the way, it's… Eleven twenty."
'Yeah'
"I'll always come back. You should know that by now,
I stood and wiped my eyes, resolving to think about it tomorrow. My legs carried me to the dorms on their own, and I didn't even have enough presence of mind to try to hide the fact I'd been crying until who should I run into right at the door to the Room of Requirement but Harry.
Thankfully, my joke landed and we laughed together. The mood only slightly lightened, though.
"I know. I… I want to."
"Er… You going to breakfast?"
"Sorry, I…" He hiccupped again. "I think I needed that."
"By the way…" My eyes were finally drawn up towards his as he spoke. "Where the hell did you learn how to fasten a chest harness?"
9:00 found me in my pajamas, arms laden with snacks and my book bag slung across my body outside his door. As it swung open, I saw Draco clad in black silk pajamas, and my cheeks flushed. His did, too, as he took in the sight of me.
again. The slight smile curling his lips, the faint pink in his cheeks, the pensive look in his eyes.
"You're right. I'm sorry for… Feeling feelings? I dunno… Sorry for apologizing."
He quirked an eyebrow at me.
"Oh… Well… You're nothing like how I always thought you were, so
"You didn't happen to see who it was that pushed you, did you?"
Not even close.
Draco's mind couldn't even complete the thought, couldn't comprehend it. Surely this was just a fluke? A mistake? A cruel joke?
My closed eyes opened to gaze at my ceiling.
First with one eye, and then both, he peered up at me. As my eyes locked with his, I took the opportunity to
I gave a disbelieving laugh.
“Well,
"Morning," she commented sleepily as she slid onto the bench beside Harry. His eyes narrowed at me as if to say
particular thought could fully form. Draco jumped.
I think you should leave."
Potter seemed… Oddly exhausted. Now that the Dark Lord was dead, did he have any reason to lose sleep anymore?
Before I could really even think about it, I delicately reached into his mind.
"My dear boy… The War affected us
When I glanced up at the fading ink, my heart stopped.
"Draco…"
Once the door closed behind me, the floodgates opened. I slid against my door and crumpled to the floor.
Confusion, and his hands gripping my upper arms, brought my eyes back up to his finally.
"Stop looking at me!"
"It's mental to me that you and he got away with what you did. Sure your father was preoccupied, but where was your mother during all that?"
I’d anticipated his words to be much more cutting, and my grimace relaxed into a smirk once my eyes scanned his words. Just then, McGonagall distracted us as she called for us to take out our wands and quills. We were to transfigure the feathers into leaves, and Harry and I exchanged a glance as, I assumed, we both realized we’d be one quill short now. Nonetheless, we followed along with her incantation and wand pattern. Harry was immediately successful, of course, a broad grin stretching across his face.
I snorted delicately.
We snickered quietly as the presentations continued. It was all very mind-numbing, and my thoughts began straying toward this morning, when suddenly an idea interrupted them. Frowning, I quietly withdrew my Basic Charms and Spells textbook from my bag, flipping it open to M. Draco eyed me curiously as I looked up a certain Latin suffix used in some offensive spells. Once I’d found it, a glimmer of hope lit within me. Grey eyes were still trained on my book, and I vigorously circled the following definition:
"Well, you're lucky I'm not just taking out my sexual frustration on you, then." He leaned down to kiss me again, and I realized he was probably talking about Rodolfo.
Harry had started eating nonchalantly, as if to encourage everyone to ease up, but it was especially ineffective on me. I simply sat, staring down at my hands and fiddling with my bandages.
Initially, we were all surprised silent, but his hunched over, shaking figure sent us back over the edge. When our laughter finally subsided, I withheld a sudden urge to see if Draco was
He glanced around at our classmates before turning his flush back to me.
about the rest of you. Are you hurt anywhere?”
"Oh, er… Nothing, do you…? Do you want me to carry any of those, or…?"
"You don't have to apologize. I can't imagine what living with him under the same roof must've been like."
"Some might say I don't think at all," I mused.
“Good.”
When I didn't interrupt him, he glanced at me and sighed.
I tried to keep my face neutral as if I was paying attention to her lecture, but it was a struggle to keep a scathing glare off my face.
I blushed down at my lap as Harry beamed at his friends.
"I should be telling
With careful movements, Draco stood and dropped his pajama pants and briefs. My eyes widened at the sight of him naked, but he was tugging my own pants and boxers down over my feet, and I exhaled shakily.
The pink in his ears darkened a shade.
I laughed again and glanced backward at my clock.
It was jarring to let his hand go after all that time. My hand felt…
If he was skipping class, I completely understood. I didn't want to be up here myself. But the entire castle was littered with trauma, so why would this tower be different from, say, Snape's old classroom?
more than I let on… Before, when I… Used legillimency on you…" The volume of his voice gradually died away, but I still heard him. My eyes widened.
"You might recognize me from the Daily Prophet, or from, y'know, killing Voldemort, and I have to say-"
“Merlin forbid,” he teased as I pulled him into me, resting his head on my shoulder with my arm around him. “So you’re…
"Why-" I'd meant to ask

"Congratulations. Your memory and insufferable empathy are both intact."
A shock went through me as everyone looked around for the blond.
"Anytime," I answered before I could think better of it.
“How are you
He snorted.
"I realize what I'm asking, given your history, but if you're the one to accept him, I'm sure the others will fall in line."
"Why?"
We cautiously exited the train once the door slid open, and made our way towards the boats. Everything seemed normal so far, but I realized I was walking on eggshells.

"Well,
Harry pulled out his own Herbology textbook and flipped to the very back.
His smirk suddenly fell from his face as I passed the sheet back.
"I've even had private tutors. Nothing seems to work."
Maybe this could be the moment he snuck off to the infirmary for some gauze? But coming to class late was worse than just being last, and he didn't want to start the semester off getting points taken from his house. So, with a grim scowl, he followed his peers to Herbology, a good seven paces behind them.
"No… No, I'm… Just a kid…"
"Brilliant." Harry beamed at me, and I was suddenly very interested in finding this appendix he had been reading from.
"Fuck me, I'm sorry, I know his name probably-"
Now it was
The rage burning in his chest sunk into his stomach, where it changed to dread.
'If you still hate me, you don't have to go out of your way to tolerate me, you know. If you want to tell me to fuck off forever, I will.'
Every cell in my body was screaming at me to turn tail and flee. It took all the mental fortitude I had to take that first hesitant step onto the first stair. I felt like a fucking child, having Harry walk at my pace, as if I would faint at any second and tumble back down.
My father sneered at Harry.
"Hey, guys? Harry here, Harry Potter." Harry stood between them and me, facing the aurors who'd come for me.
When we arrived to the library, the rest of the class had all but taken every single table. Several of them still gave us weird glances, but said nothing.
"Your friends will always be your friends, though, and it's not like we can never come back here. I'm sure you'll be invited back to make appearances like every other week." Harry snorted. "I, for one, can't wait to have free time again. Free time! I can't even remember what that's like."
“You in a hurry?”
had something to do with it!"
Draco snatched the papers and quills out of Potter's hands and stood so suddenly, he felt woozy. The other boy stood more slowly, giving him an unreadable expression before turning on his heel and walking out. Draco was frozen for a few more moments, trying to process what just happened, before his feet started leading him to the infirmary on their own.
'Have we been passing notes on a Horcrux?'
"It's quite itchy. I should probably get my bandages replaced again soon, but it might already be scabbing."
"You read my mind."
Draco glanced up at me, and I realized I'd been staring. Instead of infringing on his privacy again, I reached into my bag and withdrew a certain journal I probably shouldn't be carrying around, and tore a page out of it.
We walked the rest of the way to the transfiguration classroom in silence. I noticed his pace slow once we were among other students again, but I only slowed my pace to match without a word. Keeping him out of trouble meant getting him to class, too, right?
Finnigan cleared his throat.
"Cheers," we both took long drinks from our respective cups before I refilled them to drink more.
A shameful flush stole into my cheeks as I crawled under the covers of my bed.
"Oh… My god…" I winced with my hand on my door handle as she put two and two together. Slowly, I turned to see her shocked expression. "You…!"
"Wait, so you
My insult brought a grin to his face, and I failed to resist my returning smile.

"Well..." My fingers fidgeted anxiously as I tried to put my feelings into words. "I guess, you probably assumed, but um... We sort of... Kissed..."
His words were interrupted by my stomach gurgling, and I saw him sigh with a smirk.
Herbology started off with material I vaguely remembered, but with Hermione constantly nudging me to take notes, the information nestled in my memory a bit more firmly. Malfoy was at the back of the room now, and halfway through the lecture, I felt that same prickly feeling on the back of my neck, and had to force myself not to check if he was looking at me. What did I care?
just so I could hear his laugh again.
"There's that girl that's always hanging around with him and that redhead?"
Finally, we were next. I stifled a groan as we made our way to the front of the class. Expressions ranging from intrigue, to embarrassment, to disgust, to bewilderment littered the faces before us, but I only rolled my eyes as I introduced our topic.
The rest of the lecture continued uneventfully, and we both took a fair bit of notes.

bad, was it?"
Chuckling again, he sat back beside me. I took another mouthful of water as he sipped his drink and leaned his head back. His face took on such a serene expression as his eyes slipped closed, but I fought against the impulse to kiss him again.
Draco scoffed and playfully kicked me under the table.
‘You can choose not to trust me all you want. I’m still right’ was his reply.
His eyebrows raised at me.
Hermione - know I'd been taking it just about every night, but I just couldn't risk the nightmares. I knew the risks and consequences of continued usage, but still, I popped the cork out and threw back a dose. I wouldn't be dependent on it forever, I knew that, but just for now…
"Don't get ahead of yourself, you'll jinx it," Harry cautioned teasingly before sighing. "I'm gonna miss this."
Draco's face turned bright red, and he didn't take the paper back for several nail-biting minutes. When he finally reached his quill over to my desk, all he wrote was,
“What is it?”
She beamed up at me.
"You-
My cheeks flushed and I ducked my head.
"M-my parents… Said they were proud of me… And I asked if dying hurt, and… Sirius said it was like falling asleep. I guess he was just trying to encourage me, because I quickly discovered what a lie that was. Still, prophecies are no joke. Everything happened exactly as it was predicted."
I adjusted my own tie as Harry blinked up at me. My cheeks had never been so hot, and he'd never looked more attractive. My eyes were drawn to his raw, red lips, but I forced my attention away.
Another assenting grunt.
"Well, it's still a ways off, but... Is there anything you want to do?"
I hummed in assent as we clasped hands and made our way to dinner.
"Harry… You're the most Gryffindor Gryffindor I've ever met. If you can defeat Voldemort, you can date Draco Malfoy."
He turned a smug grin back toward my scathing glare.
It'd been quite a long time since I'd done this, but the muscle memory easily returned as I focused on keeping a consistent rhythm with both my mouth and my fingers. His leg twitched again as a wholly
to Sinistra talk about stars and shite. When she told us to take out our textbooks, Harry withdrew his from his bag with his free hand and flipped to the star map in question. He held it out between us so I could see, too, and the gratitude I felt toward him solidified in me.
As I tucked the last few buttons into their respective button holes, I finally met her eyes again, and what I saw melted my heart slightly.
"But…" He continued with a frown. "Since it's
I peeked up at him shamefully.
I was about to say,
"It drove me mad knowing you were watching me those first few days. I honestly couldn't tell if you had it out for me, or something else."
Harry moaned with every movement. His brow was knotted seemingly in concentration, but his fingers on my neck relaxed.
What I saw was Draco, hesitantly withdrawing his wand and handing it to Seamus, whose eyes glowed with such awe that I could see it from here. He took it very delicately, turning it over and looking at it.
Slughorn lifted his wand and quietly sent a message to Sprout about how I would be late.
"Jesus… I guess I can't really talk, having
I gagged as the next thought formed.
"So, what? You want to be
Harry barked a laugh.
‘And go where?’
"Harry… Something isn't right here…"
I interrupted before
All the same, I waited at my desk with him. We'd definitely be late to Herbology, but even Sprout had all the time in the world for the Boy Who Lived. I wondered briefly if that title bothered him.
‘She’ll HAVE to curve it after hearing ours. Wouldn’t be fair to the rest of the class’
"Th-thanks…"
grateful
With another groan, I lifted myself off him and leaned over the side of my bed to grab my wand. I cast the same vanishing spell inside him as I'd done before, and that was that. I flopped onto the bed beside him, throwing an arm and a leg over him.
My face was hot again. I took a long gulp of water and tried not to look suspicious, but it was in vain.

Return to Hogwarts? After all he had done? He didn't believe it until he received his formal invitation via owl. He wasn't sure he wanted to stay home, either. Since losing Lucius, Narcissa had grown even more distant from Draco, and the one source of warmth in his home turned cold. He had to go back, though, as a sign of good faith and atonement. Draco understood the pretenses very clearly. This last year would be a test, to see if he would follow in his father's footsteps now that the Dark Lord was gone.
"Well, you don't have to consider me your problem. I don't know who asked you to reach out to me, or why you're even doing it, for that matter, but I give you full permission to leave it. I'm fine on my own."
"No kidding. Surely there's

A gentle smile warmed the older woman's face.

Several times throughout the monotonous transfiguration class, I caught myself scratching at my bandages.
"Ah, hell."
Everyone's eyes were back on me now, and I would've ran right then if I hadn't caught Harry giving me the biggest, stupidest grin.
"I said things were going fine."
Just as I was slipping into a chair at an empty table and pulling out my Herbology textbook, what must've been the
My eyes narrowed at her. Maybe she wasn't as oblivious as I suspected? I hesitantly cast Legillimens at her, but it bounced off her Occlumens and she gave me a scowl. I smiled apologetically at her, silently chastising myself for doubting her Occlumency skills.

‘Not as open as you’ My eyes glanced over to see his absorb my reply, quickly followed by the darkening of his cheeks. Flitwick suddenly distracted us by assigning us reading in our textbooks, and we both jotted down the page numbers he indicated. As soon as my quill lifted from my notes, the journal page we’d been passing disappeared from my desk.
"O-oh, I just… Wanted… To know if…" My reasoning trailed off. I heard it, but I couldn't come up with anything reasonable to fill my silence with. Hermione huffed.
"Fair point."
possessed her to try to match such an unlikely pair? What gave her the right? This anger was a hollow, knee-jerk response for me by now, though. As much as it made me cringe at myself, I was grateful to them both for interfering. Not that I wouldn't have managed by myself, but now I wouldn't have to.
"So are you doing Quidditch again this-"
"I get it."
to invite him back?"
Granger was wrapped around his arm, and they were talking animatedly until they saw me. Harry's carefree face immediately changed to one of alarm when he saw my puffy eyes, but I wasn't about to have this conversation here and now. I went through the doors ahead of them and power walked all the way to my room.
I rolled my eyes, but purposefully hid the pleased flush I felt under my skin as I crouched to retrieve my pajamas. When I straightened and glimpsed him checking me out, I playfully swatted at him.
"More like, what kind of jobs would there even be for a... For someone like me?"

I couldn't help but glance down at his legs spread around either side of mine. My awareness was suddenly focused on my hips, where his fingers were sneaking up my shirt. I swallowed and studied his face, trying to determine if he was teasing me or genuinely trying to…
"Ooh, I heard that too!"
“Go talk to Hooch. I’m… I’m going to write my mother a letter.”
“I… I think I’m okay…”
“Ow,” he groaned as he clasped his eye with one hand.
"Oh… Er…" Draco cleared his throat and withdrew his hand, and an alarm sounded in my mind. "You… You might want to extend the range of your, um… Cloaking spell you were using for your back."
My dorm was just a hallway, a staircase, and another hallway away, but as I was turning the corner from the top of the stairs onto my floor, a ruffled-looking Hermione was returning to her own room.
The extent of my small-talk ended there as my eyes glanced down at his naked body on their own. My cheeks flamed.

but at that moment we arrived at the astronomy tower and I paused. Luna's sixth sense must've kicked in because she took my hand firmly. I smiled at her.
"Still," Ron hopped to his feet. "We've always got your back, yeah?"
His phrasing was purposefully pessimistic, but I considered it seriously.

"R-reverse aging."
Caution was, yet again, thrown to the wind as I felt him poking against my arse.
He shook his head and pressed my hand more firmly against his chest.
Our project was making rapid progress, largely thanks to me, but I didn't mind. By the end of our free period, we had compiled some solid notes and even a tentative idea for presenting. Confident in our academic success, we packed up our things and walked to Astronomy together.
"Hermione's one of the last people you should worry about. That is, unless you get on her bad side."

His answering smirk was closer to a smile at my implied,

H-Harry…"
Suddenly, something clicked.
A grimace twisted my face as I finally admitted to myself that
‘YOU’RE the one constantly thinking about it. I can see it on your face’ My hands clapped onto my cheeks at this notion, loud enough that a few classmates closest to us cast suspicious glances back at us. Which, of course, only made my face hotter. Harry, however, continued. ‘You’re like an open book’
Here, McGonagall removed her half-moon glasses and paused.
My heart squeezed in my chest as I realized
When I didn't look up at him, he took a step closer to me.
"Does it feel like I'm sure?" He leaned in to whisper this against my lips, his fingers tight on my hips. Even though it was dark, I was sure he could see just how red my cheeks were as I nodded. His lips pressed against mine as he started walking us back to his bed, and my hands came up to cling to his shoulders. "Don't worry, I'll walk you through it," he assured as he slid back on the bed, taking one of my hands to usher me down between his legs.
"Morning. Have you two got plans this weekend?"

"Wait, we're missing one. Has anyone seen Malfoy?"
My face warmed.
"Pathetic. And after
Draco raised an eyebrow at me.
"His name was Rodolfo." Harry cast a bleary glance at me before closing his eyes.
Slughorn finally strolled into class, immediately launching into his lecture for the day.
I rolled my eyes at his grin.
deserve a break."
"Maybe… But if I hadn't… W-what would you… Want from me?" His fingers trailing my scars inched downward, and I turned my gaze toward him. When his eyes raised to meet mine, I swallowed.
Harry jostled his elbow into my rib, and it seemed to sink all the way into my heart and squeeze. For some reason, it made me want to cry, but I redirected that energy to squeeze his hand instead. With his hand in mine, we were the only two people in the entire world, and I could do anything.
No one would speak to him the first day, of that he was sure. But that wouldn't last long. He quickly dodged all interaction and fled up the spiral staircase to the boy's quarters and found his room. Once the door shut behind him, he breathed a sigh of relief. He'd made it this far, hadn't he? He couldn't give up now.
Now it was my turn to awkwardly drop my gaze. I traced the rim of my glass anxiously as he took several moments to respond.
My heart seemed to squeeze slightly as warmth crept into my cheeks. Seamus gave a dramatic flourish with Draco's wand, inciting laughter from everyone. A chuckle even broke in my mouth.
Honestly, we all have reason to suspect you…” One of them was commenting as I reached the group.
Draco's mind was still so tumultuous, all he could answer was,
"Ah-ha! 'More reading,' ummm, antidotes, antidotes, antidotes…"
He stood and went to the window, legs wobbling slightly.
I'm not sure how long I was staring, but as soon as I realized I was, I decided to leave him to sleep. But at that very moment, his sleeping became disturbed. His brow knit together and his breathing accelerated.
"M-morning, I was just… Er…" I vaguely gestured toward my door and brushed past her without another word.
I felt all the blood rush out of my face.
"That's true... But I was always going to say or do something the minute I saw you being targeted."
"Bet I could do it."
Relate
Draco laughed, and my anxiety eased slightly.
"Fine, fine. Don't talk to your best friends about your problems."
"You'll change your mind once word gets out."
Harry smiled at me, and I felt my heart melt a little. I couldn't help but smile back at him. The silence dragged on a bit too long, and I cleared my throat.
"What do you want from me?" I interrupted his asinine question. A long silence stretched after my question, during which I looked up to find a startled expression on his face. This shock eased into discomfort, though, which I thought only fair, since he was encroaching on my comfort zone.
"You think I need someone to babysit me while you're busy?" I asked incredulously. It came out a bit more biting than I'd meant. Harry only cocked an eyebrow at me, but Hermione, ever-sensitive, interrupted his answer.
"Hm. Well, we'll just start without him." Sinistra launched into her lesson, but my ears could only hone in on the whispers around me.
Once the bell rang, I didn't bother waiting to see what he would do. Hermione and I were off to our next class, with Ron following behind. It was nice to be surrounded by all these familiar faces, and having shared trauma with them all slightly altered the mood between us. It was a comfort. I was just recognizing a sense of respect from them all when I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I threw a glance over my shoulder, not knowing what to expect, but a sad, envious-looking Malfoy was not even close.
"Well… No, not a
Draco's suspicion earned another snicker from me.
"Astutely observed. What of it?"
Unsure if he was serious or not, I leaned forward on my elbows across the table. I'd only meant to call his bluff as I realized the implications such an act of affection would have on our social lives, in such a social space. My cheeks flamed.
No…" Came my quiet response. Harry's hands fell from my arms, and I suddenly felt colder.
"Oh, r-right."
I offered a guilty smile up at him as he rolled his eyes and slid into bed beside me.
"Are you alright?"
I laughed.

showing up to breakfast, but Harry had distracted me enough.
"This is weird…" My discomfort at the emptiness was slowly mounting.
"I'm-I'm sorry! I really am, Draco, I…" I felt the bed shift as he came to sit beside me. He sighed. "If there's anything you want to know about me, I'll be one hundred percent honest with you. I promise."
Draco sighed.
to be nice to him
"Plenty of time… To return the favor?" I hummed noncommittally as he rolled over to lay on my chest. My arm snuck under him to wrap around him as his fingers traced my scars.
When the bell rang, we finally separated as we both turned to walk out first. Neither of us said a word as we descended the Astronomy tower. Before either of us could think of anything to say, we'd arrived at our Transfiguration class.
My hand straying toward his groin paused as I considered this.
I tried -
"You're

‘Suppose you’re taking it as a personal challenge to convince me of my worth?'
He seemed to deliberate a moment before responding.
"But…
This time, I gasped at her in false hurt.
Draco's legs lifted to rest on either of my shoulders as I pushed myself fully into him. Our matching groans were like music.
My next period was a free period, so I decided to go to the library, where I expected Hermione to join (maybe Ron if she insisted). Once slumped in a seat, I half-heartedly took out some notes I meant to clean up, but my mind was stuck.
‘You came back to school’ he began. I rolled my eyes at this, but he continued. ‘You held the most powerful wizard of our age at wand-point’ This, I winced at. ‘You survived living with Lucius, you survived living with Riddle, you lied to Bellatrix’s face, you risked your life for me, you apologized, you owled your mum, you’ Here, I reached over to still his hand. My heart couldn’t take another word as his paragraph of text slowly disappeared. Before I could think of a reply, his hand started moving again under mine. ‘You should give yourself more credit’ was his final, messy inscription before he passed the note back to me.
"Did you have a better idea?"
Our welcome was a much more relaxed one than our first, but I barely touched my food, and of course Hermione noticed.
"Anyway, g'night."
"What what?"
"Yeah…"
“Think you could do it?” I dared him as I began slowly withdrawing from his warmth. He groaned, then swallowed.
“No, but what if there’s someone new who’s really good? It wouldn’t be fair to them if Hooch just
He stared down at the blank sheet, twiddling his quill between his fingers for a long moment. His quill lowered to the surface twice before he finally wrote back and returned the note to me.
'Should I bring our Herbology stuff tonight?'
The blood that had left my face quickly flooded back into it. I buried it in my arms crossed over the back of the chair, but not before glimpsing the look on Draco's face. It was mostly surprised, but also a little… Gleeful?
He'd started suckling my finger, and I felt the flush in my cheeks spread to my ears.
"If not for a few key factors, we could've all been saved by Neville."
As we entered the Great Hall, our conversation about Quidditch practice was derailed by a commotion at the Slytherin table. A first-year was in tears on the floor before a group of, of all things,
"I think you should go for it. It's our last year anyway, might as well do what you want while we can."
"Now THAT'S not fair. You had complete control over that dream, why should you assume I had anything to do with it?"
The sun was barely illuminating the sky from behind the mountains when I sat up to glance out the window. I flopped back on my pillow with a groan.
" Hermione wondered.
"Maybe you're just wicked powerful, like I've said?" Harry cocked his head to the side as if to say
Truth be told, I maybe saw a little too much when I used Legillimency on Draco. How he hated being called by his surname because he associated it with his father, how worthless he felt that any attention directed at him was baffling… My distaste toward him softened, however slightly.
“Right,” I snorted. “Like all of Gryffindor isn’t gonna be lining up to join this year.”
My heart swelled
"What was that Legillimency about?"
appreciate it if you'd give him a chance. I mean, don't you just feel bad for him now that he has no friends?"
Fully clothed, I rounded on her.
I wasn't complaining, honestly. This particular school year was about to be the worst yet for me, if she hadn't nudged Harry in my direction. I wanted to thank her.
"Me too," Draco sighed as he sat up in bed. I paused on my way to the shower, glancing behind me with a quirked eyebrow.
Toward the end of this note, Harry's hand slowed.
I sighed and pulled out the vacant seat next to me. Half of me wanted to laugh at how awkward he was, but I was too curious to give him shit for it.
"I know." With a grimace, I forced as much of the pink fluid down my throat as I could manage. I was beginning to feel quite light, and my inhibitions lowered significantly. "We should get to bed soon."
"Look. I… Might be insecure about how my friends see me, and treat me, but insecure about your exes?" A confident grin stretched my lips. "Never."
I actually took a fair amount of notes that class. Around the middle, though, I found myself staring down at my hand.
"What happened?" She spun to ask me, arms crossed, as soon as we were out of earshot of anyone else.
“Right. It’s also just as important that you know what exactly has been introduced into the body, to properly counteract it.” As I continued on my explanation of which herbs were most effective in which kinds of antidotes, I felt Draco’s hand surreptitiously rest on my lower back. This contact seemed to suck my irritation out of me, just like the antidotes we were describing. My tense shoulders relaxed and the words coming from my mouth sounded less and less harsh by the minute. Somehow, we were able to sum up everything we’d painstakingly researched by the time our five minutes were up.
With still-waking limbs, I ambled out of bed and to his bathroom mirror. Shock stained my features in my reflection as my eyes lighted on a small, red welt that had formed on the side of my neck.
"No, but…" As we stepped onto the docks and started up the stairs toward the Great Hall, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. "It's eerie how quiet it is."
“Is this the House you

"Er… You look for it." He hastily handed the telescope over to me, and I obliged.
I continued with renewed force, but still reminding myself not to be
We sat in companionable silence for a while, just picking up where we'd left off and jotting down page numbers. At one point, though, I happened to glance up to catch Harry staring at me, a grin playing on his lips. I flushed and studiously ignored him. He tried to hide a chuckle with a cough before suddenly standing.
"Did you… Hijack my
My laughter was submerged in another groan as I settled into him. Suddenly, an idea crossed my mind. Harry’s lingering Legillimency must’ve picked up on it, because his grimace was replaced with a look of shock.
The ascent into the Astronomy tower was easier this time, with Harry's hand already firmly in mine, but a small ball of anxiety was still squirming in my stomach when we reached the top. I had never felt so out of place, like I didn't belong there. Knowing Harry had been watching the whole time made it that much harder.
His answering pout was so damn adorable, I leaned down to kiss him. I'd already tested his limits once, but I just couldn't help myself. My fingers wrapped around the edges of his shirt and lifted. When his arms raised to allow me to strip it off him, I took it as a green light and immediately reconnected our lips. The pressure of my kiss forced him back on my bed, and I was straddling him within moments.
I snorted quietly.
"Will you?" He asked without looking at me. I frowned.
"Night."
This thought sobered me. It was honestly frightening how quickly I stopped being able to imagine my life without him in it, but even more frightening was the thought of losing him.
to be me. Of course, I'd suffered the most at his hand, so it wouldn't make a difference if, say, Ginny accepted him. AND, on top of that, I was in a leadership role to my peers ever since the DA days. I groaned internally at the notion that I'd forever have the label
"Ah. The snitch."
"It'll be alright," I proposed. Not that I had any way of knowing. I'd heard the whispers last time, after all…
“Er… D’you think you could untie me now?”
"Or I can come to Slytherin's. Think anyone would have a problem with that?"
"Typical Gryffindor arrogance! Think the other teams wouldn't stand a chance just because you're on Gryffindor's?" Draco teased, and I rolled my eyes.
'Why do I think that? Or why is she so invested?'
monster, after all. His muscles tightened in response, and I held still until they relaxed, continuing my oral ministrations. His leg twitched as I experimentally pressed upward. Encouraged by his gasp, I slid a second finger in. His back arched slightly, and I forced my lips down to his base.
Once we reached the Great Hall, my steps fell short, and Harry noticed.
He laughed, and his laughter seemed to escalate until it infected me.
Draco was very tense. I could almost see the hairs at the base of his neck standing on end, when I realized I'd been staring. My gaze instantly dropped to my notes. I knew how prickly it felt to be stared at from behind.
He held my arm up between us, and I grimaced.
I whipped my face up, ready to make some biting comment back to Potter's stupid, pitying face, but saw no pity in his eyes. Instead, there was a kind of understanding that made my toes curl.
"God, I could tell you some stories." Finally relaxing a bit, I curled back into him.
"I' thay you alreathy hab," his tongue and lips moved around my ear as his teeth gently bit down. Another tremble coursed through me.
"You…" My mouth opened and closed as I tried to form the words to accurately describe just how unfair that was. "You…"
could you?"
"Wait, you haven't?" I lifted my head to look at him.
made my limbs feel like jelly, but I couldn't not lean up and kiss him. It was with this movement of my body against his that I remembered we were both naked. A flush stole into my cheeks as I propped myself up on my elbow suddenly. Draco chuckled at my expression. "You keep that blush up long enough,
"Unbelievable," I teased him as he wrapped his arms back around me. Turning the telescope skywards, I held it to my eye and aimed it at the first star I could find. "Wow."
“Guess I just got a fantastic night’s sleep.”
He laughed without mirth, and I shook my head.
my father in Azkaban, and the one who defeated my would-be Lord was
piece of shit
The other shoe finally dropped. Draco was actually somewhat relieved as his knees hit the hard stone floor and he scuffed his left palm. The snickering group of Slytherins that had pushed past him were disappearing through the doors as he slowly started pulling the contents of his book bag into his arms. What he didn't expect, though, was another set of hands helping him.

His smirk changed to a grimace.
. "It was… Amazing." More heat in my face. "But why do
We grinned at each other before Finnegan cut in.
As I moved down his collarbone, I made sure to kiss every scar I'd left on him as tenderly as I dared. Without even thinking about it, I briefly lowered my ear to his chest. His racing heart thudded loud in my ear, and I grinned before resuming down his torso. Once I reached his navel, a fine, silver fuzz greeted my lips, and panic surged through me.
"Draco?"
who my father is?" One of them asked accusatorially.
"I don't know what happened. I just passed out thinking about you, and I think maybe I subconsciously sought you out with Legillimency… In my sleep…"
I chuckled.
"That good, eh?"
'I don't know how to answer that.'
"Why? Wh-what do you think of me?"
I made to push around him to try to fix his light, but he stopped me, and I landed back on the desk with a hiss.
"What did they say?" He swallowed.
"Morning." My voice sounded strange to myself, and I cleared my throat.
"I… Ran into her on my… Walk of shame…" The scenario my imagination conjured was nothing short of comedic, but I waited silently for him to continue. "She's…
"Essentially, I guess..."
'What? Seriously?'
"Well, I was gonna visit Hagrid, but that'll probably be later this afternoon. This morning, I have some questions I need answered, and I… Think I might know where to look."
"Hm?" He asked, still unmoving himself.
"I still haven't gotten over the fact that you
When our kiss finally ended, we were both hot in the cheeks. With his lower lip pulled between his teeth and an indulgent smile pulling at the corners of his mouth, he backed away to sit on his bed again.
"Like I said, madder things've happened," Ron commented around his own mouthful.
A sheepish grin crept into my features, but I took comfort from the fact that he couldn't see it anymore.
"How the hell did you manage to make a mess of it within the first week back?"
I remembered the exact moment Harry must've been talking about. I'd been considering - indeed, with great pleasure - the companionable activity we'd found ourselves doing. How simple a thing it was, working on a school project together, but for some reason it made me immensely happy. And when I'd glanced up to catch him staring at me, there was this look of rapt fascination on his face. I flushed with pleasure, again, as I glanced up at Harry's smiling face.

Rage bubbled in his chest. His footfalls slapped more rapidly as the notion of being
Harry waited patiently for me as I went to my bathroom to splash some cold water on my face. My eyes were still bloodshot, but the redness of my nose was dissipating, thankfully. With a grimace, I gathered my bookbag and laced my fingers through Harry’s. I’d decided to keep my eyes downcast as we walked so no one would see the rawness there. I thought to comment on how he’d somehow reached his Legillimens all the way across campus, but realized I’d have to stop being surprised by his magical aptitude sooner or later.
"I'm… So sorry, Draco…"
"Pff, definitely something else."
"Malfoy?
Interested
His answering flushed grin said enough, but he replied nonetheless.
"It's not
, a mere moment more before I couldn't stand anymore. Tearing my fingers from his mouth, I replaced them with a crushing kiss. Harry was flattened back onto the bed with the force, and my hands fisted in his hair.
My cheeks flamed as I bit back a grin.
'JUST because you saved the world? No. Sure helps, though.'
