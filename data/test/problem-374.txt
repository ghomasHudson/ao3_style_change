'I can't discuss an ongoing investigation with you,' he said. Malfoy opened his mouth to object, so Harry continued speaking. 'But I did ask you to come in today to canvas ideas about why you think the attack might have occurred. We have a strong suspicion that the Pureblood Society was deliberately targeted and that the attacker had been planning his activities for some time.'
Draco has spent about four hundred thousand Galleons, and has taken some of the most coveted items. More and more glances are turning to him and there is anger in the clench of fists and the hardening of eyes.
'What do you mean you thought Malfoy picked Scorpius up?' he asked, turning to Parkinson's parents.
The man nodded and a minute later he had three shots of Firewhisky in front of him. He handed over his Gringotts token for the start of a tab and then downed the shots, one after the other, blowing the smoke up into the air as he turned to look over the heaving dancefloor.
Hermione was left looking at Harry, amused fondness on her face.
He looked around the familiar space, hearing the shower in the adjoining bathroom, then stepped over to her bed, tugging the covers flatter before laying back onto it, staring up at the pale silk canopy. It was the same one she'd had as a girl. Pansy didn't live here all the time, but she tended to be around on the days Scorpius was staying. She had a townhouse she kept, mostly for entertaining and impressing people, Draco suspected. And for fucking.
'Welcome, Harry,' she said, reaching out her hand as she approached him. 'I'm Jayne Turner. Thank you for coming.'
'Calm down, Potter,' he said. 'It's just a ham and cheese toastie.' But his cheeks were slightly pink and Harry could tell Draco was pleased he was enjoying it.
'It is?' he asked. 'Why... why would how you feel about me influence the weather?'
'On the bed,' Draco said. Harry turned immediately, feeling the ropes bite into his skin as he bent his leg, leaning forward to climb onto the bed.
would, would they? What are you doing here? Since when do you work private security?' The disdain is back in his voice, full force. He looks Harry up and down. 'Are you here by choice? What the fuck made you quit the Ministry to take a dodgy job in a shitshow organisation like this?'
Draco turned his head, awareness rushing through him. He'd left Scorpius in his room with barely a reason why and shielded the door. He rushed down the hall, opening the door and Scorpius tumbled out onto his legs. Draco knelt and Scorpius wrapped thin arms around his neck.
Draco looped the rope around Harry's stomach, stepping forward so their chests were pressed together as he pulled the rope around to Harry's back and then down between his legs. Harry could feel the strands slip between the cheeks of his arse, rubbing against his hole, the friction cool and smooth. At the same time, Draco pressed forward, grinding himself against Harry's hard cock.
Harry takes up his slow grind again. He thinks about what he wants. Thinks about saying it. Thinks about Draco beneath him, writhing under him, clearly lost in what they're doing. He closes his eyes and speaks again, feeling the wolf howl with approval within him.
'Fuck Harry Potter!' he shouted. 'I don't want to be him.'
They fell into an easy routine over the next few days. They would work in Harry's office together in the mornings, do a lap of the building, checking Magical Reversal and the ASS, and then stay up on the roof for lunch together until Malfoy headed off to do more research in the archives or catch up with whatever he'd missed in the Floo Authority - though if the spells he had for duplication reports were any indication, that only took him a few minutes each day.
Harry nodded, knowing he would try … knowing he probably wouldn’t succeed.
He slipped a hand inside the neck of his t-shirt and let his fingertips rest over the tattoo on his chest. He could feel it moving, the lightest of touches against the pads of his fingers. He didn't need to look at it to know its movements intimately.
Draco's eyes widen slightly with surprise before Harry barrels into him, knocking him to the side as he reaches for the hand holding the blade. His momentum carries him and the assassin backwards and Harry uses the movement of his swing to keep the knife going, plunging it directly into the guts of the assassin as he hits the wall.
'You're a pebble in the pond,' Conor said, as though that was any more enlightening.
'Uxbridge,' Malfoy says, that single word leaving him none the wiser. Harry feels frustration curl in him. Malfoy is so damned
Blake frowned, but didn't push him, instead they glanced across the room and raised their arm, gesturing to someone who had just walked in. Harry turned to see a tall, well-built man making his way towards them. He was dressed in cargo pants and a tight black t-shirt and his blond hair was cropped close to his head. Something about the way he walked made Harry think of the Muggle military. He wondered if he was MACUSA.
The mare faded away, the echo of Ginny's voice going with it.
His mum laughed. 'You know we're only over once a fortnight. He misses them. They remind him of you when you were a boy.'
'A pleasure, Mr. Malfoy,' she said. She hesitated, looking towards the closed door to the Head Auror's office and then down at the flowers in her hand. Then she leaned across her desk towards him, speaking in a low voice.
'How did you learn to drive? Whose face are you wearing? Is this your car? Do you just have them stashed all over the city?' Harry knows he's babbling, but he can't seem to get his head around the fact that this is Malfoy next to him, wearing someone else's identity and competently directing this Muggle car through Muggle traffic as though he's done it a million times before.
He looked at her letter for a long time before he conjured a ball of blue flame, hovering in place above his ashtray.
He realises Malfoy is taking him in too, when the silence stretches too long between them.
'Why did you decide to accept a Loyalty Bond from me?' he asks, holding a thick silver chain in his hand.
They ran side by side down the driveway until they exited the gates and Malfoy Disapparated, Harry following him a moment later. He reappeared in front of the large wrought-iron gates of Malfoy Manor. Malfoy immediately strode forward but within three steps, the same warning glow Harry had experienced on his visit flared to life. An instant later Malfoy cried out in pain and stepped swiftly back.
He turns to the cupboard, tracking the sound of Malfoy's movements behind him as he crosses the room to retrieve his wand. When no immediate crack of Apparition follows, Harry relaxes slightly.
Hermione leaned back in her seat, that strange mix of excitement and concern on her face.
He doesn't stop to consider whether this is a good idea. Whether the wolf wants it, or the bracelet, or whether this is something he wants. He can't. Feeling is what he needs, not thinking. Just forgetting and letting his mind go still for a moment. Malfoy owes him that, doesn't he? All of this is his fault, in one way or another.
If he'd had to, he wouldn't have been able to take his gaze off the tall, slim form of Draco Malfoy as he issued orders in that tone that brooked no argument.
Now that they were here, Harry looked as if he wasn't quite sure what to say.
'Since when do you have a Firebolt?' he asked.
'Mr. Potter-'
There's a tense silence between them. Harry almost doesn't want to break it. Let the clock tick down to zero for all he cares, but there are things he wants to know, and this might be the perfect opportunity to get those answers.
'Draco?' he called anyway, unable to help himself, spinning around in the darkness.
Harry tried to interrupt but Draco held up a hand. 'I lied to you and abused your trust in the worst way,' Draco said, continuing to speak quietly but firmly, as he rubbed comforting circles on Scorpius' back. 'And you cut me out of your life completely, and then had me arrested and interrogated without cause.'
'Are you ready to start?' he asked.
'Yes,' Pansy agreed bluntly. 'You have. I really don’t think getting involved with Harry Potter - childhood nemesis, long time crush, Saviour of the Wizarding World and Head of the fucking
in his eyes, but he couldn't quite make it out.
'Seriously though,' Ron said, putting his chopsticks down. 'Do you think he's involved? I know I said Robards wasn't interested in him for investigation but the damage tally is pretty grim. They had half a dozen hospitalisations from the heatwave and the repairs bill from the monsoon is up to half a million Galleons, last I heard. Turns out the worst damage is resistant to repair spells. They're having to bring specialists in.'
'What did she say?' Malfoy asked curiously, seemingly unfazed as Pheo slid inside his shirt. Harry forced himself not to redden as he scrambled for something to say. 'She - ah - she looks forward to the food,' Harry said, taking a cue from his own words and reaching for one of the sandwiches sitting between them.
'I want to see them again,' he said, letting desperation bleed into his tone. He didn’t stop to analyse how he felt about letting Malfoy see this side of him - this vulnerability. It wasn't real anyway. Not really. 'Please,' he said, reaching out, then letting his hand drop just before touching Malfoy. Malfoy's eyes flicked down for a moment and Harry read surprise. He felt a stab of satisfaction. 'Just one more time. I can pay.'
Harry stopped by the canteen on his way back from a team briefing and picked up two roast beef and salad sandwiches and a coffee for each of them.
' Harry said, nothing about her statement making sense to him.
'Your Aurors herd me into the East wing like an animal and set my cage around me.'
She turned to face them, leaning against the counter and bringing her mug up to her lips, blowing lightly as she arched an eyebrow at them both.
found the memory very funny. 'No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't catch it.'
'I didn't want to give you any reason to get handsy again,' he says as he climbs into bed. Harry notices that he takes the side furthest from the wall. He wants to be able to make a quick escape if he can. It's this thought that stops Harry from teasing him further.
His memory was hazy, disjointed, as though his thoughts hadn't been completely his own. It reinforced the conclusion he'd come to in the square, immediately after he'd thrown the killing curse, that something had been influencing him.
'Do you agree to be dosed with Veritaserum?' he asked Draco immediately. Draco's hands jerked into a quick fist before he forced himself to relax.
Suddenly there was light everywhere, a riot of movement and flickering colour. Flashes of familiar faces and places unspooled around him, almost too quickly to focus on. He saw Hogwarts. Work. The Burrow. Grimmauld. Privet Drive. Small and dark - his cupboard. Ron. Ginny. Molly. Teddy. Hermione. Vernon's face, red with rage. They moved faster and faster around him. Snatches of sound and garbled half-words bursting into life.
Harry ignores him, hurrying towards the door. Teddy is out there, and he needs him.
Kingsley turns to Robards, cautioning him, and Ron looks between Harry and Draco, before huffing out a sigh.
The group moved in a more or less orderly fashion out the front doors and onto the street, where they milled around in front of a large double-decker bus. Harry eyed it, wondering if it had any magical relationship to the Knight Bus, but it seemed to be perfectly Muggle. He could see many of the parents wondering the same thing, as they climbed aboard and nothing moved or shifted around them.
'What?' Harry says, unable to follow the way Malfoy is several steps in front of him with the conversation.
'Eyes open,' Draco said. 'No blindfold for this.' His lips quirked into a smile. 'I don't have to hide from you anymore.'
'Potter,' the tone is warning now. Wolf ignores it. 'Don't make me stun you.'
They walk together into the living room and Hermione looks up with a smile, nudging Rose, whose face lights up as she sees him. She jumps off the couch, running towards him and yelling, 'Uncle Harry!'
'It was a long time ago,' Draco said, his hands dropping to his belt in a clear signal that the conversation was over. Harry's eyes dropped with them and Draco smirked at the response.
The thought makes him feel sick so he ignores the questions and busies himself with the teabags. He decides he's going to pretend none of it happened and let Malfoy make what he will of that.
Wolf's rumble changes to pleasure and he rubs himself in earnest against the body in front of him.
his. That's just the magic and the moon and his stupid, fucking instincts getting all tangled up.
Harry turned to Draco, and Draco was concerned to see the fatigue suddenly etched across every line of Harry's body. He realised, abruptly just what Harry had done tonight. Both breaking through the wards and bringing him back - he'd been
Malfoy shakes his head. 'That could take all week. I have other avenues to pursue as well. There's more than one way to skin a dragon.'
War was inside him. Harry reminded himself of that. Malfoy looked normal, but that didn't mean anything. He brought the image of the Seal to his mind as he prepared to cast, touching the newly tattooed design running down the centre of his chest, from his collarbone to his navel. The Seal of Scattering was second from the top and Harry felt it warm under his fingertips as he called on it.
'You've got to be joking,' he says, voice flat and hard.
Draco took one look at the four red-robed figures surrounding him, their faces hard, then he raised his hands slowly, looking back over his shoulder to see with relief that he was out of sight of the kitchen where he'd left Scorpius having his dinner.
Hermione nudged him gently and Harry realised he'd been staring. He pulled his attention back to the game and tried to think about who he'd be okay with kissing … and what sort of kiss he'd be okay having. The thoughts got too complicated so he resolved to sit back and see what happened.
'I'm going to ride you, Harry,' Draco said. 'Your only job is to make sure you don't come until I have. Can you do that?'
'Easy for you to say,' Draco huffs, reaching behind himself to pluck at Harry's ripped jeans and fitted black v-neck t-shirt. 'You looked like you just rolled out of a skip bin.'
had changed, but not in a way he could reveal to the woman in front of him.
He can hear a warm babble of voices as he walks across the grass and he focuses on them, picking out individual ones and feeling his anger slip further away. George is here, of course. His voice had taken on a more subdued tone after the War and had never gone back to its former exuberance. He can hear Fleur singing quietly to herself and Molly telling Arthur off about something or other. As he steps closer he makes out Hermione's soft voice as she reads to Rose.
'Ah,' Malfoy says, still conversationally. 'I wonder how many he carried his rape threats out on, before he was finally outed and given what he deserves.'
, the wolf rumbles,
'Oook,' said the Librarian, the tone clearly judgmental, as it put the books and scrolls it had gathered in a pile on the desk. Then it swung down to the ground and disappeared into the stacks without a backwards glance.
Harry rolls so he's facing Malfoy, a body-width of distance between him. The bed still smells like the two of them, despite the fact that Malfoy has cast Freshening Charms on it. Harry breathes in the scent while he waits to see if Malfoy will turn to face him. He doesn't and after a long moment, Harry speaks into the darkness.
them? He shied automatically from that thought. Malfoy was many things, but he wasn't a killer. Was he? Harry thought back to sixth year; thought of Katie Bell. Thought of Ron, choking on the floor, foam coming from his mouth.
Harry feels his anger surge higher at that, laced with a sickening fear. Malfoy didn't know, did he? He couldn't. 'Me
He wouldn't cry. He fucking
Blake gave him a sceptical look but nodded.
'Good,' Draco smiled. 'When we're done, we're going to discuss what you just told me.' He rolled his eyes, 'And we're going to set some rules about what does and doesn't belong in a scene.'
It was a list of … of experiences, was the only way he could describe it. He looked at the main headings.
'I'm not fucking him!' Draco objected, ignoring the spark of desire that leapt through him at the thought. It had been so long since he'd been interested in anyone that way … not since Astoria had passed, and that had been three long years. The thought of her brought that same painful ache back, and he felt unaccountably guilty for even considering Potter in the same light.
Draco's eyes were pleading as he spoke.
Harry saw Malfoy's head turn as he regarded each of the children in turn. All the bravado had gone from them as they stood before him, looking scared and uncertain. Harry felt something swell inside his chest as he watched Malfoy's handling of the situation. It felt like pride, or respect. It clashed with the anger and the betrayal that churned inside him still at the sight of Malfoy in front of him.
, his inner voice whispered.
Harry snorted, 'You're saying you found the dead Muggle equivalent of you and dressed as him?'
Harry looked at him curiously, the question that had been bugging him drifting back into his mind. 'Why do you take him there then?'
Draco liked it all, as it turned out. He especially liked it when Harry shifted forward and lined their cocks up, taking both in his hand and leaning over so he could kiss Draco again as they thrust against each other. Draco's hands were all over him and he was making a steady stream of noises and muttered words in between kisses. Harry caught 'Potter' and 'mine' and 'so good. Fuck so good.'
'Vanish it,' he says, breathing in the scent of Malfoy in the pillow. 'Bandage too.'
Then his eyes caught and held on faint silvery scars that crossed their way up Draco's chest.
Harry looked up, cocking his head at Cho. 'What time did the rain start? I was out in the field until after lunch'
Malfoy was standing in the doorway to the dream room, as Harry had taken to calling it in his head. His arms were crossed and the look on his face was forbidding.
Harry was frowning, but Draco could see he was considering it. He hoped Potter would say yes – badly wanted him to say yes, for more than just the campaign.
'I miss you so, so much.' The words were a wail, barely formed. Harry felt like he was tearing apart with them, unravelling and disappearing.
He was wearing slim-fitting dark jeans and chunky black boots that came up over his ankles. Instead of his normal collared shirt, he wore a tight, grey long-sleeved shirt that drew Harry's eyes to his chest. It was a lot more casual than Harry normally saw Draco looking and he like it. A lot.
Ladon looked up to meet Harry's eyes and waved his hand.
He turned away from the picture and let Scorpius tug his hand and lead him down the hall. There were two doors at the end of the passage. Scorpius turned into one, and Harry realised with a quick glance that the other was Malfoy's. In the light from the hall he caught a glimpse of pale blue sheets, cream and silver and a canopy that reminded him of his Hogwarts bed, then he turned away. He had no business looking at Malfoy's bedroom. He didn't know what had gotten into him. He looked down at the blond boy who was tugging him resolutely forward and reflected that he had no real understanding of how he'd gone from seeing Draco Malfoy's picture in an active case, to being in his house reading his son a bedtime story.
He cancelled his charms and cast a new set, these ones focussed on identifying every trace of organic matter in the room. He and Daniela both lit up like suns, but Harry was far more interested in the glow emanating from the hidden sides of almost every bone in the room.
Harry smiled at her and stood back up. He still felt like shit from the night before. But she was right, it had been too long since he'd spent time with them.
Harry felt his anger begin to stir, fighting through the rush of information he was seeing and hearing. Where did these people get off, judging him? He hadn't released the Horseman on purpose. No one had been there holding his hand and telling him what he should or shouldn't be doing. He'd done the best he bloody well could.
Ron's eyes move over Malfoy quickly and he smiles, reaching out his hand as he steps forward.
He let the music and the alcohol flowing through him direct his body as he moved and swayed in time with the masses of people around him. It wasn't long before he felt hands on his hips, strong and sure. He didn't open his eyes, he just tilted his head back and slowed his movement. He felt a hard body fit itself against his back and lips brush against his neck. He shivered, feeling arousal throb through him in time with the thump of the bass. For a moment, in his mind, those lips were Draco's and he felt the ghost of Draco's body against his, but he pushed the thought away, angrily.
Hermione's gaze sharpened. 'Desperate?' She pursed her lips, sitting on the edge of Harry's desk and pulling her fluffy scarf up higher around her ears. 'We're missing something. We need to figure out how this happened. How did he get linked to the weather spell? Why does it change? Does he change it on purpose?'
After all, most of them were nothing like Lupin had been, and there were so many of them after the war.
He doesn't know how much time has passed before he wakes again, but there's a voice calling to him, high and scared. He blinks awake in the darkness, trying to orient himself.
He glanced over the rest of the file quickly, not seeing anything else of interest, and then he tidied everything back up. He put the half-empty packet of biscuits in Jeffries' partner's drawer and left as quietly as he'd come. A quick stop by home to make his arrangements - Malfoy especially didn't need to know the latest information in his mind - and he was ready for the next part of the night.
He pulls back and does the same thing again and again. Draco's hands tighten in his hair until he's pulling and he forces Harry's mouth back to his neck, arching into his bite with a moan. Harry holds him so tight as he fucks up into him that he knows Draco's hips will be ringed with fingerprint bruises tomorrow. The thought of that, of Draco being marked up and filled up and
He was deep in thought when Draco said his name. Harry looked up, and Draco gestured him over. 'I want to show you something.'
How could he have been so wrong? His instincts never let him down like this. Harry felt something inside his chest clench. He just hoped no one paid for his mistakes with their lives. They needed to get this case solved and Malfoy was bound up in it, one way or another. Harry ignored Sue's question and the memories it had stirred.
,' the woman said, and then his translation charm kicked in and he could follow the rest. 'I am Daniela Musilová, the DeathKeeper of this site. Thank you for coming.'
He glanced at the by line, saw Rita Skeeter's name and groaned in frustration, shoving the paper away and feeling his headache throb. Despite their best intentions, the
All he can think is how close Davies had come to hurting Draco.
Harry sat for a long time, the level of the whisky dropping steadily as he got lost in the swirl of thoughts. When he reached for the bottle and found it empty, Harry looked around himself, blinking slowly. The bar was fuller now, and it was dark outside.
Draco nodded. 'I've warded it so bloody tight it may as well be the Manor. No one gets in and out without the inhabitants' express say so. And they know what’s going on. They won't let anyone near him.'
Malfoy snorts and shoves him again. Harry's back hits the wall and it takes everything he has to stop from grabbing Malfoy by the collar, spinning them around and shoving him into the wall instead. He can't deal with someone's attempt to dominate him this close to the change. The wolf won't have it and neither will he.
He's a beefy man, taller than Harry and a bit broader in the chest. Harry stops before the man can touch him.
'She does that for you, Harry,' Ginny spat. 'And you can't even be fucking bothered to show up.'
He turned to Harry, face furious. 'Is this your doing too?' he demanded.
Malfoy frowns, a look of annoyance on his face. 'I've worked with plenty of weres. They're not different from anyone else, bit rough around the edges, maybe, but capable of just as much good and just as much bad as the next person.' He glances back over his shoulder and sees Davies coming back towards them and his face hardens as he returns his gaze to Harry.
'Can I owl you?' he asked instead, not willing to let Draco leave without the hope of some form of contact.
'How long until moonrise?' Malfoy asks as he moves back over to the door, sitting beside Harry. His cheeks are faintly red, and Harry can tell he's embarrassed by what he'd just had to do. But then the words of Malfoy's question catch up with him and Harry jerks his head up.
all the time and there are so many secrets hidden inside him.
The next round took more casualties. Ron spun Padma and looked across the circle at her, before looking back at Hermione. He seemed to struggle with himself for a moment before he shook his head and leaned over to give Hermione a quick kiss. Harry heard him murmur good luck to her as he left the circle.
The twist of regret and the feeling that he had made a bad mistake flared again. Harry was reminded for a moment of Sirius, all those years ago. He was reminded of his actions then, jumping headfirst into something based on his emotions - a reaction that had, ultimately, gotten his godfather killed. The idea that Scorpius could have been put in danger because of Harry speared through him like a sword, taking his breath.
'Do you believe Muggles are dangerous to wizards?' Elders rephrased.
Now, in light of his sudden realisation, he wondered just what he had let himself in for.
'Perfect,' Harry said, abandoning his thoughts about just when Draco had started to develop control over the weather. Instead he reached out, pulling Draco on top of him and catching his mouth for a kiss.
When it was done, he cast a Scourgify over the skull at his feet and smiled grimly as the Bundimun attached to it crumbled into dust and fell away.
. He checked the news source. CNN. And then the scrolling by-line at the bottom of it.
Harry flushed and opened his mouth to respond, but at that moment Susan Johnson tapped him on the shoulder and gestured to the front of the room where the Muggle Relations woman was beginning to speak. Harry struggled, thrown by this unexpected revelation and somehow wanting to know more.
'You missed mum's birthday,' Ginny said, voice tightly controlled as she continued to watch the flickering picture.
Harry crushed the voice down, forcing it to shut up. That Draco wasn't fucking
Draco was in on time, like he had been all of the week before.
'It looks exactly like the Preservation symbol,' Harry said, not convinced in the slightest.
Harry just smirked up at him, mouth around his cock, green eyes flashing and Draco felt a jolt of something more than lust flow through him. This was Harry. Harry was in his bed. Harry was swallowing him down. Wearing his collar. Looking at him like he was the only one in the world.
Harry slumped down onto the couch, pulling the thick knitted blanket around him. It had been a present from Molly. He was pretty sure it had been supposed to adorn his and Ginny's wedding bed. Whatever. It was warm. He scooped the remote out from under one of the cushions and flicked the telly on, then the Playstation, finding his controller underneath a shirt that smelled like it should have been washed a few weeks ago. He threw it towards the door and booted Crash Bandicoot up. If he had to be awake, he may as well do something useful with his time. He'd been stuck on a level full of shitty sideways jumps all week.
Draco swallows and takes a sip of coffee before he speaks. 'What now, what?' he asks, gesturing between Harry and himself. It's a clear question about whether Harry wants to discuss where they stand after the night before.
He'd watched Draco smoothly move around Murphy's questions, seemingly answering them in full but always two steps ahead. A part of Harry was impressed by the deftness with which Malfoy handled the questions, revealing exactly what he wanted to, and no more.
He ducked behind her partition and rifled through the papers on her desk, finding nothing. Then he pulled out her drawer, flicking through the folders one at a time until he found the one he was looking for. Harry glanced around again before he laid the folder on the desk, duplicating its contents quickly, before shrinking the pages down and slipping them into his pocket.
'Dahlia isn't Pansy, is she?' Harry asked as they walked, thinking about the similarities between the two women.
Hermione
came a cold, insidious voice in his mind.
Harry opened the lid and his eyes widened as he sucked in a breath.
Draco shrugged. 'That crazy old woman was back. Remember the one I told you about? Bagshot?'
Malfoy is silent, his eyes dark as he watches Harry.
He forced in another deep, shaking breath and pulled his mind back under his control. He let tendrils of his magic seep out of him as he breathed out, feeling his way around the wards. He knew the place he needed to focus on would be in the crypts underground. What was on the surface was just the Muggle version of the site.
Harry wrapped his arms around his chest, trying to hold in the pain, as tears began to spill down his cheeks.
He'd been feeling so numb lately, unsettled, uncomfortable in his skin … especially in the three days since he'd seen Draco Malfoy. Especially since he'd been dreaming of the man nightly. Especially since Malfoy's memories sitting, untouched, in the safe in his office were calling to him almost constantly. Harry pushed those thoughts away with an angry shrug. Now was
Harry grimaced at the creature's name, remembering bite marks and so, so much blood. He shook his head again, trying to shake the image out of it. 'I don't know why I have to keep telling you all this. There was no gap in the wards. I do this shit for a living. I ward my own life every day. You think I would ever leave a gap that could put my baby in danger?'
'Fine,' Draco muttered. '
Harry looked between the boy and Teddy, the fact that they were related sinking in slowly. That must mean Malfoy was Teddy's-
'No,' he muttered. 'I just want to see my family again.'
Then Malfoy pulls lightly at the bottom of Harry's shirt. It's stuck to his skin again and the movement tugs at the makeshift bandage over his wound. Harry grits his teeth against the stab of pain.
'It's … I've never done this before,' he said softly, almost shyly. 'I - I don't want it to be a lie.'
Pansy kicked his foot from where she sat in the chair across from him and Draco started, wrenching himself out of his memories.
'Professional Quidditch,' Malfoy drawled, 'how original.'
As Malfoy tucked his wand away, Harry picked a folder up off the pile and his eyes widened in amazement.
Hermione hummed noncommittally and returned her attention to the telly. Pheo chose that moment to poke her head out of Harry's shirt.
They kiss and move against each other and Harry feels Draco harden against him. He slips a hand between them, gripping Draco's cock and letting him slowly fuck up into his hand. Draco groans into his mouth and runs his hands up Harry's back, kneading at the muscles as he does. He pushes his fingers through Harry's hair, tugging lightly. Harry feels his wolf rolling with delight at the touch and he smiles into Draco's kiss.
They were having a rally. The
Harry couldn't take his eyes away from the sight. He felt a pang to know he had missed this, the other times they were together.
he begins.
'We arrested him yesterday. Inside is just the evidence team.'
Potter urged him closer, leaning in and pressing his lips against Draco's. Draco breathed in sharply at the warmth of Potter's mouth, the hint of moisture as Potter parted his lips, the sharp taste of the drink, the moan Potter gave as Draco tentatively kissed him back.
Harry was sitting in his office, glass of whisky in hand, and staring out at the tangle of the garden in the gathering darkness when he received the Patronus. The familiar silver mare galloped into the room, pulling up short before him.
He hefts the strap of his canvas rucksack up on his shoulder and walks across the road.
Harry felt that same magnetic pull to Draco, his attraction enhanced, rather than diminished by the danger Draco posed. A thought came to him - something Hermione had said about the link between Draco's moods and Harry's actions. He raised his hands, slowly, to the neck of his oilskin and then he undid the top button. The storm continued to roar around them. Harry slipped the next button out of its hole and then the next.
Harry watched her, slightly stunned at the speed at which she was speaking. Her words were almost merging into each other in a continuous stream. She seemed not to have noticed him and Luna at all. Instead, her eyes were inching sideways, back to the endlessly scrolling images, and Harry could see her fingers twitching, as though she needed to be touching her keys again, manipulating the stories she was seeing.
Javier's eyes widened and his arms uncrossed slightly as he leaned forward.
Ginny gave him a small smile. 'That sounds good. Thank you. I was thinking of going tomorrow. Christmas is Monday and, well … we can't pretend through that.'
Potter grunted noncommittally and Draco took that as a no. He thought about asking after Molly, but discarded the thought a moment later. He'd read something in the papers about a falling out in the family, but the details had been scarce. There would be too much grief associated with that connection, if that was the case. He thought back over the memories he'd had access to, feeling frustration at the gaps in them.
Harry handed him a completed report and Malfoy skimmed his eyes down it, before he grinned.
Harry could feel his own arousal building and he tried to hold it off. He wanted Draco to get there first. He wanted to see him come undone, see him totally open himself up. Everything about him was intoxicating as he got lost in what they were doing. Harry moved his fist faster, gritting his teeth against his need to come, but then Draco stiffened against him, crying out and Harry felt the hot splash of his release against his skin. The thought of it - Draco marking him that way - and the sight of him, head thrown back and face transformed by pleasure, tipped Harry over the edge. He felt his own orgasm hit and he cried out as he slowed his movements, spending himself over Draco's stomach.
'We need to scout these sites,' Malfoy says, making a neat list of them as he runs a hand through his dishevelled hair. His face is flushed slightly from the drink, but there's not a hint of unsteadiness in his actions. He moves as though he's been reinvigorated, animated by the scent of the chase laid out before them.
He thought about how he'd felt after the war and how he didn’t trust the wizarding world to give him any type of peace. He'd wondered if that was the reason he'd become an Auror, even though dealing with trauma and pain on a daily basis was the last thing he needed.
He'd been here since nightmares had ripped him out of his fitful sleep hours before. The sound of James crying—crying and crying with nobody coming—still echoed in his mind. He'd had this foggy idea that maybe, if he looked hard enough, he could will James' wide brown eyes to be looking back up at him.
'Alright, everyone. We've just arrived at Borough Market. Remember what we talked about - no magic and stay together, please. It's a busy place, and while we have tracking charms on all of you, it would be best if we stayed within eyesight of each other. You all have some Muggle money on you, yes?' She looked around at the various nods, some more certain than others.
In the distance he could see the reporters, quills waving madly, cameras flashing. He gave them the finger and turned back to Ron, shoulders slumping as the last of the anger left him suddenly, leaving only the empty hole where James should live.
'Why?' Malfoy asks, the challenge clear in his tone.
'My son, Draco, visits me,' he said.
Harry thought back. It had only been a few months. So much had changed in that time.
They poured from the box, a streaming flash of golden movement. Harry watched them take to the air, feeling happiness flow through him, then he kicked off the ground and joined Draco in circling above them. It took the flock a minute or two to get their bearings and then they were off, cutting for the trees in one synchronised streak. Harry laughed as he saw Draco change directions immediately, heading them off with ease. The flock reacted like they would to the appearance of any large predator and immediately flew back in the opposite direction, every single bird changing direction mid-air with simultaneous ease. Harry let them fly until they were almost at the trees at the other end and then he shot down in front of them, diverting them again. The two went back and forth for half-an-hour, racing past each other so close they could almost touch. Draco hadn't lost any of his skills from school and the sight of his easy command of his broom sent Harry's heart racing.
He wrote to Hermione first, giving her the details of his therapy. Her reflections on his thoughts and experiences helped to spur him into deeper connections, and to an understanding of himself that he didn't think he'd ever had.
The kiss was soft and slow, and Harry was lost in the feeling of Draco's mouth against his, the glide of his tongue as he licked at Harry's lips, and the soft moan he made as Harry granted him entrance. Draco's hand gripped lightly at his hip and Harry felt them spin slowly in the air as they shifted, moving closer together. He tilted his head, deepening the kiss and feeling arousal flare in him as Draco moaned again.
He lifted himself onto his knees, and it was only as he reached behind himself and grabbed Draco's cock with the same slippery fist that Draco understood what was happening. He tensed and Harry hushed him.
'You give good pats,' Harry says, feeling his eyelids get heavy again.
She stood and left the kitchen. Harry gulped down his tea and then stood and paced as he waited. Just when he was about to go after her, and see what was taking her so long, she came back with a small bag slung over her shoulder.
'Is that what you do?' Harry asked, latching on to anything to change the subject. It was something he'd been wondering for a while - was it just Ladon's name that was fictional, or had he created an entirely new person? 'Polyjuice?'
dragged the letters closer. He sifted through them before putting the three that addressed him as James at the top of the pile. He drew a knife from his belt, slipping it under the seal of each to break it and then scanned their contents quickly.
He sighed and shook his head to clear it. Then he came back to his original thought, to the idea that Ginny had left, while he'd stayed here. 'We didn't - we haven't talked about the house. You shouldn't have to be the one to leave. It's our house, together. If you want, we can figure out some -'
'Your kid's alive,' Harry said, feeling the pain spiral back into his body. He would give anything to be able to say that himself. He could hear it in his own voice. The grief. The desperation. 'What more do you fucking want?'
'Just as easy as a Muggle climbing into a van and driving it into a bus full of wizards?' Elders asked, face shrewd.
I'd love to know what you're thinking now, or what stood out to you, or just anything really.
'You wish,' he said, and he closed his eyes.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and spoke more slowly, enunciating every word.
She reached out, laying a hand on his arm. 'You should try to rest. Based on the last time you depleted your magic, the Healers weren't expecting you to wake until late today.'
'And we have passed the following sentence: For the crime of Malicious intent to cause grievous bodily harm, we pronounce you guilty.'
He thought of these things. Filled his mind with them. The wonder in his heart as he looked into his son's face. The empathy he'd felt for Draco, cut off from his own child. The family he knew waited for him, no matter how many times he'd turned them away. He remembered his parents' glowing forms. Sirius, and the life they could have had together.
Draco moaned and thrust again into his clenched fist. His other hand shadowed Charlie's, clenching onto the memory of Harry's hair, causing the arch in his back and the desperation in his eyes to deepen as he pushed into Draco's thrusting cock.
Blaise's low voice murmured in his ear, 'Come on now. Let's sit down.'
He almost missed the Chief Warlock's next words: 'Avery cannot be extradited based on the evidence supplied. A suspicion someone may be involved in a case is not strong enough for an international order, which you well know, Mr. Potter. You have leave to send a team to interview him in France, but no more, unless new evidence is found that links him to the case.'
'Nick,' Harry says, reaching across a hand as they walk. 'Nice to meet you.'
Harry barely refrained from poking out his tongue. 'Shove off, Malfoy. Some of us have more interesting things to do than paperwork.'
, and now here's Malfoy, out of nowhere after all these years. And his hand is on his wand.
Marchbanks sat and there was a rustle of clothing as everyone around her sat as well.
'Drink?' Draco asked, wanting to put him at ease, and needing something to occupy himself with. His heartbeat was pounding in his ears.
kill the host, but only after you've applied the seal. If you trap the Horseman inside the body and kill the body, you'll stop its ability to re-form. You'll take it out of play for the rest of the cycle.' Their face had a vicious satisfaction as they said that.
Draco shook his head. 'Tired. Floaty,' he said, and gave Harry a smile, pulling him forward into another sloppy kiss. Harry groaned and his hands moved over Draco's body, running over the raised bumps left by the suckers, which covered every part of him.
want to ride Potter's motorcycle,' Draco said, glaring at her.
'And you must be Scorpius,' Hermione said, smiling down at the boy who had moved around his dad to be on the same side Harry was.
Draco didn't bother to try and understand it. He latched onto his father's false assurances that he would be safe. If not for Harry, he would be dead.
'You too,' he said, and he knew that he meant it. Ginny didn't deserve any of this. Ginny shouldn't be the one to lose everyone over and over again. That was his job, after all. It was why he was made.
Harry grunted, leaning back in his seat. 'There'd be strings attached. The likes of that lot don't offer a cup of tea if they're not getting something in return.'
'Where are we?' he asks, turning his attention back to Draco.
Harry shook his head immediately. 'No,' he said, and his tone was almost pleading. 'No, that's done. We agreed. It's over.'
That was why this had to stop. Harry had chosen to give up his power … but not to give it up to Draco. May never choose to do so, if they did, somehow end up together. Harry had not consented, ever, to Draco having this control over him. And that was why it had to end. Why Draco had to tell him the truth. But first, he would let him fall, one more, perfect time.
Harry clenched his fist slightly and Avery's words cut off, seemingly as his air cut off.
Harry looked around, and then up, whirling into an Apparition that took him to the roof of a skyscraper nearby. Once up there, he didn't look down at the violence below. He could still hear it faintly. The sound of explosions, sirens blaring, the crackle of flames. He didn't look for the Preservation symbol—the sign of Conquest—but he knew it would be out there.
Draco nodded his agreement, giving his own pleased smile and they introduced the boys.
While Harry tries to figure out what the fuck he's going to do now, Draco figures out the final piece of the puzzle. They've both set aside things that seem slightly off, words that don't make sense in the context of the paperwork, transport routes that have extra stops once or twice a year, buyers that appear just as infrequently. But it's Draco who weaves the lot of it into the bigger picture.
'Can we go see them?' Harry asks.
'I could stop?' Malfoy offered quietly.
'It got him kicked out of his job in a Muggle bar. Public safety risk. It got him raids on his apartment, day and night, in case he was having some fucking bestiality orgy in there or something, I don't know. He was trying
Harry freezes, hand on the handle. He looks back over his shoulder at Draco, surprised by the question. Draco's gaze is frank, but Harry knows there's likely more to what he's asking. He turns around, taking a few slow steps back towards Draco, wary, but feeling like he owes him this, somehow. He remembers Draco's words, earlier, laying himself bare.
There had been an explosion. A flash of light and a roar of sound. Screams and heat and shattering glass. It had expanded out like a wave, unstoppable and deadly. He'd
'I don't know,' he said simply.
'You're a fucking piece of work, you know that?'
'Fuck, Charlie,' Potter moaned. 'Fingers, please.'
Ron opened his mouth as though he wanted to argue, but then he turned and stepped towards the Floo. His eyes were sad as he looked over his shoulder at Harry before he disappeared.
'Harry,' she said, pushing his hands away. 'It took me like an hour to get into this thing. I'm not taking it off again.'
He saw more of Potter's walls go down at the sound. Potter closed his eyes, as though to better take it in. Draco wondered how much pain he was still carrying. Charlie must have meant a lot to him, to have hurt him so much.
. He'd have to pass it off as a joke. He'd be able to pass it off as a joke, wouldn't he?
Harry worked slowly and methodically, Felix letting him know he had all the time in the world. He rolled the man against the building and disillusioned his unconscious form. Then he transfigured Edgar's clothes into a reasonable imitation of what the other man had been wearing and withdrew a vial from his own pocket.
Harry nipped at his neck lightly, rubbing his cheek against the shaved undercut of Draco's hair as he breathed him in. Draco arched back into him for a moment and then pushed him away with a huff. 'Set the table, you animal. This is almost done.'
He walked to the bench and folded his shirt, placing it down. He hesitated, then took his glasses off, placing them on top. Then he turned back to Ladon, just catching the flick of the man's eyes over his body as they came up to meet his.
'But you'd like to, wouldn't you?' Ladon said, turning away from him to glide his hand over the back of the couch. 'You'd like to be laid back on this couch, the darkness hiding you from view, as you watch someone being taken to pieces.' He glanced back over his shoulder and his eyes were dark and hard. Harry felt a shiver run through him at the words. He wanted to protest, but as he opened his mouth, Ladon turned his gaze back to the stage. He clapped his hands and ropes unspooled from the metal grid hanging above the stage. They dropped into place, swaying softly. Harry found his gaze drawn to them.
Harry shook his head. 'No, that's – they sound like … good causes. I – ah – hundred thousand, you said?'
It's disconcerting. He wants to take the bracelet straight back off, to get away from that increased awareness. He forces himself not to move. He can cope. He's dealt with much worse. He'll just need to be aware of his reactions to Malfoy, and aware of how the Bond is warping them.
When he stepped out of the floo, he could hear a scream of laughter, followed by a chilling cackle of noise. Then more laughter and thudding footsteps. He looked up at the ceiling above him, feeling some of the tension leave his body at the sounds. He made his way slowly through the familiar house, feeling again that sense of comfort and warmth that seemed to fill the Parkinson House, large though it was. It was something he didn't know if he'd ever truly felt at the Manor. He let that thought go, determined not to dwell on the things that Aunt Burke had stirred to life.
They both rushed to him and he held them tight, then let them go with a smile.
Harry threw Sophia's letter aside, the gillyweed in his system helping him to let his frustration slip away. He looked down at the letters and picked up the last one, the one from Hermione.
'What makes you say that?' Harry asked, surprised by the words, he'd have thought it would be the opposite, with Malfoy.
'Why are you doing this?' Harry asked, the soft and warm feeling from the dream fading as his suspicions crept back in. It must be a trap of some sort. A trick. This was
Granger crossed her arms, considering him a moment longer before she said, 'You're Samael Ladon, aren't you?'
It was like being ripped through a series of Pensieve memories more quickly than he could focus.
(See the end of the chapter for
'Anyone ever done this for you?' He pushed his tongue inside Harry, just the tip, and Harry groaned again.
Away from the heady promise of the Club, surrounded by the suspicions of the Auror Department, Harry found himself double guessing again. What did he really know about Ladon? The man was a wizard. He knew who Harry was. The entire wizarding world would kill for the knowledge of what he was considering taking part in. He imagined being trussed, helpless ... on display. He imagined pictures being taken of him ... He felt a hint of interest, but the larger - more sensible - part of him shied away from the thought. He'd be ridiculed. Ginny, Gods, what would Ginny -
Harry forces himself to stand, but he doesn't try to move away. Malfoy is cool against him, his body isn't the same raging furnace Harry's is, and he's strong.
'And your son, Mr. Malfoy, Scorpius. Would you do anything for him? To give him what was rightfully his?'
Scorpius frowned. 'Not Papa comes all the time. He hurt me and Papa cried for it.' Scorpius cuddled his bear close to his chest.
He watched it again now, felt the emotions flowing from him, and wondered what Draco was grieving this time.
In response, the hand at his hip pulled them closer together so that he could feel the hard press of the other man's arousal against his arse. He ground back into it and felt the bite of teeth at his neck. Harry put his hands up, tangling one in the silky smooth strands of the other man's hair. It was long enough to grip and pull him closer, to encourage him not to stop. For a moment the texture reminded him of Draco's hair and he had a flash of memory - his fingers buried in Draco's hair as their mouths met -
However, he'd never had reason to be inside an Auror interrogation room, and he wasn't sure it was an experience he needed to undertake any time soon.
Harry wasn't moving and Draco leaned forward, berating himself for not checking on him sooner. He would be in subspace, Draco was sure of it, but still, he should have checked. He'd been doing this for far too many years for him not to check and make sure the person he was with was okay.
Ladon made a tsk of disapproval and Harry remembered last time.
When they landed two hours later, Harry was breathless and pleasantly sore from the exertion and laughter. They'd chased each other as much as the snitch, each one showing off in more and more outlandish ways, until Draco had fallen, and only Harry's quick dive had saved him from hitting the ground at high speed. They'd agreed to call it a day from there and were walking back to the change rooms, shoulders bumping together as they discussed Snape's potions project.
him to kill her? Had she planted that need in his head? That was mad. Everything was still so mixed up inside his mind.
'Where the fuck have you been?'
Harry's about to turn and make some comment to Malfoy. He doesn't know what. Maybe something about how if he wasn't such a bastard he might get laid once in a while, when Malfoy stands, gathering his work together, and shrinking it down as he moves to his room with a muttered goodnight.
The weather seemed to be changing again. The day before it had soared into the high forties, to the level where the Aurors had all been diverted into providing industrial strength cooling charms and the Mungo's staff had been put on alert in case of heat-related collapses. Harry wondered why the Ministry wasn't being temporarily evacuated, until he saw a heavyset, older man with sweat pouring off him talking to a colleague in the cafeteria.
. The leather curled around his chest, a band of fiery pain.
on him—has Harry tossing and turning all night.
He shook hands with the portly old man, easily resisting the testing pressure squeezed against his hand. The former Minister for Magic laughed, 'Haven't gone soft cooped up in your office then, Mr. Potter?'
The squid was everywhere now, in him, on him, and wrapped around him. Draco felt himself getting lost in the overwhelming sensations.
'You called me sir in the last scene. That's something I generally require - and it looks like it fits well with your wishes. Is there anything you don't want me to say or call you? Anything you would find ... upsetting or triggering?'
'Yeah,' he agreed, 'I've got plans tonight. I need you to clear my calendar for anything after six, please.'
- as he took in the details. The final thing Harry ran his eyes over was a list of substances, all legal, though some questionable, sold in Malfoy's bar. 'Dreaming Darkly.' Harry rolled his eyes; what a pretentious fucking name.
He scraped at the desk with a broken and bitten fingernail, thinking about whether he wanted to go out that night. Dean might be up for it. Dean had come out most nights since he and Seamus had broken it off a few months ago. Harry could do with a good lay, even if doing it Polyjuiced into someone else's body always made him feel fucking weird. And if neither him or Dean found someone at the club, well, it wouldn't be the first time they'd come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Harry remembered the note he had received by owl, penned in a hand that looked familiar, but which he couldn't quite place. It had been unsigned, something he had thought was odd at the time, but not a deal breaker. People often didn't like to get themselves caught up in the business of curses. Harry had found the note again much later, tucked among bundles of his papers. He remembered looking over it, wondering if it had anything to do with James' death—if he'd been lured from the house on purpose that night. His investigations had gone nowhere and he'd given up on it, in the end.
, a tiny voice in his head murmured. Harry grasped it this time, trying to see where it had come from. He pulled at it, and it was connected to a single word.
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's hair and held him closer, trying to press his strength and his love into him. He rubbed a hand up and down Draco's back, letting him know he wasn't alone. Draco's body heaved with the force of his sobs and Harry felt his own chest twist in pain. He didn't want to see Draco hurting.
Then Draco dropped the pants too, and he stood naked before Harry, cock jutting out in front of him.
'Salute,' Draco said, replaying something he'd seen in one of Potter's memories. Potter winced, and Draco thought he may have miscalculated. It didn't happen often, but sometimes he made the wrong call about what a client expected or would respond to.
Draco raised an eyebrow, his smile quirking.
Draco could feel his magic rising within him, crackling around the room, shattering two of the lights with a loud crack. He could feel it meet the wave of force that was emanating from Harry, even now.
'You haven't done anything wrong,' Draco repeated, willing Harry to believe him. 'It's fine. I've missed you, Harry. I want this just as much as you do.' He checked Harry's face as he spoke, trying to see if Harry was willing to fall back into the lie—if he would let himself forget that someone else sat underneath the façade of the husband he missed so badly. Harry's shoulders relaxed slightly, and Draco felt a glow of satisfaction. He had always been a good liar.
Draco looked at him like he didn't believe the words, but he turned his hand so that his own clasped with Harry's. The grip was tight, like he didn't want to let go.
He looked around dispiritedly as he landed. The streets had calmed somewhat, but there were signs of the violence everywhere. Bloodstains and curse residue on the walls and pavements, swathes of the park still smoking, rubbish and debris littered everywhere. Harry didn't spare it a glance. He knew it was only going to get worse.
'Scorpius,' Harry said, trying not to let his urgency bleed into his voice. 'I'm friends with your Papa. I'm going to take you away from here and then I'm going to make Not Papa leave. Does that sound good?' He watched for Scorpius' small, tentative nod.
He lifts a hand to shove the door open and the glint of his bracelet catches his eye. He narrows his focus to it. Is Malfoy using it—using the bond—to control him? The thought makes him even more furious. What other reason would he have to imagine he could trust Malfoy, especially after what he's just seen?
'No good, worthless layabout! Just like your shiftless parents aren't you, boy? Well? Answer me!'
The silence felt heavy. Ominous. He felt like the forest was holding its breath, and he could sense a strange power sitting behind that. He wondered what would happen when its silence broke.
. Children, Malfoy. Fuck, I knew you were Death Eater scum, but this—'
Mr and Mrs Avery were hardly worth Blaise's time - they were still recovering from the post-war reparations owed by their family - but one never knew when the right relationship could come in handy. Draco watched a moment longer as Blaise sought out Mrs Fawley, detouring to collect a glass of the honeyed mead she was so partial too. As he touched her arm gently, Draco marveled again at what the full charm of Blaise Zabini could do to an unsuspecting woman - or man, he reflected bitterly, before pushing the thought away. Mrs Fawley was already far more relaxed, and her face was losing the hunted look she'd sported moments earlier.
'What's wrong with you?' Malfoy continues, face hard and full of judgement. 'I would have thought you, of all people, would have been above all that anti-werewolf bullshit.'
The look on Ron's face was wary, like he didn't know if he was going to get a hello or a hex. Harry felt a grim satisfaction. It wasn't like he'd ever actually hexed Ron, and the row they'd had last night hadn't been any worse than any other. Sure, he'd accused Ron of climbing over the top of him to get in bed with Robards … but for Ron not to have told him about the Malfoy case, that was just low. And he knew it. Harry could see the proof written all over his face.
Harry looks around, listening to the sounds of the forest as it wakes up for the night and the idea of it—the thought of being able to run and to smell and to just be himself in that primal way tugs at him. He wants to give in to it, wants to take the gift Draco is offering.
'You sure? You and I could have some fun.'
'Do you think this is strange?' he asked, looking up at Malfoy, the uncapped bottle clasped loosely in his hands.
This ch was somewhat diverted by the arrival of said Apocalypse, but I'm very pleased to be bringing it to you now. I've added a tag for drug use, but all other tags stand.
Potter's hands clenched into fists at Draco's words, but he still wouldn't open his eyes.
Ladon's mouth returned to him, faster this time, tongue lapping at his hole without reprieve, swirling around it. He felt the broad, wet strokes pushing at him, as though seeking entry. The idea sent fiery want spearing through him - would Ladon really?
Malfoy smiled in pleasure, cheeks reddening in a way that made Harry's heart skip. He ignored the reaction. It was just nice to see someone being so caring to Pheo... that was all.
Ladon held up a hand. 'I don't engage in penetration. Ever. My role in this Club is to facilitate your release. In my hands, this will be a purely physical experience, rather than sexual.'
'The trip today is a Reparation Society trip?' he called out, his voice rising.
Malfoy curled a lip. 'Of course not,' he said, in a voice that was derision layered with false sympathy. 'We can’t have the world knowing their Chosen One frequents a place like this, can we?' But he gestured Harry to one of the alcoves anyway. It was the farthest from the torches and was cast in shadow.
'You have no idea what sorry is,' Harry hissed, rage continuing to build in him. '
As he got closer to the Time Warner building, he found himself getting more and more nervous. He could feel his hands beginning to shake, and he shoved them into his pockets under his cloak. He was fine, he told himself. He just hadn't had anything to drink or smoke in a few days, was all. This was just his body's reaction to that. Nothing else.
He looked unaffected, but Harry could see his foot twitching slightly. Jiggling. Lucius was scared. He knew that such a quick decision-making process could only mean one thing. Complete exoneration, or life-long incarceration.
'Do you still want this?' Harry asked, voice gentle.
Draco could practically feel Blaise glaring at her over his head.
Wolf slumps back to the ground, the pain from his wounds flooding into him. His mate comes towards him, hesitating a few paces away. Wolf closes his eyes and whines. He doesn't know what he needs, but everything hurts, now the threat has gone.
Harry pulled his wand from his forearm holster and pointed it at the crowd below. He fired
'How did -' Draco began, but Harry shook his head, and Draco subsided.
out in the swirling mess of people. He had to get the lot of them outside to help stop this.
He assumed he wouldn't get anywhere near them and would need to wait for Malfoy to be alerted by the wards and to come and let him in, but to his surprise, they swung open silently at his approach.
'Do you like to
Ginny stared at him, the playfulness dropping from her face.
'You were hit with the killing curse,' Harry said softly, returning his eyes to Draco's face. He hesitated a moment longer, but then took a deep breath. 'You died.'
He stands under the water for a long time, feeling the heat of it sting against his skin until he can't stand it anymore. He shuts it off, pulls a musty towel out of the cupboard and dries himself roughly, heedless of the way it pulls at his healing wounds. Some of the shallow ones have already disappeared, but the wound on his shoulder is still deep, teeth marks ringing the joint. There are also cuts all across his chest, like knives dancing up his ribs.
'She's right,' Blaise said at his back. 'Potter's a Gryffindor. They love to fight and chase and to have big in-your-face declarations of love.'
Instead, Malfoy fills his thoughts. He forces himself to think like an Auror, to take the anger out of his system. Harry sifts through every detail of the meeting, reconciling it against the file on Darius Markwell that Archer had given him. He can feel the pieces turning over in his mind like a puzzle, waiting to be slotted into the right places. The Ministry may have rejected him, but that doesn't mean he's lost any of the skills that made him a force to be reckoned with over the last fourteen years.
He stood slowly, breathing against the pounding in his head as he clutched the hangover potion to his chest. He uncapped it and swallowed it in one, shuddering as the pain and nausea peaked for one agonising instant which felt like an hour. Then he sagged, looking down into the sink, breathing heavily, the bottle clutched in his fist.
As always, would love so much to hear what you thought about that one.
Harry shook his head, eyes still tightly closed, but his words changed. 'You're mad. You'll be mad. I didn’t do as I was told. I'm sorry. I meant to be good. I can be good. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.'
'Yeah,' Potter said, and his voice was thick.
'Arms up,' he says, and Harry complies, leaning on the car with a grunt of pain as the movement stretches the muscles of his back.
Ladon's grip tightened in Harry's hair again and his other hand moved to Harry's arm, pulling him up and around so they were facing each other, the kiss not broken by the movement. Ladon's mouth was hot and his tongue twined with Harry's, urgent and filthy.
'Fine,' he says. 'Archer said the assignment was a long one. I'll need a couple of days to myself at the end of next week, but aside from that I'm available. What are the logistics?'
'Harry, dear, it wasn't your fault. None of it was your fault. Fred's death was a tragedy ... but it was nothing to do with you.' She patted his hair and rocked him gently. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, focusing on keeping his breathing steady as her words washed over him.
She laid her hand on the gates and Harry saw the tattoos on her arms shift and flow as she shaped the wards to admit him. He realised that they were tentacles, from a Kraken, by the look of them, and that likely the body of the beast was inked into her back. It was a powerful being to invoke the protection of. Storing power in tattoos was rare, and Harry could count on one hand the number of people he'd met who used animal forms to do it. It made the magic more volatile, and it bled some of the spirit of the creature into the wielder in turn. Harry let his magic drift towards her, gently, not pushing, but the tentacles writhed and she sent him a sharp look almost immediately.
It was a long moment before he spoke, his voice slow as he considered. 'The best person for you to talk to about Muggles would be Daphne Greengrass. She's the one who coordinates the Muggle Liaison component of the excursions. She would have all the contacts for the Muggles they deal with to organise the trips, to know if there had been any sort of incident on one or something.'
Suddenly it seemed funny, that he was here, at home. So fucking funny. He giggled, throwing his head back and letting the sound flow from him into the air. He imagined little silver bubbles of laughter popping out of his mouth and the idea made him laugh even harder. Then two floated down towards him, hovering right in front of his face.
'You okay to fly in that?' he asked, gesturing to the jeans and t-shirt Potter was wearing.
Harry let go reluctantly and gestured to the seat opposite him as he took his own again.
'I could give you a hundred more examples just the same,' she said, gesturing at the shelves of scrolls around them. 'We have to lock them back down as quickly as we can. That's the only way to avoid wide-scale suffering.'
Malfoy looks over at him and nods with a faint smile. 'It's why I get the fast ones,' he says, looking back at the road as he pulls out around a car and merges smoothly back in.
Draco was walked to the chair facing the glass wall and pushed into it. He almost groaned in relief as his arms were released, but instead, he merely brought them in front of himself, neatly re-buttoning the cuff of his shirt where it was dangling open after his wand had been removed. He folded his hands in front of himself on the table and looked slowly around the small room.
Harry took the bottle without protest. He didn't care what he took, as long as it got him back to that place. He paused for a moment, frowning at himself internally. No, that wasn't right. This was his story - his cover. He shook his head, aware that Malfoy was watching him - his hesitation. He couldn't afford to think those things. Malfoy would be
He held his breath and held his calm, and in the space of a few heartbeats, he was through and into the restaurant. He took a few steps away from the group, moving over to a wall, and surveyed the room. It wasn't as large as he expected. There were around thirty people in the restaurant, spread out among the tables. On one side of the room were large windows, looking out onto the city. From the ceiling hung a wooden lighting design that ran almost the length of the space and made him think of a serpent, the way it undulated. The whole restaurant spoke of a tasteful display of money and power.
He paused, looking at Harry, and his eyes still held some of the wonder at what Harry had just told him.
Harry clutched Draco's still form tightly as he forced the world to do his will.
Harry shrugged, 'Not hiding, just … watching.'
There is light ahead, and the smell of the sea, the salt of it bleeding into the air. He slows as he approaches. Not because he is afraid. He has nothing to fear. No, he needs the anticipation. He needs his quarry to know he's coming. Needs the savage release that comes at the end of this hunt.
'You were cursed,' Harry said, his thumb rubbing lightly over Draco's cheek, almost unconsciously. The sensation made Draco aware of his entire body - aware that he was lying down, sprawled across Harry's lap.
Harry opened his mouth to protest and then closed it. After a few moments he spoke, quietly. 'But it's not about torture. It's consensual. It's about ... release.'
'Thanks for coming,' he said, focusing on her. 'It's good to see you.'
He tried to think how long it had been since he had eaten, and couldn't remember. He also didn't think he'd slept since the night of the riots in Prague. That had been a day ago? Two? He wasn't sure. Everything was starting to blur together.
They haven't spent the night in the same place twice since they left Malfoy's cabin. Both of them are starting to get more antsy now. Harry can see the tension in the lines of Malfoy's body, in the way his answers become sharper, his patience thinner. The wolf wants to wrap itself around Malfoy, to comfort him and let him draw strength and certainty from its presence. Harry thinks Malfoy might hex him if he tried.
The pressure disappeared after a moment as the chain fell back to Harry's chest. He breathed out a shaky breath and tried to get himself back under control, using the flood of guilt that his body’s response had provoked to try and kill the interest.
'Wait,' Harry said, smoothing one hand out on the table to try and stop it trembling. He took another deep drag on his smoke. He wanted to pull the cloak back over his shoulders, wrap its comfort around himself. 'How many of them are there?'
'I smell like you,' Harry says, and his voice drops lower than he means it to as he thinks about just how much he likes that.
After he was acquitted and the family were ordered to pay reparations, Malfoy cornered Harry in the corridor outside.
'He's a werewolf,' Harry mutters, his anger making his words short and hard. 'You can't trust him.'
Harry nodded, pulling the shirt over his head, grateful for the reprieve. He sank down into an armchair - the one closest to the fire, which he usually raced Ron for. He pulled his legs up and wrapped an arm around them. Hermione looked at him once more, her eyes full of questions, before she disappeared into the kitchen.
'How are you feeling?' she asked, peering at him.
'I need a shower,' Malfoy says as he turns to the door that leads to his room. 'I feel filthy.'
'Do you want me to bugger off?' he asked carefully. He hadn't meant to overstay his welcome. His suspicion that Malfoy could be behind this had dissolved days ago. Malfoy had showed no signs of being malicious or deviously interested in doing damage to the Ministry. The thought that Malfoy didn't want him around but had just been tolerating him made Harry feel strangely uncomfortable.
. His Draco was healthy, fit, always dressed in sharp, tailored clothes. He wouldn't be seen dead in tattered robes, with unwashed hair and with that unhealthy cast to his skin. Then reality came slamming back down. This wasn't his Draco. He didn't have a Draco.
'Things with Ginny are still... tense. I didn't want to intrude,' Potter says, as he puts his hands in his lap, cradling the glass between them and hunching his shoulders.
'Hmm,' Malfoy said, noncommittally. Harry felt annoyance stir at that. He'd expected Malfoy to - to tell him off or something. The lack of response irked him. He didn’t know why.
'She's looking into ways of suppressing it, mainly,' Harry said, tamping down the desire to let the excess power bleed from him into spells he didn't need. Draco's eyebrows raised and Harry flushed slightly.
There's no response. Harry turns his face slightly into the pillow, breathing in their mingled scents, and closes his eyes.
He has to wait for a moment then, drawing in shallow, panting breaths as the fire radiates through him. Something is wrong. This shouldn't be happening. He should be halfway healed from a knife wound by now, even without the spells Malfoy had cast on him.
'That was … not at all what I expected to find when I came here today.'
Harry watches it like it's in slow-motion. The man behind Draco turns, and his face is nightmarishly familiar. Harry doesn't have a second to wonder why he's here or how he hid himself. Everything is moving too fast. It's the scene from their apartment weeks before repeating itself. Harry sees blue eyes alight with a cold triumph at being able to complete the mission this time, and then the knife swings through the air. He feels his earlier fury rise, a thousand times stronger. He roars out his protest, a scream of sound as he begins to move.
'Maybe you and I can have a race some time, what do you recon?'
'Good boy,' Ladon replied and Harry felt that same shiver of warmth at the words - the approval behind them.
Hermione nodded.
Draco heard the door open behind him but he didn’t turn around, expecting it to be Pansy. Instead, he felt strong arms encircle him from behind. Blaise.
in that chapter, so I would love your thoughts on any part of it.
He had a flash of memory. The cupboard by the sink - the dark, cramped space … the way the lock sounded as the bolt slid home.
'I know what it means,' Malfoy said grimly. 'And you don't need to waste your people on looking after me. I assure you. I am very capable of looking after myself and what's mine.'
Harry doesn't want to respond to that statement, so they spend the drive back in silence. Malfoy drives even more aggressively this time, cutting hard in front of cars and putting enough speed on that if he made one misjudgement, Harry knows he would be very lucky to walk away.
Harry pushed his hands out wider as he closed the distance to the gate. He saw more cracks splinter up the red glow of the wards and then he was at the wrought-iron barrier. He left one hand high in the air and pushed the other forward, shoving his will at the gates as he cast a Confringo at them. The gates smashed open, one breaking off its hinges and spinning into the darkness. The impact radiated out from the wards and Harry felt the pressure on him lessen immediately.
'I kept a journal. My own form of Occlumency. Put all the thoughts in there the Dark Lord could never know and then locked them up.' Malfoy had mimed a key, locking it tight, and throwing it away.
Harry paused for a moment, trying to force his racing thoughts to calm. He pulled his cloak back on, almost absently, and leaned against the wall of the alley, closing his eyes. Gods, but he was so tired. He could feel the crash from using his Stamina rune fast approaching. He knew he couldn't stay here long, but it would take Ron a while to get a trace expert to follow his Apparition trail, if he even had the resources to do that, with the borders closing.
,' Ladon said.
Even so, Draco wasn't prepared for a jittery Harry Potter rushing in the door and asking him to put on the Invisibility Cloak before Apparating them to the Ministry of Magic entrance.
'Good boy,' Ladon murmured.
Malfoy's lip curled. 'There are some Purebloods - mostly the older generation - who are still against what we're trying to achieve with the Society. They think it's destroying the tradition - sullying the purity of the sacred twenty-eight.' He snorted and Harry raised an eyebrow, surprised further by the response. 'As if we're not all inbred within an inch of our lives. If anything has sullied our purity, it's our inability to look outside our own families for partners, or for original thoughts for that matter.'
'Well,' Hermione said. 'It's just that the Reparation Society is actually doing some good work.' She held up her hand to forestall Harry's argument. 'They are, and you shouldn't let Malfoy distract you from that. We just got a million galleon donation from them in support of the Magical Education Squib Exclusion Law Reform Project. Half of it goes to overhauling the laws so that squibs can be educated alongside their magical siblings in advance of attending Hogwarts and the other half goes towards building new facilities to accommodate the increase in students once the law goes through.'
Jakub made a satisfied noise and held out a small plastic bag. Harry pulled his wallet out and counted a handful of Koruna in exchange. He tucked the bag into his pocket, pushing away the urge to roll himself a joint and light it up. He could wait until he got home. Jakub only ever gave him enough for a week and he'd need it to get to sleep.
'So what now?' Harry says, clearing his throat and ignoring the warmth that grows in his chest at Draco's unspoken teasing.
Harry settles himself in bed, letting the darkness and the quietness of the room around him soothe him. He's so tired and he can feel sleep pulling at him. It always takes him a few days after a full moon to shake off the exhaustion.
'What?' he snaps.
Ron found him like that. He wasn't sure how much later. He heard his name, then swearing, then Ron's hands on him, pulling him up and outside. Guiding him into the cool night air.
Ron relaxed at his words and nodded. 'Tomorrow is fine. Try and get some rest. You look like shit.'
Harry couldn't help the snort that left his mouth.
Harry wanted badly to be able to hold Draco, to let him know this was going to be alright.
As he thought that, his eye caught on Malfoy and he watched him for a moment, impressed again by the ease with which he worked the room. He seemed to be totally in his element. Harry wondered how that felt, for that public confidence to come so easily. To
Harry felt like he wanted to vomit, as the truth of it spread through him. He realised a part of him had suspected it—had seen all the little ways in which Draco was different from the man Harry had known—but he hadn't wanted to join the dots together, to face the idea that Draco had been possessed.
in his mind.
Harry can see Malfoy's annoyance hidden under the spotted face of his glamour and that just makes his smile wider.
Harry frowned, remembering Ron's words when he'd walked in - the conclusion he'd jumped to. He could barely bring himself to examine whatever it was he was feeling for Ginny on top of everything else churning inside him.
A hint of a smile crossed Draco's lips and he nodded once.
. He slammed the door of the bar behind himself, just remembering to put his glamour up before he exited.
Ladon hissed in a breath at the words, eyes looking anguished. He dropped the control he'd been sporting since he'd broken their kiss, when he'd told Harry what was going to happen. Now he looked torn.
'Oh,' Malfoy says, eyes widening. 'You're back with us, are you? That's marvellous.' He pushes at Harry's shoulder, pushing him back and away.
He started when Draco broke into his thoughts, approaching his desk with another summary report.
'Fuck you,' Harry said. 'You don't know anything about me.'
Ron reached out and put a hand on his arm. 'Are you sure?' He looked at the lightning ripping the sky apart with worry written across his face. 'It looks bloody dangerous. Is Malfoy worth it?'
'You better not hex me for this when you wake up,' Malfoy mutters, but his hand doesn't stop its stroking. They lie there in the darkness together, neither saying anything. The silence between them feels charged, though what with, Harry doesn't know.
'Harry,' he said, reaching out a gentle hand again, running it lightly down Harry's arm. There was no response, so Draco looked closer. He could see Harry's mouth moving against the floor, as though he was whispering something soundlessly.
He turned to one marked 69 and waved his wand over the lock. It glowed green for a moment before the door clicked open.
He can smell other wolves in the crowd as well. He can't tell how many or where they are, with so many people in close proximity, but the fact that they're here at all, that they feel safe to gather at an event like this, is something he doesn't think he could have imagined, even a few months ago.
The only time during the interview when Malfoy's veneer of control had cracked had been at the mention of Scorpius.
Harry closes his eyes and grips Draco's arse tighter as thrusts into it, whimpering with his need. He can feel his orgasm rising, smell the way Draco's scent is layered over his, claiming him. He thrusts forward once, twice more and then cries out as he begins to come, burying his face in Draco's neck, squeezing his eyes shut against the intensity of it.
'You don't roll Gillyweed into those, do you?' he asked quietly.
'I'm fine,' he said instead, retreating into the numbness. It was better than the pain of feeling. 'What are you doing here?'
. He hadn't been watching for Malfoy. It had been so long since he had been watching for Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry understood alright, half his career he'd hunted rabid weres, containing or killing them before they could spread the disease further. He'd fought against the prejudice to start with, but once the numbers had risen… Once he'd experienced that one night of terror and pain and had what was so precious ripped from him by those animals, well, after that he'd had no issues throwing himself into the hunt.
'Do you know Rose's mama has an otter for a Paternus?' he asked, eyes wide and curious. 'And her papa has a dog, a small one.'
He wondered if Malfoy had been back.
Huge, wracking sobs tore out of him - he felt like they were tearing him apart. He felt arms come up around him, holding him close, holding him in. The arms were strong and sure, gentle where they had been violent a moment before. Soft words started up, a background murmuring that didn't penetrate his mind as he cried out his anguish and sorrow. He leaned against the warm body and let himself pour it all out.
'Our surveillance has been long-distance and covert,' Jeffries was saying, and Harry startled slightly, leaning forward to catch all the details. He hadn't known there had been surveillance. Suddenly he was even more glad that he had taken the precaution of using glamours and Polyjuice each time he approached the bar. So long as the Aurors knew, he was just another punter coming for a good time.
Ron just sighed and crossed his arms, as though Harry was a petulant child he couldn't be bothered reasoning with.
He was two steps into the space when he realised it was a travelling room, and then he cursed as he heard the crack of Malfoy's Apparition.
she's a damned Auror, you git. Just like I knew you were when you showed up as that incredibly conspicuous dickhead.'
But now, he focused on his breathing, focused on thoughts of Draco, and let Elders call his objections.
Malfoy waved at him as if it were self-evident. 'This is why. You're dreaming too much. It's dangerous.'
At the mention of his son's name Malfoy sagged slightly, the edge of fear coming back into his face.
He reached into his pocket, pulling out his transfer coin and touching it to the Gringotts symbol beside the register as he thought about how much he wanted to move.
'Harry Potter,' said the first who reached him, an older balding man. 'I'm from
Draco had just dropped Scorpius off at Parkinson Estate when the Aurors arrived. He was outside of the wards and about to Apparate to Release when they popped into existence around him, wands drawn and pointing at him.
'Where is Scorpius?' Harry demanded again.
'You haven't told me much about him,' Draco says. 'Bill says your dad and my mum's cousin used to help him, back in school.' He doesn't pause for Harry's response and Harry looks at him more closely as he wonders where this is going. A glimmer of hope flickers to life in his chest.
'No? No, of course not. Harry Potter - The Chosen One, The Golden Boy - is not a sadist. Everything you've ever done has been to stop pain, hasn't it? To stop the damage against those you care about - against the innocent.'
'Sorry,' he blurted out, reaching up to remove it. Ladon pushed his hands away and raised an eyebrow, clearly wanting an explanation.
He didn't even bother reading the words, it would be some drivel about a pet dog or an outing to a farm. Instead he cast his wand in a complex symbol over the page, watching as the letters rearranged themselves into the real message Sophia had sent him.
Harry stirred and Draco shushed him softly, beginning to sing again.
Harry stared at him for a moment, at a loss for words, but then he felt anger stir to life. He took a step forward, leaning and placing his hands on his desk so he could send the full strength of his glare into Malfoy's face.
The man still smells of Harry. He needs to smell of Wolf. He rumbles his dissatisfaction and steps closer, pushing hard against the man. He takes half a step back and his arms come up to grasp the fur at Wolf's shoulders. But he doesn't fight or try to escape. He only steadies himself.
'We're going to play now, Harry,' Ladon said, the sound of his voice moving to Harry's left, where the bench full of implements was. Harry turned his head in that direction. 'Your only job is to stay still. No matter what I say or do, you will not move. Is that understood?'
'And their parents,' Mrs. Norris confirmed, unruffled by the murderous look on Harry's face. 'I believe there will be reporters, as well, for this first visit. It's quite a momentous occasion - visits initiated by some of the oldest Wizarding families to the Muggle world for the purpose of breaking down barriers and prejudices that formerly led to -'
'I lied,' Malfoy said, stopping and facing him. Harry felt his heart beating faster in his chest and a sick feeling rise in his stomach. 'When I said I was doing something important that would be affected by the weather, I lied,' Malfoy said. Harry waited, forcing himself to hear what came next. Malfoy looked embarrassed. 'I work in the Floo Network Authority now,' he said, not meeting Harry's eyes. His tone was bitter. 'I spend my days making duplicate copies of Floo connection applications.' His shoulders hunched. 'Living the dream,' he muttered, as he turned away.
'You forgot your silencing charm?' Malfoy said, his voice a murmur in the night, his hand still on his cock.
that Harry wanted, suddenly, to kiss him. His breath caught at the thought and he had to look away. They'd only just become friends. He couldn't - he didn't -
He makes himself think back to what he'd seen in the memories.
He tried to focus on the niggling doubt that the pull he was feeling now was just an extension of that old obsession—was just his inability to separate himself from his old enemy-turned-lover. Was it more than that? The
'You need to get ready for the funeral,' Ron said and Harry felt the word like a blow. He realised for the first time that Ron was wearing his best black robes, the ones he'd married Hermione in. Harry stared at them, like they were a betrayal.
'Hey, breathe, okay?' Malfoy says, Steve's muddy blue eyes looking into Harry's, lit up by the light of the wand Malfoy has pressed against Harry's arm.
Harry moved over to the crumpled form Draco remembered seeing on his awakening, and he pulled the man roughly to his back, throwing an Envenerate at his face. The dark-haired man gasped and woke, twisting immediately in his bonds before realising he was trapped. He immediately relaxed, leering up at Harry, who was kneeling beside him.
And then he turns and runs.
Then Harry came home from work one day, tense and tight-lipped. When Draco questioned him, he refused to say anything, going to bed early and feigning sleep when Draco joined him. The next morning, before he left for work, he asked Draco to go out with him that night, with no other details than that he would be home late, and Draco should be ready at 10pm. It was a strange request, even from Harry.
'Fuck,' Harry whispered, his voice raw. 'I miss you James.' His voice broke on the last word and he dug his fingers into his sides until they cut like claws. He was sobbing out loud now, the sounds ripped from him.
'I guess I must be a crackpot, nowadays,' Harry said, voice flat, as he took a step closer to Luna. He realised as he said it, that he'd picked a side. He knew what he'd just been told by Conor and Aoife was the truth. Something about it resonated with him down to his very bones.
'I'm sorry,' Harry says. He knows he needs to say this. If he wants to keep building trust with Malfoy, this can't stand between them. He spent a sleepless night fighting the pull of the moon and feeling his body warp and tremble as he tried to figure out what to say to Malfoy.
He curled his hand into a fist and took a deep, shuddering breath, feeling the tears burning at the back of his eyes again. He threw back the glass of whisky he held in his hand, finishing it with two deep gulps, welcoming the burn in his throat instead. It refilled automatically. Ron had brought it for him as a joke gift years before.
Harry hummed his agreement, knowing it wasn't that simple. 'Do - I can't be in the stand with you, but do you want me to support you at all, during it?' He knew what he was asking. Knew it was far to soon for the unspoken words.
Harry took a deep breath and knocked on the door. It opened automatically and he stepped into a small entryway. A woman was walking down the hall towards him, a smile on her face. She was about his height and looked to be in her mid-forties, her hair an auburn bob.
'Colour?' Ladon asked.
'War,' Harry said. 'Why is it depicted as a skeleton? In my dream, it was a man. He had bloody teeth and pale hair.'
This was beautiful.
'What do you mean elsewhere,' Harry said, lifting his head in puzzlement.
He wanted to cut Jakub down, to burn or bury him. He wanted to find out who did this and rip them apart.
'I'm going to Apparate us, and hope that when you land you don't want to rip me apart. Sound okay?'
'He caused the first rising,' they said to Mac, gesturing at Harry and making a shooing motion towards the chair. 'Did you know that?' They turned to Harry next. 'You caused the first rising. You won't be doing that again. Not under my watch.'
He will keep hiding. At least he'll be doing what he loves. At least he'll be able to help people again.
Harry felt the tingle of Malfoy's magic over his skin, sparking lightly, then settling like a strangely familiar blanket. Then his clothing shimmered and re-shaped. The vest-jacket tightened and lost its sleeves, forming instead into a hardened chest plate. The ridiculous shorts flared out into a swathe of cool fabric, edged with leather straps. The tights melted away and sturdy sandals encased his calves. He felt a weight hang from his shoulder and turned his head slightly to see a heavy red velvet cape flowing down his back.
'I can deal with Robards. I have for the last four years.' He cast his mind for anything to talk about but that prat. 'Bring me up to speed. What did I miss in the scintillating life of the Auror force?'
Thoughts, questions, comments?
He couldn't turn away from it now. More than any of the other things Harry had observed in the last two days, Scorpius' words made it true. The person Harry had known could never leave his child locked in a filthy room, could never hurt him. Something was inside Malfoy's body, forcing him to act this way.
There was a murmur from the boy in question.
Shacklebolt spread his hands. 'I'm sending a Ministry-wide memo today, but at this point, your guess is as good as mine as to whether someone's done this on purpose.'
Draco threw back the drink in his hand and re-poured.
you're doing it.' Malfoy closed his mouth, looking embarrassed and Harry wondered how long he'd bottled up the question.
The guilt disappears and Potter tilts his chin up. 'It was a man, actually,' he says, meeting my eyes directly, and now there's no shame. I can see the evidence of a battle fought and won, something he
He woke from the dream with a feeling of peace and contentment flowing through him. For a few minutes, it managed to resist the confusion and disbelief that crept in against it, the more Harry thought about what had just happened.
Harry reminds himself that it doesn't matter what Draco might think he wants… or what Harry wants. He's a danger to Draco and that's the end of it.
Malfoy cocked his head to one side. 'My grandson,' he said, something in his face softening slightly at the words. Harry was surprised to see it. 'And my lawyer, once a year.'
'Come on,' he said, standing and gesturing the others to their feet. 'He doesn't know anything. Let's go.'
Draco felt Charlie's name rip through him, in time with his own orgasm.
After a long moment, Draco speaks, and his voice is barely a whisper.
Malfoy considered him a moment longer, the smile still on his lips, then he gestured around the room. 'Coat check is over there. Drinks at the bar, food will be circulating. I'm assuming we'll see you on the dance floor?' he asked, grin deepening.
'That's impossible,' Daniela said, moving closer. 'I cast continual preservation and protection charms on each individual bone. Not even dust should be on them.'
Harry pours the drinks and sits opposite Malfoy, placing his glass in front of him, smoke curling off the surface of it.
'A boy like yours needs a mother,' Belvina said, shaking her head sadly.
Within seconds she was murmuring into it. Harry could only catch snippets, but what he did hear made him smile grimly.
He knew when he'd reached the centre of the storm. A column of clouds shot up into the air in front of him, twisting and surging, like a living beast. Harry took a deep breath as he looked at it. He could do this. He'd done plenty of things that were just as dangerous as this.
Ginny looked over with a smile and nodded. 'Coming, Harry?' she asked as she took a step into the room.
Harry lit his wand, a
'Stop enjoying it so much,' Harry muttered at her, groaning at the thought of the hordes of reporters he was going to have to start dodging again.
'Saved by the tea,' Draco said, as she walked away.
He wants to tell her the families of those killed by wolves every moon would beg to differ. Some days he wants to grab her and shake her and make her
'It's criminal what we do to them,' Malfoy growls, 'hunting them like dogs instead of helping them.' He takes a deep breath and Harry can hear the shake in it. He doesn't turn around. He can't. Malfoy is wrong. People—good, innocent, ordinary people—need to be protected from werewolves and that's the end of it.
Pansy's gaze held none of the sympathy he'd seen when he'd first arrived at her door. Instead she wore that set expression she got when she knew she was right about something and was going to go down fighting for it.
Harry woke early on Christmas Day to Hugo's fingers poking him in the face. They were sticky and Harry groaned, cracking open his eyes. He'd stayed up late the night before, talking with Ron and Hermione, but clearly children on Christmas could not be dissuaded. He rubbed his hand over his face and reached for his glasses on the bedside table.
Blake flapped a hand dismissively. 'They muck around using the seal to separate the force from the host so they can keep the host alive. It's finicky and fails more often than not. Their Catalysts end up doing the opposite of what they meant to.' Blake paused to give him a judgemental look. 'We won't be having any of that soft rubbish from you, will we?'
Her eyes narrowed on seeing Draco and he wondered just what Harry had told them about what he'd done.
As he watched the children opening their gifts - Hugo gravitating to the floor to play with his new Niffler plushie - he realised, belatedly, that he hadn't got them anything. There had been a few presents, wrapped in a pile in the corner of the living room, but Ginny had taken them with her. He didn't even know who they'd been for. She usually organised that sort of thing - gifts, remembering events, birthdays and the like. It hadn't even occurred to him to bring any Christmas presents with him when he'd come over the night before for a drink and to break the news about him and Ginny separating.
. It's over. I fucked everything up and it's
Malfoy shrugs, as though it's nothing. 'Preferably not,' he says. 'Not that he's not good looking, but I prefer my fucks to have more meaning behind them.' While Harry is digesting that thought and the ramifications of it, Malfoy continues, 'But I'll do whatever I have to, to get what I need.'
'Has Lucius Malfoy done anything illegal since he was released from Azkaban?' Harry asks, watching Malfoy intently.
he reminded himself.
'Rudolf Higgs.' The undercover agent he'd left in too long.
Jonathan's eyes widen slightly but he nods and smiles, leaving the room, the curtain swishing closed behind him.
Payback came just over an hour later, when his assistant's voice came through his office door. 'Your nine o'clock appointment is commencing now, Mr Potter.'
She speaks quietly, almost a whisper, but Harry hears it clearly. He knows he's supposed to, and he feels something, one of the last pieces of his shame, unfold and twist away. He's known the way he's coped—or not coped— with his change has hurt Molly. Her scent is always edged with a bitter worry that she can't hide. He realises that's what's different. That's what he couldn't put his finger on last time he saw her.
Lucius inclined his head, his eyes tightening. Harry was interested to see that after all these years, that still grated.
'Fine, where am I meeting them and who's with me?'
'I need to sleep,' Malfoy says at last, exhaustion layering through his scent. 'I've figured out about half of the pattern, but it's too delicate for me to do any more like this. I'll fuck it up and bring the cliff down on our heads.'
out of the ordinary, I want you to find the list of names in the case file on my desk. Draco Malfoy made it up for me. It's people who have an issue with the Pureblood Society and what they're doing.' He paused, looking at Jones and making sure she understood the seriousness of what he was saying. 'Not one of those people was at the party last night.'
Harry shook his head, not wanting to hear it. Not wanting to listen. 'You're wrong,' he said again, turning for the stairs, his steps picking up as he got closer.
At those words he reached down to the hem of his shirt and pulled it over his head, shaking his wet hair out of his eyes as the raindrops hit his bare chest and dripped their path down. Harry ignored how uncomfortable it was to have people's eyes on him, as he stood in the middle of the Ministry Atrium clad just in cargo pants and heavy black boots. He looked down at Pheo, curled around his neck, head drooping as she looked up at him.
Javier had refused Harry the warrants, citing his lack of hard evidence at every turn. When Harry had finally shouted at him, asking Javier how the
He lay on the floor beside Harry, touching him with only the tips of his fingers, just enough that Harry would know he was there, but not so much that he would feel smothered or threatened.
Davies' office is easy to remove as well. Malfoy clicks away on his phone for a bit before he identifies a list of all the other tenants. He somehow comes up with a schematic of the building, which, while hard to read on the small screen, tells them that it wouldn't be the ideal site to move children through either. It's too open, has too many other parties involved.
Robards nods and reaches to shake hands with Harry as well. 'Welcome back,' he says. 'I assume you can start immediately? We have a whole holding block full of people who were picked up from your op. Place is bursting.'
Instead I sit there and let him touch me, and I have no idea why.
So, what if Harry doesn't?
Just being around other people - just being around Draco - was helping. It was making the night before seem less real and his past seem less present.
The idea that Malfoy will just disappear again stirs something deep within Harry's chest. He was on the case boards of the DMLE for years. There were bets about who would bring him in. It was one of the cases that had sat on Harry's unsolved pile throughout his nine years as Senior Auror, almost as though Malfoy were taunting him. The fact that he's eluded everyone for so long, only to pop up right in front of Harry's nose, is not something he can ignore. Even if there is a possibility Malfoy will out him, he can't let this opportunity slide.
'Because of my scar?' he asked, and Conor's eyes moved to his forehead, as though he were seeing the lightning bolt that cut across his forehead and spilled down onto his cheek for the first time.
Harry sits back, mind racing as he considers Malfoy's words, his apparent openness to Harry still working with him, despite what he'd tried to do. He attempts to fit the new information about the role Malfoy needs him for and why he might allow Harry close to him into the case he's building in his mind.
'It's raining, Mr Baggins,' Harry said, stepping forward. 'In my office.'
He lies awake at night and concentrates until he can pick out the sound of Draco breathing as he sleeps. Only then, when he's sure his wolf will wake him if something changes, does he sleep.
Draco looked at him, as though unsure whether he should speak for a moment, but then he said, 'I - do you want to come with us? You could invite them too - Granger and Weasley and the kids. If you want.'
He was about to step closer when he remembered Conor's reaction to his cloak. He'd said Harry was wrapping himself in Death. Harry touched the fabric briefly, fingers almost clutching, before he forced himself to let go. He wasn't sure why, but he didn't want whoever was inside this building to know he had the cloak yet, or maybe at all. He moved back around the side of the building until he was out of sight and then pulled the fabric back, blinking as the bright sunlight stabbed into his eyes without the shadowy barrier filtering it away for him.
be able to stand. Harry winces with pain he doesn't feel. The wounds had healed within a day. Hurt like a bitch, but healed. Not that he can tell Archer just how that had come about. Not that he can let anyone find out.
'I can't love you, Harry,' he said. 'I'm not real. Samael Ladon is
'Good morning, everyone,' he began, putting on his 'public speeches' voice. 'I will be accompanying you today, along with Aurors Jones, Smith and Johnson.' He indicated each in turn. 'We don't anticipate any issues on the excursion - the Muggle world is not a dangerous place - but we will also be along to make sure that you all feel safe and comfortable in what might feel like a daunting experience. Please call on us at any point during the day. Are there any questions?'
They made their way along the hall, down the staircase, through the lounge and into the kitchen and still she'd said nothing. Draco could practically feel her eyes boring into his head. He glanced back at her as he let Scorpius down into a chair. Her gaze was implacable and expectant.
Malfoy's face when Harry invited him to lunch that day was priceless. There was surprise, wariness, and then quickly-hidden longing. Malfoy headed towards the cafeteria, but Harry steered him away and down to the Atrium, where he showed Malfoy the secret lift that led to the rooftop.
Harry pushed himself to his feet, unable to sit still. 'I - I yelled at her and left.' He paced in front of the fire.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow and his look of disdain speaks volumes. He tightens his grip on Harry's arm and then they're whirling into space.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed and pulled his wand from his sleeve. He put the joint to his mouth and lit it, sucking back immediately. The smoke already in the room had dulled his nerves a little but he needed something more - something to settle him - to stop him walking out the door.
Draco thought about his conversation with Pansy, thought about what he would do. He'd invite Potter for dinner. He'd get Scorpius out of the house … just in case it went badly. They'd have a meal, as friends, and then he would tell him. He would get everything out in the open - no more secrets or lies.
She looked as though she wanted to protest, the same look Hermione had sported coming over her face.
your fault.'
that dominated so much of his waking life.
He sits back and lets himself enjoy the ride. He's never been this fast in a car. The Weasleys' old Ford Anglia's top speed hadn't come anywhere near what Malfoy is travelling now, even in the air.
. He could feel the pressure, feel everything he'd just heard, pushing at him until he couldn't breathe. He took a step forward, speaking just to break himself out of his own thoughts.
James couldn't go in the ground. He needed to be here. In bed. In Harry's arms. He needed to be smiling up with his nonsense sounds and his chubby, gasping hands.
Harry feels a mix of joy and fear rise in him in equal measure, but he knows this needs to be done.
'And the Manor?' Giles continued. 'His fortune? How do you feel about that. Do you feel like it should rightly be yours?'
Headquarters. He couldn't. Not after what he'd just seen. Instead he hunted the next name on his list: Marcus Langdon. He was a dead end as well. But at least the focus of getting through security, hunting through his rooms for information and standing over his sleeping body to get a read on him was enough to take his mind off Malfoy.
He expected to find the central room in a state of chaos, but the activity inside was functioning exactly as it had every other time he had walked inside. There was a tension in the air; a heightened level of stress and determination, but no one was rushing outside to help those in the street.
He pulled them apart, grabbing the man's hand and pulling him away, off the dance floor. The toilets were golden too, light flickering off every surface, searing into his brain. Harry didn't bother with what the man looked like, he just pulled them both into a cubicle, touched his wand and whispered the spells to prep himself before he shoved his pants down to his thighs.
Scorpius appeared a moment later with his stuffed dragon held under one arm. Draco cast a Notice-Me-Not over the flat - it wouldn't stop someone determined to get in, but would shield the place from casual observation. Then he bent, hoisted Scorpius to his hip and Apparated with a crack.
Damn but it was hot. Harry pulled his t-shirt off as well, leaving a sleeveless black undershirt that clung to his chest. Pheo uncurled from his neck and slid down to wrap around his forearm.
He looked at the smaller group and then froze, as his eye caught on Draco Malfoy, holding hands with Scorpius as they walked down a Muggle street together. He felt a sick sense of dread run through him.
With that he wrenches his arm forward and Harry loosens his grip to let him go. Malfoy makes for the door, completely ignoring the bouncer on the way in. The man glances at Malfoy but makes no move to stop him. Harry looks back at up the neon sign dubiously. If this is a strip club then Malfoy's type—all flashy and clearly with money to spend—are probably regular fare.
Draco let his fear and confusion and the bitter words his father had spouted about the children being unclean and common and dangerous seep into the memory. Then he bottled it, scribbling a brief summary onto a tag. He raised his wand to his temple again.
Harry nods his approval as he tucks in. 'What do you think happened?' he asks after a moment.
'Stop it, Harry. This can't be such a surprise. Things have changed so much between us. You're clearly not happy either, or you wouldn't have kissed someone else.'
, was the only word he could think of to describe it. Four enormous bell-shaped domes sat at each corner of the underground chapel and everywhere he could see there were human bones. They'd been arranged in artistic patterns; they hung from the ceiling like macabre chandeliers. Thigh bones were draped like curtains. Human bodies had been turned into decorations.
Harry considered owling her, to see if she was around, but he stopped himself. That wasn't what they were to each other anymore.
'The life of the party, I see, Potter.'
'Seriously?' came a cry from the gate and Harry glanced across to see Ron approaching. 'You've been here less than one minute. I timed it. You've been on the ground for thirty-six seconds, mate,' he said as he pulled Harry into a hug. Harry laughed, returning the embrace.
It was.
Hermione bit her lip as she cast her mind back. 'I think we did have Javier's assistant poking around last week, looking for something or other to do with international case studies. Why? What happened?'
'Are you saying you don't want me?' he asked, softly.
Draco looked hesitant for a moment, and Harry was reminded that he still kept his contact with the rest of the Auror department minimal, despite having been working there for over a week now.
. And it was there that the paperwork got detailed. He had pages and pages in the
That idea spun into another, as Harry closed his eyes, bringing James' face to life in his mind, humming a lullaby to him as he thought. He was on the edge of sleep, soothed by the thought of rocking James in the chair in his room, when the image of the Resurrection Stone slipped into the back of his mind. Once it was there, it was like a thorn in a sock, scratching away at him, until he looked at it more closely.
Harry turns back to Kingsley and Robards. 'I'd be very pleased to accept,' he says. 'Thank you for the offer.'
Harry is holding on to Malfoy again when they land and he pushes him away with annoyance. 'You have to stop doing that.'
He felt his mood sour further. What the fuck was Malfoy doing with this photo, still? How dare he pretend that any of it had mattered?
'On your back,' Draco said, and Harry obeyed, feeling the ridges of the ropes pushing against his back and the knots against his skin.
'Right. That will make things more difficult, but not insurmountable.'
Harry looked back in the direction the impact had come from and then gestured to Jennings to go check it out. 'If there are casualties, evacuate to Mungo's. You'll need to be back outside the wards to Apparate. And send word to Auror Bones. Get more teams here immediately.' Jennings nodded and ran back down the way she had come.
Draco slid his hands over Harry's skin, marvelling at how smooth it was, how warm he was. He could sit here like this all day, with Harry in his arms.
Draco smiled tiredly against Harry's chest.
'Fine,' Granger said. 'Shall we sit, then? I assume you're here to talk about Harry?'
,' Malfoy said. 'We can read Babbity Rabbity again.'
Harry looked at him, curiosity spiking anew to know that the face he was seeing was a façade as well. He wondered what the real Ladon looked like … how similar he was to the man sitting in front of him right now. Harry thought for a moment about asking what family the talent ran in - or what he looked like underneath - but he figured that probably defeated the purpose of why Ladon wanted to be unrecognisable to start with. And besides, he realised, it really didn't matter to him. He wanted what this man - this Club - could offer. He didn't need more information than that.
Draco hesitated, not sure what Potter wanted from him – the truth certainly wouldn't go down well.
The final one was the Seal of the Veil. It was a circle divided by an X, with a V shape coming off each side. It made Harry think of eyes opening in the darkness. He hated it with a visceral sense of terror that came from somewhere deep inside him.
Malfoy and make him bloody say why he did this. Why had he fucked with Harry's head? Why had he played with him and allowed him to feel something - feel everything?
'Friends,' her voice boomed out over the square. 'Does the lion cower before the ants at his feet?'
Davies stiffens at the words, and the insinuation, and Harry pushes the door at him, a sharp jab which sends him back half a pace.
'It's not a choice, Potter. You take the Veritaserum and tell me what I need to know, or we both leave this room and never come back.'
, he realised. A dull part of him thought it would be getting all over Harry's uniform, the rest of him was lost in that dazed, dreamlike state.
He turned on his heel and ran for the stairs, thumping his way up them, his earlier exhaustion forgotten. He could hear Ginny's voice now too, soft and sweet and he felt his heart thump inside his chest, aching with a desperate pain.
'At least people do see me, Father,' Draco said, forcing his tone to stay mild. He had no interest in giving his father the satisfaction of knowing anything he said had an impact. 'I wonder sometimes if people even know you're still here. I certainly don't hear mention of you when I go about my day.'
He wondered if what Hermione said could be right, if he was still the Master of Death. If he'd just buried the possibility of it inside layer upon layer of rejection and self-doubt and guilt.
Harry felt the options swirl through him. He tried to be rational and logical and analyse his choices with the detachment he used for his field work … but he kept coming back to how it had felt to unravel - to open up parts of himself he hadn't even known he'd hidden and let them all fly out into the world. How it had felt to stop thinking, stop feeling worried and sad and alone and empty and to be led to the edge of a precipice and be caught once he jumped.
Another memory came to him, James reaching for his bear, cuddling it to himself, rubbing his face against its softness.
Harry shrugged, 'We're friends now … sort of.' He wondered what she would say to that - wondered what Ron would say to that when Hermione told him.
Malfoy looked at him with something like sadness in his eyes, blood dripping down his face. Then he turned on the spot, Disapparating with a crack that echoed around the quiet graveyard.
Harry let out a deep sigh, leaning his head on Draco's shoulder.
Draco spent a sleepless night trying to think about what he wanted to do with the information he now knew. He had to make Potter pay, didn't he? He'd dreamt of bringing Potter down into the dirt alongside him for years.
Parkinson turned up her nose at a kiss with Seamus, claiming she didn't want him groping her the way he had Harry. Seamus, for some reason, hesitated when it came to kissing Zabini. Harry, watching him, as he looked anywhere but at the other man, wondered if it was a case of perhaps wanting too much, more than not.
- of love and its torments.
'My place.'
Draco shrugged, looking away. 'Something I can't say in English.'
Malfoy nods and then nudges the vial closer to him. 'Two drops is the minimum dose. It will last ten minutes.'
'Pet?' Dahlia asked with a patient smile.
The thought tugs at him, that he could just bring Malfoy in now, Auror or not. Ron would happily take the case off his hands. But that would be equivalent to a citizen's arrest. It might get him a pat on the head and a 'good dog,' but it won't get him what he wants: full access back into the Ministry. No, he knows what he will need for that. He'll need to discover every single dodgy thing Malfoy has done in the past ten years, as well as just why the hell he's back in London now.
'You brought me in,' Harry said, remembering Hermione's words.
It was Harry's fourth visit to Reversal before he got a look at the person in the black robes. Just like hunting a Demiguise, the key was thinking of anything except what you wanted. The glimpse Harry got of the face that turned away from him with a look of panic was strangely familiar. The man was almost out the door as Harry reached for his wand and whispered a quick charm, one Ginny had used to deadly effect more than once in the Weasley household. Immediately the black-robed figure's movement slowed, as though he were wading through treacle.
Harry felt shocked, rooted to the spot by the vehemence in his tone and the words he'd just heard. Malfoy's face was dark and certain.
Malfoy nodded then hesitated, looking at Harry fully, holding his gaze properly for the first time since he'd entered the office. 'How are you holding up?' he asked, as though he wasn't sure how his question would be received. 'You look … tired.'
He wanted to put his own initials, to end the lie, but in the end he put
There was a quiet laugh from off to his left and Harry jerked his head around to see Malfoy sitting in the chair behind Ron, leaning it back on two legs. He wore Auror robes that were buttoned sharply and his hair was shaved close to his skull.
'From what we understand,' Jeffries was saying, 'there's another layer within the bar - something we're not seeing. The number of patrons who move in and out of the space is not equivalent to the number we see frequenting the public bar space.'
As they left the stage, Harry looked up at the ceiling, flaring his fingers as he cast the same diagnostic on the room. He caught his breath as delicate webs of magic shimmered to life above him. He recognised faint yellow stands of protection, blue for safety, red for lowering inhibitions. They layered the room - seemed built into the very structure of the building. Suddenly his inability to focus on the reasons this Club was not a good idea made a lot more sense. He bit his lip, looking up at the sparkling lines of red magic. Lowering inhibitions. Letting people admit to their desires … their true wishes. He imagined what it must feel like to be totally honest … totally open … and he felt the last of his concerns over the nature of the Club drain away. This building was created to be a safe space for people to let go. Nothing dark lived here - except the darkness people craved.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes and stood up straighter. He towered over Harry by a good few inches and Harry hated having to look up at him.
At the thought that he's only doing this—only encouraging this—for the case, Harry drops Malfoy's gaze. He wills himself to think about anything but the way he's getting hard over the desire in Malfoy's face. It's Malfoy. He has to keep reminding himself of that. This is all so he can get closer to Malfoy and figure out what he's been up to. None of it is real. It's Malfoy and he's a prat and a suspect and has no idea that Harry is a werewolf. To top it off, the entire reason Harry is feeling anything about him is because of a damned Loyalty Bond Malfoy basically forced him into. None of those things make showing any real interest in him a good idea.
Then Harry grinned and very deliberately swiped a finger over his neck, bringing it to his mouth and sucking it.
because of him. Despite that, he'd returned to the Order to fight in Harry's name. He'd died, trying to get Harry safely away from Voldemort.
-' Mrs. Norris began, but Harry held up a hand to halt her.
Malfoy turns back to him and shakes his head. 'No way. You're taking at least the next day to rest, ideally two.'
He tried to stay around the house, tried to keep Ron's words in mind. He and Ginny talked about small things.
'I was about to order breakfast,' he says. 'If you want something?'
Harry watches him work and marvels at the way he wields his magic, like a scalpel, or a needle, threading where it's needed to do the most damage. Harry's magic is like a club in comparison. He'd offered to just smash through the door, but Malfoy had pointed to the Strength Charms laid into the cross brace that fortified the middle. Then he'd pointed out the additional Severing Charms woven into them.
Harry moves over to join him and Malfoy speaks as though he hasn't just spent fifteen minutes undressing Harry with his eyes.
Draco's eye caught on the window-wall. He noted that Murphy wasn't sitting directly opposite him, and that from the right angle, he would be directly visible through the window. Draco considered it, cocking his head slightly. He
Much, much love.
'What are we doing back here?' Harry asks.
'And do you have any other contact with the outside world?' Murphy asked. 'Aside from the paper, and your few visits?'
'It's not your fault you know,' Ladon said softly, running his fingers lightly over the marked skin.
Harry stood over the empty cot. His eye caught on the movement of the snitches flapping lazily on the blanket Molly had given them when James was born. He swayed gently in place, moving almost unconsciously at the thought of holding James, swaddled in that blanket, rocking back and forth with him, shushing him, singing to him.
,' Malfoy said again. His movements began to speed up and he moaned softly. Harry watched his face, something stirring inside his chest, an unfamiliar heat curling within him as he realised Malfoy was bringing himself off.
Harry doesn't want to be reassured by him. All he can think of is Draco's soft, infinitely vulnerable body beneath his.
Malfoy glanced across the room, then turned to Harry. 'Jenna Rees. She's American. On the board of Ilvermorny. She's here because the Muggle-born education reforms we're suggesting are of great interest to them, and she wants to gather support for a motion back home. She paid ten thousand. Next.'
Harry tried not to react to the way Draco's eyes widened slightly, or the way his gaze dropped - an infinitesimal flicker towards Harry's lips before he pulled his expression into his customarily annoyed scowl.
'Just get the fucking door open. And tie me up with something.'
He slashed at the ropes with a precise Diffindo and they fell away. Harry's arms dropped to his sides but he just curled in on himself, his words becoming louder - enough that Draco could make them out.
. He'd cheated - Ginny was his wife.
'It's not something I hide,' Harry says, answering Malfoy's question. 'But it's not something I've flaunted, either.' He feels anger stir as he considers the journalists who've made his life hell and have ruined so many important things for him over the years. 'The last thing I want is those vultures from the newspapers getting their hands on that knowledge and making a big deal about it.'
He couldn’t tell if the light-headedness he felt now was from the not-sleep he'd had during the dream, the aftereffects of breathing Gillyweed all day or the fact that he'd forgotten to look after himself again.
