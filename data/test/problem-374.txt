“Goody. First order of business, then. Shower’s over. Get dressed and you can give me a piggy-back ride to the dungeons.”
Draco leaned down and ran his tongue slowly along the shell of Harry’s ear, chuckling when Harry shivered. “Ah, I’ll have to remember that spot.” He decided.
Ginny huffed and sat beside him, grabbing a poppy seed muffin. “I just don’t see why you don’t like me! I love you for who you are, Harry! Not many people out there can give you that. Hell, not many people even really
Draco sobbed. "Harry, I think I may die if you don't let me come!" He cried, a tear escaping his eye to roll down over his temple and into his hair.
“Mrs. Malfoy, please stay after class.” Severus called out as the class gathered up their things and handed in the vials of their potion.
“It’s nothing to worry about, Mr. Malfoy, she will be fine. Premature babies are common, especially for firstborns. As long as she doesn’t come
“I just…” Harry sighed. “Damn. I always thought that it was just me, so it didn’t really matter that much, because I’d get by.” He said. “I never thought that the way I grew up would affect my kids.”
Harry snorted. “Oh, very funny. Man, I’m hungry. I want fish.” He frowned at Draco. “And I don’t even
Harry licked his lips in anticipation as Draco tied the blindfold around his eyes, then he heard Draco muttering as he tied his own blindfold, not trusting Harry to spare his hair.
Harry hummed, still smiling. “Fine. I’ll just wank.” He said lightly, standing up and stripping off his trousers.
Draco grinned widely. “Mother changed my name three times before I was born. It’s not a problem if you change your mind, we’ll pick something else. There are plenty of options.”
Harry was irritated, tired, annoyed, in a bit of pain, and had been ridiculed and humiliated more than he had anticipated, plus he
Draco rolled his eyes. He sat up and faced Nott. “You can kiss and touch. But the boxers will stay on, and you can’t touch under them. Fair?”
Draco sighed and rolled onto his side, tracing idle fingers over Harry’s stomach. “Well, I suppose we
Harry sighed, grabbing a bagel, and putting ridiculous amounts of cream cheese on it. “I know, Gin. And I’m grateful for all the support you’ve always given me, but I’m going to need it especially
Draco smirked. “I kissed a bloke, and it made me incredibly hard. Why? Think you may be queer? If I help you out, you’d have to keep it quiet.” The blond explained seriously. “And I’ll only let you kiss me, and you can touch me, but no touching the bits or my ass. Those are off limits.”
Harry laughed. “Well, the male orgasm is more powerful, and shorter. It also centres around the cock, specifically. The
“I thought you’d like it. But I’m getting a bit tired. We need to rest for now. Dinner, elemental training, a snack, then bed?” Draco asked, flushing a bit.
'Maybe.' Harry thought, looking back down at his charms essay. 'Hey, what was the first rule of creating new charms?'
Pomfrey smiled. “I want to see her every week, on Saturdays, to assess her blood pressure and the baby’s health. What she has right now is preeclampsia. It necessitates a closer watch on her health and Carina’s. You may take her to your rooms now. I will see you both Saturday.”
“Our marks. We’ll find them tomorrow morning. For now, let’s sleep.” He said, pulling off his blindfold, then Harry’s.
His tongue had grown in both width and length, and Harry was finally able to lay it flat over Draco's prostate, sliding it over his prostate unrelentingly, his fist tight around the base of Draco's cock, preventing him from coming from the stimulation.
Fred nodded. “You have my word. George and I will keep absolute silence. Can I?” He asked, looking at Draco’s wings.
Draco stopped eating, and turned to Harry, setting his fork down. ‘Who and what are you meaning to tell, exactly?’ He asked, totally confused by the abrupt change of topic.
The blond laughed, putting the pillow back where it belonged. “Not much, really. I have Quidditch practice, but that’s pretty much it.”
disgusts me, I will speak to Albus on your behalf and procure you both a room together. Merlin forbid Potter wake up in the Slytherin dorms. They’ll tear him apart before they deliver the pieces to the Dark Lord.” Severus drawled.
the magic itself! I suddenly was able to just grab the energies and force them where I wanted them. It wasn’t very
No, if this worked, Harry needed to know. Even if it meant Draco’s marriage would produce only one heir and might be doomed to dissolution or divorce in the end. He couldn’t lie to Harry after all the trust he was being given.
Severus smirked. "Ah, yes. The cleaning spell gone horribly wrong. I was quite impressed with that story myself." He reminisced.
Draco quickly worked him open, then lubed himself and slid in, both teens moaning at the feeling. “Merlin, you always feel so good around me.” Draco said, hands grasping his hips and gently urging him to move.
Harry chuckled and quickly worked Draco's school robe off his shoulders. He paused afterwards to kiss the blond slowly, letting his tongue fully explore the warm cavern that was Draco's mouth before his hands continued undressing his husband.
orgasm is felt throughout the entire body, and seems to come in waves, but it’s a little subtler than the male orgasm is. It’s not quite as… Um…
Draco gasped, throwing his head back. “I think I may have a tiny idea.” The Vanteera panted, perfectly happy to let Harry have his way, content in the knowledge that they’d always have each other.
"Just more proof that I'm doomed to have an unconventional life." Harry joked. "Now, come on. Dinner's in half an hour, let's get cleaned up."
Severus nodded as Harry took the vial from him. “However, you must be sure you take it before anything should happen to it. I neglected to write down the recipe, and will be unable to replace that dose. It is the only chance you have of going back.” He warned.
there is going to be?!” He asked, gesturing to his cock. “I’m hardly going to have a pussy that day!”
Draco let Nott lay him down, still kissing him, and arched as Nott’s hand slipped under his shirt and brushed a fingertip over a nipple. “Ah.” Draco moaned softly.
Draco took a deep breath, trying to ease his aching hard-on, then slid inside Harry in one fluid motion, making him cry out in pained pleasure as he grabbed hold of Draco’s shoulders. Draco smirked. “Hold on, Love.” He whispered. “The real fun starts now.”
, giving the plants less time to soak, which was what released their deadly poisons into the potion.
He got to Snape’s chambers to find the man standing outside the door, waiting for him. “Late, Potter. Why do you insist on wasting my time?”
Draco chuckled. "I don't think there's anything in this world that can stop it if you actually fuck me now." He told Harry.
Draco smiled slowly, nodding. “I know. Descended from fallen angels. And rare.” his smile faded. “But you can’t tell anyone. If the Dark Lord finds out, I’ll be in more danger then you’d ever believe. He’d be after
Harry waited until the blond came back with his bag of makeup and gave him a smile. “Thank you, Draco.” He walked over to stand in front of the mirror and applied his makeup.
it will be! Two weeks before the due date is when the baby’s lungs will be fully developed, so it’s perfectly safe for the baby to be a little early. These things do happen.” She assured them.
Draco’s hand fell over Harry’s as Harry was about to turn, and Draco finally spoke. “There’s nothing to think about.” He said softly.
“I like you, as I’ve made very clear to you. You like me, or else you wouldn’t try to become my fantasy you while in my head. So, where do we go from here? We both want the same thing, looks like.” Harry said simply.
? Why are you with Draco Malfoy? Why are you pretending to be a girl?” Remus asked, pulling away from Harry. “Are you
?" Draco purred, sending Harry a mental picture of him kneeling at Draco's feet, hands tied behind his back. He was sucking Draco off, and the blond had both hands fisted in Harry's hair as he thrust in and out of Harry's mouth furiously.
Draco growled and thrust up against Harry once, then rolled out of bed. “Then you’ll be dealing with
Draco frowned. “Hm. I thought you were taking aloud. This could be handy.” He decided, perking up with interest.
Nott nodded. He pulled Draco’s shirt off, throwing it onto the floor. He then reached for Draco’s trousers.
Draco frowned as he puzzled over what Harry had meant, then his eyes widened, and he got up. He chased down the brunet and stopped him in the hall outside the Slytherin dorms. “What are you
Narcissa sat down across the table from Celeste. “Darling, Draco just showed up at the door, he’s insisting that we give you up for the rest of the day. Pansy and Millicent have promised to make sure all your gifts make it to your bedroom in your absence.”
.” He sneered. “Allow me to demonstrate.” He said, standing and pulling his shirt off. He thought of his wings coming into view and smirked at the shock on both Harry and Fred’s faces as they saw his black feathered wings for the first time.
Draco rolled his eyes. “How many times are you going to ask me that before you accept the fact that I
Draco left the room, and as he left, he heard Dumbledore say to one of the portraits, “Well, Phineas, looks like your Slytherins are certainly planning to build their numbers, aren’t they?”
They crossed the house, Celeste taking in the surroundings as they walked. The house was beautiful, but most of it was an understated elegance, not a brash flaunting of wealth like Malfoy Manor, but rather a quiet assertation that whoever lived here was well-to-do, for sure, but didn’t need to scream it to the heavens.
Draco's eyes widened as he felt a new constriction around his cock. "Did you just spell a cock-ring onto me?" He asked suspiciously.
Draco eyes lit up. “I could kiss her right now. Put that on. Then, I’m going to take it off of you. With my teeth.” He purred.
corrupt, I prefer to keep your goodness and generosity as they are. If I didn’t like you the way you are now, I would not have married you.” He ushered her out. “Let’s check out the pool.”
anyone.” He shot back, putting the toothbrush back. He could have just used a spell, but the physical act of brushing them made them feel somehow cleaner. Besides, he needed the time to work up his courage, since Slytherins didn’t have much to speak of.
.” He murmured, then muttered a string of words under his breath, tracing an intricate pattern over the door.
"I may have found a solution for the toxic properties of permanent Polyjuice: Rose hips. Unfortunately, I have not the resources to afford experimenting with such a valuable ingredient. If you still want a cure-"
“Time for the bath. We are supposed to wash each other, carefully, taking the time to memorize each other’s bodies.” He told Harry. “I’ll wash you first.”
Severus sighed. “Dumbledore made the decision, not me.” He said. “As well as the decision to leave him there in the first place.”
Draco brought her to the gates and keyed her into the Wards. “There. You're officially welcome here. Now, the grounds are extensive, and there are deer in our forest, but you can explore them and the gardens on your own. The house is more pressing.” He led her up the few steps to the front door and let her in.
“Why should I go out and look for someone else when I’ve got a perfect option right here already?” He asked, leering down at Draco, one hand teasingly slipping under the bottom of the boxers, fingers brushing his inner thigh.
Harry felt the smugness and elation increase dramatically from Draco, and he rolled his eyes. 'That's all he needs. A bigger ego.'
Draco looked up at the tentative query to see Celeste in his doorway, biting her lip and fiddling with her skirt. “Dray, I’m sorry. I was being irrational and… Well, I’ve been thinking. I can’t tell Molly who I am, she’s loyal to Dumbledore to a fault, and she’d tell him, but…
Nott scowled, holding him down with a hand firmly planted in the center of Draco’s chest. “No.” He said sharply. “I’m not done.”
“Thank you, Madam Pomfrey.” Celeste said, staring rapturously down at her brand new daughter. “For everything.”
Harry looked around, seeing the others shooting him smiles and nods as they made their way down to the great hall. They never broke formation, Harry and Draco remaining unseen while the whole group managed not to step on each other's feet or stumble.
“But you can teach me how to access mine.” Draco said eagerly. “You, Sev, and Dumbledore are the only people strong enough, and I don’t think Dumbledore and Sev are in a safe position to be firing curses at me from, being teachers, and all.”
Draco smirked smugly. “No one does, but you come the closest. I’m a Malfoy, after all. I will only accept the cream of the crop, and you, my sexy mate, are by far the creamiest of them all.”  Draco said huskily.
Blaise set the book in front of him, pushing his char back and running his hands nervously through his hair. “Dear
Harry merely smirked and used his newly freed hand to pull Draco's hands above his head and pin them there. "Don't you like it?" He asked. "I'm going to fuck you hard, and fast, and I'm going to fill you with my come. And
He doesn’t know what keeps him from telling Draco, aside from the paralyzing fear his love is unrequited. Draco goes on a few dates here and there, never really bringing anyone home until last week. Some bloke Harry’d never met spent the night, Harry cast a silencing charm on his walls that night and couldn’t meet Draco's eyes the next morning. He’d been skillfully avoiding him for a week now, at home, at work and even at all their meals. Pansy suggests they go out for coffee, just the two of them, and Harry agrees unaware of the confrontation coming his way.
As it begins to get dark, and after the thestrals have eaten all their supply the boys start to walk back to the castle. And if their hands brush a few times, and Harry’s heartbeat picks up a little, no one needs to know that. “Think you could help me study for potions sometime next week?” Harry asks as they reach the hall that leads to their respective dorms. “Only if you help me with my defense essay,” Draco replies smoothly as they reach the portrait. When they enter the eighth year common room, they see a bit of a foreign sight. Pansy Parkinson sitting with Neville, not just sitting with him, laughing with him seeming to ignore the studying they had to do.
Often they’d help each other with assignments and things. Draco helped with potions, Harry with Defense against the Dark arts as he had a lot of Remus’ old notes left to him in his will, and Neville with Herbology. Hermione helped with basically everything. Before they knew it it was halloween, and the feast had begun. It didn’t feel like it’d been six months since, since it happened. It had been though, and looking back Harry thinks he’s grown tremendously.
“They’re incredibly kind animals. Luna and I go visit them from time to time, they like raw beef a lot.” Draco looks at him for a second before standing up, holding his hand out to Harry, who takes it and is pulled up. “Where in the hell do I get raw beef?” Harry chuckles at the question and picks up his bag. “The kitchens,” he starts to lead the way.
The blonde boy laughs lightly and tucks a curl behind Harry’s ear. His mind goes back to that time in the common room, when Draco had pulled him into his chest. This time though, this time Draco pulls him in and kisses him, gently at first and then Harry feels his tongue asking for permission and can’t help but grant it. Eventually they have to break apart to breathe and rest their foreheads together, before they break out laughing.
A few months later, about a month before school starts and he’ll head back to Hogwarts, not as a student but as a professors assistant, someone comes barreling down the stairs. ”Harry! Harry!” The person yells and he recognizes it as Draco and meets him and the bottom of the stairs, Draco nearly falls and Harry catches him. “Slughorn wrote me back! He said he picked me to study under him!” Draco says, so excited he could burst and Harry embraces him. “I’m so proud of you! That’s so great, Draco!” Harry’s equally excited, for a few selfish reasons.
It's sometime in March when Harry can't sleep, not that it's surprising, he hasn't ever truly slept well. The trauma of the war made it worse, elevated his nightmares so he'd wake up screaming. Tonight it was one of his reoccurring dreams, watching Sirius fall through the veil followed by Remus jumping in after him. All he could do was stand and watch, tears streaming down his face, and then the dream changed. He was back in the forbidden forest, the spot he had died but Voldemort was nowhere to be seen.
They take his, formerly Sirius’, motorcycle to a diner Draco absolutely adores. They get breakfast for dinner, french toast and coffee. They talk about everything and nothing the entire time, it’s the best date Harry has ever been on. They hold hands as they walk through the muggle streets, headed to a music shop. Harry buys Draco a few CD’s and they kiss in the back corner like teenagers.
Somehow, he’d actually managed to pull of an O on his Defense NEWT. Harry and his friends were sitting in the living room at Grimmauld place a week after school when the results came in. Somehow, Harry’s home became home to all eight of them, there was more than enough room. Ginny and Luna shared a room, Ron and Hermione shared a room and other than that everyone had their own. Kreacher had passed out the mail, Ron ripping into his immediately and the others following his lead.
When they walk into the portrait out thirty house elves surround them, asking what they need. “Kreacher is Harry Potters elf! Not you!” Kreacher yells over them and pushes his way to the front. “Hey Kreach, you doin well today?” Harry asks and let’s Kreacher lead him and Draco to the other side of the room. “Much better now that you’re here Harry! Kreacher has become very accustomed to seeing you every day over the summer, Kreacher does miss you!” Harry chuckles and digs in his bag for a moment before pulling out a bag of taffy, Kreacher favorite they’d discovered.
As their first term begins to wind to a close, Harry realizes he hasn’t given his presents to his friends he won’t see over the break yet. Course he’ll be seeing Ron and most likely Hermione. It’s a few days before they leave when he starts passing out presents. He’d gotten Luna a muggle mp3 player as shed liked his CD player so much, Neville a herbology book he’d noticed he rereads a million times from the library, Pansy a small jewelry box and they’d all appreciated them very much. The last gift, for Draco he’s held on to until today. They hadn’t hung out alone in quite a while and he wants to see his reaction.
“I’d wanted to free him a million times truthfully, but” He cuts himself off and readjusts his bag on his shoulder. “Your father?” Harry asks, Draco just nods gently. He just hums in agreement. Before he knows it they’re at the thestrals grounds. A small one, couldn’t be more than a month old, walks up to them on shaky legs, Harry gives him a small cut of beef. His favorite one, though he’d never admit it, was actually the one that brought him to the castle all those years ago. Luna had named her Florence for some reason, Florence walks over to him now and nuzzles his hand as he pets her. “Hey sweet girl,” Harry whispers.
“He brought home a bloke and I just,” He looks down at his hands. “I’m so utterly jealous I feel like vomiting or crying and I don’t know what to do,” he lets out in almost a whisper. Pansy kicks him under the table. “You idiot!” Harry looks offended, Pansy just laughs in exasperation.
The small one had taken quite a liking to Draco, walking between his legs and nearly knocking him over. Draco sits down to avoid falling and allows the baby to crawl into his lap and feeds him an apple. Harry sits next to him, Florence laying next to him, now nuzzling his thigh. Harry takes Draco's wrist gently and lays it on her nose. Draco smiles at her. “This is Florence,” Draco chuckles at that. “Luna named her I’m guessing?” Florence nips an apple from their bag. “Luna names all of them, I can only ever remember Florence though. Took me to the ministry that night, heh, nearly bit Dumbledore cause she wanted to take me back too.” Draco hums and pulls away from Florence gently.
The last day of testing is a week before school ends, a Friday and he ends his test at around 4 in the afternoon. His group of friends finished their tests before him and were sitting in the corridor outside of his potions classroom waiting for him. Luna was tucked into Ginny's side reading a book, upside down of course, Ginny lightly dozing with her head against the wall. Ron and Hermione sat facing each other with a card game spread out in front of them. Pansy and Neville sat on the far end of the group sharing earbuds and listening to Lunas mp3 player. Draco was the first to notice him, looking up from his sketch book and nudged Ginny. "Harry! You did it!" Ron cheers and Harry laughs. "We have a surprise for everyone," Luna says and Ginny smiles pulling the basket that sat next to her into her lap. They'd planned a picnic.
They had sort of kept their agreement to become friends, him and Draco. It was difficult, a lot of history filled with hurt. One day Harry can look back and think of the day it changed, the day it clicked into place. Sometime in early October, as it was getting cold, he could feel the winter coming, Harry had wandered down to the lake. He’d enjoyed how quiet it was, how no curious first years found him here, he’d sit with his back against a tree and study. That’s exactly what he’d done today, he was finishing up his latest essay for DADA when someone came and sat next to him, out of his peripheral he saw that it was Draco. They sit in relative silence until he finishes his essay, rolling the parchment and shoving it into his bag, he leans back against the tree.
“Hello, Draco. Celeste.” Remus said in a friendly but wary voice. “Why did you want to meet with me?”
“Does it ever seem like time’s moving really slowly to you? I mean, I already feel like I’ve been pregnant forever.” Harry murmured.
not! She needs enough time to plan how she wants to look when she comes here, and that takes at least forty-eight hours.” He said evenly.
Harry broke the kiss, gasping as a fierce heat burned through him. He groaned as Draco jumped off his lap, kneeling on the floor in front of him, worried.
Harry smiled, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist. “Let’s not tell them. I like having something no one else has. The dungeons are for the Slytherins alone.” He whispered, taking Draco’s earlobe between his teeth and tugging on it gently.
Draco chuckled, closing his book. “Well, then, let’s head to the kitchens and indulge your strange pregnancy cravings, shall we?” He asked, standing and stretching. “Get your makeup on, Mrs. Malfoy, we’re about to venture into the open again.” He teased, as Harry headed over to his mirror.
Draco groaned. And there was the Weaslette. A lover’s spat. What were they doing at Hogwarts in the beginning of June? They’d only spent a week at home.
Draco grimaced, gesturing at the books around him. “Theory. Need to know what I’m doing, after all.”
Draco cleared his throat, staring at the ground as he landed carefully. “You know I do. I’m just nervous, is all.”
Unfortunately, Draco quickly noticed what his hair was up to and stopped to use a quick charm. His hair fell straight, looking as though he had just combed it.
Harry smirked. “It is.” He agreed. “There’s something else even cozier that I’m particularly fond of.” He said teasingly.
“Harry, you need to listen to these next words very carefully, and as soon as I finish speaking, you need to initiate a kiss to seal the bonding.” Draco panted, never breaking rhythm with his thrusting.
old enough to know better than to marry again. But her parents saw how rich he was and little else, and decided to ensure her fortune while they had the chance. With his money and her looks, she’s set for life.”
Just as Harry thinks Draco is done, Draco turns to Harry. “I know that we have made amends, but I have not apologized to you, Harry. I was cruel to you from the day I met you, trying to drag you into pureblood elitist bullshit. I- I hated being your rival, I really did. I am deeply sorry for everything I did to you, and I am so glad we’re friends now. I wish, I wish I had come to you when I needed help back then, I see now you could have and would have. I was just so scared for my family, for myself and thanks to you, all of you,” Draco looks at Ron, Hermione and Neville and then back at Harry.
At some point their conversation had turned to the future, something they’d never actually spoken of before. Ginny was going to be trying out for the Holyhead Harpies, she was after all the best chaser Hogwarts had seen in decades. Luna dreamed of being a magizoologist, Hermione a healer, Ron an auror, which left Neville and Harry, neither of which had shared yet.
Harry tells Draco he loves him for the first time on the thestrals grounds, with Florences head on his lap, hearing her soft snores. Draco decides they should share a room one day in the three broomsticks. Eventually everyone moves out of Grimmauld except for them. “We should move,” Harry says quietly over breakfast one day, seemingly thinking to himself. Draco looks up at him, curious. “This house is too big,” Harry starts to explain. “I don’t think we need all this space for the two of us till we start a family.” Draco gapes at him. “You want a family with me?” He asks quietly and Harry meets his eyes with a smile. “My love, I want everything with you.”
“Bloody hell,” comes from Neville. “I kicked arse!” Neville yells after that, the room going from tense to filled with laughter. Draco gets an O in potions to no one surprise, Luna an O in her magical creatures Newt, Hermione got an O in well, everything. Harry hasn’t opened his yet, he finds his hands shaking and Luna sits next to him. Harry hands it to her in a silent plea for her to open it for him and she does, hands it back with a smile. “Harry?” Draco asks softly from his seat across the room, Harry looks up and smiles. “I got an O.”
For the first time in Harry’s life at Hogwarts, he hadn’t been fighting for his life and he actually had time, he had the will to study. Turns out Harry James Potter wasn’t just the boy who lived, he was bloody bright. Not only was he passing his classes, he was sailing through them, working his tail off and for once wasn’t behind. It felt like his first normal year here.
Harrys jaw hangs open a bit, he thinks. He doesn’t know. “I’m sorry did you just say James?” Is all that can come out of his mouth. “Yes, James Potter. He was my student, as well as his friends Sirius, Remus and” The professor blanks. “Well, the other one. I forget his name. Quite trouble makers those four, Remus though, boy always had a knack for this class. Not surprised he ended up teaching it.” Harry’s heart hurts at the mention of Remus and Sirius.
“Harry as much as I adore this job, this place, I am getting old and I would very much like to retire one day, as would I like to trust the hands I give this classroom to.” Harry smiles at this. “Professor, may i ask, what did you do the two years before you could apply as a professor?” He inquires, setting his bag down on the floor next to him and sitting on the table. “I studied under my old professor actually. My, you’re very serious about this job aren’t you?” Sickawell sits across from him. “I am yes. Do you think, if it’s not too much trouble, you would consider letting me study under you?” The Professor seems to consider this for a moment. “Absolutely my boy. Who better to take my place than someone that actually knows how to fight these things we teach?” Harry chuckles lightly. “If you need any help studying for your NEWT, just let me know alright? After all, all those years ago I did tutor James into a passing grade miraculously.”
That night he dreamt he was sitting on a bench in a small church, watching Malfoy getting married with a girl he couldn’t see. And when he tried to talk, snakes would come out of his mouth, without making any sound.
“Don’t worry, I will not harm any muggles.”- Said Malfoy- “And I can’t go around talking about it, someone might steal our idea. His idea. According to Andromeda he is quite smart but has had bad luck with all his business ideas.”
“You know, working as always. Making the wizarding world a better place, law by law.”- Said Ron. – “I’m happy for her, but I miss her. I think I’m becoming more jealous of Shacklebolt everyday”
“Sybill, there you are!”- interrupted McGonagall. - “You predicted the death of a first-year student, when did you even found the time to do that? Now he is crying at Filius’ office. He won’t listen to us, come and try to calm him.”
“Apologies for letting him wake you up. He is fine now.”- said Kreacher, changing Teddy’s nappy. - “I’ll leave you both alone, now”- he said, as he leaved the room.
“You don’t have to apologize, you did nothing wrong, dear.” -said Molly.- “And Andromeda and Teddy are always welcome in our home.”
“I don’t care about that. Draco, my son. You must marry Astoria Greengrass.” Said Lucius. He took Narcissa’s hand and reached for Draco’s, but he pulled away in fear. It has been long since he had been afraid of his father.
“Yes, I will…Although, it is unusual you forget something that involves the kids, even with all your work. Maybe there is something else in your mind.” He said, looking at Viktor.
As soon as he was done with his last class of the day, McGonagall enter his classroom and told him to meet her as soon as possible in her office. The headmistress office. He went there and tried to ignore the changes of the room. It still felt a bit like Dumbledore, but it was a hundred percent McGonagall’s. He couldn’t explain, but the office was more serious.
Harry received many letters from his friends, worried rambles about Malfoy living in his house. Molly Weasley was concerned about Malfoy really taking Grimmauld Place from Harry, on the argument of old family relations. Hermione reassured them that it was not legal in any way.
At 6:08 pm he was knocking at Malfoy Manor. The last time he was there, neither he nor his friends had a particularly nice time. But Malfoy had lie for him. They still need to talk about that. Did Malfoy wanted to protect them?
By Thursday Harry had already talked with all of his students. Most of them felt less intimidated by Harry. They could see that he was making an effort at talking with both professors and students. He was trying. And he still gave them homework, which was annoying, if you ask them.
“You don’t speak French, stop doing those noises.” Said Harry, who was starting to get dizzy because of his friends’ conversation in french. It had nothing to do with the fact that harry was drunk.
Harry could see it. Malfoy as a kid, playing with a chocolate wand, running in his manor, believing he was so talented. His mother encouraging him. He imagines teddy playing like that too, with Malfoy and Andromeda.
One of the American men that Andromeda meet went to England to spend a couple of days with her. Draco and Ron took care of Teddy during those days. Ron was out working during the day, so it was Draco who spend more time with him. Still, Teddy changed his hair to match Ron’s.
“There is no antidote for true love! Should I write a letter of resignation? Maybe McGonagall would understand my feelings.”
well, muggle kids prefer video games over dolls now. Either way, muggle toy-making is very advanced these days.”
"Hello, Harry. We haven’t meet yet. My name is Apollonia Lufkin, I am the Head of Hufflepuff House and the Muggle studies professor." – She said.
They go to a little muggle shop next to Pansys tattoo parlor, she’d become a full time tattoo artist and she was bloody good at it. Once they’re seated Pansy stares him down with her infamous Parkinson glare. “Okay, what exactly did I do to deserve your wrath?” Harry asks over his cup and she furrows his brow. “You know exactly what you’re doing, Harry,” Pansy starts and Harry must look confused because she rolls her eyes. “You’ve been avoiding and ignoring Draco all week!” Shit. Shit shit shit. Harry really thought no one had noticed. “Want to offer a solid reason for your sudden acting like a prat?” Harry sighs and sets down his coffee. “Only if this conversation never leaves this building,” he says and Pansy scowls but nods.
Distantly Harry feels someone sit next to him and shakes him out of his thoughts. He’s sitting outside the Weasleys newly built borough, feeling a bit too empty and quiet without Fred. Soft damp grass is between his toes, under his bare feet and he sighs. Ginny knocks her elbow against his and he finally looks over at her. “Doin alright there?” Harry smiles gently at her. After they’d won, a few months ago now, Ginny had pulled him aside and explained that losing Fred made her see how short life is, and how she didn’t want to spend a second of it not loving Luna. Harry had hugged her then, and now she rests her head on his shoulder. “I don’t know to tell you the truth,” he says after a few beats pass. ”Tell me about it?” And it’s soft, gentle and not demanding, Harry feels safe and warm so he does. He explains how not having a prophecy to fulfill anymore feels odd, how he doesn’t know who he his, and how he doesn’t want to fight anymore.
He’d gotten Draco a new sketchbook, leather bound along with a few CD’s of Draco’s newly discovered favorite muggle band. Tonight though, it was a Saturday and it seemed everyone had plans except them, he’d have gone to see Teddy but Andromeda has taken him on a vacation for Christmas. The common room was blissfully empty tonight, Harry was snuggled into a comfy chair by the fire and reading until Draco came back. He’d said something about helping Luna with an assignment but he’d be by the common room later.
As much as Harry had hated his easy recognizability, the expectations of the entire wizarding world on his shoulders, he found himself wanting to go back. Not because he wanted a war, merlin no, he never wanted a war. Harry wanted to go back for one reason, one simple reason. He knew who he was then. The chosen one, the boy who lived, the savior of the wizarding world. What was he now? A hero, they tell him. The next best Auror. Harry’s stomach feels sick at the thought of another fight. Being an Auror, well it meant he’d be fighting the rest of his life wouldn’t he? He’s been fighting for eighteen years, he doesn’t suppose he can do it any longer, he doesn’t want to.
It had only taken one to proposition Harry. And then next thing I knew, we were desperately kissing in the elevator up to his room, clothes shrugged off as soon as the door clicked closed.
If Draco could make him lose himself in the footwork and the notes of the accordion, what would he be like in bed? Would he be domineering, filling all of Harry’s senses as he filled him? Would he be slow, each caress driving Harry to madness, or rough and passionate? He needed to know.
He felt nauseous again. His instincts told him that Malfoy truly believed he was doing the right thing, but Harry wasn’t sure if he could trust his instincts. Not anymore.
It was the complete opposite of the pureblood estates he knew. Even when Malfoy Manor had been destroyed, the foundation had been strong. The sprawling estate had been modernised with successive generations, but all additions were made to match the style of the original facade. This house looked like it was held up entirely by magic, with odd angles and some rooms jutting out atop the floor below.
“He’ll be sworn to secrecy, and we can trust him. Actually, we need him more than anyone else in the Order because of his position,” Harry interjected.
Harry spotted Neville across the room, raising an eyebrow and flicking his eyes between Harry and his choice of partner. Harry’s face flushed, and he wondered if his smile was as dopey as he felt.
Draco regretted that he had to stay silent and couldn’t point out that he didn’t know where east was. He hated that he could only wait until Blaise gave further instructions and hope time didn’t run out. This wait was the most nerve-wracking part of every heist.
“Asmodeus Malfoy. Draco’s great uncle. His mother was also a Black. He signed everything Asmo and I guess it stuck,” Neville explained, shrugging.
All the other rooms look down on me.  Not literally, of course. They just think they get all the good gossip: the bedroom hears the Masters’ nighttime secrets, the sitting room their public conversations, and the entryway always knows first who is visiting.
It’s not that I think he’s cheating on me, or anything crazy like that. I love him and he loves me; his parents and friends are just going through rough patches and they need him too. And I understand and respect that, but
“Hey darling!” Neville cried out and giggled, stumbling towards and throwing his arms around the taller, dark-skinned man. The contrast between the couple was striking: Neville’s boyish, rough charm in an outfit that had seen better days, and Zabini’s tailored topcoat and suit, closely cropped hair, and angular face.
“We went ice skating on our first date. We both knew we’d enjoy it so it was relaxing, and we both got to lean into our competitive sides and show off.”
He had expected a refusal and started when he felt a hand on his wrist as Draco turned the straw to take a sip.
It had been years since he’d seen Harry in Quidditch leathers, and he cast an appreciative eye over how the bracers accentuated the lean muscle of Harry’s arms. Harry usually pushed his sleeves up to his elbows, so Draco had fantasised many times about licking a line up those forearms. He hadn’t thought they’d be as sexy covered, but...
We’ve been married for years now, and I still wonder how I got so lucky with my choice of a life partner.  He is so playful and passionate, and it’s all wrapped in a beautiful body.  Our childhood insults have evolved into gentle teasing.  He smiles now instead of smirks.
“Then it’s fine. I won’t even ask you to come watch me play. That doesn’t matter to me. Wait… fuck… let me be clear: you’re more than welcome to come, but it’s fine if you don’t want to.”
Draco pulled his trousers down, then grasped Harry’s legs to pull them over his arms so the head of his cock would brush the rim, stretched and leaking from the previous spells.
body. And he stepped forward until he was in his space and the smile was slowly falling from James’ mouth, his eyes darkening. He tentatively closed the distance, their frosty breath mingling, and hummed as their lips brushed together.
“And that right there is why. The thief creates doubt that they might not be so bad. That’s only one of four artefacts returned. What about the amulet? Or the griffin brooch?” Wong, the second-in-command of the DMLE, joined the conversation.
When they arrived at London, his friends were waiting for them. There was Ron, his parents, Draco and Teddy and even Hermione. Luna and Ginny arrived a little late. There was also Neville’s grandmother, who was accompanied by professor Marchbancks, the old lady who had administer Harry’s O.W.L.s. She was talking with Hermione when Harry got out of the train, and he got to see Ron’s expression of pure boredom. There were a lot of hugs and congratulations. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley invited everyone to the Burrow to celebrate both Harry and Neville.
“No.”- said Malfoy. - “You can use veritaserum if you want. Although you must know, I am good at occlemency.”
In the short time Draco had been living in there, he was sure that at least on two occasions he saw a Weasley outside the house, he wasn’t sure who, though. Andromeda had to promise the Weasleys she would keep an eye on Draco, since Harry wasn’t going to spend too much time on his house.
“You are getting annoying. Get over yourself. All of us are stronger than what you did to us with your jealousy bullying. If we are going to be friends, you need to at least be able to have a civilized conversation with my friends.”
“What have you done to my son?”- asked George from afar, pretending to be offended. He came closer and took Fred from Ron, but by the time he calmed his son, Dominique was already crying.
“You are so thoughtful… I was thinking you accepted the job because you missed me.”- This was clearly meant as a joke, still, Harry’s words sounded sincere. Harry noticed his own tone. Draco also noticed. Harry noticed that Draco noticed. - “I was kidding, I know I’m not that good of a friend.”
Draco spent two weeks as a white ferret. Most of the time he stayed with the Weasleys. Arthur and Percy were the only ones concerned about possible side effects of Draco being transfigured for so long. They were thinking about Pettigrew. But they still enjoyed watching Draco being tormented by their family. Even Molly, discretely, casted some spells at him. Draco also spent some days with Ginny and Luna.
“What should I wear?” -Asked Harry, suddenly concerned. The Malfoys are still rich, would they have a fancy party? He doesn’t have fancy clothes, at least there wouldn’t be many people and andromeda will be there, it will be easier.
“Doing great. Whenever Andromeda shows him a picture of you, he just points and smiles. When we mention your name, he asks “where?”. If you want, we could bring him here for you to see him. Well, not
Hogwarts won that game. It was a relief to those who still were upset about Durmstrang’s policies of admission. Which was most of the students.
Teddy latter noticed that Professor Fawley wasn’t a fan of muggles. She had no problem with muggle-borns, since they were first of all wizards and witches, the issue was with muggles. Also, she didn’t agree with her students that genetics as a science was impressive. “Muggles wasting their time”, she said it was. “Why try to change nature?” Teddy stopped liking her and decided Professor Longbottom was his new favourite. He also kept that from Harry and Draco.
Harry focused on changing the subject when she began to thank him, he made everyone talk about Teddy again. He complimented Andromeda, and he mostly tried to ignore Lucius. And he kept following Draco’s discreet directions on how to eat “properly”.
The next day, McGonagall wasn’t there, so it was Professor Flitwick who introduced the headmistress of Beauxbatons to the students. the younger ones were impressed by her size. Both the students and the rest of the professors learned that McGonagall was at Durmstrang and that Olympe Maxime was going to be a guest teacher at Hogwarts for a week. Then the headmaster of Koldovstoretz would do the same, and then the headmaster of Durmstrang.
Neither of them knew how to go from there. What could they say to each other? It was an abrupt conversation that took them both by surprise. Both of them knew that they should be on better terms, if anything just for Teddy’s sake. Harry spoke first.
“Friday is the only day I work until 7pm.”- said Harry. Draco thought he sounded disappointed. - “Who are you teaching first?”
Harry and Hermione were playing with Teddy. The toddler was mostly showing them all the teddy bears he had. Draco and Ron were playing chess, so they were not paying attention to Teddy, which seemed to upset him.
“Percy was actually a good roommate, back in Hogwarts, so I don’t think he would be such a bad husband. Even if Penelope doesn’t agree with that” -Said Oliver, smiling at Percy.
“What does that mean?”- asked Harry. He felt cold sweat coming from his forehead, his hands were numb. Everything was wrong.
“I didn’t pay much attention to other students. My focus was mainly on you. But I think Neville knows what he is doing, if you worry about him, go talk to Abbott and get to know her better.”
The next day, Draco woke up in his bed, wearing the same clothes he had on yesterday. He glanced at Teddy who was still sleeping. Then he turned to his right to find a fully clothed Harry Potter who was facing towards him. Both of them had been talking all night. At some point, they fell asleep in the same bed.
“Teddy, you know that I’m a little famous in the wizarding world. And sometimes there are articles about me in the papers and magazines your granny likes to read…”
It was already dark when they arrived at Hogwarts. McGonagall just patted them on their shoulders and went to her office. Sir Nicholas appeared and seemed to want to talk with Harry, but he didn’t. He just stayed there in the hallway looking at the two professors leave to their rooms. Harry went to Draco’s room so they could keep talking. Harry sat on Draco’s bed and Draco sat on the chair of his desk.
“Viktor! It’s nice seeing you.” Said Harry as a greeting. He was approaching with Draco, and two kids running behind them.
Having Olympe Maxime watching over his classes turned out to be a new kind of stress for Harry. He was afraid of making a mistake in front of her. He did fine, according to Hagrid, and he wasn’t even being evaluated. Harry also learned that Draco tried to impress her the entire week and Neville gave her little tasks or asked her questions related to his class.
“Finally.” he said, smiling. “Honestly Draco, it took you so long. Harry here had to deal with your rejection, I was getting mad at you. I know we are friends now, but I was ready to trash you for how sad Harry was over you…”
“Never say something like that in front of him.” – Harry said, smiling even more. - “Oh, I almost forgot.”- he called for Teddy to come and sit next to them. - “Would you tell Mr. Weasley about what your computer class professor told you?”
“He liked it, it’s the lion king. He’ just tired of all the fun he’s had. thanks for your interest.”-said Harry, looking at the man.
“Apologies, but Kreacher Is happy. A Malfoy, it is certainly an improvement from a Weasley…and Kreacher meant no disrespect by that.”
So, for the last time the Golden Trio boards the Hogwarts express as students. Ron is almost positive he wants to be an Auror, he feels a fierce sense of needing to protect innocent people from losing their lives like Fred, or losing their families like him and Teddy, but he comes along anyways. Says he wants a last normal year, but they all know he can’t bear the thought of sending Hermione back to the sight of the battle, where she almost died, where they all almost died, all alone. Ever the protective one, Ron was.
When they arrive, the thestrals are waiting for them. It pains him to see how many students are going up to them, curious, and petting them. He thinks thestrals know about the ones that can see him, they’d always been particularly sweet to him, especially the babies. They’d come and rest their heads on his lap, find him in the forest when he’d go and cry, they’d bring him small odd presents including flowers, scarves, bugs and one time Fangs collar. Now they would nuzzle the hands of students, seeming to understand the heartbreak they all felt.
The students find out pretty soon after that, about a month into their relationship a fourth year sees them snogging in an otherwise deserted hallway, and runs off the tell the entire school. Surprisingly they don’t catch many homophobic insults thrown their way, they do however see a lot of the staff begrudgingly paying each other. A lot of them seemed to have bet against Mcgonagall and Hagrid, all lost of course.
“To the Slytherins that have returned,” he almost hears everyone take a breath. “There will be a no tolerance policy for targeting and bullying against you. Students that disobey this will be faced with reduction of house points and detention. If you are here, you have begun to make your amends and the staff at Hogwarts will protect you as the rest of our students.”
They’ve reached the door now and Harry realizes that Professor Mcgonagall has been as much of a parent to him as Sirius. “Professor, may i ask something of you?” Harry asks, his mind going to the future. “Anything Mister Potter.” He takes a beat before he begins. “I would like to follow in the steps of Remus. I would like to earn my place and become a professor here, possibly of defense against the dark arts. Could you give me any advice on how to go about this?”
Above the crowd, having had grown a few inches over the summer Harry spots Hagrid and breaks out into a smile. He wrestles his way through the crowd and makes his way to his friend, Hagrid wrapping him in a hug immediately. “Harry, my boy! I’ve missed you,” The half giant says when they break apart. “I’m so glad to see you, Hagrid.” The ride to the castle is with Hagrid, Neville and Harry himself, pulled by a thestral that had recognized Harry and nuzzled him as he slipped it a treat.
Ron and Hermione stand and he smiles at them. “I’ll meet you there,” he says and heads to the front of the hall. Mcgonagall is speaking to Filch when he walks up, who finishes their conversation and walks away. “Harry,” she says softly. Before he can say anything he’s being wrapped into a hug. “I am so glad for you to be home.” She whispers and he hugs back a bit tighter before they break apart. “I’m glad to be home, professor. Being headmistress suits you.” Mcgonagall smiles at him. “Your parents would be so proud of you,” she starts walking to the door, Harry walks with her. “Mister Black and Lupin would be too, I know. What you did for us, what you went through will not be forgotten. I, I am always going to be so proud of you Harry, you’ve grown to be an outstanding young man.”
“You alright there?” Draco asks as Harry walks up to him. “Never better, say what are your plans for tomorrow?” Draco looks a bit confused. “Nothing much, why?” Harry smiles. “Would you like to go on a date with me?” He asks suddenly a bit unsure of himself. Draco’s cheeks go a bit pink and he nods. Harry, satisfies with himself, plops down next to him. “Why now?” Draco inquires. “Cause I found out my crush wasn’t so hopeless,” Harry smiles at Pansy, who’s looking out through the window.
“He’s only dating because he thinks he doesn’t have a chance with you.” She’s joking. She’s gotta be joking. Right? There’s no way. Draco would’ve said something by now, but then again he’s been holding all this in for two years. “He wants me?” Harry whispers and Pansy crosses her arms. “You really didn’t know?” She asks after a moment and Harry resists the urge to smack his head on the table. “Merlin, no, I’d have swept him off his feet by now,” Harry says and Pansy stands abruptly. “So why don’t you?”
One of the seventh years, Theo, he distantly remembers his name, steps up a bit unsure, and then he’s hugging him. “Thank you for saving my mother,” he whispers and Harry’s heart breaks a little. “You all take care of yourselves alright? Friends are the way to live through this,” and with that he joins his own friends at the Gryffindor table. Professor, Headmistress he corrects himself, Mcgonagall meets his eyes as he takes his seat and smiles, he can’t help but smile back. The feast goes off with out a hitch, that is until there’s a commotion at the Slytherin table.
Harry looks up to see a few students, must be fourth or fifth years crowded around someone. They seem angry and he excuses himself to his friends to see what they’re doing. A platinum blonde head of hair sticks out of the middle of the crowd, unmoving and Harry’s heart stops for a moment. Draco. Draco who saved him, Draco who he’d saved, Draco who didn’t have a choice. Draco who he’d almost killed. Draco who avoided Azkaban thanks to his testimony. Before he really even makes the decision he’s standing behind the crowd and clears his throat. He hears a few insults thrown, accusations, words of people that have lost and need someone to blame thrown, they all halt when he says “Oi, go back to your table. Now.” The younger gryffindors look up at him, shocked before they disperse.
“Hogwarts is home for me, as I imagine it is to you. It is important now that we stick together, just as we did then. We must lean on one another for support. Many of our professors will be offering office hours, which can be used for help with course work of course, but also may be used to talk to someone. I would like each and every one of you to know that you are not alone. Not while you are here.” The headmistress looks at Harry now.
Harry must’ve dozed because he wakes to someone removing his glasses. He mumbles something unintelligible and hears a familiar chuckle. “Just couldn’t stay up could ya, gramps?” Draco teases him and Harry yawns before faking a scowl. “Oh cmon, I’m only teasing,” Draco says with a laugh and gives him back his glasses. Harry wakes up a bit and smiles before digging in his bag. “Open it!” He says thrusting the package into Draco’s hands, Draco chuckles and unties the bow, letting the paper fall away. Harry sees his smile as he looks at the contents, and when he looks up at him. “This is so,” Draco sighs happily. “This is so thoughtful Harry, thank you.” Harry smiles at him and shrugs.
They all sit and chat for about half an hour before Draco actually speaks. “Not to ruin the mood but,” Harry looks over to him, Draco's looking at Ron and Hermione. “I owe you two so many apologies. Hermione, I am so terribly sorry for the things I did. I should never have called you
Harry basically runs to the back of the building before he apparates back to the house, Pansy following right behind him probably curious to see what happens. It’s a Saturday which generally means everyone’s home, Draco’s probably reading in the garden. Harry breaks out into a sprint to the garden, almost knocking Luna over and yelling a ‘sorry!’ behind him as he bursts out the back door. “Draco?” He yells a little bit before seeing him, he’s sitting on the swinging bench overlooking the lilies.
As he enters the Great Hall, he spots a few now seventh years standing still as a statue next to each other. Harry walks next to them and lays his hand on the shoulder of one of them before standing to face them. “It is, so incredibly brave for you all to be here. I know it’s hard, just know you have someone in your corner, someone to talk to if you need it. Always,” Harry says, a bit unsure of what had possessed him to say this. He wasn’t well adjusted himself, his hands began to shake at the sight of the forest, Luna had held his hand to walk in with him and the sickness in his stomach toned down from her.
Even though he’ll still live at Grimmauld with all of them, he’ll be able to see Draco daily still, and all he’s ever wanted was for Draco to be happy. Maybe he’s known it for a while, maybe it started that day when Florence had nudged him into Draco, maybe the night he’d almost kissed him and fallen asleep in the common room together instead, however long it’s been, it’s come to a point. As he’s smiling at Draco, looking at him tell their friends, excited and hopeful for his future, Harry realizes he’s falling in love with him.
“My mother and I are safe. Thanks to you, Harry, I got a second chance at my life.” Harry doesn’t shake his hand. He pulls him in for a hug. “I am so sorry for that day in the bathroom,” Harry whispers and a tear slips down Draco’s cheek. “Me too.” They break away and Pansy stares at her hands. “Harry,” she starts. “I’m not quite as eloquent as Draco, but while we’re at apologies, I would like to apologize for that day before the battle. I was terrified, but that’s no excuse.” Harry stands and extends his hand to her. “Past is in the past right?” He says sheepishly and she shakes his hand.
“I didn’t know you knew them,” Harry says and Sickawell smiles. “You remind me of them, Harry. In the best ways. Smart as Remus, I see. Hair like Sirius, maybe a bit wilder,” Harry chuckles. “And your father, you look so much like him, your mother too. You’ve got her eyes, though I’m sure you’ve heard that a million times,” Sickawell finishes and Harry feels warm, content that he’s like them. Sickawell stands and starts to walk Harry out. “They were good people, and I’ll be glad to hand my class to someone that would make them proud.” Harry shakes his hand. “Thank you, Professor.”
Harry looks over to Draco now, he looks surprised, in the best way. He looks as if a weight has been lifted. “Lastly,” Mcgonagall continues, “Eighth year students returning to complete their education will be housed in the guest rooms of the school, common rooms will of course be open to all of you. I do not wish to make this adjustment more difficult for you, but with the damage the school has taken there is sadly no room for you in your houses dormitories. You may room with who you wish, same gender of course. And I- I would just like to thank all of you,” she looks at Harry again. “All of you for coming home once again.” The grand hall erupts into clapping, various cheers and Mcgonagall smiles. “Now go on, to your rooms with you lot! This term will not be easy and we expect the best from all of you!” She steps down from the podium as students begin to exit the hall.
A smile tugs at Draco's mouth, a small one, like he’s almost forgotten how to smile. “You aren’t either, are you?” Comes his response, Harry shakes his head. “None of us are. Perhaps the new Harry and Draco could make amends,” He says, once again without thinking. Draco looks a bit stunned. “You called me Draco.” Harry huffs a laugh. “I think, I think i’d like to be friends with you. Harry.” The blonde boy says and Harry smiles. “I’d like that,” with that he stands and returns to his seat.
“Then don’t.” Ginny says bluntly and it takes Harry off guard and he snorts. “I’m serious Harry, we all know life is fleeting and we shouldn’t spend it regretting the things we do or don’t do. You’d make a fine auror, but if you’ll remember fifth year, you make a brilliant teacher,” Ginny finished and he just stared at her, she was looking out at the horizon. “Defense against the dark arts,” comes out of his mouth before he can process it. “You fought Voldemort for seven years Harry. You lived through it, you kept your friends alive through it, who better to protect the next generation? Personally I couldn’t think of a better professor for my future children.” He just gapes at Ginny for a moment before he hugs her. “Thank you Gin.”
“I used to come here back in sixth year,” Draco says suddenly, Harry hums and shoves a stray curl back behind his ear. “It’s quiet here, peaceful even,” Harry replies easily. “Are you heading to Hogsmeade this weekend?” The blonde boy asks, sounding a bit unsure of himself. “Nah, I was thinking of going to visit Teddy, my godson,” the gryffindor boy replies easily, Draco looks at him a bit confused. “He’s Remus’ son. Lives with his gramma Andromeda.” He hears Draco snort. “I know that you dolt, he’s my cousin. Jus didn’t realize you were his god father.”
When he sits, his friends question him silently thankfully, just casting a few looks. Luna however smiles at him. “You’re very kind,” is all she says. “I learned it from you,” Harry responds and Luna smiles at him. Before he knows it the feast is over, and Mcgonagall is standing at the podium. “Students,” she begins. “I would like to first and foremost thank you for coming back. I know that it is incredibly difficult for so many of you to see this place, let alone return to it. Many of you have lost loved ones, I offer my condolences for this. To the students and teachers that fought last year, I would like to sincerely thank you, Hogwarts has been my home most of my life and thanks to the bravery and hearts of you, it stands to this day.” She clears her throat, Harry thinks she’s getting a bit choked up, he is himself.
Minerva proceeds to tell him about how he will need to complete a NEWT in the subject as he already held an owl in it, achieving an O in it preferably and would need to gain life experience for two years before applying. He could study under any past professors, of Hogwarts or not. Once she finished informing him, she leaned down and lowered her voice a bit. “But Harry, you will always have a place at Hogwarts as long as I am headmistress. Personally i’d be grateful to have you as the schools professor for defense against the dark arts, I know you would do well. Just as I know you’d prefer to earn your place here.”
“You were awfully quiet in there,” Harry says on their walk to the forest. Draco inhales deep. “They knew Dobby. All of them.” The memory of holding Dobby as he died floods back and Harry sighs. “Dobby was a good friend,” Harry says, willing tears not to prick at his eyes. Draco huffs a small laugh. “Whenever I’d get into it with my dad he’d bring me a cupcake. Every time till you freed him, thankfully.” Draco smiles at him now and Harry just, takes in his beautiful Draco really is. How his soul is healing and becoming as beautiful as the outside, seeing how he’s a good person, how he’s changing.
After he sits with Kreacher for a while, both of them drinking tea, he bids him goodnight and heads back to the common room. There's a blonde head of hair that he can see above the couch, Draco he thinks and smiles before sitting next to him. Draco sets his book face down on the coffee table when Harry sits, offering him half of his blanket. "Couldn't sleep?" Harry asks and Draco shakes his head. "Got tired of staring at my ceiling, you?" His friend asks and Harry sighs, his head thumping back onto the couch.
He’d won. Blimey, Harry had actually won a war. He’d died, not for long, and he won, they all won. It felt like he could breathe for the first time. All of his life itd been ‘Harry do this’ and ‘Harry be that’ and finally, he was free. Was he really though? Was he truly free? It didn’t feel like it. They’d won but they’d lost so much. Fred, Remus, Tonks, and hundreds of others just to win. Maybe he wasn’t the boy who lived after all. Maybe he was just the boy who lost. The boy who was lost.
“IwanttobeaherbologistprogessoratHogwarts,” Neville lets out in a rush, stunning them all a bit. “It suits you,” Luna states simply, the rest agreeing. “Maybe we’ll work together then, Nev,” Harry says with a smile. Neville, ever unsure of himself looks up from where he was staring at his hands and smiles. “Defense against the Dark Arts, Harry?” Luna asks in her dreamy, warm voice, Harry nods. “You’ll be the best Hogwarts has ever seen,” Neville says and knocks his knee against Harry’s own. “And you’ll give Professor Sprout a run for her money.” Ron chimes in, Neville positively beams.
“Oh yes, you do know me so well Kreach.” The elf disappears for a moment before reappearing with two bags in his hand. “Now this one is beef and this one is apples, these are just from Kreacher, would you tell the thestrals that?” Harry smiles and takes the bags. “Of course, i’ll make sure to tell you how much they like them.” And with that Draco and Harry leave the kitchens.
While on the run the thing Hermione sorely missed was school, she’d missed learning, her professors though some of them weren’t coming back, most of all she’d missed feeling like she was earning her spot in the world. The train ride itself was a bit eventful, little kids, first through third years gathered outside their door, wanting to see the Saviour himself. Hermione had conjured a few curtains to block them out and they’d gone to bother someone else. In their cabin contained the trio, Ginny, Luna and Neville, it was a tad bit cramped but Harry felt at home. These were his people, his friends, his family.
A few weeks later Professor Sickawell, the new DADA professor asks Harry to stay after class. Harry doesn’t really know much about him, just that his first name is Henry. “Mister Potter, Ive heard a few rumors you’d like to become a defense against the dark arts professor yourself one day. Is this true?” Harry blanks a little, hope he doesn’t think he wants to take his job from him. Harry just nods, Professor Sickawell claps his hands together once. “Wonderful!” This reaction takes Harry by surprise a little.
“Why would anyone start a rumour about us?” asked Draco, looking at Harry. “It was definitely one of my friends…Goyle, probably by accident.”
It was so weird for Harry to listen to Malfoy’s apology. He didn’t know if it was sincere, if he really meant it. But him saying it have to count for something. Harry was on his chamber about to sleep when he heard a knock, so he came out of bed and went into his office so he could open the door that led to the Professors’ common room. It was Neville.
“Harry can we talk?” asked Ron. Harry didn’t say anything, he just took off his apron and lead Ron to his room. Ron tried to ignore the signs that this was also Draco’s room. Harry sat on his bed and looked at Ron pacing around the room.
Harry and Draco went to Draco’s chamber. Draco was in bed and there he had his dinner, which was only soup. Harry said it was good for his stomach. Neville came into the chamber to check on Draco. He brought him tea. He stayed there for a few minutes until he realized it was better to leave the couple alone.
“It’s fine dear, I just came in."- then she smiled.- "I came in to find this young man taking full advantage of my Christmas’s gifts. You will not find a better biography of Merlin in the entire world.”
“No, but if he wants to waste his money, I’m not stopping him.” -said Ron, looking at the details on the silver rook.
Harry saw that the whole place was white, and the walls were empty. It made the place look bigger, somehow. Draco talk about how the furniture and appliances are 100% muggle, but he made them so much better with magic. He said even Arthur Weasley would find them interesting. Harry doubt it, since Mr. Weasley had more experience than Draco, who still had a lot of muggle inventions to discover.
“They are fine. So is Malfoy, I think. I didn’t know you wanted me to invite them, I’m sorry.”- Said Harry
Classes started again on the 8 of January. Harry could see a change in some students. Some came back with more energy and just generally happier, but others were gloomy. Those were the kids that had lost someone during the war. Harry saw it with the Weasleys, especially with George. They all tried to ignore it, but every once in a while, they would be looking sad. The Weasleys knew that to honour Fred they had to try to move on. Hermione told Harry that when one of the Weasleys realize they were becoming sad, they would go and try to make someone laugh, mostly George.
“You were snoring, I heard you from the floor below.”- said Draco. - “It was a bit scary, honestly.”
“No, it’s not time yet. We still got another two weeks.” Said Ron. “Why would you lie like this?” he asked with a mortified tone.
For a moment Harry thought about quitting his new job, after hearing that. Teddy misses him. He needs his godfather. But no. This job is the best thing for both of them. He will see Teddy. Thanks to Malfoy. Why was Malfoy being nice? Wasn’t he angry with him about his dad?
The rest of the family didn’t know if the situation was weird or if it was just how the trio talk, but one by one they started leaving, saying they were going to the bathroom or to the kitchen, George just pointed at the window and left the house taking Percy with him, who hadn’t noticed anything yet.
He ate lunch at the grand Hall with Neville and with Septima Vector, the Arithmancy professor and the Head of Gryffindor. Harry never interacted much with her before. He only knew her as a very strict professor that gave complicated homework. She asked both Harry and Neville about the Gryffindor kids, specially the older ones. She told them how at least half of the sixth years chose at random their N.E.WT. level classes, because they didn’t know what they wanted to specialize at. According to McGonagall, she said, indecision wasn’t much of a problem for Gryffindor students, before the war.
“Killing someone doesn’t make you brave.  Dumbledore knew more about bravery and I am sure he would agree with me on this one.”- Harry let Teddy down. He began to walk around the tomb, touching it and playing.
“He would’ve been a great father…I mean, he was, during the time he got.”- said Harry, looking at Teddy who was still running around the couch were andromeda was sitting.
Draco also started talking with Walburga’s portrait. He praised her on the Permanent Sticking Charm and talked about how their families are related and what their ancestors accomplished. She was pleased to have a pureblood in the house back again. She didn’t even questions why he was going to be living there. Once she saw the changes he made to her house, she started screaming through all the process. Draco hadn’t figure out yet how to take the portrait off, or what to tell Kreacher to convince him, but in the meantime, he used a silencing charm, which consisted on erasing the mouth from the portrait.
Victoire wanted to play with her cousins, but Teddy said it would be boring since they were only babies. “That’s why I want to play with them, soon they will be old and not as cute.”
“Good idea. Let my son spend his free time with the boy and not with his parents. His real family.” -Said Lucius.
The four of them arrived at the Ministry and were received by an Unspeakable. He guided them to the Department of Mysteries, where McGonagall had to sign some papers. They continue to walk until they stood outside the Death Chamber.
The End-of-Term Feast was on the 29 of June. The Great Hall was decorated with Ravenclaw colours, who had won the house cup. Harry ate mostly roast-beef, mashed potatoes and ice-cream, although, he definitelyate a bit of
, it was cute. I suppose most of the kids are still a bit intimidated by me, so I was thinking, that if I gave them more homework, they would stop thinking of me as
According to the doctor, the delivery went smoothly. According to Hermione, she was ripped apart and the doctor needed another ten years of medical school. But both the baby and the mother were fine. It was a girl, and they named her Rose.
“I know I won’t be able to. I’m sorry.”- said Draco, covering his eyes with one hand, mad that Harry was the one who was making more sense. - “Also, we are co-workers now, so it would also jeopardize our jobs.”
Hagrid was outside the headmistress office and once the two professors came out, he hugged them both.  “I’m so proud of you. Specially you, Draco. You are showing some fine bravery there, you know.” Said Hagrid.
Harry looked around. Everyone was confused, everyone was murmuring. Harry thought he heard Molly saying, “
“Teddy liked the movie. It is impressive what muggles have done with television technology. I guess it must be harder to be entertained when they don’t have magic. They have to compensate.”-said Draco.
Draco took out his wand and used confundo to the man next to them. Harry noticed it and he did the same for the two men in front of them. The tree men looked at each other and then got out of the bus on the next stop.
“Speaking of being surprised, we have heard some rumors, about you and Potter.” Said Lucius. Draco looked at her mother, but she was looking at the floor. “You are getting married to Astoria Greengrass as soon as possible.”
This new school year at Hogwarts presented a welcoming routine for Harry. Even more than his first year. Monday through Friday he did his work as usual and ate his three meals at the Grand Hall. By 11 o’clock at night he was already in bed. Every Saturday afternoon Harry spent it with Teddy. On Saturday nights, Harry and Neville went for a drink with Hagrid. Mostly fire-whiskey, but also tea, muggle French wine, and new stuff Hagrid got someplace he shouldn’t have said.
The three professors were at Grimmauld Place. Harry and Neville were sitting at the living room while Draco was pacing around the room. Kreacher brought them tea.
“I could teach you. You could cook something for your parents, a muggle dish done the muggle way. That would be fun.” – said Harry, thinking about Lucius Malfoy eating macaroni cheese.
“We almost didn’t recognize him.”- said Hermione. - “But that ferret-like face it’s already so familiar to us.”
Harry was already done with his classes, so he was going to the Great Hall with Neville when they saw a bunch of kids dragging Draco towards the hospital wing.
“Ron, that’s enough.”- said Hermione. She looked for a moment at Harry, then she stood up and leaved the room.
Harry went back to Hogwarts wearing the same clothes he wore the day before. There were some girls giggling while he passed by them. Harry thought it was because he was kind of rushing towards his room. It really wasn’t that. Older boys were smiling and nodding at Harry. He also saw that Slughorn stopped talking with a student just to stare at him.  Once in his room, he changed into clean clothes and went quickly to his classroom.
“The truth is I was afraid, of everything. Of all of you dying. Of the dark lord coming to my home, of him thinking high of my family again. I just couldn’t deal with it.”
Draco was also at the Burrow, his parents told him not to go to Malfoy Manor for Christmas, or any holiday for that matter. Draco missed his mom. He ate most of Hagrid’s pastries even though they weren’t that good.
“Why are you not?” asked Neville, getting a confused looks from Draco and an amused looks from Harry.
“Mate, this is going too far, don’t you think? -Said Ron – “I know you want to be nice and all but, he hasn’t done anything to have our trust.”
Harry spent the Holidays with the Weasleys, Hermione, Andromeda and with Teddy. Draco was there too, but he had to be with his own family for most of the day. For Christmas, Draco gave Mr. Weasley a Nokia cell-phone.
“I didn’t expect he would like me just because I gave him a 15-century muggle chess set. I’ve heard he is great at chess, so I hoped that if he had it, that would be an excuse for us to play.”
The place looked pinker than what Harry remembered. There were only 3 couples, all students from Hogwarts and all of them stopped their snogging to look at their professors. Harry and Draco were sitting in front of each other and teddy was next to them.
The new couple arrived at Andromeda’s home. They wanted to see Teddy and talk with Andromeda about their new relationship and its implications in Teddy’s life and what to do about Malfoy. Teddy hugged them both, but Andromeda soon made him go back to his room to finish his homework.
“Good evening, students. As you all know, besides being the headmistress, I have been teaching you all transfiguration. Now, I have
“Percy is right. Honestly, I think Oliver doesn’t even see Quidditch players as “real” people. So, don’t worry Harry, you don’t have to be jealous about Oliver.” -Said Angelina.
“Why would she tell you that. None of them mentioned it to me. She hasn’t mentioned it to me.”- said Harry, looking away from Draco’s face.
“Take these.”- Said Harry, giving her two boxes of chocolates. – “One for you and one for your parents.”
for putting “dangerous chemicals” on the hair of a baby. They spent two hours at the zoo until it close at 5 pm.
Less than a year ago, a man about their age was beaten to death in London because two muggles believed him to be gay. Draco read about it on the muggle newspaper he received at Hogwarts. Harry remembered that Draco was tense and more nervous than usual.
“It was not bad. Any of it.”- said Draco, after he was done with his breakfast. He was the last one to finish his food.
that needed repairing, Harry went directly to The Three Broomsticks. Once he stepped inside, he could see Malfoy siting on a table on the far-left corner. It was the hair that gave him out. He was sitting with Blaise Zabini. Before he realized what he was doing, he went towards them.
Harry noticed that Draco kept talking mostly with Blaise and with Astoria. He did make an effort to talk with Draco’s friends. He tried to teach Goyle how to play chess. He wasn’t good at it, but he understood it, which surprised everyone, even Goyle, who kept smiling even when he lost every game. With Pansy and Theodore, he talked about Hogwarts. They both apologized for what they did back at Hogwarts, but Harry wasn’t sure if they were being honest.
“Oh, the school for special kids. How nice of both of you.” said Mary coming out from the kitchen with tea and biscuits.  “Please sit. What do you teach, exactly?”
Harry went to Grimmauld Place. He was greeted by Kreacher, they both wished each other merry Christmas. Harry thought he saw a female house elf hiding behind a sofa, but he said nothing.
The reason he gave was that the kid had failed many times to perform a correct Hex-deflection spell. Harry said, very calmly, that it was unacceptable that he wasn’t able to do it by this point of the school year and that he was not being serious about it, so he gave him detention. Harry knew the moment he started talking that it didn’t make sense. He would have been mad at any professor who gave detention for that reason.
