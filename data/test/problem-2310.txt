Tom let out an unpleasant bark of laughter. “For fifty Galleons, I’ll let you sleep out with the bins where you belong–”
Draco’s bark of laughter melts into a moan. “Fuck, I’m so full,” he says, like he’s shocked about it. “God, I’m so—” He rocks back sharply and lets out a cry. “I think— It feels good. It feels—
Harry gaped. Did Malfoy still believe this was a passing fancy fuelled by moonshine? Did he think Harry didn’t really mean it?
Malfoy himself was leaning back in his chair, his soft hair rumpled, his notebook held open in front of him with one elegant hand.
“Please,” I say again, and Malfoy growls and bites a kiss into my neck. I tighten my hand in his hair, but he pulls away quickly, looking down at Harry—at me—as Harry tugs down my underwear.
Harry fumbled the empty Pensieve back into the cupboard and didn’t look at Malfoy. “Yeah, ’course.” He closed the cupboard doors with too much force, winced and straightened. “I best be off,” he said, not turning around. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Malfoy bobs his head and I swear around my fist. He shoots me a glare. His lips are stretched taut around me. Bloody hell.
It was ten o’clock in the morning when Harry got home from Andromeda’s. There was an owl waiting for him. He’d barely finished reading it before he Apparated to Draco’s townhouse.
Harry’s eyes struggled to focus as he peered down at his notes. His handwriting had become steadily worse as the week had progressed, and it was hardly neat at the best of times. A tight band of pain had settled across his head around Tuesday – or was it Wednesday? What day was it again? – which had recently started giving him the occasional flash of white across his vision alongside particularly painful throbs.
Harry didn’t say anything, and Draco took his silence as distaste. He nodded and closed his eyes. As Harry watched, still wordless, still confused, the green ribbons changed colour, bright crimson bleeding out from the flush that lingered on Draco’s chest, fingers of gold licking over the silver.
After Draco had stormed upstairs, screeching that he’d rather live under Voldemort’s eternal rule than live under the same roof as Harry, Harry retreated to the bathroom and tentatively summoned a bar of soap. It sailed to him without hesitation, and he breathed a long sigh of relief; apparently, the contract took screaming fights to be a normal part of marriage and hadn’t retaken their magic. He fired off as many spells as he could think of, just to be sure, and emerged ten minutes later—the bathroom in a much worse state than when he arrived, but his own nerves calmed considerably.
He seemed to realise his mistake as soon as the words had left his mouth. He tried to take it back, wide-eyed – “But this is nice! I like this!” – but Harry stood, dragged the Chudley Cannons boxers off and shoved Draco hard in the chest. He fell awkwardly onto the bed with a squawk.
Harry had allowed Malfoy to change the subject once already. He wasn’t going to allow it again. “I can’t believe you left me like that. I genuinely thought I was going to come right there at the table. I’d’ve definitely been in the press, then.”
, yes.” Malfoy thrust his arse backwards, spearing himself sharply on Harry’s cock. “Fuck, I want this, I want you,
Harry barely noticed. His gaze strayed back to Draco. Whatever he had done differently to his hair really did suit him.
Malfoy’s sharp cheekbones tinged pink. He cleared his throat. “Thank you, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We already know you’ve maintained semantic and procedural memories. It’s episodic memories – ones directly related to your life, your emotions – that have been lost. This does lend weight to my theory that your memories remain in your mind, but please, don’t expect it to be this easy going forwards.”
. But he imagines Draco’s face when Harry—both Harrys—wake him. He’ll be sleepy, confused. Then Harry will tie him up, and take him apart.
Potter’s brow furrowed and Draco knew he was reacting instinctively, sensing a hero moment. He tried to cut it off with a hasty, “No, stop, you don’t need to—” but Potter was too quick.
“See, it’s fine,” he says, and yep, there it is—his expression tips into enjoyment. A deep red has started to overtake the pretty pink flush of his face. “Look, I—
“You know, I think you’re supposed to move,” Potter bites out, and Draco breaks, is powerless to resist pulling out and shoving back in, both of them groaning.
Harry sped up the pace of his hips, letting the threat of orgasm creep closer. “God, I love you so much. Draco, you’re perfect, you’re my favourite, you really are, you – Oh,
Malfoy’s desperate warning heats Harry in a very human way, not cutting through the bloodlust but adding to it. The blood still flows from the cut on Malfoy’s dick and Harry laps at it, swirls the mouthful of blood over Malfoy’s cock, swallows, sucks, swallows, sucks, swallows–
“Yes,” Draco says. “It feels…” He meets Harry’s gaze, and Harry is equal parts terrified and thrilled by the sly expression that creeps onto his face. “It feels really good,” Draco says.
Harry looked into Malfoy’s desperate eyes, felt the echo of Earl Grey curl through his mind, and nodded.
, you sick bastard.” Harry heard another smash behind him and distantly assumed the mirror had exploded.
As soon as Harry realised Malfoy was right, the circular room flickered and was replaced by his kitchen at Grimmauld Place. Then Ron and Hermione’s living room – Harry’s bedroom – Healer Brisley’s office.
“Erm, it’s a circular room with stone walls.” Harry looked around. “Sort of medium-sized, I suppose? There are big windows that look out onto fields, but we’re quite high up. There are some doors, like you asked for. Wooden ones. I dunno where they go.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and waved his wand. The door slammed closed behind Harry. “Not that it’s remotely any of your business,” he sniffed, “but Parvati sent me an owl early yesterday morning asking to rearrange. I had been hoping for a day off, but then I wouldn’t have had the pleasure of hearing her complain at length about how obnoxious you were as a teenager.” He smirked. “You took her to the Yule Ball, you know. You were an awful date.”
“Not at all,” Draco said. Harry hadn’t noticed his voice slipping out of that distant politeness, but it must have done, because it was jarring to hear it again. “We were just about to go back inside.”
“Erm.” Harry scanned the page, trying to pick out something relevant. “The … er … It’s a new one. Just come through. We might have to stay late tonight.”
But Draco knows better. New friends turn out to be undercover reporters. Flirtations become triumphant insults. There’s no way Potter actually means it.
“No.” Truthfully, the red made the soft flush of his skin look splotchy. The gold diminished the pearly shine of his hair. He was still one of the most captivating sights Harry had ever seen.
Harry could barely hear anything else. It echoed around them, the thud of flesh on flesh, of a bedframe on a wall, a pulsing, throbbing,
charm glowing on his bed. Potter has been here eight minutes already. There’s so much Draco still wants to do.
At the time, Draco intended to do no such thing. But, one throwaway remark from Potter, and here he is.
Harry’s gasp is swallowed by Draco’s mouth. It’s just as good as their kiss at the wedding. No, it’s better, because there aren’t a hundred people staring at them, because Harry isn’t thrown by how good it feels, because Draco presses his whole body against Harry and Harry’s insides light up like a
Harry growled in frustration. “One,” he said aloud, turning to the first door in his mind. “Two. Three. Four–”
Who were these people? The owl had delivered the letter to him – was he Harry? He didn’t feel like a Harry. He didn’t feel like an anything.
“I don’t know, Harry!” Hermione bit her lip again, and Harry suddenly felt so guilty that he kept doing this, kept attracting trouble, kept making her worry.
Harry’s hips snapped upwards again, quite without his permission. He groaned. “God,” he said, and moved his feet to get better leverage. “God.” He spread his hands over Malfoy’s cheeks and squeezed, lifting Malfoy upwards, then fucked him, hard.
“Speaking of owls,” he said, picking a sheet of parchment off his desk and brandishing it, “I received this bizarre missive last night. Something to do with you?”
“It’s not a problem,” Harry said firmly. “Whatever you did in the past, I know you’re better than that now.” He was startled by the force of his reaction.
He jumped as Harry’s voice came, not from inside the office in his head, but from a foot away, inside the kitchen of 12 Grimmauld Place.
Draco’s only reaction was a slight hitch in breath and a further widening of his legs. Harry pushed in and out, watching carefully for any sign of pain or discomfort, but Draco’s gaze was steady. Harry had spent a lot of time cataloguing Draco’s expressions over the last three years. He’d never seen this one before.
Draco raises an eyebrow at me. Without breaking eye contact, he points his wand at himself and vanishes his robes, leaving him naked from the top of his head to the tips of his perfectly pedicured toes.
“Mmm, you feel amazing.” He sounds languid, blissful—like he’s just slipped into a hot bath. “God, your big cock is stretching me so wide.” He punctuates his point with a sharp downward thrust. “Filling me up so much, fuck.”
“It wouldn’t have worked if we hadn’t left it so long.” If Harry hadn’t been so desperate, on such a knife edge of thirst, he wouldn’t have been able to follow Malfoy’s trail as it drifted higher, as the air got thinner, as the wind got stronger. But the longer he goes between feeds, the sharper he becomes. The deadlier he becomes.
“Don’t force it.” Harry reached out to Malfoy’s cool presence instinctively and the image of the reception held, though it shimmered at the edges like it wasn’t quite in tune. “Good,” Malfoy said. “Let your thoughts flow back to where you want them to be. Are you ready? Try again.”
“Shame about the end, though,” Harry mused after a while. “I closed my eyes when I came, I think. It broke the connection.”
“Seamus started selling seashells by the seashore,” Harry persisted. “But Susan needed to sit down, so she took a stroll to the shops across the street.”
“Fuck,” Draco said. His attention was fixed on Harry leaning into the touch of Draco’s hand on his jaw.
“You know,” Potter said, when Draco’s distraction allowed silence to build between them, “I never asked—how
Harry exhaled. He checked his watch – it was just past nine. If they left now, he could be back well before half past and still squeeze in a solid chunk of work before the morning. Maybe a break would be good for him. His neck ached from having been hunched over his desk, and he’d been struggling to focus. A quick respite might be just the ticket.
Ever since they moved to Hogsmeade, Harry has been making excuses to tap Draco on the shoulder, to nudge him out of the way, to share the sofa with him—despite the two empty armchairs that sit either side of it.
By the time Harry was done, he was half-hard and flushed, but could no longer recall the specifics of his fantasies. He leant over the sideboard and called upon every trick Malfoy had taught him about controlling his thoughts to stop himself immediately filling the gaps with new suggestions. He visualised his mental space and made sure all his lingering feelings were shoved behind those four firmly locked doors. He breathed slowly for a long moment.
, which can be cast at any time. There’s no prep work required; the charm uses a non-invasive form of Legilimency to respond to pre-existing fantasies, but those with strong wills will be able to direct the flow of the daydream. The charm will fade entirely after exactly thirty minutes. No more, no less.
“I think I might die if you don’t.” Draco nudged Harry’s head with his chin, bumping a kiss to Harry’s hair. “Please – anything – Oh,
But despite the glorious sight of Draco, my attention is caught on Harry. On the way his mouth opens wider on a silent gasp each time he pushes himself deep inside Draco, deep alongside me. On the way his eyebrows draw together, like he feels so good it’s painful—the way I feel, too. On the way his gaze locks on mine even as he wraps an arm around Draco’s chest, works the silver piercing in Draco’s tight, pink nipple between his fingers.
“Look,” he said, exhaling shakily. “You’re – I mean, I’m going to be thinking about this forever, probably, and I really appreciate all the trouble you’ve gone to – And it’s not that I don’t want to, because I
Harry’s hungry eyes followed the movement of Draco’s wand into his waiting hand. Draco remembered, with a jerk to his navel, that it had been Harry’s wand too, once.
Harry shoots me a questioning glance, but I’m being so thick tonight that I don’t know what he’s asking. He bites his bottom lip—the lip that softened so sweetly under mine, fuck, what is
Thanks to Malfoy’s not-so-subtle hints, Harry successfully bluffed his way through the conversation with Scuttleby. He was, however, not successful at keeping his temper. He left Scuttleby standing outside the Leaky Cauldron, cowed and confused. He didn’t regret it.
“Ah.” Malfoy was suddenly all business. “You found it difficult? Was there any physical pain associated with the attempt? Any flashes of light? Unusual sounds or sensations?” His quill was back in his hand, nib hovering over the page of his notebook.
That morning, there had been one such message from the Auror in charge of Harry’s case – someone Harry had apparently worked with a lot over the last five years. Harry had had no idea who she was, obviously, but he’d liked her well enough at first. His good opinion dwindled with every subsequent letter.
“Yes,” he repeated. He straightened and looked at Malfoy. Malfoy met his gaze unflinchingly. Harry smiled. “When do we start?”
“You are exactly the same, you know,” Malfoy said eventually. “Twenty-seven years of formative memories gone and yet, somehow, you are the exact same person.”
Draco’s stomach swooped once—then again, when memory became fantasy. While he was wanking, Harry was picturing Draco from the pub, his lips wrapped around the top of the Butterbeer bottle. In the fantasy, Draco held Harry’s eyes and lowered his mouth around the neck of the bottle—then the scene twisted, and Draco was on his knees in front of Harry. Harry swore at the imagined soft, wet heat of Draco’s mouth, fucked upwards into his fist.
Harry realised he was still gripping the doorknob and hastily let go, closing the door behind him. “Lot of notes,” he commented, nodding to the large stack on Malfoy’s desk.
Harry sighs and nods gloomily. He waits for Hermione to lead the way – her glare is the most effective way of scaring off eager fans – but Pince’s talon-like hand falls onto Hermione’s shoulder.
“Yes, I know,” Malfoy snapped. “I just mean – Harry. With your memories back – your past self might not want–”
“Nothing,” Malfoy said. He looked down at his quill as if surprised to see he was still holding it, then lay it carefully on the desk. “It’s just – It’s nothing.”
I grunt. My thighs burn from the effort of pounding into him, but his reactions are more than worth it. Fuck, I’ve missed sex. I’ve missed the feel of it, the noises of it, the smell of it, everything. I’ve missed being able to make another person feel this fucking good.
“What? Oh–!” Suddenly, he wasn’t in Malfoy’s office at all; he was in the Leaky Cauldron, sitting across from Ron and Hermione, three bowls of half-eaten rhubarb crumble on the table between them. Harry, disconcerted, tightened his grip on the arms of Malfoy’s wingback chair. The smooth leather squeaked under his fingers.
“Excellent!” the other witch said. She beamed. “That’s settled, then! We’ll see you on the seventeenth. Thank you again for agreeing to do this.”
Harry couldn’t tell whether Malfoy had known or not. Was he just surprised Harry had been bold enough to say something? Harry found he didn’t care. Either way, he was glad Malfoy knew now. He was glad he’d brought it up.
“I can,” Harry said, dragging his eyes from the faint pink tinge brushing Malfoy’s cheekbones and smiling wanly at Healer Brisley. “I’ll let you know if we need anything.”
before pulling Harry into a group of his friends, all swaying to the crooning vocals of the No-Maj Matrix.
In Harry’s peripheral vision, the corners of Malfoy’s mouth quirked. “Weasley and Granger didn’t set your expectations of me very high at all, did they?”
Their movements become demanding. Teeth bite and fingernails scrape and, god, okay, Harry is definitely hard again. Draco is grinding urgently into his hip and everywhere they’re touching feels like it’s alight—so much so that when Harry wrenches his mouth away and opens his eyes, he’s shocked to find the room still dim, lit only by the flickering candles and the stripe of moonlight that shines through the gap in the curtains.
Damn it, but he looked good. Draco had grown used to Harry’s tatty Muggle jeans and T-shirts, but tonight he was dressed in smart black robes that were fitted around his chest and waist—a similar cut, in fact, to the Auror uniform that had preoccupied more of Draco’s fantasies than he cared to count. The scuffed trainers had been replaced with shiny black boots, and Potter was grinning at Draco, like it was a perfectly normal evening, like they were friends—both of which were patently untrue.
Harry couldn’t resist a glance at the clock. It was quarter past eleven. “Sure,” he said with a grin.
Harry’s face was hot, but his insides went cold. “While Hermione was – what?” Hermione and Malfoy both avoided his eyes. “Draco?”
“What?” Hermione asked. Harry looked pointedly at the quill. “Oh, no, not especially,” she said, picking it from behind her ear and using it to gesture while she talked. “I’ve had to take on a little more responsibility for the Confederation since – well. It’s no bother.” She smiled. “It’s quite enjoyable, actually. Tea?”
Draco squeezed his eyes closed and took a deep breath. He concentrated, tried to think honestly about whether he could do this, whether he could trust himself. He thought he could. Probably. But that dark need he’d tried so desperately to repress over the last few months surged within him. The need to
The next morning, Harry took the Floo back to Grimmauld Place while Malfoy was still asleep. He went straight to the writing desk, grabbed a quill and scrawled a single sentence. He called his owl and sent her out of the window with the note and a bag of gold.
The fourth tier had Harry sitting cross-legged outside a tent on a snowy landscape; Draco stood on the Manor grounds between two albino peacocks, a green smudge in the sky behind him.
“You mock poor Kreacher,” Kreacher accused. “You try to trick him into giving his opinion of the Muggle-born, but Kreacher knows better than that. Kreacher knows Master wants him to say that Hermione Granger is a brilliant witch who is always welcome here.”
Draco put the kettle on the stove and rolled his eyes. “I’m a Legilimency-focused Mind Magic Specialist, as you well know. Where is this going?”
Potter reaches down and wraps his hand around both of their cocks, pressing them together. Draco’s hold on his wand slackens.
Draco, halfway to snatching the bill from Potter, froze. “We did,” he said, in a carefully neutral voice.
“You’ve had me for a week and all you’ve done is make me sit around for hours making up imaginary rooms and doors and bloody cardboard boxes. What’s the point?”
His words, rather than helping, seemed to annoy Malfoy. “No, in this case, it was important that you knew. I should have known better than to make assumptions, especially in a situation as delicate as this–”
“Hey, it’ll be fine,” he said, slipping into the voice he used for soothing frazzled students. “I promise I’ll take it easy. And I won’t Apparate anywhere. We’ve figured out worse things than this, haven’t we? There’s no need to panic.”
“I…” The feeling of Malfoy’s breath playing over Harry’s face sent unexpected thrills down his spine. His eyes, no longer struggling to focus, were fixed on Malfoy’s. This was ridiculous. What were they doing? Harry imagined himself saying no, stepping out of Malfoy’s grip and leaving. Why wasn’t he leaving? Merlin, what was wrong with him? “Malfoy…”
“All of it. Anything.” Harry was about to stand, grab Malfoy and Apparate them to Grimmauld Place when Malfoy added, “But not now. I can’t – I’ve already cancelled too many sessions this week. Tomorrow?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Either way,” he said, straightening, armouring himself in Malfoy bravado like Harry had watched him do hundreds of times before. “Would you mind closing the door? You’re letting in a draft.” He gave an exaggerated shiver.
Potter is incoherent, his hand flying over his cock, his curses interspersed with Draco’s name, and it’s the best thing Draco has ever seen, most incredible, hottest, tightest,
The room is loud with the chatter of our friends, but I can’t hear anything over the roaring in my ears.
“What the fuck?” Harry said intelligently, standing in the doorway to Malfoy’s office, his mouth hanging open.
So much for staying away from the hospital for longer than twenty-four hours. Harry checked his watch and increased his pace – it was nearly ten already. He’d overslept; he’d spent hours last night swimming in memories of Malfoy and didn’t get to sleep until the early hours of the morning. But he couldn’t put this off any longer.
“Fuck.” He was looking at Harry in an entirely new way, his eyes fixed on Harry’s mouth. Harry was finding it hard to breathe.
Harry couldn’t imagine going back to Healer Brisley’s chaotic bosom after the quick wit and polished edges of Malfoy. When he’d agreed, he’d thought that Malfoy would be the one to guide him through it. He’d thought Brisley would just be there as a back-up, an extra wand if things took a turn for the worst. He didn’t expect to have to say goodbye so soon.
“Hey, I’m sorry to interrupt, but I really have to grab something from my trunk. I promise I won’t look.”
“Good.” Malfoy smiled at Harry in a warm, affectionate way that made Harry’s insides feel like they had turned entirely to liquid.
Grimacing, Harry took his time making his way to the staircase. He had been to Draco’s house a few times, but had never managed to have a good look around. He examined the stack of old newspapers on the sideboard, ran his finger over the edge of an ornate-framed mirror, and came to a halt beside the coat stand. He recognised every cloak, hat and scarf that hung from it.
“You’re so beautiful,” Harry couldn’t help but tell him. “You really are.” It was true – everything from the dark smudges under his eyes to his pointy nose to his thin mouth. The uneven flush of his neck, his scarred chest, his bony knees. He was beautiful. He was everything Harry wanted.
Draco checks the scroll of parchment again. The incantation is still there. But Potter is saying the most ridiculous things, the exact things Draco wants to hear. He
Harry approached the closed door slowly. He hadn’t been keeping it shut consciously, but he knew what must be behind it. He’d been luxuriating in recalling every detail from his past that he possibly could. There was only one thing he’d avoided thinking about.
Malfoy put his quill down. “Right,” he said. “Well. I suppose we can come back to that.” He frowned, picked up his quill again, and scratched something in his notebook.
“I always thought I was a bit on the adventurous side, you know?” Harry continues. “But he makes me feel like the most boring sod in the world.”
“Then Malfoy is brave and loyal and intelligent!” Hermione insisted, though she didn’t look like she believed the words herself.
He had no idea. What was his name? Where – he scrambled upright and looked around the room – where was he? Why didn’t he know his name??
With all the concentration he could muster, he poured the feeling of hot tightness into Harry’s head, opened his mind wide so Harry felt what Draco could feel—the sweat that crept down his back and the strain in his knees and the scorching, searing bliss of Harry’s arse.
“Your magic feels … familiar.” Harry opened his eyes. “I can’t … How well did we know each other, back in school?”
Potter begins to squirm, his shoulders rippling, and Draco holds himself still, letting the hot clamp of Potter’s arse turn torturous, even when his legs start trembling, when the urge to thrust and fuck and take is overwhelming.
I look down at him. At his pointy, pale, ratty face. He holds my gaze under half-lowered eyelids. Deliberately licks his lips.
“Wanted to,” Draco gasped. “Would have done— Would have been on my knees in a second if you said you wanted it— Would have let you do anything.”
He touched the glasses resting on the bridge of his nose. This man in the disheveled Auror uniform with the jagged scar across his forehead – was that him?
Harry didn’t stop moving as Malfoy convulsed beneath him. Both his hands were still gripping Harry’s biceps, and his cock spurted over his own stomach and chest completely untouched. Harry couldn’t take it, drinking in the sight greedily. His movements were wild, his eyes raking over every visible inch of Malfoy. He’d been on the edge for so long that it was only seconds later that sensation overwhelmed him, his entire body alight. He couldn’t hold back a deep groan when he reached the peak and fell hard.
“Yeah, it’s still there.” If anything, it had intensified, as if Harry’s past self knew he was close to being released.
Malfoy’s mouth twisted. “You did,” he said drily. “Seven pages of it. And I thank you for your frankly astonishing amount of detail. Please be assured that I read and understood every word.”
But Harry got into trouble. Walked right into it, into the nest, the feeding frenzy. Malfoy found him two hours later – frantic, cursing him, yelling his name: “
“That would be nice of you. And I’d better get back to Blaise. He’ll be wondering where I’ve gone.” She whirled away, her sunny robes fanning out around her.
Then again, he can definitely appreciate the value of a realistic storyline. This is tantalisingly believable.
Harry knew. Every December for the last three years, Draco had gone on and on about the glory of Madam Tamsworth’s mince pies and the incredible injustice it was that she wouldn’t give him any unless Harry was there to smile a half-arsed Saviour Smile – even though Harry didn’t even
Harry may have become a self-described expert at winding Malfoy up, but he was still no better at deciphering Malfoy’s riddles. “What? All the doors in my head are open.”
“Fuck.” It was so stupidly simple. Everything he’d ever done, twenty-seven years of his life, right there in front of him. The person he used to be, demanding to be let out.
Harry’s surprise must have shown on his face, because Ron snorted. “Shut up,” he said, and grinned. “I’ve missed you, you plonker.”
“I want,” Draco says, but he’s mumbling, his voice loose and languid. “Another time. Right now m’sleep.”
Pomona waved them away, dabbing her eyes at the sight of Draco steering Harry towards the buffet table by the elbow. Harry wanted to snatch his arm back. Draco’s grip provoked a frisson of pleasure, even through three layers of fabric.
“Cheers,” Ron said. He plonked himself at the table across from Harry. “Ask Malfoy what?” he repeated.
It was strange how the habits he’d formed over the last six months blended with the habits he’d had for years. When making tea, he would find himself reaching for his old favourite mug – that hadn’t been touched since February – with one hand, and the jar of Earl Grey tea leaves with the other. When he went to Ron and Hermione’s, he’d flop unthinkingly into his old spot on the sofa, but his eyes would still linger on the photographs that lined the mantelpiece. And, while lying on his bed, rubbing the heel of his hand over a headache that threatened along his scar, it was the most natural thing in the world to close his eyes and picture the mental space he’d worked on with Malfoy.
“Not everybody is as kinky as you, Potter,” Draco sniffed, and Harry laughed and pulled him into another kiss, like he couldn’t help himself, like he couldn’t keep himself away now he’d done it once. Draco knew the feeling.
Malfoy blinked. “What?” he said. “Why?” Harry’s heart stuttered, but Malfoy waved the question away before Harry could think of an excuse. “Sorry, don’t answer that. It’s none of my business. Please, by all means. It’s in the cupboard.”
“You might not have the control you usually do,” Draco made himself say. “You might not be able to hide things that you don’t want me to see.”
“I know, I know,” he says. “I have a go at him every time, don’t worry. And I always pay once he’s stormed out.”
“You’re beautiful,” he murmured against Draco’s mouth, fingers tightening in Draco’s hair. “You’re so beautiful, all I want to do is look at you. And kiss you. God, I love kissing you.”
He still couldn’t believe this was happening. He’d come over to drop off some mince pies. He’d expected Draco to send him away with a pretentious joke present, some fancy robes for a posh restaurant they’d never visit. He’d expected he wouldn’t see him again until January. He never, not in his wildest dreams, expected–
Cautiously, Harry sent a Stinging Hex towards Malfoy’s thigh. Malfoy batted it away. There was a breath – a moment where they looked at each other, sizing each other up. Then they began to duel.
Draco answers by throwing himself at Potter and kissing him again, holding his face in both hands and
“Oh my god,” Harry says, yanking the sofa cushion to his lap and trying not to think about how good it would feel to thrust up into it. “Stop looking at me like that! You’re in the exact same situation!”
“Don’t worry,” came Malfoy’s voice, although the mouth of the grinning, panting Malfoy in front of him didn’t move. “Memories switching like that is completely normal at this stage. You thought the spell hadn’t worked. Concentrate. Can you feel it?”
Harry flung off his robes and tore himself from Draco’s mouth to tug off his shirt and jeans. It felt good to be free from the stuffiness of his clothes, but it felt even better to climb onto the bed and pull Draco close, to feel the hot thrill of his skin and the hard line of his dick. Harry ground himself against it – his own dick was aching and desperate for attention, still trapped in his boxers (which were bright orange, the Chudley Cannons logo emblazoned across the arse).
God, yes, Harry wanted to watch that. His hand tightened at the thought, and Draco hissed, bucking into the pressure.
Hermione nodded sympathetically. “You said that last time you worked with Mind Magic, too. Back in fifth year.”
“Harry, please— Need you inside me.” He’s fucking himself properly now—slow, deep thrusts that are doing their best to drag moans from me, but I keep it together as best I can. I’m still adjusting to the tentative new feeling in my chest—next to the pulsing love I have for Harry, next to the hole that Hermione left behind. “I need both of you inside me—please—”
Harry wants to taste it, he realises. He wants to lap at the glistening head, wants to feel the heat of it on his tongue, wants to suck it in until his mouth is full. He wants Draco’s scent in him, on him, surrounding him.
“Earl Grey,” Harry repeated. “I don’t think I’ve had that.” He inhaled – the action didn’t increase the strength of the not-a-scent, but it helped him to focus. “I can’t decide whether I like it or not.”
“Okay.” Harry needs to hold himself back, to keep himself in check, but he’s no longer sure why. He lets Malfoy’s arm fall and resumes his position on his knees before Malfoy, his hands gripping Malfoy’s thighs, Malfoy’s dick inches from Harry’s mouth.
“No.” Potter leans forward, almost topples; Draco steadies him instinctively. “Knew you’d catch me,” Potter breathes.
Harry was distantly horrified to see Malfoy’s smudged grey eyes fill with tears. “I… Thank you.” Malfoy drew a shuddering breath. “I know I don’t deserve it. I’ll repay you as soon as I can.”
The story had no place for a coward. He’d tried to be a villain, to earn his place on the page, but the flames of evil had burned too hot. Now, he was an addendum, an afterthought, an absent “Whatever happened to…?” His fate was to be forgotten.
“Ah, here they are! Silly me.” Brisley plucked the glasses from the top of her head and chuckled. She looked at them expectantly, clearly waiting for a response. Harry smiled tightly. He glanced at Hermione. She was pursing her lips. Harry got the sense that Hermione had a particular impatience for the disorganised.
“I’m just here to collect Mr Potter!” came Healer Brisley’s cheerful response. The door remained closed.
“The point of the Thestral question was to check that you retained sense memory. It was a very simple test to confirm what we already knew. I didn’t think there was much point repeating the exercise, but if you’d rather we stop working on things that actually have a chance of success to hammer out superficial details that will make you feel better, it would actually be much easier for me, so I’d be happy to indulge you.”
Malfoy continued to glare at him. Harry plastered on his best apologetic smile. “Sorry. Please carry on, Healer Malfoy.”
“I really am sorry,” Harry said to the darkening sky. “I was being selfish, inviting you over. I know you’ve heard that sort of thing hundreds of times in my stupid head, but you shouldn’t have to hear it in person.”
He found himself idly recounting happier moments from their sessions. He remembered the way Malfoy’s eyes had lingered on his face when they had met for the first time. He remembered his first visit to Malfoy’s office, the way that Malfoy had gestured lazily to the wingback chair – the chair that Harry had come to think of as his. He remembered their duel, how surprised Harry had been, how much his blood had sung as they fought. He remembered how Malfoy had looked afterwards. His breathy laughter, his pink face, his ruffled hair.
He woke up in the middle of the night with a foggy head and a full bladder. He stumbled to the bathroom and took a piss, wincing at the sight of dried come on his cock. He showered for the first time in days, brushed his teeth until the taste of Malfoy was smothered in toothpaste, and went straight back to bed.
Guilt surged through Draco, but even so, he couldn’t help but stare as Harry clutched at him, yanked him closer, ground against him. He couldn’t tear his away from Harry gripping the desk to keep himself upright while Draco bit at his neck, Harry’s swollen mouth open in a silent gasp, his head thrown back and his eyes closed. As Harry fucked Draco’s thigh, as he wrapped his arms around Draco and prepared to tear his way right through the fourth-strongest wards in Wizarding Britain.
It was all so bizarre—the wedding, The No-Maj Matrix, dancing with Draco Malfoy—that Harry forgot to be self-conscious, even though a year ago, waltzing in front of a hundred people would have been high on his list of Things I Would Literally Rather Fly Naked Through Diagon Alley Than Do. Harry’s fingers kept brushing the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck; every time they did, Draco’s eyes would meet his, and Harry would trip over his own feet. And, every time, Draco would smirk with one corner of his mouth, would adjust his grip on Harry’s waist, and would continue to guide them to the music, his movements smooth and sure.
“Me?” he says, eyes alight. He locks his fingers together under his chin and leans forward. “Do tell.”
“Do you want us to send him a message?” Hermione’s anxious face hovered in his peripheral vision. “I’m sure he’d like to know you’re awake. He was obviously worried.”
“Good.” Malfoy stepped back. “Well, I’m satisfied you’re as ready as you can be. Healer Brisley, if your team is in place…?”
Hermione shook her head. “There’s something else going on, but they don’t know what. They mentioned that it could be a curse—”
I’m so turned on I think I might die. I chance a look downwards, which is an awful, wonderful idea: it turns out that the sight of two people absolutely fucking worshipping your dick is one of the best things you could ever see. I’m honest-to-god worried I’m going to fall over, come, or completely pass out—or all three at once.
“Yeah.” Malfoy shivers, grinds his arse back against Harry, moans. “Your voice is so nice. You feel so good. Please–”
“I don’t know! I’ve never been in a library! It all feels normal!” He stared around helplessly. “The floor creaks when someone walks on it. There’s a bit of a draft. Someone’s done an Air-Freshening Charm to cover up the smell of dusty old books. That bloke in the corner keeps picking his nose. I dunno what you want me to say!”
“Shit, sorry,” Harry said. His hand settled on Draco’s waist and stroked, soothing. “I thought it would be sexier than that.”
The minute stretches. Draco knows he’s seconds away from waking up on his own bed, cold and sticky and uncomfortable. He braces himself for the snap back to reality.
Draco stumbles mid-step. He catches himself on Longbottom’s bedpost, too stunned to be embarrassed, and stares.
The silence stretched. Harry was just about to open his mouth (though he had no idea what he would have said) when Draco spoke.
“I’m sure,” Malfoy said, in that same quiet voice he’d greeted Harry in. He rested his file on his knee.
Potter is glaring and Draco luxuriates in it, the rare force of Potter’s attention almost tangible in its intensity. Then he grabs the front of Potter’s robes, drags him close, and kisses him.
Malfoy’s hole was hot and slick and tight around Harry’s fingers. It felt almost unbearably intimate, so similar and yet so different to finger-fucking a cunt. He pushed in and out a few times, familiarising himself with the angle, watching how Malfoy’s balls moved, how his cock jumped with every push.
Apparently, Malfoy didn’t resist when the Aurors hammered on his door and insisted he join them at the Ministry immediately. He flinched when he saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione waiting for him, stony-faced, in Robards’s office, then failed to cast a simple
Harry dragged his eyes upwards. Malfoy’s wrists were red under the bindings, his shoulders visibly stiff.
“I already told the Aurors I had no idea she’d drawn up the contract,” Draco said flatly. “I wasn’t lying.”
Harry grinned. “Coffee and sugar. Your two favourite things.” It was strange that he remembered Draco’s fondness for both, but he knew it as certainly as if someone had told him that very morning. “You’ll love it. Come on.”
“I’ll leave you two to catch up,” he said shortly. “I’m going to say hello to people. See you later.”
than two orgasms sucked out of me by an immortal Saviour of the Wizarding World, but sure, if you like.”
Harry wished he could say that was the last time. He wished he could say the last time was the time after, when he’d gone to the Leaky Cauldron under the pretext of questioning Malfoy again, not even a week later, and had ended up with Malfoy on his lap kissing him greedily, grinding against him until they came, gasping into each other’s mouths. He wished he could say it was the time after that, when Ginny had sent him an owl saying she was extending her trip and could Harry join her yet. Harry had replied emphasising that work was still busy and had lasted three guilt-ridden days before he’d found himself on his knees in front of Malfoy, Malfoy’s shaky voice teaching him how to deep-throat, Malfoy’s hand buried in his hair. Or even the time after that, when he’d invited Malfoy over to Grimmauld Place and had spent an entire night fucking him in every place and position he could think of.
Hermione started to hum to herself while she sorted the drinks, clearly not intending to respond. Harry braced himself. “Just a research thing,” he said. “Hermione wanted to know more Mind Magic theory.”
“I know, but the pile of post that was waiting for me at home makes me think you might be right. Either way, I just wanted to say that thanks to you, I’m a Mind Healing convert. I’m actually looking for someone to help me mentally manage that sort of stuff better.”
“Probably. But it’s torture seeing you and pretending I don’t wanna—” Potter kisses him, his hand big and warm on Draco’s freckled cheek.
“Okay, it’s been a bit awkward, but I’m just— I’m trying to smush together two different versions of you, you know? The you I knew before, and the you I got to know over the last few months. It’s a bit more difficult than I thought it would be.”
“Understandable,” Harry says with a grin, and I need to close my eyes again at the look they give each other, heavy with affection. Once I’ve taken three deep, calming breaths, they’re both on their feet. Harry is pulling off his T-shirt; Malfoy is watching him appreciatively. I follow his gaze and evaluate Harry anew—I’ve seen him shirtless hundreds of times before, but I’ve never allowed myself to take the time to appreciate the play of muscles on his shoulders, the biteable peaks of his nipples, the inviting line of dark hair that trails beneath his waistband.
“Potter. I need you to know that I would never, ever do this with any other patient. Never.” Harry could almost feel the scrape of Malfoy’s eyes as they roamed over Harry’s face, drinking him in.
“I followed you under an Invisibility Cloak and I pressed my ear to the door of the classroom you were hiding in and I accidentally overheard you, yeah.”
He’d heard enough rumours from Half-bloods and Muggle-borns to ask to be dropped in Soho. The Muggles there were ignorant and eager, and Draco fucked enough of them in pungent club bathrooms to know that it didn’t make him feel any better at all.
He took a final second to allow the mustiness of the passageway to fill his lungs. Then, Hermione’s hand a firm pressure on his back, he opened his eyes, squared his shoulders, and pushed open the door to the main chamber.
“I don’t want to talk about the War. I want to talk about you. I want you to know that anyone who judges you on things you did at sixteen is an idiot. I want you to know how amazing you are.”
“I hope so.” There was a wicked glint in Draco’s eye that made Harry’s insides squirm. “Don’t be late.”
Potter pulls away and peers anxiously at him. “Hang on. You’re not – Someone hasn’t slipped you a love potion or anything, have they?”
Seeing the Dark Mark on Malfoy’s arm had complicated Harry’s initial enthusiasm; the duel even more so. At least Ron’s reaction made sense now; if anything, Harry wondered at his own lack of revulsion. He’d been told over and over, in various tones of awe, about the fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters (of whom Harry had no recollection whatsoever), about what his own place had been in the War. Surely he of all people shouldn’t want anything to do with anyone who had been fighting on the other side.
“You,” Malfoy said simply. Harry opened his mouth to tell Malfoy that he wasn’t making sense, but Malfoy cleared his throat and continued over him. “Anyway, it seems we agree that mistakes were made. I’m happy to put yesterday’s incident behind us if you are absolutely sure the particulars of my past will not impede your progress going forwards.”
The pile of letters was conquered, Harry’s final check-in at St Mungo’s was over and he was, officially, back to normal. (“Of course, you were hardly normal to begin with, were you, Mr Potter?” Healer Brisley tittered. Harry smiled through gritted teeth, thanked her effusively for her help, and shot a Permanent Silencing Spell at the awful cuckoo clock on his way out.)
would be a turn-on, but there it is. With effort, he pushes Draco to the side and tucks him under Harry’s arm. Despite his insistence on motionlessness, Draco allows himself to be manoeuvred without complaint.
Kreacher sneered at him. “Not since Master and his friends destroyed my Mistress’s beautiful portrait.” Horrifyingly, Kreacher’s big eyes filled with tears. “Oh, my poor Mistress!” the elf wailed. “Kreacher has failed you!”
They had decided that, although it was important that they convince the contract that they were legitimately marrying, there were certain wedding customs they could skip: the traditional honeymoon activities being one of them. They also decided against speeches, for obvious reasons. And Draco had conceded that a formal sit-down meal, which would require a seating plan that somehow did not result in a duel breaking out, was not a good idea.
Draco’s gaze sharpened. He looked like the proper Draco again – clever, capable, baffled by the depths of Harry’s stupidity. “Harry,” he said. “I got naked and tied myself up and offered myself to you. I might enjoy a light-hearted tease every now and again, but my commitment to a joke would not stretch this far, I assure you.”
leave, if you want,” Harry corrects, coming to a halt by my side. “But we’re still up for it, if you are. We just wanna make sure— I know it hasn’t been that long, since Hermione.”
Malfoy, who didn’t say a single negative word about the situation, but managed to make his disdain for Harry quite clear with nothing but a raised eyebrow and a curled lip.
Now Harry could feel Malfoy in his head, it was hard to know how he hadn’t recognised it before. Having someone else in your mind was like having someone stand right behind you, except much more intimate. Like having someone stand behind you with their arms around your waist, chin hooked over your shoulder. Harry struggled to gather himself.
Draco briefly considered obeying, but he suspected that once he started, he wouldn’t be able to stop. “Shan’t.”
Harry’s reaction was immediate and intense. His cock jerked against his belly, his head fell backwards and he let out a groan, long and low. Draco took a deep, shaking breath, and slowly fucked his finger in and out. In and out.
“You managed a few hours then?” Malfoy’s tone was derisive, but he seemed mildly mollified. “I’m impressed.”
Harry had been so distracted by the argument, by the thought of dancing, by Draco’s hand in the small of his back, that he hadn’t noticed Draco slowly leading them to the front of the room. They were standing alone in the middle of the dance floor, every face turned towards them.
The first sheet of the scroll is a page of instructions, flowing ink on expensive parchment. Draco scans through them and can’t find anything that puts him off. The incantation will fade from the page once the spell is complete, he learns, and the memory of the incantation will be removed. He nods; he expected something like that. It’s hardly good business sense to offer lifetime access to a charm like this after a single purchase.
“Nobody could ever stop you doing that.” A flutter of affection belied the words. “Picture your mental space for me.”
But everyone had reluctantly agreed that scrapping the first kiss would be an obvious sign that Harry and Draco weren’t taking the marriage seriously. So, Harry had to kiss Draco Malfoy in front of a hundred pairs of watchful eyes (and one watchful marriage contract). And he had to seem happy about it.
“Mmm, no, but we should probably agree on a curriculum for him. I was going to start depravity in April.”
“No wonder Granger has been a snippy little devil recently,” Malfoy says in awed tones. “I’d be annoyed too if I was used to being dicked down by that thing and then had to go on living without it.”
The second tier was okay, too: Draco and Harry were on brooms, reaching for a Fizzing Whizzbee Snitch.
“Cruci–!” he had cried, his tear-streaked face contorted with rage, before he had collapsed onto the bathroom floor, blood spurting from his chest, his face.
“Now we know what it is, we might be able to undo it,” Hermione said earnestly. “It might not be— You might be back to normal before you know it.”
“But,” Harry said, interrupting him. “I can give you some gold. The Leaky Cauldron always has rooms. You can use my Floo.”
Harry had no idea how he was going to keep himself from coming spectacularly as soon as his dick touched the rim of Malfoy’s arse. All thoughts of stopping had entirely gone from his mind. There was no way he could leave. Not when Malfoy was looking at him like that.
A month went by, and Ginny still wasn’t home. The weather was getting cooler, Grimmauld Place less stuffy, but Harry hardly noticed; whenever he wasn’t at work, he was occupied with his new pastime: fucking Draco Malfoy.
“Weren’t you gonna fuck me, Malfoy?” Potter murmurs into Draco’s ear. Draco shivers. “Or am I too insufferable for that?”
“Wow,” he says breathlessly. He’s a mess. Saliva coats his chin. His lips are red and puffy. And he’s still – He’s still rock hard, his cock dark and pink and divine.
Harry had intended the kiss to be a quick peck, a brush of lips and an immediate retreat, but something about the smell of him, the heat of him, had him kissing Draco properly without thinking about it. It was definitely not a peck. It was the sort of kiss that led to more. The sort that meant you
Draco opened his eyes—and his jaw slackened so much that the head of Harry’s cock nearly fell from between his lips. Because Harry from this angle was
“God, Draco,” Harry said. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. “I’ve wanted you for weeks. Longer, maybe.” He remembered the time he’d invited Malfoy back to Grimmauld Place, the way he’d wanted to spend more time with him but hadn’t quite understood why. He remembered the way the dark-eyed stranger had intrigued Harry, until he’d noticed Malfoy and everything else had fallen away. He remembered the pull towards Malfoy, the desperate urge to be closer, when he was lit up and breathless after their duel. Harry might not have realised at the time, but he had wanted Malfoy from the beginning.
“Harry,” Hermione says, visibly fighting the urge to shout. “You said you had returned that for me.”
of his experiences, of course) – how he was clever and professional and patient, how Harry’s mental control had strengthened so much that he’d apparently been doing advanced Occlumency for weeks without even realising. Ron had nodded and gazed solemnly into his tikka masala. Hermione had called them both idiots and helped herself to Harry’s naan.
Harry laughed. “Don’t forget, I’ve been inside your head. I’ve seen how the interactions between us used to go.”
“Potter,” he said. His face was as unguarded as Harry had ever seen it. “You have to move. You’re killing me. You need to fuck me. You need to.”
He shifted his grip without slowing the pace of his hips. One of Malfoy’s legs fell to the bed, freeing Harry’s arm. Harry caught sight of Malfoy’s swollen cock leaking over his stomach and knew immediately that he needed to feel it, needed to feel Malfoy fall apart in his hand, needed to feel Malfoy coming on him, around him, under him.
“Potter,” Malfoy breathed, then his lips touched Harry’s, and Harry found himself kissing back, hard.
“Yeah,” Malfoy said. He kissed Harry again. Harry didn’t protest, lifting a hand to Malfoy’s face to feel the scrape of stubble against his fingers. Malfoy made a soft noise in the back of his throat and pulled away. “Thank you again for, you know. Everything.”
She waved a hand. “Oh, he’s probably with a patient. He’s very in-demand, you know. He’s quite brilliant, quite brilliant.”
“So – so fucking hot – Merlin!” Harry could still hear his cock in Malfoy’s throat through the hoarseness of Malfoy’s voice. He growled, shifted, fucked Malfoy harder. This prompted the loudest noise from Malfoy yet, almost a yelp. “
It was habit by now to lean into Malfoy’s touch, and Harry did so without thinking. Malfoy’s forehead resting against his was a comfort. It gave Harry a few moments to breathe.
“Do me a favour, yeah?” I say, stepping out of my jeans and trainers so I can follow Harry to the bed without bouncing over like the bloody Hopping Pot. “Call me Ron. There are too many bloody Weasleys, and I don’t want to be thinking about any of them right now.”
Harry made a noise of assent and felt Malfoy withdraw from his head. Harry wanted to reach out and pull him back. He flexed his fingers.
Harry fumbles his trousers down without lifting his mouth from Malfoy’s dick. He doesn’t need to – his jaw doesn’t ever ache, and he doesn’t need to breathe. If it weren’t for the teeth, vampires would be perfectly designed for giving blowjobs.
Hermione glanced around the room as if checking for back-up. Finding it empty, she looked at him despairingly, then set her shoulders.
Malfoy whines a weak protest, and the relief of hearing his voice is almost as delicious as the taste of his blood.
Harry throws himself backwards, his fangs tearing from Malfoy’s arm, leaving jagged, oozing gashes. “
“But it’s easy to fix, right?” the man asked, wide eyes looking back and forth between them. “Hermione, your parents – they’re completely fine now. Right? Harry will be back to normal in no time.”
“No! It’s nothing. I can explain more later. Ooh, look, today’s dessert special is rhubarb crumble. I hope they have custard.”
The chamber echoed with applause and wolf-whistles, and all of Harry’s thoughts fled his brain. Draco was still holding Harry’s hand. He was watching Harry carefully.
The question was probably rhetorical, but Draco answered anyway. What was the alternative? More slack-jawed staring?
Harry frowned. Of course he was sure. He’d spent hours in this stupid imaginary room. The thumping noise grew louder, then quieter, like a wireless being tuned. Harry tugged on Malfoy’s presence in his mind to make sure he was paying attention, then exaggeratedly focused on each of the doors in turn. He hoped Malfoy could tell that he was rolling his mind’s eye.
“Fuck, I want to touch you.” Draco bucked his hips, but without his hands and feet to balance, was clearly struggling for the control necessary to take charge.
“Come home with me,” he said. “I don’t mean for— Just for a drink. You didn’t touch your wine. Or—a tea, even. I have lots of Earl Grey.” His mouth quirked into a half-grin, but Draco just stared.
“It wasn’t that one,” Malfoy said quickly. “Although I suppose it could be argued that was my fault, too. If I hadn’t taken Crabbe and Goyle to the Room of Hidden Things, then maybe…” He winced. “Well. The incident Weasley was referring to last night was, I believe, a different one. His oldest brother. Bill.”
“Does he!” It comes out borderline hysterical—I sound a bit like my mum, to be honest, and I don’t want him to think I’m judgemental, so I hastily follow up with a slightly more tempered, “Is he serious, do you think?”
There was a brief moment of bustling activity while Healer Brisley set Malfoy up with a chair, Hermione fussed over Harry and Ron stood by Harry’s bed, stony-faced, gripping his shoulder.
Harry caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s impassive expression splintering into shock before he stormed out of the office and slammed the door behind him.
“More powerful spell-casters may not need the incantation. And besides, learning to identify a foreign presence is a key skill in Mind Magic, especially Occlumency. And while Occlumency is not our end goal, there are many teachings that will be extraordinarily useful in aiding your recovery. And also,” he continued importantly, “I’m the Healer, and I say so.”
Potter snorts. “Well, I didn’t get quite so much out of that bit, but the look on your face was worth it.”
“God, it does,” Potter agrees mindlessly, pushing back against him, taking Draco’s cock deeper. “Feels amazing.
His dazed thoughts must have spilled out of his mouth, because Draco whines, shudders, gasps out, “You too, you feel— Fuck, Harry—” He grabs Harry’s hand and wraps it around his own, around their cocks. “Fuck, this is better than I—”
He found his way to a bathroom and gazed into the mirror. There was the same scar, an angry lightning bolt etched into his skin. The man in the mirror – the same messy-haired man from the photos – stared blankly back at him.
It felt like the entire pub was holding its breath for Tom’s reply. Tom’s eyes darted around again. A sheen of sweat glistened on his bald head.
Malfoy clutches Harry’s shoulder, trying to catch his breath. Unlike Harry, Malfoy really does need the oxygen. With effort, Harry takes a step back.
The trouble was, Harry hadn’t travelled in a Muggle way since his last trip on the Hogwarts Express, and he had quite forgotten how
“Not fair, Hermione?” Ron whirled on her. “Not fair? What’s not fair is that you’re letting Malfoy dig around in Harry’s head when Harry doesn’t know the full story. Just ’cos he can’t remember it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen! He’s sitting there defending him, talking like Malfoy was forced into it, but he wasn’t, was he?” At this, he turned his glare back to Malfoy. “You weren’t, were you? Nobody made you try to kill Dumbledore. Nobody made you let Greyback into Hogwarts so he could hack open my brother. Nobody made you sit there and watch while Hermione was tortured in your front room.”
As they watched, the Harry in front of them lifted his head and looked down in surprise. His right hand reached down and tentatively squeezed his cock through his pants.
Malfoy still looked dazed. “You can’t possibly have hidden something like this,” he insisted. “That’s advanced Occlumency. This isn’t – This really isn’t the sort of conversation we should be having on a whim.”
“Well,” Malfoy said, and Harry caught the disdainful curl of his lip just before it smoothed into a flat line, “if the exercise caused no adverse effects other than the onset of a quick nap, then I feel comfortable getting started.” He took his time finishing his notes, blotting the ink, and putting the notebook and the quill in his desk drawer. He straightened his sleeves, tucked his hair behind his ear, and, finally, picked up his wand.
“So, is that everything, then? Or is there another awful wedding tradition you’re going to spring on me and pretend I was warned about?”
Harry tried again, straining for the elusive feeling of Malfoy, whatever that meant. But the only thing he felt was awkwardness. The image in front of them shifted back to Malfoy laughing breathlessly after their duel.
Harry opened the door and promptly froze. God, there he was. He’d already been looking at the door – unusual in itself, normally he’d be scribbling away in the notebook – but on seeing Harry, he dropped his quill and half-rose from his chair.
Potter’s dark eyebrows drew together, but after a moment’s hesitation, he duly told Draco the full story of his recovery. He talked about how his memories had appeared all at once, but had been difficult to parse for the first week. He talked about how he had spoken to Robards, and was going to lessen his hours with the Aurors. He talked about how he was formally transferring both his Wizengamot and Confederation responsibilities to Granger (who had covered both roles over the last few months and had thoroughly enjoyed herself).
“Congratulations, gentlemen,” the officiwizard said, a smile in his voice. “The Ministry recognises you as a married couple. You may kiss.”
The elf – Kreacher – didn’t seem too friendly, but also didn’t seem too surprised by his presence in the house. The elf had even called him ‘Master’. So … he did live here, then. This elf was his.
Luckily, Malfoy hadn’t expected much from him. Harry considered being insulted by the condescendingly detailed instructions Malfoy had left pinned to the inside of Harry’s bedroom door, but honestly, he needed it. The robes that Malfoy had picked for him were alarmingly complex, and it took Harry a solid forty minutes (and a lot of rereading Malfoy’s note) before he was confident he was wearing them properly.
They were standing so close that the warmth of Draco’s soft snicker—the nice one again—played over Harry’s mouth. “See if your ego will let me lead, then.”
Potter laughs breathlessly, disbelievingly, and Draco has to look away before his heart thumps out of his chest. He diverts his attention downwards and withdraws from Potter’s arse. He hisses. Potter’s hole flexes. A spurt of Draco’s come falls out of him. Draco shivers.
Consequently, when he’d started Hogwarts, Harry had been amazed by Christmas. The idea of a day where he could eat food, open presents and spend time with friends had been nothing short of brilliant. And though the Dursleys continued to send him rubbish like tissues and toothpicks, it didn’t bother Harry nearly as much when he didn’t have to see them sneer at him over a pile of Dudley’s new toys.
“Yeah. First, I – I wanted to say thank you.” This part was the easiest. “Obviously I didn’t realise exactly what – what you were putting behind you when you agreed to work with me. It can’t have been easy, and I wouldn’t have got my memories back without you. So – thank you.”
“Pretty scars.” Draco is still sweaty and breathless, but his pained grimace has faded. In fact, as I watch, a wild-eyed smirk takes its place. I’m not really sure it’s an improvement. “Prettier than mine.”
“I was hoping you’d say that,” Potter says. He steps out of his trousers and walks to his bed – Draco follows without thinking, already reaching out to touch Potter again. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wanked to the thought of having you in my bed, Malfoy,” Potter adds, casual as anything.
“A little.” Harry dropped his wand on the pile of clothes and knelt on the bed. He ran his hand up Malfoy’s leg, just because he could. Malfoy hummed in approval.
“Whoa.” Harry’s eyes widened and he held up his hands in surrender. “I was only kidding.” Maybe Ron had a point – Harry wouldn’t yet go so far as to call Malfoy slimy or evil, but he definitely had a wand up his arse about something.
“What? Oh, you mean Ron and Hermione?” It was a reasonable enough excuse. Harry tried to school his expression to one of regret. “No, I, er – I don’t see much of them any more.”
“Yes,” Draco says slowly, like it’s obvious. “And what I want is to watch Ron Weasley suck your dick. Do you have a problem with that?”
Harry swears and drops his head to Draco’s shoulder, biting it, still watching me. Draco wrenches out one last high, desperate “
. That last time, in the Leaky Cauldron, I was literally begging you to take me home and fuck me, and you walked away. I convinced you to kiss me, wouldn’t leave you alone till you did, and even then you refused to take it further.”
His gaze catches on the Dark Mark, thick and ugly on the soft flesh of his inner arm. He remembers, suddenly, the last time he allowed himself to believe in something, the last time he opened himself up and felt the thrill of thinking he was powerful, that he was doing the right thing.
“They said it might,” Hermione said sympathetically. “They said your memories will settle back into place over the next week.”
“What are you talking about? There were four doors. What’s behind there?” The pounding was harsh, insistent. Not a sound that Harry would call friendly.
—Harry found the door he was looking for: an innocuous little thing to the left of the foyer, laughably small next to the ornate double doors that led to the back of the main chamber. Harry rushed through it and into a plain passageway. The door fell closed behind him. Then he reeled back, his throat tight.
“You’re…welcome?” I try. “Congratulations? I’m going to be honest with you, mate: I dunno where this is going.”
Draco’s breathless narration is still almost unnerving in its obscenity, but I can’t deny that it’s hot as fuck. Especially when Harry growls in response, “Feels fucking amazing. He’s so good at this. Ron, you’re so fucking good at this.”
But it’s hard to avoid staring when he climbs over me, one knee either side of my chest, just like Draco wanted. He’s almost fully hard, which he seems a little embarrassed about, going by his wry grin.
The collar of Malfoy’s shirt is red and wet. Harry’s eyes rake over it, over the dried blood on his neck, the two small puncture marks – already healed.
“No!” Malfoy’s cool presence solidified and suddenly he was standing in front of Harry, blocking his way. “Don’t,” Malfoy said, gentler now. “Regaining that much memory – it will be a very intense process. It will take a while. You’ll have to be monitored in case anything goes wrong.”
“Potter. I…” Malfoy’s long fingers twisted his thick silver ring. Harry drank in the sight greedily. “There are many guidelines concerning what can be construed as improper conduct for someone in the Mind Healing profession, so I just – I want to be clear on exactly what you’re asking before I respond.”
– and Draco nuzzles it, mouths at it through the cotton, drags his lips along the whole swollen length of it.
“Do you think you can ride me,” Harry murmured, their lips brushing. “Do you think you can get on top of me and fuck yourself on my cock while you’re tied up so nicely? You’d look so hot. So fucking hot, Draco, you’re so gorgeous.”
It wasn’t just Malfoy’s gaze I felt; they’re both watching me—Malfoy with an amused eyebrow raised and a sharp curl at the corner of his mouth, Harry with wide eyes, gnawing on his soft fucking bottom lip. God, I hate that I know how soft it is.
“Shh,” Draco repeats. He replaces his hand with his mouth, snogging me to shut me up. As methods go, it’s very effective; it’s not long before I start to lose myself again. His kisses are messy and heated, and I’m very, very aware that I’m still inside him.
“I was hoping to revisit the concept of a mental space today. Have you managed to envisage a place you are comfortable with?”
“Yes. Maybe? It’s hard to say.” Had he been hearing it all along? It felt almost dreamlike, thumping away on the very edge of his senses, dancing with the sound of his heartbeat but unquestionably a separate noise.
Something in Malfoy’s condescending tone dug fingers into Harry’s chest and wrenched his poorly controlled frustration out through his mouth.
The only person who doesn’t seem to be watching him all the time these days, waiting for him to fuck up again, is Harry Potter. Draco had always dismissed his fellow Slytherins’ taunts about their constant eye contact, but when he finds himself seeking out Potter’s glare and finding nothing but the back of his head several times a day, he wonders whether they didn’t have a point.
So, as a compromise, Molly had been given free rein over the cake. Neither Harry nor Draco had seen it yet—a fact that Draco had ranted about on more than one occasion over the last few days, but since he’d been ranting about everything from napkin folds to shoe buckles, Harry hadn’t taken him seriously.
Harry exhaled. That…was not as bad as it could have been. Really not bad at all. It was such a reasonable letter, in fact, that it was almost…disappointing. Harry even began to doubt whether he hadn’t imagined the whole thing. Could he have been so sleep-deprived that he’d deposited Malfoy at the inn and returned home immediately, only to pass out and have an incredibly vivid dream? It wasn’t impossible. Much more probable than the alternative, really. A mind-blowing sexual encounter with Draco Malfoy? Harry, who was with Ginny, and Malfoy, who was an arsehole? He reread the letter, searching for a hidden meaning. Maybe he
“Fuck, don’t.” Draco cringed. He’d done it again—prompted another instinctive hero moment. He couldn’t think of anything worse than Potter scraping up empty, placating words in an attempt to make him feel better. “I don’t want to hear it.”
,” Draco says, his voice high, strained. “Shit, yes— Oh, fuck, don’t stop. Harry, don’t stop, don’t stop, please don’t stop—”
Hermione put her hand on Ron’s thigh. From his wince, Harry suspected she had squeezed it quite firmly.
“I shouldn’t have done that.” Malfoy was flushed, wild-eyed. Harry burned with how much he wanted him.
He should reply, shouldn’t he? It was only polite. After all, most of Malfoy’s letter was humble and gracious. And if he replied refusing Malfoy’s offer of an evening visit, that would be the end of it. Yes, he should nip it in the bud right now.
“I wanted – I want to say sorry, mate. Properly, this time,” Ron continued gravely. “I was stupid. I thought” – he looked at Hermione, who avoided his gaze – “I thought I was being a good friend by looking out for you, but it’s been, er, pointed out to me that I was making things worse. I was out of line.”
“Just for a bit. Everyone’s dancing, nobody will even notice we’ve gone. And the contract won’t mind where we are if we’re together.”
Harry waved a hand. “Oh, some Muggle garden thing. Hermione wanted to go, said it was an insight into Muggle attempts at potion-making or something, I dunno.”
Harry’s head was still resting against the door, so he heard Draco’s low curse. He wasn’t sure he was supposed to.
Harry sat in the wingback chair. The sky had begun to cloud over, snapshots of shadows breaking up the stretches of sun. Malfoy’s pale skin shifted from golden to grey, even as his expression remained stoic, unchanging.
He took a deep breath, prepared for more frustration and bewilderment, but this time, the differences stood out easily. The comforting aroma of hot food and mead usually filled the pub; right now, Harry could smell the same floral scent from the Quidditch pitch – which he realised was also what he’d taken to be an Air-Freshening Charm in the library. The large fireplace, the main thoroughfare for witches and wizards on their way to Diagon Alley, usually burned constantly; even in winter, the room had always been warm and stuffy. Just then, in Malfoy’s mind, it was pleasantly cool.
“It’s one o’clock!” the horrid thing shrieked. “Don’t forget to send those forms, Edith! The Post Office closes at three on Fridays!”
“You could…give him what he wants,” Malfoy said hesitantly. “Make him swear an oath to keep his word. Give him what he wants and…and you can have me.”
Draco’s cock jerked in the loose fist he had wrapped around it. Fucking hell. It was a bad idea. He knew instinctively it was a bad idea, though he couldn’t quite call to mind the specific reasons why. It definitely
“So who exactly is he, this Malfoy?” Harry asked, struggling to keep up. “He seemed fine in Brisley’s office. A little … I dunno…”
Draco moans in anguish and turns away. Even if he’s not going to Azkaban – and, unbelievably, it doesn’t look like he is – he’s not sure he’ll ever live this down. The things he did to Potter. The things he said. The way he felt. It was all very well and good while he thought it wasn’t real – well, it wasn’t well and good, it was hard and desperate and painful – but now he knows that those things actually happened, that Potter
Potter shifts and raises a gentle hand to Draco’s jaw. Draco squeezes his eyes closed and whimpers. Any second now.
“You can see it, right?” The wood of the door was visibly shaking with every thud. It really was like someone was behind it, banging to be let out.
It took Harry a few seconds and a great deal of effort to force his feet to move. He made his way jerkily to stand next to Ron, while Malfoy came to a halt beside the hulking figure of Goyle. The chest that contained the contract was on a small table behind the officiwizard. The rusted metal of it looked darker, more threatening, against the rich colours of their formal robes.
He dragged himself out of bed and stumbled straight to the shower. The shock of cold water was refreshing after his long, sweaty night. He scrubbed at his stomach and chest, allowing his heavy eyes to fall closed. He had tried, in his more lucid moments, to keep on top of the night’s grime, but there was only so much a
“It seems either Lucius or Narcissa—or both—suspected You-Know-Who’s attempt at power would not succeed, and put a safeguard in place for Draco. A contract, tying his life to yours, with consequences in place if the stipulations were not fulfilled.”
Malfoy’s pale, terrified face lit up by a glittering green light, his wand pointed unsteadily at an old man slumped against rooftop ramparts.
. Potter clutches at Draco’s shoulders, lets it happen, meets Draco’s frantic, messy kisses with low noises of approval that Draco absolutely cannot handle. He surges forwards until the backs of Potter’s legs hit the bed and he falls onto the mattress, Draco on top of him, straddling him, their teeth clacking together because Draco can’t tear his mouth away for a single second.
“Oh.” Malfoy’s wary features flickered, then settled into a polite smile. “Of course. You did show a great deal of progress, but further strengthening would only benefit you.” He flipped to the front of his notebook and ran a finger down the page. “I could start you off on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the ten o’clock slot. I don’t think it would need to be more frequent than that–”
“Of course,” Draco said, eyes glittering. “If there’s nothing else you’d rather have me do for you?”
“I’m asking you on a date,” Harry said. “Or, I’m asking if you want to sack off work for the rest of the day and come home with me. Last night I recovered some final memories. I’m definitely interested in revisiting them if you are.”
“Never wanna stop touching you,” Harry assured him mindlessly, dragging his mouth over Draco’s jaw to his neck, starting at the sensation of silk against his lips. He’d quite forgotten about the ribbons.
But Malfoy was already moving, leaning down over the side of the bed and rooting around on the floor. He sat back up, triumphant, Harry’s wand in his hand.
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “I … We really should get back to Legilimency. Do you need to use the Pensieve?”
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice is so strangled, her face so red, that Harry is vaguely concerned she’s literally choking from the force of her own rage. “That was a week ago.”
“So,” Malfoy says. He flicks his wand in my direction and sends a fresh pint sailing over to me. I stare at it blankly. “Why the secrecy? Was Weasley embarrassing himself pining after Granger again?”
“He keeps saying we should bring in someone else to keep him busy when I’m not feeling it,” Harry continues casually.
“Understandable,” Ron said seriously. “Don’t you know, Harry? You have to run when books are involved. It’s not like they’ll be around for hundreds of years or anything.” He chortled at his own joke. “What did your Healer want, anyway?”
The image warped and became the three of them laughing in Ron and Hermione’s living room – then in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place – around their table at the Leaky Cauldron.
“The last time we were in this office together.” Malfoy’s breath caught. Harry continued, his voice low. “A lot of fantasies from the weeks before. And quite a few from before I lost my memory, actually.”
It was difficult to focus on feelings when Harry had no way of closing his eyes, of blocking out the image of Malfoy – and it was obvious now, the Malfoy in front of him was definitely older than a teenager, his cheekbones sharp, his eyes tired – pausing in front of a bookcase, reaching out to run elegant ink-smudged fingers along the books’ spines. Harry stared at the movement, fascinated.
Draco gritted his teeth and thrust his left forearm in front of Harry’s face, but Harry shook his head. Didn’t even look at it. Draco let it fall back to the bed.
“More dancing!” crowed Ginny, appearing at their side and pulling Harry away from Draco. The magic inside him fizzed unhappily. “Is it okay if I borrow him for a bit, Malfoy? I swear I’ll give him back.” She cackled, and didn’t wait for Draco’s
“The Aurors are investigating every property owned by known Death Eaters to make sure nobody is hiding anything nasty,” Hermione said, when Robards seemed stumped by the idea of
“Make sure the door is locked,” Malfoy murmured. “Nice and tight. Really focus on how impenetrable it is. There’s no movement if you pull the handle. No chance of the latch coming loose. Let me know when you’re done.”
“Shit.” Draco drops a hand to his lap—blocked from Harry’s view by Draco’s raised knees. He’s adjusting himself. He’s adjusting his cock—his hard cock, that was pressing insistently against Harry’s thigh not thirty seconds ago.
His accent buffers the edges of it, polishes the vowel into something smarter, sharper. I almost don’t recognise the sound of my own name.
. Harry had a warm, sugar-scented mind and an easy grin. Harry told Draco he was brilliant, and fiercely defended him against the mildest of insults—even if those insults were from his dearest friends. Harry was obstinate, and strong-willed, and sometimes looked at Draco as if he wanted to devour him.
Harry blinked, and found himself back in Malfoy’s office. He squinted at the window; the sun had shifted while he’d been in Malfoy’s mind; Harry’s chair was bathed in warm mid-morning light.
“Mmm. One whole wall of our conservatory used to be—well. I thought it would be nice to— If she were here, I thought she might like…” He shrugged.
“Especially now I only have a few weeks until it’s been six months.” Harry had been trying not to think about it. It had helped that thoughts of Malfoy had been occupying most of his brainpower. But there was no denying it: time was running out.
With no other option, Harry froze. Luna waved her wand and a gust of warm air whirled around him, surrounding him head to foot. Once it had died down, Harry found himself ruffled, but completely dry.
low. The Healers are surprised you could Apparate at all, never mind that you didn’t Splinch yourself worse.” She shuddered, and grabbed Harry’s hand. Harry let her squeeze it, grateful for the grounding sensation of her touch.
I don’t really know how to navigate this one, so I say carefully, “Well, he’s not exactly bad-looking, is he?”
It took two songs for Harry’s magic to settle, and two more for his hands not to feel empty, his fingers remembering the soft tangle of white-blond hair, the warmth of another palm against his. By the fifth song, Harry found himself swept away by the persistent joy of his friends—of Neville belting out the lyrics to
. It was a complete overload—the hot tightness of Harry’s hole and the sweet smokiness of his mind threatened to overwhelm him, but compounded with that was Harry’s pleasure, which roared through him with an intensity Draco could hardly believe. He’d never felt anything like this. He’d never felt anything even close to this.
Harry sat in tight-jawed silence while Malfoy righted himself. He straightened the pile of parchment on his desk. Lined up his quill against his notebook. Cleared his throat. Laced his fingers together.
The officiwizard waved his wand and one bowl became two, though Harry did not see how it happened, did not see them separate or duplicate—it was as if there had been two bowls the whole time.
There was a sharp crack; Draco jumped, his heart in his throat. He looked around wildly for the attack, but of course there wasn’t one. Or, at least, nobody was trying to curse him.
Potter blinks. Then he laughs – once, brightly, in a way Draco hasn’t seen him laugh all year. Draco wants to
Malfoy allows Harry to guide the phial to his mouth. Almost immediately, a pink flush colours his cheeks. Harry eyes it with interest, but the urge to
Malfoy hesitated. “The memory of the moments before our duel,” he said. “With–” A stiff gesture to his left arm. “It would be understandable if that is a problem.”
. He breaks the kiss and raises his head to nip at it, to run his lips along it, fancying he can feel a bump on the bridge where Draco stamped on his face two years ago. The thought is hysterical – Draco broke Potter’s nose, now he’s kissing it – and there’s no reason for Draco to suppress the giggle that builds in his chest, so he lets it come, lets it burst out of him, the ridiculousness of Harry Potter’s nose under Draco’s lips too much for him to bear.
