The Department of Mysteries … what their work was remained shrouded in secrecy, though Harry knew that they undertook much of the Ministry’s research and development. Harry also knew that they shared with the Auror Force the responsibility of monitoring the Web.
“We would like to respectfully request your assistance,” Harry said, refusing to be baited.
“Ah … you academics do get some things right at times, I suppose.”
My cock stirred a little. I revised my earlier opinion. Maybe I could be persuaded to be in the mood.
Potter’s face tightened as he took out his wand. “I take it you’re not willing to come willingly?”
“Well, the inscription is definitely Koine, which spread across the Mediterranean through Alexander the Great’s conquest, and it says, ‘made to the order of Aristotle, tutor to the King of Macedon.’ So there’s no doubt that this is the object we’re looking for. The object itself is made from bronze,” Draco held it up to the sun, “gold, and this mineral looks like silver, but –”
A tinny chuckle. That Malfoy sure is interesting, Hedwig said. He’s smart. I like him.
“I’m good as can be,” Ron replied, eyeing Harry with obvious distrust. “It’s been a while, Harry.”
“I’m just a little jumpy,” Draco said. He attempted a smile, though he wasn’t certain if Harry could see it. “I’m sure you understand.”
“We’ll have officers there but we can’t make it as fast as you,” Shacklebolt said. “We’re monitoring your movements now and it appears you have a tail.”
“Potter can attend too.” Riddle’s face tightened. “It is a pity that he is such a thorn at my side. He would have been such an asset. And we do so need fresh talent in this organization. Unfortunately, he has chosen to oppose me like his parents before him.”
“There isn’t much the forensics team can turn up that we don’t already know,” Potter said. “Doesn’t make sense to leave the flat in a mess to me.”
I nodded. “I should head home anyways. Don’t know what kind of damage Potter will have done in my absence.” I rose shakily. There was an itching dissatisfaction that her mention of the Weasel . It wasn’t dislike, not anymore – I was just drinking with his wife, after all. It touched a chord of jealousy in me, that they had each other to go home to.
“How’s that any different from what I suggested?” Harry said with a displeased squint.
“Saw the news about the Prof. Shaken. Might be fanciful but have decided to hide the analysis from him in safe place.”
But –
“You are as capricious as ever,” Cross observed, “though I believe you should moderate that habit. It’s vexing. It does not win you friends.”
I still had a fondness for the place, tainted as it was by the horrors of the end of the War. All those memories, happy and unhappy, were snarled together.
Dawlish set down his teacup. “Pleased to meet you.” His voice was impassive.
I wasn’t sure what would happen next. I felt that this sort of occasion called for a kiss, or at least a hug. And Malfoys did not do public displays of affects.
“Surely you deserve to take a break for the night,” Fudge protested. “Come and join me for some refreshments at Whitehall. Of course, we’ll have to say a few words to the media first.”
“Let me keep it for now. As insurance.” He set it down on the arm of the chair.  I eyed it, but made no further movement.
“What’s his name?” Draco asked. “Do you know it?” And what’s your connection with them?
“How do you know all of this?” I asked. “And are we … members of the Circle, too?”
This must be the ‘new investors’ Lucius referred to. And this new project … what did that mean? The name Rosier sounded familiar, but it didn’t bring to mind any immediate results.
“Now come on, don’t be shy. We don’t bite, you know.” Blaise gave Harry a hunter’s smile. “Unless you like that, of course.”
“You have to wear one when you were an Auror, didn’t you?”
“Same as always. How are things with you?”
“That’s wise of you,” Riddle said. “Now come with me, both of you. We’ll go into the lab where you’ll have the equipment to do your work, Draco. Bella, Dolohov, bring Potter with you. Make sure he doesn’t try anything foolish.”
“We’re going to take it to two floors down and walk up,” Harry explained. “It won’t be a surprise, since others are also working in the building right now. And I can guess the stairwell is probably less watched than the lift entrance.”
“We have an elite team of Aurors and Hit Wizards,” Granger cut in smoothly. “We’re not going to let Draco on the front lines. He’ll be safe and secure behind us. And if Cross is there,” Granger’s face set in determination like Boudica of old, “he’ll have to get through me before he can touch Draco.”
It glimmered darkly. Harry looked at me. “Ready?”
Faint amusement crackled in his eyes. “It’s a divorce, not a bereavement, Malfoy. And it was amicable. We just had too many differences to be a couple, that’s all. Ginny and I are still friends.”
He was reconsidering Harry’s suggestion to go wait in the car when he heard the unmistakable sound of gravel under rubber tires sounded.
That knowledge tightened his insides, and Draco dropped into fighting stance, the memory itching for a release in the form of his fists hitting flesh.
“I don’t think so,” Finnegan said, pulling Harry out from his recollection. Harry wondered if he should have Hedwig release some medbots to take care of his semi-hard erection. That would be an egregious waste, he decided, and he shifted in his seat instead.
“Ron and Hermione’s house!”
You might be able to make better sense of this than I do, since you are in his field. But please don’t do anything foolish. These are dangerous criminals that I have incurred the wrath of, and I don’t want you to endanger your life. Stay safe and give my regards to your mother.”
Damn schoolboy crush.
And so was the book-key.
“Oh.” I hadn’t expected that tidbit. I filed it away, in case there was use for it later. Though I couldn’t claim to be much better with my own paperwork. “Well, if you’re taking my report, I was attacked in the middle of Hyde Park earlier. With magic.”
“I understand you’re an antiquities expert, Mr. Malfoy. Perhaps you can verify it for us.”
“I’m giving it serious consideration,” I said easily. I tried to adopt what I imagined to be my father’s manner when he dealt with recalcitrant minions. “It’s progress. Don’t disdain it.”
It dawned on his face that he slipped. He forced a smile. It looked as unnatural as if he put on a tutu and began dancing Odette’s solo from Swan Lake. “I just mean, you would know if the book isn’t misplaced from our collection. Especially if you have been working with it.”
Or was it the other way? Potter had made it clear he played both sides of the fence – perhaps Ginerva would not stand for it. Did not seem to in line with the reputed Weasley ethos of acceptance to me, but then again, she might have made an exception since it was her husband.
Harry turned back to Finnegan. “Have Dolohov and Pettigrew revealed their source?”
“Goyle! Shut up!” Harry gave an uneasily smile to a man fixing him with a glare. “My friend’s an idiot. And drunk. What could be worse than a drunk idiot?”
“Do you think Cross survived that?” Granger broke into the train of my thoughts. She shuddered. “That spell. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t think anyone could live through that. And we had surrounded the house with Anti-Apparation Jinxes and Snaring Charms.” Her face paled for a moment, as the possibility she might have trapped Cross in the house occurred to her. Then she set her expression resolutely.
The sight was even more horrifying seen in the sky. A plume of smoke curled, almost lazily, up, and the stucco facade with its ivy-lined greenery was lit from within with an unearthly orange glow.
He leered at me. “But I can’t help it, Draco. It’s part of my chart. And admit it – you like it.”
Dolohov was already passed out on the floor, with what was going to be a nasty gash on his head. In the corner, Draco saw that Riddle, too, remained unconscious. The two remaining combatants, Harry and Bellatrix, were each behind makeshift barricades: Harry having used the long table in the center and Bellatrix huddling behind one of the smaller desks.
“In that age, it was common for wizards and witches to fear Muggles,” I said, the historian in me itching to lecture. “There was a great deal of hatred and mistrust on both sides. It made sense in light of the historic persecutions and a sense that wizards were beset on all sides and dying out.”
“I – uh –“
Fudge and Malfoy were shocked, too.
She frowned. “And you trust these visions?”
Greyback inched in. “Watch him,” he ordered the guard, who went to stand over Harry.
He cocked a smirk at me. “More intimate than having my tongue in your mouth?”
Despite the glorious day, a chill descended in the room. What he had just told me beggared all belief. To break a sacred part of yourself into bits – I turned away from Potter, appalled. To think that my family and I had been in thrall to such a man, if he could even be called a man. It was more than the megalomania, the wanton killing, the genocidal tendencies and his emphasis on blood purity. It was ….
It was simple and straightforward, not a whiff of intrigue about it. It also portended the most danger for Harry.
“Oh. I’m sorry.” I couldn’t fathom the idea of Potter being a neglected child. It never really occurred to me that the Golden Boy wasn’t so golden to some.
“Ah, forgive me for my appalling lack of manners. Let me introduce you two. This,” he gestured to Harry, “is Commander Harry Potter of the Auror Force. One of our rising stars and its next Head.”
Oh, what the hell. I grabbed Harry by his lapels in for a more thorough kiss that had the half the room staring. Someone wolf-whistled.
“You don’t have to decide right now,” she interjected. “It was just an idea I had. I still need to go back to the office to flesh it out.”
Rosa gave an understanding smile. “I understand. You can call your partner in, then. I’ll give what’s left of your allotted time to him.”
It was with some relief he saw the Humvee Harry had set off in this morning. Draco honked at them desperately, trying to catch their attention.
“Ready?” He crouched, battle-ready. I mirrored his stance, adrenaline pumping, terrified – and not a little excited.
After a few minutes of looking around, Harry’s eyes fell on the console. There was nothing else in the room which appeared out of the ordinary. “Hedwig, access the console.”
Potter shrugged. “I don’t think you’re a liar,” he said, “and I don’t think you’re crazy – though that’s always a debatable point. Besides, I found objects from the Founders in my own time, and Hermione still keeps me up to date on Ministry affairs from time to time. What you told me makes sense.”
Bracing himself, he ran back to the lab. He met Wormtail creeping out the door, looking furtively behind him. There was the unmistakable sound of exchanging gunfire.
Also, allergies. To prove this point, Draco sneezed, rather explosively, attracting the disapproving attention of the ones who had previously been lusting after his boyfriend.
“What, was the yacht not up to your standard?”
His erection sprung, half curved. Blaise smirked at me as he slipped out of his undershirt. We laid together, rubbing and kissing and pulling and rolling. It was a whirlwind of sensation, the buildup mild but no less enjoyable for that.
Breadcrumbs?
“We’ve known each other since we were children, before Hogwarts,” I said. “I met Blaise when his mother was still with her second husband. Or was it third? I can’t really remember.”
Wasn’t the Potters’ story reason enough to avoid using the Grimoire? I was no Dark Lord, but even if I managed to show a resilience to the temptation, unscrupulous individuals might attempt to take advantage and manipulate me. I was no fool, but I wasn’t infallible. My past made that clear as day.
As he clicked in the wrist-prong to the inner socket of his wrist, Harry leaned back, ignoring the slight tickling of static electricity running up his arm. It was just a trick of the mind; Harry knew that the fiberoptics connecting to his internal bio-mechanical enhancements wouldn’t affect his nervous system. The digital signals sent by the computer traveled along in a parallel path, where it was processed by Harry’s implanted brain-chips.
“We searched everywhere we thought your father might have considered safe,” Harry said, spearing a piece of chicken and wrapping it in the bread. “I can ask Kingsley again, but I don’t think it’ll turn up anything. Maybe it’s not at Malfoy Manor.”
“Why couldn’t you have stayed with a museum or something instead of competing with criminals in this treasure hunt?” he had asked sourly. “I hope you know, but archaeologists don’t do adventures like these anymore. If they ever did.” Then he had made Draco promise to be careful, not do anything ridiculous or dangerous.
This was it. This must be the Decoder that Rosier thought would unleash the full power of the Shield of Achilles.
Harry’s proximity meant that Draco could feel the warmth from Harry’s body and smell Harry’s scent. Even in the middle of a desert war zone, it seemed that Harry still used the same cologne. It was the brand Draco used to buy Harry for holidays. And underneath it all was masculine sweat, the familiarity of it all adding salt onto the wound Harry’s reappearance had split opened.
“When the alternative is oppressing Muggles and treating them as animals, then yes, we need the Statute of Secrecy to keep us separate. And that’s not what’s at question here: the issue is how the Dark Arts might have been created to ‘defend ourselves’,” Potter showed great restraint in refraining from making air quotes around the phrase, “but it’s turned into a way for wizards to oppress both Muggles and other wizards.”
We walked in silence until we reached a corner on the streets. I waited as she casted a discreet Muffling charm.
“Alright,” Riddle interrupted. “You proved your point. I don’t need a thesis. I just need to know if you’re reasonably sure.”
I nodded. “And just so you know, you need to wear your own tie this time. I returned all of Blaise’s.” Blaise, on hearing his name, turned and gave a small wave and a wink. He went back to his conversation with Weasley, of all people.
The silence stretched on for several heartbeats. Draco didn’t dare move. Without Fletcher, they would have nothing. Not a single clue on how to find Riddle. Fear was a useful tactic, but if they had pushed Fletcher too far ….
“You’re smarter than you act, Potter. This connection empowers our SI to be faster than your average, but it has also risks. When we use it, it drains our body, and we end up needing to … medicate … to deal with the effects of it.”
“I’m not sure …. But somehow, I don’t think the Circle will let us take it so easily. They’re doubtlessly keeping an eye on us.”
“Greetings! Welcome to Godric’s Hollow.”
The young man snapped a salute. “Yes sir.”
“Hi. I was wondering if you had some free time this afternoon. Really, you do? That’s wonderful. Do you want to meet around at the old place? Yes, that café that you like. Or we can go to a Pret if that’s easier? No, you hate Pret? Well, the café then. See you soon.”
“Ah … well, you would have done the same for me,” Draco said, embarrassed. He had moved instinctively, without considering the consequences. It wasn’t something that needed to be lauded for.
“With all this racket your lot is raising, I can barely take a piss in peace, let alone sleep,” I said, but there was no real edge to my words. I looked at Potter amusedly. “You’re good with cats? Maybe you should come with me next time my mother forces me back home for tea. You can play with her cat and distract her from getting hair all over my robes.” I knew better than to pry right now, even though I so desperately wanted to.
“I’ll go up first,” Harry said gently. “And pull you up from there.”
And met with blazing pain. I was on the highest tower the night I failed to kill Dumbledore – I was faced with the Dark Lord, his face as still as marble while he raised his wand and agony twisted my very veins – I saw a Death Eater casually backhand my mother as she stood between me and him –
Potter fell silent, and I regretted my harsh tone. We had been getting along so well … Finally, I asked: “So now what?”
“Are you sure you don’t want to get that looked at by the hospital, Mr. Malfoy?” Shacklebolt asked.
I quickly packed and made my way out. I tried to slip past the librarian, but even as I reached the door, I felt his baleful stare on my back like knives.
Shit. Their exchange had caught even more attention. Even the inebriated Goyle sensed the frisson of menace in the air, inched away from Harry.
All these thoughts hurt my head. So I pulled him down into a kiss.
It seemed to suckle at the wound; I felt a pinch and wetness. My blood dripped into the mercury-like liquid, and it evaporated until it took the form of a silver gas.
Granger and her husband were waiting for us in the drawing room. Their faces were pinched with worry, and Granger ran up to Potter with a worried “Harry!” as the Weasel cuffed him on the shoulder.
“I could say the same for all of us here,” I retorted. We had. It was our way of proving ourselves after the War, even with the doors shut in our face, that we still had value. Despite the stereotype of Slytherins at the fabulously wealthy landed class, most of us were driven and determined to make our mark. We were not united by an emphasis on blood purity; that came out of an ethos that prized continuity.
“I refuse to indulge in your perversities, Harry Potter,” I sniffed. I pulled him down to lie on top of me. “But the ward is empty except for me right now.” I wriggled one hand under his shirt. “And Healer and patient is one of my fantasies,” I whispered.
He was shirtless, his bare chest bronzed even in the washed-out lamplight. Broad in the shoulders and well-defined, with a light dusting of dark hair, it tapered down in a lean physique that remained powerful despite the overall slender build. I stood, transfixed, my eyes traveling down to Potter’s ridged stomach, taut with muscles. My fingers flexed, and I longed to glide along its surface.
“You did for me,” she pointed out. She quirked a smile at him. “Play with him when you come over. He’s fond of you.”
Not so attractive now. Harry stared back at Grey Eyes, striving for a professional tone. “The control chip was disabled. The car couldn’t be stopped except manually,” Harry said. “Sir,” he added the honorific like an afterthought.
“Oh, Potter, it’s far more than that.” Malfoy ran his own finger over it, gently, tenderly. “This is a connection to the Death Eater’s own network, a private one that connects our SIs to the leader.”
There was a muffled protest from Fletcher. Harry increased the force in his grip.
Potter smiled at that. “It’s hard not to, when his attention is focused on you like that.” His smile faded. “Not that it’s any of my business but are you two….”
Harry walked besides Draco.
Cross displayed no emotion. He looked around. He was hemmed in by a crowd of red. Battle-toughened Aurors watched him with flinty eyes, with wands directed squarely at his chest. His eyes belied his recognition that he was outmatched, flicking as he analyzed his chances.
“I doubt they’re treated as trash,” Harry said. “These will probably end up in the hands of private collections and the money going to buy bullets and explosives to kill our friends.” His jaws clenched and Draco knew Harry was thinking about the men stationed at the airbase who had become his comrades and family in the long time Harry had been in the country.
“It’s my fault,” I said. My voice barely registered against the wind. “I led him to the Manor. If it weren’t for me, that man wouldn’t have come to the Manor. I should’ve never come.”
But now I did. “It’s likely no one else touched the key except for Slytherin himself. Can you speak Parseltongue to it? Maybe it’ll respond to that.”
“Not that I expect many visitors would be coming here, but wouldn’t it be odd to display two stolen artifacts in the middle of the hall?”
“The Resistance, the Order of the Phoenix.” There was rumor of a movement that had been organizing to oppose the Ministry. Harry had heard whispers swirling around this organization calling itself the Order of the Phoenix. The phoenix … the mythical bird that renews itself from ashes.
I had to look away before I become sucked in any further. I coughed. “So what’s the plan? I was thinking that we go back. To the Manor. To retrieve the book-key. And you can take the opportunity to look for clues.” There was only the slightest hitch in my voice when I thought of the Manor. Granger said most of the damage was contained, and yet I could not erase the image of it burning —
“He wanted to make himself useful,” I said neutrally.
I shoved those thoughts aside, adopted a casual grin. “You know us academic types. We’re the oddballs. I thought it might’ve help me think.”
Draco thought that was a bit rude. “That’s ironic, coming from you.” He sat on Harry’s desk. “Who was it that sent the entire Hogwarts into a frenzy because he wanted to explore the so-called haunted house on the edge of the forest grounds? Or tackled and held down the robber who broke in during our seventh year?”
Surprisingly, it was Draco who had finally gathered up his nerve and said it. It surprised him as much as it did Harry. They were both reticent in their own way to openly express how they felt.
“I suppose that makes sense,” Harry conceded. “What is our plan when we arrive?”
“We’ll check if the coast is clear,” Harry said, “and check all the rooms.”
“No, wait.” Malfoy stopped. His hand shone with the kaleidoscope of colors refracted from the floor tile. “This schematic is different.”
But now it was all moot.
I nodded. “It’s not a big village; I’ll manage.”
“We believe a significant source of the group’s income is from distributing opium and arms for the Taliban and various other terrorist groups in the Middle East,” Dawlish said. “And that their activities directly clash with our interests overseas. Your father’s work, I believe, related to a project they had that involved smuggling looted artifacts from the region to finance some of these unsavory groups.”
My head was heavy. I had a sudden urge to lay on his shoulder. “Do you think they’ll get back together again?” I nodded at the now snogging couple facing Blaise and me. “I mean – as in a relationship.”
“How to break the protection on the book-key,” I said. “It seems like an Inesco Loop – a memory loop – that’s meant to trap anyone who wants to use it. And it seems to only react to someone with Slytherin ties, so that’s also a protection. Frankly, I’m at a lost for what to do.”
It was powerful and subtle. Unlike the Dark Lord’s overwhelming brute force, the librarian’s probe sought to distract and lull one into a sense of complacency before he struck.
“Yes, I’m sure you were a brilliant teacher. Much better than old Snape.”
“Sorry,” I repeated.
“What, spank me?”
“Do you know where to go?” Draco asked. “How are we going to get out of here?”
“I don’t want them to hurt you either, Draco. So next time, stay in the camp.” He sighed. “I should’ve never asked them to bring you out here.”
“What are you ordering?” he asked, trying on a smile that signaled he accepted the end of that particular conversation without rancor. He didn’t, and he knew he wouldn’t fool Harry. They could talk about this some other night.
“Well,” Granger spoke in a lecturing tone. “It’s very common for magical objects of a certain nature to take the shape of whatever its current holder’s affinity is. For example, in 1654, the Acronium took the shape of a ruby brooch because its owner at the time, a Lettice Hollis, was—”
“He will do no such thing,” Potter snarled before I could say anything. He raised his wand. “Come any closer and I’ll turn you into the toad you are.”
“Don’t move.” It was Weasley. He held Draco in place, firmly but surprisingly gentle. “Hermione’s going to get the first aid kid.”
“I couldn’t think of anywhere else,” Harry said sheepishly. “It’s one of the few places where I know you and I will both unconditionally like.”
“Didn’t stop them from cutting me loose the minute my father’s indictment hit,” Draco said under his breath. That still smarted, how they explained with apologetic faces they couldn’t afford to take on another junior curator. It had been clear to all that the real reason was his father’s face splashed across the tabloids with ever more lurid headlines.
“Oh, but my dear Draco, we are so much more than your storybook villains.” Dolohov leaned in. His breath was foul. “You’ll find out soon enough.  I suppose young Harry here hasn’t told you anything.”
“What is it?” Harry couldn’t help feeling a sense of foreboding at the way Malfoy was staring at him so intently. “What’s wrong?”
“Understood.”
There was enough fury in Harry to momentarily shake off the sluggishness he now could attribute to the drug. He glared at Malfoy, focusing on every detail of that profile that refused to turn and face him.
They grappled with each other, wrestling and rolling as the boat pitched from their struggle.
Harry nodded. “I agree. I think there’s probably an entrance around here somewhere concealed by magic. But do you know how to find it?”
She was also the only one to object to Draco’s termination when news of his father’s arrest broke. That had been the glue that cemented their friendship.
Blaise noticed my gaze, raised an eyebrow in a knowing gesture. They’d been seeing each other on-and-off since our Hogwarts days. It was only a matter of time before they ended up married with a few brats along the way, I reckoned.
He looked directly at me – and I blushed. I let it hastily.
“It’s a date,” Draco said, and blushed at his choice of word. “That is, if we ever figure out what to do,” he added lamely.
“You did a good job, and then because of that business with your father, the museum you were part of fired you.”
Harry scowled. “Stop showing off. And there’s nothing that the Ministry databases don’t have.”
“Persuasion is sometimes more effective than magical coercion,” Potter said sagely. “It’s more foolproof and there’s a power in having someone join you willingly instead of forcing them through physical or magical means.”
Cocky, too. An attribute Harry would have scarcely thought apt for a computer, but Sentient Intelligence programs had both the self-aware of a living being and immense calculating speed that dwarfed a human’s.
“Blaise, what the fuck are you doing? Piss off.”
I jumped up, my hands eager to close in around his throat –
“Oh. That.” I looked away. “Sorry. I just don’t think I’m ready, with all that’s going on.” I crooked a small smile at him. “A secret society is after me, you know.”
Draco almost laughed.  When. Not if. When.
“You alright?” Potter whispered. Unlike me, his wand was clenched in anticipation, not anxiety; his eyes lit up, his cheeks flushed, similar to his appearance when we kissed.
“No. He piques my interest.” Riddle considered his men. “Double the effort to recover the papers. And as insurance, retrace our communications with the ones whose research led us to the Shield.”
What Draco had picked up was not so exotic. It was, for his father, rather prosaic, detailing how his day went.
Draco tried to get up. His body refused to move. He heard more cars, and Shacklebolt’s voice speaking to Harry in an undertone.
“Be glad that this is one of the most secure bases that we have,” Harry said, appearing out of the darkness.
As I pulled the short end over, I was struck at how close I stood to Potter. Our chests were almost flush, and I could smell his aftershave. I blinked.
He stopped suddenly. I bumped and nearly bounced off him.
I gritted my teeth. It was endurable but unpleasant. I knew from my training that as awareness of mental invasion grew, the more painful the process became. It was the mind’s natural way to defend itself.
“I’ve never known my parents,” Harry blurted.
“Why did he leave the Ministry?” I asked. “And he’s divorced Ginerva Weasley?”
It was crowded and dark and above all – it was noisy. Filled with more people than Harry had imagined living in Underground, the Leaky Cauldron was like nothing Harry had ever seen. Pulsing strobe lights lanced across, illuminating men and women dancing in indecently close quarters. There were – Harry averted his eyes hurriedly – scantily clad women with nothing but feather boas covering their breasts and shirtless men in tight thongs that showed the curve of the men’s –
She blocked her eyes with a grunt, her grip on the gun slipping.
That wasn’t exactly the conclusion that Harry had come to, but he refrained from comment.
“One does not need be a true believer to be a tool,” the voice said. The man in the armchair remained out of sight. “The Malfoy boy has Slytherin qualities aplenty – ambition, cunning, a desire to redeem himself. Those, too, can be manipulated. After all, is that not how we used the last candidate?”
“Then I’ll need to give you a backrub when this is all over.” Even without looking at his face, I could hear the grin in Harry’s voice. “Maybe a foot rub, too. For your tired, old, aching bones.”
“Merlin, Harry! Don’t sneak up on a man like that!”
“This? This is my SI. Metis, say hello to Commander Potter.”
Potter looked at me with a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth. “You love your coffee, don’t you?”
It was also the dream of every archaeologists to be the one that discovers fabled items out of legends. Even now, a thrill ran through Draco. “Do you think the Shield is real?”
“We don’t want to attract unwanted attention,” Hermione piped in. “But Ron’s right – the last time we sold it was over a year ago to anonymous buyers.”
I sighed. Potter had been open with me – it was the least I could do to be serious. I looked at him. “Look, Potter, we’re not a good match for each other. You have your responsibilities, I have mine. We’re after different things too. I don’t think I’m ready for any kind of commitment. I already have enough as it is.”
“He’s been involving himself in politics now,” Shacklebolt said. “Meetings with Fudge, discreet efforts to rehabilitate his family name. It’s interesting that his name should appear in the course of all this. Of course, this could all be coincidence.”
“And leave Harry’s wallet.”
Then light burst.
It had mattered more than he told himself, how his mother had so easily accepted Harry as a fixture of Draco’s life. Her pained expression whenever Draco and his father had another one of their fights tore at Draco – he knew it had been one of her greatest wishes that father and son were not so at odds with each other.
A black cab rolled past.
Fletcher gave him a scornful look. “You have got to be joking.”
“You don’t have to help if you don’t want,” I said, with some hesitancy. “I’m sure my mother will be happy to entertain you.” I knew if I were in Potter’s stead, I would have stormed out already, and probably put miles between myself and some libertine who refused to acknowledge the tension between us.
Draco gave Shacklebolt a dubious look. He worried for Britain if all the men responsible for national security were like these two. “An expertise in archaeology doesn’t make me the best man for the job. I work at Christie’s, for God’s sake. I’m used to temperature-controlled labs and prissy curators, not bombs and criminals.”
I raised an eyebrow and gestured at the mess around me. “You’re going to have to be more specific.”
“Good. Now leave me. I wish to examine this further.”
Harry leaned back. “I have great taste in literature,” he said with wounded dignity. “I don’t think I want to read any of your boring histories. Although yours aren’t that bad – as far as historical writings go, they’re actually quite entertaining.”
“Do you want to check this one out?” Draco whispered. “It’s much more guarded than the other ones we’ve come across.”
Except Draco had experienced something – otherworldly – when he had touched the Shield. He still didn’t know what to make of it. Here in bustling London, surrounded by the solidness of modern life, with the grind of the espresso machine in the background and the beeps of cellphones, it was hard to think that Draco had felt a surge of mystical power.
Focus, he reminded himself. It was agony to tear himself away. Harry treaded water next to him, patiently waiting for Draco to take the lead.
“Do you ever leave that thing?” Harry asked.
Draco saw Harry, battered, glare defiantly. But there was also a flicker of triumph, and Draco knew what he needed to do.
As he asked those questions, he turned his gaze straight at me with those dead fisheyes. There was a curious sensation, as if I were floating as I looked into them. They were really ugly … I could not help but try and turn my thoughts away, letting them drift pleasantly back to my morning, when I had breakfast and then readied to leave, getting up to check on the book –
Harry snorted. “What virtue? I didn’t see any virtue the other day when you –”
In fact, the awful part of being a prisoner was the anticipation, grinding on my nerves like dull steel against the whetstone. I had no idea when Cross would visit again; I knew he watched and listened to my every move. At first, I amused myself by yelling obscenities and making rude gestures throughout the house. When nothing happened, I was forced to confront the fact that I was well and truly stuck.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry snapped, his face red. “Don’t ruin the moment.”
“Must have been fun playing hide-and-seek with your friends, though.” Potter still spoke in that wistful, dreamy voice. “Though I guess it can be a little scary too.”
Lost manuscript … What if the book in the vision I received was a lost manuscript? My pulse raced. It made sense! A manuscript in green with the ouroboros. It was a common enough symbol, used in both alchemical texts as well as many others. Was it related to alchemy? That narrowed the time frame to pre-18th century.
“But the Chamber of Secrets –”
But somehow Harry had an urge to impress on Malfoy that, yes, despite Malfoy’s sarcasm, Malfoy and his kind were able to sleep safe at night because Harry and his men risked their lives in the streets.
Hostile fire detected, Hedwig said.
Draco had gone straight to find Shacklebolt after his conversation with Luna. At the time, it had seemed like an astounding discovery, and Draco had wanted to share that straight away. In hindsight, it perhaps could have been extrapolated from what they already knew with a bit more research. Shacklebolt, however, still thanked Draco with the gravitas of the Queen awarding a CBE.
They were careful to tiptoe up, despite Draco’s urge to take two at a time. Even so, it still rang with the brightness of a clarion. Draco swallowed. Harry had taken his gun out, tucked discreetly under his other arm as to shield it from view.
“First-timers are always jumpy,” the man said, with his easy smile still on.
“What do you mean ‘can’t be communicated over the Web’? Our lines are the most secured out of all the Ministry.”
That meant nothing. Now that I experienced that – vision, there was no other term for it – I knew this was no ordinary tome. I heard of books like this; my father had once told me of a journal carrying a fragment of a soul that defied all attempts at magical inspection.
“Auror training,” he said. “Though this was probably not what they had in mind.”
An Afghan man came in, armed with the standard machine gun Draco had begun to associate with this place. It was a pity, that such a beautiful country was reduced to a few negative impressions.
Our relationship had drastically improved. He still took every opportunity he could to lecture me on the duties of a proper Malfoy, but at least we no longer ended our conversations in screaming matches.
Draco had no idea what the depth of his father’s participation was. Nor did he cared to find out. The body was buried, and Lucius’ secrets with it. Draco did not want to exhume all that.
Harry blinked. As his lids flickered, the image changed, zooming in to the section of green he was closest to. There was nothing remotely matching the vehicle’s description that Harry had been provided.
Hogwarts ... it seemed appropriate that I would find the location of Slytherin’s Grimoire there. It was the center of it all, wasn’t it — that old castle that still played such a large role in all our lives. I wondered if Slytherin ever felt any regret when he abandoned it and the other Founders.
My mother frowned at me. “No need to be rude, Draco. It was only a suggestion.”
So I held on. Grimly, painfully, as the burn continued and increased, my fingers gripping my wand tight under my robes, ready to break out of the mental link that was forcibly created between us and hex him. But I was petrified, my muscles frozen, as I was bound by the power of his Legilimens.
The room spun. A cool sensation met the burning in his shoulder, followed by the scald of antiseptic.
I let out my breath. It was safe.
His hand ran through my hair; my scalp tingled from his touch. His nose almost touched mine; it was only a breath away. There was a lash that flicked off as he blinked and wetted his lip.
Red droplets hung midair, frozen, as I spoke a word.
“Well, considering your other one is dead – and Heavens help us if she’s sending you flowers from beyond the grave – yes, it is Andromeda. She wants to invite you for tea sometime with her grandson, Teddy.”
“My, my. Aren’t we touchy? How about a deal? If you help us, we won’t kill Mr. Potter other there. I know you have a special place in your heart for him.”
“Right. Where are you planning to go?”
No, it was something else.
“Don’t jump into your Auror mode right away, Potter. Let me finish what I have to say first.”
“I’m well, Harry,” my mother’s voice cut off my father’s tirade. “When are you coming over for tea?”
“They eat humans.” Potter’s amused glance was warm against my skin. There was a small puff of air visible; the autumn air had a bite to it. He rubbed his arms. The idiot’s robes were too thin. The elves had taken our cloaks when we arrived, and we hadn’t brought them along with us.
“Hello Draco.” Granger came up to me, a martini glass clutched in one hand. “Did you just get here?”
“It used to not be like this. Back in the day, my parents would give grand balls and other social functions, and it would be lit with a thousand candles and torches and Lumoses. Everyone would be here in their best robes and dresses and my parents would be at the center, my father in full evening dress, tails and all, and Mother would be in a full-length gown. I used to watch up there,” I pointed up, “and think that I would down there one day too.” I gave Potter a flicker of a smile. “Most of the guests are probably in prison now.”
McLaggen narrowed his eyes. “I want a full report of the incident in the morning.”
Dawlish shrugged. “Read it once for school. Don’t remember much of it. Why?”
Shacklebolt addressed Draco. “I don’t know how exposed you feel, but it might be best to move out of Malfoy Manor for the time being. It’s too conspicuous and too tempting a target, even with all your state-of-the-art security. And it’ll be easier to reach you if you were close to HQ in London.”
“Hello, Draco.” Luna Lovegood settled down beside me. “It’s a great party. Thanks for inviting me. I don’t usually get invited to these types of things, you know.”
“Maybe we should take him back with us,” the shorter man suggested. “After all, we didn’t find anything. Maybe young Malfoy here would know where it is.”
“What?” Draco’s head shot up. “What do you mean?”
“What is the order?” Riddle asked.
For some reason, Harry broke out a wide grin. If it weren’t for his strict self-discipline and the fact that they ran for their very lives, Draco might have thought Harry would have broken out in a little jig.
The book finally finished. I waved my wand: a sheet of parchment appeared with the names copied onto it. I handed it to Potter, careful to avoid touching his hand. He took it, in a manner that told me he was only delaying the conversation.
“That was an accident!” Harry punched me lightly. “Besides, how many times did I beat you again? Shall we count it? Who was the one that dressed up as a Dementor to scare me because he couldn’t beat me?”
My father remained quiet for the rest of the dinner, though his eyes alternated balefully between me and Potter. The quiet flow of dialogue between my mother and Potter, however, kept him quiescent. I was on my fourth or fifth glass of wine, the house-elves having brought out our household reserves as Potter’s duck wine was long emptied. When we retired to the drawing room for refreshments, I followed everyone with a light head.
Harry didn’t press. Harry had always been good about that, Draco recalled, always having the presence of mind to offer discreet comfort without appearing intrusive or overbearing like so many others.
Dry-throated, Draco nodded.
No. Draco would not allow himself to be sucked into that vortex of nostalgia. He would stay here, doing what he was asked to do with professional detachment, and leave when the work was finished.
“It’s just Harry, Goyle. I don’t want to catch any unwanted attention from the others while we’re down here.”
Harry did so. Het met Draco’s eyes. “Whatever’s in the future, promise me that we’ll face it together.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “And you need not ever see us again. Unless you want to.”
“No, it’s fine. This was just a whim.” And I was reluctant for Potter to change into pants that covered up more of his arse. It really was delectable.
“We will?” Dolohov seemed stunned at this turn of events.
“Come here,” he said. He wrapped his arm around my shoulders, pulling me in tightly. “You’re too wound up in the past. As always, his body pulsed in steady heat under his clothes, and I instinctively drew in closer.
“I’m with you, Draco.” He came and embraced me. “Whatever happens, I won’t let anything happen to you. Everything will turn out alright.”
“Unfortunately, people still believe in Slytherin’s ideas of pureblood supremacy.” Potter pointed out.
My legs were jelly and I hardly thought I would be able to claw my way up the stairs, but that was irrelevant. All I wanted was to be left alone, Potter’s comforting presence notwithstanding. I could barely take in enough air to let out the scream that bubbled inside me. All that kept it at by was a resolve to not break down in front of Potter.
“But he might not be willing to aid us,” the librarian protested. “He’s turned his back on the True Cause. I don’t think he’s willing to help us achieve our goals and the goals of his great ancestor and our Founder.”
“What do we do now?” Harry asked. Unlike last time when they flew here, Harry had with him a glass of wine. It was empty.
Potter looked at me with a glimmer of amusement. “When I go out, hit him from my left.” He spoke in quick, rapid bursts. “Don’t bother with any direct jinx or hexes; his Shield’s too good. Instead, use the surroundings against him. Charm or Transfigure the objects around him.”
Harry looked at Finnegan. “Do you think I should give this up?”
I choked on my coffee. “You do surprise me, Potter. First a swinger’s club and now this? Didn’t take you to be such a hedonist.”
She complied, then responded: they received the message, but they did not acknowledge.
I shook my head. “It’s a mixed residential property. There’s a wizarding building management that I pay rent to.”
Draco was about to respond with a negative when his emotional walls broke. It had been battened since the moment he had saw the Dolohov and – what was that man’s name? Something about a worm – in his father’s study, and even more when he saw Harry again. But now the screws were coming loose and Draco didn’t know if he would be able to stem the wave of emotion threatening to overwhelm him.
“My agent told me my books have been selling out,” I said. “Seems to have helped rather than hurt.”
They rounded a curve in the tunnel. Ducking out of sight and listening, they watched two guards pacing the entrance of a room.
“You two are infatuated with each other,” Cross said, shaking his head. “But I know you, Draco. You’re not like him. You’ll never be like him. You need to stop trying. Join me. It’s in your heritage. It’s in your blood.”
“Maybe his memory will offer a clue,” Harry suggested.
“Yes, it was a kiss, Malfoy, and I wanted to talk to you about it.”
“There has to be more,” I said to Harry. “This can’t be a dead end. I know it. I can feel it in my bones that there’s more to this place than just this --” I waved my hand around the chamber.
“At least we did good work here, didn’t we?” Draco added, trying to bring Harry out of this unexplainable gloom. He was sorry for snapping at Harry earlier. Harry didn’t use to be like this – or he did, but it was less pronounced and easier to deal with. It was up to Draco to jostle Harry back into his regular self. “I wonder if they’ll let me help with the repatriation of those artifacts.”
“So more luck on my end, then.” I grinned at Potter. “See? And you wanted me to stay put.” And despite the dangers of touching the book-key that I had just enumerated, an urge to open it again almost overcame me. Not because I was a masochist, but because no matter how warped or dangerous it was, I was experiencing a memory of Slytherin’s firsthand. What other historian could claim the same?
It was a chimera of a dream. Like this beautiful day, with the sun gloriously out in the cloudless blue, it seemed unreal.
How did you do it that fast? Harry asked in awe.
Harry’s firm grip caught my wrist. “Good thing I remember the first aid course from the Auror training,” he murmured as he bent down to meet my lips.
Draco restrained the urge to pound the desk with his fists. It had been two hours and he had found nothing. His father’s papers were a mess, uncollated and jumbled, with nothing that provided any insight for why anyone would want them. Most of them were diatribes or screeds against various figures in government, with Lucius railing against the direction of the country. There were one or two anecdotes which might be of interest to the odd historian, but nothing which would inspire a burglary.
“You’re not going to find anything tying me to this place in those files of yours,” Malfoy said. “I know how to cover my tracks.”
“Can I ask you something, too?” I took another drink. “Why did you divorce Ginny Weasley?”
“Booze and sex, the usual.” Blaise smirked at Harry. “All the goodies you can’t get Above.”
Draco attempted to push himself up. The effort nearly tore his shoulder off.
“Regardless of what shape it took, and I think I can guess that the key took the shape of a book to fit into Draco’s bag and so it wouldn’t look out of place at the Gringotts’s Reading Room, it’s the map to finding Slytherin’s Grimoire before the Circle does. You said that Ted Cross is a member?”
Harry primed the propulsion – he flew straight into the honking mass of humanity, swerving to avoid a lorry carrying aether tanks and industrial maintenance drones. Angry blares blasted Harry from all sides – he maneuver the Firebolt sixty degrees to his left, out of an incoming red Moris Major cloud car.
“I think we should leave you here to think, Mr. Malfoy,” Dolohov said. “Talk to Mr. Potter here. See how lenient our master is being with you. Don’t think of trying to escape, though. This entire place is monitored, and we have men stationed at every exit. You’re our guest, but don’t presume too much on our hospitality.”
“Wait. There is one.”
The lack of communication hurt more than the leaving. Draco might be able to handle Harry’s anger, or his rejection, if only it were ameliorated by an explanation. But none seemed would ever be forthcoming.
Draco clenched his fists. How many times did he have to tell housekeeping that his father’s study was off-limits? He didn’t want anything touched.
“I’ll have to,” Potter said. “I know you said you cleaned up the damage, but there still might be clues. And I’ll have to assess the vulnerability of your residence, especially since I’m assuming whoever attacked you and broke in was powerful magically.”
“I’m doing it much more delicately. Trust me; I have a degree in archaeology.”
“They probably didn’t think they needed to be discreet Underground.”
It must have been a dream. In the light of day, all the fancies of nighttime dissipated. Must be the alcohol that caused it. I sighed. “I don’t have much food at home,” I said. “I meant to buy groceries yesterday.” I didn’t add that I got distracted by the visions from a magical book of another magical book.
“I sincerely doubt that,” Draco muttered. “I think you’re laboring under a delusion that we were close enough for him to confide in me. If you’ve done your homework, you would know that we spent more of our time arguing than intriguing together.” Forcing himself to state the truth so baldly stung. Draco didn’t relish the dynamic he and his father shared. He had longed for the day when his father would turn a smile at him, when the love wasn’t conditioned on Draco meeting his father’s expectations.
Harry laughed. “That’s true. I think once you’ve been to a warzone, you definitely learn to appreciate what you never did before.”
Finnegan was right. That was what they should have done. Yet Harry’s instinct stayed him from taking the easy path. It was bothering him, like an itch on his back that his hands were too short to reach, a premonition that there was more to the case than the surface facts.
Oh. It was my turn to flush. “It’s fine,” I said, affecting a nonchalance that clashed with a skip of my pulse. “It’s easier than me bringing them out for you to look.”
Now that Harry mentioned it, Draco did too.
And sometimes, our old certainties about the past are wrong, I thought, looking at Harry. He hummed some nonsensical ditty to himself as he leaned back on his forearms. And we find out about it in unexpected ways.
“So, Harry, tell us about some of your plans,” the youngest Weasley, Ginny, asked. She and Ron rivaled each other in displaying the most dislike for Draco. Draco knew she had a crush on Harry, had even dated him briefly before Harry enlisted. It wasn’t Draco’s fault that she had been jilted. Blame the military. Hell, blame Tony Blair. “What do you plan to do now that you’re back? You should stay longer. We all miss you.”
Draco tensed. “I’m having a really bad day,” he said, “and I really don’t take kindly to being kept in the dark.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I know you must miss them, and I’m making you talk about this.”
Stop that, he told himself sternly. There was always a chance of danger; Draco used to be inured to that when he and Harry began sleeping together while he was an active Royal Marine. But somehow, in these intervening years, Draco had lost that helpful perspective. Now he was twitching worse than a junkie denied his fix.
Harry grinned at Shacklebolt. “When have I ever done that?”
“Nothing,” I said. “I never heard of any group that cared about Slytherin’s Grimoire until I ran into Luna today and she told me about it. Apparently there’s an article on them in the Quibbler that I haven’t even read it.”
“Perhaps you should come and give a guest lecture to some of our advanced students,” McGonagall said thoughtfully. “I kept up with your career in general terms, and it’s impressive. Perhaps some of the OWLs or above Defense students would appreciate your historical insights into the Dark Arts.”
Blaise heaved a dramatic sigh. “Fine.”
“What about?” There was an edge in his tone beyond his usual sharpness; I sensed tension in my father that I had never felt before.
Even the interior was plain: bare walls, no furniture, empty all around. From the outside, the building had looked at least partially inhabited. Now, I could tell that was an illusion designed to protect the house.
This chapter was over. Finally over. Draco collapsed against the pleather seat of the Land Rover. It was surprisingly comfortable. Either that, or the contrast from the rock wall of his former prison too deeply impressed upon him.
The Firebolt righted.
Evidently, their last trip was not recent. I ran a finger on the table. Dust stained my fingertip. Scowling, I casted a quick Cleaning Charm.
“I’m sorry,” Harry repeated. “What I just aid earlier, I just panicked for a moment. I don’t doubt your competence or your good intention.”
“What do you mean, ‘look for the cave’? It’s clearly marked out on the map,” Harry grumbled. “It’s not even difficult to get to.”
It was an unsatisfying and nerve-wracking experience, though Harry was familiar with more than most that the Law Enforcement Agency rarely spent its time masquerading as bait to entrap men indulging their vice. They were simply too stretched for resources. And the Aurors most definitely did not, seeing this sort of work as beneath them. Though monitoring these sorts of behavior and accumulating information on them was a different matter – once or twice, Harry had read in the files of high-ranking officials or captains of industry notes which marked out embarrassing or devastating facts on their personal life.
Almost instinctively, I cut open a small slice on the tip of my finger. I watched as blood welled up. I looked at it dispassionately as I let it drop on the book-key, careful not to touch the cover.
I tried distracting myself by taking in my surroundings. The stair creaked under our weight, and I noticed that the wood of it were pitted and scored. The walls were lined with peeling paper whose decorative patterns had long faded with the passage of time. It was too dark to make out much; gas lamps instead of candles provided the light. They flickered, threatening to sputter out, as Potter took me up.
The man abruptly took a step back.
“I got you,” he murmured, his voice a comfortable buzz in my ears as he helped me to the sofa.
“I told you,” Hermione said, almost triumphantly. “I already tried.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “Of course. That’s what the reason is.”
“True,” Hedwig acknowledged without irony. “I shouldn’t expect so much from humans.”
There was a wobble in the chair. Potter drew back. I shot him a look of annoyance, my lips chewed and chapped.
Goyle turned with the too-precise movement of one drunk. “We just got here,” he slurred. “What’s the hurry?”
“They are all either properties of the Malfoy family or on retainer to them. Analysis: the Malfoy family holds the patents for these security measures that is the subject of Commander Potter’s inquiry.”
What did they want? They obviously were no ordinary burglars. For one, even in its current condition, the Manor had a state-of-the-art security system. No alarms had been triggered, no one had noticed the break-in. If it hadn’t been for Draco’s serendipitous detour, the two men would have come and gone without anyone catching them.
I groped for my thermos of coffee, hoping a shot of liquid energy would wake me from this daydream. As I reached, my hand brushed the outermost edge of the book.
Draco stopped suddenly. This wasn’t a therapy session, no matter if Rosa was certified. And his natural reserve held him back from saying more.
“No. But from what we understand about the Mors Mordre, England does appear to be their base of operations. It makes sense for both of you to return to assist our efforts.”
“If you want.” Harry picked up his menu, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
But this could be used to my advantage. The mental bridge between us went both ways. He was too busy attempting to breach my mind; as a result, his own was unprotected.
Draco smiled modestly. “I do enough of these inquiries in my day job. I don’t think it needs to carry over into my personal life.”
Getting old, Draco thought ruefully. The last few years in particular, they seemed to have aged him.
“What, trying to be swift-footed Achilles too?”
“Only on a part time, consulting basis,” she said. “I understand you have many other commitments on your time, but we could use your talent.”
“I’m not surprised, with all these Slytherin links,” he tried to joke finally. “It’s must be like a House reunion for you.”
“Are you sure?” Riddle appraised Draco thoughtfully.
I knocked on his door with not a little amount of trepidation.
I squinted at him. “Have we met?”
“We can trade, and you brief McLaggen about the case while I fill out the forms,” Harry offered.
Despite the ominous reaction of the librarian and my response when I touched the book, I was excited. Here was a puzzle, a mystery waiting to be solved. It was a challenge; my blood rose at the thought of it. Perhaps it would be nothing more earthshaking than a journal of cookie recipes with a paranoid owner, but still – my eyes gleamed at making even the smallest discovery.
“I don’t understand,” Malfoy said. “What’s the difference between your little group and that group of Death Eaters?”
“And Harry here works for a … trust that is interested in these sorts of things. His organization is the one that sponsored us,” Draco added, thinking quickly. He wasn’t sure how discreet Theo would be, given that his entire business depended on reputation, and reputation by nature was built by flaunting one’s achievements. “We would like to keep this discovery secret, mind. At least until we can ascertain if it is truly a prototype.”
“Heavens forbid.” Potter’s laugh blew small puffs into my face.
One hand cupped my face as he leaned in. It grew more heated as I returned the kiss, becoming lost in the sensations. His thumb drew small lines on my cheek and his teeth nipped at my lip as the other grabbed my hip.
Fudge had always affected an avuncular warmth for Harry in the few times Harry had accepted the invitations to the formal functions the Ministry threw to ‘honor its heroes.’
My father looked to say something scathing to that, but my mother cut in.
With a supreme act of patience, Harry managed to stop himself from strangling the man. He wasn’t exempt from prosecution for murder, however justifiable it might be. “I already gave my report to Shacklebolt. You do know that just because you rank immediately above me doesn’t mean I report to you, don’t you?” As an afterthought, Harry added: “Sir.”
“Do you understand?” Harry tightened his hold.
“What Ron means to say is, is that we have nothing to do with this wand,” Hermione said, “and even less with an attack on Harry. Are you alright?” she added, giving Harry a look of concern.
“Where are you taking me?” Instinct told me there was no fighting Potter when he was in hero mode. I was not wholly opposed to it either. “I can take care of myself, you know.”
Cross waved that aside, as though Voldemort’s death was a minor irritation. “I don’t think he was suited to have the book anyways. No respect for the wisdom of his elders. Of course, that came with his prodigious magical talents, and I have to respect that. But his rage and instability made him clearly unfit to lead. You, on the other hand –”
I took a deep breath. And yet … the historian in me itched to ask Potter for more details. If I could face my past, I could write a history of the War. It was my past, the messy bits of it with the foolish vainglorious thirst for attention, the delusion of blood purity that all Malfoys had been indoctrinated in –
Harry shook his head. “I need to take Draco to the Healers. He took a nasty looking spell to the chest earlier. I assume you can handle it here.”
So he sat, in sullen silence, eating an undeniably excellent shepherd’s pie while the others either ignored or gave him dirty scowls. The only attempt that Harry had made to bring Draco into the conversation lapsed into stony silence that Granger, of all people, had to break up by changing the topic to some Serbian leader being charged with war crimes.
“You’re sure you are leaving the school, master?” A man in rough, monkish robes was addressing another in a tone of deference. “I don’t know if we can carry on without you.”
I gritted my teeth. Now I would never live this down.
“What? That Mrs. Muffe’s silver were pinched? Are you branching out into detective work now?”
Goyle returned the wink. “It is.” He looked at Millicent. “Your place or mine?”
“You’re incredibly quick in accepting a story that most would regard as farfetched,” I said after a heartbeat.
Lost manuscript? Why would he say that? It was an odd choice of words … I stared at him. Did he mean misplaced?
There was a loud clatter. They had knocked over the heavy book that Harry had been using as a paperweight for his stacks of paper. That broke the spell.
“Do you have any spare clothes? I smell and I need a shower.”
He didn’t have to wait long: the two rushed at Draco. Draco countered with a jab to Wormtail that had him staying down. Dolohov was quicker – he avoided Draco’s hook by jumping back with a dexterity not previously displayed.
“No,” he said, “I don’t think I do too badly.” His hands roamed as he pulled me against his chest. I breathed in his smell, that very distinctive Harry scent, as he trailed a line of kisses up my neck.
I stared at her, gratified and a little taken aback. “Well. Okay. Yes. That’s what I wanted to report.”
“A few hundred? A thousand at the most,” Harry said, recalling the last estimate that had been given at the briefing about the Underground a month ago.
It was corroborated inadvertently by Shacklebolt informing Harry that Dolohov and a woman named Bellatrix Lestrange, a notorious lieutenant of Riddle, had been spotted by agents in Greece.
Harry disregarded the jibe. “Tell me.”
“There’s nothing here,” Harry said with confusion. “It’s a blank file.”
Harry’s sight changed. It now took the perspective of a single, anonymous traffic cam, on in thousands, in Covent Garden. It showed a single hovercar, old and dilapidated, one among many. The car sped along in the air, following the breakneck pace set by the traffic grid.
“Riddle?” Weasley asked. “You mean the one?”
“I’m impressed you found your way here,” Dolohov said. He leaned insouciantly at the entrance, his gun pointed directly at Draco. “Now be a good boy and put that back down.”
My Shield managed to redirect the force of his curse onto the wooden table. It cracked as papers and books were sent in the air. They came down slowly, in a stream of confetti.
“Just a short bit,” Harry said. “It’s a nice walk though, even with the cold.” His hand bumped Draco’s, and in the passing of the car lights, Draco saw him smile.
Shacklebolt shook his head. “You need to be discreet. Not only does he have the ear of the Minister, but many of our systems depend on his codes to work. Don’t do anything stupid.”
They were seated with remarkable courtesy, considering that they had only arrived and cut off the dozen or so people who had arrived before them.
“Harry!” The holos faded and Shacklebolt turned his attention to his young officer. “I understand you had a busy night.”
“Why don’t you shut up and just enjoy this?” Harry allowed himself to turned over by Malfoy again, allowed Malfoy to mouth the crook of his neck, arching to enjoy more of the contact.
Finnegan raised his hand. There was a flash of light from his cuff as his wristlink took a picture of the deceased. It spoke in a tinny voice: “Image identified as Hopkirk, Department of Transportation, Grade 5A.”
“Merlin! Don’t do that!” I gave him a dirty look.
“You two are possibly the worst agents I have ever encountered,” Dawlish told them. “Breaking into one of the most prestigious buildings in London in the middle of the night and getting the police to arrest you? What part of secret do you not understand?”
Dolohov and Greyback left the cave, leaving a seething Draco and silent Harry.
Then I Disapparated.
“West Africa,” she said. “Darling Rolf and I were trying to track down the numbers of the Ninki Nanka. There had been a number of sightings in the area, but no confirmed reports.”
“We have to go back,” I croaked. My voice was hoarse. My throat was sore, and I desperately yearned for water. “My parents are still in there.”
It had not been fraught with embarrassment nor with shame. They had greeted each other with cheerful smiles. Well, Harry had; Draco never enjoyed mornings. They had dressed in companionable silence, and had walked down to breakfast together, encountering knowing amusement from Granger and a rather resigned acceptance from Weasley.
A loud blast erupted and the air itself choked all the air out of my lungs. The Manor was on fire – my home was burning –
I popped back into the inn. I hadn’t really needed to use the restroom, had only employed it as a convenient excuse so I had space to think. I would give Harry ten minutes of privacy with his parents while I bought a cup of coffee from the inn’s café before rejoining him.
His SI, or Sentient Intelligence, virtual assistant responded with a thought that had a tinny cast, her way of expressing disapproval. My analysis is based on the ease of traffic, she said, the shortest way out to the ports, and the likelihood that a vehicle with the characteristics of what was provided to us would have in standing out.
Malfoy’s eyes met Harry’s behind Fudge’s back. They were bright, dancing with entertainment at the spectacle of it all. There was no trace of that earlier shadow when Finnegan had mentioned Pettigrew and Dolohov’s names.
It came loose. Harry removed it to reveal a hole large enough for a man.
“That is correct,” came the console’s reply.
Harry’s arm reached out and wrapped around him.
“Why are you going through my father’s old papers?”
“You might think that. I couldn’t possibly comment.” Then I had to ask: “How do you know so much? You and your magazine.”
It was too far for Draco to see the man in the chopper clearly, but Draco had the impression the man too wore an expression of victory.
Sorry? Was that one word all Harry was going to say? It didn’t even begin to cover the abandonment and confusion that Harry had left behind. And it didn’t answer any questions either.
“How’s your friends?” Draco asked, trying hard to not roll his eyes. He could feel his lips dancing, however. “Granger and the Weasel – Weasley – and all of your Gryffindor lackies?”
Draco took a deep breath, pushing the awareness of the others to the back of his mind. Pure interest in the artifacts took over his mind; there were little symbols on the diameter of the Decoder that Draco took to be esoteric astronomical references.
We went down to the basement. So this is where all the action is, I thought. Before me was a dazzling array of magical artifacts, the power their auras gave off visible even to the naked eye. I recognized some of the objects as the ones being missing from sets supposedly already completed, and others stolen from magical museums all over Europe.
“I still can’t believe you brought him here,” my father sniffed. “Just because you two are collaborating on a project doesn’t mean you need to be attached at the hips.”
Potter stiffened. He was about to say something, but I caught his eye. I shook my head.
He made his way down to the bar where Goyle was, his head still musing over the possibilities of what he learned.
Draco blinked at Harry with sleepy eyes. “Then what is it? What’s the matter? Is this something that can’t wait?”
“Wait, I came up here to tell Malfoy something too,” Granger said. She eyed me and Harry. My shirt was unevenly buttoned and he was still shirtless. “Although I guess I can always come back later.”
“It’s my father,” she said, with a loud stammer. “He was on a ladder trying to fix a broken tile, and he fell. I’m so frightened – he’s barely conscious and I can’t lift him, not by myself.”
“Are you alright?” he asked, out of breath. We were tangled in a heap of limbs and robes. “What happened?”
“You two are going to get on that water sled and go,” Theo told Bellatrix and Dolohov. Harry made a strangled protest that ended when Theo glared at Harry. “I don’t know what this is about, and I don’t want to know. But you’re wrecking my ship and hurting my friends. Consider this a very generous offer.”
Harry moved off of me as I stood from the bed.
She tossed her hair as she exited the privacy bubble. “Please don’t. Don’t make me slap you again.”
Draco sat bound, his back against sharp rock. Harry was trussed in the same way opposite him.
“Excuse me.” Draco stood abruptly. “I think I’m going to go outside for some air. Thank you for dinner,” he said courteously to Mrs. Weasley, who seemed taken aback by Draco’s unexpected burst of politeness.
“Dear Professor McGonagall …”
“Why do you have one of Blaise’s ties lying around?” Potter asked.
“Lumes off,” Harry said. “And set my alarms. I think tomorrow will be a long day.”
“I’m not just a pretty face,” Malfoy said. “Metis, what is your analysis?”
Fletcher stood up. “I think I might just have what you’re looking for, Mr. Malfoy. Why don’t we wrap up dinner and go to my office? It’ll be much more private there.”
Bellatrix sneered. “You have got to be joking, boy.” Her mocking tone was gone, replaced by anger that Draco would dare lecture her on anything. “You really think you can do anything? You?” She raised, ready to fire –
“Then there’s one place they’d go to. It’s practically a tourist attraction, if men sneaking down here for illicit fun can be considered tourists.”
“It’s my house too, Lucius,” my mother said in an irritable voice. “In fact, I believe it’s still in my name, being part of my marriage settlement.”
Harry blanched. That was a quarter of a year’s supply in London for the drug.
“I’ll go,” Harry volunteered.
Then I came, the milky seed spilling into my bathwater, and I fell back against the rim of the bathtub, my tension loosened and my headache much relieved.
Draco unloaded and checked it for bullets, then re-cocked it with an expert flick. Everyone stared.
Potter shuddered again. And again, that surge of protectiveness, the urge to hug him. “I did,” he said. “Worst choice of my academic career. I won’t call Trelawney an old fraud, but she’s close.”
“Because that is what he is – their master. He’s the top man at Mors Mordre, the one responsible for all the atrocities the group has carried out. He’s ruthless in the pursuit of his goals, executing anyone who fails him.”
I know I shouldn’t, but I can’t help writing to you. You might as well know that not only I survived, but I’m very much hearty and hale. There’s no point in trying to trace this; I’ve already taken all the appropriate precautions.
“Do we have any idea what this spell is?” Harry looked at the sight with professional interest, though not daring to approach it. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen this before. It reminds me of Fiendfyre.”
“I will,” Harry promised. “I will be as discreet and professional as I could possibly be.”
Draco wanted to wring his hands in frustration. The longer this dragged, the more anxious Draco became. It was the wait, not the actual danger, that drained Draco’s spirit.
"We should be with one another."
"Potter, why do you keep a piece of wire in your pocket. Don't tell me you've traded your wand in progress."
"Shut up and kiss me."
"Too many caramel cobwebs."
"-Then I'll have to go."
"We're bloody fucked," Harry gasped as he pushed himself back on his feet – his back bumping against the walls.
"I just wish we could talk it out," Harry whispered as he dropped down on one of the beds they pushed together ages ago. He pulled over the sheets, covering his shoulders as he inhaled the smells - dreaming of picking up the scent of his blonde.
"Get out of my way," another voice snarled, apparently being Professor Snape's. Hermione pressed her hand against her mouth, trying to keep her breath in, and stepped aside – letting Snape in without another word. Harry was screwed, whatever he'd done. Draco lifted his chin full of triumph, and bared his teeth with joy.
"What happened to you?"
It left him breathless.
A shiver ran down from both their heads to their spine. Hermione turned, her cheeks fluttering red – her eyes set to kill. Miming something, Ron turned his head – biting his lower lip as he dropped his quill, not willing to continue his leftover homework. Hermione hid her head behind her curls, her head glowing by hatred and shame – flipping through her homework with her famous stubborn attitude.
"I've been working out," Draco replied with a smug smile, fetching something from the deep of his pocket.
The white silhouette known as Draco, took his position beside him now – tugging the shower curtains for a close, capturing them like a cocoon. And Harry stopped breathing. His eyesight became a little more clear at last – and at ones he could see the clear features of Draco Malfoy – revealing his naked body like a clear canvas.
Harry respond swiftly, having his wand drawn before Goyle could finish his spell, and cast it backwards by chance. It wasn't occasional to rebound a spell, but to Harry's surprise it did.
"What about that kiss?" Harry asked nonetheless. "Don't tell me it was nothing."
"You look so good," he moaned – peaking between their bodies, staring down at his solid cock – still hiding in its boxers. Draco flinched, grabbing one of Harry's wrists to squeeze it – holding his own pants up with the other.
"Aren't you happy for them?" Neville asked – raising hi brows."
No matter the riddles of which the blonde spoke, Harry felt rather good at last. No matter his lingering headache. After he got dressed himself, he took is time to find the showers to freshen up. Cum stained against his body-hair, and no matter the effort it took to get it off, he couldn't help but smirking along the way. The experience was strange and nerve wracking, but all the same he wanted more. He was in love, if not just with his body.
"They broke up," Luna muttered under her breath, holding Neville's hand; hiding it under the table. Longbottom didn't say much. His cheeks were bright red, and all he could was looking at his golden girl.
"We've searched everywhere! It was Dumbledore easing our minds. Malfoy has been missing too, his father is going to kill him!"
"Blimey Harry," a voice interrupted from behind. Ron stood there, Hermione at his side holding his arm tight. Hagrid tried his best to wiggle his body inside, but couldn't come any further but sticking his head between the entrance.
Harry could barely speak. His mouth was dry and his body weak. As if he hadn't been using his muscles for days.
He clenched his teeth, annoyed by the way he allowed him to escape again. Doubt caused his stomach to turn, and now there was nothing left to run to, he wondered whether his friends were right. Maybe he was just going plain mad.
Who knew what Harry was up to?
"You would've surely forgotten about me, if I didn't rescue your drunk ass tonight. What have you been drinking?"
His lips groped down to Malfoy's neck – and at last, he gave in. Draco took his turn now. He twisted his fingers around Harry's blouse – eagerly pulling it off his body as if he disarmed him from a bomb, buttons clattering to the ground like shattered glass. Growling at each other's touch, they moved through the room – one of Draco's hands scanning as they kissed, hoping to find something to lean on. He wanted more, for now he was King, and there was no turning back. "What are we doing?" Malfoy muttered once pushing Harry down onto an old desk. Harry grabbed Draco's collar – looking at him, confused, possessed, careless. "I have no idea." Draco shook his head in return, knowing just as much as he did, and looked at him before kissing him again. It made his heart die, thinking how he would displease his father by these actions; and yet, even though Draco had severe daddy issues, he bit down the boy's lower lip in vain – for all didn't matter anymore. Harry's heart skipped a beat, amazed by the discovery of pleasance, and pulled Draco closer by the very edge of his trousers. Though sexual arousing barely crossed his mind, this seemed to come close. His belly filling with a pleasant kind of sickness resulted him to take over the situation. Pulling the blonde close, his glasses fogging, he buried his face in his neck.
Harry was done for that day. No longer could he comprehend the events of today. He seemed to be floating – as if he were in a dream – and he didn't like it one bit. Nothing made sense. Nothing seemed to have a logic explanation. Nothing seemed to work in his advance. He felt silly for looking for Draco. He felt bad for being fooled again. For being made fun of in front of everyone. Maybe he just had to let go. Let go of everything he'd been struggling with.
Harry opened his eyes again, turning in anger, biting his lip as he pushed the blonde's hands away.
'What are you doing?' Harry panted then - nearly groaning as Draco suddenly reached a remarkably sensitive spot in his neck.
"Your fire is ever so burning for me," Draco mocked him, pointing out at the still active Lumos spell. Harry shook his head, tapping his wand against his knee – if it would extinguish any quicker. "Nox," Harry muttered in a hurry – tying his cardigan around his waist.
Draco chuckled under his breath, looking down at the boy as if he was ridiculing him all along. "Never mind." He walked around the office, grabbing bits of this and that - coming back with a bottle labeled as alcohol.
Funny, how Harry decided to keep his mouth shut once he managed to find his way back to his original destination. Without giving a proper clarification about his messy looks, he simply walked along with his confidential musketeers, buying the stuff they needed for the next week. School was about to start again, and how coincidental for him to meet the one person he'd been trying to avoid for months on his very first day of fixing his school supplies. As if they were meant to meet. Harry couldn't get him out of his head. How forceful and confident Malfoy had been. Something new. Something invigorating. There was something about this boy, something different – and he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Thinking about their encounter, months ago, his lips started to burn – a familiar smell raising some sort of excitement to keep his breath off edge, his heartbeat speeding at the thought of it.
"Harry," Ron cried as he choked in one of his homemade sandwiches – he was on a budget. "You are bleeding!"
'Don't you like it?' He sounded disappointed. Drunk little shit he was.
The following minutes seemed to last longer than forever. Had Harry been right? Or had he been oh so wrong? Harry rubbed his hands through his untidy hair as his eyes troubled with tears. He pulled his roots, biting his lip as he couldn't find the strength to look them in the eye. "I'm not sure I can handle this," Harry whispered as professor Dumbledore's words vividly echoed through his head.
"I've missed you too."
"You getting wet?" Draco teased as he sucked on his skin, leaving a hickey at a perfect spot. His fingers drew along his neck down his collar, unbuttoning another two of his shirt.
"Let me give you head." His eyes stood serious, but optimistic, and for a second he looked down. Before Harry could even ask what it was, giving some one head, Draco took a breathe to clear him out. "It's a blowjob, to comfort you," he continued.
Goyle toppled over, his face white but his cheeks fluttered by shame and anger. His blood was boiling up to his long-boiled face, ashamed by his missing. Ashamed by his own weak attempt.
"No," Dumbledore replied in all honesty. "But you have been very aware of that."
"I'm thinking about breaking up with her."
The brown nodded, shoving his arm under his head. "My head hurts though."
"Is what true, Neville?" Harry raised his brows curiously, pretending to search through the pages of the book he pretended to read. Neville seemed to be out of breath, and steadied himself against Harry's desk, shaking his head as he put his "plant-thing" down.
"Harry," Dumbledore spoke again. "We have to tell you something."
Draco looked up, frowning as he lowered his wand. He seemed offended. "No." Dropping his wand he kicked it to the side – vanishing beneath another's bed. "Now you prove it, that you're not up to no-good."
"I didn't want to raise any suspicion."
"Have a walk with me?"
"I don't care about what you think, Malfoy! He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic!"
"I thought you left?" Harry snorted, trying to keep his sweaty fists from shaking. "What a horrible night to be refused for a dance." He seemed pissed. The slender boy didn't reply or move. Standing in front of a wall torch, the only movements were the shadows on the walls – making him rather sad now shadows fell down on his mask. Harry pursed his lips, lifting his chin as he waited for a voice.
"This has something to do with Draco's leaving, hasn't it?"
"Harry," Hermione whispered as she slowly shook her head. "You silly goose."
"I would like to show you something."
"Are you alright, Harry?" Luna asked after a long silence. Harry gave her a look, smiling faintly. "You look rather pale. Has it anything to do with Ron and Hermione?"
"What did you think of?"
After Harry took a couple of hours of self-therapy (which meant crying on his own in his dorms while skipping class) he gathered the guts to have a talk with the headmaster. He had a couple of questions containing one crucial. What happened to Draco Malfoy? After half an hour roaming he decided to have a belated tea party with his pity self. When professor Dumbledore wasn't in his office he could be absolutely everywhere. That man could walk through walls - and not just because he was a powerful wizard. Harry fumbled the corners of the Quibbler he'd been trying to read for the last fifteen minutes. Luna had been encouraging him to read the article about Wrackspurts and even offered him a free copy. He couldn't decline. Luna was a generous and good person. Totally suited her name.
"I want you to think," Draco replied – his eyes fixated on his. The piano took a pause every time he spoke, and a breeze of cold air caused Harry's back to shiver. "Think about?"
Malfoy thought it would be pretty fair if he could undo Harry from his shirt as well now, and so did – not caring about the tie remaining on his neck. After all, he still wore his tie as well. They couldn't easily rip that one off from their necks. It would suffocate them.
"The shower is still on," Draco replied in a whisper. "I thought, why not join you."
He got interrupted by Ron nodding heavily as he smirked, and he frowned briefly as he eventually finished with '-nally.'
The boy took back his hand - his black cloak draping down his shoulders – and turned his back on him, leaving with a slow but steady pace. Harry shivered once his scent gnawed through him, familiar and rich. Dark but warm, like the scent of a forest during a snowy winters day. "Don't you walk away from me," Harry demanded – grabbing his cloak to keep him still.
"-Says who?"
'Huh?'
Draco narrowed his eyes and grabbed Harry by his neck - scanning him closely, as if he was checking whether he stole some of his cookies and he could find the evidence in the corners of his mouth. "Now, what are you doing here? Think you can spy on me and my father? I think not."
Harry grabbed his sleeves, taking a hold of the blonde - not allowing him to leave. "Don't go, please."
"I need to..." Harry cried as he swung his arms against Madam Pomfrey's side to push her away. "Let me go through!"
"Blimey Harry," Ron sighed as he crouched aside him. He couldn't suppress his laughter. "What were you thinking?"
Draco curled the corner of his mouth, twisting the ring on his index finger – seeming to feel awfully pleasant. "You deserve it. The pain." He paused, looking down at his chosen one. "You started this."
"Fuck you. What does that even mean!"
'Finally,' Harry muttered in an exhale. He leaned back with his head against the wall, and thumbed the tip of his tongue along his upper lip - tasting the coppery frequent of blood in his entire mouth in seconds. 'Was it really that hard?'
"I went into a coma. Severe bloodloss got my pressure low. But Professor Snape came. He saved me. If it wasn't for him, I would've died." Malfoy narrowed his eyes, looking down at his scarred enemy – relentless. "Don't you ever dare to say that we were lovers. You're dead to me."
"Why the rush?" Snape never asked for an answer. No. He demanded it.
Harry's teeth clenched together, sweat nearly dripping down his brows as he stared at the badly erased word – still visible. His stomach was twisting, and though a nauseous fulfilled him, the corners of his mouth curled up a little if just for a split seconds. His palms were sweaty, quickly stuffing the envelope deep into his pocket.
Harry and Draco were later put in Professor Snape his office. No cup of tea to ease their nervous tummies, nor a tap on the shoulder – or a warm welcome home. They were sitting next to each other. Draco was obviously offended now his own headmaster decided to keep him here, and Harry seemed to be braindead. He stared ahead of him, his hands lightly folded, as if he was waiting for a train to arrive – or took his time to take a proper shit.
Harry touched the walls, as if he had troubles walking. "Professor?"
Snape pulled a face of disapproval and disgust, turning away to leave.
"I was curious," Harry replied. He didn't dare to approach him. Though he rarely felt out of space, right now he really couldn't find his comfort zone. What was he doing?
"Fine," Harry gritted through his teeth, his fists still clenched.
"Incomprehensible, you are."
'Do it,' Harry hissed through his clenched teeth now - he actually caught himself at smirking. He wasn't sure why, but he craved for Draco to hurt him. Though Draco always tried to come through as dangerous, powerful and sly, Harry had always felt more demanding over him, than vice versa. Draco approached him rapidly, but still didn't seem to be sure whether to hit him with his flattened hand again, or cast a harming spell. He knew them. He knew many of them. But did he ever dare to use even a single one?
"It's all your fault," Draco muttered as he rubbed his forehead. "It's always your fault."
'Draco-' he panted. 'Draco, I'm coming-'
"Aren't you a little bit too old for that?"
"You've been of great value, Neville," Harry replied surprisingly uplifted – tapping his shoulder as he left.
Malfoy marched through the tower, rubbing his chin before he took the time to speak again. "Lucky, I was."
A rendezvous.
"I do. Why would you ever doubt that?"
The door closed. Harry was send upstairs to head towards his tower – however, unguarded. Draco, on the other hand, was guarded by Professor Snape – holding him by his cloak, almost dragging him along the pavers towards his storeroom. Draco sat down on a stool, looking around – becoming awfully small once Snape got settled. Along the way they'd been talking. Draco's eyes were bloodshot. He wasn't just being punished because he sneaked out of school. There was more. He knew.
"It hurts, doesn't it?"
Draco drew his fingers past Harry's arm, kissing the spots of skin in Harry's neck as he sighed. "Don't worry too much."
Harry flinched, but couldn't keep himself from feeling highly excited at the familiar angry voice. Speedily he took a jump into one of the closest classrooms, what caused that he didn't have any time to think of the luck he had - being some off them still open - and after nuzzling himself between two bookshelves, he took a breath to listen to the sounds around after. It took quite a moment before someone finally pushed the door open - what Harry had been aiming for - and he found it rather confusing how he seemed to hope for that particular person. It appeared to be Malfoy.
Neville seemed to have changed his attitude. He acted more mature than ever – and even though Harry felt like a proud lill' daddy seeing his moron all grown-up by lovesick, he felt slightly offended. No matter, he made a turn and left – wiping the sweat off his brow. "I'd like to hold you right now," Harry muttered nervously to himself, wishing his blonde would show up like he used to do. Randomly and unexpected. Rushing through the corridors Harry made his way to the court-yard. A few were outside, walking around – trying to get some fresh air after all the smoke and alcohol they'd consumed the night before. The cold came sweet, like the kiss of Oblivion – making Harry forget his head had been pounding for the last few hours. No matter, it did freshen up his memory in a different way; he forgot to go to Professor Snape's office. He cursed once he looked up the time. Though he could be saved, going to the Professor's office right now, he couldn't gather the effort to actually go there. Ginny scared him off, and made his head quite a mess – afraid she'd tell the others. Sitting down at one of the benches outside, he rubbed his eyes trying to remember the lot of last night. His stomach tickled, funnily enough in an extraordinary pleasant way.
The end of the first story
"Don't, I get it. You took a taste of me, that was all." Ginny grabbed her stuff, rushing on her feet to leave the hall – and Harry had to follow.
Harry moved closer now, still not getting up, and placed his hands on Draco his hips – staring him straight in his gray bright eyes which shown suspicion.
He was paralyzed. His body aching – hands investigated his body. Could he care for their talk? Now their lips were connected, and they were all alone. Naked. It was going too fast for his mind to register their doings. Something he couldn't control. Not now the white-haired boy trailed his long, bony fingers down his body like searching through an old archive in the restricted area. "We shouldn't," Harry muttered nevertheless, as soon as he managed to pull back and look him in his blue, zircon eyes.
"No," Harry pled - watching his lover leave into the distance. "No, Draco, please. Don't-" He followed him in despair, trying to reach for him, eager to get a hold of him. "I loved you!" he growled as he dropped his knees into the grass. "I fucking loved you!!!" The veins in his neck bumped as he roared, pulling the weeds from the soil as he wept. "Curse you!" He drew his hands past his face, smearing the tears down his cheeks. "Fuck you..."
"Easy there."
The truth became inaudible the longer Dumbledore went on. Harry closed his eyes, rubbing his face as tears drew down his cheeks, a strike of breath leaving his throat as the final words dropped and left the room bare and cold. How it happened no longer mattered to him. What happened would never leave his memory. It was only the confirmation coming from Dumbledore's mouth that broke him to pieces.
"With him?" Luna's voice was high, but optimistic.
"Oh come on," Draco replied. He was smirking. "I came here for you. Alone. No one saw me."
Draco crushed his lips onto his - his fingers sliding through Harry's hair, eagerly searching for handhold. Harry stumbled, his elbows knocking over several piles of books and vases – clattering all over the floor, echoing through the enlarged room. Though pulling back would be the most reasonable thing to do, Harry didn't. Full surrender he leaned into the blonde's kiss – his chapped lips embracing his, wanting to taste Draco's breath on his tongue. For far too long they had been circling around each other. Their minds and bodies connected from afar. Though nothing seemed to be permitted, Harry couldn't care. Now being alone, buried between a dozen of lost things, he simply couldn't. It seemed like a dream. Their bodies full of ecstasy wrestling as they pulled each other's hair – their tongues entwining as they gasped for breath in between. It seemed like they were running a marathon. As if they were meant to finish within fifteen seconds before anyone would write them out.
"Ready for another strike, ye? I'd say, watch out. It might cost ye' head."
"We will be missed," Harry muttered as he got off the desk – suddenly not as frisky anymore. His energy was lacking, and his mood had dropped. He felt no longer the need of kissing another, and for all he knew he simply wanted to take a bath – and perhaps clean his mouth with a pint of butterbeer.
"You can," Harry replied softly, pulling the blonde's roots as he exhaled. "But not in our rooms. We should go to the room of-" He didn't finish, for bad things had happen in the room of requirement, and they both remembered them very well. Backing off he pulled his sleeves, shaking his head as he scratched it. "I'm sorry." Biting his lower lip he took a glance at the Slytherin entrance. "I feel so wrong."
"Silence."
"I am so sorry, Harry. I wish we could tell you different. I am saddened to inform you that I've had you obliviated in the past. Professor Snape and I decided this was the only way to keep you on the right tracks. We have decided to tell you this today because..."
"Calm down, damnit."
"I know a spell that causes one's skin to look as though it is coated in cornflakes. You'd like to see it?" Neville's eyes began to glitter – he loved to impress his friends with his silly skills. "It's..."
"Don't you tell me this isn't what you've been wanting all along." Wiping his tears he backed off – his face as sour as it could be, no matter the butterflies blooming up in his stomach.
"I'm going to escort you both back towards the castle. Tomorrow I want you at my office, Potter."
Draco crushed his lips onto his, his fingers digging deep into the fabric covering his shoulders, and no matter how stupid it could've sound, he deeply wished he could've become him at that very moment. His body shivered under his touch. It seemed all so forced yet felt so right. Harry pulled back eventually, placing his head against his before he closed his eyes and clenched his teeth. His face saddened, his voice now small.
"He has been a better dad than yours. Dying at your bed while you lay drooling! Didn't do shit to protect either you or your mother. He just wanted to die! Just to be released from your bullshit future."
Harry smiled once more, though it faded as soon as he realized the blonde didn't come any closer. "Can I kiss you?"
Harry gulped and dropped his head as he sighed. "Professor Snape," he replied - not to greet but to state.
"Tell me. What is it you want from me now?"
"How are the others?" he snapped as he swept his hand along the counter – toothbrushes clattering down to the ground. "Where the fuck are my glasses!"
Harry raised his brows and relocated his head on his pillow. "The stairs?"
"You'll be dead, if anyone finds out."
"Shut up," Harry sneered as he arched his back. "What happened to Draco? Tell me!"
Harry gulped and tried to climb out of bed - resulting for his arms to swing half-cross the air, his body unable to grand him what he wanted. "I need to go," he stammered as he managed to kick one foot out of bed. "I need to go..."
Ron scoffed awkwardly, throwing looks at both Seamus and Neville. "I'm sorry, Harry. I didn't know you cared so much."
"Good." The blonde took his time to scan the grounds, see if there would be anyone around to bother, so he could jump out next. A groan escaped his lips as his heels hit the grass.
Today was way more difficult to keep a straight face. Though Harry finally shared some words with Draco after a while, he still couldn't believe how it could've taken so long for them to meet again. Eagerly he waited for the day to end, and dinner to be served at the Great Hall. After stuffing his mouth with mashed potatoes and chicken, he rushed over to the castle grounds once more - hoping to see the blonde before he would arrive at the boathouse were they were meant to meet. The air was nice that evening. Warm, especially for the time of year. No jacket was needed. Though the sun was low, and almost already vanished, the last beams of light felt great on his skin. It felt like being kissed. As if he could taste the bittersweet of future; the postponed love he was meant to find. Harry didn't find a trace of Draco, walking past the tree and the river - keeping an eye out for any Perfects. Would he bail out again? Harry shook off his fears, starting by shaking his head all the way down from his arms to his legs as he exhaled – as if he was about to put up a fight. He would be right on time. Eight was the time they'd agreed on. Draco insisted so himself. However, now the time was there, Harry didn't feel so eager anymore. Why wait for two months to show yourself again? In fact, how was he able to disappear like that – even though they went to the exact same school. They lived there.
Rogue, it said on the front. Harry wrinkled his nose, trailing backwards as he closed off the window, trying to find his bed with the back of his legs. Ron was downstairs already, and so he was alone. Flipping it, he saw it was sealed with a Malfoy's wax stamp, dark and leaked – as if it was stamped with a rush with just a simple various D scrabbled on the inner corner of the envelope as soon as he snapped it open.
'Don't worry,' Harry repeated again as he pulled back his head for a second – wetting his lips to make it more pleasant, and much easier for himself. Within seconds he took his companion's erection in his mouth again – deeper than he had before – and as he finally started to suck, moving his head slowly up and down, Draco just gave in after another loud grown, and threw his head in his neck by delight. His cheeks fluttered bright red, and loud panting got audible. His hands were sweaty now. His fingertips got pinched against the dark wood of the desk, and his back writhed more at the faster Harry moved.
Professor Snape seemed to pretend as if he didn't hear it. He stiffly continued his walk, yet a single hesitation seen as Harry cleared his throat and visibly stumbled on his feet. Snape's back raised black and tall from the whitened pavers, his feet invisible as his gigantic cloak followed his movements. It was almost scary. It frightened him, seeing Snape here, and not with Draco – being his favourite caretaker of all time, and in great debt of the Malfoy's community. Harry knew he'd been a death eater, if not still. Harry ran after him, trying to hold on to his swift pass as he tried not to look too eager or desperate. Nevertheless, Snape didn't stop. No matter the sound of Harry's sneakers hitting the stone floor.
Snape presented himself as furious, until Harry spoke of Malfoy's name – easing his anger, exchanging it for suspicion.
"Ew," Ron chuckled as he tossed a comic to the side. "You look like a granny. How long have you been lingering under the shower?"
It was going to be a dreadful night.
"I thought you got tired of me."
"This isn't helping," Harry eventually continued as he walked away. His eyes scanned the room as if he'd never seen it before, and he clenched his teeth. "I want to know what's been going on lately." He turned once more to look professor Dumbledore in the eye. "Someone should know. I'm starting to question my sanity."
"What happened?" he muttered as he slowly rocked his head from side to side.
"I miss you too," Draco replied with a breath, tightening his arms around the boy's body. "Everything will be better in time."
"It's good to have you back. We will see you this afternoon?" She squeezed his hand before she hopped back onto her feet and grabbed Ronald by the him of his shirt to tug him along.
"Because we've got to go to bed?" Harry raised his brows, surprised by his remarkable question, and he pushed him off. Draco turned his back on him, scratching his chest, fumbling his neck – unaware of the amount of hickeys. "We can sleep here?" Draco suggested. Harry scoffed.
'I said you look shitty,' Harry quickly corrected himself - wriggling himself quickly out of Draco's awkward embrace while closing the buttons of his cotton shirt. There were spots of blood on it, one button had been apparently pulled off, and he wasn't sure how to fix that all quickly. He snorted after thumbing the back of his hand along his lips, and headed away then, though not leaving the classroom just yet. It appeared that Harry really didn't feel secure about this - though this brief, random, uncommon making-out scene with his enemy hadn't feel bad at all. In fact, it had feel great even.
"Hey Harry," Luna's voice was laced with respect; high and soft. "You don't seem too happy."
"How particular," Harry spoke as he watched her leave. "She used to hate you, and now you two are hooked up. What a world, huh?"
"You," he hissed as he threw a quick glance over his shoulder. He grabbed Harry's shoulder to pull him further into light. "How did you get here?"
Harry gasped as he threw his heavy body on the nearest chair, and gazed around as he stroked a lock of hair out of his face. "Another death-wish?"

After a moment of silence, Harry gritted his teeth – wanting to leave, if just to break the dreadful silence causing his head to spin. Their distance was small, causing Harry to bring up desires barely knew of. He had to leave. He couldn't make a fool out of himself now.
Their seconds were valuable. Even though Lovegood asked Longbottom to keep his nose out of other peoples business, he couldn't keep his nose from doing so anyways now he was empowered by love.
"Stop the selflessness," Harry cried as he grabbed his head. "You don't understand."
Ron shrugged, tugging his bed sheets to cover his bare legs. "I only did so to protect-"
"Don't go melodramatic on me, Potter. I hate to see you like this. I can't believe you considered yourself as the potential chosen one..." Draco paused. A twitch in his brow betrayed him; along with the way he crossed his fingers to loosen his up his joints. His voice became awfully small, and as he took a breath he leaned in – watching his enemy from up close. "You are," Draco continued, his face troubled, "but to die."
Mr. Borgin slowly sauntered through the shop, looking for the cause of the sounds, and he stood still staring down at the mess in front of the fireplace. Someone came in there through there... Someone who'd disappear just as quick as he or she arrived.
"I am not crazy!"
"Potter," Draco breathed.
"So what now?" he asked eventually, throwing a glance over his shoulder. The blonde stared at his wand, as if he was ready to use it.
"-What about Draco?" Harry cut through. Enclosing the group, he wished to talk about any other business but them two. "What happened?"
"I want you to go!" he shouted – his breath irregular. "My father is going to kill me," his voice betrayed his worries. He was scared. If his father found out about this, not only Harry would be dangling on a string, but Draco too. How disgraceful it was to come out defenseless – a shame for his family. His bloodline.
"Motherfu..." Harry groaned as he managed to open his eyes. The room he was in was dark. His glasses were nowhere to be found, and the surface he'd been sleeping on was rock solid. Rubbing his eyes, he hoped to get a better view – perhaps he could find his glasses by touch. Something alive laid to his side, a dash of white jumped up as his eyes managed to adjust – but nothing was clear enough to identify. Once finding his glasses – located a couple of feet afar – he got up from the ground to scan the area. Funny, how he seemed to have forgotten about the way he fell asleep here, last night. His eyes got caught by the white blur laying afar from him, and after crouching down, he recognized the person immediately. Thinking for it to have been a dream, his heart skipped a beat – reality dropping in like a bomb. After creating a certain distance between his enemy, his memory rushed back like a train. It was like he'd been drunk of lust the other night. Blinded by hate by the deceit of his dearest friends, he sought for salvation. And Malfoy was there to give it to him. Malfoy remained sleeping – both of their cardigans spread over his body to keep him warm. Nothing happened that night, beside their make out sessions. The night continued with arguments, ignorance, and mocking comments – though none of them left. Remarkable. It made no sense.
Harry drew his chin, clenching his jaw once he met Snape's eyes. "It is mainly you, it seems. And his father. Don't you tell me what to do!"
It was most clear that Hermione let out an annoyed sigh, resulting for Harry to jump into his bathrobes as quick as possible – stuffing his dry toothbrush between his teeth, hoping to take the attention off his red fluttered cheeks. Funny, how he didn't even realize he put on his glasses the very second he got out of the tub. As if they'd never been gone – because they had not.
"Your obsession with the Malfoy's. It's becoming stronger."
"-I thought you loved me."
"I thought you loved me." She cried, drying her tears while yanking her arm.
"Hi Harry," a flirting, female voice spoke from behind. Harry looked over his shoulder, watching Romilda Vane passing by – holding the Spella Weekly magazine close to her chest. Harry forced a smile as he awkwardly lifted his hand for a wave. No matted his fierce responds to whatever her silly questions were, she couldn't stop being obsessive about him, as it seemed. Drawing her fingers through her darkened curls, she chuckled as she planned on circling around. Thank Merlin's beard for the distraction coming from her left side – Draco's fellow mates Crabbe and Goyle, looking grumpy as always. "Fatso," Harry smiled as he got up, jumping in front of Crabbe's feet. Looking at Goyle he frowned his brows, disturbed by his sloppy appearance. "Bigfoot... Any of you seen Malfoy?"
"You are in trouble too," Snape replied, his glare cold and merciless.
Snape did not reply. He simply stood there for a couple of seconds until he turned away - folding the edges of his sleeves as a part of grooming.
"You're joking."
"We are going home," Harry smiled as he brushed his fingers down Hedwig her feathers. "We are finally going home again." Though Harry's time off was no bad deal, according to the fun things he'd done with his friends, yet Hogwarts was the only place he could really feel like home. Just as he finished stuffing his last belongings in his trunk, he wrinkled his brows – hearing a knocking noise on one of the windows. As he walked on over – pulling the hems of the curtains to open them swiftly – he stood eye to eye with an eagle owl, his shaded feathers reflecting by the fluttering sun. He held tight to a letter, clamped in his beak, and looked judgemental for not opening the window already. Harry looked around, wondering where he came from, and pulled the squeaky hinge to open the window at last. Slowly extending his arm, trying to fetch the letter as slowly as possible, he strained eye contact – seeing the murderous glance on the bird as if it was ready to eat his whole hand as a light snack. Luckily the bird appeared to be completely harmless, and flew off as soon as the parchment clamped between Harry's fingers.
"Don't pretend like you care," Draco snarled. "You know how he is. You were right."
"Tonight. At the boathouse. At eight?"
"Don't," Harry threatened as he pointed at him. "Don't even start. You're a fucking snake. Your silver tongue will no longer work on me."
Harry's heart skipped a beat with ever further approach he made. How could he have been so dull? It was a sign. Draco Malfoy was trying his upper best to enter his mind, to manipulate his dreams, and give him hints about their future meeting. There had to be something he wanted to say. Though Malfoy tried to keep his distance, he could feel his presence. He could feel him – touching him, watching him. Harry's obsession grew stronger to the day, and he wanted to know where he was. Where they were. Either Draco became one of the Dark Lord's spies, or something else was going on - something much stronger and more powerful. A bound. A connection. In whatever way possible.
'Selling,' Lucius finished in a mutter as he scanned the room. 'There's something outside I'd like to you to see.'
Less than a minute after Hermione's leaving, a loud growl echoed through the corridor.
'Yeah. Don't worry about me. I'll catch you up in minutes, I think. It won't take long.'
'Look. If you've suddenly decided to act like a badboy, that's fine with me...' She frowned now, shaking her head quickly. 'Well, it's not fine. But... who am I to-' She never finished her sentence and just inhaled deeply. 'Just stay out of trouble. Okay?'
Harry kept his jaws clenched. He didn't want to respond anymore. He'd given too much information already. God, she was good at guessing.
Harry pursed his lips after pressing another kiss on his skin, this time on the exact spot where his bellybutton was located.
the longer he gazed the world seemed to reappear. A crowd of smiling folks stood around him and
"What?"
"What are you talking about?"
"You know me," she replied, laughing softly as she sat herself down. "I have everything well planned."
'I can not blame your father,' Harry continued then - what made Draco lower his wand for a single moment, if just a bit. '-you're really the most pathetic guy I've ever met in my entire life.' And they both knew, compared to others Harry knew, that that was something to feel indignant and offended about. Finally something seemed to snap in Malfoy. His eyes widened as the muscles in his neck tensed, and in seconds Harry got a fist crushed against his nose. A warm, glowing feeling numbed Harry's nose, and in seconds he felt how a stream of warm blood rushed down from his nostrils towards his salmon pink lips. Proudly he revealed his white teeth, showing off his gums that coloured ruby red in no time too, and to Draco's surprise Harry didn't seem to hit back like he expected him to.
A sweeping noise got audible, and before Harry knew what was happening, a row of textbooks dropped down from the shelves - right in front of his feet. It was more of a small explosion that had been caused by Draco's spell nearly hitting Harry's head what had probably been the intention.
The white haired boy took a breath, leaning back against the wall – showing no sign of wanting to participate.
"Ehhr," Neville threw Luna a confused look. "Malfoy got kicked out of school?"
"More than ever," Harry smiled, showing off his teeth as he began to move down the stairs.
Harry rushed through the hallways like a ghost – unseen and swiftly, almost like his feet barely touched the ground. He took a moment to rest when he was near the main hall – his cheeks fluttered red by adrenaline and ecstasy. He had to find Malfoy. He had to know what he was up to. Hearing a familiar giggle, he clamped himself against the nearest wall – hiding in a corner to stay hidden. Hermione and Ron came around, both giggling – innocence drooling off their faces.
Snape's voice was raw and dark. His worries seemed real at last, yet didn't make it any less complicated. Draco shrank, his white hair sticking sleekly against his forehead – his skin cold and clammy. His eyes were burning red. He'd been crying. Snape scoffed, disgusted by his weakness – leaving a terrible taste in his mouth. "You are weak, like your father."
"I bet you'd like that."
"It's you who's at stake here! Don't lose sight of your obligations, Malfoy."
"It's complicated," he simply replied as Snape pinched his arm and pulled Draco to stand up.
Harry scoffed, leaning back into the seat while watching the movements of his hands. "Snape doesn't feed. Not with food or drinks. But with the eternal suffering of his students."
"You've had a mild concussion, that's all, dear."
The night continued. Masks were lowered, and people were starting to get rather wasted – for what they could. Ron and Hermione got into a large fight, and Neville puked all over Luna's feet, now trying to make it up to her as he cried his eyes out. Harry sat in the corner once more. His body restless yet weak, no matter how hard he tried to have at least a bit of fun. "Where are you?" he muttered to himself as he scraped the refined leathery edges off his mask. A few were still dancing, others were snogging, and Argus Filch cursed to himself as he swept the stoned floor clean. Harry got himself ready to stand up and leave for bed, for he could not prevent his friends from breaking up, or felt like easing the innocence from his fellow students – a.c. Luna and Neville. Lifting his hand, he waved his friends goodbye – stumbling on his feet, his view vivid now he was intoxicated. Hermione cried, giving Ronald the hand as he served Harry a smile, and the others didn't bother. Today turned out to be a disaster, and though none of it seemed to be any of his fault, he did feel to blame. Mister Filch served Harry one last foul look, before he demanded the rest to leave as a well, yet Harry didn't wait up. Wandering through the halls he searched for redemption.
The blonde didn't reply on his comment, and just narrowed his eyes, kneeling down in front of the drawer from the desk.
Harry exhaled deeply and wiggled his fingers as he stretched his arms down his sides. "Would Draco Malfoy be able to get into Hogwarts if he wanted to?"
It's good to have you back.
Draco looked at him for a second, wanting to reply, but tore away his eyes and left - leaving Harry standing near the gate.
"Oh thank fuck, you showed up."
The boy remained still. Just a soft noise of breathing came from under the silver-plated layer. Peculiar, how it looked a lot creepier now they were standing alone in a dark corridor. "Funny, how you decided to pop up every now and then, but still don't have the guts to speak to me. Should I be impressed? Take it off."
"-I can't," Harry tried to compete. "It wouldn't only destroy me, but also another. If that person isn't destroyed already."
'Blimey Harry!'
"Oh come," Draco bared his gums, "Snape wouldn't do that to me. My father would kill him."
A harsh and low voice made him startle – causing him almost to topple over as he dropped his book. It was Goyle, pointing his wand at him by anger.
The crowd looked from afar - great worry coming from their faces, and a perfect, Harry could not extinguish, asked them all to leave. Harry cried and gasped for breath as several nurses came running in and were asked to keep him down.
Harry took a deep breath as he wandered through the halls. He managed to find some ease on his own, yet his mind wasn't put to rest just yet. He had to find Draco. He had to know whether he was still around. Unfortunately entering the Slytherin dorms wasn't an option, and so he paced through the dungeons – hoping to find him there. Holding his advanced potion making book, he decided to read a little – hoping not to took too suspicious as he wandered around.
The days came and went. Before Harry took any time to prepare for the holidays, it was soon to be Christmas - and the halls were joyfully dressed with decorations. The choir was singing, each and every day right before lunch, practicing in the Great Hall, and the frogs were out to join them; merry, happy, and full of air. Draco came and went, just like time. Though he did not participate in each and every class, he came around more often - if just to show up between the switch to blow Harry a kiss, or to tug him into the mensroom. Harry decided to let it go, his Christmas plans including Draco. There was no way he would manage to keep the blonde at school, and no matter how much he wished he could, he wouldn't be able to ditch on the Weasleys either - for they were always there for him, and way too keen on having him around at Christmas. And the holiday arrived.
Ron cocked his head and frowned. "Yeah? Draco has been making a fool out of you all week?"
"Where are we headed?"
"It's not just me, Harry," Draco replied, wiping Harry's tears away. "I love you,"
"Feeling anything?" Draco was referring to the way Harry squeezed his butt. Nevertheless, Harry caught up the question as something different, and so he squeezed out another grown as he grabbed the back of Draco's head – softly pulling the roots from his hair as he pressed his lower parts against his hips. His back writhed and he couldn't keep his animal-sounding vocals to himself anymore – even though Draco was barely doing anything. Apparently, Harry had some sexual frustrations hiding in his body, or he'd been craving for Draco to do this for way too long already.
Today was Halloween. The chatter and laughter had become louder, and tricks were done all through the day. Tonight there would be a ball. Hermione got them their outfits, and though Harry hadn't seen them yet, he wasn't as keen too either. Ronald still lived his lie, leaving Hermione clueless according to the situation – and funnily enough Harry seemed to be more sorry than he was. However, he couldn't get tangled in between them. He finally had his friends back. No matter how it could break them, as the golden trio, he was selfish enough not wanting to lose the both of them again – for now he felt lonelier than ever.
"I'm pissed at them because they kept it a secret. Did you know?"
Draco lowered his wand, letting go of Harry's collar, and straightened his back as he threw another glance to the front door.
"You fucking pervert." Harry threw back the sock, landing right on Seamus' forehead. Ron cocked his head, not speaking just yet.
"Mister Potter, I've been asked to keep you in bed. I cannot allow-"
"Please," Harry yielded. "Don't-"
Harry gritted his teeth, his lips turning into a sour line, and before Draco managed to pass his arm length, he gave him a push – causing Draco to topple over and drop his case in vain.
"So? I saw you two hooking up, not giving a single shit about me?"
"Sorry?"
Their hearts were burning with desire. Draco spoke in solid gold, and his hands felt like the hot summer air. Harry looked up into his eyes, a prey volunteering for his death. Everything seemed to have changed. But who could tell him this would last long? The blonde broke his thoughts by kissing him again, taking off their boxers without a sound. The silence was appreciated, no matter their huffing.
'Well perhaps you should stop hitting me for once. It would safe you lots of books and energy.'
"I know about you and Draco."
They laid there for about an hour. Silence enclosed them, and they barely touched. They were lying apart in a V-shape, only their temples touching – their fingers an inch from meeting. Harry finally awoke from his slumbering state. He slightly moved his head to the side, looking whether Draco's eyes were already closed or not, and he held his breath. His eyes hurt, as for his head, and he felt awfully close to crying. "I love you," he whispered, closing his own eyes too now. A brief silence followed, and a strange hollowness grew strong in Harry's chest. It was the feeling of being heartbroken. He firmly pressed his eyes close, turning to his other side so he no longer had to look at his enemy, and he pulled the sheets off the ground to cover his lower body.
"This is Snape his office, you know? Don't you think he'll mind if we-"
"Why are you here?" Harry stammered, his runny nose blocking his vocals. "Why are you doing this?"
The night had started. The opening ceremony was done, and as usual everyone was forced to do a waltz – as Professor McGonagall was ever so pleased with the Christmas results from years ago. Hermione looked beautiful as ever. Her dress faint yellow, extraordinary and tremendous with a silver laced mask attached to her face without a string – and than Ronald looking rather silly, as if he tried to mock the elderly. Harry, on the other hand, was natural; a black suit, bordeaux tie, and his mask – a weak excuse for a Dracula-like costume.
"Yeah," Draco replied, his voice soft – his throat being sore. "Get your shit, we've got to go, Potter." Malfoy transformed again. His former attitude creating for him to be the greatest ass again, and Harry couldn't stand it.
"I swear, if you are lying I'll be breaking your freaking arm," Harry dug his nails inside Ronald's flesh.
"Now you've caused Malfoy's leaving."
"What are you talking about?" Draco chuckled under his breath. "Of course I'm here." He placed his hand on Harry's shoulder once more, pulling him closer as he went to lay down himself. "Harry, are you alright?"
Ron thumbed the tip of his tongue along his lips, suddenly triggered to get his books from his bags – if just to create a little distraction. "So?" Ron shrugged. His pensive attitude caused Harry's teeth on edge, and once Professor Snape came through the door, he bend forward to hiss something offensive.
"Because I simply want you. No bloody feelings attached."
"Shut it," Professor Snape hissed – slowing his moves. "You," he muttered, his icy glare and bony index-finger pointing at Harry who slowly crawled up from his former position. "Not even a foot planted behind the walls of Hogwarts, and you decide to pick up a fight. You two are coming with me."
"Sorry?"
"What do you know about it?" Draco loosened up his tie, rushing his fingers through his hair. "Don't tell me you have any idea of what you're talking about."
Harry pressed the back of his hand against his lower lip, preventing the blood from spilling – even though it wasn't much.
Hermione gasped for breath as she finally found some support by leaning against a wall, and after she hit Harry several times on his shoulder with her just-barrowed library book, she clenched her teeth to purse her lips highly unsatisfied after. 'Why on earth did you do that?'
"Goyle." Harry crouched to grab his book, but Goyle snorted – hissing for him to back off. "Calm down you chicken," Harry hissed. "I'm sure you barely know how to use that thing." He was referring to Goyle his wand.
Draco pushed himself off the ground, his tie hanging on his shoulder, and his hair messed up. "Fine," Draco barked as he took his wand. He took a deep breath, pointing out at his enemy, and readied himself to give it a go. However, Harry decided to ignore the rules, and cursed out a spell giving Draco no opportunity to defensive himself.
Harry was unable to move. The questioning expression remained on his face, though now panic glistened his eyes. "What?"
They had to talk. They had to sit down and talk for hours. No more bullshit. No more lies. Harry couldn't bear to live another minute knowing Draco's feelings could change like the weather on sunny spring day. Harry took a glance behind him, watching the dusty piano that used to make a fine melody a long time ago. It reminded him of the first few encounters with Draco. Sexual encounters. Full of tension and burning desire. It seemed silly to keep his mind busy with business he shouldn't commit to. Would his parents have accepted his sexual preferences? If this was a preference at all? Harry would still not admit to be gay – knowing what went on with the blonde went far beyond just loving or lust. It was like they were drawn to each other. Made to intertwine. Soulmates. Forbidden lovers like the ones in the muggle stories about Romeo and Juliet. He remembered those books lingering around aunt Petunia – wanting more from live than it had to offer, knowing her life would never be as exciting as those of the two forbidden lovers – or her lost, magical sister and (by aunt Petunia's) abandoned child. He could no longer remember the last time he went to the Dudley's. Boy, what would happened if they know about him and Draco. They would go bloody mad.
"It's okay,' Harry simply whispered. "I want this," he continued – stroking the blonde's thighs after pushing down his pants. "And you've done me before."
It was pointless.
"He couldn't hold it in, the psycho he is."
"I know you're not, Harry." Dumbledore took a deep breathe and gestured Snape to come closer. "Severus, please. Could you?"
"Who are you?" Harry muttered as his hand trailed across the wall to find the cabinet. "I will kill you Ron, really."
