Harry's eyes widened but his first instinct wasn't to jump to his feet and lie through his teeth but to clutch Draco's arm tighter. He distantly remembered how Draco had said
But Draco didn't remember any of that. He could not remember any of that. He won't remember any of that.
They left the elegant, high-ceilinged room and ventured outside through the french doors. They walked silently to where the ceremony was being held, in one of the largest gardens of Malfoy Manor.
-"Yes, exactly. So rude and unexpected. I did not see it coming. But isn't that where the fun is? In being surprised and stuff. Although, it was, admittedly, an unpleasant surprise but a surprise nonetheless," Harry said. He was bullshiting Draco, trying to deflect and doing a horrible job at it.
potentially ruin lives. Then, he remembered, that she literally knew his underwear size and that she loved him, unconditionally, and relaxed. The fucking cow. Impressive, though.
-"You did. You'd check him out under the guise of glaring at him. You bullied the Weaslette and Granger mercilessly because you were jealous. Merlin!When was it? A bit before Theo...so I'm guessing the beginning of the Triwizard tournament?" Blaise said.
Presently Draco Malfoy woke up. He was in bed, and it was still dark beyond his closed eyelids. He felt warm, a small body was tucked against him.
-"Is it? Your Godfather was a disgrace. Hadn't he been disowned? He had no right to leave you this. Hadn't it been a time of war, Mother would have certainly taken it back. I suppose we still can, out of spite if nothing else. It's nothing much, you see. I've never really liked it."
came to enemy territory, that Harry was essentially leaving his morals and principles and everything he stood for by coming here, and not only that, but above all the undeniable
for why you're feeling the way you do, a reason which would also, if not encourage you to see me, at least not prohibit it. It was a bit tricky, so you took two weeks—what was it Potter? What was the reason you came up with?"
feeding them, really, because no one ever made the mistake of trying out their food twice. What did they look like? Harry saw them clearly everyday, yet the moment he'd look away he wouldn't remember a thing! When the fuck did they start working at the cafeteria? Who are '
-"I just...it's been years and I've been ruminating over this for eight of them...trying to pinpoint when the fuck it all went wrong. Blaming myself for not telling you sooner, blaming them for keeping quiet— Blaise is going to be feeling like shit.
So, Harry Potter was waiting. He waited for quite a while before he heard Scorpius's giggling and hurried to be in position as they turned the corner. Scorpius was jumping up and down zabini's arms, speaking rapidly in french to his father, wearing such a pretty, pink robe, with matching, pink, little socks and shoes, Harry couldn't help but blurt out a "Woaaah!"
Draco Malfoy had a surprisingly good first day. At least work-wise. He loved potions and brewing, he was Severus Snape's godson after all. He was really good at Potions. He'd worked years with French and european wizards and acquired remarkable expertise. He somewhat missed potions a little, maybe even slightly enjoyed being back to work—that was a fucking
-"And because the department is the second largest one in the ministry, they have this huge kitchen, where they take turns to cook and bake all sorts of stuff and to spice things up a bit, they take the food down to eat it at the cafeteria. Everyone says the food of the cafeteria tastes like rat-infested hundred-years old rotten cheese." Draco dramatically shuddered. Theo smiled. "Their words not mine. Anyways. Scorpius has every single person in my department wrapped around his little fingers. They worship him. It's hilarious how much chocolate cake was brought in for him this morning after he'd told everyone how much he loved it yesterday. It was too much, even for him." Draco chuckled.
Théo got the huge, black, marble bath ready with a flick of his wand. Draco hopped in the bath, settled in, and moaned contentedly.
he stepped out of the fireplace. His white-blond hair had caught Harry's attention immediately. He looked different, though, than the scared boy he'd been during the war. For one thing, his hair reached his shoulder blades—Harry had mentally scowled, because he would never be able to pull such a thing off. Whatever. Malfoy looked like a fucking girl. But Harry, unsurprisingly, hadn't really been able to put his finger on what was different other than that...
-"Get the fuck off me! Since when is cheating forbidden. I'll kick you in the balls, Draco. I swear."
Oh, Merlin. Harry's life was fucked. He laughed and laughed and laughed and cried while laughing - because he was mad; mad, mad,
Presently, Draco Malfoy screamed, a silent scream. Every cell in his body screamed, heart twisting, thrashing excruciatingly fast, his stomach cramped, painfully so, he doubled over, hyperventilating, the girl that wasn't
After what felt like years but was only a couple of weeks she'd forgotten all about it and had him go with her to muggle-London, saying 'mione had advised her to check out muggle babies' clothing-stores rather than Wizarding ones. And although she still didn't know the baby's gender, she was impatient to just browse through all of the options and maybe buy some unisex stuff.
Harry chuckled, he leaned in to kiss Draco just as he turned his head away and yawned, so Harry pressed his lips to Draco's jaw instead. It seemed ironically fitting and somewhat described their entire relationship - outside forces' unshakable, constant interference, taking whatever he could, whenever he could, picking the wrong-timing, living the wrong life. Maybe if Harry wasn't who he was, maybe if they didn't have so much history, maybe if Harry was sorted into Slytherin, maybe if Draco could genuinely forgive him, maybe if—
He'd never been kissed by a Dementor. But he figured this was what it must feel like. Except a thousand times worse. Draco felt like all the Dementors in the world were kissing him at once. Sucking his soul. Drenching him in freezing-cold despair. Feeding on the memory of Astoria's laughter. On Astoria's smile. On the scent of her hair. On Astoria's singing—He screamed.
, he's a good man, despite what the rest of you pathetic, self-righteous scum think of him. So you don't fool me, Potter. Not to mention how Draco's entire night out and tacit admission when we'd asked him where the fuck he was, was answer enough." Blaise snarled at him.
Harry was loathe to admit that he believed some of what the media said about Malfoy. It was mostly fabricated by Lucius but Harry had been there in Malfoy Manor. He'd been there on the Astronomy tour. He'd seen Malfoy in Voldemort's mind. The war had been won thanks to Narcissa's love for Malfoy, after all. He didn't think him evil, no, Harry simply thought him a bloody menace.
, whereupon he proceeded to kiss Draco like they were newly-dating, horney teenagers, who'd just discovered the wonders of foreplay, and unable to get their hands off one another, were hurriedly getting each other off between classes.
Malfoy needed him, Harry would help him, be there for him. Save him—Or so Harry had thought until last Wednesday, when Harry's plans of confronting Draco about everything the next lunch two-hour (the Gryffindor way) and having Malfoy admit everything and feeling lighter and better for having someone to share his burdens with, having him thank Harry for
But Draco wasn't going anywhere. He'd ask the house-elves to move his things to Scorpius's room in the morning. He needed his son. He was all Draco had left from
Harry spared a moment to contemplate how he was so out of shape - his wand was nowhere in sight and in fact still tucked up his sleeve. Some auror he was. But the thing is, he didn't feel threatened by Malfoy, he knew Malfoy wouldn't hurt him. Nothing serious at least. He didn't have it in him. Harry watched Malfoy's indifferent face. He didn't seem like he pulled out his wand out of anger. He seemed to do it to speed up the inevitable - Harry getting angry and indignant at Malfoy's haughtiness, regretting ever speaking up and apologizing, brushing Malfoy off as the conceited asshole he'd always been and storming off forever.
Blaise drifted away in another direction. Draco stood on tiptoes but didn't see Theo. He looked back at Greg who was studiously making his way through every dish in the buffet and smiled. He turned to his son.
-"Oh, yes. The fright of my life! Though she'll always have a place in my heart. I'd renege our love in a heartbeat for her. Sorry, Draco." Theo said, a dreamy look on his face.
They trudged up the stairs, talking about how they would Crucio the fuck out of the muggle who'd sold Harry the movie if Jack/Leo died again.
-"You can keep the house, anything. Take it all. I'm aware of the consequences of my actions and I promise you all - I
When Nott was a few feet away from Harry, without a stutter in his walk, he pointed his wand at Harry and disarmed him. And before Harry could form a single thought:
He started breathing rapidly, on the verge of hyperventilating. His eyes and expression were no longer of cold standoffishness. He seemed mad. Tormented.
Draco picked up a chocolate-covered Scorpius and cleaned him up with a Scourgify, glaring half-heartedly at Greg who was smiling slyly at Scorpius.
Draco walked the few steps between them and wrapped his arms tightly around Théo's neck. Théo hugged him back just as tightly. They stayed like that for a while, drawing comfort from each other.
-"You know what? We can send her stuff if we want. We put them someplace and she'll get them. I'll show you where tomorrow. We can go pick your Mother's favorite flowers - Narcissus. She loves them. Oh, and how about sweets? We can send her chocolate and candy. You know how she loves them. What do you think?"
Theo stood up and helped Draco to his feet, half-carrying him and plain carrying him when it'd gotten too hard and tedious for Draco halfway through, they made it to Théo's designated chambers. They only slept in them when they're supposedly working so hard and sleeping so little they wouldn't want to stay at Scorpius's room, (that was theirs really, all three of them) stumble in late at night and risk waking Scorpius.
. I don't want to feel like that. I don't want pity. I don't want sympathy either. I don't want you to care about my suffering,
, always will be at hers. She'd have forgiven me anything. I'd watch the whole damn world burn for her. But I can't—could never burn it
He looked around his sombre, dreary, empty bedroom; it wasn't truly empty, it was well-furnished, made for a young couple, white, soft cotton sheets on the king-sized bed, creamy and intricately embroidered curtains on the windows, shiny dark-brown wooden floorboards underneath the pale brown carpet, a fairly new-looking (although centuries old) wooden dresser. A bedside table with a few Quidditch magazines that Harry haven't had the will to read yet. It was all minimalistic in a modern way. Yet, it felt empty. Not because the other half of the young couple that Harry was supposed to be part of wasn't here, not at all, Ginny had actually been around for a few days, about a week ago, but Harry hadn't been spending much time in Grimmauld Place, to be frank, his memory of the past couple of weeks was hazy at best, he couldn't recall the details, but she'd come and gone and was probably mad at him for several things. He couldn't bring himself to care, feel guilty, feel anything beyond the constant painful knot in his belly, the dread and fear pressing down on his chest, the anxiety making every breath ache, the hopelessness weighting him down. Every day that teeny tiny light that could be seen at the end of the tunnel was wavering, flickering on and off and Harry feared that it would one day be extinguished and he would be lost in darkness forever. Maybe it wasn't even a tunnel, maybe it was a labyrinth, and maybe, in reality, Harry's suffering had no end in sight.
He sent a Patronus to Blaise, telling him he'd left work already with Potter. Pansy and Blaise would kill to be updated on Potter's little crush. So, Blaise wouldn't think it weird that Draco accepted to go anywhere with him to satiate their frankly unhealthy obsession.
support system and was actively avoiding things that could potentially trigger another relapse into the fog.
Draco Malfoy came strolling down the corridor in the center of the two rows of auror cubicles, looking heart-stoppingly beautiful and scrumptious. White hair bellowing behind him, black, tight-fitting robes giving him an aura of irresistible mystery. Cold, calculating, pained—if you knew him— silver eyes lazily scanning his surroundings.
Surly, surly his insides couldn't get any more knotted, his stomach couldn't ache more than it already did without killing him.
, the rightness that engulfed him at the contact. Draco Malfoy was more important than the air Harry fucking breathed.
Harry was seriously starting to believe Zabini when he'd said that Harry wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, although Zabini didn't put it as nicely and muggle-y.
Day after day, Harry's health worsened, unable to eat, to sleep, to properly pull in air, constantly suffering from acute heartache, head-splitting headaches, gut-wrenching yearning. Harry Potter was slowly but surly wasting away.
Draco felt...weird. Better? He was warm again. The fog had cleared away significantly. He felt confortable. Someone was talking to him. He could hear the soft cadence of their voice. Who was it? Draco was curious. He hadn't been lonely in the fog. No. He'd only been either numb or in pain.
Hermione moved to grab Scorpius's hand and continue down to the cafeteria with everyone in tow, to give them privacy. Except Draco spoke before she could.
But Harry, right then, with the love of his life in his arms, who was most certainly not his wife Ginny weasley, resolved to break things off with her the moment she steps foot in Grimmauld Place again. For although Harry chose Draco, he still didn't want to lie or get caught and fuck up any chance at reconciliation with the Weasleys in the future. After they all cool down a bit, perhaps they would miss Harry and remember that he wasn't always Ginny's husband, remember the time when he was just Harry Potter, a fucking idiot who'd nearly killed Draco. But then he remembered that he was most certainly not keeping his love for Draco—the best thing that's ever happened to him, a secret, so they were bound to know sooner or later and hate Harry forever. Harry laughed self-deprecatingly a little, because they'd hate him for having feelings for Draco, imagine what they would do if they knew that Harry had done more than just pine for him and ask for a divorce immediately after understanding his feelings. Nope. No, sir, Harry was not going to imagine how Ron would react if he were to know that Harry spent the day idly in bed—also his sister's bed—with Draco Malfoy.
His memories with her became inaccessible. Like if he couldn't remember which particular canine she had that was crooked—
than long hair and a pretty face. Draco Malfoy was a father, a husband, a friend, a son, an asshole, a bully, a-not-very-good-Death-Eater. He loved Astoria, loved Scorpius and Theo, took care of Greg, and secretly, although it wasn't much of a secret since they all knew, thought of Pansy as a Dangerous Femme Fatale To Never Ever Be Crossed. He loved Narcissa and Lucius and thought Blaise was a dickless dick but he was
Draco shoved him away but Harry wouldn't be deterred, he clung to Draco again and stuck his face to the side of Draco's. Draco stopped resisting and let him, concentrating on the movie where shit was finally going down and unraveling.
-"Maybe now, but you won't always feel like this, you will eventually want more, and I don't have anything to give. I don't want to ruin your life, not like I'd ruined Theo's. Not like...Not like, like Astoria had ruined mine."
to, he carelessly invited Draco over for movie days, at least three times a week. Sometimes even Scorpius would join them and Harry would feel so at-ease, so happy, so warm all over...
Draco tried it. His eyes widened and Harry knew if not for his refined mannerisms and upbringing he'd wolf the entire thing down. But as it was, Draco ostentatiously nibbled at it.
An interesting, yet terrible thing about grief—Complicated Grief, for there were different types of grief, was how utterly debilitating it could be. So harrowingly agonizing and persistent in it's pain-infliction that there could never be hope for the sun to rise and shine in the horizon of the bereaved individual. And perhaps for the best, because hadn't the sun killed Icarus? What was so great about 'moving on'? It wasn't possible! How could one ever get used to the hollowing absence? How could Draco, ever, hope to wake up one day not thinking of
—seconds in Harry's opinion, cupped Malfoy's face and shamelessly kissed both his cheeks and forehead. He'd then proceeded to scoop up a gleeful Scorpius in his arms, boisterously spinning him around, and sitting down with him on his lap. Whereupon he'd thrown a possessive arm around Malfoy's shoulders, glanced at Harry, turned around and proceeded to nod in greeting at Zabini and Bulstrode, who'd smirked and started conversing together like nothing just fucking happened. Harry had fled, catching a farther seated Hermione's confused eye on his way out of the cafeteria. She'd had Rose with her and he hadn't even said Hi. Fuck.
Draco willed himself to stop fucking crying in front of his son. But he might as well demanded his body stop breathing. He did the second best thing and crouched down in front of his son, pulled Scorpius into his arms and clung to him with everything he had.
-"Draco?" Harry said, crawling in bed behind Draco and poking his head over Draco's shoulder to watch his face. Draco was scowling but thankfully not crying.
Oh, but no matter what. Draco would enjoy this. Because Potter was a lot of things, but not cruel - he must be unaware of Astoria's...
Hadn't Draco, unbeknownst to his late, traitorous 'friend' Vincent Crabb, bought time for Potter's friends to catch up with them in the room of hidden things, by rambling, so they'd effectively undermine's Crabb's plans of hurting Potter? When he didn't even know that Dumbledore had entrusted Potter with the only way to defeat The Dark Lord! He'd done it out of the pure goodness of his heart.
and vehemently demanded to shampoo and brush my hair, Theo. It was days ago. You've been doing it everyday since!" Draco said, throwing his arms in the air in exasperation.
-"Oh my, it's Jack! He's alive! Remember Jack? I told you about him. He was the hero of the movie Pansy took us to '
Harry jumped to his feet and rubbed a hand over his face. He should calm down, lest he drive Draco away and fuck everything up. After all, Draco hadn't made him any promises.
Unlike Theodore, I do not believe that you 'fooled' us all somehow in an effort to exact some morbid revenge over wrongs my son had done you, years ago.
Nothing got through the walls of his depression. He didn't know what day it was, in fact, he could no longer grasp the concept of time, nor that of space for that matter. And he didn't even care. It was all extraneous to him. What did it matter, when Astoria was fucking dead?
-"Theo, dearest. You can never resist that doe-eyed look, just hurry up and let him go." Zabini said.
-"For me, for my friends, for my family, my housemates. We've all fought in our own ways for what we thought was right, for the people we love. We all did what we had to do. You're not better than me, Potter. You're no better than anyone, quite the opposite actually. At least I have never pretended to be someone I wasn't."
away from Draco. They'd loved each other, literally, like there was no tomorrow. Draco knew there were too many people on earth for them to stand out but he also knew that what they'd had was otherworldly, inconceivable love. The omnipotent thing that had created all this shit, surly would have noticed their unique and pure,
The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was... white-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar... he wanted it to end... to black out... to die. He was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed since he'd suffered the Cruciatus curse at Voldemort's hands all those years ago.
What did she fear? Did she have to leave again? Was she scared to leave him again? Will she leave without him again?
Lucius Malfoy would never grant him unrestricted clearance to access his property. So Harry would need to beg to be let in. And beg he did.
"I wish...I wish—Oh, Merlin. I wish I loved her sooner. I wish The Dark Lord had won. I wish I'd been a better Death Eater. I wish I'd killed you when I had the chance. He could have saved her. You of all people know he could. You of all people know his power. No one was a match to him. No one came even close. You know that it was his own arrogance that killed him. No magic could surpass his own. He could have saved her if only I'd loved her sooner, if only I'd had it in me to kill you. He would have done it. I know he would have. In his own sick twisted way, he cared for me—"
-"What?" Harry interrupted. He was confused. So confused. Dread formed a lump in his throat that made it hard to breathe.
Harry sighed and grabbed Draco's hand. It was pale, soft and slender, unthinkingly, Harry brought it to his lips and kissed it—Draco wrenched his hand out of Harry's hold, pushed him away and stood up.
Harry tickled Scorpius until he announced Harry being his third child. Rose and Draco giggled and protested on the grounds that Harry's hair was raven-black and therefore could not be related to any of them, Harry begrudgingly let a mischievously delighted Draco turn his hair a light orangy-brown. Harry must've looked ridiculous judging by Draco's uncontrollable fit of laughter. Harry fell in love with him even more. Which was astounding, for Harry felt that every cell in his body sang a perpetual, beautiful, unearthly chant, of his unequivocal love and devastating yearning for Draco Lucius Malfoy.
love was doomed to be one-sided. He was in for a life of painful yearning and unsubstantiated but diligent hope.
Draco was sure Blaise and Scorpius had already left. He stood still for a while, unsure whether to go home or...He knew what he wanted. What he craved. Alcohol. He wanted to get shit-faced, drown his sorrows in liquor. He hadn't been drunk since the funeral. Theo wouldn't let him anywhere near alcohol alone, worried Draco would develop a dependency, rely on it too much to numb the pain, and end up an alcoholic.
Draco's heart would squeeze and writhe, he would feel like his diaphragm was restricting his lungs' movement. He'd be unable to fucking breathe. It was painful, more so because it happened in front of Scorpius, who'd watch his beloved father hyperventilate, thinking he'd caused his father pain by slipping and mentioning his
Because even if Ron were to forgive him and promise never to tell her - it wouldn't be anytime soon. For it was obvious Ron was doing this for his Sister and the child's sake. Ginny couldn't be upset, because then what would happen to the child?
muggle coat that Pansy forced him to wear—made him stand out. Draco felt a bit better at the attention, it made him forget for a while that his wife was dead, he was depressed, he fucked his best friend's life, he wished he were dead—and here we go. Now he was back to thinking about those things.
-"AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE FOR YOU!  AFTER ALL THESE YEARS! THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY US????? YOU CHEAT ON MY FUCKING SISTER??????!!!!"
As the party progressed, and the afternoon's warm breeze turned into refreshingly chilly, gentle wind, Harry Potter realized that Heaven
and had been noticeably nicer to Harry ever since. Like Kreacher approved of Harry's choice of paramour greatly.
He nevertheless wished for a quick death, waited a few seconds, when nothing happened, he promptly started speaking, with a toneless, flat voice.
You must understand that you'd left Draco waiting for your news, then scared you'd really left him like he'd foreseen, then heartbroken when it was clear you weren't coming back.
Draco Malfoy, followed swiftly by Theo Nott, stepped out of one of the ministry's fireplaces to find himself in the fully-packed familiar atrium. Pansy was already there, holding Scorpius up in her arms so he wouldn't feel overwhelmed with his small frame and height by the hundreds of people. Draco took him from her, held him close, kissed his nose and smiled brightly at him.
-"Language!" Scorpius said. "Oh, hey, Harry! Daddy say you a evil, unicorn-hater and that I should not tell you he cry because he miss you." Scorpius said.
No one seemed to care that Nott was gobbling down Draco's mouth three feet from them and proceeded to talk amongst themselves like Harry wasn't there. At least Draco seemed as surprised as Harry from how his eyes had widened at the first contact before he hummed and closed them, but certainly not as enraged.
After some time, they went in, found that Lucius and Narcissa had retired for the night, and joined—reluctantly on Harry's part—the younger evil Slytherins; they got drunk, and in their inebriated state, introduced Harry to their favorite spot which was a lovely sunroom that held a pretty but uncomfortable-looking, long chaise-lounge that they all quite literally
-"I am cursed, ladies and gentlemen, a heinous, cruel curse! Everyone loves me! It is very tiring indeed to be the center of everyone's world; to have admirers screaming their undying devotion and love at every turn, every corner; to have unparalleled beauty that breaks hearts, creates conflicts and discrepancy, engenders war! My beauty and grace have ruined lives! Oh, Salazar, however will I survive? I am but a dainty, exquisite flower in the vast, hostile desert." Draco said, sniffing theatrically, feigning distress.
He immediately pushed himself away and latched onto Draco, wrapping his arms around Draco's middle, effectively trapping him in his hold, Preventing him from disapparating without Harry.
of it, involved kissing every inch of Draco's face. Scorpius was laughing delightedly between kisses, Theo had a small smile on too.
well. Not the precise shade of her brown eyes, nor the feel of her hair in his hands, not the cadence of her voice.
He was met with a cloudless, dark-blue sky, a few stars here and there, glittering like Astoria's diamond-rings, muggles running around to Merlin knows where. Draco sighed, watched his breath condense and disperse away, the chilly late-February cold prickled his skin making his cheeks pink, he subtly cast a warming spell on his person. But no one was paying him any attention, they were all hurrying with their heads down looking at the tiny muggle telephones like the one Pansy had. It was a good thing Pansy was so much into muggles these days because it meant she made him carry muggle money around, and encouraged him—
the help of Tom Riddle, an astoundingly puissant man, could easily undermine? Hadn't Dumbledore wanted the same thing with Grindelwald? Abraxas was a young man who had no way of knowing, not in a million-years, what getting involved with Tom Riddle—for
-"Greg, dearest, you have nothing to worry about, we've all seen the impressive snake in your pants." Pansy said.
Draco sighed, faced with Nott's smile and loving gaze, the tears had stopped, but fresh tears glistened in Draco's eyes now.
Harry still held Draco in his arms. He wouldn't release Draco while he wasn't objecting. Harry would take whatever Draco offered, anything at all, hold it close, soak it up, relish in it while it lasted. It was becoming clear to Harry that he could never let Draco go, or be the one to let go of him, tell him No. If Harry's future didn't include Draco, it would only be because he didn't have one. Only death would keep Harry away from him. Perhaps, even—if Harry had been guilty of some unnameable, ghastly, sinful monstrosity in some other life and was punished for it in this one—if Draco were to explicitly tell Harry to fuck off his life for good, Harry wasn't sure he'd be able to.
Théo's eyes were closed tightly, whatever he was saying, was uttered reverently. His fear and anguish were clear on his pale face. Draco's heart clenched in guilt and love. But he couldn't do more, for he was extremely fatigued. He yearned to comfort Theo, erase that sorrowful and disheartened expression from his dear features, to promise Theo that he was okay, that he was going to be okey. Draco knew that was literally
Molly Weasley spotted Harry through the tears in her eyes, she smiled, if possible, even wider at the sight of him.
Draco stood up from his seat and moved to sit on the desk, right in front of Harry. He was close. So close, Harry could smell his intoxicating fragrance, sweet, lush and fruity but Harry didn't have the presence of mind to accurately identify it.
spacious. Every surface was covered with gleaming black-marble, portraits of blond-headed ancestors lined the walls. Expensive-looking and ancient tapestries were everywhere, as were statues of Salazar Slytherin and Merlin, their respective names engraved upon each of them. A long, dark-green and silver-embroidered carpet under their feet. Even the fucking carpet seemed to mock and belittle Harry, giving off an air of self-importance and pomposity, as if it were a sad day indeed that an inferior filthy creature like Harry would dare walk on it. But Harry didn't get too far, when a giant envelope came soaring through the air until it stopped, floating in front of Harry's face. It exploded loudly into a dozen tiny little envelopes. Harry upon sensing the explosion, irrationally and instinctively moved in front of Draco, effectively shielding him with his body.
thing, assure him, that Draco would never, come hell or high water, lie to Theo, withhold the truth from him, ever-again.
So Harry Potter was quite happily lying horizontally on the sofa, his head on Draco's lap, watching Draco instead of the movie.
-"How the fudge does she know he's an unspeakable? Isn't that like top secret, classified shi—stuff? Wait. Is he?
Theodore sat by his side on the bed and smoothed his long, pale hair out of his eyes, tucked white, thick strands behind his ear, caressed his cheeks, kissed his forehead.
In Scorpius's huge, colorful room in Malfoy Manor, Draco was cuddling with his son. Draco held him tighter, kissed his head, stroking his soft, platinum-blond hair, that's identical except in length to his own. Draco suspected Scorpius was sleeping.
-"Really? Okey. That makes me feel better. But I still hate myself for it. But I'd do it again. Oh Merlin, what the fuck!"
Draco felt a bit irritated at being ordered around by a lowly muggle—his eyes instantly started prickling with tears.
But the fucking bastards were all leaving already. Theo included. He seemed amused, the treacherous bastard. They closed the doors behind them.
-"Harry! Oh, son, you're going to be a father!" She held out her arm indicating Harry should come closer - she hugged them both tightly and cried. Tears of joy.
an act. Harry. . .he, he couldn't deny him. Anything. Ever. Harry Potter was doubtless that there would never be a day where he could tell Draco Malfoy
-"Who's your friend?" Emma asked when Draco didn't introduce Theo. Harry was marginally pissed because she hadn't asked Draco to introduce
-"Hmm, how peculiar. Theo, dearest, was it you? I could have sworn someone had thought Italy a giant lake because they were as stupid as they were unloved."
-"What? Why? I mean, yeah, I get it, you guys are fancy and whatnot. But my clothes aren't that awful. I have the robe I wore for my wedding, wouldn't that work? It was quite expensive."
-"You dare look at me like that, Potter. You dare pity me, feel sorry for me when you'd slit my chest open and left me bleeding out? I will not be pitied by an insignificant, irrelevant excuse of a man. Our savior," Draco shouted, snickered humorlessly and wickedly, "More like 'a pig raised for slaughter' the one
-"Oh, Draco, I'm scared. My heart is beating but one day it won't and I'm scared. I hate it. I can't leave you, I can't leave you, I can't leave Scorpius. Oh, my Son, my baby needs me. You need me. I'm going to die."
that Harry was in love with Draco, who's one of them. They were relishing in the knowledge that they owned Harry now, since they owned Draco. They would use Harry, walk all over him, while he does
Harry kissed him, to shut him up, to shut himself up, to make him understand why he'd followed, why he was there, why he'd always be—the moment Draco registered what was happening he shoved Harry violently away.
happened in the past two weeks. You refused to entertain the notion at all, it didn't work out. You thought about it fleetingly and proceeded to vehemently deny it, it didn't work out. You missed me, which didn't help your denial at all, so you thought about it a bit, tried to find a reason you
"Him and Astoria had even made me promise not to make a portrait of her. They both knew I'd go mad hearing her voice, talking to her, but never being able to touch her, be with her." He closed his eyes. Guilt clearly eating at him.
Théo sensed Draco hesitating over saying something else so he turned him around in his arms, tucked Draco's head under his chin, wrapped an arm around Draco's waist, stroking Draco's hair with his free hand. He kissed Draco's hair, temple, ear. And waited.
-"Well, well, I must admit Potter, I didn't think you had it in you. I mean I knew you were a two-faced, sanctimonious hypocrite but I didn't think you'd actually act on your
He patted Potter's shoulder patronizingly and said, "It's okey, Potter. I'm irresistible. I was already irresistible and now I have the whole sad widower thing going on. It's sexy."
Harry felt as if they were all mocking him, brutally yet unknowingly, finding joy in Harry's misfortune.
As he drank his muggle whiskey that wasn't really bad at all, although different from firewhiskey, he thought of Scorpius.
So, at this point, Draco didn't—would never, at this rate—want anyone to know that the pain, in fact, felt rampantly worse than when it did during the first blurry first weeks, when Draco had retreated inside his own mind like a wounded animal curled around its battered body, its survival instincts irrationally desperate to keep it alive when the right thing to do would have been administering a coup de grâce rather than the certain life of pain and trauma the poor animal would wind up leading otherwise.
Sometime later, Draco finished his cake and set the plate aside on the nightstand, Jack/Leo or Teddy Daniels in this movie was presently suspecting everyone and everything as were Harry and Draco.
. Ceased to exist! She was nowhere! Fucking nowhere! The thought that they could both be reborn and meet again was comforting but too idealistic, as was the thought that she hadn't just vanished but merely moved on somewhere nice, watching over her family, waiting to be reunited with them someday but not too soon, for Scorpius was just a small child—Draco could not bring himself to believe any of this. His depression and grief wouldn't let him. He didn't care for any of this anyways, Hell or nowhere, Draco just wanted to be with
-"I perfectly speak Italian, darling. Why, we have a Manor quite similar to this one in Florence. We've been there when you were all children, don't you remember, darling?"
out of his fellow deranged aurors! Unheard of! Impossible! Alarmed, Harry stood up to check out where the danger was coming from, he'd gather people around and run in the other direction, or fight the danger if need be. . . Except it wasn't the sight of a three-eyed, one-legged, greenish, blind troll—wait what?— that greeted him. No. It was Draco.
Harry smiled because they were all actually making progress and had been almost civil to Harry during his quite extended stay at their home—Even Zabini!—Harry picked up Draco's left arm and pushed the sleeve up to his elbow, baring his indelible but mostly-faded Dark Mark, he didn't feel disgust, nor fear at the sight of it, he felt pained for that younger Draco who'd had no choice but to take it. Harry used to hate that Draco, who'd bullied him for years, but now he loved him, loved all versions of Draco, younger and older, and he would - Always. So, he held Draco's arm close to his face and peppered his Dark Mark with soft kisses.
Thankfully, Kreacher had made a nice breakfast, even nicer than usual, just like when Ginny was around, which was odd, had Kreacher seen his miserable state and pitied him enough to bake him his favorite food, treacle tart? He even made bacon and eggs! Wow, Harry must've looked as bad as he felt for Kreacher to do something nice for him.
The next morning Harry Potter didn't even check in with his own department. He came in early, Ginny hadn't liked that, and lurked around the Floo-network until he made sure he saw Draco and Scorpius stepping out of a fireplace. He then went to the cafeteria to kill time, he was very nervous and impatient because he was finally going to talk to Draco.
-"It was something I'd received after she died. It's a poem. I think she'd had the Owl Postal Service send it upon her death. Pansy had mentioned it and we found out she'd owled it to everyone but you. I suppose it's intended to make one feel hopeful in the face of bereavement but she knew better than to give it to you. Eloquently expressive words of consolation on paper could do nothing but anger you. It dawned on me earlier and I couldn't help but repeat it." Theo said, his voice nighttime low, he smiled and kissed the top of Draco's head.
-"To buy you new clothes of course. You can't show up at a formal dinner with the rags you wear everyday. I hardly have the time to change your entire wardrobe, but I'll definitely get to that later, so a new wizard-robe will have to do."
. Everyone knew. He also knew, that the normal course of action would be to seek a mind healer's help. But Draco also knew what that help would entail. He was already taking calming draughts and sleeping potions, occasionally, because Theo wouldn't let him, since they were highly addictive.
. A child! They'd been through a war together, came out of it together, traumatized, grieving, young—They'd latched onto each other for support, comfort, soothing words, help, commiseration...But they'd mistaken it for love. Being
-"I'd fallen in love with him when we were in Hogwarts. But we'd been teenagers and didn't know that we both felt the same—we'd missed our chance. After the war, I'd gotten to know her. . .And here we are. If I could go back in time I'd love
I mean, they obviously did stuff but monotonous things. The most fun they get is with Goblins because they're assholes and hate us mortals."
Harry didn't really have anything to say to that. There was no misinterpreting the position they'd found them in.
-"See? do you see what I was telling you, Draco? He literally brings it up all the time. I thought I made him feel guilty and contrite. I thought he'd be self-recriminating and seeking penance, but fucking look at him! Im sure he cries to sleep, but
-"I feel like organizing a party, now. That bitch Pansy will try to outshine me, though. So I need at least a few months to decide on what to wear and only mention that I'm hosting a party a couple of weeks before it, so she wouldn't have enough time to do shit."
Nevertheless, Harry's irritation and outrage at Nott's narcissism and assholery helped him, if nothing else, keep the tears at bay.
Draco had no doubt he'd have to go through this again. But he was glad Scorpius wasn't crying. Otherwise he'd have gone straight back to the merciless depths of the dark fog. because the fog hadn't disappeared. Draco suspected it never will.
-"I love him. Théo is my 'in another life' person. You know what I mean?" Draco mumbled against Harry's auror robes.
They've known each other as small children, walked this exact, same path multiple times, laughing, talking, singing - this time felt different. Because Astoria's dead, and Draco wished he were.
-"Theo. Please. We've just been talking about how this is the new me now. Potter was just being his usual presumptuous self. He apologized to me about the party and you know how stupid that is because he nearly killed me when we were younger. So I felt a bit annoyed at him and his audacity and just that little bit of feeling exhausted me, so, I just found somewhere empty and cried a bit."
Draco stared at him some more, sighed miserably, Harry's heart squeezed excruciatingly in his chest, thinking he'd finally pushed too far and Draco had reached his limit. He didn't owe Harry anything, Harry had nearly killed him, had been awful to him back at school, Draco was going to leave him for good, marry Nott and travel the world, eventually settle in Italy and—Draco moved in two quick steps and stood in front of Harry, so close, the tips of their shoes touching. He cupped Harry's cheeks in his hands and peered up at him with warm, sad eyes full of concern. Harry was stunned. For him?
Blaise, the uncouth fucker, grumbled loudly, kicked Draco's calf and, stuck his stupid head under a pillow.
Those were Draco Malfoy's exact words to Dumbledore before his death. Yet, despite it all, Draco hadn't been able to kill him. Even if it meant
-"No. No. It makes sense, Pansy. Just take a moment and try to understand. Just try, okey? Please. She's not dead. Where's Greg? She's with him. They're together. Greg always loved her more. I was his friend first but living together back home in France made them closer. He was a mess after Vincent, you remember that? she fixed him. She fixed him, like she fixed me. Is something wrong with Greg? Did he fuck up? I'm sure he went to her for help. I won't get mad just say it. Please, whatever it is I can help. I'll do anything. Please. I love—"
-"You've only got yourself to blame, Potter. We were all minding our own business till you burst in screaming your undying love and devotion to me."
. It hurts, I won't lie, but I think it would kill me more to not have you at all...I love you. A lot. More than I ever thought possible. Please."
Théo felt a sharp pang of pain in his chest. Because Draco would have never shown weakness to his son. His own father had been larger than life in his eyes, always there for Draco to lean on him, to learn from him, to childishly imitate him. So, during the war when The Dark Lord had treated Lucius like he was lesser than vermin - It had been a shocking and heart-wrenching thing to see.
him—Oh, Blaise, you ruined my life. You ruined both our lives. I loved him first and he loved me first. None of this would have happened. But it did. And I'm not
Ron moved in two quick strides across the distance between them and shoved Harry violently, he lost his balance and fell down on the hard floor.
-"YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, YOU SELFISH WORTHLESS DEATH EATER SCUM!" Harry shouted, sounding deranged, perhaps he was, because that was not what he'd been thinking at
-"Yes, well. You see now why I'm desperate enough to want to spend time with someone like you." Harry mumbled.
Nott. "Theo takes care of me like you wouldn't believe, yet I've still managed to fuck up and get involved with Emma."
Pansy and Blaise flooed to their respective houses to get dressed—which was stupid because they've all (except Blaise) been practically living together back in France and were doing the same now in Malfoy Manor (with the addition of Blaise) but Draco figured that all of their clothes combined was
So Harry waited a little, and pulled out his trusty, old invisibility cloak, he hid underneath it, and followed Malfoy.
-"I can give you this," Draco said, waving his hand in clear indication of his body, "But never, this." He touched his fingers to his heart, "This is
Harry entered the huge department and walked for a little while to Hermione's office, she'd said Draco's was right next to hers, directly in front of the children's playroom. Not that Harry cares. Fuck. Malfoy was standing right there, leaning gracefully on the door frame, talking to the kids. He wasn't whispering. His pale, blond strands were cascading down his shoulders, they were thick, shiny, lush, Luscious—where the bloody fuck did that come from? Probably out of envy, since unlike Malfoy, Harry had an unruly mop on his head. But he was so incongruous, so conspicuous, so different, so enthralling—Harry walked up to him and tapped him on the shoulder, accidentally brushing his fingers against Draco's hair. Harry couldn't help but gasp at its otherworldliness. It was so much better up close, Harry wished he could properly touch it, run his fingers through it—and then he remembered it was
My client, Mr. Malfoy, had been nothing short of a perfect citizen for twelve-years! Unsubstantiated allegations that he'd been with the people who'd tortured muggles in the Quidditch World cup, notwithstanding—There's nothing but specious claims against Lucius Malfoy before 1992, when he'd—unknowingly by Dumbledore's very own words—implanted a Horcrux in Hogwarts. I urge you to think for a moment about the life my client had been leading up until then - a life of utter terror, waiting for the other shoe to drop, knowing The Dark Lord was alive, somewhere, biding his time to strike again. So when he'd heard that The Dark Lord had made an attempt at stealing the philosopher's stone by june 1991, and not only that, but that he'd managed to recruit help in his pitiful, incorporeal state, he'd wisely feared the worst. He'd known then, that it was only a matter of time when someone else would help The Dark Lord succeed and rise back. He'd also known it would have to be him if he wanted to save his family from The Dark Lord's impending wrath. He'd made a half-hearted try in 1992, failed, and hadn't tried again, hoping against all hope that The Dark Lord wouldn't come back. But he did. And he'd punished them all. Enslaved them in their own home, treated them like vermin, tortured them, but above all, he'd forced sixteen-year old Draco to be the youngest Death Eater in the ranks. A child! Do you remember your lives at sixteen? Had the darkest, most powerful psychopath in the world tasked you with killing the other most powerful wizard in his own terrain? Had your mother been tortured in front of you? Had you been forced to Crucio your own father, because
Harry Potter was lazily walking down to the ministry's cafeteria. The food was dreadful and the same as always. Everything was monotonous. He was slowly wasting away. He'd thought he'd be diligently fighting crime as an auror. But nothing ever happens. Literally nothing. He does no field work, no paperwork, he just drags himself to work everyday in the morning, same as everyone else on the off-chance something would happen. Whenever he felt too fucking lazy to aimlessly go to work again and decided to stay in, something mildly interesting would happen and he naturally wouldn't get the case. It always fucking happened. He was hungry but he really didn't want to see Hermione. She'd ask him why he didn't come to Sunday dinner at the Weasleys again. He'd already told her, it wasn't the same without his wife, ginny. She was out of the country. She was always out of the country, because of her job as the Holyhead Harpies's chaser. Harry didn't want to go and have Molly Weasley, whom he very much loved, to start fussing over him and saying how he was too skinny and looking at him with pitying eyes, thinking he was simply lonely because he missed ginny. He did miss ginny. But he was lonely even if she was around. Maybe even more lonely with her—He quickly pushed those thoughts away. Ugh. He'd have to suck it up and go face Hermione. He was starving and she always made him lunch.
-"Gryffindor." Draco said. It wasn't an insult and Draco's tone didn't imply he meant it as one, but it felt like an insult all the same.
, father's friend from work that also lived nearby. No, no, Alex's mom! Didn't Oncle Theo remember her? How about Draco? How could they all not recall her name? So odd! Mommy would surely—
-"Yeah. It was the year of the Triwizard tournament, I'd bullied you even more that year. Remember the badges? I'd been anxious all the time, ranting about Saint-Potter more so than usual. So everyone had helpfully pointed out that it was probably because I was scared you'd get hurt and that I might even fancy you a little."
He never went back for another visit at the Weasleys, avoided Ron and pretended to be busy so as not to spend a moment more than was necessary to not raise suspicions with Ginny.
, fitting. Just like Draco didn't want strangers—most importantly, Scorpius, to get an inkling of the torment inside him and get hurt.
After a few minutes Draco nudged Harry away from him, but Draco was presently so malleable, he didn't fight it when Harry only hugged him closer.
He doubled over, and screamed. But no sound came out of his throat. He barely felt real. He didn't feel the ground beneath his feet. He didn't feel like he was breathing, and yet, he must be, because if there was one thing he knew for sure - it was the almost as painful fact that he wasn't dead. And that he couldn't end his own misery, because he had a son.
-"I'm really tired, mother. I'll come back home tomorrow. He'll be asking about me, he might even remember me crying—I can't have him thinking he'd upset me." Draco murmured. He seemed to be struggling with forming coherent thoughts let alone speaking.
Harry saw red. His teeth and fists clenched tight. His heart pounding rapidly. Harry was vibrating in his seat. He wanted to lunge at Lucius and throttle him. Fuck this. This was all kinds of wrong. Harry would give them all a piece of his mind and fuck off for good. He should have never come to the snakes' lair, what on earth had possessed him to—Draco.
-"Yeah, this way." They walked off towards an empty office, Harry closed the door and smiled in anticipation at Draco.
'I'll make sure, you never see him again.' Had a double entendre, but Harry knew that Theo meant he would disappear with Draco, rather than kill Harry, for they all knew Harry's life meant very little to him when it came to Draco. So he would just watch him from afar and will his body not to give out and fucking die as it so harrowingly felt like it was doing.
, because she'd smiled so big at Harry, genuinely happy to see him, because ginny was his friend and he'd promised her forever.
-"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'd been really worried about them and now I know I needn't worried because they'd been having fun and had apparently forgotten that I was having daily meltdowns just two floors up."
-"Are we really doing this again? We kiss all the time! And stop pretending like every kiss is our first! In fact, I vividly recall our first kiss - you devouring my mouth, right before my own fucking wedding had begun! But don't normalize kissing me. I will not suffer through Pansy's sticky, disgusting, lipglossed kisses more than strictly necessary which means only on Christmas, New year, and our respective birthdays."
-"What the hell! What happened to you? You've been spending too much time with that Jealous cow, Pansy. I am a sight for sore eyes, and should be spoken to accordingly! Besides, it's rich coming from someone who's literally
After a miserable weekend when Hermione had adamantly refused to let him weasel out of another Weasely Sunday Family Lunch, where he'd felt so guilty, faced with Molly's loving coddling and Arthur's insistence on knowing what
Theo Nott watched helplessly Draco's open, yet, unseeing eyes. And thought he'd never felt as small or as scared in his life. Draco shivered, and Theo cast a warming spell on him and held him tighter. Later, he'd make him drink a replenishing potion and maybe manage to make him swallow some food.
Ron punched him in the face. People around them gasped. The auror department was a joke and no one was coming to Harry's rescue. Harry closed his eyes, surrendering to his fate.
of the exquisitely gastronomic dishes that he'd been served, obviously done on purpose to further underscore his lowly origins, Harry was feeling quite full, but he didn't want to risk breaking the merciful silence by not touching his plate and having them mock him in some way. they'd refrained from criticizing him and merely glared at him, noses wrinkled up and similar frowns on most of their faces (Except Draco, Scorpius and Narcissa) regarding him disapprovingly, disgusted.
-"Fudging hell. We're mad. All of us." Pansy said. She held out a hand for Scorpius, he grabbed it. "Except you, Scorpius, darling. You look positively dashing. Will you do me the greatest honor of all, and be my date?" She crooned.
Hermione seemed greatly amused. Like she was actually having a good time around Slytherins - her teenage-years' torturers.
-"For fuck's sake how are you still alive? It should be impossible! You're a literal imbecile." Draco said.
Draco regarded him carefully and smiled wistfully in understanding, he then patted the sofa indicating Harry should join him.
Harry opened his eyes and watched the entire Slytherin Gang bickering amidst the stupidly gawking crowds. Ron too, had his fist raised mid-punch while gaping, wide-eyed at them. They were, as always, looking extremely hot, conspicuous and intimidating.
Harry felt really bad. What had he been thinking? He hadn't been, that's why this was happening to begin with! Draco was so sensitive and adorable. Harry swooned and wondered if his pupils were reshaping into little hearts.
And not only that but Harry hadn't known—never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that a human being could feel so much for another. But now, now he knows. He understands. And what's killing him, isn't the fact that he'd been leading the wrong life all along. No. What was killing Harry, truly, fucking killing him, butchering his insides, was the fact that Harry's love was unquestionably unrequited. Harry's one
Harry Potter felt guilty. Horrified. Shocked. And a hell of a lot curious about Draco Lucius Malfoy.
Harry, in that moment, truly chose Draco, over his own mother, his principles, his wife, family, everything that made him who he was. Except, in a way, by choosing Draco, Harry was essentially choosing his own happiness. By choosing Draco, he was choosing himself. No longer Dumbledore's martyr like Parkison said. His mother was long dead. Being near Draco was all Harry desired in life. So he chose
Yet, depression, in its most basic form - is a part of oneself hurting the rest along with itself. Why is that? Draco thought. But the thought quickly slipped away in the grey omnipresent haze that was Draco's existence - numbness, his friend in the dark, seemingly eternal captivity, receded for him to succumb to the fluctuating ache that was his other friend. Why? What was he imprisoned for? Whatever it was. Draco wished he were dead.
When it was time to leave, Harry's pain was clogging up his throat, he couldn't breathe let alone talk. Why? Why him?
Draco sighed too in contentment, yawned in fatigue and asked what he was wondering about for awhile.
-"How's Nott okey with any of this? With Astoria, with. . . I suppose, with me? He loves you, he's in love with you, it's as clear as day."
, like Harry wasn't there, like he didn't matter, he'd call for Nott, jump in Nott's arms. Never in Harry's. Never Harry.
Draco decided to go with the Muggle approach Greg adopted. It was admittedly better than: I don't know where the fuck she is, but wherever it is, I want to be there too.
Draco was vibrating with anticipation. He didn't miss his son in the fog. He didn't have a son there. So, Draco was
from shock, probably even panting loudly, but Malfoy was lost to this world and didn't hear him. He didn't seem like he even knew where he was anymore. Whatever was wrong with him—a dumb, blind and dead troll would know it wasn't what just happened between them—was some soul-obliterating, all-encompassing fucked up shit.
They were in the company of Blaise and Pansy at The Nott Estate. Theo's father had left the country soon after the war and never looked back - the condition whereby he was amnestied. Unlike Draco and Lucius who ironically
-"This is for your own good too. You don't see anything beyond Draco when he's like this. You'll burn out." Blaise said.
Harry inhaled Draco's intoxicating scent and refused to exhale it until Draco asked him why the fuck he wasn't breathing.
Zabini smirked. Which seemed to be the only other facial expression he was capable of, along with sneering in disdain.
It all came rushing back to him; an involuntary loud gasp escaped his lips, the cold fresh air almost burned his lungs upon entry. He opened his eyes, and endeavored to assess the situation. The warmth, was from Theo's body, completely and securely surrounding him, lying almost half atop Draco, Théo's arm under Draco's head, his other arm wrapped tightly around Draco's abdomen, one of Théo's legs encasing Draco's. Théo's face pressed to Draco's. Theo was rocking him back and forth and murmuring a string of words Draco hadn't been able to make out earlier. How had none of this sunk in? He must've scared Theo shitless.
he'd just said. But Draco couldn't bring himself to care enough to try and decipher Potter's little speech. He was
-"What's wrong? Are you worried about tomorrow's dinner? I'll be there too. And you'll just have to bear it for me, otherwise Father says I can't see you again. And I never disobey Father."
He was shaking. Shaking badly. Tears. Damned tears, always, hot and persistent, spilling from his grey forlorn eyes. Why shouldn't he? Why should he be stronger? How can he? Astoria deserves to be missed and mourned. Astoria's loss should have devastated the fucking world. Stopped time. Frozen the sun. Yet, it didn't. It fucking didn't. Draco owed her this. He owed her being devastated and ruined. Draco wanted the pain. All of it. She deserved to leave an impact on the world. She deserved to be grieved and lamented. She deserved to never be forgotten. Never be moved on from. She deserved to—she deserved to fucking
-"I'm not in the habit of making important decisions about my life and professional carrier while asleep. And I haven't even—"
Draco moved closer, in Harry's personal space, and Merlin, Harry really, really fancied him. Fuck. He was warm and smelled so good.
After the incident in the ministry, Draco Malfoy's days formed a pattern, where in no particular order, he would be - sometimes feeling a bone deep fatigue. It wasn't truly physical, yet, it felt like it. He was just so damned
Reality slapped Harry in the face, when did he start wanting things with Draco? Hadn't he been adamant and resolute about his unwillingness to let go of his current life? Draco would ruin everything, even if he loved Harry back. Harry had no one but the Weasleys. They'd never forgive him. Ron would never forgive him. Hermione, Hermione would have no choice but to side with her husband, for their child's sake.
Draco's stammered speech between sobs, ended, and he curled up in a ball on the soft, carpeted-floor and wept, howled with anguish. Screamed, cried and moaned in pain, misery. The sounds that came out of his throat were guttural, strangled, tortured. He let it all out, but
Finally, Scorpius had on a bright, yellow, tiny robe because he'd said he wanted to look like sunshine, upon hearing it, they'd all cooed and said he was already a bright beautiful ray of sunshine. Draco had, unsurprisingly,
, we made bets. This time about the outcome of this whole crush thingie, we betted on your reaction and eventual decision. But the thing is, we ended up betting on the same thing, so we decided we'd just take each other out to dinner. And here we are."
Maybe if time went by, when it was the mainstream and appropriate time to magically wake up unbothered by the death of the love of his life, Draco would go along with people's expectations and smile more, wear less gloomy colors, socialize with pureblooded acquaintances, and ex-co-workers, back in France, more. Go back to normal, at least, appear to be. It would do him a bit of good to not hear or see people's maudlin. Draco didn't want empathy either, anymore. For day after day, the pain grew stronger, the grief all-consuming, gradually, little by little yet steadily, taking over every crook and cranny in Draco's mind and soul. Everyday without
Nearby, the sound of muggle music filtered out, Draco walked towards it. He stood in front of a muggle night-club. Lovely. It was a Monday so there wasn't much of a queue outside. There was a giant muggle man standing by the entrance, he looked Draco up and down, appraising him, and nodded signaling Draco could head in.
. He saw it in her eyes - the guilt. The regret. The shame. They'd both chosen this life. She had a fucking child now. When the war had ended, Hermione hadn't been able to restore her parents' memories; Harry was a fucking orphan, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore had all died during the war. What did he have? What did both of them have left? Fresh out of war, kids still, they'd had no one but each other and the Weasleys. It hadn't been love though. Passionate love. Romantic love; maybe just as real but it wasn't the same. Harry'd had a crush on Ginny before shit hit the fan, he'd been seventeen.
Harry stared at the proffered hand and thought furiously about what the fuck to do with it! Should he shake it? Squeeze it? Kiss it?
Draco followed him out, to find Pansy leaning against the door. The cow had  probably been eavesdropping from the way she smirked.
-"But, you know, no one actually treats ex-Death-Eaters who'd been children in the war differently, anyways. It's been eight years. Unlike you, I've been to England a number of times and no one looked down on me. It could be that they just didn't recognize me anymore." He paused. "But anyways, you're used to this. You've been in the spot light since the trials. Your Father's ingenious plan to pressure the self-righteous assholes of the Wizengamot by playing the wizarding community using the media is what got us all out unscathed in the first place. Everyone loves you. Or at least teenage girls and boys do. And the rest feels sorry for you."
he'd reached a reasonable, not-too-incriminating conclusion that would let him indulge himself in everything Draco Malfoy without mental repercussions like guilt or shame.
He sent, what he hoped was a reassuring look to Theo, who seemed to be vibrating in his chair with the need to run to Draco.
-"Hmm. I'll have to ask Theo and Scorpius. Father too—actually I'll have to decide with everyone, if they don't mind, then I don't see why we shouldn't."
-"I'm so sorry, darling. But, you see, your Father wouldn't have agreed to stay. And I couldn't bear to be away from you, ever again." Blaise said sincerely.
He'd thought and thought and thought about what he should do, knew in his heart of hearts what he wanted to do—No, Harry would stay. Draco didn't love him anyways, Draco would be okey. He had his family and friends.
Their slight nicotine addiction was solely Pansy's fault. She'd made them try it with her, they'd liked it, she didn't, and resorted to it whenever they were feeling particularly shitty.
-"Yes. You're absolutely, right. Jeremy is a fucking asshole and it's really sad that he killed Jack Gatsby."
Blaise Zabini looked up at Draco. He hadn't met Draco's eyes since Greg Floo-called him from France, the morning after Astoria's passing - two days ago. Greg had Floo-called them all.
to be with him. He'd finally known what I've always felt for him, the war had ended, we'd been far away from our past yet the timing was wrong. I was married. He'd resented me for sometime, tried to fight his feelings—eventually I'd cracked and told Astoria everything. Thinking she'd leave me... She'd laughed at me and told me we hadn't been as inconspicuous and surreptitious as I'd thought. She'd told me she was glad we had each other... Because I wouldn't always have
-"Excuse you." Draco said to Theo. He put a hand against his chest and gasped dramatically. "I won't be your dirty, little secret, Theodore Nott." Draco said. "Watch this Pansy."
. What I feel for both of you isn't the same. Just as strong but not the same . . . maybe in a way it is. Ugh. We're speaking abstractly and I have depression. And you know all of this, already, Theo! Anyways, I get it, it's sometimes hard to imagine we're only twenty-six and have our entire lives ahead of us. Yet, it's true. Astoria and I, had eight years together. You and I will have a lifetime. To me, you're a best friend, a brother, a lover, I...vaguely remember you even wanting to be my mother - I don't judge. I actually do judge, a lot, especially Pansy, but not this time—We don't need a label for whatever this is. What we have can't be contained or defined in specific, inadequate words. You're everything. always have been and always will be. We'll raise Scorpius together. You won't be replacing
But it seriously wasn't so bad. Harry was content. Safe. He really did love Ginny, she was his friend, and he frankly could've been stuck with worse. And it wasn't just about Ginny, his wife didn't come alone, Ginny meant Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, meant George and Charlie and even Percy, but most importantly Ron, Ron his best friend, who was married to Hermione now. They were a family - Harry could never leave Hermione.
When they entered the atrium, Draco's animated chatter stopped abruptly. Scorpius squealed in delight and let go of Harry's hand to jump in...Nott's arms. Zabini was standing near, expression solemn and not-at-all wickedly amused. He pulled out Scorpius from Nott's arms, whispered in Scorpius's ear something that made him bounce in excitement, wave at Harry and Draco and leave with Zabini through the nearest fireplace.
-"You're locked up in here all the time. The both of you. All alone. Long time lovers, with the wife out of the picture. We hear your moans and whimpers day and night. What are you on?! Shame on you! Shame on you for denying us our rights as your best friends to watch you finally seal the deal, fill the Trifle with cream, thread the needle, lust and thrust, take a trip to Pound Town, bury the weasel, join as one, burn and melt with passion, reborn from love and cum—"
-"Oh, Merlin. Draco, I swear—Merlin, I didn't mean. . .Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. . . Oh, what an idiot! I mean me!
He stepped out of his office, the hallways dark and empty, everyone had already gone home. He walked on to the Atrium.
Suddenly, numbness encompassed Draco, he felt an incredible weariness in his very soul, a dull ache throbbing unremittingly, he ignored it.
Harry had the feeling his future was imprinted in stone and nothing Draco says could change it. He was scared of what it might bring but hoped to Merlin and every deity out there that Draco Malfoy would be part of it.
But it was fine, Harry thought. He was married. It hurt, but it was okey. It's not like Harry was serious about Draco. It was a fleeting experience of flimsy, pseudo-affection. Attraction, that's what it was. Strong, burning-hot, intense, ever-growing attraction. But simple attraction nonetheless. It would fade in time. It would. It had to. Because this wasn't leading anywhere, except to heartbreak and devastation.
-"Yessssss. His real name is Leonardo DiCaprio, apparently. And anyways the movie's all set up up-stairs, let's go. It's called: '
At the sound of Draco's gasp, Théo's eyes flew open, they were dark pools of sheer blackness but held so much love, fear, pain and sadness, for
was immortal. Although he wouldn't, his love would survive anything. Harry's love, hope, would set him ablaze, kill him, yet always, always, like a Phoenix, rebirth from its own ashes. Harry was forever cursed to be teared apart and put together. Although, he knew some parts of him would forever be blackened and dead.
She covered his hand on her arm with her own, smiling ruefully, quite a sad, little, close-lipped smile, not meant to cheer up or reassure, a smile that said, 'Im here' but was she,
He tackled Draco and somehow ended up with him on his lap, wrapped his arms tightly around Draco's waist, felt Draco hesitantly do the same to his neck, all while kissing. And Draco was kissing him back! Harry deepened the kiss and felt such unparalleled euphoria like a lowly mortal partaking in Ambrosia for the first time, knowing it would also be his last, knowing he'd never be the same again, knowing mortal food would no longer satiate his hunger.
The torment and despair radiating off him in merciless waves didn't push Theodore Nott away. Nothing ever could. He crawled on his knees to Draco and lay on top of him. Soothing him, murmuring comforting reassurances, his heart aching like there was no tomorrow, because if anything happened to Draco there might as well never be one.
-"It was a rhetorical question, Potter. Fudge off." He said, stepping into the recently opened elevators. Harry made to follow, only to be deliberately tripped by Zabini, nearly fucking falling on his face; as he caught himself with the wall's help, he heard Scorpius chide Zabini about being mean to poor Harry just because he was a bit weird, before the elevator's door closed.
When Harry went back to his—their bedroom, she was asleep, he watched her and felt nothing but excruciating, hopeless longing for Draco.
Zabini, the bane of Harry's existence, was lounging on another splendid leather sofa, smirking maliciously, not hiding his enjoyment, gloating and mocking Harry as plain as day, wearing, unsurprisingly, a dark Slytherin-green silky robe. A glass of some fancy wine Harry couldn't afford nor know the name of in his hand. He outright burst out cackling at the sight of Harry, like Harry's humiliation and lack of comfort entertained him greatly, and they
They drank a couple of glasses of champagne each. Theo picked a still sleeping Scorpius up from Draco to relieve his aching arms and cast a muffliato around him. The countdown started. Everyone yelled. Scorpius didn't even stir. Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Theo and Draco with a sleeping Scorpius between them, had a group hug when it reached midnight.
-"Do you mean about Voldemort? I guess that's a terrible thing to want but I mean, yeah, if there was anyone capable of curing your wife - it would definitely be him."
It seemed interesting enough. The heroine was quirky, the hero was broody, there was an enchanted forest and a little sister obsessed with Barbie Dolls that Rose also owned. So Harry decided on it and turned to Draco to see what he was thinking, to find him already engrossed in the story unraveling before him, everything happening on the screen being reflected in his clear grey eyes.
Everything went black and Harry experienced the familiar feel of being pressed from all directions and having his eyeballs and ears squeezed tightly.
With a confused frown on his face, Harry went past Walburga's portrait—whom Harry hadn't seen or heard from in years and assumed had given up trying to drive them out with sheer hate and disgust and was probably spending her time at other portraits, maybe if Narcissa had made one for Bellatrix—he tugged the door open.
. But now, it was all out in the open. No longer festering and rotting inside Theo, reeking with the pungent stench of decay, enveloping him, messing and interfering with his senses and his perception of the world. Now that he saw a bit clearly, he accepted and understood -Draco Malfoy was his
-"I'm sorry, you're so pretty I got distracted and just nodded. I can't fucking think when you're so close." Harry said honestly. And also because he knew Draco could never resist flattery.
He would never make references to times when they'd went out together if she'd been with them too and it was obvious it wasn't from lack of memory, for he would skirt around those tales and strictly speak of all the times in France when he'd been swimming in their private pool with Greg or how awesome it was, that one time, when he'd boarded the muggle train at night in Italy for hours with Oncle Theo on their bonding time from town to town. And did Draco remember their neighbor Alex back in France? Alex was young and tiny so his parents were the neighbors, really. Or were they
to. He would have. But he couldn't muster the energy to move. Could he even move? How? Draco had a lot of questions sometimes, but they quickly dissipated in the fog of nothingness that was his world.
-"YESSSSSSS!" Ginny screamed and hugged her Mother, who'd instantly known by some motherly-miracle that Ginny was carrying Harry's lifelong dream and worst nightmare.
Harry smiled against Draco's shoulder, he struggled with himself a moment and then surrendered to his urges and kissed it. Draco probably didn't feel it since Harry had technically kissed his clothes.
Draco Malfoy was babbling! Offering Harry a way-out even though he could carelessly use him, sounding— slightly—apologetic! Harry must really look as harrowed as he felt.
-"Well, you didn't look like you were planning on speaking anytime tonight and I have a daughter. Ron's useless, you see."
-"You fucking asshole! Its rich coming from someone who's just moved into Scorpius's room with me! You sleep in
-"It's actually quite funny. Just hear me out. I'd only found out last night while we were having dinner when I'd brought you up for coming by earlier that day. Needless to say, they were delighted to tell me all about the letters. Apparently you've been owling me about six to seven letters a day. Father, upon receiving the first letter and finding out it was from you, had immediately opened it and read it, he'd thought it pathetically hilarious and had been planning on burning it because

fancied Malfoy. And why would he? Harry was married for Merlin's sake! Crushes happened to children. It's what's gotten him in this fucking blank life in the first place—
They were all seated around the master bedroom. Théo's bedroom. Pansy was leaning against Blaise, hyperventilating, on the king-sized, dark-sheeted Bed. Everything was dark colored. The fancy furniture, the rugs, it all screamed wealth. Yet, it was insentient. It didn't know it was fancy, it didn't feel pride or vanity from its beauty, it didn't feel pain when it was broken, it didn't feel loss when replaced. It didn't
for Theo and pale grey to bring out his silver eyes for Draco, Theo wordlessly sat him down and picked up a brush for his hair. Draco smiled and kissed his cheek.
-"I'm not sure what Kreacher made, or if he made anything at all since I'm never home for lunch. Do you want me to take you out somewhere nice?"
-"Pansy, darling, you've forgotten to leave out the disappointment from your voice. We're supposed to seem quite happy about Potter's existence." Interjected Lucius maliciously.
Pansy Parkinson was dressed in a silky, long, dark-green, backless dress, with a tightly coiled, golden snake holding it together at the center of her back. Blaise Zabini was dressed, unsurprisingly in everyone's opinion, in a very tight, black, designer muggle suit. It was probably the compromise he and Pansy had settled on for his earlier insolence. The couch would have to wait for another night. Maybe even tonight, for the night was still young.
the time. It's been eight days since he resurfaced from the all-encompassing fog. And he missed it. He didn't remember much from it. Yet, he thought it must've been better than where he was now. He loved his friends, his family, above all, he loved Scorpius. But Astoria was
of this fair? How was he supposed to live on? How was he expected to move on? Draco didn't want to move on. He wouldn't move on. Never. Draco didn't want to be in pain either, he just wanted to
He felt so heavy, he was sure he'd keel over if he attempted to stand, his feet wouldn't be able to support the weight of her absence in him. The vast hollowness inside him. It was dark, empty, vacant, there was nothing there. An endless abyss. A constantly expanding pit. Everyday was the worst day he'd ever endured. There was nothing there. Because she was
He checked into the Leaky Cauldron, and slept the fucking day off. When he woke up at night, he ventured down for a couple of Butterbeers, because why the fuck not?
Harry's eyes widened and he abruptly moved away from Draco's reach. He turned his head towards the flat screen, and released an audible breath of relief. Jack was alive. Although some poor blond woman was disintegrating. He sensed another crying-session so he moved in close and gathered Draco properly in his arms. Draco didn't protest as tears were already forming in his beautiful eyes.
Draco blinked at her. He was mostly sober. Yet, still drunk on the memories Scorpius's innocent comment had stirred. He couldn't really hold a conversation while feeling the ghost of Astoria's hands in his hair. It seemed somewhat vivid and surreal. Draco didn't want it to stop. He wished moments like this would happen more often. He wished for madness so he'd never stop feeling her touch, listening to her laughter, watching her face.
defeat. Draco Malfoy dropped down unceremoniously on an obsolete chair that had certainly known better days. He gazed unseeingly at nothing. His face held an expression of
Harry hurried after him, inside the club was loud and almost uncomfortably warm compared to the outdoors.
-"Doing what? I'm not doing anything, Potter. I'm not risking anything for you, nor getting out of my way for your best interests. If anything, I'm using you. I like you, Potter. But what does it matter, when it's not what you want?—" I'll take anything you'd give me, Harry thought. "—you want to know why? Because you want something you can't have and so do I. I know what it feels like, more than anyone else, I understand. I hate it, and maybe, a part of me doesn't want you to fuck up, Potter. So I'll warn you again - I
seem sorry which was so startling, for Harry was sure Draco Malfoy was never sorry, for anything. It was the second time he'd apologized to Harry. It made him feel better, to know that Draco cared for him even if he could never love him like Harry loved him.
After some time, Draco calmed, and to Harry's crushing disappointment, moved off Harry's embrace and sat down like he previously did beside him.
-"I had them help me with sorting out my office. I could've done it with magic—so could they—but no one did, they literally cleaned it all up, muggle-style. They were really kind - I couldn't bring myself to be mean to them even if I still could muster the energy to try. Because they didn't do it out of pity, they were just literally going mad with stagnancy.
-"Is there someone I can call for you? Do you need me to get you an Uber? Where's your phone? Whats your name?—"
-"Why aren't you together then?" He hated that he needed to ask, but he had to. He had to. He'd go mad if he didn't. Harry held his breath, dreading Draco's answer.
He was five years old. And Draco loved him, very much. He loved him so much, it was killing him. Driving him insane, he felt like someone was dragging sharp knives over his insides. He was being gutted alive. Something was clenching his heart, painfully. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't see, he couldn't hear, he couldn't talk, he couldn't live with Astoria, he couldn't live without Astoria.
-"How are you a functioning adult with mental faculties this limited? How much neurons are you running on? You fuckwit."
Harry and Draco sat down on the sofa, facing each other, knees touching, Harry smiled at Draco, because he didn't ask what's wrong—he already knew, but instead tried to take Harry's mind off. . .ironically, his
Blaise eventually got distracted by Theo fussing over Draco's clothes, hair, well-being, in the middle of the ministry of magic, and chose to laugh evilly at them instead. Draco was fucking embarrassed. Scorpius seemed to enjoy watching Draco suffer at the hands of Theo, because he too had suffered the same earlier in the morning, except Draco did then too.
Draco looked a mess, eyes red, cheeks tear-stained, hair disheveled from digging his fingers in his scalp.
After quick huggs, Draco Malfoy stepped in the fireplace to officially start his second day as the ministry of magic's sole fucking potions master.
Draco fell on his knees in utter defeat, Harry fell with him and gathered him in his arms like it was the most natural thing in the world, like they did it all the time. Draco melted against Harry, weeping hysterically, Harry felt his auror robe getting soaked up from where Draco's face was pressed against his chest.
-"You should definitely see her, Draco. She gets more beautiful by the second. Now, that you're single and all." Pansy said.
Draco seemed excited at the prospect but merely rolled his eyes in answer and sprawled down on the bed. Harry joined him and gathered him in his arms to Draco's vehement protesting that resulted in a blow to Harry's nose and another to his stomach. Harry let him go and concentrated on finding a safe-looking movie. He opted finally for one that seemed made for children, on account of the heroine and hero being no more than fourteen years of age,
Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott were smoking muggle cigarettes, outside, while leaning on the telephone box that worked as one of the few entrances to the ministry.
-"How the fuck is this my life? I'm willingly not only associating with a coven of evil Slytherins but I'm being invited to have '
Just a hasty press of lips and he was backing away, cheeks scarlet, looking everywhere but at Draco. They were still sitting side by side, close. Potter flushed harder. The silence went on, yet, Potter didn't apologize for kissing him.
grow to love you the way you deserve. I'm a dead-end, Harry. If you stick around, I'll hurt you. You'll resent me... I'll ruin your life."
Five days and five different house-elves later, on the sixth day, Harry hurried to point out to the first house-elf he'd seen during day one, as it was apparently her turn again, that they weren't really accomplishing anything by opening the door and asking Harry to leave, let alone the right thing, so if they truly wanted to do something kind for Harry and worthy of going against Lucius's word, they should let him in. The house-elf had almost seemed convinced before she frowned at Harry disapprovingly, glaring at him with eyes that said:
Draco Malfoy came from the direction of the elevators a few minutes later. Harry pushed himself off the doors to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and walked slowly towards Draco and Scorpius. When he was within range from them, he almost blurted out a
-"Then, we have to let her go. And be happy too. Because Astoria wants us to be happy too. She loves us very much and now she's not sick anymore. Do you understand, baby?"
-"Yes. I'm sorry," again with the apologizing, Harry noticed; his heart swelled up in his chest, "I noticed you outside yesterday but I hadn't been able to see you. So I'd just asked Blaise to let you know I wasn't free. I hope you didn't wait long before I saw you. Why didn't you ring? I saw you from the northern gardens, pacing back and forth. Were you plucking up the courage to brave The Malfoys?" Draco said, and smirked, amused.
-"Why did I bother writing you off as anonymous if you were going to announce your affair to the whole world, Draco!" Pansy said.
She seemed disappointed. Probably because he didn't ask her for her muggle number. He didn't have a muggle phone; he wasn't sure he'd call her even if he did.
Harry had a glimpse of the old Draco for the first time since he'd seen him again. He suddenly remembered Draco jeering at him, bullying him and his friends, calling Hermione a mudblood, deriding Ron for being poor, trying to get Hagrid fired, calling Harry names, mocking him for being an orphan. . .Merlin. How had Harry forgotten how unkind and spiteful Draco truly was?
The MalfoyNottParkinsonGoyleZabini Association of Narcissistic Disparagers and Anti-Potter Activists.
Besides, the only thing that would actually make Theo happy was if he got to be by Draco's side at all times. Which was somewhat fine by Draco, except it was impractical. Which is why it had taken both Lucius and Narcissa's interference to convince Theo that - no, he shouldn't quit his job and follow Draco around, and he absolutely shouldn't challenge Granger in a duel, and for Salazar's sake he shouldn't kidnap Draco and Scorpius and run off to Italy. It was ridiculous. Draco had genuinely laughed. He'd never seen Theo act like that, so irrational, unreasonable and almost petulant.
Theo was not happy with Draco that night. Draco told him he'd had one too many drinks with Potter, said he'd be fine come morning. He kissed and hugged him tight, Theo relented. They crawled under the warm covers. Draco kissed a sleeping Scorpius's forehead and gathered him in his arms. Theo held them both.
. Well, this time he was waiting around the fireplaces in the atrium. Operation Baby Steps dictated that Harry
He was using Harry, manipulating him, leading him on. But Harry was so far gone, possibly nothing Draco could ever do would deter him.
The room was covered entirely in pillow-feathers, pages from the Quidditch magazines that were on Harry's nightstand littered the room, sad music was playing from the TV as it was this Leslie girl's funeral and Draco was loosing his shit because she was so young and lovely and Harry was a fucking lying, sadistic bastard.
-"No, you're right. I just...you know I'm not doing very well, Harry, don't you? I suffer from Depression and Complicated Grief Disorder. Change overwhelms me, Im okay with visiting for hours but sleeping-over is quite different. I'm Always tired, always sad, always on the verge of tears, always in pain, always missing
No words were exchanged. Or maybe, no words filtered through the fogy numbness in Draco's head. He felt a soft, small hand slip into his, and squeeze it. Pansy. He squeezed her hand back.
, shaking him, murmuring reassuring words in his ear, running a hand over his back soothingly. "Are you alright? Please, what's wrong?" She kept repeating over and over again.
After a beat, he followed Draco and managed to catch up with him just as he stepped in the red telephone booth that led outside the ministry.
-"Emma, darling. I'm afraid I can't stay. My colleague and I, sadly have very urgent matters to attend to. It's all work-related, you see, I wouldn't want to bore you with the details. I've only come by to say hello. I'll see you Friday." Draco tonelessly said. Again, she leaned in and kissed him.
Theodore Nott lay on top of Draco, engulfing him in his arms and hysterically laughing. Draco smiled. Theo saw the little, amused smile and proceeded to lavish Draco's face with kisses. His forehead, both his cheeks, nose, chin, lips, eyelids, brows. Again and again and again. Draco thought it amusing at first but soon surmised that Theo wasn't going to stop anytime soon, so he pushed him off and sat up. Théo sat up too and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, his head tucked on Draco's lap.
Draco burst into hysterical laughter, and Blaise's effort to untangle himself from the leg Pansy had wrapped around his own leg halted - he dropped down with multiple pink ropes restricting his movements.
He was sure Ginny would have sympathized with Malfoy and kept it to herself but Harry hadn't been able to bring himself to tell her. Because Malfoy didn't need sympathy. He needed something. Harry didn't know what it was but he'd find it out and do it. Malfoy needed help. Malfoy needed someone, and Harry would be that someone for him.
Draco did not buy food from the cafeteria so Harry couldn't wait in line with him. There was no line anyways. No one bought food from the cafeteria. Literally no one. But it was still open and working. It was the biggest mystery of Harry's life, before Draco, it was all Harry had thought about, it bugged him to no end. Because, what the fuck? Plus, you can never actually remember the people who worked behind the counters! Were they men or women? or even human? What the fuck were they feeding them?
-"Why, your acting has gotten better. Is Draco tutoring you on how to train your face to keep from the world the fact that you're a filthy, lying, deceitful, piece of shit? Except Draco wouldn't know
-"Draco. Its nearly Christmas." Theo said. Sitting up and clutching Draco's hands in both of his. "Astoria's been dead for a month now. You've been at Father's Estate with me."
Jealousy. Self-loathing. Anger. Hate. Resentment. Despair. Love. So much love. Always; fought for dominance inside Harry. Love always won, and with it, heartbreak encroached upon Harry and crushed him in its unforgiving vice.
Harry, already feeling like shit, distorted and unmoored from everything that's happened to him since Friday—since Draco came back to his life, "What?" He reiterated dumbly.
-"Oh, please. Im aware the Potters weren't completely useless. They weren't old money but still. . .Besides haven't you inherited a decent amount of gold from that ignominious godfather of yours?"
Harry dared put an arm around Draco's shoulders. He didn't immediately jump and scream bloody murder so Harry rested his own head against Draco's. yay!
When Draco Malfoy regained consciousness a couple of minutes later, he felt like shit, sick and dizzy and extremely unwell, he couldn't move a single muscle, so he didn't. He then registered that he was feeling hot all over, not uncomfortably so, but bizarrely so, because the surface beneath him felt cold and moist.
So Harry picked up his spoon and resolved to pretend to be eating, when he heard a loud clatter, he lifted his eyes up and saw that Zabini was glaring at him, having thrown his own spoon for no reason, Zabini huffed, his face scrunched up as if Harry was a pig shitting and eating its own shit. Zabini seemed revolted by the literal fact that Harry was there. Parkison patted his hand in understanding, as if she too had lost her appetite because of filthy poor Potter. What the fuck!
. And I wish no lovers can ever be together. I wish my bereavement and sorrow upon everyone. I wish it on you. You've left me lying in a pool of my own blood. I can't forgive and forget
-"We'll leave if he doesn't like it or gets sleepy, Draco. I promise. I really want you to go out on some adults' outings a little. But I understand that you can't bear to be away from Scorpius, so the party will have to do. Please, Draco. For
-"No, darling, I'm awake. But you really need to get used to speaking English, Scorpius. We're going to be in England for a while."
Draco sniffled fretfully and nodded. Harry took that as his cue to tackle Draco back down on the bed and enfold him in his arms. Draco's head underneath Harry's chin, his face pressed to Harry's neck, Draco's arms trapped between their torsos, legs interwoven. They lay entwined in each other's arms—Harry's arms really.
-"DRACO??!?? YOU CALL HIM DRACO, NOW??? YOU FUCKING HYPOCRITE! DONT YOU REMEMBER WHO HE IS??? WHAT HE DID TO US FOR YEARS?????"
Harry got bold and wrapped his arms around Draco's legs, with his face against Draco's thigh. Draco didn't kick him away this time. Harry released an inaudible sigh of relief.
. So, yeah. . .Draco was going to get his shit together, and maybe later he'd talk about it with Theo.
Draco jumped. "Yes! Hear that Pansy? No need for you to stay. Get out. Be gone with your nosey-self and your stupid muggle movies."
Draco, Scorpius and Zabini walked out of the elevator into the atrium to head home. Harry watched as Draco saw him, groaned and picked up his pace walking to the farthest fireplace from Harry. Zabini's smirk was different. It was evil but, like, its evil was directed at Draco instead; moments later Harry understood why. As Harry ran towards Draco and Draco ran towards the fireplace, Zabini with Scorpius in his arms shoved Draco out of the way and stepped into the fireplace Draco was about to use. Harry reached him just as a cackling Zabini and a disapprovingly frowning Scorpius vanished in green flames.
The smile fell from Harry's face. He finished filling up Draco's plate, set it in front of him, and turned his entire body until he was facing Draco, their knees touching.
Draco Malfoy was fucking with his mind. Harry didn't want to leave him alone. He pissed Harry off, he brought out the worst in him, he was fucking arrogant and snobbish, Harry hated him. The need to know everything there was to know about Malfoy started to bubble inside Harry. Harry wasn't used to not knowing him. Harry knew him goddamn it, yet, he didn't. He wanted to. Everything. He
in love, he didn't even bother look up and continued tenaciously lavishing Draco's skin with kisses.
Since Harry didn't seem like he was planning on moving away from Draco anytime soon, Draco carried on with eating his breakfast, setting his pie on Harry's shoulder.
-"Yes, scorpius. I'm sad. Because you're mother is dead. She loves you very much Scorpius. But you remember how she was ill, dont you? Now, in Heaven, which is a
They stared into each other's eyes some more. Engrossed in each other. Unaware or perhaps uncaring about the fact that Harry was there.
Draco dragged himself to the bathroom to take a bath. It was nearing dawn. He relaxed in the warm embrace of the water, and cried.
Harry hurriedly clasped his arm, "No. wait. What the hell, Draco? This is it? Where are you going? Why do you need to lie to go there? Is this the same place you've been frequenting the past couple of weeks?"

He-who-must-not-be-named, You-Know-Who, you'd feared the name! imagine the man himself! Imagine him standing before you, and tell me you'd have told him no! Even if by some counterproductive miracle you'd managed to stammer a
And it also seemed, even to Harry who didn't know anything about anything concerning Malfoy any longer, that no one,
Harry sputtered and spat Treacle Tart on his fresh shirt, and table. Harry's eyes widened like saucers, his cheeks flamed red from mortification. Lucius, Parkison, Zabini...they'd read—
He didn't really think about a particular destination, he just thought - away. But he wasn't surprised in the least when he found himself before Malfoy Manor.
to wait anywhere else so he just paced in the outside hallway. An hour later, he relented and went inside to wait with Scorpius and Rose. Harry introduced himself properly for the first time to Scorpius, the name Harry Potter didn't seem to ring a bell to him, Draco must've never mentioned him...
considered neighbors, no matter their size? And did Draco remember how red Alex's hair was? So, so, unlike Scorpius's platinum-blond hair. Didn't Alex's mom say that they resembled Ice and Fire? Except, Scorpius didn't really like feeling cold that's why he had so many onesies to keep the cold away during the winter months, so he wasn't particularly icy. And didn't Alex and his mom buy Scorpius a onesie of a muggle fictional character that Scorpius hadn't recognized? And did Lucius know that Alex's mom had been shocked and proceeded to buy Scorpius the entire book-saga? Alex's mom was so sweet but Scorpius couldn't remember her name anymore. Oh, no! She would be sad that Scorpius forgot her name. Did Oncle Greg remember what it was? No, Uncle Greg not
It wasn't funny at all, except, when Draco caught sight of Pansy's ruined make up and the black marks on her cheeks caused by her mascara-stained tears—he burst out laughing. And then laughed some more, until he was doubled over laughing and simultaneously crying hysterically. His chest ached. Pansy scowled at him and childishly yanked his hair. Draco yelped. Theo snarled at her. And everyone started laughing at once.
Half way through, Hermione Granger must've been told they've arrived and came out to meet them. If she was anything other than amused and happy to see them, she didn't show it.
had chosen. Because he was married. To none other than Ginny fucking Weasley; Ron, George, Charlie and Percy's sister; Arthur and Molly's daughter; Hermione's friend—fucking hell.
Theo clenched his jaw tightly. He always kept a firm hold on his emotions, but Draco knew that seeing
About twenty-eight hours later, at Seven o'clock. Sharp. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy stood before Malfoy Manor's stately, dark-wooden interior doors. Because Lucius had refused to grant Harry direct apparition-clearance or access to their Floo-connected fireplace. Harry was nervous. Like, really, really, fucking nervous. Like, really anxious. Harry was clad in an outrageously expensive dark-red robe. It was tight around the waist and had multiple-layers and so heavy and outright annoying for someone who wore muggle jeans and shabby t-shirts every day. Draco had stopped by earlier so he would help Harry dress and tame his
across from him, on the other side of the atrium that now served as a ball-room, stood none other than,
. Not one. And he'd spent the day, seemingly contented with making colorful cards for the girls in his life. He had made, several,
-"My son likes you and I don't think you're so horrible anymore. I actually like you a bit. So, I suppose we are friends. I might ruin your life but it's not impending or anything...I think. Although, Théo would disagree with me and he's usually right. The point is, is this worth the risk?"
And on such a day, a movie-day, with just the two of them, seated in a comfortable sofa right in front of the TV in Grimmauld Place's drawing-room. Draco had eventually found it and refused to carry on viewing movies from Harry's bed since he tended to get too handsy and affectionate there when Draco was
Pansy Parkinson, with Blaise Zabini on her heels, came to meet them, before they reached the ceremony.
But Draco didn't actually believe in the muggle God, nor did he think that the universe was somehow sentient or just; and
Presently, he was watching Draco Malfoy who was apparently a widower now, walk away with...Nott? Who was kissing Malfoy's temple and leading him with an arm around his shoulders towards the elevators.
Harry felt sick. The ache in his chest unbearably intensified as time went on. He trembled where he stood and braced himself with both hands on the sink. He couldn't bring himself to stare at his reflection in the mirror, he knew what he would see there, staring back - a man who'd lost
Granger looked impressed and about to ask more questions, so Draco did the sensible thing and kicked them out. He
-"I'm not sure I do. Pray help me remember, is it in the north side of The Giant Italian Lake or in the south? I assume it's built underwater? However do you reach it? You'd have to swim! The water would be freezing even if you weren't a sad orphaned child who'd never been taught to swim!"
Harry's heart beat pulsed loudly in his ears, almost washing out Draco's voice, but he'd heard him and started nodding in agreement before Draco even finished.
-"Draco! Oh, Salazar. You can hear me! Oh, you, you...You scared me. You scared me. You scared me. You scared me—" He went on and on, reiterating the same words over, and over again.
and been given a choice to live. But Draco had left after the trials, without a word, all his friends with him. There'd been no one to ask. So, Harry Potter hadn't gone back to Hogwarts either.
Harry felt so drained, he wanted to lay on the cold tiled-floor of the bathroom and stay there until it was time to leave. He could barely manage faking a pained smile anyways.
Later. Much later. The pathetic group crying-session drew to an end, they moved to one of the nearest guest rooms and slept together on the bed, like when they were children, or actually just last week.
-"Ohhhhh! Remember when Draco had a crush on Potter? It was so embarrassing—" Pansy said. Giggling hysterically like a choking pig in Draco's opinion.
" he screamed. Pedestrians stared at him, some in concern others in schadenfreudien amusement or irritation, but Harry did not register any of it.
-"This was a one-time thing, Potter. Now, off you go." He said it like it was nothing. Like it didn't mean anything, didn't change anything.
-"Probably chasing some useless bit of gossip about what type of coal the minister's imaginary mistress uses to fuel her hearth." Theo said.
-"And I can promise you, Potter. We will use this knowledge against you. You'll be our slave for all eternity - since we're all inseparable." Pansy said.
In the bedroom, Harry turned on the TV and settled on the bed, under the covers, Draco beside him, slowly eating his chocolate cake.
Blaise smirked, "Ah, yes. My insincerest apologies, Draco, Potter. You see, Potter came to visit you,
Ugh. But seriously, hadn't Draco told Harry about how he'd been so sad Jack died when they'd went out with Parkison that he'd even debated swearing off movies for good? Fuck.
He sagged against Harry in defeat, Harry didn't waste a second before he apparated them to 12 Grimmauld Place.
. Wishful thinking. The truth was - he didn't hate everything, only because he didn't have it in him to
-"What happened to you? I thought you had a reputation to uphold. You're supposed to be my cold, seemingly heartless, dark and mysterious friend! This is seventy-years-old-cat-loving-grandma behavior." Draco said to Theo.
in Malfoy Manor, told him that Draco himself had been holding her dead body for an entire night, that she'd been dying her
Theo happily obliged, and slithered in underneath the covers, gathering Draco in his arms, he sighed.
This wasn't supposed to happen. Harry wasn't supposed to feel like this, ache like this. To yearn to possess someone that belonged to another.
-"Oh, Salazar! But you two were so stupid. I felt sorry for you a bit, but watching you two obliviously pinning after each other was so fun. I just couldn't bring myself to tell you. Besides, we were sharing a dorm and I had no intentions of listening to you fuck all night." Blaise said, laughing. Yet, his laughter sounded strained. It always did when it came to that.
-"Hmm. I guess. I don't know what we are, Harry. This isn't fair to you but neither was me loosing Astoria. Life is cruel. Sometimes we kiss, sometimes we don't. It just happens. Naturally. It's Theo. I don't expect you to understand, because not even our family does. They just go along with it. Astoria understood, though. One day, years ago, when we were still newlyweds, before I'd cracked up and told her everything, she'd read a book and came to me, saying she'd found something that quite accurately and exceptionally described Theo and I's relationship
At that precise moment, an ugly, tiny, little...owl? Smashed into the sunroom's closed, french-doors.
Draco closed his eyes and breathed out. Draco's right palm against Harry's left cheek, their faces so close, Harry inhaled Draco's exhales.
Harry's chest felt constricted, the fear, that someday Draco would leave him, pressed painfully upon his chest like heavy metal. Harry's pain and regret at the sight of Draco's tears, tears that he had indirectly but stupidly and negligently caused made his own rise and resurface, burning his eyes. And then Draco ripped himself out of Harry's embrace and pointed at the screen like he couldn't believe what he was seeing.
Draco glared at her some more, and pushing his overwhelming fear of his beautiful, perfect, white-blond hair being tarnished by the evil cow, aside - he sat back down.
He smirked when he spotted Harry and pushed against the wall, straightening up, he moved sinuously towards Harry, and smiled a cruel, disdainfully cold smile that made the hairs on Harry's arms rise.
. Fuck. Draco's baby boy was smart and had rightly picked up on the reason Draco had went batshit crazy back when the whole ministry incident and disapparating in spite of all the magical and protective barriers in place, happened; and the two weeks of supposedly working overtime with his Oncle Theo that followed. And the reason was, to put it simply, in one word -
Draco's resolve was set. Theo wouldn't be happy about it but he'd promise him to never do it again and keep his promise. Just this once.
But nothing hurt as much as being away from Draco. Harry lived for the moments when Draco would come down for lunch with Scorpius in tow and would sit down with Blaise, Millicent and always Theo—And Harry would get to watch him. While under his cloak of invisibility of course, for he couldn't venture into the cafeteria while Draco was there.
. I can manage a sneer that will remind him of why we're not friends if I have to, a sneer to encapsulate the time he'd gotten my father imprisoned and the time he sliced me open and all the times I'd made fun of his dead mother."
-"HOW DARE YOU?! I NEVER SCREAM! IM NOT A BRUTE. IM JUST TALKING LOUDLY. I HAVE BEEN TOLD I SOUND LIKE A MELODIOUS, ENCHANTING LYRE PLAYED BY THE GODS!"
-"You know, Scorpius's actually not sleeping. I left him with Uncle Lucius. They were reading some book about gay unicorns. We can take him with us." Greg said.
That would mean Draco would be really upset considering he loved Nott. Harry's heart hammered, concern for Draco erasing all other thoughts.
which Draco had the house-elves plant following the burial, they'd magically aided it in its growth so it looked quite old and in a way, almost,
And day after day, Harry knew soon a day would come where he would wake up unable to bring forth the will to live. And since no one in the world but ironically Kreacher who was far from the Leaky Cauldron gave a fuck about Harry - he would surly perish.
Back-stabbing betrayal?" Ron was shouting by the end of his speech and Harry's eyes welled up in tears.
shade. Yet despite their unforgiving blackness, they were warm, and shone with so much unadulterated love and unshed tears, for
' Pansy had made them attend to that weekend, confiding in Harry that he'd only pretended to hate it for being contrary's sake but secretly loved it and really wanted to see it again, or maybe another movie, maybe a different genre too since he didn't appreciate the sad ending and it'd made him cry, and did Harry know an actor named Tom Felton? Another called Jason Isaacs? They were pretty good, and did Harry have a muggle TV at home? And what did Harry think about Draco sneaking in a TV for his room? Would Pansy find it despite a good disillusionment charm? That cow was shrewd like a hawk, Draco laughed.
Harry pushed the door open, his heart hammering for no fucking reason—at least one he's willing to consider—and sat in one of the two chairs in front of Draco's desk.
Draco started crying. He hugged his son closer and tucked Scorpius's little head underneath his chin, crying silently, all-the-while repeating how much he
? Had you been unable to think, literally, think and feel, incriminating thoughts and emotions, like fear, hopelessness, hate, because The Dark Lord was the most skilled Legilimens out there? Draco Malfoy had.
Granger'd said the ministry has made half-hearted attempts to get a potions master before but it's not like they actually need one, since nothing happens, they gave up looking. Besides, they couldn't actually a afford a full-time one. Draco wasn't doing this for the money, nor did he need it so he took the job. But Granger had also said that the ministry had actually been paying Horace Slughorn to brew a dozen or so wolfsbane potions every month for years now. But she'd said it was really expensive for the ministry to pay for the ingredients—mainly Aconite—plus Slughorn's pay. She'd also said that it was frankly really draining work to do for someone like old Slughorn, so Draco had volunteered to relieve him from making it and offered to take over for free. The minister of magic had thanked him personally. Slughorn had been delighted to hear it. So Draco had a little something to look up to. By the end of the month he'd be awfully busy.
Draco was leaving him. Harry's heart would never stop aching, ferociously protesting against being parted with Draco, the hollow pit of heartache would swallow him whole, from the inside out. Draco, Draco Malfoy whom Harry
—since Harry Potter had last seen Draco Malfoy. Draco had been working from home, brewing wolfsbane potions. But today he would be back and Harry was presently racing towards the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
, he loved it, loved him, Merlin. Harry let go of Draco's face and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, crushed Draco to his body and fucking breathed properly for the first time in fifteen days.
But Draco hadn't seen Potter since Pansy called him (accurately) a pathetic, lost puppy. Potter had been avoiding Draco. Which is why he was confident Blaise wouldn't bump into him in the atrium or anywhere. And Blaise had no reason to ask anyone when Draco left, he hated Draco's coworkers anyways, it was an inter-departments' thing he'd said. And hopefully Blaise wouldn't think it odd that he didn't say goodbye to Scorpius. He'd probably be too excited to care. Draco would tell them the truth when he got home.
Sometimes Draco wouldn't be numb nor having difficulties thinking straight, he would be neither excessively tired or obsessively thinking about death.
-"But that's not what happened at all! And besides I said eventually that I'd mistaken his love for Jealousy."
, leave his side— so Scorpius wouldn't worry about where his Oncle Theo was. Scorpius'd believed him and said he loved Draco and would miss him so much. Draco's tears had fallen then and he'd told Scorpius that he too loved him very much and that he was only crying because he was so very happy Scorpius was his son. And he was.
-"Not really, there's no point since I'm going to start brewing Wolfsbane Potion on Thursday from home anyways." Draco said, as he adjusted his rumpled clothing and—perfectly—messy hair from all the day's snuggling and fighting.
Draco's red-rimmed eyes were wide open. They looked empty and glazed over, face expressionless, blank. Like he'd sustained a full-body injury that traumatized the entirety of his nervous-system and he no longer knew anything but debilitating numbness.
-"Yes. It's past sundown, but not dark enough to not be able to see how you've vandalized the bedroom,"
And yes, he would have to go back to work, where Hermione could keep tabs on him for Ron. If he were to go alone anywhere else, Ron would surely suspect him of secretly meeting Draco. Harry would have to avoid him in the ministry, he was sure that faced with Draco all Harry's painfully erected walls would crumble to dust and he would fuck up his only chance with his own child.
Theodore Nott hurriedly pulled out a still crying Scorpius from his Father's arms to his own, tucking Scorpius's little head against his chest so as not to let him see his father and the way he crumbled to the ground the moment Scorpius was out of his arms. Like a marionette that had just gotten its strings cut off.
But Scorpius wasn't there and he couldn't be because Draco was drunk. Drinking. And Scorpius was five. Hmm...Maybe when Scorpius was older they could drink together. Yes, that would be perfect. Because Scorpius was perfect. Draco suddenly, really, really, really missed him and made to stand up and go to him, only to wobble and slump down on his seat instead.
-"You know, I'll just follow you everywhere until the day—sooner or later—you let your guard down, thinking you're alone, that I'd given up, but you won't be alone, Draco, you never will be, and I'll find out where you go. I'll catch you in the act. No matter how long—"
-"Speaking of hornless unicorns, the weather is really nice today. Don't you think, Draco?" After which, Harry was planing on asking him out for a little stroll to enjoy the weather and hopefully manage to convince Draco to grab a bite with Harry and maybe even to come live with him.
He watched Draco, his silvery, voluptuous, long hair, falling down his shoulders, messy from Harry's hands when he'd held Draco's head in place to kiss  him, made even messier by Draco's struggles against Harry's hold, Harry wondered if Draco had some Veela blood in him, and oddly wanted to ask him right then and there but figured Draco would be offended, seeing as he was a pureblood and all. Was Draco happy now? He wouldn't stop laughing. If he was happy they could kiss. Harry would feel happy then too. He leaned in and kissed Draco's laughing mouth, tasting Draco's salty tears, Harry startled. Draco wasn't happy. Harry's onslaught of feelings and heartache were making him delusional. Was he truly, literally
Well, it didn't really feel like her bed, she was hardly there. Or maybe Harry was just exaggerating, too drunk on love to remember that in fact Ginny spent six months, entirely at home, after the Quidditch season ended each year. She wasn't to blame. No. No one really is. The heart wants what it wants—
-"Yes. Father, Blaise, Pansy, Greg, Theo, I'm not sure about Mother but since she hadn't interfered, I'm assuming she couldn't care less about you. I guess it's better than hate though."
-"Fuck, yeah. You know, we seriously don't have to go. We can just head out to the Manor. I already bought Scorpius a thousand galleons' worth of toys. And so did everyone."
-"There are no words, no matter how eloquent that could possibly do justice to a person's feelings, memories, heart, hopes and dreams. And most certainly none for Astoria."
hair and stuck both his hands in his pockets so as not to do something stupid. Except, judging by Malfoy's frown, Harry's expression must've betrayed some of his inner turmoil. Harry's cheeks turned scarlet.
Draco was monologuing and didn't really mind Harry's half-smiles and distracted nodding by the way he kept going on and on about how evil Parkison was.
After an awfully short period of time in Harry's opinion —about ten minutes— Harry moved to leave. Harry didn't really want to but he was sure Draco's patience and sympathy were simply an aberration, and soon he'd be glaring in disdain at Harry. And Harry really,
-"It's hardly fair for Greg to conjure a chair while we all get comfortable," Blaise smiled innocently. "Go join your child's godfather."
Scorpius, five-year-old Scorpius, sweet and kind Scorpius, had conspicuously, so, so obviously and painfully—for Draco—ceased completely to acknowledge that Astoria has ever existed. He wouldn't wear his
Harry sneered. They all laughed. Thankfully, Scorpius seemed oblivious to his surroundings and totally preoccupied with his book.
without Draco or any news about him for two weeks. Which reminded him that he'd only been feeling this joyful for less than fifteen minutes, and that he'd been in fact slowly going mad with fear and crippling anxiety.
When Draco had seen Emma, he'd unsurprisingly, quickly, resigned to his heart's desires, which were to follow her to the ends of the earth. To the gates of Hell. Surrender everything. Give up anything. In reality those were his feelings for Astoria. Not Emma. Not anyone. Ever. But he'd succumbed to the sweet little reprieves from pain he'd enjoyed whenever he was with her. For although she was most certainly not Astoria, she looked almost exactly like her. And sometimes, if he tried hard enough, he could almost forget and believe that it was truly
by love or whatever. Probably too happy now that they could finally be together, he didn't see Draco. He didn't see his pain so he couldn't help him. And Harry would.
Malfoy led them away from his office and the kids, past hermione and a lot of occupied cubicles, at some point Harry recognized where Draco was taking them - they were heading for where it all started. Or was it there? Was it
-"Why, you ungrateful little shit. I've been bathing and dressing you everyday, feeding you calming draughts, sleeping and replenishing potions, force-feeding you food - you get the picture. Otherwise, you'd be looking as ghastly as you surly feel."
Maybe if he'd fought Death for her life and lost he wouldn't feel like this. Maybe if she'd died of old age he wouldn't have felt like this. Maybe if she hadn't wept sorrowful tears of sheer rage and regret when taking her last breaths he wouldn't feel like this. Maybe if the guilt and self-recrimination hadn't killed her every day before the blood-curse had, he wouldn't feel like this. Maybe if she hadn't sobbed and begged Draco to
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. Draco just said his name. His first name. For the first time in forever. Merlin. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Harry's heart thundered in his chest, his insides fucking tickling almost painfully, he felt dizzy, overwhelmed with the onslaught of emotions running wild inside him.
kissing, it was just Théo's usual soft kisses on his cheeks, forehead, nose, chin, lips, eyelids, brows.
Presently he was waiting outside the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures because he didn't want Hermione to catch him lurking around Draco's office.
That evening found Harry James Potter skulking around the atrium, waiting for Draco to call it a day. He was going to
mad, and hardly at home, he was never there to answer when someone Floo-called him. So mad, and feeling marginally guilty he would always avoid Hermione at work.
Harry thought. He stroked Draco's hair and didn't dare make a noise. He was scared Draco would remember where he was,
. It would . . . hurt me more, I think, to finally have you but simultaneously not have you at all. She's gone and I finally understand what I didn't permit myself to even think about. There's no going back for you like there isn't for me. I don't have to torment myself with hope anymore. Hope you'll leave her for me. Now she's gone and you're all mine. But now I understand and even accept that hoping you'd forget her is just as impossible and inconceivable as me ever letting you go."
Everyone seemed satisfied like some big, reasonable decision which everyone and more importantly the person it concerned had agreed on, was just made.
Theo was sucking Draco's tongue in an interesting and new way so Draco was too distracted to continue down that thought process. Salazar! Draco moaned in pleasure and surprise. Theo pulled away to smile smugly and proudly down at Draco.
Harry moved out fully from behind the door and approached Draco, he felt so bad he resigned himself to handing Draco his wand and accepting whatever retribution Draco seemed fitting.
But thankfully, Ginny and Hermione helped. And Ginny was happy again with Harry for letting her in on what's troubling him. Harry felt better now that Ginny was talking to him. Harry was reminded of why he loved her and married her - she was such a good friend to him.
Yet, the children of Death Eaters and mainly Draco had been much loved celebrities in the wizarding world, so they'd been tracked down eventually to France. Harry had thought of him often, in the beginning he'd even tried to find his whereabouts by using his position as an auror but he hadn't been able to find anything until The Daily Prophet had announced that Draco and some Slytherins had transferred to Beauxbatôns for their final year of schooling.
As it was all clearly too much for him, Draco, overwhelmed and fragile, sagged against Harry. Harry subsequently crushed him in his arms, Draco whimpered, Harry loosened his hold a bit.
Draco's calm, flat tone, shattered, and his voice cracked, as he continued, nearly toppling over from the raw ache in his very soul. He clung to the dark-wooden podium in front of him tightly with both hands.
known for being oblivious—who had instantly picked up on Draco's anxiety when he'd gotten the Dark Mark; It was also because of Draco that you'd
-"No, of course not. I keep nothing from Father, he knows I'm with you," Harry nodded and closed his eyes, he was exactly where he wished to be, until Draco opened his fucking mouth, "Of course we can't keep anything a secret even if we wanted to, they all read the letters." Draco said, smirking maliciously.
-"Don't say things like that to her, Greg. She's already cocky and insufferable enough. Our lives are hard as it is. She thinks she's somehow better than us for working at the daily prophet. Which is literally stupid. Because, hello! Im a fucking potions master." Draco said.
Théo's. Draco briefly imagined his life with Theo instead of Astoria. It would have been easier. It would have been right and good too...
Although Draco was an asshole, he wasn't unkind to Harry anymore. His careless and rude remarks didn't sting as they once had, because they were halfhearted and just who Draco was. He had a sharp tongue, acted insensitive and like he couldn't care less about him but he nevertheless emitted a sort of warm,
Harry tried to hug Draco but he pushed him away and curled up on his side on the bed, his back to Harry, crying and sulking in silence.
-"Oh, Merlin." Draco said, a while later after he finished laughing. Which Harry absolutely did not oppose and would rather they continue somewhere private.
. I hate that her last moments on earth were of rage, despair and terror. I wish...I-I wish—Merlin, Theo, I wish, I too was dead."
Draco turned to face him, his skin was so pale, it didn't take long for his nose and cheeks to pink. Draco's expression was once again unguarded, he looked vulnerable and troubled. Harry's heart painfully squirmed in his chest.
mad, and unable to stay for a just a few hours away from Draco, he didn't show up for any Friday dinner-night with 'mione and Ron for over a month. So utterly,
-"You start on Monday morning. Scorpius will have his own playroom directly in front of your designated office, which is located in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, Granger will meet you there at nine in the morning. She's the head of the department by the way." Blaise said. He then proceeded to shamelessly resume his conversation with Narcissa and Lucius about the fucking weather.
Draco Malfoy watched them adjusting their clothing, hair and makeup in pansy's case. And quite suddenly hated them. He felt a strong wave of self-loathing and of hate towards everyone else wash over him. Immediately after which, he felt weak and tired. He was so sad
-"It's like I'm watching a movie about a bunch of Dumbledores lying and keeping shit from one and another."
Draco would eventually wake up and realize: you're Potter. Harry Potter, someone he'd actively 'despised' for years and go back to hating you.
-"Oh, Merlin! Oh, Merlin and Morgana! You wouldn't believe who's getting all cozied up with Martin from the department of mysteries." She exclaimed, scurrying away in the direction the supposed cozying up was taking place.
On Friday, Harry Potter spent the entire day following Draco around and arguing with himself, weighing the pros and cons of endeavoring to pick up every bit of his famous Gryffindor courage to try and convince—in other words pitifully beg Draco to not go see Emma The Doppelgänger.
. She frowned, Hermione and Ron smiled and the latter pretended to be surprised. They hugged her in turn, Hermione and Ron took too long so Harry would have enough time to get his shit together and stop the tears burning his eyes from falling. He couldn't. She saw his shiny green-eyes, frowned, then beamed brightly thinking they were tears of happiness. They hugged and Harry wished for death.
He cupped Théo's cheek, moved so he was straddling Theo's lap, and pressed his lips against Theo's, Draco's hands in Theo's hair, he started pretending like they were having a passionate make-out session with funny, provocative voices and all. Theo went along with it and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist.
for so long? It took him until we were fourteen and we thought I had fucking Dragon Pox to realize it!"
that she was dead, though, he no longer feared her death. No. Pain was the new resident evil in Draco's body. Scorpius's innocent words dug a hole in his heart. Draco's breath caught in his throat, and his heart squeezed painfully, he tried to push the creeping fog away - They needed to leave.
And so what? Harry didn't see any problems with having a safe and predictable life. What was so wrong with that? He'd literally had a target on his forehead his entire life! Someone tried to kill him nearly every year of his teenage years!
-"They're literally a bunch of idiots who need things repeated twice for them to understand and that's exactly what you've done, Pansy!"
-"—Now, carry on and do as you wish. Don't let us stop you. Pretend we're not here." Pansy continued.
But upon uttering those words—for the first time to someone who hadn't known...It made them all the more real, gut-wrenchingly
. Everyone finally noticed, they fussed, worried and fretted, tried to get Harry to St Mungo's but he refused seeing as nothing could cure heartache, they didn't know
-"Hey! Don't talk to him like that. What the fuck!" Potter said. He stood angrily from the bed and faced Pansy.
As Harry apparated the next day in front of the Burrow, the spring afternoon sun warmed his chilly body through.
Draco Malfoy disapparated them, in the middle of the ministry of magic—somewhere you cannot apparate or disapparate from. Like Hogwarts.
And before darkness dragged Harry under and he lost consciousness, he heard Nott whisper in his ear "If you so much as breathe near him, I'll make sure you never see him again."
Draco apparently couldn't help himself, he smirked up at Ron, stared in Harry eyes, for a fraction of a second, with
Draco then picked up his son, and moved past Harry and an aghast Hermione, past shell-shocked co-workers, down the hall.
-"Things don't have to be this dramatic Theo. You and Astoria are my two greatest, epic loves. I love you and you love me, we can be together. Nothing would change anyways. You and I, in a way, were always together. If Astoria was anyone else I bet she'd have been jealous, But she was perfect and instead felt sad you and I didn't get to be together even if it meant her and I, would've never been. Because, had things been different, I sure as fuck wasn't going to
Malfoy turned, shoved him on the chest hard and in a fraction of a second, had his wand pointed at Harry's throat.
- Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Greg, Scorpius, Millicent Bulstrode—who worked as the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation—were escorting him to work. Like he was eleven years old and it was his first day at Hogwarts.
-"Hmm. Well, we both have a sweet tooth, it was how we'd bonded in the beginning. She was a year younger, one of my friends's sister, Daphné's sister. We'd been a bunch of traumatized, English, rich, purebloods in a foreign country. We'd only had each other to rely on. One morning, I'd been quite understandably miserable about how terribly the French weather affected my hair's health, Pansy, the fucking envious slut, had been threatening to cut it, while Théo'd been trying to get me to ditch class with him, Blaise was being his usual self-centered self and not crying rivers over the woeful state of my hair, I'd been mad and asked Greg to punch the fucking self-important smirk off his face—needless to say it was a typical morning for us. But I remember it very well, because Astoria had been late too, she'd felt reasonably desolate over my predicament and offered me her very own, self-made hair potion. Id tried it and my hair had instantly turned back to its usual glorious self. I'd asked her to teach it to me, she'd agreed. With time, hair potions, sweets, Astoria's bluntness and patience with me, and above all - How perfect she'd always thought I was, I could do no wrong in her eyes, I'd never seen her disappointed in me, I was always good enough, whatever I did, she had unconditional support and encouragement for me—we fell in love. The rest is history I suppose."
He laughed against Theo's lips and started to pull away. Theo, moved fast, rolled them around so Draco was underneath him, laughing too.
-"Neither do I. I just like to enjoy one from time to time. Especially on days like this. When her absence is stark and glaring."
hurt. But the brutal irony is: Theo's pain hurts me even more," Draco pushed away from Harry, "Salazar, what a fucking sad bunch we are!"
. It symbolized death and resurrection for the Druids; it was also, a poisonous tree, so Draco'd thought it exceptionally well-fitting, for death was poisonous for the ones left behind. He'd had a protective and repellent magical barrier around it so Scorpius or any unsuspecting visitors wouldn't get hurt.
He'd known she was dying. He'd known it all along. She'd never kept it from him. She'd been honest with him, telling him that choosing to be with her was choosing impending and inevitable suffering. But Draco didn't choose to love her. He just did.
to, win them over that is. For you. They mean everything to you. Besides, I'm not planning on leaving your side for more than a few hours a night,
He felt fresh tears prickling his eyes, he blinked them away, took a stuttering breath and opened the door.
Harry felt hopelessness and despair creeping up on him, winding around his ankles, fastening them together, tying him up, shackling him down.
Fuck. Was that Teddy's wife? Shit. Shit. Shit. Teddy's wife was dying—already dead? In his arms. Harry turned his face to Draco and watched as his face crumpled, hot, salty tears, that Harry kissed away, cascading down his cheeks. Was he thinking of Astoria? Merlin Harry had seriously fucked up big time. He should have watched it first or something. But Draco wasn't pushing him away, so that was a good sign. Draco's eyes were red-rimmed and puffy, his golden lashes were wet. He struggled to breathe through the tears and hiccuped periodically. Harry's heart squeezed excruciatingly.
He felt tears pool in his eyes, blurring his vision, constricting his airways. He absolutely did not want to cry in front of someone as despicable as Potter. But he was unable to stop the hot tears. He wouldn't let Potter see him like that, though. Not in a million years.
Draco Malfoy had a fitful sleep. His dreams nowadays weren't particularly nightmares, but they were worse, they were of
Pansy and Blaise were still petrified where they stood, Theo, still running his fingers tenderly through Draco's hair, when Lucius and Narcissa walked in. Greg was obviously on Scorpius-duty.
-"Is this going to happen often?" Harry said, meaning both these mysterious and frankly ominous escapades of Draco and his using of Harry.
He focused on his breathing for a while. And fought to keep his mind clear. It marginally worked, he stopped shaking too bad and when he attempted to stand, he managed without toppling over.
Draco. Oh, Merlin. Draco. Draco. Draco. Draco. Draco. Draco. Harry couldn't believe this was happening! Why him? Always him! WHY HIM?
Draco pulled away a little and Harry nearly died. Draco must've seen Harry's instant expression of anguish because he pecked his lips reassuringly again.
He moved an utterly limp and yielding Draco to the couch, sat him down and encouraged him to lie across it. Harry lay down beside him, gathered Draco in his arms, intertwined their legs, and enclosed him within his own body. Harry's heart beating in sync with Draco's; Harry's soul squirming and stretching to merge with Draco's; Harry's mind and body surrendering to Draco's. He terribly, undeniably, irrevocably loved Draco Lucius Malfoy.
Nott's whole body was rigid and tense. Merlin only knows how shocking it must be for him when he'd actually known her for years; lost the man he loved to her.
-"I love love love love love love you, Scorpius." Draco said out loud. A big smile on his handsome features.
Hermione'd said that as it'd been nearing the end of the month, Draco would be working from home, brewing wolfsbane potions.
-"Let me go home. Don't you fucking understand? You're the last person I want to be with right now. You disregard my wishes, I tell you no, you hear yes. You follow me, spy on me, force yourself on me, insult me, take away my fucking wand, forcibly kiss me. Who the fuck do you think you are?!"
. He held his cane with both hands in front of him, and regarded Harry up and down with thinly-veiled disgust in his eyes.
Draco whimpered, hot tears cascading down his face. Expression anguished. Harry's heart ached for him and broke.
Harry glanced at him, and knew without a doubt that he would watch the whole wide world burn for Draco Malfoy. It was awful but very true.
Harry had almost fallen asleep himself while he sat in a sofa listening to Draco read Scorpius his bedtime story.
-"I actually thought it went well. You've earned so many points by being an ungrateful and horrible child and not jumping in your Mother's defense. It was a test. You made it."
," he made a disgusted face at that, "What with you being married and all. What did it take, prey tell me? Did you beg and beseech? Cry at his feet? Did you use the orphan-card? The savior-card would never work on Draco so I'm assuming you cried about how sad and traumatized Draco made you when he'd made fun of your mudblooded mother's death?" Harry saw red and he was about to pull out his wand and duel Zabini right then and there when the next words out of his unpleasant, vile mouth halted and confused him, "That's low, even for you, using Draco's grief and depression, his misplaced and frankly bizarre fondness for you to get into his pants while using your dead—"
-"Scorpius is alright. Thank Merlin. Some chocolate cake and Pansy's muggle films and he was back to normal. Gregory bathed him and now I presume he's reading him a bedtime story." Narcissa said quietly.
-"I can't believe you, Draco. I feared you'd been up to something shady. There's nothing wrong with going to muggle clubs. Although, admittedly, it's kinda weird, because you're Draco Malfoy, all prim and proper, snobbish and sometimes even annoyingly genteel—which makes you look so out of place here. but it's okey. It's nothing to be ashamed of or keep secret. I'm not a conceited, pureblooded asshole with a stick up my ass like Nott. . . or  you, as a matter of fact. Come on I'll buy you a drink or two or three. Can we come tomorrow? Or every night. It's so close—"
-"I let him in the house behind Uncle Lucius's back. We're really going to have to do something about it since Potter is going to start coming over a lot."
. I think Draco's pretty sad because his wife died. I yelled at him at a party and he turned my owl blue. Now, I want to be his friend but I'm not really sure how to go about that, seeing as he doesn't really like me and I became an auror." Harry said in a frantic rush.
White-blond hair, a unique shade, Draco's shade. Harry raced towards him as Draco made to turn a corner into a dark deserted alley, likely to disapparate.
Harry couldn't do anything but stare at him, confused, hurt, scared, he stared at Draco; pleadingly, silently begging Draco to let him have this for a while longer. Harry wasn't ready. No. Harry would never be ready. Never. Please—
-"I admit, it's a well thought-out justification. But Potter, none of the people gossiping about me, came thrice to visit me when I was. . . sick. None of those people had Death Eater Lucius Malfoy smiling and simultaneously sneering at them and oh-so-politely and not-so-subtly conveying that they weren't welcome in his home, yet still came back for a fourth visit. None of those people follow me around. You're all in this together you say, but none of those people need me, Potter. None of those people have
Theo was trying to take away Draco's nearly finished bottle of firewhiskey. But Draco needed it. He needed the numbness he had at the funeral back. Or to fucking die already. He needed his body to stop fighting the inevitable - and just
He sat up, and was greeted by the sight of his best friends standing by his drawing-room's doorframe, staring at him in Ron's case with a flabbergasted expression edging on horrified as realization slowly dawned on him. Hermione on the other hand, as was always the case, seemed already past all of that, way ahead of Ron, looking profoundly disappointed and sad, not at all surprised, though. Harry knew he had a matter of seconds to act.
Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott stood in front of the magnificent foyer in The Nott Estate, taking a much needed moment before flooing to Diagon-Alley.
when they'd showed up together last Monday. Although Nott was admittedly, more striking and eye-catching. Harry bristled in indignation. She caught Harry's glare beyond Draco's shoulder and smiled at him. Harry felt a bit better at that. Although her smile was a bit mean and amused. Fucking hell! How did he end up in the middle of this horrible love-pentagon of assholes?! Well, technically, Draco was in the middle—
was. When little boys got angry at having to share their toys, I was always upset at having to share
-"We didn't plan to do it, we were just too tired and slept. Your uncle Greg didn't sleep with us either. We'll have one soon, I promise." Theo said.
Sitting gracefully on a splendid, chesterfield sofa, was Narcissa Malfoy. Expression neutral. Harry couldn't help but observe how divinely beautiful she was, with her fair skin and silky blond hair, a darker shade than her husband's and son, her eyes blue unlike their silver-grey ones. She wore a black, long and one-shouldered dress, and Harry was beginning to pick up on a on-going theme, because on her sleeveless arm was a sort of bracelet, or bracelets? No, whatever, it was a snake made in what Harry was sure, was pure silver. The snake coiled tightly up her entire arm, it's eyes were two emeralds. She didn't let anything on. Face blank and expressionless. Harry didn't know what to think of her. She didn't sneer at him, she also didn't smile.
To be near the person you love most - happiness filled Harry's heart, made him feel invincible. He felt more alive than ever. His soul felt at peace. He'd never been happier. Harry Potter was in heaven.
He distantly registered Pansy and Theo holding him. But his heart terribly ached, his world ended and he couldn't even remember it ending.
After which, Pansy and Blaise announced their intentions of 'properly' celebrating the new year in vague terms. Draco didn't appreciate the reminder because it was disgusting and he really didn't want to imagine his friends in compromising positions and mistakenly didn't keep his sentiments on the matter to himself which earned him a subtle hair pulling contest with Pansy in front of their chosen fireplace in the middle of the still marginally full atrium. Greg and Blaise dragged them away to different fireplaces. Pansy shouted that he was jealous because he wasn't getting any. Draco smugly reminded her that she couldn't say shit like that because his wife was dead. Everyone facepalmed and hurried to fuck off.
contrast to his old self. His depression had tamed him. Or maybe—though he was loath to admit it—Harry simply hadn't known him well before. Maybe, all along, Draco was a whiny, loving, dramatic, vulnerable, delicate, mean, crybaby, but only for his friends and family to see. Did he truly consider Harry his friend now?
Harry didn't doubt that Theo would follow through with his threat if Harry were to be in Draco's vicinity.
words. Harry had protested that he hadn't known. She'd looked at him disappointedly and shook her head. Like she knew something he didn't. Like Harry was an idiot who hadn't learned an important lesson. Harry and Ron would never hope to know everything Hermione knew, so they'd brushed her off and played a game of wizarding-chess to start the new year. But Hermione's comments had still nagged him at night. He'd tossed and turned in his bed and slept fitfully, until he relented and owled Malfoy a reasonable apology. Harry had felt again that dreaded anticipation he'd experienced upon first seeing him again. He'd only been back in Harry's life a day and he was already fucking things around in his head. The bastard. Harry had restlessly paced around 12 Grimmauld place for an hour only to receive no answer whatsoever and a permanently blue Pigwidgeon. Harry had been angry. He'd imagined Malfoy and his cronies' evil laughter and had been in a foul mood all weekend.
Harry, unable to truly stay away, had watched Draco from afar everyday for the past two weeks, but he hadn't been able to bring himself to talk to Draco before figuring out what the hell he was feeling.
suffering. I want to make sure you know all of that, because I care about you a lot. My teenage self would despise me for this but it's true. You're very good to me, Harry, even if I could never love you the way you love me."
think so, do you? None of you do. Not when you awkwardly joke about it, and breathe an inaudible sigh of relief when I laugh along you. Why do you keep bringing it up, Blaise? Because you feel guilty, because you know what you did. Sometimes the guilt creeps up on you, Blaise, and you can't ignore it, so you seek relief, you joke about it, I laugh, you feel better. A sporadically persistent feeling of guilt to soothe, a mere annoying itch to be scratched, mild curiosity to be satiated—IT’S MY FUCKING LIFE, BLAISE! EVERYDAY. YOU RUINED MY LIFE. YOU RUINED MY FUCKING LIFE. YOU TOOK EVERYTHING, BLAISE. HE'S EVERYTHING. I'VE LOVED HIM
Eventually he dragged himself to the shower, fully-clothed, red-eyed and heartbroken; he started the shower and drenched himself in freezing-cold water, because he hated himself, he hated his life, he loved Draco, he was in utter agony, his heart felt like it had died and was decaying and withering away in his body.
heartbreak, felt like a red burning-hot chunk of coal against his frantically beating heart, he wanted—
Although Draco hadn't spoken much to him, Harry was still delighted to be near him. Draco was so many things, Harry's mind was blown! He was such a cynical asshole to everyone, yet, so loving and kind to his son. . .and Nott. Draco's eyes would light up whenever Nott was mentioned. He spoke of him often, and so did Scorpius; Harry really hadn't wanted to hear about where 'Oncle Theo' was taking Draco and Scorpius next weekend. So naturally, Zabini picked up on Harry's discomfort and proceeded to tease Draco and talk about how
Guests Harry couldn't give a single fuck about, arrived, congratulated him, shook his hand, patted his back, smiled big enough their eyes squinted and crinkled—they didn't see him not smile back.
After some nudging that turned into pushing that escalated to shoving and threatening to poor coffee on Harry's back (far from Draco's clothes) Harry reluctantly let go, only to remember, that walking was for muggles and people who weren't desperately in love with Draco Malfoy, so he reached for Draco, apparating them directly to his bedroom.
As he crawled into bed and lay by its edge, the farthest he could get away from her, he remembered the day of his sorting - he should have chosen Slytherin.
-"Oh, yes. There was this weird illness around a few years ago, that made them go berserk. And people didn't want to use magic on them, since they already had magic of their own and the illness was unknown and at the time still untreatable, everyone feared making it worse. We had to work closely with the auror department and healers...it was chaotic." Granger sighed. She seemed happily reminiscing on what seemed to Draco a dreadful time. "Anyways. Don't get your hopes up. Nothing much happens anymore. We're all just slowly going mad." She added.
couch, the one Draco and him had cuddled on, on that faithful night Harry learned of Emma's existence, when Harry's greatest issue had been the indisputable state of unrequitedness of his love for Draco. Now, he'd give anything to just hear the sound of his voice.
Blaise Zabini snorted. Malfoy looked up at Harry, yet, he seemed to be looking down on him, judging him, judging him an unworthy and minor nuisance, he lazily or tiredly? Sneered and said "Pottah."
—You'd be an asshole too if your mother went through husbands faster than underwear—But that was Draco lying down there, looking more pale than the dead body next to him. One of Blaise's
They snarled at her. She was holding the currently empty envelope in one hand and a small paper in the other.
-"I don't know, Draco. I don't know what I am, what I'm going to do... I don't know anything anymore. But I
-"It's nearly midnight, darling. Let's go check up on everyone, have some champagne and fuck off when the new year begins." Draco said, ruffling Théo's hair. Draco didn't mind Théo's coddling, he found comfort in it; everyone of his friends was
Harry's heart was beating like it wanted out of his heart, wanted to jump out and into Draco's hands.
Harry shook his head because they were worse. The things he'd said! Oh Merlin! He'd been so sad, so wretched...
-"I love you," Harry whispered. "I love you," he reiterated. He said it again and again and willed his heart to stop aching. It didn't. Eventually he passed out. Heart-broken, stomach knotted, not really looking forward to tomorrow, for it would be just another day without Draco. Not in the way Harry needs him. Never his.
to 'move on'; while impossible to authentically replicate, the concept of moving on wasn't difficult to counterfeit. For his son. For Theo. For himself. The pity, pseudo-empathy on other people's faces, the
Ron pulled away and wrapped an arm amicably around Harry's shoulders, his fingers purposely digging painfully in Harry's flesh.
—he'd somehow love her any less. His stupid fucking brain trying not to auto-destruct. It only drove him to more pain and devastation!
-"Oh, Draco. I know. I'm so sorry. Is there anything, anything at all I can do? Anything. Please, just say the words. I feel terrible for what I've said to you in the party. I just want to get to know you but I'm clearly not doing great and I keep bringing up your dead wife—"
Harry couldn't believe it either. He didn't say anything and just relished in the feel of Draco in his arms, he refused to think of why, feel guilty or anything.
Lucius and Cissy Malfoy, were watching the whole thing with similar, amused expressions, reminiscing about their own youth.
Draco's mental faculties were slowed by Alcohol, but as soon as he somewhat understood what the fuck was happening, he clutched at his heart over his clothes and doubled over, resting his forehead against the cool table.
-"Wait." Granger exclaimed. She glanced guiltily at Scorpius and said in a rush: "Will you be staying long in England? Your reputation as a potions master precedes you. I know you were professor Snape's favorite. He was a genius and he must've taught you well. Will you consider helping at the ministry? We have a dangerous shortage of Potionners. The ministry is prepared to provide whatever you need. You can discuss the details with Blaise. He knows all about it."
-"I havent seen you in nine days and sixteen hours." Harry blurted out, immediately mortified, he slammed a hand against his mouth.
So when Malfoy'd finally locked gazes with Harry and seemingly unimpressed and without a hint of recognition in his silver-grey eyes, looked away, Harry had felt angry. Angry at being so carelessly dismissed and looked down on, because the truth is, after all this fucking
-"Are you alright?" Her voice was different. Her accent was different. Draco felt a wave of icy-cold terror engulf him. No, no, it's
He whispered a profanity and moved towards Draco, dropped down on his knees before him and clutched his legs.
-"My aunt and uncle love me dearly, you see. I haven't seen them in ages, but I promise Auntie Cissy I'll be back as soon as Cousin Helena's wedding is over."
They heard the sound of small feet thudding against the carpeted floors before Scorpius came into view. Draco leaped and scooped his son up in his arms. Both laughing delightfully and clutching tightly at one other.
He lasted exactly forty-five minutes before dashing off to see Draco; only to find him playing house with Hermione and the kids, along with whom, Draco explained, was the fortuitous person, Scorpius had chosen to join them for the day, seeing as Scorpius needed someone to be his unicorn, to get around, on account of him being Draco and Rose's Father and hence could not simultaneously be the family's unicorn and ride himself. Hermione had the honor of being Scorpius's gleeful wife.
Harry stroked his hair, back; kissed his forehead, temples, head; murmured soothing, loving words, held him tighter, breathed him in. Harry's soul, mind and heart, rejoiced at the close proximity. Draco felt incredible,
Harry hadn't seen Draco at all, not even once, like he was avoiding Harry too, or like he'd fucking quitted all-together. Which nearly made Harry go mad with fear; even though he was the one who'd left Draco, Harry felt paralyzing terror at the thought that Draco would leave him, hate him, give up on him.
He used a confounding spell on the bouncer to get in smoothly. On account if it being a Friday night, the club was packed to bursting. He navigated the swarm of bodies and tables, scanning his surroundings until his eyes landed on the most beautiful white-blond head. Draco. He pushed people left and right and caught up with them in time to see Emma, the Doppelgänger approaching them.
Kreacher who'd been trying to warn Harry, and seemed to be the only one on Harry's side, fixed up a quick dinner for all of them.
fondness for Harry that made him feel safe and accepted. Strangely, even if Draco judged him, which he did all the time, Harry didn't feel self-conscious or less, around him, like he'd used to as a kid. Maybe because Draco's often nasty indiscretions weren't meant any longer. Maybe because Harry loved him too much to resent him for anything. Maybe because after every time Draco would make a truly mean or potentially hurtful comment—always about the Weasleys—he would stare at Harry, challenging him to say something in return, gaze unwavering, unapologetic, as if to say: 'I am what I am, so are you still sure about this?'
The thought of scorpius was like a tiny beam of light in Draco's endless, starless, oppressive darkness.
Harry's heart slammed hard against his ribcage, his breathing grew rapid until he was practically panting, the knots in his stomach unraveled, the ache in his being lessened until it vanished all-together, goosebumps skittered over Harry's skin and he shivered and hugged Draco tighter. Harry couldn't deny the fulfillment, the
Then again, it could be that he was usually daydreaming and thinking about Draco Malfoy and consequently lost in his own thoughts whenever she spoke to him.
wasn't there with him - rendered anything and everything utterly meaningless and painful to live through.
-"She's going to be here any minute," Hermione was saying. "We all need to calm down! beating him up isn't going to solve anything! We need to get through the night, talk about this later, just the three of us. No one can know, okey? No one can know, Ronald—Merlin. She's bloody pregnant!" Ron gasped and fell down on his knees, his hands covering his face. "That's why she'd asked us all to meet here and check on Harry. She's intending to announce it to the both of you as a surprise. She can't know. We need to talk first! But we need to move, clean up
wasn't careful with his fragile, sickly father, that he would die too. Leave him too. And Draco couldn't, for the life of him, sit down and talk . . .
-"No, darling. You know how self-centered little boys his age are. I promised him cake and movie-time with his Auntie Pansy and he instantly cheered up. He didn't see you. We left him with Greg, freshly bathed and probably reading about homosexual unicorns." Narcissa said, directing a smirk Lucius's way after her last remark.

Now, the sunroom was usually where Narcissa spent most of her daytime. It was obviously sunny, and purposely near her beloved, flower gardens. But at night - it was

. But now that Narcissa directly spoke to him, he followed her and sat in the furthest loveseat from where they'd all been seated. Except they smirked at Harry as if they were on to him and ended up sitting in different seats, a half circle surrounding Harry. He gulped. Draco wordlessly handed him a drink of his choice to lessen his embarrassment. They all picked up on it and fucking laughed. To Harry's face.
-"I'm so stupid, Draco. And I'm really sorry for asking you to repeat yourself. So please, bear with me. Where are we going?"
So, the next day, Harry shoved away all his Gryffindor chivalry and principles and reminded them that he was Harry Potter, didn't they recognize him? He'd defeated Voldemort! When the house-elf on open-the-door-to-Potter-and-tell-him-to-fuck-off duty, for the day, merely stared at him unimpressed, Harry ground his teeth and blurted out that he was Dobby's friend. The house-elf's enormous eyes had instantly welled up in tears and he'd ended up comforting the house-elf for a good hour before she sputtered that she'd been neglecting her chores and ran inside, scandalized, leaving Harry by the door, alone, mortified and ashamed of himself for using Dobby's memory, yet no more closer to his goal.
-"Well, I suppose he wouldn't really mind if I sleep in someone else's bed really, we've talked about this and he doesn't particularly care for being exclusive—"
earth, and each person has their own version of Heaven and Hell. Harry didn't know nor care about everyone else's, but he now realized what he, Draco and Theo's Heaven and Hell were. Draco's Heaven was Astoria, his Hell was life without her. Harry's Heaven was Draco, his Hell was life without him. Theo's Heaven was Draco, his Hell was also Draco.
everyday. Draco didn't want him thinking back and presuming his beloved father was dying and leaving him too. So, Draco tried, he tried so fucking hard to see Scorpius, he'd drink plenty of potions, have Theo help him clean up and dress, plaster the biggest smile on his face and go see his son. He'd told Scorpius that he was brewing from home again so they didn't have to go to work, and that he was very, very busy, so he wouldn't be able to see Scorpius everyday or even every other day. He'd also said that Theo was helping him—because Theo had adamantly refused to,
He spit water from his mouth, put his toothbrush down and leaned fully against Théo's warm chest behind him.
Harry Potter's heart missed a beat, slammed agonizingly against his ribcage, shooting the blood through his body at a fantastic rate of speed. Every deeply-ingrained survival instinct in Harry's body and mind kicked in, triggering the release of Adrenaline in his blood. Harry's limbs juddered   from energy and sheer fright, his breathing shallow, his face sickeningly paled. Every cell in Harry's body screamed at him to run. Leave. Never turn back. Danger. Threat. Run.
His heart thrashed in his chest and the painful longing nearly made him implode. Draco was going to be the death of him.
Harry Potter was sitting in his cubicle in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, thinking about Draco Malfoy.
So endearingly sad. Poster-boy of every public-awareness movement against wizarding supremacism! The reason almost all Death-Eaters were let out..." Potter trailed off. He was panting. He seemed angry. Draco could tell - it wasn't about
-"I can't believe you made me come here tonight. It's new year's eve! Blaise and I have been invited to the ministry's party. Do you know how many gossip I'd have scrounged. What a waste. Everyone would be there." Pansy complained.
Theo dropped his cigarette, stepped on it and hugged Draco. He planted his head on Draco's shoulder and sighed. "Can't we just go home?"
Following silently, Harry watched as Draco Malfoy briskly walked down the empty, dimly-lit hallways, and slowing down when he reached a deserted hall with old, unused offices. Harry walked faster and managed to slip in with Malfoy through the door just as he shut it. Fuck. That was close. Harry mentally cheered again because he hadn't lost all his auror reflexes after all. Malfoy lit a few abandoned candles with a spell. It was a medium sized office, dark and grimy. Harry watched Malfoy looking around, '
-"I honestly couldn't be bothered, no one visits me here but you anyways," Draco stood up and moved around his desk, motioned for Harry to stand up and proceeded to transfigure the two chairs into a soft-looking, small sofa. "Blaise prefers to meet me and Scorpius outside, says he'd rather not venture into enemy territory—I'm sure you understand. Pansy's been doing Pansy-things, and Theo sees everyone here as beneath him, for good reason too, everyone
