Malfoy’s smile is wicked. “You have no fucking clue, Potter.”
“Can you bring it back, then?”
Sure enough, when Malfoy’s finger strokes over his hole, it’s wet with lube. Harry jumps, the small touch sending sparks ricocheting around his body. A palm strokes up and down his back, as if trying to soothing him.
Harry doesn’t respond. Instead, he puts his hand on Draco’s knee, and keeps it there.
Draco pulls his hand away and clears his throat again, looking awkwardly away. He can’t stand for Harry to see any more of his weakness.
Potter clears his throat. “You know, speaking of what you like. Do you, um. Do you want to actually do that thing you said?”
“Then why have you been so…” he trails off, making a vague gesture with his hand.
“Is this about young Draco?” asks Molly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Athis bows. “No charge, no charge.”
“Do you like that? Do you want to be my own personal fuck toy?”
Harry’s eyes are wide and still a little wet as he levitates Jones through the hallway, to the front door, and chucks him onto the doorstep. Draco’s smile is grim as he looks down at the man, his trouser leg soaking in a puddle.
“Fuck,” says Potter, voice scratchy. “Is it always like this?”
We'll be back to Harry's POV next chapter, and then mixing it up from there on. No additional warnings in this one, it's actually a very wholesome chapter.
“Yep. We’ve known each other since we were eleven,” he says.
“I try to be,” he said.
“Yes,” breathes Harry. “Do it, please.”
Harry’s face goes red.
“Once he drew a picture of me being hit by lightning and gave it to me during class,” Harry smirks at how outraged his teenage self had been at the time. “The drawing was quite good, though. It definitely looked like me.”
“Is he being good, then?”
Malfoy slams his glass down on his table, in a show of mock rage. “Compared to a Weasley? I have never been more insulted in my life.”
Draco could, as well. There are hundreds who would kill to even see this, let alone be in his place. Not that he would ever do it. Obviously, he doesn’t need the money, but even if he did, he would never betray him like that.
“Well, if you can fix wards, what about making them? You could build them for people.”
He collects Earl for his walk, trying to make enough noise to let Granny know he’s taking him, but not so much as to disturb what sounds like an intense appointment. The bell is loud as ever when he swings he door open to step outside, and while it muffles the sound of the shutter, nothing can hide the camera flash. Herbert lowers his camera, grins maniacally, and disapparates before Harry can make good on his earlier threats.
They turn around, and realise that while a good number have dispersed, some have started to press their noses against the glass. Their eyes dart between Harry and Draco, and a with a dawning sense of dread, he realises that this will be in the
His eyes somehow become darker and softer at the same time. “Speaking of, let’s avoid doing it here. As exciting as exhibitionism can be, Arthur Weasley also has access to the manor, and I don’t think either of us want to include him.”
Draco cocks his head and hums thoughtfully. “I think they would feel extremely supported and grateful if you would find something to do, preferably in a different room, so that you stop giving me miniature heart attacks by constantly bending over to pick things up.” He shakes his head in exasperation. “Either you forget that you have a wand to do these things for you, or you’re determined to drive me to distraction!”
Hermione nods, understanding. “It’s a wizard then?”
Draco sighs, and stares into his glass. Looking into the fathomless green of Harry’s eyes as he tells him this can only make it more overwhelming. Nervously, he licks his lips.
“Has no one been here since the war?” Harry asks.
“Yes, really, but I do have two conditions,” he says. “One: you can’t ask about the actual sex. That stays between Potter and me. Two: you can’t tell him what I say under compulsion. That stays between you and me.”
“It’s Potter again then, is it?”
They sit in silence for a while, matching his breathing to Potter’s own measured breaths. Draco slots his fingers into the divots of Potter’s ribs, stewing in joy and self-recrimination. Is this what it would be like? If Potter wanted him for more than sex, if this were a real relationship, would he have this every day? He doesn’t want to break the silence. He doesn’t want to remind Potter who’s holding him, that he doesn’t belong here.
“One house white, one cider, one Spitfire. Got it.”
“It’s right there,” says Samuel, nodding over his shoulder.
“So, you saw it,” says Potter, mumbling into Draco’s collarbone. “Do you believe me now?”
Draco could tell him that
“I hear you and Granger are friends now,” he says, rescuing Blaise.
“I can understand that, but I didn’t have any control either. So why don’t I want that too? Why do I want to-”
Additional warnings in the end notes.
Harry wants to whine at being denied, being teased, but he knows he’s supposed to be quiet. He wants to be good. He can be good.
Potter reddens a little. “Can you do it? You can probably reach better.”
“I was effectively a muggle for three years, Potter. Muggles don’t have house elves.” His voice is impatient, but still mild. Clearly their truce is still in effect.
“Don’t pretend!” he shouts. “Don’t pretend you care when I know you’re only doing it for her. She told you to help me, because of the fucking life debt, but I don’t want you to.” He swallows, and gets to feet, looking down on Harry. “I don’t need your pity, Potter.”
Jones goes stiff and straight as a tree trunk and, arm still outstretched, tips flat onto his back.
“You talked,” she repeats, voice sceptic.
“Alright, darling?” asks Draco, kneading at his arse.
“Good,” says Draco sharply. “I kept my end of the deal, Weasley. Make sure to keep yours.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
It rumbles in his hand. Harry traces the engraving with his thumb, and opens it to see the clock inside. Its workings are exposed, the intricate mechanisms visible. “It’s beautiful.”
Simi opens the door to what must be their bedroom, leaning out to yell at Draco where he’s putting bottles in the fridge.
They shuffle upright, Draco’s arm around his shoulders, supporting his head. This time Potter holds the mug himself, his hands steadier than before. He tries to drink too fast, and some water escapes and runs down his chin.
Dinner is both better and worse than Harry expected. Better, because there are no outright arguments or explosions. Worse, because he can feel the bubble of silence around Draco, everyone but Arthur and Molly doing their best to pretend he isn’t there. Better, because he’s sat next to him at the table, and he can nudge his leg against Draco’s in quiet support. Worse, because at one point his hand drops to Harry’s thigh and it makes him spill gravy down his jumper.
Harry sinks further into him, feeling cradled and finally relaxed. His anxieties about what they plan to do don’t disappear, but they grow distant and unimportant. He’s not listening to them anymore; he’s much more interested in what Draco has to say.
He shakes him off and reaches for Harry, and Draco just snaps. He whips his wand through the air, casting a swift and silent
“I hope I’m not interrupting anything, I just brought something for Teddy,” he says, holding up a parcel.
In reality, it’s very unlikely someone will hear them. There’s no reason for anyone to be in this part of the Manor. Unless, of course, they also plan to have earth-shattering sex with their partner who used to be their fuckbuddy who used to be their nemesis. Still, that small kernel of doubt is both dangerous and exciting, sending a wriggling little shiver up his spine.
Harry freezes. He can feel panic setting in. All of a sudden, he needs Draco
He makes a small, desperate noise, and Draco grips his hair harder in reply. He’s spent years of his life imagining the texture of Potter’s hair under his hands, but he never thought he’d get to have it. Now he has that and so much more. It’s still not enough.
“I didn’t think it would actually respond to me,” he says.
He kisses the tears away from his face, never ceasing the steady pendulum of his hips. Draco continues to whisper sweet nonsense to him, cradling his head in one large palm and holding up his leg with the other.
Draco sounds almost hurried and much less posh than usual as he says “Okay, bye.”
, Draco ties his wrists to it.
He climbs into her living room and plonks himself down on her squashy sofa. He grabs a red cushion that reminds him of the Gryffindor common room and holds it tightly to his chest. “Either I’m losing my mind, or I want to kiss- Someone I never thought I would want to kiss.”
“You know, you don’t have to call me Potter,” he says, the strength returning to his voice. “Obviously you can if you want, but- you can call me Harry. I think we’re probably on a first name basis, at this point.”
“We will need your help though, Harry. The Manor needs some restoration before we can get the Centre up and running.”
Thank heaven for small mercies.
“You dick,” he says emphatically.
Harry flicks him on the arm as he grabs his wand from the bedside table.
He lets out a nervous giggle, and Ginny waltzes off to the fridge to find a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.
“Yes.”
“Your niece?” repeats Harry incredulously.
Afterwards, Harry falls asleep. He’s not sure if Draco does too, but he’s lying beside him when he wakes, playing with his hair. It’s this moment of easy peace that gives Harry the courage he needs.
“Sorry, I forgot.” Harry grimaces, and tries to change the subject. “What’s for breakfast?”
“I know,” sighs Terran. “But honestly I think it helps. You were calm, you weren’t flipping out.”
Harry’s not really sure what he’s on about, but he’s happy enough to let it go. He’s about to smile politely and resume his quest when the man squeezes his arm in a friendly, familiar sort of way.
Harry rolls his eyes and just kisses him again.
Draco lets them in with his own key, striding off to the adjoining kitchen and calling out for Simi. Harry pauses in the doorway, taking it all in. Draco’s old flat is small, but well loved. The building itself should probably be condemned, and the furniture had ‘seen better days’ about ten years past, but there’s no mistaking the warmth. Not literal warmth, as it was actually freezing, but personal touches that made it seem like a home. The overgrown cheese plant in the corner, the static muggle photographs spilling over every surface, the herbs growing on the kitchen windowsill. In a way, it reminds Harry of a cross between a Neville’s plant-filled house and the Burrow.
He reels Harry back in. Minutes are lost in the press of lips and tongues and hands. This time, it is Malfoy who pulls back.
she slashes her own in a harsh, spiralling movement. Draco doubles over, and falls to the ground.
Despite his pronouncement that Draco was going to be fine, Harry’s still himself worried. If he’s going to save Draco’s life, then it has to be in danger in the first place. Granny suggests she read Draco’s cards, if it would put Harry’s mind at ease.  As soon as he leaves the shop, Harry finds himself apparating in front of Malfoy Manor’s gates. He’d caught a glimpse of it yesterday, over the high brick walls of the orchard, but only from a distance. He hadn’t been inside since the night Dobby was killed. The night Hermione was tortured, Draco refused to identify him, and Harry took his wand. That night was the final nail in Voldemort’s coffin, though it never really felt like it.
But Harry is looking at him. He pulls back, not all the way off, just enough to hold the head in his mouth. Then he sucks hard. Malfoy curses and pulls him the rest of the way off, before covering his own dick with his fist. Clenching his jaw and tipping his head back, Malfoy comes into his hand.
Draco folds his arms, trying to hide his trembling. Whether he’s shaking with anger or trying not to cry, Harry can’t tell. Maybe both. “Then what was it like?”
“Actually, he was singing your praises,” says Harry.
The man leaves, and Granny wheels out behind him. “Just wait a moment, dear,” she says to the woman, “I’ve just got to speak to Harry for a bit.”
Harry breathes a sigh of relief tinged with pleasure. Draco stands and moves towards him, but still doesn’t touch. He feels greedy for him, desperate for Draco to kiss him, reassure him. Still, underneath the frustration there is a layer of…something. Maybe he enjoys being teased, or maybe he just knows that Draco enjoys teasing him; he knows he enjoys giving Draco what he wants.
Draco keeps quiet, looking down at him as if wondering where this was all coming from.
“I thought we did talk,” he says, taking a sip. It burns, as always, but after the burn is the distinctive honey-sweetness.
Draco seems to collect himself a little more, removing his fingers and reaching for a wand. He casts cleaning charms over them both, and settles back down, stroking over Harry’s skin like a nervous pet.
Potter licks at the dildo as if it were real, distracting him from his reverie. Draco pushes it forwards, so he doesn’t have to strain his neck to take it in. Potter swallows it down, throat bobbing as he swallows his spit, his mouth watering. Draco taps the toy with the base of his wand, keeping it hovering in position.
“No, let me pay. If you didn’t charge every other person who came in you’d never make any money.”
“I’ll make you some tea,” he says, flicking his wand and setting the kettle to boil.
Harry smiles, reaching out to touch Draco’s hair like he’s wanted to ever since that day in the orchard. Ever since the memory he used for his Patronus. The one that belongs to Draco. He closes his eyes and presses his face into Draco’s neck. Another yawn pushes its way to the surface, and Harry tries to fight it down.
“Wait,” Malfoy pales. “Are you-”
He holds out his hand and, tentatively, Harry takes it. He side-alongs them to a bedroom that looks like it’s seen more recent use that the Edwardian era, and pulls Harry to sit with him on the bed.
He hoists Harry’s legs over his shoulders, bending him in half, past the point he thinks his body can physically go. He fucks into Harry in one go, before holding still. Kissing Harry, open mouthed, he catches Draco’s moan with his tongue. He’s buried deep inside, unmoving, and Harry tries to grind back onto him. Draco scrapes his nails up the back of his thighs, against the grain of the dark hair, leaving red lines behind.
His bottom lip tickles the shell of Harry’s ear. “You know I can be careful.”
“You can come over, Malfoy, you’ve seen it all before.”
Harry watches him drum his long fingers anxiously against the ceramic of his mug, and takes another sip of his own tea. He imagines those fingers wrapping around his wrists, pinning them down. Leaving a bruise. He was telling the truth earlier, pain doesn’t really interest him, but the idea of Draco leaving a mark on him does.
“Then we have no reason to think that he will. However, if you would like more clarity, there are ways of achieving it,” says Granny. “I think its time we start your training.”
“Yeah, we came together.”
Harry swallows hastily. “Not to Arthur.”
She nods. “So why did you want to know? Is this girl you want to kiss-“ Ginny’s eyes widen. “Wait. It’s a boy, isn’t it?”
“Oh,” he says, biting his lip in embarrassment.
“Then yes, okay,” he says, leaning back down to rest on Draco’s shoulder once again. “Yes, sir,” he corrects.
“What do you mean you’re in love with him?” asks Ron, leaning forward in his chair. “We are talking about the same person aren’t we?”
“Undetectable extension charm,” says Draco, pulling the handle of a plastic carrier bag out of his back pocket, before tucking it in again and holding his hand out to Harry. “Shall we?”
The World: Achievement, Fulfillment, Completion.
Hermione looks back down at her glass. Ron had turned it to white wine, instead of its original red. She shrugs and takes another sip while Harry lifts the lid back off the pot. Hot steam billows out, fogging up his glasses, and causing him to yelp and stumble back. Hermione splutters with laughter, wine snorting out her nose.
“Yeah.”
He nuzzles his nose into Harry’s neck, breathing him in. He follows the same path with his mouth then, just brushing his lips over skin. Harry sags into his arms, letting out a low hum. He smiles, and he knows Harry can feel it against his neck. Draco licks a deliberate stripe up the cord of muscle, before resting his teeth gently either side of the muscle. Harry shivers. An image flashes in his mind, of a hunting dog Pansy had as a child. Its job was to retrieve the birds the hunting party blasted from the sky, and her father scolded her for treating it like a pet. Nether the less, they liked to take her out with them as they explored the grounds of Parkinson Hall. Once, the dog returned from the undergrowth with something held proudly in her mouth. It was a chick, unharmed and cheeping, held ever so gently in her teeth. Draco smirks to himself. Who ever thought he’d be comparing himself to a dog, subconsciously or not?
know him?”
“Eloquent as ever,” snorts Malfoy. “Before yesterday, when you sucked my dick
He rocks back on his heels, pausing, before stepping confidently forwards and into the shower. “Yes, you gave me these scars. No, you don’t need to fall over yourself apologising; I’m not interested in a masochistic tit for tat of who hurt the other worse. May we move on?”
Only a third of the soot is cleared from the wall studded with windows, and night air floods into the room, making Harry shiver. He rolls up his sleeves, and casts with a brutality that surprises even himself. Before long he is sweating, and at first he doesn’t notice the figure watching him from the doorway.
When Harry was twenty-five, he met Terran Jones. It was at Ginny’s birthday party, and she’d invited all her teammates on the Wasps. His mother had a degenerative illness, so he had asked to be home-schooled, rather than leave her for months at a time. Terran wouldn’t tell him that until months later, however. At the time, Harry only knew that he didn’t recognise him from Hogwarts.
Harry stretches. “I don’t know, I liked it. It made me feel- weird. Good weird.”
“So, Terran broke up with me.”
Harry guiltily displaces the sleeping dog from his lap, and stands. “Fancy some lunch?”
Malfoy doesn’t voice his agreement, but he also doesn’t object to the use of ‘we’. They make an unlikely pair of tour guides. As they go from room to room Malfoy recounts it’s original use, and whatever damage has been done to it, while Arthur gives his ideas for what it could be used for. Harry then explains how the necessary changes could be made. Malfoy is quiet, not speaking more than he has to, except the occasional quiet jibe. Although, they are never directed at Arthur. He seems to be on his best behaviour with him, and Harry gets the sense that he is holding back his harsher comments about Harry on his account.
Draco raises one eyebrow. “What do you call that, a friendly peck on the cheek?”
She motions for Draco to make space for her on the sofa, sitting down and placing his head on her lap. She runs her fingers through his hair, and it’s like they’re fifteen again, like nothing can touch them.
He disapparates back to Grimmauld Place without saying goodbye.
Ron wipes red sauce from the corner of his mouth, and waits for Harry to continue.
“Well, I’m not. Though I doubt you’ll take my word for it.”
“I’m sorry, darling.” Draco murmurs into Harry’s hair. “I’m so sorry.”
“I’d have joined the bloody Order of the Phoenix if it meant you’d let me fuck you in sixth year.”
Harry recounts what he can remember, from finding Granny on the floor to blacking out. She listens intently.
Millicent leans further forward. “You didn’t have to obliviate someone every five minutes, then? No offence, Draco, but you’re terrible at blending in.”
“When’d you do that?” asks Granger, her normally clipped voice blurring at the edges a little. “It wasn’t on Sunday.”
Just as Harry’s amused smile tips over into a smirk, Draco catches his eye from across the room. His face momentarily relaxes into something fond, before straightening into a stern frown. Draco stalks towards him, and the decorator takes the opportunity to scurry away and hide before Draco remembers his existence. He raises one perfectly groomed eyebrow, and Harry feels a spike low in his belly. It’s basically a Pavlovian response, at this point.
“I know we’re going about this a bit backwards, but do you want to have dinner with me sometime?”
Draco furrows his brow, and Harry finishes making the tea. He sits down and watches as Draco’s hand hovers over the milk jug and sugar bowl, before adding copious amounts of both. Finally, Draco speaks. “I’ve thought about it, you know. Doing it for a living. But if we’re being realistic, no one’s going to want to hire me.”
“But what about-” starts Harry, before cutting himself off. There are so many questions, and at least some of them Granny has the answers to, but he can’t say anything in front of the Healers.
“Do we? We didn’t say much to each other.”
“Then hurry up and get it over with,” says Draco, casting his eyes to the heavens.
“I thought it was exaggerated,” Draco says quietly. “The rumours about your aunt and uncle.”
“I don’t think that’s how it works,” he muses. “There’s no limit to pain. You can always feel more.”
Malfoy’s smile turned a little more genuine. “I didn’t read it for Teddy, I read it for me. It’s charming.”
“Yes, hello,” he says, shaking his hand.
Potter makes an impatient noise, and Draco pauses, looking down at the man lying beneath him. Potter’s definitely in subspace. He didn’t start this with the intention of putting him under, but there’s no doubt that he has. Quite likely, he never fully came out of it in the first place.
His mind tumbled down the stairs ahead of him, racing to meet the stranger before he’d even set eyes on them. Perhaps it was a long lost relative, come to claim him? Perhaps they were the one who sent the letter? They must be an odd sort of person, to have sent a letter via owl, but Harry didn’t mind. If they wanted him, he could put up with any eccentricities with a smile. They may not be as rich as the Dursleys, but if they’d come looking for him then they surely must be kind. He was well into imagining his new life with this newcomer when he knocked on the door to the parlour and entered the room.
“Beautiful, darling. So good, letting me fuck you after you’ve already come. You just love it that much, don’t you?”
“It got a lot better after Hogwarts, then they mostly just ignored me.”
He can tell Ron’s getting angry. For some reason, Ron gets a little overprotective when it comes to Harry and men. Hermione would say it’s a combination of subconscious misogyny and homophobia, but sometimes he could act like Harry was a little sister who needed protecting. Not that Ginny needs protecting, but he supposes that’s what Hermione means. Harry doesn’t entirely agree with her assessment, but he doesn’t really disagree either. If he’s being honest, he doesn’t mind it. It’s nice to have someone care that much.
“Sometime I’ll take the time to undress you properly,” he says, punctuating his words with a kiss. “But right now-”
Draco’s kisses are slow and languid, as if he has all the time in the world. They stay in that same position, Harry nestled in his lap, just kissing, for a long time. Harry starts to move a little, grinding against the hardness underneath him, but his position gives him little leverage.
. His large hands move up from his thighs to pin Harry’s hips to the bed, and he sucks him in again. Harry doesn’t know why, maybe it’s just too much too fast or maybe he’s just broken, but it starts to happen again. He starts to slip away. His eyes don’t move from where they’re fastened to the ceiling, the fleur de lis patten shifting in and out of focus. A sharp sensation brings him forcefully back. How long has it been? Terran already has three fingers inside of him, lying over him on the bed with Harry’s right nipple in his mouth. Harry jumps.
Ron and Hermione sit at the kitchen table drinking the wine they’ve brought, breathing in the fragrant coconut-sweet steam coming from the pot on the stove. Hermione looks tired as ever with her stressful Ministry job, but not unhappy. She’d swapped her sensible kitten heels for sandals and her suit trousers for jeans. Ron seems more grown up than ever. He’s come straight from an afternoon shift at W
If Malfoy’s groan is the gravel that skins your knee, then his words are the fall that comes before it. “That’s it, good boy. Show me you like it.”
Draco hums noncommittally.
Now that he’s really looking at him, he can see the beginnings of fine wrinkles around his eyes, the tight set of his mouth.
“Harry dear, do come in,” she says, wheeling herself back through. “Thank you for returning my Earl to me. He doesn’t get as many walks as he would like now that I’m older, so he tends to wander off.”
Simi must agree because no one says goodbye, and he thinks he hears the upwards lilt of a question.
He rummages through the fridge and finds a leftover sausage, breaking off a piece small enough for her to swallow. He sets her to perch on top of the fridge while he grabs a pen and paper.
“It doesn’t feel like the War’s over,” he says. “It feels like I’m still there, in the middle of it all. How can I focus on a happy memory when I’m holding my wand, and all I can think about is everything else that wand has done? What I’ve done.”
He pulls out Malfoy’s dick. It’s normal. It’s a penis. A relatively nice one, as they go, but he doesn’t feel the usual fear he associates with them. He breaths a sigh of relief, and the air must ghost over it because suddenly Malfoy’s hand is moving up to clutch at his hair. Something sparks at the base of Harry’s spine. He moves one hand to hold the base of Malfoy’s cock, and the other to press Malfoy’s fingers harder against his skull. A wordless request. He must understand, because his grip grows tighter.
In moments like that, he could forget he was bored. He could pretend that his thoughts didn’t stray to messy hair and green eyes. He could pretend he didn’t want to apparate to wherever Potter was and pick a fight with him almost every day, just so that he would look at him again. Maybe even hit him. That would be better, that would mean touching.
“That’s the nostalgia talking,” says Jake.
Lying in bed, Harry stares up at the ceiling. He has just had sex for the first time. With Draco Malfoy. And it was
Simi’s mother was an odd woman, though well meaning, and she was convinced Simi and Draco were a couple. Several times Simi gave pitch perfect renditions of the speeches their mother gave.
Grabbing his wand, he summons a dildo. Not one of the biggest but definitely a mouthful. Draco holds the plastic head against slack lips, not pushing it inside- letting Potter decide if he wants it.
“Sorry,” he whispers.
Harry scowls and folds his arms.
Malfoy shakes his head. “That’s not the point, Potter. It’s not normal for you. From what I’ve gathered, it’s a pretty massive fucking deal for you.”
It feels like a small victory. Harry strokes Bunny’s ear tufts, and unfastens the letter from her leg.
Harry pulls back panting, face alight with a grin, for just long enough to gasp “That means ‘I love you too’, if you were wondering,” before crushing their mouths back together again.
Granny smiles sadly. “And you did find it.”
“Hermione, I love you. You’re my beautiful, genius, phemom- phenonimal-” Ron mouths the word to himself for a moment, but still can’t figure it out. He shrugs. “But you don’t understand; Harry
Blushes are easy to detect on skin as pale as Draco’s, and he’s definitely blushing now. “No Potter, I missed that one.”
“I actually think I’m in love with him,” adds Harry.
he thinks.
“Okay,” says Tabby. “You’ve all seen
Trigger warnings: mild violence.
“Do you want me to suck you?”
Draco looks dazed. “What?”
The clinical answer is that it’s the right thing to do. No one, dom or sub, should participate in a scene unless they’re prepared to perform the necessary aftercare. However, that’s not the whole truth, and it’s not what Harry’s really asking.
Draco manoeuvres him off his lap so he can systematically strip Harry of his clothes, before pulling him back down to straddle him. His naked dick is trapped against Draco’s fancy clothes, and the thought of it being neglected while Draco does what he likes with him makes him squirm in humiliated pleasure. His hands are once again wrapped around Draco’s neck, and he knows he has to keep them there. Harry tries to steal a kiss, but Draco pulls him back by his hair.
“French toast and bacon,” he announces.
“No, that’s what it’s called. At least, we always called it eggy bread.”
Harry sodding Potter, indeed.
“Oh, god.”
His left sleeve. Harry wonders if he’s showing him the Mark on purpose, and if so, why. Is he trying to push Harry away by reminding him about his past, or perhaps he’s making himself a little vulnerable too, to even the playing field? He knows Draco too well to think it’s merely a coincidence.
Before he can even contemplate the answer to that question, Zabini drops down into the seat next to him. He’d left briefly to take Draco home, and Harry takes a moment to wonder if he’s alright. Draco had seemed unusually ruffled when he’d left.
When Harry was nineteen, he went on a date with a witch who’d gone to school at Durmstrang. Hermione had set them up, after they’d met at work. He’d hoped his notoriety wouldn’t have reached her there, but he’d been wrong. She barely said a word all through dinner, and when he asked her if something was wrong, she asked him to go back to her flat. Not feeling much interest in her beyond her dark hair and grey eyes, and not wanting to lead her on, he declined.
Malfoy’s hand is warmer than he remembers from his dream, and his grip is firm. Now he isn’t shielded by a baby, Harry can see how much he’s changed. He’s wearing a shirt and slacks rather than a robe, white sleeves pushed up over strong forearms. His blond, almost silver, hair always used to be slicked fastidiously back. Now it hangs loose, falling into his eyes.
“Came straight from the pitch,” says Terran, stealing another quick kiss. “It’s been days since we’ve seen each other for more than five minutes.”
Harry gives a self-deprecating grin and lop-sided shrug. “It was my idea.”
what you took from this?” asks Draco incredulously. “Of course that’s not what I’m saying. In the past week I’ve drunk more cups of tea than I have in my life, just because you made them.”
Harry swallows, his thoughts going in an indecent direction. Draco’s voice is teasing, and his mouth slips into a sly little smirk that makes Harry glad he’s already sat down. “Whatever you want.”
“What did you expect?” asks Harry, banishing some stray clutter into a draw. Asking him to come for lunch was impulsive. Draco was such a tidy person, and having him see his house without warning will only show him how different they are.
“Does that feel nice, darling?” His voice is dark and dirty, like smoke.
When he wakes, Draco is kneeling over him. A voice in his head that sounds a lot like Granny’s says that there’s been enough kneeling over unconscious people for one day, in dreams or reality, and this better be the last of it. He thinks he might mumble something to that effect, because Draco sighs in relief. He sits up. A few feet away the young woman is bound with an
“Tea?” ask Harry, blindsided. Sitting between them are two mugs of half full, still warm tea already. Still, there’s no accounting for an old woman’s idiosyncrasies or her obsession with the magical and medicinal properties of bergamot. The most confusing part is that the only time she had ever let him so much as touch the kettle was when she was ill in bed.
“That’s better.”
“Well, it’s the same fight it always is.”
Draco snorts. “Sorry. It’s just that at one point, I’d have said that thinking must be a new pastime for you. Funny how things change.”
Looking in the mirror, Draco makes a face. He’s completely wrecked. Draco’s shirt is crumpled, matching the deep creases in his trousers from where Harry gripped them. His hair is mussed, strands sticking damply to his forehead. One of his earrings has fallen out, and his lips are red and swollen.
“What did you think we were on about?” she asks.
“Good morning. Are you going to let the demented creature in, or are you conducting an experiment to see if its possible for a ghost to develop a headache?” she asks, her mouth set in a thin line.
“No,” says Harry, shaking his head vehemently. “It’s the same every time, and its of something that hasn’t happened yet.”
His eyes drift down to the curve of Potter’s mouth, just as the pink of tip of his tongue pokes out to wet them. Draco rushes forwards and kisses Potter with a lack of finesse that would embarrass him if he wasn’t so lost in the softness of those lips. The bottom one, in particular, vexes him like nothing else. He nips and sucks and nibbles on it, wanting to turn it red, wanting to make it
Harry scoffs. “That wasn’t a flashback.”
“I was so stupid,” insists Harry, chewing his lip.
“What’s this?”
Harry nearly chokes on his drink. “It’s so weird to hear you say ‘dick’. I thought you’d call them something weird and posh.”
“I really don’t remember much from doing this in school.”
For their first date they went flying. Obviously, Terran was a professional, but he was also a beater. They played a seekers match to even the playing field, and Harry won two out of three matches. He never admitted it to Terran, but he let him win the third, because he was starting to look embarrassed. The sun lit up his hair, and his grin lit up his face when he caught the snitch, and so it was worth it to lie just a little bit. When they were tired and ready to go home, Terran kissed him again. Properly, this time. Harry steeled himself, and resolved to explain about his problem before it went any further, and hoped he would understand. Before he could, Terran pulled back, and asked if they could take things slow. He’d had a string of high-profile flings followed by a one-sided attachment, and he wanted to settle down and take his time. He liked Harry, and he didn’t want to ruin it. Harry had rarely been that relieved since the end of the war.
Trigger Warnings:
Harry groans. “If you keep asking who it is I’ll give you the gory details, and then you’ll be sorry.”
They nod, but don’t yet speak. Harry strokes Earl’s ears like a child with a comfort blanket, Draco’s spine is stiff, and Granny’s niece ducks her head guiltily.
Potter yawns into the pillow, mumbling something inaudible.
Malfoy’s wearing a muggle suit, pitch black shot through with pearlescent grey, and clearly the height of sophistication. It was probably hand tailored. Harry makes a mental note to tell on him to Narcissa. Andromeda goes to put her arm around Malfoy, and lays a tasteful arrangement of orchids next to the daffodils. Malfoy lays his head on her shoulder in an uncharacteristic display of vulnerability, and Andromeda whispers something Harry can’t hear.
Draco sighs. “I hate tea. But I love you.”
She hands him a mug full of amber liquid, the steam smelling of ginger. “This should help.”
Draco continues. “Do you remember what I told you about meeting my friend Simi, and learning about BDSM?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Someone is knocking at his bedroom door. “Harry? Are you awake?” Hermione turns the handle and pushes her way in. “It’s nearly midday.”
The outside is addressed to ‘Potter’, and he immediately realises who it’s from. Malfoy did say he would send him his address, even though Harry had never said if he’d come. He blushes, and flicks the note open just enough to confirm its contents, before stuffing it in his pocket.
“You did so well, so well.” He squeezes Harry’s arse before dipping two fingers back inside to feel his own come.
She sighs. “I married a Muggle. Or at least I assumed I did, when they moved me up here. Bob and I were already planning to elope when I sat for this portrait. My mother told my father to destroy this too, but he didn’t have the heart. ”
Draco’s smile is amused but not unkind. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed you have a submissive streak a mile wide.”
The first people to arrive are a couple in their thirties called Jake and Tabby. Jake looks mild, average, and when Harry tried to make small talk with him, he learns he’s an accounts manager. Tabby has a shaved head covered in floral tattoos and wears a long yellow dress. She works as an art therapist and is currently writing and illustrating a children’s book. Privately, Harry marvels at their being together.
That is not what he’d expected. “Um, okay.”
Then it clicks, and he walks Potter backwards into the wall of books. Crushing him into the shelving, the wood must be digging into Potter’s back, but his gasp doesn’t sound pained. He leans into him, letting him feel his weight, and Draco wonders if Potter can feel how hard his heart is beating where their chests are pressed together. Stood together like this, Draco can really take advantage of the height difference between them. It’s not dramatic, only a few inches, but enough that he can give the impression of looking down on Potter. What was that silly thing he’d said? That he wanted to ‘have his wicked way with him’? Well, he certainly feels wicked now.
Harry’s chest aches. Not out of jealousy, or love for Ginny, but happiness. Two more of his favourite people are happy, and in love, and that was what is was really about. That was what he fought for. So people could live their lives in peace.
Draco winks at Angus. “A likely story.”
“Saved?” repeats Hermione.
Draco’s answering smile is predatory. “Do you remember your safeword?”
“I’m fine,” he says, looking up at him. Malfoy was about to come, and he was still thinking about Harry. Again, that incongruent word pops into his head.
“How did I not know this?” splutters Ron. “I should know this!”
Draco rumbles a laugh that he can feel against his back. “That’s not exactly hard, Potter. You only have to draw terrible hair, a speccy face, and a scar on your forehead, and it’s the spitting image.”
“Then it’s honestly no wonder you used to shut down when it came to sex, if you were that touch starved. It must have been overwhelming.”
Harry can’t remember what Draco’s agreeing to.
When Draco comes back to the present he is trembling with rage. He grips the edge of the desk, trying not to show Potter just how affected he is. He mutters under his breath, holding back the tidal wave of abuse he wants to fling at Potter’s ex by the skin of his teeth. That’s not what Potter needs right now. He needs Draco to stay calm.
“It says you can see the future, and you’re working here. There’s a lot of wild speculation, but that’s about the size of it.”
Drizzle finds its way past the collar of his jacket and down the back of his neck, but he’s thankful for the rain. Nice weather for ducks, as Arthur would say. Or nice weather if you want to be left alone. The park on a Saturday would be packed if it had been sunny. As it is, there’s just a man sitting on a bench by the lake, staring at his shoes, while his dog barks incessantly at him. He doesn’t look up, even as the small dog tries to bite his trouser leg, but instead its snout goes straight through. Harry comes closer, and the dog turns to growl at him. It’s a miniature dachshund, its coat a dappled grey. The man is similarly coloured, and now Harry is directly in front of him, clearly a ghost.
A finger crooks against just the right spot, and Harry makes a noise high in his throat.
Harry wobbles, nearly falling, before he grips the top of the ladder and regains his balance. He cranes his head round to glare at Malfoy. “Give me some warning next time. I don’t want to get skinned alive falling onto a cursed rocking horse, or whatever else you’ve got up here.”
The address engraved onto the tag is in Diagon Alley, and leads him to
“The Grim.”
Ron gives a smug looking grin. “It’s nearly her birthday, so I just tapped my nose, and told her she’d find out soon enough.”
Draco pulls Harry up by his hand, and levitates the woman’s struggling body ahead of them. He winds his fingers through Harry’s, not letting go even once he’s standing. They hurry into the shop, the door kicking at the dropped bell where it lies on the floor.
“Yeah, yeah,” he says, waving a hand. “I’m lazy, I’m arrogant, and you hate my hair. I’ve heard it all before. Will you come back to bed now? You’re making me cold just looking at you.”
“It’s elusive, you don’t know for certain where it’s going to be. Sometimes it’s luck, sometimes it’s instinct. It’s always worth it though.”
He sucks in another sharp breath, and closes his eyes. It doesn’t stop him from seeing it, replaying over and over, like a wizarding photograph. The same movement repeated over and over in a loop.
Trying to escape from these thoughts, he kisses Draco again. The kiss is small, almost shy, testing the waters. Does he still want him, after seeing him cry? Draco makes a soft noise, and kisses him back. He meets him with the same tentative questions on his lips, his tongue, as he licks into Harry’s mouth. Draco pulls their hips flush.
He lands on a bedroom floor, the same bedroom he was just in, though of course it doesn’t hurt. He’s not really here.
Draco nods coolly. “Weasley.”
“I need to, um. I’m sorry, but I’m, er, going to have to go a bit early today.”
Harry offers his hand. “Malfoy, good to see you.”
“Not terrible, my dear. Merely inconvenient,” answers a woman’s voice.
“So how did you know?” he asks.
Harry rights himself, Draco lets go, and Molly springs into action.
The day his three years living as a muggle were over, Draco Malfoy cast a patronus for the first time. It was a stag. He’d known it would be, of course, but it still wasn’t pleasant to have it confirmed. The memory he’d used was of when Simi had thrown him a surprise birthday party, about a year after they’d moved in together. He hadn’t thought about Potter at all. Still, he hadn’t forgotten him. Part of the reason that he chose the patronus as his first spell was because he’d always been so pissed off that there was yet another thing Potter could do that he couldn’t. So, he’d sat at the end of his single bed in his tiny flat, and watched the stag prance around the room. He had to sit on the bed, because there wasn’t room for anything as superfluous as a chair. Their flat was a bit of a shithole.
Once again, Harry spent the night in his cupboard. Mrs Figg looked shad a thoughtful look on her face as she locked him in. Later, Harry would wonder if she had known what was about to happen. For that was the last night he ever spent in that dark and dusty space – though it was not the last he thought of it.
He apparates into the alley behind the pub twenty minutes late. On time is early, when it comes to social functions. Or so his mother always tells him. The Huntsman’s Hound is busy, a muggle pub with low beamed ceilings and an old-fashioned atmosphere. There are paintings of dogs on every wall, some old and expensive, some new and amateur, and all exceedingly ugly. The one by the entrance looks more like a cow, but if he has to hazard a guess, he’d say it was a beagle.
“Found you!”
Harry and Ron burst into very unmanly giggles, and eventually Hermione succumbs to laughter as well.
His mind turns to Draco. He’s lost everything, everyone. He still found the time to visit Luna and apologise. Harry jolted upright. Luna. If there was ever anyone who’s outlook on life was refreshing, if not the most down to earth, it was her. He goes to the fireplace and flicks his wand, igniting a blaze too warm for the summer evening. Taking a pinch of glittering green powder from the pot on the mantelpiece, he throws it in. The fire turns a deep emerald, and the heat cools to something bearable. Harry kneels down and cranes his head into the flames.
They pick their way through the detritus, careful not to touch anything questionable. As Harry touches the glass handle, the door melts away, and the opening widens. Big enough for two men to squeeze through, if not walk comfortably. Circling his wand, Harry extends the
Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to Draco apologising. A unicorn is probably born each time it happens.
Harry turns in the circle of his arms and drops roughly to his knees. His kneecaps smart against the cold floor, but he barely notices. He takes Draco’s cock out and swallows him down without preamble. He’s gotten a lot of practice at this since that first time, and he only seems to enjoy it more each time. Maybe it’s because he always learns a new way to make Draco’s hiss out a curse, or the increasing ease with which he fits more and more into his mouth. Maybe it’s the way he’s gotten used to the bitter taste, so he can actually appreciate having yet another of his senses taken over entirely by Draco. Maybe it’s the way he feels so vital and wanted, on his knees in worship. It’s moments like this he can believe Draco when he says he’s beautiful, precious,
“Still, I want to apologise,” he says. “I shouldn’t have said…what I did.”
Malfoy just keeps looking at him, compelling him to continue. In the dim ballroom, the breeze cooling his hot skin, it doesn’t feel real enough to have consequences.
“I’ll believe that when I see it.”
“Sort of.” He shrugs. “Yes.”
“Tabitha,” says Draco. “I do believe you have just ravished your man in a cupboard.”
Is this it? Is this where Harry lets him down gently? Because
Granny halts her shuffling. “Everyone who comes to me is uncertain in one way or another. I can’t offer them certainty. I will never claim to be right a hundred percent of the time- but I can guide them onto the right path.”
Broomstick-Apple-Fight, while unimaginatively named, is at least straightforward. The players fly through the Malfoy Manor’s orchard, pelting each other with fruit, until someone falls to the ground. That, or they run out of apples.
The baby threatens to cry, and Malfoy joins him in looking over the crib. The soft hitching breath turns into a happy babble at the sight of his face.
This is the second time he’s called him by his first name, and both times it was when Harry was being a nutjob. It’s nice. He sort of wishes he’d do it more. Then again, he’s only called him Draco during sex, so they’re probably even.
“Potions accident,” says Draco. “It was brewed wrong and we inhaled the fumes. Harry arrived and found us all unconscious. He vanished the cauldron and called St Mungo’s, but he’d inhaled too much leftover gas and passed out himself.”
“I know you can take care yourself. That doesn’t mean you should have to.”
Harry almost squeaks around the fingers in his mouth, before they’re pulled away. He uses the wet fingers to rub around the rim of Harry’s hole where the base of Draco’s dick is sliding in and out.
“We’re back here,” calls Harry.
“Want you to-” Harry starts, before interrupting himself with a groan. “Want you to fuck me like this.”
He prepares the tea according to her simple but thorough instructions, and places them on the table next to a book titled ‘
His leg pushes between Harry’s thighs, making him gasp. “What do you need, darling?”
He steadily drinks his whisky, answering questions. Potter doesn’t join in, but he doesn’t move away either. Draco knows he’s listening, tracking every micro-expression out of the corner of his eye. Potter’s drinking fast. It’s only beer, and only his second, but if he keeps going at this rate he’ll be bladdered by the end of the night. It looks like he is still broken up about what he saw in the paper, and he’s trying to drink it away. He presses his thigh more firmly into Potter’s, feeling the heat of him. Reminding him he’s there.
Harry holds himself back from saying something rude and uncalled for. “I’ll take her. How much?”
“I dare say if you studied every book ever written, you would not find an event just like this one. The circumstances are so unique,” she says.
All at once, he realises what he’s just done, and who he’s done it with. He stops moving, he almost stops breathing.
“Why isn’t everyone a wizard, then? It’s the same difference,” says Harry.
It’s actually a little early. Most people won’t arrive for another few minutes at least, but he knows if he waits any longer, he’ll talk himself out of going at all. So he throws the powder into the fire, watches the flames turn green, and screws his courage to the sticking place.
Draco hadn’t moved out right away. He was used to living without magic now, and he liked living with Simi. They were the best friend he’d ever had, and paying rent was hard enough with two people. Although, it had been easier to hide that he was a wizard when he didn’t have a wand. Every time the boiler broke, they had to scrape together the money to fix it, because the landlord never got around to it. Then, he would think about how easy it would be to cast a quick
The cat prods at Draco’s chest again, and thinking she’s trying to tell him something, Harry gently rolls Draco onto his back. She hops onto his chest, curls into a ball, and begins to purr. Harry runs his hand over her back- trying to encourage her, trying to comfort himself.  He can’t actually touch her, but she’s deathly cold. The heat from his own body leaks into her, fuelling her like coal in a furnace.
He raises one eyebrow and taps his nails on the cover, and Harry see he’s painted them an understated peach colour. Harry doesn’t know any other men who paint their nails, and it manages to be unbelievably elegant, ballsy, and sexy all at once. A lot like Draco himself.
He furrows his brows, and casts his mind back to his years at Hogwarts. “I thought only poltergeists could move things.”
“Does it make you happy?”
He sits alone in the same slightly sticky booth as last time nursing his beer and his bad mood for over an hour. Eventually Draco sidles, as elegantly as possible in the circumstances, into the opposite seat. Neither spoke at first, Harry staring into the bottom of his glass and Draco squinting at his face.
“Okay, if you ever want to eat, you’re going to have to sit back down.”
Draco tenses behind him, but doesn’t comment. Harry swivels in his lap so he’s sat sideways, where he can look at him. He doesn’t want Samuel’s attention; he wants Draco’s. The last time he sat like this it was just before Draco was inside of him, peacefully reading a book. Then, he’d made a game of withholding his attention. This doesn’t feel like a game.
“Hermione?” mumbles Harry, his eyes still closed.
“Please, you were so easy to wind up it took barely any time at all. Only about a fifth of my waking hours were spent coming up with ways to destroy you.”
He thinks of Teddy. He thinks of his colour changing hair and his love of ducks. He thinks of his hatred of parsnips and his big blue eyes. He thinks of the joy and he terror that comes with holding a child in your arms and knowing you would die for them. “New beginnings,” he says.
has never spelled anything good before. He doesn’t have anything to write with, or even paper. Looking around the floor, Harry picks up two pieces of rock from the rubble, and transfigures them into a quill and ink. He turns the note over and writes on the back.
Draco and Narcissa lock eyes, and the colour leeches from his face. “Mother?”
Luna looks at him appraisingly, moving a little closer on the bench seat. “You and Harry seem friendly.”
Potter hides his face more completely in the pillow, abashed, until he has to strain to hear him. “I miss you. I miss you inside of me.”
In a daze, Draco kisses back. Part of him wonders if someone has slipped him a
Then, the man took a great breath, as if building up to a Shakespearean monologue.
Harry grins, then frowns just as quickly. What can he say that both doesn’t involve magic, or dredge up horrible memories for both of them?
Hermione grips his shoulder. “Are you sure?”
and I broke up ages ago. Besides, she’s with Luna now.” says Harry, emphasising her name.
“Thanks,” he croaks.
“Did you know that during the war, Lupin came to visit me at Grimmauld Place?” Draco looked surprised, but just shook his head, so Harry carried on. “Yeah, Tonks was pregnant with Teddy and he ran off to tell me that he was going to join us and help kill Voldemort. There was a fight, a bad fight, and he admitted that he was scared. He was scared that Teddy’s life would be worse because of him.”
“I’m fine now,” he says. “Harry healed me.”
Malfoy laughs. “Don’t be a moron, Potter. I get to pop the Chosen Cherry, and have fun doing it.”
He wanders over to the pocket watch he’d seen on the shelf. It’s definitely the one from his dream.
“I wasn’t calm, I wasn’t anything!” snaps Harry.
Harry lowers his eyes, retreating further into Draco, who only holds him tighter.
“Narcissa, I have to ask you a favour.”
Ron starts to laugh, but seeing the look on Harry’s face, stops just as suddenly. “Are you serious?”
“Hello, Harry! It looks like rain so we’d better head inside.” As gets closer, Arthur turns to Malfoy. “The roof is intact, isn’t it?”
Remembering the woman who’d ran out only moments before, he flies to his feet, and out of the shop. Earl will have to look after Granny while he's gone. Surely the attacker must be gone by now, but he has to at least try and catch her.
Bless that clever and beautiful man.
Millicent looks as if she’s plotting deadly revenge, and if he didn’t know how much genuine comradery and affection there was between them, he’d be concerned for Blaise’s welfare.
Harry looks up at him, surprised that he would tell him this. “What did you call her?”
Potter takes him further down, the head pushing at the entrance to his throat. He presses his palm harder on his own dick, not rubbing, as if he’s trying to stop himself from coming too soon. He suckles and swallows around him, deep as he can go, the movements back and forth becoming shallower.
It was at this moment that Aunt Petunia swept into the room, her pastel skirts rustling around her.
“I’m not surprised,” counters Harry. “Yours always worked well for me.”
The heron flies away with his message, and his eyes fall back to Draco where he lies twisted, half on his side. His eyes have closed. The ghostly cat sniffs his face, her whiskers twitching. She rests one paw on his chest, over his heart.
“I love you,” he continues. He keeps his voice low as if trying not to spook him, and he can barely hear himself over the ringing in his ears. “I’ve loved you for so long I can’t remember what it’s like not to love you. You have no idea precious you are, and not just to me. You deserve everything, everything-”
Hermione just hums, looking at Harry speculatively.
Draco looks down at the memory spooling at the tip of his wand with something like reverence. He clambers off of the bed and pulls on some pants, before striding over to the pensieve. The memory drops into the bowl. Looking back at Harry just once, before turning away, he lowers his head into the swirling liquid.
“And what’s that?” wonders Andromeda, her curiosity piqued.
Harry groans and sinks further under the covers. Hermione walks over to the window, stepping over piles of dirty clothes, and opens the curtains. In her crisp skirt-suit, hair wrangled into a braid, she looks every inch the professional.
“What happened?” he asks, his tone stuck halfway between insult and concern.
“Is everything okay?” he asks.
the lucky one, that Harry can do better, and then obligingly set him up on a date with a gorgeous acquaintance who never thought it was a good idea to stick a Dark Mark on their arm. He could, but he won’t. Instead, he gives in and kisses the beautiful man in front of him again. No one’s ever called Draco Malfoy self-sacrificing, and he’s never been so glad to be selfish.
Her voice is gentle as she prompts him. “The baby?”
“I’m not going to lie, Harry, it’s not what I pictured you doing,” says Ron
“What do you mean ‘I don’t’? You don’t know that.”
Ron leans back and sits up straight so fast his chair almost tips back. “No thanks, mate. Actually, I think I might just pretend you’re still a virgin, for the sake of my sanity.”
In the end, it’s Simi who shakes
“Maybe you have brain poisoning,” snorts Ginny. “Don’t be stupid Harry.”
Malfoy continues. “So, you’re scared of topping. That doesn’t actually mean you like the idea of getting fucked. Tell me Potter, what do you think about when you touch yourself?”
Draco nods at him, and looks him up and down as he enters the hall. “What’s up with you? You look all…tidy.” He sniffs. “It’s unnatural.”
“I’m a terrible person,” he moans.
Wednesday night looms, thrilling and imposing, on the horizon. He’d received a note from Potter, the night before. It read:
“Harry,” he says, brows furrowed. “Did
Draco runs his fingers over his torso, so light that it feels like feathers on his skin. “It’s alright, you didn’t know. Let me tell you the rules now, so it doesn’t happen again.”
“I’d imagine it has something to do with the fraught confrontation with your shitty ex, impromptu and vigorous sex on the floor, and the long hot bath.”
“So what happened?” asks the nervous trainee.
Samuel’s smile is charming. Predatory. “We tend to haunt the same establishments.”
Harry just closes his eyes, taken over by Draco’s casual, proprietary handling of him.
It won’t take much. The energy that’s been coiling inside him ever since Malfoy asked if he trusted him is so tightly wound that anything could set it off. He wraps his hand around him and strokes him fast. He buries his head into Malfoy’s shoulder, eyes squeezed shut. There’s no lube, and it’s dry, but the head of his dick is rubbing against the silk of that stupid fancy waistcoat, and then he’s coming all over it.
“I didn’t expect it to hurt this much,” she says, shaking her head. “I hadn’t seen her in years, and I’ve lost the people dearest to me in the world; it should be a drop in the ocean by now.”
“I’m sorry, darling,” she whispers, shaking her head. She pinches her brow in concentration, and this time when she tries to moves Draco’s hair away from his brimming eyes, it moves with her. “You need to be with the living, or you’ll start to wish you were dead.”
get in the way of our relationship.”
Ron grunts. “So, he’s still a dick to you then. You think he’d be grateful. I mean- you save his life, keep him out of Azkaban, and now you’re fixing his house.”
Harry places his hand on the wood. “These used to move.”
“I need you to help Draco,” she says, her eyes snapping back to Harry’s. “Promise me.”
No matter his misgivings about his own body, the brief flare of humiliation soon fades. Draco is always effusive with praise, especially in bed, and is quick to make Harry aware whenever he finds something new he loves about Harry’s body. So, while he might call himself scrawny, he knows Draco doesn’t see it that way. Draco loves how easy it is to pick him up, to manoeuvre him how he likes, how he can pin Harry down and cover him entirely. His hair might be messy, but Draco loves to run his fingers through the thick curls and Harry loves the feel of him doing it. He loves when Draco pulls on it. Several times he’s been pulled aside in public, a heated whisper in his ear telling him how frustrating it is that he always looks freshly fucked, and how tempting it is to make that a reality.
Fuck. He’s going to have to think fast. “He’s not out to anyone yet, so I don’t think I should tell you.”
“I’ll shut
“Then you know she died in my home, in Malfoy Manor, and I didn’t do anything to help her. I know I can never make up for that, but I thought that turning the place she died into something that would continue her legacy, that might have made her smile. I used to make her smile, you know, when I was eleven and cute enough to make up for being so annoying.”
“Well then, it would make me very happy if you’d stay. You’ll stay for me, won’t you?” Molly’s eyes are narrowed; she knows exactly what she’s doing. No one can fight Molly’s mother-henning for long, let alone someone so unprepared and committed to politeness.
Harry is just about to suggest that they continue another day when Arthur can join them, suspecting that the buffer of Arthur is the only thing stopping them from devolving into a shouting match, when Malfoy speaks.
He strokes Harry’s cheek with his knuckles, but doesn’t look at him. “Oh, he’s being a very good boy, so patient for me.”
Ginny looks down into the mug clasped in her hands, and smiles softly. “Yes. We haven’t said anything yet, but I think soon. She goes on her expedition in two weeks and I don’t want her to leave not knowing I love her.”
Harry whines, and Draco nibbles at his ear. Harry considers refusing, but he’s too far gone to be proud. He needs Draco inside him.
“You know,” points out Hermione. “Xander Pixberry might have more catches to his name, but  Camen King hasn’t been around nearly as long, and has nearly as many.”
Harry hits his chest with the back of his hand. “You know that’s not true, you’re just trying to wind me up.”
“I…didn’t know babies could become ghosts.”
Ten of Cups: Loving Relationships, Alignment, Harmony.
“Maybe.”
“You know,” says Malfoy. “It’s debatable whether or not you’re still a virgin, given that we never actually shagged.”
Draco shudders, remembering the ensuing chaos, and the true terror of teenage girls.
“Do you want another drink?” he asks, already rising from the table. “This is too strange to get through sober.”
’ The punchline, however, eludes him.
It’s hard not to think of him as Harry, when he’s squinting up at Draco without his glasses, eyes puffy with sleep. But he set his own rules, years ago, to cope with loving Harry Potter. Avoiding his first name was high on the list; it denotes an intimacy Draco doesn’t deserve.
“To be fair, it’s not like I’ve been hiding that I come here. I just don’t think it’s news.”
Harry gasps. It feels like there’s a buzzing under his skin, causing liquid to bead at the tip of his cock. He’s never felt anything like it. Draco’s tongue is almost rough, his skin so sensitive he thinks he might be able to feel the tastebuds. Harry wriggles, overcome with a potent mixture of bliss and embarrassment.
“It’s only Beatrice if you admit that she’s your owl,” he says.
“No,” says Draco.
Draco undoes his belt and pulls out his cock. With his hands on Harry’s hips, he lifts Harry up to hover over him. He wants Draco inside him, but he tries not to move until he’s told to, tries to be good. Thighs trembling with effort, he waits. This time Draco doesn’t say anything, just searches his face, as if looking for any sign of stress or reluctance. Presumably seeing none, he eases Harry down.
“Well,” says Draco.
“We don’t drink this stuff to enjoy it, nor do we want the image distorted by the shape of the mug,” says Granny. He nods vigorously as he listens, committing it to memory. He can hear the kind smile in her voice as she continues. “Though I suppose this sort of thing is what you’re here to learn, after all.”
“We don’t have a relationship. You broke up with me, remember?”
“Has it happened to you?” he asks.
is it? Should I bring anything?”
Hermione whacks her husband in the arm, but he can’t say she looks pleased to see him either. Polite, and oddly curious, but definitely not pleased. Fortunately, Molly and Arthur look delighted, and Harry gives him a sheepish smile.
Draco slides his hand up Potter’s neck, enjoying the line it makes, the vulnerable softness under his chin. He’s at Draco’s mercy, and this time it’s by choice. Then he undoes Draco’s trousers, and he remembers that he’s at Potter’s mercy, too.
Simi’s calm voice pops into his head, reminding him what to do in situations like these, when his anxiety takes over. He takes a fortifying breath, halts the movement of his hips, and takes objective stock of the situation. Potter is relaxed, but still responsive. That means he’s not panicking or dissociating. He asked Draco to do this, he’s consented every step of the way- enthusiastically. Simi’s voice is loud and clear in his mind, repeating the phrases they’ve drilled into him over the years.
He’s saved from further interrogation by Millicent and Blaise, who sit down in Potter and Finch-Fletchley’s vacant chairs.
“Yes, sorry again. Bye.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” says Millie. “Spill the beans.”
“It could be fun. I had a few fantasies back in the day I wouldn’t mind trying out.” Draco’s tone is offhand, but there’s a tension in his voice he can’t hide.
Granger frowns. “But Harry didn’t go in yesterday, he came over to ours after he saw the paper.”
“Yeah, that might be it,” he concedes. “I still want you, though. I always do.”
The crows erupts into noise, vaulting so many questions at him he can’t hear a single one. He pushes through to the door, where he turns round to address them. “Quiet!” he calls, trying to conceal his impatience but still needing to be heard. “Can somebody, and by that I mean one person, please tell me what’s going on?”
And it’s true. He might not have thought it in so many words, but he’s envied him in one way or another since he met him. Envied him for his comfort in a world which was once so unfamiliar to Harry. For a mother who sent him chocolates every Friday morning. For knowing his impossible and intricate family tree all the way back to its roots, and all the history and tradition that comes with it. For his freedom. The freedom that comes with knowing who he is, and who he wants to be.
“I doubt it,” shrugs Draco. “I think the problem runs a little deeper than chocolate can fix.”
He wraps one arm around Harry’s chest and puts the other at his hip, just like when he fucked Harry on the kitchen table. Harry pushes his arse backwards, into Draco’s erection. “Squeeze your thighs together, darling. I promise I’ll fuck you properly later.”
Malfoy hums, watching him carefully, and Harry’s muscles clench even tighter than they were before. What was he doing talking to Malfoy, of all people? He hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione and here he was spilling his guts to a man who was more likely to step in them than to help put him back together.
“I’m not attracted to Malfoy, Ron.”
“That’s okay,” says Harry. “I saw it nearly every day for years. It’s much better now though.”
“Show me?”
Draco settles down into the seat next to Harry. “Everything alright?”
Aside from the dent in the bell, Granny’s shop looks like nothing has changed. Except for the woman sat in Harry’s purple armchair. He glares, pettily conjuring two more, identical chairs. First she stuns Granny, then she tries to steal her most treasured possession, and finally she curses Draco. No. Finally, she steals his chair. She better have a good explanation.
Zabini looks startled into the fire, then into his wine glass, then back at the fire. “Potter, is that you?”
He spreads his hands expansively, determined not to show his distress. “Well then Weasel, ask away.”
. Only Harry is speechless. The racket doesn’t stop even as they descend on the table, Arthur looking a little alarmed.
Before he can come up with an acceptable answer, Potter appears at the table, clutching a glass of whisky and a too-full pint of beer to his chest. He places the whisky in front of Draco, and looks around the room. The only free space is next to Draco on the bench seat.
, and as much as that thrills him, he knows it isn’t right. Harry didn’t mean to make a statement like that, he didn’t know any better. But fuck, it was about as obvious as wearing Draco’s collar.
“In the end, the facts are these,” says Granny. “One: our memories are powerful enough to influence the present. Two: love can be used to save someone from certain death, as happened to Harry as a baby. Three: Harry has some power over the dead, the limits of which we don’t yet know. From there, we can only draw our own conclusions.”
“It’s actually muggle. If it stops working just tell me and I’ll change the batteries.”
Draco kneels down next to the bath and rests his folded arms on the side. He’s left his hair loose, without any of the product he sometimes uses, and it’s already starting to curl from the steam. Harry wants to touch it, but his hands are wet, and Draco would probably tell him off.
Potter drops in beside him before he has a much of a chance to ‘shove up’, shoulders pressing together and their calves bumping under the table. Draco holds his glass out to clink against Potter’s and takes a slow sip. It’s sweet and smoky on his tongue, and he hums in approval.
“No, not today. We can try again, but just not now.”
“Is Roberta your owl? She’s cute.”
“So,” says Hermione. “Malfoy.”
Then Malfoy’s hands are back at his hips, spinning him around to face the table, before a hot palm presses down on the middle of his back. The surface of the table is like ice against his overheated skin as he lets his forehead fall onto the wood. Out of the corner of his eye he can see a whisky glass, still half full.
“Exactly. Glad you’ve come to see it my way.”
“They store the electricity, which is sort of like their magic. Muggles put batteries in things to make them work, but they run out and you have to replace them.”
Malfoy flicks the switch. “Better keep it off for now then, or we’ll use up all the magic.”
“It’s different!”
Draco frowns. “I can barely understand how you can want me at all, let alone love me. I know you’re stupidly selfless sometimes Harry, but you don’t have to say you love me because you think I want to hear it.”
They are upstairs, in what used to be a private area of the house, but was no longer used by the family by the time Malfoy was born. Or so he says, giving a dispassionate monologue about the history of the rooms. Malfoy opens a door, and gestures for Harry to go in before him. He frowns, suspicious of the polite behaviour, but goes in anyway. Inside is a nursery covered in dust. The ceiling is faded, but a painted canopy can still be made out. Suddenly, a whimpering sound comes from the old crib. Harry rushes over, and sees a baby. Translucent, wearing layers of frills and a lacy bonnet. A ghost.
“Beautiful,” murmurs Draco.
“I don’t know,” he says. “Sometimes I think he must do. Other times he’s so unbelievably dense I think a herd of Erumpents could stampede right past him and he wouldn’t notice a thing.”
Malfoy’s face falls. He opens his mouth, and closes it again.
Potter opens his eyes, staring up at Draco and moaning so that he can feel it.
“Can you tell me what I did wrong?”
References to past child abuse/neglect, vis-à-vis the Dursleys.

in school.”
“You have it, then?”
Potter hums an affirmation.
Draco lowers his head into the pensieve, and then he’s falling, falling, falling. He’s only done this once before, when he’d had to submit memories for his trial. It wasn’t something he’d ever wanted to repeat, but the fact that Harry wants him to is enough to sway him. Harry Potter wants
Before they have a chance to catch up, Tabby cajoles them into joining her, Jake, and a shy looking boy on the lumpy sofa and mismatched chairs. Apparently, there’s a debate she wants them to weigh in on.
Draco raises his eyebrows. “Is that so?”
Potter tilts his head, paying close attention.
“What did you get?” he asks.
“Yeah. Yeah, thank you,” he mumbles, eyelids heavy and fighting not to close.
Draco’s heart stops. He tries to say one of the many other reasons why. All true, all part of his reasoning, but none are the whole truth. He can’t wriggle out of it; the potion compels him.
He runs the tip of his sharp nose down the length of Harry’s cock, and then licks back up. Harry cradles the back of his head with both hands, massaging into his scalp. Capturing the head in a dirty kiss, using his tongue like he would on Harry’s mouth, he holds Harry’s gaze.
Harry smiles. “I thought I was ‘Potter’, now?”
“Thanks for telling me that,” he says. “Your dad sounds like he’d get on with my Uncle Vernon. He was always saying stuff like that.”
Harry shouldn’t be listening to this. He picks up Earl and backs off to sit on the waiting room sofa; he feels a sudden curiosity to see what Celestina Warbeck had revealed about the reason for her third divorce exclusively for
They apparate into a dark alleyway, and Harry shivers in his thin jacket. Draco pulls the bag fully out of his pocket, and produces three more bags of bottles from inside, handing one to Harry. The glass rattles ominously, and Harry has to rest a hand underneath so the handles don’t snap under the weight.
“We all liked Terran, even if we didn’t always agree with how he went about things, but I’m not sure.” Hermione tilts her head. “If a stranger could help you feel comfortable enough to do something you’ve been struggling with for years in one night, and Terran couldn’t in almost a year, then maybe Terran just isn’t the right person.”
“No need. I’ve been reading your cards for weeks,” she says.
Harry sighs, and watches as the Healer disapparates with her patient. The trainee offers her arm to Granny, and they side-along together. Draco and Harry are alone. After all the mess that’s happened afterwards, that misjudged kiss seems like weeks ago, but it all comes rushing back to him now.
He’s not even sure what he’s asking. Is he asking him to stay for the day, the night, forever? He’d know what he’d like, but it’s not his place to ask for that.
Draco trails off, and he knows exactly what he’s talking about. When Draco told him about his teenage fantasy, and Harry rode him for the first time.
“I was,” he says. “The boys started on about it in the locker room. I came straight here.”
“Why?” he asks. “We were finally getting somewhere.”
When he returns, the shop is quiet except for the gentle clinking and whistling sounds of Granny making tea. He unclips Earl’s lead, and follows him into the back room. Earl wiggles his whole body like he hasn’t seen he in years, not less than an hour. Granny goes back to the tea, and Harry sees she’s not using her usual tin, nor the one with the loose leaves. This time it’s a jar, and the mixture inside is a muted purple. He sits in the armchair, waiting for Granny to start talking; as usual she seems to have a particular topic in mind. She places a cup in front of him, but doesn’t appear to have made one for herself this time. The brew has a dark plum hue, so deep as to almost be black.
Ron groans. “Don’t remind me.”
“And you’re not to call me Malfoy. If I’m going to have you screaming my name, you’d better call me Draco.” He tilts Harry’s chin up until their lips brush. “Do you understand?”
Yes, dinner goes well. It goes very well indeed. They talk and laugh well past the time they’ve cleared their plates, until they’re moving into the living room, wine glasses in hand. Harry has his legs tucked up under him on the sofa, his knees pressing into Draco’s side. They’re listing closer and closer together as the night wears on and the wine bottle empties, voices softening and lowering with the light.
He rushes forward. “Are you okay? Are you ill?”
“No.” Harry shakes his head. “It’s too complicated. You’re working with Arthur, so we’ll see each other all the time. It’ll be awkward. And I’ve only just broken up with Terran, I should take some time to get my head on straight, not rush into anything”
Now that he’s mentioned it, Draco is a bit chilly. He’s still just in his pants from last night, and the old house hasn’t warmed itself up yet. Guiltily, indulgently, he gets back under the covers.
Draco nods. “Tonight, then. Come to mine at seven o’clock, and don’t be late. We’ll need the whole evening.”
Tabby throws her hands up and looks at the boy. “See Nick? It’s just you. Everyone else thinks he cut it off.”
“Granny will know what happened,” says Harry through a yawn. “Granny knows everything.”
“I know. Andromeda asked me to come, I hope that’s okay?”
He moves his hand from Malfoy’s hair to clutch at his shirt, whining at the lack of skin. His hand moves faster over Harry’s dick, then he rubs his thumb over the head right at the same time as he nails his prostrate, and Harry is done for.
Harry’s heart beats so fast his chest hurts. Does he trust Malfoy? A few days ago, he might have said no. Yes, he’d spoken up for him at the trials. Yes, he’d saved his life and vice versa. But, trust him? No. After that tour the other day, when Malfoy told him about being a lonely child, reading stories to a ghost he pretended was his sister. When Malfoy apologised, in his stilted, formal way. When he said he would always argue with him, instead of lying and pretending there are only calm waters between them. Harry can trust that person to be exactly who they are, and he doesn’t think that person wants to hurt him anymore.
Harry sighs. “You should go back. There’s nothing to do about it now.”
“Draco?” parrots Ginny incredulously.
“The more you work with them, the easier they are to recognise. For most people they’re just an energy, a feeling you get when you enter a house. For houses as old as this one, as old as the Manor, they develop a sort of sentience. They react to your presence.” Draco leans back in his chair. “The wards aren’t as dark as when I was here last, but they could do with some work.”
Simi grins the evil grin of someone about to thoroughly humiliate their best friend. “You should have seen what his hair was like when I first met him. He had it all slicked back; it was so uptight. I have pictures. Draco won’t let me put them up, but I’ll show you.”
Malfoy takes him at his word. Harry’s nails scratch lines into the table as he pushes in, so slow Harry thinks he might have gone again after all and time has become distorted. But no, he can’t have done, because Malfoy’s breathing faster than ever into his ear. He bottoms out, and pauses for a second, before laying his hands over Harry’s on the table. Somehow, Harry understands what he’s asking. He laces their fingers together, proving he’s still there. Malfoy sighs, and pulls out, before thrusting back in with a smooth stroke that drags a moan from Harry.
“Well Harry,” she says, with a wry smile. “Welcome to the club. New members get wine.”
“Oh sweetheart, you need this don’t you?” he croons. “Once wasn’t enough, one cock wasn’t enough. You really were made to get fucked.”
Apparently Blaise is the Designated Disapparater, because he’s nursing a coke with a bewildered expression, eyes going back and forth between him and Potter.
“Then why did you hurt Draco?” interrupts Harry.
“Are you sure?” checks Draco, his face twisted in curiosity and disbelief.
Draco rolls his eyes and takes a muggle debit card out of his wallet. Honestly, it’s kind of amusing how people assume he still knows nothing about muggles.
“True,” says Draco, a sly look on his face, before lowering his voice. “Do you remember that time we…”
Lying there, sticky and uncomfortable with his head on the kitchen floor, Harry catches his breath. Draco is a solid weight above him, platinum hair tickling his face.
“Growing up?” echoes Draco, arching an eyebrow.
I've edited the layout since I realised I'd messed up how the notes worked, so hopefully the warnings should be in the right places now. I'd love to hear from you, this is the most explicit thing I've ever written so some feedback would be especially appreciated!
Harry’s eyes flick back to large bed and he can’t help blushing. “Is there anything else I need to look at or are you just fucking with me now?”
“Besides,” adds Ron. “If you had your way it would be called P.U.S.S or something.”
“Letters?” repeated Narcissa. “So he’s written again?”
“Draco?” whispers Harry. He sounds like a child at a sleepover, checking if their friend is awake.
“It’s hard. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I ended up here and I never looked back. There’s only one thing I would change.”
They go inside, the warmth of the fire hitting their cold skin. A few old men at the bar nod at Malfoy, one raising his glass towards him. A ghost in a flat cap sits on one of the stools, but the muggles don’t appear to see him.
“French toast? I don’t think I’ve had that. Is it like, normal toast with snails or something?”
Draco makes a soft, helpless noise, and presses his leg between Harry’s thighs. “Is this okay?” he asks.
Draco glances up at Harry from where he’s sitting. “She’s been burned off the tapestry.”
“Mostly vodka,” answers Draco, before continuing. “It’s only a minute’s walk from here, so we won’t be carrying them long.”
His hand is resting on his leg, and centimetre by centimetre, Harry moves his little finger to brush against Draco’s own. Letting the chatter wash over him, Draco forces himself to stay calm, furiously trying not to pin all his hopes to one little touch.
Harry hums.
“Come on then,” he says, holding out his expensively clad arm.
Ron leans forward, intrigued. “Do
The ghost continues to stare at his shoes.
“You’re not. I asked for this, remember?”
?” He waves his hand airily. “You can barely see the scars.”
Since they’re still quite far away, and the gate is already loose, he lets himself in and starts walking to meet them. Arthur waves a hand above his head. Once he’s in hearing distance, he starts calling to him.
“Come upstairs,” he says, scratching at Potter’s scalp.
“Stop!” shouts Harry.
Draco scoffs. “It’s you, Harry. It’s always news.”
Dudley brandished his prize. “He had a letter, Mama. He says it’s his, but no one would ever write to a poor and dirty orphan like Harry.”
Malfoy shakes his head slightly. “Look at you.”
Millicent elbows him in the side. “Blaise,” she hisses.
“What?” blurts Harry.
He shrugs a little, nearly shaking Harry’s head off its perch. “Fine by me. Are you sure I can’t get you a new boiler while I’m at it? It could be an early birthday present.”
“What?”
She’s still frowning but she doesn’t push it, god love her. They make it through dinner, and Draco makes his excuses, Molly pushing leftovers into his hands before he goes.
Harry steps back, already apologising, and looks at the other man. He’s handsome. About Harry’s height, but much broader. His grey eyes are very close to Harry’s own, framed with subtle laughter lines.
The room seems to paint itself into life around him, brushing him back into the present. Harry clutches tightly to his hand, and when the silence lasts longer than a few seconds, Harry lifts it towards himself to press a kiss to his knuckles. So sweet. So kind, even after being reminded how much of a brat Draco was, how much of a coward. Harry just rests his cheek on the back of Draco’s trembling hand, his skin warm and dry, and looks up at him. He wonders what Harry sees. Now that he thinks about it, his face is likely streaked with tears, as his cheeks are itchy with salt. He hadn’t even realised he was crying.
Luna smiles, and stands. “I’ll leave you to catch up. I have a feeling this seat will be needed soon, given that swarm of nargles at the bar.”
“Feel better?” asks Draco, worry lining his eyes.
Draco raises his eyebrows, but chooses not to comment.
“But calling you Harry’s so odd, and you call me Malfoy.”
Draco nods gravely. “And the vodka.”
Harry sighs. “Why don’t you show the rest of the place, and then I can tell you?”
Unable to wait any longer, Harry reaches between his legs and strokes himself at a brutal pace. He releases Draco from his mouth, gasping, before sucking him in again.
Draco bites his lip hard enough to leave a divot. “Fuck.”
Potter pushes Terran off him. “I went off again, I didn’t even know what you were doing.”
“I don’t,” says Malfoy, raising his eyebrows in what Harry is coming to recognise as his signature move. He doesn’t think he did that in school, but then he was always sneering. “But as the master of the house, I still get ward alerts.”
. How fucked up is it that he can have sex with a man he’s wanted to murder on a dozen different occasions, but not with his loving boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend, now. Thinking of being on his knees, almost choking but still so turned on, he feels a shiver run through him. That part was almost better than coming himself, and isn’t that a revelation?
They arrive outside the ballroom, opened into by a matching set of wooden doors. Instead of trees and animals, there are people, slumped at the very bottom of the doors. Sleeping- or dead. However, this time there is no visible damage. Seemingly unaffected by the state of the doors, Malfoy heads inside.
She bends over to pick up the little dog. “I know, duckie. I’ve got the cards out ready for you.” Harry looks at the table, and realises the cards have been placed in front of his chair. He sits down. “I thought it might be better if you tried for yourself,” says Granny. “See what you’ve learned.”
Harry dances his fingers across the ripples in the water. “I think you’re probably right. But how do we do it? What does it mean?”
for comfort, but he can’t let there be any doubt about this. Harry needs to know he’s not just going through the motions of a considerate lover. He needs to know that someone cares about him- that someone wants to
“Good boy,” he says, taking his hands away and reaching for his abandoned book, still balancing on the wide arm of the chair. “Now, this is why I told you to be quiet. I’m going to read my book, and you’re going to stay still, and silent, so I can concentrate.”
Draco shakes his head and pulls their foreheads together. “It’s not sad,” he whispers. “It’s perfect.”
He ends up talking to him a little, trying to show the others that this is all perfectly fine and ordinary, thank you very much. Which is bullshit, of course, but he can tell it’s necessary. Just small things like ‘Could you pass the peas?’ and ‘Oh I didn’t catch that match, Ron. Did you Malfoy?’
“Come into the back room, duckies,” suggests Granny. “You’re being ogled.”
“I’ll be there.”
“Surprisingly accurate, for them.”
Draco was twenty-two years old, a real wizard again, and still in love with Harry Potter.
For someone who doesn’t want to talk to him, he’s doing rather a lot of it. Then again, if his friends aren’t talking to him, he might just be lonely. Until sixth year, Harry had very rarely saw him alone. If he wasn’t surrounded by a crowd of simpering Slytherins he was flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. Harry grimaces, thinking of Crabbe and his fiery end. It feels odd to think of Goyle without Crabbe, like George without Fred. They’re both alone now, and Draco is too.
“No, but really,” continues Harry. “What made you want to do it? I’m guessing it’s to do with the time you spent in the muggle world, with Simi and everyone, but joining up with Arthur still seems like a stretch.”
He deliberately neglects to remove the body bind; it’ll wear off in less than an hour anyway, and it’ll do him good to have some time to reflect on what led him to that point. The doorstep is still under anti-muggle detection charms, so they won’t have to worry about concerned passers-by. He shuts the door with a slam, turning round to see Harry stood in the kitchen doorway.
After that, Nick goes to fetch another drink and doesn’t return, and Jake and Tabitha become embroiled in a complicated discussion of figure skating with a professorial looking gentleman. That leaves him and Angus, sitting together awkwardly.
“Sorry, I don’t I have much experience with Seers who are…” he pauses, casting around for a word that won’t offend her.
Harry has a flashback to a previous assault.
“Enjoy it, did you?”
“I think it should be called something positive,” says Granger. “Like ‘The Harmony Centre’ or ‘The Acceptance Facility’.”
“Yes, yes,” he pants.
“Luna?” he calls, looking up into an empty room. The lights are off, and he realises how late it is. She’s probably in bed. Cursing, he starts to stand up, when he hears footsteps.
you take me to your bedroom,” grins Harry, still giddy and loose from his orgasm. Malfoy’s still dressed, though his flies are open and his belt is missing, but that’s not what makes Harry start. “You’re still hard.”
Narcissa’s house arrest ended at the same time Draco’s exile did. The first thing they did together was go house hunting. She’d been trapped in that mausoleum, that place so filled with misery and darkness, and now all she wanted was a stylish modern apartment. The building was popular with young business people, and his mother stuck out like a sore thumb, but she loved it. It was almost as different to the Manor as it was possible to get.
When Harry was eighteen, Ginny told him she wanted to be friends. If anything, Harry was relieved. He was still waking up screaming most nights, Ginny still flinched at sudden movements, and neither of them were in the right place to be what the other one needed. He didn’t even consider romance again for months. He threw himself into rebuilding Hogwarts, and when term started, everyone seemed so happily paired off. Ron and Hermione were wrapped up in each other, Dean and Seamus had made their relationship public, and Neville and Hannah were making moon eyes at each other across the common room. The students who had returned to complete their education, the eighth years, had their own quarters. This meant he couldn’t spend his evenings with Ginny, either.
Harry bristles. “It wasn’t. All that happened was- what happened was-” He growls in frustration. “I don’t know. I can’t say it right, it sounds worse than it is. Can I just show you?”
He’s decided not to tell them about the breakup with Terran just yet. If everything goes to plan, then they won’t be broken up long enough to worry them about it. Ergo, he can’t tell them about Malfoy, or they’ll think he’s been cheating. Surprisingly, he finds that he wants to tell them. He needs all that weirdness to spill out onto the table so Hermione can dissect it, force it to make sense.
. But he’d never be able to hide that from Simi. He could say he’d gotten someone to fix it, but they’d want to help him pay, and then he’d be back where he started.
Upstairs is a small flat, comprised of one room containing the kitchen, the living room and the bedroom, and a door to what must be the bathroom. Granny is in bed, surrounded by tissues and looking sorry for herself. “Harry,” she wheezes, “You haven’t caught me at my best, I’m afraid.”
“Which one?” she asks facetiously, bouncing Teddy on her lap.
Harry grumbles and moans, stretching out like a lazy dog, before falling still again. Feeling like a brute, he slides out from under the sleepy Potter and stumbles over to the window. It’s one of those Victorian sash windows, and it screeches with rust as he pushes it up. Three letters are immediately dropped onto the desk, the
“Afternoon, Mrs Malfoy.”
Potter hums thoughtfully. “Yeah. Are you?”
Draco pauses, looking down at his hands. “The fear. The guilt, the loneliness.”
“You’re the one trying to argue, I just wanted to know why I’d been summoned to a pub at two in the afternoon. And when I came out of the goodness of my heart, to make sure you weren’t having
He steps away, and Harry can breath again. Of course. Of course it was something so simple as fixing his hair. It just didn’t feel simple to him. Draco didn’t see him that way, had only just stopped hating him, and he didn’t deserve to have his newfound friendliness be misconstrued.
Draco shuffles down the bed, pulling the other man with him. He tugs the covers over them both, tangling their legs together.
He takes Harry back to his, not even considering otherwise. They stumble through the front door, giggling like teenagers afraid of waking their parents up. Draco nips into the en suite, grabbing the two of the cups he keeps there and filling them from the tap. He always forgets he can use magic for a bit, after spending time with his muggle friends. He takes them through to the bedroom and presses one into Harry’s hand.
Hermione laughs. “Maybe you shouldn’t leave the house after all then, if she’s lurking about.”
“I didn’t know you could cook. I always thought you had house elves to do that for you.”
Harry’s eyes widen. “Oh. I suppose it’s just habit.”
Harry takes a settling breath, and thinks of Draco lying on the grass in the orchard. Shading his eyes with his hand, the sun catching his hair alight. His small chuckle, not quite open enough for a laugh. Back in the present, Harry screws his eyes shut and chokes out “
“I wanted a drink after, so I went to a bar. I ended up talking to someone, he could tell I was upset, and I sort of told him everything. He had some… ideas, about what the problem might be, so he offered to help. Anyway, it worked. We had sex.” Harry looks down into his mug, not wanting to meet their eyes. “A few times.”
Draco keeps licking, sucking, wriggling his tongue inside. Harry writhes, anchored in place by the rope that’s keeping him stretched out, on display. Fingers join his tongue, and Draco tortures him with them until he’s wet and loose, tears welling in the corners of his eyes. Every now and then he removes his mouth to talk to Harry, to tell him how good he’s being, how sweet he tastes. Harry’s making noise almost constantly now, though nothing that could be considered words.
He begins to write.
Harry snorts. “Does a smack upside the head count?”
“Draco, darling.” She comes closer, placing a translucent palm over her son’s cheek where he kneels on the floor. Draco shivers with the cold her hand radiates. “You weren’t supposed to see me.”
“You didn’t overreact,” he says, squeezing Potter’s arm.
“I had no idea. I was about to call the Au- the police.”
“Yes, Draco.”
“I’ll help you.”
Harry fidgets. “Place it onto the deck, then lower the needle.”
“Lord, you’re impatient, aren’t you?”
Malfoy ends the kiss just long enough to look in Harry’s eyes, seeming to confirm something to himself. Harry doesn’t wait for him to come back, cupping his hand round the back of Malfoy’s neck and pulling him back in. He can feel the slide of his woollen jumper being pushed up his stomach, and he moves his hands from where they’re braced on the table behind him to raise them above his head. They break apart, gasping for the breath they’d forgotten they needed, and Malfoy tugs the jumper over his head. His t-shirt follows swiftly after, and then there are hands all over him. His skin feels hot and sensitive, like the fingertips trailing lightly over his ribs will leave bruises in their wake. Surely, Malfoy can’t touch him like this and not leave any evidence behind?
“Potter? Potter? You didn’t tell me what to do if this happened. Oh shit, Harry?”
“Yeah. It actually happened last Thursday, but I wasn’t ready to talk about it before. I know I should have said something on Friday, but I just… It was like I thought if I didn’t tell anyone then it wouldn’t be real.”
Draco’s smile is a little wicked. “I know last time I asked you to call me Draco, but I don’t think that’s quite right for what we’re going to do. You can say no to this and I won’t be angry, but when I ask you a question, I’d like you to call me sir.”
Draco nudges his nose under his ear in a provocative, ticklish way. “Dance with me.”
“It turns it on and off. If you keep it on all the time it’ll run out faster.”
“Animal cruelty? Bunny is a great name, and it’s what she answers to.”
Harry’s replying quietly, almost a whisper, things he wants to hear so badly he almost convinces himself he’s hallucinating. Things like
“Do you love her?”
“There you go,” he says, handing it back to Draco. “You’ll have to look on your own, I don’t really want to see it again.”
“Don’t worry about it,” he says. He has no idea how he’d tell Ron he’s dreaming about his former nemesis every night, or even that they’re sort of friends now.
Harry folds his arms, but he doesn’t look all that cross. “I can fight my own battles. I did kill a Dark Lord, you know. You might have heard of him- Moldervort or whatever his name was.”
to assault me, what do you want, Weasley?”
"I don't really know birds that well," admits Harry.
“It- it was something that happened. Before. You didn’t do anything wrong,” he assures him. No, Draco’s been surprisingly wonderful. About everything.
Phew. That's the last proper chapter, and so my first ever fanfic is basically done! I am open to feedback, but if you're going to criticise please be constructive. I'm posting this today because I have to get my laptop fixed tomorrow, and I didn't want to leave you guys hanging!
‘Darling’ is something he’s called partners before, and when he uses it on Potter it’s sincerely meant, but it’s not the same as calling him sweetheart. It feels so sugary soft, that if Potter wasn’t so deep in subspace, he’d know for certain that something was wrong. At this point, he might as well just give in and call him Harry, if he’s going to be throwing around words like
Harry shakes his head, unable to stop smiling. “You’re not paying me, remember? I volunteered as emotional support.”
friend, but I’m going to change that.”
“Visiting Luna. And you?”
Harry takes Draco’s face in his hand, thumb stroking behind his ear, and kisses him. Draco’s hips stutter, before finally stilling. Warmth pools inside him, and he feels a rush of satisfaction at making Draco come. And, without warning, the realisation comes that he keeps slipping into thinking of him as Draco, not Malfoy. When did that happen?
“Well,” says Draco, folding his arms. “My emotions aren’t feeling very supported right now.”
“So what did you tell Hermione?” asks Harry, as he places two plates of the hot and garlic-heavy Bolognese on the kitchen table. The steam from the pasta fogs his glasses, and he wipes them with his sleeve before replacing them.
“Well, I wouldn’t want to impose. They wouldn’t know I was coming, and there might not be enough food.”
Draco rushes forwards to hold him again. “Darling, what’s wrong? What did I do?”
“Well,” shrugs Ginny, “It wasn’t something I really thought about that much until recently. I was so obsessed with you in school. Then I started spending more time with Luna, before she was taken away.” She breaths deeply, and blinks away tears. “When she was gone, I thought about her every day. I was so scared they’d hurt her, or kill her. I didn’t realise until she was gone how much I needed her. After the battle, when I saw her for the first time, I just held her. I hung onto her and I realised I never wanted to let go.”
“Don’t call me Potter,” he whines, taking a big gulp before setting it aside.
The next time he enters Granny Lynn’s shop, there is a customer. He can hear a woman sobbing in the back room, and Granny’s soothing tones trying to calm her. Earl runs out of the room to greet him, his whole body wiggling as he wags his tail. Harry bends down to rub his ears,  and spends some time looking at the items on the shelves while he waits. In pride of place, in the centre of the wall, is a golden pocket watch. While there’s no physical barrier, protective magic surrounds it. The watch seems to be vibrating, making a quiet purring noise. On the otherwise plain front, words circle the edge: ‘
“Very wise,” says Malfoy, with a decisive nod, his cheeks looking a little pink.
“I don’t want you to cling to a memory, Draco. I want you to live.” Narcissa’s hands moves to stroke over his hair, trembling the whole time.
“Wait,” interjects Draco. “Even if the memory of a cat somehow became a ghost, that doesn’t explain how it healed me.”
Harry takes a cautious sip. It somehow manages to taste both like soap and Sunday dinner. He gags slightly.
“The second one,” admits Potter.
Malfoy fiddles with his beermat, playing with it like a spinning-top. He’s never still. His fingers are always in motion, his foot constantly tapping. Harry can’t remember him being like this before. At school he was so refined, moments of silliness and drama had to break through the years of grooming and expectation. Malfoys acted like Malfoys. The war seems to have stripped away the veneer of poise and formality and left a bruised young man behind.
“No,” says Draco, calmly but firmly. “Don’t touch unless I tell you to. Put your hands behind your back, that will make it easier to remember.”
“I don’t why he’s bothering. I deserve whatever happens to me.”
“Don’t be self-deprecating, it doesn’t suit you,” he sniffs.
Harry nods.
Harry clenches his fist in his own hair, pulling until it’s painful. “You can still stay; I just can’t do that tonight.”
Draco sucks harder, his nails digging into the crease between Harry’s arse and thighs. Harry closes his eyes, tips his head back, and lets the water run over his face.
She frowns. “Very well. I suppose you may call me Narcissa.”
“I imagine not,” says Draco mildly, clearly holding back.
“We’ve already covered the first rule: don’t touch without permission. That includes yourself. Secondly, you’re not to lie. If I ask you a question, I need you to answer it honestly. This is important. Don’t pretend to like something just because you think I want you to.”
Potter folds his arms, looking unimpressed. “It took me ages to get it to trust me that much, and now I’ll probably have to start all over again.”
“Did he tell you that?” asks Zabini.
“It may. Our actions can always change what seems to be inevitable.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I think I can work it out.”
“But you must stay and eat Draco. How would that look, if everyone arrived and we were turning you out on your ear, no meat on your bones, pale as you are. They’d think we were monsters. They’d think you weren’t welcome, and we can’t have that, because you know you are welcome, don’t you Draco?”
“My own blend,” says Granny, holding the jar up to the light. “Lavender to induce sleep, catmint to stimulate dreams, mugwort to enhance their prophetic qualities, and rosemary flowers to help you remember it. I’ve been perfecting the recipe for years.”
“Like this?”
He pets Draco’s head, luxuriating in the feel of those silky strands under his calloused fingertips. Draco kisses a path further down, his hands joining in his exploration. He takes Harry’s nipple into his mouth, so lightly he almost can’t feel it. He does feel it, though.
Harry whacks her shoulder, and taking a deep breath, decides to deal with one dilemma at a time. “How did you know you like girls? As well as boys, I mean.”
Hermione rolls her eyes but doesn’t rise to the bait.
It’s true that he wants to use Potter, wants to own him like that, but it’s not the whole truth. He also just wants it to last, wants to drag it out. Every moment he has Potter he’s counting down the seconds until he leaves again. If he can keep him in limbo that way, like a stasis charm, Draco could fool himself into believing it’s forever.
Harry pulls out a chair and lowers himself into it with a grunt. “Shouldn’t I be looking after you? You were half dead less than an hour ago.”
“That makes no sense.” All the blood drains from Ron’s face. “Wait a minute! I know what’s happened. He’s given you a love potion.”
“I’ll cook you if you’re not careful,” Draco huffs.
it works, but I can tell you how you use it,” offers Draco.
The man laughs, clearly unbothered, but Harry misses his response. There’s a sharp look in Draco’s eyes when he watches Samuel stood by his side, and it makes a shiver run through him. He hands Draco his drink, and receives murmured thanks, before that gaze is directed at him again.
His eyes widen. Draco’s going to read? His dick throbs at the thought of being ignored, being an object for Draco’s pleasure. He doesn’t have to think at all, doesn’t have to worry about making the right decisions- he can just let himself be used. Just a body. A toy.
“Can I ask…” wonders Draco. “Did your family ever cuddle you, kiss you, give you hugs?”
Granny lays her hand over his. “Did you ever try to run away, when you were younger?”
Hello all! Than you to everyone who encouraged me to write more fics, I'm glad to be back. This one deals with heavy stuff, so there are trigger warning in the end notes if you want them. As always, kudos and comments keep me writing and updating!
“In what way,” says Hermione, keeping her voice bland so she doesn’t alarm her victim with her interrogation. What she fails to take into account however, is that not only is Zabini sober, but he’s also a Slytherin. He’s seen all these tricks before.
Angus’s hands are nearly twice the size of his when he goes for a handshake, but his grip is light and easy. “Good to meet you, Harry.”
“Six months,” he says.
Granny puts two mugs down on the table. One in front of her, and one in front of Draco. Instead of tea, his drink is almost black, and smells fragrantly of coffee. “You go on and walk that silly dog now, Harry. I’ll take it from here.”
“Strip.”
“You mean the
Weasley shrugs. “I also wanted to check you weren’t blackmailing him or slipping love potions into his tea.”
This chapter is a lullaby a wrote when I was imagining what Narcissa might sing to Draco. If you guys are interested I might make a recording and link to it here.
Harry clears his throat. “Maybe not, I think we might get kicked out.”
“You taught your little gang of hooligans in fifth year, didn’t you?”
“I hate you,” he whispers.
“So,” says Blaise with a white-toothed grin. “The snakes ride again.”
“Felix it is.” Draco clears his throat. “I know you’re not all that familiar with all the options, but is there anything you can think of that you particularly want to try? I can’t promise I’ll agree to it, but I won’t judge you either.”
Harry rolls his eyes, and looks around the room. Where are his clothes? His wand must be in his trouser pocket still. With a spike of heat in his gut he remembers what happened in the kitchen last night, and where his clothes and wand must be. He goes into the adjoining bathroom to relieve himself. Wandlessly, he casts a cleaning charm over his teeth, wincing at the aggressive minty taste. Harry’s always struggles with subtlety when it comes to wandless casting. He spots a dressing gown hanging on the back of the bathroom door and snags it. It’s thin white cotton, but better than nothing.
“Yes.” Draco tries to add something scathing, to soften the blow, but can’t.
“What do you mean?”
Mr Filch nodded. “And are you a good Christian? Do you read your bible?”
Harry kicks up the gravel, scuffing his trainers. What stings more than anything, is that he doesn’t hate Malfoy at all. It seems too petty now, and his letters have become increasingly sincere. He’s got a wicked sense of humour that chimes with Harry’s own when it isn’t fuelled by bigotry. In less than a week, Harry’s begun to think of him as a friend. It’s a bad idea. This whole thing is a bad idea, and he never should have agreed to it. Then again, he didn’t have much choice.
There’s no greeting or signature. He knows Harry knows who sent it. Biting his lip, Harry rereads it.
put together.”
“Oh,” he sighs. “I say: I’m going to fuck you, Potter.”
“So, who invited you anyway?” she asks. “Not that we’re not glad you’re here, but…”
“Hm?”
He takes off his glasses and casts a temporary charm over his eyes. There's no point in fogged up glasses. Harry rinses the soot off in the shower for a minute while he runs his bath, wanting the warm water to be clean and fresh. He even adds some of the salts Hermione gave him last Christmas, the ones that claim to relax aching muscles, that he rarely bothers to use. Not that he has baths very often at all, but since Friday he can’t have a shower without becoming incredibly turned on, remembering Draco on his knees and against his back.
Tabby nods back. “Right. So. Did he or did he not bite that man’s dick off?”
“It’s weird, I didn’t get a good look at it, but I just knew. It isn’t purring, that’s why I think it’s broken,” he says.
“Things have changed since then,” he says. “I’ve been having dreams about the future, and its not like I was a million miles away before. I had visions all the time.”
“You’re so desperate for me, aren’t you? What a needy little slut.” Draco strokes a finger down his spine, his crease, over his hole. “Don’t worry, darling. I know what you need.”
Harry chuckles, wrapping his arms around him and planting a kiss on his flushed cheek.
Ron and Hermione weren’t ignoring him, they made sure to include him to an almost pathological degree, but he didn’t want to get in their way. So, Harry spent a lot of time walking. Sometimes he traced the routes he had stalked Malfoy down in sixth year, and wondered what he was doing now. Hogwarts was almost boring without someone to fight. However, though Harry testified in order to keep him from Azkaban, the Wizengamot still felt something had to be done. Malfoy was ordered to live for three years as a Muggle, without his wand, so that he might learn the tolerance his parents never taught him. Poor bastard, thought Harry, as he hovered outside Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. He found that his walks often concluded outside this particular room, but he was never able to go in.
“I’ve always loved Molly’s food, but I find she’s quite reluctant to try new things,” says Luna. “I wanted to give her my recipe for broccoli Battenburg but her face went very strange, and she pretended something was burning.”
If they weren’t in company, Draco might have succumbed to a similar level of childishness and stuck his tongue out at him.
, thinks Harry.
She gestures to the room, candlelight glinting off a crystal ball in the corner. Harry understands. Granny might match Trelawney in their taste for chintzy furniture, but it seems in all other areas they are leagues apart.
Draco put his arm over his eyes, shielding them from the sun and Harry’s gaze. “I didn’t want you to save me again, to be the hero again. To show how much better you were than me.”
“It’s Harry, remember?” he huffs. “And I think I’d know if there was a whole other room in my own house.”
“What’s him?” wonders Weasley.
’ me, Malfoy. I told you, it kills the mood.”
, thinks Draco, wishing he could touch him, comfort him.
, he thinks to himself.
He takes his hand away from Harry’s tented jeans and grips Harry’s chin tightly. “‘Yes’ what?”
“Where in the rules did I say that? Besides, it’s actually very magnanimous of me. If you couldn’t push each other then Greg would never have won; his aim is dreadful.”
Harry starts shimmying out of his jeans. His tight, tight jeans that hug his arse like a… like a koala, or something. He climbs into Draco’s bed in his t-shirt and pants, placing his glasses on the bedside table. Draco strips off entirely; none of clothes are comfortable enough to sleep in. Except his underwear, he doesn’t have an excuse for those. He just wants as much of his skin on Harry as possible. Only to sleep, mind you. They’re too drunk for anything else.
“Alright then. About Bunny-”
Granny takes his hand, and instead of shaking it, she turns it over to see his palm. She strokes his knuckles and smiles innocently. “You have very longs thumbs.”
“Are you hard?” he asks.
“Of course, thank you very much for inviting me.”
Harry nods, and braces himself for the inevitable.
“I want you inside me all the time, always want to be full of you. Want to be good for you, make you feel good too.”
“Up until then I’d always thought he was so wise, that he had the answers to everything. He’d taught me so much. That was when I started to realise that everyone’s pretending a little bit. Even Lupin was, even Dumbledore was.”
“I had lots of dreams after that, about all sorts of things. They started teaching me Divination, and it’s still the only type of magic I’ve ever had any luck with. I can go for months without even touching my wand,” she says.
“Maybe at first, but then it was just because I wanted to. You’re an alright bloke when you want to be,” says Harry.
Harry smiles. Draco wants to kiss him, but now doesn’t seem like the right time.
Harry’s throat closes up. “Scars?”
He rests his head against Draco’s suit-clad thigh for a moment while he catches his breath, then lets himself be pulled to his feet. Draco kisses him chastely, as if to highlight by contrast how dirty what they just did was. Harry had completely forgotten where they were, that there were even other people in the house, he was so engrossed with Draco.
Flushing red, Harry pulls back a little, suckling at the fingers like he used to suck his thumb as a child.
“So, you’re allowed to insult me, but I’m not allowed to insult myself?”
Draco doesn’t turn up and harass Harry when he gets back to work on the ballroom on Monday, and part of him is disappointed, even though he knows it’s for the best. He’ll never get anything done if Draco keeps distracting him like he did in the attic last Friday. Still, he finds himself a little distracted anyway. He starts off with the same patch of soot he was attacking last Thursday, when Draco came and made his offer. If he squints, he can still see a slight footprint on the floor. He had stood in that exact spot and kissed Draco Malfoy for the first time.
“No,” he says, shaking his head. “Only the Master of the house, or the house itself can do it. All you have to do is say: ‘
“Mama!” called Dudley. “Mama, Harry’s stolen something!”
Potter whines, and presses the heel of his palm against his crotch. It seems he likes that idea. Draco wonders about some of the things he’s said before. They seemed to get a good reaction, but he wants to test it again.
The door swings open. “Harry,” says Andromeda. “What a nice surprise!”
Harry shivers, despite the heat of the water. “It feels like I’d do anything you tell me to.”
Draco just laughs and walks away.
“Isn’t that-” begins Hermione, before cutting herself off.
Harry sighs. “I don’t have any.”
Harry takes his head out of the flames and floos over. Zabini stands, and wanders over to a drink’s cabinet.
Even from here he can see the way Draco’s drop pearl earrings catch the light, picking up the iridescent pink-grey weave of his suit. There are still hours to go before the party- they decided to have the opening in the evening so they had the whole day to prepare- but Draco insists on rushing as if guests will be arriving any minute. Arthur’s not quite as bad, but even he looks frazzled. His greying hair seems to be flying in all different directions, reminding Harry of himself as a small child.
“Oh, we went to school together.”
“Hawaii?” echoes Potter, the first time he’s spoken in a while.
“Was this your dog?” asks Harry.
Weasley is shaking out his hand, eyebrows bunched in a frown. He hopes he’s broken it, the stupid git.
He removes his fingers, and Harry almost wants to cry at the loss. Draco whispers the same spell he’d used when he’d ridden him before, the one that leaves him wet and open in an instant. A gasp is punched out of him, and Harry quickly clamps his mouth shut. He’s supposed to be quiet.
Simi wanders over and perches on the arm of the sofa. “Sounds like you’re having way too much fun without me.”
Malfoy cocks his head. “Really? From where I was standing, you looked about ready to knock down the wall.”
Potter disappears to order his drink, and Finch-Fletchley bustles over to Bones to talk about some inane Ministry business. Potter seems surprisingly normal, if he’s honest, considering yesterday’s events. A small seed of hope begins to sprout in his chest, wondering if Potter doesn’t care for Jones as much as he thought.
Draco raises an eyebrow, and Harry blushes. Granny smothers a chuckle with a delicate cough, and turns her back to them, going to the counter to put the kettle on. Harry suspects she’s trying to give them an element of privacy.
Harry runs to his side. His blond head is faced towards the ground, expression blank. Harry drops to his knees beside him. For a moment, one moment too long, Harry thinks he’s dead.
Harry has never felt pretty. At a stretch, attractive. Molly sometimes call him handsome. He never got to choose what he wore as a child, then when he did have money to buy his own clothes he was almost always in uniform. So, he sticks with the same things he always wears. T-shirt, jeans, trainers. He doesn’t move like Draco, doesn’t lean with his hip cocked out in the way drags your eyes down his body. Harry had never felt pretty until Draco whispered it in his ear. He wants to feel it again.
Draco’s voice becomes more clipped, polished, a hasher version of himself coming to the fore. “That’s right Potter, take it. You were made to be fucked.”
“How does it work?” asks Draco, his face betraying no emotion.
Draco wastes no more time. Fucking Harry with an almost religious ecstasy, he looks like a devout man lost in prayer. Harry feels torn apart, like Draco could rip him to pieces and he’d kiss him for it. Draco said this was about control for him, but Harry has never seen him look wilder. His eyes are the colour of ice, of hell frozen over, and he can’t look away.
“He is quite wild, I’m afraid. My poor Dudley lives quite in terror of him. I’ve done all I can, but unfortunately there’s just no taming him.” Here she sighed, and looked at Harry, continuing to talk as if he wasn’t present. “Furthermore, he is a persistent liar. He’s always spinning tales about wrongs that have been done with him. If he says he has been mistreated, do not listen to him; he only means to hurt us.”
“Oh god,” moans Harry. His life is over. He has to tell them, and they’re going to die, and then they’re going to kill him. Ergo, his life is over.
Draco shuffles until he’s upright, their faces level, with Harry sitting in his lap. He grabs Harry’s arse cheeks, massaging them, letting a thumb dip into the crease.
He winks. He actually winks at him. Harry might die. He likes Angus, he’s great, he feels a real kinship with him, but he also wants to smother him with a sofa cushion.
Zabini swings his legs of the sofa, violently displacing Millie’s feet and making her squawk in protest, so that he’s facing Harry directly. “Is this about Draco?”
“I drank the tea so the fortune is mine, but whoever empties the cup is the person who should read them, as the symbols depend on them to be understood.” Granny takes the cup from where he’s gripping the delicate handle and tilts her head to study it. “That is certainly the Grim, but just as Death in Tarot is often misinterpreted, these things are rarely as bad as they seem. What’s important is what the symbol means to you.”
Outside the shop, he turns to the owl and says “Can you find number 12 Grimmauld Place? I’ll meet you there later.”
“Get on your knees for me, darling.”
Potter lowers his shoulders, his relief written all over him. Good grief, but he’s an open book. If he wants to keep this a secret he needs to acquire some acting skills.
After an age, Draco lightly touches his shoulder, and Harry reaches out for him.
“A friendly one. One that will keep someone company, but not too demanding.”
“Yeah, I did,” slurs Potter.
Ginny leans forward. “What do you mean ‘it’s saved’, dad? Did you find an investor?”
All three of them had been offered a place in Auror training and all three had declined. It was someone else’s turn to hunt dark wizards. Harry was going to walk a dog.
“Don’t worry, I can be civil,” he says with a small smile.
. He won’t, though. They haven’t discussed what they’re doing right now; this isn’t a scene. He might want to destroy Potter in a perverted mirror of the way he’s destroyed Draco, body and soul, but he doesn’t have permission for that. Yet.
Draco flicks his wand at the kettle to set it boiling. “Who’s we?”
Draco’s bares his teeth in a wolfish grin. “If I told you to, would you leave the door unlocked?”
“So you wrote to me out of pity?” spat Malfoy.
Ron takes a loud slurp of tea, and Hermione glares at him. Harry clears his throat. A large part of him wants to just spill his guts about everything that’s happened with Draco, but an even larger part of him knows that Ron would blow up, and he isn’t in the mood to deal with that. He’s going to have to get a little creative with the truth. Shit. Harry hates lying, and what’s more, he’s terrible at it.
Angus looks over in the direction of the bathroom, where Draco and Simi still haven’t emerged. “He’s a good dom, isn’t he?”
, but he can’t. His hips hitch a little, and a low sound escapes.
“Steady on, Potter,” he says, amusement colouring his voice.
“You’re too hard on yourself, I know that’s not true,” admonishes Granny.
like he’s trying to spend time with Potter. He could kiss Luna, truly.
Harry raises his eyebrows as if to say ‘oh, only a fifth?’.
The picture he makes is so lovely that for a moment Draco’s sure something must be wrong. There’s no way someone like him gets to have this.
Harry turns around to kiss him properly, before pulling back with a glare. “No.”
“What do you mean?”
Ron and Hermione come for dinner that night, and Harry makes curry. He’s always been a good cook- he had to be, living with the Dursleys- but he only started to enjoy it when he started living on his own. Petunia would never put anything on the table spicier than mustard, and he was eager to reclaim whatever part of his family history he could. Tonight’s experiment is Nani Pothar’s Maharashtrian Chicken curry. He’d salvaged some family recipes from a dusty cookbook left behind to rot in Godric’s Hollow, along with a few other tokens he’d restored and displayed. Fridge magnets, children’s picture books, a record player.
“What sort of owl are you looking for?” Athis asks.
Harry looks on in shock. By all appearances Draco Malfoy is having tea with Molly Weasley. Molly’s warm eyes then turn to Harry, pinning him down.
“I didn’t steal anything! It’s my letter and it has my name on it; the owl gave it to me.”
They drag themselves out of bed with hangover potions acting as a powerful incentive. Harry’s eager to get home to his clean clothes and toothbrush, but before he leaves, he grabs Draco’s wrist.
Simi steps in. “Look Sam, either you take a fucking hint, or you leave. Which is it?”
Draco laughs, grateful and affectionate. “Even Snakeface Supreme couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Pansy.”
Terran doesn’t want him once he actually has him. Terran’s eyes are dark when he continues, his voice hoarse as he says “I want you naked now.”
“Do you want to take a bath?” asks Harry. “It’s big enough for two.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” reassures Draco.
“There’s nothing to tell. I flipped out over nothing, as usual.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter tugs at his messy hair, until black curls spring upwards from his head, ignoring gravity. “You can still stay; I just can’t do that tonight.”
Warnings: some light mentions of past child abuse/neglect, in relation to the Dursleys.
Harry tries not to think about what Draco’s witnessing. The memory he gave him started with Terran asking him to bed and ends with him leaving. It probably didn’t need to be that long, but without the context Draco might get the wrong idea. He needs to see that it was Harry’s fault, that he wasn’t attacked or assaulted.
“Is that any way to talk to your host?”
“Of course I’ll go,” says Harry. “When is it?”
Granny hums. “What else?”
Draco gazes at the wand in his hands for a moment, and then closes his eyes. “
Narcissa sniffs.
“I was just going to tell you that, since you’re apparently loaded again, you’ll be bringing most of the alcohol on Saturday.”
Ron’s jaw clenches, but he doesn’t say anything yet.
“I think I’d better show you.”
Harry whines, and lets his bottom teeth graze ever so slightly under the head in a way he knows drives Draco mad. He looks up at his boyfriend shaking apart above him but still sounding so coaxing, so loving, and grips himself tighter.
Granny shrugs. “That’s alright Harry, remembering isn’t the point. You can use the book if you like.”
Draco barely bothers to stop kissing him as he talks. “How badly do you want it?”
He’s certainly paying him handsomely to work on the Manor, though he knows he’s given Arthur a discounted rate. The wages come from the vault he and Arthur set up for the Centre, rather than Draco directly, which helps eliminate some of the awkwardness. It also helps that technically Arthur’s the one who hired him- it would be weird if he was Potter’s employer.
“Yeah, Sirius left it to me.”
“Never mind, it’s probably for the best. This way you’ll have two goes at it.”
“Give it a try now,” suggests Harry. “Remember to focus on the happy memory.”
He can see Harry mouthing at him over Molly’s shoulder.
“Let’s get you inside,” says Draco. “I need to send for the Aurors, and probably the Healers to be safe, but we can’t just stay out here on the street.”
“Well, I sort of thought we might be already,” says Harry, turning round to busy himself with the tea; hiding his face from Draco.
Harry whimpers, moving his hips to try and get Draco to stop teasing and
Harry throws his hands in the air. “Maybe that’s it! Maybe we should just be kids. The wars over, there’s nothing to stop us, let’s do something stupid and fun just because we can.”
Draco nods, and kneels on the bed. Potter turns over so that he’s lying on his stomach, and Draco decides that if he lets him, he’s going to fuck him like that sometime. When he spreads Potter’s cheeks a little, his hole looks red and used. Draco feels a thrum of satisfaction. Dipping a finger in the pot, he brushes delicately over the rim. The salve is cool and tingly on his skin, and he doesn’t have to wonder how it feels for Potter. After all, he invented it for himself, after tying someone down and fucking himself on their cock rather too roughly, a few too many times. He always likes the burn in the moment, but it grows old pretty sharpish once it’s over.
“So, what did you want to talk about?” asks Harry, trying to sound unconcerned with limited success.
The door slams behind her. “Well,” she says, her face growing pale. “That is new.”
There’s no reply that he can hear. He begins to run up the stairs, but as soon as his foot touches the first step, they flatten out and start to move beneath him. Remembering the spiral stairs up to Dumbledore’s office, he stands still and lets them take him.
“Since yesterday evening, or thereabouts.”
Harry stands, pulling Draco up with him. He takes another sip of his too-strong drink, and wanders over to Jake and Tabby. Jake is definitely drunk. His shirt buttons are skew whiff, like they’d been undone and then done up again in a hurry. His cheeks are flushed, and his neat hair is sticking up in places. If Harry didn’t know better, he’d say it looks like Tabby has just ravished him in a cupboard.
Hermione clears her throat. “Ronald, do you remember me? I’m your wife, Hermione- the one you’re actually married to.”
Harry suppresses a grin. “Go on then.”
“Alright, but I better not be the only Slytherin. I almost came out in a rash after Sunday, being surrounded by so many Gryffindors.”
“Mr Potter, something unusual has happened, and I’m almost entirely certain it’s your fault.”
He puts a hand on the side of Potter’s head, stilling him. “Do you want it to move?”
Harry shivers. A delayed reaction from being outside, most likely. “Are you sure you’re not a regular? I can see you in a tweed coat.”
“Well, thank you for that. I wouldn’t want to get…dizzy.”
“What? I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance! Is this some kind of punishment for teasing you?”
“I want you to breath with me. In for four, hold for two, out for four.”
Flexing his fingers around Harry’s hips, Draco brushes past the last comment.
After he’s been bundled off home, with a promise to Zabini that he won’t try and wash the clothes before he returns them, (My house elf Punty will take care of it, Potter. I don’t trust you not to shrink them three sizes’) he has a few minutes to savour the sudden calm. Zabini and Millicent are a cyclone of bossy-but-helpful orders, acerbic observations, and backhanded compliments. It’s a bit like being lovingly slapped with a wet fish. He’s still reeling when Draco steps through the floo at exactly ten to ten. When he does a doubletake, looking Harry up and down, he knows the ordeal was worth it.
“Blaise, Millicent. It’s good to see you.”
“Yeah,” nods Harry. “I’m really sorry.”
“Completely,” he says firmly. “I used yours for weeks, turnabout is fair play.”
“No!”
“Felix,” he says. “And yours is Mandrake.”
“The Charity Burbage Centre.”
“For me?” he murmurs. “Thanks.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He nudges Draco’s cheek with his nose. “Why don’t we go and talk to Tabby?”
Draco whimpers. He’s only human, after all. Moving to cover Potter with his body, cock nestled between his cheeks, Draco murmurs in his ear.
“Don’t be absurd, Potter. Of course you do.”
‘A genuine interest’ might be more accurate than she realises. Not that he’d ever tell her, or god forbid Draco, that. Still, he’d spent a lot of time talking with Draco last night, and he’d learnt a lot of things he still felt privileged to know. The image of Draco’s original happy memory, his mother singing to him, crystallises in his mind.
He doesn’t get up from where he’s sitting on the hardwood floor, so Draco walks over to stand in front of him.
Harry looks at him, eyes wide with understanding, and lets him continue.
This is not the Draco Malfoy he knew. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever hear Malfoy apologise in his life. The tone is so different to all his other letters that if it weren’t for the details he might think it had been written by someone else entirely. Maybe he should show this letter to Hermione, to pass along the message? Or, better yet, Malfoy can tell her himself.
“Then maybe I’m the lucky one,” he says with the slow, confident smile of a man used to getting what- and who- he wants.
The Hermit: Introspection, Solitude, Guidance.
Merlin, what has he done to deserve this?
Hermione crosses her arms. “Like you are now, you mean?”
“That’s a shame, because it’s the last time I’m touching you tonight. You’re here for my pleasure, not yours. You’re here for me to use, isn’t that right?”
“And how will you avoid spending your afterlife in that foul place?”
He’s sat on their sofa, his head resting on Hermione’s shoulder, while Ron pontificates on the virtues of the Chudley Cannon’s new seeker. He’s had two glasses of wine and is working on his third, and the others aren’t far behind. They’re loose, laughing, and Harry’s never felt more miserable.
for the second time that week, so he has to find another way to distract himself. Maybe he could take out his grief and frustration on the grimy walls of the ballroom? Harry had made a start on them two days before, but there is still plenty to do. It’s late, but he’s been given access, and no one lives there anymore.
Implied child death in the form of a ghost baby.
“Fine,” he says, overcompensating until his voice comes out a little too low.
Harry shrugs. “It wasn’t that posh.”
Distantly, Harry notices what he’s just called him. He’d called him Harry twice before, but both times he was trying to comfort Harry, not fuck him. Then he’s too distracted by Draco hitting his prostrate like a jackhammer to think about it anymore. His dick is rubbing against one of those infuriating, sexy embroidered shirts, and the friction is maddening. Harry comes first, slumping against Draco, completely exhausted.
“Really?” asks Potter. “I always thought the smoke coming out of your ears was fun.”
“I think it was a big deal,” says Draco calmly. “You wouldn’t have had a flashback if it wasn’t.”
Short and sweet chapter just to tide you over a bit. Sorry for the long breaks but I've been pretty seriously ill in the middle of my uni deadlines, so needs must.
Draco puts one palm to Harry’s chest and starts to walk him backwards. The space is hazily lit with late afternoon sun, windows shut and the curtains drawn. The floor is so polished it’s almost as reflective as the wall of mirrors, and it’s barely recognizable as the same room they kissed in all those months ago. He stumbles slightly as he walks backwards, and Draco grabs his shoulders to right him, bringing them to a halt near the centre of the dancefloor.
Draco frowns, and drops the fabric bunched in his hands. “What’s wrong?”
is going a little longer than he thought.
, he’d said. It feels a little like a lie. Or else, it’s not the whole truth. Because ever since Terran cornered him in his own kitchen, Harry was forced to admit to himself that he everything he’d ever felt for that man isn’t even half of what Draco makes him feel with just one glance. ‘I care about you’ feels like a lie, because he wanted to say ‘I love you.’
Malfoy doesn’t look wrong-footed now. He looks confident, smirk pinned in place, the sharp silhouette of his body outlined in the orange lamplight. “What is it about sex? Do you not want it, or are you scared of it?”
“Can you help him?” asks Harry. It’s a long shot, he’s not even sure what this cat is. A ghost, a Patronus, a memory? But things have been so strange with ghosts lately, he might as well try.
A normal person might have stepped back after that statement, but Harry just leans in closer to the machine. Draco joins him, bending over the machine, and runs his finger over the curve of a copper wheel. The warm light illuminates his face and his hair, and his mouth curves into a proud smile. Harry thinks he’d quite like to kiss that smile. Draco meets his eyes, stumbles, steadies himself by resting his hand on something that looks like a silver horn. The horn belches dust, showering Draco in it all over again, and making Harry jump.
The combined thrill of physicality and the ruthless need to reduce Malfoy to a puddle pushes all anxiety from his head, as he sucks and licks. He doesn’t realise he’s hard until he presses closer to take Malfoy further down and his dick presses against his leg. He gasps at the sensation, and the breath causes Malfoy to groan in a feedback loop of pleasure. Malfoy’s thighs are trembling where Harry smooths his hand up and down the fine fabric. He looks up. The man who had looked so put together earlier, like a painting, has come completely undone. His hair flops down over his forehead where his neck is bent to stare at Harry.
Everyone starts talking at once. Overlapping cries of
Now it’s Harry’s turn to freeze. Luna looks between the two of them, and wanders out the door with an airy sigh of “The dirigible plums need picking. They prefer it by moonlight, it tickles them during the day.”
“Yes,” says Arthur. “There’s a room we want to turn into a cinema, and we need your opinion.”
“I always said Millicent should be in Ravenclaw.” Draco rolls his eyes in fond remembrance. “But then she’d do something suitably evil to me to prove otherwise. It would be good to see her again.”
Ginny smiles as she watches her go. “Tactful.” Looking back at Harry, her smile fades. “I’m sorry.”
As for what Draco suggested, what Harry
“No,” says Potter, his voice so small it makes Draco want to wrap him in a blanket and keep him there forever. “It’s not okay, I can’t do it.”
Potter shrugs and uncrosses his arms, taking Draco’s hand and letting himself be pulled upright. “It’s okay.”
Ginny sighs with relief. “Thank fuck for that, because if you blew your lid and asked me to stop seeing her I’d have to say no.”
“I didn’t know that,” said Draco, his voice soft.
Draco’s throat moves as he swallows, and Harry remembers him sucking him off. Then he remembers sucking Draco off, that first time, and wants to do it again. He pictures himself on his knees, and this time Draco doesn’t hold back. He’d been so careful, had pulled away so as not to come in Harry’s mouth. He’d liked that Draco had cared enough to do that, but he doesn’t think he wants that all the time.
“Rise and shine,” he needles. “Another day of hideously wasted fame awaits.”
“I’ll do what I can, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to help. It’s not like he’d talk to me, he’d probably shut the door in my face.”
“Ex-boyfriend,” he corrects. Harry’s not cheating. “He treats me fine, I’m just a freak who can’t handle a normal relationship.”
Shivering like a wet kneazle, he sinks to the floor and curls into a ball. With his head buried in his knees, his arms wrapped around his legs, the world feels a lot smaller. A lot more manageable.
“Very good,” purrs Draco.
“No,” he huffs. “You’re not normal, you’re the saviour of the fucking world, and I-”
“How do you two know each other?” asks Harry.
“Do you mind if I borrow your
“This Friday,” she says.
“Everyone expects me to be a hero, to have answers, to know what to do. I don’t know anything, I don’t even know what to do with myself.”
Harry rushes home. He runs for five minutes before he remembers he’s a wizard and apparates. He arrives on his doorstep still out of breath, and tries to comb his dishevelled hair with his fingers. Yesterday he’d given Draco a key, so he could let himself in if he arrived while Harry was still at Granny’s shop. Harry unlocks his door, remembering the shocked look on Draco’s face as he’d handed him the key, trying not to give away what he was thinking. What Harry had wished it meant.
Angus shakes his head. “Not the best first impression, I’m sure. But then the first time I met Draco, he was so drunk that when we were walking home, he started talking to a garden gnome, telling it to hide or someone would see it.”
“It’s really not a big deal- it’s not like I’m physically hurt. I usually snap out of it after a while, anyway.”
“Make sure it does, Mr Potter, or we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other.”
Ginny opens her mouth to explain, but he’s promptly saved the embarrassment by Arthur sinking onto the sofa beside him and declaring “We’re saved!”
“It’s rare. I don’t actually believe there’s another person in Britain who repairs wards, currently. It’s something that fell out of use, which is why there’s not as much demand as you might think,” he explains, stirring his tea without clinking it against the porcelain.
She picks up the worn t-shirt he’d flung over the back of a chair instead of putting away with her thumb and forefinger, like something disgusting she was about to throw in a cauldron. “Under normal circumstances, I’d say you were right.” She gives him a disapproving look, and throws the t-shirt at him. “But I am as likely to become a poltergeist as you are to clean up your mess.”
Draco foregoes his usual waistcoat; he wants to seem at ease, even if he’s feeling the very opposite. He slides a few delicate silver rings onto his fingers, knowing how they catch in the light and draw attention to his hands. Potter likes his hands. Draco’s seen how he stares at them, and he can’t help but want to tease him a little. Maybe it will help distract him from that hideous prick of an ex, if Draco riles him up a bit.
landing on top with a foreboding thud. It’s upside down, so he can’t see the headline, but the sheer thickness hints at a scandal.
Harry wets his lips with his tongue, his trousers becoming uncomfortably tight.
Harry bit his lip to stop himself from laughing. “Trouser snake? Do you thing parseltongue would work on one of those?”
“He was wearing Muggle clothes when I saw him yesterday.”
He lays his body over Harry’s, running his nose up his spine before placing a delicate kiss at the base of his neck, contrasting the heavy nudge of Malfoy’s cock against his thigh.
Harry shrugs. “Why him? Maybe because he doesn’t put pressure on me, or expect things from me. Maybe because he looks after me, even when he doesn’t have to. Maybe because he cares about me more than he does about getting off. Why not you? Because you didn’t care whether I was enjoying myself, whether I wanted you, whether I was scared- you just wanted to fuck me.”
“I’m serious, but if that doesn’t bother you, I’m happy to talk.”
Harry obeys, laving the fingers with his tongue, sucking them in deeper until they hit his tonsils. He’s too enthusiastic to be careful, and he chokes slightly.
“I am now,” he admits.
The kitchen is down a set of stone stairs, worn to a curve by hundreds of years of feet. Windows line the top foot of one kitchen wall, casting sharp beams of light onto the sturdy wooden table. Draco flicks his wand and lamps flare to life, suspended from the ceiling in clusters.
He knows they’d be wrong. He knows they were ignorant bigots. Harry still hears them anyway.
to be an arsehole- but it’s always fun.
Draco starts to count, and he can feel the expanding and contracting of his chest against Harry’s back. He’s counting so slowly it feels like a minute passes between each number, though it must only be a second. Harry tries to follow, the air ripping out of him like paper. Draco strokes up and down his back, slowly, in time with the counting. After about ten repetitions, his breathing evens out.
That makes absolutely no sense, of course he’s the same person as himself, but Harry’s distracted by the realisation of where Draco picked up his habit of saying ‘Lord’ from.
“But why?”
He opens his eyes to meet Draco’s. “White, sir.”
Dinner goes well. Surprisingly well. They come to the mutual decision to have a homecooked meal at Grimmauld Place, to avoid the press. Draco hasn’t had a chance to talk to his mother about what was in the paper yet, and he knows Harry wants to talk to the Weasleys. The sight of Harry stood over the hob, steam clouding over his glasses, settles the anxiety roiling inside him. He’s nattering on with his back to Draco, throwing glances behind him every now and then to where Draco’s sitting at the kitchen table, as if checking he’s really there.
Draco sighs. “Fine, but only for a bit. I need to forage for Silk Snails today, for a skin solution, and they hate the afternoon sun.”
She looks thoughtful. “Wait there a moment.” She wheels herself through the bead curtain, and returns with the pocket watch. “Are you certain it’s this one? Not one that looks similar.”
He’s tempting fate giving away so much information about himself, but he can’t seem to help it. If Harry can forgive Malfoy, and there’s a lot to forgive him for, Malfoy could stand to forgive him back. The problem is, writing to Malfoy is beginning to seem too much like writing to a friend. His insults don’t have the same edge that they used to. Would that change, if he knew who they were directed at?
“I suppose that confirms it, then.” Malfoy’s grin is sly. “Never play poker, Potter, or you’ll lose the shirt off your back.”
He’s close now, and he cups the back of Potter’s head to keep him still. Draco’s looking into Potter’s eyes as he comes, and it’s more honest, more intimate, than he intends it to be. The more time he spends with Potter the more he expects him to point his finger accusingly and shout ‘You’re in love with me!’. Anyone who wasn’t such a sweet little idiot with no self-esteem would have worked it out already.
“You are but you aren’t?” repeats Hermione.
Draco jabs him extra hard. “Don’t be an idiot. I’ve made breakfast, you just need to come and eat it.”
“I want to give you this,” he says. “Your mum helped me make it.”
“Well,” says Draco. “Let it never be said I’m not adaptable.”
He relaxes under the hot jet of water, and tries not to think about it.
“Harry, you might not realise it, but he’s done something to you. Don’t worry, though, I’ll sort it out.” Ron stands, a little wobbly on his feet. “Where does he live?”
After imagining the look on his father’s face if he’d lived to see the Malfoy money handed over to a Weasley, for a project like that, his mind was made up. When he realised that the Manor could also be put to use, Draco almost cackled.
ing it. Organised as his products are, one knock would probably have them all falling over in neat lines, like dominoes.
“Is this for me?” he asked the owl, whispering to the bird as if they shared a secret.
“A Long-Eared Owl. Excellent for long distance delivery, an all-weather flyer, and this one in particular is a favourite of mine.” Athis extends their arm, and the bird hops from their shoulder onto their elbow. “What do you think?”
“Anyway forget about me, what about you?” says Harry, pausing to take a gulp of his beer. “You’ve got to learn how make a bookcase in time for her birthday.”
Fortunately, it’s not the Aurors. Unfortunately, it’s Weasley. He’s definitely not Draco’s type, but even he can admit the man’s grown up well. When he smiles, his face can actually be quite handsome, if you ignore the rest of his personality.
Aisling licks her lips. “I asked what her brother was called, and she said Rowan. That was my uncle’s name. I accused her of lying, of stealing the watch.”
Draco grins, but it doesn’t look quite right. “Don’t stop on my account.”
For about five minutes, Harry watches him bent over the pensieve. He’s vulnerable, unable to watch his back, and Harry realises he’s being trusted to protect him. Not that it’s likely they’ll be attacked in Harry’s bedroom, but he knows nearly everyone who lived through the war still thinks in this way. In terms of strategy, vulnerability, defence.
“Sometimes people are playing a role, or they get so worked up that they say ‘stop’ but they don’t actually want to, or they want to stop what they’re currently doing but not end the scene altogether. If you use your safeword I know something’s wrong, and I end the scene right away.”
“What kind of ‘gathering’ is it, then?”
Harry gulps deep breaths of air, Draco’s weight putting pressure on his lungs. “Draco, you’re crushing me.”
“Not as much as I meant to.” He raises both eyebrows. “You distracted me.”
Hermione looks at him, her expression inscrutable.
“What have you got there? A letter?” Dudley snatched it from his hand, a papercut slicing open Harry’s thumb. “So, you’re a thief as well as a freak.”
“Weekends don’t count if you don’t have a job.”
Malfoy sighs, defeated. “Let’s go for a drink.”
Draco waggles a finger imperiously. “Hydration is important, Potter.”
-Muriel Rukeyser
“I’m sorry I cried again,” he says.
“Are you forcing Harry to have sex with you,” he asks.
Funny indeed. Harry takes a breath. “I want to hire you to fix the wards. You’ve been looking at them anyway, and I know it’s something you can do because you’ve done it before. Anyway, it just seems important, and it would mean a lot to me if you would.”
“I’ll be so good, I promise.” His voice is so low and broken it’s almost a croak. “You can have me whenever you want, wherever. I’ll do anything if you just keep-”
Draco just holds him tighter, letting his lips brush over his scar. Despite claiming he wasn’t tired, Harry falls asleep pretty quickly after that. Draco stays awake long into the night, trying not to raise his hopes too high, and failing miserably. He stares into the dark for hours, breaking his own heart.
“S’not your fault,” croaks Harry.
“Vernon,” she screeched, rushing from the room. “Vernon!”
Thursday morning is spent in the park, and filled with mounting panic. Earl keeps doubling back to check on him, sensing something is wrong. Why did he tell Malfoy he’d be at the funeral? It sounds like there’ll be very few people there, it’ll be so easy to work out who his ‘mystery pen pal’ is. The minute Malfoy realises who’s been writing to him, he’ll stop for good. He’d called him a moron not two days ago- there’s definitely still some bad blood there.
“That wasn’t nothing,” he says, gritting his teeth.
“It’s Saturday, so I have the day off. I’m out with friends tonight, but apart from that, I intend to be lazy.”
Draco stops himself from falling on top of him, but only just. He’s clearly still lost to the world, gathering Harry into his arms and brushing kisses up and down his neck.
“I’ll be fine so long as you stop calling me Potter; it’s like being cuddled by Snape.”
Fuck. Fuck him there and back again.
“Are you going to see him again, do you think?” Hermione asks.
but the ringing in his ears is too loud to tell.
Arthur descends the stairs into the living room, brandishing a rectangular object. “I found it! It was buried in a box of walkie-talkies, but I found it.”
Draco smirks. “Except on the phone, you mean? Besides,” adds Draco. “It’s not an intimate gathering. You won’t be out of place.”
“Never fear,” says Draco. “That was a temporary lapse in judgement, never to be repeated.”
Malfoy beckons ostentatiously, welcoming him into his home. It’s too large to be a cottage, but only just, and too picturesque to be called a house. It’s nowhere near as grand as the Manor, but the wisteria draping over the doorway and the herbs he brushed past on his way up the path give the impression of pastels and sweetness. Everything Malfoy is not. Because he is a dick.
“Alright, alright. Can’t blame a man for trying.”
“Indeed,” he says, throwing his jacket over the arm of the sofa before throwing himself dramatically onto the cushions.
There may be some credit to the idea that people look like their pets, because this person could not look more like an owl if they tried. Their eyes are round, yellow, and luminous. Their grey hair piled on their head like a nest and just barely held in place with pins. Harry gets the unsettling impression that if they wanted to they could turn their head full-circle. Their name badge reads ‘
“Are you saying you don’t love me, then? Because I know this is fast, but it’s not like we haven’t known each other for ten years.”
Malfoy folds himself over Harry’s back, putting his mouth to his ear. “Still with me, Potter?”
“Of course, Mrs Malfoy, if there’s anything I can do-”
Harry hoists himself up to sit on the worktop. “A full catering team, obviously.”
Splashed across the front page, in moving black and white, is Terran Jones. And he’s holding someone’s hand.
Until his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter had never seen an owl. He’d seen illustrations of them; there was a book in Privet House’s library, untouched as most of the books were until Harry first cracked their spines, named Bewick’s
Draco kneels, looking up at Harry, grey eyes like Eider down. “It’ll be hard for me to check on you like this, so I need you to keep talking. Can you do that for me, darling?”
“Andromeda, I’m sorry about your sister.”
“I know it feels odd, but you get used to it,” he says.
“Oh?” asks Draco, voice wary.
Harry’s shaking with emotion, eyes filling with tears of frustration. Terran shakes his head, jaw set, and starts walking towards Harry again.
She takes it back, and puts it in her pocket. “Perhaps I should keep it on me, just in case.”
He clenches his fists where they rest on the table, and then relaxes them again. “Duty then? Because of the debt.”
So he says “I love you.”
, thinks Harry.
“I imagine cleaning up this soot will be the first thing, but that shouldn’t take too long,” says Malfoy.
“Good boy,” purrs Draco, and he’s not smiling- he’s baring his teeth. He grasps Harry’s hands and winds them round the back of his neck. “Can you keep them there for me, darling?”
“Are you going out, Pansy? It’s Sunday night,” says Draco, looking quizzically at his oldest friend.
Draco comes with a grunt, nails digging red crescents into Harry’s skin.
Draco smiles softly. “Me too.”
Weasley leans back and grips his knees. “I’m not done yet, Malfoy.”
Draco’s smirk is completely humourless. “I believe Harry told you to go.”
After years of pining for him it seems impossible that his love has any more room to grow, and yet it stubbornly insists on doing so anyway. Harry is a little dandelion in his heart, taking root and spreading and filling him with a thousand yellow suns. Every time he looks there’s another flower growing inside his chest. He could keep it hidden before, back when they were manageable. Now it feels like there are petals filling his mouth, and he can’t breathe until he spits them out, until he speaks.
Harry’s never gotten this far before, but he’s determined not to let that stop him this time. Thinking, if he does it fast enough, he can push past any worry not drowned out by arousal, he swallows as much as he can. It feels strange, and hot, and overwhelming in a way he’s never felt before. Malfoy hisses. Harry almost grins, before he remembers to mind his teeth. He wants to make it feel good. Not because he’s worried Malfoy will reject him. He wants to make it feel good because when they were eleven, he got on a broom for the first time and flew circles around Malfoy, who had been flying almost before he could walk. He may be inexperienced, but there’s no accounting for his competitive streak when it comes to Malfoy.
Harry rests his cheek on Teddy’s downy head. “We were all idiots back then. You were just more of an idiot than most.”
As Harry draws breath to defend himself, Arthur clears his throat.
The purring starts quietly, but it builds. It grows in volume until he feels like he’s inside the belly of a lion. The ground begins to shake. Harry is getting colder, and the cat impossibly hotter, until his hand is burning where it touches her spectral fur. Draco’s face begins to twitch, his hands flex. The cat dissolves into him. Suddenly, he jolts upright, like waking from a nightmare. Their eyes meet for just an instant, before the black splotches crowd his vision, and Harry loses consciousness.
“Excuse me for not attending to it sooner, Potter, but seeing as I was exiled to live as a muggle, it was rather out of my hands.”
Malfoy raises his eyebrows as he pushes the heavy doors open. “Yes, they did.”
Harry is silent. What would it have been like, to have been looked after this way- if he’d always had people to care about him? Would he still be as fucked up as he is now? Harry has a tendency to blame everything that wrong and strange about his mind on the war, but he realises now that it’s not the whole truth. Something’s been wrong with him for a long time. Longer than he can remember. Draco stands, and uses the towel around Harry’s shoulders to scrub at his hair. He takes the towel, folding it precisely in two before he hangs it back on the rack. Looking back at Harry, his face pales.
“Does it?” he asks lightly, reaching down to stoke Harry’s cock. “It doesn’t feel like it. Besides, you call me Malfoy.”
“How long have you been playing with him?” asks Simi.
Despite Harry’s request to fuck him, it doesn’t take long to get them off like that. They breath into each other’s mouths, a string of spit connecting them for a moment, before breaking. There’s come on Harry’s stomach and pyjamas, as well as on his own shirt, sticking them together. Harry lets his head fall back onto the tiles, panting. He strokes Draco’s hair, guiding his head down to rest on his chest.
“I swear we spend more time talking about sex than actually doing it,” says Harry petulantly.
“Why can’t you do it, you mean,” says Ron under his breath.
Draco breaks the kiss with an amused huff. “Patience, darling.”
“Yeah,” he agrees, voice cracking a little. “I can’t exactly compare him to anyone else, but- He takes care of me.”
“I’m sorry,” says Harry. “It was a bad idea. I should have known it would just make you sad.”
Draco shrugs, lip twitching upwards into almost a smile. “Why not?”
“What? I don’t-”
“I’ll come with you,” says Granny firmly.
Draco shrugs. “I say what I see.” He drains his mug and stands up. “I’m going to go get started. We can work on the Patronus after, if that’s all right with you?”
Two mugs float over to the table, and Harry takes one, the ceramic warm in his hands. He takes a long sip, the tea still too hot, burning his tongue. “What are you up to today?”
Draco blinks, face frozen in shock for a moment, but the sudden smile that follows is blinding in its intensity. “Yes, I would like that.”
“I’m not better,” whispers Harry. “You’ve tried to change. I just stayed the same.”
“Hi,” he says shyly. “You look- you look nice.”
“Pull on them for me, make sure they won’t break.”
Trigger Warnings:
They carry their beers over to a table in a quiet corner of the room, and sit down.
“He was trying to devour you with his eyes; I wanted to throw up just watching.”
“Yeah,” says Harry. “I love you anyway.
“She should; I used to come in here often as a child. I’m an only child, so I’d pretend she was my sister. I gave her a name, I even read to her from my books.”
“The ballroom needs the most work,” says Malfoy.
“You know,” starts Hermione, sounding cautious. “He apologised to me as well.”
What did happen? He was fine one minute, and he’d just been very thoroughly and roughly fucked, but Draco putting his nipple in his mouth sends him running for the hills? It’s not like it’s something that’s been a problem for him before, either. Terran did it a few times. In fact, the last time-
Harry manages to control his breathing long enough to talk. “I’m fine.”
“Sorry,” he says, holding his hand out.
Ah. He should have known Hermione would want to pick the story to pieces. “No, I only had one drink.”
Harry sighs. He’s being sighing more than he’d like to lately. “Well, what’s one more ghostly phenomenon to add to the list.
Granny’s face relaxes, visibly relieved. “Thank heavens for that.”
He repeats the process with his cup, swish and dump. There are three shapes circling the base: a snitch, a castle, and baby. At least he thinks it’s a baby, it could just as easily be a potato. He voices this uncertainty to Granny but she simply waves it away.
About half the people at that party now think that Harry is
Draco grabs a pillow and pulls Potter up by the hips, placing the pillow under them. As he lifts him up, he sees Potter’s mostly-limp cock just hanging there. He wants to touch it, wants to squeeze the soft flesh and say
“I didn’t realise,” says Harry.
Malfoy pours them both a generous portion, the amber liquid deep and stormy in the bottom of the glass. “If we don’t want a repeat of last time, we have to do things properly- talk about our boundaries.”
“What?” says Jake with a mild frown, the most extreme expression Harry’s seen from him. “That posh boarding school in Scotland?”
“I could help you,” he repeats, voice lower than before. “We could work through it together, and you wouldn’t have to worry about ruining our relationship, because we don’t have one.”
Lyrics filter into his thoughts. ‘
Harry thinks of Fred and George apparating downstairs for breakfast after they got their licence, and the memory of his lost friend stings. “How can you not, with a house this big?”
Merlin help him, but he’s going to say it. “Terran broke up with me.”
“Harry, Have you seen Draco? He’s not at-”
Draco rolls his eyes. “No you’re not. I’ll do it but I won’t take your money, Harry.”
“Maybe before the war, but think about now. You said dark magic and objects infect the wards? There’s been a lot of that going about, hasn’t there? And all those old Death Eater houses that have been left to relatives or confiscated by the ministry, won’t they need repairing?”
There is no way this owl is only thirty galleons. The one nearest to him has a label on the cage for sixty-five, and it isn’t nearly so impressive as this one. He hands them the money anyway, and walks out with the most impulsive purchase of his adult life so far.
Harry slides out of his trainers and walks towards him. There’s nowhere for him to sit, so he hovers in front of him, unsure if Draco wants his to stand, or kneel, or sit in his lap.
Draco huffs. “That’s why mother never let me play it. Still, Vince and Greg and I used to come here and play it for hours in the summer when she was at her charity lunches. Barely any of it got eaten even then, and since the gardener got scared off they’re all diseased and inedible anyway.” Draco sticks his nose in the air in a gesture that while it once would have been genuine, now feels teasing. “Besides, I’ve been looking for an excuse to hit you.”
“It’s not the only explanation,” says Hermione. “It’s just the only one you want to hear.”
Harry’s an adorable drunk. At one point there’s a strange flash of light, but he’s too inundated with the strange sights and sensations of the Knight Bus to pay any attention to it.
The next day Draco knocks back a hangover potion and floos to Malfoy Manor. He can’t afford to laze about in bed feeling sorry for himself, as much as he wants to. After last night, he needs to assess the damage. Granger finding out is a disaster. Maybe Potter will be too ashamed of Draco to continue, or maybe he’ll be too bull-headed to care what they think. For once, he crosses his fingers and hopes Potter’s Gryffindor tendencies win out.
“I hope you don’t mind somewhere muggle, but I’m not likely to receive a warm welcome anywhere else.”
Malfoy nods, still not speaking, and all his deficiencies just keeps spilling out of him.
Harry doesn’t even nod, he’s still transfixed by the sight.
He takes a sip, and it’s pleasantly warm and spiced.
“You should have come to us straight away,” scolds Hermione. “I can’t believe you just dealt with it by yourself. Or didn’t deal with it, knowing you.”
At quarter past nine on Saturday night, Harry has a minor breakdown. He’d gotten out of the shower, opened his wardrobe, and realised that every item of clothing he owned was terrible and if he wore any of them to Simi’s party then Draco would be embarrassed to be seen with him. Even now, as he holds two different t-shirts in his hands, one blue and one red, he knows he’s making a mountain out of a molehill. Draco’s never cared what he wears before, but then he always gets him naked pretty quickly.
Potter’s mouth is hell. It would be simpler to say it was heaven, but it wouldn’t be true, because this is torture. Not because he’s bad at it- he’s not. Unpractised, but definitely not bad. Potter’s tongue is curious, moving against him. The roof of his mouth is like satin over stone, hard and silky when the head of his cock slides against it. His lips are generous, shiny with spit. Occasionally there is the slight scrape of teeth, but Potter corrects himself swiftly, applying apologetic little licks and kisses to the area. This can’t be heaven, because it’s too good to be true. Any moment now it’s going to be snatched away, and then he’ll have to spend eternity knowing exactly what he’s missing. And it
“I want to stay,” says Draco, coming to stand in front of Harry. “Can I?”
Fuck. What was that? That was not normal. What would be normal is if Draco let him fall, then made fun of him for it. What would normal is if Draco turned his nose up at anything and everything Weasley. What would be normal is Harry not having had life-altering sex with Draco Malfoy just yesterday. And yet, here they are. He needs to get a grip. New plan: act normal. If Draco could do it (and he could, damn him) then so can he.
