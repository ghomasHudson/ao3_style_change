It was then that he remembered that he hadn't seen Luar since the ritual. Wanting to speak, he rubbed his neck brooch but instead of Luar's voice, a small note came out.
The first thing he has to do was to find a way to get rid of the dark mark. The library back at the mansion barely had anything. With this option gone , the other option he had was the school library. The book Draco needed was probably in the restricted section but to get there he needed the permission from a professor, which was nearly impossible. He cannot go to his godfather even if he knew that Snape would never do anything to harm him, still the risk was too great. So, the only other way was to make another professor give him permission.
Everyone understood her peril . She ,as a muggle, was in as much danger as Harry himself. She deserved some moments of calm and happiness before the storm , all of them did.
Perceiving something was wrong, He looked around slowly till his gaze landed on a frame kept on the table beside them. The picture was of a golden haired and smiling young man.
As the counter-spell took effect, the laboured breathing eased and her blue face slowly regained its natural colour.
Her presence had almost drove Harry crazy from irritation. All those years Harry didn't know why he felt like this. It wasn't as if he absolutely hated Pansy, he hated Pansy only when she was around Draco.
Draco didn't seem surprised at this . He had read about this before but did not expect that he himself was suffering from the same condition . He was slightly above average among his peers and thought that was his original strength . Above that , he did not notice any symptoms at all . Looking at the curtains covering the top of the bed , he blinked and remained silent , urging Luar to keep going .
It was done. Suddenly all of them felt a very familiar and intimate feeling in their hearts. It felt like meeting a long lost friend or one's family after a long time. The familiarity between them not only amazed them but also assured them. Maybe it was because of the contract . Or maybe it was because of the surety that they can unhesitatingly trust eachother. A leisure and happy aura filled their small bubble as conversations and apologies were made.
Harry was looking at the egg as well and he could hear a faint heartbeat from it . He was sure that something was inside it . Casting a lumos , he put the wand tip on the egg . The inside of the egg became somewhat visible . The egg had a translucent yellow substance inside it with a dense irregular shape in the center with red branches coming from it to spread in the egg .
" Do not jest , Potter . There is no one alive who will not use a leverage in the time of peril . If you do not have a reason now then what about when you do ?" ; Malfoy said with a giggle in his voice like a fleeting mirth . He was still looking ahead , avoiding Harry's gaze .
Night soon fell. Draco sat in his bed ready for a deep slumber but unexpectedly, thinking. He remembered standing before the dark lord who was demanding him to kill, portraying it like an honor. Commanding him to curse an innocent girl, to kill Dumbledore.  Draco never wanted to do this. But he had no choice but to stay silent and let nature take its course. He had no choice but to shove the guilt at the back of his mind and keep going because if he dwelled in this then his mother and sworn slytherin siblings will be the same . If Katie Bell was cursed then several people will be trying to save her, they will give their best for her. She will have a chance. Dumbledore was the greatest wizard of their time, as powerful as the dark lord, he can surely save himself if he wants so. But what about him? What about his people? They will be killed without a second thought. No one will try their best to save him. If they die then they weren't strong enough, weren't loyal enough. But if Katie or Dumbledore die then it was a tragedy, a reason to harass and kill every Slytherin around.
Seating themselves , the triad looked at Draco silent questions in their gaze , quietly waiting for an explanation.
At a distance, Harry was busy in his work but still had his magic paying spying elsewhere. His face sported a satisfied smile. His eyes having glee and happiness mixed with a darker desire.
Chuckling , Hermione said, " That's not it . Here let me show you " before her small hand used to holding pens and wands came forward to play the soft tune of
Harry didn't reply but only let out a sigh filled with worry and scolding tenderness for the person in front of him. He truly didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He wanted to be angry at Draco's so deficient trust in him but when looking at the honest and clear eyes, he couldn't do it.
"  Let's leave this for the future. We have more urgent matters to handle" Harry said with soft gentle words to effectively break his concentration. He did not want Draco to over exert himself again. And Harry was going to make sure of that himself.
How is this possible ? The house elves regularly clean the whole mansion. How can it be possible that in such a huge mansion there is not a single place for him to sleep ?!?!
As more and more of the poison was sucked out, the pain in Harry's body resided and his condition stabled.
Draco did not realise but the moment he left another person stood up to leave as well. Harry silently made his way out , stealthily following behind Draco , hiding in the dark and moving with shadows .
" Tell me little one  . You went through something horrible , didn't you ? The aura of death is so thick on you but it is not your . It was left by someone close to you . You are hurt inside out , aren't you ?"
After letting Draco reassure and calm their nerves , Harry said , " The time is short. Tell us what happened "
Raising an eyebrow , He looked down at a similarly confused Malfoy looking around . He had not wished for anything thus it must've been Malfoy's wish for this room to appear . Still , to feign surprise is too much of an anomaly . Harry exclaimed in his thoughts
Pansy ,who was with Draco packing the things up, spotted marks of red and purple on his neck. Her hand worriedly came to touch them as she asked, "What happened?"
Harry rose to push Draco on his back and mercilessly pound him. Draco was sobbing and choking on his own wails. He willed his hands to crawl away but was animalistically pulled back.
Tears were flowing across his cheeks to land on the sheets below. His eyes blushed red but face grew paler by the minute. Harry was moving frantically and maniacally, wanting to finish quickly, afterall he still had an evening meal with Ginny planned ahead . But the fast thrusts slowed when Draco refused to look at him. The flame of anger burned in his eyes and a sick emotion overtook his eyes.
His hands frantically reached for his pockets for his wand but returned empty. His eyes wildly looked around and finally landed on the seductive smirk sporting an equally seductive face of an ever seductive person. And coincidentally the same person had his wand .
Getting into the elevator, the doors were about to close after them , when an old grey haired man stopped it before saying, "Cattermole !"
Pansy cast a doubtful look towards her but still, albeit hesitantly, took the plate and started eating while curiously looking at the symbol from the corner of her eyes.
Draco gently nodded his head , his eyes lingering on the soft smile Harry gave him.  Harry was really handsome . His eyes twinkled when he smiled and it was as if they were drawing him in , trapping him there.
In an attempt to lighten the mood, Dumbledore asked with a mischievous shine in his eyes ," Oh yes ! Another thing, Harry. I have heard that you have been spending some time with Miss Granger as of present. Are you perhaps-"
Draco's eyes flashed a calculative gleam as he again assessed Potter from head to toe . It was better not to provoke  him . Draco didn't want any attention to himself right now . Revealing the tip of the iceberg did not seem a bad option if it meant getting Potter's hands and eyes off him . It was seriously scaring him .Looking in his eyes , Draco spoke ," What do you want to know ?"
" Are. You. An. Idiot !?!?! " ; He said, punctuating each word with pushing and pulling Draco's cheeks back and forth.
Walking to George and Fred, he asked silently but worried, "What is going on ? What happened to both of you ?"
Hearing Neville's astonished voice, Blaise slowly opened his eyes and the scenery around slowly returned to the green and silver furnishing.
A hand slowly crept towards Draco, resting on his face. A pair of glassy silver-blue eyes looked up, confused and frowning.
Draco silently closed his eyes and waited for the next instruction when he felt a foreign entity entering his body and mind , mixing in his blood and seeping in his magic . He felt searing pain in his body . His brow frowned and mouth pressed in a straight line . He could feel his brain burning from the inside and his magic stirring endlessly . He bit his tongue in an effort to not let any scream escape his throat and soundless whimpered.
Harry took a single glance at the dirty pile of laundry and his gaze instantly snapped towards the witch. His wand was already out, pointing towards the huge snake slithering out of the witch's mouth as the corner of her lips tore wider to accommodate it's thick girth. The sight itself was horrible and nightmarish. Someone of a frail heart would have already gone crazy because of fright. But it didn't make Harry's form falter. He had seen worse sights than this before, be it the forbidden forest or through Voldemort's visions.
Harry , Hermione and Pansy stood in the lift as the lift stopped again this time on level 3. As the door was about to open Harry calmly said , " If we don't find Umbridge within an hour then we find Ron and come back another day . Deal ? "
An enchanting and beautiful woman was laying on the hard ground  , curled up against a huge egg . She was cleary wounded greatly by the blood polling around her . The sight was gruesome but beautiful in a sick and bloody way . A blood-bathed beauty .
Harry slowly walked to the bed and seated himself beside the celestial beauty. His eyes were impossibly soft and filled with love. His fingertips brushed against silken platinum strands splayed on the pillow before following their trail to touch the forehead and eventually sliding down to palm the ruddy pale cheeks.
" Draco , we know that a lot is going on and you are trying but please don't make yourself sick . We as well as you cannot afford it ." Blaise followed practically .
Draco looked down to see a huge egg wriggling in his blanketed lap. It was just wriggling into his lap as if snuggling into him.
From behind him, Pansy came inside holding eggie in her arms. She didn't know what was the matter with this huge egg but instinctively knew that Draco and Harry both cared about it. So, she generously helped them bring it inside.
Even if they were enemies, Draco remembered his limits, remembered what he should say and what he shouldn't. Then why does Harry say words worse than death to him ? Why does he insult his parents at every word when Draco never even mentioned his in the 10 years they have known and fought each other ?
To Draco , quite a time passed but actually it was only a moment . Looking at Potter , he said ," I could not find anything . It keeps consuming all my magic . I was not even able to check it's health."
Neville was confused but eager to be the source of warmth for the boy….no, the man in front of him. The task to comfort a man who has suffered the world and the society is almost impossible for Neville. So he used the tactic Blaise had used minutes ago to comfort him.
Alas, he should not think of this now. It's never wise to worry about a problem that might not even come true. It's better to focus on the present and keep an eye on the future.
Harry looked at his side to Draco. This person , as cold and as biting as snow , inexplicably cooled his boiling anger from just a touch. He easily caught the wordless implication in Draco's eyes and slowly retreated to sit back down.
The insides and organs scattered here and there rotting and flies and insects feeding on them. He could clearly see the intestines piled on the floor like huge spaghetti, blackening blood on them like sauce.
In all this , Harry did not forget what was going outside of his personal bubble . He did not forget that he had a knife hanging above his head which could fall at any time. Looks like he had to speed things up. But that was not a problem.  Harry had always been fast .
" Professor, Do you know how she died? She died protecting me. She refused to step away . She was brave " Harry said solemnly.
Draco bowed his head to look at the elf and said with a barely there smile, " This locket belonged to your master Regulus and so it rightfully belongs to you now"
Outside the tent, a crowd huddled together not daring to go anywhere near the black-faced young master. All of them clearly heard the shout just now and also clearly saw the eyes spewing jets of fire.
No , he shouldn't do this. Not in the open. Not where their friends were steps away. Not when anyone could accidentally or intentionally see the pale and delicate skin Draco hid  beneath dark robes, covering his body from head to toe and only leaving his face visible. Harry was too petty, too selfish for even the possibility of something like that.
The man looked uncomfortable being asked this question . But looking at Draco's clear and shining eyes , the man sighed and gave up .
He passed the small vial to Hermione as she anxiously sprinkled the powder in the bleeding wound. The skin there slowly healed before closing up entirely. Hermione gave a big sigh of relief as she finally sat back.
Malfoy was stiff as a rock . Harry , satisfied with his demonstration , smiled shallowly . His threat firmly grounded in Malfoy's skin , his nerves and memory .
Thinking that inside of this is a baby made Draco feel a sweet warmth in his chest as he tucked the egg inside his robes to keep it warm .
Harry did not hesitate to answer. In the numerous tests with Dumbledore , he was never given an option. He was just thrust right into it , without a warning or help , where he either had to move ahead or die . He hated that part of Dumbledore , of people . The part where they think that they know what should be done . This simple action gave Harry a favorable impression of the oldman's morals.
The shock wore off when he saw the condition Draco was in. He was shuddering and silent tears were falling down his eyes with sweat mixing in. Without thinking twice, Harry rushed towards him. A slight distortion glowed when he crossed the array drawn below.
Looks like Malfoy did not like being touched . Finding such a good opportunity for years of revenge !!! How could he let it go so easily ?!?!
" Now coming to the actual topic. Malfoy and I think that a mutual alliance can be extremely beneficial for us , all of us. The ones agreeing please raise their hand",  Harry started .
Breaking the silence, Draco said , " I am glad that all of you have your arms and legs and are not overly furry ."
" Don't sit up . You're still weak. You fainted due to excessive exposure to magic " Harry informed seamlessly omitting half the fact. If Draco did not remember then it was better not to remind him. Afterall, given Draco's pride , hearing this he would probably spit blood and then proceed to choke on it and die .
Blaise hummed, stroking Neville's brows drenched in cold sweat, "Don't worry, professor. I won't neglect my studies in the favour of leisure enjoyment."
The next morning Harry woke up with newfound determination to break Slughorn's defences. Getting up and getting ready, he made his way to the great hall.
Saying this, Draco totally forgot the matter about eggie's appetite and started to pack their belongings as well. Thinking about their journey ahead , he felt that something was missing.
" What I mean is that you shouldn't tickle a sleeping beast , Malfoy . Don't let my gentleness fool you, I can me much more cruel when I want to "
It was a prize to him. It had always been . From the first time he met Harry at Madam Malkins to their years at Hogwards till now.
It was becoming a habit for Draco to learn from Luar's books and then try the cures  on the small animals that so needed it . There was not a shortage of them in the school gardens or at the edge of forbidden forest . Draco did not go in there , better to be safe as it was a delicate time . Days passed as Luar's personal library was falling short on Draco's progress and now Draco scanned the Hogward's library as well. Him and Luar had noticed that every time they wandered by him , Harry's eyes always followed them till out of sight . It was up to the point that it was starting to get creepy and harder to ignore. He chose to ignore it as Potter did not do anything else other than stare . Confronting Potter right now will be making an enemy out of the whole wizarding world . Potter had an unparalleled importance in this time . Draco cannot afford to offend him . Maintaining his distance is the only option and safe retreat .
After quickly finishing his part, Harry looked up and said, "Does anyone know who Gregorwitch might be?"
Draco's eyes travelled to the tombstone and the realization struck. As he looked at the barren tombstone, his eyes shone a hesitation which swiftly turned to determination when he thought of Harry's aggrieved eyes.
" It's nothing. Just that Slughorn is still as tight-lipped as ever. I need to get this done quickly", Harry replied.
The elf's head dropped in illogical shame, but this is how house elves were. They put the care of their master first before everything else and will feel responsible even if the fault is not theirs.
Cold sweat dropped down Ron's back but he remained firm. He had decided this , so he will follow it through.
He was silently talking with Hermione when suddenly his scare throbbed and started hurting. Pain spread across his forehead as he let out a pained groan and lowered himself to the ground.
Hearing the anxiety in his voice, Ron frowned and Hermione replied with a horrified face, "His condition was quite bad. He was taken to Madam Pomfrey. The rumors have already spread all around the school. Everyone is terribly scared. Harry, What exactly happened?"
Trailing down , a panting mouth moved across the rising and falling chest as a rough hand slowly slid past the waist belt and on the small tent there . Very lightly resting on top of it and feeling the small twitch .
She opened the page and the symbol revealed itself. It was a small triangle with a circle inside touching all three of its sides and a horizontal line coming from the top of the triangle and ending on the opposite side, perfectly dividing the figure. The symbol was drawn on the upper corner of the page and seemed very inconspicuous. If it was someone other than Hermione, they probably wouldn't have noticed it.
The clock ticked away and the silver rays turned to golden ones. It was already the start of another day. With this, Harry finally sorted out the jumble in his head and decided to find out the answers to his questions from the source himself. He hurriedly made his was to the Griffindor common room. On entering, he immediately came face to face with Hermione and Ron.
Harry held Draco, not once loosening his arms. He made no effort to comfort Draco, with actions or words. His head down and chin touching Draco's ear, he stayed in the same position, not moving an inch.
The blood red lips moved to leisurely utter," Ahh. Look what we have here "  The sound of her voice made chills pass through one's spine. It was apparent that the sight of Headmaster Dumbledore weak and at the door of death pleased her sick heart immensely.
Setting himself in the darkness , he moved forward in the blackness. It was then that a swift wind passed by him.
He sat there as Draco checked his body from front to back and from left to right. Honestly, he was enjoying this too much to be considered normal and not crazy or perverted.
After Ron left , Harry's attention went  back to the delectable body on his bed , wrapped in his blankets. Wandlessly , He switched the clothes Draco wore with his shirt and shorts . Neatly folding the uniform dropped on the ground and keeping it on his desk before changing his own clothes .
Walking out, Harry made his way into the forbidden forest . He had a very anxious feeling telling him that he was needed there. Passing Hagrid's hut , he entered the thick canopy . He started walking deeper into the forest , following his memory to lead him to the cave that he found with Malfoy earlier .
" No " Snape said as he calmly stepped inside the room. All the faces in the room moved to him. Some of them were relieved, so surprised and some calmly waiting for his next action.
What did they have to lose ? They only have each other left . If they are going to die, then let's do it together. If they are going to live, then let's do it together as well.
Hermione saw the aggrieved look on her face and found it especially lovely. So, she silently picked up the book and moved to sit beside Pansy, saying, "This is a good seat, isn't it? Near to the fire, warm and bright. Feels very comfortable, right?"
As Harry rested the egg beside Draco on the covers,  he slowly asked while dotingly laying his hand on top, "Hey, big guy . What made you pop out today ?"
It was then that Harry realised that his disguise had worn off . As soon as they got off the lift , shouts rang out , " Harry Potter ! That's Harry Potter! "
A fulfilling family was what he yearned for. But he was grateful that he was never granted this wish and instead achieved a family thousand times better. He had a family who loved him unconditionally , not because he was their own blood or because they shared the same surname , but because they loved him. The family he had now was solely there because of unconditionally love and loyalty mingled with pride and happiness shared between them.
This said, the minister of magic might be already dead if not captured. Time is running like fine sand from their hands. With each passing day, the situation keeps getting more fatal.
Draco handed Pansy a plate while he slowly coaxed Theo into eating from the other plate, saying, " Don't sleep with an empty stomach. Eat this plate clean and you can go to sleep again"
A twig crunched behind him . Draco turned back and found a very confused potter there standing there . Stunned , Draco stood there , staring at Potter as he stared back . His mind in a panick as he wondered if Potter saw what him perform wandless magic but then decided against it and struggled to squash his anxiety .A small moment from potter brought him back as he quickly analysed his situation and decided on getting out of here as fast as possible .
From behind him, Harry was curiously reading as a look of realisation flashed in his face. Seeing the recognition, Draco asked, " You're aware about papa, aren't you?"
His body shook in the fear of unknown danger as he felt the now unconcealed steps of someone walking around him to stand close to his face. He wanted to close his eyes but even they were completely frozen. He could only watch as a pair of hazel-green eyes glowed, slowly coming closer to him.
The loud shout completely awoke Draco as he instantly sat up. And the first sight he saw was of a small baby sitting in a huge egg covered with disgusting transparent liquid.
It has almost been two months since the bathroom incident . The time was spent effectively and not wasted but the thing needed was still not obtained. The information on the marks were so rare that he had only found about 5-6 books with anything about them and most of them repeated the same theory . It was all the same as Luar's book . Nothing more was ever sighted but less was frequently found . Almost all of the ancient magic was lost and Luar's texts would easily pass for a treasure .
Swiftly changing his clothes into his nightwear , Harry unhesitatingly slipped inside the covers . Willing his magic to draw the curtains tight , Harry scooped the lithe body in his arms as darkness fell on both of them.
Draco was still unsure and kept behind Harry. After all, if a supposed attack came then Mr. Hero Potter can probably fight it but on the other hand , someone like him who is an esteemed potion student, charms and array expert and a healer apprentice, cannot .
Above their heads, a hoard of Dementors were floating , only constrained by a single layer of protection. The fear the woman felt was obvious from this arrangement.
Well , it wasn't everyday you get the golden boy as your stalker !!! Draco swore that it was a medal worthy feat !!!!
With a smile, Harry took the question as  accepting his apology and replied, " I made the killing curse hit an invisible creature instead of Dumbledore and simultaneously pushed both of you down "
" Belonged to his mother . Difficult to find. But -" Dumbledore lifted his hand , showing the blackened and dried skin ." Even more difficult to destroy "
Harry did not make much of this . He knew how stubborn Draco was. The house elf had no chance of making Draco listen to him. So Harry easily threw a reassurance that it wasn't the elf's fault before dismissing him. Afterall , he is here now, it's obvious that Harry will personally look after his precious darling.
{ Being an antique piece* -  having a different or peculiar personality compared to others . Like an rare antique art piece between hundreds of commonly found art pieces .}
Harry cradled Draco's feet in his hand like a treasure, careful and delicate. He slowly bent down to tenderly press his lips to the translucent skin of Draco's ankle. His green eyes filled with adoration and love as he looked at the slumbering beauty.
Sensing the warmth on his scalp , Draco lifted his head again to give Harry a last scathing look before tightly closing his eyes and burying his face in the egg between them . Harry looked on as Draco's whole body stretched tight , readying itself for his hands , for his touch .
Harry lifted his neck to gaze at the dark sky as snow danced in the air, melancholy clear in his voice, "Yeah"
Before Draco could finish , Harry made a swift motion with his hand and Ron fell to his knees , screaming due to the pain in his legs.
When Harry turned back , he continued," I can't leave . My - my friends . I need to speak to them first . Also I still have to tell you something. Something important."
Malfoy winced again and silently regretted his decisions . Why was he such a fool ? Now he not only got himself exposed to Potter but also threatened . He was a shame to Slytherins , wasn't he ?
Seeing Draco , Ron's face sported a disgusted sneer . The reaction did not escape Draco but he kept his face neutral and chose to ignore him. On the other hand , Pansy had noticed as well and raised her ever ready wand when a hand lightly tapped it . She turned to see Blaise indicating towards Draco who gently swayed his head from side to side , telling her to stop. Even if she hated the gryffindor , she respected and valued Draco more. Her wand slowly lowered.
A tall slim man stepped in the dark, his eyes directly staring into the haunting emerald ones. The grim face slowly slowly shook from side to side , indicating to stop.
And he did succeed. Look how the same Draco was in his bed, whoring himself out because Harry wanted him to, because Harry had left him no other option.
Taking the vial out of his breast pocket, he opened the cork under the eyes of his trusted ones . Drinking it in one go , he lowered the vial. His body didn't feel any different. What felt different was his mind. He felt lighter , easier and more in control than ever.
The waist was not thin like that of a woman but of ample diameter. Even through the dress shirt, Blaise could still feel the soft and flexible skin underneath. When he gripped this part not long ago, his fingers had dug into the plump flesh there, probably leaving a red handprint on them.
Hermione clearly knew that Pansy didn't have any obligation to shield her from that curse at the ministry, just like she didn't have any obligation to pick her up from her house. But she still did. And it wasn't because of anything other than her own heart.
" There's something wrong with them . You briefly read about soul connections , didn't you ? There is something strange with your parental soul connections . Which is quite baffling . Tell me Draco . Do your parents pay attention to you ?"
" Don't worry . Just let his safely sleep here  for one night and when he wakes up tomorrow , he can take care of himself . Just it would have been excellent if you told Pansy that we had some business to take care of and will return till early morning "
Draco closed his eyes and infused his magic inside her , trying to maybe heal some of her injuries . He knew that Harry was there and exposing himself like this can bring unimaginable consequences , but all his life he had seen people died . Just like that , their eyes losing the light and body crumpling down . He always wished to do something , save someone but could not . This time there was no one stopping him , he could atleast try to save her . And for Harry , what was the worst thing that could happen ? He would have a additional tension on his head but he knew that no matter what , Harry will not sell him out .
Harry just shrugged and asked in a voice dripping with sarcasm  ," You know you have to ask permission before free loading at someone's place ?"
Harry's eyes were stuck on Draco, not wanting to miss even the tiniest trembling of his lashes and the quietest huff of his breath.
Harry noticed that the soul seemed a bit lost. He was wary. But the wariness was not directed towards him but towards Eloise.
He did know what the future holds but he knows that this boy is destined for a difficult and deadly but great and powerful path .
A shout louder than the whistle of Hogward's express rang around the room. Draco pushed an unguarded Harry right down the bed. His eyes were wide in horror as he shouted , " What are you doing here ?!! How dare you make me touch that ??!! HOW DARE YOU ??! "
A curvy body lay on the leaves covered ground of the forest. The cold in the surrounding slowly draining the warmth in her.
Harry got up from the bed and the warm body it nestled and reluctantly walked away to open the windows. As soon as the glass opened, an owl flew inside carrying several letters.
The death eaters turned around, one of them saying, " Heir Zabini. I didn't expect you to come forward and make such pleasant greetings with us"
" The night of the red moon…." Draco whispered to himself the look of intense inner probing and wondering clear on his face.
" No, it is too risky . You don't know , but there is a great risk to his life . If anyone knew that he fainted then they will try their best to kill him . Sending him there is no less than sending a pig for slaughter !"
The voice gave off an image of a elderly man apologizing with wrinkled eyebrows and downwards tilted mouth. The pair of glassy, regret filled eyes was a big fat cherry on top. Instead of making a delicious pastry, the image was that of a near to tears, regretful old man, making people feel guilty enough to just kill themselves with emotions without even moving a finger.
" Y-yes, Master Harry !!" The house elf's voice was jubilant and cheerful. He was clearly very happy and walked with a slight skip and bounce in his steps.
" I am fine , Headmaster. Just some mishap during positions " Draco lied and Harry did not object. It depends on Draco what he wants others to know about him.Harry did not need and wish to say otherwise.
Another death eater smiled in satisfaction, happy to see a youth with the same likes as their own, saying, " You surely know your game, Heir Zabini. It's rare to find such a cultivated gentleman with superior hobbies as you now-a-days. The ranks aren't too far for you"
He said in a nonchalant voice, "Professor, It is very unprofessional to damage your student's goods, don't you know?" His eyes were still cold and unfeeling with just slight aggravation similar to a child whose favorite toy had been damaged. "What if he breaks? I still haven't played enough, you know."
Then the death eater's eyes flew towards Neville for a brief second, as he said mockingly, " Truly, Heir Zabini, I didn't expect for a lion to hide in the snake pit. I guess stopping the instincts to protect one's own kind is a moral torture, is it ?"
His eyes brightened with recognition, "I remember! That's Bathilda Bagshot, The author of «A History of Magic»!"
George and Fred: Young Master ! Please show mercy ! Leave us some face in front of our cutie ! How can we woo him if you keep putting our face in the mud ?! Harry ! Atleast, you are our brother ! Please have mercy on us ! Why should we suffer such injustice because of your fault?! Come fast and coax your darling ! Leaving your darling angry is not a gentleman's behaviour, don't you know ?!
Now, what plans ? You must be thinking. And if your mind is dirty enough and my prophecies are accurate enough, then something that definitely has the potential of giving eggie a younger sibling.
Dobby who stood to the side watching this exchange was first astonished and then a firm look rose in his eyes. The hesitation he felt before coming here was still there but the newfound confidence won. He moved forward to stop in front of Draco and looked up to meet the silver eyes that turned cold as soon as they saw him , but Dobby didn't falter and asked, " Master Draco , Dobby wants to ask master Draco something "
After being instructed , Draco quickly learned that it wasn't as hard as he thought . Casting a mirror spell , Draco checked if he could wear it right and found that he looked somewhat different with the bowtie . Not-so-stiff , but still demanding respect . Elegant , mannered and aristocratic , that's what he looked like . A true son of nobility . Even if he was wearing it on silk pajamas .
This day was much more hectic and tiring for Draco and combining the lack of sleep his condition was terrible. Draco looked up from his plate to spot Potter absolutely healthy and  bright .
Eloise tsked and waved his hand . A book appeared in his palm . He gave it to Harry and said ," This is your first lesson.  Learn it properly . The first lesson for any warrior is of defence on the outside as well as inside. He should know to protect his mind from the known and the unknown. Now , don't disturb . Forming an illusion is not an easy task , even for me . "
"An urgent Christmas gift, I assume?", The witch questioned but there was a surety present in her voice. She sounded like she was very certain but still attached the "-is it?" for the sake of politeness.
"Yes , It was probably the poison in her blood which turned the plants purple . When the woman died she had the same hue in her neck . I can only conclude that she choked on her own blood which turned purple due to the poison and killed her almost immediately ." ; Frowning , Malfoy supplied .
Their mixed blood glowed like rubies , swirling together and  forming two crimson beads . One of which sped towards Harry as he lifted his hand in an attempt of self defence , ultimately colliding with his wrist before disappearing entirely. While the other sped towards Draco as he turned his body sideways with hunched shoulders with the grace of natural instincts to shield his vital parts. Not stopping, the bead unhesitatingly melted into the side of Draco's neck.
" Look Malfoy. Look how hungrily you take my cock. Is this an inherent talent from your mother? Huh, tell me? Or is it your father?"
The tongue leisurely swept past the entirety of the palm , licking the fingers , joints and the knuckles. Tasting the white fluid as if it was the sweetest honey .
"Ah ! Wat ar ya daing !?! Lave me tis istace !!!! " ; Draco said with his cheeks still squashed. Pulling Harry's hands to no avail.
"Ahh, such is the vigor of youth. Sure, I am getting on my years. And for the courtesy of your question, I am a memory."
The despair grew into grievance in her eyes. Hermione was lost in her thoughts when a loud bang echoed outside, spontaneously waking Pansy as well.
"You ungrateful child !!!! I told you not to do it because I sensed this boy ! He might look simple but he is hiding much ! Even I am unable to guess what it is ! But he feels very similar to a person I knew , a very powerful person . And look where he got you ! You are right in his grasp ! Like a fool jumping right into the well , full well knowing that it already has a beast !!!  "
Seeing his second death near , Luar hurriedly said , wanting to divert Draco's attention ," Do you have something you always carry with you ? Maybe  jewellery ? I can't go out like this . I will be visible to everyone . I need something to hide ."
Draco speculated if he should tell Harry or not. Then thought , Fuck it ! He already made a mutual blood pact with Harry. He can't do anything to harm Draco.
Harry sighed tiredly and stayed quiet. But to Draco it clearly looked like he was looked down upon. Like he was a person too idiotic for his attention. A Malfoy can take everything but he will never take being looked down upon.
She looked at the herbs on her body and looked back up . Her eyes turned from wary to confused and to grateful as realisation dawned on her .
With a steady hand he opened the door. A shriek laughter rang out as Bellatrix came out. The joy on her face was maniacally merry.
Getting up , he washed up , he  changed his clothes and finally went down for dinner . He will think about what to do later. For now , let's go with the flow .
Harry did not even realise that he was staring. And Draco who was confused and scared did not dare to move an inch. For one because there was no space to move with how close Harry was . And another was that his back had goosebumps with the way Harry was looking at him. Like if he even dared to move his eyes away, he will go berserk, like he will eat Draco whole.
Well , how can you take a sweet shy boy and overall Draco's small pampered sworn brother out on a suicide mission ?
Draco hastily moved backward , the chains binded with the cuffs clinking. He was terrified . Not of the pain but of the words. They were the worst at such times. But his fear did nothing other than flame the fire.
But these words weren't uttered and kept inside Neville's overly kind and considerate heart, like they always did .
Some time had gone by till Draco felt his consciousness come back. At the same time he felt his tired and heavy body. His eyelids refused to open and his limbs felt as heavy as rocks. Finally coming to himself, Draco remembered what happened and inevitably started to panic.
The primal lust in Harry's eyes was enchanting and terrifying at the same time. His eyes looked as if cups of sweet emeral poison. His magic , being more honest than himself, slithered to wrap around the slim and shapely limbs and slipped inside the white fabric of his shirt.
Draco carefully leaned forward and sunk his teeth in the exact same spot that Nagini had bitten off. The bite was deep as Harry's blood gushed out.
Groggily sitting up, he innocently rubbed his eyes and yawned as a soothing voice said in the background , " Still sleepy? Why don't you sleep more ? I will wake you up" before gently drawing him back down again.
The terror was too great and overwhelming for a soft marshmallow like  Neville as his wide eyes rolled  back and he promptly fainted with fright.
After taking a moment to ready himself , Draco spoke quietly in a barely heard mumble. But Harry heard it loud and clear.
Even if Pansy was thin , her weight was something considerable , though not much for Hermione , only enough to make her slightly bend forward. Hermione felt the soft mounds of an ample chest and a warm body slightly more curvy than herself on her back. The warmth burned her as if ignited hot coal.
Draco stared at Harry, processing what he heard. Not believing that Harry would take it upon himself to interrogate him and even more so after hearing his question. He could not make the head or tail of Harry's question but it was the answer that made his heart squeeze all over again. Seconds passed and Draco eventually said, "What is it to you, Potter? Looking for another chance to show off your heroism?", He said in an equally monotone voice, all the while struggling to get out of bed. To get away from the question, away from Harry.
At a point it completely stopped as did the woman's thrashing . Draco slowly backed away . Still dazed from the suddenness of all of this . The egg was still there . He looked at it and remembered the woman's words
Looking at Draco's innocent face urging him , the man fell in deep thought . What use was it staying here? For all he knew , he might be in the netherworld , already . He might not even remember their promise.  He might not even remember him . But then again , he was a Malfoy and Malfoys do not give up just because they were scared.  If he was here , he can be found . If he was in the netherworld , he can be followed . If he did not remember , he can be reminded .
His hands swiftly retreating and Draco's worried gaze roamed about Harry, "You were fine just now. What happened so suddenly?!"
Pansy and Hermione stepped out, their eyes were dazzled by the scene in front. Their eyes grew wide from wonder and astonishment and their hearts stumped.
The shopkeeper squinted her eyes, "Hmm. Let's see. This is one of the best items I have got. So, how about 10 galleons ?"
The trembling intensified as the moonlit beauty panted with huffs of warm air leaving past his glistening lips. A second pair of lips came down to stop a hair's breadth away. A distinct gulp was heard as a protruded throat bobbed up and down . Then slowly two pairs of lips barely brushed one another and parted as briefly as they met .
Harry shouted spells after spells at the animal as the pain in his scar kept increasing. Soon, the pain became unbearable and Harry took a step back as his gaze started swimming. Voices started swimming in his head,
Neville, who was still trying to break away from the stubborn hold, was instantly stunned when he found that instead of the green blankets beneath them, now there was the cold earth. His astonished gaze lifted to meet an endless valley of lavender fields around him.
"Hush, now. It's fine. Its all is fine.", The voice was elderly and gentle but still held with it some playfulness .
Harry woke up before the first ray of the sun. The sensation of a warm body in his arms made a happy smile light his face. Draco's eyes were tightly closed. The curly blond tresses formed tiny shadows beneath his eyes. The breaths were slow and deep.
With the plan ready, the only thing to do now was to wait. The day passed by student questioning Harry about last night and what happened, trying to know everything that was there. But regardless of their efforts, Harry only had the tears sliding off  pale cheeks in his thoughts. Dinner soon came. The hallways emptied as students rushed to sate their hunger.
Fortunately, the wound wasn't deep enough to show bones or else moving forward with him would have been impossible.
" There are many idiots in this world. Stupid people who trust blindly and suffer terribly. And we are in no hurry to join their team. Don't you agree ?"
Hermione silently sat beside an asleep Pansy. The girl had come distraught to her tent in the middle of the night after finding that Draco had disappeared.
As the man tried to rise from the chair he had been cornered in two wands pressed on his skin. One belonging to Kreacher pressed his stomach while the other belonging to Pansy pointed to the forehead. Telling which one was more fatal was impossible but his gut told him that both were dangerous.
The man's eyes hardened,"  The way ahead is tough . You can't back away even if you want . Is this your final decision?"
Draco spelled to levitate Pansy as they led the twins to their camp. As the clearing grew near, the twins caught the sight of Ron sitting on a nearby log.
Harry's eyes widened and Draco visibly panicked ," Wait! listen ! I am not insane enough to let my own people die. Even If it means saving the whole lot of you while simultaneously risking death. That's why I am telling you about this. There is a vanishing cabinet in the room of requirements linked to another one at Borgin and Burkes . "
Harry slowly rose , ready to make his half of preparations as well but suddenly remembered something and said, " And we will be using muggle means. So be ready "
In came the figure of a fat and clearly disgusting man from the look on his face and deceit in his eyes. Kreacher sitting on his head , clutching his nose through the finger in his nostrils and Dobby holding on to his leg made it difficult to walk making his limp instead.
" Yes , all the other rooms in the mansion are dirty and untidy. This elf didn't know that Master Harry would be coming back so this elf didn't clean. Please punish this elf !!" The shrill voice hurriedly said and a good natured smile graced Harry's face, totally antonymous from the glare a minute ago .
The look in the man's eyes was cold , dark , disciplined . It was the first time Draco had seen him like this since he came here. Although Draco only knew him for half a day , still somehow he knew that the man was as soft and sweet  as a marshmallow in hot chocolate . Seeing the look on his face , Draco was stunned . He thought ,' Now he looks like a Malfoy '. Draco calmly replied ," I don't have much time . I choose the first one . Even if it hurts me like death ."
Neville lowered his head to hide and Blaise thought he was shy. He bent his head to peer under the bangs and was stunned to fat tears falling out of red and glassy eyes.
As he reached deeper in the forest to find a secluded but safe place , he noticed the dead trail of plants. Realising it was the same trail he and Harry followed months ago, he didn't stop but continued. It must have become like this because of the effect of the purple poison.
The time for breakfast was already over , going there was not possible . Thinking about breakfast , Draco felt something in his heart as if a child was pitifuly pulling his clothes and he instinctively knew it was their eggie doing it because he was very hungry . Feeling guilty , he hurriedly took out the big egg . Taking Harry's hand , he gave a hard bite and kept it on the egg and followed by biting his own to keep it on the egg as well.
Harry and his mother laughed at  his father as he , in an attempt to show his manliness , puffed his chest so wide that they thought it might burst.
Reining the beast in , Harry soothed the violent fluctuations in his heart . Patience , He will have his chance . And when that time comes, it will be Harry reflected in those eyes. It will be him showered with care and love and gentleness . Him , before anyone else .
Harry hummed in approval as his expression slowly grew softer. The long pale eyelashes above Draco's closed eyes fluttered, teasing Harry's heart.
Looking at the half filled lamp, Harry suddenly asked, "Will it work if another wizard also put their blood in it ?"
As he was lost in his thought, the sound of the back door in the kitchen opening reached their ears. Everyone in the house and them as well made their way towards it.
Theo followed as well," I agree. And you all should as well. After all, the same goes with Potter, doesn't it ?" His intelligent and sharp eyes conveyed a snake's stealth and fox's crafty thoughts.
The rage and anger in Harry's eyes was overflowing, threatening to break out. How? How can he be so stupid ?! Calling that cursed name out loud even after knowing what it does !
A pair of eyes as blue as summer sky averted themselves , refusing to look at the person the mouth was addressing.
" I am still not over the worry . I think you should visit Professor Pomfrey. I can request her to come if the pains too much"   Saying this he stood to send a patronus but was stopped by Draco.
He nodded but said sternly, " I won't let the others go that way so don't wander too far. If you aren't back in 20 minutes, I am coming to find you. And be careful of unknown presences, wizards or magical creatures. Okay ?"
Gasps were heard all around . And Hermione stutteringly called out ," H-harry"   But instantly shut up with a single glare.
A sudden helplessness overwhelmed his being. Harry felt useless. He could do nothing to help other than wait for Draco to wake up.
" But you shouldn't hurt him like that. It was too much. Too inhumane " Draco said sharply as he gently wiped the blood off. His words and actions were so different.
Harry took out the locket of Slytherin from where it was against his neck, saying , "We have to deal with this soon"
He stopped to further lower his head. His nose buried in the crook of Draco's neck. Breathing in, Harry's head was filled with the clean scent of water and herbs akin to a flowing waterfall surrounded by lush green forest. He smelled inebriating.
A content sigh escaped Harry as the warmth of slumber shrouded them. Soon, two even and deep breaths entangled with each other. A larger body protectively curled around the smaller and slimmer body in his arms.
" Draco is a descendant of my family, accompanying him is my responsibility, moral as well as delight ", Luar sounded offended at being asked this even after informing them that he was from the Malfoy line.
This garnered Draco's attention as he  subconsciously felt the magic in his body and around it , finding that his magic did feel more at ease . It was like before his magic could not move very fluidly in his body but now it moved around more freely and his body lost some of its rigidity . He was not particularly rigid , in fact , was physically very flexible , but he did not feel very comfortable in his own skin before . Now , his muscles were loose and his magic was more adapted . Overall , it felt much better .
Draco's hand did not stop, did not rest. Two tight fists were still hitting Harry's back. A tired sound spilled from Draco's mouth, " Let me go ! I am going to beat you into a pulp ! Ugh ! Let me go !!"
As soon as the sound reached Harry's ears, his wand rose swiftly firing two spells in fast successions.
" I assume that you are aware that the Headmaster is going to die if he doesn't do anything about his hand ?"
No . It can't be that right ? For the golden boy to use a dark spell …. It definitely can't be true . But still…
Draco was still half asleep when he felt a gentle caress on his head. Groggily opening his eyes, Draco saw the blurry picture of a dark and defined face.  Squinting his eyes further , his vision cleared to spot Harry sitting beside him, gently stroking his head.
The bloody pit in the flesh and muscles on Harry's shoulder was deep enough to show bones. The bleeding didn't stop and the poison was constantly spreading in his bloodstream.
Draco again looked at the man to see him looking at Draco with adoration in his eyes . And he stilled for a second . When was the last time someone looked at him like that ? When was the last time someone looked at him with the gaze of an elder looking at the child of his family ? Then he remembered . It was probably in third year . So long ago .At this time , Draco realised truly how lonely he was , how he was forced to  grow up sooner , how many responsibilities were on his tender shoulders . But , then again , it wasn't just him . It was all of them . Potter , Granger , Weasley , Blaise , Pansy , everyone . They were children of war.  Here , they either grow up or die . It was the truth and Draco understood that .
With that, Draco swiftly turned around and carefully made his way a dozen steps behind the old hag, slowly and cautiously following her. Harry sighed helplessly and kept his pace firm beside Draco, not even falling a step ahead or behind. In case something really happened, Harry is fully prepared to protect Draco.
" Don't worry, it won't be anything outrageous. I just need direct unbreakable insurance. What if you betray Draco? I wish to take no chances. This is a matter for life and death for not only me but also Draco, Blaise and Theo. One small mistake can kill us all"
His voice quivering, partly due fear for the future and partly due to guilt. But he didn't stop because he knew that there were demons just behind him, lurking in his shadow.
She was clutching her stomach while laughing loudly, the red veins in the white of her eyes were clearly visible. She had lost it. Draco did not flinch nor did he move . He was in the same place , like a statue . Why would he be afraid of her when he was more or less the same ?
That night , Harry silently sneaked out after curfew to make his way towards Slytherin dormitories . It was fairly easy with the cloak and the boon of parseltongue .
Everyone curiously stretched their necks to see. But Pansy was weak so she couldn't go there to inspect the symbol with everyone but instead sat quietly looking at the excitement.
Harry continued, now cool and calm by Draco's deliberate grace, catching everyone's gaze one by one , slowly letting them understand his words and actions.
Seeing that Harry was staring at his father , his mother said in an angry voice while hitting him  ," James , What did you do ? Why did my baby cry ?"
The slender arms were around him, hugging him like a koala clung to its tree.Harry's warm eyes soon darkened and became hot. His boiling blood from last night still didn't completely cool down. It didn't take much to set it bubbling again. In fact, the sight of Draco's face and memories from yesterday were enough.
Harry looked at the pale beauty who frowned aggrievedly. His silly beauty still couldn't find where the problem was. Stubborn, as he was, he continued to search, a pout slowly and unconsciously rising on his lips.
The black wisp ran here and there in Draco's body, forcing his veins to internally suffer . Luar was chasing it with every ounce of his ability but the thing was very quick and fast to escape.
" Pig ? To believe such atrocious words to be heard from the Slytherin Prince !!! What will the other snakes say ? I guess such behaviour is to be expected considering that Slytherin are a bunch of species lacking in decency" ; Harry irked whisperingly as his other hand drew closer as if to lay on top of Draco's head. It was obviously a threat . If he willed to utter anything else , he won't have one but two hands on himself .
"Silly child . It's good that no one bullied you or this father would have come himself to see who has the guts to bully my son !!!".
Seeing the anger and fear mixed in Harry's eyes, Draco paused and gazed deep into them. Harry was angry. He was angry because of Draco. He was angry thinking that something would happen to Draco. The discovery calmed his irritated heart in the single flutter of his tresses.
Entering the Headmaster's office , Harry saw the elder sitting behind his desk. Hearing his entrance , Headmaster Dumbledore looked up to see his dear pupil .
Seeing that they were still tense , Draco ,countering Harry's strictness , said calmly," Why don't all of us sit down ? I am sure that all of you are eager to know the subject of this urgent request. "
" Shhhh. Calm down. It's okay. I know. I know. It's going to be fine ", Harry's gaze held an unspoken understanding as if a flicker of Draco's tresses was enough for him to read his thoughts.
Even if Harry felt all the annoyance and irritation he had for it , the fond exasperation in his heart didn't lessen by even a bit.
Ensuring that she was alright, Draco lifted his gaze from where he was kneeling, "Who did this to her ?"
"Hhmmm" Harry replied as he stood up and handed the egg to Draco . He soon dug a pit to bury the woman . After burying her , both he and draco knelt in front of the grave and silently paid their respects .
Harry snapped out of his dark thoughts when the door creaked again and this time it were certain gryffindors who entered. Hermione and Ron were quick in action while Neville was shocked into a statue.
"Ahhh~ My heart !", Harry muttered with a groan as he rubbed the warm flesh of his chest right above his heart. But this did nothing to relieve the pleasurable sting and ecstatic pain thrumming there.
Realisation flashed across several pairs of eyes . Harry and Draco looked at each other to see the same gleam of calculations shining on their faces. They effortlessly understood the other as if two bodies but one heart.
Blaise looked at the soft face. The eyes looking at him were terrified and flew wide. Something in them had Blaise softening, relaxing. It had him backing down.
The emotions Draco had kept choked, the unsaid fear he had for this day , had finally escaped the empty vase Draco had made out of himself . It escaped erratically, frantically, in the form of rage, in the form of tears, in the form of biting words. They all fell like heavy drops of rain from a black cloud , travelling with the storm and laughing with the thunder.
He slipped the file inside again. The sound of a man placating the crowd and telling them to calm down carried to his ears. Harry with his face impassive and calm again , opened the door and stepped out.
Harry readily fired spells one after the other as more and more wounds were obvious on the snake's skin. Soon, the snake was heavily injured and they found an opening to escape. Just as Harry raised his wand, the snake frantically started to thrash it's tail around, throwing bricks and ruins of the room towards them. It was as if it knew that they were going to escape.
They looked older than the pictures he had of them . Time gifting them the wrinkles and reverence . They were talking with the Weasleys as they stood waiting for someone . Him maybe .
Standing in front of the store, Draco noticed that while the entire town has a cheerful atmosphere, this shop shines particularly different because of its introverted but gentle air. But at the same time, these qualities also made it look hidden and unnoticed.
The man said in a hypocritic and patronizing tone, like a mentor teaching his ward, "Work and play should indeed be balanced. Considering your recent grades, I allow you to take this class off to rest and take your…
The hand on Harry's mouth was already pulled back as he provoked further," or what ? You are going to hex me into what ?"
Getting up he made his way towards the horde . Harry watched sitting at the side . Draco carefully healed Ron as all of them silently obeyed him and helped him. This was why he did what he did.
The girth kept impaling him again and again and soon his body gave out. His eyes grew hazy and unfocused as his body slumped down, going soft on the bed.
Ignoring the awkwardness , they slowly made their way to the castle . Entering the huge hallways , Harry slowly guided a very awkward Draco to the seventh floor .
Draco followed ," Harry and I have decided that mutually working together will benefit us more than working apart. Since all of us have essentially the same destination. "
Was it guilt that made his throat clog up and heart squeeze? Guilt? Sympathy? Anger? Hate? Resentment? ….No. It was none of these. It was entirely different or maybe a well-stirred potion made of all of these.
At once, the attention of everyone in the room was on him as he slowly continued,  " Here, in the black mansion, there's a room on the first storey belonging to….to….Regulus Articulus Black "
"Little one, you sure are restless. By doing this, I only meant to heal you a little faster. I mean no ill intention. After all, it were my inscribes which harmed you.  And no, you did not get caught.",  It said as it chuckled gently at the last bit. A somewhat foolish amusement lingering in the sound.
Giving him a small smile , he said ," Do you know that once I had a fish ? It was a wee little creature . I got it from a student of mine, you know…..One day on my desk, I found a small glass pot with only inches of clear water and floating on top was a petal. I watched as it sank down and just before it touched the bottom , it transformed into a fish . It was beautiful magic, you know . Beautiful…... The petal was from a lily . Your mother. Then one day , the fish just vanished . Gone , disappeared. It was the day your mother-"
Suddenly remembering he said, " Why don't you go down and pack some snacks for the way ? It's going to be a long journey and I still don't advise using magic yet. "
Blaise was even more panicked and didn't hesitate anymore. His arms tightened impossibly around Neville to hold him from escaping. As he tightly closed his eyes, concentrating on what he wanted to do.
Harry said nothing only sighed. The things that are supposed to happen will always happen no matter what.
" Good ,  it has been a long tradition in The Pheonix Warriors  . My master had me take it . I will have you take it . This test is made to push your limits in the most overwhelming way . It may be your deepest desire or your greatest fear or all of it together . I do not have tricks or clues to give you , kid. This is all about you . The only piece of advice I give you is -  no matter what , Do Not Give Up . Keep going even if you feel you can't anymore . "
It was a plea. Draco was begging. He was doing this to keep the last ounce of self respect he had. Anymore and Draco would break entirely. He had suffered days of torture and tens of crucios at the hands of dark lord but never had he come so close to breaking, to giving up. But now , the cracks on his soul were widening, increasing. Draco was on the edge of losing sanity.
He was losing all his hope as his vision was slowly fading. Draco was going to die , he knew it. Well, at least he tried.
" No , not that . Malfoy rings are enchanted. Going in there is not hiding but imprisoning yourself "
As well, Draco and Harry have slight character changes. Draco now is more practical and straightforward. He is willing to do something to get his mother out and not just give up to fate. He is scared but willing to be braver, also he is haughty and prideful as always but now more tactful.
The sooty skull was thrashing, screaming.  Harry did not give up and kept pulling. It was not working. He was growing frantic when - SLASH !
Harry could feel Malfoy's magic , cool and calm .  If comparing Harry's magic to Draco's then Harry's was like the magma swirling and boiling in the depth of earth , tightly controlled while Draco's magic was like a single pearl at the bottom of a deep dark sea , silent and cold . One inexorably dangerous and the other cryptically mysterious .
" But there were two , weren't there ? Where's the other one ? " Asked Draco in his smooth silvery voice.
The revelation lit a spark in her chest. As Pansy heard the softened words of gratefulness , her eyes angrily lifted, "What thankyou?! I only did this becau-"
"Merlin… What will I do with you, Potter ?", He sighed with exasperation. These over-dramatics are really giving him a headache. "Let's go. Where do you want to visit first ?"
The office itself was overly exaggerated. It looked more like a doll house than an office. The lavish desk had tea cups and cookies rather than pen and paper.
Draco weakly resisted the hold , his eyes alight with terror but his mouth not uttering a word or even a cry. He will not give Harry the pleasure to see his pain.
" Oh no . If he wants to die then who are we to stop. Let the Wizarding world see Dumbledore die but he will still be alive in the basement of a certain school. "
Looking at the hand covering an open mouth and pitiful wide eyes, Draco sighed helplessly, "Okay okay. Remind me to teach you the wonderful art of theatrics after all of this is over."
"Protect mom and Ginny when we know that they are safe with dad, Percy and Charlie ?! And leave our baby brother whose condition we don't even know alone?!"
Draco felt a sharp gaze on his neck which sent a cold shiver down his back. The feeling of being watched was so intense that it made him scared. He turned around and happened to catch Harry's eyes who turned to Ron and pretended as nothing happened. Seeing Harry, Draco's brain short-circuited and every memory that he forgot for last night came rushing back. His mouth fell open and in his head was running a marathon of "no no no no no no no no no no no NO !!!". He struggled with giving his usual scowl to Harry when he again caught his eyes and this time the dangerous feeling was so strong that he was paralyzed.
Everyone was silent . Their gazes trained on Pansy's face. Blaise was the first to say, " Okay " . His tone nonchalant as if saying yes to a drinking party and not a binding contract.
At his cold tone, the witch visibly calmed down and said, "Well, then feel free to browse the shelves. Everything on the shelves is on sale. I hope that you will find your fate here."
Hermione's hazel eyes scrunched in worry and guilt as she looked at the petite girl who was laying in front of her. Her hand came forward as if wanting to soothe her brows which were frowning due to discomfort. But soon stopped just a hair's breadth away from the pale cheeks.
But what can she do ? What can she do other than erasing her existence from their life so that they can live ? What can she do other than leaving them with an aching heart in her chest so that they do not forget to smile as she had ? What can she do other than abandoning them so as to protect them ? Because now the only danger that threatened their life was her existence.
Blaise's reputation of being a lady's man wasn't, by any means, low-key. It was an open secret at Hogward's that Blaise Zabini was a man who appreciated the pleasure of skin. How could Neville even believe such words with this knowledge ?
The door opened and in front of them , with pink all over like a pink panther but not as smart and not as pretty as well, stood Dolores Umbridge.
Harry carefully picked up Draco and laid him down on the bed . It was then that he saw the wet patch in his trousers. A shuddering breath passed through Harry's dry throat into his chest cooling his hot blood mystically boiling there.
" Yes ,let's go . I have made all your favourites . Meat pie , baked chicken and your favorite chocolate cake and much more. "
As soon as Draco heard him , a thunderous look rose in his eyes . He stood up with a calm and resolute manner and turned to Harry.
Eithu ! Eithu ! Eithu ! Let mother magic punish these dirty and disgusting lecherous people ! No shame they have ! What will their ancestors say ?! What will their children learn from such shamless devils ?!
Harry's eyes followed the hand to meet a face with beauty so otherworldly that the one in front of him seemed more like a god than a mortal. Indeed, Draco is beautiful enough to start a war. And for the first time, Harry was thankful for Draco's prickly and overly scorching personality. If he had been even a bit softer, kinder, weaker, if Draco had been any more simpler, then people could have tainted his beauty with their lust and greed. They would have used any means to covet him, to break him. Harry was infinitely grateful that Draco was a Malfoy. He was thankful that Draco was a cunning Slytherin with cruelty enough that people only feel fear and respect when they see him and not lust or greed.
The voice spoke again, this time as if making fun of Harry, "Worry not, child. I do not come to harm you. But do tell me, is there nothing you need ?"
Getting out of his self inflicted hell , Harry looked at the four figures , two if wizards and two if witches, lying on the dirty floor, said , " Have all of you got your potions ?"
It felt like his company was unwanted and he was being pushed out . Draco had never felt like this , it was strangely awkward . He understood where he was unwelcomed but this was the first time he did not suspect this and literally got a blow in the gut . It was an embarrassingly painful feeling .
The elf swiftly raised his head looking at Draco with eyes wide with terror. Draco didn't meet his eyes , " How do you think you were able to spy on my father and me that night without getting caught ? Did you ever think that with you being in Hogward's and with Harry Potter would go unnoticed by me ? Why do you think you are still alive after betraying the Malfoy family despite being a Malfoy elf ? Why do you think that I never protested even after you were accidentally set free ? "
Harry watched as his blood slowly dipped in the empty lamp. The scarlet slowly raising along the wick. When the lamp was half full, Draco's magic silently came out to spot the bleeding and heal the bite.
" Upon your arrival in ministry , a wand was taken from you . Is this that wand ? " Umbridge said lifting a wand to display.
"AHHHHHHHHHH!", A childish shrill cry interrupted Harry and Draco as a slimy hand slapped Draco on his forearm.
Hearing these words Neville stilled. His mind was stumped for several moments before a look of indescribable anger rose on his face. And just like this the beautiful atmosphere was completely destroyed and Blaise literally threw a hammer on his own leg.
Afterall, talent and usefulness does not see age. A young student can be much more useful than a trained auror while an experienced minister can have a son with a brain worth thousands of his father's.
In the haze of tiredness and slumber, Draco heard a deep voice whisper to him, "...Wait~ ....Just wait~"
The words in his heart that he wanted to convey so much but didn't know how were restlessly blooming in his heart , melting in his blood , mixing with the air in his lungs at every exhale and eventually seeping into the body pressed against his.
A second passed and the one person still inside the desolated house disappeared as well, making it seem dark and haunted
how are you guys ? I hope everything is going fine in your life and if its not, the I hope that this chapter atleast gives you a bit of a smile. Everything is going fine for me. I am kinda under stress but i hope it will turn out all right in the future.
He had never seen this kind of jewellery before . Was it men's or was it women's ? Maybe it was a hair ribbon ?
Slughorn sat silent looking at Harry searching his face for something negative. Lowering his head again , he said ,"Please don't hate me ."
With her slender body trembling slightly, she lifted the wand towards  her most beloved people. The sorrow swirling in her blood seeped out of her glassy eyes, bitter but clean and pure tears flowed down her face.
As she heard this, awareness flooded her and Hermione tightly closed her eyes to gather her thoughts. When she opened them again, she had already regained her calm and said slowly, " I am fine. How did you get here ?"
How are your days?  I have been fine. The manor seems lonely without you. I hope you are healthy and eating well.
Amidst the flailing arms, Harry caught the sight of hot tears falling down burning angry eyes like the flashs of thunder. Silent tears fell down Draco's blazing and glassy red eyes as a sneer was forming on his lips.
Draco's hand moved to touch the gem on his magical portable ring and an egg appeared in his awaiting lap. His hand rested over it as he gently caressed the white surface. His gentle gestures evoked the illusion of a motherly warmth.
The professor looked at the Slytherin boy and suddenly laughed loudly, "Ahaha! Oh, I am sorry to damage your toy, Heir Zabini. I wasn't aware that you still haven't played enough. I didn't expect you to still bother after playing with your toy almost every night"
Picking up the deeply slumbering Draco, Harry made his way up to the gryffindor dormitories . The space was empty as all students were at the great hall for dinner.  Laying Malfoy in his bed , Harry carefully removed his robes and shoes . All the while his eyes never left the lush cherry lips.
Sitting on the couch to make themselves comfortable , Draco started to wrap the egg up with a blanket , thinking
Finally , Harry still did not touch Draco because it truly did feel inappropriate to touch Malfoy in such a way . Instead , if it had been Ron , Harry would not have thought twice. His eyebrows scrunched slightly with this thought which soon disappeared with the departure of a very grumpy Snape who didn't find anything , promoting them to continue their journey .
Harry looked at the silver head , something unpredictable swirling in his eyes . Slightly letting loose the grip on Draco's wrist .
The drops of sweat fell from Draco's bowed forehead travelling to his tightly closed eyes. The pain was unbearable, it was worse than before.
It just took a piece of her heart and a warmth encompassing her to straighten herself while still bearing the weight, willingly bearing the weight, to join her perfect melody and making it a little imperfect , intertwining them both to make an infinitely beautiful symphony .
Harry did not understand what had both Draco and Dumbledore so frightened . Horcruxes , was it ? All he thought after seeing the memory was how to find all the pieces and work on destroying them . The fact that Voldemort had Horcruxes was nothing more than a clue , a piece of inside information . But obviously , it meant much more and deeper for the silver haired young and elderly before him.
He turned the paper towards them to show the moving picture of a woman in pink clothes , pick hat and pink shoes , with a disgustingly sugary smile on her disgusting and ugly face .
After a long time and probably breaking a dozen Guinness World records, Harry let a wheezing Draco go.
Draco slumped back in his chair. When can he finally make sense of that idiot's word ? That man has been putting his brain in tangles since he was eleven and now, even more so .
But this realisation didn't diminish the guilt and regret.  Just like she was a little cruel to those who didn't matter to her, she also wasn't ungrateful to those who did help her.
Draco was still in the same position. Still in the bed with his head hung sideways but without tears. His eyes now held a deep resignation. If he suffered then he suffered. If he was raped then he was raped. If he died then he died. It did not matter anymore. He was only a shell now, just a hollow statue.
He paused as more tears fell and soon continued more softly "I feel so dirty. It feels nauseating everytime I imagine what others might think of me. I know it's not true but it still feels disgusting."
Another tap was felt but this time it was heard as well. The sound was small , tiny and incomparably weak but still there .
Neville raised his eyes somewhat petulantly but said nothing. Blaise looked down to the chubby face. The face had plum cheeks and doe eyes, both reddened because of the tears. The baby fat still visible on his face made him look even more pitiful and precious.
Her eyes glowed clever firmness, her shout ringing in Hermione's ears, "Isolate the surroundings with our strongest spells! Not even air should be able to pass out!"
The weather was freezing. Their feet walking cautiously on the slippery pavement beneath. The cottages on either side were alight with colourful decorations and the distant sound of Christmas Corals were floating in the air beside the delicate snowflakes. The atmosphere was warm and festive.
He just sat there, his body motionless other than the tremble in his round shoulders. Head bowed to hide those molten silver eyes.
He watched as Draco supplied his magic inside it . Some time passed as Draco , still in the same position with his palm on top of the egg , scrunched his eyebrows and pursed his lips tightly . By the looks of it , he was having quite a difficulty meaning they were about to gain some information .
Harry solemnly nodded, "Yes. Voldemort wanted something from this man. He was torturing him for it. But the man didn't have it and was murdered by voldemort."
He lifted his arms while cautiously taking the baby from Harry's brace and bringing her into his own.
Harry looked at both of them and again silently tucked the covers over the egg as well , before resting in his own bed to soundlessly drift in a shallow and aware sleep. He slept with one eye open . In such times, Who knows when the misfortune approaches ? He had people to look after and his beloved to protect. Tardiness wasn't something he could afford right now.
Harry's eyes widened before he swiftly reined in the surprise. His eyes turned more grim, more dark now.
Cold grey eyes meet mirth filled green ones , " Shut up , Potter. We purebloods are schooled in castration as well "
"Hmmm, you are an interesting child. Some guts you must have to call a Malfoy 'kitty' ! But, I have to say it quite suits Malfoys to be a bunch of kitties."
A pair of blue eyes, belonging to the tired face of a young woman, slowly closed as she drifted to the lands of dreams.
Harry found himself sitting in a small compartment . In further observation, he realised that it was The Hogward's Express . He lifted his head to see Ron and Hermione sitting in front of him . One asleep while the other reading . He was clear that this was an illusion , still he was about to call out to his friends when a familiar voice sounded .
A speculative silence spread and everyone thought seriously. But, no one could remember the name Gregorwitch being heard or read anywhere. After several minutes, Hermione, who remembered something as well, quickly got up to enter one of the tents.
Draco silently walked inside the next tent. Pansy and Theo were deep asleep. This day had considerably tired them out. They were more used to a war of words than a war of spells. Their physic was not as active as the gryffindors next door.
On the other end, Draco was going through books at the speed of light. Books piled beside him but he found nothing. Finishing another book, he got up to pull the next book from the shelf when he noticed the scribble on the shelf beneath the book. It looked old and almost faded and  hand written. The language was unknown, he noticed.  Just as he touched it, an array lit up right beneath his feet. Draco's eyes blew wide in fear.
With a flip, Harry settled Draco over his cock, spearing his entrance and said," Go on , Malfoy. Move. Rock your hips like the slut you are."
The following days went by slowly. Everyone acted as usual. The day came nearer and the fear in Draco's heart increased as well.
This man, The Golden Warrior as he said, is clearly very powerful. Harry already had an inkling of it when he silently read Harry's memories without him even suspecting anything. Struggling to calm his throbbing heart, Harry thought that agreeing to this old man is not detrimental in any sense. Even if he doesn't have the solution to Harry's problems, at least he will do no harm. Harry decisively made up his mind. But a smart man always cross-checks before giving a definite answer.
" Did you feel hungry ? But if I remembered clearly , Malfoy already gave you a big and healthy meal this morning, didn't he ?"
" The slave marks are embedded in your magic , removing them will feel like removing a parasite stuck on your skin . We have to cut away the chunk of magic it is stuck on , so that not even a bit of it remains within . And at that time your magic will start slipping away , it will bleed . Doing it with such a condition will kill you . " ; Voice still calm , Luar said .
Extending his hand towards Draco , Harry indicates him to get a steady hold . As soon as Draco intertwined his pale fingers with another's darker and larger ones , a shock ransacked his body . Before he even realised what was happening , he was already standing on the familiar place, the astronomy tower.
The moonlight filled the room as Draco slowly sat up from bed. Checking that his roommates were still deep asleep, he got out of bed. Silently draped his school robes over himself, took his wand and made his way out of the dormitory towards the library.
Kreacher looked down to clutch the locket in his hands . He looked up at Draco with newfound reverence .
Draco silently lifted his head from the bunch of vials in his lap and looked towards the direction Pansy was pointing.
But Harry , naturally knowing when to provoke and when to stay passive so as to tightly grip a sly and slippery minx, didn't reply. Instead he happily made his way to the reception downstairs to request packages of sandwiches and water bottles.
Harry's eyes widened and he smiled with a beautiful arc, trying to sooth his nerves ," We have to do it , Malfoy "
Harry got up as well, " Should we go to check ? Are you sure ? What if she didn't finish and just needed more time ?"
Draco stopped in front of the bright store, his breath panting from the short run. Years of excellent academics, perfect manners and noble upbringing gave him not only a deadly seductive poise like a cold flame, but also a body weaker than the rest of his age. Right now, It can be said that without magic, Draco had nothing other than his beauty and brain.
Draco was terrified , the gloomy emerald of Harry's eyes scared him. They were atrocious. He was scared stiff. And he remained so even after Harry pulled him up and silently dressed him in his uniform robes again.
Draco took the golden locket and his slim and jaded fingers moved to open the clasp. Kreacher's eyes grew wide and teary as Draco gently put the locket around the elf's neck.
The lift jerkily moved while throwing them here and there. After falling left and right and almost crushing their noses, the lift finally stopped on level 2.
Draco was shocked at first and then thankful . In a time like this , every comfort was a privilege . He could not physically feel the touch but he could feel a cool sensation , like a summer breeze brushing his skin . He understood that it was the man's magic . He could feel it comforting him as he was completely enveloped in it .
Harry blew an exasperated sigh, "And I have never been more glad to be in the position. It must have been Yaxley. He followed us through when we apparated"
Ron kept his mouth shut , refusing to heed. A sharp glint passed Harry's eyes and the force grinding him down increased.
Emerald eyes darkened further as Draco decisively looked away and Harry caught the sight of ears so red that they seemed to be dropping with blood.
Harry leaned back , eyes still on the unfriendly allies . Legs spread apart comfortably , his emotionless voice softly asked Draco ," I didn't think that Crabbe and Goyle wouldn't be invited "
Harry who had been watching the aristocratic pureblood coddle an egg like a real child could not help but chuckle . And his chuckle turned into a laugh when the same aristocrat turned to glare at him and somehow held the egg like he wasn't holding an egg but a pregnant tummy . In all of this he did not miss the bright red Labrinth of his ears hiding behind silver hair . It pleased him greatly to see such a different Malfoy .
They didn't even realise when the baby who was the size of their forearm had grown and become a responsible young woman . The years went by so fast and now their small flower was in full bloom, beautiful and vibrant, spreading her sweet fragrance everywhere.
The light at the end of the hallway was coming from a room , the courtroom. From where they were , they could see a woman sitting in a chair , anxiously looking somewhere before her.
Was this her child ? How could  there be a child inside this egg ? Draco first thought that it was a creature's egg but did not expect it was the veela's . He knew that veela's gave birth and were not oviparous . Maybe it was adopted .
, as they like to call themselves, make their way to their first class. With Blaise on his left and Pansy on his right,  Draco walked the corridor as if it was a ramp. His lithe body moving like how a leopard had its leisure walks.
" Fine" ; Harry replied in a relaxed yet steady tone. Getting up, he gave both of them approving looks and made his way out .
" And I don't know that . You could be lying" the wand in Blaise's hand twirled around his fingers as he leisurely walked closer.
" That's the real difficulty. Most of them are found in the magical grassland of England and are widely sold but one particular herb is found in the snow forests of Scottish Taiga. It's very hard to find and not sold due to the dangerous nature of the forest. "
Pansy doubtfully looked at the old and withered house elf , saying, " Maybe he knows where the real locket is "
At this point , Harry had terrified the whole gryffindor table and some students in his proximity even had cold sweat dripping down their back . Sitting beside him , Ron had a HD+ and ultra definition view of the horror scene . It was a miracle he did not start crying like Neville four seats ahead .
And Draco fell. His soul aching with withering pain. He could hear Ginny's laugh ringing in the background with Harry's " Malfoy !" . Somewhere he could even hear the clinking of his own chains.
" Don't worry about it. You won't have to do anything. Just be as you always are and act as you always do "
Taking the egg with him , he silently slipped out . Once out of the room , he put the egg in his ring storage and made a run for the dormitories . Reaching his bed he slipped inside the drapes to pull them down and cast spells to keep them so .
Draco saw the self satisfied smirk on Harry and finally felt  a very bad premonition in his heart. It felt as if he was slowly, unknowingly leered into a trap to be eaten whole. It was better to keep his distance from Harry. He's not as simple as before. Draco's instincts were on full edge and more so was his magic. Everything in his body was telling him to run. So, he grabbed a confused Blaise and dazed Pansy and walked as fast and as calmly as was required for a pureblood young master while dragging his dumb struck friends with both hands. But He could feel the gaze all the way through.
Other death eaters rudely paraded inside the train, moving from one compartment to another, scanning all the faces of children and teenagers.
Huh. Fear ….but for what ? Questions swirled in Draco's head. Kreacher's reaction was a bit odd. As if he was scared but sorrowful at the same time . But , in all of this one thing was clear . Kreacher was hiding something. Something that involved his mother.
Harry silently made his way to the infirmary. With the invisibility cloak sneaking out was as easy as breathing.
Soft hiccups and panting breaths were the only indication of his turmoil and agony midst of this luxury provided to him. He was adorned by red robes and tended with the most expensive oils and scented soaps. But midst these, there shined a stunning gold on his body , gold binding his wrists and ankles. These gold cuffs which were embedded with rubies and emeralds and craves with charms were a constant reminder. A reminder that he did not belong to himself anymore . That he was nothing more than a property, a medal decorating another.
Green eyes gazed into cold and seething silver ones . Harry's voice dropped an octave , becoming a dark lure , an enchanting seduction, " Like what ?"
A dark, slightly hunched figure stood some steps behind Draco. By the looks, it was an old lady. A fleeting memory flashed in Harry's head.
The letters entailed about the situation and observations everyone has made. Accordingly, Pansy and Theo are already out and on their way, it seems. While the other two need some more time to sort things up. They might probably be on their way already.
Harry did not stop even after that, he kept going, kept chasing his own release. He felt his manhood pulse and soon he was biting a pink bud on Draco's chest and cumming in him. The sweet taste of blood was swimming on his tongue.
They walked some distance but there was still no sight of Pansy. The trees around them grew sparse as they were originally deep inside the forest.
" Go on ,Draco . Do it . NOW !" The lure now turned into a threat and the pale shivering hand of a helpless boy tightened around his wand.
" Why did you become a death Eater  ?" This was the question that had been up in Harry's head for a long time , it had been there like a poison , slowly flowing through his blood , spreading across his body , as it maddened him more and more everyday .
Draco looked at Harry, his eyes lit with joy, he called, "P-Potter, Look. It's eggie. It's our eggie."
Harry looked at Malfoy , silently assessing his views and alertness . His eyes flashed a surprised gleam , thinking,
" See .. there were really no rooms . And what is such a big deal if I slept with you ? We are both men, aren't we?" Harry said with a very convincing tone, turning and twisting the entire ordeal.
" The same way you came in . You will be transported through one of my arrays . But I advise you not to do so . The reasons the array harmed you so much that you fainted was because of the instability of your body which further aided the instability of the array and ultimately got distorted ."
Harry ,who was at the forefront , pointed his wand as well, his magic sweeping through the air to corner whoever was there. And Harry clearly felt his magic sense the presence of three wizards.
Standing in front of the door , he gripped the knob . Just as he was about to open the door , a hand gripped his wrist . He turned and saw his mother , tearfully looking at him .
During this period, Harry was in constant contact with all the six people in their circle and things were going according to his plan.
Harry slid the heavy bag on his shoulders to drop it on the wooden table. When he came up after paying for their rented room and dinner, Draco was already shallowly asleep on one of the twin beds in the hotel room. He had been tired and exhausted tonight. The travel from one end of the city to another on foot and the additional burden on their shoulders had been too much for him. While Harry wasn't that tired due to grace from the physical training he got from Oldman Eloise for the past few months.
Draco lowered to his knees before Harry, his eyes were spitting fire and his mouth set in a sneer. Harry lovingly watched as Draco roughly lifted his face . His hands were rough but his magic brushing over Harry's nose was so gentle. His hand slowly covered his bloodied nose as he closed his eyes. A crunch sounded as Harry's nose snapped back into place and his bleeding stopped as well , the wound completely healed and as good as new.
Hearing the door shut, Draco lay there unmoving, still and lifeless. His eyes held no light, no emotions, no pain, no misery. There was nothing. But still the tears did not stop flowing. His whole body had resigned but his heart did not, a small corner of his shattered heart still hoped. For what ? Even Draco did not know. Sometimes he thought that it was another glance , or a small smile, a lingering touch, or maybe a barely gentle caress.
" AHH !", Neville shouted in agony and entirely curled up in himself. His body bonelessly slumping on the seat as he lost consciousness.
Turning around, she started making her way back to the camp. Walking some distance, suddenly her chest tightened.
The bus ride was fairly long. Their current location being at one end of London and Islington being at the opposite, it took more than 4-5 hours to reach there. Meanwhile , Draco promptly told Harry to get out the sandwiches at the time of lunch. They silently ate their meal of three egg sandwiches each before Draco decided to take a nap in the remaining time.
The still afloat elf flexed his thin and wrinkled arms, trying to break free before admitting defeat and saying, " Kreacher…..has been watching "
Draco silently consented with a nod but still remained cold. This house elf has never liked or respected him , Draco knew this. He knew that Dobby was never , even once , loyal to him. This made his curiosity bloom even more as to why Dobby was standing before him instead of running away.
It was then that the door suddenly flew open with a thud. And in came a very chaotic Ginny Weasley. Her hairs were tangled and messed up, her clothes askew and her wide eyes held a psychotic gleam. Then she smiled forming a wide arc showing all her teeth. Her messy lipstick shined with all its glamour but made her look more like a madman than a beautiful lady.
She took another sniff as if a starving beast. The scent was as addictive as it was sweet. Only one breath wasn't enough.
Some dozen steps after, Harry caught the sight of a ruined wooden cottage. From its ruins, it can be said to be destroyed by a fire. But Harry, who is a wizard, clearly understood that it was magic rather than fire that destroyed it. In a daze, Harry didn't notice when his own steps stopped in front of the ruined cottage.
All five hands were raised in a second . While Ron still remained motionless. Harry saw but chose to remain silent. With a sigh , Draco spoke , albeit softly , "Weasley , Do you agree ? "
Soon a pair of very drunk men were singing heartbreak songs . Harry was lazily resting in the background enjoying the skit.
Draco gently lowered the baby into the tub while holding her head above the water and caressingly washing the filth on her body. Soon the baby was clean and warmly bundled up in the soft swaddle cloth.
Looking up, the sight of Draco sitting on top of him while leaning down all the while screaming profanities was so much of a stimulation that Harry barely registered what his words meant.
With this extremely pleasant thought, the sharp edge in Harry's eyes disappeared like a cloud in clear blue sky.
By the look Kreacher was giving him , his plan had worked and succeeded. To seal the effect in stone , he gave the elf a small comforting smile as well.
This was his revenge, revenge for defying his words. With tears still in his eyes, Draco uttered the first words in months, "Please, No. Not this"
When Draco came back to Harry again, he clearly was very tired but still sat down beside him to repeatedly check and renew the surrounding barriers.
" Go ahead. I am a respectable man. How can I lie to you ?!" A disbelieving and wronged expression on his handsome face. But Draco didn't even spare him a glance.
Ron's voice raised even higher, " No ! No , you weren't ! You were supposed to stay home and protect mom and Ginny !"
Harry stared at the Draco. His eyes were blank and his thoughts had the picture of Draco crying before he made his appearance. He stumbled back with a jolt as his body was pushed backwards and Snape ran to Draco. His eyes panicked before changing to anger as he looked at Harry, scornfully saying, " Have you done enough damage? If so, please leave, Mr. Potter, and return to your dormitory." The words were spat out by Snape as his whole being exuded furious anger. He would have hexed Harry if not for the barely breathing Draco.
Smirking slightly , Harry slowly dropped one of his hands down as he watched Malfoy's eyes warily following it . Slowly closing it just beside Draco's waist , he smirked as Draco looked up to give him a burning glare before returning his eyes on the hand .
Slughorn jumped with a startled shout before looking behind to spot Harry with an unconscious Draco .
The snake was immediately uncoiled from Harry's body. He swiftly took this chance to escape and shouted, "Stop ! Quickly come behind me !"
Why doesn't anyone look at him?! She worked so hard to come out to them and they won't even hug her?! No! This won't do!
Harry uttered ….no. He commanded. And Kreacher was reminded of his master Regulus . For once , a new hope rose in Kreacher's heart. Hope of salvation and of better future. Hope that he will finally be able to complete his master's last order. Hope that he will be able finally return to his master what he once owed him. Hope that his master's sacrifice won't be in vain. With a last look at the youthful face of his new master , Kreacher closed his eyes and disappeared.
Blaise knew that this wasn't much of a protection, but this was the only thing he could do to protect a reckless and ridiculous gryffindor desperately hated by the dark side. This was the only way which allowed him to keep Neville by his side and subsequently not alert the death eaters in Hogward's.
Seeing Draco stop and hesitate to touch him, Harry felt a twinge of disappointment and aggreivation. He said somewhat urgently, "Why did you stop ?!"
Draco sat up as he endearingly looked at them, wordlessly wondering about the missing member between them. He was terribly worried about Blaise, but his trust in Blaise and his abilities was far more than pointless worry.
Pansy cautiously rose from the forest floor and let out a relieved sigh. She quickly and efficiently ticked the leaves scattered around on the piece of ground she just used.
And with that, he didn't even wait for a reply and ran back. Harry shouted behind him but was ruthlessly ignored. Seeing that it was useless, Harry gave a worried look at the slender back but still made his way to the graveyard according to Draco's words.
The witch slowly nodded. Her blank eyes staring at Harry, not moving an inch or even blinking, as if lifeless.
With his eyes not moving even an inch, Harry , not wanting to disturb Draco's sleep, asked softly, " How has he been ?"
Draco had finally lost it . He knew that Potter was stronger than him , knew that he could not afford to offend him , but it did nothing to stop him. Draco could keep his cool even in the face of death but could not do it in front of Potter , could do nothing to stop himself . If Potter was a bright spark than Draco was a lush forest . Just a touch was enough to destroy his every barrier , every resolution . It was enough to burn him down to dust and he could do nothing to stop it , because it wasn't the spark that fuels the fire but the forest itself .
Kreacher's eyes glazed over as he reminisced the memory like a haunted dream , " He came...i~n the night….he took...many things... including the locket "
A hand, as graceful and as fair as snow, slowly brushed away specks of white stuck on his lashes. The hand was so delicate and white that for a second, Harry thought that it was made of the moonlight itself.
His hand lay on Malfoy's throat as he gently curled his fingers over it to cover the delicately translucent skin .
Last summer he searched through the whole library in Malfoy mansion, wanting to know anything and everything that could help. The pro was that everyone thought that he was doing it to spend the summer away and no one suspected anything. Con was that it took too much time.
