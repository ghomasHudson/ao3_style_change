“Oh shut up Pans...” Draco looked up from his phone and over to where Harry was sitting with Neville and Hermione. Harry was laughing. Probably at one of Neville’s stupid jokes. Their eyes met, and Draco’s smile grew even wider. Merlin, what was happening to him?
pansy: you guys do know that by walking in there with us you are like officially publicly announcing that ur guys are associated with us right?
“M’lady?” Seamus said dramatically as he gestured his arm towards her. She laughed and took his arm.
"He has feelings. Surprising." Harry glared at him, and Remus gave him a small smile. Sirius was sitting in a chair at the small table which had their meal on it.
“Yeah. My father. He, well, he makes my life a living hell.” Draco stopped and looked down at Harry. “I mean, I shouldn’t even be complaining. At least I have parents.” Harry raised his eyebrows at that.
“Yeah that works. Right, babe?” He looked over to Draco who nodded, and returned to his book. “Whatcha’ reading?” He scooted closer to Draco and laid his head on his shoulder. Ron gagged at this. Harry flipped him the bird.
“I-“ She started, but before she could finish owls came swooping in to the Great Hall. The pleasant atmosphere started to fade quickly.
“Oh darling....” Draco started towards Harry, but Harry held his hand up and Draco stopped in his tracks.
“Everything alright, love?” Harry nodded his head towards two figures that were making their way towards them. When Draco realized who the two figures were, he laughed, said he was going to talk to Blaise, and walked away. What a bitch.
“Okay, so I brought my makeup, but I don’t really know if it’s any of your guys’ speed.” Pansy dumped her makeup bag out onto the bathroom counter. Contents of mostly black makeup fell with a small clatter. Hermione cringed a bit, and walked out into their dorm. When she returned, she had a small soft pink bag.
hey guys! sorry for not updating. i’m on vacation, but i’m heading home in 2 days. posting should be back to normal then!!! love you all <3
“Oh, um, this? It’s a Sneezewort. They’re quite beautiful aren’t they?” He turned to Blaise who shook his head in agreement. “They’re poisonous to certain animals, and such. Sometimes they’re used in potion making, but they’re most known for their leaves.” Neville was getting progressively more exited as he explained. “They can be used as a bug repellent! It’s quite amazing that just one plant can have so many different purposes.” He looked up to Blaise as he finished. “Sorry. That was lame.” He looked down at his feet. God he has just ruined the whole date hadn’t he? Why did he have to be such a nerd.
“I guess that is kinda odd.” He kisses Draco and then pulled back. “But we don’t hate each other. Right?” He finished. Draco gave him an amused look.
harry: and draco’s my boyfriend, mind you i don’t know exactly what regulus did, but i’m sure it’s not too far off from draco’s situation
harry: i don’t even know what me and draco, like, are okay? we literally kissed for the first time yesterday on the train so
“Uh, nothing important.” Neville said as he put his phone down on the table, and joined into the conversation that was happening between Blaise, Dean, and Seamus.
“Neville! Are you even listening?” Ginny asked him. Neville put his phone down and looked up at Ginny.
“Well if it isn’t the dirty traitor.” Lucius eyed Sirius up and down. Remus had previously come up to Harry and rested a hand onto his shoulder. Lucius’ eyes traveled to him now. “And his half-breed pity project.” Sirius let out a noise that sounded somewhat like a growl, but Remus just smiled warmly at Lucius.
“Uh, sorry.” Blaise said as a blush grew on his face. Neville giggled bit and Blaise’s stomach did a flip. “What’s that?” Blaise motioned to the plant that Neville was just looking at. Neville’s eyes widened.
“Let them.” Harry whispered back. A small smile grew on Draco’s face. Soon, the dining hall returned back to normal. A few other students moved. Mostly siblings.
“We won’t. I don’t know about you guys, but I still wanna go.” She looks over to her side. “Blaise?”
“No, but-“ Neville grunted as he threw his trunk back up above them. “I have proof.” He held up a book, turned to a page, handed it to Blaise, and pointed at a paragraph. “Read that.” Blaise looked at him and then sighed and cleared his throat.
“Yeah. We should probably head back. We have class tomorrow.” Draco started to stand, and Harry followed.
“Good. Good. Okay, well, you can head to your next class now. I’ll let Sirius know that you were with me.” Harry nodded and started to his next class.
“Look at me.” Draco took Harry’s face in his hands and tilted his head up. “It’s over. We both said things that we didn’t mean, but we know now that Nott is just a jealous dick. Okay? I love you. So so much.” He sent Harry a soft that was shortly returned. Harry nodded his head and leaned back into Draco.
ginny: no luna of course you're not right this is neville we're talking about he'd never date a slytherin, when i said he liked him before i was obviously joking
remus: what reason would he have the fact that he’s dating someone? he knows that we’re okay with it
“Me then.” He reached for the red envelope and hesitated at the Zabini Family wax seal. Neville put a reassuring hand onto his back which he practically melted into. Okay. He could do this. He ripped open the wax seal and-
“And why should I believe you? It looked perfectly real to me, and your track record isn’t exactly helping the situation.” Harry spat at him. Merlin, why couldn’t he just be good at things like this. It would be so easy to just believe Draco, so why didn’t he. Draco looked taken aback.
“Look,” He started with a quieter voice this time. “I’m not breaking up with him. So you can either accept that, or figure out something else.” Then Harry walked out of the office and didn’t look back. He left a shaken pair of uncles behind him.
draco: why? like i got that maybe you liked hanging out with me but why would you want other people to know it could ruin you everyone hates me ur friends would hate you
harry: so um, nott edited it. it was literally a picture of draco and i at first and he photoshopped a random guy where i was.
“Exactly.” He continued. “We have people that care about us now. That’s all that matters.” He took a deep breath and steadied himself. “So, why would we let our parents ruin our holiday plans?” Pansy stood up and brushed he skirt off
“Are you alright?” Ginny asks, blunt as ever, cutting immediately to the chase. “Do you need medicine?”
‘Never thought to tell you,’ Harry shrugs. ‘Old Black property. Only time I went there was when I was looking through all the property left to me in my inheritance and trying to weed out all the dark curses and jinxes.’
“Wait,” Potter says, his sandpaper-rough voice doing things to Draco he’d rather not think too deeply about.
He doesn’t turn over, but he can imagine it, Potter silhouetted in the doorway, moonlight glinting off his spectacles, face contorted in an angry scowl, words berating Draco for his cowardice ready on his lips.
He reaches out and pulls Harry into his arms, until his back is a long line of smoothness against Draco’s chest. Under his touch, Harry is vibrating with tension. When Draco presses a soft kiss to his shoulder-blade, it eases somewhat but he’s still too highly strung for Draco’s comfort.
He shoots Ginevra a smile and wonders if she can tell that he’s thinking about her husband, of loving him, of kissing him, of being inside him. If she can, she doesn’t show it, looking as cheery as ever with her lot in life.
“Can I please sit down somewhere?” Potter asks Draco, an edge of frustration creeping into his voice.
Malfoy clears his throat. “Draco then,” he says and Harry is surprised by the ease with which his brain ceases to think of the man before him as
His throat clenches. Sunday roasts remind him of all the visions his brain conjures of Harry on the weekends, in Ginevra’s arms, lifting the Weasley brats onto his broad shoulders, playing Quidditch with Teddy Lupin and drinking beer with Ronald and George. It’s only fitting that Ginevra is responsible for cooking them now– there’s a metaphor there somewhere that Draco is both too tired to look for and too afraid to find.
He’s on his way towards Scrivenshaft’s when Ginny Weasley accosts him on the sidewalk of Diagon Alley. She’s smiling, warm and pleasant with no resentful undercurrents when she wishes him a good day and asks how he’s been doing like they’re old acquaintances. He blinks, taking in her cheery countenance and her hand on his arm and wonders how it is possible for someone to be so distinctly impossible to hate.
When they all sit down and dig in, Malfoy remarks, “Now this is all very nice and awkward, isn’t it? Granger, next time you invite me to dinner, do remind me of this evening, won’t you?”
“I agree,” Hermione says, sounding frustrated, “but we do have to first have a plan of the whole thing before we get down to the details. We can’t simply set everything in stone now, it has to be flexible.”
The Wizarding World rioted. The papers published article after article, some claiming Draco was still keeping his Death Eater alliances active, some claiming Harry Potter was losing the plot. Some went wild, theorising Harry and Draco were working together to resurrect Voldemort and had pulled this stunt to draw suspicion away from the reality by broadcasting it to the public.
“I’m not sure what they are,” Hermione admits. “I layered them on so thick that I don’t really know what their brains look like. Their thoughts, their life before they went there. But I—I don’t think I can breathe easy until I at least try.”
Kingsley’s eyes soften. It’s the most he’s given Draco up until now. His words, if possible, are kinder still. “Travel,” Kingsley says. “Get out of here and see the world for what it is outside your mansion and your father’s friends and their beliefs. Take this sentence as an opportunity. You have the money, Draco. You have the time. Don’t squander it on meaningless pursuits.”
He’s not traditionally attractive. He’s a little too sharp, his nose is too long, his lips are a cruel slash across his mouth when he curls them in. But he blossoms in the right settings. When firelight plays over his features, softening them down. When the sunlight of the Curtained Room filters in through the curtains to strike his grey irises.
He hates that he knows this. Hates that he has watched Potter enough to know his emotions from the sound of his footsteps. Hates that he can recall the weight of Potter’s rage tightened figure pushing and sliding against the muscles of his back.
‘I love you,’ he murmurs against the soft skin, the feelings rushing through him almost overwhelming.
” Immediately, the world descends into silence, the call of crickets and traffic outside drowned out by the bonds of magic.
“Since May, he’s been that way. A perfect nightmare, honestly. He barely talks and when he does its usually monosyllabic words. He hasn’t written to the Weasleys in months and he writes to Ron but its barely a sentence and I can tell Ron is getting more worried than he should be.”
“Are we dating?” Harry asks at the diner, sandwich halfway to his mouth. Draco pauses, straw heavy on his tongue as he sips at the Coke Harry had insisted on buying. He doesn’t really know how to answer.
He turns his head, and Harry is still sitting on the armchair, watching the two of them with unreadable eyes. “Come here,” Scorpius admonishes. “You’re too far away.”
Anyone with half a brain is quite capable of understanding exactly why they should never meet in private. Or in public. Or anywhere.
Uncertain and wary, he stares at the cup, wondering what Harry is up to. If it is a gesture of reconciliation, it is too little, too late. If it is a reminder of Harry’s presence in his life, it is unnecessary.
Draco wordlessly moves further into the house, feet automatically avoiding the living room and moving further in till they reach the kitchen. Potter takes in his surroundings and says, “I don’t see chairs, Malfoy.”
When Draco speaks, his voice is raspy. ‘I do think it might have missed something.’ He runs a hand up the side of Harry’s bare arm and asks in a low undertone, ‘Do you think you might still be… interested?’
“There’s one about the Gryffindor Boys Dormitory Orgy. I don’t think the details people seem to know are quite right,” Potter shrugs.
But Harry’s friends– once he started getting to know them beyond the insufferable Gryffindor exteriors– are genuinely pleasant people.
When the handle starts digging into his back, Harry pulls away, flustered and a little dazed. They enter, and Harry is glad he didn’t leave his underwear on the floor before leaving today morning. His bed is a little untidy but he doubts Draco cares when he’s pressed up once again against the wall.
Before he touches it, he draws his wand to check for underlying hexes meant to set off on intruders, sure that at least a couple nasty ones are lying in wait for him. He remembers an exclusive in the Daily Prophet on Voldemort’s Headquarters, details about the Manor that had apparently fascinated the people, something about the gates contorting into a face that asked questions, about select people being able to pass through the wrought iron gates like they were smoke. When none of that happens, Harry cautiously casts a Detection Charm on the gates. But when he swipes the wand through the air, only a red shower of sparks erupt and die away.
Everyone in the Hall shoots curious glances at the table, and anytime Granger catches anyone staring, she quells them with a single, potent glare that she might as well have perfected by watching Severus. Draco finds himself at the receiving end of one and looks away quickly.
There are innumerable others from other Death Eaters, some taking out their frustration while others did a victory run on his skin. Some parts of his flesh have no scars, no marks but they are more tender than they should be. There’s Crucio Curse damage but that’s minor in comparison to what others have suffered. Just some trembling when he uses his right hand too extensively.
For once, there is no war, there is no Dark Mark, there is no angry, house-arrested mother or the ghost of the dead lingering. For once, Draco is just Draco, staring up at a sky as divine as a blessing, mind free of weighted guilt, lying beside the boy he fancies in the backyard of his fancy villa.
“Oh—er. Yes, yes of course,” he stutters, trying to coalesce his winding thoughts into spoken English. He sounds a little stupid but figures Malfoy is accustomed to it. Probably expects it. He doesn’t feel quite as unbalanced when he mentally adjusts to the status quo.
He does, until his brain quiets completely, the sounds and screams fading away to nothing, the spasms and tremors of his body leaving him with nothing but painful cramps that Harry knows will go away soon enough.
When Draco blasts through the wards, Scorpius has a front row seat to the maniacal panic in his eyes, his survey of the surroundings, the warm crackle of his magic.
After an inordinate amount of time has passed, Harry starts feeling uneasy. It has been half an hour, maybe more and a nagging thought at the back of his mind makes him get up and unlock the door with magic.
With a flick of his wand, Harry Vanishes the mess. “I’ll buy everything again after we’ve had the drink,” Harry promises Malfoy, who has begun to look apologetic and unfamiliar again. “It’ll hold us to sobriety. And,” he adds, because he doesn’t trust Malfoy’s proclivities to throw money around to not resurge, “I still don’t expect you to pay for that mess.”
He doesn’t know where the words come from. He doesn’t know why he says them. He only knows that she doesn’t deserve this, doesn’t deserve what he’s done, what he’s helped Harry to do to her.
He wants to laugh. If he could breathe, wouldn’t he? Would he be sitting here, staring at crumbling plaster, letting himself die if he could breathe? He can’t breathe, he can’t breathe—
Then he starts moving– deep and gentle thrusts at first that have Draco moaning steadily into Harry mouth and then moving onto sharper, shallower movements that have him screaming into Harry’s neck, tears streaming down his face.
“Firstly, you continue to refuse to meet your family for the last four months or so. That in itself warrants some sort of concern on everyone’s part. When Hermione approached you about it, you were closed off and rude to her. Which tells me there’s something you’re not telling us about your reasons to not meet the Weasleys which doesn’t involve Fred or Mrs. Weasley which are the reasons you gave in the past. When she saw they would go without you, you completely lost control which is related to something she said six or so weeks ago in the heat of an argument and ripped apart your living room with accidental magic. And that leads us to a whole depth of problems which if I try to explain right now, we will be here all night. You were so triggered, you went back into the past, to memories of abandonment from your friends and used it against them. You triggered both Hermione and Ron into extreme forms of panic and PTSD and demolished practically the entirety of your room, physically hurting Ron in the process. You had to be restrained magically to stop yourself from causing more harm to your surroundings and that is saying something given how much damage was already caused. Now, Harry, tell me which part of that seems to not require help to you?”
was gonna pay for lunch, the bloody prat," mumbled the blonde. He growled low in his throat then turned to Travis with an appraising glare.
"It's okay, Harry." He grabs his husband's hand and pulls them towards the lift so they can have a bit of privacy in one of their offices, though he almost hexes three witches on the way up for ogling them so obviously. Harry's office is closer, so that's where they go, eyes following them the entire way.
Malfoy manor hadn't changed much since the war, it was still beautiful in that dark and mysterious way, but since Draco had taken it over it held a lot more items he used to be sure would make a pureblood blush.
draco: i cant possibly fit two weeks of clothes in here, including my dress suits for dinner, it’s not possible
“No! No. It’s actually pretty cool. I mean, how you remember all this stuff.” He gestured to the plants. “I cant even reminder half of the shit we learn in class.” Neville’s eyes lit up.
“Just, everything he says is bullshit. Alright?” Blaise spoke up. Everyone else at the table had been uncharacteristically quiet. They had never really heard the Slytherins howlers before. They had always been opened in the safety of their dorm room.
"Reservation for Potter," he says with a smile on his face, grabbing Draco's hand as the hostess walks them to a table.
"I assure you, I have nothing to do with this." Though Draco is grinning as he responds, "You will find I'm a very likable person, of my own accord."
"Actually, Travis," he said as if he had gotten a brilliant idea, "Join Potter and I for lunch, will you. There's a few things we should discuss."
"I didn't...er— mean to uh...in-insinuate-" Travis starts to stutter out before Harry takes another step forward, his scars glowing terrifyingly pale against his warm brown skin.
"So, we're telling people now?" he asked with a tired sort of look that told them he already expected disagreement.
"I'm sure she'll survive just fine," Draco responds, pointing a finger to where she's dancing very intimately on Justin Finch-Fletchly.
"Merlin's sake," Draco says softly, practically in awe. They've been married for years, but that soft uncomfortable look in Harry's eyes when he thinks he's unwanted is still there. A part of Draco knows it will always be there, but he grips both of his husband's hands in his. "Harry, I love you, never doubt that; I'd scream it from the rooftops if I didn't think I'd look like a wild veela."
"Oh, I would," says Travis, placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. "He's one of the nicest men in the ministry, but he isn't a pushover either. All of the junior CB's love him."
Harry let his head fall forward in a mix of tiredness and shame before he heard the door close with a soft click and he felt the locking charm and the wards shift as Draco left the manor.
"Poor little Potter, cursed with a beautifully huge cock. How wretched." Draco slowly reached his hand up and gripped Harry's thick length and at the man's hiss he wasted no time before he leaned forward and placed a kiss to the tip of his boyfriend's dick.
His first thought was to say obviously, sod off, but what actually said was something more like "Er...yeah."
"Actually," says Travis, "Draco told me he didn't like tea. But isn't it just so nice of him to accept it anyway?"
"You have me as long as you want me, love," Harry says, sitting on the corner of his desk and nudging Draco's knee with the tip of his shoe. "Glued to you like a sticking charm. Scout's honor."
In what seemed like nano-seconds, the paler boy had used his wand to remove the rest of his clothes then he layed face down lifting his ass in a way that had the darker man almost coming on sight.
do anything, you bloody Gryffindor. I want to be with you because I like you. Why is that so hard for you to
The war had ended differently than anyone expected. Mudbloods and Halfbloods and the like weren't killed, merely subjugated to those with '
Draco wonders if this is how Harry always feels when he takes care of him. Proud not pitiful. Harry catches his eye from across the yard and smiles with a wave. His mother looks over and raises her champagne flute and he smiles as he lifts a hand in acknowledgement to both of them.
"Does she know you're seeing someone?" Harry is trying not to be angry because Pansy Parkinson is a slag who throws herself at anyone and she's been liking Draco for ages.
"You'll like it, I promise!" he called back with an easy grin as his black hair blew in the wind making it an even bigger mess than it usually was.
Everything was different now. There were certain things that were expected of certain kinds of people. If the Dark Lord was to be believed, this would never change again.
Draco notices it in the way other people in the ministry are looking at him with narrowed eyes as he walks into work the next morning. His ring isn't glamoured today, hasn't been since he and Harry promised to tell everyone, but now he sees the witches and wizards who are openly ogling it. He wants to wave it around in their faces. Shove their love in these bystanders faces. Instead Draco smirks in a way he knows used to drive Harry absolutely barmy when they first got together and he wanted to act like he knew more than he actually did.
"I panicked, okay! I was trying to tell 'Mione that I already had a date and Ginny asked who she was and then Ron kept asking about her and-"
"Of course, because that's way worse than the entire school thinking your boyfriend is with someone else," Draco rebuffs angrily.
"Of course I'll help plan it! Should I call Luna, Rolf and Ginny to help?" she said conjuring an extra sheet of parchment from the desk in front of her and holding her self inking quill onto the page waiting for instruction, some of the ink bleeding onto her ring covered fingers.
"Er- hey, Travis," he tried politely. They could try being friends now, right? Draco didn't have many work friends. Everyone thought he was a bit scary. "Is Malfoy busy or something?"
"I think you forgot who blew the fuse back at the Ministry. More than one fuse, really, if you ask the archival witches."
"So, we're doing the attack first thing today? Great," Harry said sarcastically."Do you need me to contribute this time or are you fine just berating me from the passenger seat?"
"Just- forget I said anything." Harry turned away annoyed and lifted his hand to knock on the door, but no one answered. He tried again to no avail. He rolled his eyes before just opening his husband's office door to find the blond face down on a stack of papers, snoozing softly. "Wanker," the ravenette said fondly before shaking Draco's shoulder gently. The blond blinked open his eyes slowly then grinned up at Harry.
He's running down the corridor seconds later and Harry takes a deep breath to calm his magic before walking the rest of the way to his husband's office. Once he's there the man in question is leaning against the door jamb, smiling at him.
"Alright, well, can I talk to you for a mo' then?" Harry asked politely and the younger man froze before agreeing.
"Then we'll get through it together. Draco, when you were going through the trials, even with my testimony, you were alone. Pansy was gone and Blaise was in training and your mother was dealing with her own shit. You're not alone anymore. You haven't been for years. And if I have anything to say about it, you won't be ever again." Harry shrugs. "What the bloody fuck does the Prophet know anyway?"
"Prat," he said before finally walking out and closing the doors behind him. It took him the entire hour before lunch and his walk back to his husband's office to realize they had somewhat come out about their marriage to Travis and he laughed so hard at his own obliviousness that he almost cried and had to apologize to Melinda Zokran who worked in one of cubicles near Draco's office, but he still felt giddy as he waited in his husband's office for the man to return from a meeting.
"So what have I missed," asked the newcomer, placing a hand on Draco's. It wasn't long before a wandless stinging hex was sent his way. He snatched his hand away and Draco only smiled small and shrugged at him. Luckily that was enough and he chuckled before striking up a conversation about work.
Ron nods with him before shrugging looking back at Hermione. "Charlie likes blokes, but he doesn't really date, ya know, he's not interested in anything but dragons. Kind of glad I never took you up on your offer to study with you now, though."
"I just condition it well. No secrets there," Draco Malfoy said in his usual drawl, but Harry knew he was relishing the attention and couldn't help grinding his teeth. Of course Draco enjoyed being complimented by younger guys it proved he was still fresh and gorgeous and marketable and he always thought Harry was being too kind. They were both in their thirties and Harry knew they were both too tired nowadays for a proper shag and that was probably why he was so on edge, but he was still gripping his mug so tightly that he was getting a cramp in his hand. His eyes were staring unfocused at the wooden table in the pub that he and his friends met at every week. There was a notch just below his glass where Ginny had almost stabbed Ron over a bet.
“You okay?” Draco asked him as he slid his arm around his waist. Harry nodded and gulped down the remainder of his pumpkin juice.
draco: do you ever wonder why i took care of luna when she was trapped in the dungeons at malfoy manner?
“For the love of Merlin, can we not just get some pumpkin juice?” Ginny sighed. “This is ridiculous they’re all staring like The Dark Lord has just returned.” Harry reached over her shoulder and grabbed her cup from her.
“C’mere.” He opened arms in invitation. Draco sighed, but nonetheless climbed into the bed anyways. They had all agreed to retire to bed early. It had been a long day, especially for their Slytherin friends. Draco couldn’t help but think that maybe, just maybe, he was finally being accepted by Sirius Black. Actually accepted by him. The thought made him smile as he fell asleep in his boyfriends arms.
“Can I kiss you?” Blaise’s eyes widened, and Neville started to panic, but soon Blaise nodded his head because he was afraid that if he said anything it would wake him up from this amazing dream that he was having. Neville closed his eyes and leaned up on his tippy toes to reach Blaise. Blaise helped him out by leaning down a bit. The kiss was everything that a first kiss should be. Gentle, alone, and sweet. Once Neville pulled away, he laughed a bit with a huge grin on his face. He looked back up to Blaise.
“That doesn’t fucking matter kid. He still did it, so yeah, forgive me for worrying the slightest bit.” Sirius’ voice was raised at this point, and Remus had a hand on his back in an effort to calm him down.
“I thought I’ve told you to stop mentioning that muggle god.” He glanced over at him. “You know it confuses me.” Remus laughed a bit.
“Of course I deny it! You don’t bloody listen. You said you wanted me to explain, and you’re not even letting me talk! Merlin, you’re so stubborn sometimes.” Harry jumped a bit at that. Draco was just so loud.
“Come on. Tonight’s gonna be fun. I don’t wanna worry about that right now.” She turned to her makeup bag and picked up a bright pink lip gloss. She then turned to Pansy with a smirk on her face. “Now Pansy. I think this would look just fabulous on you.” Pansy’s eyes widened with a laugh.
"Sounds a lot like you." Professor Sprout shot back playfully at him. Blaise laughed a bit at her statement.
“Poor thing.” She said through her laughs. He looked at her bewildered. That wasn’t funny. That was his best friend thinking that something as stupid as this would ruin them. No way. Not after everything.
“Hey, you okay?” Pansy leaned over and whispered to him. Seamus snapped out of his gaze, and looked over to her.
neville: what about still being friends? i mean i guess yeah it wasn't the answer i was hoping for but
“Don’t point over there Gin!” He whispered harshly. Ginny’s eyes widened and she looked back at the table to see Blaise looking at them. She looked back to Neville and groaned.
“Well then.” She looked over to Draco, as she barely kept herself together. He looked queasy. Rightfully so. Everyone knew that his was going to be the worst. “Your turn.” She smiled lightly at him and put her hand on top of his.
“What?” Ron asked now that he had finally finished chewing. Harry was clearly trying to hide his laughter. He was also clearly failing miserably. “Oh, buzz off Harry.” Ron rolled his eyes and smiled a bit. It was nice. The atmosphere, but that wouldn’t last very long.
“It’s okay Harry.” Hermione knew why Harry was looking at her. He was asking for her approval. She was tortured at Malfoy Manner. Harry smiled.
"Neville? Are you in here?" Professor Sprout's voice rang through the greenhouse. Neville stepped away from Blaise quickly as Blaise coughed.
“How am I wrong?” Neville asked. “I’m the plant master-“ Blaise raised his eyebrows at that. “-Your words not mine.” Neville said in his defense.
“Alright.” Malfoy moved closer and bent down to kiss Harry goodbye. “Text me when you get back.” Harry leaned up to give him another kiss which Draco smiled into.
“Oh he’ll be occupied alright.” Hermione kicked his foot under the table. “Blimey Hermione!” He exclaimed. The others gave them odd looks, but mostly ignored it.
Harry rounded the corner, and stepped into the restricted section. He felt arms wrap around him from behind, and a smile found its way into his face. Two hands were placed over his eyes followed by short giggle. “Guess who.”
harry: you’d tell me if this would get u seriously hurt though right? cause ur safety is more important than some stupid christmas thing
“You sure you’re okay?” Harry said softly, as he and Draco were finishing up unpacking their belongings. Draco glanced up at him.
pansy: i could’ve told you that you liked him the minute he rejected your handshake first year dummy
harry: i don’t really know actually i have a feeling that remus was talking for the both of them he said that they support me no matter what but sirius says that he’s ‘processing’
hermione: you know, as head girl of the gryffindor house, it’s my responsibility to tell the teachers when a fellow student has snuck out of class.
“Harry, Blaise is saying Draco’s saying the picture is fake. Maybe just try talking to him about it?” Neville suggested softly.
remus: sirius it was a private teacher no students meeting for a reason, honestly you’re gonna get us fired
draco: i walk out of the fucking common room, AND EVERY SINGLE WALL IS COVERED IN THE DAILY PROPHET AKA US MAKING TF OUT
“Guys I’m serious. This looks stupid on me.” Seamus said, and he tried his best to smooth down his suit as they walked through the halls of the castle. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Dunno.” He said as he sat down next to Pansy. “Maybe.” Pansy nodded as she looked down at the broken bottle of alcohol besides her.
“Sirius for the love of God.” Remus sighed and he pulled Sirius’ waving hand down. “Leave the poor kid alone.”
“Okay, so mum said that we’re just gonna apparate back to the Burrow. Is that fine?” Ron asked the others.
blaise: currently in detention, with draco and pansy, for covering professor lupin with rainbow glitter
“It seems like quite a lot of people are staring at us.” Luna said softly as she looked around the ball room. She wasn’t wrong. Quite a lot of people were staring at them.
Ginny and Blaise did not end up sitting together, and thank merlin for that. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco ended up in one compartment. Blaise, Pansy, Neville, and Connor in another. And, finally, Ginny, Luna, Seamus, and Dean were together.
Harry gathered his stuff. He was hoping that everyone was too focused on their assignments to notice him leaving, but he was wrong.
“Uh, yeah?” Draco said, but it was more of a question. Harry looked up at him and sighed. He than sat up, and he was followed by a very confused Draco.
“My track record? Are you kidding me?” Draco scoffed. “You’re always the one telling me that I’m a better person, and that I’m not evil, so does that only apply when it’s convenient to you?”
“Just fucking peachy.” Draco said as he joined them at the table, his voice laced with sarcasm. He quickly kissed Harry’s forehead, but Harry pulled back and gave him and odd look.
draco: well yeah but its true, dad hates me and my mum was always too caught up with my dad to really care about me
“I thought you said you brought A blanket. Not FIVE blankets.” Harry smiled shyly and led Draco over towards the mini blanket fort that he had built.
“Listen, I know that you guys didn’t invite me here to just to have lunch, so let’s just get to the point before this gets even more awkward than it already is.” Sirius and Remus just stared at him, and then Sirius cleared his throat.
“Shit.” Draco stopped in his tracks. “Shit, shit, shit.” He looked up to see that everyone else had stopped to. Some with looks of panic on their faces, the others eyeing the Slytherins up with worrying gazes. The platform went silent as soon as his father’s voice rang through it. Loud, clanking, footsteps were approaching them. Draco was frozen.
“Jesus christ Ronald.” Hermione sighed. “He likes Malfoy.” She gestured toward Harry. Ron’s face went pale.
“Seamus.” The name rang out again, but this time the voice wasn’t Pansy’s. Seamus dropped the bottle of Vodka and whipped his head around. Standing there, he saw a confused Dean Thomas who had Hannah Abbot attached to his other arm. Seamus felt as though he could vomit. Or cry. Or maybe both.
“So you’re saying is that he’s still hung up over that, so he made a fake photo to, like, ruin us?” Harry questioned.
harry: sirius is being really quiet. it’s makes me think that you’re doing that thing where you speak for the both of you because you think whatever sirius is gonna say is gonna hurt my feelings.
neville: harry left free period early and now he suddenly has all of his work done so who helped him
“Exactly what I’m saying. Show me the picture again.” He approached Harry. He wasn’t stopped this time. Harry pulled out his phone and pulled up the photo.
“Guys, look at what Harry just sent me.” Draco held his phone in front of Pansy and Blaise’s faces. Pansy giggled a bit, and Blaise cupped his hands around his mouth.
pansy: LMAO A LITTLE FIRST YEAR CAME UP TO ME TODAY AND WAS LIKE “did you know that ur best friend is you know who?” HAISUAJENA
harry: i think they were, well, surprised. remus seemed to be okay with it, sirius is um ‘processing’
draco: have you even asked your mum yet ron? i mean, malfoys don’t really have a good track record when it comes to the weasleys
pansy: well he was but she ditched him, seamus ditched me.... BOOM we danced and now we’re hanging out
“Don’t call me dude. That’s so weird. We’re like snogging, and you’re calling me dude.” Harry gave him a devilish look.
harry: nothing it’s just odd, he keeps asking me if it’s hard to date u cause ur a slytherin and i’m a gryffindor and shit like that
“Holy shit, right?” Pansy nodded towards Dean as she pulled him somewhat away from the group. “How are you not shitting yourself right now?” Seamus laughed a bit.
“Fuck you.” He said. “Listen I get why you don’t like me. I’m like a tiny little ball of anger just waiting to explode. You’re better off with Hannah anyways. At least she’s not annoying, and-“ Seamus was cut off by Dean’s lips. Dean’s lips pressed against his. Dean didn’t know why he did it. Maybe it was because he didn’t know what else to do. Maybe it was because he wanted Seamus to stop saying whatever bullshit he was saying. Maybe it was cause he actually did like him back and he didn’t know how else to convince Seamus that he did.
“Draco?” Harry mumbled, and Draco hummed in response. “Are you okay?” He finished in a sad tone. Draco looked over to him with a confused look.
“Yup. He probably did the thing that all those muggles do. You know? Editing, or whatever.” Harry nodded in agreement. Well, that was settled, so why did Harry still feel like crying? Oh no. He was gonna start crying wasn’t he? Yup. Oh, Merlin he was crying.
“It’s not funny.” He said as he pulled his arm away from her hands. Her smile dropped and she gave him an odd look.
“You know what? Screw our families.” Draco’s voice cracked. “We don’t even want to be there anyways. Who cares if we got disowned? Were you guys really planning on going back there after school anyways?” He asked his friends who both spoke their head no.
“Mr. Potter?” McGonagall said as everyone was leaving the class. “Stay here for a few minutes. I want to talk to you.” He nodded his head and looked back to his friends who were all giving him questioning looks.
hey guys, this is just a short little chapter to finish up the dates... hope you enjoy, another chapter should be up tomorrow or the next day
“Listen if you want to talk to Harry so bad, just walk over there. Don’t yell across the fucking ballroom.” Sirius started walking in Harry’s direction.
“So, tell me Mr. Potter...” She started. “How exactly did you become friends with Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Zabani, and Ms. Parkinson?” Harry’s eyes widened.
"Alright. Well you boys should get going. See you later." They boys left, and Harry was still in shock.
um if u cant already tell i don’t really fancy ginny. don’t kill me. don’t kill me. she’s gonna get better i swear. i just, needed to make her a bitch for a few chapter. to, ya know, release my hatred. she’ll get better. okay? okay.
seamus: do you like pansy? not that i would care just we’re suppose to tell each other everything and shit so i just thought that you would’ve told me
“You’re allowed to complain about your abusive father dude.” He said as he wiped the tears from his face. Draco cringed at the nickname.
harry: something along the lines of i’m not breaking up with draco so either accept that or figure it out
harry: you and sirius couldn’t happen to get me ron and mione into the train early so that we could get good seats???
draco: and his ugly hair and fucking bright green eyes and his annoying voice just makes me wanna die
"No." Draco answered. Harry nodded as they approached the office door. He looked at Draco and then knocked on the door. Draco tensed up beside him. The door opened slowly to reveal Remus. He looked back into the room, stepped out of it, and closed the door behind him.
hermione: harry it’s pretty obvious that u went somewhere with malfoy because for some reason you think that remus and sirius will flip out so you think that u have to sneak around with him
Seamus listened as Pansy and Luna talked about whatever it was they were taking about. Okay, he wasn’t really listening. In fact, he was staring at Dean and Hannah. On the dance floor. Laughing. Having fun. Gross.
“Oh, so your not worried at all?” He asked her. Pansy shook her head as she continued to shove more food into her mouth.
What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. Dean was kissing him. Holy shit. Mother of Merlin. What is happening?
seamus: if they are tell them to give it to me too i have to do potions and transfiguration and i’m more scared of them then sirius and remus
"No." Sirius cut him off. "I've already heard what you have to say. I'd like to hear it from Draco." Draco's head snapped up.
“Yeah....” Blaise trailed off, his eyes watering after reading Neville’s messages. They cared. They cared about them. That had to be a first. They weren’t used to this. Before this year, they only had each other.
Draco nodded, unsteadily. His eyes had barely left his own envelope since it arrived. He felt Harry take his hand into his and squeeze it.
neville: yes she's right you idiot are you oblivious i'm pretty sure everyone and their mother noticed that we liked each other
hermione: “due to the events of last year, we have decided that there won’t be as much separation between houses. you will still sleep in your dorm rooms and have classes with your house, but things such as trips to hogsmead will be separated by year instead of house. you will also be able to sit wherever you wish during meals.”
harry: hey guys hate to disappoint but i will not be attending the yule ball, sorry babe ur gonna have to find another date
draco: what are the sleeping arrangements for this whole thing cause if i’m stuck in a room with u, i will simply just sleep outside
blaise: baby u have every right to want revenge, but trust me, once you do something like that, it never leaves ur head
Just as they suspected, three bright red envelopes fell onto the table in front of them. Everyone stared at them for a bit, until Blaise finally cleared his throat.
Draco made move to get up, but Harry grabbed his wrist. “Hey, love, wait.” Draco ripped his wrist away from him.
pansy: ok so basically 1-5 year we had a jar called the potter jar and basically anytime draco said anything about potter he had to put a knut in the jar
-also i just started rereading the series and i don’t remember that much about blaise so sorry if his character is off
draco: do you ever wonder why i didn’t tell my aunt that it was you? i knew it was you but i didn’t tell her.
Neville, along with Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Dean, and Seamus, were sitting on Harry’s bed trying to get him to calm down.
“Now that you guys have established yourself as the cool uncles, or whatever...” Harry trailed off as he looked over to where Draco, Blaise, Neville, and Ginny were standing. “I’m gonna go hang out with my friends. Try not to be embarrassing again.” He huffed and walked off. One night. All he wanted was one normal night. One night where he wasn’t the center of attention.
“Yeah. You’re just short.” Neville added quickly. Harry laughed at that and Seamus hit Neville’s shoulder.
“Please stop crying.” Dean said as he held Seamus close to him. Seamus tried to pull away, but Dean help him even closer. “Stop.”
“Listen.” He started. “I get why your skeptical, but you really have nothing to worry about.” Sirius scoffed.
“Your parents.” Harry started, and Draco’s eyes widened. “They’re pretty horrible aren’t they?” He finished. Draco sighed.
neville: i should probaby tell ginny and luna though, i don't think it's good to keep lying to them, especially when it's official
“Do you?” Pansy spoke up. Dean’s watery eyes snapped to her. He shrugged. Did he? Yeah, Seamus was his best friend, but.....
blaise: draco used to send his mother letters about how much he hated harry potter’s stupid hair and his stupid green eyes and his stupid glasses and his stupid face
draco: alright u absolute nimwits, i don’t know if you’ve noticed but we’re in class rn, and professor sprout already doesn’t really like me. my phone going off dozens of times isn’t helping my case.
“Hey Dray?” Draco whipped his around to find Harry struggling to hold at least seven textbooks. “Can you help me carry these back to my dorm? Neville and Hermione are still studying for their Transfig exam.” As one of Harry’s books fell out of his hands, Draco reached over and caught it. He thought that that was very smooth of him.
“Alright, this one’s for all my happy couples out there.” Slow music boomed over the ballroom. Seamus rolled his eyes, groaned, and put his head down in his hands. Pansy looked around the ballroom. Luna had just gotten up to dance with Ginny. Everyone and their mother saw that coming. Draco and Harry were dancing. Blaise and Neville. Hermione and Ron. They were the only two left.
pansy: like ik a bunch of you guys are dating and shit but like this is gonna make it official official
“Your child is eighteen. You cant control him anymore.” Sirius growled right back. Before they knew it, they had apparated back to the Burrow. Leaving a fuming Lucius Malfoy behind them.
“Bye.” He said and then he made his way out of the restricted section and towards his first class. Draco stood there wondering how he got so lucky.
“Don’t.” Harry muttered out, and he went to lean against a support beam just off of the balcony. They stood there for a while. Harry staring at the stars. Draco staring at Harry. Finally, Harry broke the silence.
harry: first, we’re not shagging jesus and second, pretty sure old voldy was our worst enemy but go off
Harry felt the bonds release and the dildo slipped from his hole easily. He flopped onto the seat and groaned as the fabric rubbed against his sensitive prick.
Draco finished getting dressed and slowly made his way to meet his husband down by the car. His mind was blasting through scenarios of Harry leaving him, but the man beside him practically glowed as he walked towards him. Some minuscule part of him still thought it was a trick. He couldn't think too much on it, because they were in the car and pulling off into traffic soon enough.
"Actually, Travis, I think Potter was right. I slept through lunch. I have an on-site job today; I should go get my portkey scheduled before it's too late. Maybe next time?" he asked with a small fake smile and a raised eyebrow.
"I'm sorry I haven't told anyone else yet," he said quietly. Harry knew Draco wasn't ashamed of them, he was just proud and more than a little cowardly if he was being honest about it. He grabbed the blond's hand and kissed his knuckles realizing with a start that Draco did wear his ring to work, he just kept it glamoured. His heart soared.
"What're you talking about?" Draco's head snapped up and they're staring at each other. Harry reaches a hand over to clasp his husband's, a loving smile on his face. "Draco, I think you're bloody gorgeous."
Draco sends another spell at the younger man's mouth to shut him up ans watches as he flounders trying to talk but no sound comes out.
"I've heard the rumors, Potter," Draco growled, moving his hands away from the ravenette beside him and up to his chest. "You have a girlfriend. She's so beautiful and blonde and from the bloody colonies."
part of us with the world. Our home. Our relationship. I was so used to it being about us that I didn't want anyone else to come in and ruin it. Then you were offered the promotion for the Auror position and I was so close to making Senior down with the curse breakers and I wanted to know that I had done it on my own. I was being selfish. I'm always being selfish."
"Well yeah, that's what we discussed last-" Before he could say another word Draco had a hand thrown over his mouth and a very serious face on.
He would have said that nothing was worse than their entrance, but then the ball actually started and he had to watch as Ron pined for Hermione who was being whisked off by
The next morning Harry Potter is walking towards his office as one of the head Aurors at the ministry when he notices the back of Draco Malfoy, leaning beside his door frame. He smiles, because Draco has to come to work hours before him, but still has time to stop by. He sticks a hand into his bag and pulls out a thermos of tea just the way Draco likes it, but as he gets closer he notices the blond isn't alone.
"You know," Draco started when they were both sitting in the astronomy tower, "if you keep staring at me like that when we're in public, someone is bound to find out."
"He isn't going anywhere with you," Travis said placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. "You're probably drunk. I'll take him home when he's ready to leave."
"I did not sleep through lunch!" Draco said sitting up indignantly. "I have an alarm that wakes me up for lunch."
"Ron always tries to convince me not to meet with you." They'd been doing this for a while now, studying together, it started around third year when Malfoy had admitted how much he actually enjoyed Care of Magical Creatures to Zabini and Nott while Harry had snuck into Hogsmeade under his cloak. Sessions had gotten even more frequent now that Harry was in the Triwizards Tournament.
He brushes past both of them and into his office but before he could get the door shut, Draco's foot was holding it open.
"I've been watching you and Weasley pouting all night. Meanwhile, I was still over there waiting for you to sweep me off my feet," Draco said gracefully dropping into the seat next to Harry, all long limbs and elegant angles.
"I'm almost positive you never expected this when we were in school, did you Potter?" Harry knew he wasn't expecting a response. "Or maybe you did want this. I always knew you were such a little masochist. You could have defeated my lord with your eyes closed, but you chose to submit."
"I- I just don't want you to be disgusted and not want to be with me anymore. I really c- I really love you," he had that determined look on his face again. "I don't think I could deal with you hating me again..."
"She was uh visiting family in the neighborhood. Met her when Dudley was messing 'round with a couple of his friends at the park."
"Just thinking you should get away from the Wizarding world for a while. You seem stressed and I know exactly where I want to take you."
"Harry!" she said getting more excited. "That's great! It means he's making progress. He's comfortable in his career and more than comfortable in his relationship with you and-"
"I told you we should have hired someone from the DMLE to watch the perimeters," says Draco crossing his arms and looking over their property "Mother's going to be absolutely livid. She still haven't forgiven the bastards for destroying the rose bushes she planted in the front garden."
Somehow, even having eaten at a muggle restaurant, Draco and Harry are plastered on the cover of the Daily Prophet.
He knows Harry will say he looked good either way, but he would rather not have his wedding portrait look like he's utterly sad and unkempt especially when he looks at Harry and feels the complete opposite.
"It's not too bad, Auror Potter, sir," he says before lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, "I get to hear all the ministry gossip."
The day of the Yule Ball is one of the most stressful days Harry has ever had to encounter. His dress robes, though appropriate, were tight and uncomfortable because Draco had picked them out before the entire girlfriend-from-the-states debacle and he had said they made his arse look good. Ron's robes were hideous hand-me-downs and Harry wished he could have helped his friend, even if he did laugh all the way to Ravenclaw tower to pick up Padma.
Draco looks over and watches his mother greet guest after guest at the gate. Her posture is perfect, he head is held high, and the only sign that she'd had any drink at all was the slight tinge of color high on her cheeks. Her smile however, was soft and bright as she let each friend into the yard. He doesn't think he's seen her smile like that since he was a child and the feeling to cry fills him almost to the brim again before he's able to shake it off. He'd never thought his own happiness would be enough to make other people so happy, but then he thinks of Harry and he sees his mother's soft smile and he wants to cry in elation.
been. Because while all Harry did was sleep his days away and drink the evenings, Ron is stepping up and taking responsibility, becoming the man the War torn world now expects him to be. Harry too is expected to be a man, more of one than Ron but every time he even thinks of getting out of the house, meeting people, talking about... anything, he feels bile rise to his throat.
That voice, that intensity. The thinly masked rage. He doesn’t know how long a measly door will hold Potter back in a mood like this.
Swallowing once more, Harry nods and Draco’s breath puffs over the thin skin of his wrist, making his toes clench with the arousal that simple feeling brings.
Eventually, Draco probably takes mercy on Harry who is now arching and spasming on the bed almost continuously. With one finger slipping into his hole fairly easily, he doesn’t bother teasing and just swallows Harry’s dick down as far as it goes from the angle at which he’s sitting.
At this point, Draco has begun to get dizzy from the sheer speed at which she talks and how much information she seems willing to share with him about their personal lives, even if it does happen to be about Potter’s owl. He holds up a pointed hand to stall her barrage of words.
They don’t feel the way Draco always holds on to the pulse point at Scorpius’ wrist, the subtle reminder of life. They don’t see Draco’s silent tears illuminated by the full moon, sliding down his cheeks– cheeks so much paler than they were even a year ago– when he thinks Scorpius is asleep.
Pansy leaves in three days, and Harry’s relationship with her improves significantly. By the time she’s leaving, she’s progressed to the point where the hug between them is awkward but not stiff, where a parting smile is natural, not offensively mocking.
Harry doesn’t have an answer for that which will make sense or be believable to someone who thinks they are hallucinating so he goes with a simple but firm, “No.”
She shakes her head. “For him.” She stops, takes a breath and says, “Ron’s alright, I’m alright. We see Healers, we can talk. Harry didn’t hurt us on purpose. He didn’t even see us wherever he was. But Harry hurt himself more than any of us can understand. And I’m scared for him.”
Harry’s tongue is working the vein on the underside of his cock, narrow, stiff strokes that send electricity jolting down Draco’s spine. He switches it up ever so often with swirling motions, and broad, firm strokes and when he draws up, he wraps a hand around the base of Draco’s cock and strokes with perfect pressure.
Every time he has either imperiously told the buggers asking to fuck off and stay out of his personal life, or shrugged ineloquently and gone back to other topics.
But then Harry’s hands are on him again, gentle and steadying and so tender and Draco can’t hold back the tear that escapes. He can feel the path it traces, down his temple, onto the sheets and he waits for Harry to move away, pick up his robes and leave, because Draco can’t even do the one thing Harry returns to him for right.
A hush overwhelms the Gryffindor table. Granger and Ginevra stop their conversation, looking helplessly towards the door, as though hoping it will open again to admit Potter. Finnegan and Thomas are looking at each other while Longbottom stares at Potter’s untouched plate. Out of them all, only Lovegood continues to weave, an odd serenity in her expression.
“You were angry and you fucked up once, Ginevra. It’s not the same thing.” He’s hoarse. Hoarser than he was the night after Harry left him in a hotel room once with come sliding down his thighs, his face buried in the pillow, his throat burning from where Harry had pressed against his Adam’s apple with all the lean, coiled energy of a wildcat.
He hears voices downstairs as he changes out of his pants and pulls on the only clean underwear he could find shoved at the back of the shelf. It’s not Ron, Ron is with George right now. He can make out Hermione’s voice and she seems to either be ranting or explaining a detailed plan to someone.
He turns his eyes from a close survey of the orange flames to the woman’s face. She’s pretty, but not exactly his type. He likes darker hair, lighter eyes. Sharper jawlines.
“It’s not fine,” Harry says under his breath, swiping his hands through his hair, brushing errant strands out of his face. “It’s a fucking mess.”
“I sat on the floor of your kitchen.” He seems to realise what he said and his eyes widen and his lips stretch into a grimace, “I didn’t mean it like that–”
Scorpius heaves a sigh. He had known it would be difficult, but this is simultaneously harder and easier than he had expected. On one hand, he doesn’t have to placate distraught, disbelieving parents who seem to be in denial. On the other, every bit of Scorpius’ soul aches with the vulnerability in Draco’s mouth and Harry’s clenched jaw.
Harry’s knowledge of bondage is limited but during one particularly scarring conversation with Hermione, it had been explained what a safe word was.
‘You never let me do this,’ Draco says when he finally pulls off. He brings his hands to Harry’s nipples, gently flicking them, scraping his nails against them and twisting them as Harry almost sobs.
“Gin,” Harry sighs, because he knows where she’s coming from. The less impulsive part of him that’s looking for stability screams assent with the sentiment. “It’s complicated.”
Something about Potter has always put Draco’s instincts at a confusing juxtaposition of immediate backpedal and aggressive offence. Run away from his intensity, pull his pigtails till he cries.
“How?” Harry whispers. His head is a riot of colour and thoughts he can’t discern, but there are words he can still make sense of, and
“Mr Potter,” she begins, clearing her throat, looking down at her notes. “You submitted Pensieve memories of everything you testified to having witnessed, yes?”
“I… I don’t know what to say,” Hermione starts. “He didn’t look any of those things when he was here. He was attentive when we were talking and he had inputs occasionally and I…” she stops here. “He did have a panic attack at the beginning but I thought that was just common PTSD and anxiety. But it’s probably more extensive than we understand.”
After that, the pleasure is an upward curve. With one finger that gradually turns to two stimulating his prostate and the other rubbing strong strokes up and down his cock, Draco is about ready to come when Harry removes the hand on his cock and stops moving the one inside him.
“Mutually beneficial,” Malfoy says and nods when their server appears with a plateful of steaming pizza that makes Harry’s mouth water. “She was… dating someone she shouldn’t have and I was… compromised.”
“Fucking Merlin, Potter, you’re… glorious!” Draco ultimately says, throwing his hands up. “You… don’t just get to call me good when you’re kind and brilliant and deserving of literally anyone who isn’t me!”
“But like it or not,” Draco says, “You are. For a lot of people. No matter what shit you do, that is all you will ever be to a lot of people. The guy who ended the regime of terror of an insane megalomaniac.”
“Are you homophobic?” Harry demands, jerking his hand back. If that’s something else he needs to deal with—
“I’ll tell you mine if you want to tell me yours,” he murmurs, lips brushing against Harry’s own with every word when he comes back up.
“Because episodes announce themselves weeks in advance, is that it? They book appointments and carefully put you out of commission on weekends so that you don’t have to attend that terribly elitist costume party where everyone will be gossiping about the newly engaged couple and the host’s investments.”
“So what you propose is a curriculum for children ensuring when they reach Hogwarts they are of the essentially same magical and muggle background regardless of blood status?” Malfoy asks, chewing his lower lip.
‘I’ll make it up to you,’ Harry murmurs against the shell of Draco’s ear. ‘I promise, love. I’ll make all of this up to you.’
“Will you still leave?” he asks, the naked hope in his voice verging on embarrassing. He cringes and looks away, but there’s a hand in his hair and another on his cheekbone, rubbing circles into his skin.
They had seen him in tatters, shreds of a real person and instead of running or leaving, they had stayed and fixed up not only him but also the mess he made. Of his people and of his home. A lump rises in his throat as he watches the two of them sleep, chests rising and falling in unison. Draco raises a hand in his sleep and brushes away a stray lock of hair from his forehead and all Harry wants to do is pick him up, take him to bed, tuck him in, kiss his forehead and when it is time, wake him slowly, with his mouth on his dick.
He tries to organise the thoughts swimming in his head into a coherent explanation in which he doesn’t come off as too pathetic or too pitiful, but Blaise’s voice cuts through the fog in his brain with the forthright simplicity Draco both hates and loves him for–
And unlike his relationship with Draco, their relationships with Draco are all still thriving. If they’re ever in need, they’re more than well provided for by the terms of his will which leave Draco in charge. Draco might pretend to not give a damn about Ronald Weasley, especially after the caustic divorce with Hermione, but there’s a fondness there he can’t deny. It was born sometime when it had dawned on them both that Harry Potter was independently important in both their lives and it was in everyone’s best interests for them to not throw beer at each other in the Leaky.
The months right after the War, Harry had felt something in himself give way with every single funeral he attended and eulogy he found himself giving. By the time he had attended the last one, he felt far more drained than he had ever felt before. The pain of Sirius’ death was compounded a thousand times, the cries of agony and the whizzing lights of Avada Kedavra and Crucio reverberating and echoing in his skull.
When he reaches the bedroom upstairs and sets Draco down, trying his best to be gentle, the grey eyes open for a brief moment. They’re fogged up and hazy from sleep but even in his barely conscious state, Draco smiles at the sight of Harry.
Granger (I do not mean to be offensive but Hermione seems unnatural and I shall stick to Granger and write it with utmost affection),
“Yeah, I… can I join you guys?” Potter asks sheepishly. He looks uncertain, as though he’s expecting them to say no.
The night is quiet and the only sounds are the gentle lapping of the waters of the Great Lake against the broken shore and the wind rustling through the trees of the Forbidden Forest in the distance. When Potter speaks, his voice carries to where Draco’s standing.
“It’s been three days, Malfoy. Not a word from you, not a sound, not a call. You just disappeared, blocked your Floo and turned away all the owls Hermione sent. What on earth is the matter with you? You do something like that and then don’t even bother to apologise?!”
Draco seems happier here than he did in Florence or in San Gimignano. There, he had been burdened by the weight of his exile and the weight of nostalgia. Here he exists, the shell of the old Draco Malfoy falling away to reveal the man who gets excited by history, by the prospect of passing by Keats’ house, marvels open-mouthed at the marble steps and stone archways.
“If it was him I wished to speak to, child, I would,” the stranger says, amusement tinging the heavy accent lighter.
Not the roughened edges of affair, or the sting of cheating or the hiss of a whispered mistake. Infidelity, a name, a sin, a rounded roll of a word, sitting casually between them.
Draco nods because he thinks he understands. “I was thinking Italy,” he ventures of his own surprised accord. “The Dark Lord’s tendrils didn’t extend into Italy quite as much. The Government was exceptionally resistant. They won’t care quite as much about this,” he says, twitching his left forearm.
Harry takes one hand from his hair and Draco barely stifles the urge to whine at the loss of contact. His eyes flutter when Harry doesn’t take it away, but instead, slides it down his back, tracing the bones and curves of his spine. There’s a look in his eyes that Draco can’t place, a look that scares Draco just enough for his eyes to close and his teeth to clamp down on his lip to keep him from saying something he’ll regret.
He looks at it sometimes, studies it. Once he could bring himself to look in the mirror again, he had spent an hour tracing it with his fingernails, remembering the cold floor of the bathroom against his back, the sensation of sticky blood getting everywhere, Snape’s furious eyes watching over him, murmuring spells, pouring potions.
“Seems a little… inappropriate, doesn’t it? For a son so young to be bold enough to suggest such a relationship?” she asks.
But then again sex with Harry has never given him cause to feel the way he had been even a few minutes ago, with Harry’s hands tender on his skin and his words a gentle reminder in Draco’s head.
He knows she is more than capable of brewing her own potions with or without a partner. He asked her once in response to which she gave him an indecipherable look that quickly turned unimpressed and told him in no uncertain terms to, “Get on with the damn sprinkling of the Cornish Pixie dust, Malfoy, or do you want me to relegate you to Seamus’ level in Potions?” He hadn’t asked after that, though the memory makes him smile a bit wider than he’d like to admit.
Sometimes she reads at the table but he notices how her eyes keep shifting to the door as though she is hoping against hope that Potter will make an appearance. Anytime the doors swing open, her head jerks up, anytime someone brushes past her, a hopeful expression makes its way onto her face only to drop. Sometimes she notices him staring and schools her face into neutrality but it isn’t as successful as she would probably like it to be. There’s only so much someone can do to mask the depth of their emotions, especially Gryffindors used to wearing their hearts on their sleeves and their thoughts on their faces.
Harry doesn’t relent or hold back, he licks and licks and licks until Draco thinks he is either going to die from the edge he’s on or kill Harry. He reaches down, trying to grab at Harry’s hair but since his head is too far down, he grips at the bedsheets. His cock is so hard he thinks a brush of air against it would set him off.
“It is not a secret that the Dark Lord divided his soul into Horcruxes. Hermione Granger and I have revealed this to the press prior to this hearing. I was… in touch with one of these Horcruxes. It led us to form something of a mental link with the Dark Lord. We were able to gain insight into his… memories without his knowledge. I have seen Draco Malfoy refusing to do Voldemort’s bidding. I have felt the… weight of his disappointment turn to satisfaction at the possibility of torturing… a… an innocent face.”
Luna casts a spell and the room glows slightly as though a wall sconce has been lit in one corner of the room. There are shadows lurking here and there, eerie shapes in the darkness but the light doesn’t hurt at all. Instead, Harry feels warmer. He peers through his lids, opening them only a fraction.
“Where are you going?” His voice is unexpectedly hoarse when it comes out and he cringes at how exhausted it sounds from the screaming he did downstairs.
“That was some three days” he says after spending a few seconds simply staring at Harry’s face as though he is trying to memorise every inch of it, commit it perfectly to memory. When the words register their meaning, Harry huffs a laugh.
Harry lets him touch, lets him feel, and Draco is saved by the elegant bridge of Harry’s nose and the cliff’s edge of his cheekbones.
Harry’s hand slides up his chest, under his shirt, pressing against the pulse of Draco’s beating heart. It’s not a sexual touch, but Draco welcomes it, holds on to it, lets it anchor him.
“Draco, I–“ she begins, and hesitates. “I will always love him. But it’s been a while and I– I don’t think–“
This, Draco thinks, this is the moment to laugh hysterically. This is the moment to tell himself that the side effects of too many Calming Draughts are settling in and he is definitely hallucinating even if his hallucinations tell him they aren’t hallucinations. Hallucinations aren’t supposed to know who they are anyway. They’re not supposed to let you know either. So he can’t trust what his hallucinations tell him. Because unless he’s hallucinating, Potter is standing in front of him, wand holstered away, saying he is in Malfoy Manor to apologise and that, that is a stretch even for someone who likes stretching the truth to its furthest limits the way Draco does.
Draco pauses on his way to the door, towel still slung around his hips, hair wet and a little, nervous smile playing at his lips.
“Would you like to get a coffee?” Weasley asks with a small smile and a tilt of her head which sends the messily done braid flying curling over her shoulder. “Luna’s shop is just around the corner.”
“As friends!” Potter rushes to clarify, once he realises what asking someone to a Ball implies, the dunderhead.
“I need to pack,” Harry repeats and Draco’s face falls. His lower lip trembles and his eyebrows furrow and his whole body curls in on itself. Harry figures there should at least be a little bit of pride to be found in reducing Draco Malfoy to this, but even as he searches the darkest, murkiest parts of himself, nothing resembling triumph surfaces. There is only disappointment.
She continues, to Draco’s puzzlement and slight amusement, to switch between calling him Draco and Malfoy. He doesn’t know whether to find it annoying or amusing. He himself cannot imagine calling her Hermione yet. In any case, the question she asked deserves a response, no matter how humiliating it is for him.
The moment shatters when he blinks, a sharp jolt into reality. Harry’s parted lips shift into a smirk and with a whispered spell, his hand is slick with lube.
Harry raises his hand to the side of her neck, feeling for a pulse. Harder, harder, his frantic fingers search, pushing ruthlessly against the delicate curve of her limp throat. Even a broken thread of it would be hopeful enough—
"I know it's a mess," Draco said tossing it back over his shoulder before looking pointedly at Harry's mop of messy dark curls, "but you hardly have room to criticize. Now stop staring into space. The first task is dragons and as you know-"
"I don't know what rumors you've started, Ackers, but Draco and I have been married for longer than either of us have had a job in the Ministry and I love him with everything I've got." Harry takes a step closer, not breaking eye contact but the air is starting to crackle around them. It smells like a storm brewing on the quidditch pitch when he lifts a finger and pokes at Travis' chest. "I am smart enough to let my husband make his own friends and decisions because he is a grown man, but if you ever approach me like this again it will be the end of you. I'm an Auror and the bloody saviour of the Wizarding world and you think I'd be scared of you? Please. I won't hesitate to turn you into a beetle and crush you under my heel. Do I make myself clear?"
"No, of course not," Harry said turning into the parking lot of the simple muggle place he had been wanting to take him for dinner. "You just meant you can't hang around with men practically half your age and flirt with them anymore because now people know you actually have a husband. How un-bloody-fortunate!"
They stop talking at home and that Thursday at pub night even Ron can feel the tension between them. Neville is between them in the booth acting as a buffer and just when Draco is three drinks in and Harry is about to apologize, in walks Travis wearing a tight green v-neck with a pair of jeans slung low on his hips. He is the youngest out of all of them and as he slides into the end of the booth next to Draco the group seems to collectively freeze.
"I know you love me, darling," says Harry still not looking Draco in the face. The blond grabs his face with a huff of a laugh, turning it so that they're staring into each other's eyes and he blushes before ultimately even he has to look away from the intensity in those green eyes.
Draco doesn't find out how the news breaks until Harry comes in for their usual lunch session with a paper in his hand and self-deprecating smile on his face. He slides the newspaper over with a shake of his head and a hand through his hair.
"Change into something more muggle, yeah?" Harry said with a quirk of his lips. The blond agreed as he made his way up to their shared bedroom and began pulling off his curse breaker uniform and sliding into a more comfortable pair of slacks.
The ride to the restaurant is much less rushed thanks to traffic, but they're still cornered by a couple of Wizarding press members on their way inside of the establishment. A stern look from Harry and Draco reaching for his wand sends them running for the hills.
paying for lunch, then? Brilliant," said Draco with that self-satisfied look still on his face. "Off you pop. Auror business, remember, Potter?"
"Draco, you don't think it's a little mad to be jealous over a fake person. A fake person based on, ya know,
! Well then...proceed," he said with a flippant hand motion as he conjured a small chaise and leisurely sat on it as if this was his plan all along. Harry smirked at a battle won, but looked a bit more nervous at the prospect of actually being watched. "Harry, you know you don't have to if you don't want to. I'm not going to- I don't want you to feel like-"
"So the rest of the Ministry doesn't matter to you?" Travis says as if trying to catch Draco in a trap.
Draco already told some people at work about he and Potter's marriage. Of course he has, but they either don't believe him or aren't bothered either way by his relationship status and now that Travis knows, its stressful to say the least. The junior curse breakers who've heard it from Travis in the last hour or so, seem less relaxed around Draco now, as if he's going to run to Harry with everything and he let's out a groan.
"Yeah, of course," he said offhandedly before stopping her loudly as she started writing out a list of things to do. "Wait! I should-uh...probably talk to Draco about this first."
. He wore his ring (without a glamour), his hair had been tamed somewhat over the last few years and his uniform was always pressed and sealed properly. It was clear someone at home loved him. He just could never tell them who before, but that didn't mean they stopped asking or trying to set him up. "But only if they ask about it. We're all adults here. I don't care what they think either way, really, but if they ask, then..." he shrugged.
," said Harry, looking at him calmly as they sat in traffic. He wouldn't say he was used to Draco's dramatics, because that would only serve to make it worse, but after years of experience on an almost daily basis he would like to say that he's pretty well versed in responding to the blond's moods. He doesn't think he would have married him if he wasn't equipped for them.
"Not by any means- Harry, it scares me sometimes, how much I love you, how much you care for me. You've wanted to tell people we were married for ages and I kept putting it off because I didn't want to affect anything at my job, but you've been so patient with me."
Draco stomped out of his office and towards the lifts. It was moments before he was sent spiraling towards the floor that housed the majority of the Department of Magic Law Enforcement. He was pushing Harry's office door open with more force than was absolutely necessary then inviting himself to sit on his husband's desk to wait because of course the git went to get lunch alone. He was resigned to go back to his office upset or actually schedule his portkey but then Harry walked in, carrying a bag crisps from the canteen and slamming the door behind him before noticing Draco was there.
Harry did as he was told and wrapped his mouth around the cock that began to magically fucking his throat as Draxo continued to fuck his ass raw. Every time he plunged into him he felt his own toes curl at how great the man strung up before him felt as he slid on and off his cock.
"I will murder you, right here in the bloody library of you don't stop being such a git about this. I want you to go to the dance with me. I've asked you to. I apologized. What the hell do you want from me?"
"Why is that, I wonder?" Malfoy asked as the spell forced the thick cock toy in deeper. With a whispered incantation Harry gasped as he felt his cock being surrounded in a tight heat. "Answer me, Potter."
"I wouldn't sit there if I were you," Neville says politely to Travis before peeking at Harry from the corner of his eye.
"Oh- uh...Auror Potter," said Travis with a polite nod as he lowered his hand from where he was about to knock on Draco's door. "Hi."
Draco pushed himself somewhat excitedly from Harry's lap. He turned to run from the room and his husband grabbed his wrist.
"Can I-," Harry asked, reaching his hand out rubbing at the boys pale and lean body, then sliding his cock between Draco's arse cheeks.
It's the first time Harry's seen his best friend laugh or smile since this night began and he goes to smile back when Hermione joins them. She's breathless and blushing and Harry tells her she looks beautiful, but then Ron is there angry and biting rude remarks about her date that send her running out with a few biting words of her own and Harry is sitting in the corner alone just waiting for the Yule Ball to finally fucking end, because he's one of Hogwarts Champions and he can't leave until the bell tolls and the hall is prepared to be cleaned.
"So you just kept lying?" Draco asked with both eyebrows raised. "How does that seem fair? We've been together for months now and somehow an imaginary bird has all your attention. And now everyone is expecting her at the ball too."
"Not well," Harry said through a laugh, causing Madam Pince to walk around the corner of a bookshelf and
"Excuse me?" the brunette stuttered out confused and Blaise heaved a sigh. As the only unspeakable in the group, he was the only one able to fix things if Draco fucked up too badly. badmouthing a coworker could get him fired almost indefinitely.
"I didn't know they'd be there. I know you didn't want everyone to know so quickly and-" Harry thought he might be sick but he choked back the thought. He was s grown man now, he wasn't going to toss his guts just because some nosy wizards couldn't leave well enough alone. He sucked in a breath when Draco looked at him lovingly.
Draco's magic reaches forward and heals what it can but when Draco goes to remove his hand, Harry grabs it back and kisses his knuckles lightly.
"You're such a sap," Draco says, but he's smiling with flaming cheeks and Harry thinks he's done his part. He kisses his husband's knuckles softly, running a thumb over their wedding bands as a server comes to take their orders.
He pulled his wand from his sleeve and summoned the dildo connected to Harry's own prick before removing the gag and shoving the toy into the ravenette's mouth.
"This is the most attention I've gotten since..." He shakes his head.  "It's different when they want an interview for a case or something, but I haven't had this much attention on me since the trials. What if they bring them up again?"
"I'll buy you lunch, Draco. I don't mind," Travis said smiling in a way Draco was sure was supposed to be sultry, but this game want fun anymore.
"Nothing's wrong, you insufferable- look, I'm just tired, but I have some papers to get through and this way we can head home early."
"You still aren't listening, Potter," said the voice from behind him and he could hear the smirk on that devilish face.
He can feel Travis squirming in his magic and it's uncomfortable between his shoulder blades where the spell is tethered. He stomps forward into the Junior CB offices angrily. He stops in front of Travis' desk when he notices the box. It's a deep mahogany covered in runes and full of jewels. He sees one missing, though it's only sitting on the desk and he floats it back into place. He waits for it to not be this easy, because it can't possibly be
"I'm not going to make announcements," the blonde said immediately, but he was purposefully not making eye contact. "I'm going to schedule a portkey before the offices close for the day."
"Draco!" he says tragically, stumbling again and falling. It looks too well planned. Too precise. Too dramatic. And Draco would know. He doesn't move away from where he has Harry cradled in his lap and his wand is still pointed dangerously at a now coughing Travis.
"Well, c'mon. Now it's time for the fun to begin." Harry stood on shaking legs with his head facing the floor as he followed Malfoy out of the punishment room.
The light from the moon had fell on each of them in a way that made the entire situation seem a little less real. As Harry pulled Draco in for a kiss, the blonde looked almost ethereal in the way his alabaster skin glistened under the stars. Harry's scar was bigger this close, and the light had made it look even more faded than normal. It was pale in comparison to the rest of his warm skin.
"You don't deserve Draco. He had a life before you! He's a great Curse Breaker and he doesn't need you."
"Come to the Yule Ball with me," said Harry instead. Draco was looking at him angrily, as though he were being intentionally malicious.
It took him longer than it usually would and when he had Draco's eyes immediately fell from the extreme blush of Potter's face and chest to the bulge hanging thickly between his legs. The darker man reached down with his hands to cover himself up as though his pants weren't doing well enough. The man was staring in his eyes almost stubbornly, but the blonde knew he wanted to shrink and hide in the bathroom like he usually did.
"It's one of your more stubborn qualities," Harry says cheekily, but he's looking at him by choice, his soft loving grin still in place. Draco shoves at his shoulder and walks to sit behind the desk.
"The show he deserves," Harry said more to himself and finally agreed with his friend. "Hey, 'Mione, could you, maybe..."
"Tutoring is at the same time every day, Potter," Malfoy drawled. He didn't look up as he continued marking and highlighting information in his own notes. Harry liked watching him like this, with his hair falling into his face and the end of his quill flicking back and forth across his nose.
"He was- I- It was just a bloody joke! I wanted to see him get jealous. I wanted him to- I don't know- get angry enough to shag me on the stairs or something, not just-" He groaned before turning an angry gaze towards Travis. "You just had to challenege him didn't you?"
It's Wednesday morning, but Harry and Draco are still on thin ice. They had a fantastic shag over the weekend, but even that couldn't fix the real issue.
"Mostly, sir. They're reports that need to be approved by the head of the Auror team that went on the last few big missions and that was you, sir."
"Travis," says Harry by way of explanation and it works because Draco laughs and Harry's never heard a sound he loves more. He walks over and kisses his husband's cheek because he can now. It makes him giddy and ready to eat
"I think punishment is my favorite part of keeping you, Potter." As he finished speaking he lifted the crop and sent it cracking across the globes of Harry's ass. "Count your lashes, slut."
"I'm a terrible dancer and you know it. Go back to your date, people are going to notice you talking to me, remember? What happened to not being seen? Keeping a low profile?"
"The maze and mausoleum are clear of guests," Harry says when he finally runs up to his husband's left, he hasn't quite put on his own wedding robes. They haven't gotten around to renewing their vows yet, but so many reporters had showed up that many of the guests that were actually supposed to be there were being sent to the least crowded areas on the lot as trick.
"Travis, could you move your hand, mate?" Harry grit out, still not looking at them and Travis looked confused but sat back all the same, though he did throw an angry look Harry's way. As if he was disturbing his night.
harry: yeah i know i should’ve asked but you were sleeping and i didn’t want to wake you up but it felt wrong lying to them so i just did it
“Why was he in such a rush?” Neville said as he looked after Harry. “And why is he going to the forbidden section?”
draco: WELL WHATEVER REPUTATION U HAD WAS RUINED WHEN U STARTED HANGING OUT WITH A BUNCH OF EX DEATH EATERS
neville: yeah i saw that at breakfast... shouldn’t draco be trying to get on professor lupin’s good side???
“Shit indeed.” Pansy shoved one more bit of jam covered toast into her mouth and wiped her hands off on her stockings.
“I gotta be honest with you Potter.” He started, and Harry looked up to him with tears in his eyes. “I’m not too good at feelings. I never really talked to anyone about them growing up.” Draco gave Harry a pathetic smile.
He wonders if Harry will cry like he did the first time. He wonders if Mother will, though he doubts it. His father was the more vocal of the two.
"I suppose I'll be off," Draco says with an extremely put-upon sigh. He waves his wand in the air as he stands, separating the stacks into his work and Harry's work and charming his to follow him as he walks out and towards his office. "Thank you, Auror Amin. See you at lunch, Potter."
"But you," he continues as if Draco hadn't said anything and the blonde wonders if the other man has seriously lost his mind, "You're brilliant. You have opinions about the world and you're great at your job and you take care of all the juniors."
Harry whined as he felt his sore cheeks being spread apart as a large, well-lubricated toy found its way into his unprepared hole.
Making sure Harry is most definitely okay comes first, and he grabs his husband's hands before leading them out of the lobby and into the floo to visit St. Mungos. Better safe than sorry.
Draco stopped putting a glamour on his ring. No one really noticed much of a difference. It was a traditional Malfoy wedding band so those who did notice, thought it was from his late father. They sent looks, but nothing more.
"Yeah," Harry agreed, back to staring at Malfoy in a way that was starting to make the blond blush to the tips of his ears. "Me too."
"Will my husband be paying for it?" Draco said with a look of genuine concern that made Harry snort out a laugh.
Harry told everyone that he and Mallory broke up. She was tired of the distance and she thought he threw himself in to danger too often. It took him all night to come up with that excuse and even so, it was mostly just something Malfoy had said to him when they were stuffed into a secret corridor wrapped in blankets and studying, just before they had started dating.
Harry shouldn't have been surprised a few hours later when he was speaking to the blonde and he narrowed his eyes at him and spoke as if he had been listening in all morning.
