No one was smiling by the time they reached the second floor corridor. The four peered around the corner as Professor McGonagall stood before a wall dripping red, addressing the congregated staff.
With her hands on her hips and a look of fond, exasperated concern on her face, she said, “I think we may need to have a talk, young man.”
“What? What for?”
“Centaur,” Draco breathed by his side.
A sharp bark of laughter was his reply, before Blaise shook his head with a significant look at Draco and Harry’s locked fingers. “I’ll leave you two to chat. Make no mistake, Harry, you and I will be having words later – but I’ve got something I’d better see to myself, and somehow I don’t think Draco’s going to be any help.”
“So,” Pansy said eventually, drawing the word out a few syllables. “That was fun.”
Harry took a quiet breath, and allowed Dumbledore to lead him away.
“Hey,
“He’s an oaf.” Pansy rolled her eyes. “Oafs make mistakes.”
“They are,” Harry told her. “But I’m not certain they’ll be very happy if they see you.”
Harry blushed. He hoped the flush from the match disguised it. “Thanks, Millicent. Ecklehurt was really good, too.”
“Hadrian Potter!” the elf squeaked, leaping off the bed. “Such an honour it is!”
“Making sure you don’t get yourself killed!” Draco snapped in return. “Honestly, a dragon! You have

A break was in order, he decided. Maybe he could pen a letter to Hermione, asking how she dealt with the eye strain of reading considering how often her head was in a book. The thought of squinting at yet another piece of paper made him wince, but at least it wouldn’t be so crowded with tiny lettering. Sighing again, dramatically, Harry dropped his head back to the book, ready to close it and try again later.
“Honestly, we were going to fess up anyway-”
Harry sighed, taking off his glasses to rub at his eyes. He should go to bed. There was no point to what he was doing – he had no ideas, no new information, nothing. Plus, he remembered with a groan, he had Defence first in the morning. Dealing with Lockhart was hard enough on a full night’s sleep; he didn’t know how he’d manage when under-rested.
“The Boy Who Lived?” they finished together.
Harry wasn’t really paying attention, watching Hermione carefully as he was, so he caught the exact moment when she couldn’t take it anymore. She released a quiet, choked sound, and promptly ran away.
Snape’s eyes narrowed. “And where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”
“No, thank you,” said Harry, politely, and promptly turned to look at Draco. “You were saying?”
“Took your time, boys,” she greeted them, jumping to her feet. “Check this out – we’re not standing on rocks.”
“Can you think of no one?”
The next few weeks saw Harry practising with his ability every chance he got. He found that there was very little he couldn’t do if he really concentrated, and he greatly enjoyed sitting in his cupboard and making things fly, or change colour, or even appear out of nothing such as he had done with the candle (which he found he could light with naught but a thought). He even made himself hover several inches above the ground, once, but had passed out soon afterwards from a sudden rush of exhaustion. Still, this was perhaps the first thing in Harry’s short life that made him feel truly happy, and he relished in it.
Harry tilted his head to his left with great difficulty, and was met with yet more grinning Weasleys. The twins, it had to be said, looked remarkably good for having fought a near-invincible spectre of Lord Voldemort, teenage or no. Fred – and Harry was sure it was Fred, now – had one arm wrapped in plaster white resting on his chest, and George’s movements were nearly as slow and pained as Harry’s own, but they were incredibly, unbelievably, alive.
“My name’s Ron,” the boy said, sending Harry a smile before throwing a dirty look at Draco.  “And who are you?”
“What is it?” Quirrell demanded, snapping Harry from his daze. “What do you see?”
Draco was the first to break the silence.
Blaise was not the one to answer this time.
It was the wrong thing to say. Draco’s jaw clenched and his eyes flared with anger.
“Ah, but together, you and I could return your parents to this world, Hadrian.” Voldemort smiled, strange and horrible and full of teeth. “We could bring them back. All I ask is for one thing in return. You see Hadrian, there is no good or evil in this world. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we will do extraordinary things.” His voice was getting desperate. “Just give me the stone!”
Harry might have laughed as he extended a hand to help Draco up from the ground, cobwebs strewn throughout his perfect hair and sticking to the angles of his face, if he hadn’t seen what Draco had fallen into. A clearing had been revealed behind the broken spider webs, and within that, just barely visible when Harry squinted-
Harry had already intended to, but the words made him blush even harder. Compliments were uncommon for him, after all, and though he didn’t want to, Harry cared a lot about attaining his friends’ approval.
“I don’t know how you were allowed custody of Hadrian Potter, when anyone –
voice was surprising enough to call Harry’s attention. Headmaster Dumbledore seemed to materialise out of nowhere into the room, his eyes twinkling.
Draco folded his arms over his chest, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes. “What, are you just going to keep me in here? You know you can’t do that. And I don’t even want to talk to you, you know. This is entirely unfair. I mean, what’s to stop me from just barricading myself in the bathroom if I need to? I bet you didn’t think about that. Although apparently you don’t think about anything these days-”
Harry managed to control his startled jump – but only barely.
Punishment settled, Snape removed a small vial from his robes and handed it to Madam Pomfrey, ignoring her disapproving looks, and swept from the room.
Harry had a whole list of things to say. However, seeing as numbers one through ten were variations of the word “unfair”, and number eleven was “you bastard”, he kept them to himself. He had dealt with worse than this. Vernon Dursley had taught him how to keep his mouth shut and his anger hidden – Harry had not dealt with ten years of the Dursleys’ treatment to give it all up now and get himself expelled.
“Good job everyone!” Gemma was saying from the senior end of the Slytherin table. “Seven years running – we are officially awesome!”
“AND you’d better give me all the details when you get back,” Pansy added, though even she sounded more nervous than excited as her worry caught up with Blaise and Draco’s.
“Hermione did, actually,” Harry told him.
“Miss Weasley,” Madam Pomfrey said, fixing Ginny with a stern, though not unkind, stare. “To your own bed, if you would.”
“Let me guess,” Harry smiled. “Your idea?”
“Uh, hiya Hadrian,” Longbottom shifted uncomfortably. It seemed he didn’t know how to speak to the Boy-Who-Lived after they’d battled a troll together. For once, Harry didn’t blame him for it.
I know I only mentioned this briefly in the chapter, but if anyone is interested, my ideas on wand usage vs. wandless magic are basically that a wand allows for better refinement of a spell – makes it easier to control how strong the spell will end up, where it hits, etc. (e.g., a bombarda cast at a cup with a wand by a reasonably talented wizard channelling a small amount of force can be used to explode just that cup, but the same spell cast wandlessly with the same intended amount of force by the same wizard has a much higher chance of exploding not just the cup but the table it’s sitting on too). The reason young witches and wizards have better chances of successfully using wandless spells before they are educated with a wand is because their magic is still running almost entirely on instinct and imagination – as you age it becomes more difficult to access that imagination and that instinctive link to your magic, so wandless magic becomes harder and casting spells becomes more academic / intellectual than it is instinctive. It is possible for a grown wizard to learn to cast wandlessly after being trained with a wand, but it requires a very strong force of will to direct the spell and channel the correct strength into it, and most wand-trained wizards just don’t bother because generally the main advantage of casting wandlessly is in battle – something they don’t expect to be engaging in very often, if at all. Wand usage isn’t universal in the wizarding world, however – various cultures around the world don’t use wands to cast and grown adults trained this way have no difficulty. The difference there is that the spells created in wand-using cultures are designed for use with a wand – they require a certain amount of specificity and refinement that generally relies on a wand being used as a channelling tool. Wandless culture spells are not created with wands in mind, and so require less specificity and focus / rely more on intent within the caster. Both have advantages and disadvantages, neither is ‘better’, they’re just different. I imagine that generally wanded spells are more useful for delicate work, while wandless spells have more power behind them so can have a bigger impact because they aren’t designed to need to pass through a channel - there is no instrument in the way of the magic and the target. This doesn’t mean wandless spells can’t be used delicately and wanded spells can’t be insanely powerful, it’s just a little more difficult. None of this is really relevant to the story, I just like thinking about it. Ok that’s enough of me nerding out! I have no idea if JKR wrote anything on the subject and if I’m contradicting her at all, and frankly I don’t give a shit lmao.
“Clever,” Blaise commented from below.
“I’m not?” Harry asked. He couldn’t quite believe it.
“By the way, Hermione,” he gave her a slow smirk. “How do you feel about Neville Longbottom?”
Harry looked up at Draco’s quiet voice. The other boy was standing by the bed, looking more vulnerable than Harry had ever seen him.
Aside from the letter from Draco, the other two were penned with a different hand. Even without deductive reasoning, the style of lettering was too stunningly perfect to be by anyone other than Narcissa Malfoy. One was addressed to him, and the other, to Harry’s utter shock, bore the name Petunia Dursley. Harry couldn’t imagine what Narcissa would care to say to Petunia, given the plain disdain he knew she held for his aunt. Likewise, he couldn’t imagine what would possess Aunt Petunia to read such a letter – although on second thoughts, Narcissa
Harry threw his self-preservation to the wind and leaned into the book.
“So, Hadrian,” Millicent began. “Detention four days into the year. Is that some kind of record?”
“You were angry, and your magic reacted accordingly,” Gemma explained. “It’s not too uncommon, but it was pretty impressive. You made everything in the Common Room shake, and then it was like an earthquake ran through the dungeons. Everything was floating, and you seemed really- well, out of it, honestly. And then you passed out.”
Hedwig hooted joyfully as she soared into his room, dropping her cargo onto his bed before landing atop the rickety chair in the corner. Her cage with her usual perch had been left behind at Malfoy Manor, but she made do. Harry couldn’t hold back his wide smile.
“Oh?” Narcissa’s tone was mild, but her gaze could turn a man to stone.
Harry frowned after her. “She looked upset.”
“Or to going into the Chamber in the first place,” Blaise agreed.
Draco began to shake at Harry’s side. Fang whimpered louder as the moss began to detach from the tree trunks, curling outwards like sets of long, dark legs.
Blaise smiled humourlessly. “You’d know if it was a threat.”
The group reconvened in the library first thing the next morning, though this time with the addition of Blaise.
Harry glanced nervously over one shoulder. “Guys, we can explain everything to each other later, right now we need to
“For the fifth time in a row?”
The statement was genuine. Harry had never had anyone care if he put himself at risk before – he knew his friends cared about him, and he knew Draco worried, but he couldn’t wrap his head around why Draco would have such an extreme reaction when, in the end, nothing bad had come of his admittedly reckless action.
“You know our friends were Petrified right?” Pansy interrupted, disgusted.
“Yeah, it was the
that it could cause hatred of even an innocent.)
“I… I remember having a disagreement with Draco and the others,” Harry said, working through his memory. “I wasn’t very pleased. And then…” he scowled in annoyance. “Nothing.”
Harry hit the grass with a thud and clutched at his injured arm. It felt more shattered than just broken, but that wasn’t even the biggest problem, because the Bludger was still coming for him. Harry rolled over as the Bludger hit the ground like a sledge hammer behind him, getting ready to dodge again before a voice called out:
“Very well, then. Hurry along.”
“But you could have gotten caught, it must be after curfew by now!”
Harry grinned back at her. “It’s fine. No, I didn’t kill anyone, not really. But, when I touched Quirrell, his skin got all burned and kind of crumbled, it was pretty cool!”
“What’re you doing here?” Hagrid seemed even more upset at the newcomer. “Get out of my house!”
Draco grimaced, but it was Daphne Greengrass who responded, with a flip of her hair and a condescending tone.
“Very,” Harry said genuinely, and Draco’s eyes softened.
He considered retrieving another piece of paper after messing up his name (no one called him Hadrian – the Dursleys called him ‘boy’ or ‘freak’ and his teachers called him ‘Harry’ in a feeble attempt at kindness through a nickname), but ultimately thought it too much of a risk. So, Harry folded his letter as neatly as he could, and placed it carefully under his bed. He would work out the whole ‘owl’ business tomorrow he decided, and, quite satisfied, settled down to sleep.
“I knew yer parents, ‘adrian!” Hagrid was saying. Harry shook off his memories. This wasn’t the time, after all. “Great people, Lily and James Potter. Great people.” Hagrid pulled a grimy pink handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his eyes with it roughly. “Yers too, Neville. Lost a lo’ of great people back then. Bu’ anyway! Wha’ can I do for you three?”
Myrtle rolled over in the window sill, smiling down at him. Her large round glasses defied gravity as easily as she did. “Okay! Come back soon, will you? You’re awfully nice, you know.”
of June, 1991, to the sound of his aunt’s shrill voice piercing through the door of his cupboard. This was normal.
Marcus Flint sneered at the Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood as they faced off. Their compulsory handshake seemed to be more of a show of strength between the two captains, and Harry noted Wood’s wince.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, worriedly. “Do you want to check in with Madam Pomfrey before we leave?”
“Pureblood families were never meant to be happy,” Millicent said with a humourless smile.
“If you wait out here, Lady Malfoy, I can get my things from inside,” Harry suggested. It was an optimistic thought (Uncle Vernon was unlikely to allow him to do any such thing), but standing at the doorway of the only place before Hogwarts he could ever have called home, Harry found himself desperate to keep Narcissa from going inside. The Dursleys were his secret. They were his shame to bear. Someone like Narcissa Malfoy did not belong in Number 4, Privet Drive.
Harry stared right on back, until Blaise said, “I think it’s time we had our chat, Potter.”
“Who would want to be friends with
Draco and Blaise came up behind him seconds later, both beyond confused.
“What’s a mudblood?”
“It was just a question, Tracey.”
Tom was silent for a moment, eyes trained on the floor, before he raised them with a considering tilt to his head. “Sir? If it all stopped- If the person responsible was caught…”
“Yeah, Draco?”
A creaking, grinding, rock-on-rock, before Harry opened his eyes to see a narrow, winding set of stairs had emerged from the smooth sides of the pipe.
From beneath them:
Harry turned instead of answering. He didn’t believe in fear of a name.
A massive, languid shape lay ahead of them.
“Hello there, Firenze,” Hagrid said finally, nodding his head at the centaur. “I see you’ve met our young Mr Potter. You alright there, ‘arry?”
Gemma Farley approached the trio on brisk feet, her wild dark curls held back from her face in a sensible (though of course still fashionable) updo. Gemma had graduated at the end of the previous year, and while Harry knew she had accepted an internship offer in the Ministry of Magical Law Enforcement, he hadn’t know that she would be starting so soon.
“Potter-”
“Hello there, Hadrian,” they replied in unison.
Harry spent much of the early game flying high over the pitch, scanning the air below for the tell-tale flash of gold that signalled the Snitch.
“Hearts!”
“Or rather, Ginny bumped into him-”
Harry promptly flopped back down. The mattress groaned and took revenge via a loose spring stabbing into his shoulder.
Harry looked at him, but tried to keep the curiosity off of his face. Theodore’s voice sounded rough and unused – as though he rarely used it. Harry himself didn’t like to speak often, but he’d never had his voice run out on him as it sounded Theodore’s had.
“…I suppose. But what are we going to do?”
Dumbledore smiled congenially at the trio. “Hello, Narcissa.”
Harry looked up at him cautiously as his memory returned. “Did I… kill Professor Quirrell? Or Voldemort?”
Harry thought this, and then wrote: ‘Anger = tingling = glass disappears.’
In this way, Harry passed his days until Christmas morning. Despite knowing, logically, that he did have friends who would send him gifts, Harry was still shocked by the large pile of presents he found at the foot of his bed when he woke up on Christmas day. He dressed faster than light and settled down to see what his friends had gotten him.
“Are you going to make me, Weasley?” Draco sneered arrogantly.
“She has plenty of brothers doesn’t she? Maybe she got someone to do it for her, for privacy.”
“The basilisk,” Pansy breathed.
“Thanks,” Harry muttered.
“Still, Colin’s just a first year-”
“No,” both Blaise and Draco said immediately.
Draco gasped in alarm. “Don’t say his name!”
“No one you need to worry about, Granger,” smirked Pansy. “Not with the way Daph looks at him.”
Nonetheless, Harry was thrilled to be meeting up with his Slytherin peers. As much as he enjoyed Draco’s company, he had still missed his other friends. Narcissa was unable to join them, though she left Dilly with strict instructions to make sure the children bought all their school equipment, rather than getting distracted by things like “that shiny new broom.” That had sent Draco into a tangent, of course, about the improvements of the Nimbus 2001 from the previous year’s model. Harry quite liked his Nimbus 2000, and didn’t see the point in buying a new broom when his current one worked just fine – but that didn’t mean he couldn’t admire its statistics.
“Tom Riddle,” Harry answered for him. Tom’s edges blurred as he turned to smile cruelly at Harry.
All Quidditch try out info is taken from the internet, as are most of the players' names.
Harry found himself laughing, and promptly regretted it as his ribs gave an unhappy throb. “Yes,” he told them honestly. “Aren’t those curtains supposed to have privacy charms on them?”
Then he ushered them out of the hut, and shut the door behind them.
“Hey, Hadrian.”
Harry nodded his acquiescence, and when it became clear that Vernon had nothing else to say, turned back to his preparation. To the outside world, Harry was as passive as usual, but inside his mind was racing. Harry was rarely allowed out of the house – only for school, gardening, or to be left at Mrs Figg’s house when the Dursleys were going away – and for Vernon to let him out on Dudley’s birthday was highly unusual. Petunia and Vernon were taking Dudley to the zoo with Dudley’s friend Piers Polkiss, and Harry was
Another reason – the most important, according to Hermione and Tracey – was that the teachers seemed to have all realised at once just how close they were to Christmas break. Therefore, every teacher in the school started piling on ridiculous amounts of homework all at the same time. Harry, Millicent, and Pansy took to sitting together in the Common Room so they could moan about the workload to each other while Blaise watched them amusedly and Tracey told them to shut it so she could work.
“We thought you were hurt – or, or killed!” Neville told them shakily.
Harry sighed. “It was saying it wanted to kill.”
“But, that doesn’t explain what the- the voice was,” Neville interrupted. “I mean, what was it you heard, Harry?”
We are introduced to our protagonist, and Harry makes a discovery.
Harry pushed himself onto the opposite desk as elegantly as he could (considering his below-average height), and waited. He was not kept waiting long.
Draco and Blaise exchanged a look.
“Fred, George,” Harry breathed. He just barely managed to keep from saying,
“That is what I said, isn’t it?” Draco was beginning to flush. “You’re my friend, you git.”
Snape’s upper lip curled into a snarl, but he wasn’t done. “What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?”
“Neville?” Harry leant over the hole. “Are you alright? What’s down there?”
Draco glared at her viciously. “You don’t know anything about my parents,” he growled, before promptly storming out of the library without another word.
Immediately, Harry upturned the pot and grabbed the closest quill. Dipping it into the little remaining ink, he wrote the first thing he thought of at the top of the now clear page:
“Ah, Harry!” Gilderoy Lockhart – pardon,
“One-”
The giant cake was met with cheers, and then laughter as the slightly shaky lettering became clear:
At the same time, Dudley Dursley was complaining (rather loudly) about his lack of an adequate amount of gifts in front of a pile of thirty-six neatly wrapped presents. This was not
Gemma didn’t look pleased at being interrupted, but seemed to take being absolved of rule-breaking as the more important action. She nodded again.
hand-me-downs-”
And then Dudley was screaming behind the reappeared glass of the enclosure, and Petunia was shrieking, and Vernon’s face was fast turning purple as his beady eyes locked with Harry’s, and Harry felt the stirrings of fear begin in his stomach.
But Christmas break came, as it must, and Harry found himself facing a whole new dilemma. For the first time since coming to Hogwarts, he would be without his friends. He liked being alone, sure – but there was a big difference between choosing solitude and having it forced upon you.
Draco didn’t stop glaring at him. “What if you get yourself hurt? Or expelled, or killed? And I’m not there?”
So could Narcissa, it seemed. She conceded defeat with a slight incline of her head, yet when she looked at Harry there was a vicious promise in her eyes. She dropped gracefully to her knees in front of Harry, just as she had that morning.
The physicality of it was nothing, however, compared to the feeling he got when he lifted his head and realised, with sinking stomach, that the pile of rocks had landed squarely, wall to wall, between him and the way out of the Chamber. He was trapped.
Harry wasn’t amused anymore. Something cold and furious licked through his veins as he took a step forward; two; three, until he was standing toe to toe with Weasley. Blaise and Draco at his sides and the other Slytherins at his back registered to his brain only vaguely as he slid his wand from the holster on his forearm and pressed it under the Gryffindor’s chin. Weasley stared back at him, defiantly. Harry wanted to break that look into a thousand tiny pieces.
“Well, she’s a total know-it-all,” Millicent commented from the floor, where she was petting her cat, Sabre.
“Who’s there?” Hagrid asked into the night. He held a crossbow drawn and aimed almost exactly at where Harry and Draco stood beneath the cloak.
What is WRONG with you two?”
he rationalised. The important thing was that his friends accepted him as he was, Neville and Hermione included. Even Gemma had told him in a mock-whisper in the Common Room that this just meant he was a badass, and Adrian had seemed- well. He had asked if Harry
Harry, rather maturely, poked out his tongue.
Narcissa’s smile dropped as soon as the disapparation
the Hat greeted him.
After spending the first ten minutes talking about his five consecutive wins of
The door opened mere seconds later to the giant of a man Harry remembered from his first day at Hogwarts – the one who had directed him and the other first years into the boats that would carry them to their new home.
“Honestly, the lack of decorum,” Daphne had huffed. “Your father is going to be furious.”
Harry froze. He spun on one foot, but there was no one there – he was alone.
Harry looked over. The woman talking was tall and slender, with sleek platinum blonde hair and fair skin. She was beautiful – and the spitting image of Draco.
“Oh yeah, there’s a troll in the dungeons, let’s just send the Slytherins back to their Common Room – in the dungeons!” Millicent said, sarcastically – though she couldn’t quite wipe the fear from her face.
Harry winced at the stutter in her voice, and pulled away from Draco to see her, but Gemma wasn’t having any of it.
“Someone’s innermost secrets?”
Then the twins’ words caught up to him, and he did a (very tender) double take. “Wait a second, ‘Snake Slayer’?”
“Hey, Harry,” Draco said, softly.
Harry squinted. “Huh. How do we open it?”
” whispered Draco next to him, voice and body shaking, and suddenly Harry could see where his confusion had come from in his near-death daze.
“Onwards and upwards,” he echoed, and led the way.
“Well,” Hermione huffed. “There’s one easy way to find out. Hold the book open, Harry.” She pulled out her wand, and tapped the open diary three times. “
“Is that his autobiography?” Draco asked with a grimace. “
“Be warned, students,” Lockhart began, with the sort of voice Harry could imagine on one of Petunia’s game shows. “It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.” He turned, and with a flick of his wand, levitated a cage from behind his desk to the centre of the room. “I must ask you not to scream,” he warned gleefully. “It might provoke them.”
“Exactly!” Harry replied enthusiastically. “Aragog even hinted at it – he said the girl fifty years ago was killed in a bathroom.”
“No,” called back Probably-Fred.
Harry nearly rolled his eyes at the lack of subtlety, but apparently Hagrid didn’t notice.
“It was after that incident at Flourish and Blotts, when Lockhart was being an ass-”
It took very little time in the Forbidden Forest for Harry to start regretting his boldness in stepping into it. The Forest was pitch black outside the tiny circle of light from the lantern, and the further they walked the closer the trees seemed to get, denser and damper and more depressing with each fumbled step through the brush. The Forest felt like it was suffocating them, shadowy figures behind every branch, and Harry was increasingly glad he was not alone.
Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing, Filch’s cat is attacked. And that first year Gryffindor Creevey’s been annoying Potter for weeks. Then Creevey’s attacked.”
“My name’s Malfoy; Draco Malfoy,” the boy said, sticking out a hand.
“I didn’t say she performed the spell!”
“Codswallop. Besides, tha’ item is strictly between Dumbledore an’ Nicholas Flamel.”
“Harry!” Draco launched into a hug. “Merlin, you had me worried sick. Are you okay? What happened? Where were you? Where’s-”
Harry studied the two professors as they walked, Neville a ball of anxious silence fidgeting at his side. With each part of the professors’ demeanour catalogued in his mind (Snape’s tenseness and lack of scornful looks, Flitwick’s uncharacteristic silence and bowed shoulders), the ball in the pit of Harry’s stomach got denser. Something was wrong, that much was clear. Whatever it was damaged both Ravenclaw and Slytherin, and was bad enough to have Snape of all people feeling on edge.
“Come, Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey brought his attention back to her – and, more importantly, the slightly bitter smelling potion in her hand. “This will make you feel much better.”
the harsh voice interrupted.
biased towards Slytherin). Overall, he thought they all sounded like fine places. Harry liked the thought of being loyal like a Hufflepuff, courageous like a Gryffindor, witty like a Ravenclaw, and cunning like a Slytherin – he wanted to be all of them at once.
“Harry! Come look!” Draco tugged on his arm until Harry looked up from his Potions textbook. Two weeks into the term and Snape was already giving them full essays as homework – how was that even allowed?
“It’s so good to see you, girl,” he told her, stroking the soft feathers of her head affectionately. Hedwig preened under the attention for a moment, before haughtily dismissing him in favour of cleaning under one wing.
“Yeah,” said Draco, rather faintly as he took a significant step back from the edge of the hole.
The solemn tone was of course, disrupted when Gilderoy Lockhart entered the scene.
Then, to top off a truly enlightening first class, he introduced them to their first creature of the year.
. Why?”
Draco had his head in his hands. “No survival instincts…”
“You know my mother is the Editor for Witch Weekly,
“But-”
A muffled, “Don’t call me that” was their only response, but it seemed to be enough for the twins.
Harry made a beeline for his target. The key was slower, given one of its wings was twisted and broken, but other keys zipped in front of his vision every second, distractions and obstacles in one. Harry took a breath, flipped his broom upside down and snatched at the damaged key. That seemed to be the signal for the rest, as the moment his fingers touched the metal the rest of the keys turned to attack.
, Zabini. At least, not by name.”
“That’s no dead-end, Hadrian.”
“Hagrid, the dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.”
“You’re okay,” Harry breathed. “You’re alive.”
“Until Ginny told us where she thought she’d picked it up.”
Harry cocked his head. “Are you alright, Draco? You look flushed.”
there’s a difference! Legends are just distorted parts of history, myths are completely made up.”
He said the name like it was the worst insult one could receive, and Ron scowled at him in response.
Harry stood up from the table as calmly as he could. They wouldn’t let the Slytherins walk into danger, right? The troll had to be on the other side of the dungeons. The troll. That was in the school. That Harry was about to walk towards.
Their action proved unnecessary.
“That little performance! Did you see the doe eyes she gave you when you said you’d come back? She adores you.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m with Greengrass on this one,” Hermione grimaced.
Harry didn’t bother pointing out the flaw in Draco’s threat being that Draco obviously didn’t want him hurt, because he was too busy flying the high of realising, properly, fully, for the first time since meeting his friends, just how much he was cared for. He tugged Draco closer until the other boy sat down again.
Hermione did not look at all pleased to be referred to simply as ‘Harry’s friend’, and was opening her mouth to say so, when the most unlikely of saviours came upon them.
Slowly, Harry re-closed the door and locked it as quietly as he could.
“What are you, a Gryffindor?”
Gemma led Harry and the Malfoys a small way away from the courtroom, down one of the narrower hallways on the tenth floor.
Two updates into two days - because I love you all.
“I know that,” Blaise nodded. “You know that. Draco knows that. Merlin, even Granger here knows that, given her parentage,” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him for that comment, “But it’s still a touchy subject.”
weeks in his cupboard with minimal food, Harry sat on his cot beneath the stairs and turned the memory over and over in his head. He had no paper or pen with which to write, so he put his thoughts in the dust on his broken desk instead.
“That we have, Fred, that we have.”
All four of them peered at it. Harry glanced at Blaise in concern.
“What is it, Fang?” Harry asked over the sound of Draco’s grumbling.
“Your grandmother says a lot of things, Longbottom,” Blaise replied. “I don’t suggest you listen to all of them.”
, right?”
There were howls of barely stifled laughter coming from behind the curtains on Harry’s left. Harry ignored them.
Harry was silent. It was that almost whispered statement that hit him, really.
Harry raised a brow. “Our next lesson isn’t until next Friday.”
Harry pulled his wand out of his sleeve frantically, hands shaking as he struggled to remember any spells that might help them, but all he could think of were the hexes Millicent and Theodore had been teaching him, they wouldn’t do jack against a damn
“Is it Longbottom’s?” Pansy wrinkled her nose. “If it is, I wouldn’t touch it.”
“Treat him well,” McGonagall said sternly, fixing both boys with a stare one at a time. “I’ll be seeing you at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter.”
, and Harry realised with a start that around him sat the portraits of every past Headmaster Hogwarts had ever had.
but none of us are qualified to take down any monster, let alone one that once belonged to Salazar Slytherin himself.”
Harry cleaned the cauldrons he was ordered to (by hand, of course), and very determinedly did
Unfortunately, the reprieve was a brief one. By the time Harry and the other students of Slytherin House had been led down into the dungeons, introduced to the lavishly decorated Slytherin Common Room, and given a speech on Slytherin House rules by a fierce sixth year prefect named Gemma Farley (keep all squabbles inside the dungeons; don’t take the blame for anything; and don’t ever,
, by the way, seem to be missing. Besides-”
The morning brought solemn news.
Draco laughed, looking impressed and vaguely shocked. He picked up the abandoned wand and slid it inside one pocket. “Looks like those Duelling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.”
“Yeah. I just- I’ve read about Mandrakes, I’ve never-” He cut himself off, shaking his head. “I’m alright.”
Hermione bit her lip, but spoke with confidence. “Harry was my first friend here. He’s never judged me. I’ll go with him.”
“What’s got their panties in a twist?” Blaise asked.
“Look, Draco cares about you, alright? We all do.”
“You’re joking.” Even Blaise looked shocked. “Is he even qualified?”
The rest of her sentence went unspoken:
The Underground Chambers, and Voldemort.
a good idea,” interrupted Millicent, who had gone a bit green at the mention of giant spiders. “There’s a curfew. There’s no way you’ll get out of the common room, let alone out to that shack on the edge of the grounds.”
“W-what do you mean?”
Harry shrugged. “Alright.”
“Is it Norbert?” Hermione asked sympathetically.
“Oh how I’ve missed your impeccable manners, Millicent,” Daphne rolled her eyes. “This is my sister, Astoria. She’s going to be a firstie at Hogwarts this year, so she’ll be staying with us until she settles in. Though
The metal flap on his door pushed open, snapping Harry out of his hyperventilation. A bowl of tinned soup slid through, followed by a small piece of bread Harry could already tell was stale.
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “It seems there has been a misunderstanding. Young Harry’s home is here, with his family, and to remove him from that space would be a dreadful strain on the boy. You may return to your son, Narcissa. I will see that Harry and his relatives’ are properly reunited.”
McGonagall turned back to the staff. “The rest of us should go and inform the students as to what has happened.”
Blaise was looking around. “I think we’re on the third floor.”
Harry snorted. “Have you seen how he treats me in class?”
, and if there was anything the Dursleys hated, it was things that were
“You fixed your glasses.”
Harry's Christmas Break.
Hermione and Neville both agreed to visit Hagrid with him, and that night after dinner the three of them marched down to the groundskeeper’s hut.
“Erm…” Harry glanced nervously back up the stairs.
“A fairytale,” Harry said quickly. “We found a fairytale about a Cerberus in the library the other day. Honestly, they seem like fascinating creatures.” He smiled, innocent as could be.
Red and orange danced in his vision, and he wanted to tell the Weasleys to back off, to let him die in peace – but, were those feathers?
“Even more of an ass than usual, that is-”
He was so caught up thinking about all the ways he’d rather die than by basilisk that he didn’t notice that the twins had stopped until they caught him by each shoulder, seconds before he knocked his face into-
The Great Hall erupted into screams as Quirrell’s turbaned head hit the floor. Draco let out a squeak from Harry’s left, and across from him Pansy looked like she was going to cry. On his right, Blaise was cursing in a language Harry didn’t recognise.
After a sound lecture on why twelve year olds should
“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked her, almost scared to open the parchment. This was what Hermione had found in the library. This was what she had been looking for.
Hagrid squinted. “What?”
“Oh, Merlin, Harry, you’re going to regret that.”
Harry held out the letter. Petunia looked at it, but did not reach out.
“H-Hey, Harry!” Neville gave him a smile. Harry chose to ignore the way the Gryffindor’s eyes flickered nervously behind him to Draco’s sullen form.
“Is that a
“Not that that isn’t scary, but aren’t any of you confused? What on Earth is the ‘Chamber of Secrets’?”
“You two will be in charge of making sure Mr. Potter here gets his luggage on the train and such,” McGonagall said. “I must be getting to Hogwarts.”
“What’s going on?” Hermione sniffed, moving towards the sinks. “Why are you two down here?”
“Erm- hi, ‘arry, ‘ermione, Neville.”
as soon as he heard the name – the Minister of Magic had had many features in Harry’s time at Hogwarts.
Harry thought he saw Draco’s face twist in annoyance for a second, but he was too busy grinning to analyse it. “Seriously? So it’s us three then, yeah?”
Harry started to grin. “Sure.”
“You know Firenze?” the centaur closest to Harry asked, disgust evident in her voice.
“Ask,” Harry ground out.
“Good alliteration, Sally Slythers would have loved it. Well-”
“We have a brother in Romania, see-”
Tom Riddle came to a stop outside an innocuous room in the dungeons. The door was opened slightly, and a voice carried through:
“So, Hadrian,” Millicent interrupted before Harry could ask anything, flopping across his legs. “We heard you killed Professor Quirrell.”
“You have to know I’m not just going to hand it over, right?” he said, conversationally.
Harry thought back,
“Great,” said Draco, loudly, giving Harry a look. “More Weasleys.”
The stone responded as it had to Harry. Slytherin’s mouth lowered, slowly, awfully, violently. Harry caught a glimpse of huge, glimmering scales before he was spinning on his heel with a shout.
“We are no use to anyone if we are dead, Potter,” Blaise said through gritted teeth. “Maybe,
The Gryffindor reached forward, but Harry pulled his hand (and the ball) just out of reach.
“Are you kidding me?” Daphne rolled her eyes. “And no one else noticed?”
“Hadrian?”
Harry frowned. “Pardon?”
Draco scoffed. “’Nice’, sure.” He was silent for a moment, before asking, rather more nervously, “Harry? Do you think Hagrid trained Fang to fight? You know… Just in case?”
Harry wasn’t overly surprised by the lack of visitors, either – he had noticed Longbottom sitting alone at the Gryffindor table, and he had already guessed that Weasley had badgered Draco for the remembrall simply for the sake of starting a fight rather than for any sense of loyalty.
Harry looked up into the stands and squinted. Sure enough, sitting next to Snape were the pristine forms of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Narcissa may have smiled down at them, but at that distance Harry couldn’t really tell. He would bet his brand new broom that Lucius was glaring at him, though.
“But if you didn’t kill the girl fifty years ago, what did?” Harry demanded, looking up at the creature.
Harry thought hazily through the Mandrake’s scream piercing through his earmuffs. The sound was familiar – it seemed the twins had managed to replicate the creature's screech for the Opening Feast prank, if with less dangerous consequences.
Harry settled in quite nicely at Hogwarts. The first few days passed in a blur – between lounging in the Common Room with Draco and the other first years, reading as much as he could about his whole new selection of subjects, and going to all of his classes, Harry was never bored – and never alone.
magazine and thus was a central part of the gossiping scene.
“Hello, Myrtle.”
“I don’t care.”
“’Oh’, indeed,” Professor McGonagall answered with perhaps the barest hint of a smile. “May I come in?”
“Because he’s going to be our teacher,” said Theodore.
Harry wanted to scream. He wanted to wring the little creature’s neck and snatch the letters from his hands. But that would get him nowhere. No - he needed to be smart.
“Is that even a question?” he returned.
“Oh yes, sir, Dobby understands,” Dobby interrupted him quickly. “It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you… Well, it is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin.”
Draco turned up his nose at the praise, but thankfully didn’t comment.
“Without
“Give it here, Malfoy.”
Five minutes later, nothing had happened, and Harry was getting impatient. He might have given up had he not had the idea that perhaps he must be more specific, and so rather than focusing on light, he instead focused on the idea of a candle.
Hermione shook her head. “Even in the Wizarding World, Harry, hearing voices isn’t a good sign.”
“But you’d be so good!” Draco whined. “Come on, just come to try-outs with me, Harry. Please?”
“Neville used
They had no time to dwell on the fast-paced events, however, because the force of Lockhart’s body hitting the rock of the Chamber wall had started an avalanche from above. The whole passageway seemed to shake and shudder before, with a deafening
“For you-”
Out loud, he simply said, “Thank you,” and left it at that.
If she had been pale before, Petunia became as white as the paper she held now in one death grip claw. Her other hand shot to support herself upon the kitchen bench as she swayed dangerously in one spot. Her eyes flicked wildly down the single page, and she let out a single sound best described as a squeak.
“Don’t call me Millie!”
Even if Harry hadn’t taken to watching the door as the minutes ticked away, it would be impossible not to notice when the man of the hour arrived. The heavy wooden doors of the courtroom opened with a thud, and Lucius Malfoy stalked forth with curses in his eyes. He was escorted by a sombre looking auror on either side, and a soft golden light encircled his wrists. The light was no metal chain, but Harry thought it looked just as confining.
a highly influential Ministry member. The rules don’t apply to him,” said Daphne, flicking her hair behind one shoulder. “Congratulations by the way, Potter.”
Hermione frowned. “It’s nearly curfew, Harry.”
“Down,” Hermione nodded firmly.
“We are friends. We’re not leaving you. A panic attack is nothing to be ashamed of.”
Harry raised one eyebrow as politely as he could, and waited.
“Maybe he’s making more rock cakes,” said Neville, gloomily.
“A dead-end,” Harry said, dumbly.
Lockhart scoffed. “Pranks? No, they’ve been attacking me! I tried to get Dumbledore to listen, but no, the old man wouldn’t pay attention to me – I mean really, hasn’t he read my books? If he’d listened to me he would still be here, that’s for certain-”
The general Gryffindor opinion of him wasn’t a surprise, so Harry shrugged it off easily.
“No, no, it’s okay!” Neville said quickly, snapping his eyes open. “Just, keep still, you’ll fall right through. It’s like, uh, playing dead, you know?”
Harry laughed. “That I
The Great Hall that night was one of the most beautiful things Harry had ever seen. Floating Jack-o-Lanterns hovered above the House tables, and tiny black bats flapped their way between students and teachers alike. The charmed ceiling portrayed a clear black sky filled with tiny glittering stars. The ghosts were particularly active as well (due to the excess magical energy charging the world on Samhain, Tracey informed him matter-of-factly), and their usual silvery glow seemed shining against the warm light of the hundreds of suspended candles. Even Peeves, the Hogwarts poltergeist, was on his best behaviour for the evening (though from the way his translucent fingers were twitching, Harry guessed that wouldn’t last long). All in all, Hogwarts on Halloween stole Harry’s breath away. Not for the first time, he marvelled at the feeling of being home.
Hagrid to be fired. He was sweet, in his own way, if a bit too emotional (and a bit too big) for Harry’s comfort. But he didn’t want to start a fight with Draco, either – so he simply changed the subject.
Oh, and I have no idea in what year 'alohomora' is taught at Hogwarts. Stuff like that is made up as I go along.
Unfortunately, there was one thing Harry had forgotten.
“So?”
Hagrid had gone still. “I shouldn’ta told ye tha’.”
“Did you hear that?” Draco whispered.
Hermione was furious when Harry told her about The Incident.
“I will,” Harry told her, patting her on the back. “I promise.”
“Um, you two do remember that this is the same man you saw kept an Acromantula fifty years ago?” Pansy raised a brow.
The tree bark seemed to be moving, the moss seeming to shift and looking almost like hair…
The trio tilted their heads back as one to meet Hagrid’s eyes – and his wide grin.
I mean you’re a hero, the whole school thinks so- I guess, I’m just trying to say, thank you.”
“Oh Merlin, me too,” Draco confessed. “Mother and Father are here.”
“Harry Potter?” she asked, although she knew very well that no other boy in the world had that particularly distinctive scar.
But – seeing how Narcissa had reacted helped, just a little bit. And she had said he would never go back there again. He wouldn’t have to see the Dursleys ever again. He wouldn’t have to deal with Uncle Vernon’s violent anger, or Aunt Petunia’s wilful ignorance, or Dudley’s petty bullying. That wasn’t his life anymore.
“It’s fine, really. It’s done with now, anyway, and so long as I keep out of trouble I should be fine,” Harry told her, resisting the urge to shift uncomfortably. He hadn’t been expecting such a vehement response. In all honesty, he wasn’t sure why she was so angry – nor did he know how to calm her down.
, the vintage edition, and Gemma a small book of defensive magic. He felt rather bad about those ones – they had sent him such thoughtful gifts, and he had simply sent them sweets. Blaise gave him a set of soft leather boots enchanted with silencing charms, while Harry gave him a book of historical insults between famous wizards. Draco’s gift was, if Harry had to choose, his favourite: a handheld mirror, made of gilded silver, through which the user could communicate with the owner of its counterpart. Harry called Draco through it immediately, and he answered just as promptly.
he chastised himself, but could only watch in shock as the Bludger stopped itself mid-air, and spun around to come right back at him.
“His books do seem a little… implausible,” Tracey admitted, still frowning down at her list.
Harry nodded. “I promise. But I need to explain that to my friends so they don’t worry about me, so I need the letters, and I need Hedwig’s cage unlocked.”
Hermione muttered something that sounded remarkably like ‘heartless Slytherins’ under her breath.
. “Down?”
Harry wasn’t wrong. The moment he arrived in Snape’s classroom after dinner that night, the Professor was looming over him with harsh words and an intimidating presence.
“Draco came to find us when he couldn’t find Professor Snape,” Gemma told her. “He said Longbottom had collected Harry from the Great Hall, something to do with you being in danger with the- well, with the troll.”
Fred lifted his good hand and ticked them off on his fingers. “Hero of Hogwarts, Beast Killer-”
Once again, a few bits and pieces were either paraphrased or taken directly from the script of the movie. I'm sure you can recognise them.
Harry stood silently, moving after McGonagall without even fully realising it. Behind him, Filch continued to mutter about dark magic, and evil.
Harry turned and nearly fell as Myrtle rushed towards him, playing with her hair and biting her lip. “If you die down there-”
“Oh my Morgana,” said Daphne. “Moaning Myrtle!”
“He’ll try to kill me,” Harry nodded. “Yeah. Apparently he was pretty keen on trying that last night.”
“Oh, no,” Harry breathed.
“Thank you, sir,” Daphne interrupted with a sickly sweet smile, and before Harry knew it, all of his Slytherin friends – even Theo – were standing between him and Lockhart with various smug looks. “But we can take it from here.”
“Didn’t you say that Slytherin third year – Pucey – was raving about your Quidditch skills as a Seeker all holidays?” She pointed at the broom hovering a few feet away. “You have to get on that, and seek out the right key for the next door. It’s obvious.”
Harry blinked. Lockhart impersonated a fish as Ron’s wand flew from his hand – caught by Ron as it sailed over his head – and the professor was blasted against a wall for the second time that day.
Millicent laughed in delight, and even Harry couldn’t resist a small smile as Lockhart crumpled to the ground.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “So?”
“Alright.”
Harry would have thought so too, only Ron was loitering around the end of Harry’s bed, not his siblings’, when the medi-witch left the room once more in search of more pain relieving potion for a very loudly complaining Weasley twin.
Draco practically glowed. It sounded like a bribe to Harry, but it wasn’t hurting anyone, and if it made Draco happy, then – why ruin that?
,” Pansy Parkinson wrinkled her nose.
” Millicent asked through gritted teeth.
care about their House points.
But Narcissa just tilted her head, raising her eyebrows in an innocently quizzical expression. “Why, it appears there
Pansy glanced at him with an expression of mock-surprise. “Weasley, that might just be the only smart thing to ever have come out of your mouth.”
The bad feeling in the pit of Harry’s stomach got heavier. “What is it?”
Harry would be returning to Hogwarts – of course he would, especially now he knew his friends still cared about him. He’d deal with this ‘plot’ when he had to. For now, he simply held the stack of letters close, and didn’t bother to keep his grin off of his face.
“No idea,” said Myrtle, sighing despondently and floating back towards them. “I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes, right over there.” She pointed towards the great structure of sinks in the centre of the room.
“And?”
Flying with Adrian Pucey, who was a chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team and probable captain once beater Marcus Flint graduated, was very different to flying with Draco and Blaise, Harry found. For one, Adrian was very obviously a much better flier than Harry’s friends – constantly using tricks Harry had never seen before to throw Harry off, and dodging the automatically charmed bludgers with a greater deftness than Harry could even dream of having. Yet when they finally returned to the ground, Gemma cheering from the stands and the snitch in Adrian’s hand, the third year was grinning.
Harry nearly snapped at him, but the large man’s appearance gave him pause. He was covered in snow from the outdoors, and carrying the limp corpse of a rooster.
“It’s just a silly little crush, it won’t do any harm,” Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Who’s Goldstein?” Hermione furrowed her brow.
Fang whined at their feet. Draco’s grip on Harry’s hand tightened – but under the shadows of the trees, Harry couldn’t bring himself to mind.
“Why would you follow me, Draco?” Harry asked, infuriated. “I come back and I tell you everything anyway, you’re being ridiculous!”
Sorry, Neville. Sorry, Hagrid. I actually quite like them both as characters (especially Neville) but the disparaging remarks are necessary for now.
“I think we’re safe,” Draco sighed eventually.
Daphne jumped up from her seat. “Astoria! Where have you been?”
Harry raised a brow, but the other boy was already gone. Harry let him go. He didn’t think Theo would hurt Hermione in any way, and if he did – well, Boy Who Lived or not, Harry wasn’t averse to a little revenge.
“So you’re telling me,” Blaise said after they had finished their tale, “That the Dark Lord of the last great war is hiding in the Forbidden Forest, keeping himself alive with the blood of unicorns, and plotting his return?”
Harry knew for a fact that they hadn’t met. The only haziness in his memory came from the night he had passed out in the Slytherin Common Room, after all, and since he doubted he had met Hagrid then-
“Let go of him, you creep!”
“What – you can’t possibly be thinking of going forward on your own?” Draco called, incredulous.
“Seconded,” Harry replied.
“And he dropped something into her cauldron.”
Oh, Harry. Where is your self-preservation?
Harry could. “Voldemort,” he said. His voice did not shake.
“That’s a smart idea,” Harry said with a smile. “I planned on doing the same.”
“Yeah, maybe not, considering.”
“I will associate with whomever I like,
“Silence!”
“You really think it would be that easy?” replied Blaise, irritated. “Sorry to remind you all,
“Boy! What’s taking so long?” Petunia shrieked from the kitchen, making Harry jump.
“Well,” Fred said frankly, “You saved our sister’s life, and probably ours with that basilisk fang through the diary trick.”
“Are you alright, dear?” Narcissa asked gently.
Harry didn’t deny the statement.
The twins disappeared in a flash of red hair, and Harry found himself sitting alone in a compartment. Thankfully, Harry didn’t mind being alone, and with a small smile he settled himself down to read through his first year Transfiguration text (Professor McGonagall had recommended it, stating that Transfiguration was the most complex subject of the year and he may enjoy it – it had been his father’s best subject, after all).
Tom paused. “No, sir. Nothing.”
Harry nodded, and looked up, locking eyes with each of his friends one by one. “Listen, guys, if anything happens down there…”
“What?” Pansy asked her defensively.
“The forbidden corridor,” Blaise finished. “We shouldn’t be here.”
, or it’ll be the cupboard for you for two weeks, understand?”
Harry gave a half-smile. “I’ll try not to.”
Madam Pomfrey melted like ice cream on a summer’s day.
“Yeah,” Harry assured him, quickly bringing up a smile. “Just thinking.”
Harry woke up on the 23
They winked at him. “We’ll keep that in mind for this year.”
“Oh no.” That was Blaise. He had realised what Harry had.
“So he’ll die, then,” Harry murmured. He didn’t know Flamel, obviously, but he had an appreciation for genius, and anyone who could create the Elixir of Life in stone form had to be a genius.
“The Draught of Living Death, sir.”
The gesture brought him immediate comfort, and he found himself leaning into the touch.
“Can you smell that?” Neville complained.
“Any idea how he’s going to be executing this plan?” Blaise raised an eyebrow.
Harry laughed again, one hand to his ribs. “I won’t do it again, then, I suppose.”
Harry glanced at Draco, shifting uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. He didn’t really like big displays of emotion – especially displays of sadness. That had never gotten Harry anything but more pain. Thankfully, Draco didn’t look particularly pleased with the situation either, though whether it was for Harry’s reason or something else, he didn’t know.
As quickly and quietly as he could, Harry slipped the letter into his cupboard and out of sight, and got on with the rest of his chores – though he thought of little else but that letter, and by the time he was finished he was feeling quite impatient with the whole thing.
Suddenly, the bookshelf behind Neville sneezed.
“But Mrs Norris wasn’t killed, just petrified,” Hermione pointed out.
The prefect shrugged from where she was sprawled over one couch. “I wasn’t going to, but my mum’s visiting her sister, so.”
Harry bit his cheek again to refrain from pestering the professor about what exactly he had missed, but Dumbledore must have read it on his face anyway, and chuckled.
“But if it’s going to help you, Harry-”
This was not entirely unusual, as young Harry
Harry smiled, genuine this time. “Okay.”
“Excellent,” the plump witch gave him a wide smile. “Ten points to Gryffindor.”
“We can deal with the
knock you out for several hours, which is why I have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would put them on for me... Very good. Now, let me demonstrate.”
“Gemma?” Harry blinked. “I didn’t realise you were staying for Christmas.”
“She’s a ghost,” Tracey told him, taking pity. “She haunts the first floor girl’s bathroom –
It didn’t take Harry long to draw the connection between the instances and his emotions – he had been scared during the Harry Hunting before he disappeared, and he had been angry at the zoo before the glass vanished.
Hermione straightened her back. “Of course I am. I have to make sure you don’t get yourself into any more trouble.”
Longbottom swallowed audibly.
“It must be someone else’s, then,” Hermione said. “It’s not really a distinctive book, Harry.”
“Because my father went to this school,
Harry felt it. As soon as he had entered Room 21b and locked the door securely behind him, he collapsed onto the bed, and went straight to sleep.
Pansy snickered. “Snape’s going to
Harry nodded. As the panic and anxiety seeped out of his system, the shame flooded in. There had been cameras in there. Tomorrow, his panic attack would be all over the

against
obvious.
Tracey glanced at the others quickly. “They’re just setting something up, they’ll be here soon.”
“I’m on the other side, Draco,” Harry swallowed. “I’m- I’m alone.”
“Yes,” Voldemort replied in his raspy, nails-on-chalkboard attempt at a voice. “You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite.” Disgust coloured his tone. “Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.”
Harry flashed her the most genuine smile he could manage and left the bathroom as quickly as he could.
Harry was pulled away from Tracey’s snappish response by Draco’s hand tugging on his arm.
It took Harry a moment to notice him, but soon enough the shadows behind McGonagall moved, revealing a lurking Filch.
So young Harry rarely cried, though perhaps he should have. On his twelfth birthday, however, Harry thought he might have been excused for wanting to cry, because of all the lonely birthdays he had ever had, this one was by far the loneliest.
“Why not?”
The boa constrictor eyed him oddly, and Harry felt the strange urge to blush.
Above all the shouting and chatter was the voice of the man who Harry guessed was Gilderoy Lockhart – via use of a voice amplifying charm, Harry thought, maybe
“I’m doing the right thing, aren’t I Harry?”
Draco dragged him away, leaving Daphne and Blaise snickering behind them.
“Only because I have nothing else to do.”
The other boy brightened immediately. “Great! My gran got me a whole lot of seeds, including these Leaping Toadstools, which are actually really interesting because they can jump up to a foot in the air! I’ve planted them already and they’re growing really well. We’re actually studying them this year, I think.” Neville took a breath, flushing. “Sorry. Erm, how were yours?”
Harry smiled his own gratitude, and even Blaise gave a nod of acknowledgement, but Draco simply turned his head away.
Harry and Draco both laughed, but Hermione was gaping at Blaise in shock.
Draco jogged up beside him, bemused by the vision before him. “What did I miss?”
“Oh,” Harry said, once he had entered the final room.
“Harry!”
“I knew Basilisks were big, but this thing must be twenty feet long at least,” said Pansy. She looked caught between intrigue and disgust.
Tracey stamped her foot. “Daphne!”
Harry was dredged from his reminiscing by an insistent tap at the window. The sight that greeted him in the dawn light had Harry out of bed in a heartbeat, snatching up his glasses and fumbling with the latch in his rush to yank the window open.
“I quite think that’s a conversation for when we get home, dear,” said Narcissa, before fixing her stare on Gemma once more. “This is a substantial favour you’ve done for Hadrian, Miss Farley.”
“That does sound like you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Another knock interrupted conversation – this one high, a rapping sound, metal on wood. Harry’s heart dropped before the door finished opening. A flash of platinum blond hair; Harry squeezed Draco’s fingers in his own but it meant little when Lucius Malfoy came stepping, sneering, into view.
“Silence, Lachlan,” the leader snapped, before looking down at Harry, Draco, and the still whimpering Fang tucked behind them. Her eyes were darker than the forest beyond the
“Quickly, if you don’t mind!”
The creature crashed into the decorative snakes either side of the pathway as Harry sprinted to one side of it, sending massive crashing bits of stone down around him. Spying an alcove ahead through his smudged glasses, Harry aimed straight for it and ducked inside. Within were more tunnels – sewage pipes, some corner of his mind realised - and Harry picked one at random, whirling around corner after corner until he found a tucked away grate and crawled up against it, holding one hand over his mouth to stop his panting breath.
Gemma found their plight particularly hilarious, and would often lean over the shoulders of the first years to remind them that they hadn’t seen anything yet – just wait until O.W.L.’s, not to mention N.E.W.T.’s. This had the desired effect: hyperventilation for Tracey and wide, terrified eyes for everyone else.
“That doesn’t mean it’s not useful, it-”
“We don’t know how much time we have,” Harry shook his head. “We should go now.”
some small, traitorous part of Harry’s mind whispered,
Finally, they reached the entrance to the dungeons where they would have to split – Hermione to Ravenclaw Tower, and Harry down beneath the Black Lake.
Daphne promptly hit her on the shoulder and flounced up to her room.
Harry told them – albeit reluctantly – about visiting Hagrid to see his new pet, and when they kept on pressing, told them about Norbert the dragon.
“I warned you,” Vernon Dursley growled, glowering at Harry and struggling with Dudley’s bowtie. “If you can’t control that bloody bird, it’ll have to go.”
Harry leant back into Hagrid’s to grab a lantern and cracked his neck. “Let’s go.”
Harry thought that over for a moment, before tilting his head to one side and meeting Blaise’s black eyes. “And your parents?”
Harry gave her one last gentle pet before turning to the parcel on his bed. He couldn’t fight the swell of happiness in his chest at sight of his name printed in Draco’s characteristically perfect cursive on the top letter. Even here, in the cold dread of Privet Drive, his best friend made him feel warm. The grin on his face was goofy and certainly embarrassing, he knew, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to care.
He thought he closed his eyes but it was too dark to tell. Where was the light? Uncle Vernon was coming. The world was black and he was drowning and then-
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco turned away first, and Harry fell into step beside him as they walked silently up the path to Hogwarts.
“Good,” Narcissa said. “Then let’s begin.”
Blaise had his head in his hands. Daphne was shaking her head, and even Hermione looked a little exasperated with Harry’s news.
I know it's been forever! See the end notes for an explanation, just know that updates will probably be very slow for the coming weeks, and I'm so sorry :( I hope some bamf!Narcissa can make up for it!
he had heard a voice, and it’s not like he could trust Lockhart to have heard anything over the sound of his own arrogant rambling.
“Well then,” said Narcissa. “I’ll await you both on the other side. Keep your speech clear – we don’t want either of you landing in some alley across the country.”
“I’m sure, I’m sure,” Dumbledore nodded. “But I’m afraid I’ll have to take young Harry off your hands.”
Harry met his gaze steadily. His fellow students, at least, didn’t make him uncomfortable.
“You know the Weasley twins?” Pansy asked incredulously. “I thought you hated that lot.”
They looked. Further down the corridor, a door was partially open; spilling from it was a long puddle of water. The sight of it pooling in the cracks of the stone floor reminded Harry a little too much of the night he, Blaise, and Draco had found Mrs Norris petrified. Like most things that made him uncomfortable, Harry chose not to think about it.
“After all, what else are friends for but to give you stuff?” Daphne said haughtily.
“Get the door open!” Harry yelled. He threw the correct key blindly to the ground, making loop-de-loops around the room in a desperate attempt to throw off his pursuers.
Harry smiled. “I do.”
Draco shook his head. “Never mind.”
There was light shining from behind Hagrid’s nauseatingly pink curtains when they finally arrived at  the groundskeeper’s small home, so Harry didn’t feel too bad about knocking on the door – but they was greeted with quite the sight.
“So he’s in on it, then,” said Neville. “Whatever ‘it’ is, anyway.”
Dumbledore nodded his head, oddly sombre. “Quite a violent death for so ancient a creature, don’t you think, Harry?”
“Okay,” Neville whispered.
The pieces were beginning to click together into Harry’s head. “You were controlling her.”
Harry furrowed his brow. “But that’s the same one.”
....So I'm not dead.
The world was completely, entirely dark.
Harry didn’t think about the Incident after that. He didn’t want to – every time he remembered crying like a
“Oh come on Tracey, they’ve been useless so far and you know it.”
Harry couldn’t breathe, couldn’t understand the words coming out of Lockhart’s mouth, couldn’t think-
“She won’t wake,” said Tom Riddle. Despite his body’s incorporeality, his voice rang strong and true.
“I’m not going to thank a Gryffindor.”
“See, the third one here takes you back, and the last one takes you forward! But- oh,” she faltered. “To go forward – it’s only a small vial.” She held the potion up as proof. “There’s only enough for one.”
George lifted both hands, moving them like scales as he considered. “Life debt, pest control – yeah, that’s about even.”
Harry’s fingers twitched towards his lightning bolt scar, but the Headmaster shook his head.
Harry shifted in his borrowed Quidditch gear, fingers tapping his Nimbus 2000 anxiously as he filed into place.
Unfortunately, the silence didn’t last very long, because only a few minutes later a familiar boy with platinum blond hair and pointy features opened the door to Harry’s compartment.
“That we are Freddie,” said George.
, and while a criminal trial was not the usual content of the gossip magazine, every single publication would be releasing an article on the trial of such an influential man as Lucius Malfoy.
“As in-”
He darted and dove, as more and more keys flitted around his head before leaping away when he turned to look. They were all identical – except for one.
Harry downed the potion in one, gave his friends a last wave goodbye, and stepped through the flames.
“And you don’t think that would look a bit strange? Going down there for a visit and then refusing to visit him again?”
“His grandmother sent it to him.”
Draco sighed. “I suppose that will have to do,” he said, and gave Harry a hug.
Harry sighed.
The Great Hall of Hogwarts was an intimidating area, not least because of the four tables filled with older students staring at them - not to mention the professors. Harry was rather distracted, however, so focussed was he on studying the charmed ceiling he had read so much about in-
“He makes you uncomfortable.”
us?” George repeated, dangerously.
“A girl’s bathroom that no one ever uses,” Hermione pointed out. “And listen: Myrtle’s crying.”
“Tell me,” he said, almost gently. “What do you see?”
“Second one killed this term!” he said, in a poor explanation. “Reckon it’s either foxes or a Blood-Sucking Bugbear. Need Dumbledore’s permission to put a charm around the hen-coop. Now, you sure you’re alright, Harry? You don’t look too well.”
Harry lowered his eyes, and found himself missing the basilisk.
“Yowch,” said the twins, but Harry was more distracted by the familiar form moving up next to him.
Dobby nodded enthusiastically. “Of course, Mr Potter! Oh, Dobby is so pleased Mr Potter listened to Dobby, sir. Mr Potter will be safe, now!”
“I agree,” Hermione said, watching Harry and Draco cautiously, as though waiting for another argument to break out. Harry gave her a reassuring smile.
Eventually, the world returned. There was someone else by his side, a hand in his own. Harry squeezed. Draco squeezed back.
down the dark passageway the twins were exploring. “What is that?”
Harry furrowed his brow. “What?”
Harry thought, and resolved to think on it later.
“At least I have you with me this time,” Harry smiled at him. Draco went an odd shade of pink in the lantern light.
Harry was dimly aware of a hand on his side pulling him backwards, of a voice in his ear begging him to move, to
Vernon and Petunia Dursley did not appreciate silence. Silence lead to all sorts of

and was quite possibly the strangest thing Harry had ever seen. After all, Harry’s Uncle Vernon had told him many times that he was unwanted in the Dursleys’ house, and this message had been reinforced at school by Dudley and his friends bullying anyone who even considered making friends with Harry (and of course proceeding to tell Harry that no one wanted to be friends with him in the first place, because Harry was a
“You see, Mr Potter,” Dumbledore continued, “What you have discovered, is the Mirror of Erised.”
“I have friends who can come pick me up,” Harry said.
Flint continued to sneer in an alarmingly Snape-like fashion as the players landed in slightly shaky formation. Ecklehurt crashed next to Harry with a snarl, slamming her broom into the ground next to her with more force than necessary.
“Hadrian James Potter,” Draco said. His voice was suspiciously shaky.
Also present were some of his other friends parents, though not all of them were such a welcome sight – Magnus Bulstrode, Millicent’s broad-faced father, eyed the people around him with disdainful eyes; Felix Greengrass, Daphne and Astoria’s father, was talking quietly with a sneering Nathaniel and Priya Nott, Theo’s parents; Nora Parkinson, Pansy’s mother and another of Narcissa’s more genuine friends, smiled shrewdly at the Malfoys as they made their way to Lady Zabini’s side. A notepad and quill hovered next to Lady Parkinson’s head – Pansy’s mother was Chief Editor for
“Hadrian Potter!” called the loudest voice in the room.
“Flourish and Blotts,” Tracey read from her list. “But this is strange – I noticed it when I first read the letter. Nearly all of our books are written by the same person.”
Blaise raised his eyebrows. “Why?”
“This is a mess,” Daphne murmured. She was curled up on the sofa next to the fire, Astoria tucked against her side. Her fingers were white where they clutched onto her little sister’s shoulder, but if it hurt, Astoria didn’t let it show. “Why haven’t the teachers found this creep yet?”
“Hello, Mrs Dursley,” Narcissa greeted pleasantly. She did not smile. “We have come to retrieve Harry’s supplies. I trust you do not mind.”
Behind him stood a young woman with bright red hair and familiar vivid green eyes, next to a man with messy black hair and glasses. Harry didn’t have to note the similarities to know who they were. Plenty of books recording his history contained pictures of his parents, after all.
“So,” Draco lowered his voice to a whisper. “What do you say we go flying?”
“Voldemort,” Harry said. He paused, and then continued honestly: “I wasn’t expecting this.”
Snape pursed his lips, but stepped back as Harry and Draco took the stage with matching grins.
“What…”
Harry watched him go, confused. “I don’t understand.”
So distracted was he by mulling over the mirror and what Dumbledore had said, that it wasn’t until he was lying in bed that night that he thought to wonder how, exactly, the Headmaster knew what he saw in the mirror, when Harry had sworn to never tell.
“It’s not about adventures and battles,” said Tracey Davis, thinking about a sister she lost, not to death, but to disownment. “It’s about knowing where Harry’s life is going to lead, and how far we’re willing to go with him.”
There was an emotion in her eyes Harry thought he recognised, but didn’t want to name. Disgust was never a kind thing to see.
Harry wasn’t listening. Instead, he beamed at Draco, but the blond boy still looked sombre. Harry’s smile softened into something gentler. Draco, finally, smiled back.
badge grabbed Harry’s arm roughly, shoving him up through the crowd until he was tugged into the side of Gilderoy Lockhart.
“What is that?” Neville asked, eyes wide.
“Here you go,” he said, handing it over. “Room 41b, it’s on the third floor, to the left. I’m John, by the way. What’s your name, kid?”
be controlled!” His last words were a snarl.
“Ugh.
“If I didn’t know any better, Draco,” Harry began casually. “I’d say you were
“Um, um, yes, I just need to remember…”
There was still the detention to worry about, but even that didn’t seem so bad when the caretaker, Filch, told them that they would be serving their detention with Hagrid, not Snape.
“Where do you stand, Potter?” a narrow-eyed sixth year quizzed.
They were halfway back to the Slytherin Common Room when Harry realised with a curse that, caught up in his musings on the Chamber as he was, he’d left his bag in the library.
“He’s only the groundskeeper,” Draco sniffed. “Who cares what he thinks?”
Daphne laughed with very little humour. “All respect, Granger, but you’re a mu- a Muggleborn. Most of us here grew up with stories of the war, with parents who were on the side that lost. The Light won the last war because of dumb luck and whatever wild magic saved Harry that night. Without it, the Dark Lord would have won.”
Aragog clicks angrily at them, massive legs stamping on the ground. “That is a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets!”
good news.
Another attack strikes Hogwarts, and Harry is oblivious.
“It’s a stupid nickname. My name is Millicent.”
Narcissa inhaled sharply.
“We are?” echoed the Slytherins – Draco and Blaise in disbelief, and Pansy sounding, frighteningly enough, eager.
Still, there was no use postponing it, not when the Malfoys were waiting for him on the other side. Harry lifted his chin, steeled his stomach, and spoke as clearly as he could:
“Can we be doing-”
“I’ll write as often as possible,” Draco promised on the last day of school, before hugging Harry fiercely.
“It’s not uncommon for a traditional pureblood home to be frightening,” said Theo. His eyes seemed even more solemn than usual. “Those of us who are lucky find ways to cope.”
“Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort was destroyed?”
“Ah, well, yes, most unfortunate- no one regrets more than I, really-”
“So are we decided?” Harry interrupted before Hermione could continue. “We go to see Hagrid, see if we can find anything out about what the Cerberus is guarding?”
“Theo and I have searched everywhere,” Tracey explained as she, Harry, and Hermione left the library after a quiet study session. “But none of your lineage seems to point back to Slytherin. The closest we found was in
Slowly, oh so slowly, the great limb shifted until the trapdoor was fully revealed. They were all panting by the end of it – though Blaise turned his face away so Neville and Hermione couldn’t see.
“Professor?”
“Harry, what are you
“So it escaped?” Neville guessed.
would come with flying. The wind rushing past his face, the view from high above the ground – he couldn’t imagine anything more exhilarating.
Harry watched him leave with trepidation, before turning back to the Lady Malfoy. She cast a
So it was that the first year Slytherins made their way to the Quidditch pitch that Friday afternoon, with varying degrees of excitement, to meet the Gryffindors for their shared lesson.
“Got to admire his recovery,” Draco said, leaning over to Harry with amusement in his eyes.
Tracey sighed, finally putting her school list away. “Maybe he’ll be an alright teacher.”
Harry was listening to Draco talk rather animatedly about all he had heard about the Sorting Ceremony when they were interrupted by a boy who looked rather like the twins Harry had met earlier. He soon found out why.
Tom was still monologuing. “I fashioned myself a new name,” he bragged, “A name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.”
“Well,” some fourth year Harry didn’t know piped up, “At least they can stop saying it’s us now.”
Of course, facing off against Gryffindor meant facing off against the Weasley twins, and Harry met their eyes with caution. He thought they were on good terms, but Fred and George were fearsome Beaters, and the mischief in their matching grins did not speak of good things for Slytherin. Besides, Harry remembered with slight worry, he still owed them a favour for taking care of Norbert the dragon.
“Hadrian!”
Harry blinked at him. “In the library.”
Harry swung the lantern in as wide an arc as he dared. The spiders retreated from the light before scuttling back in.
“Harry, breathe.”
,” Harry growled. He felt as though the whole room were shaking, he was so furious. “I’m not here to be told what to do – by
Gemma inhaled sharply. “I thought that was just a legend.”
“Hadrian just lost control of his magic,” Gemma explained. “It wasn’t really his fault.”
Dumbledore smiled at the newborn Fawkes fondly. “Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.”
“You dislike Professor Snape,” Blaise said. It was not a question.
“Why not?”
“Out on their own.”
Narcissa’s eyes were soft and kind. “I can help, Harry, but only if you tell me what’s wrong.”
There was a thud behind them, and Harry spun to find Lockhart, robes covered in muck, collapsed onto the ground.
, Draco’s father is on the Board of Governors,
He heard no screaming, so he assumed the twins had listened. On the wall Harry was now facing, the massive shadow of a basilisk flickered in the firelight.
, and then Harry found himself making direct eye contact with a very large snake.
By the time Harry was climbing into the car next to Piers, he had settled on a sort of wary excitement, which couldn’t even be dampened by the other boys’ comments.
Blaise squeezed him once, comforting, and left Harry standing in the corridor, late for Defence and his head spinning atop his shoulders.
go “gallivanting off to fight giant, ancient magical creatures”, much less without reasonable adult support – “
And then there were warm arms around his shoulders and Harry was being hugged for the first real time in his life, and he turned his head to meet the anxious grey eyes of Draco Malfoy.
“I was saying, six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records, you know.”
“Oh no, oh no, oh no.” Neville Longbottom was shaking as badly as Harry was where his wand was keeping the club aloft.
Dumbledore’s office was filled with an impressive amount of magical paraphernalia – a series of strange, silver instruments whirred in unison on a table; bits and bobs and knick knacks sat on every available surface, all foreign to Harry; the Sorting Hat rested, silent, on a high up shelf; and, perhaps most oddly, portraits covered the walls. Within each sat a sleeping witch or wizard, save for one. The exception was an elderly wizard with very small glasses, not unlike Headmaster Dumbledore’s, who was reading a book entitled in a language Harry could not read. The label on his gilded frame read
“Listen up, Slytherins,” Marcus Flint snarled. “You think you’ve got what it takes to win? Fine. But if any of you waste my time today with some pathetic attempt at riding a broom, you’ll be off this pitch and into detention before you can blink. Got it? Now line up!”
“Oh,” said Harry. He glanced back at Aragog, nerves returning as curiosity abated and reality set in. “Well, thank you. We’ll… We’ll just be going now.”
“A monstrous creature.” The centaur turned its head to the dead unicorn, mourning its passing with a bow. “It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death – but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A
“Oh, already? Ah, but look at the time! Dinner’s almost done! Spooky how time flies when one’s having fun, isn’t it?”
“That’s reason enough for dislike, maybe even hatred, but you tense up whenever he comes near,” Blaise spoke like they were discussing the weather, and somehow he made his perch upon the desk look like a lazy sprawl. “It’s painfully obvious, you know. So what I want to know is
he thought fiercely. He blinked, hard, until his eyes were dry again, and then released a long, shaky breath.
Harry wanted to tell her to shut up, but he simply closed his eyes for a moment and shoved his bad memories away. When he opened them again, Blaise was watching him.
“Pretending I don’t exist.”
Harry swallowed. “Well, might as well be me then.”
Blaise gave the remaining Slytherins a glance. “Is it just me, or are they a
“What is a massive murderous spider scared of?” asked Daphne, shoving Pansy off her and onto the floor.
“Hello everyone,” she greeted with her customary hair flip. “I trust you had good holidays.”
“No, Harry. But I must ask you… is there anything you’d like to tell me?” Dumbledore peered at him over his half-moon glasses with a careful eye. “Anything at all?”
Harry considered the suggestion for a moment. He didn’t want
As soon as they were gone, Harry flicked off the cloak and turned to his best friend.
“Hadrian,” she began, gently. “Why do you not want to go see your relatives?”
Harry flushed. That seemed pretty obvious. “Right. Um. Okay then.”
Harry had started wincing about halfway through and found himself positively cowering by the end. “Draco, I’m sorry-”
Harry rubbed his eyes and yawned, taking a moment to remember where he was – remember what had happened. “Coming!”
Draco elbowed him in the side. “Stop fidgeting,” he hissed. “You’ll be fine.”

marks of a Dark Wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent wizard who could talk to snakes? You know they called Slytherin himself Serpent-Tongue. And remember what was written on the wall:
Millicent tugged Pansy closer, and they clasped hands under cover of the dimly lit room.
Harry exchanged a glance with the other members of his group, focussing on Neville as the twins’ Housemate.
Filch escorted them down to Hagrid’s hut, telling them delightedly about what it was like back in his day, when students were hung from the ceiling by their thumbs, and were penalised with all sorts of other terrifying punishments.
Harry looked down to where Hagrid’s dog was whining and dragging his paws behind Draco. Fang looked even more scared than the boys did.
Halloween and friends.
“You’re the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,” interrupted Harry, his own incredulity steadily giving way to indignant fury. “You can’t leave right when we need someone to
Harry’s first thought was Snape. He was harsh, and unfair, and hated Harry for a reason he still couldn’t understand. But… he didn’t want to jump to conclusions. That was how mistakes were made.
To Harry’s great surprise, it wasn’t Draco or Blaise or any of his other friends waiting by his bedside; it was Ginny Weasley. She must have been watching him sleep – which he felt slightly uncomfortable about – because the second his eyes met hers Ginny was on her feet and babbling at a thousand miles an hour.
Harry desperately wanted to tell him to bugger off and let in his friends, but he did have two questions – and like hell was he going to go see the Headmaster voluntarily later to ask.
Number 4 had drawn nearer with all the cheer of a mausoleum. It lay identical to every other house in Little Whinging, and yet the sense of despair it dredged from Harry’s bones made it stand out almost as much as Dumbledore did. Standing out – the Dursleys would certainly hate that.
“Whoo!”
“Dangerous, don’t you think Georgie?”
“You are a walking catastrophe in Potions,” Harry told him. “It’s very distracting for me, not to mention rather stressful. I want you to get a tutor, and I want you to work on the class every spare second you get. I don’t care if you start failing your other classes – just pick up your act in Potions.”
“Ginny Weasley,” McGonagall replied, and dismissed the gathered staff with a solemn wave of her hand.
The House Elf leaned forward. “Dobby has to protect Mr Potter. To warn him. Mr Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.”
“It is not my speech that is fascinating, hatchling,” the snake hissed, and shifted forward a little. “I have not met a two-legged who could speak the snake-tongue before.”
The torch flared, momentarily brushing back the shadows of the castle, and Harry stepped back with a sharp inhale.
Neville shuffled forward on his knees. “I’ll go.”
“Good afternoon, Hadrian,” Dumbledore greeted. His blue eyes twinkled brightly.
Harry thought with slight annoyance, but barely hesitated before casting his returned
Hermione shook her head thoughtfully. “I don’t think so.”
been a misunderstanding. Harry was simply visiting my own home for the holidays. Draco gets ever so lonely, you realise, and Harry wished to keep him company. We are only returning for a moment to retrieve Harry’s school notes from his first year. The boys wish to study together.” She turned an icy blue gaze on Petunia Dursley, brows still raised inoffensively in contrast. “Petunia and I spoke about the visit just a week ago, didn’t we Petunia? You remember, don’t you?”
“So where is it?”
There were a lot of glares and a fair amount of irritated muttering with Gemma’s interruption, but the Slytherins obeyed – with the exception of Draco Malfoy, who stuck to Harry’s side like glue.
The letter, Harry found, was so very
Before he had passed the first syllable of
Draco grimaced. “He’s not a professor, and my father says he’s a total oaf. Plus, have you seen the size of him? He looks to be half-giant.”
“I can understand that,” said Tracey. “But do you really think Harry would make you choose?”
All memories paled in comparison to this image.
in here somewhere, so we’ll be taking our sister and leaving now.”
“Better than a Gryffindor,” Pansy pointed out. “Who’s the Hufflepuff?”
Draco stepped forward, outraged. “Oh you little-”
There was silence for a moment. “I’ll be your friend forever, Harry,” Draco declared eventually, youthful determination colouring his voice. “I’ll always be your best friend.”
Draco’s face lit up with a beam, and he leaned forward in his seat. “Perfect! Now, what house do you think you’ll be in? Personally, I think Slytherin, because everyone in my family’s in Slytherin, and everyone knows it’s the best house.”
Dumbledore settled into the visiting chair Ginny had vacated earlier, the charmed mobile toads on his characteristically garish orange robes leaping grumpily around his knees. “Your adventure in the Chamber was but a week ago.”
Harry looked up. “Wait – Neville and I are going to see Hermione and Theo tomorrow. Do you guys want to come?”
Weasley let out a pained sound. Harry glanced at him apologetically, but refused to give ground.
“He always seems so nice, though,” Abbot protested weakly. “And, after all, he is the one who made You-Know-Who disappear.”
“Not helping,” Harry hissed, and shot into the air.
Ecklehurt swore loudly. Harry supposed she was betting that Flint would hate his Muggleborn mother more than the way she had humiliated Flint the previous year. Harry had been betting on that too, if he was honest. Apparently, they had both bet wrong.
“That was very cruel of them,” Harry said quickly.
“I’ve heard there are monsters in this Forest,” whispered Draco, unhelpfully. His face seemed paler than usual, though whether that was a trick of the light or a symptom of the situation was unclear. “Werewolves and vampires and centaurs. Mother used to tell me bedtime stories about them.”
“Don’t you like Potions?” Pansy asked.
wizard.”
Harry collapsed on the floor next to the food. He couldn’t even bring himself to smile at the way Dudley had reacted. He was too tired. Harry closed his eyes against the dark, and began to dream.
“But then what if...” Tracey lifted her head thoughtfully. “What if she never left?”
Harry remained sombre. “When I touched him, he seemed to burn. Do you know why that is, sir?”
“I’ll never understand this fuss over a sport,” Daphne sighed.
“My dear man,” Lucius smiled cruelly, faux politeness and smarm. “Please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your – well, do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the headmaster was here.”
Tracey blushed. “Well, it isn’t fair to leave us out of things.”
Draco’s fingers tightened around Harry’s own.
Harry shifted, and nodded.
Down below, Miles Bletchley (the current Keeper) called the game with a whistle and a strong throw of the Quaffle, and Harry’s thoughts retreated in the way of rapid fire instinct.
Harry told the Hat honestly.
if we had a senior with us. Someone older, more experienced,
Or rather, Narcissa was talking; Petunia was cowering.
The remaining twenty minutes of the class were a mess. Both sides of the classroom, Slytherin and Ravenclaw, banded together in an unusual and impressive display of school unity to spell the creatures back into submission after Lockhart abandoned them (though Harry noticed Vince and Greg in one corner, attempting to punch a trio of pixies for trying to steal their cupcakes). Harry and Hermione ended up back to back, stilling whole groups of pixies at a time with a widened
“Dobby,” he began, carefully. “If you give me the letters, and unlock Hedwig’s cage for me, I will promise not to go back to Hogwarts this year.”
“Draco’s parents were alleged Dark supporters in the War,” Blaise explained, though Hermione frowned slightly at the ‘alleged’. “Light supporters still don’t take too well to the other side, even now.”
The Sorting Ceremony sped by after the Sorting Hat’s odd little song.
“No!” Harry interrupted her, before lowering his head. “I’m sorry, I just- I don’t think we should go there.”
A short update and a short chapter, because it's a little bit of a filler. Good news: next chapter is Halloween!
someone to be messed with, if she could bend the snakes into submission.
Lucius Malfoy was the least of his concerns at this point, however, because the Slytherin team had now reached the centre of the pitch.
“I’m sure this will be news to you, Mrs Malfoy,” – Draco’s own glare turned icy at the surely intentional term of disrespect to the Lady of a Noble House – “But a man who may be dangerous to our young Harry here has just recently escaped his confinement. The best place for him right now is with his family – I’m sure you understand.”
“Saviour of Poor, Defenceless, Weasleys-”
“Then I think it’s time for bed,” said Tracey, standing up and resting her hands on her hips. “It’s been an awful day, I’d say. We could all use an early night.”
. That is, once you’d earned their loyalty, of course. Being Sorted into Slytherin was just the first step – Harry got the impression that the more important part of earning loyalty came by proving yourself as worthy of it, which seemed rather sensible to him.
“Lucky idiots,” she muttered, while dragging him into her own warm hug. Harry let his eyes drift close. He thought he quite liked hugs, now that he’d experienced them.
“Well then,” said Probably-George.
“I’ll get the ingredients, you set up the cauldron?” Blaise suggested. The calculating look in his eyes from the Hospital Wing was back again. Harry tried to ignore it.
He resisted looking at the stands. Hermione and Neville were there, he knew, and Harry’s Slytherin friends – even, to his surprise, Daphne and Pansy. Daphne, of course, would be inspecting her nails and pretending not to be interested in the older boys trying out, while Pansy would be waiting eagerly for a particularly nasty injury.
“I’m not asking you to pledge your loyalty,” said Blaise. “I’m asking you to help, at least while you can. Merlin knows Harry has trouble helping himself.”
Daphne sighed in exasperation. “Who cares about strongest players when none of them are cute?”
Harry meets a new ghost, and finds a book.
“You’re welcome,” Harry replied automatically, and watched the snake slither away.
“Ministry of Magic!”
Draco nodded jerkily. “Right. Exactly.”
He took a deep breath and focussed on the snakes, the tiny etched markings, the jewelled eyes, and said:
“Hey, you’re Hadrian Potter, aren’t you?” the red-head asked, eyes locked on the spot where Harry’s scar was hidden beneath his hair.
She turned to Millicent as a last ray of hope, but Millicent just shrugged a shoulder.
“Oh,” Hagrid’s whole body relaxed. “Well, they are. Did y’know, you play a bi’ of music to one, they go righ’ to sleep? Really swee’ lil’ things.”
“That’s because you look like a delinquent,” said Daphne matter-of-factly, and flicked her hair behind her shoulder.
“Draco,” Harry said. “I’m sorry.”
Silence reigned for a few moments even after the door slammed behind him.
Harry felt Blaise’s eyes heavy on his face. He felt cold, all the fire of his anger having just been used to propel the false ‘celebrity’ into the wall of his own office. Lockhart was barely managing to lift his head, dazed. Harry did not lower his wand, and Blaise had yet to say anything, so Harry simply continued.
“That’s not the point,” Blaise sighed again, and clasped Harry’s other shoulder as well to look him head on. “Listen, Harry. It’s not about you getting hurt or not getting hurt. It’s that you put yourself in that position in the first place.”
, obviously, I mean, you did save me, but you saved the whole school and you killed a

“It’s ridiculous,” she told him on one of their evenings spent skipping dinner in the library. “What’s the point in doing something that has such a high risk of getting you hurt, or killed? Although the charm on the brooms

Harry waited until he was gone before he released sigh he was holding.
“You liked my present, then?” Draco smirked as soon as his face appeared on the glass.
Harry had never celebrated Halloween before. The Dursleys didn’t like it (too
“He’s not stupid,” Tracey sighed. “I’m sure he suspects, even if he doesn’t really know.”
Hermione flushed. “Your glasses. I learnt a spell that will fix them for you.”
He tossed the remembrall onto Longbottom’s stomach, and turned to leave.
Draco continued talking for most of the train ride, with the exception of a few questions that Harry had the time to answer and an interruption by a girl with bushy brown hair and buck teeth asking about a toad. Harry found that Draco wasn’t all that bad, when he wasn’t being so stuck-up, and had the sudden realisation that he had just found his first friend.
“Seven o’clock,” Draco replied. “Breakfast starts in half an hour. You slept through the night.”
“You’re joking,” Draco exclaimed in shock.
“I’ll be holding you to that,” said Blaise.
Harry watched in shock as his Head of House shoved Professor Quirrell into a wall with a glare.
“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” Dumbledore commanded, and Hagrid quietened at once. The obedience would have worried Harry if he hadn’t been carefully splitting his attention between the scene in front of him and his best friend. “If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However, you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Millicent snorted. “No ratting you out, remember? Anyway, he’ll be fine, it’s just petrification. Now, more importantly, are you going to the Duelling Club?”
“A ‘distorted part of history’ still can’t be trusted – you said it yourself, it’s been twisted.”
“I- I need a room, please,” Harry told him, silently cursing his stutter. “But I haven’t got any money on me. I can pay you tomorrow, I just need to visit Gringotts, but…”
“The Weasley twins have been pranking you?” Harry asked, shaking his head in an attempt to clear his confusion. The mess in the room and Lockhart’s rant and the worry about Ginny still in the back of his head – he felt rather like he was running ten steps behind.
Okay, so I'm going to be writing a side story as I go along with the main stories, which will be essentially giving a little look into the side characters we don't see in the canon books - Millicent, Theodore, etc. I'm thinking it will be a chapter for each character, and in the chapter we'll see a bit of their home life, their way of thinking - just a snippet of their life, really, and who they are as a person, because it's harder to really elaborate in the main story without incorporating so much that it starts getting off topic and unnecessary. So! Look forward to that some time soon - I hope you'll be as excited about it as I am :) See you in book two!
“So, Hadrian-”
“You do know there’s a monster on the loose, right?” Millicent asked from where she had been staring at them in incredulous anger since they got back, her equally ill-tempered cat Sabre clutched tight to her chest. “Going to the groundskeeper’s hut after curfew is one thing, but going into the
Draco snorted. He was sitting as far away from Hermione as he could get, even leaning back in his chair. Harry thought he was being ridiculous, but at least Hermione was ignoring him, and Blaise seemed totally unconcerned with the situation.
He saw himself in the reflection, unsurprisingly, but behind him…
“I just don’t.”
Perhaps this is why he accepted her hand, or perhaps it was simply because of her enthusiasm.
The aftermath.
– which, incidentally, is celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop the
Harry stiffened. What was he talking about?
.” Light began to emanate from his wand, just in time for Draco to drop down, followed by Hermione. “Alright Longbottom,” Blaise looked at the tough, dark plant they were sitting on with disgust. “What is this?”
Harry’s lungs emptied with a rush of air he hadn’t realised he’d been holding.
Draco let out a barely audible sigh, and Harry allowed himself to relax.
The twins smiled at them. “It’s about the diary.”
Harry wasn’t certain what he had done to give her any idea otherwise, but perhaps it was just a girl thing.
“Rule-breakers, right after-”
Blaise looked Harry and Draco over properly once they were gone, dark, judging eyes flicking between the two of them.
“Oh.”
Harry glanced in the direction of the flippant hand wave to see two large, gormless looking boys staring out the window into the Black Lake – though as far as Harry could tell, there was currently nothing to see.
“Harry,” she said softly.
“A stranger, down the pub,” the groundskeeper said casually. “Seemed glad t’ be rid o’ ‘im, if I’m honest.”
Hagrid froze.
“Players, practices will be posted in the Common Room. The rest of you, stay out of the way during practice. I won’t have you distracting my team. Now, get lost. Malfoy, stay behind.”
The prefects hurried to obey, though Harry heard Gemma Farley grumbling under her breath. He could relate – what the Hell was Dumbledore thinking?
“What the Hell are you doing?” the Slytherin hissed angrily, storming towards where Draco Malfoy was standing away from the hut awkwardly.
Daphne sighed. “That’s wonderful, but it’s a lot easier for you to say, Granger. If word ever got back to my father about any of this-” She cut herself off, then started again. “I will put me and Astoria first. Always.”
Harry was in and out of the Hospital Wing in a matter of minutes thanks to Madam Pomfrey’s medical prowess, his arm healed and barely aching. Waiting for him and his friends outside, unfortunately, was a familiar first year.
Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts.
’ thought Harry, slightly in shock at himself for forgetting that the twins had dismantled the privacy charm on their curtains, and therefore could hear everything the boys had been saying.
“See,” shrugged Pansy. “He’s fine.”
“We learned last year that the Dark Lord returned,” said Blaise Zabini, with a gravitas far too intense for one of his age. That sort of intensity was not to be unexpected, when one’s mother was known far and wide as the Black Widow. “And that he is trying to kill Harry.”
had not once been acknowledged in the Dursley household in all the ten years Harry had been living there. Each night after his birthday had been and gone, Harry told himself that he did not care about this injustice. This was the only time he permitted lying to himself, and he had made it almost a game to see how convincing he could be. This, because of its regularity, was normal.)
Blaise was calm as he always was, and his slow, methodical way of speaking drew Harry to obey. When he saw he had Harry’s attention, Blaise continued.
Now we're getting somewhere! Sorry for these sporadic updates, by the way - school is exhausting and life is messy, but I have not lost my passion for this story! I plan to keep updating whenever I can :)
“Well, I wouldn’t say everything- you know, books can be misleading.”
Harry let himself get caught up in Draco’s enthusiasm, putting his textbook down. It was a fine day. Even with the tenseness still apparent between Daphne, Pansy, and Harry (because Daphne refused to apologise for insulting Hermione, Pansy refused to leave her best friend’s side, and Harry refused to back down until Hermione got her apology) – Draco was happy, the Common Room was warm, and Harry felt calm.
The screaming lessened immediately. Professor Sprout gestured for them to remove their earmuffs, and beamed.
Harry wasn’t sure what the big problem was – surely a book would go right through her? – but he didn’t think it wise to ask.
“Shut up, Potter,” said Blaise, before he pushed Harry down the trapdoor.
“Good kid. Care for a round? One-on-one, first to catch the snitch?”
Harry shook his head and promptly decided that Hagrid was insane. “Where did you get him?”
“How do you cope?” His voice was soft, but it was no longer breaking. He was not alone.
“I think we should go to bed, Hadrian,” Gemma said eventually, voice soft. “Goodnight, Headmaster.”
“Just a couple, sir,” he said. “I was wondering about Fawkes.”
“Mister Malfoy!” Madam Pince stood behind him, glasses balanced carefully on her hook-like nose and doing nothing to disguise her stern, angry gaze.
“Out of the stalls!” Harry shouted, ducking beneath another swing of the massive wooden club and dodging behind the monster’s legs.
Unfortunately, the other Slytherins weren’t going to let that happen. As soon as Harry and Draco stepped foot into the Common Room, Gemma and Adrian behind them, they were swamped by questions. Harry didn’t particularly enjoy the attention – and even if he had, he was too tired to enjoy
“Now, wha’ makes you ask tha’, then?”
“Has he told you?”
The girl looked between them, before leaning towards Harry. “I heard you were raised by non-magical people- er, Muggles. Is that true?”
“I followed you because you don’t think!” Draco yelled. “You get yourself into trouble constantly, first with the Cerberus, then with the Mirror, now with an illegal
“That one we can call even for putting up with Ron these last two years,” said Fred.
They stood in silence for a time, all of them, simply needing to take a moment to appreciate the gravity of what they had just done – and what they were about to do.
The game, much to Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Millicent’s displeasure, was over before it begun. Professor Snape marched on to the field and told everyone to go back to their common rooms immediately, and not even Gryffindor captain Oliver Wood’s scandalised arguments could change his mind.
Pansy wrinkled her nose. “It’s in the plumbing?”
His thoughts were cut off by an awful hissing behind him – Harry staggered away from it, but there was nowhere to run. The basilisk darted towards in him. His legs were aching from running and though he held his wand in one hand, it was useless now-
“Well, it’s Christmas holidays soon. It’s not like we can do much investigating while you guys are away.” He tried not to sound bitter, but judging from Hermione’s vaguely pitying look, he guessed he failed.
down here, Granger, you and Longbottom over there mean nothing to me.”
“Seya,” said Pansy, and gave him a hard shove.
Surprisingly enough, however, it wasn’t Theo and Tracey that talked to them next.
Harry couldn’t see, but he could guess Hermione was blushing.
Harry didn’t really feel like going to get ice cream after the fiasco in Flourish and Blotts, so he made his excuses and returned to the Leaky Cauldron, waving off his friends’ concern. Aside from Lockhart, the day had been lots of fun. And in just a week, he’d be back at Hogwarts, and he’d get to catch up with Neville and Hermione, even if Lockhart was going to be teaching them Defence. Harry fell into bed that night happy. He couldn’t wait to go back to Hogwarts – to go back home.
” Draco sounded scandalised.
“Try looking at the snake,” said Blaise. His eyes were just slightly squinted in that way Harry was learning meant he was deep in thought. “Imagine it’s real.”
“Look, Albus, Hagrid’s record is against him. I’ve got to take him.”
“Or…” interjected Pansy, “We could just take a look?”
“But- but who would want to tutor me?”
“At least I can move between classes without being blinded by that damn camera,” Harry murmured, poking at his eggs, before freezing. “Sorry. That was insensitive.” He frowned. “Don’t tell Hermione I said that.”
Harry didn’t want to promise him anything before knowing what it was, but Hagrid was already continuing.
Blaise fixed him with a sharp, perceptive stare. Harry did not flinch.
Harry nodded once, gripped Draco’s fingers tighter in one hand and Fang’s collar with the other, and they followed the herd in silence to the edge of the Forest.
“Harry,” Blaise said. His voice was quiet, almost soft. For a second, Harry hated all of them. His friends stood around him, none too close, all gentle with him like he was fragile. Like he could break at any second. Like him breaking would be a bad thing, when all he was now was a burden.
“Something funny, Potter?” he asked. Harry assumed it was meant to be menacing. “I guess the rumours are true. You are going dark. You don’t even care about your parents, do you? Suppose you should be thankful they’re not alive to be disappointed in you, huh?”
Harry felt quite overwhelmed. Now that he was fully awake, the bone-deep ache permeating his entire body was moving to the forefront of his mind, and he found himself entirely unwilling to confront the idea of his already frustrating stardom at Hogwarts getting even more profound.
Gilderoy Lockhart’s office was messier than Harry remembered. Aside from what appeared to be every item the professor owned being scattered across the floor, there were, most alarmingly, long, streaking scorch marks on every wall. A few portraits (of Lockhart himself, of course) hung in tatters, the occupants either fled or sulking in the least damaged areas of the paintings. Harry found an explanation for the at least the mess soon enough, as moving further into the room revealed Lockhart himself, sweeping a hurricane through papers and hurling clothes, odd objects, and trophies into two open trunks resting hazardously on the corners of his desk. He didn’t even notice the four of them standing in the doorway until Pansy spoke.
“I just had to tell you I’m not going to be able to meet this afternoon; I have a detention.”
Eventually Draco had to go, however, and Harry carefully put the mirror away. That was when he noticed it – one last present. He picked it up curiously, turning it this way and that, but it had no name tag. The only note had but three words on it –
“You remember me then, Harry? Ginny told me so much about you.”
Harry mulled that over for a few moments. It seemed to make sense, but then again, Harry didn’t know all that much about phoenixes. He resolved to ask Hermione.
That, of course, left room for the shame to flood in. It rushed into his stomach, a tidal wave of humiliation forcing him to keel forward until his nose touched his knees. He thought he might be sick. Twice this year he had embarrassed himself in front of the only friends he had ever had. Why were they still putting up with him?
“Fraternity,” said Theo.
“You didn’t need to
The group turned to look at the twins, who were, for the first time Harry had ever seen, remarkably solemn.
Dumbledore’s mask wasn’t quite so strong as the Lady Malfoy’s, apparently. The twinkle dropped from his eyes. “I’m afraid I must insist, Narcissa. We may ask Cornelius, if you’d like to be certain, but I rather think he’s had quite enough dealing with Lucius’ unfortunate arrest, don’t you?”
Harry ignored her. “I wonder what he wants?”
“-you’re welcome to share my toilet.”
Harry was stuck somewhere between passing out from shock and bursting from the flood of warm happiness in his chest. He had friends that cared about him. He’d never had that before – but now here they were. He knew he wouldn’t trade them for the world.
Detention and realisations.
“Honestly, what is he thinking?” Draco complained. “Sending two first year students off on their own into the woods. Deadly woods, no less. My father will hear about this.”
Draco nodded, pureblood mask firmly in place, though he seemed grateful to accept the tight hug and kiss on the forehead from his mother nonetheless.
“Are you certain?” Narcissa spoke quickly. “Absolutely certain?”
“I’m saying you need to practice. Shut out your emotions. Learn to keep your mask up even when it feels like you can’t.” Blaise leaned forward. His eyes were black and cold.
“That’s a door,” finished George. He pointed at a thin line marking a circle around eight heavily detailed snakes.
“Well, well, well-”
“It’s fine Draco, I’ll be right back.”
Harry glanced back at his reflection; at his parents, and his friends. “Cursed how?” he asked.
“They won’t tell anyone,” Neville said hurriedly. “At least, I don’t think so. They get in trouble lots, anyway. They’re not like Ron.”
Vernon was yelling from inside the house. Petunia was shrieking. Other houses were turning on their lights to see what was going on. The street was dark, but it was not as scary as Number 4, Privet Drive.
His only solace was that the twins made true on their word, and delivered Norbert the dragon to the tower to be given to their brother Charlie within the week, and with little fuss.
“You’re killing her,” Harry breathed. The twins were looking murderous, but Tom only had eyes for Harry.
“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he? Awfully brave chap.” He offered his hand. “Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.”
Harry was still confused. Who the
Harry thought, and held back a laugh as the majority of the first year Gryffindors took steps back, leaving Weasley with only three people as backup. Harry recognised them from the Sorting as Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, and Hope Fawcett. He couldn’t quite hold back a smirk as Fawcett suddenly realised where she was with a startled look, and took a small step back.
“What a charming Gryffindor attitude,” Daphne said, raising her eyebrows.
Millicent rolled her eyes. “Some of us like the sport, Daph, not just the players.”
That was Gemma Farley, but the hand was someone else – Blaise?
“I’ve seen this book before,” Harry murmured, tracing a hand over the leather cover. “Ginny Weasley wrote in it.” He flicked through the pages. “But it’s blank.”
“Are you okay?”
Harry had to put genuine effort into stopping himself from jumping with glee. Instead, he very slowly brought one finger up to mark the name, careful not to move his eyes away instinctively. Once he had placed it directly above his nail, he traced the connective lines from Black’s name to Narcissa’s. Cousins – that wasn’t too bad. Harry didn’t know what Narcissa had been so worried about; it’s not like Harry had any place to talk when it came to extended relatives.
Harry stared at her, not taking any note of the other Slytherins behind him. “But that means…”
Millicent raised her eyebrows. “Excuse me?”
The sound of the room’s concrete door sliding open drew everyone’s attention, and silence had fallen over the entire Common Room before Severus Snape had even walked in the door. He fixed his students with a hard stare, focussing particularly on the first years, who quivered under his gaze. That is, except for Draco Malfoy, Professor Snape’s godson; and Hadrian Potter, who had lived through scarier things than a man’s glare.
Myrtle’s weeping sounded more like howling from inside. Every tap in the room was running, spilling water off the sides of the sinks in a steady stream. Harry’s just grateful she didn’t flood the toilets.
don’t.”
Fudge appeared quite flustered. “Now, see here, Lucius – Dumbledore suspended! No, no, it’s the last thing we want right now... If Dumbledore can’t stop these attacks – well, I mean to say, who can?”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Why?”
“That would be the Chamber of Secrets,” said Probably-Fred.
. There was little doubt in his mind that the rumours surrounding Adrienna Zabini were true; her long list of mysteriously deceased husbands had given her the nickname the Black Widow, and Harry thought it suited her perfectly.
The questions stopped. Gemma Farley was standing on a table – understandable, considering her small stature – and glaring at her House.
