. He placed it on his right thumb. Unlike the other rings, this one accepted him immediately, giving him a sense of warmth that made tears prickle at his eyes, a feeling he was both unfamiliar and familiar with like something forgotten or lost, finally returning. It was a rush of magic and emotion, a whisper, and a feeling. ‘
After their trip, and during their trip, to Gringotts, Harry wasn't the only one to share his end on the last nine years. Corvus, too, had shared his adventures and life, though they were not as wild or dangerous as Harry's. Two years in the American Magical School, Ilvermorny, and the next three in the French Magical School, Beauxbatons. Harry had not even been aware of other magic schools, which made him hit the palm of his hand to his forehead a second later, because, of course, there were other schools for Wix, Britain was only one, and at that a small one, place in the whole wizarding world. Harry could have hit himself for not having thought of that (which he did, however light).
"We're pretty smart, aren't we?" He asks and little Harry nods uncertainly. "I mean, we have to be, living with people like the Dursleys. At the very least," Harry smirks at him then, "We're the smartest in the house."
“Minerva McGonagall and Sirius Black are your godparents, appointed by your father, while Alice Longbottom and Severus Snape were appointed by your mother, as is Wizarding custom to appoint two sets of godparents.”
He was to be made aware of the Will Reading on the day itself, leaving him only a few minutes to fix himself and make his way to the Will Reading Room. Though it would have been better if he were not present at all but because he was Chief Warlock, his presence was required, whether he was mentioned or not, though that was just Alrod’s opinion. Goblins apparently don’t like him.
Even so, Corvus couldn't help but feel a bit proud of his cousin. Harry had gone through many a thing while he was gone, things he did not yet fully know of, and come out of it still the kind, sweet boy that he'd always been. But even with the short amount of time he's had with his cousin since his return, he had already caught glimpses of the strong, confident young man he was turning into. Harry did not go through all he's had and come out a weaker man.
Corvus raised a brow. "It seems Caligo and I have passed the test, whatever that test may have been," he drawled, amused.
Harry tried not to wince and play with his fringe, asking the goblin instead what was wrong with it exactly.
"Harry," Remus chokes out emotionally. Harry, who was still hidden at the corner, felt a lump form in his throat at the emotion the man felt at the thought of seeing him. He had never felt or experienced that before; someone wanting to see you so much, that is. He's never had anyone miss him before. Except... that might not be true. Looking at Remus, perhaps the man had been missing him all Harry's life; he just didn't know until now.
Vernon splutters, face going red at his nephew's words, so Harry quickly added, "I'm ten, uncle Vernon. I can be kept to the house on my own, most kids do at this age, if it's only for a short hour or two," his uncle pauses, but still hasn't lost that red tinge on his face, so Harry gives the finishing blow, "Kids stop being watched over so much at this age, it's perfectly normal, uncle Vernon."
"Hey there, little man." Not boy, never boy. Harry Potter never had a chance to be a boy, not since that night in Godric's Hallow.
Now, though, as Harry glanced at him with poorly hidden nervousness and rising panic shining within bright verdant orbs.
Harry sniffled quietly, rubbing his face on his cousin's shirt, effectively wiping away any errand tears and then let himself be gently pushed back by his cousin.
Harry blushed but smiled, pleased nonetheless. He's been doing that a lot, smiling. More than he would have thought himself capable of, being in Privet Drive. Then again, he had thought he would not see his cousin again, so he had a perfectly good excuse to be happy. His smile did fade a little, when he thought about how long he had not seen Corvus.
Harry stumbles over to the window, watching as Caligo's form almost molds into the black of the night. When Caligo flies a certain distance, Harry cannot make out his dark form from the dark sky and he drops down to the floor, like a puppet cut off its strings. Tears burst forth and despite the miserable sight he's sure he makes, he feels like he could fly without a broom. He lets out a strained laugh, a little something broken and so at odds at the joy filling his heart and being.
"It takes a while to get used to but you'll manage it in no time!" Corvus said cheerily. Harry groaned and opened his eyes to glare at his cousin.
"For now, we go to Gringotts as planned, settle your vaults and estates, find out who was the sod who failed to take care of you and discuss what we'll do with them once we find out, and then I'll try to take custody of you," Corvus states calmly. It would be their plan for the day. Corvus would talk to Harry more about his inheritance at a later day, tomorrow, or the next when Harry had had more time to process the onslaught of information he was getting.
The second to arrive was another professor, a squat little witch, that wore a light brown robe over a white shirt and a long, darker brown skirt. She had a pointy witch hat, which she promptly removed upon entry and bowed her head at Alrod, before sitting next to Flitwick with a cheery smile and greeting. Harry noticed that while she made a bow, it was more of a deep nod and she did not say the customary goblin greeting. Alrod didn't seem to mind, nodding back at her in greeting instead, and offered no words. Harry pondered this until the next person came.
Harry jolted upright, a thin blanket falling and pooling on his lap. He raised his hands and stared at it as if he could see the spells on him gone if he stared hard enough. Harry checked himself and realized he felt lighter than he ever has. His shoulders and wrists moving more fluidly than it has before; his mind was clear-headed and he felt fresh like spring. Harry knew then, for certain, that he was free of the binding on his core. He hadn’t even realized how heavy his body felt until now.
Corvus had a bewildered look. Why would Vernon be screaming when he was downstairs and Corvus was all the way upstairs and away from him?
He had bought all the necessities: clothes (muggle and wizard), shoes (one of which he used immediately), hygiene care products, personal toiletries, and even a mini health kit (complete with muggle first-aid and wizarding potions). Harry also bought new glasses (with the correct prescription, this time), that were thin and gold-rimmed. He had gone with a round, geometric frame that looked well with him. Harry had never been one to care for his looks, too focused on everything else (like food or avoiding Dudley or the mountain of chores he had). So it was a nice change for Harry to have something that made him look good and to feel good as well.
The Black Heir ring resides inside a black ornate box, silver frames and a large iolite gem on the middle of the lid, the Black Family crest in the middle of the gem; three ravens, a hand holding a wand and a skull, with the word
Harry informs Alrod of this, “So it’s not that it’s evil. It’s just a branch of magic that can be used, and whether it’s hurtful or not depends on the one casting it.”
Harry also found out that the Potters were part of these families and Harry was the Potter heir. It absolutely gobsmacked Harry that the Potter family was old enough to be considered Ancient and with a history rich enough to be considered Noble.
Severus turned a raised brow at the blond beside him, angling his body slightly to converse better with his friend. "I am surprised to see you here, Lucius. I was not aware you had a relationship with either Potter before they passed, and one so significant if you are mentioned in their will," Severus states, an underlying question hidden beneath the words. Lucius nodded slowly, his eyes slightly unfocused as if in thought.
They immediately remove Dumbledore, though, as Harry's Magical Guardian, and changes it to Corvus, which was perfectly legal as Corvus was emancipated, Lord, and Harry's close blood relative. Just because Harry believes Albus Dumbledore to be a great wizard and necessary for the safety of their world, did not ease the pain and sting of his perceived betrayal, his secrets, and his carelessness in regards to Harry's care and wellbeing. Just because Harry believed Dumbledore to be their greatest shot and defence against Voldemort did not mean that Harry would trust the headmaster again, like he once did, only days ago.
While Ilvermony had Quadpot and Quidditch, with a few other clubs like Broom Racing and even muggle sports like soccer and track, but Ilvermorny had more than just quidditch and quadpot. It had horse racing,
"I wasn't coming back unable to protect you. As soon as I was able, I had myself emancipated and came back here, just as I promised," Corvus stated determined, crouching down to be at eye-level with his shorter, younger cousin, hands firmly grasping his bony shoulders.
Except... things are different now; Harry can feel it settling in his bones like the warm breeze of spring.
“The two that are the ones incapacitated: Alice Longbottom due to her being a permanent patient of St. Mungos, along with her husband, Frank Longbottom; Sirius Black due to being in Azkaban, the Wizarding Prison.”
Harry grinned and nodded, his own eyes glinting with mischief and laughter. He snickered as he let the older Potter haul him up to his feet. Corvus grabbed his bag from the closet and the pair made their way downstairs.
“The next two, both are professors in Hogwarts, so you will see them soon. I checked for the reason why the two did not respond to their roles as godparents and it seems that, although we sent missives to them, they returned unopened and unread. It is plausible that they never received the letters in the first place.” Alrod did not mention the fact that if they did not receive their letters, it could only mean they were being tampered with or misdirected by someone, most likely by Dumbledore.
“There are nine properties you can live in, Harry, that are within the UK. There two outside of the UK and the rest are unsuitable for living in. Oaken Ranch is to be given to Remus Lupin.”
Harry keeps his head down, though he looks his uncle in the eye, "I'm getting the mail, sir." Uncle Vernon snorts, waving his hand in dismissal and goes back to his breakfast, father and son practically inhaling their plates. Harry hides a grimace at the sight as he turns.
Harry was well into finishing his Charms' essay when he was distracted by a tapping sound by his window. Harry looks over and sees an unfamiliar owl staring at him. He rushes over to open the window and the owl swoops in, perching on the bedframe. Harry takes a moment to examine the unknown owl.
Corvus glares from his position on Harry's head, though he didn't see from his position, "Hello, Vernon."
Harry sits down as another goblin enters from another door in the room, bringing with him a black piece of parchment and a silver knife. He places it at the table and stands to one side.
Harry was just setting up breakfast when someone rang the doorbell. Everyone froze for a second before Uncle Vernon and Harry made a mad dash for the door. Sadly, Harry was on the other side of the table and Vernon's big build prevented Harry passage in the hallway. Harry glares at the back of his uncle's head and contemplates jumping on his back
Harry is curious by this custom, though not as much as to know who these people were to his parents. He knows Minerva McGonagall to be the Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts, should they be the same person. Sirius Black sounded somewhat familiar to Harry, though unsure where he heard of him.
"Fine! But I expect you to leave as soon as they're here and don't you dare come back, boy. One freak is more than enough, we don't want another one," he spits out viciously. Corvus just snorts and nods in acquiescence.
Fortunately, this year, Harry had all his books with him. Normally, they'd be in his trunk, which would immediately be confiscated by Vernon and locked in the cupboard under the stairs, but thanks to a little something Hermione introduced to him called Owl Order, he was able to buy a new trunk that was resizable with a tap of the wand, no magic necessary. He placed all his books, parchment, and stationary there before he left Hogwarts, shrinking his trunk and hiding it in his pocket, while his old trunk housed only his clothes, although he did pack some newer, well fitted, clothes in his new trunk, just in case he needed to run away again. One can never be too prepared and all that muck.
They were escorted to a grand set of doors and were let into an office with high ceilings, a desk, and armchairs in front of it being in the middle of the huge office, which was otherwise empty. They made their way to the goblin behind the desk. Corvus bowed and gave the same greeting he gave before, Harry bowing beside him somewhat clumsily.
Harry likens the ICW as the Wizard version of the United Nations, though he does not know what it means to be supreme Mugwump.
Beauxbatons was different, a castle just as big as Ilvermorny but with grounds as wide as Hogwarts'. While Ilvermorny gave off an educational feel, a boarding school in appearance if a rich, private one, Beauxbatons gave a fancy, elegant, aesthetic image. With beautifully carved statues in white, found within majestic gardens with lovely flora, and wood nymphs that serenaded during mealtime. Harry thought it to be extravagant and almost pretentious in its apparent opulence. Corvus agreed that the castle and grounds were a bit grandiose (the word made Harry's nose scrunch) but Beauxbatons was a great school for it had multiple clubs and associations that would enable a student to grow more than they would by simply attending classes. From muggle-like clubs like fencing, film club, improv, book club, and even science club and sewing/knitting club (they donated to charity and shelters), to wizarding clubs like Magical Arts club, Arithmancy, Runes club, Magical Politics Club, Duelling, even a Creature Rights club (Hermione would have been over the moon) and much more. Then there were the sports clubs.
Harry made his way to the Leaky Cauldron, rereading his letter every few times as he walked. It took him most of the day, going from the station to Charing Cross Road on foot. He used the last of his money to buy a map of London and was thankful that he brought food with him. He was already full with two sandwiches, used to eating small, and he still had one sandwich left. He already drank the juice on the train, as well as some water while he walked—his water was half empty now.
Needless to say, Harry could say nothing else. Still, even thru Corvus's petulance and complaints, Harry did not wish to prosecute the headmaster for this (not even including the borderline legal tracking spell). When Corvus asked why not, Harry answered it was because Voldemort was still at large and so, it would not be good for the people to lose faith in the Leader of the Light. Harry, though, still wanted answers and so would get them from the headmaster himself, privately and not in front of a large body of people. There was no need to air their dirty laundry to the whole wizarding world, after all.
He flinched at the harsh glare of the goblin and bowed his head if only to surprise the goblin so much he loses the sneer, and answers in as steady a voice as possible, "I would like to speak to the Potter's Account Manager, please."
"What on Merlin's na—" Corvus was cut off by a faint voice that echoed from somewhere within the walls.
A light supper over with, along with another round of potions, and Harry found himself in the shrunken nightclothes of his father. It smelled of pine, kiwi, and a faint scent that Harry swears he caught a whiff of in the broom closet.
Alrod nodded along to Harry’s plan. “Yes, checking the house for what you’ll need is a must. They have been unlived for quite some time, after all. Although you could ask the house-elves to buy the food for you, so you wouldn’t have to. I would also recommend you buy clothes. I’m sure you’ll need a whole wardrobe. Should I write down a list of shops?”
Little Harry snorts; quiet, shocked laughter escaping his throat. Older him chuckles with him, feeling something deep within him soothed by childish and innocent laughter. Gods, when was the last time he saw pure joy like this? The elderly and the young were of the highest death rates when the war reached its peak. It still was, even after years of war. But that would change now; Harry could feel it in his bones, in his magic and in his soul. Little Harry would change it all, save them all, and no one would know but him and the forces that be.
They took a short break to have lunch, a tray appearing on the coffee table. It held two plates of sandwiches, two bowls of soup, and two salads on the side. Alrod had some other…
“Ah yes, I forgot about that,” Alrod smirked, “The Blacks are very proud of their blood, you see, so someone who isn’t a Black wouldn’t be able to become Heir or Lord.”
Hedwig returns the next night, at Midnight, with birthday cards from Ron and Hermione. The Dursleys let him out the same day, on his birthday, so he could get back to work—er, his chores, on his birthday, like he does every year. He had a wonderful time telling them about the impending return of Harry's favorite (as if there was competition) cousin. He struggled to hide his smile when they paled; it was totally worth having his uncle screaming at him about how they would not accept more freaks into his perfectly normal home.
But a bigger part, the part that made Harry who he was, was glad, relieved even, that his cousin was loved, that he was able to experience love, care, and a family who wanted him, that when he was sent to a foster home who treated him right after the Dursleys gave him away, and then was adopted by a wizarding family that loved him and made him their own, without taking away who he was before, without making him choose between being a Potter or becoming a DeRose. And that smaller, darker part of Harry was silenced, surely and soundly, when Corvus had revealed how he had begged for his adoptive father to take in Harry, how his père had agreed readily, and how they tried to adopt him, to take him away from the Dursleys, how they were denied, firmly and forcefully, and how when Corvus would try, every year, to get visitation rights, were also denied, staunchly, every time.
“Yes, that would be the Black Family Magic acting up within you. Since it is less than half, you will not be able to easily control it—
The adults gasped as the Potter Lord ring appeared on Harry's thin finger. The Potter Lord ring, worn by Harry on his little, thin thumb, the thumb of a boy that wasn't even eleven yet.
Suddenly, Harry froze as realization struck. 1987… He was seven years old… The only thing notable that happened then was…
Harry inhales sharply, expression serious, "We're cunning, Harry, we have to be to survive in a place where we're unwanted, I had to be, to survive in a dangerous time. And now, now you're going to have to be cunning again, so that you don't come to that. Do you want to come to that? Do you want to become
"Master Goblin, may I ask what this is about?" Dowager Longbottom asks, the corners of her lips tugging down.
People, I have another inquiry! It is one I have been stumped over, time and time again! And I need your help this time!
Because, of course, the Dursleys don't want Corvus coming back. The Dursleys have always hated and feared magic, hence why they hate Harry. But where they hate Harry, wizard son of Petunia's witch sister, who has her eyes of emerald green, they
It was considerably early still, with 30 minutes left before the wills were to be read, so the guests all turned to each other to chat for the meantime. Harry listened with a trained ear to the conversations that floated in the air. Harry heard Lord Malfoy and Snape more easily, as they were closest.
Remus took a deep breath once more, his eyes losing the sharp edge they had when he glanced at the corner. He knew, deep inside him, even thru all the years that passed, he knew that smell. Wolves never forget the scent of their cubs. He didn't know why he couldn't see his cub (he had mastery in Defense, he could guess) but he knew he was there, just by judging how the scent had turned sour in panic. He forced himself to calm down and dragged his eyes away from the corner. No sense in making the cub panic. If he's hidden in a Gringotts office, then there was a reason for so. When he turned his gaze back to the front, his eyes meet with the dark-grey ones of Alrod. The goblin stared down at him from his place in front of his desk and the wolf in Remus refused to back down. He stared back until a mutual agreement was made and both males looked away.
Doing what Severus did best, he used his Occlumency to shove all dark thoughts aside and left only anger; anger was what he was good at, anger was the only emotion he knew well. He snarled, crumpling the parchment in his hands. His fierce onyx eyes determinedly found the beady eyes of Alrod, the same fire in his eyes, though much more hidden and subtler than his.
He instead focuses on Alrod and on the fact that their Will states, without a doubt, that Sirius Black was not the traitor the Wizarding World thought he was.
“Not if you do not wish to. You may see them when you go to Hogwarts. They reside in the kitchens, from what I’ve heard,” Alrod says.
!" Harry jumps up and straight to Corvus, who lets his bag fall to the floor to catch him. He practically melts in his older cousin's arms and for the first time in a long while, Harry feels safe, truly and wholly safe. He feels Corvus nuzzle the top of his head.
Harry, once assured his godfather wasn't dying from shock or premature heart attack, had turned to the person he was dreading to see the reaction of the most. Harry was surprised at the sight that beheld him.
Alrod makes a humming noise. “Not necessarily but many have tried to use it for more dastardly deeds; enough so that Ministry had it all outlawed, instead of just certain aspects of it.”
When the Dursleys return that day, they find an old cardboard box that once held the Potters' belongings, and an empty house.
He was directed to lay back and when Harry laid his head on the pillow, he forgot all about the taste as his eyes started to flutter shut.
For what seemed like the second time in his life, he did not wake up to his aunt's screeching or his cousin's deliberate stomping on the top of the stairs. Instead, he woke up to the gentle rays of sunlight on a warm, soft, clean bed, and a thick blanket that swallowed his skinny form completely. Downstairs, he could hear the sizzling of cooking oil and the soft clanking of pots and pans. After drinking one of his prescribed potions, Harry padded down to see Mimsy cooking.
Harry, so troubled with this news, couldn’t even begin to ask the questions he was screaming in his head. He couldn’t believe people would just throw someone in jail without even a trial. Harry wonders if that was a thing or if it was even legal.
When the goblin bank teller came back, he was accompanied by another goblin, this one staring at him more harshly than the former. Harry gulped, before bowing again, just to be sure.
Harry placed the envelope back inside the bag, resolving to read it later so he could take his time with it.
Not that he would be living with them for much longer, not if he could help it, he thought decidedly.
He was met with excited house-elves; the boisterous Gryffindor House-elves, the excited yet visibly-restaining-themselves-from-bursting Slytherin House-elves, the quiet Peverell House-elves, and some of the eager Black House-elves. Harry didn't go outside the country for the Black Properties so he decided against calling the remaining house-elves. He did, however, call on the one living in Grimmauld place.
He finds an old and slightly tattered blue backpack. He goes to the attic, seeing if he could score something there. He's never been to the attic before. His aunt never really let him; it made him curious.
"Mr Potter, are you aware you had just given us a bow that is meant for Lords?" She asked with brows raised, peering down at him. Harry fought down the urge to fidget under her gaze and nodded. Snape held back a snort.
Alrod pauses then shook his head, “It is unknown, though people believed it to be him, as, I’ve said before, he and your father were exceptionally close.”
Placing the ring on his left thumb, the young wizard waits with bated breath as he feels the family magic wrap around him, judging him. Not a few seconds later, the magic settles, giving him a cool feeling, like a breeze or breath in cold weather, magic like a black mist, almost tangible and giving him a familiar feeling, like the one he felt during those times he would be sick and in pain and like the next breath he would take would be his last. Harry shivers at the magic and memory.
The guests had started to leave, Amelia Bones being the first one out the door. She had an innocent man to pull out from prison and a retrial to plan (she was currently unaware that there was no trial to
Amidst the large manors, mansions and castle, Harry also had to categorize which one needed more attention than the others, which ones he could imagine living in, and the things he might need should move in.
"Harry's brows furrowed. "I've never received any mail from Gringotts and I don't have a magical guardian," Harry said confused. Corvus shook his head.
"Oh," Harry let out a breath of relief before suddenly perking up. "Does that mean you can use magic whenever you want?" He asks excitedly.
Harry was welcomed inside when he knocked, Alrod already sat on the couches. The goblin waved the young wizard to the opposite couch and greeted him good morning.
Naturally, it was Dowager Longbottom who spoke first. "It is a pleasure to see you once again, Heir Potter. I have not seen you since you were in diapers!" She exclaims, both hands holding on to a cane. Harry blushed at that but gave the bow that he had read was customary for Lords—straight body, palm over heart and neck bent forward.
“A full blood adoption would overwrite the blood of one parent, making the adopting parent your only second parent. Had Lord Black done a full blood adoption, he would have overwritten your father’s blood, making him your only father. But a partial blood adoption lets you have Lord Black’s blood flowing through your veins, without overwriting anyone else’s. This could be used for people who are related but not through blood, or when a triad relationship wishes for their child to be the child of all three, instead of only having two biological parents when they have three parents.”
Alrod had already explained about each house, how he would be the Lord of multiple, influential houses and the heir of one Most Ancient and Noble House. It was said that his mother was a muggleborn but a thorough search through the Slytherin ancestry records showed that his mother had come from a squib line in the family.
He quickly pens out his reply and doing his best to keep it nice and pretty. His hand wouldn't stop shaking. When he's done, he folds it and heads out to the backyard.
“Yes, and regarding our other Houses; I’m sure you’ve noticed that the Gaunts do not have vaults written in your test?” Alrod waits for Harry’s nod before he continues. “That is because the Gaunts went bankrupt ages ago and after two decades of no incoming monies, Gringotts closed it, as is the policy of Gringotts.”
But with his letter in his hands, the reality of it all came crashing down on him like a tsunami of emotions. He clutches the letter to his heart, desperately holding back on tears that threaten to fall. Harry hasn't cried since he was 7, he wouldn't cry now, not with the Dursleys so close.
Alrod turned to him, "Lord Potter, this is Healer Gurkrat. She will be the one conducting the cleansing and healing."
This would be the first time he would hear his parents’ voices, making Harry’s heart race loudly in his chest.
Gurkrat handed him a vial of liquid, instructing him to down it. "It will cause you to sleep through the process. This will take a while, Lord Potter."
“In regard to abilities, Lord Potter, most wizards that come from Ancient families have them. When a wizarding family goes to live for a long but undetermined time, as well as keep to their family traditions or customs, they begin to develop abilities or certain characteristics that pertain to that family. When this happens, they are then called an Ancient House.
Corvus gave a firm nod, "Then we'll do those here. I want all of those removed from my cousin, at once." Harry, meanwhile, could not ignore the situation any longer.
The goblin, much to Harry's relief, nodded curtly and hopped off his stool. "Wait here, please," he stated before disappearing behind the doors.
They moved in a series of great, big grand hallways that left Harry's head spinning and he doubted he'd remember where he was going or how to get back without a goblin guiding him, which, Harry thought distractedly, might be the point to the maze-like hallway. He remembers the caves the goblins use under the bank building and just how easily a person could get lost in it, were they to try and travel there outside of the mine carts. If Harry was a religious person, he'd pray for the poor souls who got lost in the caves of Gringotts.
horse racing, broom racing, archery, gymnastics, aerobatics (which was more like gymnastics with flare but in air, thanks to magic), and even owl racing (this had aroused a curious hoot from Hedwig and an excited chirping from Caligo who turned out to be the two-year champion of the game).
“Ready, Harry?” At the wizard in question’s nod, Alrod placed the parchment which held the will and memory of Lily Potter onto the sphere, the parchment disappearing within the sphere in a flash of light. Before long, a white mist flows from the sphere, forming into a misty miniature version of Lily on top of the sphere.
It should make him angry and yet all he felt was a numb sort of sadness. He wondered if his older counterpart knew of this and if he got angry. Did he know their father did not trust Albus Dumbledore? Is that why he told Harry to not trust Dumbledore? Did he even ever get the chance to hear their parent’s will? Their voices and how they said they loved him?
Noticing the eyes on him, Uldrick took a big breath and calmed himself. He regarded the two with a nod. "Gringotts offers services for situations like these, Lord DeRose. St. Mungos can remove the Tracking Charm but the removal of Horcruxes is a job for Curse Breakers, of which Gringotts have the best."
Harry grasped tightly at the hands that held his and tears started to pool at his eyes. With a hoarse voice, he clung to his cousin.
Corvus arrives and he's Harry's one-man army. Harry knows this and the Dursleys ard made to remember this once more.
' at the end." Little Harry nods; his eyes on the ground as he runs and memorizes the sentence in his head. With a final nod, little him gazes back at his older counterpart.
"How may Gringotts help you, wizards?" The teller asked. Corvus reached out within his pocket and handed the goblin a letter. The goblin teller read through the contents before giving a sharp nod.
Harry inhaled sharply, eyes widening. His grip on Corvus' hand tightened and his eyes grew distant as he stared at nothing in his shock. Corvus eyed him concerned but gripping back, realizing that Harry must be feeling pretty tumultuous finding out it was the headmaster of his school that had betrayed him like this. Corvus did not yet know the relationship between the two was different from a normal student-teacher relationship and how Harry looked up to the grandfatherly figure.
The Dursley couple were sitting in the living room when they descended, Vernon watching the telly and Petunia reading a magazine, Dudley was nowhere to be seen—probably ran off to a friend's house to hide, Corvus thought with a snort. The Dursleys' head snapped to them at the sound. Harry bit down a smile but Corvus showed no such hesitation in showing his amusement, smirking as aunt Petunia paled, bony fingers clutching at her magazine, and uncle Vernon pursed his lips and glared, a red tint appearing on his cheeks.
With a grim face, Alrod answers the young wizard slowly, his words careful, “You must know first, Lord Potter, that although Lord Black is in prison, it was not a normal imprisoning.”
Remus truthfully didn't need to be told, he had not gotten up from his seat even after the dismissal and was back to staring at the left corner of the office. Severus raised a brow and held back a sneer. Who knew what went on in flea-infested brains. Instead, he ignored the werewolf and went back to his seat.
“It is unlike the Metamorphmagus ability found within the Black Family, where it is an inborn ability that allows the change of an individual’s body without the need for spells, enchantments, or rituals,” Alrod explains patiently.
Harry rushed inside, hoping he didn't offend the goblin by bowing. He just thought that with the robes and the cloaks the wizards and witches wear, that the Wizarding world might be a bit traditional like that, so bowing and stuff. (Truthfully, the Goblin Guard was merely surprised because everyone usually ignore them when entering.)
"They're in Diagon Alley, sir, working. They told me to meet up with them there, and to get Tom the Barkeeper to open the way," he says, trying to make his voice sound like he's reciting the last part. The man's eyebrows rise to his hairline.
The chair tumbles to the ground as Vernon Dursley stands up abruptly. Harry doesn't wait for him to fully get to his feet—a downside to being overweight was the amount of effort it took to get up—and bolts up the stairs and to his room. He locks it—Vernon forgot to remove that one and lost the key, luckily—just as Vernon reaches the door and starts pounding.
"Harry?" Corvus called out softly to his cousin, Harry glancing back at him slowly and looking lost. "Do you wish to have him sued for this?" The question made Harry's breath caught, mind freezing and stilling.
"I have given you a month's worth, up until you go to Hogwarts. All chargers have been taken from your account."
Harry grabs the stack of papers and places them within his backpack. He is reminded of the shoulder bag his father left for him. Before he leaves the bank, he’ll grab the bag and some monies. He’ll check the properties later, and, by default, the house-elves.
Corvus grabs Harry's free hand with his own and turns to go upstairs, remembering that there was a spare bedroom there that they used to sleep in as kids. Upon reaching the second floor, he paused as he saw the multiple locks and cat flap on the door that used to be their room. He shut his eyes and inhaled deeply, a mantra of '
“The Gryffindor and Slytherin accounts are handled by the same Account Manager, who also handles the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff accounts, as well as the vaults for Hogwarts that the Founders had made unenterable to anyone, be it the Heirs, Lords, Ladies or Headmaster. It is, however, accessible to the Headmaster, although under heavy watch from the Account Manager, to avoid theft. The Ministry has the ability to investigate the vaults but only with a signed warrant from
. It was the first of many attempts but he never got as far as he did the first time, actually ending up in the neighbourhood next to them. He would always get caught by either patrolling policemen or a concerned, if not strange, adult that would always send him back to Four Privet Drive… even though he never told them where he lived. But he doesn’t remember ever meeting anyone that first time he ran away. He just knew he did and that wonderful feeling of adrenaline and bursting hope and then the next thing he knew, he was back in his cupboard under the stairs.
“Yes, Lord Potter. Horcruxes were made with the intention to escape death, using a method of tying down a soul fragment upon a container until it has ended its purpose or it has been destroyed. It will latch on to the mortal realm through the means of containers or hosts even, to further escape death.”
Alrod held out a hand for the parchment and Harry slowly handed it back, anger simmering still as he stared at Alrod with watchful eyes.
Harry sleeps through the ritual, carefully performed by the goblins and under Corvus's watchful eyes.
When he calmed, he opened his eyes and glanced at his older cousin. Corvus stared back at him, a small furrow of his eyebrows, eyes shining with concern, not pity, and a hint of hidden anger. Anger—not at Harry but—directed at the person who had failed his younger cousin so. His dear cousin, his only blood, who suffered through the Dursleys and who knows what, and was alone for the last nine years.
It was different from his mother’s, where he cried so much from feelings of loss, longing, and love. But with his father’s it was a mixture of emotions. The loss, longing, and love were all there but mixed in with amusement, admiration, curiosity, and then some negative emotions evoked from his words, like dread, anger, and sadness.
"I apologize, Account Manager Uldrick," Harry began, "But I truly did not know you wanted to see me privately like this, as I did not receive any letters or summons from Gringotts. I did not even know Gringotts sent letters to their bank holders." Uldrick scowled disbelievingly at this. Harry ploughed through with his explanation.
Though a bit short of breath, he gave the customary bow and greeting to Alrod, and sat near the professors and slightly to the middle, greeting each of them while nodding at Snape's and Malfoy's direction. Though Snape ignored it, giving the werewolf a cold glance. Malfoy was polite enough to give a shallow nod, though his face wasn't any warmer than Snape's. Harry frowned at this. Did they perhaps not get along? Older Harry had said that Snape was a spy and so certain appearances had to be kept, but he also did say that he was a bitter man with a burning hate for his father. Harry had been confused at first, how Older Harry had said to trust Snape when he had also said previously that the man did not look well upon Potters. When Harry learned Snape was his godfather, though, he was certainly willing to give the man a chance and try to trust in him. If both his parents did, surely, he could too? But Older Harry never mentioned his second godfather hating the other marauders.
Alrod seemed to be thinking the same thing for he said, “Well. It seems Lord Black will need that solicitor immediately.”
Alrod stood by and watched the emotions filter through his face, the pleased shock to numb surprise and disbelief to wonder to horrified surprise then to angry disbelief. Alrod grew concerned when the expression became angry and vengeful, blazing emerald eyes snapping up to meet his.
“We can make it seem as if Remus Lupin is the Regent of House Potter, up till Lord Black is given his trial and freed. Luckily, Lord Rings are charmed so that if a Lord wishes them to remain unseen, they shall be invisible to all but the wearer.”
! Not even the Dursleys would mess him up so—well, actually, they would, if they could, and in a way they did but that just means Dumbledore was as bad as the Dursleys!
Harry smacked his forehead harshly, fingertips at the ever-fresh-looking scar found there. He started to claw at it with his fingernails, sharp, red lines appearing at where his nails scratched, blood starting to pool at the surface of his scar, but Harry did not feel it, mind whirling with the realization that the murderer who took his parents from him, the monster that made
"Boy! How dare you use your freakishness in my house! Stop that at once!" Uncle Vernon bellows, making Harry jump. Corvus turns an indifferent gaze to the big man.
"We are now to hear the last will of the late Lord James Fleamont Potter and the late Lady Lily Joanna Potter. You are to keep quiet and all questions to yourselves until the will reading is done or you will be silenced in your seat if not thrown out for the disruption of an official will reading of a Lord and Lady of an Ancient and Noble House." Alrod seemed to stare pointedly at Dumbledore at this.
Alrod explained, “You own half of Hogwarts, yes. But that is in terms of property and land. The 20% you get is the monies all Hogwarts Lords get. 10% for each Lord or Lady, the other monies that go to Hogwarts will be for the staff and the upkeeping of the school and castle.”
Harry's train of thought was halted when uncle Vernon's voice echoed through the house in a scream. Harry jumped at the sound and Corvus immediately got to his feet, wand in hand and the other on Harry's shoulder.
There was a... goblin, in red and gold, guarding the entrance, who eyed Harry, and he blushed because he knew it was because of his clothes. Still, if there was one good thing that the Dursleys taught him, it was to be polite and respectful. So Harry bowed his head, surprising the goblin.
Harry had to guide Corvus a bit, as, although he knew where to apparate to, he had yet to enter Diagon Alley. He had gone straight to Harry once he arrived in England.
Alrod was a loss at this, not knowing how to explain to a young boy of only 10 years how his godfather could be the reason why his parents died.
Harry's train of thought was interrupted by a loud reverberating growl. Glancing beside him, where his honorary uncle sat, he saw Remus sitting tense and growling, hazel eyes now glowing gold.
The way it was hidden so called out to Harry and he cleared a path to get the box. When he removed the box, his breath stutters out of him.
Harry calmed himself when he saw Remus look away. He placed a palm to his chest, willing his heart to go back to a normal pace. He missed the stare-off of Alrod and Remus, as he had closed his eyes and counted back from ten. He also missed the suspicious glance Severus threw at the werewolf, Malfoy staring at his friend curiously.
Harry couldn’t tell if he imagined the softening of Alrod’s voice and he ignored how his body became blurry to Harry, instead, he took deep breaths, waiting till he couldn’t hear his heart beating in his ears. When he was calm once more, he grabbed the last Lord ring.
And after that, the next night after their trip, when they were lying on their transfigured beds, spent after an emotional day, where they shared their stories and opened themselves up in a way they had not done in almost a decade, and they talked, whispered, about lighter things, like their properties, Corvus' adoptive family, the sights he had seen, the countries he had gone, and some of the results in their inheritance test. Harry was awed at the tales his cousin sang, the travels he's been in, the sights he painted in his words for Harry to see. And a small, darker part of Harry cried at the loneliness of it all, wishing, not for the first time, that Corvus had taken him in too, that he could have been with a family that would love him as well, that would not hurt him, insult him, starve him or lock him away, ashamed and afraid of who and what he is.
"I'm back, Harrison," Corvus murmured in his ear, "And I'm never leaving you again." And Harry believed this to be the truth: Corvus had said so, so it is. Simple as that.
"Harrison, be a dear and grab the letter from my bag, please? I'm afraid I can't bend down, at the moment."
Seeing the young Lord's embarrassment, Alrod bit back his amusement and introduced the lad in his stead. Coughing, he caught the adults' attention.
"Harry," he calls to the still crying boy, "Harry, I don't have much more, you must remember my words, Harry. You heed them, alright? You can't let anyone else's words influence you, control you, do you understand? I have to tell you what you have to do, okay, do you understand?"
Corvus smirks, eyes flashing towards the Dursleys as he answers, "Anytime and anywhere, petit vert." The Dursleys pale at the statement.
They had returned at Number Four almost seven hours after they've left. The Dursleys were all deep asleep by then so they did not wake after their quiet return.
The three wait for a while for the writing to stop, Harry gazing on in awe as words form. When it stops, Corvus and Harry grab their parchments and read through them, Corvus more to check while Harry eagerly reads his history.
Alrod sneered at him still, "We will have to prove this, Mister Potter, I am sure you are aware. Where is your vault key?"
Bowing, he tried to imitate the greeting, "Um, and may yours as well?" Harry tried not to grimace at his blotched excuse for a greeting.
All set, Harry set out to go on his first-ever shopping trip. With Mimsy bidding him a safe trip, he went out the door with a big grin on his face.
Since the next few stops were actual castles, the number of rooms and floors were ridiculous, the lands it sat on were already vast enough that it would take half a day to walk through the entirety of it, much less having to walk through 6 other caste grounds. Harry decided to just pop by and ask the elves stationed there to make a list of repairs or needs for the properties.
The Peverell box was a black stone with gold linings, spiraling on the edges, and the crest in the middle front; etched in the stone, a circle within a triangle, and a vertical line in the middle.
Harry decides then, that he wouldn't let his relatives bully him any more, not in his own house. It wasn't home; it would never be home to Harry. But he lives there too, for heaven's sake; he would not be bullied within his own house.
“You must simply wear the rings, Lord Potter, and the family magic within them shall see if you are fit to be Lord of the house,” Alrod explained, pushing forward the oldest house, Peverell, first.
They repeat this five more times before Harry feels his head clears and his breath returning. His vision returns—
Vaguely, he could remember meeting a strict female goblin and Alrod smirking at him amused. He also remembered chanting, and darkness, and then later, a fierce, agonizing pain that seemed almost distant and dull to him now. He then remembered where and why he was there.
Without taking his eyes off the parchment, he asks, “And the other percentages are, like, my share of these businesses?”
Young him would have flinched back then, a stranger trying to touch him... but he wasn't a stranger, was he? They were the same and one person. If there would be anyone who wouldn't hurt Harry, it would be himself.
"I think it's pretty hilarious," a voice says from the door leading to the hall. Uncle Vernon's head swivels to the side, and Harry gapes at the tall, young man at the door. He had medium length, black hair brushed back, revealing piercing, silver eyes, with aristocratic features, high cheekbones, strong jaw, and rosy thin lips with a beauty mark near it. There was a black and red rucksack hanging from his shoulder.
With that, Alrod places Lily Potter's will into the sphere. From the corner, he sees how most of the room sat up straight, Severus taking a deep, fortifying breath, while Remus looked to be determined, steeling himself from his own emotions. Harry understood them both.
It was because of this, Corvus wisely dropped the subject and any mention of Dumbledore was strictly professional and brief. Harry appreciated this, wanting more time to lick his wounds from the sting of the headmaster's betrayal.
Harry nods and they then discuss the abilities portion of the test. Since Harry was new to magic in terms of knowledge, Alrod explains for him.
Madame Bones and Dowager Longbottom, as Harry now knows, take their seat in the middle, between the professors and Lord Malfoy, not exactly near to either but not as far as the others. They nod and exchange greetings with the others and they respond in kind.
Harry nods. “I’d like to see them but preferably later—maybe after I found a house to live in,” Harry answers with a wry grin. Alrod snorts at this but acquiesces, not denying it would be better for the young Lord to have a place of his own first, where he can comfortably read.
He got in line and discreetly watched the people around him. Some were in fancy, silken robes, and stood impeccably well, back straight and signet rings on fingers. Some were more laid back, some wore robes while others didn't, and talking loudly with each other, though a few of the fancy-looking ones gave them subtle stink eyes.
“Serve them? Like… slaves?” Harry asks, uncertain. He breathes out in relief when Alrod shakes his head.
Half an hour later, Harry was as dry as a prune and cleaner than he's ever been. He had never felt so relaxed. Harry thought to himself that he might just get addicted to baths, ridiculous the notion might be. Well, it wasn't as if anyone would know—and no Dursleys to make deprive him of so.
what to write because before any thought solidifies in his head, he's already finished writing. He turns to Caligo, the black owl already staring at him.
“House-elves are Magical Creatures who are bound to a Wizard House or family and serve them,” he explains.
"How did you get in here!?" Aunt Petunia shrieked, pointing her bony figure at the older Potter boy. Corvus merely raises a brow.
Uldrick narrowed his eyes, "Heir Potter does not know who his guardian is?" Harry shook his head negative.
“May your gold multiply, Lord Potter, and may your enemies cower before you.” Harry jumps at the new phrase but Healer Gurkrat has already left, leaving the young Lord in front of the lard double doors.
"Your choices can change everything, whether you ever realize it or not—I sure as bloody hell didn't," he shakes his head ruefully.
Harry thinks this through but then hesitantly asks Alrod, “Would it not be possible for you to take them, Alrod?” Which makes Alrod pause and blink in mild surprise, though he feels as though he shouldn’t be with Harry Potter. Instead, he nods his head, gratefully.
Alrod is shocked at this, not at the muggle phrase but by the calm and levelheadedness of a supposed 10-year old boy. ‘
“There are a few things to explain, Lord Potter, about your lordships and properties. Since you were muggle-raised, I shall explain the basics, but for the finer details, your magical guardian should be the one to explain. Do you have any questions before we start?”
"And does Handsome have a name?" Harry asks. The unknown owl pushes his leg forward and Harry sees a golden bracelet of sorts on his leg.
Older Harry sighs and runs a hand through his hair, "I won't lie to you, Harry. Some will try to control you, and they will try, very hard, but if you stay true to yourself and remember my words, you'll be alright, everything will be alright."
Mimsy was notably calmer than the triplets. She had short-cropped black hair, pulled back by a clip, and wore a violet uniform with flower embroidery at the bottom, and at the back was what Harry assumed to be the Marauders' crest.
"Well, then. I suppose we ought to get your vault key taken care of, Lord Potter," Alrod takes on a serious and all business tone, "This will take only a moment and will require a bit of your blood to override the old one and make a new one keyed only to you so that no one else but you will be able to use the key, even if they should have it."
"Rest assured, Severus, I am just as unaware as you," the blond Lord says. To anyone who didn't know him as well as Severus did, they might have assumed him stoic or even bluffing. But Severus saw different. He saw it on the slight widening of his eyes and the subtle raise of his eyebrows. Lucius was wearing his 'I'm perplexed but I'm also in public' expression.
"I assure you, Lord Potter, Gringotts knew nothing of this. We would not let such an old customer as the Potters be messed with like this, not to mention all the other names behind you."
For almost ten years, torturous years filled with watching over misbehaving children and dunderheaded teenagers—when he can barely tolerate adults on a good day—all in an effort to be there for when Harry Potter, spawn of his childhood enemy and once-childhood friend, finally comes to Hogwarts and watch over the child so he stays away from danger and stays alive. Almost ten years of asking, pretending not to give a damn about the well-being of a boy, a
"You go to London, to a pub named Leaky Cauldron in Charing Cross Road. When you arrive at Diagon, go to Gringotts, the bank. It’s white and huge, hard to miss. Aunt Petunia knows the way. I know you're afraid but you have to get her to take you. If she won't, and you think you can go on your own, then go. Be smart, Harry. We have always been smart; don't let anyone stop you from showing it, not anymore."
"You are awake sooner than I expected," Gurkrat stated, making Harry jump at the suddenness of her appearance. He did not notice her come through the door, and when exactly had she arrived for her to be beside the bed already.
Alrod gives him a look, "Quietly, if you will, Chief Warlock." Dumbledore only smiles at him benignly, taking a seat right at the very front. Alrod holds back a sigh. This was why the goblins didn't like him. He talks too much, does and says unnecessary things, and never tries harder for the betterment of the people he says he cares for. Albus Dumbledore liked to play god in old, mortal flesh. It was tiring as it was annoying. He was a good man with a power he does not use. Basically, a waste of time. And every goblin worth his knut knew that a waste of time was a waste of gold.
, of hearty and bookish best friends and red-haired families, and of men turning into dogs and rats and werewolves, and little him eats it all up with awe and wonder and hope because Harry isn't a freak, he's a wizard and no one can tell him otherwise who and what he is—
"Did you know about this?" The little Lord asked, childish voice gone cold and quiet in his fury. Alrod’s eyes widened at the sight, eyebrows furrowing in agitated confusion.
'. Harry had the small thought to omit some things from his older cousin but a sharp glance halted that idea before it could bloom. Harry never could lie or keep secrets from Corvus. His cousin knew him better than anyone, even after all these years, and was too observant to blindside.
Remus gave the dour man an unimpressed glare before rounding his eyes at Harry, eyes going soft with worry as he stared at the young wizard. "Harry?
He nodded in thanks and grabbed the parchment, unrolling it to see a few words written on it in red.
Once seated, he turned to Mimsy. "Will you eat with me, Mimsy?" He asked. Mimsy starts at the question and gives him a long look before nodding her head and sitting at the table. Beaming at her, Harry turned to study his food. Pancakes, omelettes, sausages, yoghurt, muffins, and a bowl of assorted fruits. Harry took a bit of each while Mimsy took to the sweet side; pancakes dripped in honey, yoghurt, muffins, and fruits. Harry dutifully drank his potions before he dug in. As he ate, the young lord decided to pack some muffins with him on his shopping trip.
"Hello again, handsome," Harry greeted softly, reaching out from beside Corvus to rub the pad of his finger on the beak of the black owl. Caligo puffed and crooned under the attention, nipping at Harry's finger gently. Harry was cooing at the soft but spoilt reaction of the bird when they were interrupted by a loud and impatient screech from behind. Corvus raised an eyebrow as he turned, glancing at the appearance of an impatient but beautiful snowy owl.
, Harry's mind supplies) would hear. Harry's hand rises to touch little Harry's hair, right where it hides his scar. The younger winces in recognition but says nothing, does nothing, because young Harry can see the same scar reflected in front of him.
The Potter ring, the one Harry was most excited and nervous over, his father’s ring, and his father before him. It was a copper signet but more rectangular than circular, leaf etching on the sides and the family crest on the middle. Within the band, however, were the words
“How do I get Sirius a trial, Alrod? Criminal or not, a trial should be fair and given to all. I would like Sirius to have at least that much,” Harry states, eyes flickering down to stare at the floor.
Alrod gazed at the boy, mature beyond his years, and wondering, not for the first time, how life could deal him such cards and yet remain so kind.
A letter. He should write a letter, reply back to him. He has no idea what to write but as he makes his way to the desk and grabs a bit of parchment and a biro pen, he realizes he doesn't really need to
Harry had noticed that both shops had some books about him (which creeped him out and irked him) and the young Lord planned on discussing that with Alrod.
"I—" Harry couldn't seem to find his voice, face pale and hands shaking. Harry was saved from responding when a goblin entered the office through a side door, carrying a stalk of parchments and papers with him. Uldrick took them with a nod and the other goblin left with a bow. Uldrick settled the parchment and letters, before getting two from the pile. He cleared his throat, passing the parchment to the two.
“Do you have any other questions, Harry?” Alrod asked. Harry shook off his embarrassment and read his test once more.
that was spreading in waves coming from his cousin. Strangely, seeing his usually calm and collected older cousin losing his temper settled the nerves that Harry was feeling. Oh, he still felt completely and utterly betrayed, not to mention confused and wholly lost. There were some things on his test that he did not understand, like the curse scar, the life debts, or the—Merlin, what even—marriage contract between him and
when she knew exactly who he was and who his master had been... Severus would have sobbed at the thought. He forced them behind thick occlumency walls, knowing that his wonderful, brilliant friend would not have done such a thing had she known who it was that sent the Dark Lord after them, in the first place.
"Wicked," Harry breathes out, and Corvus' eyes soften, glancing at his younger cousin in fondness and protectiveness.
Needless to say, Kreacher cut back on his cutting remarks, apologizing to Harry and listening to his orders quietly. He was asked to clean and maintain the house, to make it befitting of the Black name. Harry remembered that Grimmauld Place was in unstable conditions so he'd ask Alrod or the Black Account Manager for a list of names or services that could help. Kreacher objected—mildly due to the glares of the others—at first but Harry said he wanted the manor to be back to its glorious splendour and that would only be possible if an expert would see to the house. Hearing this, Kreacher reluctantly acquiesced.
It was ten minutes till the will reading when the double doors to Alrod's office opened with a bang. Everyone jumped in their seats, Harry jumping the highest. At the doors was an old man, with long white hair and beard, wearing pink and turquoise robes, accented with bronze embroidery. His breath came out in soft pants as if he had run all the way here. He gave a small smile when he saw everyone there (Severus and Minerva noted it was a bit strained).
Corvus was still of the belief that maybe a little less faith in the man wouldn't be amiss. Harry sensibly ignores this.
Satisfied, he opened the door and pulled in an startruck Harry, not even pausing at the barren sight of Harry's room. Corvus was surprised there was anything at all—granted, they were old, and looked like they would break easily if any of the Dursley males were to use them, but it was easier to transfigure furniture than it was to make it out of nothing so he didn't mind them.
Minerva had cried. It was such a James thing to say, she couldn't laugh because even though it was his voice and memory, it was not him. She was a godmother and she had failed them both, Lily, James, and little Harry. She refused to be ashamed because she didn't know but she still felt her heart break for what could have been. She wiped her tears with a handkerchief that she brought, accepting the pats Pomona had given her, the Hufflepuff Head also with tears in her eyes. Minerva wouldn't even begin to describe her feelings for poor Sirius.
"That's who you are, is it not?" He said shyly but a hint of cheek could be heard in his voice. The women snorted at that.
Harry stares at Alrod, mind racing a million thoughts, eyes glazing over before clearing again. He relaxes and his eyes lose their intensity, nodding once.
Alrod stared at the young wizard in front of him, righteously angry but also wound tight, distrusting, and unsure of who to turn to. The goblin shook his head.
. It's him that would be doing the laundry anyway. And so what if he wouldn't be eating the dinner he cooked? He wouldn't be allowed to eat it anyway.
Dumbledore was similarly shocked at the news. His heart clenched at the thought that Sirius was in Azkaban for a crime he did not commit. Poor Sirius, who had been his student and then had been his ally in the Order. The old headmaster was near in tears, to know that he had failed Sirius so. When he had first learned of the Potters' death and how Sirius had been the one to betray them, his heart had broken for the bright young man he had once known and thought he knew. He had turned away from Sirius, forcing him out of his thoughts, ignoring the heartbreak of friends turning against each other, a tune Albus was overly familiar with. But now? All along, Sirius was not the traitor who betrayed his friends to Voldemort. And now Albus' heart was breaking again, this time because of his own actions—
When he had returned, Harry was still on the floor laughing, cheeks aching and stomach cramping at the continued laughter. Corvus merely smirked at him, a familiar glint in his eyes, as he waited for Harry to calm down. When Harry had controlled his laughter and had managed to get himself up, Corvus then shifted his looks again. Straight, blond-white hair, same silver eyes, and his small straight nose elongating ever so slightly, making it look pointy and defined; Corvus looked like he was brothers with Draco Malfoy.
"You're going to have to reply, Harry, send it with an owl," Harry sees the question on his face so he explains, "There'll be an owl waiting, I'm sure. Go to the backyard and look for it. Raise your hand with the letter and it'll take it to Hogwarts for you."
The Potter account manager nodded, pleased. This made Harry flush and duck his head in embarrassment. Alrod snickered but said nothing on the matter.
Harry did not know how to feel for this defeated-looking old man. He knows Older Harry had warned him not to trust the Headmaster but was that really what his counterpart meant or was it just a result of an ending, limited time they had? Regardless, Harry felt as if he should make his own opinions for himself. He wasn't going to make his plans (whatever plans he may have or make) known to Dumbledore anytime soon, but he'd wait till he knew more of the man before he judges him.
Everyone noticed how the goblin failed to go into details about the 'issues' that he mentioned. Harry huffed quietly to himself, growing a sense of awareness about his account manager's sense of humour. The others probably didn't notice how the goblin did it on purpose to pull on their legs.
Harry's eyes danced, confused, and panicked. Tom Riddle. He knew Tom Riddle. His older counterpart told him about a poor, orphan boy that lived during the Second World War named Riddle. How he came to a world where he would be accepted and not called monster or freak, and how he was found to be lacking if only because of his name. How he wanted to change the world he lived in for the better, only for his life to spiral out of his control and forget who he was.
“Healer Gurkrat,” Harry breathed out once he was calm. He looked at the elder and strict Goblin and bowed his head, “Thank you for your help, Healer Gurkrat. I’ve never felt better in my entire life.” And it was true. Now that it was gone, Harry was able to notice that he’d lived his life in numb pain, aches all over his body from within.
Hands grabbed his unyielding, caging them in and away from him. Harry fought the hands restraining him, panic bubbling at his chest that resulted in loud, rasping gasps.
"Yes, uncle Vernon?" Harry asks steadily, appearing by the entrance of the living room, near the kitchen and far from grabbing hands.
Hearing this, Corvus tightened his arms around him. He did not say anything in response, knowing Harry was truthful, as he often was. Instead, he kissed his younger cousin's hair, gave him one last squeeze before moving back, knowing Harry wouldn't be comfortable for long, in the presence of the Dursleys.
"Before we go further, Lord DeRose, Heir Potter," Uldrick explains, "An Inheritance Test shall be required first. One for Lord DeRose's file for the British Bank of Gringotts, and one for Heir Potter's, since he had not been able to when he was born."
In Harry’s opinion, this was already late, in terms of waking up. He was used to waking up with the rising sun, after all. It was easier to wake up on his own than to be woken up by aunt Petunia.
"Dowager Longbottom," Harry greeted. The adults raised a brow at this, Snape sneered. McGonagall spoke before her coworker could say anything disparaging.
"Hello, there, lad. Where are your parents?" He asks gently, leaning on the counter to better hear the small child's answer.
Alrod didn't respond, merely raising his hand to the corner where Remus still stared at. The other three glanced at where the goblin gestured, only to blink back in shock as a child started to appear from what was previously empty space.
“While some wizards will say so, in truth the relationship between a wizard and house-elf is one of convenience,” Alrod explains, “House-elves have strong magic but need the magic of a wizard or a Wizarding house to stabilize theirs, otherwise, they’re magic will grow unstable and then deteriorate. In exchange for being bound, House-elves will serve the family, mostly by maintaining the house or properties of the family.”
"All minors have a magical guardian, as per the law issued by the International Confederation of Wizards' Magical Children Affairs," Corvus then explained that was like the UNICEF or Children Social Services of the wizarding world. "Muggleborns, and some half-bloods, have their Heads of Houses, Professors or Headmasters as their guardian, and orphans from an old wizarding family like ours are appointed a Magical Guardian to teach us about our family history and wizarding customs. As an heir, you would have been taught your duties, the law, how to draft a bill you want to be passed, how to write legal documents, and how to become a proper Lord of your house." Harry's head, by this time, was throbbing with all this new information—about things he, apparently, should have known years ago.
Alrod stands and announces, "The wills of the late Lord and Lady Potter have been read. All bequeathed monies will be transferred to the individual vaults of the beneficiaries." Alrod then gestured to his side and two goblins stepped forward. "Gnarlwolf and Gruffraff will hand over the other tokens bequeathed upon you."
Harry winced at the amount he'd paid but reminded himself that he could afford it and it was not a waste as it was for his health.
"I also wish to speak to the Potter Account manager," Corvus stated before the goblin could call out to another goblin. The teller gave him a sharp glance at that, and his sharp stare went to Harry, his gaze flicking to his forehead before flicking back to Corvus.
Harry fidgeted in his seat, playing with his fingers, as the adults in the room stared at him in various states of shock or wonder. Alrod gestured for Harry to come forth so Harry carefully stood from his seat and made his way over, prompting the professors to gather themselves and blink back their surprise.
“Harry… It was believed that when your parents went into hiding, they used a Fidelius Charm, a spell to conceal, to hide a secret, the secret being the home you once had in Godric’s Hollow. This secret is contained to one person, only they know what the secret and, therefore, only they could share it. They are called Secret-Keepers—“
magic. It showed, not the forest view from outside, but a glorious beach ocean view, the water a wonderful cerulean blue upon white sand.
"Well," he wets his lips, "What should I do?" Harry was not used to staying still, he was also not used to not doing chores early in the morning to late afternoon. Since he was 6, Harry had been constantly moving.
"We're heading out for lunch," Corvus announced, wrapping an arm around Harry's shoulders which were starting to shake, "No need to wait up. We'll let ourselves in later when we return."
T-triad? Wait, what-what does that mean? Does that mean that instead of one mom and dad in marriage, he had one mom and two dads? Did that mean his mom was with both his dad and Sirius? Or was it his dad with both his mom and Sirius? Was that even possible? Harry didn’t know that was a thing. Surely, they didn’t go all together because his Dad and Sirius were boys and uncle Vernon said—
My head was a right mess while I was writing this chapter—it was aching and everything. I apologize if there are some mistakes in this chapter! I took a lot of breaks while I was writing, though, so don't worry!
Harry glanced at Alrod and the goblin nodded, escorting him out. They rode through one more (fun) cart ride and then made their way back to Alrod’s office.
? "I must apologize if I seemed hostile a while ago. Gringotts does not appreciate liars and swindlers. They are a waste of time—time better spent earning gold."
Corvus had even revealed to planning to steal Harry into the night, only stopped by his père, voicing how, even if he were to succeed, they would be labelled criminals and how the British, with how they coveted Harry so, would never let the matter go, making his and Harry's possible future harder than it should.
Alrod raises an impressed brow. “Exactly, Harry. As is the case with most Magic, light, neutral or dark. Though there are exceptions, of course.”
Alrod grins at him from where he is seated beside him. Harry was distracted by one of a flash of fire and tries to swivel his head to see it, but the cart goes too fast. Harry wants to think it was a dragon he caught a short glimpse of but dismisses the thought.
Harry nodded and asked, “How will we get this to the ministry, Alrod? I assume they need to be informed for Sirius to get his trial.” Alrod inclined his head.
"I have read only your name and your parents’, you may read the rest while we await your new key, Lord Potter."
"No one is above the law, Potter," Severus cut him off, "No matter if you think it's necessary or not, hurting you was also unnecessary and yet they had done so as well. And child abuse, no matter the form, is always punishable by law. No one is exempt from it."
“How do I get rid of these charms on me?” Harry eventually asks when he was calm enough to speak, the room that had gone cold without notice returning to its original temperature.
He would also have more power over Hogwarts than the Headmaster, as he would own 2/4 of the castle; his vote over the policies and rules would be greater than the Board of Governors’ and the Headmaster’s, and only the unanimous votes of the teaching staff, Board of Governors and the Headmaster could overrule his.
Soon enough, the pair finished their breakfast and Harry was setting up to go. Harry decided to take his messenger bag since it had an expanding charm, which would surely help in his shopping. He'd go visit the bank after, or if he ran out of money, perhaps give Alrod a gift, for all his help—maybe even one for Healer Gurkrat. He'd have to talk about Grimmauld and Grim House, too.
This one was a tall man, with long white-blond hair, tied back with a blue ribbon that went well with the dark blue robes he wore. From the description Alrod gave him two days ago, Harry assumed this to be Lord Malfoy. He had with him a black cane with a silver snakehead, that Harry found to be brilliantly wicked. He wondered to himself privately if he could do the same when he was older, maybe with a stag head or a dog? Harry was cut off from his musings when the older Lord gave a short bow and the customary greeting to Alrod, the goblin repeating it in kind.
The Gryffindor box was circular and of dark redwood, with golden frames and rubies; the crest was red and gold, a standing lion in the middle and a knight‘s helmet on top.
Ron and Malfoy aware that their actions were uncalled for. But then the next day came and Malfoy had glared and sneered at him, and Harry resolved to have nothing to do with the prat unless necessary. That, too, did not work out as planned.
And how could Harry say no to that? As a ten-year-old, of course, he wouldn't even think to ignore the law
"No, that was not what happened," Uldrick agreed, his scowl softening. The Potters nodded and grasped each others' hand, Harry looking for support and Corvus readily giving it.
Marauders' Den was fun. It was significantly smaller than the rest of his properties but just as big in regards to land and just as jaw-dropping. It was a group of treehouses, way up on the trees and deep within the forest. They were connected by bridges and were painted colourfully. There was a house for each marauder (his dad had a viewing tower on his that Harry absolutely loved) and it was well-maintained by the house-elf Mimsy.
A head with a nest of unkempt raven locks rises, revealing wide and bright green eyes, innocent eyes. Harry Potter, ten turning eleven, stares back at a man with the same shade of green eyes and the same mess of raven black hair. His head cocks to the side and Harry, 20, does the same, unconsciously.
It had black plumage, freckled with white, almost silvery, spots, with a heart-shaped facial disc and round, black eyes. It was smaller than his Hedwig, it looked to be 40cm at least, 50cm at most, whereas Hedwig was 58cm. It was a complete opposite to his Hedwig, dark with light spots, to Hedwig's light with dark spots plumage. It's eyes were the most captivating though; a dark brown, almost black, big, round and widely open, it looked as if it was staring straight at your soul.
Harry frowned and stared at the floor, cracking his head to try and remember if there was ever an instance where his physical appearance made a drastic change when his eyes widened and glanced up at the Potter Manager.
He hands the wizards a small, sharp knife. "Three drops of blood for each parchment," Uldric explains, mainly for Harry's benefit. The Potters nod, Corvus going first then cleaning the knife with a spell and handling Harry the knife. Harry swiped the knife at his index finger, letting three drops of blood fall on his parchment before handing the knife to Corvus to clean and placing the bleeding finger in his mouth. Corvus clicks his tongue, taking Harry's hand and closing the wound. Harry smiles at him gratefully. Corvus rolls his eyes fondly.
Harry rakes his eyes over himself, young, small and so innocent, trusting the him that was older but still the same person as himself, and Harry decides he should explain some things first.
"Oh? Not pretty?" The owl squawks again, "Ah, handsome then." Harry lets out a silent laugh when the owl huffs and puffs his chest out. It seems all owls loved being praised then.
I wrote this chapter and the next on paper first and I didn't notice until I retyped it all in AO3 that I wrote it down as Chapter 5 and 6...
"I take it you've seen some things that did not please you?" Uldrick asked, prompting Corvus to growl, much to Harry's surprise—he growled, like, actually growled! Uldrick seemed surprised by it, too, his eyebrows reaching the top of his head.
Corvus ignores Vernon splutters as he faces Harry, who had then paled. He furrows his brows in concern.
When Harry snaps out of his daze, he grabs the paper and pen by the far side, deciding that it would be faster if he finished that first. He might just stare at his letter for hours if he read it now. He didn't have the time.
“Those are nutrient and supplement potions, as well as stomach-soothing potions. Take the first two before each meal, the stomach soother after waking up. Make sure to eat only thirty minutes, no less, after taking the stomach soother or it will have the opposite effect instead, Lord Potter. Among them are bone-strengthening potions to further fix your weak, brittle bones, and another nutrient potion made specifically for them, which you will drink every night,” Gurkrat explained readily, “You will have to drink these potions for the next half-year, Lord Potter, before you can be considered borderline healthy. You can stop the stomach soother after a month and a half at the least, if you never miss a meal and your potions within that time, three months at most if you do any of the aforementioned as well as get sick or injured."
Harry’s stomach settles, then. He was nervous about meeting them, as they were close to 200, but now that he knows he didn’t need to meet with him for now settled his nerves.
Harry had no idea what a Lord was (he had an idea but was unsure if the muggle version of lord applied to wizards), which boggled Corvus and prompted an educational discussion over lunch—they found a café called Witch's Brew Café to dine in.
"Master Harry is up!" She squeaked, making the half-asleep Harry jump. She states, "Mimsy did not expect master Harry for another hour." Mimsy was a Marauder elf, but she was also the daughter of Master Prongs' Nanny elf. She was used to the Marauders waking up sometime before noon so seeing someone awake at the break of dawn surprised her greatly. There was also the fact she's been alone for more than ten years now.
Harry's worries were put on hold when he saw Remus take a deep breath, only for his head to snap to the other side, right at the corner where Harry sat. The young wizard froze in his seat as his eyes stared back at the werewolf's eyes, almost as if he was looking straight at him. Harry panicked for a minute, thinking that the spells on him had fallen. It couldn't have possibly fallen, right? Alrod said it wouldn't!
There are better times to think of these. Harry shakes his head to dispel the dark thoughts, forcibly pushing them away to deal with later.
His thoughts were interrupted by happy chirping, Caligo hoping this way and that, twittering about with pleased, squinted eyes. A glance at Hedwig saw to her preening her feathers, seemingly ignoring the smaller, joyous owl.
"Madame McGonagall, if you would please remain. There is an issue I wish to discuss with you, as my Account Holder's godmother." Minerva pauses at that. She inclined her head to her coworkers to go without her as she turns and makes her way back to her previous seat. She wonders if this has to do with why she was not made aware of her status as a godparent. Her theory is almost cemented when Alrod calls upon the other two males as well.
Harry blinks up at him before he snaps out of it and grabs the fallen rucksack from the floor. He nudges around inside, jumping a little when his arm goes deeper than expected. He glances at Corvus questioning.
Harry paled a deathly white as he listened to his cousin, dread pooling in his stomach, bile gathering at his throat. Harry's breath came in quick, harsh pants as the ramifications all but slammed into him.
, Lord Potter, for the Will Reading,” Alrod makes to stand, Harry, doing the same. He bows and Harry follows suit.
He realizes this and he grabs on to the lapels of his older counterpart, frantic, panicked. Not yet, not yet,
Also... I'm a bit conflicted. Where do you think Harry should live? All the houses besides Marauders' Den and Oaken Ranch are hardly fit to house a single person, let alone a child. Where do you think he should live?
When he was in front of them, Harry couldn't help but blush, looking at the ground instead. For some strange reason, Harry suddenly felt awkward, like he was wearing too tight clothes. He had never felt this before so he did not know that he was feeling shy over meeting his godparents.
Severus had never been more shocked. When he had received the summons for the Potter will reading, he had, at first, thought it a mistake, for surely both Potters would want nothing to do with him, not after the war. He had thought, back when they died, and that there had been no summons, their wills had been read and Lily did not mention him at all. Now he knows their will was only being read now and that he was to be there, after all, he still couldn't believe it.
Harry sighed in relief, following Tom as he led the way to the entrance to Diagon Alley. They came to stand in front of a tall wall and Harry watched the sequence he tapped on the wall intently. Harry really thanked whatever god granted him for easy memorization skills. His jaw dropped as the wall disappeared like a waterfall within his very eyes, showing a crowded street of people.
Harry sat in shock as the words processed in his brain. He didn't even have time to be shocked that his name was actually Harrison or that he had godparents when the other things on the list caught him off guard. Like the fact that he was a lord, a real Lord, of multiple titles, that he was rich, that he has multiple places to call home, or that this Dumbledore person his older self had warned him about placed weird charms on him—not to mention that marriage contract with that girl he had never even met!
I'm really trying not to make it seem like Corvus and Harry have this co-dependency thing going on. They don't. They just haven't seen each other in so long and their feelings are a bit overwhelming, as it had been put on pause for almost nine years.
Remus' breath went out in a whoosh, catching Harry's attention. Harry glanced at him and the older man gave a small smile, to which Harry gave a hesitant one back. Emboldened, Harry straightened his back, fingers clutching the hem of his shirt and tried to greet his godparents hello.
Harry smiled at the thought of being Corvus' ward but frowned at a part of their plan. "What do you mean about the guardian bit?" He asked, cocking his head to the side.
Why did Older Him tell Harry about this? Surely, he must have known who Tom Riddle was. Did he know about the Horcrux? He said something about searching for containers. Was this what he meant? But did he know the one on his forehead? Probably not, as he didn't really elaborate on what a 'container' even was.
“Which comes to another thing, Lord Potter,” Alrod added, snapping Harry out of the same train of thoughts as he. “While I was investigating this, I found that your parents’ wills have been sealed. Normally they should have been read a day before their burial.”
The older him doesn't need to see his younger face to see the shock in his eyes—lots of surprises, it was to be expected. He sighs and begins to explain his story. He has until morning, when Aunt Petunia wakes and opens the cupboard door, when little Harry would start the day with his list of chores.
Still, they had fun catching up these past two days, tales of each other's lives keeping them up at night, days spent learning about etiquette and customs. Harry relished in the simple act of being close to family, one that he loves and is loved by in return, and getting to know each other once again. It was something he hoped he would get with his godfather, Sirius—which was something Harry yet to have told his cousin. Only so many things you could talk about in two days, after all. He resolved to tell him when they were in the Burrow. As it was, both Potters were waiting for the Weasleys to show up, anticipation coursing through them as they waited. Harry, for being able to introduce the family that practically took him in, to the only family he had ever known before, and Corvus, for seeing how the Dursleys would react to a family of wizards coming by, especially as rumbustious Harry told him they were. Both were equally thrilled just to be leaving Privet Drive.
, who would have meant nothing to him if not for being the legacy of his mother, his first-ever friend and one of the only two women he had ever loved. Almost ten years of being told that the boy was fine, happy and
Originally, Corvus thought, as the last two Potters in Britain, Harry would take his Lordship when he reached his majority, but without the proper knowledge of his duties, all Harry would be us a name figure—Corvus refuses for his dear younger cousin to be something as insignificant and foolish. He'll have to teach Harry everything within the span of three years, five at the longest. As it is, he'll have to teach the basics (customs, tradition, etiquette) to Harry this summer.
"As it is, the Potters' will reading is about to commence. I suggest you take a seat, Chief Warlock." Alrod gestures to the seats.
, coldness and darkness like the Peverell ring’s surging but different, cold, like aunt Petunia when she would look at Harry, and dark, like his cupboard when he’d hide from uncle Vernon, the place he was too big to be able to grab Harry from. It made Harry want to be sick and he feared he would before the magic settled, even more, the bad feelings disappearing, though not with the memories it evoked.
It was where Harry found himself now, tucked into his dad's bed of red and orange, thinking of all the things that happened this day.
a murderer at eleven, and almost took his best friend's sister's life, was inside of him and the repeating thoughts of
Harry nodded slowly. “Yes. It was when I was 8, aunt Petunia cut my hair real short, practically to my scalp, and left only my fringe aside to hide my scar,” Harry’s hand unconsciously went up to touch his now-faded scar. “I remember being so embarrassed and upset, I went to sleep wishing that… my hair would be back to its regular length again. It did the next day. Aunt Petunia was really mad about it but I was too relieved that I didn’t even mind being locked back in the cupboard for the next three days. Since my hair always did that, I just… forced myself to believe my hair grew
are being met with legal reparation for the mishandling, neglect and abuse of an Heir and now Lord of an Ancient and Noble household?"
Harry turns bashful, ducking his chin to his collarbone. He clears his throat, a pink tint on his cheeks.
It was also during then that they'd found out that Harry had not received a single letter from Corvus before the one he had sent almost a week ago. Corvus had sported a heartbroken expression, grieving that his younger cousin had possibly thought that he had been forgotten and abandoned all this time, never once receiving the letters and gifts that he had sent him. It was exactly what Harry had thought, when he was younger and years had gone by without a word from his cousin, so he had no words to comfort him. Apparently, the only reason why he was able to get the letter Corvus had sent last was that he used a bit of blood magic on it; only those with the same blood would be able to read it and, as an unintended side-effect, would allow Calligo to find Harry wherever he was (due to the shared blood between Harry and his human) and get past any wards he was in or under, Calligo being able to do so as he was Corvus' Bonded Owl.
Harry didn’t really feel it when Alrod said, “Congratulations, Lord Gaunt,” though he was thankful when the goblin gave him a glass of cold water.
Before Harry’s thoughts could spiral deeper, Alrod answers. “It merely means you have a proficiency in it, Harry. When or if you learn any healing spells, charms, or runes, you will take to it easier and more natural than someone who does not have it as their Family Magics. That is not to say that you are a prodigy, or that you already have the ability or knowledge to use Healing Magics, or that only people with Family Magics can excel in certain areas of magic.”
Which, Harry thinks, isn’t really helpful, at all. It seems foreboding at most, paired with the hoarse drawl of Alrod. Harry feels like he should expect as much from Goblins.
how befitting," Harry snorts quietly to himself. Caligo shifts to his other leg and pushes the right one forward to Harry. He nodded at the black owl, "Thank you, Caligo," he says before he grabs the small, rolled up parchment attached to his leg. He unravels it and reads the short message, his eyes roaming down to the signature at the bottom and froze.
"This isn't something you shouldn't not know, though," Corvus pointed out, "Harrison, you should have been learning this as soon as you could read. How to be a proper heir of an Ancient and Noble House, to be its future Lord, how to manage your vaults, starting with your trust vaults, laws, tradition, customs, and family history! This should have been taught to you by your magical guardian.
Harry watches as his uncle's eyes widen slightly, head turning to his wife. Unsure but unwilling to do anything not normal, aunt Petunia acquiesced. Harry felt like leaping in joy when his uncle nods his head curtly, looking unpleased but relenting nonetheless.
Gnarlwolf set off to the left to give Severus, Malfoy, and Dowager Longbottom their parts. Gruffraff went to the right to give similar bags that held their tokens to Remus and Minerva. Once done, they went back to the corner where they were stationed. Alrod nodded at them and then turned back to the beneficiaries.
on him? It was said they were applied yearly on him, since 1987. That was when he was, what, seven? Why would that man even—
Corvus glanced at him questioningly, waiting until Harry nodded before he let go, bending to grab his trunk, rucksack still in Harry's grasp. He then turns to the huddled family, lips quirking when they flinched.
Alrod replied, "Gringotts has services for these sorts of things, Lord Potter, as well as St. Mungos and any capable Wizarding Hospital. Of course, it will be quicker here. I would recommend having a cleansing here."
) weeks because he bore the mark of a madman. When he had been released (vouched for as a double agent), he had still been on house arrest for two months and was heavily watched by the DMLE and had an agent from a British ICW agency to conduct bi-weekly check-ups on him for a year, especially since he became a member of the Hogwarts Staff.
The goblin from before came forward, a small glass vial in his hand. Harry took it and squeezed his finger, letting the vial fill with his blood. The goblin nodded at half full, and Harry took his bleeding finger in his mouth, the wound pulsing at being milked. The unknown goblin flashed his sharp teeth in a smirk before waving his gnarled hand over Harry's and stepping away. Harry popped his finger out, shocked to see the wound gone.
The Potters left without waiting for a reply, although they did catch the quick transformation Vernon went from pink to purple. Both of the Potters' shoulders were shaking by then and as soon as the door shut closed, the dam broke.
How many times has Harry longed and been denied something as simple as a chance? To be called a delinquent and a troublemaker, a liar and ungrateful brat, never given a chance to even prove otherwise, people believing what they hear at face value.
He went inside the pub, playing with his fringe, lest he gets sighted—although he shouldn't really, no one would see as he had covered it up with a Band-Aid.
Corvus, with his darker than black hair, pale as death skin, and bright silver eyes that's glare was as deadly as a basilisk.
"On the bed, Lord Potter. Let us get started," Healer Gurkrat ordered. Harry obeyed without question, though he had to use the step stool by the bed to reach it.
"May I introduce, Harrison James Potter-Black," Alrod announced firmly. It just made Harry blush more and Alrod couldn't bite back the smirk from his face, which Harry saw and pouted at him for (He was probably going for a glare but he looked more like a sulky child than anything).
Wearing a new set of shrunken clothes, this time from Moony's closet, provided to him by Mimsy, Harry came back out to see the quiet house-elf placing breakfast on the table. Mimsy nodded at him, using her magic to move the chair back for Harry. He smiled at her in thanks.
The Dursley patriarch goes silent at that, paling at the thought of having to deal with two freaks in his house (and one that can use magic freely, at that) for one more month, before looking at his wife. Petunia purses her lips, seemingly just as displeased with the thought before nodding her head. Vernon nods back, turning to glare at the two Potters.
Leaving the owls to it, Corvus turned to the younger. "You have a very intelligent owl, Harrison. Quite the character too, from what I've seen," he complimented, a small smile forming in response to the beaming one Harry gave.
Uldrick growled but said nothing as he rummaged through a drawer. He took out a piece of parchment and wrote something on it, before placing it inside a box on his desk. He then stapled his gnarled fingers and placed his attention back to the Potters.
"Petit vert? What's wrong?" He asks, placing his palm to the younger's cheek. Harry grabs at his shirt.
Harry flinched back. "That... That would be bad, right? I mean, it being removed, that is. Wreaking havoc and trying to possess people and all that," Harry asked with a grimace, not wanting to be a burden being second nature after years with the Dursleys.
"Something bad is going to happen, Harry, in the future. A war; a horrible, horrible war," little Harry's eyes couldn't be any wider, "But you can stop that, Harry, if you listen to what I say."
Harry was on the floor, laughs turned into wheezes, tears running down his face, as Corvus levitated his uncle and placed him in his room, reviving him and then spinning a tale of how he was having a nightmare and shouting in his sleep, making Corvus run and check up on him, thinking he was being attacked. Vernon easily fell for it. He had screamed, shouted profanities at the other Potter, the apparent object of his nightmares, and ordered him to leave. Corvus did so happily.
Hermione had explained this to him. How she would send her consciousness through time, when he would be able to warn himself, to change time, history, stop the war before it even begun. He would be tethered to a time, any time, where his younger self would be. Harry chose to find the him before it all started.
"Um, h-hello," Harry inwardly cringed at himself for the weak greeting, "I'm Harry. It's nice to meet you." There. That wasn't so hard. Harry patted himself on the back when he saw McGonagall smile and Remus' smile widened. Snape merely raised a brow but he wasn't frowning, sneering, or glaring so that was an okay thing too, right?
Alrod gave him a rundown of the monetary values: 29 knuts to a sickle, 17 sickles to a galleon. 1 galleon was £4.93. Harry short-circuited at this and struggled to do the math in his head. Alrod dropped a bigger bomb on him he announced Harry had 1.8B galleons in the Potter Main Vault alone, not to mention the other older
trial). Dumbledore and the professors came out next, a subdued headmaster nodding to Alrod in passing while Minerva and Filius Flitwick said their goodbyes, Sprout trailing behind them.
Remus had laughed, a choked sound escaping through his tears. The tears had formed after Lily's will was done and had fallen sometime after James' had started. It felt as if his heart was breaking again, only this time it was slowly being mended at the same time. He couldn't believe James but at the same time, it was such a James thing to do. But mostly he couldn't believe himself. He knew his and Sirius' relationship hadn't been the same since that incident in their sixth year but that it would have let them doubt each other so much like this... Remus wondered if this guilt would ever disappear. He knew he'd not mind if it never did.
Harry nodded gratefully, the last bit of tension releasing from his body. "Is there a reason why it's faster here than in a hospital?" He asks tentatively.
Harry Potter sits and stares at intricate, ornate boxes. Six boxes are placed on the table in front of him, each with its own designs and symbols. Each box is connected to Harry through the family he has never met, as well as through one man on that fated night.
Alrod raises his brows and stares down at the young wizard, making Harry struggle not to fidget. From the use of his title, Harry takes this as a formal request so Harry nods and promises not to overestimate himself in things he did not yet understand.
Hedwig gave a doubtful look at Corvus, not even paying attention to the black owl, perched on the desk. Corvus simply stood still as the wise, golden eyes of the owl studied him dubious. Seeing the look, Harry merely chuckled.
Harry eagerly takes it all in, knowing that Alrod specifically chose those families that were, in some way, connected to him.
designs; silver snakes coiling on the sides, emeralds on each side of the signet, the Slytherin Crest in the middle. Like before, it judged him as soon as it was placed on the left middle finger, taking a full minute unlike the first two. When it settled, it made Harry release a breath he didn’t know he was holding, leaving him with a sense of coolness, like freshwater, reminding him of a flowing river, and giving him a feeling of satisfaction, like a plan gone right or
“The Black Accounts do have an Account Manager, his name is Bloodsmear. As for the Peverell Account. It has been dormant for centuries and so has not required an Account Manager until now. Should I recommend someone for you, Lord Potter?”
He fixes breakfast, Dudley whining at the back, and gives his uncle his coffee, before slinking back to a corner of the room. The Dursleys ignore him, his aunt back to her Dudley-doting self. Harry moves to go out the kitchen but his uncle catches sight of him then.
Harry nods at this, glad he asked, though he also didn't really believe he had much of any of those. He picked up the knife and swiftly nicked his finger, letting three drops of blood fall on the parchment.
Harry then grabbed a few galleons and sickles, placing them inside the front pouch of his bag. He glanced around the vault for anything else he could bring but the vault was too big; Harry resolved to get a list of all his possessions from Alrod later. Instead, he asked Alrod where he could find the journals his mother left for him. Alrod walked off and came back holding three notebooks, tied together, with a letter on the top. Harry thumbed his name written in red, the calligraphy of his mother as striking and beautiful, and Harry could only hope he could have handwriting as pretty as his mom's. Like his father's letter, he placed it away in his bag to read later.
The Potter cousins' bubble was popped when Uldrick suddenly let out a string of curses in Gobbledygook. The cousins stare at the cursing goblin with slightly wide eyes—Corvus had forgotten he was there in the short amount of time he was checking Harry and Harry too had forgotten while he was being checked by an overprotective Corvus.
It was a short trip to Gringotts, being in Diagon Alley and all, though it was crowded, as usual. Corvus was not impressed with the crowd and resolved to find if there were any other magical districts in the UK.
"In regards to money, as the Heir and only Potter—in Britain at that time, that is—you should have been getting mail from the Goblins at Gringotts," Corvus explained, frowning.
"Harry came to Gringotts three days ago," Alrod began, capturing the shock adults' attention, "He was without his Gringotts key so he was required to do a blood test, which then revealed issues that have since then been solved. It was what prompted Lord Potter to attain his Lordship."
"Snape. Trust Snape. He's a right old dour git, and he can be mean, but he's on your side, Harry. Even if it doesn't seem like it at times, he's on your side, if only because he was friends with our mother."
Corvus, though, remains unimpressed. "Then you should have closed and locked the door," he deadpans.
Alrod asks if he was done reading, to which he answers affirmatively. “Have you any questions about those, then?” The goblin then asks.
Alrod nods, "Yes, like lands and houses, businesses you have a share in, and marriage contracts, if any. There are also spells and curses cast on you, should there be any, as well as potions and the like."
He nodded his head in understanding. Gurkrat had him changing back into his clothes before leading him to go back to the room he was in previously with Alrod. The Goblin Healer bowed to Harry.
“Unfortunately, once it is removed, it may try to wreak havoc or to try and possess someone, as the main soul part will not be in the near vicinity for it to return to. As opposed to simply destroying the container, which would not allow for the soul shard to exit. A method we cannot use as destroying the container would mean, well, killing you." Alrod continued to explain.
Harry could live with that. He lived by that phrase, back in the Dursleys, having to do a lot of things in secret so he didn’t get punished for it.
"May your gold always flow, Master Goblin," Corvus greeted, giving a short bow with a fist over his heart. The goblin gave the same short bow and replied in kind, "And your coffers never empty."
The women gave firm nods from behind Remus, and even Snape had nodded too. Seeing this, Harry glanced at Alrod, who gave a nod. He gestured for the adults to be seated again before addressing them.
you can control it. There is also a chance for the percentage to rise if you were to dabble in self-human transfiguration but that poses many risks to the body and I would advise you to refrain from dabbling too much and definitely not before you’ve started to learn about it in Hogwarts, at the very least, Lord Potter.”
The goblin nodded in acceptance and then turned to Harry, "Your key, Heir Potter?" Harry handed his key and the goblin called out to another goblin to escort the Potters.
Harry didn’t know when but he had been crying for a while. Perhaps the tears formed when her face formed or when her voice called out, perhaps they fell the moment he said his name or when she called him my son. All he knew was that he couldn’t focus on the tears, in fear he would miss even a single word his mother spoke.
Truthfully, Remus was struggling to keep himself still so he wouldn't smother his cub within his arms, growling and snarling and all; seeing how shy his cub was, he knew he'd not be comfortable with physical contact just yet. Admittedly, he was also keeping still so he did not rush out and kill the people who had dared hurt and neglect his cub, his best friends' son.
“We may not need to, Harry. All names mentioned, even just in passing, will be called for the official Will Reading. One of those names is Madame Amelia Bones, the Head of The Department of Magical Law Enforcement-DMLE, for short. She will, most likely, do that for us. Madame Bones is unlike her other fellow wizards in the Ministry, in which that she is fair and just.”
Some may say that I was a little too mean to the Dursleys, some may say it's just what they deserve—I'll leave the decision up to you but just know that I was kinder to them than they ever were to Harry!
Severus' iron mask seemed to crumble more and more as Lily's voice and memory spoke, starting from when her form appeared.
Turns out, most wizarding places had this sort of nobility or families that are firmly involved in the country's history, politics, or governance. It was nepotism to the highest degree in some places, Britain especially, but Lords and heirs, although involved with politics, were not automatically Ministry Officials, just members of the Wizengamot, and this made learning how to pass laws or not easier as a Lord or guardian could just teach their heir the ins and outs of the Wizengamot.
Seeing the souring expression of Snape and the bewildered gazes of the rest, Harry decided to show his Potter ring—Alrod had advised against showing all of them, believing it to be better to keep it hidden as a sort of trump card (Harry believe the goblin also wanted to see what would happen when Harry would reveal it later).
“There is also the prospect of healing any illness or health risk upon your person, as you would need to be somewhat healthy to unbind your core; it would take another half day," he adds. The next part seems to come more hesitant than the rest, Harry notes. Alrod’s eyes flicker to Harry's scar as he says, "And then there is also the matter of your scar, Lord Potter."
He nods, "Yes. And Sirius and Remus are friends of our fathers. They will stand by you, will always stand by you. The goblins, they're a neutral party, they won't lie to you. Trust in them, even when it's hard, but whatever you do, and I mean this, Harry," he grabs his younger counterpart's shoulders and stares at him gravely.
Alrod stares pointedly at the werewolf. "It would seem Mr Lupin already knows the answer to that." At this, Remus inhales sharply.
"You're asleep, Harry, but so am I," older Harry explained, "I came to visit you, you see, talk to you a bit—warn you."
This time, the next to come were two tall, serious-looking witches. The younger woman had a monocle on and wore prim, dark red robes, while the elder wore a vulture hat and carried a bright red handbag. Harry couldn't help but gawk at the hat, a part of him thankful for the charms on him as he doubted he would not offend the older lady with his gaping. Unlike the others, he did not know the two and listened attentively when they greeted the Potter Account manager, although they had different greetings. The younger one merely greeted him with his title while the older used the goblin greeting.
"As well as, I have just recently found out I am an heir to a Noble and Ancient House," Uldrick froze in his seat, so Harry gave one last push, "Just today, in fact."
Harry hid a grimace as he nodded. He thanked her again to which she waved off. She instead handed him a few potions.
Alrod places nine stacks of papers in front of him, side by side, while the remaining was pushed away from the group.
Making up his mind, Harry breaks the rules for the first time in his life. He makes himself some food. He makes sandwiches and gets two juice boxes and a water bottle from the fridge, a thrill going up his spine knowing that it would be a noticeable loss in the fridge but he'd be long gone when the Dursleys' notice. He goes up to Dudley's second room and scavenges for a bag Dudley no longer used. Harry could take one of his cousin's nice bags but Harry was no thief, even if his relatives would say differently.
And when he felt his uncle Moony's arm go around his shoulder and squeeze him oh-so-gently to his side, Herry pretended that his eyes were not wet as his chest filled with warmth from the people that were so angry for his behalf. And Remus pretended he did not feel when Harry pressed his face to his side, hiding his teary eyes, or the way his fist clutched at his robes.
“You can go to each property through the Portkey in your rings. Simply touch the ring of the House you wish to go and state what property you will go to.” Alrod then adds, “A Portkey is an enchanted object that upon touch will bring you to a set destination instantly, no matter how far. It is either time or password activated.”
"Ah, I see everyone is here. Wonderful, wonderful," Dumbledore greets, clasping his hands with a clap. He looked at them with twinkling eyes under half-moon spectacles. "Although I do wish I was as early as you all, it seems that my invitation had come in last minute," He added, a disappointed and an almost-admonishing look on his face as he looked at Alrod. The goblin in question only raised a brow, covering the scowl his face took on when the heavy doors banged against his office walls.
Harry winced. Surely, he didn't have to show it as some sort of verification, did he? Though, he supposed that was easier than showing papers he did not have as proof.
It was the trip inside the bank that put a bit of pause in their purposeful stride. It was hard to have a purposeful stride when you had to wait behind a line. It made Harry a little embarrassed, going in strong like they had, even the tip of Corvus' ears were red. Thankfully, it wasn't as if they burst open the doors or anything. They just walked looking like men on a mission and no one really noticed that in a bank.
When Harry tried to point out how busy the headmaster must have been, a futile attempt to make the good man appear a good man still, Corvus had bluntly refuted him.
Harry made his way to an antique long table that held rucksacks and messenger bags. Harry went to the newest looking one, a leather messenger bag, with an orange-red front pouch that had the Potter crest on it, with copper rings, rivets, and buckles. Inside there were pouches that he could fill with stationary, and in the middle, he saw notebooks—possibly the journals his father mentioned—a folded piece of parchment, and an envelope. He took out the envelope and saw his name scrawled on the front in blue ink. The Boy Who Lived traced the letters of his name individually, imagining his father hunched over a desk as he wrote down his letter, tongue slightly poking out like Harry does when he concentrates.
"You best behave yourself, boy, and I better come back to a clean and whole house or it's your back on the streets, you hear me, freak?" Vernon threatens by the door as they leave, Petunia already in the car.
Harry smiles shyly, "I'm sorry for scaring you; I'm just used to waking early, is all." It's ingrained, really, at this point.
Older Harry nods; no way to sugarcoat it. Harry never received a straight answer for his life, always having to find and solve mysteries and riddles and receiving half-answers from twinkly eyed, old men. Maybe things wouldn't have reached this point had someone just told it to him straight.
' repeating in his brain, as he fought down the anger he felt at the sight of the Dursleys' treatment of his family.
Everyone else was also in a state of shock and disbelief. Minerva was shocked that, all along, she was Harry Potter's godmother. She had not known and the thought that little Harry could have been living with her and not with those muggles positively broke her heart. Why wasn't she told of this? Remus, as well, was shocked at what he had received from Lily but no so much as he was shocked to find out that Sirius wasn't the secret-keeper. Peter Pettigrew was the secret-keeper and the one who betrayed the Potters to You-Know-Who, not Sirius Black. Amelia cursed when she realized that Black was in Azkaban for a crime that wasn't his and wondered to all nine hells how the Ministry was not aware of this.
"What?" Severus questioned bewildered. Though perhaps he shouldn't be, he was the boy's godfather (And wasn't that just a strange thought he needed to get used to—like,
That didn't even count the special events like art contests, poem or story writing, and even rock climbing and obstacle course racing. Those were school events where any student was free to join, regardless of club or association.
Harry smiles, “I would appreciate it. Thank you, Alrod.” The goblin waves off his thanks, grabbing a parchment and writing for a few moments. Harry waits until he’s done, folding the list and placing it in his bag when it’s handed to him.
"May your gold always flow," she said, giving a short bow. Harry jumped at the unfamiliar greeting and looked to Alrod for what to do. He was met with amused eyes and silence. When he glanced at the goblin healer, he saw a heavy frown and judging eyes. He blushed.
Aight, so I have no idea where I'm going with this. Fair warning, updates will be sporadic because this was more of a prompt that got way out of hand, though I already do have plans for chapter two, so...
“Oh,” Harry’s eye widen at the knowledge, “Is that why they’re not listed down in my Inheritance test?”
Uncle Vernon shoves the envelope to Harry's face, showing every bit of it covered in stamps. Harry's lips twitched upward as he valiantly fought off a smile. Uncle Vernon noticed and Harry straightened his spine immediately, his uncle's spittle flying as he shouts at him.
14-year-old Harry Potter wasn't what you would call a normal teenage boy. For one, he was a wizard and in the Wizarding World, he was known as the Boy Who Lived. In the muggle world, you'd think he'd be considered normal there, if only because he wasn't a celebrity there. Instead, because of the lies of his magic-hating muggle relatives, he's known in Privet Drive as sweet Petunia Dursley's delinquent nephew with mental problems and goes to St. Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. And inside the walls of Four Privet Drive, he's otherwise known as...
"But they didn't—" Harry cut off his words when Severus' eyebrow only raised higher in his disbelief. Harry could defend that the Dursleys didn't mean to hurt him—uncle Vernon had no control over his strength, it's why he's not allowed to touch aunt Petunia's delicate china—but another glance at his Health Scan had him grimacing and so he gracefully shut his mouth.
When Harry checked some of them, they seemed to be filled with some odds and ends, letters, parchments, quills, empty inkpots, and some books. Harry saw some he thought he’d be able to use:
Nodding, Harry asked, “You said magical guardian—in my inheritance test, it stated that Dumbledore was an unsanctioned guardian. What does that mean?”
Harry watched as the old house-elf faded up to the heavens in glowing lights, like fireflies floating into the sky. It made a glorious sight with the setting sun.
Alrod shakes his head, “I do not see why we should. It is better to keep such things quiet and in our favour.”
richer families he was now Lord over. Harry did the smart thing to do in situations where one was overwhelmed.
"What?" He voiced out, confused. The potion master turned his sneer to him, though he lost the fierce glare in his eyes.
Next chapter! Things are getting interesting and more characters are introduced! Is this possibly the road to a family and happiness for our dear Savior?
Nodding, Harry let the goblin handle it, dropping the subject for now. They then moved on to another important matter that had been sitting for just as long as Sirius had.
This one, Harry definitely knew. He was practically in every picture in Marauders' Den, and Harry had stared at those enough to be familiar with the kind hazel-green eyes that belonged to the man who had entered the room. Remus Lupin was a tall man, with light brown hair that was flecked with grey, and had scars cutting across his face, though they were faint with age. He wore patched-up robes and seemed almost dead on his feet, like a man that had just recovered from a long illness. Harry worried for a moment that his honorary uncle was ill and dying when he remembered that there was a full moon on Friday, the day he had gotten his Hogwarts Letter. He had seen some books on lycanthropy back at Remus' and Sirius' Dens, but he had yet to read them, so he didn't know how much the moon affected werewolves, outside from a loss of self.
The older Potter nods, ignoring the Dursley patriarch's sputtering 'he will not!', and answers with a simply, "Of course."
“That’s possible?” Harry squeaks, eyes wide in surprise. Alrod nods, telling Harry he simply needs to wish it and it will be so. He does so and looking at the rings, though he could still see it, there seems to be a faint mist or shimmer over them, his Heir Ring the only one still visible.
Alrod inclined his head, forcing his expression to be one of mussing and neutrality, instead of reflecting the anger he felt stewing inside. He does not alert the young Potter Lord as the goblin is sure Harry was not aware of what he said. He took a quiet and deep breath before forcing himself back into the discussion.
"You have to understand, Harry," Corvus began, "What your magical guardian did, it's not just negligence, it was illegal. They practically abandoned you, with no knowledge of who you are in our world, all the while holding some sort of power over you, and, to some point,  your accounts and estates. They also receive a bi-monthly stipend for your care, your needs and wants," he finished with a small frown, reaching out to grab Harry's hand. Harry squeezed back, frowning hard at the table in front of him. The implications were obvious and Corvus didn't need to point it out needlessly. Harry received nothing from that stipend, he received no care, not a penny was spent on or for Harry, not from the Dursleys or his magical guardian.
"Harry," he rushes, "Harry, I have no more time left. Remember this, if there is anything my life has taught me, my friends and family,
Alrod guides him towards the vault and, once the vault doors were open, Harry’s weak legs went weaker at the sight. Mountains of coins, gold, silver, and bronze; shelves of books, letters, chests, and jewellery; paintings of what Harry assumed were to be ancestors; various artefacts were placed here and there on top of, what seemed to Harry, priceless antique furniture. Harry saw that there were even statues of varying sizes!
"Boy! What's taking you so long!? What are you lazing about with the mail for!?" His uncle bellows from the kitchen. Harry exhales then, his tears gone as soon as it came.
It was bigger than the Dursley's master bedroom. It had cream walls, white tiles, cherry wood cupboards, a separate shower, and stairs leading to a bathtub that could only be described as a small pool. It had windows that Harry refuses to believe isn't anything
The young Lord wished he had had the chance to get to know the wizened elf before he had to go but Harry saw and felt through the bond between him and all his house-elves, that Zeppy was truly happy and content with his life, and was ready to go to the next and last big adventure.
cousin, Hedwig. The one I was telling you about a while back? This is him," Harry explained patiently. Hedwig bobbed her head and understanding before turning her unblinking gaze to Caligo, Caligo standing quite still like his human had only seconds ago.
It turns out, they don’t need stairs; they have carts that go down rails in rollercoaster fashion. The fast twists and turns had Harry gripping tightly to his seat, heart beating almost as fast as the cart itself, and a grin threatening to split his face in half. The sharp turns they take made giggles escape his lips.
The women, too, were having a hard time keeping to themselves. How could a ten-year-old child have such a health record? And most illnesses seemed to have been neglected and left on it's own—by Merlin, the child tore a ligament on his ankle because of a sprained ankle, at the age of four! In the wizarding world, that only ever happened to professional Quidditch players or Aurors; all were of older age and had dangerous occupations. Not to mention the illnesses that he had had; most of these practically unheard of in their world. For Godric's sake, the child has had more bruises than Minerva has ever had and she's nearing 60, was a Gryffindor and survived a war!
After a short catching up—Harry learned that Corvus had been adopted by a magical family after a bout of accidental magic made first adopted family aware of magic, and had been in America and then France since then—they were interrupted by a loud gurgling sound.
“Fifteen minutes past seven, Lord Potter. You were not expected to wake till eight, at the very least.”
Corvus's hand is warm as it rubs up and down his back, Harry leaning on the wall in the alley they apparated at, eyes closed and breathing hard as his stomach rolled unpleasantly. He'd have vomited if he had anything to throw up.
Harry inhaled and straightened his back, his face clearing of any hesitation, Corvus' eyes glinting with pride and satisfaction at the side. This was the Heir of a Noble and Ancient House, this was a glimpse of who Harry would be. Calm, quiet confidence, befitting of his station and exactly like his demeanour, not a boy who slouched and tried to hide away in the shadows from everyone—though Corvus loved each side of his cousin; he was proud of how he could shove his uncertainties and hesitation aside to face his problems head-on.
Harry flushed, arms wrapping around his stomach. Corvus simply smile but said nothing as he stood up. He cast a tempus, a glowing red '14:08' appearing in the air in front of him.
“This, I believe, is only applicable to those that can speak parseltongue and, of course, have magic. Unfortunately, I do not know how one goes about doing parselmagic, however, fortunately, there should be some books and journals about it in the Slytherin Vault. Would it be something you wish to have taken out of the vaults? I am the Potter Account Manager but I am not the Slytherin Account Manager so I will have to confer with her, anyhow, sooner or later,” Alrod says. This made Harry blink.
Harry intercepts before his uncle could shout out more unwelcoming words. He pushes himself a bit from Corvus and looks up at him. "Will you be staying?"
Starting with the Potter elves, Potter Mannor had three relatively young triplet house-elves. They were by far the most eager and energetic, being only a decade older than Harry—which was apparently young in elf years.
The Gaunt box was the plainest of the lot; African Blackwood box with snake carvings for a frame, one sole snake had one jadeite as its eye, the others missing theirs, the crest on the middle front; two shades of green with snakes coiling with each other.
Harry flushed at the attention. He nodded and answered the man. "I'm fine now, uncle Moony," he said softly. Remus's eyes went wide and then turned misty. Harry panicked for a minute, thinking he'd done something wrong but before he could apologize, Remus cut him off.
The Gryffindor ring next, a gold signet with the Gryffindor crest. Harry places it on his right index finger, feeling the magic of the ring judge him then settling quicker than the Peverell ring. It gave him a rush of magic, heated and bold, and the feeling he got whenever he got away with throwing sarcastic comments to his slow cousin behind the older Dursleys’ backs. It was a feeling that almost made him laugh, wondering why that feeling in particular.
“They are. Your shares in investments, which your ancestors invested in by either helping these businesses start, funding or kickstarting them,” Alrod explains.
"There aren't really many things you should or shouldn't do, Harry. Some things are out of our control—but us? That has always been ours to control," Harry explains, eyes hard and expression serious. Little him could only nod numbly.
He was just closing the door when he heard the flapping of wings on the other side of the room. Looking up, he saw that Corvus had opened the window and was just letting in his owl, Caligo. Smiling, he walked towards the pair.
The goblin glares at him intensely. His eyes flick up to his forehead and Harry winces but reaches out anyway to pull it off. Once revealed, Alrod stares at it, as if confirming its validity.
They walk for a while before they reach huge double doors. The inside was a large room, with two couches in the very middle, facing each other with a coffee table in the middle. Alrod takes a seat on one couch and gestures for Harry to do the same on the other.
on his that Harry politely did not look at it, lest he makes a face and offends the goblin who had helped him so much. Harry took his potions and promptly gagged, making Alrod laugh. Harry blushed and pouted, sulkily tucking in and ignoring Alrod's amused face. Once they were done, they went back to some of the things on Harry’s Inheritance Test and clarified the things there.
While he worked, he grabbed a piece of paper and dropped it by his cupboard, his actions as fluid as water. Anything else would cause attention on him that Harry just didn't need. Harry thinks about when he would write his reply to his letter when Dudley announces that he would be going over to Piers Polkiss' house, aunt Petunia chiming in about getting groceries while he's gone. Uncle Vernon, the 'loving, caring husband that he is,' states that he'll drive her. That only leaves...
Older Harry never spoke of mansions like Potter Manor and Black Manor, he never spoke of being a Lord and being overly rich, nor did he speak about houses in trees, and various house-elves. Harry thinks that his older counterpart never got to experience what he is now experiencing. He feels bad for his older self, to have never gotten this connection, this inheritance from his father.
They came back out into the hall and made their way to another set of double doors. Inside was a large room with only one long table and a small female goblin in white at its side.
Panting, he stares at the floor of his cupboard, his letter and the piece of paper he slipped in still lying there, Harry's key to freedom. He doesn't even care if there rests so much on his shoulders if he accepts the letter, anywhere was better than Privet Drive.
Privately, Severus thought to himself, that even he was not exempt from it—not that he ever thought differently. He shivered when he remembered the cold of Azkaban, thrown in there for two short (
"It is," he agrees. Little Harry's head snaps up, confused. He smiles ruefully, a bit apologetic. He knows it's confusing, as is always with magic this complex.
Harry takes the letter and paper with shaking hands, absentmindedly closing the door with his hip. He moves over to the kitchen table and only stares at the letter for a moment.
Harry, a young man of 23, crouches and sits crisscrossed, the boy, 10 turning 11, right in front of him. Harry looks around and he can see a little dingy cot under the boy, with a ratty old blanket and not even a pillow. Harry's heart aches with conflicting emotions. He hates—hated—this dusty, cramped space, a place no child should ever be in for an extended period of time, and yet... Harry aches with want. The cupboard under the stairs might have been a horrid place for a child to sleep in, but it was safe. Vernon was too big to be able to reach him there.
“Well,” Harry began, “I’m planning on checking out the properties you gave me that are habitable, as well as meeting the house-elves from each house. I’ll probably assign them some cleaning or maintaining work, nothing too big. Then, I suppose I could check to see what I’ll need after I found which house I’ll stay in—necessities, furniture, and possibly clothes, food. Then, when I’m settled, I’ll buy for my Hogwarts things.”
Noticing this, Corvus ruffled Harry's hair and reassured him. "The Ministry detected some magics being cast in a muggle home and asked if you used your wand. I had a letter prepared in advance, mentioning my arrival and emancipated status, while assuring that I used my wand away from unaware muggles."
"On your own? My, what an independent young lad you must be, ey?" Harry panicked for a second before the older man's words processed in his mind. "Well, just your luck then, huh? My name's Tom and I am the owner of this here pub! Come on, then, little one."
Harry only nods and watches his uncle shut the door, trying to keep his face passive and meek to mask any elation or excitement he feels. He's so close. He waits until he hears the car starts, waits until he can't hear the car anymore, and waits for a few minutes more, just to be sure. When the minutes pass and Harry can be sure his relatives wouldn't return for something they left, Harry makes a mad dash for his cupboard, wrenching the door open.
Nodding, Harry makes up his mind. He would have gained his lordships either way, but Albus Dumbledore has gone too far. Thinking about it, Harry realized that half, if not most, of the reasons why his older counterpart’s life became so depressing lies with Dumbledore. Hopefully, with his inheritances, he would be able to escape the Headmaster’s grasp and whatever reasons he had that he would ruin a child’s life so much.
The Potter Lord ring lay inside the orange-red ornate box, copper designing the box and the Potter crest on top; a stag head on the bottom, with its antlers lining the middle part of the crest, red and copper background, with swords forming a cross on the top.
As always, entering Diagon Alley was a dream for Harry, though he'd gotten somewhat used to it last summer. It was nice, though, to see Corvus slightly impressed with the charm and rune work, and how it opened like a waterfall. When asked, Corvus said that the family that adopted him was involved and known for their warding and protection runes and protective charm work. As he was named heir then Lord, he took up to learning it early.
He did not fail to notice how both of his parents had specifically stated that he wasn’t to ever go to the Dursleys and yet that was where he was. It would have even been better for him to be placed with people they didn’t consider friends or people they didn’t get along with before, like Lucius Malfoy or Severus Snape, in the case of his father. Even strangers or an orphanage would be preferable to the Dursleys.
At this, Harry grows confused. He didn’t really know how normal imprisoning works, only that involves cops and a judge to declare you guilty, plus evidence.
Harry looked back at Alrod to see him smirking at him. Harry blushed at being stared at and dropped his eyes to stare at his lap.
Corvus swept in to discuss their business. "As you can see, Harry has been kept ignorant of our ways and his heritage. That's why we've come; we want to find out who exactly was Harry's magical guardian who failed their duties so, why Harry hasn't received any mail from Gringotts—though we learned they have been sending—and to change his guardianship to me."
“It is like adoption but deeper as with a blood adoption, the parent will give the child their blood, making them real relatives, a family through blood and magic. Sirius Black is, essentially, like your second father.”
Miles and miles stretched on, seconds to minutes to hours, time seemingly not working at all in this dark, dark space. Still, he walked.
Step two. For a successful change of one's life, one must get the balls rolling—in other words, shake things up!
“You can contact them whenever you wish; they will all wait for you. Though, some of them might need to meet you to receive their orders on what to do with the houses they are in. You simply wish to see them and they will arrive,” Alrod adds, knowing he wouldn’t know. Harry nods gratefully.
At this, Alrod nods, “Yes, as he is not considered by Magic as your guardian, dealing with this is easy enough. Not to mention, gaining your lordships will emancipate you so he is no longer needed, not that he ever was,” he states coldly, making Harry choke back a laugh. He smirks as Harry coughs.
The excessive use of the word childish made Harry pout at his cousin, which prompted him to be whacked at the lips with a quill. It was a soft feather, so it didn't hurt, but it made him sneeze which made Corvus laugh at him, so it wasn't a very nice thing to do, in Harry's opinion.
He only felt calmer when his hand was squeezed by Harry. Whatever they'd done, they wouldn't do it again now that he's here. He'll be able to protect him now.
Uldrick let out curses under his breath in Gobbledegook—Harry assumed he was swearing, it felt like he was swearing.
“That’s amazing…” he breathes out. Upon noticing that Alrod was smirking, Harry flushes, embarrassed. He shifts in his seat, placing the papers on the table.
What seemed like days, which could have very well been minutes or years—there was no knowing—Harry found what he was looking for.
So many things had happened in a short span of three days and Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd been happy for more than five minutes while in Number Four, especially not since Hogwarts, where the loneliness Harry had felt since Corvus had left was finally let to rest, filling that space with friends, and quidditch, and life-threatening adventures. Summers after Hogwarts had been excruciating, and now Corvus was back and suddenly he was able to smile and laugh, even when it's summer, even when he's at Number Four, Privet Drive.
Corvus noticed this but did not ask, instead he raised his arms and waited. He did not have to wait long. His arms wrapped eagerly around his small, younger cousin, both basking in the feeling of having family within reach once again.
The Goblin Healer frowned, “I would say so, Lord Potter, as, aside from the cleansing, we also broke and reset many of your bones that healed wrong and gave you potions for malnourishment. It wouldn’t be remiss to say you have lived your entire life with rickety bones that no doubt gave you many a pain.”
The goblin, who was shocked at the respectful display the ratty-looking child had shown, blinked at Harry's words. He narrowed his eyes at the boy, staring at his forehead and on his hidden scar.
The goblin coughs, catching the young wizard’s attention. “For a Lord of a Most Ancient and Noble house to not receive a trial is unheard of, so with the right solicitor, as well as making this fact aware, a trial is not impossible,” he asserted. “I shall call upon the best solicitor for you, Harry, for a case such as this will require only as much,” Alrod stated, making light return to Harry’s eyes.
Not that Malfoy's actions were justifiable. Harry had planned to apologize to the git the day after when he realized how snobbish he had been to the blond. It wasn't Malfoy's fault he was spoiled by his parents and Harry should have tried to make
A small crystal white sphere was placed on the table, a stand keeping it in place. This would read his parents’ will to him, a mist appearing in their shape to speak in their voice as they spoke their wills when they had it first done. Harry would hear it first today before it would be read once again a week later to all the people mentioned within.
Wrapping his arms around his knees and hiding his face in his arms, Harry gives a teary laugh and whispers, "...
That was another matter they would have to fix, for who else might have tried to contact Harry and was unable to.
He also noticed how he glanced at the professors and how they stared at him in shock. He gave a nod to them, which they numbly returned, and sat on the opposite side of the professors. Harry had no time to wonder why the man sat so far because the next person came in just as he sat down.
"15 Galleons per block/spell, as opposed to the hospital's 8," Alrod answers, "It's also three times faster than any hospital, capable of undoing any spell or curse within the day."
He places the mail on the counter, and sets about doing the dishes. He ignores the family of three behind him and diligently does his chores.
Harry sat in shock at the results of his test, numbly handing it to Corvus when he raised a brow. Corvus, in turn, hands his test to Harry, already reading his younger cousin's results. Harry reads Corvus's results, silently thankful for a reprieve from thinking about his own.
Zeppy was a kind house-elf, though he was old. One of the oldest Potter house-elves, he had served the Potter house for many decades and had asked Harry if it would be alright f he could rest now. Zeppy had looked so weathered and tired, that Harry couldn't bear to say no—not that he'd ever deny someone rest. The old house-elf had looked so content at that moment that it brought Harry to tears, grabbing onto Zeppy's wizened hands as he started to glow. Zeppy grabbed just as tight to his youngest master, his kind young master who was tearing up at the sight of him leaving. Truly, Zeppy lived a well and fulfilled life, being a Potter house-elf.
etched on the sides, an iolite gem in the middle. It didn’t judge him like the rest did, either, instead, it pricked him!
The Black Heir ring was different from the rest, as it was not a signet like Lord rings usually are. It was a silver band, black adorning the inside of the band like cloth, with the words
Snape sneered at the agitated werewolf. "Calm yourself, Lupin. He had clearly stated that the issues had been solved. Do cease your blubbering," he drawled condescendingly. Though he himself gave the young wizard concerned glances, no matter how subtle. McGonagall snorted at this. The cat animagus was well aware of the dour man's penchant for worrying over his charges, though he mostly hid them under sneering faces and condescending vitriol—or perhaps that was how he protected them? Regardless, she was surprised to see how quick he was to take the young Potter on as his charge, although she was sure the man wasn't even aware of it himself.
Harry doubled over, clutching his stomach as he let out loud guffaws. Corvus, meanwhile, covered his mouth with both hands as he laughed, head down and back leaning on the closed door. A few moments passed just laughing, uncaring if some neighbors' curtains were opened a smidge to peer at them. Let Petunia handle it, she was used to covering up any gossip regarding Harry anyway (though she was usually the one who spread them).
The child had messy raven locks, aristocratic cheekbones, gold geometric-framed glasses that made emerald green eyes gleam in the light, and a short hooded cape over a simple long-sleeved dress-shirt. The child was small and thin, looking to be 8 or 9 years old. Remus greedily sucked in the image of his cub who he hadn't seen in almost ten years.
He also bought some non-essentials. Entertainment and hobby things. Art materials like sketchpads, pencils, graphite, charcoal, and colouring pencils, paints, and other stationeries. Harry had always enjoyed art, though he didn't do much of it. Perhaps, he could do so now that he was free from the Dursleys. He also got an Apple Arrow tee, to commemorate the first quidditch team he'd ever been a fan of. He didn't know what quidditch was when he first bought it but he got a book about it so he'd learn it anyways. He had also bought other books, some from Flourish and Blotts (which were mostly academic), which were comprised of information a muggle-raised wizard and a Lord of multiple Houses like him would need, and some from Nook of Books which was in Horizont Alley, which were more information on the wizarding world, as well as fiction books and anything else that caught his attention.
"Hello, pretty, who might you be?" Harry coos, rubbing his finger on the owl's breast feathers. The owl squawks and ruffles its wings. Harry raises a brow.
His uncle sneers, "Dudley, your aunt and I will be going out, boy; you'll be going to Mrs. Figg’s' house. You best not cause trouble with your freakishness while you're there, boy, or so help me..." Uncle Vernon states, his sentence ending in a low growl.
When Harry goes back inside, he hunts for loose change in the house, inside drawers and wedged in couch cushions, to add to the few he saved up for years. Under his cot, in a tiny, tight plastic bag to prevent noise, was all of Harry's life savings.
More of a filler chapter, really. I wanted to write something but Corvus meeting the Weasleys seemed to long of a chapter so I moved that to the next.
Alrod ignored the brightly coloured wizard as went back behind his desk, retrieving the wills and the globe that would read them. He placed them on the desk before turning to address the guests.
Harry, naturally, does not open the door. Instead, he curls up on top of his bed, pushed to the wall and by the corner, and rests his head on his knees as he waits for his uncle to wind down. It only takes a few minutes before the pounding stops.
So it was how the Potter cousins now found themselves waiting patiently (or not-so-patiently) to be picked up by Harry's best friend and his family, so they could finally leave the godforsaken place called Privet Drive and the entirety of its people. The two were quiet, Corvus gong through some letters he'd received from France on Harry's bed, while Harry tapped his wand to the beat from the song coming from the radio downstairs, humming silently to himself as he sat on his trunk. Corvus glanced at him, remembering how little Harry used to love to sing, the one thing he looked forward to when they went to church, and he vowed to have Harry sing for him at least once, to see if Harry still sounded as adorable as he did before or if he got better. Glancing down, Corvus also vowed to get Harry a new trunk. His trunk was getting old, and, although still useable, was starting to fray a bit on the edges. Plus, there was nothing wrong with going to school with two trunks, even if there were trunks with larger compartments inside. Knowing Harry, he wouldn't want to waste a still useable trunk, just because it was starting to wear. Corvus would have to buy it when he gets Harry clothes shopping.
When he opened the black box, he saw little jewelry within: two golden bands, a few bracelets and a few simple necklaces. One necklace was a circular pendant with the initials HJP on one side and J&L on the other. Another necklace had a pendant of deer antlers and another necklace was a locket that held a picture of baby him on one side and his parents on the other side. Harry considers it a miracle that his aunt had not sold the things.
Harry nodded, relieved that the goblin had finally stopped glaring at him, and smiled, "It's fine, Alrod. I understand. I came by with no proof of identification other than my words and my scar, both of which can be faked by anyone at any time." Truly, he was just glad that they gave him a chance at all. He knew what he looked like and it didn't really paint a good picture when placed in a bank.
“You see, there is a clause to Lordships, Lord Potter, and all Lords lose this when they otherwise die or become convicted. No Lord can continue being a Lord if they are convicted as a criminal,” Alrod explains, watching as the young Lord Potter stiffens, mind whirling in thought.
It was then that Harry notices one particular box that was covered in a black cloth, hidden behind all the others and in a nook.
Shocked silence filled the room. Where did one even start? Harry watched his godparents and honorary uncle as his father's will was read. They had different reactions from each other.
"His transgressions, fortunately, do not extend to theft. We sent him letters informing him of your monies and properties, but he does not handle them. I have done that in your stead, Heir Potter, as was your father's, and even your magical guardian's, wishes until you came here and would, gradually, do all of them yourself. You would have started at eleven, as most heirs do, with your trust vault and, year by year, until you became Lord, settle more and more of your accounts, properties, investments, and businesses."
Corvus smirked but said nothing, instead, he merely pulled Harry away from the alley. Harry groaned piteously, clutching at his cousin.
He watched as nothing happen to the piece of parchment before the blood started to swirl on the paper and then disappear within, a bright flash of light pulsing from the paper appearing. Harry watched transfixed at the wonderful sight of magic as words slowly started to appear.
"'Just Harry'," Older him cuts him off. "I know," he smiles sad and knowingly. Little Harry is reminded then, that this man, taller than him, older than him, strong yet still so skinny, is still him. No one in this time, this moment, knows him more than this man does, because they are the same, one person, in different times, but still one, whole person.
When they calmed, Corvus wrapped an arm around Harry again, and the two made their way away from the house.
"I haven't an idea why I could be mentioned, if not only to be called out by Potter—which seems likely, from all the tales you've told me about him." Harry wondered what that meant but again, his musings were interrupted when another man enters the room.
When it was done and his mother’s form disappeared, he grabbed a handful of tissues, a bit of embarrassment coursing through him for crying in front of the older goblin, as well as gratefulness for said goblin’s insight, placing the box of tissues on the table. He took a moment to compose himself, vowing to cry less when his father’s will be read.
Harry then asks about the properties next. “About the houses, I saw that some of them were in unsuitable or unstable conditions. Are there any that I can live in? I’m homeless at the moment, you see,” he explains sheepishly.
They find themselves in a cavern, a ritual room within Gringotts, with a waterfall that would have taken Harry's breath if it wasn't gone already. As it was, Harry was focused on maintaining his cool as he was directed to lay on a stone slab, a white sheet the only thing covering his modesty among a group of goblins surrounding him. It had been decided that a team of goblin curse-breakers would work on Harry, a request from the Potter-Black Heir, who, to the astonishment and bemusement of the goblin team when they were informed of the reason, felt safer and more secure in their hands. They were currently preparing the room for the cleansing, purifying, and purging ritual. Harry dropped his head to the side, glancing at the corner of the room where Corvus stood.
It was the sight of Corvus, so calm and yet so angry at the same time, that gave him back the breath that had felt so out of reach, and further calmed him. Harry would get through this, he always did, and this time, Corvus would by his side. Come Sunday this time, Ron and Hermione would be by his side as well, and the twins, Mr and Mrs Weasley, and even Percy too, in his own Percy-like way. This was not the first time life had thrown something at him and life would hardly stop after this. After all, what is life if not waves upon the sands of your existence?
He smirked at Harry and asked in an innocent tone, "Do you want to go grab a late lunch with me, Harrison?" His eyes, however, glinted with mischievous light. It was a familiar sight to Harry, though one he had not seen in a long time. It reminded him of times where Corvus would prank Dudley in retaliation to whatever it was he did to Harry.
"Gringotts apologizes for the delay, Chief Warlock Dumbledore. We had sent all of our summonses at the same time,"
Had it been anyone else, someone who didn't know firsthand how cruel, uncaring, or willfully blind others can be, like Harry does explicitly, they might have teared up, they might have even raged, yelling to the heavens just how unfair or cruel that was. As it is, it was Harry this had happened to. Harry, who lived with the Dursleys for most of his life, who faced the constant contemptuous stares and whispers at Privet Drive, who then faced the cruel one-sided vitriol of Snape, whose godfather was on the run and hiding because the British Magical Government didn't do its job right, whose ex-professor then turned honorary godfather/uncle was practically jobless and faced bitter discrimination against his person, simply because he would forcibly turn into a giant animal once a month. Harry felt a burning at the corner of his eyes but no tears appeared, he instead clutched harder at the hand that held his, shutting his eyes and focused on his breath.
The explanation Alrod gave turned out to be him giving them all copies of his health scan. He had not seen it as he was already under potioned sleep by then and when he woke up, he immediately went to Alrod.
Decided, Mimsy pointed her wooden spatula at the area where the bathroom was. In a gentle but firm voice (Mimsy decided that the young master did not need her 'you listen now or so help me' voice, unlike her previous boys), she told the young lord, "Master be taking a bath. He be relaxing while he waits. Mimsy will be finished by then."
Little Harry's breath leaves him in a whoosh. Older him grins despite himself. He remembers the elation of having a letter addressed to him for the very first time, even after all this time.
But before he could snatch it out of his uncle's hand, uncle Vernon jerks it out of reach. His face turns even more purple.
Alrod gave them a minute to compose themselves before playing James' will. Severus would have thought his part was done, now that Lily's will was read. He was wrong.
Little Harry tears at that, he cries when he is told of his parents, he sobs when he is told that the Dursleys had lied and his parents loved him and they died for him because they loved him.
Harry wouldn't really say that the Black house-elf Kreacher was all that eager when Harry had called on him. That was a different experience Harry wouldn't forget anytime soon, even if they managed to find solid ground with Kreacher.
For the third time today, Harry felt tears pool in his eyes, but this time finally let them fall. He sat there crying over the box of things that belonged to him and his parents, sobbing over the pain and love, over the sadness and the joy, of everything that was in his life.
"Coming, uncle Vernon!" Harry replies, dropping his Hogwarts letter by his cupboard, using his foot to slide it under the door. His older self warned him that his relatives might try to take it from him. He wouldn't let them.
Harry was floored, beyond awed at the various clubs and events, especially the sports department. Hogwarts only had Quidditch and Dueling that one time in second year (that he was aware of). Harry was especially curious about aerobatics, broom racing and owl racing, as well as the winged horse racing, of which Corvus was a club member. Corvus had suggested that if he was truly interested, he could always found a club in Hogwarts or ask one of the teachers or head of houses if it was possible to do. When Harry pointed out that he was already part of the Quidditch team, Corvus had stated that it was allowed to be part of two clubs at a time. Harry hesitantly said he might need to think more on the subject, which Corvus was very amenable to, claiming that thinking things through was always a good quality to possess.
Remus frowned, glancing back at Harry concernedly. Remus turned back to Alrod, worry only deepening.
“So, I got Healing Magics from the Peverell line? What does that mean, exactly?” Harry asks after a moment. Did it perhaps mean super regeneration like in those comics Dudley likes to read so much? Harry always has been a fast healer, though he doubted he’d be able to regrow limbs.
Harry stays in his curled up position a little while longer, ignoring the stomach cramps with practiced ease. It wasn't until three hours later, when the Dursleys have long gone to bed, did Harry uncurl from his position, brittle bones complaining from lack of movement in the past few hours. He, again, ignores the pain, and goes to the desk where he pulls out a couple of parchments. He sets put to do his summer homework; he'll likely be stuck here for a couple days, might as well do something.
Once calm, he grabbed the last ring, the only ring for which he would not be Lord to. Harry was okay with this as he heard his godfather Sirius was Lord Black. In prison he may be, alive he was still and that was better than nothing.
Severus would have thought it to be a cruel joke of Potter's, had he not known that Gringotts could not be fooled by such petty parlour tricks that James Potter had so loved. But still! That Lily not only forgave him but Lily, the woman he had loved, had still considered him her best friend and would entrust her son to
