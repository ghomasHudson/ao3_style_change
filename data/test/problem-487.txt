Lovegood and Weasley are in there, brewing tea or whatever the correct name is for that pile of soggy, miscellaneous herbs Lovegood calls her “own blend”. The girl Weasley, to be clear. Draco really should start referring to these people by their first names, if only to avoid confusion. He lives with them, after all, and these two in particular have turned out to be surprisingly good company. The Weaselette is mean and doesn’t really give a shit about anyone’s opinion of her, characteristics Draco can appreciate in anyone, and Lovegood is sort of impossible to dislike, even if looking at her makes it hard to forget she was locked in his cellar for the better part of a year. Still, it isn’t his cellar anymore, and she seems to be doing ok.
It goes suddenly quiet and Harry swears under his breath. It’s always difficult to know when Malfoy is going to come because he makes so much noise the whole way through that Harry can’t tell when he’s getting close. Not that he’s trying to come at the same time as him, or anything, it’s just a nice thought. Or creepy as fuck, he supposes. Oh
Hmm. Nice to know his snark is still there, despite how terrified he is.
“We all saw that head massage he gave you. Well, Ron did and told us all about it but, same difference. Honestly, Harry.”
,” she says, mimicking Malfoy’s accent. It’s seriously starting to freak Harry out how well Malfoy and Ginny are getting along.
Blaise smirks at him.  “The same thing everyone else is, I imagine.”
“No,” Draco says, honestly. “Feel rather shockingly awful, actually.”
“I just mean--” Draco huffs, pausing to pull his sleeves down over his hands. “It’s December. I’ll catch some awful cold if I spend another night hanging out of my window and it’ll be entirely your fault.”
, except that everything has.
Draco splutters at that. “Probably?! Pans, I can’t risk my dignity on
Potter goes still. Draco’s body tenses too, against his will, as he realises what he’s said. He knows Potter feels it and he waits, unsure what to do.
Harry stares. “Right.”
as in halfway into a war that’s likely going to kill one of us?”
“I’m going on a walk again,” Potter tells him far too early the next morning, the sun barely up and the grass wet under Potter’s feet. He gestures behind him at the stretch of sloping hill.
Draco doesn’t need her sharp inhalation to realise what the spell’s revealed.
Harry says nothing. He’s seriously considered it.
“They’d get bent,” Harry says on a breath, whole body tight with the conflicting desires to keep perfectly still or to relax further back into the movement of Malfoy’s fingers. He swallows. “Out of shape. You know. Or my teammates would notice.”
Right. Sometimes Draco forgets just how fast her brain works. “That doesn’t explain how we’re both alive.” He gestures at himself and Potter.
Weasley manages to half-lift, half-shove Potter on to the backseat whilst Draco stands there feeling completely fucking useless and once Potter’s slumped in a vaguely upright position, Draco climbs in too and Weasley goes round the front and the doors all get slammed shut and Granger speeds them off down the quiet street.
“That can be arranged,” Her voice comes out strangled but she thinks that’s fair enough considering the situation. She’s only human after all and this is Harry Potter, star of pretty much every fantasy Draco’s ever entertained and also apparently the kind of girl who, when confronted with Draco essentially offering herself up on a platter, decides that what would make her happiest is to get
Harry stares out of the window above the bed, head tilted all the way back into the pillow as Draco gets another finger in. The glass is charmed like at the Ministry back home, with a little side panel of options for different views — mountains, forests, fields (“Because they’re genuinely scared we’ll go barmy, cooped up here, if we forget what a tree looks like,” Draco had explained) — but right now the spell’s inactive and all Harry can see are stars.
Harry should have sent him home, or at least given him a bucket and told him to stay out on the terrace. He’d been teaching year six at the time; if he got sick his class would be stuck with a substitute for their final weeks before summer, after which they’d be making the transition to secondary school. He hadn’t wanted to do that to them.
“Is this normal roommate behaviour?” Potter asks as Draco pulls on a sweatband to keep his hair out of his face.

“It’s
to just leave it, find somewhere to disapparate and write off the whole trip as a waste of time — and not for lack of trying, he’s suggested it so many times it doesn’t even embarrass him anymore, coming off as a coward — but he wants to see what will happen if he takes himself out of the equation. Plus, he’s fucking
“No more time loop?” Potter asks.

Draco remembers reading something about that. They’re making him take a NEWT in Muggle Studies this year and he’s been doing some studying before classes begin, half out of embarrassment at how behind he’s going to be, half out of a weird, angry curiosity that’s taken hold of him.

She looks as terrified as he feels. This is so much worse than when Weasley got splinched — bits of Potter’s
“What,” Draco starts to say and then it’s black.
Draco’s whole body goes limp with relief. He feels like he slept for a week, like he could sleep for a week more.
He glances away from Potter’s face, making to move back inside, but Potter's not finished.
“Well well well,” Dolohov croaks, and Draco’s waiting for him to say something more, something equally as stupid and would-be villainous, like
“Potter.”
It’s only because he gets used to Potter being around and providing a steady stream of mundane background conversation that Draco notices something is wrong with him on Sunday afternoon. He’s actually inside Draco’s room properly for once, but he’s restless, pacing up and down, prodding at things on Draco’s shelves. Draco had been trying to do some Arithmancy because it’s been months and he’s out of practice, work spread out on the floor at the foot of his bed, but Potter’s disquiet is infectious.
a shudder of disgust.
and it taught Draco how to make those fancy little leaves on top of cups of coffee) and the occupants are all reasonably agreeable. The creepy old House-elf even likes Draco best. Potter’s still a bit weird around him, but it’d been decent enough of him to even let Draco move in, so Draco considers it a win.
“Do what?” Potter looks up at him, bewildered.
He makes himself pay attention during the briefing, which goes very well until it’s Draco’s turn to talk and he commands the attention of the room easily, calm and clever and authoritative. It’s almost unbearably sexy, so maybe Harry’s gets a tiny bit distracted, but he doesn’t think he’s missed anything too important when he zones back in, and well, if he has, Draco’ll be there to call him an idiot when he messes up.
He’s like bloody Hermione, going in to do schoolwork over summer. At first Harry assumed he was trying to stay ahead, make sure he was top of the class, but it seems obvious now that he actually, unbelievable as it sounds,
“Harry,” she pants, her mouth open and wet against Draco’s shoulder, fingers moving faster.
anything, the emails. They promised they’d stay friends and Harry thinks this is probably them trying to do that, but maintaining a friendship across the Atlantic ocean and a sizeable time zone difference is just as hard as trying to keep a relationship going was.
Harry gets home from rugby that evening with a splitting headache and the usual, bone-deep satisfaction of feeling like his body’s been steamrollered. It’s why he started playing in the first place, right after the war, to exhaust himself to the point where his mind would shut up for two minutes, and he still loves the physicality of it, the way it calms him down, even now his head’s in a much better place than it was at eighteen. He likes, too, that the guys he plays with don’t know Harry Potter as anyone but a bloke who looks too small to be any good, but can get the ball all the way up the field to score before anyone even notices he’s got it.
his teeth sharp on Harry’s lips one second and his tongue soft and slick and probing the roof of Harry’s mouth the next.
neck?” Potter says, indignant, and then almost slips, maybe to make a point, because that seems like the kind of thing he would do, though Draco suspects it’s simply that his foothold’s not very secure.
Whatever the reason, Harry’ll take this back-and-forth any day. He’s so grateful he could cry.
It takes him fifteen minutes to get ready, ten to force himself to leave his hair alone and five to realise he doesn’t really have the right kind of shoes.
Harry shoves his hands in his pockets. “I know. And I wouldn’t ask you to. But this— what we’re doing— it’s not really a relationship, is it?”
Potter turns to him. “You’re cold.”
“Good, you’re awake.” Granger falls into a chair opposite their beds. “I assume Harry’s told you? The shard must have stuck in you when my bag got hit.” She holds up the beaded bag.
The thing is, Draco’s never claimed to be a saint. He’s only very recently got on board with this whole good-guys, self-sacrificing thing, so he’d be lying if he said, after so many go-arounds, that the idea doesn’t cross his mind. Just giving up. Letting the universe do what it’s clearly so desperate to do and finish Potter off.
“Not very good at following orders, are you?” Potter doesn’t look put out, rather, she looks frighteningly like Draco is everything she’s ever wanted and then some. It’s more than a bit overwhelming, having the full force of her gaze directed at Draco this close up.
Draco barely has time to feel her stomach start to drop in disappointment before there are hands on her waist. She spins wildly and comes face to face with the eyes she’d just been scanning the room for: Potter, right there, inches from her nose. Draco is suddenly very aware of how sweaty and gross she probably looks but also, she doesn’t really care.

“It’s dark.”

person.”
He stares as Luna waves happily at him from where she’s curled on the floor, her legs folded pretzel style. Is that Ernie Macmillan at the back? How exactly had Parkinson gotten her foot behind her head like that?
“Oh perfect,” Draco growls.
She shrugs, face guilty. “Ditched it. Reckon it’s safe for us to apparate now anyway.”
Potter’s shut the window behind him and it makes Draco want to scream, weirdly, so he gets up and goes over to it, blood rushing to his head after being horizontal for so many hours. He shoves it back open a bit and lets himself look down for a second, but Potter’s already disappeared back inside.
The similarity is not lost on Potter. “Bit of a role reversal,” he laughs, chokes through whatever’s caught in his throat — blood, probably, Draco can see that it’s in his mouth, his teeth a weird, smudged pink. He can’t believe Potter’s joking about that day, joking at
Harry had been wrong, about what it’s like out here. There’s darkness, obviously, but there’s also so much light, this bright, white-hot light splashed everywhere, all across the black, and there’s Draco, separated from him by mere centimetres, instead of miles.
Draco frowned sideways at him, lying on his stomach with his head pillowed on his arms. “I knew that already. I knew that when we were eleven, Harry.” He snorted. “And it’s not like I’m Mr. Low Maintenance myself, I have
It’s borderline ridiculous how much warmer the flat feels with Draco in it, like it’s been missing something all the time he was away, even though he’s never actually lived there. He talks a mile a minute while Harry’s chopping and sautéing, sitting on the kitchen counter, his foot making contact with Harry’s thigh every now and then as he swings his legs.
“I really don’t think it’s a good idea,” he says, but it’s impossible to stop Potter once he’s decided something and the rest of Draco’s furiously whispered protests fall on deaf ears as they head into the house once more. At least Granger — dependably sensible Granger — takes his advice to protect her beaded bag with an
Granger, the only other person in the room, doesn’t look up from her book. “Yes, we gathered. Can you stop at Tesco on your way back? We’re out of bread again.”
Potter finally straightens up and Draco can see his tongue poking out in concentration as his arm goes back, fist clenched, shoulder flexing as he throws.
at him. Dolohov dodges it easily and laughs again.
Sometimes he manages to hit Dolohov with something, but the psychopath always gets that curse out before his body slams into the floor, the point of his wand always finding Potter before he crumples, or staggers back, or, the one time Draco just up and kicks him in the balls, magic be damned, drops to his knees, howling.
Potter looks down at the small stone in his hand like he’s already forgotten it’s there. “Yeah. Er, it’s a muggle thing.”
It’s cold with the window wide open. Draco doesn’t mind, he’s been wearing thick layers inside for months. Something about the freezing air feels sterilising and it was the only way he could think of to get rid of the dead, stagnant feeling at home. Here the air smells even cleaner than in Wiltshire, the bite of it at once familiar and shocking, and he stands there long enough that the temperature of his room, when he finally pulls his head back in, is barely discernible from the outside.
Potter laughs, gets a hand under Draco’s thigh to pull it up around her waist and bites her neck, a little too hard. “Did you miss the huge badge pinned to my tits? I’ll admit they’re quite distracting but I wouldn’t have thought they’d prevent you from reading..”
“You should come to a game sometime,” Harry says like Draco hasn’t been to every one of her games already and they haven’t engaged in some truly inappropriate eye contact every time they crossed paths. Draco nods and, in a move she will vehemently deny later, kisses the tip of Harry’s nose. Harry looks delighted and opens her mouth so Draco has to — she
“Yoga.”
It’s the same, everything, their walk upstairs, the bedroom, the door opening and the footsteps. Draco’s too busy hoping he’s wrong, that it won’t be
“Just— stay there a sec,
“Don’t get used to it,” Potter says, around another yawn. She’s already stretching out, wriggling around to try and get under the covers with Draco still on top of her. “You staying?”
Later, they lay in Harry’s bed with the sheets kicked to the floor, the desk fan whirring precariously atop the bookshelf next to them, because Harry felt like he’d had any ability to maintain a cooling charm fucked right out of him by Draco’s careful hands, his hot mouth.
Just as he’s about to start digging in the sofa cushions for his wand, Malfoy comes in, scanning the room for his bag and scooping it up with one hand when he finds it propped against an armchair.
Ron raises his beer in agreement. It’s chilled, damp with condensation. Harry debates getting up to get his own, or whether he can manage a specific enough
He knocks Granger’s wand aside as he kneels down. “Weasley. Help me.”
Malfoy shakes his head slightly. “Sorry, I thought—” His frown deepens. “Never mind. I was looking for my jacket. You didn’t borrow it did you? The black one.”
“I’m assuming you didn’t buy these?” Harry asks him over his shoulder.
and shoved his hand down his pants, before Malfoy even entered the room, and he can feel it building alongside the pressure in his chest as his lungs start protesting the lack of air. Malfoy stares down at him with this look on his face, like he can’t pull his eyes away, pupils blown wide even though he’s already come once.
He could make a joke. Something about the magical healing quality of his mouth, or his clearly spectacular kissing ability, but he doesn’t. He blinks at Potter, pulse rocketing the longer they sit there, eyes locked, not saying anything. Potter lets his bottom lip slip free of his teeth and Draco feels his own lips part in response, unavoidable.
Fear burns at Draco’s extremities and he tamps down on it, tries to focus. Dolohov’ll be under strict instructions not to kill Potter, but he’ll definitely go for the rest of them if he gets the chance. He proves Draco right a split-second later, sending a Killing Curse so close to Granger’s head that Weasley and Potter both start shouting even louder and the smell of burned hair fills the room.
you we should have waited and brewed more—”
Potter shrugs. “Basically. Hermione figured it out in about three seconds once she got her hands on that.” He nods at the shard of metal. “It was her time-turner.”
Draco’s half-heartedly spread a couple of his books out on his desk, thinking it might be time to start doing some actual work now they’re this side of New Years, but he’s not feeling particularly motivated.
It was, objectively, pretty disgusting when he’d sat up and kissed Harry, even though he cast three different breath-freshening charms and only tasted like spearmint and ginger. Unhygienic, at the very least, but Harry hadn’t been able to bring himself to care.
Draco waves a hand at him. “Yes. Look, I know it sounds crazy,” and he tries to explain as best he can, about Dolohov and the car and Potter, bleeding, unconscious.
Harry shakes his head, mouth still dry. “No,” he croaks, clears his throat. “Uh, no, sorry. Have you checked the coat pegs?” which is a monumentally stupid thing to say, all things considered, but then Harry’s fairly sure Malfoy is only using the jacket as an excuse to come in and see what’s happening, so.
, obviously, just to see his friend — Teddy’s there too, and Andromeda, which is mainly why Harry can keep telling himself that — when Draco brings it up.
this time,
It has to be late, though he has no idea what the actual time is, just that he’s drunk and his body’s tired and a little turned on from all the dancing. He notices Potter sitting against the opposite wall, eyes closed but seemingly awake as two girls Draco vaguely recognises from the Gryffindor Quidditch team sit beside him, talking quietly.
Malfoy’s smile widens, fast and wicked. “Oh, I intend to finish.”
“Merlin, you smell good,” Draco murmurs. Potter’s always been this reckless ball of energy, magic and power and temper contained barely below the surface and it’s as addictive now as it was when they were fifteen and about two seconds away from decking each other at all times.
“I just meant--” he says, swallowing. “I know it’s not the same.”
her money, Ron, we’re perfectly comfortable in case you hadn’t noticed—” she mutters, but she waves her wand to rearrange some names.
Weasley laughs at him. “It’s not. Harry’d never throw you out on the street.”
might—
Ginny flops down onto the end of his bed, exasperated. “Because getting to have sex is such a horrible prospect.” She stares at him, calculating. “C’mon. We’ll do it now. Apparently you can’t be trusted to do it yourself.”
There seems to be even more blood than usual once they’re situated in the back seat. Draco’s starting to get used to the smell of it, thick and metallic, but it’s still not
It certainly speeds up the process. They don’t even make it upstairs before Dolohov appears, shooting curses from the landing and grinning horribly at them whilst he leans over the bannister. A man that side of fifty should really not be able to bend like that, Draco thinks, and sends a hex at him that misses and explodes a wall sconce.
“I am known for my unfailing positivity in the face of infinite setbacks.”
And there it is, the catch in Potter’s breathing that Draco hears behind her because they’re so close and oh, ok she was right, she can do this. It is still Potter’s birthday after all.
She tightens her ponytail, gripping her broom between her thighs to keep steady, and gives Harry a pointed look. He’s been absolutely hopeless since Malfoy moved in.
Blaise laughs, gripping Draco’s waist and rolling up into him. “I’m not stupid, Draco. And I’m also not offended. Just admit it so that we can get on with giving him a show.”
The Muggle crackers are suitably underwhelming. They don’t even bang very loud, no smoke or sparks whatsoever, and all that’s inside are some bits of paper and plastic. “You call this a hat?” Draco asks, holding up the flimsy excuse for what he can only assume is supposed to be some kind of crown.
He opens his eyes.
There are deep gouges in Draco’s tin of hair pomade. Has no one ever taught Potter that you’re supposed to smooth your fingers in a circular motion to preserve the level surface of the product? Evidently not. He likely doesn’t even know what a pomade is, or where to use it, as his hair remains unruly as ever. Draco shudders to think where else Potter might have been slathering it.
Merlin, she is an absolute nightmare, what the fuck is Draco doing. She lets her head fall back to give Potter better access and is annoyingly very aware of the surely thousands of germs on the tiled wall now in direct contact with her hair. “Potter,” she says, horrified at how it comes out like a whine, and half-heartedly tries to push her back with one hand even as she wraps her other leg up around Potter’s waist so that Potter has to support her weight.
Draco hits him over the back of the head. He has to stretch up to do it — he’s tall but Weasley is tall on an unnatural level, something Draco likes reminding him of — but it’s worth it. He hopes he’s not blushing. They haven’t actually talked about anything really, him and Potter, and definitely not him and Potter and Weasley and Granger. It’s a conversation Draco feels can wait until they’re not standing in a car park, at the very least.
Potter chuckles weakly at the look on Weasley’s face and then starts coughing, his body shaking violently with the force of it.
“I thought you liked me loud.” Blaise raises an eyebrow. Draco can feel he’s hard already, despite the careful display of indifference. “Isn’t that why we always come back here?”
“What are you doing here?”
“Guess your mouth is good for more than making bitchy comments,” Potter gets out between kisses, and Draco kisses across her jaw, gets her earlobe between her teeth in retaliation. Her tone isn’t mean though, it’s teasing and warm and her laughter is infectious. Draco hadn’t imagined it would be like this, and she’d thought about it a lot. Passionate, yeah, hate-fuelled and angry, most likely, but not this, this easy back and forth. It’s fun, she realises a little deliriously, and
Still, his absence doesn’t stop the world turning. Harry’s life goes on without him: Sundays at the Burrow and school parents’ evenings and a determined avoidance of any film with a plot that’s even tenuously related to space. Harry remodels his kitchen, buys real furniture for the roof terrace, gets Neville to recommend plants that actually have a chance of surviving under his less-than-green thumb and all the while he
anybody watching them. The whole village has an odd feel to it, too empty, like there are people just out of sight somewhere.
Potter looks a little embarrassed too, but he’s still grinning.
to switch with someone..
He doesn’t wait to see if she’s heard him, just throws himself forward until he’s at the foot of the stairs and sends a
“Where are we going, Granger?” he asks over his shoulder.
“I know! I don’t—”
Granger stares at Potter. “I can’t—”
“It’s not much warmer in here than it is outside,” Potter accuses, eyes narrowing slightly.
“He’s in no state for Apparition, ‘Mione,” Weasley says, placating, and that’s what does it.
Luna confirms his suspicions. “Draco.”
it. He broke the cycle.
?” Weasley says.
, back when he’d been talking about Draco’s mattress, only worse, meaner.
There are lobsters in Harry’s fridge. Harry’s unsure if he’s ever actually seen a lobster in real life before and now there are four on his middle shelf, wrapped in plastic and shoved in next to the leftovers from last night.
“Potter.” Draco closes his eyes. “Shut up.”
His lungs are starting to burn. He has no breath to make a noise but a small, desperate sound escapes anyway as Malfoy squeezes tighter around his cock, free hand pushing Harry’s hair out of his face.
They should probably split up. It’d be the most efficient way to find the Horcrux, if there is one here, but nobody suggests it. Draco thinks they’re all probably feeling a little spooked, and, loathe though he is to admit it, even in his own head, a little protective of Potter, too. It doesn’t seem right to force him to go through the house alone.
The footsteps stop, a figure steps out of the shadows.
Draco flips her off, then sighs and sags back against the cupboard door. He’ll just have to let Potter be, and hope things will settle on their own. “Did Longbottom eat my last croissant?”
It should be dark outside of the warm glow of the tent interior — it’s late and the trees obscure most of the moonlight, but the piles of snow seem to shine a bit in the gloom, breaking up the blackness. Draco pulls the blanket tighter around him, eyes trained on the trees, and counts to fifty-two in his head before the flap opens behind him and Potter waddles out, wrapped in two blankets and wearing something misshapen and knitted on his head.
“What?” he asks, leaning out into the cold.
Still, he manages to drop off before the need to feel the chill on his face wins out over his exhaustion. He doesn’t even realise he’s fallen asleep until he’s jerked awake again by a sharp sound. He lies there, disorientated after barely being unconscious for ten minutes, heart pounding. The noise comes again; Draco blinks over at the window, then gets out of bed and opens it to find Potter staring up at him.
“Let’s just get to a doctor,” Weasley says from the front. “It’s the next best thing, after Mungo’s.”
Potter rolls his eyes. Draco tracks the movement and then watches as his face shifts, eyes softening, mouth tightening. “It didn’t feel right with people missing.”
“There was a—” Potter says, ragged. “A car. Parked on the street back there.”
The next time Draco sees Potter he’s only just got back from the Prefect’s bathroom. People liked to talk about starting a new year how one means to go on, but Draco’s always been a big believer in spending as much of the first week of January as possible either in bed, or in a hot bath. Potter was at the window when Draco came in, warm and damp from the water, and he’d nodded in greeting, watching Draco dry his hair with a charm as he pulled himself over the sill and then sat himself there.
It could so easily be an uncomfortable conversation, the memory of the way they left things still raw for Harry, but their tones are light, teasing, an undercurrent of familiarity warming every word. Harry’s dizzy with it, how they’re
The flask is empty and Draco’s sitting cross-legged on top of his desk, right shoulder pressed heavily into the window frame.
“If you slip off on your way up, I take no responsibility,” Draco says, but he still lets Potter come over and collapse next to him on the bed.
Luckily, Pansy, who seems to have this sixth sense about when Draco needs her, shows up before she can make a complete fool of herself by doing something like burying her nose in Potter’s neck as she’d been considering just then. “Come dance, Draco!” Pansy half whines, grinning easily at Potter when the other girl nods in greeting.
, that is. They’d been up there for hours, and Draco looked sleepy, satisfied.
, not standing up in the snow.
“Henry,” Seamus wheezes.
“Fuck, Potter,” she breathes and then, “Wait,
“Seriously, though,” Draco says, the alcohol and the heat of Potter’s gaze loosening her tongue. “It was a pretty cool manoeuvre,” and then immediately flushes pink.
“Not a word, Potter,” she mumbles against Harry’s lips and then, when Harry is sufficiently dazed from having her mouth expertly ravaged, even if Draco says so herself, “Happy birthday.”
“You brought him up.”
There’s a pause and then-- Potter’s face is very cold. Even his lips are cold where they press closed-mouth against Draco’s, though Draco suspects it’d be warm if he parted them. Draco’s not sure if he wants that. He already feels unsteady and he’s not the one hanging onto the outside of the castle three floors up.
“Hang on,
Potter goes in first like he usually does, tests the door with his wand before they all file in behind him. Draco’s barely over the threshold before he pushes past and heads for the stairs, ignoring the furious whispers of the others. He already knows where Dolohov is and he’s made up his mind to try this. After a tiny pause, there are footsteps behind him. The other three are following him, because they’re Gryffindors, and because they’re nauseatingly good people who won’t let him go up there alone, even if they might not entirely believe what he’s told them is waiting.
They have to stop talking about it then because a nurse comes in. Weasley hurriedly tucks the time-turner out of sight.
“I do,” Draco says, instead of the several other witty retorts that have already lined themselves up in her head. She senses that this might be the time for a little bit of vulnerability, much as she is disinclined to even think that word, let alone make an attempt to emulate it.
“Fuck, I knew it would be like this,” Malfoy says, body shifting on the bed as he drives his hips down to meet Harry’s fingers. “I just
“What the fuck,” Draco says — fairly politely, he thinks, considering — “is that?”
“Are you in again?” Lovegood asks him.
innocent when Malfoy tugs on his hair like that.
Harry sighs. “Ok, fine, he’s in, but I don’t think this is going to solve anything.”
“Right.” Draco looks back at Weasley, who only smiles, showing all of her teeth. “And what are we proposing he hasn’t realised? Only if it’s a
They get Potter up and out into the snow again faster than they’ve ever managed, and Draco quickly finds and unlocks the car. He’s watched Granger do it so many times that he can replicate the wand movement perfectly.
“What if I sleep with the light on?”
Draco laughs, distorted but familiar, when Harry tells him all the kids call him “Mr. Potter’s Spaceman Friend”. They’re catching up for the first time in weeks on one of their allotted eternally-too-short video calls. The communication technology is still developmental and the ground station in Merritt Island is the only place connected to Draco’s shuttle, so Harry has to Floo and have them push a screen up to the fireplace on their end and even then, they only get ten minutes or so every couple of months. It would be better to just go there, cut out the middleman, but he has a job, he can’t Portkey off to America every time he feels lonely.
that cut on his scalp hurts but he also feels like it might hurt a lot more if he stops, if either of them pulls back.
Draco laughs again, or more accurately, breathily expels a lot of air and she’s getting close now, she can feel it.
“I was,” he says. Sighs. “Am, I mean. Clearly I’m having a bad night.”
Dolohov grins at him. “Draco. Your parents will be so disappointed to know you’re still alive.”
He watches as Potter sits on the floor, back against the bed. He seems grumpy, a little exasperated by Draco already, or maybe still angry from before. Draco would never admit it out loud, but he almost prefers Potter like this. Their dynamic doesn’t really makes sense to him without a little animosity and though the memory of their almost-argument the other night sits heavy in his stomach, he has to admit he’s found it weird, them getting along so well. He’d been expecting something like that to happen sooner.
Harry grins. “Thanks, though it’s not technically my birthday anymore.” Then she yawns, right in Draco’s face.
“So, what?” he asks. “I got hit by fucking time-shrapnel and ended up stuck repeating the same shitty hours over and over?”
Potter shifts, swinging his legs off the side of the bed so he’s sitting facing away from Draco. Draco has a horrible urge to reach out and touch his back.
Moving in with Potter and a bunch of Gryffindors has been one of the unexpectedly better decisions of Draco’s life. Not that there’s much competition in that department. Aside from moving out of the Manor with little more than a
“Hi, again,” Potter says, voice pitched loud over the music, her hands still on Draco’s waist. They’re not doing anything, they’re just— there, warm. Draco can feel the broom-callouses on them and she makes a bodily effort not to shiver.
“Hey.” Draco leans back down over him. “Hey, Potter. C’mon. Can’t sleep now.” He doesn’t know what will happen if Potter falls unconscious, but he knows it won’t be
“Gin—” he starts but she glares at him and moans again. Harry shakes his head at her, grinning in spite of himself. She wasn’t especially loud when they were together and he really doesn’t see her like that anymore, but it still makes something in his stomach sit up and take notice. She’s beautiful, after all, and one of his best friends, and she’s on his bed.
That’s why he’d offered really, to shut Malfoy up. It hadn’t seemed like a big deal at the time, not when everyone else had already moved in at one point or another and there was room. The way Malfoy frowned at the offer, surprised and a little bit hopeful, had made Harry’s stomach feel warm, which, in hindsight, should probably have been the first warning sign.
Draco raises an eyebrow at that, momentarily distracted from her attempts at trying to watch Potter without risking the other girl seeing her. “Weasley? Since when do you talk to Weasley?”
,” she says, rifling through the pages herself. There’s a quiz with multiple choice questions and the title DENIAL: IT’S NOT JUST A RIVER IN EGYPT across the top. “Reckon I should tear this out and leave it on Harry’s pillow?”
Harry does so, even though his stomach jumps weirdly at exposing the vulnerable back of his bare neck to Malfoy.
Draco’s so angry — at himself, for knowing this was going to happen and not stopping it, at Dolohov, for having access to spells they’ve never even heard of, at whatever fucked up bit of magic is making him live this
“Yeah, I know, and it felt weird.” He slips slightly against the headboard, sliding down the bed a bit and pushing himself back up with a hand on the mattress that comes within inches of making contact with Draco’s upper arm.
Ginny flops onto the other sofa. “Going to move your bed down here?”
Draco had thumped him on the arm, hard.
They’re both on their best behaviour, mature and friendly whenever they have to interact. He slips up a few times, but only because Draco slips first, unthinkingly presses their shoulders together or turns to Harry, laughing at the kind of private joke they’re not supposed to have with each other anymore. You can’t just take those things
“Role reversal, I know.”
“Really.” Potter smiles, sheepish and quiet. “I didn’t mean to-- you know.”
is the only warning Draco gets before they’re squeezing through darkness and popping back into existence in an unfamiliar room. It’s dim, but enough light spills in through the huge window that Draco can vaguely make out the shapes of furniture.
Draco sits up properly where he’d been slumped sideways in the room’s only armchair. “Didn’t we have a conversation about Christmas being weeks ago?”
Downstairs, Ginny throws the remote at Seamus.
“Oh,” Potter says, a delayed echo, face breaking into a smile so wide it actually makes Draco’s face ache.
“I could--” Potter starts, grinning, but Draco shakes his head, ducking it and looking at Potter from under his eyelashes. He laughs when Potter frowns and makes to climb in.
“Draco. I’m serious,” Pansy pokes a finger into Draco’s cheek. She looks it too; she’s got her stern face on, which Draco is grudgingly impressed by. Pansy had been out with work friends before Draco had joined her and she’s put away considerably more drinks than Draco. “She’s single, you’re single, you clearly want to shag her brains out, she probably feels the same way..”
“You told me to keep it safe.” She looks at him like it’s obvious. “When we were in the house. You’re the only one who’s been living this over and over, so I figured if you knew to warn me, that’s what must have happened the first time around.”
Anyway, the point being, Draco’s always been a stubborn bastard. Probably even more so back then, when he still felt like he had something to prove, and he wasn’t about to let a little thing like having to run inside every ten minutes to throw up in Harry’s bathroom stop him from finishing the year.
Malfoy looks up at him and then down at his outfit. His cheeks darken, though his expression remains unconcerned. “Is it?”
He rolls his eyes. “And I’m going out. I need to get ready.”
) like it has been on his. It’s probably easy for him to joke about it like this because he’s done what Harry hasn’t, and moved on.
The thick window of the observation deck spans the whole length of the room. Draco pulled him up here when neither of them could sleep — time is weird here; Harry finds it hard to stick to a routine without the regular rising and setting of the sun — so no-one else is around, the space cool and quiet, the two of them sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the glass like kids in an aquarium.
Draco gets up to find his toiletries as Potter starts to lower himself back down. “Don’t break your neck.”
There’s a squawk as Draco shifts the bolt with a distracted
like there’s an
, Draco doesn’t have time to feel awkward.
Draco doesn’t tell her he’s never seen anything like it either, that he only knows because he’s lived this all before. He just keeps shuffling Potter down the road towards the car as fast as he can. Weasley seems to catch on to his plan pretty quickly, because he doesn’t ask where they’re headed, he just helps.
Potter corners him in the freezer aisle when the other two are off looking at wine. Draco can hear them, arguing over Shiraz, but the sound tunes out as Potter backs him up against one of the glass doors. It’s ice-cold against his back and Potter is very, very warm when he lines them up, knees to chest, his arms either side of Draco’s head.
he was about to be carved into, he’d be running in the opposite direction.
Harry sighs. “No, I. Sorry, I didn’t mean— you know.” He waves his hand vaguely. “You can sleep with whoever you want.”
She doesn’t finish the sentence, but Potter nods. “Yeah. Ok.”
not a Gryffindor.
The thing is, it isn’t really about the lobsters. Harry knows that. It isn’t even about Malfoy’s numerous other annoying food-related habits, like the smoothies he makes full of ingredients Harry’s never heard of, or how he lectures whoever’s around to listen about the benefits of spirulina and then ruins it by eating beans on toast three nights in a row. He does yoga and goes for runs and Harry once saw him eat jam straight from the jar with a spoon.
Ginny laughs at his wide eyes. “Not actual sex, you idiot. We’ll just make some noise. Make him
“Hasn’t it?” Ginny asks pointedly, raising her eyebrows.
Draco shrugs, glancing at him in the mirror. “We were at boarding school for seven years, Potter. What did you do in Gryffindor? Shower one at a time and get dressed in the loo cubicle?”
enough to have a reason to — and Harry realises he misses it, fucked up as that is. He misses all the things that you’re supposed to have in a relationship, the bickering and date nights and seeing your boyfriend’s face more than tri-annually. And once he’s realised that, well. He starts to wonder if you can even call what they’re doing a relationship.
Draco doesn’t have to leave until late, the Portkey scheduled for evening so that he has the whole day before he has to go back home. Harry cooks, makes a curry paste from scratch and gives Draco space to pack his things up. Once he’s finished though, there’s nothing left to do but leave it to simmer and wait for the rice to be done, so he goes in search of Draco.
, for want of a better word, and is waiting to see what Draco will do next? Draco isn’t blind. He sees the way Potter looks at him sometimes.
They take Dolohov slightly off guard, Draco thinks, when they find him in the bedroom. It’s hard to tell because his face is twisted and ugly and he’s too smart for his own good, so he might have seen them on the street, heard them coming, but there’s a split second of surprise that Draco takes and runs with as far as he can.
He sighs. “Want to swap?”
Draco starts explaining as he spins and drops down next to Potter, who’s awake but grimacing in a puddle of his own blood. Everything’s happened much quicker than Draco’s used to and it’s blindsided him, left him reeling and confused. Might be the fucking lump of brick that fell on his head actually, but either way.
“Thanks,” Potter says, looking only a little surprised at the compliment. “You don’t look so bad yourself,” she continues, with this dirty grin that has heat curling up Draco’s spine and then, “What did you think? About the match, I mean. Really thought we might lose for a couple of minutes after that bludger took Jones out but I spotted the snitch whilst Cooper was distracted. Lucky catch, I guess.”
Harry gives him the abridged version (the one where he hasn’t been secretly pining like a teenager the entire time) but when he’s finished, when Draco’s all caught up and he says, with a soft look, “Sounds like life’s pretty good, then,” Harry can’t resist pushing it, just a tiny bit.
“It’ll be good to see everyone, though.” Potter’s not really speaking loud enough for Draco to hear him all the way up here, but the day is so still and quiet that his voice carries. Often Draco doesn’t actually need to say anything; Potter can have entire conversations with himself, and Draco suspects he probably does, even when Draco’s not there. Potter does everything out loud.
There’s no time to try and leave. Draco’s pretty sure that’s one of the options Potter was going to suggest, but there are already footsteps on the landing. He hopes Potter’s other plan is something more detailed than just stay put and hope for the best, because that’s all Draco’s come up with.
Draco snorts, only half-listening. “I live here, too.”
“Alright,” Potter says, again. Draco can’t tell if it’s for their sake or his own.
Of course, when it goes quiet, it’s so much worse. He goes in after barely a minute of silence, has to see for himself that it didn’t work, that staying outside didn’t do anything to save Potter.
“They won’t hold,” Draco says. “I tried.”
The view as he steps out of the main doors is reassuringly familiar, with the forest at the end of the long lawns and the lake to the left, the greenhouses to the right. The grass seem to stretch on longer than it had when he was a child, though that’s backwards.
Draco laughs again, like he really can’t believe what Harry’s saying. “What?!” he echoes back. “How are you remembering this so wrong?”
“Funnily enough I don’t spend much time trying to walk across it.”
“Right,” Potter smiles. “So nothing, then.”
.” Draco could get angry, it’d be so easy. He’d been angry a lot right after the trials, a whole, long, overheated summer of fury and frustration. Knowing that his family deserved punishment and hating the Wizengamot for tearing it apart were not mutually exclusive feelings. “You don’t know--”
Draco is distantly aware she’s making some pretty loud noises but she can’t bring herself to care, not when Potter has her like this, not when she pulls at Potter’s wrist until she can bring her hand up to her mouth and suck two fingers into it.
“D’you want me to—?” she asks, though she’s not sure she actually has the energy right now, but it doesn’t matter because Harry shakes her head — Draco can feel the movement on her shoulder.
Potter only laughs that stupidly charming laugh again and sort of— shifts. She keeps wriggling around, dipping back on her elbows so the height difference between them becomes more pronounced and she’s looking up at Draco, smirking.
“Mhm,” he hums and then crawls right into Harry’s lap. The hoodie somehow gets bunched to the side in the process so that it’s just Malfoy’s arse, right up against Harry’s crotch. “I just thought I should check in, you know. Make sure you’re still ok with our living arrangement.”
. I didn’t say I paid.”
It doesn’t matter, either way. He still ends up with a lapful of half-dead Potter every time, but living the same thing over and over gives a person time to think about these things.
He keeps having these dreams where he walks to the very edge of the Hogwarts grounds, right up to the edge of the wards, which are always a visible wall of shimmering magic. When he steps through them the world dissolves into white and he’s stuck there, suspended in nothing, until he wakes up. They’re a lot better than the kinds of dreams he usually has but they scare him in a different way, like they might be real and if he tries to leave the school it'll be different when he gets back. Or, worse, that it’ll be like he remembers it from before and he’ll find that the castle he’s starting to relearn now will turn out to be something he imagined all along.
Harry’s assumptions were off the mark, apparently. Malfoy doesn’t go silent as he empties himself down Harry’s throat, though he does stop forming coherent words. He still makes noise, just not the kind that would carry so easily through a wall. Small, hitched sounds, and, underneath it — the thing that, weirdly, is getting to Harry the most — his laboured breaths, these huge, unabashed gulps of air as his mouth hangs open and he starts to relax against the bed, coming down from his high. Harry’s heard him moan all number of things, and it’s somehow this, the quiet, intimate sound of his breathing returning to normal, that has Harry mesmerised.
before they can drop off. And you apparently have such a high opinion of yourself that if you can’t sleep, no one can, so you’ve decided to drag me into it. I can stun you, if that might help?”
Granger casts several spells that don’t work, then tries something that makes Potter’s skin glow a cool blue colour, shaking her head. “It’s part of the curse. I think it’s blocking any healing spells.”
“Nothing feels the same anyway, Potter.”
He tugs on something lodged into Draco’s neck and Draco swears and succeeds in jerking his head away. Potter holds it up. It’s small and jagged and sort of shiny, glinting gold but wet with Draco’s blood.
His table is fairly full considering he was barely expecting anybody from his house to return. They’ll be getting some first years too, he assumes, unless the lot of them are so terrified of ending up Slytherin that the hat sends them elsewhere. He doesn’t spot many faces from his own year as he walks, of course, but that’s unsurprising, until his feet have automatically carried him to where he always used to sit and--
Draco lets herself be pulled away and she can feel Potter’s gaze on her back as Pansy pushes people aside to get them into the thick of the crowd. The music here is good, it’s another reason they like the place so much, and it’s easy to lose herself to the rhythm of it. Every time she spins and ends up facing the bar Potter hasn’t moved. She’s right where Draco left her, nursing her drink, gaze cool and steady and stuck on Draco, even as she listens to whatever Weasley is now rambling on about to the left of her.
Potter grins like he can’t help himself, thinking about his friends. It’s nice, because Potter’s smile always makes Draco feel nice, but there’s a twinge in Draco’s chest. He doesn’t know if anyone from Slytherin is coming back for a repeat year.
Potter rolls his eyes and Draco drops his hand, though not before Potter darts his tongue out and it makes contact with Draco’s skin for a split, hot second. “She’s a vegetarian, Ron, honestly,” he says, starting back up the aisle.
“Can’t help it.” Draco shifts back on the seat until he can dislodge Potter’s hands and pull the jumper over his head. He’s wearing another one underneath, layered up against the freezing cold, but Potter tries for a wolf-whistle anyway, his lips pursing around the non-sound that his mouth is too dry to actually make. Draco would swat at him for that, if he wasn’t bleeding out.
lost it.
“I’m coming in.”
Draco studies his reflection carefully in the glass. “I don’t know, Potter. Do you want to?”
Draco doesn’t even try to figure out how his seatbelt works, just shifts along until he can prop Potter up, kneeling half over him and tugging him down gently to lie flat when he realises the momentum of the car is making his head bounce all over the place.
“I’m Harry Potter,” Harry grumbles, backs off a bit, just enough that his face isn’t pressed to Draco’s collarbone anymore and he can look at him. “A few more minutes won’t kill them.”
For some stupid, self-sabotaging reason, Harry practically follows Malfoy upstairs. He could have stayed where he was, slept on the floor or at least dozed against the wall until enough time had passed that Malfoy was probably in bed, asleep, but instead Malfoy’s footsteps have barely faded before Harry’s up and covering a yawn, clapping people on the shoulder goodnight as he passes, climbing the stairs to the third floor.
Draco laughs at him again, runs his tongue over the inside of his own mouth, nods.
Comfortingly, the inside of Hogwarts looks the same as it always has, though it feels different, tired, like the stone walls can still feel the cracks that have been so expertly repaired. The grounds are different, in a way he can’t quite put his finger on. He hadn’t really spent that much time out in them before, preferring to stick to the common room or the Quidditch pitch except for when he had to leave for outdoor classes, so he’s struggling to remember what’s new and what he’s just never noticed.
meant anything by it. He knows Ginny is touchy about the whole thing considering her relatively recent realisation that she wanted to stop dating men altogether, but he isn’t fine watching her bring home other girls because he thinks they’re somehow less of a
He turns to Granger, the most likely of the three of them to understand. “I’m stuck in some kind of— time loop thing. I’ve already done this twice. I know who’s in there and what’s going to happen.”
“Nor do I much, really. Not with you.”
Potter might nod, or it might just be a full-body shiver. “Cold.”
“What the
“If we end up with matching scars, Potter, I’ll off myself,” he says, even though no-one’s listening. Dolohov’s busy trying to slam Granger through the wall into the next room, which means his focus is off his shield charm enough for Draco to get a wobbly stunning spell around it and he crumples, toppling over the bannister and landing on the stairs with a sickening thud-crunch noise.
sake!” Draco yells, and shoots a Stunner at his own head, too impatient to wait for unconsciousness to take its sweet time in sending him back to the start again.
The grin that breaks on Harry’s face a moment later confirms that she made the right choice. She bites her bottom lip to try and contain it with limited success and Draco can’t help but lean in, rolling them until she’s on top of Harry again. She likes this position; she could definitely get used to it.
The way Harry tells it, it all started because Draco lived on the ground floor. The building where Harry lives in Blackheath is hardly a tower block, no more than a handful of storeys, but his flat’s right at the top and it has a view of the park, the observatory visible from the front windows, and he has sole access to the shitty little roof terrace. It’s why Draco started coming over in the first place, why he ended up leaving his telescope and various other, less easily identified instruments shoved in a corner next to the few chairs Harry had bothered to set up there.
“You can’t,” Draco says, swallowing around the lump in his throat, but Potter just shushes him softly, and everything goes dark.
Ginny only pulls a face at him, slapping a hand on the wall that separates his and Malfoy’s rooms. She looks him dead in the eye and lets out an exaggerated moaning noise. Harry almost blushes.
Potter snorts. “You set fire to the tent because we ran out of teabags like, last week.”
Potter tries to say something in response but he can’t catch his breath, gasping through the pain, and Draco gestures at him. “Look at him!”
The kids Harry teaches think it’s the coolest thing in the world that he’s friends with an astronaut. He can’t tell them much — it’s a Muggle primary and the department that Draco works for is technically a secret, even to the general wizarding population — but they don’t seem to care. They get so excited that he spends way longer than he should on their module about the solar system, letting them build little papier-mâché planets and tin-foil spaceships until the classroom’s covered in crepe paper and glitter.
The living room, Harry’s starting to think, really has a lot of wonderful features. A neutral, communal space... close to the kitchen... good natural light... three floors away from Malfoy’s bedroom et cetera. Maybe he should just sleep down here from now on. He already seems to be spending half his time on the relative safety of the sofa, and it isn’t
Potter pulls on the clothes that Granger digs out of her bag and throws to him and then waves his wand, looking around the room expectantly until something thuds into the closed door. He goes to retrieve it, comes back with a whole load of those pill things the Muggles like to use instead of potions.
It feels, in the best way, like falling.
“Are we halfway?” Potter doesn’t even flinch at the mention of dying. Draco supposes he’s done it a hundred times over by now, but
None of Harry’s limbs seem to know what to do when they come face to face at the top of the escalators. He knows what they
“Thought you might want to come,” Potter says, casual, like that’s a completely normal thing for him to assume. Like they’ve spent any time together at all, really, in seven years.
Harry nudges at him playfully, hamming it up. “Oh you know, just had to piece my heart back together, no big deal—”
There’s quiet for a moment, just Potter’s harsh breathing and the complaining sounds from the car as Granger pushes the accelerator down as far as it’ll go.
Gently, fingers sink into his hair. Harry immediately stops breathing.
“Twat,” Draco says, fond. “You know that only works in England.”
“Did you just throw that?”
“No, it’s a-- way to get someone’s attention, I guess.”
Her mouth is open over Potter, her tongue flat as Potter moves up into the pressure and then, suddenly, comes just like that against Draco’s mouth, shaking above and around and beneath Draco, making noises that have Draco squeezing her legs together.
It doesn’t feel like somewhere to run away to, the unforgiving emptiness he’d thought it was, an echo chamber for the frustrations he’d wanted to hurl fruitlessly at the universe. It feels like a gift, like the kind of escape that’s only good because you know you can go back home again, when you’re ready.
“Have we not graduated to knocking on my door yet?”
Potter’s looking up at him. “I was going to go for a walk.”
He’s laid it on thick, but it’s surprisingly fun to needle Potter again, without the embarrassing desperation that used to underlie all of Draco’s mocking.
Draco watches him pick the frame up. He snorts as he looks at it, putting it back where it was. It’s a mean noise, and it plucks at some angry instinct in Draco.
ever—”
“Easy,” Draco repeats.
“S’pose we will,” he says, mouth moving against the edge of Draco’s palm. Draco shivers. It’s not because of the temperature.
“Put it down,” Granger advises, only mostly succeeding in not outright laughing at him, and they all watch the penguin hobble lopsidedly over the tabletop until it comes to a stop.
Potter gives him a weird look and Draco can’t find the energy to care.
That makes Draco’s neck feel hot, weirdly. Obviously Potter had meant the castle, not-- anything else.
The restoration work on the school is finally done, four months behind schedule, and Draco still doesn’t quite believe they’ve let him come back to finish his final year. He doesn’t know if he’s been given his own room because they want to keep him away from everyone, or if all the returning eighth years are being housed individually. So far, he hasn’t seen anyone but teachers. Term doesn’t start until late January but he hadn’t been able to stomach the thought of another three weeks in the Manor with his mother, who looks as though some large, vital part of her has been locked up in Azkaban with her husband.
“Nose down, Malfoy,” Granger sighs amiably.
Potter makes a neutral noise, something flashing so fast across his face at the mention of the Manor that Draco’s convinced he imagined it as soon as Potter’s expression smooths over again. He looks oddly-- right, there in Draco’s window.
“Stop staring at Malfoy and concentrate. I’m over here getting all sweaty whilst you’re hanging in mid-air with your mouth open.”

“Oh.” Draco almost asks Potter why he’s being-- is friendly the word? “Um. No, actually. I think I’m alright.”
, past tense, but it’s the truth either way.
“Sod off, my room has the best garden view.”
Potter pauses in the window, fixing Draco with an indecipherable look. Draco almost squirms. It’s the domesticity of it -- Draco’s embarrassed. He’s been at boarding school half his life, he and Potter even slept in the same bed that one, unmentioned time, and yet Potter seeing him curled up like this makes him feel vulnerable and weird. He’s very aware of his socked feet.
Harry blanches. “What?”
“Can you not?” he snaps, when Potter accidentally knocks a photo of Draco and his parents to the ground.
Malfoy shrugs. “A bit. Not as much as everyone else.”
“Hello.” It comes out like a question. Potter stares right back at him, and there’s a pause long enough to be awkward.
him through the wall.
“Well, I didn’t know if this was going to be one of your wake-Malfoy-up-and-piss-off-after-ten-minutes-for-no-reason kind of things, or whether you were planning on taking up more of my time. I can only pray for the former.”
It holds all the way down to the castle. Draco can still taste Potter’s magic around him when he’s back in his room.
Potter says nothing, glaring harder. He’s sunk down so far in the water that only his head is visible. Draco ignores him and starts washing his face.
It’s too polite, a nice, neat, formal lie, but Draco feels blindsided. He hadn’t thought-- he knew he’d have to see Potter again eventually, of course, but he hadn’t been expecting it quite so soon. Seven months, and he’s never actually stopped to consider what it was going to be like, which is stupidly hindsighted for someone whose main pastime used to be thinking about Potter and what he was going to do next time they interacted.
At this point Neville, who ran off with a pained look to surreptitiously
Malfoy yawns again and pushes himself off of the door. “I’ll cook them tonight if they’re taking up that much space.” He shifts past Harry to get to the bathroom. “I know a wonderful thermidor recipe.”
“Unfortunately, Seamus,” Luna adds, sipping her own tea. “We always know what you mean.”
“1999,” he sighs after a moment, fingers splaying outwards in an odd, half-joking sort of ridiculous jazz-hands move. Draco’s shocked into laughing.
that blasts the other half of the ceiling down on Dolohov’s head.
Merlin. “Ok, Harry,” Draco says, the name feeling so natural in her mouth that it’s weird. “You’re doing so good, Harry, love having you around me, loved how you lay still and let me taste you earlier.”
“What’d you do?” Potter asks.
This time, she manages to throw the ball at just the angle to knock his glasses right off of his face.
“Things?”
Potter’s grin gets bigger, if that’s possible. “We made it.”
Draco looks at the dark spots on the wood and pushes himself up a bit on his elbows.
“I don’t know.” He sounds like he’s genuinely never thought about it before. “It’s easy.”
“Granger,” Draco snaps.
Draco tries desperately not to let the way Potter says
Luna’s smile turns indulgent and she shakes her head. “He’ll figure it out. Draco’s not exactly being subtle.”
When he’s done, they don’t look convinced.
Draco sighs, put upon and dramatic. “Such an inconvenience.”
“We’re going in anyway, I know, I know,” Draco sighs. “You never bloody let me convince you to stay out here.”
He spends the morning moving all the furniture in his room, something he used to do periodically back at the Manor, shifting and rearranging whenever he’d felt like it. Back then he’d used magic. Now he drags the desk over by hand so it’s under the window, shoves his bed further along the wall so that he can see the tiny triangle of lake in the distance even when he’s lying on it. The noise of the furniture scraping on the floor and the pull in his shoulders feels necessary. He has to stop for a second halfway through, breathing heavily, and he almost, ridiculously, wants to just leave the bed right where it is, blocking the entire doorway.
There’s a compliment in there somewhere, but Draco’s brain is too busy catastrophizing about what would have happened if he’d been just a little slower. He shakes his head to clear it. They’re fine, they made it, it’s not worth thinking about.
Harry had thought it a little strange that a central university like the one Draco attended even offered this kind of subject, considering the obvious pitfalls of trying to star-gaze from the middle of a city that never turned its lights all the way off, but he let Draco complain anyway, let him keep coming over and brought him cups of tea sometimes, when it was stupid o’clock in the morning and he was still out there, shivering, eye pressed to the telescope. His course was a complicated mix of Muggle sciences and astronomy that Harry didn’t even try to understand, his time split between physics lectures and arithmancy classes and a three-hour Advanced Experimental Charms tutorial on Tuesday afternoons that Harry was pretty sure was taught by an Unspeakable, the way Draco steadfastly avoided talking about it.
“It’s also at your house, along with every person in the country who currently wants us dead.” Granger’s started on the wine. She has a book open on the table and a full, chipped mug with Potter’s face on, one she’d apparently bought in fourth year as a joke (Potter hates it, so naturally it’s the most used piece of crockery in the entire kitchen) and she prods at Draco with a socked foot.
“Morning,” Malfoy yawns, knuckling at one eye. He has on a ridiculous bathrobe and his hair is all over the place.
When Draco looks up he can just make out the way Potter’s cheeks have darkened. “I mean my room,” he clarifies unnecessarily. “I told them I didn’t need much but it’s nice, actually. I don’t like small spaces.”
Malfoy hums but says nothing more, hands beginning a steady rhythm. Harry’s had people play with his hair before, of course, idle, unconscious movements that were nice enough, but this feels different. Maybe because of the headache, or maybe because it’s Malfoy touching him. Malfoy’s long fingers carding through his hair. Malfoy’s soft breathing behind him.
Harry rolls his eyes, regretting it instantly as it makes the pain spike harder. “Nah, it’s just,” he waves his hand vaguely. “You know. The sight correction charm always gives me a headache.”
“He’s my
Maybe it’s the kind of thing you don’t ever get used to, though, or maybe Harry’s enthusiasm is infectious, because Draco’s in his element. He’s not really needed for the work that the rest of the crew are doing — some kind of satellite repair, from what Harry’s been able to figure out, and Draco works more in the research and calculation side of things — so he’s free to show Harry around.
“Right.”
“Not really? What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco can’t feel his toes and he’s not sure if it’s the temperature or if his shoes are pinching.
“Some of us,” she says, throwing the football at Harry’s head. “Actually want to play.”
“Potter,” Malfoy says against his skin, voice unfairly steady. “Potter. Did you know there’s absolutely no sound-proofing between our rooms?”
“I nicked it when we were in the Ministry looking for the locket. Figured it might be useful.” She has the grace to look slightly abashed. “Obviously I didn’t think something like this was going to happen.”
“I— what?” Draco, distracted from his attempts to hear whether Potter’s in or not, looks down at his friend.
” before he comes into Harry's mouth.
For some exasperating reason, Potter apparently doesn’t get the message about leaving Draco alone. Maybe it’s because Draco’d let him keep them up for another hour last night chatting about increasingly ridiculous ways to get Potter to fall asleep. It’d only been when Draco had unthinkingly suggested they find someone to tuck Potter in and Potter had blushed, visible even in the dark of well-past-midnight, that Draco’d had the sense to go back to bed, his eyes heavy and his skin wind-chilled. He’d slept right through until nearly midday this morning, waking from the remnants of a dream with a half-blocked nose and a confusingly warm feeling in his chest.
Draco narrows his eyes, but Potter’s not looking at him. “You don’t actually care.”
Harry snorts at the dramatics. “I did nothing of the sort.”
Blaise shoots him a look but rolls them easily, holding Draco in place so that he can cup him through his jeans with one hand. “
“Ron’s right, you know,” Potter says when he lets Draco go. The light from the freezer reflects off his lenses, and Draco blinks at him.  “What he said back in the car. This probably isn’t the time to start something.”
Draco knows their best bet is to just get out as fast as possible, but he can’t see how to get past Dolohov. Even the four of them together are not much of a match for a Death Eater who has nothing left to lose and everything to gain — Potter saw the way the Dark Lord punished Dolohov after Granger Obliviated him, had told Draco about it in a disgusted whisper, and the evidence of it is clear in that crazed sheen to his eyes. He’s desperate to get back on his master’s good side.
“Anyway, that’s not the point.” She fixes Draco with her stern look again. “The point is you need to just get it over with. At least if it all goes tits up I’ll be dealing with mopey Draco rather than this mess; she’s much more fun and likely to engage in spontaneously bad ideas. You’re so boring when you’re too busy trying to seduce Potter from across a room to pay attention to me.”
She’s got them out onto a busier road, steering through traffic, frantic, looking at every road sign they pass. “I don’t know,” she admits. “I thought a hospital maybe, but how would we explain how Harry got hurt? And if the wound is unresponsive to healing spells, Muggle methods might not work either.” She bites her lip, Draco sees her in the mirror. It’s a bad sign.
“Sorry,” he says, leaning heavily on the doorframe. “I didn’t mean that. I meant why. Why is yoga happening?”
Potter snorts a laugh and it kick-starts the violent coughing, almost doubling him over.
The backseat gets damp and sticky pretty quickly, Potter’s bleeding so heavily. Whatever batshit, magic-repelling curse Dolohov’s hit him with means none of Draco’s
Draco stares at him for a long second, eyes searching. Harry’s not sure what he’s looking for — he feels like all the love he still has is written across his face, all that useless, obvious love that has nowhere to go and ok, Draco’ll have to give him some time, cut him some slack for now, he’ll get a hold on it eventually, he
something when he’d qualified, promising he wouldn’t breach the Statute) and Harry wouldn’t do anything to risk his job. He can’t see himself doing anything else and schooling pre-Hogwarts still isn’t a thing for most wizarding families, so this is where he’ll be, for as long as they’ll let him.
“Mhm?”
“Love
A huge gash rips down Potter’s side, right through the layers of clothing to the skin underneath. There’s too much blood and shredded fabric in the way to see how bad it is but it looks to be the length of his torso at least, running all the way from the base of his arm to the waistband of his jeans. Draco swallows hard.
Malfoy apparently feels it too, because he whines again, ducks to suck at a spot on Harry’s neck that has his hips shoving up.
The this-was-entirely-my-idea-and-has-absolutely-nothing-to-do-with-Malfoy party, as Harry has taken to calling it in his head, starts at the embarrassingly early hour of 3pm. Or, truth be told, most people don’t show up until much later, but Harry walks in on Ginny and Malfoy mixing drinks mid-afternoon and they recruit him as their unwilling cocktail-tester until they all lose track of time and the day-drinking morphs into the official party without any of them really realising.
. He can bury all the squirming, longing feelings that have been collecting dust inside of him for the better part of two years, as long as it means they stop ignoring each other. If it means Draco talking to him again, Harry’ll gladly take a hammer to his own heart.
Draco meets his eye again, jaw set. “So what are you saying?”
Potter shrugs, throwing back the last of her drink. Draco watches her throat move and then quickly looks away, swallowing herself, as Potter raises two fingers from her glass towards the barman. He comes over straight away, of course, and Draco wonders when Potter’s ability to get anything she wants stopped being annoying and started being annoying
“You’re not even
The next day, time’s run out.
“We do have at least one bottle of gin left,” Hermione’s saying, standing on tiptoe to inspect the top shelf. “But I think Luna tried to infuse it with Dirigible plums and I’m not sure it’s still drinkable.”
Potter stops levitating the stone he’d been making float several inches above his upturned palm and looks up at Draco, eyes widening behind his glasses.
as in right now, in front of the frozen peas, or
Draco laughs humourlessly, face upturned to the dark sky above them. “If you say space I’ll hit you, Potter, I swear to God.”
“We’ll have to leave as soon as we can,” Granger says once they’re alone again. “You lot are still underage by Muggle standards and they’ll want to get the police involved.”
Harry grins, tilts his head. “Can I—?” he asks, trailing his hand downwards instead and stopping with his fingertips millimetres from the pucker of Malfoy’s skin.
Draco’s head is spinning and she’s still wrapped around Potter, who’s holding her up with apparent ease, grinning unashamedly as if she hadn’t just presumptuously apparated them both into what looks like her bedroom.
Potter walks in when Draco is already two drinks deep, a recipe for complete humiliation at the best of times and that’s if Draco’s being optimistic, which she isn’t naturally predisposed to be. Pansy stops halfway through the story she’s been telling her because Draco suddenly forgets how to behave like an actual human and makes a sort of flailing gesture at the barman for another drink. From here on out, more alcohol can only help.
of anyone suffering from a time-related injury like this before. And the fact that the fragment stayed lodged in you even when you managed to avoid the bag getting hit in all the timelines after..”
He looks down. There’s movement: Potter, standing in the square of light that Draco’s window casts on the dark grass.
“So.” Potter shifts again, letting his arms give out so that they’re folded on the ledge instead, feet, Draco assumes, finding purchase on the rickety trellis somewhere. He’s never still, Potter. He hasn’t been the whole time Draco’s known him. “This is your room.”
“I don’t see what your problem is,” Neville says, pulling open a packet of stilton and port crisps. He and Malfoy are the only ones who ever eat the weird posh flavours that Malfoy buys. Harry had assumed it was a Pureblood thing, but Ginny won’t touch them and he’d ruled Ron an automatic outlier on account of the fact that if it was edible, Ron would put it in his mouth. “You let him move in. You could have said no. And he’s been a surprisingly ok housemate.” He shakes the bag at Harry as if in demonstration.
Every step down from his room feels like an effort. He should have asked Potter, they could have-- but no, that wouldn’t have made it any better.
Potter had thrown a rock up at the unsurprisingly inconsiderate hour of half past midnight, when Draco had been considering a late-night bath before bed.
“You’d think
Draco’s used to the routine, is all: no classes, going where he pleases, studying when he wants. At night it feels like he and Potter are the only ones here, that the school is something secret and theirs. The castle’s been here long before they were born and if it’s survived this past year, he has no doubt it'll be around for generations to come, but still, Draco feels irrationally wary about having to share it.
Draco’s laugh gets stuck in his throat and he shakes his head, chin atop his folded arms. Potter won’t look at him; he can’t help looking at Potter. “You want to have an argument?”
happen and he’s still in the backseat somewhere, unconscious, reliving it in vivid detail inside his head. Either way, he can’t do much but follow Potter into the house and find out.
She says it with one eyebrow raised which, excuse her, everyone knows that’s Draco’s thing, how did Potter even learn to do that, and she’s just leaning there all cocky and sure of herself against the bar. Draco wants to mess her up. Who let Potter get this confident? It’s nauseating, except in the way that it’s really not and is making Draco want to get on her knees in the middle of this crowded bar.
attractive.
“What did you tell them?” Potter asks.
Harry shrugs, watches Draco’s fingers twitch the way they do when he wants a cigarette. Harry’s roof terrace had always been littered with ash and discarded butts before he’d made himself quit. “They’re just trying to help.”
“Come here, idiot,” Harry says into the darkness, voice slurred like she’s already half-asleep, and warm hands find Draco, position her until she’s on Harry’s pillow, with Harry lying half on her chest, one arm slung across her and their legs tangled. It’s too hot to be this close really but there’s no way Draco’s moving. She casts an absent-minded cooling charm over them as she closes her eyes and feels Harry press a grateful kiss to her collar bone. Then she sleeps.
Malfoy’s eyes go all hot and stare-y. He plants his hands on Harry’s shoulders and wriggles, smile innocent, as though he’s just shifting to get comfortable. It makes something in Harry stretch so close to snapping that his fingers dig heavily into Malfoy’s waist.
Almost definitely. And Malfoy’s too. And the sound of their mouths colliding, if, you know, Harry were to hazard a guess.
“Alright?” Potter says, looking mildly concerned. He’s standing next to Draco in the street. In the snow. With Weasley and Granger, and the half-ruined remnant of his first home in front of them.
, desperately, pointlessly, unable to turn it off.
He finds him standing on the bed in his socks, his bag packed neatly on the floor with his coat thrown over the top of it.
With the filters in his head washed away by inadvisable amounts of gin, he can acknowledge that it pisses him off being able to hear Malfoy, not because it makes him uncomfortable, but because it makes him want to go next door and shut him up. Kick out whoever else is in there, whoever it is that gets to pull sounds like that out of him, or, if he’s alone, tell him he needn’t be when Harry is right there and willing. Smother the noises with his mouth, swallow them down. Hear them breathed into his ear, up close rather than muffled through solid plaster.
“I didn’t want to shout in case I woke anyone up,” Potter adds.

groom doesn’t mean his speech needs to be longer than the actual ceremony. Someone to remind him that yeah, things are changing, and that’s always going to feel shaky and sad at first, but it won’t last forever.
he has to have someone in there with him. Harry had watched him climb the stairs alone but he’s never known someone make this much noise unless they’re getting fucked within an inch of their life. Maybe he has some kind of toy or something, or is fingering himself open steadily, other hand working his cock slowly as he shoves his hips down.
