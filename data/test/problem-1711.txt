That night harry was sat in the common room smiling about what had happened throughout the day, who knew spending a day hugging and being coupley with Malfoy would be so much fun!! He was aware of all the stares that they were getting but he didn’t mind, he’d spent his life being stared at hearing the whispers;
“Well I’m partnered with you, so less looking forward to it and more dreading it” he sent Harry his signature smirk.
Fourth year had been the Triwizard tournament and had been filled with multiple different whispers, some caused by Rita Skeeter!
It was about midnight when Malfoy got back to his common room. He led on his bed and pondered what the hell had just happened.
Harry slowly nodded his head and then waited for Malfoy’s response. When Malfoy chuckled Harry felt it move through him and it made all his problems melt away.
“Just follow me”, Draco could have sworn that Harry made a move to grab his hand, he had almost the same, that’s weird.
He must have been lost in his thoughts as he didn’t notice Ginny sit next to him. Even though they’d split they still classed each other as one of their close friends.
He walked into the entrance and all of a sudden saw Ginny storming towards him. She stopped just in front of him and sent him a subtle wink that only he could have spotted and also an apologetic look,
“It’s what school does to you mate” this had Weasley receive evils from Granger that dissipated when he kissed her cheek.
Draco smiled then swayed a little, went somehow paler and green at the same time, then his eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out in Harry’s lap.
“So potions, you coming Draco?” Why was Granger being nice to him as well? Didn’t he deserve to be excluded? He sided with Voldemort, he had gotten the dark mark.
“It’s true, he is incredibly scary when he first wakes up the hair everywhere and the glasses missing, he looks like a mermaid from the black lake.” Ron said with an evil grin.
He made his decision he span on his heel and ran back to where they had been, but it was deserted, Malfoy was gone.
Harry’s smile grew, where the Harry from last night, this person was all smiles, no hint at what Malfoy had seen. He decided to push this to the back of his mind and focus on the present, if Harry wanted to talk about it he would.
Why did Ron and Hermione keep looking over at him and Draco? He’d noticed it at soon as potions had started. Because they were only a small class, the pupils had been sat with each pair having their own table. Ron and Hermione taking the table to the right of Harry and Draco.
When it came to going to bed Draco started to walk to the exit and make his way to the Slytherin  common room when Ron grabbed his arm, “where you off to?”
Time stopped, Harry didn't know someone so pale could blush as much as Draco was doing now. He could hear his own heart beat speed up, why had she said that? Then he saw her face she was sending him a mischievous smile, almost daring him to do exactly what his heart was telling him to. She really did know him better than anyone.
The layout of the Potions classroom meant they had to sit in fours, so he ended up sitting with the entire of the Golden Trio, if his father could see him now.
They’d stood in the corridor for ages, him holding Potter, feeling the other boy breathing against him. Potter had eventually pulled away and looked at him, not talking just looked at him. Draco wouldn’t admit this to anyone but he had hoped the other boy would have kissed him, he almost had himself. He’d felt complete when he was holding Potter and when Potter had pulled back his front had felt cold, like the warmth had gone.
Harry slowly nodded his head and then waited for Malfoy’s response. When Malfoy chuckled Harry felt it move through him and it made all his problems melt away.
“Okay” Harry must have taken this as some king of hint for him to leave as he tuned to go, with a look on his face that looked like he was disappointed with this turn of events, “I’ll leave you alone then.”
“I don’t know”, Potter looked up at him defeated, he stared into Draco’s eyes and held them, Draco felt the frustration seeping out of him.
As no one would want to sit with him Draco decided to walk, it wasn’t far to the castle and it wasn’t too cold.
To say draco was confused was an understatement. All he could think about on his walk back to his common was his conversation with Potter. What had flashed over Potter’s face? Last he had heard Potter and the Weasley girl had been completely smitten and there had been rumours that Potter had proposed. Then why had Potter gone all quiet when Ginny had been mentioned?
Ron’s face fell, the split had been hard on both Harry and Ginny. The split had happened a couple of months after the battle of Hogwarts. The end of the war had been hard on Harry, everyone could see it. He wouldn’t eat, hardly slept and became very quiet and spent most of the time on his own. Ginny had tried to be supportive but he just pushed her away, they eventually agreed to end it but keep the split secret, Harry was still all over the magazines and they both thought it best to keep this away from the gossip columns.
Dinner was actually quite fun. Potter included him in the conversation as much as he could and Granger and Weasley, when they weren’t being all coupley talked to him as well.
Once they made their way back to Hogwarts none of them had any room for dinner so they made their way towards the Gryffindor common room. Neither the fat lady nor any of the Gryffindor students batted an eyelid or questioned the fact that Draco was with them, some of the students even smiled at him, said hi or asked how his day was.
Harry groaned and held him tighter, Draco knew Harry was a quidditch player but he was only now realising how strong he was.  He then felt Harry kissing the back of his neck then higher up, then on his jawline then his temple. Draco turned his head enough to catch Harry’s lips and then flipped his body around so he was on his front and then started moving forward making harry lie back on his bed.  Next this he knew he was straddling Harrys lap and kissing him with every ounce he had and it didn’t go any further as they were both splashed with cold water.
Draco’s mind was racing, he’d just watched Harry and Ginny have a full blown argument which has now resulted in Harry walking towards him.
He sat up straighter, and looked around him. The head movement made his stomach churn. Closing his eyes and holding the bridge of his nose did help, then he took a deep breath and thought back to what happened.
They’d stood in the corridor for ages, him holding Potter, feeling the other boy breathing against him. Potter had eventually pulled away and looked at him, not talking just looked at him. Draco wouldn’t admit this to anyone but he had hoped the other boy would have kissed him, he almost had himself. He’d felt complete when he was holding Potter and when Potter had pulled back his front had felt cold, like the warmth had gone.
Uni has been an absolute ball-ache but is finished for the summer so hopefully more chapter updates!!
Draco shared there confusion, how was this happening, he’d been back at Hogwarts for one night and already things were changing, it made him feel slightly uncomfortable, he was also being made uncomfortable by the worried looks Potter kept sending him,
Harry went into the common flopped on the sofa and put his head in Ginny’s lap, who had been reading there quite contently.
Slughorn was thrilled to see his favourite chosen one back in his classroom so they were forced to sit at the table nearest the front. The lesson consisted of a quick cover of what the year was going to involve and also choosing your partner for the rest of the year.
The start of the year feast was extravagant as always. Draco hadn’t had a proper meal in ages so he ignored the wary looks people were giving and just dug into the food. The eighth years sat with the houses as they always had so Draco was surrounded by his fellow Slytherins, a mix of those who took part in the war and those who didn’t.
Ginny face betrayed her, she was obviously trying to be caring but she burst out laughing instead, “Yesh you should Harry. The air might do him shome good”
“Do you think they have any idea?” Ron whispered to Hermione, he had his arm slung over her shoulder making it easy to talk quietly enough for just her to hear.
Harry chuckled, “why don’t we buy some sweets and find somewhere to sit? We can then meet up with the others later and walk back to school?”

The eighth years sat with the houses as they always had so Draco was surrounded by his fellow Slytherins, a mix of those who took part in the war and those who didn’t.
He was broken out of his thoughts by Ginny, “you two fancy coming to the room of requirements later? I’m throwing a ‘thank merlin those two idiots are finally together’ party. Don’t tell Ron but I stole his secret supply of fire whisky.”
The ‘love birds’ as they were going to be referred to in the future came over hands clasped together and sending heart eyes to each other.
Once they made their way back to Hogwarts none of them had any room for dinner so they made their way towards the Gryffindor common room. Neither the fat lady nor any of the Gryffindor students batted an eyelid or questioned the fact that Draco was with them, some of the students even smiled at him, said hi or asked how his day was.
“Starving!” Harry lead the way through the big doors and walked to where Hermione and Ron where sat.
”SHIT!” thankfully no one was near him to see how shaken he was. He ran his hand through his hair, he kept having similar dreams ever since the battle, same ending different place from Hogwarts, to the Manor, to Diagon alley etc.
Though it was nice to see them hugging he was suddenly swept with the feeling to join, and be a loveable rogue, nuisance. He wrapped his arms around them and grinned Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
Hagrid was waiting on the platform like he was every year previous, calling all the first years to follow and waving at the older pupils, he even managed to give Draco a small smile. The older pupils all went to the carriages, all of the ones who had helped fight in the battle of Hogwarts now seeing what pulled the carriages.
For a short moment he stood still staring at Ginny not sure what to do, everyone was looking at him, this wasn't how this argument was to go. Then he made his choice, it was now or never. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and started to walk towards Draco.
“Are you having an ‘affair’ with Malfoy?” she put air quotes around the word affair as they were no longer together.
Harry stood there for a few seconds staring at Malfoy. Then his eyes widened and he no longer looked confused, tears started to form in his eyes and a wide smile broke out on his face.
So the day of the break-up had arrived. Ron, Hermione and Luna were all in on it as they all knew that Harry and Ginny hadn't been Harry and Ginny for a long time. To make the break-up seem more realistic Harry and Ginny had been dropping slight hints to people about how 'annoying' the other one was being to anyone that would listen. Harry had a very strange moment with Dean when Dean started to list off all the things Ginny used to annoy him with and all Harry could do was stand there and listen and nod when appropriate.
“Would you want to sit near that?” Potter pointed towards Weasley and Granger who had their heads close together and were whispering and giggling to each other.
Draco looked at him eyes wide and repeated his previous question but with a lot more volume and followed by Harry raising his eye brows and walking towards Draco’s bed.
For some reason Harry felt touched, he just stared and the blonde and wanted to cry. So he kissed Draco on the cheek and rested his head on the other man’s shoulder, who rested his on top of Harry’s. He was surrounded by his favourite people and he’d never been happier.
When he was walking towards the classroom he heard talking coming towards him and saw that it was Potter and his friends, hoping they hadn’t spotted him he quickly entered the classroom. Once in the classroom Draco found the desk that was right at the back of the classroom as far away from everyone as he could be.
Draco sent him a wide smile, “Just teasing, I was genuinely touched by it, didn’t know who to thank, so thank you.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” He then got off his stool and wrote their names down on the list at the front. They spent the rest of the lesson making a Draught of peace. Potter knew that Malfoy was one of the better potions students and just did as Malfoy instructed him.
Draco shared there confusion, how was this happening, he’d been back at Hogwarts for one night and already things were changing, it made him feel slightly uncomfortable, he was also being made uncomfortable by the worried looks Potter kept sending him,
Once they reached the main part of Hogsmead, Ron and Hermione went towards Madam Pudiffoots for a bit of ‘coupley time’ as Ginny called it. Ginny herself went to join her classmates at the The Three Broomsticks. This left Draco and Harry alone with a difficult decision….
They stayed like that for the rest of the day, eating sweats and swapping stories and kisses in equal measure. Ron and Hermione eventually joined them, bringing with them drinks and cake.
Once inside the shop they bought a selection of sweets, Harry refusing to let Draco to pay for any of them. They then found a shaded spot hidden away but also with a clear view to see when Ron and Hermione leave the tea shop.
“Everything.” Potter moved his head so his forehead was pressed into the crook of Malfoys neck, he seemed to fit against Malfoy perfectly.
The rest of the lesson went by silently, McGonagall being the teacher she was no one would dare talk while she was, out of both resect and fear.
“That’s what I keep asking myself? You shouted Potter at me. You do that when I’m in trouble, or you’re stressed.”
Once they reached the dormitory Draco followed him in, confusion growing, once he was inside his heart leapt. His bed from the Slytherin dormitory was there, with his trunk, “whats going on?”
“Thanks, Ron I really do need it.” Draco took the glass, downed it and as Ron was telling him to take it easy he grabbed the bottle.
The first years were sorted into their houses all welcomed with open arms and the Headmistress McGonagall got up and did her final speech encouraging everyone to do their best etc etc, Draco just wanted to get to bed.
He actually apologised to Hermione when they walked to the great hall for food, “Hermione” he put a hand on her shoulder to stall her, “I need to apologise for all the times I called you a” he swallowed the word tasting horrible in his mouth, “a mud…..mudblood”.
“I got lost” this came out more as a question than a statement, he knew Hermione knew when he was lying.
What was happening in his head?! It felt like the weird sisters were havig a full concert inside his head.
They spent the rest of the weekend sitting around the fireplace in the common room, playing various games and talking about nothing in particular. Draco grew to love Ginny and could tell why Harry fell for her, he loved watching Hermione and Ron together, and started to feel bad for how he treated them in the past.
It was Ron who replied, “Does anyone ever look forward to potions?” this gained him an elbow to his side from Hermione. Which made Draco chuckle, they really were a cute couple.
Ron just rolled his eyes and went back to eating. Hermione was still looking at her friend concerned, apparently Draco wasn’t the only one concerned about Harry’s mood.
Draco looked at him eyes wide and repeated his previous question but with a lot more volume and followed by Harry raising his eye brows and walking towards Draco’s bed.
While they were packing there things away Potter asked Draco what subjects he was taking and when it turned out they were doing the same subjects he asked Malfoy a question that set everything else that year into action;
He was a bag of nerved from what had happened last night, both the moment he had with Harry, and the realisation that he wanted more moments like that with Harry. He started to bite his finger nails, another thing he never did, he had been nervous before, but never this kind of nervous.
They all walked to potions together as a group, which got them some confused looks from people who saw them, Draco Malfoy was walking with Harry Ron and Hermione?
All of a sudden the great hall broke into applause with a chorus of whoops and cheers and a couple of ‘Finally!’s thrown in. the two of them stood there bemused and completely in shock, not only because of the positive reaction they had got but also because they had spotted money being exchanged between students, and also some professors.
How had walked to the dungeons without us crossing paths? (He didn’t notice the piece of paper in Harry’s hands.)
“I’ll have one in the morning for now I want to sleep” Draco shot him a disgusted look, “It helps me wake up I’m groggy in the morning”
“That’s so cute!!” she grinned at him, then got a devious look on her face, “we should have a massive break up!! Full on argument in the entrance! Just imagine it” her eyes glinted with mischief.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug, kissing him on the forehead, Draco had a feeling he was trying to kiss the nightmares away.
He was a bag of nerved from what had happened last night, both the moment he had with Harry, and the realisation that he wanted more moments like that with Harry. He started to bite his finger nails, another thing he never did, he had been nervous before, but never this kind of nervous.
“I don’t know. I was supposed to go to the common room to be by myself for a bit. Then I found myself in the dungeons, then I saw you and I realised I didn’t want to be myself. That’s why I asked to you to follow me. Then I just kept walking and walking. I’m sorry for causing you trouble I just can’t be alone.” His eyes started to fill up, he could have exploded there and then and spouted all of his problems to the other boy, the boy he had hated for so many years, the boy who stood in front of him now, no longer with hatred in his eyes but worry. Draco Malfoy was worried about Harry Potter.
Draco had no idea why he did what he did next, he grabbed Potter and pulled him into a hug and held him. Draco Malfoy was hugging Harry Potter.
He wasn't sure if he should tell Draco or not what was going to happen. He had a feeling Draco had realised Ginny and Harry weren't a thing anymore, he wasn't an idiot and the amount of times he and Harry hung out with each other and Ginny never being there must have given him some evidence. Harry still loved Ginny but not in the way he used to, what he thought was romantic love had changed into a more platonic love, Ginny had agreed when he brought this up during the summer. They had agreed to keep it a secret but with whatever was happening between him and Draco,
“Just follow me”, Draco could have sworn that Harry made a move to grab his hand, he had almost the same,
He carried on going but harry just watched him, it was the cutest drunk ramble he had seen, Ron’s were usually incoherent except for the word Hermione, he was sure Hermione got more intelligent when she drank who can say discombobulate when drunk? But with Draco he just looked more human, more animated, than the persona he showed, and Harry knew exactly how to shut him up.
For the rest of the day whenever one of them caught Hermione, or Ron, or both looking at them they would do something coupley, either hold the other ones hand, place their head of the others shoulder or even hug the other one. They were too caught up in their game not to notice their students catching onto the way they were behaving, it was then that the rumours of the Draco and Harry “affair” started to spread.
“Okay” Harry must have taken this as some king of hint for him to leave as he tuned to go, with a look on his face that looked like he was disappointed with this turn of events, “I’ll leave you alone then.”
Though it was nice to see them hugging he was suddenly swept with the feeling to join, and be a loveable rogue, nuisance. He wrapped his arms around them and grinned Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
The Sorting Hat said its poem, a poem of remembrance for those who fought in the war, how all houses were now united and how everyone need to support each other and get rid of old prejudices and feuds. There was a mixture of clapping and tears when it finished.
“The first time we met inside Hogwarts was here and you refused to be my friend, this time I hope you’ll give me a more positive answer.” He winked at Harry because he kind of already knew the answer. “The first 7 years we knew each other I was a dick, mostly from a chip on my shoulder because I liked you, but you know all this already”
Dinner was actually quite fun. Potter included him in the conversation as much as he could and Granger and Weasley, when they weren’t being all coupley talked to him as well.
He must have been lost in his own thoughts as he hadn’t noticed Harry walk over to him, until he was stood right in front of him their noses almost touching. “Come with me?”
Draco was usually a very composed person but seeing the chosen one in his bed looking at him expectantly and patting the space next to him. Draco walked slowly towards the bed and sat on the edge tentatively now knowing where to put his hands or his legs. Next thing he knew harry had his hands around his waist and was knelt behind him pulling him into him. Draco put his head back and rested it on his chest, “we can’t do anything you know that? Ron could finish his concert at any moment and walk in on us.”
Harry stared at him with confusion, what on earth could Malfoy mean? A variety of scenarios then whizzed through Harry’s mind, the one that he liked most was the one of Malfoy grabbing him and kissing him. Blushing at this thought he just nodded at Malfoy.
During the lesson Harry couldn’t help but notice how close he and Draco were sat. The tables were large enough to have a cauldron on yet they were sat very close to each other, they were on different sides but they were close to the corner. His mind kept reminding him off this all the way through the lesson making the blood rise in his cheeks, this blush was deepened when Draco leaned into him and whispered:
“So potions, you coming Draco?” Why was Granger being nice to him as well? Didn’t he deserve to be excluded? He sided with Voldemort, he had gotten the dark mark.
He walked into the entrance and all of a sudden saw Ginny storming towards him. She stopped just in front of him and sent him a subtle wink that only he could have spotted and also an apologetic look,
He had almost kissed Malfoy. He still wanted to kiss Malfoy, if he turned around would he still be there?
“right” Draco cleared his throat, not for any reason other than to give himself time to think, “ he has an okay voice, bit pitchy  in places.”
He started to move his hand towards Malfoy’s face but one word made him drop his hand and walk away….Ginny.
“I’ll have one in the morning for now I want to sleep” Draco shot him a disgusted look, “It helps me wake up I’m groggy in the morning”
They burst into laughter and stayed on the sofa till Hermione and Ron joined them and the spoke about what had happened after Harry and Draco left the party. The jist was everyone got absolutely wasted, couples left early, people hooked up and more than one couple got caught by prefects in broom closests.
He was still thinking all this when they entered the room. A huge banner hung from the ceiling that would change from ‘DRARRY’ then to ‘FINALLY’. He really needed to talk to Harry.
“Do you think they have any idea?” Ron whispered to Hermione, he had his arm slung over her shoulder making it easy to talk quietly enough for just her to hear.
The four of them walked to potions together but in pairs, Harry and Draco walking a little ahead of Ron and Hermione.
Harry felt everything melt away and he just stood there, till Malfoy broke the silence “what’s wrong?”
There was no point lying to Ginny, she knew him better than most people. So he told her about what Malfoy and him had been doing throughout the day, he even added the part about him possibly liking Malfoy, it was Ginny, she’d have guessed eventually.
What was happening in his head?! It felt like the weird sisters were havig a full concert inside his head.
He spent the rest of the day hiding out in the library. One thing about being a known ex-death eater, people tended to stay away from you.
They had started to draw quite a crowd, students and some teachers had formed a circle around them, Harry was happy about this till he simultaneously spotted Draco with and eyebrow raised and heard Ginny say…
This broke them out of there trance. Because out of everyone in the room, that had sounded like Ginny.
So the day of the break-up had arrived. Ron, Hermione and Luna were all in on it as they all knew that Harry and Ginny hadn't been Harry and Ginny for a long time. To make the break-up seem more realistic Harry and Ginny had been dropping slight hints to people about how 'annoying' the other one was being to anyone that would listen. Harry had a very strange moment with Dean when Dean started to list off all the things Ginny used to annoy him with and all Harry could do was stand there and listen and nod when appropriate.
Harry’s seeker instincts must have kicked in because Malfoy had never seen someone turn around so fast.
For a short moment he stood still staring at Ginny not sure what to do, everyone was looking at him, this wasn't how this argument was to go. Then he made his choice, it was now or never. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and started to walk towards Draco.
“I brew my own Dreamless Sleep. Professor Snape taught me in our extra lessons. If you would like, I can make a double batch next time. I wouldn’t mind sharing, but be careful with it. Don’t take it too often because it can become addicting, but it will help you sleep better some nights so you’re not so sleep deprived all the time.”
“Yeah, I just had a thought. So, Voldemort gets his Death Eaters and his power base due to fear of any other option. Especially for those who are encouraged into the following by their parents. I simply wanted to know what could be done to stop that. Is the Order willing to help those who don’t want to follow in their footsteps? I just think while we preach equality and tolerance, why can’t we extend that same philosophy to those who want to go their own way?”
Harry started feeling antsy so after a quick glance at Draco and a goodbye to his friends, he headed up to his room. He knew Draco would still be awhile at breakfast so he grabbed his homework and headed down to the Room of Requirement. He had been ordered to write an essay on making the Dogbreath potion after he accidentally added the Fire Seeds too early and caused the cauldron to explode. The work was tedious and he sorely wished he had let Hermione help him with it. He was busy explaining the shade difference in the potion and how that connected with when he was supposed to add the seeds when Draco entered the room. Harry looked up completely confused.
“If you don’t remember seeing who attacked you, we could review the memory in a Pensieve. See if we can catch anything that would indicate who it may have been. I don’t want them free to get another chance at you.”
"Why not, mate? Thought we were going to watch the Ravenclaws kick ass?" Ron looked at Harry as if he'd grown a second, maybe third, head.
“She won’t cause problems. If this goes on too long, we may want to find an alternative ‘hiding spot’ to take her to and just show her what we’re working on when you’re not seducing me to the path of Darkness of course. Just to ease her mind and appeal to the Ravenclaw side of her.” Harry smirked at the blond, chuckling at his previous thought of the different house traits they all possessed.
“Draco left breakfast early and I didn’t see him come into Potions. I was worried something had happened to him, so I went and grabbed the map. I saw him down the corridor from Dumbledore’s office. Someone attacked him and he’s in bad shape. We brought him here and I’ve been here waiting for him to wake up. I was worried they might try again. I’m probably going to be in here for the rest of the afternoon. Would you make sure to copy the assignments down for me for the rest of the classes?”
"If something is bothering you, talking about it can make you feel better. They can help you figure out how to go about fixing things. That's what friends are for."
He waved goodbye and hurried out of the portrait. Thoughts of last night plagued him on the long walk to the Great Hall. While Draco had been friendly with him the last couple of weeks, he hadn’t expected that level of empathy and kindness. It was slightly unnerving to see Draco without his usual snark and the comfort he had felt was unsettling. He found he didn’t mind though. When he had fallen asleep for the second time, he had slept better than he had in years. It gave him food for thought while he picked apart his scrambled eggs. While he ate, he eyed the Slytherin table waiting for the blond to show up. There was warmth in his belly and a smile on his face when he saw him appear at the table. After they shared a quick smile, he dug into his breakfast with renewed vigor. Hermione raised an eyebrow at his smile when the two appeared at the table with him.
Harry nodded, pulled his cloak around himself and left the room. He watched the map for any earlier risers and snuck back in the portrait hole. He paused seeing Hermione awake and curled by the fire reading. He creeped past her careful to not make any noise and made it up to the dorms. Miraculously, no one else was awake. He packed the map and cloak in his trunk and started getting dressed while the other boys started stirring for the day. He muttered good mornings and headed out to the Common Room.
“But have you looked at guys? You’re in the Quidditch locker room often enough. Ever get curious and just sneak a peek?”
“Stop by anytime, Harry. I’m always happy for a chat. Now run along to breakfast, you need to keep your strength up.”
"Just tell me. You're more of a fool than I thought if you don't think you can trust me right now." Draco still looked quite uncertain.
“He’s alright, Dobby. I was just wondering if you could bring us some of dinner. Draco’s not going to be able to make it down to dinner and he didn’t eat lunch. I’m going to be here as well.”
"Well, if you think about it, they do have something in common. They both want to keep someone out of our world. Voldemort wants to keep Muggleborns and half-bloods out and the Ministry wants to keep Death Eaters and Voldemort out. They will also do absolutely anything to get what they want, no matter who they hurt. The Ministry may say it's all for the Greater Good, but look at what happened in the Triwizard Tournament? They were willing to let the 4 of us die to save face. Cedric did die." He saw Draco wince and mildly regretted his statement. "Or with Sirius. They were willing to give the Dememtor's Kiss to an innocent man because they did not want to admit that they had been wrong or that they had been proven wrong by a child. Last year, they didn't want to admit that Voldemort was back because it didn't fit in with their plans. I was nearly expelled, Sirius is dead, they foisted Umbridge on us, and the 6 of us were nearly killed by Death Eaters at the Ministry." Once again, Draco had a pained look upon his face.
Harry walked as quickly as he could to Dumbledore’s office. After a quick Lemon Drop to the guardian, Harry started the long trek up to Dumbledore’s office. Despite his confident assurances to Draco, he was a little worried on how the conversation would play out. Draco’s comments on choices, paths, and branches kept circling in his head. He also still had Ron and Hermione to worry about. Their reactions to what would would happen if things worked out with Draco were just as important to him as this conversation with Dumbledore. He took a deep breath and the top of the stairs and pushed his way in. Dumbledore stood next to the windows looking out across the grounds and turned to face him.
"Potter, I'm in too much pain to hate you right now. Even though you did try to kill me, I owe you my life for knowing how to save me." He looked up at Potter and winced at the movement.
"It's my fault. I was going to use one of the Unforgivables. If I was in your place, I would have let me die. It's no less than I deserve after all that's happened." To his shame, his eyes started welling with tears again.
“Less friendly people than you I’m sure. Not much to worry about. They can’t aim for shit. Now tell me about your exciting day.”
The boys horsed around getting dressed and headed down the stairs laughing. They caught up with Hermione and headed to the Great Hall. He was happy his friends were working towards breaking their ideas and looking forward to a better future. As he sat down and grabbed his juice, his eyes wandered over to the Slytherin table. Draco was sitting by himself again and Harry gave him a small thumbs up when their eyes met. He nodded with a small smile and went back to his breakfast. The Gryffindor table was particularly rowdy this morning and Harry found himself getting lost in it. But every once in a while, his eyes wandered over to a quiet blond in the corner. Hermione noticed his glances and gave him a curious glance. Once they were finished eating, he dragged them off to class.
Once in the room, he settled his stuff at the table with a sigh. An undercurrent of anxiety thrummed through his veins. He toed off his shoes next to the table and laid down on the floor on his back. He settled himself comfortably and started relaxing his body. Breathing in deep, tightening muscle groups one by one from head to toe, releasing the breath. As thoughts creeped into his brain, he pushed them to the side and continued focusing on his breathing. He lasted about 10 minutes before he was drifting off to sleep.
“Sir, I already have a place to stay here. I’d prefer not to mention where because the less people that know, the better. I promise I’ll be safe there. As for a source of funds, I do have a private account at Gringotts that my parents don’t know about. I’ve been saving my allowance and gift money there for quite a while. I have enough for the moment. If we are able to get my stuff from the Manor as well, there are several things I am more than happy to part with to keep myself afloat. Money is the least of the least of my worries right now.”
“I haven’t looked at anyone. I never even thought of it as an option really. I actually change in the stalls. I spend long enough in the shower that everyone’s gone by the time I get out. “ He looked embarrassed at the thought.
“I’ve...had all my essays completed. I’ve just been doing a little light reading and helping Ron with his homework.” Her eyes were downcast, a little shy at the normalcy of the studying situation.
“Thanks, Ron. I know how hard it can be to change your ideas. And I’m glad you’re open to it. Now, let’s go and get some breakfast.” Harry clapped him on his back and got out of bed.
"Why don't…" Harry hesitated, obviously lost in his thoughts, "I mean, we can't exactly talk in front of everyone else. How about we meet here once in awhile, just to keep this up?" He looked hopeful.
A flash of white lashed like a whip from Harry's wand towards Malfoy. The pure white was soon overridden by splatters of red. His robes were in tatters and deep wounds appeared along his face and chest. He fell to his knees choking on the blood running down his throat. Harry ran towards his, a wordless cry on his lips, and fell to the floor next to him. He issued a gentler cutting charm against Malfoy's robes and pulled them away from the wounds.
“No, you’re fine. I have them too. I’m glad I was here to wake you out of it. What do you dream about?”
“You’re in the hospital. I found you outside of Dumbledore’s office badly hurt. We brought you here and you’ve been unconscious since the start of Potions, I would assume. Do you remember who attacked you?”
“Well, all it’s doing is causing me stress. Do you know I’ve spent most of the day just checking people out? I don’t know what I’m supposed to be looking for or what I’m supposed to be feeling when I look at someone I’m attracted to. I don’t know what it feels like to be in love.”
“But how do we really know they want to change sides? I know you want to believe the best of people, Harry, but can you really trust them? What if they’re just trying to get information for You-Know-Who? Death Eaters just can’t be trusted.” Hermione stared at him meaningfully.
"And he would go that far, wouldn't he? You don't have to kill him, you know. He can help you. He won't hold your past decisions, your parent's decisions, or what you've been put up to against you. He's not like that." Harry rested his hand on Draco's arm.
Dumbledore was gone quickly leaving the two boys alone. The silence grew steadily with both boys deep in thought. Draco was overwhelmed with the idea that soon, his parents would have no more control over him. Freedom he had craved was soon close at hand and the idea was exhilarating. He would finally have the choice to choose his own path and forge his own future. The brunette next to him was lost in thought of how his friends would react to the news. An official denouncement of Voldemort and his parents would go a long way towards helping his friends accept Draco. Avoiding and hiding from his friends was eating him alive and not having to hide his relationship with Draco would ease much guilt from his mind. He looked up startled as he repeated the last sentence in his head. Relationship. He was jarred from his thoughts by the blond’s sudden laughter.
"Can we switch subjects? I can't deal with much more of this." Harry rubbed his arm and they started talking about all sorts of nonsense from the antics of their housemates to their classes. Draco helped him with his Potion's essay and he helped him with Draco with Charms. The tone was shockingly easygoing and the time passed by easily. Soon, it was time for them to head to their respective common rooms and see who won the Quidditch match. Harry peeked out the door to make sure there was no one there and they both headed out. They tossed a wave over their shoulder and continued on, both lost in their thoughts. Harry entered his common room, saw Hermione and handed her his Potion's homework.
“No, Hermione. He’s been helping me with a project. He’s had personal lessons with Occulmency. He saw me looking into it while I was picking up books on meditation and wandless magic and thought I might want some advice outside of books. That’s all.” He crossed his fingers behind his back and prayed for her to believe him.
He muttered the spell, sent the crane back and went back to his potion. Looking up, he saw Hermione staring at him intently. He gave a cheery wave and cringed internally when the crane came back. She glanced at it briefly, then looked between Draco and him. He sighed at the interrogation he was going to get from her and prayed she didn’t mention it to Ron.
“I have Hermione collecting homework for us for the day and Dumbledore has the both of us excused. You missed lunch and it’s almost dinnertime. Madam Pomfrey will bring something by or I can call Dobby and see if he’ll bring something up from the kitchens for us if you’re hungry. How are you feeling, any better?”
“Definitely here tonight. I have spare clothes in the closet and there’s no need to go back. I enjoy having a good night’s sleep without spelled curtains, then double checking when I wake up panicking in the middle of the night because I can’t remember if I spelled them before I went to sleep or not. It’s peaceful sleeping here. Even with a snoring Boy Wonder.”
“Do you mean guys? Why would I be interested in guys?” The genuinely confused look on his face concerned her.
The end of his rebuttal stopped Draco in his tracks, a look of shock on his face. He opened and closed his mouth a couple times almost like a fish out of water. Harry paused, considering if he had crossed a line, before Draco doubled over laughing. Nervous chuckling followed before Harry was joining him in the belly-deep laughing that had them gasping for breath. The tension effectively cut, the two’s laughter trailed off while they wiped their eyes of tears.
“I will say, I have never heard a more apt description of the Dark Lord, that’s for sure. The noselessness is a little bit odd, isn’t it? I’d wondered if it’s because something went wrong with him coming back or if it was like that before he fell. Are you sure, absolutely sure, she isn’t going to cause any problems before I’m able to come to a decision? I may not wish to follow in my father’s footsteps...But I’d like to be alive to make the choice.” Draco sobered quickly and watched as Harry thought about it.
He took a deep breath after the unintended speech and returned to his food. Somewhere in the middle of it, more than just his two best friends decided to listen in and caused everyone around him to take a good hard look at the other tables. Breakfast that morning gave more than just food for their bodies; it gave them food for thought. Harry decided to sneak a glance at Draco and he found him staring at him intently. He smiled quickly. His appetite came back with a vengeance and as he was eating he though Sunday just couldn't get there soon enough. There was so much he wanted to talk to Draco about.
“Harry, you want me to believe that you had a FEELING that Mr. Malfoy was in trouble and you had a FEELING of where he would be?”
“I always have the time for you. Please, have a seat.” He gestured towards one of the comfy armchairs in front of his desk, while taking his own seat.
“Harry. Wake up!” Harry opened his eyes groggily to Ron shaking him awake. “I wanted to talk to you for a minute.”
Harry sneaked a peek at Draco, only to see him hunched over a letter with his customary scowl etched in his face. He stared at the offensive letter as if he were trying to set it on fire with sheer power of will and it made Harry curious as to who it was from. He idly munched on a cookie from his package and half-listened to Ron and Hermione arguing over who would win in the upcoming Quidditch battle. He had no intentions of watching the match. He knew he'd have to come up with some excuse as to why, especially with his love of the game, that no one would question.
“We’ll get to why girls cry when they kiss you later. Are you gay?” Draco steepled his fingers and stared down his ex-nemesis.
“It’s fine. It’s 5. I don’t sleep much to begin with. What’s another sleepless night if it’s for helping a friend?” Harry quieted at the sentiment.
Draco shrugged uncomfortably. “It’s easier sleeping in a den of snakes when you’re still on the same side. I’m always being watched and monitored. I don’t know who will still be on my side when I don’t complete my mission.”
He paused for a moment, tapping his wand on his knee rather than continue the irritating tapping and receiving another lecture. He watched as silver sparks emitted from the end of the wand, almost like his thoughts were expressing themselves through it. He held it up thoughtfully.
Harry watched as Hermione and Ron left the Hospital Wing. He waited for a moment when he saw Madam Pomfrey entering Draco’s curtains to check on him. He sighed deeply and entered when she left. He was in for a long afternoon.
“Can’t let the boyfriend worry. Run along, Potter. Extend the invitation to our study party to Granger and let me get some rest.” Draco waved him along while Harry sputtered denials.
"This is delightful. It writes so much better than our quills! I wonder why we don't use them." He handed the pen back to Harry. Harry hesitated before handing him a notebook and a pen.
"Just thinking about life. How one decision can affect someone's entire life. What it means to forgive and what it takes for it to happen. How our choices affect everyone else around us."
"H-harry," He stumbled over actually using his first name, "I just don't know what to do." And against everyone else in his life's voice screaming in his head, he allowed the Golden Boy to draw him in and hug him.
"Sky blue is two shades lighter than light blue! Though, I still don't think it makes much of a difference. Blue is blue."
“Draco, it’s just a dream. Come on, wake up. You’re safe here. They’re gone. Come on, Draco.” After shaking the boy for a minute, Draco came to.
"It's...strange to think our upbringings are not much different. I was also harshly raised, but in another manner. Lessons with my father about how to uphold and further the Malfoy name and Dark Arts. Failure resulting in painful curses and torture. And then the Dark Lord coming back. I never felt quite comfortable in my home, but then all safety was gone. There wasn't even any pretense of a safe haven anymore." Draco trailed off and Harry couldn't resist. He scooted his chair closer to the other boy and wrapped one of his arms around him. They sat in silence for a few moments before Draco physically shook himself out of it. He gave a wry smile before switching the subject. "How would you like to learn from someone who knows what they're doing? Occulmency wise at least. I don't know anything about meditation. Maybe that's something we can learn together?"
“I finished dinner early and although the conversation was titillating, I wanted to get a head start on the Defense essay. It’s not difficult, but I am very interested in the subject matter. If I’m not careful, I’ll make the essay 4 parchment scrolls long and the Professor will take points off for being too long.”
"How difficult would it be to use magic without words?" That was enough to catch her attention from her essay.
And then the Dark Lord had come back. Threats towards everyone he loved had caused him to accept the one mission he never wanted in the first place. His father had lost favor with the Dark Lord and his life hung by a thread. If he wanted the ones he loved to live, he would have to kill the one person who had kept his hopes alive. Despite all his attempts to dissuade him, Dumbledore continued his efforts to try to bring Draco to his side. He frequently brought him in for one-on-one heart to hearts, discussing how things were at home, whether he was getting along well at school, how he was feeling. Despite how rotten he had been, Dumbledore thought he could be redeemed. The mere thought of having to kill the man who he looked up to and respected nauseated Draco and was one small piece of what caused his decision to accept Harry's offer.
"I don't blame you for what your father has done. I would never hold the sins of the father against the son. The only thing you are responsible for is your own actions and you've already said that you want to be done with it all. That's enough for me." Harry smiled at him.
“Hello, Draco. Got started early? What are you working on?” Harry sat opposite of Draco and started pulling books out of his bag. Hermione hesitated before setting her stuff by Harry.
Did he really think he could manage it? He had enough trouble sitting still for classes. But he knew it was worth the effort. Being able to cast a spell, no matter if he lost his wand or it was broken, could be the difference between succeeding in his mission and dying. His other classes passed by slowly and finally, classes were done. He used the extra time before dinner to stop by the library. He perused the stacks, quietly muttering to himself and he searched for books on wandless, wordless magic and anything he could find on meditation. In his looking, he came across something called Occulemency. After checking out his books, he packed them away in his schoolbag, casting a quick lightening charm and headed to dinner.
“Almost breakfast. I just wanted to talk for a minute...about what you said last night. I just wanted to say that you were right. I know you see things differently than most of us do. We grew up in this world. We were taught loads of stuff that we probably shouldn’t have been. And I know that it should change. We’re growing up. We’re about to leave Hogwarts and become the next generation. If we don’t change, the cycle will just continue and who’s to say we won’t accidentally create the next You-Know-Who, right? I just wanted to say… I’m in. We can change the world by defeating him and by setting a better example for everyone else as well.” He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.
“Yes, sir. 100% hypothetical. I was doing some thinking. We know Voldemort gains and keep followers due to fear. Threats on people’s families and loved ones. If people knew there was protection, that they could be safe, they’d be more likely to leave Voldemort’s side.”
"I come here to study sometimes. The common room can be quite oppressive and there is a lack of privacy in the dorms." Draco gestured to the chair next to the table he was working on.
"It'll be ok. You don't have to be the bad guy. That's the great thing about having free will. You have the option to decide if what side you want to be on, what you want to do with your life. I'm willing to help if you decide you want to be a part of our side."
“It’s a bit of a blur, really. I was going to Dumbledore’s office and then there was someone behind me and then curses flew. Then, a blank until waking up here.”
They dropped the subject reluctantly as they reached the Transfiguration classroom. Harry tried to focus on his classes, but Ron and Hermione couldn’t help sending worried looks his way. With a heavy sigh, he reached the Potions classroom and quickly took a seat by himself in the last room. He urged Ron and Hermione to take seats elsewhere and pulled out his textbook and parchment for notes. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the blond trail in behind the rest of the Slytherin’s. He took a seat at the opposite table at the back with him. An almost unnoticed smile and they both sat in silence waiting for Slughorn to start the lesson. While he was copying down the special instructions on the board, he saw a paper crane float his way, wiggle itself flat and slide itself under the parchment he was working on. After he copied the instructions, added the first ingredients and set the timer for the stirring of the potion, he slid the parchment out from under his work.
Draco vaguely remembers Potter saying something, asking if Draco was going to be all right. Or – Potter might’ve just told he had been dancing with Dumbledore, Draco couldn’t say. He was quite inebriated.
Draco wonders, what the bloody hell that was, and if Auror Quinn – who Draco thinks with a mild irritation, is too good-looking to be an Auror – had perhaps learned something that could help solve the case.
Their conversation quickly moves to Quidditch, and to the final matches of the season between the Hogwarts houses. An hour later, their group has finally emptied their plates and returned to their common room to take care of their homework. It is not until later that night, when Albus has retired to his bed, that he remembers the argument between Scorpius and his brother. Albus decides to find out what is going on, and decides to confront Scorpius the next day.
Keir shakes his head slightly, still taking notes, and Potter then proceeds to go over Hazel Scott’s and Skylar Westen’s questionings; as both Westen and Hazel Scott had left unmentioned the incidence in the train corridor between Albus, Scorpius and Travers, they too will be questioned under Veritaserum the next day.
Malfoy blinks quickly a couple of times, but his expression stays impassive otherwise, as he looks at Harry. “It would be highly unprofessional. Not to mention, unwise, all things considered…”
Albus’s lips twist into a rueful smile, but he doesn’t look at his father. He keeps his eyes at the floor as he speaks. “I dunno, dad,” He finally says, thinking back when he realised what was happening between his parents. It was last summer – which to Albus, feels like a lifetime ago. Everything had been different then. Scorpius had spent some of his holiday at the Potters, and everything had been…
Scorpius shifts in his seat, taking a surreptitious glance around them, but Albus knows nobody’s paying attention to them. Everyone is focusing on taking their seats at their house tables, eagerly waiting for the feast to start, or still emerging into the Great Hall from their carriages.
Draco watches Weasley take in the news, the confusion and then the dread taking over his expression, but for some reason, he doesn’t feel a bit derisive towards the ginger-headed third of the Golden Trio. He watches Weasley to make a number of floocalls as well, and wonders, if he should be informing someone about his son’s situation. He already knows the answer
“Okay, thanks. Then, I suppose, meet me at the Three Broomsticks, let’s say…” Potter mutters, checking his watch, “in three hours. If you’re done by then, that is?” He asks, giving Draco an inquiring look.
Hermione looks terrified; her hair, the usual neat hairdo is all over the place, reminding Harry of their Hogwarts days. Her eyes are shining with tears and her hands are shaking.
“Where’s Quinn?” Potter, who has schooled his features into a serious expression, asks from the grumpy one – Keir, Draco thinks.
After murmuring good nights, he headed up to the dorms. Changing into pajamas and laying down in bed, he sighed. While Hermione hadn’t given a firm decision on whether or not she would accept Draco, he took studying with them as a good sign that she was going to give him a chance. He didn’t expect that she would accept him overnight, but it had gone much better than he had originally expected. He hoped she wouldn’t try to deck him again, though he did grin at the thought of it. Watching Hermione get riled up was more amusing than it should be. Ron was going to be the difficult one. While Hermione suffered quality of abuse, Ron had suffered quantity. Besides Harry, there was no one the Slytherin enjoyed torturing more than Ron. He filed it away to consider more at another time, rolled over to readjust again, and finally drifted off to sleep.
“I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. No need to be sassy. And I am perfectly amicable to compromise with those who are able to see sense.” Harry grinned.
The trio descended into their respective research. Hermione and Harry split the books and took careful notes. Hermione was delighted to see Harry’s notebooks and pens as much as she loved the parchment and quills. As they discussed the research back and forth, Draco occasionally spoke up from his own parchment with advice as the only one of them with practical experience in the matter. They settled into a quiet rhythm and Harry was delighted to see how quickly Hermione relaxed at the situation. Appealing to the Ravenclaw side of Hermione was definitely the right move. After a couple hours of studying, Draco was done with his paper and Hermione and Harry were desperate for a break. They quickly packed their books and papers up and stowed them away. Harry waved Hermione on as they started to leave, so he could have a moment to talk to Draco alone.
"I still haven't finished my Potion's essay and I thought I'd get that done and spend some time studying."
The two of them descended into a play by play of the game. Harry settled back against the couch and listened to them chatter. He added in his input here and there but his thoughts were caught up with Draco. Hearing everything that was going on with him certainly gave him a different view of him. The new perspective was shocking and unexpected but he found that he liked being able to see Draco as more of a human. He had been his enemy for so long that is was refreshing. He knew that Lucius was an asshole but he never knew that it was that bad. He wondered how Ron and Hermione would react to everything that was going on with them. He hoped he would be able to tell them soon but until then, he could sit back and enjoy everyone's company.
“Shove off, Malfoy.” Harry grew slightly uncomfortable thinking about Hermione’s conversation earlier. “I think he’ll be alright without me for an evening.”
"I think…I think I want to be good. I can't stand it anymore. I didn't want any of this to begin with. I think I want to start over…Starting with you, Harry."
Harry agreed with a quick grin. Maybe this would go a long way towards their friendship. Finding common ground and common interests. Taking it one step at a time towards their common goal. For a moment, their friendship didn't feel so far fetched. Maybe there was hope for them after all, he thought quickly before dividing the books between them to start their research. Together.
“I’m glad to hear that. We’ll need to work on a safe house for you to stay at, your emancipation from your parents, a source of funds for your school work,and a place for you to stay while you’re at Hogwarts. I do not think it will be safe for you to remain in the Slytherin dorms after this.”
"Why can't we be both? Hermione is a thinker and she's in Gryffindor as well. I get that all our Houses have our separate qualities that we are known for but have you thought that maybe there's more to us than just those qualities? We all have qualities of the different Houses but the Sorting Hat put us in the Houses that we are most like. We don't intermingle much either. So how are we to know that a Slytherin isn't compassionate and brave? How do we know that a Ravenclaw isn't passionate or that they can't act before they think? And how about us Gryffindors? Hermione is booksmart, like the Ravenclaws, she can be sly and cunning like a Slytherin, and she cares deeply about her friends and family like a Hufflepuff. But it's her willpower, her determination to fight for what's right, her fearlessness and her bravery that makes her a Gryffindor." He looked at Hermione who was deep in thought and nodding in agreement. "We're no different than everyone else here except that the Sorting Hat saw a little more of one quality in us than another. Even those who are in Slytherin. They value their friends and are willing to fight for them. Some of the value knowledge as much as even Hermione does. Yes, some of them side with He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named but they do it with the same single-minded determination in which our side follows Dumbledore and I. Just think about that."
When he finally sits down in his favourite armchair and allows Draco to rest by his side, his patience is frayed thin but he has to withstand the temptation for a few minutes longer. His lover is not yet ready for the next step of their session. So he waits and watches.
“Panties, really? You won’t need them tonight, so take them off. I want to see what’s mine at any given time.”
His suit is cleaned and ready, expensive Italian wool, hand-woven with magic-infused threads. There are more special properties, but he’s forgotten them conveniently, although Draco would point out how savage he is to not appreciate the suit in the right way. Harry just likes the colour, a deep black, and the way it feels on his skin like he’s wearing nothing at all.
Harry reacts fast, snapping his fingers, and the leash wraps itself around Draco’s cock, squeezing the base and preventing the orgasm with another burst of pain. Draco’s eyes glaze over as he is cheated out of his climax and he cries out in disappointment. His body goes rigid, causing the humbler to inflict more pain, and he collapses into himself, frustrated tears leaking into the dark wood of the steps.
“Where are we, Professor?” he asks, although he knows the answer, somehow. But somehow he doesn’t. This place is confusing, and at the same time, it’s not.
Harry takes the lead and makes the first step and Draco follows in perfect synch. The room, the people, even the music around him fades into the background. His eyes are locked with Harry’s, emerald glinting bright in the fairy lights. As usual, they don’t need words between them. Draco knows everything Harry says with the loving twinkle, his soft smile, the world around them meaningless in the light of their love.
There’s a conflict brewing in his mind. Malfoy seems to know some answers, and he’s weak. Even if Harry doesn’t attack him immediately, he has no doubt he could react fast and strong enough to get the upper hand. But sitting down and listening would mean giving Malfoy what he wants, and Harry’s never been less inclined to comply. In the end his curiosity wins, and it helps that he clearly has all the advantages of the situation.
For a split second Draco sees all of his past mistakes floating before his eyes, paralysing him as his breathe swooshes out of him, leaving him empty, speechless, unable to see past them. Just as he thinks he will pass out, embarrass himself in front of all these people, a slight chuckle dissolves all the dark thoughts and just like that, everything is easy.
When he was fresh out of school, he’d been tempted to just leave it all behind and start a new life somewhere people didn’t know about Harry Potter and how he saved Britain from the maddest Wizard of all times.
Despite the Prophet and the people at the hospital, those who matter have long since forgiven him for what he did or didn’t do. He talked to Harry, naturally, and they both apologised for being stupid, pigheaded gits. They both forgave themselves for what they did to each other. For Sectumsempra and stomping on noses. For snitching on Hagrid’s dragon and enjoying forced transfigurations into animals, and many more.
Harry looks up at Dumbledore again, and again he sees the other one, the figure in its dark cloak. He understands where all ways lead to, in the end, no matter how long or short the distance. The knowledge weighs heavy on his mind, and this time, it sticks with him. It’s another decision he has to make, too young to have to do it, but forced to anyway.
Malfoy’s face is relaxed, a ray of light hitting his face just right (how does he do it?), so his skin looks like it glows from within, white and pale and perfect. Harry swallows the lump that suddenly clogs his throat and dumps the rest of the rejects into Malfoys open hand. He watches avidly as Malfoy eats one after another in rapid succession, like once he has started, he can’t stop. Soon his hand is empty and when he opens his eyes, he looks almost disappointed that there isn’t more. He suddenly becomes aware of Harry staring at him.  He’s blushing - and Harry has never seen that before. Not like this. He’s used to Malfoy getting red in the face in anger and outrage, ugly splotches on his cheeks, but this is different. It’s eerily soft, but it suits him. It’s like Malfoy is now: a bit subdued, not obtrusive and fighting for attention.
This is like the nastiest chapter ever. I've started it a few times, because I wasn't going anywhere and then I even resorted to asking Wikipedia what TF 'Temptation' actually is. It helped a bit and this came out of it. I'm not satisfied, but maybe you are.
“Alright. Talk,” Harry says, barely suppressing the hostility in his voice. He lifts an eyebrow, a gesture that is strange and familiar at the same time. He didn’t use to do it before, but it feels natural to do it now. He’s sitting a foot away, close enough to see even more.
Draco Malfoy sits there, nursing a tumbler of amber liquid on his own. He looks a little lost without his friends, but Harry has seen Blaise sitting with a group of Ravenclaws, and Pansy and Seamus aren’t even here today. Millicent and Hanna sit with Neville and Luna and some other students from different houses. If anything was achieved after the war, it’s house unity.
Ron let out a long groan, but he smiled, “I’m glad you’re happy, you won’t be my brother in law but your still my brother, and strangely Draco is my sort of brother in law.” This comment gained him a pillow to his face, “hey!! I’m not wrong!”
He was pacing in front of the entrance to the grand hall. He wasn’t quite sure why though. There were two possible reasons for why he was doing this, one of them was that he was waiting for Potter and his entourage to arrive so they could all go in together, or he was building up courage to go in and sit with them.
Waiting on Platform ¾ felt strange, Draco looked around him at the families, first years looking scared to leave there parents, older students finding their friends and stepping onto the Hogwarts Express like it was the most natural things to do.
When it came to going to bed Draco started to walk to the exit and make his way to the Slytherin  common room when Ron grabbed his arm, “where you off to?”
Uni has been an absolute ball-ache but is finished for the summer so hopefully more chapter updates!!
All of a sudden the great hall broke into applause with a chorus of whoops and cheers and a couple of ‘Finally!’s thrown in. the two of them stood there bemused and completely in shock, not only because of the positive reaction they had got but also because they had spotted money being exchanged between students, and also some professors.
He actually apologised to Hermione when they walked to the great hall for food, “Hermione” he put a hand on her shoulder to stall her, “I need to apologise for all the times I called you a” he swallowed the word tasting horrible in his mouth, “a mud…..mudblood”.
Once they reached the main part of Hogsmead, Ron and Hermione went towards Madam Pudiffoots for a bit of ‘coupley time’ as Ginny called it. Ginny herself went to join her classmates at the The Three Broomsticks. This left Draco and Harry alone with a difficult decision….
He just smiled at her, gave her a peck on the forehead, nodded to Ron who was sprawled on the couch in front on the fire and went up to his room.
There was a pause before Potter slowly nodded his head. Malfoy chuckled, if his father could see him now.
When the lesson was over it was break so while the trio invited him to come with them to wherever they were going, Draco said he needed to go to the library to get a book and promised to see them in Charms, when in actual fact he just needed a break.
Fourth year had been the Triwizard tournament and had been filled with multiple different whispers, some caused by Rita Skeeter!
This broke them out of there trance. Because out of everyone in the room, that had sounded like Ginny.
Ron let out a long groan, but he smiled, “I’m glad you’re happy, you won’t be my brother in law but your still my brother, and strangely Draco is my sort of brother in law.” This comment gained him a pillow to his face, “hey!! I’m not wrong!”
Draco and Ginny shared a small smile between them, I silent agreement. Draco had to smile to himself as well. A year ago he would never have imagined being friends with Ron, Hermione and Ginny. He definitely never would have imagined he would be dating the famous Harry Potter, even though I small part of him back then had wished it could happen.
Both Harry and Draco put on faces of pure innocence, “So what?” Draco asked, finding full enjoyment out of this whole experience.
“Be honest, did you invite me to sit with you so you wouldn’t have to be a third wheel to those two?”
“I got lost” this came out more as a question than a statement, he knew Hermione knew when he was lying.
“I don’t know what we are Draco, but I do two things, one that I really really like you too, and two that you are very drunk, I would kiss you very passionately but I would feel like I was taking advantage of you. But know this Draco Malfoy, I, Harry Potter, like you very much and would like to carry on this conversation when you aren’t brimming with fire whisky.”
It was about midnight when Malfoy got back to his common room. He led on his bed and pondered what the hell had just happened.
“Are you having an ‘affair’ with Malfoy?” she put air quotes around the word affair as they were no longer together.
Harry’s smile grew, where the Harry from last night, this person was all smiles, no hint at what Malfoy had seen. He decided to push this to the back of his mind and focus on the present, if Harry wanted to talk about it he would.
Draco sent him a wide smile, “Just teasing, I was genuinely touched by it, didn’t know who to thank, so thank you.”
Draco looked at Harry, who looked at him back, answering for the both of them replied “sure why not I could do with a drink”.
Harry face fell a bit, “I went searching for you on the train, wanted to offer the olive branch, clean slate and all that. I found you asleep, you looked scared but I didn’t want to startle you, I left them in front of you for when you woke up.”
They carried on this back and forth for the rest of breakfast, completely forgetting about Hermione and Ron who sat and watched the entire thing at first confused and then sending each other a knowing look.
Hermione just sighed and walked away. Ron waited a bit longer and looked from Harry to Draco and back again, raised an eye brow, smiled and nodded and went to follow his girlfriend. Draco would later say that that was the moment he knew he had got Weasley’s approval.
When the castle eventually came into view it looked the same as it always had, they must have decided to build it exactly the same as it had been before, the turrets rising into the twilight sky and castle windows all lit up with a yellow glow from the candles inside. It was the same old Hogwarts as it had always been. If Draco looked close enough he could see the boats the first years were on slowly moving towards the castle.
While they were packing there things away Potter asked Draco what subjects he was taking and when it turned out they were doing the same subjects he asked Malfoy a question that set everything else that year into action;
Ron blushed and Draco walked away, gave Harry a quick kiss and left the room simply saying “dibs on the shower next.”
That last question was the confusing, since when did Draco stair at Potter’s arse? And why did he think it was good? This was all getting very ridiculous.
When he was walking towards the classroom he heard talking coming towards him and saw that it was Potter and his friends, hoping they hadn’t spotted him he quickly entered the classroom. Once in the classroom Draco found the desk that was right at the back of the classroom as far away from everyone as he could be.
Ron blushed and Draco walked away, gave Harry a quick kiss and left the room simply saying “dibs on the shower next.”
When it turned out Malfoys idea to make them stare more was just to grab Harrys hand under the table, he was a bit disappointed. It did as intended though, Hermione and Ron where sat at just the right angle so they could see Harry and Draco hands, and they were sat with their mouths hanging open.
Malfoy burst out laughing, partly at the look on Harry’s face, he looked adorably confused, and how far Harry was from the truth of what was actually happening.
There was no point lying to Ginny, she knew him better than most people. So he told her about what Malfoy and him had been doing throughout the day, he even added the part about him possibly liking Malfoy, it was Ginny, she’d have guessed eventually.
While at the same time Harry looked scarred, hugged a pillow to himself and whispering “I’ve never been more scarred”
The time had come they chose to it around lunchtime when most students would be walking around the castle, the bigger the audience the quicker the news would spread, even though it was Hogwarts and news spread ridiculously fast.
“I don’t think they want it plastered on the front of every magazine and everyone coming up with theories about why.”
“Starving!” Harry lead the way through the big doors and walked to where Hermione and Ron where sat.
“May or may not have used a certain map that’s shows me were people are” Potter gave him a shy smile as an apology.
He all of a sudden had the urge to kiss the other boy. Malfoy was stood in front of him, not the boy from first year with the slicked back hair, but the man who had survived the battle of Hogwarts, and Harry wanted to kiss that man, he was falling for that man.
They stood hugging each other for a few minutes when they were suddenly both enveloped in a wash of mint and soggy arms encapsulated them both, “Why are we hugging and why wasn’t I invited, also this feels like a dream I had one night.”
“MALFOY!” Now Harry was annoyed. Was he in trouble? Why were they going to go to Madam Malkins? Why wasn’t Malfoy giving him a clue? “Am I in trouble?”
“It’s what school does to you mate” this had Weasley receive evils from Granger that dissipated when he kissed her cheek.
The Slytherin common room was a hubbub of activity, old friends catching up, first years standing around looking lost and some slightly homesick already.
Draco ignored all this and walked straight to the eighth year’s bedroom, which was slightly large for only one person. None of the Slytherins had come back. He unpacked his things and sat on his bed, it was going to be a long night till lessons tomorrow.
“Everything.” He moved his head so it was resting in the crook of Malfoy’s neck, it felt right, he felt like he in the place he was mean to be.
They carried on this back and forth for the rest of breakfast, completely forgetting about Hermione and Ron who sat and watched the entire thing at first confused and then sending each other a knowing look.
He walked out of the bathroom and saw Harry and Ron hugging, he smiled, he had never had close friends, he’d had what he now called brown nosing followers, but he had never had the kind of friendship the golden trio where famous for having, and now he was part of it, they had made him feel welcomed and loved.
“Do you remember when we agreed Hermione and Ron were oblivious to their feelings for each other? You’re worse.”
“Where are you going?!?” Draco was hoping to ask this is in a calm voice but had failed and shouted it at Potter.
“Fair enough. So they finally admitted they like each other! Even I noticed, third year actually, and Grangers called the wisest witch of her age?” This comment seemed to have tickeld Potter who was laughing to himself.  Draco was happy for the two of them, if he was honest Granger wasn’t that bad to look at and she was one of, if not the, smartest people in their year. Draco had even noticed that Weasley wasn’t too bad either.
”SHIT!” thankfully no one was near him to see how shaken he was. He ran his hand through his hair, he kept having similar dreams ever since the battle, same ending different place from Hogwarts, to the Manor, to Diagon alley etc.
“With my hands Potter how else would I carry it, my feet?” and to prove his point he placed it on the floor and proceeded to lift it, almost falling backwards off the bench.
His peaceful night meant he had overslept which meant he had to check his timetable, his first lesson was transfiguration,
The Sorting Hat said its poem, a poem of remembrance for those who fought in the war, how all houses were now united and how everyone need to support each other and get rid of old prejudices and feuds. There was a mixture of clapping and tears when it finished.
Harry got off the bed and pulled him into a hug and held him tight, his heart was beating fast, and not from what had happened with Draco though that had caused it to beat incredibly fast, but from what felt like relief. He knew Ron would accept him and be happy for him but there had still been a small bit of worry, which he could only assume was natural, but to hear Ron say that he was his brother and that he accepted him no matter what, that had caused him to have a sudden rush of emotions, “I love you so much Ron”.
For the rest of the day whenever one of them caught Hermione, or Ron, or both looking at them they would do something coupley, either hold the other ones hand, place their head of the others shoulder or even hug the other one. They were too caught up in their game not to notice their students catching onto the way they were behaving, it was then that the rumours of the Draco and Harry “affair” started to spread.
“Off course I did, I’m the youngest out of a group of boys, I know how to manipulate situations” she sent him a proud smile, then turned to Draco, “look after him won’t you? He’s not very good at it, he might have survived the war but it was mostly luck.”
Harry found himself being pulled into a hug he felt Malfoys arms tighten around and he let himself e held.
He sat up straighter, and looked around him. The head movement made his stomach churn. Closing his eyes and holding the bridge of his nose did help, then he took a deep breath and thought back to what happened.
Draco must have gone into auto pilot because before he knew it he was almost back at his common room.
When they stopped, to their surprise, people started to cheer, and some even handed each other money. Ginny was stood there smiling at them and Harry realised something, she had planned this from the start.
The golden trio were being overly friendly and what was up with Potter? The guy who had been the bane of his life for the entirety of his time at Hogwarts was trying to be his best friend?
He must have been lost in his thoughts as he didn’t notice Ginny sit next to him. Even though they’d split they still classed each other as one of their close friends.
While they walked to the party later that day, after sitting through lessons not really paying attention and smiling at anyone who congratulated them for finally getting together, but everytime someone said he would flinch, where they actually a couple? Yes they had kissed but they hadn’t had a chance to talk about it! Was the party a good idea? Should he drink?
One possible reason why this was his problem was that he wasn’t sure if they were in the hall yet, he hadn’t checked yet.
His dilemma was the blonde Slytherin that was currently sprawled across his bed and drooling on his pillow.  For the last couple of minutes he had been having an exchange with the blonde consisting of him whispering “Draco” and gaining the response *snore*.
He could have stayed in Malfoys arms forever, but he knew he would have to move at some point. He stood there feeling Malfoy breathing. He was the first to let go and he looked up at the other boy, he could have sworn Malfoy looked disappointed to be no longer holding him.
He stopped pacing, turned on the spot and looked towards the reason for his problem. Harry was walking towards with his signature smile on his face, where was Granger and Weasley?
i wasnt sure if people knew i had started the prequel so to make sure im going to add it onto this as well :)
He stopped pacing, turned on the spot and looked towards the reason for his problem. Harry was walking towards with his signature smile on his face, where was Granger and Weasley?
“Want to stay here hugging?” he wasn’t going to push the other to boy to answer, he’d talk when he wanted to.
After keeping his eyes closed for a few minutes he opened them again, blinked, then blinked again. Then it hit him, why where the bed sheets red?
Once they’d left the great hall, the couple went off on their own, possible to the Gryffindor common room but who knows.
Draco shook the water out of his hair and clambered off Harry, “we have one we just happen to share it with you.” He sent Ron his most innocent smile.
Draco and Ginny shared a small smile between them, I silent agreement. Draco had to smile to himself as well. A year ago he would never have imagined being friends with Ron, Hermione and Ginny. He definitely never would have imagined he would be dating the famous Harry Potter, even though I small part of him back then had wished it could happen.
This entire scenario was ridiculous, he had followed Potter without thinking and now he was thinking about Potter’s arse, what was happening?
When it was time for the lesson to end, neither of them wanted to let go of the other, but they were never go admit this, so they reluctantly let go. They walked out of the classroom together and came face to face with Hermione and Ron.
“I don’t think they want it plastered on the front of every magazine and everyone coming up with theories about why.”
Harry face fell a bit, “I went searching for you on the train, wanted to offer the olive branch, clean slate and all that. I found you asleep, you looked scared but I didn’t want to startle you, I left them in front of you for when you woke up.”
His dilemma was the blonde Slytherin that was currently sprawled across his bed and drooling on his pillow.  For the last couple of minutes he had been having an exchange with the blonde consisting of him whispering “Draco” and gaining the response *snore*.
Before Draco could defend himself, a Malfoy never got drunk, they were always composed and dignified, Ginny walked past “He’s drunk the bottle.”
Ginny face betrayed her, she was obviously trying to be caring but she burst out laughing instead, “Yesh you should Harry. The air might do him shome good”
The entire walk from the dungeon Harry had wanted to turn around and check that Malfoy was still following him, but the distinct sound Malfoys shoes made where enough to make him keep on looking forward. If only he could think of a destination for where he was going.
He turned his head to the nightstand and saw that someone had left a glass of water and a note, he smiled, he knew exactly who it was from.
Harry had to laugh at this remembering the time Draco drank too much fire whisky, “you were so drunk.”
This gained another “Hey!” from the topic of this interaction and a “we already are friends, I wouldn’t hand him over to someone who wasn’t.”
Fifth year had been the worst, most people believing him to be a liar, at least he had been proven to be right about that one.
He couldn’t remember how he had ended up in the dungeon or why, but once he had seen Malfoy he knew he wanted wherever he was going to be with the blonde slytherin.
Before Draco could defend himself, a Malfoy never got drunk, they were always composed and dignified, Ginny walked past “He’s drunk the bottle.”
The Slytherin common room was a hubbub of activity, old friends catching up, first years standing around looking lost and some slightly homesick already.
The rest of the lesson went by silently, McGonagall being the teacher she was no one would dare talk while she was, out of both resect and fear.
The only choice Harry had was to follow. He kept going through his brain for things he could have done wrong and nothing came to mind.
This was moment everything changed. He moved through the crowd of people towards Draco. When he got there he grabbed Draco shoulders, pulled him towards him and kissed him there and then, if the hug had felt right, this felt like fate.
There was a pause before Potter slowly nodded his head. Malfoy chuckled, if his father could see him now.
Why did Ron and Hermione keep looking over at him and Draco? He’d noticed it at soon as potions had started. Because they were only a small class, the pupils had been sat with each pair having their own table. Ron and Hermione taking the table to the right of Harry and Draco.
Harry blushed, looking at he well and truly shocked “well yes but still, this isn’t a conversation ex’s usually have”.
He rolled over in his bed, what was going on? He spent years hating Potter and now he wanted to kiss him and hold him and make him feel safe.
Ron just rolled his eyes and went back to eating. Hermione was still looking at her friend concerned, apparently Draco wasn’t the only one concerned about Harry’s mood.
He sat at the foot of his bed holding a bacon butty on his lap and gazing at the other boy. He then shuffled further up the bed, being cautious to not disturb sleeping beauty, he placed the food on his night stand and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead and stood to leave.
“Where are you going?!?” the tone of Malfoy’s voice startled Harry, he really wished he had an answer.
He rested his head on the table and took a couple of deep breaths, when he looked up he noticed a box of cauldron cakes on the table in front of him and next to it a note, “
What they  couldn’t see however where the tingles that were shooting up Harry’s arm to and making his heart beat faster, he was also struggling to breathe, all of this caused by Draco holding his hand, this had never happened with Ginny.
"I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT ME! IF YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH ME WHY NOT TELL ME AND NOT EVERYONE THAT WILL LISTEN!"
The week previously had flown by, Harry and Draco had spent as much time as they could together, while also hanging around with Ron, Hermione and Ginny. Draco had also started to notice that more people were saying hello to him on the corridor, when he had brought this up Ron told him that it was just the effect of being friends with Harry. Hermione and Ginny backed him up on this while Harry just blushed.
He carried on going but harry just watched him, it was the cutest drunk ramble he had seen, Ron’s were usually incoherent except for the word Hermione, he was sure Hermione got more intelligent when she drank who can say discombobulate when drunk? But with Draco he just looked more human, more animated, than the persona he showed, and Harry knew exactly how to shut him up.
Draco ignored all this and walked straight to the eighth year’s bedroom, which was slightly large for only one person. None of the Slytherins had come back. He unpacked his things and sat on his bed, it was going to be a long night till lessons tomorrow.
Hagrid was waiting on the platform like he was every year previous, calling all the first years to follow and waving at the older pupils, he even managed to give Draco a small smile. The older pupils all went to the carriages, all of the ones who had helped fight in the battle of Hogwarts now seeing what pulled the carriages.
Harry just continued to gawp at her. She waved her hand in front of him, clicked her fingers, then gave up and just waited for him to emerge from his current state of confusion.
When the door had shoot Draco just smiled towards “Yeah I did, and I wish you had” he took a bite out of his breakfast and gave a small sigh “it’s not like I haven’t liked you since we met”.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug, kissing him on the forehead, Draco had a feeling he was trying to kiss the nightmares away.
While they walked to the party later that day, after sitting through lessons not really paying attention and smiling at anyone who congratulated them for finally getting together, but everytime someone said he would flinch, where they actually a couple? Yes they had kissed but they hadn’t had a chance to talk about it! Was the party a good idea? Should he drink?
Draco stepped out of the shower still recovering from what had happened, if Ron hadn’t walked in he wasn’t sure how far they would have gone, the shower had helped calm him.
“I don’t know”, Potter looked up at him defeated, he stared into Draco’s eyes and held them, Draco felt the frustration seeping out of him.
As no one would want to sit with him Draco decided to walk, it wasn’t far to the castle and it wasn’t too cold.
Draco had no idea why he did what he did next, he grabbed Potter and pulled him into a hug and held him. Draco Malfoy was hugging Harry Potter.
“I’ll take that as a yes.” He then got off his stool and wrote their names down on the list at the front. They spent the rest of the lesson making a Draught of peace. Potter knew that Malfoy was one of the better potions students and just did as Malfoy instructed him.
Hermione just sighed and walked away. Ron waited a bit longer and looked from Harry to Draco and back again, raised an eye brow, smiled and nodded and went to follow his girlfriend. Draco would later say that that was the moment he knew he had got Weasley’s approval.
Hermione just gave him a small smile and pulled him into a hug, it felt almost like a mum hug, in his ear she whispered “and I apologise for punching you in the face”.
The entire walk from the dungeon Harry had wanted to turn around and check that Malfoy was still following him, but the distinct sound Malfoys shoes made where enough to make him keep on looking forward. If only he could think of a destination for where he was going.
After a couple of minutes they pulled away from each other. They stood there both breathing deeply and looking into the others eyes, both with big grins.
“It’s true, he is incredibly scary when he first wakes up the hair everywhere and the glasses missing, he looks like a mermaid from the black lake.” Ron said with an evil grin.
He spent the rest of the day hiding out in the library. One thing about being a known ex-death eater, people tended to stay away from you.
Slughorn was thrilled to see his favourite chosen one back in his classroom so they were forced to sit at the table nearest the front. The lesson consisted of a quick cover of what the year was going to involve and also choosing your partner for the rest of the year.
“Everything.” Potter moved his head so his forehead was pressed into the crook of Malfoys neck, he seemed to fit against Malfoy perfectly.
That night harry was sat in the common room smiling about what had happened throughout the day, who knew spending a day hugging and being coupley with Malfoy would be so much fun!! He was aware of all the stares that they were getting but he didn’t mind, he’d spent his life being stared at hearing the whispers;
Harry woke up the next morning with a sore neck, in the arm chair he had sat down in the night before and a blanket on him. He recognised it as Hermione’s, she always looked after him.
“Want to stay here hugging?” he wasn’t going to push the other to boy to answer, he’d talk when he wanted to.
“Thanks, Ron I really do need it.” Draco took the glass, downed it and as Ron was telling him to take it easy he grabbed the bottle.
Hogsmead weekends use to be just like anyother weekend for Draco. He would go round with Crabbe and Goyle scowling at the younger students and turning his nose up at the people who lived there, but this weekend it was different. If someone had told Draco that he would one day be going to Hogsmead on the arm of the boy who lived while discussing potions with Hermione he would have laughed, said something degrading about muggleborns, while also wishing he was on the arm of Potter, but here he was and he had never been happier. The weather was becoming colder, autumn was definitely making its presence known, so they were all wrapped in scalves and thick coats and Draco was using it as an excuse to snuggle into Harry as much as he could.
His sight was immediately caught by Draco Malfoy, huddled under a desk, crying. It was the most pathetic display he had ever seen and piqued his interest all the same.
He takes Harry’s hand, restless now that his nature is revealed, and takes them down the path to the paddock near the woods. When he was young, his mother bred Abraxans and Draco watched them running around, strong and free and beautiful.
As soon as Draco has himself under control again, Harry resumes to stroke him, light touches that tickle, and Draco tries hard not to squirm too much, he really does, but to no avail. A broken moan erupts from his throat as the pain intensifies and he shakes with the effort to stay still.
In stark contrast, she’s wearing the least aggressive clothes he has ever seen on a person. Her hair falls openly over her shoulders, mousy brown and a little bleak, complimenting her heart-shaped face. Her spaghetti strap dress has a pattern of little cherries and birds, more suited for a teenager than a grown woman, but it suits her. She would look completely out of place in her shop if it wasn’t for the predatory glint in her eyes and her domineering personality.
The internet says the Kilimanjaro is one of the easiest mountains to climb. It seems reasonable that Harry would try his hand on it, even if the whole thing of actually climbing a mountain just to have sex is unreasonable af.
Malfoy tries to get up, scrambles to get up, but there’s no way to escape, not with his extensive injuries and a very agile, very non-injured Harry ready to hunt him down.
The first thing he sees grinds his mind to halt, leaving him speechless. It’s a delicate ankle, wrapped in equally delicate black lace. It’s translucent, just hinting on the stocking, much more revealing than covering. Alabaster white skin shimmers through, and Harry unconsciously licks his lips at the sight. Draco wears black high heels with an ankle strap, and they make his feet look so elegant, you wouldn’t know that he’s usually a man with manly feet.
His tongue plunders Draco’s mouth, leaving no room for anything else in his lovers mind. He doesn’t tangle his tongue with the other but strokes and rubs, sucking the fresh taste of toothpaste away and replacing it with their mingled essence, something uniquely Harry and uniquely Draco. He withdraws, getting a few puffs of breath in before he attacks again, sucking the full lower lip between his teeth, sometimes biting it just short of drawing blood, then licking at it soothingly.
Draco relaxes slightly now that he can rest his weight on more than just his knees, his firm ass resting on his heels, his shoulders not as tense as before, and it is the moment when he really lets go and settles into the position that Harry snaps his fingers and the plug picks up its speed and intensity. Draco yelps in an undignified manner and begins to squirm, losing his pose but he knows he’s not allowed to move much and it’s what Harry has waited for. He never plays fair and his lover doesn’t expect him to.
They spent another weekend in Hogsmeade after Malfoy told him between classes that he needs something from Tomes and Scrolls. Harry’s never been inside the shop despite Hermione frequently trying to make him go with her, but he’s not surprised when the interior is dark and musty and full of books. It seems typical for Wizarding stores to be stuffed full to the point of overflow, like Ollivander’s or George’s shop. The books are stacked high under the ceiling, inside of shelves, on tables, chairs and every other available surface. It smells old, no thanks to the blocked up windows (more books). Malfoy slowly weaves through the rows, careful not to trip over tomes that look ancient. There is a faint whisper in the air and Harry isn’t sure if it’s a Wireless somewhere or the books themselves, trying to lure him in. His skin crawls and he tries to rub his arms sneakily. He’s sure he’s offending someone, being on edge in this shop. It takes several minutes, then Malfoy stands beside him, holding a brown parcel as far away as he can without dropping it. He looks unhappy and hurries Harry out and into the harsh cold of the Scottish winter. He’s never been so glad to feel the sun on his face, not even after escaping from Gringotts on the back of a dragon. Malfoy heaves a relieved sigh, before he shakes himself like an animal. His blond hair flops around, the light catching and setting it aglow. It looks almost ethereal and Harry is confused why, for Merlin’s sake, he even notices.
“Hello Mother”, he greets her, his hands buried in his cloak. He feels guilty for neglecting her for so long, but he can’t stand to be here. The Manor weighs heavily on his shoulders, guilt and shame mixed with the pain of his memories. Wherever his mother is, Draco hopes she can forgive him.
He’s fitted with a cock cage and his collar, completely naked while Harry carefully dresses in black trousers, a simple black jumper, and dragonhide boots before he pulls on his crimson Auror robes.
Draco whines pathetically at the stimulation, but he keeps still like he’s supposed to. Harry has his Dragon tamed very well.
This time Draco doesn’t hesitate at all, practically flying from his seat to kneel between Harry’s legs. Sure hands open his fly and it’s so good to be finally free of the confines of the trousers. Harry leans back in his seat. There are mountains on the stage again and the feather bloke is back, but it’s all just background noise to him.
He sees Draco blush as they step into the building, probably embarrassed by the mistake, but Harry doesn’t blame the bloke. Draco looks ethereal in the dress, his body and features just feminine enough that he could be confused for a woman. His long hair just plays into the illusion.
Harry puts the parcel down on an unused sideboard and settles in his favourite armchair. A fresh glass of firewhisky tells him Kreacher is aware he’s home but decided not to disturb him. The Elf knows their traditions and he knows not to show himself for the next forty-eight hours.
“Don’t worry, babe, I’ll just call that Indian restaurant you like and get some Chicken Korma and Naan for us”, Harry says and disappears into the den.
“I’m sure he is, but you might have noticed that Longbottom and I aren’t on the best of terms. You know, with me bullying him and mocking his parents and all.”
Actually I'm very grateful he is such a good partner, taking an interest in my writing, even if he doesn't care for all that gay stuff :)
Despite the obvious grossness I don’t think you should tell someone your dick is itching. Sounds mighty unsanitary to me.”
He collects a box of chocolate frogs and sugar quills, stopping shortly at the liquorice wands before he puts it all on the cash desk so the clerk can ring it up. She’s looked at them in anger when they entered the shop, but now she smiles, adding a small box of heart-shaped nougats.
As the smoke clears from his eyes, he sees the empty platform stretching endlessly before him. The red locomotive glistens in the sun, ready to move anywhere he wants. He’s never been in the front before, but this is a new adventure and he’s ready for a new experience. As he nears the first carriage, he sees a lone figure standing there, waiting for him.
They should have at least the weekends to themselves, but Draco’s own work schedule cuts away their precious time together. St. Mungo’s is always hectic and always in need of competent Healers. The fourth floor is busy at all times of the day, treating hexes, curses and spells that have gone wrong. It’s visited by Aurors much too frequently for Draco’s comfort but he is glad to never have met Harry during his shift.
The content of the box is quite unspectacular. Some Muggle-photographs, a child’s ring with a big fake ruby, a mothy blanket, formerly a crass violet but now turned a soft lilac. An equally old stuffed lion and, curiously, a stuffed snake, entwined with the lion.
They stayed for dinner, too weak to Apparate just then, and as they walked the school, they stopped to chat with some of the portraits. While Snape only huffed in disgust at seeing them before he vanished and refused to come back, Dumbledore clapped his hands in delight, chuckling and winking at Harry. He’d never been so embarrassed in his life, and he still wonders how Dumbledore could even know what they did.
Malfoy pleads with him the whole time, begs him to stop, to reconsider, tells him fantastic stories of sentient houses and medieval serial killers, but it’s all just background music for Harry’s creativity. He’s not a predator anymore, he’s an artist with an exquisite canvas. He’s just started but he already can’t take his eyes off the ethereal beauty that he creates with skilled cuts.
“They’re ours. Yours and mine. Like,“ he pauses, unsure if he should continue. Harry urges him on with an impatient wave of his hand. “Like marriage rings, alright?”
“No, the house won’t let me eat. Water’s allowed, thank Merlin, but it punishes me for doing something not to its liking. And it would really like for me to not eat.”
When he wants for Draco to take notice of him, Harry knows exactly how to get his attention. He just needs to dress nice, maybe arrange for a candle light dinner or a nice walk on the beach.
His eyes zero in on the simple silver ring on Malfoys right thumb. There is an echo in his head, another voice.
People said he got more reckless after everything had ended, but Harry liked to think of himself as more trusting, which was why he opened the door without precaution. Nothing at Hogwarts could hurt him now.
The endorphin rush subsides as fast as it came, followed by the crushing realisation of what Harry has done. He just used an Unforgivable on Draco Malfoy, who is admittedly his nemesis, but who’s also injured and weak and not even a hint of danger.
He’s none the wiser on Thursday, when he goes looking for Malfoy in the dungeons, to ask him when they want to meet on Saturday. He hears Malfoy’s voice from the potion’s cabinet, but it isn’t the only one. There is also a female voice, but it’s not Pansy and Harry’s curiosity instantly goes into overdrive. What are they doing here, at this time, late on Thursday evening? Malfoy should have been in the library, but when Harry went there, there was no one but Madam Pince and he was forced to actually look for him. Something doesn’t sit right with Harry, but he hasn’t used his cloak in forever and it’s currently in his dorm. Harry decides to make as little sound as possible and goes to investigate.
They exchanged the same words over and over again before Draco calmed down enough to finally fall asleep again.
Ron waffles on and on about something or other, but Harry barely listens. They are mirroring each other: Hermione lies asleep in Ron’s lap, while Draco snuggles shamelessly into Harry’s belly. They fell asleep at about the same time, five minutes into the evening, and didn’t even finish their tumblers of Ogden’s finest, leaving Ron and Harry to their own devices.
Spikes the size of a small Abraxan drum through his skull, but Draco knows he can’t bail on this. Despite Harry’s reluctance to go to those happenings, his husband is a dutiful clerk to the Ministry and wouldn’t miss a single minute.
He arrives late at the Manor, but there is still a bit of light, painting the sky an intriguing orange and pink, and Draco takes a moment to appreciate nature. He knows that Veelas supposedly are the most alluring things in existence, but he could never see himself as this ethereal beauty. He knows his faults and errors better than anyone and it marrs this perfect picture. Looks can be deceiving, he’s learned that the hard way, and Draco never made that particular mistake again.
It hadn’t always been like this. This casual acceptance of their living arrangements, of his relationship, of Draco’s creature.
Also, I consulted three different websites for the language of flowers and they all had different meanings for the same type of flower, it was exhausting. So please, if you're well versed with colours and flowers and what it all means, don't be mad at me if they mean something different for you. I eventually settled for one page and that's what my flowers mean.
As it is, he is only here to pick up his order. Calliope was very helpful with deciding what to get this year and Harry looks forward to give it a go.
It's not Lucius Malfoy, but the marginally lesser of two evils, his son. Who is also an adult, he notices.
Pain spikes through Draco’s skull, an agony he has never known before. It feels like his brain is simultaneously pierced by an ice pick and ripped apart by harsh claws, while somebody uses a blunt knife to dissect it.
He knows how much Harry longs for a connection to his parents. Except for an album full of pictures that Hagrid collected more than a couple of decades ago, there is nothing he owns of them, nothing to remember them by. Until Hermione and Draco went out to collect the hopefully best birthday present ever.
Obediently his dragon lifts his eyes, settling them on Harry’s lips. He isn’t allowed to make eye-contact and it isn’t necessary. It doesn’t take long before he fixates on the humbler with a puzzled expression. So he hasn’t got a clue, which suits Harry just fine.
“Draco,” he murmurs, before he leans down and captures the soft lips in a delicate kiss. It’s as much a part of their sessions as the collar or any other toy they use. It’s a reassurance for their love, a promise that no matter what is said and done, as soon as the session ends they are Harry and Draco again, devoted to each other.
Apologies to my readers, but again it isn't my fault it took so long to update. We can always blame the fiance (since he isn't here to defend himself), because he took so long to look at the next chapter. To make it up to you, he finished four entire chapters that I will post right away for you. All remaining mistakes are also his fault, if you want to complain ;)
After that, they continue to sit in silence. The day passes by, but neither of them realises just how much time passes.
Harry lets his left hand wander down to Draco’s cock, tenting the dress obscenely. It’s hot and damp under his palm, the dress likely ruined, but Draco presses into his touch immediately and despite their audience.
He buries his hands in Draco’s hair, not demanding but there, and a definite reminder to not play too long but get to business. Blowjobs are always spectacular to watch, but today is special. From this angle, Harry has the best view of his birthday present. The small breasts look ripe and swollen framed by the dress. They jiggle enticingly with every movement. It sets him on edge more than it should, but that’s exactly the fantasy he’s envisioned for years.
“That’s nice,” Harry says and finally gathers enough strength to move on. He doesn’t feel brave, doesn’t feel like a hero, and he thinks again of lambs and slaughter. Multiple hands hold him: Draco has slipped his hand into Harry’s left, his father has his hand on his left shoulder. Sirius holds tight onto the right one.
It’s his insecurity that tells him he’s making a big mistake, that Harry would never appreciate a gift like this. The personal belongings of his parents will only be hurtful, never something he’ll be glad about. It’s causing Draco a headache, pondering about these things, but he has done it all now and he won’t back out. He isn’t a coward anymore.
“You have been disobedient. You were a raunchy dragon, weren’t you? You know not to move when you kneel by my side but you did. I have to say, you’ve been disobedient for some days now, mouthing off, not doing what I ask of you. There is a parcel right on the sideboard. I want you to bring it here. You will crawl there, so you can practice some more how an obedient slut behaves, but you may stand up before giving it to me.”
“Draco,” he finally says, his voice different than before, lower and more commanding. It gets Draco’s attention every time, and Harry delights in the way his husband suddenly sits straighter in anticipation.
As they slowly come to an end, Draco becomes aware of his surroundings once more. He sees the bright and colourful bouquets of roses everywhere and people dressed in their best robes. Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister of Magic, smiles at him as Draco executes the last dance-steps, carried by the soft music of the string quartet and Harry’s sure lead. As the music slowly fades away, he watches Molly Weasley dab the tears away with a pristine white handkerchief, sees Hermione do the same. Pansy and Blaise grin like idiots and Draco is fairly sure they mirror his own expression.
He knows he can cheer Draco up with his ridiculously orange and yellow sweater Dobby sent him for Christmas a few years ago. The bright red pompoms are ridiculous but they can crack a smile faster than any lame joke Harry could make. Or his emerald green vest, combined with the grey dress shirt with the burgundy hem will make Draco randy as fuck, barely able to hold himself back as long as they are in proper company.
It’s the longest speech Harry has ever heard from Malfoy and the only time that there is no trace of insult. It’s just an account of what happened and why, no malice or ill-intent. It makes asking questions easier.
“De Rais, he liked kids. He would take them from their families, make them pliable with food and alcohol, and then string them up, rip off their clothes and show them how he got off on their helplessness. Then he or one of his accomplices would kill them. He was a monster. And he liked boys best. Those with elegant hands and feet, graceful bodies, fair hair, and fascinating eyes.”
“u ok?” it spells. Probably Hermione who still waits for him at her table. His fingers glide over the raised letters, spelling a simple “ok” to alleviate her worries. She surely has seen him sitting down with Malfoy and is now concerned they might try and resume their childish feud.
Malfoy only shrugs, so Harry takes it as permission and pulls out a chair. With his back to the room and the table tucked away in a corner, he momentarily feels like he is alone with Malfoy, far away from the rush of the crowd and the pressure of life. Then somebody stumbles against his chair, interrupting his thoughts and the sounds of the pub come buzzingly back to his awareness. It’s odd, but he doesn’t comment on it.
An angel guards the entrance of the graveyard. Despite their believe in superiority over the Muggles, the Malfoys are laid to rest under the watchful eyes of their symbols and Gods. Most of the headstones are withered, illegible with age and decay. So many generations of Malfoys rotting away, but Draco can’t offer them any consolation. He doesn’t care about those things anymore.
“Wait. If you would remember your training, we could maybe try to get out. But without my wand and your knowledge, all we can do is wait. Granger and Weasley are out there, working on our rescue. Sometimes you can hear their voices calling for us, so hopefully it won’t be long before we’re free. If you’d remember anything, maybe we could help from this side, but the house is doing something to you, suppressing your memories.”
“Make it good and I might even spare you the rest of the stairs,” Harry promises. It’s heady to feel every flinch, every soft puffed-moan against his sensitive skin. And Draco knows how to make it good, even if he is slightly incapacitated right now.
Draco’s panting harshly by the time they stop, his desire fueled by passionate kisses and the plug still working his hole. Harry hears it vibrate, feels the shudder wracking the slender body in his arms and he doesn’t want to wait any longer.
It’s a good thing Harry is too distracted by the fact that he and Draco are dating now to notice Draco subtly swishing his wand. The mistletoe nestled in the fairy lights slowly unfastens, flying silently through the air. Another mistletoe pinned to the window of Spintwitches follows, as well as one hanging from a streetlamp a few metres between the next shop window, which is equally adorned.
He hasn’t seen the frozen puddle underneath his feet and the abrupt motion makes him slip. He throws his arms up, uselessly grabbing at the air, and then hands are on him, trying to prevent his fall. It’s useless, though, and both he and Malfoy crash down. Harry lands hard on his back, Malfoy above him. As he opens his eyes, the glimmer of the fairy lights above catches in Malfoy’s hair, red and green and, again, perfect. Harry wants to touch it because it looks like spun gold. He sees something else, though, something leafy and green.
“Cooking dinner, I’d say. Draco called to cancel our date, so we decided to make an exception this month, come by and cook dinner.” Pansy sets the spoon down to grab a glass of rich red wine, expertly inhaling the bouquet. It’s a good vintage, that much Harry can see, even if he still doesn’t understand anything about wine, much to everyone’s disappointment.
On one absolutely orgiastic weekend, Harry did not only finish his first triathlon, but also found out that men were capable of multiple orgasms - but only after coming so many times that his dick was ready to quit on him forever. Seeing the Veela in all its glory, uninhibited and free, the huge, white wings wrapping him in a cocoon of warmth had been worth the months of tireless training and the soreness that slowly seeped into his joints.
Patience is a virtue, one that Harry has perfected over the years. Still, this last half an hour is torturous.
It had been a complete surprise and broken his heart when, for his birthday, he received a letter from her. There seemed to be nothing inside, but when Draco upended the envelope, a single wilted flower fell on the table. Harry had been outraged at first, but Draco saw the dried, orange lily and began to cry.
“You know, I’ve had a lovely time so far. We both deserved an evening away from England. But I’m sure you’re asking yourself why we’ve been this tame so far. It isn’t our style, I know, but I wanted to try something different. And since you always tell me that I don’t take you out enough, and ‘we never do anything cultural’,“ Harry raises his hands to make exaggerated quotation marks, teasing good-naturedly, “I thought we could go to the opera.”
Draco looks back at Harry, who nods in encouragement and reaches behind Draco to open the collar. There’s a visible shift in both of them. Their scene is halted for the moment because this isn’t something to be decided by Dom and sub.
He checks if the man is still watching, then turns Draco’s whole body so they face him completely, before putting both his hands back on the breasts. He feels perky nipples under his palms and rubs them softly in a few circles before he pinches them both between his thumb and index finger. He and the man exchange silent words while Draco throws his head back onto Harry’s shoulder, the sensation too much for him to stay still any longer.
It had been a complete surprise to see Harry on a bench overlooking Ladies Pond. They had sat there, watching the night making way for a spectacular sunrise, cuddling close under a conjured fleece blanket, not talking but enjoying it nevertheless.
He reaches around the tight-laced bundle and slowly helps his present to right himself. His knees must hurt, but he doesn’t concern himself with that. Harry has switched from loving husband to Dom just this second and a bit of discomfort never hurt anyone.
“No escaping into subspace just yet. We’re not done here,” Harry says with a smirk that makes Draco hot and cold and giddy.
He’d been in a relationship once that was so point- and loveless, that he was tempted to cheat on said poor sod, and even if he didn’t do it, he came close to do so.
It was then, right in the middle of a heated argument, when they all heard Draco cry out. It was a piercing scream, echoing through the empty halls, reaching them in the sitting room. They all bolted upstairs, Harry always two steps ahead, to find Draco in utter distress, shaken by nightmares, crying.
For a moment their eyes meet, grey and green, but then somebody bumps into Harry from behind and the moment is broken. When he turns back to Malfoy, he’s staring overly hard at a display of Cockroach Clusters, like they hold the answers to every question, so Harry leaves him to it, roaming the shop.
It’s hours - or maybe mere seconds - before Draco finally lands in front of him, and Harry goes to him without hesitation. They melt into each other, Harry’s nose buried in Draco’s hair, inhaling the enticing scent that is totally new but still Draco at the same time.
A few people greet Harry as he makes his way towards the east end, and he’s glad the hype about his person has died down, because he wouldn’t want to be seen going where he’s headed now. It’s a small alleyway, barely room for three shops per side, and it’s rarely frequented during the day, but that suits Harry just fine.
Or when he chews on his lips, sucking the lower one in between his teeth and then letting it go, again and again. It’s just a cute, adorable bad habit until he’s done it so often, so intense that the lip begins to bleed. Then it’s a Bad Habit.
It’s the first time today that Calliope addresses him directly. He dares to catch her gaze, sees the playful glint in her eyes. Her demeanor is still professional.
Draco’s positively wild with lust, throwing his head around, his ponytail only held by willpower. Blond hair flows messily around his shoulders. In the hollow of his throat is a small pool of sweat.
He finally reaches the platinum blond hair, silky to the touch and Harry’s fingers itch to run through it, to feel the softness, to smell the ridiculously expensive shampoo. Soon he will do just that, just a few more minutes.
And those are only the visible features. The real treasures are the things Draco usually keeps hidden. Thus began a game between them, almost two decades ago: the Veela would send out subtle signals for Harry to pick up, promising him delightful hours, depending on the kind of thing he did to finally get its attention.
The sex shop is on the eastern side of Diagon Alley, where there are fewer customers and more shadows, and he heaves a sigh of relief as soon as they enter. He doesn't come here often, and is strangely shy and intimidated by what he sees.
While he needs a good twenty minutes and two different dictionaries, Harry is proud of the result. He imagines Draco reading the note, fuming with anger but secretly ridiculously pleased Harry would do this for him. He is almost sorry he can’t be here when Draco finds the parchment.
Harry holds his wrists together with his left hand, while his right begins to caress first his belly, then wanders up to his nipple. Draco wears a tight black t-shirt, something simple, but showing off his slim waist, defined chest and broad shoulders. His nipples both peak through the thin fabric and Harry doesn’t hesitate before he roughly twists one, eliciting a whine that Draco just can’t suppress. He feels himself blush furiously, but his cock is more than interested as it presses against the dark denim of his Muggle jeans.
“But Harry, it’s detention and points if you’re caught outside after curfew, you know that!” Hermione scolded him gently.
“I’ve been thinking it over. If I do go to Dumbledore and he offers his protection… I can’t ever go home again. There’s a chance I’ll even lose my family over it. It’s a heavy choice to make. I’ll be at risk of “accidents” from my own house, distrust from your house that I may be a spy or a traitor, seen as a potential pawn against my father who is a known Death Eater. It’s a lot to think about. There’s too many paths, too many things that can go wrong.” He played with the edge of the blanket, not wanting to look up at Harry.
Draco looked intently at his supplies, running his fingers along the notebooks. He hesitated before picking up a pen. He turned to the back page and very carefully scrawled his name across the page. The look of delight on his face at how smooth it wrote was distracting. Harry found himself watching the blonde as he wrote a little bit more across the page.
When he entered the classroom, he gestured Ron and Hermione to another seat again and waited for Draco. He grew even more concerned when Professor Slughorn entered and Draco was still nowhere to be found. He tried to focus on his potion, but his eyes kept drifting to the empty table next to him. He looked up to see Hermione’s curious gaze. He shrugged quickly before turning back to his potion. After a half an hour had passed and Draco still hadn’t shown up, he turned off his cauldron and approached Slughorn.
Sorry, I got impatient when I didn’t see you at breakfast. How did it go? Did he want you to tell him it was me? The spell to send it back is Reno Agito Convelo. Gentle toss in my direction and it will come right back. The parchment has a notice-me-not charm on it, so don’t worry about Slughorn.
"I was just thinking. The main success of counterspells is knowing the spell your enemy is going to cast. If you don't speak, it makes it that much more difficult for the other person to come up with the right counter for it to be successful. Just seems like a smart skill to learn is all."
“Alright, rest here a minute. I’m going to go let Madam Pomfrey know you’re awake so she can check on you.”
“”I have had my eye on several students that I believe may be...coerced by their families to join in his service. I have tried to make it very clear that Hogwarts is a safe haven. That anyone will be protected if they do need it. It will be up to them to decide if they choose to accept the help or not.” Harry bowed his head in thought.
Short version: He asked if it was really hypothetical and I said yes. Veritaserum interview, housing arrangements, and then discussion on help to the cause. Don’t think the last is required. Said he’s spoken to several students about it already. Were you one?
Harry kept a close eye on Hermione as the crane came back. He could hear her scolding him in the back of his brain about not paying attention to the class and corresponding with Malfoy of all people. He let the crane settle under his parchment as he spent the next ten minutes adding various ingredients and stirring. He watched as the potion turned a fluorescent pink. He removed it from the heat and responded while it cooled.
"If you don't stop tapping your foot, I'm going to hex you." Hermione didn't even glance up from her Charms essay. "If you have something on your mind, say it or go away. I still have 6 inches left to write."
“First off, don’t call her that. She has a name, you know. And she’s just worried about me. It’s not like you’ve given them much room to believe you’re an okay guy. And I convinced her I was by myself. She’s going to worry, but she’s not a gossip. And I would eventually like to broadcast it to the world. I am friends with Draco, NOT a pawn of Voldemort. Someone I would like to believe will be walking his own path, not the path laid out for him by his father or a noseless, narcissistic, sociopath with a God complex, okay?”
Draco laughed bitterly. "He expects it, I assume. I wouldn't put it past him to want me dead just to make his point stick with my family."
"Anyways," she continued with a glare towards Ron, "Working towards it, you need to discipline your mind. Few people have managed it. Albus Dumbledore was one. It's not arguable that he has one of the most brilliant minds of this age, if any, but he has also molded his mind to where he can do anything he wants. There was a study done on it actually. The witch who wrote it mixed meditation and a use of a pensieve."
"I wouldn't take too much time. You don't know what can happen. There are some things you just can't leave to time and fate, especially not when it comes to life and death. The risk is just too great, especially for everyone close to you and those who depend on you."
“I’m sorry. I’m used to spelling my curtains so I don’t wake anyone. Kind of hard when you’re in bed with someone. I’ll move to the couch so I can cast a silencing charm and not disturb you again.”
“I believe they are only doing as their parents did. I think if they’re given the option, really shown that they could be accepted if they were to change, they may wish to. I’m not Trelawny. I Can’t see the future. I can only see the options and forks ahead of us and the choices that we can make. I’m willing to do what it takes to save lives. Even the lives of Slytherins. I think I’m going to follow Ron up to bed. I’m getting a bit tired myself. Good night, Hermione. I’ll see you in the morning.”
Breakfast Sunday morning help excitement for everyone. The Ravenclaws had challenged the Hufflepuffs to a friendly Quidditch match because they hadn't faced each other in awhile. Harry and Draco were excited for the chance to work on their friendship. As everyone was eating and chatting happily, the owls carrying the daily mail started to arrive. The Weasley's, Hermione, and Harry all received packages from Mrs. Weasley containing sweets and letters. Harry and Ron eagerly opened their packages arguing over what to eat first while Hermione scolded them to not eat sweets before finishing their breakfast.
“Very well. Mr. Malfoy’s injuries are severe and he will likely be in the Hospital Wing for several days. I would not like his whereabouts to be advertised and I must insist you go back to your classroom.”
Thinking of that offer filled Draco with hope for the future. He couldn't deny that Harry had what it took to take down the Dark Lord. History was too damning to deny it and only fools denied the truth. Draco was no fool. He also wasn't going to deny what that offer meant for him. A freedom from the chains his family, the Dark Lord and even being in his House had put upon him, the chance to redeem himself for the horrendous acts that he had already done, the choice to decide what his future could be, and the chance to become who he wanted to be and not what everyone else expected to be. In the enclosed quarters of his bed, Draco broke free of the disguise that he had placed upon himself. The cold, emotionless, dark mask that being a Malfoy and Death Eater required of him was slowly removed. The parts of him that he kept locked away slowly came forward to replace it. For the first time in a long time, Draco smiled with genuine happiness.
After a vigorous shake, Harry woke up from his dream. He sat there panting for a moment, rubbing the sweat from his face. His eyes had a faraway look, like he was still lost in the dream. He shook himself out of it and looked at Draco embarrassed.
He didn’t specify that it was only students. Though, I think in the case of Marked Death Eaters, he may require an Oath. I don’t want to overstep, but I don’t think you should talk to your father before talking to Dumbledore. If your parents decide they won’t switch sides, there’s a possibility they could turn you over to Voldemort or punish you themselves. I don’t want to see anything happen to you.
"Friends." He scoffed. "It's not that simple. What can you do to help against what I'm facing? My father, my mother, you-know-who, the mission I'm forced to undertake? How do you, of all people, intend to help me?" Draco's sneer was back.
"I just need to get your face." He whispered. Malfoy nodded and he grabbed a little more of the salve. As he applied it to his face, he thought how best to say what was on his mind. "I'm so sorry, Draco. I never meant for this to happen." He watched as the scars started to fade.
They both became lost in their own thoughts, both thinking how easy it was to give up all the fighting and how easy they were in each other's company. Malfoy thought of the librated feeling swelling inside him. No more thoughts of how he was going to kill Dumbledore, fear of what would happen if he failed, or having to hide away from everyone. Harry thought of what all this could possibly mean. Malfoy had effectively switched sides and he wondered how to redirect all the energy he had spent going after him. They both thought about how everything begins with an end.
“I’m sorry again for waking you up last night. Thank you for helping me. What time is it? I need to make it back before anyone else wakes up.”
“Attraction is easy. When you look at someone, you’ll feel a warmth in your belly. It’ll spread to all your limbs like warm honey. Your dick will probably get hard and you’ll have an irresistable urge to stick your tongue down their throat. Love’s a little more complicated.” He gave a wry smile.
"The only risk with my dying would be to me. I think the only people affected by it would be my mother and maybe Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle. We Slytherins aren't known for having close relationships, being self-centered and only out for ourselves of course."
Harry continued grumbling to himself all the way to the tower. Muttering the password and pushing open the door, he smiled at the relieved look on Hermione and Ron’s face when he walked in. He set his stuff down and flopped on the couch.
“What do you think you were doing in Potions today?” She crossed her arms and stared him down, oddly reminiscent of McGonagal when he had been caught breaking the rules.
“There’s someone I like quite a bit. Nothing I’ll push for of course. Too much going on, too much of a pariah. Relationships right now would only complicate things. Plenty of time for that later, just me, myself, and I for my own pleasure right now.”
“Why is this so confusing? And why does it even matter right now. I’m young. I don’t need to worry about dating or having sex or any of that right now. I’ve got bigger things to worry about.”
“Typical Griffyndor. Always sticking his neck out for someone else. Do you think he’ll go for that without more information? He won’t make you tell him who?” Harry shrugged.
