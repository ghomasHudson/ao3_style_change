When Draco looked at Harry, his grey eyes were filled with relief and something that Harry could almost call wonder. The smile on his lips carried an insurmountable adoration, and Harry couldn’t help but lean down and quickly kiss him. And his cheek, his temple, his forehead. Meanwhile, he disentangled his hand from Draco’s and wrapped his arm around his shoulders, drawing Draco closer and using his other hand to hold Draco’s. The rose-petal blush that had risen to his cheeks was absolutely
“It was lovely seeing you again, Draco.” Sirius promptly ignored the hand that Draco offered and went straight for a hug. This time, however, Draco looked less surprised and more hesitant as he returned the embrace. “I hope,” Sirius said, “that I will be seeing more of you.”
“Alright, alright,” Narcissa said, “sorry, I won’t pry. Tell me everything else. How’s Pansy doing these days?”
Ron’s face was practically the same shade of red as his hair. His eyes were stone cold and unremorseful, his hands clenched on the armrests of the chair he was sitting on in the common room. Hermione’s eyes went wide, and Harry’s mouth dropped open, his brow furrowed. A sharp breath that almost seemed like a laugh came out of Harry’s mouth, his face was contorted with disbelief.
“I think it was Saturday. Could’ve been Sunday.” Harry shifted against Draco, sliding down so his head could rest against Draco’s shoulder. The smaller boy pressed his lips against Harry’s temple. “It said… She said that she had a few boxes of my mother’s things if I wanted to go and look through them. She said she wanted to see me. Dudley, too.”
“Right, just follow me this way.” She grabbed a few menus out of a holder on the greeter’s stand and walked down the aisle to a circular booth in the corner. Once they were all seated, she set down the menus and said she would be back in a few minutes to take their orders. As she left, her eyes darted again to Harry, a speculative look in her eyes before she turned and walked away.
An exploding pain ruptured in Harry’s chest. His lungs weren’t working. He couldn’t breathe. His vision blurred and he swore he could hear Hermione talking to him, to someone, but it was all too muffled to make anything out.
As the smaller boy understood the implications, Harry saw tears gathering in Draco’s eyes. His face collapsed, his other hand raised to his mouth. Harry’s gut twisted. The words tasted like poison coming from his mouth, he couldn’t imagine how it felt to hear them. To find out something so dark about someone you loved.
“What did Ron say to you?”
“I believe that you owe me a few hours of painting you, darling,” Draco murmured against Harry’s brow. “Or days. Days would be nice, too. If I remember right, we agreed on however long I wanted. I’d clear your schedule if I was you.”
Forcing his limbs to move, Draco ambled to his suitcase beside the bed, pulling out all the art supplies he’d brought with him, then shuffled to sit down at his desk. Flipping through his sketchbook, Draco smiled at the ones that depicted his friends. His heart steadied when he saw the one he’d drawn of Pansy, a wicked grin splitting her lips. The next few pages were all of Harry. His lungs stopped stuttering as he studied the rendition of his boyfriend’s face.
And although he knew that he should probably be focusing on his practice, seeing as the last game of the season, the one that would make or break their team, was four days away, Harry found himself drifting in his thoughts. It was lucky for him that Coach Hooch was more preoccupied with phone calls and paperwork than closely observing the team.
“Harry, are you okay?” he asked, reaching to touch Harry’s hand.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open when Harry went to set him down on his bed, still puffy and dark underneath. His lanky arms tightened around Harry’s neck, bringing him down to the bed with him. So Harry grabbed the blanket and drew it over the both of them and tucked the smaller boy’s head under his chin.
The severed thread of uncertainty mutated into a thick coil of rope that slowly pulled Harry’s hands away from his boyfriend’s. It wrapped around his neck and burned in his throat and threatened to take away his air. Harry wondered how it was possible that not five minutes ago he’d been basking in the beauty that was the boy who wasn’t looking at him.
Draco knew exactly what thoughts were running through his boyfriend’s head, but he couldn’t decide whether to try and stop him or help him throttle the red-headed idiot.
The other boy looked up at him. Harry could see the turmoil roiling in his eyes.
“Of course not, sir.”
“Harry—” Draco said from beside him, his pale hand reaching out for Harry’s bare shoulder. But Harry knew what was coming. He felt the bile rising in his throat, nausea completely overwhelming him.
“Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Sirius texted. He’s waiting outside.”
Instead of wallowing in his indecision, Draco shoved the feeling to the back of his mind for later examination and responded to Harry.
Harry hummed in response, satisfied that he wasn’t the only one. He placed a kiss to the hollow of Draco’s throat and then rested his forehead on his shoulder, relishing the familiarity of Draco’s embrace. His lean arms held Harry close. His fingers brushed against his skin in random shapes. His lips pressed against his forehead, his hair, his temple. His heartbeat was strong and comforting.
Draco nodded his head almost violently, wanting more than anything at that moment for Harry to trust him with whatever it was that had caused him to look so conflicted at lunch.
Hermione pressed her lips together but Draco could still see them trembling. She took a shaky breath, barely audible over the thundering music echoing off the walls.
“Incoming,” she warned, voice low.
A charged sort of silence fell over them. He practically felt the questions brewing under Draco’s skin, begging to be released. Harry tried to convey in his gaze that it was okay for him to ask his questions, to get them out of the way now.
But Harry wasn’t sure if having sex with Draco would ruin everything. The same way it had with Ginny. Obviously, he wanted to, he wanted to take that step with his boyfriend; but wanting something and being ready for something were two very, very different things. He just hoped that he could explain his thoughts with the right words if tonight came to that.
Harry whipped his head up to see Draco sprinting down the driveway, his face blotchy and sobs still breaking from his mouth. He barely registered that his boyfriend was wearing his sweatpants and his hoodie as he shoved the gates open to run to him.
So... yeah. Keep in mind that everyone experiences these kinds of attacks differently, that they effect everyone differently. You wouldn't believe how much research I've done. It's not even close to perfect, but oh well. Leave a comment! They always make me smile, and I try to reply to all of them. I love knowing what you guys are thinking!
A moment of tense silence passed before Ron looked each of them in the eye and then walked away, to the common room door and out into the corridor. Harry finally allowed himself to relax, uncurling his fist from Pansy’s shirt. He felt Hermione’s fingers pry from his shoulders. She slid down off the couch to the floor, squeezing herself into the space between Harry and the couch, wrapping her arms around his waist from behind, resting her forehead against his back.
He seemed high off of his team’s victory, shown in the way that the grin couldn’t leave his face even as Draco kissed him, in the way that his hands never left Draco’s body, in the way that he laughed with his whole body. Draco practically bathed in it all—he didn’t think he’d ever seen Harry so blissed out, with a few exceptions, of course.
With a heavy sigh through his nose, Harry turned his face into Draco’s neck, pressing gentle kisses there. “Of course not, Dray. You have every reason to have resentments against your father.” Harry tightened his hold on his boyfriend, pulling him closer to his chest. “Your feelings are
Draco thought,
“Aw, but Harry,” Draco crooned with a wide grin, drawing a finger down the line of Harry’s nose, “it was
Draco then instructed his boyfriend to hand him several different bath salts, oils, scents, and bath bombs; he put so much in that the water he submerged himself in was a completely opaque pearly lavender color. Letting the water completely surround him was oddly relaxing. All sounds were muffled—not that there were very many to start with—and he could almost feel the weight he’d been carrying on his shoulders start to melt away. When he came back up for air, Harry was still sitting on the ledge of the bathtub, cross-legged. Only now he was holding Draco’s shampoo in his hands, an almost sheepish look on his face.
After Harry embraced both Remus and Sirius, the latter said in a soft tone, “I’m happy for you, Harry.” His grey eyes were light despite the growing darkness, pride and genuine happiness glowing behind them. “From what I’ve seen, I think that Draco is wonderful.”
Tears welled behind Draco’s eyes. Looking deep into Harry’s eyes, he started searching for any sign of falsehood, or lies. But the only thing he could find was a desperate kind of earnestness. Draco’s lips spread in a wide smile, his chest exploded with elation, his heart erupted with ecstasy.
“No, I mean,” she paused, swallowing hard, “Ron came to talk to me, just a few minutes ago. I could barely look at him, Harry. I just kept picturing him with Lavender, and thinking about him ignoring us and… And I… Am I a horrible person for not wanting everything to just go back to how it was before?”
“Alright, alright, I’m sorry. You’re lucky I love you, drunk idiot and all.”
Harry, I couldn’t
Draco sighed heavily through his nose.
Hermione laid her head on his arm as they walked to the Great Hall. “Harry, there’s no such thing as being stuck with you. You aren’t going to shove him into the dark, love. Maybe it’s a little fast, but not every relationship is the same. And from what Pansy’s told me, Draco really likes you too. He was practically fawning over you yesterday after dinner.”
Harry had eagerly agreed when Draco asked if he could draw him. He felt honored that Draco thought him worthy of his beloved pencils and charcoal.
Harry came out of the door that led to the northern common room with an unreadable expression on his face.
Clutching at his chest, Harry slumped to the floor where he’d been standing, desperately trying to blink away the black spots dancing around his hazy vision. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, couldn’t stand, he
“Don’t worry, baby, I have a hoodie in the backseat that’ll cover it.”
Guys, I wrote this while I'd only had five hours of sleep and running solely on hot chocolate and crackers, and while I should've been sleeping. Which makes no sense, because I was experiencing some serious writer's block. I really should've picked another time to do it, but I guess there's no time like the present! So, if it's terrible, I sincerely apologize.
“Haha, very funny.” With a small laugh, Hermione’s head fell back onto his stomach, scrolling through his phone.
Chortling laughter burst out of Harry’s mouth, quickly followed by Pansy giggling and Theo choking. As he gently shoved Pansy off of him, he patted Hermione’s hands to let her know that he was okay. She just stayed where she was, and Harry knew that she was grounding herself, even as she let a muffled, quiet laugh past her lips.
deal was. The only thing running through his head was that this boy had hurt Hermione, that this boy that had wormed his way into Harry’s head so thoroughly, had hurt his best friend.
They’d stayed up for at least an hour, whispering to each other. Draco had listened to each and every word Harry said, listened to each story and fact that made him want to break down in tears just envisioning it. The insides of his cheeks were raw from biting them. Harry had dozed off in the middle of a sentence, and Draco hadn’t had the heart to wake him.
Theo wasn’t a small person, he was only a fraction of an inch shorter than Harry himself, and he wasn’t exactly weak. He would be a challenge for Harry, but Harry was confident that he was more capable than the other boy.
Harry felt the tension rising like strings were pulling at his heart, knocking it around in his chest. So instead, Harry turned to Mrs. Malfoy with what he hoped was a pleasant enough expression on his face and offered her his hand.
Scrambling, jolts of unfiltered shock jarring him, Draco leaned—fell—back on the steering wheel, yelping when the sound of the car’s horn startled him even further. The adrenaline that had already been flooding Draco’s entire body multiplied faster than he’d ever thought possible.
My dearest readers, it has now officially been a month since I last updated. *please don't hate me* With this quarantine and so much else going on, both my mental and physical health have been declining. But! I'm not giving up. I'm so sorry that this chapter is so extremely late, especially after that cliffhanger y'all went crazy over. I hope you like this chapter, even though it's pretty much trash.
The hallway was where he got nervous. Harry had a pretty good idea of the teachers’ rounds schedule, but he also knew that they tended to switch it up once in a while. He prayed that tonight was not one of those times.
Waving the unpleasant thoughts from his mind, Draco turned back around to crawl into bed with Harry.
He honestly debated whether or not to answer it or not.
Thinking was impossible for Draco. He may have even forgotten his own name. Though he surely remembered Harry’s, as he moaned and whined it into his boyfriend’s ear and into his open, panting mouth. He didn’t bother to hold back any desperate, needy noises that were drawn out from him with the rhythmic rolling of Harry’s hips into his.
“Harry?” came Hermione’s voice, somewhere above him. “I have Sirius on the phone, I’m just going to put him on speaker, okay?”
“Nope. You haven’t finished making your absence up to me.”
“Draco, are you alright?” Blaise asked. He didn’t respond. They finally reached the Maths classroom; Draco walked to his seat and sat down, staring at the wood of his desk.
Draco couldn’t stop smiling. His heart was pounding in his chest, his skin was tingly wherever Harry touched him. They closed the door to the courtyard behind them, and Draco saw that Harry was smiling, too.
Harry to be his. He didn’t want anyone else holding his hand, he didn’t want anyone else touching his skin. He wanted to be
might disappoint you.”
Heaving breaths echoed off the stone walls of the corridor. Rapid footsteps slapped down on the stone floor. Everything seemed to be made of stone—Draco’s limbs included as he forced his legs to go faster, pushing as he’d never pushed before. The imposing darkness suffocated each struggling breath that tried to make its way to Draco’s lungs.
Letting out a huff of a laugh, Harry said, “Alright.” He started moving to get up off the couch. Immediately, Draco locked his arms around Harry’s chest and crossed his legs over his hips, bringing him back down to his own body with a surprising amount of force.
“Yeah, it was worth it. You look like a wet kitten.”
As they approached the door, the atmosphere shifted, now charged with the combined uneasiness of both boys. Harry felt his hands begin to sweat. It was like his lungs struggled to function, the air had to fight to get to his brain and each of his muscles.
Draco looked at him for a second before he seemed to process that he was supposed to shake Harry’s hand. “Draco Malfoy. I really am sorry.”
The only response Draco gave before they all sat down at the table was a huff of indignation. Harry gave his fingers a gentle squeeze under the table, setting their entwined hands on his thigh and running his thumb up and down the side of Draco’s hand.
“Did you… Did you make those?” Harry asked, his voice sounded amazed.
“Come on, we should go find Pansy,” Blaise countered.
flowers?” When he looked up at Draco, there was an inquisitive yet analytical glint in Sirius’ eyes.
It seemed to be just the thing he needed to get the words to come out of his mouth.
Almost immediately, Harry grinned so widely his eyes crinkled. Draco could see the silver lining his eyes. He was sure that he sported a matching smile, so overwhelmed with every emotion running through his veins. His fingers tangled in the bigger boy’s black hair, marveling at how soft it was despite how messy. He
“God, yes,” Harry panted back, his warm breath fanning over Draco’s neck. And just like that, Draco’s briefs were pulled off his legs, and he was left completely bare while Harry trailed his lips up his right thigh. He reached into his nightstand drawer, and Draco saw him bring out a small bottle and a condom. “Tell me if you want me to stop, alright?”
“But-”
But that didn’t mean the words didn’t make his blood boil. He hated them with everything he was worth. He hated that he couldn’t know for sure what his parents were like, hated that he didn’t have a single memory of them.
Opening the door to Number 12 Grimmauld Place was like breathing in fresh air after being stuck underwater. Familiar smells of sandalwood, vanilla, and jasmine surrounded Harry as he looked down the familiar hallway, which was lined with countless framed photos. Sirius’ hand on his shoulder and the smile on his face reminded him of the first time he’d walked through this door—one of the happiest days of Harry’s life.
Skeptically, Draco considered the boy. He’d been gone for far too long to have just been getting water. He’d left without a word.
he thought,
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry could feel his body trembling. His hands were fisted in Draco’s shirt, his breathing unsteady and stuttering.
Draco had so many things wandering through his head that he didn’t even notice that Harry had started walking forward without him. Harry paused and looked back, seeming to notice that his blond wasn’t there.
The sound of Harry’s pounding heart drowned out everything else. The only thing he could think about was Draco’s face—afraid, vacant—as he’d gotten in the car to drive away, and how he’d known that something was bound to go wrong.
By some miracle, Draco forced his limbs to move and ran after Ron, who had already taken off, only able to see because of the redhead’s flashlight. The only coherent thought in his head was
him. His breathing was still heavy and uneven, his one hand was still knotted in Harry’s hair, the other fixed on his shoulder. The taste of him was still on Draco’s tongue, peppermint and something citrusy- like grapefruit. When he looked back at Harry, his green eyes were dark with desire. His hands continued caressing the pale skin on his torso, the scrape of his rough calluses against his skin made the blond boy tremble. He bent his head down to proceed kissing up the column of Draco’s neck, up to his jaw.
She threw her arms around Draco’s neck—reaching across Harry to get there, but she just tugged him closer. Draco was sure that the look on his face was comical gold. He felt warmth blooming in his chest, a different sort than when Harry touched him. Draco cautiously wrapped his hands around Hermione’s small frame, looking at Harry over her hair with wide eyes.
And there we are! I love getting comments and hearing from you guys! Kudos are pretty cool too, but like, comments give me life, sooo... I hope you all enjoyed this!
After a few minutes of silence, Draco could hear the evened out breathing of the others in the room, a few snores every now and then. The other boys had fallen back asleep. Draco looked back up at Harry, only to see his eyelids heavy and drooping. He could feel his own head throbbing with how little sleep he had gotten the night before.
Draco was very confused. He had been sitting in his room, staring at his cell for who knows how long, and Harry still hadn’t texted him.
Only, Draco knew that his father didn’t see it as such. He’d seen it as loathsome. Abominable.
She walked away in the direction of her desk.
Draco could’ve sworn that when he slept, he kept to himself.
—it never failed to amaze Draco. And watching him
and he was
If it's trashy, I'm sorry. I wrote most of it at like three in the morning, for some unknown reason of fate. Or something. But yeah. I love comments, seriously, they give me life. So if you feel even the slightest inclination to leave one, do it! I hope you guys liked it! <3
“Alright, off with the lot of you.” Hooch turned away, a reluctantly small smile on her thin lips.
“Y-yeah of course,” Harry responded, letting go of Draco’s hand so he could take the bags in both hands while Draco opened the door. He immediately missed Harry’s hand in his own. However, the moment he opened the door, he was bombarded by his friends. Pansy stopped at the sight of Harry, who had entered the common room with slight hesitation. Draco knew why after he caught sight of Theo, who had a look on his face that was both suspicious and nearly murderous. Draco sent him a warning glare that Harry didn’t see. He hoped it conveyed the message,
“That’s good.” Harry moved to stand again, brushing off his pants. “Look, I have to go. But thank you—for apologizing.” He took a step away but stopped. “When she’s ready, you need to talk to Hermione, too. She deserves an explanation and an apology.”
But that didn’t stop him from worrying ever further as he walked into the weight room, not the slightest bit surprised to find Harry—dressed only in a pair of basketball shorts—demolishing the punching bag in the farthest corner of the room. Muscles rippled and shifted under the scarred brown skin of his back, his legs, his arms, everywhere. Sweat gleamed and dripped down his body.
And immediately regretted it. He felt his ears go hot, his neck and chest flushing red.
“Does that… disappoint you?” Harry asked, feeling as though his heart had dropped to his stomach. He tried hard to swallow past the burning feeling in his throat. “Do
Without the least bit of warning, Draco swiftly snatched Harry’s keys from his jeans pocket and said, “I’m just… I’m gonna wait in the car, okay?”
“Mr. Potter, I do not expect you to be fully aware of your surroundings, what with you only having half a brain, but surely you must notice that Longbottom requires assistance,” Professor Snape, the chemistry teacher, drawled at Harry in his snobbish, slightly nasally voice, the one that always set Harry on edge. Harry looked up to see that hooked nose, and the professor’s beady black eyes looking down on him.
he thought, looking intently into his boyfriend’s eyes.
“Physically restraining Theo from beating up Terry, for the most part.”
He was not expecting to find his boyfriend curled in bed with Hermione Granger.
“Harry, I can’t… I can’t do this.” Theo shifted on the bench. He slouched even farther—like gravity pulled on him with a greater magnitude than the rest of the world—and leaned into Harry’s hand on his shoulder. “I
“Draco, you need to stay calm,” Hermione said. Her black eyes flitted between him and Harry, who had let out a terrified whimper. Draco’s heart squeezed and his entire body ached to touch him, but he didn’t know if that was okay. “If you can’t stay calm, I’ll need you to leave. Right now, Harry can feel all the panicked and frightened energy in the room, and he can’t tell the difference between it and his own.”
Harry felt his lips quirk up, almost a smile. “You can ask me whatever you want.” He walked through the door, taking the other boy with him. “After I take a shower.”
Harry tried for a smile, but it was shaky at best. “I understand your concern, I really do. I would feel the same if it was my best friend. But I have no intention of hurting Draco. I like him, and I wouldn’t ever want to cause him pain or make him sad. I know that you’re not going to take me on my word for it. But I hope you’ll give me a chance before you attempt to murder me.”
Draco was worried about Harry.
Hermione made a small squeaking, gasping, surprised noise that seemed to come out without her own consent. Her hands squeezed Harry’s arm so tightly he was sure she would cut off his circulation, but Harry didn’t think he would notice even if she did. He could feel her arms trembling, he could feel her breathing stutter from how closely she was pressed against him. She started tugging on his arm, trying to pull him back out into the hallway they had come from. He let her pull him along.
“What’s up, Ted?”
Of course, Draco had no intention of being embarrassed in front of those shoulders and that hair, and so he stayed exactly as he was, head snuggled into the crook of the boy’s neck, arms wrapped around the boy’s left arm, trying to keep his breathing even.
It had finally happened. Draco had finally seen Harry in the hallway. He had been walking from English to Maths, and Draco had caught a glimpse of that fluffy, unruly black hair, and he knew that it couldn’t possibly have been anyone else. Harry’s green eyes sparkled as he talked with another boy, a red-haired one that Draco didn’t know. Draco waved his hand, trying to get Harry’s attention. Those green eyes finally flashed in his direction and settled on Draco’s face.
He started walking towards the door and said to the others, “We’ll be at my car in less than ten minutes, meet us there.” The chuckles receded as he walked out of the common room and into the corridor.
stop him. Harry needed him. Whatever it was, Draco would’ve run across burning hot coals and a bed of nails to get to him.
“Hey, baby.”
“Whatever,” was his reply. “How are you even still awake at this hour?” Draco asked, a little surprised that his usual, slightly snotty self was able to come through in his words. Harry’s smile faltered just the smallest bit, a little light leaving his eyes, only noticeable by Draco because, well, obviously, he was still obsessing over those green eyes.
Harry would be lying if he said he hadn’t wondered about the same things before. Even before he’d gotten the letter from Petunia.
in love with you, Dray. I’m in love with every part of you—your smile, your laugh, your mind, the way your nose crinkles when you concentrate. Every shadow you try to hide, every piece of yourself that you aren’t proud of, all the things that make you so imperfectly perfect—I love all of it.”
. And yet they’d lost.
It's finally here! This took forever to write, and I really hope that it's not complete and utter trash. I hope you all enjoy this one! It's a lot longer than I first anticipated.
“Hit me.”
And Harry loved every second of it: the coddling, the cuddling, all of it. He was usually expected to be the supportive one, the first one to offer a shoulder to cry on, the one that offered comfort, protection, love. And while he loved being that person, there were times that the pressure threatened to strangle him. But with Draco, it was more of an even balance. They were both there for each other, both of them supported one another)
“Harry—”
“Does it make me an awful person,” Draco asked, “if I’m already dreading having to see my father?”
“People of color,” Hermione interrupted. “The term is
What was wrong with Hermione? He’d barely caught a glimpse of her hands around Harry’s arm, her body pressed tightly against his, before they had both been rushing away.
But even his mother’s happiness couldn’t change that the noise in the manor drove Draco insane. He could hardly handle the noise in the Great Hall of Hogwarts—this was completely overwhelming. He’d spent the first hour standing in the entrance hall, welcoming guests with his parents under the smothering gaze of his father. Then they’d moved on to the dining room for dinner, where the sounds only amplified off the walls. Draco’s knuckles still hurt from clenching his hands so tightly.
Lucius had been the one to arrange them. Conveniently following after Draco had come out to his parents as gay. Luckily for him, however, none of the few therapists he’d seen had seemed to have any interest in his father’s agenda. Most were actually quite nice.
Harry had left Draco standing there in the hall after telling him that he would be back in a few minutes. The moment that he and Hermione had walked into the common room, she had practically tackled him in a hug. Of course, Harry, being as well-built as he was, wasn’t even moved by her much smaller force. But he could practically feel the energy buzzing off of her. He wrapped his arms around her.
Harry could have exploded. Right at that moment, his heart combusted. His mind muddled every noise like he was underwater. He was in a sea of noise, crashing over him. He briefly registered Lee Jordan announcing their win, but he didn’t really hear the words. The sounds of cheering washed over him, but they couldn’t manage to sink in.
“Someone’s on cloud nine, eh?” Blaise said from the doorway. Draco didn’t even bother moving to look at him. Instead, he closed his eyes and let out what must have been the most pathetic sounding high-pitched sigh he’d ever made. He could practically feel Blaise’s eyebrows shoot up. He felt the bed dip down with his weight as Blaise sat on the bed next to where Draco had flopped on it.
The watch on his wrist had just ticked midnight when he heard footsteps through the door. Draco had left it open the smallest bit in order to hear anyone approaching. He was practically vibrating with apprehension and the hope that Harry would think sneaking out was worth all this.
Sighing, knowing she was right, Draco was finally able to pry Harry’s fingers from his hair, instead twining their fingers together and softly squeezing. Harry gripped Draco’s fingers with iron strength. His eyes shot open, blown wide. Even in the darkness, Draco could tell that Harry wasn’t really seeing him. He wasn’t seeing much of
Finally, after his eyes had unfocused staring at the ceiling, Draco’s phone pinged. Unashamedly scrambling to immediately unlock his phone, he grinned at his boyfriend’s response, laughing to himself.
“You coming?” he called. Draco shook his head slightly and walked towards him. Their steps fell in sync as they walked into the entrance hall, where Harry stopped again and turned to Draco with what looked like hope in his eyes.
, as much as he’s already planned my
“I would totally kiss you right now,” Draco confessed, “but you smell
With a small smile, Draco stretched up to kiss him, bringing Harry’s head down to meet him in the middle. Though it was short and sweet, any amount of Harry always brought a smile to Draco’s lips—the same smile he wore as he disentangled himself and walked back into his common room, wishing he could bring Harry with him.
) and stood before him with his hands on his hips, what he hoped was a stern expression upon his face.
of a chance of winning.” The wide-eyed, incredulous look on Ferreira’s stupid, bastard face was almost concerningly satisfying. “I hope your ego isn’t bruised too much. Now, it was delightful to meet you and catch up and everything, but Harry and I have more important things to do, so, if you’ll politely excuse us.”
up here,” Ron sneered, throwing a hateful glance at Draco.
“Just a few that I figured you’d like.”
Harry told himself,
Hermione and Draco both turned over their shoulders to squint at Ronald through the darkness, aided by the light from his flashlight. Practically twiddling his thumbs, the boy looked so very helpless—Draco almost felt bad for him.
Harry. I didn’t even really understand
Draco closed his mouth and knew that the flush had spread to his chest. Harry laughed, squeezing his hand slightly to let him know he meant it good-heartedly. They spent the rest of the drive in comfortable silence as Draco traced shapes on Harry’s palm. (He was mesmerized by the warm brown tone of his skin, the calluses on his fingers. He loved the lines on his palm, and he couldn’t help imagining what it might feel like to have those hands on his face, his waist, his skin in general. He couldn’t help but imagine how it must feel like to have those hands in his hair, to have them caressing his face)
“Draco!” He shouted, shifting the focus of his light around the room until he finally saw who he was looking for. He started making his way through the room, weaving between frightened students to get to Draco.
“Teddy’s just fine, he’s talking and everything,” Harry divulged, “And Astrid couldn’t be more perfect.” He smiled despite himself—despite how it must have looked to Draco—then shook himself out of his reverie. He peered at the other boy with narrowed eyes, put out that he had been distracted so efficiently.
“Incoming? That’s all the warning I get?.”
When he finished wiping at Harry’s face, Draco handed him the glass of water he’d set down and simply said, “Rinse.” With shaky hands, Harry took it from him and rinsed his mouth, feeling the shadow of his dream gradually leave him.
She gulped down her orange juice, letting a grin grace her lips at the laughter that erupted around her. That was when Draco knew that Pansy would be fine, in time.
Harry could hear all the questions wrapped up in that one concern:
“Sorry, just let me drop a few IQ points and get on your level.”
“Really Harry, if you’re so obsessed with him, you may as well just ask him to be your boyfriend now,” Hermione advised.
That’s why after Draco had fallen asleep, Harry had taken a quick run down to his car to grab his boyfriend’s things and stashed them under his bed, attempting to at least somewhat clear his mind.
There was a thump on the other side of the curtains. Then a groan. One that sounded distinctly like Theo.
“Go talk to Theo.” Alicia’s black eyes darted over to the boy. He was sitting on one of the benches lining the lockers, his head in his hands, fingers clenched in his brown hair. “He hasn’t moved from that spot in at least three minutes.”
With silver-lined eyes, Draco’s watery, beaming grin was the impeccable twin to Harry’s. His pale face had flushed red, turning the tips of his ears pink in the most adorable way possible. Blossoms of fondness flowered all throughout Harry’s body, adoration replaced the blood flowing through his veins; devotion, respect, fondness, and affection filled his bones.
She nodded her head and looped her arm through his as they walked to English.
“Are you flirting with me, Potter?”
to think with your head, too, Draco.”
Harry did a double-take. “You’re kidding, right?”
For all its intensity, neither boy accelerated the kiss—it remained slow, passionate, and molten. Harry could taste strawberries on Draco’s tongue, and it made him smile into his kiss and trace shapes into his boyfriend’s silky skin.
Not for the burning resentment in his chest. Not for the raging possessiveness he felt in his bones, for the ache to prove that Harry was
When he’d finished, Harry gently gripped Draco’s fingers and led him out of the locker room. They walked in comfortable silence all the way to the southern common room. Draco was loath to leave the warmth that Harry embodied, but he knew that he had to if Harry were to get to his own common room in time.
Pansy scoffed. “Isn’t that what you’re doing right now?”
Even though it was through a screen, Draco looked deep into Harry’s green eyes, and let that feeling of safety blanket him. Each of his muscles relaxed and he let the tension in his face go.
a moment to realize that Draco was kissing
Draco’s hand came up to fist the fabric of his t-shirt at his chest. Harry felt his boyfriend’s breathing speed up.
But seeing those doors also made Draco deflate inside.
“Harry asked me out.”
Draco didn’t feel any hesitation, didn’t feel any fear in his heart.
was in.
After so much time, work, and struggle, he’d finally been able to accept them as part of him, a part of his past that he couldn’t just lock away and pretend didn’t exist. He didn’t like it, he didn’t like that this was what he came from, that this was the story he was given to tell. He didn’t like that there were times it crept back to him. He didn’t like that it still affected him. But he wouldn’t be afraid of it.
With that, he made his way to the adjacent locker room. Draco followed, not giving up just yet. He watched as Harry opened his locker and dropped his bag on the bench before stepping into one of the shower stalls. Almost immediately, steam started pouring out of the stall from the rushing water, carrying the scent of vanilla and grapefruit.
Harry clutched Draco even tighter to his body. The images flashing through his head made his stomach plummet.
“Please, Draco. Just promise me you won’t.”
Especially after Ron stood suddenly and walked out. There wasn’t much he could do, much he
“Oh? How did it go?”
Blaise and Draco were less extreme, scooting closer to Pansy and looking at her with sympathy swirling in their eyes. Although Draco had no idea how to empathize with her, had no idea how it must feel, he wrapped his arms around Pansy and cradled her head against his shoulder. She made no effort to move away or to move further into him. She simply stared unblinking at her hands in her lap.
turned on the sun?”
“Draco has what could possibly be the biggest crush on a certain Harry Potter,” Blaise had explained through his dying laughter. Theo then looked at Draco, who explained the whole story through again for his other friend.

“Goodnight, Harry.”
Walking to the front doors of Hogwarts Academy was quite possibly one of the most anxiety-inducing things that Harry Potter had ever done. Only, it wasn’t the journey there that terrified him, but rather what awaited him on the other side of those ornately-carved doors. Certainly, nothing could go quite as horrible as the scenarios Harry had playing on repeat in his mind—hostility, abduction, murder, spontaneous combustion, the likes—but there was always a chance.
And if Harry’s eyelids fluttered closed and he drifted off to sleep with Draco’s fingers in his hair and his plush lips over his heart, well, there was no one else to see it.
Not even a second later, the door opened again and Ron stepped in, a water bottle in hand.
“The second after you left, Harry’s ex-boyfriend Cedric Diggory showed up,” Draco seethed, “I think he wants to get back together with Harry. He was totally all up in Harry’s business, he tried to hold his hand! When he left, he told Harry that he missed him.”
When his shoulders began to ache, Harry knew he was finished. Swiping a hand over his sweat-ridden face, he turned to look at Draco; he was still hitting the bag, though with less enthusiasm than before.
Running his tongue over his lips, Cedric languidly looked Harry up and down again before stating in a low voice, “I’ll be there.” His grey eyes finally seemed to notice Draco’s presence, but he didn’t seem fazed. His mouth stretched in an almost smug-looking smirk. He ran his hand through his already-mussed hair before looking at Hermione.
“Granger,” he paused, swallowed hard, “Hermione. I… um. I just, I know that what I said to you was awful, and horrible, and I’m so sorry.” Draco swallowed again, he couldn’t seem to dislodge the horrible feelings there. “I grew up with a father who has no regard for colored people-”
Draco shook his hand with a smile, answering with a steadfast, “Yes, sir.”
Sirius murmured to him, “Shh, Harry, you’re safe. You’re safe, my beautiful boy. Shh…” Dropping his head to Sirius’ shoulder, Harry let his godfather’s words wash over him in soothing waves. His hands ran up and down Harry’s back, lovingly and tenderly. “Breathe, son. Deep breaths, you’re safe, shh…”
However, Draco could see the sincerity in the way he looked at Harry, whose eyes were fixed on Ronald as well. But glazed over and tired as they were, Draco didn’t think that his boyfriend really cared at this point. Draco could feel the exhaustion inside of him, begging him to sleep.
Harry had always made him feel validated and important. He’d never gotten truly angry or malicious, even when they fought. He’d never dismissed Draco or his feelings.
When Ron stood in front of him, breathless and panicked, Draco felt a thread of worry work itself through him.
So, rather than questioning Harry, he said, “Of course I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
He felt himself already melting inside.
“Harry,” Hermione leaned down to whisper in his ear, her hands pausing on his shoulders, “incoming, two o’clock.” Harry’s hands hesitated in Pansy’s hair as he looked up to see none other than Ronald Weasley traipsing towards them with his hands stuffed in his jean pockets. The others hadn’t seen him yet. Rapidly tying off Pansy’s braid, Harry forced himself to maintain a neutral expression, even as a wave of boiling annoyance washed through him.
“Wait, wait, wait,” he’d said, “you’re telling me that you saw
He heard Harry’s sharp intake of breath, his gaze focused on Draco’s ribs. Draco looked down, only to see a large purple and blue bruise covering the expanse of his right ribs. Memories of falling down the stairs flashed through his mind—he couldn’t really recall everything that had happened, but he knew it was a possibility that he’d slammed his side on one of the stairs at some point.
It was silent for a moment before Harry finally found the will to peel his eyes open. He was met with the soft yellow light from his bedside lamp, illuminating the room.
“Draco, dear, have you decided what university you’ll be studying at?” Iris had asked, glancing at Lucius, who turned toward his son with an expectant glint in his grey eyes.
Blaise was the one to open the door, in a similar state, minus the pigtails. He took one glance at Draco, and a nearly maniacal smile came across his face. He took out his phone and snapped a picture before Harry could even protest; he wasn’t even sure if he objected in the first place.
“Would you be okay with that?” Draco asked. He watched as Harry’s smile faltered for just a moment—but Draco knew that Harry would be okay with whatever choice he made.
Now, running his hand up and down Draco’s back, Harry asked, “Do you want to talk about it now, or in the morning, love?” He felt Draco bury his face in his chest, curling his arms around him and throwing one of his legs over Harry’s hips.
upset about, anyway?” Pansy demanded, “That Cedric talked to Harry? That Harry didn’t immediately get rid of him?”
“Hmm?”
His lips pursed together in a tight line. “...have we
“Ouch.” The arms around Draco’s waist tightened. “You wound me, kitten.”
“Yes and no,” Harry started, gently. “I regret that night with Ginny—drunk sex is never a good idea, and it only ended up hurting both of us. But… I don’t regret being with Cedric, as crazy as that sounds. Even though the relationship ended horribly, I was happy—for the most part—while it lasted. And sex with him was part of that. Both of those experiences taught me a lot, and I like to think that I came out better.”
“No, it’s alright,” Harry slowly moved to sit up again, his muscles protesting each movement. He didn’t exactly know why he protested—he just knew that she had already done enough for him. “I can do it.”
“Of course I’ll be okay with that.” Harry’s hand on Draco’s thigh resumed its soothing rubbing motions. “Whatever you want to do today, kitten, we’ll do it.” He leaned forward and softly pressed his lips to Draco’s, such a different sensation than a few minutes ago.
“Alright, alright,” Harry conceded, “we met on the plane here. He sort of fell asleep on my shoulder on the way. His name’s Draco. Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled.
He had only failed to capture the emotions that those green eyes always carried. Draco knew that he’d never be able to get them right unless he was looking at those eyes while he drew them. He just didn’t know what Harry would think if he saw Draco’s hands in action.
Harry woke with his eyes still closed and every muscle in his body tight and unrelenting, sharply inhaling and clenching his fingers in the sheets. The rhythm of his breaths stuttered, his heartbeat was frantically hectic. Whatever memory of his dream—
Anyway, enough of my boring complaining, I hope you enjoy this chapter!
But he didn’t know all that much about Harry’s past. It was like one big blank. There were a few little things he’d pieced together himself, but it wasn’t the same as being shown the whole picture.
Harry ran in his direction, and only stopped once he was right in front of the other boy.
Draco waited for Harry on a bench against the lockers. Steam from his shower had started to fill the locker room. Draco couldn’t even think about how his boyfriend was showering literally
nasty morning breath.”
Where Harry had been expecting Draco to slowly awaken with fluttering eyes and his darling, tiny kitten yawns, Draco instead inhaled sharply and shot straight up in his chair, loudly proclaiming,
When Harry nodded at him, he punched the bag. And pouted when it didn’t move. Harry struggled to keep his laughter inside when Draco turned to him with his frown. It was kind of adorable, honestly. He set his hands on the smaller boy’s waist, shifting his posture until he was satisfied with how his body was set.
And then he walked out the door and got bothered all over again.
At an especially sharp nip, Draco whimpered and dug his fingers into the muscles of Harry’s back. His boyfriend only made a deep, nearly animalistic growling sound in the back of his throat and Draco felt him lick over the bite. He removed one of his hands from Harry’s back to wrap around the headrest, drawing himself closer and pressing Harry further into the seat. His entire body felt like he was on fire, he was burning, his heart was bursting.
“I…” Harry started, his voice rough and so low that only Draco could hear, “like… that one.”
“Alright, go for it.” He lifted his head and shut his locker before taking Draco’s hand again, gently leading him out of the locker rooms and into the school hallway. “Ask me anything you want.”
The northern common room was brimming with students; even those from younger years were dancing to the upbeat music that seemed to come from every corner of the room. But Draco couldn’t be bothered with any of that.
“Because.” Draco stamped his foot. “You paid for our first date.”
Lifting one of his hands in surrender, Harry couldn’t help chuckling in return. “Nothing, I swear!” He gently grabbed Draco’s hand, twining their fingers together. “He’s just too polite for his own good.”
“That’s amazing!” Blaise was smiling like a lunatic. Pansy gave Draco one last squeeze before she disentangled herself from the three boys, yawning. “I’m not supposed to be here in the first place, but all of this is amazing Draco. And you’re not allowed to leave for that date without telling me first!” Pansy stopped at the doorway, sending them one last smile before she left for the girls’ dormitories.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione looked down at her hands as she replied, “We had a bit of what you could call, a falling-out, this morning. He’ll come around, though.” Draco nodded in understanding, he’d had more than his fair share of fights with his friends in past years.
In the past few weeks, Draco had become closer with Hermione, trading information about classes while also exchanging good-natured banter. He’d learned that she was overwhelmingly smart; if he had been less proud, he would have admitted that she outranked even him as the best student of their year. She always had an answer for everything, and in those rare cases she didn’t, Hermione researched and swam through the information until she found one that satisfied her.
“My father is immensely racist, Hermione. I grew up with those words being tossed about like they were nothing, it was normal to me. But-but when I said that to you, I instantly, immediately regretted it. I hated the way that those words felt when I said them, and I wanted to take them back so badly,” he paused, ready to bear the worst of it, “I was just too much of a coward to do it. I was so ashamed and- and I hated myself for it. And I couldn’t stand to let you see that.”
A relieved sigh came through the phone. Harry’s lips twitched upwards at the sound of it. Just hearing Sirius’s voice made his heart calm, his breathing easier. The reassurance he got from just that one word was almost ridiculous, but he didn’t care.
But Draco hadn’t been that person for a
When he finally managed to look up at Harry’s face, Draco saw his boyfriend smirking at him with an amused glint in his eyes. His face turned crimson as he realized,
Harry froze mid-step.
Harry could only think of ways to murder Ron slowly, and Hermione laying curled on herself on the couch. He could feel his fists clenching with violence, his blood boiling, his jaw muscles fluttering.
Looking down at him now, peaceful and sleeping and
A drowsy atmosphere had settled over their little group. Concentrating on Pansy’s hair was nearly impossible for Harry, but the familiar movements were calming, helping him wind down.
(See the end of the chapter for
We are people first. We aren’t less than, we are just as human as you.” At that moment she glanced at Harry, who dipped his head in agreement. Draco looked down and nodded, he could feel his ears going pink.
He knew that Harry could see the flush on his face, and Draco couldn’t stop thinking about that moment in the changing room when Harry had said he was interested.
“You’re thinking too hard,” Harry muttered in a sleep-deepened voice, “I can feel it.” The vibrations of his voice sent a pleasant tingle down Draco’s spine.
The hand in Harry’s hair froze. Draco’s breathing stuttered, and Harry felt his boyfriend’s shoulders shudder with silent tears. Harry couldn’t exactly identify the messy, overpowering emotion he felt tearing his heart apart; a concoction of violent anguish, fury, and bitter heartache that made his chest feel as though it was collapsing in on itself. (He knew. He knew what it felt like. To be yelled at, screamed at, and blamed by the people who were supposed to love him) Pressure built rapidly behind Harry’s eyes, but he kept the tears at bay as Draco continued.
“Class is over, Harry. You can stop fantasizing now,” Hermione teased, “We have to head to lunch now, you can ask Malfoy to sit with us again if you’re really so desperate.” Harry just smiled at her and jumped up from his seat, quickly gathered his things, and hurried out the door as Hermione linked elbows with him. There were only a few stragglers left in the hallways, making their way to lunch as well.
Even he heard the slowness of his words, felt the drain of concentration it took to even get the simplest two words out. Harry laughed harder, kissing his forehead and bringing Draco’s body closer to his own.
When they both finally pulled away for breath, it was no surprise that neither had any more tears in their eyes. A moment of silence was spent simply gazing at each other, and Harry knew that he could do so for hours.
who would do those things.
It didn’t quite make the thought any easier.
...surprise...?! I'm still alive! So, yeah, there's been quite a break between this chapter and the last one, and I'm so sorry for that, but I promise that I have some good excuses if you really want to hear them. But anyway, I hope all of my dearest readers like this chapter at least. I love you all <3
for the past two and a half months?” Pansy exclaimed. “Don’t you think that if he
Thursday and Friday afternoon had been washing the chalkboards in every classroom throughout the school. Every. Single. Classroom. Luckily for Harry, he’d worked quickly and Snape had let him go earlier than he’d previously said. However, Snape hadn’t let him leave without spouting a few choice comments about Harry’s father, the same as he had done every detention this week.
Ron’s eyes narrowed, Draco could see his body tense. “That’s my room too, and Harry needs me more than he’ll ever need you.”
in every way.
Draco’s arms tightened around Harry like he was assuring that yes, he really was there. Soft lips pressed against Harry’s skin, soothing and delicate kisses on his neck, his shoulder, under his ear.
Draco hadn’t known what to do, at that moment. His mind had just blanked. He’d known, subconsciously, that Harry had been in relationships before. He’d
“Me too,” Draco answered, receiving a pat on the back before Sirius smiled and took the backpack he’d been carrying, then got in the car.
Idle chatter followed the loud laughter, and Harry felt unbelievable loving warmth spread throughout his entire body, reaching every nook and cranny. He almost felt like he could be glowing. He’d missed this. He’d missed being with his little family.
much better than you and Ron beating him up.”
Draco offered a polite, “Hi, Teddy.”
“You start the water,” Harry said, his voice deep, gravelly, and low, “and I’ll be back with your things, okay?” His green eyes were so intense, so deep and focused on Draco. It was all the smaller boy could do to nod while Harry leaned forward to softly touch his lips to Draco’s cheek. He leisurely removed his fingers, taking a moment to skim over everything he could touch, and walked out the door, leaving it cracked behind him.
Harry thought, goading her on even if just in his own thoughts.
All too soon, he felt Harry’s hands recede from his hair. He tapped on Draco’s shoulder, and he reluctantly immersed himself in the water again, rinsing the shampoo from his hair. Coming back up, he found Harry waiting for him with the bottle of Draco’s conditioner in his hands.
Rolling his eyes and shaking his head, he walked through the doors to the boys’ dormitories and headed straight for Harry’s, familiar enough with the hallway that he was sure he could walk to Harry’s room in the dark, or with his eyes closed. He couldn’t believe the
Fred plopped onto the couch beside them with a brown translucent bottle in his hands. George wasn’t far behind, sitting on their other side.
With the smallest act of revolt, Draco weaved his fingers through Harry’s, gripping his hand tightly. Harry squeezed his fingers. (Draco didn’t exactly know what to do. His parents had raised him. They’d cared for him, provided for him. His mother had always been there for him, loving him and doing her best to understand him when his father couldn’t. Which was often. But Harry—Harry had listened to him from the moment they’d met. He’d always tried his best to understand. Even when they’d argued and fought, he hadn’t once shut him down or told him that his feelings were stupid or invalid. Harry had supported him. He’d held his hand through thick and thin, a smile just around the corner. Draco couldn’t say the same for his father)
Draco’s fingers were digging into Harry’s shoulders, like he was afraid he would float away if he didn’t hold on tight enough. Harry’s mouth traveled down to Draco’s neck, where he seemed to switch gears and started leaving butterfly kisses across his shoulders and collar bones. The blond boy could hear his own heavy breathing, only consoled by the fact that Harry’s was just as uneven and labored. He quivered when Harry kissed under his ear, his tongue then tracing the shell.
And he could. He could be strong for Harry. After everything, Draco would gladly be strong for the boy who had stuck with him. For the boy who loved him, the boy who’d listened and taken care of him, the boy who hadn’t hesitated to rescue him. Draco would be strong for him.
The only response Draco could make was an acknowledging grunt in the back of his throat, Harry was kissing him again, and it was impossible to even
Draco thought. The heat had spread from his face to his ears and chest—it should have been impossible to feel that flushed. Swallowing thickly past the lump in his throat, he tried again. He had to force the words out, if quietly. “What do you think about h-having sex with me?”
Gently, Harry removed Draco’s arms and turned to his locker, leaving Draco slightly puzzled for a moment. Then Harry quickly pulled on his briefs under the towel he wore before whisking it off and sitting on the bench next to Draco.
was what Harry had to endure. This was his
“Really?” Draco blurted, his voice rising with each word, his fingers curled into fists. “You didn’t appear very uncomfortable to me, Harry! You seemed just fine, chatting it up with your ex-boyfriend while I was sitting
When he spoke, Harry’s voice was thick and low. “I’ll be back in a minute.” He released both Hermione and Draco’s hands and moved to stand. Every muscle in his body was stiffened, his fists were clenched. He looked ready for a fight.
Also, sushi. He’d had it once, a few years ago, and absolutely loved it.
Hermione looked at him with a critical gaze, her eyes skeptical and her lips pursed. “I’m alright.” Her mouth twisted in a wry grin, and Harry knew that she was out for blood. “How’s Cho doing, Cedric?” She shot a glance at Harry, making sure that he was alright with this direction of the conversation.
Looking deep into Harry’s beautiful green eyes, finding a vulnerable spark inside, Draco said, “Harry Potter, I
Lucius had cut him off, speaking to Iris. “Draco will be attending London Business School after he graduates. I’ve tried to secure him a spot in both Cambridge and Oxford, but he hasn’t taken the right classes in Hogwarts, and his grades simply aren’t high enough. They wouldn’t have him.”
But it wouldn’t do him any good to mope around and brood simply because Draco had left for a few days.
They had arrived at Draco’s common room door. Draco didn’t want Harry to leave, he wanted for him to say more about how he loved spending time with Draco, more about how he wanted to do this again, more about how he couldn’t bear to cut the day short.
had been. Sirius had
“Alright, get a room you two,” Pansy taunted.
“Um…” Harry saw some of Draco’s uneasiness start to melt away as he got talking, he was settling more comfortably in his chair, and the smile on his face practically shone. “Mostly just pencil and paper because they’re convenient, but I like using paint and other things when I can.”
just let him say—”
“I love you too, sweetheart.” Draco teasingly blew him a kiss, memorizing Harry’s smile, before they hung up.
“Oh yeah?” Katie stood up, smirking at him. “Let’s see how happy you are after
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed,” Hermione quipped, “but the power is out, and I couldn’t exactly lift Harry by myself when he weighs
“Can you keep a secret? Like, you can’t even tell your friends, because Hermione would kill me if she knew I told anyone,” Harry said, his voice had turned more serious, his eyes beseeching.
Even though Harry wasn’t the same thirteen-year-old boy that he’d been when he first met Sirius, the feeling of complete safety in his arms had never faded. Though he wasn’t as naive and helpless as he had been, Sirius always embodied what Harry thought of as
were the selfless one in this relationship.”
“Sunshine? Really?” Draco asked, allowing his amusement to sneak into his soft words. “
The professor’s eyes glared down at Harry as he sneered, “You would be best suited to learn to hold your tongue in my class, Mr. Potter.”
Draco looked up to see Harry’s gaze switching between him and the road.
“You scared the hell outta me,” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, realizing that they were still in the library. Draco only buried himself further into Harry’s body as an apology instead. The shorter boy felt him pressing a kiss to his temple, his hair, there was a kiss on his cheek, and a hand playing with the hair at the nape of his neck.
“I swear,” Tonks said, passing the baby girl to him, “you get bigger every time I see you.” Astrid immediately raised her small hand to explore Harry’s face—nearly poking his eye out, but he only laughed and held her closer while also trying to make sure Teddy was secure. Harry was absolutely mesmerized by Astrid—how she could simultaneously be
Draco ignored the hesitancy flourishing in his heart and walked over; he climbed into Harry’s lap and curled up in his arms. He could have sobbed when Harry wound his strong arms around him, leaning back against the wall to support both their weights. He felt so unworthy of the warm comfort Harry offered. His heart ached and throbbed and his soul felt utterly wrecked, but it eased when Harry kissed his hair and then fit Draco’s head under his chin.
Draco followed Harry into the common room and into Harry’s dorm, where the bigger boy stashed his gym bag under his bed. And then promptly flopped onto said bed, an arm thrown over his face, the other reaching for Draco; who then hastily took Harry’s hand and crawled across the sheets-which were nowhere near as silky as Draco’s own-to curl into the bigger boy’s body, trying to absorb the heat he always seemed to emanate. Those green eyes were only inches, if that, from his own, hooded and heavy and exhausted. Everything smelled like Harry, Draco was swimming, drowning in his scent, an intoxicating combination of peppermint, orange, and vanilla.
“I think curfew is in about half an hour, love,” Draco said. His soft words seemed too loud for the peaceful quiet that had settled over them, but he didn’t want to risk either of them getting detention. They’d been lucky so far, but the thought of that night Harry had gotten caught by Snape made taking the chance hard.
He’d thought the hardest part would be walking away from Harry and getting in the car. But as Draco’s father started the engine, he watched as Harry’s face gradually fell, his whole body seemed to droop. Every part of his body was screaming at him, aching to get out and hold him. Before he could even think about it, Draco’s father had started driving away, leaving Harry in the dust—along with half of Draco’s throbbing heart.
“I really shouldn’t have even told you anything, Draco,” she whispered, “It’s for him to tell you, it’s his business.”
Snuffles couldn’t seem to decide which was more important—licking every inch of Harry’s face, or trying to tackle him. Sirius laughed behind him as the dog finally seemed to decide that doing both was the way to go. His forelegs came around Harry’s shoulders, his panting, warm breath fanning over his face while his tongue frantically licked him all over.
Harry seemed to hesitate. “Maybe after.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered into his skin, “please just… Just tell me what to do, Harry.” He dug his fingers into Harry’s skin, trying to repress the pressure building behind his closed eyes. “I don’t know how to make this better, Harry. I don’t know what to do.” Draco’s shoulders trembled, but he refused to let himself fall apart completely when his intention had been to help
Looking at Draco now, as they walked through the glass doors, Harry saw uncertainty and anxiety beneath the confident exterior he had plastered on his face. Harry squeezed his hand reassuringly as he spotted both Sirius and Remus. They both sat at a table in the corner by the window—Remus red-faced and clearly holding back laughter while Sirius waved them over as soon as he saw them.
Not a word had been spoken to Draco himself. Iris and Lucius had just sat there, planning out his entire future before him. He hadn’t even gotten the chance to tell his father that the last thing he wanted to do was study business and take over his stupid company. He didn’t even know what Lucius’ company
However, he felt a little bad about slinging his boyfriend over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes; there’s no way it was comfortable. So, Harry shifted him around, practically manhandled him, until he was carrying Draco bridal-style.
Harry parted Draco’s lips with his tongue, slipping inside, sweeping across his own tongue almost lazily, like he had all the time in the world to explore every inch of him. A keening sound escaped from the back of Draco’s throat, but he didn’t care. He just wanted Harry closer, wanted him flush against his skin. Harry’s hands moved from his face to his hips. His fingers trailed underneath Draco’s shirt, running over his stomach, moving along his skin, leaving a trail of fire in their wake. Heat curled and writhed in the pit of Draco’s stomach. His head was spinning; the smell of Harry, the taste of him, the feeling of his hands on his skin, it all swirled together, making him dizzy.
Cutting off his own floundering, Harry leaned forward to press his lips to Draco’s in a warm, soft, lingering kiss.
“That doesn’t change the fact that I’m about to meet Sirius, and I have a hickey on my neck!”
Her eyes were puffy from tears, the tear-tracks still on her face. “It’s so stupid,” she whispered, her voice rough and cracking, “It’s so
Standing in front of him was Ronald Weasley, red hair and all. When Draco closed the door behind him, he noticed that the youngest Weasley boy was without a certain rotten girlfriend. He also noticed that Ron was making his way to enter the room he had just exited.
“Would you rather me get right to the point?”
“Dray,” Harry reluctantly whispered in his boyfriend’s ear, gently shaking his shoulder, “Dray, baby, we’ve gotta get going, my love.”
He fought off the apprehension burrowing in his bones. Slowly, Draco reached out a trembling hand to pull the large door open. But just before his fingertips touched, Harry gripped his hand and pulled it to his chest. Draco’s fingers instantly gripped his worn t-shirt like he was holding on for support.
not Harry. It was too old, too nasally, too menacing, to be that of his boyfriend.
This seemed to brighten their moods the smallest bit. They all gave him the same somber smile, and nodded at him, giving him permission to leave. Harry turned to go through the door, but just as his fingers touched the doorknob, Angelina exclaimed, “Draco’s waiting for you outside.”
The world seemed to freeze for a minute while Harry just
“Yes, yes, the food is on its way.”
Draco dragged his tongue over every inch of Harry’s mouth, inside and out, sucked on his tongue, nibbled at his bottom lip—all to extract that
“Hey.” Pansy poked his shoulder from beside him. “Did something happen after I left? Theo looked about ready to wring someone’s neck when you guys walked in.”
Harry pulled away first, kissing Draco’s forehead before turning back to his locker to grab a t-shirt. “Didn’t I tell you I would meet you at your common room?”
Thank you all so much for reading!! Remember, comments give me life and help me breathe, so you may as well leave one. Love you all! <3<3<3
Had he finally become too much of a failure for him? Had the anxiety in the back of his mind finally become a reality? Had he finally said too much, revealed too many ugly truths?
He’d gone into overdrive, his senses taking over him. Draco had no idea how much Harry had paid for everything, he’d been too busy fantasizing about using all his new products every morning.
“Harry?”
But then it went dark.
He felt Harry’s smile against his cheek. “You can be clingy all you like.”
Draco could only think of three redeemable things about his mother’s party.
“Do you really hate not knowing where we’re going?” Harry inquired, concerned that he may have crossed a line despite Draco having had said he was fine with it. He tried to catch Draco’s eye with his own, but the blond ducked his head as a flush crept up his neck at being caught. Harry smirked.
The feelings of unrest and fear began to ebb away.
But then he’d come to Hogwarts, and everything was so much different. Everyone told Harry how amazing his parents had been; his father was a bit of a rebel, always living in the grey area and causing mischief in his wake. And then James had fallen for Lily, the straight-A student who was kind to everyone. He was told of how in love they were, how they were perfect for each other in every way. Professor McGonagall had told him that after they graduated, his father worked with the government, and his mother had been attending medical school to become a nurse—until they’d had Harry and she’d had to put her studies on hold to take care of him.
It had all gone sour at a party after a football game Harry’s team had won last school year. Harry and Ginny had both had too much to drink. The morning after hadn’t been very pleasant for either of them. Ginny had decided that she didn’t want a relationship that had begun with sex, so that had been it. It hadn’t mattered that Harry had wanted to try for a real relationship. It hadn’t mattered that Harry was sure that they could’ve loved each other and made it work. Ginny had said no, and Harry wouldn’t ever push her into something she didn’t want.
Draco could tell from Snape’s tone that he wasn’t the least bit convinced. “Is that so, Potter? No, I don’t think so.”
Draco’s mind slowly calmed down. He stood there for a minute, trying to find the right words to say, to ask what he wanted to know. He wanted to know everything there was to be found, he wanted to know the very essence of Harry’s soul, wanted to be the one who knew him better than anyone else. Luckily for him, Harry seemed to sense this shift in his mood.
“I promise.”
Hermione had been self-conscious about the color of her skin for weeks afterward until Dean had finally managed to show her that she should be proud of her black skin, that she was beautiful in every shade.
on a date.
“You all were great out there,” he started, his voice was steadier than he thought it would be,
Draco nodded with a smile on his lips as well.
The nightmare had still come for him.
It was Draco walking Harry backward until the taller boy was sitting on a bench, barely breaking the kiss before he straddled Harry’s hips and sat on his lap.
Theo, come check this out!”
“Harry, my boy,” Sirius said, sounding a little uncomfortable and yet also amused, “I can’t say I expected to see you here. During school hours, no less.”
Harry just smirked at him, “Hey back, stranger.”
“Just sore,” Harry answered. “And exhausted.” The bed dipped, and Harry assumed that Hermione had sat down next to him and Draco. Her hand settled on his knee, her thumb drawing circles over his sweatpants.
With a pointed look at her once again pinging phone, Harry quipped, “Your phone begs to differ, Pansy dearest.”
Harry was alone in the steamy locker room when he heard the door open. A pair of soft, familiar footsteps followed before the door closed again, slowly coming closer. A knowing grin spread on his lips. Yet, he continued shuffling through clothes in his locker, trying to find a clean shirt.
It was in.
Harry smiled and pressed his lips to Draco’s own. “She didn’t want to fall asleep here, she went back to her dorm.”
The room was spinning. Or maybe it was Draco. He couldn’t really tell. He knew he was a lightweight, so he hadn’t drunk nearly as much as Harry—they were both just slightly past the tipsy stage. The music sounded fuzzy, the bodies dancing around them were just slightly blurry. But that might’ve just been his lack of focus. Or caring.
Draco didn’t know how long it was, but he didn’t mind. Pansy needed him, needed
—in an empty corridor that every single light in the common room flickered out, leaving the room nearly pitch black. With the common room being on one of the basement levels, there were no windows to offer any light.
“Yes.” Draco dug his fingers into Harry’s back, careful to avoid his scars. He would kiss up and down each of those later. “Yes, I want this. Do you?”
Draco swayed his hips to the beat of the music with Harry behind him, his broad hands on the smaller boy’s hips. A carefree grin spread across his face as Harry dragged his lips up from his neck to his ear. Giggles erupted from his mouth, because, goddammit, his breath

“Love you too,” Harry answered.
Looking back up at Harry, Pansy scoffed, eyes flashing, “Damn
“Absolutely not.”
“Uh—no, no of course not.” Ronald seemed to grimace at himself. “I just… I wanted to apologize to you. I’m sorry for saying that Harry didn’t need you. For being an ass to you when I had no right to be.”
Harry shook his head at the other boy before walking in and gently setting the blond boy in his bed, tucking in the blankets before kissing his forehead and whispering, “Goodnight, sweetheart.” Harry didn’t expect any reply, having assumed his boyfriend was too deep in sleep to even hear him.
“Wow, thanks. That makes me feel
“Alright, alright,” Sirius took a step back, looking over his shoulder to glance at another man approaching them. He was tall, thin, and had a thin face with sallow, pale skin and tired green eyes, greying brown hair, and a scar cutting across his left eyebrow. “You can meet us inside when you’re, um… ready.”
Grinning, Theo stepped to Harry and gripped his hand, pulling him into a loose embrace. “I’ll see you, man.” With a pat to the back and a crooked grin on his face, Harry pulled away from his unexpected friend. Theo had been the one who’d taken the most time to warm up to Harry—now he was part of his team, his friend.
scared. So scared that something would happen and he would have to enter
“Harry,” Neville said from behind him, “are you completely insane?”
he’d let something as simple and humiliating as
Cedric only neatly scooted nearer to Harry in return, somehow making it look completely natural. His leg pressed into Harry’s thigh, Cedric’s hand was approaching his on the table. Harry’s stomach plummeted.
He didn’t exactly recall what happened next, but the next thing Draco knew his shirt was gone, tossed somewhere off the bed, he was straddling Harry’s legs, and his mouth was pressed so tightly to Harry’s own that he could feel his teeth through their mashed lips and clashing tongues. The kiss was messy, messier than any kiss they’d shared. Harry’s hands felt like they were everywhere at once, Draco’s head was whirling with every heady sensation.
“Real tactful, Potter.”
Harry thought. This certainly hadn’t been Harry’s first time dealing with someone not being who they seemed, but this time felt different, for some reason. His chest ached with heaviness, his eyes constantly seemed fixed on finding that blond head of hair in the crowd, and his head was constantly filled with the memory of his lemon-scented shampoo, his cold, smooth skin, and the way his face flushed whenever Harry smiled at him.
Humming in response, Harry then asked, “What about you? What has my gorgeous, heart-sick boyfriend been up to today?”
, Harry.”
“What do you mean, Hermione?” he asked. She made it sound like something was something inherently
“You remember the horror stories from that old gang, the Death Eaters?” Draco nodded, already dreading where this was going. “The Halloween after I turned one, their leader, Tom Riddle, broke into the house we were living in, in Godric’s Hollow. The reports say that he killed my father first. They say that my mother had run upstairs to my nursery, apparently, she had a gun with her. So when Riddle got to my room, he shot mum and she shot him a second later. They say that she was trying to protect me. The rest of the gang had waited outside—and fled when the police got there. A neighbor had called because of the noise.”
. Draco couldn’t stand the thought of anyone else, Cedric Diggory included, touching Harry. Kissing him. Loving him. He didn’t want anyone else curled up in bed with him, or laying their head on his broad shoulders. Draco didn’t want anyone else, either. He didn’t want anyone but Harry running their hands through his hair, or holding his hand, or watching him draw. He didn’t want anyone else.
This had been a recurring thing throughout his entire life. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon—Harry’s relatives that had raised him, with his cousin Dudley, for the first thirteen years of his life—had drilled into him how horrible James and Lily had been, how they were good-for-nothing wastes of space. Harry had always had to keep his doubts about this to himself. Any outward rebuttal of their judgments was not met kindly. His disbelief had been held in for so many years, it had become twisted and ferocious, a new concoction of rage and grief that drove him to tears at the thought of what his life might have been like if they’d lived to raise him themselves.
with him in the halls?” Harry asked, “Because if you’re not okay with it, even a little bit-” Hermione stopped him with a simple raise of her brow. “Harry, I do think that he meant what he said. It’ll take some getting used to, seeing my best friend with a boy I’ve hated for so long. But I think, I think that I’m okay with it,” she paused, her lips twisting in a conspiratorial smile, “Just don’t tell him that. I think I’m looking forward to seeing how long he’ll grovel at my feet for.”
Hermione turned a shaky smile in the blond boy’s direction. Draco suddenly felt like less of an intruder. He felt like he might’ve actually been helping her, instead of just observing. She looked back at Harry when he began to speak again. Suspicion passed over his face, shadowing his eyes and tensing his jaw.
and you didn’t deserve
Draco nodded and took his hand, leading him to the couch. But before he had the chance to sit down, his phone rang in Pansy’s hand.
“I would really love to be your boyfriend, Harry. And I would really love it if you were mine.”
But he couldn’t stand to ruin the moment by pushing Harry even further. He was satisfied for now.
“Do Ron and Hermione know?” Draco whispered into his hair.
The bell rang for the end of lunch.
“Remember that we have practice every day this week, except for Wednesday,” Hooch said, her piercing eyes scanning over her lineup of football players. “Final game is on Friday, and I expect all of you to be playing just as well as you were today. Better, if you all can manage it.” A few snickers, most likely from Fred and George, broke the serious atmosphere that had begun to settle over them. Both Harry and Hooch rolled their eyes—only Harry’s didn’t carry nearly as much annoyance.
If I'm being honest with y'all, I kind of just... gave up a little at the end, so it's not nearly as good as I'd wanted it to be, but I wanted to get this chapter updated asap. Anyway, leave me a comment! I love hearing from all my readers! *like seriously please do they make me so happy* Lots of love to everyone out there!
“I dunno, I’m kinda used to being up so late. And I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable or anything while you were sleeping.”
Harry’s smile softened. “Thank you for apologizing to Hermione. You have no idea how much it meant to her, to both of us.”
Over his boyfriend’s head, Harry noticed Mrs. Malfoy walking down the driveway towards them with her hair pulled up in a messy bun atop her head, dressed in a green t-shirt and black leggings. She dragged Draco’s luggage behind her, his duffle bag slung over her shoulder. She looked… devastated. Her eyes were locked on Harry, but this time, her eyes were missing the calculating glint.
“Hey,” Harry interrupted, taking Draco’s jaw in his hand. Those grey eyes seemed to flicker in the fluorescent bathroom lights. “Baby, no. It doesn’t matter to me that you’re a virgin, or that you might not know what to do. It doesn’t make me think any differently of you. That’s why we need to communicate with each other about what we need, or what we want.” A smile pulled at the corners of Harry’s lips. “It’s okay if we go slow, my love.”
“You’re impossible. Incorrigible, really.”
“Tomorrow around noon. And before you ask, no, I don’t know what we’re doing, he said it’s a surprise.” Just as he finished, Theo snatched at Draco’s hands, lifting them up for the other two to see.
“—the skinniest little thing you ever saw, I swear it!” she laughed.
It was during Pansy’s long, bitter retelling of the rumors she’d heard and walking in on Terry and Cho Chang—Draco wondered why it always had to be
The boy on the tile floor didn’t get the chance to respond. His stomach muscles convulsed, and his head pounded painfully as his stomach continued its nearly violent revolt. His abdomen ached. The skin on his back felt sore with the stain of his dream.
from him) Conversation between Theo and Blaise sputtered out, and he could feel Draco’s attention shift away from his papers.
, they’re
“We’ll have to wrap these first.”
By the time Harry got back to the common room with a basket of Hermione’s favorite foods, Hermione was still curled together on the couch, her back facing the door where Harry had entered. He rushed to her side and knelt by the couch, gently taking her shoulder and turning her to face him.
Draco hadn’t touched this particular case in months. He’d hidden it under his bed, there was a slight film of dust on it. But on this particular day, he’d finally felt that familiar spark in his hands, finally felt some form of inspiration.
Then the phone clicked, and the call ended.
Harry carried him through the common room, receiving many glances, some calculating, some amused, others slightly concerned. Harry walked past them all, giving Hermione a nod as he passed. He could practically feel the smirk she tossed Draco behind him. Harry walked out the door.
No one said anything in reply. Ron’s chin tucked to his chest like he had sensed the sudden change in the atmosphere. His hands shifted in his pockets. Harry saw his thin shoulders tense, his straight nose crinkled.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
The lungs in Draco’s chest were suddenly working double-time, his breaths coming in so fast that his head felt slightly dizzy. Somehow he managed to look over at Pansy as if asking for her permission to go. She nodded and waved him away like she would to shoo a bug.
He reached Draco’s common room door and- taking a deep breath- knocked. It opened almost instantaneously, and Harry was met with none other than Pansy Parkinson and her assessing gaze. Harry smiled, having expected no less.
The memories of that day had narrowed down to those few moments. The way Lucius had looked at him with such disdain, the slight smile on Mrs. Malfoy’s face. Watching Draco get in the car and drive away.
How would he explain to her how those words had tasted on his tongue? How could he make her see that he had hated himself for weeks after they had passed the threshold of his lips? How could he explain to her that he thought the deep, rich brown color of her skin was beautiful in every way?
“I love you, Harry,” Draco murmured. “You have no idea how in love with you I am. I’m here for you. I want to know everything there is to know, but it’s okay if you need time. I’ll wait.”
He knew they were right, but it didn’t make Harry any less disappointed that he had to leave.
“You really like this boy, don’t you?” Narcissa asked. Her delicate fingers swept away a few strands of Draco’s hair that had fallen out of place. “From what you’ve told me, Harry sounds wonderful.”
“Are you ready to go?”
“Shouldn’t we move him somewhere quiet?” Draco asked. Slowly reaching forward, he placed his hand over the one Harry had fisted in his hair, gently trying to disentangle his fingers. He winced at the fearful whine that came from Harry’s lips. “Or with some light?”
. And homework. And then more sleep.”
Shock slapped Harry in the face. He hesitated before carefully bringing his arms around her back. He had to hunch over so she could reach his neck comfortably, but he didn’t mind. Her warmth was a kind that he seldom felt—the kind that could only be found in a mother. The closest thing he’d ever had to one was Tonks, and even then it was a stretch. Narcissa simply emanated motherly warmth, and Harry was tentative in accepting it.
Regardless of that, though, the game had consistently stayed head-to-head, neither team with an advantage over the other and a tied score. There were only two minutes left in the game, and Draco could practically feel the frustration from both teams, the desperation to make
He’d tried not to.
“Hmm…” Hermione remained attached to his hip even as they turned into a less crowded corridor on their way to their common room. “Maybe you should ask Sirius this weekend.”
Every instinct in Harry’s body was at war with one another, some telling him to run, others urging him to turn and punch the red-headed dimwit in the jaw. Neither sounded like it would do him any good in the long run. He felt more than saw his friends stop walking, felt their silence fall around him. He felt Hermione’s presence appear at his side, calming and unwavering; felt Draco squeeze his hand before he turned to look at the person he hadn’t talked to in months. The person he’d called his friend.
“You don’t think you can trust him to uphold it after what he did the last time,” Remus finished, taking a long drink of his coffee. Harry nodded and did the same, smiling to himself when he realized that Draco had already taken most of it.
mother
Harry’s grin was beaming, even as he teased, “Are you saying that you’re embarrassed to be seen with me?”
“Oh, come on, kitten, you know I didn’t mean it.”
The captain turned away from the door, opting for the back exit instead. He felt awful, of course, leaving his boyfriend out there waiting for him. He never wanted to make Draco feel unwanted, undesirable, rejected. But he couldn’t make himself go through that door.
Seeing this through heavy-lidded eyes, Harry mumbled, “Was too hot, you were taking too long.” Reaching out, he grabbed one of Draco’s hands and drew him closer, his sleepy smile more than enough to draw Draco in. But, before Draco could even touch the sheets, Harry’s hand had moved to the hem of Draco’s shirt, fiddling with it. The smaller boy recognized it for the request it was.
that person. No one else had, either. He wouldn’t let something so small as an apology from a boy he didn’t like bring the monster back out.
his voice was forceful even though he spoke softly, “You’ll just get in trouble, Dray. That doesn’t benefit anyone. He’s not going to let me off the hook just because you were involved, sweetheart. Promise me you won’t talk to him tomorrow.”
of crap to sort through. But I feel so much better now. If a little drained.”
“Didn’t you say you had a godfather? Who helped you buy your car?”
Huffing a laugh, Harry swept a kiss to Draco’s sharp cheekbone. “You know, deep confessions of undying love like that aren’t usually meant to be made in crowded corridors, kitten.”
Pansy stepped in front of him, a sympathetic gleam in her dark eyes. “Just go and talk to him, yeah? Figure all your stuff out.”
But he also knew that Draco hadn’t eaten this morning, and was probably starving, even if he refused to acknowledge it. Harry had noticed that about Draco, that every once in awhile, he would skip meals and act like he was perfectly fine. Just as he opened his lips to say so, Blaise interrupted him.
In the photo, Harry had tears in his eyes and a smile so bright it was blinding even through the screen. Behind Harry with his hands on Harry’s shoulders was a man with shoulder-length, messy black hair. His face was ever so slightly wrinkled with his grin, his body was thin, and his eyes were shining as he looked down at Astrid.
had been nothing more than the fact that Terry Boot asked her to lunch and she didn’t know what to wear. He’d been dragged away from Harry because Pansy hadn’t known what to
Embarrassment crept up Harry’s neck. His skin flushed, and though the color of his skin was just dark enough to hide it, he still felt the blood rushing to his face and neck. But Draco seemed to sense this and tightened his fingers on Harry’s jaw, preventing him from pulling away. His grey eyes flashed, warning the other boy not to fight him on this.
Because standing outside the car, with a roguish, laughing smirk on his face, was Sirius Black.
It seemed that the fact that Hogwarts had really won the cup had finally settled in for everyone. The party that the Weasley twins had in fact thrown was even bigger than the previous one, spilling into the corridor and deafening in how loud it was. But it was all worth it, if only for the light in Harry’s eyes.
“Harry?”
“Harry?” The boy looked up at hearing his name, only to see Fred and George Weasley standing in the doorway. “Coach is looking for you. The game is supposed to start any minute now.”
“I love you,” Harry suddenly blurted. “I am so
day.”
He knew that Harry wasn’t white, at least from what he could tell. “Harry... is it… is it okay if I ask you what your ethnicity is?”
“Go crazy,” Harry said.
Draco hadn’t anticipated the feel of Harry’s hand on his wrist. He hadn’t anticipated how it would feel to have any part of his body so close to Harry’s lips, the warmth of his breath on his skin. He hadn’t prepared for the way Harry’s eyes darkened
“What about Harry?” Theo asked from behind him. There was a prevalent sort of worry in his voice, making his words tremble.
A rumbling hum came from the deepest part of Harry’s chest. His head tilted back of its own volition, his eyes fluttered closed. Those dainty hands explored Harry’s abdomen, back, and chest with light touches before pale arms wrapped around his hips.
“The bag isn’t supposed to move.” Harry took Draco’s thumb out of his fist. “And you’ll break your thumb that way. Make sure to keep tension here,” he patted Draco’s abdomen, “and make sure you aren’t leaning forward too much. Balance is key, keep your weight evenly distributed. Try and imagine that you’re hitting the center of the bag, or that your fist is going through it.”
If possible, Lucius’ glower became even more disapproving.
Harry set up the shot in one. Draco rose to the tips of his toes and clenched his hands in the jersey he wore.
Harry had no plans to respond to Draco’s message.
“O! Potter!”
The other boy tilted his head in confusion, “For what? I only told you what’s true, sweetheart.”
The tension in the air was so thick he could have cut through it with his hand. Draco’s fingers tightened on Harry’s, attempting to nonverbally beg him to back down, just this once. Luckily, his boyfriend seemed to get the message.
Focusing on taking deep even breaths, Harry sat down on the bed. He leaned his back against the wall, watching as Draco crawled onto the mattress and sat across from him. His grey eyes were soft and assessing. He looked at him the way a doctor would look at a young patient.
The second was the fact that he finally got to take his favorite suit of his closet and wear it. It was perfectly tailored to every inch of him, and Draco was completely okay with admitting to himself that he looked
Harry saw the laughter coming before it burst from Sirius’ mouth. “Just call me Sirius, please.” Letting go of Draco’s hand, the man looked back at Harry. “What nonsense have you been telling this poor boy that he thinks he needs to call me
“It’s Harry.”
“Go, go talk to Malfoy. I’ll find Ron.” Hermione gently shoved him towards the door, wiping her face with her other hand. Harry nodded, watching her walk away for a moment before going back outside to the corridor, where Draco was waiting.
Harry’s chest moved with heaving breaths, his hands fisted in his hair. His jaw was clenched so tightly he was sure his teeth would crack. His stomach twisted, he felt as though he was going to be sick. Tears pricked behind his eyes, but he refused to let them fall.
With a pat on Harry’s shoulder, she turned and walked up the stairs.
want something different.”
From there, the time seemed to fly. Harry vaguely remembered Remus and Sirius asking Draco questions about different pictures they looked at, could scarcely recall his boyfriend answering them. He knew that at some point the conversation had shifted to Draco’s family, then to Harry’s sudden growth spurt—which Sirius had gotten quite worked up about, lamenting about how he and Harry agreed years ago that he would stop growing—until somehow they’d gotten to talking and laughing about Remus’ kids.
With some miraculous surge of strength, Draco forced himself to open the door. Darkness greeted him—the sun having set minutes ago—along with the frightened mumbling of the people in the common room, a few of them holding flashlights. Wading through the crowd, Draco heard the telltale sounds of muffled cries.
Icy, soft hands suddenly trailed across the skin at Harry’s hips, just at the hem of his shorts. That, combined with the cool breath fanning across his shoulder, made him shiver as goosebumps flowered across his skin. A familiar pair of silky lips pressed a delicate kiss between Harry’s shoulder blades. Both relief and excitement poured in through every pore in his body, flooding his every sense.
(See the end of the chapter for
a few days. Surely you should’ve been fine.”
he mused,
Looking at a drowsy Harry, suddenly regretting the words that had just come out of his mouth, he replied:
Harry turned back to the table behind him, where Neville’s beaker was smoking an almost orange color, which definitely shouldn’t have been happening. Neville looked as frustrated as ever, staring down at the instructions on his paper with his hands in his hair. “Here, Neville, you just have to add this to the beaker, it’ll cancel out whatever it is you did wrong,” Harry said softly, with a look that told Neville he was sorry for almost setting Snape on him. He handed Neville a small vial full of opaque grey liquid.
Draco had told him a few days ago that his mother’s birthday would be on the twenty-fourth of this month—this upcoming Tuesday—and that his parents would be coming the day beforehand to take him out of school for a few days. Draco had told him about the party that was sure to occur, filled with the relatives his parents were on good terms with and his parents’ friends—none of which he was too fond of or excited to see. Draco had explained how it was draining just to be in their presence, constantly having to pretend to be the boy they expected.
“Alright, you’d better be getting back to school.” A sort of melancholy wistfulness passed over Sirius’ eyes—the same melancholy wistfulness that clenched around Harry’s heart every time he had to say goodbye. Tugging him into another hug, Sirius said, “I’ll see you soon, okay? I love you, Harry.”
“Ow!” Draco whisper-yelled, trying to keep the Professor from hearing them, “Pansy, what the bloody hell was that for?”
Now, as he fell asleep, Hermione took a moment to smile at how far he had come. She was glad that he was still able to let her in, to come to her. Harry’s breathing evened out, and Hermione settled down into the pillows to take a nap as well, her head on top of Harry’s.
And then there was a shout from behind them, echoing off the corridor walls.
Harry didn’t even have the energy to lift his head to look at the other boy, instead choosing to set his forehead against his arm. His throat was raw, his breathing ragged and difficult. In his peripheral vision, he saw Draco kneel down beside him, setting a tall glass of water on the tile floor. He reached a pale hand over Harry and pulled the lever on the toilet.
“That was one hell of a shot at the end,” the other player replied, gripping Harry’s hand. His brown eyes flicked over to Draco and his eyebrow quirked upward. It wasn’t exactly a friendly look. He looked back at Harry. “Pity it wasn’t more of a win.”
“Pretty,” was Teddy’s only response, dazed and distracted—by Draco, apparently. Loud, snorting laughter burst out of Harry’s mouth. Just watching him laugh made Draco crack a wide grin and let out a chuckle. It seemed that Teddy didn’t seem to mind, though.
I hope that you guys liked this! As always, constructive criticism, comments, kudos, etc. are always welcome and soo appreciated! Thanks so much for reading!
look. “Some pretty shitty stuff went down with his father, and he called me in the middle of the night because he needed me to pick him up. So, I hauled ass to get there, but by the time we got back to my dorm and fell asleep, it was probably around three in the morning.”
“That,” Harry said, lifting the first of the weights onto the bar, “and a hand putting the weights on the other side of the bar.”
That seemed to finally reach Harry. Hitting the bag one last time, softer than the others, his hands dropped to his sides. His broad shoulders heaved with labored breaths as he ran a cloth-wrapped hand through his hair and down his face as he turned to look at Draco.
They arrived at the garage, and Harry grazed Draco’s elbow to guide him toward the row his car was parked in. “Which one is yours?” Draco asked.
Draco’s brow furrowed in bewilderment until the door opened and a familiar voice said, “Just so we’re clear, Harry, I’m only doing this because I know you’re exhausted.” Draco looked over his shoulder to see Hermione, holding a basket, an amused smile plastered on her face despite her words. “Draco, nice to see that you’ve finished your complaining over not seeing Harry.” Draco returned with a playful glare, huffing at her.
So Draco cuddled as close as he possibly could into Harry’s body, letting his breath and his heartbeat fall into sync with his boyfriend’s. Closing his eyes, Draco settled down to sleep for as long as he could.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m coming,” Harry murmured, standing and walking behind the twins out to the field. When Coach Hooch saw him, she gave him a knowing smile and a pat on the back.
Harry almost couldn’t feel anything.
Alarm rushed through Draco’s veins and guilt tore viciously at his insides.
Draco had never felt so warm than he did when Harry clutched him to his chest and wrapped his arms around the smaller blond. Draco wound his arms around the other boy’s body, trying to take in all the heat from his body. He could feel Harry’s heart beating in his chest, he could hear it, he felt his chest moving with heavy and almost laborious breaths.
There was more than one moment that he wished Hermione had been there—she hated missing these kinds of things, and she and Remus got along like wildfire—but he was happy.

“I know.”
“Harry,” he whispered, “can you hear me? It’s Draco, sweetheart.” Draco licked his lips before continuing. “You’re safe, my love. You’re in your dorm room, with me and Hermione. I love you so much, Harry. I need you to take deep breaths, just like I am, okay? Deep, even breaths.” Pausing, Draco moved one of his hands so it covered Harry’s, the one grasping at his chest. “I know it’s dark right now, I’m sure the fire alarms scared you, but you’re okay. Just breathe with me, alright? You’re safe, I promise, sunshine.”
“Do I
Sirius had parked his jet-black car in the cul de sac driveway in front of the academy; he stood leaning against the driver-side door. Just seeing his godfather made Harry feel instantly more relaxed. A small, sad smile appeared on Sirius’ face, just as Harry felt the tears building behind his eyes. It was like his own dam cracked and broke free, the pressure too much for it to hold.
And there stood the last thing Draco had expected to see: Ron Weasley, panting like he’d been running and holding a flashlight.
Draco leaned over the console and planted a kiss on Harry’s cheek. Harry swiftly glanced at him and squeezed his hand.
“Of course. Once he graduates university, he’ll start training with me.”
But then again, Draco loved him. He’d said so himself, with his own lips and his own words, he’d said it in the way that he kissed him, with so much passion and conviction it made Harry’s heart pound. He was saying it in the way that he took every detail from the scene in front of him and transferred it to his paper, in the way that his eyes lingered on Harry even as he drew.
“Where are you going?” he whined, dragging his nose up the column of Harry’s neck, kissing behind his ear. Draco’s fingers dug into the muscle on his chest, his lips moved from his ear to reach around to his face.
And just then, the sleeping boy curled more into Harry’s side, grabbing onto his arm and pressing his side into Harry’s. His ribs were pressed into the armrest, so Harry slowly used his right arm to lift it back up so that the blonde could be more comfortable. His fingers curled around Harry’s arm were cold, seemingly sucking out Harry’s heat, but he didn’t mind. The blonde cuddled so tightly to Harry that there was almost no space between their bodies, and Harry looked over at the shriveled hag a seat over. Her eyes were so squinted with disgust, Harry found it nearly hilarious, (if he had known this blond boy, if they had been boyfriends, Harry would have kissed him senseless just to see how far her face could squint into itself) Harry sent a smirk over the boy’s head. He settled in to watch a movie on his cell and smell the blond’s hair, moving as little as possible.
Hermione followed behind him, her eyes scanning the hallway before landing on Draco. Her eyes narrowed while the rest of her face went blank. Draco could feel his stomach clenching, his heart was beating faster, his hands felt clammy, he couldn’t even-
“What do you mean, what do I mean? You told me. Don’t you remember?”
it’s on him.” Even though her eyes spoke of fury and confidence, Draco could see Pansy picking at the skin around her nails. He could see the hidden pain in her slouched shoulders, in the dark circles around her eyes that she’d tried to cover with makeup. “What did you do?” she asked, looking intently at Harry. There was an air of desperation about her, like she longed for connection. “To make yourself feel better?”
There was a sudden pang in Draco’s chest—like it was just settling in that
“Oh, yeah, they um, they died when I was really little,” Harry said it like it was almost nothing.
“Maybe not,” Pansy quipped from beside him, “but we
He turned to Harry, his smile softer and relaxed. “Harry,” his voice was gentle and affectionate, it made Harry’s heart ache and his lungs stutter against his will, “I miss you. I’ll… um, I’ll see you around.”
. He wanted to be there, laughing at the Weasley twins, helping Harry and holding his hand and kneading the knots out of his muscles. The very thought of even being
” Harry brushed away a few stray strands of Draco’s blond hair. “I love you, Draco.”
When he finally found Harry, the first thing he noticed was the lack of blood and gore—which brought him an immense amount of relief. The second was why Ronald had said “them” instead of “he”.
The front doors of Hogwarts Academy were truly extravagant. The doors to Draco’s own family manor couldn’t even compare, much to his chagrin. And the fact that he also happened to be standing next to Harry Potter may have played a part in how absolutely
The southern common room was humming with the sounds of students enjoying their Saturday off classes, and Harry was no different. His eyes fluttered closed and his head rolled back onto Draco’s shoulder behind him, wholly relishing the other boy’s hands kneading the muscles in his shoulders, neck, and back with practiced movements. A guttural sound that was startlingly similar to purring rumbled in his throat. They were both sitting across one of the couches, Draco sat behind Harry with his legs on either side of his own, Harry’s back leaning against the smaller boy’s chest. He was perfectly content to just stay right where he was, engulfed in his boyfriend’s richly-scented aroma; lemons and something flowery, like lavender.
what does it for you?”
“You were mumbling in your sleep,” he whispered. His voice was almost too loud for the silence. The only other sounds in the room were the snores coming from the floor, probably Theo. “You were moving around a lot, too.” There were a good six inches between them, and it felt like too much and not enough space at the same time. Harry closed his eyes, words of others crowding his head, telling him what to do.
Draco finally ran out of air and had to pull back, keeping his eyes closed to savor the moment. He felt Harry lay his forehead against his own and smiled at the tender touch. He could smell the peppermint on Harry’s warm breath.
The monster inside Draco—the one he’d worked too hard and too long to restrain—urged him to rip this apology apart, to spit hateful words at Ronald until he was on his knees, begging. It wanted him to tear this boy before him to shreds until there were tears in his eyes.
“What, so you don’t count making out in my car as something happening?”
He was worried about so many different things. What if Hermione tried to convince Harry that he wasn’t worth bothering with? What if Harry
But for the past week afterward, Draco hadn’t gone a day without finding Harry down in the weight room with his punching bag after classes and football practices. There hadn’t been a single morning that Harry hadn’t been late to breakfast because he’d been out running around the campus for who knows how long. He had been quieter and more reserved than usual at lunch, only speaking when spoken to. Draco had questioned him about all these weird behaviors, but the only answer he received was that Harry was fine.
Harry leveled a good-natured scowl in her direction. “Oh, go back to texting your boyfriend.”
“Hold up,” Blaise said, “this doesn’t explain why you were falling over yourself, nearly swooning when I first came here,” he mimed fainting over Theo, who started snickering. Blaise stayed there as he continued, “I’m not even kidding, he literally fell on the bed, sighing like a Disney Princess with hearts in his eyes.”
“I’ll stay with you if you don’t want to go. I’m sure that Professor Vector will let you make up the quiz some other time, and I don’t think we’re doing anything important in History today,” Harry tried. He felt positive that if she took the quiz now, she wouldn’t be able to do her best work as usual.
Harry didn’t let him finish.
“What do you th-think about… I... I mean, h-have you…” Draco stammered. Both his mouth and throat suddenly felt like sandpaper.
The bell rang, and Draco immediately left his seat, aiming to get to the halls before Pansy could hold him back. She caught up to him easily, shoving other kids out of her way until she was at his side.
“Dray,” Harry whispered, shaking the boy awake. “Dray, baby, wake up.”
Draco could feel his face heating again.
And then he hung up.
A sympathetic frown pulled at Draco’s trembling lips. Hugging Harry tighter to his body, Draco felt his heart clench in his chest. He tried so hard to keep the accusing tone and disappointment out of his voice when he spoke, refusing to make anything worse than it already was.
was incredible.
Draco didn’t know what it was, but Harry was attractive even as he drove. Maybe it was the car. Yes, it was definitely the car. (It wasn’t the car. It was the way his sleeves were rolled up to reveal his forearms, corded with muscle. It was the way that Draco felt that Harry was paying attention to him even as he watched the road, the way he was almost reckless with his driving but Draco still felt perfectly safe. It was the excitement of not knowing what was at the end of the road, the anticipation of seeing what was next)
Draco was upset with Pansy, to say the least. Her
But for now, he buried his face in Draco’s silky hair and closed his eyes, soaking in everything he could in his presence, and settled into sleep.
Humming in response, Harry’s smile somehow grew even softer—it made Draco wish that he was there with him if only so he could trace that smile with his fingertips and feel his warmth. “You’re right. I’ve been meaning to bring it up, I just couldn’t really find an opening or the right time.” Even Harry shook his head at his own lame excuse. “Have you thought about… what you want?”
Harry to keep touching him, kissing him,
Everything felt so
Harry reached over the table to hold both of Draco’s hands, his smile turned a little nervous, his eyes bore into Draco’s.
The score was tied with Ilvermorny, three-to-three. He spotted Theo chasing after one of Ilvermorny’s centerfielders, blocking her from being passed to. Each of Harry’s players was doing their best to cover one from Ilvermorny, cutting off the player in possession of the ball—number twenty-three, the captain of Ilvermorny’s team, Nicole. She was a ferocious kind of character, just the kind of person that her school’s team had needed for years.
“Are you su—”
“Well?” Draco asked from beside her. Theo and Blaise wore matching expressions, waiting for an explanation.
“I think,” he began smoothly, confidently, scathingly, “you mean it’s a pity that you lost. It’s a pity for you that you had to resort to hitting below the belt and playing dirty to try and hurt Harry so you’d have at least a
Then he realized—it wasn’t
Then he noticed the pain in his chest slowly fading, his heartbeat calming, his muscles going limp. Harry let himself lean completely back into Draco’s chest. The boy behind him nuzzled his face into Harry’s neck, supporting his weight. Harry tried to mimic the deep breaths he felt from Draco’s chest.
“The rest is strictly confidential best friend stuff. Completely classified. Very hush-hush type of thing.” Harry smiled teasingly, bumping Draco’s shoulder with his own. Draco would never admit it, but he almost fell over. It was at that moment that Draco realized how small Draco was compared to Harry. Sure, he was only a few inches shorter, but Harry was much broader, and he had more muscle by far. Draco was by no means weak, he liked to play football as much as the next person, but Harry was a whole different kind of strong.
“Yeah?”
It was Draco.
Silence had fallen over the table. Their little group had turned their undivided attention to Harry. Draco squeezed his hand under the table and stretched upward to press a soft kiss under Harry’s ear. It earned him a delicate smile before Harry continued, his eyes boring into Pansy’s.
Pansy’s lips were pressed into a thin, wobbling line. Misty eyes blinked at both Harry and Draco from across the table. Looking at one of his best friends, one he’d known for years, through everything, Draco could only wish that he could empathize with her. To feel the pain that she felt so that he could help her to ease it. To help her in every way he possibly could. It killed him that he had no idea what to do.
The room
Nodding, Draco moved so that his mouth was close to Harry’s ear. But before he could start speaking, he spied Ronald staring at him with a wary gleam in his eyes. Though the flashlight was still the only source of light, Draco hoped the boy saw the contemptuous glare he sent him before returning his full attention to the trembling boy in his arms.
Pansy’s words skidded to a stop. All sounds were drowned out by the startled screams around them. Luckily, a few level-headed students, Blaise and Draco included, quickly rushed to their dorms to grab flashlights.
He thought, getting back out of bed.
Draco leaned into her hand, relishing in the fleeting feeling of her fingers carding through his hair. It was a completely different sensation than when Harry did it; her nails were sharper, and the feeling of her motherly love flowered in his chest. “He really is, Mum. And I don’t just
Draco didn’t mind, though. He didn’t have much else to say to the other boy anyhow. While he appreciated the apology, Draco couldn’t put any merit in it until Ronald had gone two weeks without going back on it. Again.
coddle him back.”
A waitress came to their table and took their orders. Harry wasn’t the least bit surprised to hear Draco say that he didn’t want anything, but he also knew when his boyfriend was lying—and that he hadn’t eaten since the night before. Harry had tried getting him to eat that morning, but Draco had insisted he couldn’t. So, instead, Harry just ordered a large coffee and a blueberry muffin—he expected that Draco would start stealing his food any minute. And he was more than okay with that.
Harry asked himself.
Draco moaned louder than he ever had with Harry and felt him laugh against his neck, coming back up to caress Draco’s bottom lip with his tongue. Steaming red heat rose to stain Draco’s face, he was sure it was hot enough to burn, but he didn’t care. Looking at his boyfriend, Draco couldn’t help but think that Harry couldn’t get any more attractive than this—his lips bruised and swollen, raven hair mussed more than usual, his breathing heavy and off-kilter, his eyes darkened and focused intently on Draco’s. Harry was
Harry’s fingers tightened on his own. Draco flicked his eyes up to see Harry staring at him—the car had stopped, the windows had been rolled up, they were parked in front of the coffee shop. Harry’s green eyes had darkened, so much they were nearly black. His tongue darted out to wet his lips. Draco tracked the movement, desire and need pooling in the pit of his stomach, overpowering every other feeling. His entire body itched to get closer to his boyfriend.
Harry let his other hand fall to his side, returning to the handle of the wheeled luggage bag. The look in his green eyes spoke of devastation, but it was quickly masked with a facade of detached nonchalance.
Once they stood in the center of the bathroom, Draco felt Harry’s hands drift down to the bottom of his hoodie. Warm fingers dipped underneath the soft fabric, brushing against the skin at Draco’s hips. Harry’s eyes were questioning—like he was asking for permission. Draco was slightly surprised to find that he wasn’t the least bit embarrassed as he shucked the hoodie over his head, letting it fall to the floor.
There was a sound like a door slamming open, cutting Draco off.
this jersey, you
“Hey there,” Harry said with a sideways smile.
Harry’s face was drawn in concern when he answered the phone. Draco knew from experience that whenever Coach called Harry, it was most likely for a last-minute practice, or that something had gone wrong. Draco didn’t want to let Harry go, couldn’t let him go without making sure he was okay. But after a moment of Harry listening to her talk, his face lit up, brighter than a Christmas tree.
“I’ll always be here for you, my love,” Harry promised. “I love you, Draco.”
“Oh!” Pansy shrieked in Draco’s ear from beside him, “Did you
“Harry, my father is probably one of the most racist people that I know. I had constantly heard words like those from him, and I grew up with them being tossed about like they were nothing. When I said those words to Granger, I had no idea what they really meant,” Draco paused to take a breath as Harry pulled a fresh shirt over his head, and turned back to look at Draco with his arms crossed over his chest.
So, it feels like I haven't updated in forever... oops. But, I knew I wouldn't be able to update this Saturday with all my family plans going on, so I decided to do it today. Hope you guys like it!
“Oh.” Draco’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. His gaze didn’t move from where it was fixed. “Do you… regret any of it?”
, you listen to me
“I can’t even remember what he was yelling
All of their friends were talking around them: Hermione was gossiping and giggling with Pansy about Terry Boot and his friends, Theo and Blaise were discussing some Maths assignment, complaining about how difficult it would be to complete in time for the next class. Draco seemed to be able to drown all of them out as he drew, and Harry was content to just sit next to him and watch him work.
“Yeah, maybe.”
Harry simply smirked harder and nodded his head, which sent Snape away to another student’s table to bark at them about how they were failing.
With something between a chuckle and a suffering sigh, Harry explained, “It’s just Teddy. One second.” He set the phone down, so all Draco could see on his screen was the bedroom’s ceiling—which had glow-in-the-dark stars on it.
he thought. He was a little sad that the day was already over.
So, Harry craned his head until his lips were pressed to the top of Pansy’s head and wrapped his arms around her curvaceous frame. “Shh, flower, I know. I’m not going to be gone very long, okay?”
how to paint
Oh, he would
Draco stumbled after Harry outside, stuttering “You mean I have to do it now?”
he could go home.
“Well,” Harry replied with a teasing lilt in his voice, “if that’s the only thing you like me for, I guess that’ll have to be good enough for me.” Taking the cloth from Draco’s hands, Harry turned his boyfriend to face him, holding his jaw, and gently dabbed at the remaining paint. Luckily for both of them, it hadn’t dried yet and was still relatively easy to clean off.
“Hermione?”
As he opened the case, the familiar smell of paper, ink, pencils, and all his other supplies infiltrated his nose. And as he finally set pencil to paper, he started to draw again.
Both boys simply stared at the other, the silence between them wasn’t tense or comfortable, but somewhere between. There seemed to be shadows hiding behind Draco’s eyes, the light usually in them was hardly able to shine through.
Draco was anticipating to hear a protest from Harry, an exclamation of how unfair this was- Draco knew that it was taking every ounce of his self-control to not do it himself- but instead all he heard was a “Yes, sir” and footsteps walking down the hall.
The goalie’s fingertips just barely brushed it, but she wasn’t close enough or fast enough to stop it.
“Harry.
“Shh, love, I’m here, everything’s going to be just fine,” Harry stroked her curly hair, his lips against her forehead.
About two hours into the flight, Draco had gotten drowsy. Flying always made him sleepy, and it wasn’t exactly a midday flight. No, they had departed at seven, much too late for Draco’s taste, but it was the only flight he could get so last minute.
that one day.
make me uncomfortable, baby.” Seeing the doubt written on his boyfriend’s face, Draco resumed with a slight eye roll. “Sure, I don’t particularly
warm. Draco knew he could never tire of this—falling asleep next to Harry, being held by him, loved by him.
He knew what it felt like to have his body connected with Harry’s.
“I was…” Draco swallowed. Harry felt his hand tighten on his shirt before he started again, his voice small yet heavy and slow. “I was in my room. After the party had finally finished and everyone had gone home. I thought… I didn’t think that… I thought my parents had gone to bed.”
“Yeah, they are,” Draco said, his voice soft and words slow. Quickly swallowing the last bit of the blueberry muffin he’d started picking at earlier, Draco met Sirius’ softened gaze. He gave Harry’s hand a gentle squeeze. “I started drawing those after Harry told me about his parents. There are others, ones that aren’t just pencil, but…”
“I did, but I don’t anymore,” Harry stated, his eyes drifting closed and his lips spreading in an even wider smile.
Which was why Draco was currently curled tightly in a ball on his bed with his thick comforter blanket wrapped around him, alone in his dorm. He held his phone to his ear, anxiously waiting for Harry to answer his call while staring at the soft yellow light that emanated from the sunset outside.
“Do you think…” Harry swallowed thickly, “do you feel like I’ve been... neglecting you? Since Draco and I started dating?”
“Much better,” Draco sighed, curling into Harry’s arms and wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and shoulders. His eyes were heavy again, fluttering closed.
” Pansy sputtered. “You almost pushed me out of the car, you dimwit!”
Harry slowly pulled away and gently kissed Draco’s forehead, settling in to just cuddle with him for a while. Draco followed him down to lay on the pillows, wrapping himself around Harry in every way possible. Harry only held him tightly, keeping his lips pressed to Draco’s hair. An idea had taken residence in his head, and he hoped that it would make this painful, dismal day at least somewhat better.
“Blaise,” Harry said over the radio, “do me a favor and hand me the hoodie that was on your seat.”
Sirius was a safe haven—he was family. He was the closest thing to a father Harry had ever had.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Harry blurted, eyes wide as he gaped at Pansy across from him, “he was cheating with
“What do you mean you already knew?” Draco blurted.
Gently grabbing Draco’s hands with both of his own, Harry leaned over the console and kissed Draco’s cheek, lingering for a moment and smiling against his soft, delicate skin. He whispered, “How could they
“And half of Monday,” Harry slung the gym bag over his shoulder, drew Draco closer to tuck him into his side, then started leading him out of the locker room. “So,” Harry started, “tonight, we’re just grabbing some food from the kitchens and relaxing because I don’t think I have the energy to do anything else, baby.”
“You’re not supposed to have
Hermione nodded. “That was his name, Harry. Draco Malfoy’s the one who called me a-” Harry put his hand up to stop her there. He didn’t want to make her taste that word on her tongue.
, but the thought, the implication, of anyone else with Harry, holding his hand, cuddling in his bed, kissing him-
Harry stopped, taking in the other boy’s appearance. His eyes were wide with concern, his lips were pressed together. Harry managed a weak smile for Draco’s benefit. “No, not exactly. I would love to explain everything to you right now,” Harry swooped in and brushed his lips against Draco’s cheek, gently taking his hand and kissing the back of it before continuing, “but I have to get to the kitchens and back to Hermione as fast as I can.”
He knew the way to Harry’s common room well enough by now that he knew he could run his way there without light. That is, until he slipped up the last staircase when a loud, shrill alarm sounded through the air—fire alarms. He barely caught himself at the last second. It hadn’t even registered with him that he’d fallen until he was already up and running again, trying to block out the ear-splitting, piercing alarms.
“Potter, whatever happens out there, you’ll do me proud.” Harry heard the words, but they seemed to bounce off his heart, echoing around his chest until they were twisted, crooked, mangled, unrecognizable. Instead, he heard,
Draco watched the team practice until Harry gave them all the okay to go to the changing rooms. That was when it occurred to Draco, that if Harry was the last one out of the changing room, Draco could talk to him. Alone. And the odds of Harry being the last were good, seeing as he had stayed on the field to pick up the balls and small cones the team had used. And so, Draco hoisted his bag back onto his shoulders and walked towards the changing room.
When Harry set the rag down in the sink, Draco opened his eyes, took Harry by the hands, and led him out of the bathroom and into his bed.
at me. It’s not the first time he’s yelled at me but—the
Looking in the rearview mirror as he started the car, he saw Hermione glance at Blaise—who was laughing at Pansy smacking away Theo’s hands on her waist—and then look back down at her fiddling hands, the smallest of smiles on her face. He knew what that meant; he’d seen it more times than he could count. A devilish smile split his lips. He was looking forward to talking to her about this later.
Harry didn’t know what to do. One moment, he had been anticipating the remaining six hours of the flight, and the next, the blond boy (Harry couldn’t tell how old he was. He had the kind of face that was beautifully ageless. Of course, there was no way that he could have been much older or younger than Harry’s seventeen years) sitting next to him in the center seat had his head on Harry’s shoulder, fast asleep.
While Harry spoke, the rest of their teammates gathered around them. Fred and George stood at Harry’s other side, Alicia and Katie sat next to Theo. He saw the eager gleam in the twins’ eyes, the apprehensive twitch in their fingers. Harry glimpsed the familiar bounce in Alicia’s leg, the patterns of her drumming fingers. Katie’s entire body was tensed, her grin was nearly feral—like she would tear apart the other team with her teeth if she needed to. Harry looked at each of them in the eye, garnering what courage he had to give to his teammates.
do that.”
I felt so… so…
was incredible.
“Okay, but really. Where are we going?” Theo repeated.
Harry looked completely euphoric as he replied, with no hint of doubt in his voice, “I love you, too.”
of them, and he’d give her all the time she needed to find the right words.
Draco ignored the hesitancy flourishing in his heart and walked over; he climbed into Harry’s lap and curled up in his arms. He could have sobbed when Harry wound his strong arms around him, leaning back against the wall to support both their weights. He felt so unworthy of the warm comfort Harry offered. His heart ached and throbbed and his soul felt utterly wrecked, but it eased when Harry kissed his hair and then fit Draco’s head under his chin.
Harry had managed to get closer to all of Draco’s friends. He’d learned that Pansy loved the color green and giving surprisingly sound advice, that Blaise had a younger brother and sister-twins-that he absolutely adored. He’d managed to worm his way through Theo’s tough shell, and now shared a smile and a wave whenever he saw the other boy.
Harry softly caressed Draco’s cheek before turning and walking out the door. All the way to his dormitory, he had a small smile on his face.
After carefully wrapping Draco’s dainty hands (Harry knew that if he ever said his boyfriend’s hands were dainty out loud, Draco would not be happy. He would probably try and break some of Harry’s fingers) and wrists, Harry positioned him in front of the punching bag next to his.
that was? You completely cut out Hermione and I, just like you did the last time.”
“But I was supposed to have a few more days—”
He looked up at his boyfriend, feeling something close to shyness. Draco’s face felt so hot he probably looked sunburned. He didn’t feel cold anymore.
“Ron, I’m right here. And I told you, he apologized.”
Draco stood from his chair and walked around the table to stand in front of Harry, which seemed to effectively shut him up.
is unbelievable.” Hermione’s small hand clenched Harry’s shirt, just loose enough to avoid choking him—but he didn’t mind. He understood the feeling.
, and Harry knew that his feelings for the other boy were strong, stronger than they’d been for anyone else in a long time. He trusted Draco, he wanted to tell him things he hadn’t told anyone. There were times when they were cuddling that Harry wished they could just be zipped up in the same skin if only to be closer to him.
Katie finally finished, lifting the bar onto the hooks and sitting up. Harry grinned as she wiped at her forehead. Her shoulders sagged as he walked around to face her and sat down, straddling the bench and facing her. She looked up and scowled at his grin.
Another thudding sound. Draco saw the laughter in Harry’s eyes, and it took everything in him to keep his own chuckles inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
It felt as though half of Harry’s heart had gotten in that car and driven away. It was like his lungs had to battle for air, what was left of his heart fought for every beat. His skin felt uncomfortably hot without his ice cube of a boyfriend there to leech off of him.
“I don’t know why you bother,” Harry snorted, “if I was there, I’d just help him.”

“What do you mean,
And he was never going to let go.
, I will rip you to pieces. If he comes back here anything other than absolutely content and happy, you’ll live to regret it. Don’t play with him, this is important to him, and he’s a better person than you could ever hope to find yourself with.”
Harry pulled away from the kiss and Draco whined—embarrassingly—at the loss before his boyfriend kissed his cheek and spoke in a gravelly, guttural voice. “What do you want, baby?” he panted. “Tell me what you want, Draco.”
Draco thought.
Draco had been uneasy since Harry had left him standing there in the hall. Harry had looked so angry, angrier than he had looked when Draco had talked to him in the changing rooms before he apologized to Hermione.
With a pat on Alicia’s shoulder, Harry made his way to the boy, nimbly dodging the shove Fred aimed his way.
“Your altruism is kind of annoying,” Draco badgered back. “One might think that
“Harry, where are we going?” Draco asked, a whiny tone seeping into his words. “I was comfortable.” Harry had painstakingly coaxed him out of bed. He’d finally given in, allowing his boyfriend to haul Draco to his feet.
Okay so before you start yelling at me about my horribly inaccurate trauma dream: Believe me, I know that real trauma dreams are not like this. I know that they're not just memories. But in my defense, I didn't really have the time to write an elaborate one, and I just kind of wanted to get my point across.
Smiling, he answered, “I love you too.”
kill me.”
“I really am sorry, Harry.”
He was too busy carding his fingers through Harry’s soft, black hair. He was too occupied panting into Harry’s mouth, straddling his legs over Harry’s on the soft, worn couch. Draco couldn’t care less that they were in public, the way his boyfriend’s tongue swept lazily against his own made him dizzy, unable to concentrate on anything but the sensations of being so close to Harry and yet wanting to be so much closer. He could hardly focus on the feel of Harry’s hands gripping his hips, let alone everyone else in the room.
“I have a couple of tests coming up. Logically, I know that I’ll do fine, but I worry anyway. The last championship game is next week, and we’ve all come so far this season, and I don’t want to lose, Sirius. I don’t want to have come this far, worked this hard, just to lose.”
. Harry’s already got enough going on, he doesn’t need you adding to the mix.”
“I was looking for you after the game, I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you. You were amazing in that game today,” he tried for an assuring voice, hoping that he was getting through to him, “It doesn’t matter that the team didn’t win, you all did your best, and you did so much better than the last time you played against them.”
“Having sex with them?” Harry asked. A thread of uncertainty wound itself around his heart when Draco nodded his head. He quickly cut it as he reached out and tilted Draco’s head up by his chin. He remained silent until those beautiful grey eyes finally looked at him, the same uncertainty swirling in their depths.
After a moment, she pulled away. Her eyes had regained some of the light that he was familiar with. Draco let his hands fall back down to his lap, but he no longer felt useless. He felt Harry grasp his fingers.
Draco pulled back so he was facing Harry, who smiled at him. Harry leaned forward slowly as if to give Draco time to pull away. Instead, he leaned forward to meet him in the middle.
Harry put every ounce of force into the shot.
He’d been fast asleep on Harry’s shoulder for the past twenty minutes.
“Really mate, what’s got your knickers in a twist?” Blaise nudged him again as he took his seat next to him. Blaise continued to stare at him until Draco lifted his eyes from the desk.
Harry didn’t want to find out.
second chance. “The next game is Friday, so get ready to go to practice every day this week.”
Harry held the phone like a ticking bomb, still buzzing, as Draco’s eyes fluttered open and a groggy sounding groan came from the back of his throat. The smaller boy finally managed to open his eyes, scowling at Harry before he caught sight of the caller ID on his phone. His eyes widened almost comically, nearly popping out of his head.
. He started saying things about how I was wasting my time, how this is why he couldn’t get me into Oxford or Cambridge… I tried to hide my sketchbook and he… he started
Draco gripped his elbows and helped him stand. Every muscle in his body protested the movements, a groan rumbling in the back of his throat, irritating it further. Blood rushed to his head. Black spots danced across his vision.
“C’mon guys, I just wanna get some sleep. Is that too much to ask?” came Seamus’ voice.
A nearly undignified squeak came from Draco’s lips, barely quiet enough to not wake the others in the room. “I do
So, I hope you guys enjoyed it. I really love reading your guys' comments! And kudos are always appreciated. If you guys have any constructive criticism on my writing, I'm always looking for ways to improve. I know I can be a little spotty. I'm also slowly figuring out different ways to make the chapters look the way I want on ao3, just be patient with me. Thanks for reading! :)
Harry—whether it be curled together on the couch in the southern common room or going for a run around the school’s grounds or kissing him senseless in some abandoned classroom—made a hand of yearning wrap itself around his heart. And that feeling warred with his love for his mother. How could he possibly want to be anywhere than at his mother’s side, celebrating her birthday? Sure, he hadn’t actually been able to see much of her, and his father had been avoiding him as much as Draco had been avoiding his father—but shouldn’t he feel at least a little bit happy to be back at home? Shouldn’t he be relieved at having a few days to himself?
Draco looked over at him and bumped his shoulder with his own, more like the middle of his upper arm, if he were being honest with himself, and murmured, “I had fun, Harry. I really liked being with you today.”
Harry felt his boyfriend’s warm breath on his skin as he wound his arms around him; one across Draco’s lower back, drawing him as close as humanly possible, his other hand cradling Draco’s head. He wished that he could be zipped into the same skin with Draco. He wanted to hold him closer than this, to be wrapped up with him in every way possible.
Sitting up and feeling his heart fluttering in his chest, he quickly messaged Harry back.
Harry got out of the car and opened Draco’s before brushing his elbow to lead him into the shopping center. Draco was too busy perusing the different stores to notice where the other boy was actually leading him to. All the bright lights and neon signs advertising different stores pulled his attention everywhere at once. He smelled it before he saw it.
Because there, in the boys’ half of the changing room, was Harry Potter, alone, and shirtless, with his back to Draco. Harry was ruffling his damp hair with a towel, his back muscles shifting underneath his skin.
“Alright, alright, I get it!” Harry chuckled.
“I am so in love with you, Draco. I love you so much it hurts—so much that there isn’t enough room in my entire body to contain all of it.”
“And why exactly did you pull me out here?” Mock agitation laced Draco’s voice as he tried to keep a smile off his face.
Draco immediately started combing Harry’s hair back with one hand while the other ran up and down his back. He’d needed this. He knew that Harry had needed it, too. The closeness, the subtle intimacy of just
“What? At least tell me that you’re being safe and smart about it.”
Harry sat down on the stair below her. “Hermione, love?” He swept her hair away from her forehead. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
A small, wistful smile appeared on Harry’s face. He’d been waiting to hear those words for months but had given up hope of the possibility. He hadn’t given thought to what he might do if the day ever came.
about it—being with Harry like that. It was impossible not to, especially since Harry was so… Harry. His heart would flutter every time the idea crossed his mind, his lungs would stutter, his face would stain red. Ever since he’d come out to his parents, he’d started to get more comfortable with thinking that he might actually be able to
“I suppose I can just get over myself and my embarrassment and face your godfather,” Draco drawled.
Draco flung his arms around Harry as they crashed together. Harry crushed the smaller boy to his chest, sweeping his hands over every inch of him he could reach, checking for anything wrong. Draco’s entire body was shaking, his tears soaked into the loose gym tank top Harry wore. One of his hands was wound in Harry’s hair, the other clenched on his shoulder. The sensation of having his boyfriend so close to him again made happiness flower throughout his entire body, but it was soon suffocated.
“Hey, baby, what’s up?”
“Thank you,” he replied, the relief audible even to Draco’s ears. “I’ll see you tomorrow, baby, alright?”
he prayed. The tension in the room was so palpable, he could have cut it with a pair of scissors. His hands started to sweat. When the other boy looked up from his hands, Draco’s relief could have made him faint. Harry waved him over to the bed.
A grin spread on Harry’s lips under Draco’s fingers. His eyes shone with silent laughter, his head shook at how ridiculous his friends were. Draco shared the same sentiment, biting his lip to keep the snickering laughter quiet.
With heartbreaking gentleness, Draco was lowered onto Harry’s sheets. His heart pounded against his ribs as he watched Harry crawl over him, left only in his briefs. He was sure that his face was more flushed than it had ever been, sure that it had spread all the way down his naked chest and ears. And when Harry’s face was above his own, his emerald green eyes were filled with something that Draco couldn’t fathom—couldn’t name or describe. All he knew was that it was beautiful, and he wanted more of it.
“Ow! What the hell was that for?”
And then, as though a bubble had been burst, the sounds around them started pouring into Draco’s ears: cheering, shouting, whistling, one of the Weasley twins jokingly telling them both to get up and get a room. The kiss was broken by Harry laughing into Draco’s mouth, but the shorter boy couldn’t care less as he laughed with him. He felt high off of Harry’s victory, even though he hadn’t been playing himself.
” Draco exaggerated, drawing out the word even as Harry hooked his elbows through the other boy’s knees to better support him on his back. He knew very well that this was most likely the fastest way to get his keys and to his car with the least amount of resistance from Draco.
“How much?”
“Well, it’s getting kind of late. Goodnight, Draco. Don’t be a stranger, alright?”
game.
Voices sounded from the living room as soon as Snuffles’ barking died down. Beyond elated, Harry stood up and, with Snuffles practically attached to his hip, followed them down the hall. He glanced at all the pictures hanging on the walls as he went, pictures he’d seen a million times. He was in most of them, after all, in some form or other. Reminiscent memories caressed his mind, filling him to the brim with happiness. Harry felt as though he might combust.
“It’s a bit late, don’t you think?” Draco called, stalking toward Harry with determination boiling in his veins.
“Not with
“So,” he started, looking down at his hands for a moment, “since we haven’t really seen each other around here, I doubt it’ll magically start happening… so, do you want to, um, exchange numbers, or something?”
“Nice to see you, Hermione.” Cedric’s hands went to his lap under the table. “How are you these days?”
Harry moved his lips from Draco’s, trailing across his cheek, mouthing at his jaw, and pulling his ear between his teeth. Shivers raced down Draco’s spine, goosebumps raised on his skin. He tried to muffle the guttural moan that slipped past his lips, but the blaring music made it impossible to hear. Harry moved down the pale column of Draco’s neck, alternating between soft kisses and sharp nips—the combination driving Draco senseless. His broad hands moved from the smaller boy’s hips to his thighs, gradually sliding up the fabric of his jeans, making him shiver in pleasure. Draco’s breaths were short and fast. His pulse beat against his ribs almost painfully.
So, this chapter is a little shorter than my previous ones, but there's a surprise POV, so I hope you guys enjoy it! Also, I upped the chapter count so there's that...
Narcissa’s eyebrow arched at a fierce angle. “Have you had sex with him?”
Looking at Harry’s small smile, a burst of joy exploded in Draco’s chest.
“Well, my father, as you know, isn’t my favorite person. But my mother- my mother is definitely my favorite person. She’s wonderful and has always supported me, even if she had to do it silently. She’s always been very clever in getting around my father’s disapproving glares,” Draco laughed, thinking about the smirk his mother would give him after outwitting his father.
Snape’s words had gone, but Harry could still feel a lingering stain. With every strike against the bag, every drop of sweat, he felt that stain lift. His entire focus was on the strain in his muscles, on keeping his breath even. His punches got faster and harder, his kicks became more vigorous the longer he went on.
“Harry, please, just—”
hard!” Blaise protested.
I hope you all enjoy this chapter!!
Concentration was impossible. And Draco had tried everything. He’d thrown himself into his assignments during class, hung off every word Professor Binns droned, read every single word in the history textbook assignment, but nothing worked. His thoughts always came back around to Cedric Diggory.
Harry stood up. “Okay?”
As much as it pained him, Harry pulled away but didn’t go far. His hands cupped Draco’s face, thumbs wiping away the trails of tears going down his cheeks. “Baby, what happened?”
“You’re impossible and you know
victorious air to his voice. Draco knew he was done for. He clapped a hand over his own mouth to try and keep the noise of his heavy breathing low.
Harry had unexpectedly grown an inch or two in the past few months, so Draco now fit more comfortably against him. When they’d first noticed, it had bothered Draco to no end.
Draco decided to drop that particular subject, he wanted to be the one to bring the light to Harry’s eyes, not diminish it.
“Just take me to bed, you simpleton, my feet are about to fall off.”
Blaise seemed to catch his meaning. “Is this about that Harry fellow? I saw him walk past you, why don’t you just text him? Ask what crawled up his arse.”
Nodding, Harry watched as Hermione reluctantly stood and walked out with a glance over her shoulder before closing the door behind her.
“Is that so?”
“I can’t believe you let me stay in there for four hours,” Draco said as they got in Harry’s car.
“Harry, as much as I love this,” Draco said, his voice incredibly breathy even to his own ears, “I have a feeling that Seamus isn’t kidding.” It took every ounce of his strength to untangle his fingers from Harry’s hair and pry them from the muscle at his shoulder. The other boy snickered into his neck as he gently pulled his hands away, running his palms over every inch of skin he could reach in the process.
was gorgeous. He knew his jaw had dropped. He also didn’t care.
Luckily, before Draco could fall any further into his downward spiral, Blaise nudged him in the ribs, perhaps a little too hard.
at him through the grate on the cupboard door.
Harry let out a quiet laugh before resuming his trail of soft kisses down Draco’s neck, over his shoulder, and anywhere he could reach. Draco simply let his head fall back on Harry’s shoulder, closed his eyes, and trusted that Harry wouldn’t leave him in there long enough for his skin to prune.
So, when Draco opened Harry’s dorm room door, he was expecting to find his boyfriend alone and in need of comfort; the same kind of comfort that Draco was more than happy to provide for him.
All three of them made that weird ascending noise people make when they saw something cute, and practically piled on top of him in what was supposed to resemble a group hug, but turned into more of a dog pile. Draco felt warm with all of them cuddling him, a soft smile on his lips.
Theo didn’t move when Harry sat beside him on the bench. Harry knew he was trying to compose himself, trying to collect his fears behind a facade of confidence, attempting to prove that he was ready. The captain set a hand on Theo’s shoulder.
me?” Pausing his perusal of Harry’s hair, Draco cupped Harry’s face and drew him up to look at him. He traced the shape of Harry’s lips with his thumb, the other caressing his cheekbone.
"Why the
This time, it was Harry who leaned in, nudging Draco’s nose with his own before slanting his mouth over Draco’s in a soft, gentle kiss. Fireworks seemed to explode inside Harry, brighter and hotter with each movement of their lips. It seemed that they both melted into each other as they fit together perfectly. Harry’s hands touched every inch of Draco he could reach. He desperately wanted to memorize the shape of him, the feel of him so close, his smell, his taste—everything. Draco kissed him slowly, almost lazily. His fingers curled in Harry’s raven hair, gently tugging him closer. It felt as if they had all the time in the world when in reality they both knew that Harry needed to leave in a matter of minutes.
In some part of his mind, Harry had hoped that Ron would come around, that he would apologize and do his best to mend their torn friendship. But he’d gone and done that, and then ripped it apart. Again. Tore it to shreds.
“Oh? And what did you figure I would like?”
“Sorry.”
And just then, the sleeping boy curled more into Harry’s side, grabbing onto his arm and pressing his side into Harry’s. His ribs were pressed into the arm rest, so Harry slowly used his right arm to lift it back up so that the blonde could be more comfortable. His fingers curled around Harry’s arm were cold, seemingly sucking out Harry’s heat, but he didn’t mind. The blonde cuddled so tightly to Harry that there was almost no space between their bodies
“Yeah, of course.”

He couldn’t help but stare.

At the sound of his boyfriend’s—slightly hoarse—voice, Harry broke away from his team. Draco had run out onto the field with the brightest grin on his face, bundled up in warm clothes. Harry felt his heart racing even faster as he ran out to meet him in the middle, scooping up his boyfriend in his arms and swinging him around in a circle. The sound of Draco’s laughter made butterflies appear in Harry’s chest. (Even though his muscles ached, Harry couldn’t find it in himself to let go of Draco. Even though he was certain that he smelled like a barn animal in the peak of summer, he wanted to hold on to him. He wanted to share this moment with him, he wanted to share

“Night, kitten.”
Harry dropped his head onto Draco’s shoulder, his breathing a little off-kilter, and then started laughing. Draco didn’t even have the chance to regain his breath before he began chuckling, only half trying to keep it quiet since they were in the library.
When he opened his eyes, Harry felt more settled inside. His stomach had stopped churning. His head felt clearer. While the nightmare was still prevalent in his mind, he felt less affected by it. He flicked his gaze up to Draco, who was looking at him with concern swirling in his eyes.
worth swooning over.
was even better. After the game ended, Draco watched Harry say a few quick words to the other team’s captain before hurrying off to the showers, all the while getting shoved around by his teammates, laughter echoing behind them. Draco had watched him go with pride flowering in his chest, with utmost certainty that Harry would hurry back to him.
He suddenly understood why some people bite their nails when nervous. He didn’t know what to do with his hands and heart couldn’t seem to decide whether to stop completely or beat up his ribcage.
“I—um…” Ron’s eyes darted around to Pansy, Theo, and Blaise, ever so slightly shrinking into himself as he saw the stoniness that awaited him there. “I just… I want to apologize to you, Hermione. And you, Harry.” Hermione’s hands clamped down on the muscles of Harry’s shoulders, digging her fingers in to stifle their trembling. “I said a lot of stupid, nasty things to the both of you, and—and I really wish that I hadn’t. I’m so, so sorry.”
. Hopefully.)
He took his hands from his pockets and started fiddling with the cuffs of his shirt, feeling the shame start to seep in.
“Wait,” Harry said, realizing what she was implying, “You can’t mean that… It wasn’t him, was it?”
“Well then, I’m glad you’re back.” She gestured to the entirety of the store. “Go look around, we’ve added a lot of new things since you’ve been here.”
“I know it’s dark right now, I’m sure the fire alarms scared you, but you’re okay. Just breathe with me, alright? You’re safe, I promise, sunshine.”
Sympathy and concern shone on both Remus and Sirius’ faces. Their eyes took on that familiar gleam that screamed their shared worry.
Draco nodded, but his mind stuck on one word Harry had said: “Was?”
, Harry.” She tried to pull her body closer to his, but he simply rolled over so they were facing one another. She gently brushed his hair from his face, curling her arms around him again as he laid his head on her shoulder, his face in her neck, arms around her waist; she felt a bit like a human teddy bear, but she didn’t mind. Hermione was just contented with the fact that Harry had even found the strength to let her in.
On a sudden impulse, without a second thought, Draco reached out and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, drawing him close and nuzzling his face in Harry’s muscled stomach. Draco held him tightly, the smell of vanilla and grapefruit overpowering his senses. The feel of Harry’s damp, smooth skin only made him hold tighter.
. He discovered that Draco’s neck and ears were particularly sensitive, and couldn’t resist kissing him there, biting and licking him, if only for the sake of extracting the whines and moans from his reluctant mouth.
The four of them sat in silence for a while, waiting for Pansy to gather her wits enough to say
“I’m sorry,” he whispered gently. “I shouldn’t have shouted. I didn’t mean to startle you. I just don’t want you to think that. You couldn’t ever disappoint me, Harry. Or... disgust me, if that’s something you’re worried about.” Draco’s eyes held pure earnestness as they bore into Harry’s, a complete turn around from where he’d been moments ago. “I’m... more concerned that
to her? (Of course, Harry would listen to her, he was the kind of person who puts those he loved before anything else. He was the kind who loved fiercely and with everything he had, and Draco knew that he longed to be one of those people, to be loved so passionately) But most of all, deep down, Draco knew that the biggest thing that was worrying him was the fear that Hermione would despise him. That she would take his apology and throw it into the metaphorical trash bin.
Harry didn’t even bother to answer until he had opened the door to his dorm and practically collapsed onto his bed, finally allowing his exhaustion to hit him. “I’m pretty sure he said six? I don’t know, check my phone, he texted me in third hour.”
Draco cursed under his breath. His entire body froze, just behind the door. He’d known there was a chance of them getting caught, but he’d been so positive that nothing would go wrong.
After so much time, work, and struggle, he’d finally been able to accept them as part of him, a part of his past that he couldn’t just lock away and pretend didn’t exist. He didn’t like it, he didn’t like that this was what he came from, that this was the story he was given to tell. He didn’t like that there were times it crept back to him. He didn’t like that it still affected him. But he wouldn’t be afraid of it.
Ron, you’ve been a
Returning as fast as possible, Draco set his light on the couch before wrapping himself around Pansy again.
“Pretty well.” There was a heavy breath and a pause. “At least at the end. Most of it was pretty hard—there was a

Harry pulled away, taking both of Draco’s hands in his own, kissing them gently.
“How many in your party?” she asked. Her name-tag read
did you start sassing Snape?”
Harry laughed quietly on the other end of the phone. Draco furrowed his eyebrows in confusion.
“What’s the laptop for?” Draco asked.
“Do you feel okay to tell me what’s been going on?” Sirius continued. “Or do you want to sleep first? I can call you tomorrow and we can talk then.”
She shook her head, laughing as she said to the whole group, “I have to get going, I’m meeting Terry.”
Hermione had looked excited, up until he said his name. Her eyes went wide, her brow furrowed, and her mouth opened slightly. She looked down at her hands, which were clenched together so tightly that it seemed she was about to break her own fingers.
“Harry, how did you even-” she paused, shaking her head in his chest, “I suppose it doesn’t matter how, just that you did. So thank you, Harry. This was
He only had time to draw his eyebrows together in confusion before someone sat down next to him, filling the spot where Pansy had just been.
But when he woke up, Draco felt warmer than he ever had. His nose was filled with the scent of peppermint and cologne, and he was so comfortable that it was a miracle he had even woken up at all. But under his fingers weren’t the sleek, silk sheets he covered his bed with. Under his head wasn’t the ridiculously expensive down pillow he loved.
Harry snatched his keys from his nightstand. Whatever trace of grogginess that might have remained was long gone. His heart clenched as he heard his boyfriend’s stifled sobs through his phone. “I’m on my way, baby, okay? I’ll be there as soon as I can. I promise. Take some deep breaths for me, okay?”
“Right, show me what you know.” Harry stepped back and gestured with his hand for Draco to hit the bag.
Draco felt her words sink into his skin. This was what it meant to love Harry—he had to have control over himself when Harry needed him. He needed to be the strong one sometimes.
Letting out a deep sigh, he answered, “I don’t know, really. I guess I just always figured that if either of them had some of my dad’s stuff, then they would’ve shown me or given it to me by now… I don’t think I’ve ever really asked.”
“To the bathroom,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hands in both of his and slowly walking him to the bathroom door in the dorm. “I’m willing to bet that you haven’t had a bath in what you think is way too long and that you feel filthy—even though you still look as gorgeous as ever. Plus,” Harry paused to open the door, smiling at Draco’s narrowed, indignant gaze, “you could use a little relaxation.”
Harry waited.
know there’s a
Bodies crashed into him, nearly knocking Harry to the ground if not for the others behind him. His sight finally focused on the faces of his teammates, bright grins all around. His head cleared, and he finally allowed himself a grin. They were all yelling excitedly, with glittering sparkles in their eyes. His chest erupted with a radiant happiness, seeping into his bones, flowing through his veins, and rushing to his head. Harry wrapped his arms around the ones closest to him. A grin split his face, he had to close his eyes to wrap his mind around what had happened in the last few minutes.
Harry’s mind immediately went on offense, he wanted to open his mouth and spew the words that came to his defense. He wanted to take Ron off his holier than thou pedestal brick by brick, wanted to tear down the barrier that had come between them overnight. But words were out of his grasp. Thoughts rambled in his head, a stream of agonizing thoughts that reminded him of too many nights spent shut in the cupboard.
from him, a sound that never failed to make Draco tremble with need. Kissing him was like coming up for air, like waking up, like being dunked in ice-cold water and yet still finding it refreshing. Harry’s fingers dipped beneath his jeans, trailing along Draco’s sensitive skin.
If it's horrible, I'm sorry. If this chapter was offensive to you in any way, please let me know how and why, so I can fix it in later chapters. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Comments, kudos, requests, I take them all. Thanks for reading!
Harry felt Draco’s trembling breath against his chest, his thin shoulders moving against him.
Hermione had finally arrived at their lunch table, where Ron had been pestering Harry for details about the boy he had met.
“Harry?” Draco asked after a moment of comfortable silence.
“Yeah, Sirius. He was my dad’s best friend.” Harry hesitated like there was a part of the story he was reluctant to tell. He squeezed Draco’s hand and seemed to decide that he trusted the smaller boy. “He was in prison for twelve years, falsely accused of murder. When they found the guy he had supposedly killed, they let him go. He came for me as soon as he was cleared, about six months later the Dursley’s finally let him have custody. I was thirteen when I finally got to move in with him. The day I met Sirius was probably the happiest day of my entire life.”
“Why would you disappoint me?” Harry hesitantly asked. His heart gradually settled in his chest as he wound himself down. His lungs slowly remembered how to breathe properly again as Draco’s thumbs rubbed circles into his palms.
” Draco was nearly dumbfounded. “No, Harry, I just felt like spending
“We should do something today,” Pansy complained, having given up on the intricate style of braid she had been attempting. Harry opened an eye to peer at her bored expression, the corners of his mouth lifted in amusement. He just settled deeper into Draco’s body, surprised that the other boy wasn’t crushed by his weight. Draco only shifted his hips to better fit him, cradling him with his body. (It was soothing, being wrapped up in Draco’s body. He was a cooling presence, easing the heat that constantly overwhelmed Harry. Although Draco was the smaller of the two, there were times he insisted on holding Harry, demanded to be the one supporting
Just then, the waitress returned with an expectant look on her face. Everyone quickly picked something off the menus—most likely completely botching the pronunciation—and ordered before she left again. Draco cuddled deeper into Harry’s body, savoring his warmth for the rest of lunch.
He just hadn’t anticipated the fear it would stir up.
Ron looked skeptical. “Who is it then? It’s been a bit since you’ve gone after a guy. Wasn’t the last one that Krum fellow who was only here for like a month?”
him enough to be gentle with him, enough to give him space if he needed it. So Harry brought his smaller boyfriend closer to his body, moving so their heads were on Harry’s pillows, facing each other. Draco slowly brought his hands to Harry’s face, softly tracing his skin. His fingers were as chilled as always, and Harry kissed his fingertips as they passed over his lips.
Harry stared at him for a moment and then laughed.
But for now, he just wrapped his body around Harry’s slumbering frame, holding tight to him, burying his face in the crook of his neck.
, Harry? How could I have been
Both Blaise and Theo left the bed after she did, and all three of them got ready for bed before Draco laid back down in his bed, looking forward to his Saturday afternoon with Harry with a smile on his face.
Oh! Also, I got a tumblr account and a blog and everything so maybe go follow me there, where Shoulder Pillow is cross posted: @musicdreamer003
Sirius looked up from Harry’s phone and said, “These are…
“Yeah, of course I will,” Harry assured. Pressing one more kiss on his temple, Harry pulled away from Draco and started walking to the bathroom to pack the rest of his boyfriend’s things. But before he got very far, he heard a quiet, “Thank you” from behind him. A soft smile made its way onto Harry’s lips, even as he tried to quell the anxiety and uneasiness rising up in him.
“A few weeks, I think,” Pansy muttered.
Fred and George had been the one to tell him about the secret passages in the school. Harry had been thirteen at the time. This particular one was shorter than most of the others, just a tunnel staircase that led from the seventh floor to the third, oddly convenient in this case.
Harry felt an overwhelmingly vivid surge of love flow through every vein, every nerve in his body—of adoration and fondness and affection and infatuation and everything that made up pure, unadulterated
And just like that, Draco seemed to melt—his shoulders relaxed, and his eyes fluttered closed as Harry released his jaw and wiped away the remaining paint flecks from both of their faces. The atmosphere around them relaxed where it had been charged. Small, soft smiles pulled at both of their mouths.
“Because I haven’t—I’m a virgin.”
It was at this moment that Draco truly realized something. He was shirtless. In front of Harry. He was
Cold lips press against his forehead. Draco brings his body closer, tucking Harry’s head under his bony chin. Coolness seeps into Harry’s bare skin as he buries his face deeper into Draco’s chest. Shivers run down his spine as Draco begins combing his fingers through his hair, scratching against his scalp.
The smile that was undoubtedly on Harry’s face could practically be felt through the phone, in his words. Beaming to himself, Draco felt his face heating. He both loved and hated that Harry’s words still had such an effect on him.
“I know it doesn’t count for much,” Harry told her, a sympathetic frown on his lips, “at least not right now. But I’m so,
, he thought, opening a panel in one of the walls and slipping through.
“Was that supposed to make me feel better?” Draco pinched Harry’s bicep, smirking at his surprised yelp. “Because it doesn’t. And I can’t decide if I’m curious or disgusted.”
Confusion wrinkled Draco’s brow as he looked up into Harry’s gorgeously green eyes. “I’m just fine, love.” There was a subtle anxious air about Harry. One that Draco silently cursed himself for not having noticed before. “Why?”
“You know, Harry,” she said, her voice nearly calm and collected with what sounded like underlying amusement, “if you and Draco weren’t so
The smirk that grew on Narcissa’s face was unmistakable, and yet it clashed with the concern and interest in her icy blue eyes and her sky-high eyebrows. “So… have you two…”
At Draco’s nod, Harry kissed his boyfriend’s forehead and released his hand. He turned to Hermione on his other side. The shuttered look in her eyes worried him, but he trusted Draco to do as he asked. He pressed a kiss to her hair before Draco swung an arm around her shoulders, leading her and the rest of their friends to the southern common room.
“How is it not my fault?
“Either you both shut up, or find somewhere else to be awake,” came Seamus’ exasperated voice. His accent became thicker with sleep.
Draco’s fingers were digging into Harry’s shoulders like he was afraid he would float away if he didn’t hold on tight enough. Harry’s mouth traveled down to Draco’s neck, where he seemed to switch gears and started leaving butterfly kisses across his shoulders and collar bones. The blond boy could hear his own heavy breathing, only consoled by the fact that Harry’s was just as uneven and labored. He quivered when Harry kissed under his ear, his tongue then tracing the shell.
single
Even though his muscles were slightly sore from training the day before, Harry ran as fast as his legs would take him through the corridors, into the garage, and dashed for his car. Draco’s breaths hadn’t improved; he sounded like there was a weight on his chest. His muffled cries hadn’t relented. Harry started his car and hoped that it wouldn’t alert anyone to him leaving as he quickly pulled out of the garage and got on the main road, still holding the phone to his ear with one hand.
His father cut him off. Harry could hear the sharp tone the man used. Indignation bubbled in his gut, heating his blood. It was quickly vanquished when Harry caught sight of the defeated expression on Draco’s face. A flooding concern took its place.
“Dray, I can practically feel you stewing,” Harry said, gently breaking the stretched silence. “Whatever it is, just spit it out.”
“I think it has something to do with the fact that I’m a pacifist, unlike you crazy psychopaths,” Draco retorted.
Harry smiled wider when Draco’s face flushed red once again, this time reaching even his ears. Draco looked around for a second and realized that there were only a few other passengers who were actually awake, seeing as it was so early in the morning.
. With Draco’s body pressed tightly against his own, Harry felt so
Harry startled back to awareness, looking up at Hermione, who was standing next to his chair.
it. He was just slightly afraid that conversation would run slow and become awkward, despite the fact that their conversation on the airplane hadn’t been like that. It had been easy and fun.
He heard Harry’s sharp intake of breath, his gaze focused on Draco’s ribs. Draco looked down, only to see a large purple and blue bruise covering the expanse of his right ribs. Memories of falling down the stairs flashed through his mind—he couldn’t really recall everything that had happened, but he knew it was a possibility that he’d slammed his side on one of the stairs at some point.
Draco had in fact seen the incident Pansy was talking about and told her so. There’d been many of the same nature from the same player, over and over again. Lucas Ferreira, one of Castelobruxo’s forward players, seemed to have some sort of grudge against Harry—he’d already fouled on him twice and had come close to injuring him far too many times for Draco’s taste. Fortunately, Harry seemed attuned to Ferreira’s agenda against him and was able to avoid the majority of his moves and make a few goals in the process, without sustaining any serious injuries.
Draco turned to the next row of lockers to find Harry standing at his open locker, his hair damp and dressed only in sweatpants. This time, however, Harry seemed to hear him before Draco could get a close view of his back. And the scars that laced it. He turned around, every movement looked slow and aching. Draco walked to his boyfriend (Draco’s heart still skipped a beat when he thought that word to himself, or when he heard it out loud. Harry Potter was his
The disbelief turned to hatred in an instant. “Watch your tone, Potter,” Snape growled, then turned with a dramatic flair and stalked to his desk on the other side of the room. Harry knew full well that Snape would find some way to get back at him for his words, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care very much.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, baby, alright?”
Draco went crazy. He smelled everything he could get his hands on, sampled every lotion he set his eyes on, examined every hair product, inspected every skincare application. He still had some part of his logical mind working, so he tried to narrow down what he actually chose for Harry to buy.
He leaned forward to kiss Harry, slanting his lips over his boyfriend’s in such a gentle manner it barely even qualified as a kiss. But even the slightest touch sent shivers shooting down his spine and goosebumps erupted on his skin. His lips were soft, and moved against Draco’s so tenderly—the moment couldn’t have felt more perfect.
Walking towards his boyfriend, his  brow furrowed, Harry asked, “Is everything alright?”
“Thanks,” Draco said. But just as Harry turned to grab the hoodie, he leaned in close to whisper in Harry’s ear, brushing his fingers against the pulse point at his neck. “And just so we’re clear, my love, I liked all of it.”
