,” in a small circle around his camp. Once that was complete and he could see the faint shimmer of wards, he began to unpack the bag Dobby had prepared for him.
“-It is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects–” she was cut off by a different voice that filled the Hall, high and clear and so very, very cold. Draco staggered and Blaise caught him around the middle as the students started to scream.
“What are we going to do then, Harry?” Finnigan asked, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “What’s the plan?” he said and Harry blinked at him.
"Shall I get another round of tea, Mr. P? And I think Minister Granger's broadcast is about to start, if you want to tune in?" she said. Harry nodded, and waved his hand in the direction of the wireless which sat in a corner of the room. It crackled to life and the dial adjusted itself into the evening broadcast. Ron went to sit back at the desk while Malfoy gaped at Harry slightly.
“Very well. I shall take my seat,” Snape said, and he inclined his head at Mother before moving further down the table, slipping into a seat to the right hand of the head of the table. Opposite where Snape had sat down, Corban Yaxley looked up. His wine glass was still full and while he inclined his head at Snape politely, Draco noticed his sharp gaze tracking Snape’s movements even when he had turned away.
“NO! Severus, get up! Get UP!” he howled, his voice torn from his chest, his eyes unable to focus, unable to even cry because this couldn’t be true, it couldn’t. His brain could not comprehend.
“NO!” A terrible scream wrought the air in two and Draco jumped, his heart seizing in his chest. Ahead, he could see McGonagall stumble, caught by Trelawney. McGonagall’s hand was to her throat, her body bent double and Draco pushed ahead through the crowd, breaking into the fresh air of the courtyard to see…
“You’re asleep next to me,” he said and Potter nodded. He was sitting cross-legged on the dark floor and Draco joined him, sitting opposite so that they were nearly knee-to-knee. “Do you remember these dreams?” he asked and Potter shrugged one shoulder.
“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” Father said, leaning closer to Potter. He reached behind his back again, flapping a hand and summoning Draco forward once more. “There’s something there… it could be the scar, stretched tight… Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
“Uhm?” he asked, sounding as un-Malfoy-like as Harry had ever heard, and Harry laughed, drawing back a little bit.
The September air was growing chilly as the sun sank beneath the spires in the distance. The cobblestones were slick with the recent rainfall and Harry had to watch his step to make sure he didn’t slip and end up in the pathway of one of the student cyclists, who seemed to take corners at death-defying speeds.
Bathilda’s expression was curiously blank as she watched Potter go around the room, lighting the candles set on every surface. Granger gave him a wide-eyed look as he sidled by her, heading towards the chest of drawers where Draco waited. Potter lit the match between his fingers and leaned over to light a stub of a candle, pausing. Draco glanced at him and he was studying the collection of dust-covered photographs there, mottled glass and silver catching the light from the candle. Draco leaned closer as well.
“Harry, could this be –? Aargh!” Hermione let out a scream of pain and whatever she had been holding clattered to the floor. Draco turned around sharply and his elbow caught on a pile of coins, sending them raining down onto the stone slabs underfoot. No sooner had they landed then there were a series of sharp ‘
“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” Harry whispered into the silent room. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does… I am the true master of the Elder Wand,”
"Bye Dad, bye Papa!" Albus shouted out the window as the train gave a shudder and began to trundle out of the station, steam billowing around them all.
“I don’t know how you do it, mate. The idea of writing more essays after those years at Hogwarts is enough to make my stomach turn,” he said and Hermione huffed, though it sounded more like a laugh. “It still surprises me that you decided to go to University,” Ron admitted, running his thumb nail over the edge of the label on the bottle in his hands. “Thought that was Hermione’s area of expertise,” he added teasingly, and Hermione gave a playful tug on his hair. Ron turned to look at her and gave him an enamoured sort of smile, which she returned. Harry felt a pang of loneliness.
"What a name for a bear!" he said with a hint of delight and Harry smiled. From the frame, both boys waved at them, Scorpius lifting one of Aloysius' paws to make him wave too.
“I’ll take the first watch. Hermione, could I borrow your wand please?” he asked and she nodded, drawing hers out from the sleeve of her jumper and passing it over. Potter took an old cushion from one of the armchairs and dropped it to the floor at the entrance to the tent, and sat down on it cross-legged, looking out at the snow. Hermione gave his back an affectionate smile and then went to the kitchen, pulling out a dusty jar from one of the cabinets. She pointed her wand at it and a ball of blue fire appeared within. She went back over to Harry and held it out to him.
“Leave it, Ron. Malfoy,” and the warning tone was obvious in Potter’s voice, and Draco waved a dismissive hand to let him know he didn’t need to say anything more. “I’ve got to try out this new wand anyway,” Potter said to Weasley, obviously changing the subject, and they went further into the tent, their voices muffled.
"Don't follow me in," he told them, his voice croaking oddly, "If you try to step through that glass, it will cut you to ribbons. If the frame turns silver, it means someone has died inside… You might have to wait for me to come out. It depends how far in they are. If I don't come back out within the hour, well - I won't be coming back," he told them and Hermione gave a little hiccup of a sob behind Harry. Draco turned to face him once again, looked as though he were about to say something but thought better of it, and then turned to face the mirror.
“I went to a French University, actually, one near Carcassonne,” He said, his accent lilting over the city name, but he didn’t offer further information. He turned his cool gaze to Harry and raised an eyebrow inquiringly. “And you, Potter?” he asked and Harry felt like someone had given him a small electric jolt. Malfoy said
There was a chorus of noise from Slytherin House and slowly those Slytherins that had aligned themselves with Hogwarts left their house table to sit in the spaces opened up by the other students, leaving their classmates to watch them, pale-faced and narrow-eyed.
Draco dropped to his knees between them and reached a shaking hand to touch Nymphadora’s hair. The numbness he felt at Snape’s death felt wider and deeper all of a sudden, as though someone had scooped out all of his insides. He did not know his cousin, not truly, but he mourned for her still. And for her son who had, in the course of one night, become an orphan.
“Dobby?” Draco asked in a tremulous voice. The elf gave him a curious look. “Where should I go, Dobby? I can’t go home. I don’t know where to–”
“D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” Potter asked and Dean sidled past Draco to pat him on the back and they all slipped away, leaving Draco with Potter. Potter gave him a glance and then looked back down at the freshly covered grave. “You too, Draco,” he said quietly and though he was hurt, Draco nodded and turned away, heading back for the cottage. He gave a quick glance back to see Potter knelt over the grave, working on something that Draco could not see.
And then he had left them. Alone, in the middle of Kings Cross, students and parents and muggles alike bustling around them.
!” Draco shouted, pointing his wand at the previously concealed entrance, and the two Death Eaters that had followed them crashed into an invisible wall with sickening crunches. They scrambled to their feet just in time to hear Ron yell “Get back!” and then a herd of galloping desks thundered past, Professor McGonagall leading the charge, and they followed in her wake, throwing themselves into the frey.
“Thank you for bringing it over Rachel. I’ll make sure you don’t receive anything else for me,” he said and she bobbed her head in acknowledgement and then left him to it. Harry sighed and finished scribbling out his request list, dropping it on the small tray on a shelf in the room and turning to the parcel while he waited for the books to be sent up.
Draco’s feet carried him where his mind could not and soon he was standing by his cousin's corpse. In death, her hair was light brown, and her face was serene. Her husband, who had been elated all those months ago, overjoyed at the birth of his son, lay next to her, his face turned to hers. He looked as peaceful as his wife, as though they had both just fallen asleep.
"I'll go help them, shall I?" he asked, putting his toast down on a plate and slipping through the open kitchen door, taking the stairs two at a time up to the boys' floor. It was Scorpius who was trying to move his trunk, his dark blond hair in his face, his cheeks flushed pink from the exertion. He had managed to get the trunk quite far, and it was now balancing precariously on the edge of the top step. Draco caught it on the underside and steadied it from rocking too far over.
"So you did," Harry said and Malfoy made a small noise. "I'll leave you to it. If you want anything washed, just leave it by the door. We have an Elf, Dinky, who comes in every morning to do some laundry and a general tidy," he explained, slowly heading for the door, but Malfoy called him back.
He went through the questions one by one, jotting next to each a small word in pencil, trying to prompt something in him to make him want to answer the question. That was the ethos he had taken with the General papers - find a question he
“One minute,” he told his mother through the crack in the door and then he shut it as he turned to fetch his things for dinner. Shoes, for one. Despite the heat of the day, he had not rolled up his shirt sleeves, in fear of seeing what lay hidden by the fabric, and he shrugged on a dark robe so he could conceal his wand in one of the inner pockets. He paused to look in the mirror above his desk and it tutted at him despairingly. He ran a hand through his hair and it fell limply around his face.
. He tapped the tip of the pencil against the question a few times, letting the question mull over in his mind for a little while, before dropping the pencil, picking up the provided pen and turning over a fresh sheet of paper. He scribbled the question at the top and began to write.
He knew, logically, that she was the best student in their year, or even in all of Hogwarts. She constantly beat him in tests and exams, and she never got a question wrong when called upon (and even when she wasn’t). But he had never truly believed it – maybe it was because of the things his parents used to say, but he hadn’t truly understood what that meant until he saw her stood in that clearing, her eyes tilted to the sky, reflecting the shooting stars of spells as they broke free over the wards and joined them in harmony.
That night, while Weasley was incessantly tapping at the wireless, trying to tune in to some secret programme he had been telling them about, Hermione slipped out of her bedroom and came to stand in the middle of the tent. Draco, who was sitting at the dining table, looked up, one hand under his chin as she cleared her throat to attract their attention.
“I’m worried about you, darling,” Pansy wheedled at him, leaning heavily against his arm, a hand resting on his shoulder. “You’ve barely touched your Beef Wellington, and it's your favourite,” she whined and Draco blinked at his full plate.
“Lee’s ‘River’, they’re all using codenames, but you can usually tell–” and then Hermione shushed him as Lee went on.
“Bed. I have a headache coming on. I’ll see you in the morning,” he told them blandly and if they didn’t believe him, neither of them protested. He left them, robes wrapped tight around him in the chill of the dungeons corridors as he took the staircase further down.
“They left last year,” Draco added confidently. “I’m in my last year, I would’ve seen them about the castle if they were still students. But they left last year,” he repeated and Greyback scowled at him.
“My dear boy, I do,” Dumbledore replied and Draco suddenly felt choked with emotion to hear Dumbledore’s voice once again. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?”
"Thank you, Lee. Ladies and gentlemen of the Wizarding World, I have the sad task today of telling you all that the sons of Harry Potter, twelve-year-olds Albus Severus and Scorpius Hyperion, were kidnapped today on their way to Hogwarts for the start of the September term. A message was left by the kidnapper at Platform 9¾, but the Aurors do not yet know if this was where they were taken, or if this was left after the kidnapping took place. We are urging all members of the public to come forward to the MLE if they witnessed anything suspicious between the hours of 11am and 5pm today, that could be related to the boys being taken. Please contact the Auror office on the dedicated floo line," she said and there was silence from Lee's end.
!” he cried out and the red jet of light burst from his wand, heading straight for Rowle who screamed and screamed. Draco held the wand steady though he could feel the rest of his body tremble, and he tried not to flinch as he felt the Dark Lord come up behind him.
"I know where he might have them," he said in a trembling voice, and he set off into the darkened house, heading for the stone staircase. They all followed.
“Why did it burn?” Potter asked and Draco looked skyward – above him was nothing, just like what surrounded them, and he felt a bit of vertigo at the thought.
“I want to help,” he admitted and Potter made a small noise of disbelief. Draco ignored him. “I’ve been… I’ve been aware of what’s been going on since the summer. I don’t want any part of the Dark Lord’s plans. He tried it once and I failed–”
’. Professor Flitwick, standing on a stacked house table, neatly flicked his wand at Dolohov who screamed and sank to the floor as his skin began to slough off, Ernie Macmillan with a bloody nose cheering next to Flitwick.
His pale face was serene, his red eyes surveying the room as though he could tell their innermost thoughts from just a glance. Draco forced himself to look upon the Dark Lord, though, with deference, for looking away would cause suspicion, and suspicion would lead to… many different things.
Landing in the Apparation zone for Kings Cross, they headed for Platform 9¾ and slipped through the barrier, leaning against it faux-casually and stepping backwards into it, coming through the other side into the bustle of parents sending their children away for another school year. Next to him, Albus' hold on Draco's hand tightened.
!” he shouted at Bellatrix and Greyback, causing her wand to fly out of her hand. Potter, out of nowhere, seemingly returned to himself, lurched out from behind Draco and caught the wands. Weasley went again. “
“I will. But as a favour to me, could you somehow get word to my mother that I got out? That I’m safe?” he asked and Dobby gave him a solemn nod. Relieved, he squeezed past Dobby and opened the door.
“What’s going on?” he asked, stifling a yawn. Granger cast a look over her shoulder at him and adjusted in her seat, lifting the book that she was holding over her head to him. Draco took it and squinted at it.
“You were mistaken,” he said firmly, jerking the curtains closed again, his heart pounding in his chest. What else had Crabbe heard?
“Begging your pardon, Mr Malfoy,” Greyback said over the sounds of Bella grunting as she tried to break Father’s grip. “But it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold–”
“It’s Travers,” he told Hermione out of the corner of his mouth. “Second circle Death Eater. Works in the Ministry,” and she nodded her acknowledgement, stepping past him and offering one hand.
“Haven’t you found–?” he began to say but he was interrupted by a deep voice from the raised platform, taking over from McGonagall. Draco assumed this must be Kingsley Shackebolt, his expression carefully neutral. He was not a physically imposing man, though he was tall and strong-looking, but his presence seemed to draw all their attention in the Hall as he began to speak.
“Once someone has died, they can’t be brought back. It would be cruel to keep a spirit in this world,” he said quietly and Potter looked at him. His skin was turned pale from the dust covering him and his eyes stood out like jewels in the muted light of the tent. He turned away after a second.
“I’d better go,” Bill was saying to Ron, who nodded. “I won’t be long, an hour tops. If the goblin or Mr Ollivander wake up, let Fleur know will you?” he said and Ron nodded. Bill slipped out the front door, drawing the hood on his cloak up as he left. Draco dropped into the spare armchair and stared at the steaming tea in his hands.
“Lupin,” Bill muttered, sheathing his wand again and running for the front door. He wrenched it open against the howling winds and a man practically fell over the threshold. He was wrapped in a well-worn travelling cloak and when he lowered the hood, Draco could see he was pale beneath his greying hair. He looked shell-shocked and Draco took a second to reconcile this with the man who had once stood confidently at the front of a line of students and summoned them forward to face their worst fears.
“That’s... unexpected,” Malfoy said after a moment of silence and Harry nodded. It was, he agreed. He, like everyone else, was thoroughly sick of the Dark Arts and anything to do with them by the end of the War. But while he was helping Hogwarts being repaired, Harry spent a lot of his downtime in the library. It was quiet and had come out of the battle relatively unscathed, and he had wandered the shelves and picked up any books that caught his interest, and most of them had been about the Dark Arts. The more he read, the more fascinated he became, but not necessarily in the Dark Arts themselves, but by the context that surrounded them - the struggle for power, knowledge, glory.
“Do you miss it?” he asked, which made Potter jump a bit. The Snitch flew a little bit further out of reach, so Potter stood up and grabbed it, it’s tiny wings still fluttering between the gaps in his fingers, the pachment still held loosely in his other hand. He gave Draco a sheepish look and sat down again, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose, smoothing the parchment over his lap once more.
It wasn’t comfortable, by any means, Draco would reflect after. The bunched t-shirt under his head did little to cushion it as he pressed it to the floor when his back arched, he had a bruise on his hip after rolling over, and his knees had lines from the tiles underneath them as Harry leaned over him, breathing heavily between his shoulder blades.
“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemorts voice shook slightly with ecstasy. “I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!”
“I thought so. Nice to have a second opinion though,” she said, spinning the book back around to face her. She jotted down some notes on the parchment as her side and Draco shifted to look at the books laid out of her. Some were on the genealogy of wizarding families.
But he never finished. As if being controlled by some other force, Potter’s wand moved as if pulled on a string, pointing to the Dark Lord. It let out a burst of golden flame which crackled like lightning in the rushing air of the night. The spell, though it wasn’t one that Draco recognised, met with the tip of Lucius’ wand, still held in Voldemort’s hand and the wand fractured, split down the middle. Draco gaped at it – Father’s wand, destroyed.
“We don’t know what the questions will be. Besides, it’s a history paper - there’ll be one I can answer, I’m sure,” he said, and Hermione gave him a nervous smile. “Hermione, you know the Law better than most practising solicitors, I would imagine. You’ll be alright,” he said, reaching out a hand to pat hers comfortingly. “Shall I get us some drinks?” he asked and Hermione nodded, letting out a shaky breath.
"What…?" Harry asked confused, while the Aurors crowded into the room. Begbie looked just as perplexed as Harry felt.
“I don’t trust this,” he hissed to Granger, and she jumped a little at his voice but turned to look in his direction and nodded.
“Stand still, don’t move!” Hermione said just as Harry said “Okay, don’t touch anything!” desperately and Draco bared his teeth at them both.
“There’s someone over there. Someone watching us, I can tell. There, over by the bushes,” Granger said and Draco edged closer.
“He knows I’m after the Horcruxes – he’s keeping Nagini close beside him – obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing–”
Behind them, the Aurors were springing into action, some firing spells at the mirror, others alerting the Mediwizards on standby. Distantly, Harry could hear Hermione crying and Ron sniffling, but there were more important things to focus on, like his family before him. A bit battered and bruised, but finally whole.
Footsteps. More talk. Draco watched, deaf to it all, as Fenrir Greyback and the Carrows taunted and teased and all the while Dumbledore kept looking back at him, as if waiting for Draco to take the escape Dumbledore had offered him. He remained silent. And then Snape, appearing out of nowhere and Dumbledore turning to him and saying –
"And now, we have the Minister of Magic herself, Hermione Granger, here to make a statement on a new case that has come to light this afternoon. Minister?"
“Yes, I think she does,” he said firmly and Granger chewed her bottom lip for a second before nodding and stepping back.
"They shall find them, dear. I have the utmost faith in them, and you should as well," she told him and Harry gave her a nod, before covering his face once again.
“I studied History of the Dark Arts because…” and he hesitated. Could he verbalise what he felt about the subject. He could only try. “Because I spent most of my life as a sentient Dark Artefact. I was a Horcrux,” he said, shrugging one shoulder, striving for casualness. “And nothing I could find in the Hogwarts library could really explain what that meant,” he paused here, scanning the Fellows faces for signs that they understood what he was trying to say. He continued. “Horcruxes were mostly objects, they were
“Is it love, again?” Voldemort finally said after a long pause, his tone mocking. “Dumbledore’s favourite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the Tower and breaking like an old waxwork?” Draco flinched at the memory, glancing away. Hermione’s eyes were trained on Harry, as were Ron’s, and both of them looked as though they were trying with all of their might not to run to his side. Voldemort continued. “Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach. Potter – and nobody seems to love you enough to run forwards this time, and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?” he asked and Draco desperately wanted to shout out.
“It’s what Harry did to open the locket,” he said apologetically, taking in Draco’s horrified expression. “I had to have a few goes to get it right, but we got there in the end,” he said, shrugging modestly.
“That’s Lee Jordan!” Hermione said, frowning, her book slipping closed. Weasley turned to face her, elated.
Voldemort hissed in response, his eyes blazing, tracking Harry’s movements. “Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, and the crowd shifted. “This isn’t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?” Voldemort asked, and Harry shrugged one shoulder, his wand, Draco’s wand, held loosely at his side.
“A family trait is it, Malfoy?” he said mockingly and Draco forced himself not to flush with shame. “No matter. We can check. And you thought it’d be a laugh to let them say the Dark Lord’s name, did you?”
“With what, Bellatrix? Shall I fight fisticuffs like a damned Mudblood?” he slurred at her and he got up clumsily from the table and stumbled away, disappearing out into the corridor, even more broken than he had been before.
“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been travelling with Tonks, Cresswell and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news,” and Draco thought of Dean. While he had always felt the same indifference towards the Gryffindor that all Slytherins felt, he had admired Thomas’ art skills, albeit quietly. His hand drawn Lion banners were often the first thing that Draco saw on the Quidditch pitch, and he could only imagine how it bolstered the team. In the Great Hall, Thomas had often been smiling and laughing with Seamus Finnigan, his laughter loud enough to carry across the vaulted space. It had previously annoyed Draco and now he wondered if he would ever hear it again.
Harry woke up the next morning with a fuzzy mouth, a pounding head and the nagging thought that something weird had happened the night before. It took him a minute to remember that his hangover wasn't from a night out down the pub, but rather from Malfoy's unannounced turning up with wine. Bastard. He knew damn well that Harry and wine didn't mix well.
Not content with simply watching, Harry took his own penis in hand and stroked slowly, a whispered spell giving him the sleekness that he needed. Draco's hands sped up, and his shirt fell open, giving Harry his first glimpse of Draco's cock. Draco reached down to pull down his pants, and Harry gasped. He had never seen himself as a cockwhore before, but at the sight of Draco's springing from the tight pants, Harry wanted nothing more than to suck it, lick it and devour every inch of it.
“This is too hard!” he grumbled out loud, swiping a hand over the table and sending the contents flying onto the floor.
A very elaborate spell that cause Potter's robes to appear invisible only to himself was a favourite. Watching Potter walking around with all of his robes on at once was hilarious. I could hear him moaning about his robes to his rather confused friends until Granger figured out what was wrong and cancelled the spell.
Noticing Daphne and Ginny in the crowds, I tried to make my way over to them, but found myself unable to reach them. They smiled and waved, but that wasn't any help at all. I knew Hermione was due to give her speech not long after me, so I traipsed back into the thankfully cool Ministry to look for her. If nothing else, she usually kept quite good tabs on her husband. And where you'd find Weasley, Harry was surely not far behind.
“When have you ever asked for permission before?” Harry sat down and gestured for him to do the same. “Yes, sit.”
Harry was roused from his thoughts by Draco grabbing his hand and pulling him back towards the hotel.
My anger only surfaced when those same, frightened little first-years—who hadn't even become Slytherins until after the war had ended—were treated like dirt. That was just wrong. Luckily for me (and my impeccable behaviour record), Professor Sprout happened to overhear one such instance before I could intervene and took the matter straight to the headmistress.
Pansy huffed and stormed out to the back of the shop. Harry handed Draco his cuppa, and put a pecan pie on a plate for him, leaning over the counter for a quick kiss while he did so.
“Everyone. No one. It was just what I thought I had to do. And when we were partnered together and my feelings for you didn't go away...”
Once they were back at their house, Harry slammed the door behind them and pushed Draco up against it. “I would never—”
As Harry slid his hand into position, Draco smiled. “Perfect,” he said, before yawning loudly. “Sorry; I'm just going to close my eyes for a minute before we go down; it's been a long day.”
“So it's just a coincidence that one of the hottest nights of sex I've ever had is in print, word for word?”
Harry thought he might have broken his kneecaps with the speed at which he dropped to the floor. He didn't give a shit; he simply leaned forward until his nose was nestled in Draco's groin. Fuck he loved this; the smell of Draco invading his senses as Draco's cock hardened against his cheek.
When he finally stumbled to bed that night, Harry was dithering on whether Malfoy was actually telling the truth. Harry blamed the wine.
At first, Harry had had the insane thought that his glass had smashed as he toasted Draco, but a second loud smash threw that idea out of the window. Well, the space where the window should have been. The two large windows overlooking the gardens of the hotel were shattered, and scattered, over the far end of the dining room.
It soon became a regular thing. Either Harry or Draco would casually invite the other over, and they'd get together and talk. They'd talk about work, their children, they'd even talked about the war, albeit briefly. Even though they steered clear of the more personal subjects, Harry found he really enjoyed Draco's company and was glad to have him as a friend.
Harry hadn't heard his books described quite like that before, but he couldn't fault her. It was one of Steve and Anthony's favourite things to do. And Harry and Draco, but that was simply coincidental, if anyone asked.
“Do you remember what we agreed to do when we first got together?” Draco said, putting the book down.
Harry must be some sort of light-untangling genius, as it only took him a couple of minutes before he was busy draping the lights around the tree. Right, if he wasn't having a nap, Dog was definitely going to have some fun. Time for part two.
“Firstly, and most importantly, if you could bring your wands to the counter and place them in this box. Rest assured, it will be locked up securely; no harm will come to them and they'll be returned on your departure.”
His relationship with Draco wasn't perfect. They had arguments nearly every day, but it kept it interesting. Draco left a trail of destruction—clothes, towels, paperwork—wherever he went, but Harry didn't care. He had Kreacher to clean up after him. But they made sure to never go to bed angry with each other, and they loved to spend time together. Maybe it
“What are you doing?” Draco asked once they were out of the room. “I'm thirsty. I spotted pomegranate.”
It had been a month since Harry had written the letter, and his hopes were starting to slip. Draco must have either thrown it out without reading it, or—and Harry hoped it wasn't the case—he had read it and simply decided that Harry wasn't worth it.
Hermione smiled before reaching over and taking Harry's hand. “You're babbling. Calm down. It's just me.”
Draco wriggled free of Harry's grasp and tried to get up without waking him. What he needed was to have a wash and find some medicine for his head. The last thing Draco needed was for Harry to wake up in his arms again.
The guard didn't even smile. Great, Harry had finally found someone who wasn't awed by his fame. If he wasn't in a desperate rush, he'd have been ever so fucking grateful.
The first thing Draco noticed when he went into the usual room they used for the trust exercises was the lack of parchment and pens. He couldn't see any props at all. There weren't even any tables, just pairs of chairs dotted around the room.
“Enough!” Hermione shouted, standing on the coffee table to be heard over the din. “I don't think this is going to be resolved like this. We all have our own views and I don't think we're going to change anyone's mind. Tonight, anyway. Can we please just have a drink and talk about something else?”
After agreeing to talk privately, Harry had reluctantly followed Arthur into the garden. He was worried. Arthur had always treated him like one of his sons, but he was fiercely protective of Ginny.  Not knowing what was going to happen, Harry steeled himself and accepted the invitation into Arthur's shed, closing the door behind him.
By the time Harry arrived home, he was in two minds. One was that he had actually drunk too much and imagined everything, and the other was that Draco Malfoy from the future had actually tried to get him into bed.
Half an hour later, Harry was the proud owner of his very own tea shop. Or, as he preferred it to be called—for it sounded so much more manly—his very own café.
As Draco once more cradled Harry's face in his hands, Harry realised he was nervous, but he had no clue
Malfoy growled and Harry quickly kissed him again, moaning as Malfoy dropped his legs. “Where are you going?”
Hermione had tried to kiss Ron when she needed to go to the bathroom once, but it had fallen flat. Ron had assumed that she wanted to go back to the Burrow and
” had them naked where they stood. “I'm perfectly happy where I am,” Draco said with a wink, leaning back against the door.
Before he had torched the notes, Draco had caught a few words contained within. SORRY was quite clearly the overwhelming message, along with something about a dog, which confused him entirely.
Harry laughed. As he did so, he thought about the one thing missing from the evening: the awkward 'getting to know each other' first-date talk. Harry was so relieved; he never liked that part anyway. He and Draco already knew almost everything about each other. Background, family—although, that wasn't being discussed this evening, if Harry could help it—work, friends. The laughter and teasing were natural parts of their usual nights out. The talking, the laughing—it came easily; it was fantastic.
Quickly tuning fully back into the conversation, Draco tried to catch up on what he'd missed. Damn his over-active imagination.
Harry laughed, showering the table with biscuit crumbs. “Sorry,” he said, brushing them up. “And very funny. Come on, Malfoy. We have to meet the others at the pub.”
Lunch was a quiet affair for Harry and Draco. They had decided against eating outside, with Draco pleading too much sun for one day. Even with the lotion—and the reapplication that Harry insisted upon after an hour—Draco could feel his skin was a little tight and his nose was red.
After persuading Darius to agree to send the note—which didn't take much; he didn't have a better plan, no matter how much he thought about it—Hedwig took the love note to the Owlery and asked one of the school owls to take it to Draco, no questions asked. The fact that the little barn owl who they asked had the biggest crush on Hedwig (not that he had a chance. She had her beady eyes on someone else, thank you very much) helped immensely.
“Are you having a fucking laugh? I had a fucking relationship with Draco. I slept with him. Oh, fuck.” Harry slumped as the realisation hit him. “I slept with you. I was in a relationship with you. I—”
We still enjoyed spending time with our circle of friends and soon got used to being the 'It couple'. Whether it was a kiss or a fight, I was never surprised to find our weekend's activities posted on the front pages of the gossip magazines that Pansy always had littered around her living room.
Hedwig cleared her throat. Right. One day of Harry running about unobserved, that was nothing. They still had Arnold keeping an eye on Draco. They'd have heard if there was a problem. Mrs Norris wouldn't have stopped gloating.
Harry loved Draco. He knew that for a fact. He didn't want to lose him, not as a friend. That was what had started all the horrible business in the first place. He thought he could've had it both ways, and now he'd lost everything. An old saying kept popping into head: If it's too good to be true, it probably is.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry said, but Draco could see the smile he was carefully trying to hide. “Shall we test it out?”
Harry's hair had never looked so good. In the end, it had taken two bottles of the green goo and a rather drastic haircut, but the results were amazing. Instead of his usual 'wash and go' mop, he now sported a fetching 'shag and go' style. Harry liked it. Pansy had already promised to keep him supplied with the green goo.
Draco nodded and chanced a glance at Potter, thankful that he had the same confused look on his face.
Harry Apparated to Diagon Alley as he still didn't like travelling by Floo. If he was going to book a Muggle holiday, he would need some Muggle money. He walked as quickly as he could through the Alley but it wasn't quick enough.
I knew Harry was working on a big case and was glad he'd had a breakthrough, but I was  disappointed that it had to happen when I needed to speak to him nonetheless.
Dog tried to scuttle away from Harry, but he was much too slow. Before he had time to bark, Harry had the ribbon cut off and tied neatly around his neck in a quaint little bow. Dog was mortified. He was going to be the laughing stock of the bloody street.
“Yes,” Zach said, brushing the soot from his collar. “He had to run off to dinner. He said he'll owl you soon.”
The finger slipped from his hole, and Harry gasped. He pushed his arse back. He needed Draco; where had he gone?
But they were at a loss as to what to do with me, and others like me. Yes, I'd done some truly terrible things that would live with me for the rest of my life, but we—all us children of the bad guys—were not all bad. I'd have much preferred spending that last year of school pretending to study and playing Quidditch rather than what actually happened (not counting everything else, there was no Quidditch).
Harry awoke in much the same way as the previous morning. This time he didn't shy away from Draco, and snuggled closer to the warmth of his body instead. He felt arms tighten around him and a kiss placed into his hair.
“No!” Draco said quickly. “That was... good. It was, um, good. I just meant that if you can't even say the words, I don't think you want to be playing with them.”
Glinda crouched beside their seats and leant in closer. “I know you might think this might be a laugh and pointless because you're not actually a couple. But, please, do try; I think it might be of benefit to both of you and your professional relationship.”
his last boyfriend. At least his mother had talked to him; the silence he was experiencing was killing him.
“Seriously, what am I missing?” Draco asked the group at large. “I was under the impression it was badly written, unrealistic stories simply written to wet the knickers of middle aged women. Sorry, Ginny.”
Draco stepped forward. “No. You don't get to talk to him. If you like talking so much, why don't you tell everyone about that night?”
Draco smiled—or leered—at Harry's sudden attack of the nerves and advanced. Harry felt the soft lips touching his and relaxed.
As they drank their way through their illicit whisky, they chatted about inane topics, Draco fully aware that they hadn't actually talked to each other properly outside of their sessions. Draco laughed at Harry's insistence that the Cannons were finally on the up, and Harry made fun of Draco's toy collection. They stuck clearly to safe subjects, but Draco was just happy they were talking.
Once they were washed and undressed, they left Harry's room—towels in hand—and went for breakfast. They both stopped at the edge of the lobby at the sight of the policemen milling about. Harry hadn't forgotten what had happened the night before, their
Not bothering with clothes—he really was loving this naturist lifestyle—Harry grabbed a towel and made his way to the poolside. A quick swim before breakfast would be just what the healer ordered.
Harry hadn't even managed to take a sip of his drink before the door slammed open, and all of his friends poured into the pub.
Not that Ron didn't want Draco to be there, of course. He didn't, but that was besides the point. He simply wanted to spend some time with Harry.
so she sent him to Gerald for him to sort it out. He said that James and Scorpius might as well get their hair done at the same time. But I really think he just wanted to keep them out of trouble and he knows Gerald can handle them.”
One, Malfoy was in his house. As close as they'd become, Harry had never felt the need to invite Malfoy in for a cuppa. They usually just met at the pub.
“Of course I did! I tried everything to be an Auror. I did all the training; I passed all the tests. I threw my life into getting into the force. And then you were there, throwing insults at me and belittling me at every opportunity. What was I supposed to do?”
We talked about the night of Dumbledore's death. We talked about how you never wanted your mission. We talked about how desperately you wanted someone to save you.
Draco didn't know if he'd just been insulted or not. It wasn't said unkindly, though, so Draco let it go.
Harry laughed and leapt off the bed, changing into his pyjamas in seconds. Draco moved at a much more sedate pace, but before long they were cuddled into bed, for once under the covers and well aware of what they were doing.
“Nuh-huh.” Harry tried to get up and failed. “You can help me up off of this floor, and then you can pick all the splinters out of my arse.”
Harry wasn't embarrassed by what he wrote; on the contrary, he was very proud every time one of his books hit the shops and outsold every other book in the genre. He knew it wasn't very high-brow, or very well written, but it sold and sold well. He just didn't think Draco would appreciate the fact that every single one of the sex acts he wrote were taken directly from their bedroom.
Hermione's eyes took on a strange glint at his words. Harry raised his pint to Ron in thanks and waited for Hermione's next course of action.
Hedwig shook her head. Something was amiss, definitely. That note—as hot as it was—couldn't have worked so well, so quickly. And what about Harry's actual boyfriend—the intended recipient? Nope. They'd missed something big.
Whenever he and Hermione would be in Diagon Alley, Harry would point out one or two things that had caught his eye. He would owl Ginny magazines that
“I can't believe it worked,” Darius said, disbelief evident in his voice. He chirped happily. “It bloody worked.”
“Do you think you'll go back to the way you were before? With the fighting? Or can you work together?”
Draco, finally deciding on the gnocchi, looked up to see a look of pure disbelief on his boyfriend's face. “Harry? Are you okay?”
The loud cough from the next table caused Harry to rethink that. Maybe he could take being with Draco somewhere a little more private. Laughing, Harry and Draco once again reluctantly moved apart.
“Finally!” she cried when Harry had confirmed that Draco had asked him out. “Now, what time shall we come over?”
The only thing left to do was to face Malfoy. Quite frankly, Harry thought, he'd have preferred his WIMP test coming back positive.
Harry hated doing it; he didn't want to do it, but he felt he had no choice. Lifting his hand to his forehead, Harry pushed his fringe out of the way. “What about now?”
“You know, Malfoy,” he began, and I really didn't like the smug look on his face or the look of horror on Potter's. “You have spent an awful lot of time and energy on getting Harry undressed in the past few weeks. Even I can tell that you just want a good gawp, so why don't you just ask him out and save us all the drama?”
Harry laughed. “After the war and all that stuff was over, everyone—Ron, Hermione, all his family—assumed that I'd marry Ginny and have little red-headed babies. Well, everyone but Ginny did. She was happily off with Neville and didn't want any babies. And I didn't care. I expected to be upset, but I wasn't.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, grabbing some glasses off of the sideboard and pouring a glass for him and Draco. “Zach, would you like me to open your bottle for you?”
You smiled. You told me she was doing well. She was enjoying her garden and had taken to completely redoing the Manor. You told me how she was adamant that the Manor be a home again, after being a place of horror during the war.
Draco had been over to the elder Weasleys' house for dinner a couple of times since he and Harry had become a couple, and he had been amazed at the reception he'd received. Yes, there was the initial shock, but once Harry had explained how they had become close, Draco had been readily accepted by them. After a hearty round of good-natured ribbing from Ginny, of course.
Nodding to himself, Draco finished off his whisky and headed to bed. He was going on the bloody course and it was going to be worth it. He was nervous, yes, and irritated that he
Harry stopped dead. It wasn't the familiar face of Hermione sitting in front of him. Instead, it was the much more familiar face that he had spent months upon months loving, kissing, and, finally, trying to forget.
Hedwig and Darius didn't want to turn around. They were already trying to think of the best way to get rid of the stench of lake water from their feathers.
'; he just didn't want to go. Hearing footsteps on the stairs, he banged his head against the wood. He briefly thought about Apparating out of the room, but stopped when he realised that she would probably find him. She always did.
I couldn't bring myself to knock on the door and disturb you. You looked to be having fun with your friends. I didn't want to intrude. Excuses, excuses, I know.
“No. I'm not finished. And you'd better be glad that Hermione had a meeting this morning. You could have had it all back, Harry. What the fuck did you do?”
At first, it had been easy to ignore Potter's attentions, but I had noticed my reactions had shifted. For example, when I'd try to paste my usual smirk on my face when Potter said hello to me in the hallway, and I'd sometimes simply forget and smile back. Or when I'd laugh accidentally at one of his stories in Charms. I'd cover it up, of course, by making a good snide comment about one of his friends.
“Just for today,” his colleague had answered. “The boss says to show a presence; I don't think he cares much either. Bunch of freaks.”
Glinda smiled. “You're more than welcome. Here,” she said, reaching into her pocket, “you'll probably need these to pack.”
Hermione stood up suddenly, causing the group to jump. “No, he wouldn't!” she said as she ran to the fireplace.
As they walked, Harry's budged Draco gently in the side before entangling their fingers together. Harry loved the feeling of
So, the only communication between Ron and Harry was owls—and the surprisingly fast Muggle post; Hermione dealt with the fiddly stamps—so Ron could easily be forgiven for misreading things.
Draco had gone back to Hogwarts in order to get what qualifications he needed to enlist, the same as Potter. He'd survived the gruelling boot camp, the same as Potter (even after being told, in no uncertain terms, that he wasn't welcome). Draco had taken, the same as Potter, every test the Ministry had thrown at him. Unlike Potter, Draco had also taken some 'extra' tests levelled just at him. And, unlike Potter, he'd passed every single one with flying colours.
Harry couldn’t wait any longer; he slid down the bed and buried his face between Draco’s arse cheeks.
Dog was stropping on the sofa as Harry unpacked the nativity scene from its box. He'd tried and tried to get the ribbon off his neck, but to no avail. Maybe Harry was a genius with knots. He could untangle lights in seconds and, apparently, could tie strong knots too.
Harry debated calling in sick the following morning. He hadn't slept well again, and the last thing he wanted to do was listen to Malfoy's tales of his night with Monsieur Nice Hair.
An idea popped into Draco's head suddenly, and he didn't waste a second in conveying his apologies to the group. No one could dismiss a prior engagement in Swansea with a potential wormroot supplier, after all.
'Oh, fuck' was the prevailing thought as Potter kissed me back. There was nothing else for it. I fancied—I liked Harry Potter.
He listened to Ten explaining how he wanted One to feel more secure in their relationship, and be safe in the knowledge that he loved her. In return, he listened as One asked Ten to stop obsessing over his looks and physique, and that he was perfect and didn't need improving.
Draco, knowing what to expect this time, was completely prepared for dinner. Harry had suggested a quick swim after the afternoon session, but Draco had declined and instead they settled for a quick walk around the grounds. He and Harry were going to be first to dinner, and that was the end of it. Draco didn't even change his clothes.
Ron wasn't wrong. Harry wasn't moping about. Far from it; he was out socialising quite often, meeting up for drinks after work and the like, but being the only singleton of the group, when his friends starting drifting home to their other halves, he'd just end up tagging along with Ron.
Harry knew it wasn't Draco's fault. Hermione though, she was getting a Howler first thing in the morning. For now, Harry would just have to make the most of having Draco at home.
. He let Malfoy's wet fingers undo all the annoying little buttons on his soaked through Quidditch kit. He let Malfoy strip him completely. He didn't care as his wand clattered to the floor. He certainly didn't care when his pants joined it and Malfoy's hand wrapped around his rapidly hardening cock.
Tuning out Hermione's ramblings over how to get Harry to meet them for dinner, Ron instead thought back to what he and Harry had done for fun before he'd buggered off to the other side of the world.
Dog was just dozing off when a tremendous bang had him falling off the sofa and growling at the door.
And then all hell broke loose. Broken out of his stupor, Ron lunged forward, Hermione's quick reflexes the only thing keeping him from strangling Malfoy. Or Harry, for that matter.
“Huh, course,” Harry mumbled, sitting up in bed slightly. “Morning,” he said to Glinda, who had walked in at Harry's agreement.
Harry reluctantly did as he was asked, grateful that his fame at least let him jump the queue; thankfully there were still some witches and wizards who knew who he was. As soon as he had his wand returned to him, Harry took off towards the lifts at a run.
As soon as the door was shut behind them, Harry removed their Disillusionment Charms and pulled Draco in for another kiss. Harry sighed happily as they fell to the bed; it was so much more comfortable than their first kiss. It was passionate and heated and perfect. Harry stopped for a breath and rested his head on Draco's shoulder.
“Oh,” Harry whispered back, putting his wand away. Harry was at a loss for what to do; should he fight or run for help? His decision was made when another kick was aimed at Grumpy Waiter. “OI!” he shouted, gaining the attention of the attackers.
Dog looked behind Harry and raised his ears in surprise. Sure enough, three huge boxes were trailing behind him, one with a tell tale smashed-in corner. His tail wagged before he could stop it. He wasn't an idiot (like a certain cat who shall remain nameless), he wasn't excited for the boxes themselves. No, it was what was poking out of the broken corner that interested Dog.
“I meant here, in Britain. Are you moving ho—back?” Harry shook himself. “Are you finished in Croatia as well?”
“What do you want to do tonight?” Draco asked, flopping back onto his bed. “I don't want to sit in here all night.”
Harry enjoyed his lunch at Ron and Hermione's. Ginny and Neville popped in as well, and it turned into a nice, pleasant afternoon, with no—or very little—thoughts of Malfoy or his future self. Hermione explained—after berating Harry about running himself into the ground—that she was grateful that he had cried off the night before as it gave her the chance on catching up on some paperwork. Ron had blushed at this, and Harry had the distinct—and very much unwanted—thought that her idea of paperwork was much,
That was also the day that something else changed, and I didn't know at the time whether it was for the better or not.
I didn't even get a chance to think about talking to you before you left. Severus' body hadn't even been lowered fully into his grave before you shuffled off, the click of a dozen cameras heralding your exit.
“I don't know,” Harry answered honestly. Aunt Petunia's views on divorce had nothing on Uncle Vernon's views about homosexuality, so it hadn't even entered his head to think that that was what it was.
Harry forced himself to return Malfoy's smile before running into the bathroom. He felt the need to throw up. Of course he should feel guilty, he berated himself. What the fuck was he doing, running about with some future man and probably ruining any chance he ever had with the man he—realising it to be the truth—actually wanted? How did he ever think that it was a good idea?
As the clock struck seven, Harry steeled himself as much as he could and Flooed straight into the pub. He was expecting balloons and streamers, maybe some wine or beer handed to him as he exited the fireplace. He wasn't expecting a half empty pub, with no Ron, Hermione or any of his friends. There were just a few of the regulars potted around the pub, and Tom, as usual, behind the bar.
. And it simply couldn't wait until later; once Harry had his mind set on something, it had to be done, preferably sooner rather than later.
“Nothing to lose,” Harry said and Draco, not for the first time, wondered about his Occlumency skills.
Harry cut him off with a kiss; he found it quite effective. Harry had had enough of misunderstandings and his own wandering thoughts and decided to act instead.
Harry carefully opened his front door and sighed in relief when Homenum Revelio revealed him to be alone. Not completely alone, a small mewing at his feet reminded him.
We talked about how they tried to put you in prison with your father. You thanked me—quiet and stuttering—for speaking up for you. How could I not? You weren't like the rest of the Death Eaters. I knew that. I couldn't miss it. I was there when you refused to identify me in the Manor. Anyone else—they would've gleefully told the noseless bastard I was me, but you didn't. You wouldn't.
Harry scoffed and barged him gently with his shoulder. “Yeah, right. What we need is some breakfast.”
“What is it?”' Draco asked, leaning over to try and look into her bag. “Never seen you so engrossed in something that wasn't a fashion magazine.”
They had only been together for a matter of months when the first article appeared. It was—predictably—
Both Harry and Draco decided that they had worked bloody hard while they'd been at the retreat and, as such, deserved a good, hard, drink. Draco even managed to get Harry to change into a shirt before they ventured down to the bar. Draco was slightly apprehensive about going to socialise, as they hadn't met them the night before, but he didn't want to spend another night with only his books for company, and he really did fancy a whisky.
Not that he didn't want to go, of course. He didn't, but that was besides the point. He simply wasn't invited.
The tour was quite short, and extremely boring. Draco's earlier assumptions about the size of the main house were almost spot on. The ground floor held different sized therapy rooms, with a dining hall—already set out with tables for two—leading into more gardens through French doors.
Pansy had come into the shop one day, not long after he had re-opened, hoping to apologise for her actions in the Great Hall before the final battle. She was very insistent and refused to leave until she'd apologised properly. Harry had snapped that if she was truly sorry, she'd get her arse behind the counter and help him out. She truly was, so she did. And she never left. It was a running joke between the two of them that one day, Harry would finally accept her apology and she could go and get a 'proper job'.
Draco's shirt covered his groin, but Harry could see the outline of Draco's cock straining against the white material. Harry had never felt so horny in all his life. Draco started undoing each button of his shirt in turn, and Harry didn't know whether to tell him to speed up or just sit back and enjoy watching each inch of Draco's chest being uncovered bit by bit.
“Harry, please!” Ginny's voice was quiet and whiny; Harry knew what was coming next. “You promised me. I can't go to this thing on my own! They're going to laugh at me. Please, you promised Nev you'd look after me. He's away looking for his seeds, and I'm here all on my own.”
“Well, to be honest, since about two hours ago. Before then, obviously, but I only realised after the treasure hunt that I missed you. After an hour or so of being apart, I missed you. I realised all that we have together and what I would miss out on if you weren't there. Also, the whole sunscreen thing was quite hot.”
It wasn't long before the three of us were laughing at the absurdity of it all. Relief washed over me and I finally calmed down.
Dog was bored. He couldn't believe it. Usually, he couldn't get two minutes to himself. Either Harry or Draco would be stroking him, playing with him or walking him. Maybe one of his friends would be home and he'd have to put up with their annoying antics. His favourite was the little one. Teddy would play for hours with him and Dog knew exactly how to get what he wanted from him.
“No one is to leave here from the moment the course officially starts until Monday, after you have completed the therapy. This is final, barring a medical emergency. You are all bound to follow the course as set out in your itinerary.”
Forcing himself to move, Harry decided on a soak in the bath to relieve his aches and pains. He went into the bathroom and turned on the taps before starting his usual morning routine. The fact that it looked to be mid-afternoon meant nothing to him.
Darius shook her off. “What do you care about rules? And you can't imagine we could succeed in this? I mean, it's those two. How many nasty notes have we had to deliver about either one of them?”
“We need to have something to tell Bob tonight,” Darius said. “Meet me back here in after your delivery and we'll see what we can do. You two,” he said to Arnold and Pig, “stay with Harry and Draco. We'll let Bob know where you are.”
I rambled on about anything I could think of. I talked about quidditch. I talked about what I was up to. I talked about the aurors. I talked about recent cases. I asked what you were up to. I asked about your life.
I'm in love with him... and I'm selfish enough to choose him over what I deserve. I can't give him up.
"First you, now George. Everyone I love is ending up with Slytherins." Ron sighs, looking highly put upon. "Next, Pansy Parkinson will confess her undying love for Hermione with the way this is going."
At some point, the woman has me drink a potion that slows down my heart rate. It helps me breathe. The tears slow down.
"I thought mother... Vin... poison?" That should have been a shout. I should have been screaming. Everything hurts. My head hurts. It's hard to speak.
"On the contrary, Harry has leveled a very serious accusation against you. I am allowed to hold you both here until it is sorted out." Kingsley flicks his wand again and a piece of parchment appears on his desk.
Harry fumbled for his wand, but was distracted immediately. Malfoy's body suddenly went rigid, his eyes squeezing shut. Harry cupped his face in his bloody hands, a fresh wave of panic shooting through him.
"It's what we call it when two magical people are extremely compatible. Their magic intertwines. One sign of it is they can use each other's wands easily."
Yes. Up until a few days ago, Draco has been struggling with a severe heart condition. An aftermath of the war and being a prisoner at his own home. In my position as a healer at St. Mungos, I have been treating him in the beginning. I admit that my feelings for him began to grow during that time but when I realised my feelings for him might cloud my judgement or compromise my objectivity, I made sure to hand all responsibility regarding his potions and treatment to Hermione.
Harry's squeezing my hands so tightly, his knuckles have gone white. I rub the back of his hands with my thumbs until he relaxes.
I hadn't even thought about it for decades until I came across it in one of my wandlore tomes when I was trying to figure out why Harry and I can use each other's wands.
It would be so much easier to give up... to let the curse take my life. I deserve this. I have hurt people... people have died because of me.
I take another bite of bread. I will never say so aloud, but she's right. Ever since I was a child, I loved my hair being brushed. My mother used to stroke my hair to soothe me to sleep and whenever I cried.
Malfoy's face surfaces in my memory. I let myself remember how he made me feel as he laughed and healed my sting. I remember how he gripped my hand when we apparated to his cottage. I remember how he made sure I slept after I had a fight with Anthony. Malfoy has treated me with more kindness and compassion than my boyfriend ever has.
There's a brown haze here too. This is the only other traumatic thing I can remember happening that week. I hope it's done after this. I close my eyes to steady myself.
Hearing about all of the abuse Goldstein put Harry through is enough to make my blood boil. I stay silent as Harry speaks, letting him get it all off his chest.
My cheeks heat as my father's gaze flicks to me. I really don't want to be having this conversation. Then, something registers in my mind. Harry said he loves me. I want to pull Harry into a kiss. I also want to demand to know if he meant it… and I want my father to not be here for either of those things.
My stomach roils as Harry heaves an exasperated sigh and says, "will you stop nagging me if I say yes?"
Then, a man appears. He's holding Harry's invisibility cloak. The man is vaguely familiar. I think he was in Ravenclaw in my year. Goldstein?
When I look up, Lucius Malfoy is in the doorway. I've never seen Lucius look so... unkempt. His hair is all over the place and his robes look... wrong... like they're too big for him.
Flying? Harry resisted the urge to rub his eyes. Draco had wings. Long, pearly white wings. Their eyes met. Silver and emerald. Draco was glowing. Everyone else seemed to freeze and Harry realised this was the first time they were seeing Draco as a veela.
When I was released from Azkaban, howlers and hate mail showed up at my mother's place for me a month. People were pissed that a Death Eater was released from Azkaban after only a few months.
"It is for me," Harry says quietly, looking so earnest I can't help but believe him - not that I think he would lie, but marrying this man sounds like a fairy tale.
"Nothing. I'll be completely fine." While I know he's lying, Draco's voice sounds confident enough that Faye reluctantly lets Ginny pick her up.
"Yeah. Bill came by while you were sleeping. The curse is broken." I hesitate for just a moment. "You are the bravest man I know. I can't even imagine how terrible that was for you, but you still kept going until it was done."
I grab his wand and conjure a blanket and pillow. I'm surprised his wand responds to me, but I don't question it right now. I shove the pillow behind his head as the blanket settles over him.
He reluctantly taps the paper with his wand. The shimmering turns orange. Kingsley waves his wand over it and it returns to looking like a normal piece of parchment.
My father looks so startled at being addressed so familiarly, I have to hold back a laugh. Luna links her arm with his and tugs him out of the room. Ginny smiles at them deviously.
Yanking him back against my chest by his hair, I suck a dark hickey on the pale column of his neck. Draco arches his back, whining as he clenches around me.
I press one last kiss to his forehead, unable to help myself. I gently lower him until he's laying on the bed and cover him with a blanket.
Ginny is right behind her, an expression of disbelief crossing her face. I think she didn't quite believe that I'm in a relationship with Draco until now. I can't say I blame her. If someone had told me a few months ago that I would be dating Draco Malfoy and cuddling with him in Malfoy Manor, I would have examined them for head injuries.
Hermione places her dark hand on mine. My skin looks paler than usual in contrast... or maybe that's an effect of being poisoned.
"My aunt Petunia. Before you ask, no, they didn't care if I left the house. They never have." Harry shrugs, linking our fingers together.
I look back down, my laughter dying. Potter's hand appears in my line of sight. He's holding the handkerchief. I take it in confusion, blinking up at Potter.
Bill runs his fingers through his red hair. "The reason I'm here is I'm a curse breaker. Hermione thought it would be a good idea if I tried to figure out which curse we're dealing with."
Blinking, Harry looks at the mirror as well. His cheeks turn a lovely shade of red. "Right. Uh, next memory?"
Releasing my hand, Draco takes a few steps towards Nagini. The snake swings her head around, almost like she is actually here. That isn't possible. She can't really be here. This is a memory. A cursed memory.
"Hermod is at my house. Send a letter with him if you find them or if you hear anything about Draco."
"Believe me, I'm not blasé. This just isn't new to me. I've already lived it. As a kid, I never understood why they hated me so much. It was lonely and awful."
I gasp for breath and stare around the spare bedroom in Pansy's flat, trying to get my bearings. I barely hear her. She seems to realize that I'm not listening. She takes the bottle back and presses it to my mouth instead.
"I'm pretty sure I have. I mean... I have had a crush on him for years... but now I really want to punch him and then snog him again."
Blaise winks at her before blowing a kiss to Draco. A spark of irritation flashes through me, but I brush it off. Ginny snickers behind her hand, no doubt catching my brief jealousy.
Harry, fully dressed in my clothes which are too long on him, is cooking with Minty in the kitchen. He calls a cheerful greeting to her.
I feel Harry's lips press against my forehead. I smile and look up at him. Harry's been kissing me a lot since the day we talked about being together. It's always chaste. Little kisses all over my face. My nose, eyelids, cheeks, chin, eyebrows, and forehead have all been graced by Harry's lips.
I nod and watch him go. Once the door closes behind him, I take a breath and look my father in the eyes.
"Well... my respect for you has just skyrocketed." Ron sounds winded. "How the hell are you so strong in your condition?"
The bread is delicious. It's filled with seeds, I think. I bite down on it and chew it slowly. I hadn't realized how hungry I was until now. Still, I know better than to eat too quickly after a panic attack.
After I take the second potion, I eat an early breakfast with my mother. She's still worried, I can tell, but she doesn't say anything. She goes out into the garden when breakfast is over and starts cutting flowers. I don't know the names of all of the flowers. They're all gold and mother of pearl. She makes two bouquets, the irises at the center of them.
Being this honest with my father is new to me, but seeing Harry in my childhood home has torn down all my walls. It wasn't just seeing him here in the place of my nightmares. It was how gently he had held me and kissed me. It was hearing him say he loves me. I have nothing left to keep myself in check.
I hear a door open behind me and turn. A goblet with a shimmering pink steam emitting from it floats out with Luna trailing behind it. Her face is uncharacteristically grim, as if she's determined to break the curse single-handedly if she has to.
Ginny has the decency to look ashamed. She runs her fingers through her ginger curls as she takes a deep breath.
"I'm not worried about my father finding out I'm gay. I'm worried because I don't want him to find out who I'm in love with," I mutter.
I run my hands down his back soothingly and rest my cheek on his head. The next memory starts and I hug Harry tighter to me. We're in a bedroom.
"Maria didn't die,” my Draco begins to speak with a soft voice. “I saw her after the battle, looking like a corpse, but still alive. I think she was tortured for information that she never gave up. Otherwise they would have killed her." His voice sounds hollow as he watches the girl being dragged away.
I tune them out, trying to focus on my own book. I haven't studied this much since my N.E.W.T.s. The words seem like they're blurring together.
A sweet flush crosses over his face before he swallows and shucks off his joggers and pants with one swift movement. Something short circuits in my brain when I'm faced with my fully naked, very aroused boyfriend.
"I don't know. I haven't read it yet," Ginny huffs. "Blaise showed us the photos and headline and we rushed here."
"You know, for a guy with such a big heart, you sure are a dick," Potter mutters, conjuring a handkerchief.
"This curse sounds poetic," my aunt's voice says, sounding a little dreamy. "It will kill him by preying on his heart. And we get to torture him like the little traitor deserves."
"We are all here for you." Pulling away, she cups my face in her hands. "Now, on a lighter, but still serious note, ask Hermione if it's safe for your heart to have sex."
My mouth falls open. Harry's eyes flick down to my lips, but he doesn't lean in like he did when we were at my cottage. He seems to be waiting for something.
There's a soft pop and the butterbeer is replaced with a firewhiskey. I smile a little and down the drink. "Speaking of, I almost kissed Draco Malfoy tonight."
"That… that's fair. I was pretty spoiled and cruel," I acknowledge, feeling a little guilty. The whole time we went to school together, I made it my goal to make him and his friends miserable. I added to the hurt he had already experienced… and all because I was jealous and angry at him for snubbing my friendship. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize."
"His heart," the Dark Lord says softly. There is the sound of a page being torn out of a book. "I like the sound of that.
The barrier lets me through. The gate opens under my hand. When I look up at the manor, I see a few rooms are lit.
Watching myself crumple to the floor, I feel the rush of panic through my body. I hold the petrified wood my mother gave me tightly. The familiar thrum of my family's magic pulses against my fingers. It's soothing.
Potter looks mildly upset, but he doesn't say anything. I nervously turn my gaze to my father. At least he doesn't look mad. He just seems shocked.
"Maybe. You get this look on your face when you're thinking self-deprecating things." His knuckles brush down my cheek. "So, I think I can guess where your mind is going right now. I want you to know, I am glad you're my soulmate. You're a good person. I am happier around you and more at peace than I've been since the end of fourth year."
I hold back a sigh and start pulling on my clothes and shoes. "I promise I won't go anywhere a Death Eater might find me."
"Just sign it. I never want to see you again, Anthony. Nothing will ever make me love you again." I roll my eyes.
"What reasons might those be?" It was Draco who broke eye contact, his gaze falling to Harry's lips.
Harry rolls his eyes, looking both fond and exasperated. "I'm entirely sure about that. Are you ready to see the rest of my memories?"
with that curse in sixth year. I forgive your past. I forgive you for everything you did while you were a kid."
I see him. I see Harry. He is leaving the stairwell. He looks exhausted, but I can't see any signs of a fight.
"You were a little shit, yeah… but you regret it now and I know you've tried to make amends for it. You're not the same person you were when you were a kid."
Isn't that how stories are told? Fight the bad guy, be the hero, live happily ever after in love? After everything he had been through, some part of him really believed he would get a happy ending.
I fix my glasses and stand up stretching. I feel a lot more refreshed than I should after napping in an armchair... with someone I used to consider a threat in the same room. "Yeah, okay."
I suppress a sigh. He won't stop until I try it. So, I sit down across from him and carefully taste the soup. I immediately spit it out. It reminds me too much of marsh water.
Whoever impersonated Lucius is long gone. I fight the instinct to chase after him. I have to check on Draco first.
When the mark and flowers meet, there is faint light. It's almost like the flowers are trying to break the curse, but can't quite manage it. I force myself to move forward. Squeezing my mother's talisman in my hand, I reach out and push through the flowers into the mark.
I glance at Potter. He has that look on his face again, like me beekeeping has shaken his world view. I roll my eyes. "Very observant."
It was like Draco instinctively knew just how to touch him to cause the most pleasure. He knew where to lick to have Harry trembling. Apparently, one of those places was in Harry's arse.
The door opens gently and a figure steps in. I assume it's my healer. I hear him cast the wand lighting charm.
A hand pulls my hair back. Another hand starts rubbing my back. I know it's Bill, even if I can't face him.
"I'm not sure. I thought it meant pensieve. Either way, Draco is refusing to do it. He doesn't want anyone to see his memories." I rub my hands over my face, willing all my exhaustion away.
He's alright. He's alive and breathing and here. I go to him. Relief floods me as I take his face in my hands.
I remember this so clearly. I had had to torture so many students that year. I had tried to call on that, to remember the hatred and necessity to inflict suffering. Even the memory of what had happened to Faye when I didn't follow instructions doesn't stir the feeling I need. Nothing happens. The curse fails.
When I'm finally free of the little ones, I turn to Potter. "We can get going now. This lot will be fine until I come back."
Draco looked faintly startled, but a grin broke out on his face. He kissed his way down Harry's neck, murmuring something Harry couldn't understand. It sounded like French.
I'm holding Draco tightly to my chest, shaking my head. "No. Draco didn't want to go there. If he is stable, there's no need. Mione, do the spells?"
"Mm… well, I'll be ready for another go soon enough." Draco pulls me down to kiss him. "Until then, I should prepare you, right?"
"I'm not looking for another alpha," he said, pushing himself up and grabbing his glasses so he could see Draco clearly. "If my fate really does lie in my hands, you can't have any objection if I decide to woo you, right?"
"What the hell are you doing?! You can't just tie people up like this! You can't hold me against my will!" Anthony spits.
The next year was one of the worst years of Harry's life. Draco's task was to kill Dumbledore. Even though he didn't go through with it, Dumbledore still died. Harry had encouraged Draco to complete his task… and there hadn't been time after to talk to his mate before he disappeared.
"He went to the manor. Something about wanting to go home and freshen up. Luna is at the chateau taking care of your mother with Ginny. " He sets the book aside.
Yoga on land was frustrating for me. I couldn't bend my body the way Luna could. Eventually, Luna suggested we try yoga underwater, where I was already calm and wouldn't have gravity working against me.
“He got himself killed, that’s what he did! And his parents didn’t set him up for failure, didn’t make their son pay for his
“Like ‘ell you are,” Scabior said and the other Snatchers laughed. “We know Stan Shunpike. ‘E’s put a bit of work our way,” and Greyback smacked Weasley around the face. Weasley coughed and spat blood to the floor.
"I don't think he counted on these boys being so stubborn," Hermione said quite proudly, glancing over at the hospital beds where the boys were asleep. Albus had fallen asleep as soon as his head had touched the pillow, while Scorpius had taken longer to settle, jerking awake with a start a few times before finally drifting off.
A great silver stag came trotting from the end of Potter’s wand, nearly blending into the snow on the ground. It huffed, sending plumes of silver smoke into the air and pawed at the ground, its antlers wide and tall. Potter looked at it with obvious affection and the stag merely blinked slowly at Draco before melting back into nothing.
Her face fell and she murmured something to Ron who looked stricken. Ron beckoned him over and he went to join them, feeling weighed down with the horror of the night.
“No, I’ll stay and watch,” and he leaned against the stone garden wall and waited while Potter dug a grave.
“The summer before Seventh year,” Draco admitted, his eyes still bright and his cheeks flushed. He settled back in his chair, his hands folded neatly in his lap. “I had become… disillusioned by then. I wanted to prove them wrong. And I did,” he said proudly and Harry grinned at him.
"Well, you seem to have misplaced our sons," he said by way of an explanation and Harry made a pained sound. Malfoy's expression softened, and then Ron was there, behind Harry, and Malfoy frowned at him. "Weasley," Malfoy greeted and Ron nodded curtly.
“Next time, maybe,” Harry promised and they shuffled awkwardly from the Great Hall, though no one was looking at them.
“Harry, don’t be ridiculous!” Hermione said in exasperation, rolling her eyes. “The Resurrection Stone doesn’t exist,
“We need to get to Hogwarts,” Draco heard himself say and Ron gaped at him. Hermione knelt next to Harry, worrying her bottom lip, and she darted a glance at Draco.
“I know, mate,” said Ron dumbly, without a hint of regret. “So it’s now or never, isn’t it?” he added with a grin and Draco pinched the bridge of his nose.
They sat there for a while longer, watching the snow drift lazily down, and then Draco stood and got ready for the day. He was just brushing his teeth when Potter woke up, opening his eyes and looking over at Draco with a lazy smile. Draco tried not to choke on his toothpaste and disappeared back into the bathroom to finish. By the time he came out, Potter was out of bed and making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen.
The only person Draco hadn’t really spoken to was Harry, who seemed to slip out of the room as soon as he could at every chance. Draco was stung by it, haunted by the memory of the kisses they had shared in the Rustic Temples, but he tried to ignore the ache in his heart.
“Roast beef,” he said with something like relief and then he stood and leaned over the fire to give Draco the paperbag back. As he did so, their hands touched and Draco nearly dropped the paperbag into the fire, it felt like he had been hit with a Stinging Jinx. If Potter felt something, he didn’t say it. Draco gave him a smile as he sat back down and fished out the final sandwich inside was turkey and cheese, Draco’s favourite.
“Is that all we’re going for? To look for this sword?” Draco asked and Potter stiffened a little, threading his hands together in his lap. Even Granger looked a little uncomfortable.
The headstone was only two rows behind where they had found Kendra Dumbledore, and Draco approached carefully behind as Potter came to stand in front of it. It was made of white marble, and it seemed to shine in the dark. Draco read the inscription;
“Did you know what he did, Baron?” Draco asked, turning to follow the ghost as it swept past him. The Baron sighed.
“There’s some… well, there’s some intense stuff in there. I didn’t think it’d be something you’d be interested in reading,” he said and she frowned at him.
“I love him,” he said aloud and Dumbledore beamed at him. “He makes me happy. I think I make him happy too. I hope… I hope I can be good enough for him. I don’t know if I’ve done enough to be worthy,” he said quietly, the weight of his past sins weighing heavily on him. “Sir?” he asked, and Dumbledore made a small noise of acknowledgement. “Was it enough? Everything I did – was it enough?”
,” Travers explained delicately. Hermione snorted derisively, as if dismissing this gossip entirely.
“In the forest. The day we got caught by the Snatchers,” he said matter-of-factly and Hermione patted Harry’s hand (because he had to be Harry now, he could no longer be Potter) where it was fisted around the goblet.
for some remorse.” Harry sounded genuine. He sounded like he truly wanted Voldemort to find some redemption within himself. Draco knew the search would be unfruitful.
“Focus! What about the Horcrux?” he snapped and Hermione slipped out of Ron’s arms and began gathering the fangs, her cheeks pink.
“It’s your one last chance,” Harry said, “It’s all you’ve got left. I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise… be a man… try…
He hadn't moved straight back in to Grimmauld Place, which he and Harry had agreed on soon after the boys had gone back to Hogwarts (only a week and a bit later than planned, and escorted by Aurors the whole way). He had moved back to London, though, and rented a flat for six months in Peckham, and then after his lease had ended, he had moved into a spare room at Grimmauld Place. And then one day, which hadn't been a very special day at all, he had woken up in Harry's bed in the morning, and went to sleep in it that night, and hadn't slept anywhere else since.
“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus, let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and the
His whole body felt like it was in turmoil. His head was pounding and his mouth was dry, his heart was racing and the muscles in his legs twitched with unspent adrenaline, and every nerve was shrieking at him to go and find his children - to find them and rescue them and then kill the bastard that dared to even think about taking them from him.
One of the Death Eater hoods fell back and Draco frowned – he didn’t recognise the face. But Potter seemingly did and he shouted “
“Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him,” she said firmly and Weasley gave her a confused look while Potter just blinked.
“No,” she said firmly, getting to her feet. Goyle still lay in the middle of the corridor, his chest rising and falling but his eyes open and unseeing. “Let’s stick together. I say we go – Harry, what’s that on your arm?” she asked, pointing, and Harry jerked and looked down.
They turned a corner and ahead of them was the end of the passage. Draco picked his way down the short flight of steps behind Harry, and then Longbottom pushed open the door and climbed through. As Harry followed, Draco could hear Longbottom shout ahead of him “Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”
Harry pulled his wand out of his inner jacket pocket and thought hard for a happy memory - the day the boys had been born. Squalling, pink, green eyes and dark thatches of hair, his beautiful sons.
"Don't “Harry' me! Don't use that tone of voice! They're - they're going to be fine, we'll find them, we have to - we have to find them, I don't," and he clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle the rising urge to scream. Malfoy looked alarmed and stood up too, moving to stand next to Harry, a hand on his shoulder.
“Ron, catch – and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to Weasley, who snatched it from the air as Dobby leapt forward. Potter seized Draco’s arm, and Draco held tight to the goblin and the sword as Dobby wrapped a bony-fingered hand around his other upper arm and began to drag him through time and space.
“Dobby does not know where Harry Potter is, Master Draco,” Dobby said firmly in his squeaky voice and Draco sagged a little bit, feeling defeated. Dobby studied him with a frown. “Why does Master Draco want to know?” he asked and Draco ran a hand through his hair.
“It is polite to knock, Draco,” Snape told him monotonously but Draco ignored him and took his seat again. “I just wanted to tell you Draco, that if you should ever find yourself in need, my door will always be open to you,” he said somewhat imperiously and Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Where are you?” Draco asked again, on his knees, as Potter noticed him. Potter gave him a half-smile, the corner of his mouth quirking upwards. “Please, just tell me. It’s… it’s cold. I’m scared,” Draco admitted and Potter’s eyes slid away. The landscape of Alice Holt faded and oak trees sprang up around them as Potter turned in a slow circle. Draco looked around, trying to recognise the place.
“You, yes, of course – Dora quite agrees, no one better–” Lupin was saying and Potter grinned at him, stepping back and raising a hand to rub at his hair.
I was treated the way I was as a child,” one of the Fellows sniffed and Harry caught her discreetly wiping her eyes. He leaned back in the chair, spreading his hands wide. “I think my fascination with History, in
She did the same to Weasley, though he only frowned, not experiencing the same revelation that the others did.
He had managed to find conversation partners with Dean Thomas and Luna Lovegood. He and Dean had a common appreciation for the fine arts and spent their dinners discussing classical works of Art at length, Draco expressing jealousy that Dean had been able to visit the National Gallery and, specifically, Turner’s
“Dobby has packed everything for you, Master Draco. There is a tent and clothes and even some food,” Dobby said as Mibby came back over, brandishing a small stack of sandwiches, which she placed neatly into a brown paper bag. Dobby undid the top of the backpack and carefully wedged the bag in before tying it all back up again. He gestured and Draco took it, hefting it over his shoulders. “Follow me, Master Draco,” he said and the elves parted, letting Draco walk between them as he followed Dobby.
“Tizzy, is it?” he asked and she squeaked and nodded. “Tizzy, I need you to go to Hogwarts and let Dobby know that Harry Potter is being held at Malfoy Manor and needs help. Can you do that now, please?” he asked and she bobbed a curtsey and took off running down the hallway. He stood and brushed down his trousers, before heading back to the drawing room.
“Yes, I dare! I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?” Harry asked and they still moved. Draco’s heart was in his throat still, pounding away, as Harry passed him again. Draco was desperate to touch him, to know that he was truly alive and wasn’t some sort of ghost brought back one final time to save them.
There was the sound of metal breaking and the heavy iron cuffs that had held the dragon for so long broke.
Leave Hogwarts to find Potter? The idea seemed absurd but the more Draco thought on it, the more he wanted it. He was of no use at Hogwarts, but out there, with Potter – he might be able to help.
From the top, the rust began to melt away as highly polished silver ran down the frame. Harry staggered backwards and made a choked sound.
“But surely,” she said, beginning to circle them, like a panther with its prey. “This is the Mudblood girl?” She pointed at Hermione, who recoiled. “This is Granger?”
She unwound a foul-smelling black shawl from around her head and shoulders, revealing a small cap of thinning white hair, and Draco pinched his nose as she dropped it onto the floor sending fumes of stale food and unwashed bodies up into the air.
, had sunk to one knee and asked Draco to marry him. When same-sex marriage had been legalised by the Muggle government, they had married by the Black Lake, Dumbledore’s final resting place in the distance. Kingsley Shacklebolt had officiated, and Ron Weasley, despite his protests, had definitely cried.
“- no time to collect possessions, the important thing is to get you out of here safely,” she was saying, and one of the girls from the Slytherin table piped up. She was wrapped in a warm cloak lined with ermine, but it didn’t hide the stuffed owl toy she held in her arms.
Harry found his seat with easy, at the back of a row, six seats behind Malfoy. A paper was already waiting for him at the desk, face down, alongside some muggle pens, and Harry felt a jolt of nerves climb up his throat. As he sat down, Harry spared one final glance at him before trying to turn his mind to the exam ahead.
“You too, Granger, Potter,” Malfoy said, before walking away, losing himself in the crowd. Harry watched him go until he couldn’t see that white blond hair anymore.
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” Father exclaimed with glee, pointing to Potter next. “And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Then go, Potter, go!” she said and Harry turned to run out of the hall. “Malfoy, go with him. Zabini, come here, you’re of use to us,” she instructed Draco and Blaise, and with a last look at Blaise, who gave him a determined nod, Draco tugged Harry along and they ran from the hall.
They arrived at the top of the staircase to find it was already open, waiting for them. Regardless, Draco rapped on the wood with his knuckles and waited until Snape called for them to ‘Enter’. Draco stepped inside first and held the door open for Isobel, who inclined her head briefly in thanks. The Headmasters office was covered, wall-to-wall, in portraits of the previous Headmasters and Headmistresses. Most dozed in their frames, one was playing solitaire, and the large portrait behind Snape hung empty. Bookcases lined the wall they had entered from, and even with a quick glance, Draco could see books missing from the shelves, gaps that had been previously filled.
He slipped out of the carriage and followed the train's aisle, heading towards the back of the train. If he paced his walk right it felt like he was moving in place, like the world was slipping by under his feet. He allowed himself to settle into the rhythm of it, to lose his thoughts in the motion of the train. He was interrupted by a Gryffindor, already in their robes, coming the opposite way. He wasn’t one that Draco recognised, and he scowled at Draco, his eyebrows pinching tight.
“Goodbye, Dobby,” he said, his voice strained and then Bill raised his wand and the pile of displaced earth beside the grave rose up and then fell neatly upon it in a small mound.
who died in the War, no sons though… Shall we add him to the list?" Ron mused outloud, and Harry made a quiet noise of agreement. He wasn't used to this inactivity, but Thompson had thrown him out of the bullpen shortly after Mulligan had explained about the Golden Forty-Eight, and Hermione had agreed before she left that it was probably best if Harry didn't get overly involved in the investigation.
Ollivander would be in the cellars, Draco knew. He had only seen the old wandmaker brought into his house, as it was Wormtails’ job to “care” for him, but he closed his eyes against the horrors he knew were coming.
“The guide to wizard families?” he said and she nodded. “He didn’t do anything notable then, if he’s not in anything else. Even small advances are written down somewhere,” he said and she sighed and then sneezed.
“Why don’t you have a lie down, Ellie? The anti-venom will start working in a moment and you’ll feel better soon,” she murmured soothingly to the girl who nodded and collapsed onto her side, drawing her knees up to her chest. Pomfrey drew the curtains around her and bustled over to Draco.
“So you aren’t wanted then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?” he asked and Draco closed his eyes.
“He’s really gone?” Hermione whispered, her voice cracking, once Draco was close enough to hear her. He nodded and sat down heavily next to them.
, Scorpius had watched a film up here with him, wrapped in that very blanket, until he had been falling asleep and Harry had ushered him off to bed. He set the jumper down on top of the blanket and went into his bedroom proper, through a set of slatted folding double doors.
“His pulse is racing. He must be having another vision,” she said and then Bill was behind her, crouching down on the ground.
"Otherwise it might be a murder investigation instead," she finished, and Hermione sucked in a breath, while all the blood drained from Ron's face.
“Neville – what the – how?” he spluttered as Longbottom stepped back and then spotted Ron and Hermione, giving them hugs too. He turned around to face Harry again and stopped, his expression frozen when he spotted Draco.
“What about the Mudblood, then?” Greyback growled, and he forced the prisoners to turn again so that Hermione was at the front, the firelight falling over her face. She gave Draco a terrified look.
“Have you seen Remus?” Nymphadora asked him as he went by, and Aberforth’s response trailed behind him.
"Harry," he said and Harry turned back to look at him. "What do we do tomorrow? I mean - what can we do?" he asked, his voice desperate and Harry stared at him, feeling very lost.
With Luna, they discussed obscure wizarding facts, and he enjoyed listening to her hypothesis about the location of Ravenclaw’s diadem.
“Get up, climb up, come on–” Harry said, grasping Draco’s cloak and practically throwing him at the dragon. Draco climbed. He found a foothold in the crook of the dragon’s leg and pulled himself up onto it’s back, turning around instantly and hauling Hermione up behind him. Weasley followed, sitting behind Hermione, and then Harry climbed up, swinging a leg over the dragon’s spine just in front of Draco. The scales were hard and cold beneath them and Draco shot off a jinx at a human guard that came too close.
“About Harry? Yes, I do. I also know you were the one telling her while she was in her beetle Animagus form,” she said and Draco blanched. Hermione giggled. “I caught her and kept her in a jar for three days,” she said with a grin and Draco gaped at her. Hermione shrugged. “She hurt Harry. She lied about Hagrid. I wasn’t going to let her fly free to ruin more lives,”
“I think we ought to say something,” Luna suggested softly. They all turned to look at her. Potter dusted off his trousers and went to stand next to Draco, who offered him a hand. Potter ignored it. “I’ll go first, shall I?” she continued and then she addressed the small body in the grave.
"Harry - the boys, they've not… The Trolley Witch, she reported them missing from the train about 5 minutes ago," she said and the bottom fell out of Harry's stomach.
“I understand,” he finally replied and then they lapsed into silence. “Will you remember this dream?” he asked and Potter shrugged one shoulder and gave him a small smile.
The Hall was filled with a low hum of chatter. As Madam Pomfrey healed the injured, they rejoined their friends and family. In amongst the tears for the dead, there were smiles for the reunited living. Mothers, battered and bruised, held their arms open for their children. Conversely, Slughorn sat with a weeping girl next to what could only have been the body of her father, and Draco watched as Slughorn hugged the student, rocking her slowly. He watched Oliver Wood slowly and carefully straighten the body of Creevey, pulling his legs straight and then lightly crossing his arms over his chest. He looked down once, nodded, and left the hall.
They drifted into silence. Fleur came out of the kitchen with a plate of sandwiches which she put on the squat table in the middle of the room. She pointed her wand at the fireplace and the driftwood fire came to life, sending a wave of warmth over all of them.
“I’ve been getting them all out of The Burrow,” Bill explained to Potter, who nodded once. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the family – don’t apologise,” Bill said, as Potter opened his mouth to do just that. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood traitor family there is,” he said and then he gave Draco a quick look. “I think Draco’s gunning for top spot, mind,” he smiled and Draco looked away.
“The wizarding world – not just his supporters. No one says it,” he said and Potter gave him a long look.
“Are you happy at school?” Potter asked one night, using a twig he had pulled from the ground of this dreamed forest to draw swirling patterns in the cool soil they sat on. Draco sniffed.
He pulled out the muggle mobile phone he kept in his backpack and called one of the only contacts he had.
“Don’t worry, it’ll get there. It took me a while to produce my own properly. You’ll do it soon enough,” he said kindly and Draco nodded at him, turning to face him. The wind kicked up and sent a chilly winter breeze over their faces.
“You think you know more magic than I do? Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?” Voldemort asked. Harry’s expression remained calm, resolute.
“You’re looking rather pale, Draco,” Blaise said conversationally and Draco shot him a stern look. “Not looking forward to the return to school?” he asked and Pansy sniffed.
“I thought you did very well,” she said under his breath and Draco just gaped at her as Amycus forced Longbottom to kneel on the classroom floor and then raise his own wand.
“I don’t blame you, dear boy,” he said before Draco could ask what he was doing. Ollivander’s cloudy eyes scanned his face and Draco felt his bottom lip quiver. “You’re only a child. This isn’t your war,” he said quietly, patting Draco’s hand once before letting it go and lying back on the pillows, his eyes already closed. Draco made sure to shut the door quietly on the way out.
On the third floor, Harry pointed at one of the closed doors. "Guest room is in there, now. There's an ensuite - I'll grab some pyjamas and a toothbrush and bring them down," he said, and Malfoy nodded, heading over to the room to investigate while Harry took the remaining flight up to his Master suite.
" and he had frozen where his hand had been holding a Moly, about to drop it into a bubbling cauldron. He had taken a while to compose himself, to snuff out the fires under the potions that were already brewing, and gather his things (and his thoughts). And then he had Apparated to London, and helped to find his boys, and regain his family.
“Harry, look!” Granger said suddenly, having pulled him forward slightly. Draco looked too and gasped.
“I’b Bardy,” he said, his voice even more muffled now. “Bardy Weadley,” he said and Scabior looked over to Draco, who shrugged one shoulder.
“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I–” but he broke off, staring at a spot behind Draco’s right shoulder. Draco whipped around as quickly as he dared under the cloak and had to smother a small shout of surprise. A heavily wrapped figure was limping up the lane towards them, caught only in the lights from the square in the distance. Draco couldn’t tell if it was a man or a woman, but they were moving slowly, as though worried about slipping. Granger reached and wrapped her hand around Draco’s wrist, as though scared, and he turned his hand to slip it through hers. On his other side, Potter did the same, taking a loose hold of Draco’s hand, in case they had to Disapparate quickly.
“I’m trying, okay?” he snapped and Potter held up his hands in deference. Draco turned back to the empty space of the clearing and tried once more, scanning his memories for a brief flicker of happiness.
“Is Potter with you?” Draco asked and Granger raised an eyebrow. He crossed his arms over his chest. “I’m here of my own accord if that’s what worries you. No one has sent me, I swear,” he said and her eyebrow rose higher still. A bubble of frustration built in his throat and he tried to swallow it down – and failed. “I’ve been searching for you for nearly three weeks now. I’ve followed you up and down the whole damned country by this point. I’m here to help!” he snapped and Granger studied him with a long look. Then she raised her wand and he took a step back, nearly tripping backwards over his backpack.
“Are you alright?” he asked and the goblin moaned but didn’t say anything. He could hear around him the soft roll of waves and the air smelt strongly of salt. He blinked into the darkness, unable to see anyone nearby. “HELLO!” he called and there was an answering cry a little way away. And then he heard Potter yell “DOBBY!” and Draco whipped his head around to see Potter running towards where the elf stood, swaying in the sea breeze. The moon overhead caught the light of something silver in the elf’s chest and it stole Draco’s breath.
“There’s no way to stop it. The Mark is cursed. I’m assuming it’s burning because they’re trying to call you back?” she asked Draco, who nodded and stifled a sob. “Is there anything that can soothe the pain?” she asked and Draco raised his arm a little, motioning to where Potter was still holding it around the wrist.
So he tried not to sleep. He would wave Pansy and Blaise off to their own beds and claim one of the armchairs in the Slytherin common room, working late into the night and then reading into the early hours. Whenever he thought he was about to drop off, he stood up and walked around the room, went to the bathroom to splash some cold water on his face, and then picked up his book again.
Malfoy plucked at the t-shirt on the top of the pile and smile. "I got you this," he said quietly and Harry looked at the t-shirt itself. It was old, but comfortable, and had the logo of a Muggle theme-park emblazoned across it, and he remembered - Malfoy had begrudgingly bought it for him after a day out when Harry's t-shirt had gotten wet after riding on a log flume.
It was only because he was practically lying on Harry that he noticed, but all of a sudden Harry went rigid underneath Draco, his muscles seizing. Draco sat bolt upright.
“I got it! The password was ‘Albus’! This is it, this is Potterwatch,” Weasley exclaimed and Draco had to stop himself from rolling his eyes at the name. The trio sat around the wireless while Draco remained on the bench, listening intently to the voice that he vaguely recognised now issuing from it.
Attached to the side in it’s own separate pouch was a tent, which popped up without any prompt as soon as he laid it flat on the ground. He moved the backpack inside and was a little disappointed to see that it was, what he assumed, was a Muggle-style tent. There was no ensuite, no kitchen, just a plastic groundsheet and enough room for him to lie down. Outside, he managed to pile together enough fallen sticks to begin a campfire, lighting it with a quick
Ron slipped away but Hermione kept close to Draco’s side as he walked further into the room. It wasn’t a room he recognised. Multicoloured hammocks were strung from the ceiling and balcony that ran the edge of the room, which had dark-panelled wooden walls. There were tapestry hangings from every house but Slytherin, the silver serpent absent from between the gold lion, the black badger and the bronze eagle. Bookcases were tucked into corners and looked nearly as haphazardly filled as Bathilda Bagshots’ had been. A few broomsticks were propped against walls and a large wooden-cased wireless hummed in the corner of the room, it’s dials lazily spinning. He gave Hermione a confused look.
The walk down to the dungeons was quiet, at least on Draco’s part. While Blaise and Pansy traded theories on how having a Slytherin Headmaster would benefit them, Draco could only think about how very strange it was to not see Dumbledore at the High Table. It had looked empty without him.
“Yeah, maybe,” and then they lapsed into silence. Eventually Potter squirmed around in his towel to change into warm things, Draco looking away with forced casualness, and they made their way back to the tent. Hermione had left the bathroom, her hair starting to frizz after a shower and Weasley was asleep on the armchair, unmoved from when Draco and Potter had left.
Without receiving news from the wizarding world, and Draco was sure that any letters from friends warning Mudblood students would have been intercepted by the Ministry, many of them would have no idea what they would be returning to this year. A few half-bloods looked apologetic and tearful, and even a few pure-bloods pulled their Mudblood friends closer to them, as if they could protect them.
Luna was dreamily explaining about a tiara that her father had been making, and Draco was only half-listening, instead focused on hooking his ankle around Potter’s under the table, when there was a bang on the door. All heads snapped in that direction, Bill the first to his feet at the table, followed by Potter, Weasley, Hermione and Draco, all their wands drawn. Fleur had emerged from the kitchen looking frightened and she stood behind Bill, her hand braced against the wall.
“But, Harry-,” he started, but Harry started collecting his things, tucking them away into the backpack next to his chair.
Belinda sat him down on the plush sofa in the corner of his office and then bustled off to her atrium outside his office, to make him a cup of tea. Harry sat with his head in his hands, panic occasionally seizing his body and thrumming through him. He felt like he was going mad.
Dumbledore spoke. The racing of Draco’s blood thundered in his ears and in those moments, he could not remember exactly what he had said. But he remembered this – “I can help you, Draco,”
Potter tried asking her another few times gently, pushing the photograph out towards her and Draco stepped further into the room, just in case, but Potter finally snapped before he could get too close. “Who is this man?” he said loudly and Granger gave him a shocked look.
"Wandless? Really?" he asked and Harry nodded tiredly. He had managed to tap into this skill during his Auror years, and since then used it for minor things - turning on the wireless, making tea, sending Donovan from the Daily Prophet whizzing back to the elevators when he managed to sneak past security again (he hadn't tried coming back).
“He made it out in one piece, but he’s on the run now, like us,” he explained. He stepped around Hermione to go back into the tent and she gave him a filthy look as he brushed past her, Potter following. “Anyway, it’s best to stick with You-Know-Who,” Weasley added and Draco turned in his seat.
“Hermione, you studied at Magdalen College. That’s just down the road, isn’t it?” he asked and she tutted.
. He’s kind, and generous. He’s so very brave, you have no idea. And I think –” and he tried to take a steadying breath but the tears were flowing freely now as he imagined them, sleeping together under the snow, hands clasped together even in death, oblivious to their much loved son nearby. Draco tried speaking to them again.
“And me,” Harry called from the centre of the group around him. His eyes were fierce in the warm light of the room and a few of the students around him looked confused but the tension seemed to ease somewhat.
There was a wild keening sound filling the air and it was only when he was on his knees next to Snape did Draco realise it was himself. Harry, looking numb, reached for him but Draco batted his hand away.
“Gold!” Bellatrix cackled, paused while trying to raise Father’s wrist to her mouth, apparently to bite him. Her free hand was groping in her pocket for her wand and Draco took a few more steps back, trying to get out of the way quickly. “Take your gold filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the honour of his – of –”
“It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell,” Lee Jordan said and Draco felt sick. He had never met his uncle, but to hear it said so plainly, with such finality. The trio were giving each other looks of horror.
The house tables had been replaced, the bodies of the dead, which came to over fifty, were laid out where the top table had been. Voldemort’s body had been roughly moved into another room, away from the grieving, who Harry had dutifully spoken to. He held their hands as they cried, listened to their stories and their sorrow, all without flinching. Draco kept an eye on him, but had to speak to his parents.
“No. I will not do this here. I have to – we have to do this, now, or it will never end,” he told her quietly and she studied his face for a second and nodded. Draco reached out a hand for Harry, who took it and pulled him close.
Silence fell again. Draco felt like his breath had been stolen, the very air from his lungs snatched away, as Harry stood still under the full weight of the gaze from everyone in the room. There was a rustle of noise from the Slytherin side of the hall and Draco glanced over to see that Pansy had stood up.
Bugsy reappeared with a small tray of tea, lemon slices and sugar cubes at the ready. He poured himself a cup and then cradled it in his hands, training his eyes on the handle of his bedroom door. No one would disturb him tonight, he was certain of that, but he couldn’t take his eyes off the door. He sipped the tea and watched.
He read for a while. And then his eyes slipped closed and the book fell shut and he descended into dreams…
“Hello, Minister!” Percy Weasley shouted jovially, sending a jinx at Pius Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and pulled at his robes desperately. “Did I mention I’m resigning?”
“We need to go,” he hissed and he gave the mortal remains of Fred Weasley an apologetic look. “We can’t stay here, it’s too dangerous–” and then Ron had lurched to his feet and had pushed Draco back, sending him staggering into the opposite wall, his hand ripped clean from Harry’s grasp.
His heart nearly stuttered to halt when Harry saw there was a new letter in the post tray on the kitchen counter, charmed to transport any post from the mailbox at the building entrance to the tray. He took a shuddering breath before reaching for it, weighing it in his hands. It felt light, which wasn’t always a good sign. His name and address was neatly printed on the front of the letter and Harry turned it over to rip open the envelope.
“My dear boy, it was more than. You have found your own redemption. You have shaken the bonds that bound you to a fate that was set out before you, long before you knew. You have forged your own path. I am so very proud of you,” he said finally and Draco bobbed his head, feeling his lower lip tremble unprompted. It was all he had wanted to hear for so long.
” the memory came unbidden. A round-faced girl with chestnut curls had been bouncing down the train corridor that first September journey, her face practically glowing with excitement. Draco remembered then, how his heart leapt with excitement and joy. Harry Potter, in his year? Maybe they would be friends? Maybe Potter would be in Slytherin and Draco could show him how to live in this world and they would be the best of friends until the end of time? How hopeful he had been, how ignorant, but that bright burst of happiness was enough, maybe.
“Remember, I don’t like the beard too long,” Weasley was saying and Hermione hushed him, setting to work conjuring the necessary Transfigurations. She and Draco had worked together to find the correct order of spells, because some would cancel out others if they were layered incorrectly. Weasley and Draco were both going under false identities, hoping that Bellatrix’s presence would be enough to stop any questioning.
’,” he read aloud and he frowned even more at her. “Why do you have The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” he asked and she sighed, reaching out to take the book back. He handed it over and she stroked a finger down the spine as if in reverence.
“I’m still waiting to hear back from this Fellowship I applied for, and… well, I might be moving back to Europe in the next few months,” he said, surprising even himself at the revelation. He loved Australia but had never felt quite at home here, and maybe it was time to go back. Enough time had passed that his notoriety must have faded, or so Harry hoped. He gave Cameron a genuine smile and patted his hand where it still rested on the table between them. “Best of luck for the future, Cameron,” he said and then with a smile, he hefted his backpack onto his shoulder and walked away, leaving Cameron gobsmacked behind him.
"Do you have any idea how terrified I was?" Harry asked and Malfoy nodded. Harry was quiet for a long moment, gathering his thoughts and memories from that terrible day. "My husband tried to kill the children we tried desperately for. In our home. I did everything I did to protect them, to keep them safe - from you. Because you tried to kill them," Harry continued and Malfoy sat down heavily on top of the desk. Harry continued, "Because you hated them enough to want to kill them,"
They turned to Draco, who opened his arms, and the boys rushed in, falling into his embrace. He pulled them in close and took a moment to just breathe them in. His boys, his babies, the sons he had carried and nearly lost, not once but twice. He loved them so much it ached sometimes, and yet he couldn't imagine life without them. Taking a second to blink back the sudden sting of tears, he stepped away from them, his hands sliding to cup the back of their necks, giving them both a wobbly smile. Scorpius looked tearful while Albus' chin was wobbling, his lips pressed firmly together.
“It was a drink my Grandmother always gave me when we visited the Dowager Cottage. I haven’t had it in a long time,” he said and neither of them had a reply to that.
“How dare you!” he snarled and Draco searched for Hermione’s gaze. She gave him a questioning one, and he shook his head slightly – it would be too dangerous to attempt to free them right now, with his parents and aunt right there. Bellatrix and Greyback continued to argue.
Draco climbed down from the top bunk and headed for the door, ruffling his hair as he went. He paused outside to listen as Hermione spoke.
Outside there was a clatter and a wave of noise, and Harry stood up from behind his desk, his heart racing. Had something happened? Had they found the boys? What was going -
They fell into silence, the group, as they all poured over the files in front of them. Harry got lost in the details of Death Eaters he had encountered years before - Hollander, Grey, Rowle. Any one of them could have his sons, and the thought made a mixture of panic and rage rise in his chest. With a glance over a Malfoy, Harry could see that he, too, was struggling with the strange mix of emotions.
Draco joined in the screams of elation, the noise torn from him without his conscious thought as Harry, alive, locked eyes with Voldemort, and then the air went silent and still.
“There is no time, Master Draco. Dobby has packed some things from the laundry for you – Dobby hopes they fit,” Dobby said and Draco felt a rush of gratitude for the elf. He had abandoned his satchel in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, leaving everything aside from his wand in his rush to get to Snape, and for a moment he was desperate to go back and get it, to have something of his own to take with him, but he knew time was of the essence.
“Might as well make sure the world knows,” Crabbe suggested and then they were on him. Draco hadn’t been fast enough to dodge out of their way, tired as he was, and Goyle caught him around the middle, sending the both of them crashing to the floor. Crabbe flipped him over and pinned him down with one knee to the middle of his chest, holding him in place. Draco coughed and wheezed and tried to push Crabbe off him, but the other boy was much stronger than he was, and weighed much more as well, built solidly of muscle that Draco never expected to be used against him.
"There's a guest room upstairs. I have some spare pyjamas. Come on - let's get some sleep. The b-," and here his own breathing hitched, tears quickly burning at his eyes, "
The pub was a bit fuller than it had been the day before, and they found a table towards the back of the pub, all of them slumping down heavily. Harry felt a headache growing behind his eyes and took off his glasses briefly to pinch the bridge of his nose, attempting to alleviate the pressure.
“No, I didn’t,” Harry replied, shaking his head. "I think... I think I heard him though. Calling my name,” he trailed off, blinking. Ron patted him on the shoulder.
“Look at the signature,” she said quietly and he frowned at the page before looking up at her in astonishment. She took the book off him and went next to Draco, holding out the book for him. Like Potter, he took it and studied the page. It was an image of a handwritten letter, with Dumbledore’s signature at the bottom. But unlike the looping A that appeared on every Hogwarts letter in the past seven years (excluding the last year), it was a small version of the symbol in its place – a circle within a triangle with a line down the middle. He handed the book back to her, his fingertips feeling a bit numb.
“I suppose we’ll find out next week,” he said and Harry smiled. He felt drained, both emotionally and mentally, but he was pleased to see Draco, despite the awkwardness he had felt earlier.
!” Draco said, tapping his wand to Weasley’s side lightly. His ribs made a weird jerking movement, but the bruising faded a little and Draco took a step back.
Draco was sat in an armchair in front of a flickering fire, a large tome balanced in his lap, and he looked up as Harry entered. The firelight caught his eyes, turning them into liquid gold in its glow, and maybe that was why Harry's knees went weak, not just because of the books.
"The message was located on one of the pillars on the platform, etched on the stone in Hidden Words," he flicked his wand and a large image of one of the brick pillars on platform 9¾ appeared, floating in the air. Etched - no, burned - into the side of the pillar was some writing. Thompson began to read it out.
Please be aware that some dialogue in this chapter has been taken directly from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling. These words do not belong to me, and I do not claim them as my own.
Potter’s hand was heavy on his waist and the other was warm against his back. They were pressed closer, probably closer than strictly necessary, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to step away. He resisted the urge to thread his fingers through Potter’s curls, and had to look away when Potter turned his gaze to him, his green eyes catching the lamplight and flaring gold for a second, boring into Draco’s soul. He could feel Potter’s heartbeat ticking in his throat and Draco felt his pulse quicken for just a moment.
Silently, he and Granger stood and he put an arm around her shoulders and she an arm around his waist and they moved away without talking, but Draco didn’t follow them. He waited until they were out of ear shot and then shed the cloak, pulling it loose from over his head, standing before the grave of Lily and James Potter, wanting to stand before them as he was, not hide in the shadows.
“Is that it? The diadem of Ravenclaw?” he asked, reaching out a finger to touch it – before he could do so, dark liquid began to leak out of it, turning it black. It suddenly jerked in Harry’s hands and then broke apart. Harry gaped at it.
“It’s dangerous stuff we're doing. I know it only seems like we’re camping in the woods, but – it could get dangerous. Dumbledore left me a mission and I need to complete it if we’re going to defeat Voldemort,” he said and Draco flinched. He caught Potter’s eyes and Potter was smiling a little. “Really? Even in dreams?” he asked. Draco rubbed his hands on his thighs, trying to sooth the goosebumps that just broke over his skin.
“Of course I’m sure. I heard that Granger girl say it herself. ‘Dalby Forest’. Somewhere in the North Yorkshire Moors. She seemed rather upset, I think the Weasley boy has left them,” the unknown person replied and Snape made a frustrated noise.
Close-up, Longbottom looked far worse than Draco had originally realised. One of his eyes was swollen, mottled yellow and purple. His face had gouge marks on it, and his robes were worn and ripped in places. Draco would’ve placed money on Longbottom living in the Forest, given the state he was in.
At the dungeon entrance, Draco murmured the password to the stretch of stone wall which creaked open to let them in. He saw Dougal and the herd of first-years rounding the corner just as Blaise and Pansy disappeared inside.
“Well, I hope you get better soon,” she said eventually. She stood, letting him go, and swung her legs over the bench, rising to stand. At the last second she lent over him, as if to grab something from the table, but as her robes shielded them from the High Table and her hair swung in front of them to cover them from curious eyes, she murmured to him, “You need to pull yourself together, Draco, or you’ll attract unwanted attention.”
“Regardless, you have overcome so much. Your family, your ideology – it is very noble,” Dumbledore said and Draco blinked rapidly.
“I know, I know,” someone was saying next to him and Draco fought even as the arms around him held tighter still, even as he screamed. Someone was in front of him, pulling him close and he screamed into their shoulder, his whole body taut with it, the grief ripped out of him. He shook and sobbed and retched and all the while someone was holding him tightly, rubbing his back, making soothing noises in his ear.
“I swear,” Draco said, holding his voice steady and firm. “I’m here to help. I don’t want to hurt either of you, and I am not being compelled to follow any orders.” The Truthlight did not flicker. Granger lowered her wand, obviously satisfied. “Did Potter tell you I’ve been talking to him in his dreams?” he asked and her poker face was very good – if she was surprised by anything he said, she did not give it away.
' it into their local council. They thought it might be someone dumping some rubbish. Thankfully, we got there first, and we've now secured the area," Thompson explained. He tapped on the image and it zoomed in - printed on one of the lids of the trunks was “ASP' in gold letters. Albus' trunk. "Based on the initials on the trunks - the other says “SHP' - we can safely assume that these are the Potter boys trunks. Forensic Wizards are there currently, analysing them for anything that might tell us who took the boys. Now, Aurors, I want at least three of you out there with them. Mulligan, Coles, Demir, you take the first shift. The rest of you, I want-," and Thompson's voice faded away as Hermione ushered them back into Harry's office, Ron, Ginny and Luna behind them.
"Difficult," he admitted and she pulled away and gave him a soft smile, patting his shoulder comfortingly. Ginny and Luna both embraced him too, and Harry accepted both - Ron just gave him a clap on the back, but Harry could see in his face that he was struggling too. "Where's Neville?" he asked and Ginny sighed.
Harry landed on the front step of Grimmauld Place, a second behind Hermione who was already opening the door. She gave a little flinch as he landed, and he reached for her, concerned.
Four days since the Dark Lord had come screaming back into Malfoy Manor, and his anger still sat like an oppressive air over the house. Draco hadn’t dreamed of Potter again, and he had managed to convince himself that first dream had been just that – a dream, brought about by the sleeping potion the elves had slipped into his tea. He hadn’t punished them for it.
"She's done her usual walk-through of the train, and couldn't find them anywhere. She triple-checked, Harry - they're not on the train," McGonagall said. Harry stared at her.
“Don’t play games with Harry,” he said firmly and Draco paused before replying. Typically, he would have shot off something snarky but this time… Weasley was saying it with good intentions, not to start a fight for no reason. Draco nodded.
“Please talk to me,” he murmured into the quiet of the kitchen and Potter straightened, letting go of Draco’s arms. “I feel like the odd man out here. I know Bill doesn’t trust me yet, and the fact that Luna even looks at me is astonishing, but please – you, Hermione and Ron are my only friends here,”
Harry’s eyes snapped open only a minute or two later, and he took a deep, shuddering breath. He pushed their hands off him and sat up, shivering still.
“You’re pinching my elbow,” Potter eventually said and Draco took a step back, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck, which felt hot with embarrassment.
“It’ll be ok,” he whispered to Potter and Potter only groaned horribly. Draco squeezed his eyes shut.
In the bullpen, the Aurors were gathered around their own Case Summary, written on one of the spelled blackboards, where Thompson was conjuring another image. There was excited, low muttering around them, and Harry wanted to tell them all to be quiet, but he held his tongue and gripped Malfoy's hand as the image slowly appeared before them.
Ron grinned and gestured for Harry to sit down. “How was your Portkey over? And the talk, how’d that go?” he asked and Harry settled back into the sofa to talk about his day. Ron was changed from the last time Harry had seen him in person four years ago, but for the better. Still tall and lanky with red hair and freckles, his eyes seemed bright and lively. Hermione had told him that Ron had completed his Auror training and then promptly quit to join George in running Weasley Wizard Wheezes and Harry agreed that this profession suited him better. There was colour in his cheeks now, and he no longer looked as haunted as he had at the age of 18, with the Fred’s death still fresh on all of their minds.
) turned in the arms of a redhead man who Draco realised with a start was the man riding the Thestral the night that Potter had escaped the Dark Lord once more.
“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” Draco heard from behind him and then Molly Weasley stormed forward, wand drawn, eyes ablaze. Draco followed her. “OUT OF MY WAY!” Molly shouted at the girls, and they fell back as Bellatrix laughed with delight.
“You seem out of sorts, Draco,” Pansy said delicately and Draco tried to focus his attention on her, even though every part of him was screaming.
“We might need to knock him out,” someone else said grimly behind him and another voice made a pained noise.
"You had to sign the papers agreeing to it," Harry said quietly, into his hands, and Malfoy scoffed.
,” he said again and the red light hit Finnigan in the chest. He crumbled to his knees, screaming and there was another loud scuffle as Longbottom broke free from the Gryffindor girls.
"Y'see the Manor? Around “at, someone has put an Obscura charm - my team are close enaw “at they should be able tae see inside, but they cannae. We cannae ge' a clear visual tae see what's happenin' inside th' property, or e'en if they're there," Begbie told them, pointing at the border of hedges around the Manor, and Draco scoffed from next to Harry.
Potter was a good few paces ahead of him but paused and turned around to wait for Draco while he caught up. They walked together down to the lake and Draco used his wand to cast obscuring charms around them as they settled down on the bank, the grass and earth abruptly dropping off into water .
Draco checked one of the final compartments in the carriage and smiled as he opened the door – Harry was adjusting the straps of the overhead luggage storage, tightening a loosened knot.
“Harry?” he called across the crowd, and they all turned to look in Harry’s direction. Draco stepped away from Hermione and pushed his way through the crowd, fighting back against the arms that held him a bit away, intentionally or not. “Let me through!” he snapped. Harry swayed where he stood and Ron caught him, holding him upright. “Let me through, Merlin damn you!” Draco snapped again and a fifth-year Hufflepuff stepped away, aghast. Draco stumbled through the gap and was next to Harry in an instant. Thankfully, he was coming round.
“What do you think?” Draco asked, leaning close and speaking quietly. “Do you think we got it?” he asked and Harry gave him a smile.
“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners –” and then Greyback turned to Draco with a smirk. “The Malfoy brat too,” he added and Draco felt his arms being grabbed and twisted behind his back before he could protest. He was dragged a little way aways and forced into a sitting position before being bound back-to-back with some of the others. Eventually the movement stopped and Draco heard whoever had bound them up walk away.
"You didn't want me there. You banned me from seeing them, laid that all out very nicely in the custody agreement, didn't you, Potter? I would've been there, I would've stood on the platform for them, Merlin, maybe if I had done that, they wouldn't have fucking gone missing on YOUR FUCKING WATCH," Malfoy roared, splotches of colour appearing at his cheeks. Harry reared back as if he had been slapped, breathing harshly. Dimly, he was aware of Hermione casting wards around the room, probably sealing off the room in case Harry's magic flared, which it did on occasion.
“I don’t want to say I told you so,” he said and the three Gryffindors looked like they were about to start shouting at him. He held up his hands and said nothing more.
Draco woke up with a start. The drapes that Harry had pulled closed around them, blocking out the daylight that crept through the ruined walls of Gryffindor Tower, stirred as he sat up, running a hand through his hair.
The dragon seemed to sense freedom was only above it and it snarled and lashed its tail as they carved out a passage for it, fire warming the earth ahead until the heat was nearly unbearable and then, finally, they burst into the cool sunlight. Around them goblins and wizards ran shrieking for cover but the dragon stretched its wings once more, pushed away from the earth and launched itself into the sky.
?” His voice was cold and harsh and Draoc had no choice but to lean to his other side and withdraw the holly wand from where it had been laid on Potter’s ruined shirt and jumper, handing it over. Potter’s expression went slack, like someone had just punched the air out of him, as Draco lay the wand in his trembling hand. Potter gulped, as though surfacing from underwater, and turned his wide eyes to Draco. “Mend it. Please,” he said quietly, his voice pained, and Draco pulled a face.
"Have you spoken to Rose? Have you asked her, has she seen them?" he asked as the thought swung into his mind. Their children had been raised as cousins, the boys Weasleys in everything but name, and as they were so close in age, they spent most of their time with Rose, who was undoubtedly one of their best friends. With a frown, Hermione shook her head.
"Hardly. For one thing, I'm the man who broke the Boy-Who-Lived's heart and supposedly abandoned him and our children. No, the
“We’ll need it. For the Horcruxes,” Granger pointed out and she opened the book again, refocusing her attention on the pages. “And Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor, so–”
"Begbie, there's a light," Hermione said, her voice trembling slightly. Ron was stood next to her, holding her hand tightly in his own, his lips pressed together tightly. Begbie looked over his shoulder at the Manor and his whole face lit up as though someone has just told him it was Christmas.
“Harry!” he called, but the sheer amount of things surrounding him captured his voice before it could travel very well. The room was familiar to him. He had spent his sixth year here, trying to fix the Vanishing Cabinet. He tilted his head up to look at the high vaulted ceiling, the very top lost in shadow. He began to walk.
“It isn’t! It isn’t me!” she protested, but the seed of doubt was already planted and her protests had sealed the deal. Greyback stood, towering over the group and Draco turned his face away.
“Keep your voice down!” she begged, wading deeper into the churchyard, Potter rejoining the path. Draco waited for him and touched his shoulder again.
“But – we can’t just go! We’ve got to have a plan!” she said finally, but Harry was already getting to his feet.
“Yes, it did,” Harry admitted. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done… think, and try for some remorse, Riddle…”
“Tea for two please, Effie,” Draco said kindly and the Elf bowed and disappeared. He smiled at Harry as he sat back down in the armchair. “We used to have a good staff of Elfs, but it’s just Mother and Effie now,”
"I didn't realise you would go through with it! I thought that your sentimentality might win out, might mean that-," Malfoy cut himself off, running a hand over his face. "This isn't the time. Tell me what I can do," he said, pushing himself away from the wall and walking over to stand in front of Harry. Ron cleared his throat.
