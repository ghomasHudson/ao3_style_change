“Stella will keep it safe. Won’t you, girl?”
He played with them in the mirror, sweeping around imperiously, then politely, then enigmatically.
When Harry’s ankle was suitably oiled, Draco looked back at him. Harry, who had definitely not been looking at Draco’s mouth, brought his gaze up.
Harry nodded. “A real miracle,”
Thursday.
“First of August,” she said. The date had been set earlier, after he’d attended the Wizengamot discussion with Luna. They hadn’t been able to win that battle.
Thank God. “I think I can manage that part. Dunno about the salves though,” Harry said. “Would you mind?”
Look at this gorgeous day, it said. How ironic that your Mr. Potter is missing in your home, where you assured him he’d be perfectly safe, and where he assured you he would be comfortable? Isn’t it strange that such a strong, confident little thing could vanish under your nose? But why should I worry about these things? After all, I am just the sunlight and I make ugly things pretty and pretty things prettier.
Draco scowled.
as usual! I can’t believe the nerve of that man,” Elise offered.
I hope your time in my program has been most educational. I think you should like this work very much, if you haven’t read it already. I have to say, you’ve been my favorite to teach, and by far the most successful. I wouldn’t be surprised if you end up living in a muggle neighborhood for some time. Don’t laugh, I have faith in you. Consider this a graduation gift.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione would visit in the evenings and they’d sort through lists of magical people and putting them into categories based on who would be best suited (and most willing) to be the master of the Manor.
“Knock, knock!” She said, not knocking. She had a firm grip on Draco’s elbow.
. Maybe it was more enmity, maybe it was more humiliation. But Draco knew this: Potter would no longer be able to ignore him.
This clearly hadn’t been the question Malfoy had been prepared to answer, and his face smoothed over into that look Harry was already hating, although he’d only seen if a few times.
“Anyway, That’s really all I have to report. Love you all, goodnight.” Harry shut off the transmitter.
Speaking of Stella, the green beans needed a little weeding. Stella loved green beans.
He looked over to Luna, who was looking at him, eyebrow quirked, expecting a response.
On his walk to the apparition point, he thought it over. His mother’s theory proved plausible: that Harry Potter’s favor was the only thing standing in between the Ministry and the Manor. However, other factors should come into consideration, such as Harry Potter was a prat and a hermit and Draco would rather clean his flat the muggle way than talk to him.
“Smelling salt,” she said, not answering the first and more important question. Harry felt a stab of annoyance. She ran the bottle under his nose again, but Malfoy didn’t react. Luna frowned, swiped it under a third time. “Must be in REM,” she muttered. Then, raising her wand, she levitated a few salt crystals out of the bottle and shot them into his nose.
Draco hadn’t even had time to complain about missing the radio programme last night.
“See? All set. Off to the bookstore!”
He pouted. “I was! It’s just-”
Or something.
Malfoy slowed his playing, his lithe fingers making elegant pictures above the keyboard. The farther above the keyboard, the more relaxed they became. Then they would plunge down onto the white and black keys, so strong and yet able to create the subtle melody.
Lucius, Lucius. Where would he be?
Someone was sleeping on the bed. They shifted. Harry cast a disillusionment charm.
It reflected on a pair of green eyes with huge dilated pupils sparking with anger. Not literally, of course, but Potter looked close to accidental-on-purpose arson.
Draco sat, breathing heavily in front of the fireplace, wand clutched in one hand. It was shaking slightly. He needed a coffee.
“I didn’t say that,”
). Why would the Boy Who Lived be confined by things like stamina?
“Ironing charms. My mother is here.”
“You’ll have to take me up to my flat, first,” he ordered. “I don’t intend on wearing jeans to the Manor,”
“I bet you’re scaring him. He’s made of the same stuff as the other one you brought in a couple years back,”
Malfoy rolled his wrists over and snapped his fingers. When he pressed down on a few keys, playing a few chords and little melodies, no sound came out. But clearly Malfoy could hear something, because he frowned and peered under the lid. He played a note a few times gingerly, until something seemed to be fitting together better now and his frown turned to an expression of proud satisfaction. Then he snapped again, presumably allowing Harry to hear the piano’s music again.
Draco nodded. Forwards in life.
“That sounds lovely, thank you,” Draco said, standing up from the table. “Where should I set my dishes?”
They discussed old George, his granddaughter Lydia, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson of the pub, and all the people The Mums could think of.
Once upon a time, those words would have gone straight to Harry’s heart. He would have took it as ridicule, or worse, pity. A year ago, Harry would have returned Victor’s lighthearted teasing with a glare that could slice marble like butter. He would have demanded to know why Victor thought he was so high and mighty, why he was the judge of what a family is. But it’s not a year ago. So Harry spun on his stool to face Victor and said, “You forgot the vegetable garden,”
“The hell, Malfoy? Can’t a man change in his own bedroom without superveillance?” Potter said, indignant.
A tallish man about thirty-five or forty with an extravagant ponytail of curly black hair chose that moment to burst into the room, businesslike, and unwittingly silencing a whole can of worms Harry hadn’t particularly wanted to open.
“Of course. Mighty aloof the one time I saw him. Campbell and Elise brought him around.” He paused and stopped playing with the key on his cash register. “He didn’t…?”
“I’m sorry–”
Draco looked at them quizzically. “And just who is this other boy? You’ve mentioned him several times now,”
“Put on your red shoees and daance the bluueeees!” Elise sang from the side room. She was painting and had a record player set at maximum volume. For a woman of at least sixty she had remarkably supple lungs.
Draco’s eyes darkened as he set the salves down on the floor in a deliberate manner. Harry could hear Draco’s breathing in the quiet room, and though it was regular enough, there was a slight hitch when Draco straightened up to meet Harry’s eyes again.
Campbell sat down next to her. “And the moral of the story is that your ghost wife shouldn’t hold you down. So Draco, whoever your ghost wife or husband or wild dog is, let go of them. Do what you know will take you forwards in life.”
Pansy wanted him to play her game. She had been obsessed with finding him a lover since, well, since she had realized she couldn't be his. Probably thought she was doing him a favor, the cow. Merlin, he loved her. Always the same, always knew where he stood with her. She always let him in on her little games, especially when they concerned him.
He’d annotated something in orange across several of the documents. It seemed important. It had to have been, if Draco had taken the time to annotate it. But he couldn’t remember what it was. He floated all the orange-marked documents up to where he could sort through them. It was mostly old journal entries, but there were a few technical documents about leasing of some magical buildings post-Statute of Secrecy.
“Because he doesn’t take things like this lightly. Although, until recently, I didn’t know about his proclivities and I am nearly as surprised to notice your own, you should know that he is a fiercely loyal, intelligent, and hardworking boy.”
“Stray. Not plural. I’m pretty sure there’s only one of him,” she answered, glancing questioningly back at Draco.
“I’m serious, Pans. He’ll be too busy
Malfoy pulled back and gave an annoyed huff. He ignored Harry’s question. People were doing that a lot today. “For some reason, my mother thinks we’re… a thing,”
Harry struggled against the force. If he could just give one little noise out of the ordinary, one stray creak or thump, he was sure Malfoy would come over and investigate. And it’s Malfoy’s house, after all. He could save Harry from whatever this was.
He realized Malfoy was flipping through jumper colors. He sure did have a lot of jumpers, it seemed.
Draco nodded. His mind was working, making plans. “Thank you. I think I’m going to host a few of my friends today, so I won’t be around much.”
He noticed Malfoy didn’t have shampoo or the dozens of other hair products he inevitably used. Honestly, how else could one man make his hair look that, well, pretty?
“You wanted to see me, Mrs. Malfoy?” he asked.
Harry felt the sensation like being squeezed through a pneumatic tube that comes with apparition and then found himself, slightly off-balance, in an upstairs room of some sort of shop. He was gripping Malfoy’s arm. “Sorry.” He said, snatching his hand back and putting it in his jeans pocket where it belonged.
It probably didn’t matter because he probably still hadn’t gotten groceries yet. Harry should go check on him, maybe bring him a few of his old canned vegetables.
Wednesday.
Draco opened the door and felt a cool rush of energy under his feet and through his fingers, and he knew all the rooms were in their proper places again without having to check.
“Days?” Harry repeated, Malfoy’s faint blush telling him all he needed to know.
“Are they for sale?”
Lucius looked up. “I am sorry, my son. For it all.” he said.
“You old goof,” Draco said in what he hoped was a teasing and familiar tone. “Where’s Mother?”
Harry pulled on his trainers and walked out the door, Stella bounding happily behind him. He kept his eyes trained on the shadows, that one week of Auror training kicking in. The white-blond shock of hair evaded him, or maybe it wasn’t there at all. Maybe, he hoped, Malfoy had made it a week and decided he wasn’t going to get Harry to talk to him. Maybe this would be the end of it.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, holding the folder up to him. “I thought it was brilliant.”
The coffee shop, on the other hand, left something to be desired. Although the putrid scent was evaporating, the floorboards needed refinishing and the walls were indistinguishable from vertical floorboards. They would have to go. Wood paneling is, has been, and always will be tacky
Draco inched his thigh back to where it could touch Potter’s. And he tried to ignore the spike of energy that ran through his body at the moment of contact.
Draco looked over to the piano, the lacquer soft in the morning sun, inviting him to go over there, lift the lid, sit on the bench, hover his hands over the keyboard and then begin to play.
Then back to the sun parlor. Draco collapsed on the sofa, but Narcissa remained standing. If Potter wasn’t in any of the rooms, where could he be? Lucius was in control of the Manor’s magic, sure, but he didn’t possess enough ill intent to banish Potter from the grounds. And there was no chance Potter was in the east wing.
Pansy took a sip of firewhisky, straight out the bottle. Draco didn’t know where it came from, but it was best not to speculate. “Do you need me to take that away from you?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, turning to complete the transaction and thank to goblin for his time.
“I’ve never been,”
“How soon can you get the case together? Money isn’t much of an issue,”
“You have to take it out somewhere, don’t you? Might as well take it out on someone who can take it,”
So that was what Harry had been supposed to do. Shit.
“Good day, Weasley.” Draco said, face carefully blank.
“Good.” Draco poured himself a cup of tea. “I have reason to believe the ministry is trying to take the Manor,”
“Bastard.” Harry declared. “Malfoy’s a bastard who doesn’t know good advice when he hears it and good pizza when he smells it,”
He squinted at them. Something fishy was definitely going on and it was all Malfoy’s fault. But if he knew the Mums, he knew they would never snitch on a friend. And if he knew Malfoy, he knew the Mums didn’t know the whole of the plan.
Harry nodded, stood up, and went to talk with Narcissa Malfoy. And, possibly, the squadron of aurors escorting her.
“What do you mean, like this?” he asked, stretching his neck. It cracked several times, and there was an awful crick in it. Guess that’s what comes from sleeping a full eight hours sitting up, head in hand.
“I’m quite certain he’s going to ruin my life.” Draco concluded.
Harry tried to scream out again, but couldn’t manage a sound or a twitch. Malfoy, oblivious, sat on the bench above him. Harry heard the wood shift above him as Malfoy turned from looking out the window to back at the room. Malfoy’s pants covered the peephole, and then it’s nothing but Harry and his thoughts again.
“How about that, Stella?” He asked the dog at his feet.
“You can’t say ‘darling,’” Pansy insisted behind him. “It’s my thing,”
He wasn’t sure which one of them broke off the kiss, but then they were staring at each other in the night, Harry drowning in the fresh but familiar smell of Draco.
Malfoy looked up from his magazine. “Spare the theatrics, Potter, and just say no.”
He read aloud more fluently than he spoke normally. Each word led smoothly into the next. Maybe it had something to do with the way Malfoy’s face seemed to light up with excitement at the end of each sentence, or the way his eyes glanced up at Harry every now and then to be sure he was paying attention (which of course he was, because how could he not?).
“...locked from the inside out! And in our chest of drawers there lay the key. You see, Potter, at only the second time the Manor tried swapping rooms, it had already combined this new power with one it had used dating from the fifteenth century. Isn’t that extraordinary?”
“Potter! Want a cuppa?” He asked, door wide open, ecklectric light from the flat pouring into the store. Draco nearly smiled.
“Oh, yes, and his store was atrocious. I went in there once, about five years ago, and it smelled like a whole coven of raccoons had died of eating poisoned garbage,”
“And I said, no, because regardless of what some people think,” He made eye contact with Draco. “I’m not an idiot. But she grabs my arm and apparates me somewhere, and thank God I don’t get splinched. So we get wherever and I apparate to some park and I incarcerous her and then I come back here. So can I have my fucking wand back?” He asked, and Draco slid it across the table.
“Something like that.” Draco smiled weakly, then was struck with the sudden urge to open up to these women. “There’s a problem with my furniture. They said it should arrive within the week, but I'm rather doubtful that will occur. Yesterday I mostly spent calling whoever I could think in order to get it shipped,”
“And it doesn’t help that he’s stupidly possessive over everything that’s mine. It’s like he’s determined to take everything I made just for me, everyone I love and pollute them with his influence! Even you, Hermione. The only reason you even came to see me was because of him. And-and Luna loves him for God-knows-why! He’s a stupid little idiot and I hate him. I swear I hate him with my whole heart,” Harry was on a roll now. He was breaking dishes again, the catharsis buzzing through his head like a drug. “I wish he could see how rude and strange and hot and cold he is from anybody’s perspective but his own! He’s a… He’s a… I don’t know. He’s a bad fucking word, that’s what he is. I don’t know which one but he’s all of them!”
“He’ll think it’s all my fault and then we’ll get into it and I just woke up but I wouldn’t hesitate to- why are you here, anyway? And what’s in the bottle?”
“Yeah. You haven’t been reading the papers, right?” Ron sounded dreadfully professional, and Harry couldn’t tell if it was from talking on the phone or from talking to him.
It worked.
anyway, enough of my existential crisis.
Malfoy played a few more chords, each slower than the last. Then he stopped.
when Merlin knows he doesn’t
“Of course not, love,” Elise said. “His name is Harry. Harry Potter,”
“Heya!” A woman’s voice called. “Dragging home strays again?”
Draco wondered what Potter looked like lately. He’d always been very skinny and a little short.
Despite his self-deprecating jokes, the radio host had a soothing voice. Even through the radio, the timbres rang rich. Draco felt his eyelids getting heavy.
“I don’t care. How did you even find me? Don’t answer that,” He turned around. “I better not see you again. Fuck.”
There was a mirror sitting in the far corner, and Harry had to move to watch Malfoy through it.
He followed a bend in the road.
There weren’t many houses this direction. The main street ran north/south, and Draco was walking south. From what he’d gathered, Campbell and Elise were on the more southern end of town. The stores they visited for groceries were slightly north, and George’s Electronic Reparations was on the more northern end.
“Oh, no, it is,” Pansy grabbed the bottle and took another swig. “Problem is, they can pretend it’s by
Potter turned around. “You really believe that?”
Draco nodded.
Draco set his radio upstairs and grabbed one of the notebooks he’d brought with him. He transfigured a splinter from the floor into a notebook and began to write. In order to change the appearance of the walls without changing the constitution of the walls themselves, he needed some arithmancy.
“I guess I’d be the best one out of us to answer that, but I was traveling in America and when the wizarding travel warnings went up I figured I should stay for a while longer. It’s when I got the mug,” she said, nodding to Draco’s.
Draco took a seat on the counter opposite from where Potter was preparing some sort of soup. He was holding the ingredients Potter had summoned, and every so often Potter would ask for one and Draco would provide it. It was incredibly domestic, and Draco wasn’t a fan.
Ron was silent for a moment. “Are there many people, where you are?”
No reply.
The voice from the box said. It was a warm, solid voice, reminding Draco of the pleasant parts of his childhood. It reminded him of his four-poster Hogwarts bed, of getting sorted, of wonder and joy. Hogwarts before, well, before. But Draco
“Before he disappeared the paps used to get rather nice pictures of him. He looked rather fit,” She remarked, gauging Draco’s reaction.
Mother turned to Draco, all polite demeanor suddenly dropped.
“But that doesn’t mean you need to stretch this out longer than it has to be,” Campbell interrupted from the kitchen. “You need to get things straight between you both. When Elise and I–”
“This whole flat simply reeks of Boxwood. If you are growing one, don’t,”
Draco nodded. “Have you found Po–Er, Harry, yet?”
The silence laughed at him. Mission: Seduce Potter was in effect. Draco started drawing up plans immediately.
A cold strike of fear ran through his heart. Lucius. Where was Lucius? Draco hadn’t been keeping tabs, recently. It had been three weeks since he had last stopped in the Manor, and one more since he had talked to his, as much as he hated to say it, father. He could have gone into one of his fits again, thinking it was during the war. Mother couldn’t always calm him down, convince him to go to sleep. And suddenly Draco knew it. Lucius had gotten out. He had contacted some old Death Eater pal and paid him off somehow. They were after Potter and that’s why he was late. Merlin, Potter would never forgive him. He’d have to leave again, or start over again somewhere else.
“No. I’ll sneak into your rooms at night and burn all your nice coats,”
Potter looked away. “Like I’m the one hoping? Every time I turn around, you’re looking at my–”
“Why are you looking at me so indignant-like? I just haven’t gotten around to it, okay,” Malfoy said, turning back to his arrangement.
, we heard if you look in the mirror, spin around, and say “Scarhead, scarhead, scarhead,” he’ll appear!
The music grew louder and Malfoy grew tenser, the furrow in his brow deepening and tension growing in his jaw. His front hand continued to play the same little melody, with the twinkling notes, but his back hand moved with strength, each finger pressing down on a different key and creating undertones to the piece, building and resolving as necessary.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mother!” Draco sighed, just as Potter’s brows furrowed, trying to make sense of both stories.
“Herbal it is,” she said, handing him a mug. It bore a watercolor Golden Gate Bridge.
There it was.
Third door had a fresh coat of white paint on it, and Draco swung it open, sure that this one was the bathroom. But the crisp late spring light fell on a naked back, not a toilet seat. The back in question was firmly muscled, large shoulders, sharp shoulder blades, a few stips of scar tissue running through it like imperfections in the finest marble. And the lower back was really quite nice as well, remaining deeply tanned even at the dimples just before the elastic waist of the owner’s pants.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Translation?”
He narrowed his eyes. “You would know if you actually read the note I sent to you this morning,”
He simply turned his head, bringing them nearly nose-to-nose.
Hermione surprised him. Her brow was furrowed, but it was in concentration. “The ministry is targeting your property, as it is the only location they listed as having potential Dark magic,”
“I just wish I could leave him alone, is all. Or figure him out. Whichever comes first, really.”
He looked into Malfoy’s eyes as he bent down to adjust the glasses. His face was screwed up into an expression of utmost seriousness and concern, and Harry would have laughed if it weren’t so frighteningly nice. He realized, then, how terrifyingly gorgeous it would be to have Malfoy care for him, to have Malfoy appear out of concern for Harry’s every whim, to have exclusive access to the sympathetic side of Malfoy.
“Should I ask him you were calling?”
The Malfoys had always been good at manipulation.
“Hello, Ron,”
“Ah, the elusive Mr. M. I’ll be out in a sec,”
“Of course it is, darling, but in all seriousness it’s Witch Weekly,”
Damn him, Potter was still winning.
Draco let his head fall back into the sofa. “I’ve already been in. Trust me, if Harry was hiding somewhere in there, I would have noticed.”
Okay, that one wasn’t in any paper or magazine Draco saw. But it might as well have been. The people’s savior had become the people’s resident bigfoot.
This and the rest of the speech was highlighted in pink, and the note in the margin said: “times Orsino is a dramatic bitch”
The dog in question tilted her head as if she was listening, then curled up on the mat in front of the oven.
Draco stared back at her. He fiddled with a piece from the muggle radio. “I don’t know, Pansy. I don’t know,”
The Supreme Mugwump tapped his wand, signalling the beginning of discussion.
Malfoy was muttering something under his breath. Whatever it was, it ended with fucking Potter.
“I trust you’ve seen the Prophet this morning?”
i do have a love deep in my heart for basic Russian music and literature (peep Anna Karenina reference lol). also shoutout to the lofi hiphop section of youtube because it has singlehandedly motivated my schoolwork, artwork, and writing for the past week.
A week of this went by with no results. Draco sat at his card table, staring at the collage wall. The list Pansy and Blaise had made was still intact: 1. , 2. , 3. , 4. Seduction, and 5. Seduction. Draco had made a list of his own next to it.
Gelby was not accustomed to such displays of affection. “The young master should refrain from clinging to Gelby like a stuffed creature,”
Draco didn’t know if it was a joke or not, so he didn’t laugh. He gave him a sort of awkward half-smile and pretended he hadn’t read a few chapters on adrenaline during the house arrest.
“Draco,” He said, continuing to stand in the entryway. Campbell pushed him further into the flat. It seemed to have a similar layout to his. The furniture was all blandly mid-century, but prints of various sizes hung about the walls. He assumed Elise had painted them.
“Yes?”
To the innocent passerby, Draco must have looked like a serial killer. Or a very intense scrapbooker. Pages from magazines covered the empty wall across from the card table and his drawing of Mr. Ager (the asshole). They ordered chronologically from left to right. Draco was highlighting an article from a year and a half ago, several months before Potter disparaged the public of his presence. He had noticed a trend: the articles became more speculation-based instead of interview-based.
It was probably from Potter spending his days doing something unsavory. Like tile-work, except from tiling came mosaics, and mosaics were refined. Potter could never be refined. He probably just sat in his garage and did pushups or something aggressively masculine like that.
There wasn’t anything else to do. Maybe in another life, he would have barged up to Harry’s door, knocked on it, and demanded Potter listen to his explanation. But this wasn’t that life, and Draco, despite his reputable talent of being a pain in the ass, didn’t want to put Harry on the offensive. After all, he wanted the idiot to like him.
He squinted and tried to pull himself up with the hand Potter was stretching out to him, but his back and legs were so stiff he was left clutching Potter’s hand like a third-year on her first date at Hogsmeade.
“We went to school together. Aren’t on the best of terms,”
Draco looked at her blankly, not wanting to give her an answer she didn’t like.
God, what a world it would be if wizards didn’t use toilets.
He met Potter’s eyes and the recognition he found in them was almost comical. They were kind, smiling at the edges at first, then they squinted and the irises darted around, scanning Draco’s face. Finally, they widened and Potter snatched his hand away.
Turning to him, they said, “You’re staying,”
Let’s just say it wasn’t an eyesore.
He waited.
He thought, really thought for a second about how easy it would be to let the call go to voicemail, pretend he had really disappeared, never talk to anyone again except the people in this little Scottish village.
“Of course a big-city boy with no taste would say that,” the curmudgeonly old baker replied from behind the counter. But he flashed Harry a smile, which had to count for something.
Then Malfoy looked down and unhooked the ruffle. “Here,” he said, handing it to Harry before stalking off to his wicker chair.
Harry set down his teacup as well. “I’d be happy to take a look, if you’ll show me to it.”
“I’vecometoaskMalfoyforlunch,” he said.
Draco pulled a face. “My dating pool isn’t exactly large to begin with. As far as I know, there’s only one other wizard in this little town, and it’s Potter. Do you want me to date Potter?”
‘Don’t you dare mention Hermione! Wait, why aren’t you calling her Granger, or muggleborn, or other terrible things!’
And half an hour later, Harry tuned into his broadcasting frequency and said words he knew that only his mind healer was listening to. And maybe George.
“Thank you,” Draco said, slamming the door.
Draco had played piano for him once, and now Harry had gone all third-year at Madame Puddifoot’s. It had to be Elise’s old, wise, artsy, and hopelessly romantic matchmaker influence. Not sure how, it just was.
Anywho, Abford isn't a real place in Scotland. If I chose a real place, I'd get too caught up in what exactly the setup of the street is an whatnot. So don't go google mapping anything. I've never been there.
Aurors, Draco decided, could go piss on Merlin’s wand. All of them. Collectively. Make it a circle piss.
“Hey Stella,” He looked down at the big black mutt, currently laying across his legs as he sat in the overstuffed chair he had pinched from the Gryffindor common room before the Hogwarts people redid it. “What time do you suppose it is?”
It wasn’t hard to believe. Draco, despite all his flaws and past misguided beliefs, all his aloofness and cactus-spines, managed to be quite difficult to dislike. Easy to hate, at times, but damn difficult to dislike forever.
Lydia didn’t follow them outside. “I’ll just clean up inside, yeah? Can’t stand the midges, there’s been a lot of them around lately,”
A stupidly familiar voice rang through the drizzly street. “Where’d you run off to, old girl? Who are you making friends with now?”
“I cede, I cede. Draco,”
Don’t hurt him again.
Draco slunk to the door and opened it cautiously. Then decided, what did he care? He was Potter’s inconvenienced houseguest and inconvenienced houseguests pay no mind to things like privacy. It wasn’t like he had a swear an oath to protect the privacy of his host, that his bathroom was not disclosed to him so the world would know.
He chewed and swallowed the pizza. He wanted to resist her hug, but he didn’t have the energy and it was nice to be hugged every once in a while. “I don’t hate him, I don’t think,” he said.
‘Potter, I have a terribly important issue only you can help me with. You see, now that the Wizengamot thinks you’ve gone and died–’
“I wasn’t meaning any harm and hey, sometimes the people we love surprise us. If you really want to move, it can be arranged,”
“Draco’s an interesting name,” She tried again.
“Hullo, Harry,” Ron said.
Harry hid the note. “Salves and stuff. Do you know what they are?”
“They’re re-inspecting former Death Ester residences. If there’s any hint of Dark magic, they’ll condemn us.” He set his cup down. “And we all know what they want to find, they’ll find,”
Malfoy’s bathroom was spartan.
She gave him another curious look and reached into a handbag (pink tulle to match the dress).
“I look sort of like an ocean, don’t you think?” He asked Malfoy as Alexandre made adjustments.
He let himself stop thinking and wandered into the little kitchen. Fuck, right, he remembered, opening cabinets and the fridge, he hadn’t gone grocery shopping in ages. But there was some bread that hadn’t seemed to have gone stale yet, and so Draco made himself some toast for lunch.
“Wanker,” Campbell agreed. “And he insulted you about picking up strays! The nerve of that man!”
Draco assisted in washing the dishes then left.
“No, no. I don’t want to trouble you. I have a feeling it will take a very long time for them to ship anything,” Draco wasn’t accustomed to being aggressively cared for. He didn’t like it.
“That’s as good an answer as any,” She had a thick Scottish accent. “Come over to mine for dinner and you can tell me all about what you plan to put in this dump.”
Malfoy, Draco that is, his trial had been the hardest. Harry had expected to feel satisfaction at the high schoolboy brat brought low, but he didn’t. Malfoy had looked a wreck and Harry had only felt pity. Harry didn’t like feeling pity. So he had stood up when the Supreme Mugwump had asked for dissentions. In the end, Malfoy had gotten six months and house arrest for four years, or one year and completion of a muggle respect and culture re-education program.
Hermione nodded impatiently. “I know that,”
So that was what the pointy pain-in-the-arse had wanted him for.
Then came the period of approximately two months where the papers stopped printing about Potter altogether due to a lack of material. Draco marked the space as the “Shock Factor.”
He decided to title this section of Potter’s public life “Final Straws.”
This chapter includes some description of PTSD and claustrophobia-induced panic attacks. I did conduct research on these symptoms and common tropes so as not to play into them, but if after reading you find it was disrespectful, please let me know.
“Don’t say that.”
He poured over papers, rifled through books, tried to think of anything that wasn’t him. Draco just needed to give Harry a mental break, that’s all. They both probably had a lot to sort through and it was best to do that individually.
Blaise interrupted her. “On second thought, I’ll take some,”
Harry would have shrugged if he hadn’t been laying down, so he settled with a small noise that hopefully communicated the concession. After all, it hadn’t been the first time an inanimate object had been out for his blood, and with his luck it wouldn’t be the last.
“Would I lie to you?”
They’re
He narrowed his eyes.
“Spoiled rich boy or not, I was just angry and I took it out on you,”
He put the bottle back into the cabinet and left.
Harry was too startled to do the sensible thing (hexing Malfoy and running away). Actually, that wouldn’t be the honorable thing, though. Malfoy was evidently staying at the Mum’s as a guest. So wasn’t it Harry’s responsibility to save them from the impending evil and scheming devices of Draco Malfoy?
Draco looked back at her. She caught his eye and had a bemused sort of look on her face. He turned back to Potter and he just nodded, too strucken dumb by this scene to do anything else. His gaze slid to Potter’s lips. He had those full, gorgeous kind of lips that begged to be kissed.
As Malfoy got further away from his mother’s view, the expression on his face changed from pleasant to nearly murderous. Harry wondered if he should pull out his wand.
Draco apparated them to Malfoy Manor, arriving at precisely 11:05. Dreadfully late, of course, so Draco marched them up the front steps rather quickly and rang at the door. Potter made an annoyed sort of noise, so Draco looked at him in exasperation.
He snatched mushrooms and asparagus out of the air, then set some knives up to chopping them. Hermione bustled over with the sauce and cheese.  He handed her a spoon. She still looked helpless.
Custody.
“Interesting couple you are, still calling each other my last names,” Alexandre said, handing a red bundle of fabrics to Harry.
Draco could only nod, as he had just taken a bite of pasta.
He walked to the bathroom, looked in the mirror to study himself. He looked like a drowned rat, fine hair plastered against his forehead, fuzzy on top from humidity. He had mud on his hands and all down his legs from Potter’s dumb dog. Draco turned on the shower.
Or better yet, just bring him a damn meal. Who was he kidding? Malfoy wouldn’t know how to cook canned vegetables any better than he had known how to cook a squash.
Thank Merlin he’d chosen to fake-date someone who could lie nearly as well as he could. His mother was no fool; not anyone would be able to pass her test. Except, Draco thought, this wasn’t much of a test, since Narcissa had more or less ordered him to get Harry Potter’s support.
A day’s work done and tacky paneling no more, Draco retired to his upstairs flat. He had left the radio sitting on the card table. What better day was there to test out the true muggle technological prowess?
It was nice to know that friendships can last.
Draco slammed open the door and looked down the hall. Potter was nowhere to be seen.
“Just you and me, huh, Stella?” he said. Stella perked up sleepily, then rested her head back on the kitchen floor.
As he walked closer to his house he saw that a familiar blond figure was pacing on the porch. Stella ran up to him, nearly knocking him over. He petted her back for a few seconds before he saw Harry. Then he stiffened and stood.
“Do we?”
Narcissa sniffed. “Literature, actually. The muggle television has been broken since you left,”
“Good, then I can tell you how much of a stick he had up his arse. He absolutely loathed Aina and I, but I could never figure out why!”
(also fun fact I've never watched anime before this shit kinda slap but also why are anime fans so scary)
. But then again…
“Could do a lot better, too,” Draco muttered.
Elise nearly fainted out of relief. “Aina can come with, to make sure you come back,”
Blaise exchanged a look with Pansy.
“No,” she said. Harry heard her get up out of the chair and start wandering around the small kitchen. “Is it hard?”
The door at the top of the staircase opened with a creak. Elise stood on the landing.
Pansy made a face and threw the pillow back at him. “You so were. I mean, are,”
“Weasley. Ronald,” he greeted the narrow, unamused face in the fire. “I can’t live here any longer,”
The next door was bare wood. It was locked. Draco frowned, but decided to move on. Whatever secret Potter hid in there wasn’t worth discovering today. And who knows? Maybe he could get Potter to tell it.
Draco stuffed a forkful of noodles into his face. Then he carefully chewed and swallowed them, taking only the slightest bit of delight in the way Hermione grew slightly more annoyed every second that went by. “Right,” he said.
Despite Blaise’s casual tone, Pansy would not have asked for him simply to catch up with tea. It was best, Draco decided, to give her what she asked for. “Where are you? I’ll step through,”
Something was wrong. Harry felt premature tears well in his eyes as he rushed down to Kreacher’s den.
He did not.
By 3:00 today, Narcissa Malfoy would send him an owl.
It had to be around ten.
Harry was gardening again. He had to make sure his little pear tree was adjusting well and all that.
“I thought all the Death Eater shit was over,” Blaise remarked. “The Ministry can’t blame you any more than they can blame themselves,”
In answer, Malfoy snatched one of the books he’d been referencing out of the air. It had an ancient-looking black leather cover. He opened it. “This is a collection of research done by my ancestors concerning the magical properties of Malfoy Manor. Here,” He said, walking over to where Harry lay and dropping the book beside him. “If you’ll read it, it’ll give you a lot of insight into why the case Hermione and I are working on is so nuanced,”
And they were off again, the words floating through the air like birds and clouds and stars. Any other person and Harry was sure they’d be nothing but rocks, but Malfoy had some way of putting life into the little syllables. He had been the sarcastic bachelor at the beginning, then the worrying wife, then a snotty little brat, and now, after Harry nodded for Malfoy to read another entry, he took on yet another character.
Draco sighed. “That would be me.” He grabbed the pen from the boy and drew squiggles on the reciept.
Malfoy sighed. “You’re rather calm about having bodily harm inflicted on you by an unseen force, aren’t you, Potter?”
His stomach grumbled. Damn.
He turned back to Hermione and the pizza. She had this look of determination on her face, like if the circle of sauce and cheese wasn’t precisely concentric to the circle of bread the world would end. She had emptied over three-quarters of the sauce jar and nearly all the bag of cheese already. With a wave of his hand, Harry stopped the knives from cutting more mushrooms and asparagus.
Harry looked at the man who sat at the piano bench with a lost, unguarded expression. He looked content, but the tension in his shoulders and feet spoke of fear. Harry knew fear. Of what, Harry wasn’t sure, but whatever Malfoy was feeling was outlined and highlighted by it.
Alexandre looked relieved.
One of the busts seemed to be saying something to him. It was a middle-aged woman with thick eyebrows and protruding eyes. Her face was mouthing something animatedly, but Harry couldn’t understand anything.
“Really?”
Draco stared at the space she had just left.
Harry made a mental note to ask Campbell and Elise whether they had prepared anything for Malfoy in the past week. Or two, he amended, looking at the crusty onions once more. He moved onto the pantry next to it. There were three slices of bread. He opened the cabinet. It was empty. Next cabinet, also empty. Drawer, three spoons. No forks or knives.
“It was nothing much, really. I messed up there in the middle, and like I told you I haven’t really practiced in the past few years. Or really since I learned that piece. You see, my old instructor had to go away during fifth year and we never really replaced him…” He continued rambling and making excuses for his supposedly less-than-acceptable playing as he put the piano back in order, sliding the fallboard back into place and closing the lid.
“Good. I like it when I’m right.” Harry said. The piano looked dustier than it had yesterday. A thought occurred to him. “Is shit like what it did to me the reason why they want to take the Manor away?”
With love, Pansy, indeed.
seriously though, thank you all for your support and i'll have the next chapter coming within two weeks (no schedule we die like men)!
A misty swan burst through the wall: a patronus. It locked eyes with Malfoy who stood, then it said something to him. Harry tried to read its lips, but considering Harry’s lack of talent reading human lips, it was no surprise he couldn’t make out what it said. Swans don’t even have lips, he thought in a moment of hysteria.
“I figured,”
Kreacher’d been dead for some time, and he’d been expecting it.
“What brings you to Harry’s house, Draco?” She had finally asked.
“Ere a fortnight past, mine own household wast pervaded by a guest of the most unfortunate sort. Lamentably, the dear and most beloved aunt of mine hadst insisted on sending her to the Manor, as she worries I will pass without producing an heir. I swear that I speak unto her that I can find a suitable wife for mine own self, the self-led woman inundates me with brides of her own choosing, each little dame smaller and more youthful than the last. This poor gull I write of could not have reached her sixteenth Michaelmas. In time, as soon as her foot did step across the threshold, the magic in this fair dwelling did shift. After much entertainment on mine part, and much toleration on hers, it came time to show the little lady to her bedchambers. But alas, no bedchambers were there to show!  Even the selfsame room I am so familiar with had disappeared. I was forced to send her away on the very same carriage she had hired (how crass!). But as I lay on the sofa to sleep, I thanked the Manor for its assistance.” Malfoy finished. “Isn’t that interesting?”
“Sure,” Harry said. After all, it wasn’t like there was much else to do. He was a bedridden invalid, and at least Malfoy looked excited about something.
Draco looked up.
“It’s just…” He said, closing and opening them again. “Here, you look,”
He’d definitely seen Kreacher that week.
Harry nodded and smiled, listening to her rant about the importance of competing opinions in democracy. Then he turned back to remove the dough and start the pizza.
Pansy ignored him. “What are you going to do, then?”
“Luna.” He said, taking a step back and brushing himself off. “Surprised to see you here.”
“Yes, thank you, Gelby,” Draco said, ignoring the rapid beat of his heart.
Campbell moved from her chair. “Of course, poor dear. Well, give her our love!”
No, it wasn’t. It was rude and inconsiderate. Potter was intentionally fucking with Draco, and someone has to put a stop to it. That someone had to be Draco, and his means of stopping had to be by winning the game.
ALso sorry this chapter took me ages and ages and ages. (I was kind of failing calculus a little bit but now I'm back on track lol.)
What was taking Malfoy so damn long? Harry huffed and stared at his fingers again. Stubborn little bitches, sons of bitches, daughters of bitches, offspring of bitches. What had Harry done to deserve such dysfunctional digits?
“Yes, please,” Malfoy said. “Did you find the book I was looking for?”
“Careful, it’s a Sneewitchen Mirror,” he said, looking for flashes of cognition in Potter’s eyes.
“Don’t be ridiculous, grandfather. Everyone’s invited every year. Even Arnie was invited before he died,”
“Why did Potter testify for me the first time?” He asked, but Hermione’s face disappeared.
“Not that one!” Elise interrupted before Campbell could even tell any of the story. “You tell it weird. You know Victor down the street? His first wife was the love of his life,” she said, guiding Draco to the sofa.
“Coffee,” He said simply.
Draco nearly smiled at him. “I shall tell my anonymous acquaintance at once. Thank you, Weasley.”
For the next couple hours Draco amused himself with drafting the perfect response. Mr Ager had simply used a return owl, so there was no worry about being recognized via post. Merlin knows Draco’s had enough trouble for a lifetime.
“Hey, Angie,” he said. He sounded too defeated. “Hey, Angie,” he tried again. “And others. Um. Sorry I haven’t been around for the past few days, I– stuff happened and I had to stay at a friend’s house. Well, I say ‘friend,’ but I’m not really sure…”
But night passed into morning without Draco’s permission and he remained rooted to the cold marble. He turned to look at himself in the mirror.
“What, like you do? We’re twenty-one, Potter. It’s not like either of us graduated from culinary school.” Malfoy started to turn back around.
“What time is it, Mrs. Malfoy?” He asked, doing his best impression of Harry-who-has-just-woken-up.
If it wasn’t his old school-mates, then, just who was Harry Potter dating, or shagging, or whatever straight men do?
Blaise laughed, a sound that seemed to bounce off the walls of the flat and into the street below it. “A seduction? Please. If you’re going that route, I’d better be in charge.” He took a look at the ‘Final Straws’ category of Potter’s recent life, his gaze lingering on the ‘Harry Potter: Seduction Artist’ article. “At least you’re his type,”
They moved on to the next shop for dairy and vegetables.
Eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one, ninety-two…
As he blinked away the sleep in his eyes, he recognized the cloud as Luna, dressed in a floaty pink tulle dress.
He’d gone to Snape’s trial, about a month before he’d left. Trial for a dead man gets pushed to the bottom. Harry’d basically gone in, said some stuff, and the mugwumps has put in a request for a plaque and a portrait.
‘That’s good, Draco! A little poke at the Saviour will get him emotionally invested. A spot of genius,’
This was the dance. Gossip, suggestion, dissent. All the dancers knew the tune, knew the steps. Joy comes from a flawless performance. Three dancers, lying and lying just for the kicks.
Lydia slapped Harry’s arm gently. “You’re not being helpful,”
It was diplomacy.
His eyes slid to the list next to it. 4. Seduction. He sighed, rolled his eyes like the dramatic queen he was.
“Probably something that only lesbians understand,” he said sagely.
He finished up the soup and ate it alone. It wasn’t lonely, per say, to eat at his dining table with Stella at his feet like he had become accustomed to almost every day before Malfoy showed up. And even then, he reminded himself, Malfoy hadn’t really come over for dinner, even once.
“Hmmm?”
She leaned forward. “I’d bet you’ll be good to each other again before the Christmas Party,”
Always one to get the last word. Dramatic, the lot of them. Slytherins.
Draco scrambled for his radio, tuning the dials slightly to pick up the signal.
Draco shook his head slightly.
She left.
Weasley. He needed Ron Weasley. There’s a fair chance he knew something about the re-inspection decision, or maybe his fiancee did. Granger was some sort of lawyer-figure, if Draco was remembering correctly.
Draco cleared away Potter’s dishes, then grabbed
Draco shrugged and stepped back, inviting him in.
“And you told them to stuff it, and now you’re happily crusading for every unfortunate with a tragic past and a dollar in their pocket?”
Harry’s eyes closed and everything went dark.
He looked to Luna for help. Serene eyes met his, and with a slight sweep and a look of utter ‘you’ve-gotten-yourself-into-this,’ she turned her attention back to her notebooks. She was writing with both her left and right hands, identical copies. One was presumably for Hermione.
this chapter alternatively titled: draco plays host to every character he wouldn't expect to host.
It was a pitiable offering, but Potter seemed to consider it. He ran a hair through dark, staticky curls, then rubbed his eyes. “Alright, whatever. But if you kidnap me I will turn you over to authorities.”
And didn’t want to watch Narcissa perform cleaning charms. Not just because of the dose of fear he’d receive when she inevitably noticed him and turned, her eyes boring into him, just like Malfoy’s but steelier, less open.
“Honestly, Elise, it’s not like that. Malfoy and I were right enemies. Tortured each other, even. And I don’t mean figuratively. He broke my nose.” He shoved some chicken in his mouth.
As they approached the store, Harry cast a subtle tempus. 11:25. Perfect. Campbell didn’t usually start lunch until 11:30.
Turns out, he only tripped over three objects on the way to the door.
But then Potter opened his eyes.
A ringing sound shot through the ears. Harry reeled them back only to find there was nothing left at the end of the tubes; the ear part had been cursed off.
Campbell made a shrugging noise. “Just hope we haven’t scared off the boy. I was starting to like him.”
It was interesting, Harry noted. As Malfoy walked toward his mother, he picked little bits of dust off his jumper and smoothed out invisible wrinkles. Maybe it was his imagination, but Malfoy even seemed to grow more vibrant as he got closer to his mother. The light blue of his jumper became bluer and bounced off his pale skin even more, which suddenly seemed more like ivory and less like ice. His black jeans (Harry still couldn’t get over the fact that Malfoy wore jeans) grew blacker and his posture straighter, and the click-clack of his fancy little shoes grew crisper.
Was Stella alright? He hadn’t fed her since, God, yesterday morning. She’s a strong girl, she’ll survive, but he felt guilty. She didn’t deserve it; she was just a dog.
Harry whistled for his dog. She emerged from some bush or rabbit den and waited obediently by the back door for Harry to perform a few anti-flea/tick charms. Stella was on an anti-pest potion, but you could never really be too careful.
Malfoy reached over, and hesitantly turned Harry’s hand over. Harry couldn’t tell if it was warm or cold, but it was gentle, Malfoy sliding his thumb under Harry’s wrist, bracing the back of his hand and non-broken knuckles against Malfoy’s palm. A sudden rush of heat threatened to make its way into Harry’s face, but he held his breath to keep it at bay.
Thump.
Malfoy slid the glasses onto Harry’s face, holding them by the hinges. He was so, so gentle, even more gentle than he’d been with his hand, like Harry was a small woodland creature in those rescue films and Malfoy was the scientist administering life-saving care.
Harry could hear the smirk and drawl creep into Malfoy’s voice. His fists clenched almost involuntarily.
God, Ron.
“Draco,” she began. She sat across from him in a green upholstered Victorian-era chair and was sipping a cup of tea.
“So that is a no, sir?”
“Gelby will take sir to Mistress Narcissa,”
Draco had really hoped, for a second or so, that the man who was changing in Potter’s house, the house that probably had notoriously high wards, the house that, the house that as far as he knew, was only home to Potter, wasn’t Potter. If only someone who looked exactly like Potter stood in Potter’s room instead of Potter, well, Draco didn’t know what he’d do in the moment but he knew what he wished to do.
She waited for more. Draco simply looked at her.
Draco sat on the countertop in the bathroom with his eyes closed. His heart was pounding, he could still taste Harry on his lips. He raised a finger to them experimentally, as if by doing so he could relive the sensation.
Draco knew he shouldn’t have left. He knew it, knew it so deeply in his core that it felt like a dream as he stared up at the ceiling in the bathroom, knowing that he should be in the music room with Potter, no, with Harry, explaining about the patronuses and the Manor and his father and all of it. And trying to understand feelings, both his and Harry’s.
Also fun tidbits i've hidden: the pink frilly dress Luna is wearing is based off of Villanelle's from season 2, episode 1 of Killing Eve, and the quote Harry uses is from Tweflth Night (but I'm not telling the original context!). And of course, there are others, but those are my faves.
Harry instructed, “All you have to do is an even coating of both on the crust.” She gave him a grateful look.
Harry had left, that night, without a location in mind.
Malfoy narrowed his aristocratic eyes, but they brightened again as he fixed them on Luna. “And to what do I owe the pleasure?”
“Malfoy, do you even eat anything?”
“I know, Harry, I know,” she said, and he felt her arms around him.
Elise broke it. “
Draco had certainly not been thinking about Potter when he was developing his patronus, so it had to be coincidence. And Draco could only hope that Potter hadn’t been holding a secret obsession with him for years.
Draco sighed.
A moment of silence.
Harry stepped off the platform and rifled through the rack. He toyed with the idea of some blue and red embroidered robes, but decided against it. Too costume-like. Then squeezed between some fuschia and some orange he saw a brilliant emerald green robe. He picked it up, but Alexandre snatched it away.
The teapot whistled. “Earl grey or herbal?”
“No. Why would I?”
“I see you’re adopting strays again,” He said, handing Campbell two mouthwatering loaves, each wrapped in a paper bag.
I'm queer, I support trans rights and black lives matter, and jk rowling can choke on a boot.
He stepped out into the hallway and tried a dirty yellow door. It opened to reveal a closet, nothing special, just some cleaning potions and a laundry basket.
Stella looked up at him. She still didn’t answer.
“Don’t distract me, boy. It is most certainly not. It’s the little blond-headed kid’s name. What are you doing with his old book?”
Campbell dragged him across the street into a little bookstore. Books were jammed into every shelf, nook, and cranny where they would fit, and even piled on the floor. A brilliant purple suede sofa sagged against the far wall. There was single table where Campbell must sell books to customers. A signed poster of David Bowie, along with a few of his records, gazed benevolently over the shop.
Malfoy rose from the bed, letting the blanket fall off him, then he folded it neatly and placing it on the corner. His sweatshirt had risen to somewhere around his mid-back, showing Harry the knobbly bumps of his spine. Malfoy’s ribs stuck out not prominently, but reasonably enough that Harry could tell where they ended. The skin covering them was smooth and pale, and the stripes of light from the blinds formed a pleasing sort of pattern over them. Malfoy adjusted his sweatshirt, pulling it back down to his hips. Harry felt his gaze drifting downward, then checked himself and started analyzing Malfoy’s hair.
She shrugged and object from her handbag in hand, strode over to Malfoy.
“I’ll just be in the hall, yeah?” Potter said, talking to somewhere just to the left of Draco’s face. He gave a brief smile to Mother, opened the door, and left.
George considered it for a moment in silence.
He suspected Potter was thinking similar thoughts, as his face carried and expression that didn’t suit him well: thoughtfulness.
content warning: death of a past character
“So this is what it’s going to be,” he sighed.
He laughed. “God, I’m going crazy,”
He called for Kreacher.
“You know why I came here, Malfoy?”
You know what? Draco refused to think of it any longer. He would simply not. He closed his eyes, forcing his breathing to slow. He’d wake up tomorrow and forget about Potter’s bloody patronus.
He looked over to where Potter was sitting and nearly laughed.
“For the Manor?”
Draco ran a finger along the detailing on the fallboard, following the lines of the golden dragon illustrations. It had been ages since he’d played.
Panting, he slammed the door on the hallway. He looked to his left.
“All spectators rise!” He said.
Pansy grimaced. “Your mother received an owl from Gringotts. They want to inspect the manor for repossession,”
He walked back to the bench Luna and Malfoy were sitting on. “Your mum wants you.”
“Really? Not even a second?” Draco goaded. “Not even the part where I was the most beautiful person in the world?”
“Hey, brightest witch of my age, remember? After–after you left, all the DMLE wizards were hounding me for some internship or something,” she said, throwing her hands up, then laying them to rest on the little table.
“Shit!” Draco said, frowning at the mirror. His reflection frowned back at him. He could never get that self-deprecating tone of Potter’s quite right.
The silence mocked him.
The force pulled him backwards into a room and slammed the door, then released him. Draco stood uneasily, breathing heavily. Lavender walls, bay window, piano.
“Great,” Draco said, attempting to stab another noodle but finding there were none left. “Thank you for the dinner, it was delicious,”
Harry knocked on the door and was greeted by Elise.
. Flute…
Harry was beginning to hate French. Not the people, just hearing it spoken. And not just anyone speaking it, specifically a point blond little tit. Here Harry was, trying to listen to something he’s not supposed to know, and Malfoy and his mum are discussing it in bloody French!
Harry then bid Victor good day and left, Stella happily trotting behind him. It was a little difficult, now that he thought of it, to remember an instance where Stella didn’t trot happily, excepting those in which she galloped happily. She wasn’t a mopey sort of dog, for sure.
“I can send a team, though-”
“I see I’ve ruined your sport, Draco. I might not have if you had taken the courtesy of arriving on time,” Mother said, “I should have had you both for tea, but we shall have to wait for lunch-time,”
He realized this as soon as he saw the knowing little smirk on Potter’s face.
“I was thinking just asking nicely,”
Campbell looked him up and down. “Same side of different coins, I’d reckon,”
At last, the woman made her appearance. She was average height, average build, average face. She was remarkably average if you ignored the paint-stained overalls, bright yellow belt, and bright white flyaway hair. Draco’s overall impression was that of a dandelion puff.
Potter swung the door open, took one look at him, then closed the door in his face. Draco sighed and took a seat on the steps. He sipped his coffee. Potter would have to come out and see him sometime.
Draco forced a laugh. “No, it was my aunt’s. She sent it through the post and it seems to have gotten a little shaken,”
“I see you’ve found the Eros Mirror, Mr. Potter,” A cool, low female voice said, making both of them jump. Mother. “It’s said that if you and your lover each rub one of the figurines, you can tell if the relationship will last based on the smell,”
He didn’t answer. He had a reputation to maintain after all. Just because he was asking for help from Gryffindors didn’t mean he couldn’t be a bitch about it.
“What it means,” Draco spat, “Is they want to sell the Manor to cover their own bankrupt arses,”
He sat at the bench of the grand piano.
“In for what? A lecture?”
The articles caught Potter in increasingly disheveled poses. One, dated a month before his disappearance, showed him at a muggle supermarket in pajama pants smelling peaches. The caption read: Savior of the Wizarding World… Too Good For His Own Kind?
Neither was the maroon that came next.
“Yeah, reading. Some of us can do it without bifocals, don’t you know?”
Draco needed to explain why he ran out like that. Of course, the radio man’s problem and his weren’t that similar, the radio man hadn’t even said what he and Posh Spice had done that had messed up their relationship so much. And from what the radio man had said, it sounded like they had always stood on such firm ground with each other, being enemies then allies. That’s not what he’d felt about Harry at all. He’d never been absolutely sure about where he and Harry stood, only that he didn’t want it to go backwards.
Harry scoffed. “You’d think so, wouldn’t you?”
Draco felt the cane before he could move, a sharp pain busting into his knee. He managed to stay upright for a second, then the cane struck again. Draco fell onto the hard wooden floors.
“Malfoy! Sorry, got a little caught up at Victor’s,” Harry said, running up to him.
Maybe Potter would be forced to give them to him once he saw how beautiful Draco could be in pale blue. Or maybe green? No, Potter’s robes were green. They had to coordinate, not match. Draco liked to think of himself as a good actor, but he could never act like one half of a couple who wore matching outfits.
But Potter muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “you’re the one doing any eye-fucking” and Draco felt his skin burn pink.
1. Changes in patronus form means that the core source of a person’s happiness has changed. This is most commonly due to recovery from a depressive period.
In light of The Pandemic: I hope you all stay healthy and well in these coming months! My country is pretty much entirely under societally-enforced social distancing measures, and I'm going to be in online school for the rest of the semester. Times like this seem terrifying, but remember to take everything one step at a time. It's okay to take a two-hour long bath, and it's definitely time to brush up on those Duolingo courses you've been avoiding. Stay healthy and don't hoard!
Harry had said he did.
-ed it, then dropped the ashes out his window into the back alley. They landed on some sort of black muggle box. He checked to make sure no muggles were around, then summoned it up. It was a clunky thing, black with dials and lines and a few holes. It also appeared to be smashed in several places. Lovely. Draco could feel a kinship with it.
“‘Let’s try again.'
At precisely 2:00 pm, the floo rang.
It was funny to see Potter draw back so quickly, blush even under his dark skin and darker suntan.
He was still in the west wing. He had to be. And yet nobody had cleaned these walls in some time and dust was floating everywhere. Draco took a few steps and looked behind him to see his footprints in a layer of dust.
Sorry this took a minute. I would have had it updated wayyyyy sooner, but I had finals a few weeks ago and then I had to turn my school laptop in. Now I've got my grandpa's dinosaur laptop up and running, but no promises on how soon I'll have the next one up.... hopefully before summer's over.
And he saw the empty bed. He saw it with his mindless little eyes and he tried to process it, but the damn fog in his brain didn’t let him. The daylight streamed through the window, rays of sunshine illuminating little dust specs and falling gently on the makeshift bed, sheets mussed like its user had just stepped out to take a piss in the middle of the night.
Pansy was experimenting with calling everybody ‘darling.’ She felt it gave her that certain air of unattainability she liked so well. Draco felt it gave her that certain air of a matronly Victorian aristocrat. He told her as much, she stuck her tongue out at him.
“Yes, going to round up the Squoggles then buzz away. Don’t think you’re in a position to take guests.” She gave him a wry smile.
The women apologized profusely to each other and to him, interrupting each other and making a general kindhearted cacophony.
Draco turned so he was walking backwards, catching Potter off guard. He stumbled, but didn’t fall. Pity. “It’s just some old mirror, Potter. No magic involved,” he said, whirling back around.
A young woman in her late twenties or early thirties stepped into the room. She stopped and stared at Draco for about thirty seconds. “Yes, grandfather?” She said, still staring at Draco.
He let Draco measure out some skele-gro, which Harry took in his right hand (the unbroken one) and downed. Its slimy texture slid down his throat, and Harry tried to clear his mouth of the taste as best he could. It tasted like what Harry imagined electrocuted bones to taste like.
“I’ve been asking around, and I’ve landed an interview for your favorite magazine,”
“Whichever you have most of,” Draco didn’t care much for tea, a fact he rarely disclosed to any self-respecting Englishperson. Too many cups shoved into him as a child, he supposed.
He supposed if one squinted a bit and wrinkled one’s nose Potter could be considered fit, at least the back view of him. The face was, of course, hideous. Draco’s perceptions were addled that day, so he couldn’t be to blame. And he had remembered that man as tall. Potter was not, had never been, and will not ever be tall.
grade.
Draco gave him a half-smile he hoped was comforting. “I’ll take you to your room, father.”
“If it wouldn’t be too much trouble.”
Potter had the dignity to look confused. He cocked his head like a puppy, green eyes wide and sparkling but with the depth of an ocean.
“How long you plan to be here?”
The room smelled like an old book. It wasn’t an unpleasant smell, just one that indicated the room hadn’t been used all that much recently. Dust particles danced in the sunlight, and Narcissa seemed to be doing some subtle cleaning charms across the room.
Draco raised an eyebrow. If Luna thought someone was odd, they must be very odd indeed.
Or the violet.
“Thank God he just said something normal,” Lydia muttered.
Harry’s hair was going to be awful when it dried. In the past year or so, he had learned about the magic of conditioner, and now his hair had turned from black mass of frizz to black mass of curls, which was a marked improvement.
And waited.
His mother sighed. “And what will you have me do, then? If we call anyone, we’ll get the Manor taken immediately.”
Weasley lifted a ginger eyebrow. Or at least, it was assumed it was ginger. The green of the floo made it hard to tell.
He nodded. “Just me,”
He nodded.
He turned into the Mum’s bookstore, vibrant and orange as always. Stella, of course, stayed outside. Once in, he noticed a stack of books perched precariously on an overstuffed armchair. The top one was a trashy gay porn novel (Harry still didn’t know why Campbell stocked those things). The second one was clearly used. Nearly half the pages had been dog-eared at some point and “D. Malfoy” was written on the bottom of it in sharpie.
” Draco shouted, pointing his wand at an entire wall. It turned grey. It was disconcerting to know it was supposed to be even more discolored. At least the stain disappeared. Merlin, it might be better to just tear the whole place down and rebuild. Maybe that way he could build furniture into the flat rather than rely on a crusty card table, single folding chair, beige sofa, and television stand. There was no television. He could transfigure it into more tasteful furnishings, but everyone knew transfigured items were vastly inferior. Besides, REFS had said his shipment would arrive within the week. Draco could stand a few days in squalor.
Speaking of squalor, he received a muggle appliance catalogue on his doorstep yesterday. He picked it up, then spent the next half hour on the musty sofa circling different ones and imagining their functions. The engenuity of muggles, if nothing else, was admirable.
“I’ll have to collect my things in order to spend the night,”
“Oh yes, the most delicious bread. I really couldn’t ask for a better baker.”
A misty swan burst through the wall; Mother’s patronus. It locked eyes with him, then opened its mouth to speak:
“Of course not. And I’m not even sure that’s a real paper.” She was French braiding the hair at his temples, now, and he swore he could feel her disappointment in his uneven haircut.
(See the end of the chapter for
? What are you doing back there?”
Soup would take what, twenty minutes at most? Harry would be able to sate Malfoy’s strange supper urge and his own hunger in no time.
He and Luna had been friendly for nearly two years now. Just before his trial, they had thrown him in Azkaban for a couple weeks. Luna had visited him every other day, smuggling in good food and her favorite novels. She said she was only repaying him for what she owed to him. That much was true. Draco had given her an Ollivander bread and fruit when they were imprisoned in his basement. But Luna had continued visiting him periodically even outside Azkaban and they had struck up a friendship.
All of Potter’s soup was gone, and his head was resting in his hand, eyes closed.
“You see, I had thought everyone would be better off without me. I was so caught up in what I could’ve done to make everything better now. Survivor’s guilt, my therapist said. I couldn’t face anyone. So I left. But now, I’m trying to come back. And not everyone’s letting me, but I’m going to keep trying,”
But it wasn’t just up to Draco. He had to do this for his mother, if for no one else.
Stella, of course, was ecstatic.
On a whim, he shoved the muggle radio into his backpack as well.
This was supposed to be on the second floor, Draco thought. He walked to the window. Sure enough, it was at least twenty-five feet off the ground. Draco took a seat in the bay window and turned to the interior.
Malfoy? Loyal? Also an interesting choice. But Narcissa spoke with such a stately air that Harry didn’t dare correct her. He figured the best course of action would be to listen to her speech, thank her, and leave. Then just get through the trial, help out if he could, and get back home.
“Not anymore, Draco. They… they pulled him back up. We are undone, Draco, we are undone! Hide your mother,” he repeated with more urgency than before.
This chapter was entirely Harry omg i'm spoiling y'all. also obvious: i speed wrote this chapter holy crap you guys. i've been publishing as soon as i write them and wow. i just had to crank this one out for y'all. the next update should be before december if i'm being optimistic. but, feel free to bother me if it takes me more than a month to update
Mother wouldn’t be able to see under the bench, where his foot was currently trapped by Potter’s.
Malfoy sat there for quite awhile, apparently looking at nothing.
Stella zig-zagged through the mostly empty street. She sniffed every rock, peed on every patch of grass. Stella was just such a dog, and Harry loved her for it.
He stood up from the flimsy card table in his living room. “It’s not like you have anything to do at your home,”
“You’re not in the Carribbean, are you?” Ron didn’t sound mad. He sounded… exasperated.
And so Harry cleaned his vegetables, watered his plants, made his dinner, talked to his dog. It was nice. It was simple. It was predictable. And he liked it. Harry Potter liked being the resident old man gardener, despite that he was only twenty. He was an old man at heart, goddamnit.
If Narcissa was surprised that Draco used his father’s given name, she hid it exceedingly well.
And waited some more.
“Thank you Harry, I’ve been reading quite a bit, recently.”
Time to have some fun.
The walk to Potter’s house was, if nothing else, wet. It had started to rain. At least this way, Draco thought, Potter would have no choice but to invite him in. What kind of cruel, unfeeling individual would throw a person out in the rain?
Elise raised an eyebrow at the dishes she was clearing.
“Mother!”
His reflection didn’t look scared. He looked like an asshole, the curve of his lips and the shadows under his eyes and his nose pointed up like he’d just smelled a particularly nasty pile of horse dung. Draco sighed. If only he could stay locked in the bathroom forever, prevent him from ever looking anyone in the eyes again.
Kreacher stared up at a picture he’d stuck to the ceiling. There was Regulus in it, and Sirius, as children. As the photo moved, the young Sirius pinched Regulus in the arm and Regulus started and wound up to punch his brother. They were both smiling.
“So get out. Okay? You’re not wanted.”
Because Draco really didn’t want to think about the implications of a matched patronus pair with Harry Potter. Merlin knows they’d end up as the first documented case to slice each others’ heads off over who had eaten the last tangerine in the refrigerator. And that’s if they tolerated each other enough to marry.
They stopped. Harry waited until Ron started again.
“But he wasn’t sure if that was fair. So he asked Georgia about it and she said that she didn’t want to date a man with a guilty conscience. And Victor realized that it wasn’t his wife holding him back, it was himself. And now they’re the happiest couple who’d ever complain about you breathing too much air.”
“Actually, please do. I’m somewhat of an amateur potioneer myself,”
“Heya!” She stuck out her hand. “I’m Campbell. Aila Campbell,”
He found himself looking at Draco’s hands again, looking at them twist around pens and papers and book covers.
“I was just telling your mother about the time you let a sheep into my house and it pooed all over the floor,” Potter said, smile still on his face, but there was a competitive edge in his eyes. “Made a right mess of the place. You never did tell me exactly how it got in,”
“You’ve picked up any of his lingo?” Harry asked Lydia as soon as the kitchen door swung shut behind them.
“Thank you all for your hospitality,” He began. “But I’ll be heading over to mine now,”
While Harry moved the piano, Malfoy rifled through several folders on a shelf for the piece he wanted. He flipped through the one he chose, then moved to the end of the piano to lift the lid. He lifted it only a few inches, probably because the music room wasn’t exactly large. Then he sat at the bench, right in front of Harry. He’d angled the piano so that Malfoy was sitting in profile from Harry’s perspective.
Draco laughed at the headline, but maybe there was something to it. First, muggle photographs. Potter was likely to ward against wizarding cameras, but if he was truly dating exclusively muggles, warding against muggle cameras would be inconvenient at best. Draco didn’t know a lot about muggles, but he did know they seemed very attached to their cameras. Second, the nature of the article gave its truth away. If there was only one article, the Harry Potter Cleanup Squad (aka Granger and Luna) was able to hush up the news before it reached major papers. If there was news to hush up, the news must be true. Harry Potter was at least a little bent, and he was very into blondes.
At least there was a storefront downstairs and a floo. REFS also offered employment for their ‘cases.’ Draco was going to start a coffee shop. With any luck the Scots would appreciate fine coffee when they saw it.
Her eyebrows knit together.
“Don’t do that, you
Malfoy said nothing, which Harry took as permission.
Malfoy rambled on about coffee brewing methods and books on entrepreneurship and consumer psychology for the entire walk. His hands danced while he spoke, punctuating the right sentences with a wave of the wrist or a little twiddle of the fingers. Harry found himself completely entranced. It was like watching a ballet; every movement was so precise, so intentional, so natural, and yet Harry knew that he could never hope to emulate it. Malfoy was a performance. And that didn’t say anything about his hair–
bruh this chapter was so hard to write and idk why. maybe it's the obscene amount of anime I've consumed in the past two months that has been hindering my productivity... guess how many shows I've watched...
So no help from Luna.
And Draco and Potter were left standing, facing each other.
Malfoy nodded to it, and he could have sworn the swan gave Harry a reassuring glance before it dissipated.
A regular storm of vegetables rained down on the pizza, making Hermione jump back in surprise. Some of the sauce puddle splashed onto her shirt. She removed it magically, frowning.
Draco started rehearsing his opening speech. He could start strong, like ‘Potter, I have a problem only you can help me with.’ Or maybe a weak, pitiful opening such as ‘Potter, I’m so sorry to disturb you, but you’re the only person I can turn to.’
But when Malfoy took a seat next to him, he softened and even gave Harry a little smile. Their thighs were touching. Those strands of hair were in his eyes again, and Harry had the strange compulsion to push them away. Had Malfoy been confunded or slipped some sort of potion? Harry took a mental list of suspects, but no one had any motive. And he had no idea what sort of potion would require physical contact.
Draco had always said anyone could tell Blaise liked both from a mile away.
Where was Pansy when you needed her? What would she say?
..seem to have messed things up between me and a friend of mine. Well, not really a friend. I dunno. We’ve been a lot of things...
Harry had strained to hear the creaks of the ancient elf moping around the halls, his little mutterings about how Harry was a disgrace to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. And then Harry hadn’t been able to bear it. Damn it all, he wanted someone to tell him off. He knew he’d done wrong, why couldn’t someone up and tell him so?
“Hey, Stella,” he said. “What do you think about visiting Luna today?”
Harry shook his head.
The ringing in his ears was out in full force. He searched for something, some variation in the cramped darkness surrounding him, but nothing was there. He knows nothing was there, and yet he can’t stop his eyes from frantically scanning the cabinet. He can’t stop his limbs from trying to shake despite the force surrounding them. This isn’t real, this can’t be happening, he thought. How absurd that Harry should be in Malfoy’s house, imprisoned by something Malfoy doesn’t seem in charge of and is controlling Malfoy as well. Harry felt himself spacing out, losing touch with reality.
Harry almost laughed. Enjoyment and Malfoy did not fit in the same sentence.
I will not hesitate to rewrite this chapter and details from several others and adjust the plot of my story accordingly. That being said, I did not include immersive graphic descriptions of anything.
No time for that, though, because Potter had his hand held out for a handshake.
Each dish sent a thrill through his heavy mind. Toujours Pur. Fuck that, he thought. This teacup? Always broken. And he flung it against the wall, its saucer close behind. His muscles burned after ten or fifteen, but God, it was more alive than Harry had felt in months.
He could hear himself panting, the sound echoing in what little space there was. But then something shoved its way between his tongue and the roof of his mouth, gagging him. Harry’s ears started ringing and he didn’t know whether he should open or close his eyes, given that the view was the same.
Blaise snatched the bottle out of Pansy’s hand. “A toast to Draco and his eloquence!”
“I know. But I don’t like it,” he pouted, knowing it made him sound and look childish and selfish. “I miss him,”
“No,” Harry said. “So I won’t even know if you make a mistake. It’ll probably improve chopsticks: Russian edition, at any rate,”
Harry nodded.
“Malfoy, I’m sorry about the Harry thing. I wasn’t...” Weasley stopped for a second.
“Do you even know how to cook?”
It was a full, yet strangely tinkly laugh. It was the sort of laugh that was too loud in libraries but too quiet in pubs, and the sort of laugh he’d know anywhere, no matter how much time had passed.
The kitchen was as decidedly smart as the front room, painted a cheery yellow. Lydia closed the door and set a teapot on the stove.
Draco came to the same bend in the road Potter’s dog had been lurking at yesterday. The two sheep from yesterday were there instead.
Just as he’d predicted, Lucius sat behind the desk looking out at the grounds. He looked so out of place, his expression like a parent forced to clean out a nursery. It was so sad, and so empty.
“You poked around Abford for several hours, but even after asking the neighbors, you found no sign of Draco Malfoy,” Potter said firmly.
She gave an exaggerated gasp. “Not the Alexandre Lefevre ones you ordered me! I’ll never cope!”
He whisked on the robes and wished Potter had had the providence to provide him with a mirror. Maybe then he could straighten out the mess he was sure his hair was.
“Unless your new name is Draco Malfoy–”
“Draco’s an interesting name,” Elise remarked, washing her hands in the kitchen sink. “You’ll have to excuse me. I didn’t realize we were having company tonight,” See said with a pointed look at Campbell.
Harry took the robes. “It’s no problem to me, Alexandre.”
“You won’t be able to banish the magic until Lucius dies. Which,” she added, seeing Draco’s expression, “will likely not be in the next month or two.”
“Hermione,” he said. She started at the sound of her given name, then seemed to remember she asked him to call her that. “I met him earlier today. He said he didn’t want to see me again,”
He didn’t let Pansy and Blaise visit, and he didn’t go and see Campbell and Elise. During the day he would stare at the walls, or at the space where the coffee shop was going to be. He got groceries, finally.
10:12
Lucius would be furious. He hated being
She sniffed hello to the pair of sheep that had taken to hanging around near the little bend in the street in between his house and Campbell and Elise’s. The larger sheep blinked at Stella with a clear aura of generic disdain, but the smaller one timidly sniffed Stella back. Harry bent down to give the smaller one a scratch behind the ears, but the larger one butted into Harry’s hand before he could reach it.
He frowned, water pouring down his back. The dog had been nice. Can’t fault her for being attached to Potter. If being overly attached to Potter was a sin, the vast majority of the wizarding world would be rotting in hell.
But Draco had been the one to lean in the first time, right? His subconscious whispered. You may be dense, but you know how to read basic social cues by now, Harry.
Harry resolved to call him names more often.
“If mildew is your comfort scent,” Blaise added.
oh well.
“This is really good!” He said, interrupting her.
Draco nodded and saw himself out. Luckily, it seems, he’s already found Potter.
“Have you eaten or drank anything today?” Harry asked before Malfoy could do anything more.
Weasley seemed to consider this for a second. “Malfoy, last I heard, Harry was completely out of the country. He had a place in some Caribbean island. That was a year ago. I think whatever you heard, it isn’t true. I know Harry. He wouldn’t lie to me,”
Draco nodded. “Hermione said the program was the culmination of several different Ministry efforts, not all of them as well intentioned as they came across,”
“Are you leaving?”
Okay, so the shoulder, the fingers, and the ankle weren’t exactly the sexiest parts of the body, but Harry was going to make do with what he could get.
“Lucius.” Draco repeated. “While Lucius is still…” He left the statement open, not wanting to say ‘dead’ but not wanting to not say it either. “Where is he, anyway?”
They sat at the card table, Potter still claiming Draco’s chair. The soup was surprisingly good, but Draco supposed it shouldn’t have been a surprise. After all, the man
They walked together the whole two kilometers there not in any semblance of silence. See, Harry somehow knew the right questions to discover that Hermione and Ron had a nice little flat in wizarding London not too far from Diagon. Ron’s job was terribly taxing at the moment, mostly menial tasks and enforcement, but Hermione was glad for it. As Harry was discovering, she didn’t want an exciting life full of risks anymore, and had begun to realize she had never wanted it.
As soon as they were out the door, Campbell and Elise began cackling like mad geese.
“No, they pay people off. But Blacks know how to read a situation, and this situation calls for groveling.” Narcissa motioned for him to rise. “Good day, Draco. Come back soon,”
Draco nodded. “Coffee?”
Must have just been the Manor creaking. It was an old building, after all.
It didn’t answer and instead sniffed his hand cautiously. Draco gave it a scratch behind the ears. It seemed to enjoy it.
“Of course I do, Potter. I was excellent at potions and I grew up with plenty of food. It’s only natural I knew how to prepare it,”
Draco walked up the steps and poised to knock. His knuckles rapped the green-painted wood of the front door. He heard the dog bark and felt the telltale ripple of wards alerting the owner. Surprisingly, Potter hadn’t warded against Draco. That wasn’t a bad sign.
“Absolutely not. I don’t know if he even charges money, half the time,” she said, busying herself with the kettle. “What type?”
Stella was a creature of routine.
“We’re literally neighbors, Malfoy. If you wanted me to know something you could have just, I dunno, walked down the street and told me?” Harry said. “Now what sort of appointment?”
“That you knew where Harry is," she continued. "If you can convince him to help, he’d be your best chance.”
Elise spoke up. “Sorry for keeping you waiting, love. We’ll be up right now if you want,”
Of course they’d let him in. Classic helpful Potter charm. “Whatever. Just take me there so I can change. And put on some decent clothes, yourself. I didn’t take you to Alexandre’s just for the fun of it, you know,”
anyway, I love comments!! please tell me if you're enjoying the read so far, if I should get on my horse and update faster, and especially if you're not enjoying it or are disappointed. I welcome criticism!!
Lucius’s icy cold claw of a hand grabbed at Draco’s elbow.
George frowned. “I thought it was the 30th,”
Ginevra didn’t really count, since they had (Draco was fairly certain) actually been shacking together for some time.
Stella barked at something. Or rather, someone, as Harry’s wards alerted him.
Anyways.
“Good question. I’m actually, um, just taking an inventory right now. Finding out what to fix, based on my large repertoire of cooking skills,” He said, turning back to his assortment of cookware.
“Thank you,” Draco said. “And seriously, I don’t need you to do this for me. I could manage well enough on my own,”
he filled the press with nearly boiling water, then stirred the mixture with his wand. Draco liked to put a little bit of magic in his morning coffee. It made him feel like a renowned potions master. He set a timer for four minutes precisely. Weasley looked ready to implode and cast subtle
Harry checked the time. A little past eleven. They would still be able to catch Malfoy before lunch if they put the pizza in at eleven-fifteen.
It connected with a whump.
“What the fuck? Leave, Malfoy.” He said, all remnants of relaxation gone from his body. “I’m not interested in any interviews for whatever shit reporter you’ve got up your sleeve.”
Certainly not the yellow.
also can you tell I'm a huge fashion nerd yet?
Harry grinned, snatching his wand and floating the piano around. This way, he’d be able to make sure Malfoy didn’t cheat and play a recording or something. And if he got the opportunity to watch the way Malfoy’s facial expressions inevitably shifted with the music he was about to play, betraying passion and vulnerability.
“Good, you’re awake,” It said. “Thought I might find you like this,”
The ghost of a smile on Draco’s face faded at once, schooled into careful blankness.
He marched up the stairs, each step making his heart beat a little faster. Malfoy was up there, probably doing something cool and interesting and intellectual and posh like reading a book in French or doing tests on different brewing methods for coffee.
It read:
“Nor shall I attempt to persuade you back to the Manor. If you are here, Draco,”
Harry nodded, then he scrambled to prop himself up on the downy pillows, which was difficult when his left arm was immobilized from the shoulder down and his right hand was similarly out of use. He shifted his hips and, ignoring the pain in his foot, wiggled into a sort-of-comfortable position. At least he could see more of the room, now, though.
“Opinions on David Bowie?”
“But, you did meet a me, a stranger who looked nothing like Harry Potter and offered to show you where he really was–”
Harry took the pizza out of the oven. It had been done about twenty minutes ago, but the heating and cooling charms on his oven had made sure it was cooked perfectly (the exact configuration of those charms were a secret he’d only publish if he was very low on cash). He cast a stasis charm.
“I apparated… our friend… to London, alley hear where I told him I would go. But my problem,” He smiled without humor, “Was to give him an actual Wizarding neighborhood. So I pop in the alley, and he makes such a commotion. He says, ‘Oh, thank you, sir, for taking me here! I shall check around and report to you if I find Mr. Malfoy!’ And I tell him NO, that won’t be necessary, I’ll just look for it in the
He opened another door. A dusty little library. Lucius didn’t like dust. He liked cleanliness, especially if he hadn’t been the one to do the cleaning.
In all honesty, this was probably impolite curiosity on his Mother’s part and a willingness to play up any charade for Draco’s sake. In other words, the test was more for Draco than it was for Potter: it was a test to see how good a job Draco had done at securing the support of the Savior of the Wizarding World.
Draco felt his pulse calm, he reminded himself to unclench his hands. Potter had paused to take a sip of coffee, and Draco began noticing a little more about the man. His hands were ribboned with little white ropey scars, and a whole garden’s worth of dirt resided under his fingernails. As he talked, Potter pulled little bits of it out and rolled it between his fingers before Vanishing it.
Funny, that.
Just as he had been trying to become someone new.
“I’ve only just had the chance. If I’d known little bookstores got you this worked up I’d have told Ron too,” This remark fell on deaf ears as Hermione was already engrossed in whatever shelving system (or lack thereof) Elise had set up. “I’ll just go find Malfoy myself, yeah?”
Campbell had said he’d know the house when he saw it due to all the plants. Draco stopped in front of a white clapboard two-story. Every window seemed to have its own plant, not to mention the vegetable garden sprawling from behind. Daisies littered the space under the porch.
Campbell answered. “Go down the road about two kilos and his is the one with all the plants. If you just wanted to have a chat, then he’ll be around next Wednesday for lunch or maybe sooner,”
Draco looked up.
“Where is Lucius?”
Then he leaned over, and Harry’s eyelids slid closed and his lips parted involuntarily. Once he’d realized what he’d done, the warmth he had barely been keeping at bay flooded into his cheeks. Malfoy didn’t seem to notice what he’d done though, as he was carefully lining up the temples of the glasses with Harry’s ears.
“I don’t, in case you’re wondering. I’m going to be doing many things besides thinking about Potter. I’m so productive,” He said to the remains of his lunch. “I will! Just you watch,”
“The point is that I should go after him.” Draco would say, sighing, resigned, and yet he would feel the determination coursing through his veins. He’d be so scared it would turn into adrenaline or something and yeah, it would probably be a shitshow, Draco ending up frozen and mumbling, Harry looking torn between crying and hexing his bollocks off. But he’d have to try.
“Anyway, weather report, there’s some sheep that keep watching me from across the garden. It’s a pair of them, the larger one kind of looks like he’d rather be anywhere else and the smaller one is always butting its head into the larger one to make it move. But the larger one always moves. It’s weird. Maybe I should give them names. I’ll sleep on it.”
As the blue light encircled Mr Ager’s head, his eyes grew unfocused and glassy.
He nodded and all but ran out of the store. Stella jumped up and licked his hands. He pushed her down with a light smile. “No, Stella. We have espionage to do.”
“Should be,” Draco mused. “I know a lad who’d pay good money for it,”
This was a rather awkward thing to say, as Draco was further ahead on the staircase and staircases aren’t known for their mobility. Draco, at first, tried to circle around his mother. Then he realized the futility and simply descended the staircase the rest of the way, letting his mother lead after that.
It was a wonderful Wednesday afternoon to be alive. Draco left the articles strewn about the flat. He would continue preparing the shop for a couple hours, and then he would go see Campbell and Elise about a dinner.
“Mother, tell me that’s not what we’re going to do,” Draco said, worry creeping into his voice. “Mother?”
And that was that.
He blinked, swallowed his mouthful of pasta. This seemed like a test. “I don’t quite share his penchant for tight pants, but I believe if I had been alive when he was popular I would have had his poster,”
,” he said. “
“The aurors read everything, I know,” Draco said. “I was there at the trial. It was nearly three years ago. You don’t have to walk on eggshells around me.” He tried for a reassuring smile.
Harry looked down to the book his hand was resting on. Twelfth Night.
Victor had been enthralled, but now a crafty gleam lit up his wrinkly face. “You just had to, didn’t you?”
He decided to air his last remaining grievances by drafting another letter to Mr. Orion N Ager. This one insinuated that Draco had a qualified lawyer on hand at all times. After the letter was on its way, he began packing a change of clothes and the like in a backpack. Even though Campbell and Elise had royally put a damper on Abford, he couldn’t disappoint them by sleeping in his own flat.
“I was in the midwest originally. Are you familiar with the midwestern United States?”
“So are we friends, then?” Potter asked.
Draco’s usually razor-sharp gaze went cloudy and unfocused, then, and his breathing accelerated. Harry didn’t want to blink, wanted to see the sight of the night without Draco, because Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Then Harry blinked and Draco was gone.
“You really think you’re the only wizard in Abford? Please. I was a fourth year when you were sorted. I’m a Hufflepuff, in case you were wondering,”
Blaise’s dark eyes grew mockingly wide. “You mean you’ve had action in the past year? Someone call
y'all october is over!! the busiest season of the year: done. I should be able to update a little more often now, hopefully I'll have another one up in 2-3 weeks. also hehe I love comments
Lydia passed him a steaming cup. “My God. What did he do to you?”
Harry fiddled with the transmitters on his transmitter. He didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to talk about it without knowing his place in everything. Was he the hero? Was he the scorned lover, or the unwitting mistress, or just a way to forget? He sighed. It was a quarter until ten. Stella moved to stand over his feet.
“I’m worried, Draco,” she said, sitting on the floor.
“Elise,” Draco asked at breakfast the next morning. “Where, exactly, does Harry Potter live? I should… like to meet his acquaintance again,”
“I suppose it’s about nine-thirty. So I think we need to get ready for–”
He turned to where she indicated, and saw Malfoy soundly asleep on the sofa. He looked strangely peaceful, and yet remarkably tired. Though the deep line of concern and disdain had smoothed over, Harry could now see wrinkles and bags under Malfoy’s eyes. They were the kinds of wrinkles and bags that accumulate after years and years of haunted dreams and hunting sleep. They wouldn’t be erased for months. Malfoy was clenching a book in his hands, turned upside down like he had finished the last page and immediately passed out.
Draco bit his lip and stayed crouched. Maybe if he looked into the ground intensely enough, it would swallow him whole. This wasn’t how the meeting was supposed to happen.
“Yes,” a gravelly feminine voice said from behind him. “Your flat is lovely,” she said.
“You’re so right, brilliant, and wonderful, Malfoy. I’m sorry for permanently marring your otherwise perfect physique by trying to kill you in sixth year.”
Afternoon came, and Harry was tempted to ask Draco to read aloud again, like he had yesterday, but something about the tension in Draco’s shoulders and the intensity of his eyes stopped him.
Draco felt his eyes growing heavy, and he switched off the radio. Tomorrow, he decided, he would have a talk with his mother about the manor.
Oh, yeah, pizza, Malfoy, Hermione. He reached out to pet his dog. She leaned into him and sat on his lap.
A light blush spread over Malfoy’s cheeks, but he hid it in the book. “January twentieth, 1632…”
He provided her voice. “Unsatisfyingly tepid, wouldn’t you say?”
On cue, Campbell bustled up to the entryway. “Come in, Harry, lad. The food will get cold!”
So pale blue it would have to be.
Campbell nodded. “I’m not your mother, lad–”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That wasn’t a dig at your mother, just at you. Percival and Charles have wonderful manners,” Draco let the hint of a smug smile creep onto his face. “And I’m not in the mood for talking politics, so if this isn’t a social call I’ll be very disappointed. How is your fiancee?”
He needed to move forwards.
He had slammed the papers onto the table next to him, knocking some china cups off. They shattered on the cold stone floors. The sound pierced Harry’s ears and with it, a little more blood pumped through his ears. A little more life pumped through his heart. His gaze had fallen on the cabinet in the corner proudly displaying best Black china, and in an instant he was on it.
