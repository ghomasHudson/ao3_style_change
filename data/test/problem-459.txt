Draco thought to himself. He was fighting for his life, and this man was sitting here laughing at him instead. But was it really Harry who jumped into the pool at that time and saved him? Why? Wasn't it obvious in his anger that Harry had decided to kill him? Why did that man change his mind?
Pansy was clearly dissatisfied. She sighed and looked at Draco with a slight smirk. "Are you sure that's all?"
"Why?"
Empress Draco Lucius Malfoy's smile grew wider as he imagined that he would soon descend to the dance floor and be able to show off their closeness to another noble couple that had made him heart a little envious.
I wouldn't have come this far if it weren't for you, my dear readers ❤️
Draco nodded confidently. It really feels like getting a lottery.
"Huh?" Draco asked reflexively as he lifted his head so he could see Harry's face.
Draco wasn't prepared for this beforehand. Since the first time they met, Ares was always polite to him. Even when they were riding, he kept his hand away. His gentle behavior contradicts all the rumors and impressions of his character.
Harry looked at Draco in disbelief. "You think I can do anything else?! I promise you can keep my promise. Now, let me help you drink!”
"Mr. Draco, are you all right?" asked the maid when she saw Draco's face, which partially looked pale.
"Calm down. You're on the ground. You can breathe normally," Harry's voice brought Draco back to his senses.
"We were only tasked with picking you up and bringing the king of Sparta a wedding present. Ares didn't say anything about this," Alastair shook his head regretfully.
"Did it work?" the man asked quickly.
"Nothing is embarrassing to your husband, Draco,"
Starategos was the position currently held by Hector. He was a respected general of war and often gave brilliant results in ground battles. Sparta was a country known to have a strong military. Currently, they were still at war with Thebes and their allies. In contrast, the city of Athens was more often neutral.
Harry brought his mouth down to bite Draco’s neck, drawing out an aroused cry as he broke the skin for the umpteenth time. Draco shook at the feeling. He didn’t know if he had ever wanted to come so badly after his previous tenth orgasms. He attempted to grind his neglected erection against the tiled wall, but Harry growled and squeezed his arms to keep him in place.
"Can I do some things in your palace?" Draco asked.
"You have agreed to the terms put forward by our Oracle more than a week ago. You can't back down anymore. Even God Ares has graciously brought all these gifts. Do you want to oppose it?" Alastair asked in an even tone.
"I want to choose a horse."
Draco felt his hand hurt a little. The female messenger dressed as an Amazonian warrior apologized to him several times. Draco was amazed at how calmly she was facing the dozens of male soldiers while still protecting himself. Apparently, she's not perfect. A spear tip hit her shoulder because she was off guard. Like zombies smelling blood—the soldiers immediately focused on her and attacked her.
. He didn't understand how his soul could transfer to the body of another young man who lived two thousand years ago. A bit of his logic still believed that maybe he was involved in a super-sophisticated and expensive television entertainment project.
"Okay. Good night." Harry nodded, glancing at Arabelle for one last time before he moved out of the room.
The King of Delion looked stunned when he saw Harry carrying a weeping woman in his arms. As a man who had been drugged with love, he was, of course, aware that at this moment, Harry was worried about the young woman in his arms.
Icarus took out his sword and split it in half. Though, the sword remained the same, and another sword appeared. "This is a sword covered in the blood of thousands of angels who have died fighting demons. With this, you can kill those demons," explained Icarus.
Ron's ideas gradually gave Harry a headache. "You mean to ask to go with me?"
Alden looked at the files and understood. "Master Harry wants you to accept it,"
Annoying, right? That was the day Draco's abilities triggered at the age of five.
"Sit next to me," Ares said coldly.
Klaus, Draco's wolf side, spoke in his head.
"Ares! Marrying a human, really? How long are you going to keep against your father, huh?" A female voice was heard. Then Draco saw an auburn-haired Goddess with a perfect physique. She looks both motherly and resolute.
"Am I your wife?"
"You have to eat your food, Draco. Otherwise, you will get sick again and endanger yourself.”
He quickly grabbed the glass, drank it immediately because he was so thirsty. The cold flow of water felt so fresh while wetting his throat. Unconsciously the glass of the drink was already in the toilet. Draco placed the glass slowly in the sink, feeling a little guilty. But anyway, he did not regret it. He feels better. Now he can think of a way to escape from this house.
Blaise once again frowned. "They?"
"What happened to you?" Draco asked softly and moved his hand to wipe away the traces of tears on Arabelle's adorable face.
His heart skipped a beat as he imagined himself wrapping his arms around the body from behind and resting his head on the man's strong back.
Harry’s only worried about Arabelle. Draco has nothing to fear.
"Don't you think so? I've often caught Potter staring at you silently, Pans. He's also been looking for trouble with you a lot, which is really just for attention." Draco explained, which Pansy and Blaise didn't understand at all.
Everyone is always afraid of Harry. The man was as handsome as an angel, but his heart was as black as a devil, that's what people said. Everyone adored him and kept their distance out of fear. What they don't know is that sometimes, his master can be like an angel completely, both in appearance and in his heart.
Draco stared in confusion. Then he just realized that there were a pair of wings adorning the man's back. Draco's eyes seemed to be tested whether it was real or not. They resembled the ones Draco saw when he touched Harry. The difference is, the wings really were stuck in his back.
Alden immediately shook his head at Draco's question. "No. There is no command from master Harry. Even master Harry seems to keep all this from you," Alden smiled. "I'm just thinking of the ways. Given his temper, he won't explain anything to you. Maybe he will kidnap you again and force his marriage with you. I am only preparing you if that really happens.”
Come and talk to me on
After several hours of awkwardness, Draco finally reunited with Alastair and the other envoys. Draco, Ares, and their horse entered the palace of the war god, which was not what Draco had imagined before. The messengers greeted Ares in a half-bowed gesture. Their heads bowed in regret. Ares helped the prince get off his horse then saw them.
Annoyed, Draco walked back to the kitchen and grabbed a rag to clean up the spilled cereal. Harry just stood in the tv room while watching Draco silently. He didn't follow Draco, but Draco felt like he was always being watched.
With his slightly disheveled black hair, deep but sharp light emerald eyes, thin, manly curved lips, and high cheekbones that angled his face in such a way, was matched by the jet black suit that wrapped his muscular body snugly, making him look like a handsome angel with a dazzling evil character.
"Sorry? Did I—"
"Is everything all right, master?" Alden appeared. He was indeed on guard duty and was worried to see Harry just leaning against the wall.
The current king of Sparta was a worshiper of Deimos, one of the sons of the God of War. He was a god of fear who was believed to give strength to soldiers who believe they can transform into monsters on the battlefield. But his high respect for the God of War and his children could not reduce the king’s intention to keep Troya in his palace.
horse could not match him. By morning, Ares had arrived at the foot of Mount Olympus. Here human settlements were rare because humans who stop too deep into Olympus will not return alive. But not only humans were wary when entering Olympus. Even he had to be careful because he could cross paths with the Olympus guardian monster, who was sometimes not very good at choosing his victims.
Draco begins to remember the moment he touched Harry for the first time. He saw a wing on his back and at the same time a horn on his head. "Is he half-demon and half-angel?" He asked Luna.
Draco shook his head, firmly in thought. Was that thing targeting a Demigod? Or the devil that Harry said — Abaddon — really likes to kill humans, and it just happens that Draco was there?
"I'm human," Draco replied, trying not to tell the truth.
"I haven't told you. There are a lot of bushes here. We have to be careful," Cedric helped Draco to get back on his feet properly.
Feel free to leave feedback/comments, guys. I will appreciate it a lot! ❤
Along the way, there was not a single conversation surrounding Harry and Draco. Draco kept his mouth shut as the man riding the horse chose to enter the Delion Kingdom palace through the castle's back door.
"You defended him over your own husband?!"
Cedric took a shaky breath when he saw the other youths who broke the household were walking towards them so cheerfully. The girl even spoke without the slightest bit of shame or hesitation.
The man with white long hair looked at Draco's arrival with his usual bored stare as if the older man wasn't looking forward to Draco's arrival. Only God knows if that man always sent letters to Draco asking Draco to visit him.
He didn't want to go down in history as a queen who betrayed the King and fell in love with the King's own sibling. He didn't want to create a scandal that might destroy the image he had worked so hard for.
Harry took Draco's hand formally as he entered the restaurant. The head of the restaurant herself greeted them and led them both to the table that had been prepared. Harry looks familiar with the restaurant's head chef, and Draco sees the head of the restaurant, a French woman with a thick French accent. Now and then, Harry spoke fluent French and smiled in response to the head chef.
She bit her lower lip and looked at him carefully. After saying this question, surely Arabelle would be marked disrespectful by Draco.
Alden nodded. "Yes, master. Everything is working smoothly. It's been confirmed that there are no eyewitness accounts of Tom Riddle's loss and no media reports about it."
"The taste of the wine is amazing. I didn't know the Delion Kingdom had such a precious treasure," said Harry to the King of the Delion as the man sitting right beside him.
"Prince of Sparta, you are the prize I won. Give birth to my child, stay beautiful to me, then I will guarantee comfort for the rest of your mortal life," Ares said.
Draco gave a slight grimace as he could feel his legs being dipped into a frozen river. Cold. But even so, Draco kept his feet there, trying to adjust himself to the extreme temperature of the water.
"Where are your wings?" asked Draco, a little confused.
Harry just mumbled incoherently, his eyes still glaring at the gentlemen who were still blatantly staring at Draco with a gaze full of desire.
"Why do you ask that?" asked Harry curiously when he saw curious twinkles covering Arabelle's two black eyes.
"I don't mind," Harry replied, tightening his grip even more. "This way, people will know that only I can win the heart of Draco Malfoy. Only me," said Harry with a smile.
Harry's eyes were still black, and his dark aura was so strong that it made Draco's hair bristles. Without thinking about anything, Draco kissed Harry right on the lips. He did this to let Harry know that there weren't any feelings even when Draco kissed him.
"You must know that I like my stepmother, right?"
"Can I sit here?" Cedric asked, pointing to the spot next to Draco.
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
Vlad helped Draco to sit up, but because his head was still dizzy, Draco accidentally leaned on Vlad's shoulder. He could feel Vlad's arms reaching his body. Comfortable, Draco likes this convenience. The comfort he never expected from someone like Vlad.
"Ughhh!" Draco groaned in annoyance.
Draco's strolling around and looking for a shelf with a spiritual theme. He has read several books where the main character also hunts down demons, but the main character was a descendant of angels or rather called Nephilim. Did the Nephilim really exist? And Draco is a Demigod. Perhaps others will also wonder whether Demigods really exist? All of that became a question that he wasn't sure how to answer.
Harry Potter must be exterminated; a man like that must not live in this world. And tonight was probably the last night the man will live.
Suddenly, without a sign as if using magic, Alden appeared in front of Harry. "Yes, master."
"Would you like to say something, king of Sparta?"
"Yes? Do you need something?" Draco asked, furrowing his brows when he saw the anxiety clearly showing on the girl’s face.
Draco slumped against the shower. He has reached the point where his body could not take it anymore, completely out cold from his orgasm. Harry admired his work before slowly pulling out to clean himself and his lover.
The King of Delion could only sigh tiredly, but a smile was evident on his old face. He liked the spoiled behavior Natalie had on him. The spoiled behavior made him feel like he was back in his youth.
"Please take care of him," Draco said as he gave the helpless little bird at Harry.
"You thought you just came back from another world?" sneered the man, and he rushed across the street when the light turned green.
Damn it! Harry clenched his jaw as he felt uneasy even though he had poured all his desire into his mistress's body. He rose from his position and grabbed the satin robe not far from the bed with a grunt.
"I can use it if I want," replied Icarus. His hands were behind his back, and then he walked down the stairs to where Draco was standing.
"Good night, Your Majesty." Cedric bowed before the prince actually stepped his foot to leave.
"One or two marriages in my eternal life sounds natural,"
"Who is Louis, my prince?" The young woman tilted her head in confusion.
"Do you want to join me to eat?" he asked the vampire girls who were still staring at his lunch.
What if Draco tells the truth? Could it be that Doctor Jason fell in sympathy and helped him? Or maybe Doctor Jason reported it to Harry instead, considering that this hospital was Harry's.
Draco turned his head, looking for the source of the unfamiliar voice that had answered Alastair's words. A young man who looked the same age as Ares walked up to Alastair with a leather bag hanging from his waist. He had blonde hair and carried a bow and arrow. His appearance was exquisite, in contrast to most of the men in Ares Palace, who were dominated by muscle and battle.
Luckily they weren't in the palace corridor at the moment. Otherwise, Glenice might have managed to create quite a stir.
Draco finally took his eyes off the Gryffindor table and glared back at Pansy with annoyance. He felt like throwing the rest of the soup at Pansy's smirking face.
Harry's emerald eyes gave off an aura of overwhelming possessiveness as if he wanted to tell anyone that Draco was his.
"Are you ready, Prince Troya?"
Draco remained calm. He wasn't surprised at all by the high-pitched words that just came out of his husband's mouth. Draco once read a novel, the novel said that a man would feel his heart squeezed when he saw his loved one suffer, and now, Draco understood Harry's words earlier.
Draco breathed in relief. “Yes, I feel a little nauseous and dizzy. But don't worry, I'm fine." Draco smiled.
Draco snorted at the childish threat, and rolled his eyes. "We are both males. So don't dream! ”
Bullshit. Draco knew she was the girl who had rejected Harry in the past. When Harry was already Draco's, the girl came back to get Harry back, whatever the purpose.
"We are meant to be together, Aphrodite. No matter how many times they try to take you away from me, I'll always get you back," the man whispered.
Draco buried his face in Harry's shoulders even more — realizing that Greyson could see his naked body, which was now sitting on Harry's lap. The heat immediately creeping up both sides of his cheeks, realizing that Greyson saw himself in the vulnerable state he was today.
A moment later, breaking Harry's reverie, the blond stood up. "I have to go," he said. He brought the piece of paper to his face, pressed his lips to it, making Harry's body heat up with every movement he made.
"Do you know his name?"
"Besides, Ares always comes back to Aphrodite," Lasonas whispered softly.
"I haven't touched him," Ares responded dryly.
Glenice's scream made Draco reflexively follow what Glenice was staring at. Draco's mouth opened slightly wide when he saw Natalie making out with her stepson.
"Bet?" Draco asked, confused.
It was his promise when he asked Draco to come back for the second time.
In the darkness, the figure was watching. The car's brake cable had been successfully cut. All of that is indeed difficult to do, considering that Harry's bodyguards are always on standby. But don't call him Hyde if it all goes wrong, he fairly popular underworld pseudonym as the most skilled assassin.
"It turns out you're a little ambitious, Troya. You have a war god as your husband and want to announce it all over Olympus,s right? Basically, you want to have a wedding?" The god guessed.
Draco, riding his horse leisurely with Attica, frowned slightly when he heard the envoy speak. Were they really not human? He still had a hard time believing it.
"For example... me. I want to be your love affair."
For the second time in one day, Draco felt his body not respond at all. His chest rose and fell, the air in his lungs forced out without him being able to breathe. Draco's head grew dizzy, and finally, his eyes closed.
The Titans were an advanced civilized race. They have technology that surpasses the humans of the earth today but is only used by their race. Zeus made sure all their secrets and technology don't fall into human hands. If there are Titans who betray, they will be given a severe punishment like Prometheus.
For a few seconds, Harry didn't budge. The man seemed not to believe what he had just seen and heard. Why did the man just know that Draco had this adorable side?
"What's wrong with seducing my lover?" Cedric asked with a slight chuckle that made Draco sneer at the prince.
"You won't! You're mine! You've been mine since the first time you set foot here." Vlad clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. "Listen. I won't let you go even if I have to break your legs. I don't care!"
"What's the purpose?" The King asked. The latest theory was quite disturbing his reasoning.
"How about I say I won the bet?"
The mysterious man kissed his nape. Draco couldn't avoid the man's touch. He stood too close and locked him in front of the door! Draco could even feel his back against his hard chest.
Harry turned his head. "What?!" He snapped.
Of course, Draco didn't believe the man's words. He had lived in the royal palace full of guile for five years, and he could see firsthand how the royal servants manipulated each other to get the throne and treasure for themself.
The Titans and Alastair promised to be his friends on Olympus and guide him in many ways. Unlike the other youths who had been with Ares—Draco would mingle with the rest of his palace. At least Draco could see that as the God of War, Ares wasn't cruel to his followers.
"Looks like you have a lot of questions, but don't worry, we have a long time to answer them because Olympus is still far from here," Alastair responded with a cheerful smile. Draco smiled back awkwardly. He had just cut off someone's arm, but right now, he was acting casually like he was just slashing at a tree branch.
"Your father seemed to have been very desperate before asking master Harry for help. Hope you understand,” Alden sighed. "You are the only treasure he has that he can offer to master Harry, considering that master Harry's reputation as a
. Draco's eyes met the dark brown eyes of Harry's mistress. Suddenly, she was startled because her hiding place was already known to others.
"Are you trying to win Zeus' heart and trying to get him to like you? You know they always urge you to marry and leave Aphrodite," Athena guessed.
"I didn't do anything. You tried to injure yourself by climbing the gate, do you remember?" Harry took out a box of his egg supply.
With a frown polishing his forehead, Draco decided to examine the horse's body covered in pure white fur. Everything was fine until his eyes caught a black animal that seemed to be having its time enjoying the blood of the poor horse.
Draco cursed himself silently.
Draco frowned. "Envy me? Why?"
"You can leave," Lucius said casually as he turned around and walked over to his chair.
He looked at Draco coldly and hissed softly. "Just close that window at night!" And full of pride, Harry stepped out of Draco's room, leaving the door thudding behind him.
There was a moment of silence, then Harry sighed. "Get some rest. If you need anything, you just need to press the button near the bed." And then Harry went off to close the door quietly from the outside.
Draco shook his head. The blonde pulled his face from Cedric's caresses. His hand was also removed from Cedric's grip. "This is wrong, Prince Cedric."
After making dinner, Draco decided to take a short walk in the common room, which was still covered in rags and mounds of dust. He browsed through the bookshelves and windows, then stopped in front of the fireplace. A large cloth stuck to the wall caught Draco's attention. He tried to tiptoe to remove the cloth, but his tiny body had a hard time reaching out.
to his lover.
"Prince Cedric, you shouldn't have to shout like that. I'll still hear you," said Draco when he saw his friend and brother-in-law walking towards him with a large sword in his hand.
He would never let fear and confusion blind him. After all, Draco was a queen. He had unlimited power in this kingdom.
"Is it dead?" asked Cedric.
Blaise frowned. "Confused?"
"No, I promise not to tell anyone about this. It's fun trying new things anyway. We're immortals, Aphrodite. It's natural to feel bored. After all, we've been doing it for thousands of years until there's no jealousy between us anymore. Why are you bothered now?"
Harry nodded in understanding.
"Were they killed?" Draco asked in horror.
Draco rubbed his nape nervously. "Yes, I'm staying here for a while."
Cedric seemed to be still surprised by the slap given by Draco. He could only stare at him without being able to process the order of words Draco had directed at him. Slowly but surely, Cedric withdrew his hands that had been gripping Draco's arms.
He must meet a mysterious Oracle named Cyllenius, who was strongly suspected of having planned this all on Troya. From there, Draco would force him to explain how to get his soul back to his old perfect life.
Instead of being angry, Ares was disappointed in himself. The young man, being obedient and sweet from the first time they met. Ares thought he could understand him. He thought he had read his attitude and knew how to control his heart.
Draco stepped past the hallway again. There was no other way in the hall, leading straight to the large spiral staircase and the front door. Careful, he peeked from the bottom of the stairs to the first floor. Empty. Where were the guards Draco saw yesterday?
If only normal humans were chasing him, maybe Draco would take them on. But a werewolf whose strength was ten times greater than him? No, thank you. Draco better runs and hide.
Actually, the book was a novel. Not an adult novel! The book was a beautiful romance novel. Draco doesn't know when he was interested in reading romance novels, which gradually brainwashed him, maybe, since Glenice introduced adult novels that contained romantic stories.
"W-Wait a minute!" Ron stopped Harry. "I... actually have one more place we can go."
Blaise quickly put his arm around Pansy. "Don't say silly things, Dray." he gave a sharp look.
He was trying to remember something in his past that could help him deal with this situation. Draco often competes in acting with famous Hollywood actors and models. Some of them even openly asked him out. However, most Draco decided to end it after a few dinners together because he was too busy with his career.
"Your Majesty! Is it time for you to challenge the gods? This is Ares we're talking about!" The Queen said in a panic.
The place where they keep the dead and the cursed dark souls.
It turned out that not even Harry's fiery desire was directed at him. Draco was just a substitute for the woman Harry really wanted. Of course. How could Harry Potter suddenly be attracted to him as a man? Draco smiled bitterly, holding back the pain in his chest.
Draco nodded in agreement. "Like you and I, who were drawn by these flowers to approach them."
Draco finally said, "I already know the whole truth, Potter. I'm guilty of trying to harm you. But that doesn't matter anymore. You are indeed guilty of my parents' deaths, and I have every right to hate and hold grudges against you. But you also saved my life, so I assume we're even. If you let me go, I promise I won't appear in your life again and will never try to harm you again," Draco looked at Harry earnestly. "That's the best offer I can make."
His husband gasped and stared at him with a faint frown on his forehead. Fortunately, it only happened for a fraction of a second so that none of the guests noticed the frown on their King's forehead.
"What are you doing here, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked as Cedric turned his athletic body so that they were facing each other.
After learning the painful truth, Draco decided to go home. He couldn't stay in that big room that made him felt breathless any longer. Draco didn't want Alden to pity him any further either. Now, Draco walked out blankly while holding his stomach. Even though his pregnancy was still too young, he was still afraid that it would affect the fetus if his condition were severe.
The arrival of the king and the words full of anger made all the guards surrounding Cedric slowly take steps to leave the house.
"Alden," Harry's cold voice from the door made them both turn. Alden's face went pale to find Harry standing there, leaning against the door with an unreadable face. "I didn't really want to bother you gossiping with Draco," Harry's eyes sharpened. "But I need you now. There is something we need to discuss.”
What happened next was completely unexpected for Draco. Harry sat down and kissed his lips, open mouth and all, simultaneously draining the water down his throat.
"Why are you standing on the balcony at night like this?" Harry frowned as the torrential rain began pouring down. Even the water splashed and started to wet Draco, who was standing while looking down at the yard.
"Why would you do it for me?"
Maybe he and Harry weren't meant to be together.
Harry returned Draco's gaze, no less piercing. "Because you are my lover, and Hyde is targeting us."
"Of course, Your Majesty," Cedric crooked a smile.
"Oh, that means you still have fifty years to live,"
Revised:
Draco looked at Harry suspiciously. "Can't I borrow these books and take them to my room?"
"Athena, we both know that Ares isn't that weak. He might be able to pass any test. This will just be a waste of time. Besides, I sense a personal motive from you. This isn't the first time you've tried to punish him," Zeus responded to Athena's suggestion. The Goddess of Wisdom turned gloomy at once.
Draco knew that was the time. That's where Harry loses his temper, which is why Draco jumps up and tries to escape to the door. He managed to open the door slightly, before, with a quicker and more silent movement, Harry was already behind him, pushing the door shut again before it could be opened.
He still remembered the plot of one of the vulgar novels that Glenice had just given him this morning. The book tells that if the main character was made a bet, the story continues until the main character was locked up in a palace and has to satisfy many mashers.
Draco ran as far as he could, ignoring the soles of his feet which were sore scratched by the sharp gravel. He had to act fast, he didn't have much time.
Draco just shook his head, unable to answer. The memory of the incident in the bathroom had mixed feelings. By the way, as promised, Harry was just taking a shower. After Draco finished soaping his back, Harry continued to bathe and then, with a presumptuous look, offered to wash Draco — which, of course, Draco refused him outright with a bunch of swearing that exploded from his lips.
"Okay. You will not be disappointed that you have hired me to kill Harry Potter." The telephone hung up, and Tom chuckled in the dark. Downing his drink, for the early celebrations.
"Yes, I've thought about it. I may have sent too many wedding gifts to the king of Sparta, so I can't waste my new wife," He shrugged. "Other than that?" Ares asked again.
"Now go back to your room and wait for me to come to you, Troya," Ares ordered as if to confirm who the boss was. Ares had taken off his mask and let Troya see his true nature. Ares had plenty of time to seduce him back. But for now, Troya had to know that he already belonged to the God of War and could never leave his dominion.
"Ah, it's not what you think, Your Majesty," Cedric chuckled when he saw Draco's frightened and confused face.
Draco turned his head and saw Harry walking into the room, wearing a black shirt and looking incredibly healthy, and it didn't seem like he'd been in an accident. Unconsciously Draco frowned, regretting worrying about Harry.
"Ungrateful son of—!" Harry snapped and pushed Draco again to the end. "Any last words?"
Without hesitation, Harry stepped closer to Draco. He chuckled in amazement as he saw Draco still emitting an aura of extraordinary elegance in his sleep, unlike Arabelle with her sloppily sleep.
"Well, it's finished. Try opening your eyes," exclaimed Daphne. There was a tone of satisfaction in her voice. Draco opened his eyes slowly. And he stared at the figure who stared back at him in front of the mirror.
"Good morning, sleeping beauty. Are you awake?" Harry asked casually as he's buttoning his shirt.
Harry chuckled. "Hmm, considering you've come back sassy to me, I'm sure you're cured." Harry ran his fingers on Draco's cheek. "Forgive me,"
Draco listened to all the debates with trepidation. He didn't know what to say but smiled nervously. Does he have the right to speak? Because Troya's parents seem to consider him a property, they can treat him as they please.
Harry was momentarily stunned. "Take my blood. I'm O too."
Draco stared at the glass bottle filled with the clear liquid with dull eyes. His lean fingers moved to shake the glass bottle gently.
"Then, from now on, I will act powerfully," Cedric took wide strides toward Draco.
"There's nothing wrong with falling in love."
The dashing-looking young man bowed slightly as a sign of respect as Draco and Natalie watched him come. That man was none other than the crown prince of the Delion Kingdom.
"No," Harry replied quickly, only a split second after Draco closed his mouth. "Stop, Draco. I won't let you go."
Luna smiled sweetly. Draco always knows how to make Luna smile, and Draco loves her smile. It makes Draco smiled too. Then his eyes turned to a man standing behind Luna. The hair on his neck immediately stood up. Harry's arrival took him by surprise. Not because he was afraid of the man, but because Draco was afraid that Harry would hear Luna's words.
Draco widened his doe eyes, angry at the other man. "On what basis have you decided where I should live? I want to go home!"
1. Seraphim are a higher class of angels but lower in status than archangels. Seraphim are angels that possess great strength and abilities.
"I didn't hear any news about him. He suddenly disappeared like he was swallowed up by the earth, even though some time ago I still met him to discuss some of our cooperation, and now he has disappeared so that our cooperation is canceled. Even the secretary didn't know where he was. The business media didn't give any comments either.”
Feel free to leave a comment/feedback If you guys have some. I'll appreciate it a lot. Thank you! ❤
Draco stretched out his hand politely, and Ron shook his hand, then glared at him. It made Draco feel his guts shrink a little under the sharp gaze of those sky blue eyes.
"Your Majesty?!" Arabelle suddenly gasped when she felt Draco's long finger touched her neck.
"There's no need," Greyson extended his hand to shake hands with Harry, to which the green-eyed man replied immediately. “Nice to do business with you, Potter.”
Alden nodded, and whether Draco was mistaken or not, it's just that for a second, he saw an amused glow in Alden's eyes. God damn it. Maybe they all laughed at his fear of Harry.
"How much drug did you give him?"
With doubt, Draco opened his eyes, and he gasped at the sight before him. Harry was holding the knife, bare-handed. The sharp part of the knife sliced open the palm of his hand, but the man gripped the knife expressionlessly, even though blood began to pour out of his hand, hitting Draco.
"Draco," Harry panicked. He supported Draco's body from falling, touched Draco's forehead, and felt how hot his forehead was. Draco has a fever. Harry immediately carried Draco in bridal style.
"What are you doing here, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked, furrowing his brows when he saw his brother-in-law's handsome face not far in front of him.
The man then shook his head. "No, you're not going anywhere until you love me."
"No, Troya. I've just been thinking about a lot of weird stuff these past few days. Sorry that I seem to have blown it to you," Ares smiled. He certainly wasn't willing to admit that it was his wife who made him like this.
Draco looked back at the driver. "Ah yes, sorry. I'm getting into character for a drama this weekend," he lied so the driver wouldn't think Draco was a lunatic for talking alone.
Pansy shrugged. "Maybe he's confused,"
Luna showed a surprised expression. "I forgot it's your birthday,"
"Good afternoon. Are you Mr. Draco? I'm Seamus, the lawyer who gets to sent here."
"Come on," Harry said as he reached out his hand to help Draco so he could quickly get on the horse. After making sure Draco was seated comfortably on the horse, Harry mounted the horse.
Alden moved, slightly uncomfortable. "Not yet. When he realized that he failed to kill you, he immediately ran away somewhere."
Zeus leaned back in thought. He might have to ask another god or some wise advisers around him, but Athena was one of the Goddesses he consulted the most. The goddess never let him down because she was intelligent and conscientious, but Zeus also knows her sense of justice was sometimes fused with her hatred for Ares.
Titans can't really blend in with humans. They were immortal beings who cannot age. They kept their secrets properly for thousands of years. Zeus also ordered to place all the artifacts and technology of the Titans on Olympus, which was guarded with layers of protection. He didn't allow the human race to know their secret.
Draco was embarrassed. How else? It was that feeling that now engulfed him. If Alden's words were true... and they seemed to be the truth... then Draco should be ashamed. All of his grudges all this time, his thoughts all this time, his anger all this time, and his hatred all this time were all built on entirely wrong perceptions. And Harry never even defended himself with all Draco's cursing and accusations.
The man was dangerous and can do anything. Draco didn't want anyone to take his freedom away. While being taken to Mount Olympus and being left alone there sounded scary, at least Draco had a chance to escape. He could secretly pay people to put horses at the foot of the mountain or hire someone to escort him from Olympus to Athens.
Flashes of memory flickered through his mind. He was still locked up here in the room at Harry's house. Draco sat up from the bed in a panic, and the blanket almost fell over his chest. Draco lowered his head and realized that he was completely naked under the blanket. What the...
Doctor Jason had already wounded Draco with two bloody cuts in Draco's arm, making Draco grimace in pain and distress in being tied to the chair and almost losing consciousness.
Draco gasped, enduring the pain and fear as the cold iron stuck to his neck. Its sharp coating had slashed through his neck, causing a slight sting there.
"Draco, Potter's lover."
"We?" Draco asked, increasingly confused.
"Oh, yes, she does know a lot about this place. But she doesn't—"
He felt confused. Why these past few days, people around him were asking about other men in Draco's life? Don't they know that Draco really loves his current position? He wasn't blind. He wouldn't let love overwhelm him till he left this position his family so coveted.
Draco forcefully hit their heads alternately with his bag. "You guys are trying to kill each other?! You are an idiot! Stupid creatures! Stop that!" he roared.
"That night, you drained a lot of blood, and Mr. Potter, who happened to be the same blood type as yours, forced us to draw his blood for you. Actually, we shouldn't do it, Mr. Potter also just survived the same accident, but he insisted and threatened. And it's true what they say, no one will dare to go against what Harry Potter says. After all, he is the owner of this hospital. His orders must be carried out."
Draco had to put a lot of effort into chewing the food. The meat was tough and spiced to the point, but the people around him seemed to enjoy eating it. Draco felt full quickly. The whole meal was utterly different from what he used to eat during his life as Draco Malfoy. Draco was a food expert. No matter how busy he was as an actor, he makes sure his tongue only tastes good quality food. The long-haired beauty often cooks by himself and makes cooking his hobby.
"Yes, Your Majesty!" The whole group answered the king's words at the same time firmly.
"Another man, huh?" Draco muttered with his eyes fixed on the towering trees not far from where he was sitting.
Somehow, Draco wasn't comfortable hearing that. "Sorry, I think you have harassed Attica," said the prince furiously.
"Be careful, Draco. I don't want to hurt you. I just want to take a shower."
Draco narrowed his eyes and saw Harry sitting over there, in the dim light of his room. "Why did you enter my room without permission!?" Draco screamed in surprise, his hands fumbling for the light switch on the wall, trying to shake off the darkness surrounding Harry because he looked even scarier in the dim light.
"Good," the man then placed his hands on the bottom of Draco's thighs, leading the blonde to start moving up and down his lap, his lips finding Draco's lips that began to let out a delicious moan. "Tell me you're mine," the man whispered, yet to stop his activities, making Draco move up and down on his lap.
He took a deep breath before the blonde decided to get up from his seat and stomped his long legs out of the room. Maybe, a short walk can calm Draco's mind a bit so he can sleep soundly tonight.
"But that doesn't mean this is your private place."
Alden seemed unfazed by Harry's words. “You ordered me to make that boy surrender. He really hates you and will surely resist like hell. Drugs are the only way to make him give up." Alden looked Harry in the eye. "You can leave this room if you don't want to take advantage of it."
His polite remark was only answered with a grunt from the aged man. Secretly, Draco took a shaky breath. Their relationship was getting more and more strained, even though they share the same blood.
For some time fixed to the window, Draco realized that there was something out of the usual. Several cars were seen passing in and out of Harry's house, which was usually deserted. Every day, Draco only took a sight of Harry's bodyguards and some servants passing by in the house's front yard.
The bodyguard groaned and cursed, while Harry just stared at the commotion in front of him, chuckling with amusement. Draco tried to struggle, bite, and kick until he was exhausted. He gave Harry a breathless look, full of hatred, still in the firm grip of Harry's bodyguard.
"Even if I intervene directly to find the candidate?"
"Oh no, for us Amazonians, if they go too far, we'll cut off some of their fingers," Attica smiled as he said it. Draco responded with an awkward laugh. It seemed he didn't need to teach an Amazonian woman to defend herself.
"Don't moan or make weird sounds like that in front of men!" Harry growled as he stepped away from Draco in annoyance.
"I heard your screams." He hissed in anger that he had been holding back for a long time. "And I won't apologize about that."
Draco wanted to argue but didn't want to spoil this beautiful atmosphere. Locked in for weeks in that damned room and now for some reason, Harry is kind enough to take him out — albeit with a tight guard — Draco briefly glanced at Harry's bodyguards who were standing as usual at the access exit.
"You should ask your mother, Goddess Hera. She's the Goddess of Marriage. I'm the most inappropriate person to ask about marriage." Aphrodite laughed.
After Cedric left, Draco looked straight at Arabelle with a gentle smile. Lightly, he took Arabelle's hand.
Did Troya know that man?
"Nothing. I'm not the type of guy who likes to take advantage of cornered people," Terence replied while shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly.
"Potter! Let go of me!" Draco hissed angrily. His head started to feel dizzy.
"Ahh..." Draco moaned again when the wave of joy came. Vlad didn't stop, he kept pumping himself inside Draco's body.
"Ares isn't interested in me anymore. I might have to get out of his palace. After that, I'll be caught by a Satyr and forced to become his wife. Maybe I should meet the Cyclops first and be his meal," Draco complained.
Sparta has often been dominated by men who were firm, disciplined, and tough. They were stiff and serious. Even the behavior spread to the men who were also members of the council. Sparta was different from Athens and Thebes, whose lives were still colored by music, artists, and poets. Such a thing was rare in Sparta. Troya became a kind of anomaly in the palace environment. The people liked him, and the King felt the atmosphere of Sparta was warmer since Troya's birth.
Hermione frowned, clearly taken aback by Draco's request, her eyes staring questioningly. "What's the matter, Draco? But... Aren't you..."
Draco grimaced when he realized that at every access to the exit, all of them stood two or three of Harry's bodyguards in the same black suits and who always seemed on guard. Draco had to get past them if he wanted to get out of this place.
"I don't know if you can be friends with her because—"
Draco was silent. He's been so naive. He doesn't live in the modern era. Here he must submit to his husband and obey all his wishes. Draco was reminded of the title of the War God that Ares carries. He was anxious to become the food of the monsters in the forest of Olympus.
"You're in a difficult position now, Ares. Athena is after you. She hopes you fall."
"You don't have to worry about Aphrodite. She doesn't even visit Ares palace often. It would be best if you thought more about the inhabitants. Like the Amazon warriors and me and their other knights," Attica whispered to him.
"Bullshit!" Harry's jaw tightened, “You have to report it to me! I am your master, not Draco! Hurry up and go back to work!" He commands.
That meant his chance to escape would...
"I just wanted to kiss you," Ares admitted, mumbling softly. "I'm your husband, and I think I have the right to touch you," He said again, a little more firmly.
"I can't race the horse any faster. Glenice won't be able to keep up with this horse's pace. If the place is still far away, we can go back to the resting place," Draco suggested while looking at Glenice, who still bowed her head respectfully.
"What do you mean?!" Harry’s voice suddenly rising as he could no longer contain the emotions that were already bubbling up inside him.
Wait... that figure... Draco?
Ah… Did Harry and Arabelle have fun before he came to Draco?
Draco woke up a second time in that strange place again. This time, however, he was calmer and felt much saner. A bitter taste in his mouth. It seemed that the old healer had fed him that disgusting potion when he was unconscious earlier. His body felt lighter. Draco got out of bed and was now in a better room. The bed was quite soft and had good ventilation, so he didn't feel hot or cold. Draco saw several beeswaxes burning to indicate that night had come.
"Ares, I didn't want to intrigue you," Draco objected.
"Who is prettier? Me or His Majesty?" Arabelle lifted her head so that her eyes could catch Harry's handsome face, which looked very soothing under the shade of the maple tree where the man was currently leaning his burly back.
So, all this time, he was only used as a substitute for Seraphina. For some reason, a faint feeling of sadness welled up in Draco's chest. It was so painful. Harry locked him and kept him here because his face resembled Seraphina's. Even Harry made love to him maybe while imagining Seraphina. It was his facial resemblance to Harry's late wife that saved him, perhaps. Otherwise, he would have been killed by Harry for trying to hurt the man.
If Draco were honest with himself, he'd have to admit that he'd needed something like this for a long time. Yes, he'd be paying for all of the abuse tomorrow, the teeth marks would sting, and the bruises would be sore, and he'd probably need to use a few anti-inflammatory patches. But none of that mattered. At the moment, Draco didn't have the energy to care.
"Vlad!" Draco shrieked as he felt the delicious sensation of Vlad's fangs bite into his neck. It hurt, but made him hot and even more aroused.
This morning Harry was usually off to work at this hour. Draco decided to pass his time by exploring the entire house. He decided to explore the right-wing area of the large house. A week had passed since a high fever had knocked him, leaving him helpless and unable to do anything.
Cedric kept his lips closed. He noticed Draco's sad face, which the blonde rarely showed to anyone, even his father. He never seemed to show it.
Draco was startled when his name was called loudly. His silver eyes that had been staring in awe at the swords belonging to the royal guards immediately moved quickly to find the source of the sound.
Draco was scared. Will he be forced again? The air started to feel suffocating, and Draco began to gasp.
"Whatever," said Cedric nonchalantly.
which didn't seem to be magic at all.
"You should definitely get out of here because you have only one choice, sleep on my bed."
"Your Majesty..." She called carefully while biting her lower lip.
Draco's starting to think. Because he still doesn't understand the phrase 'originally does not take sides'. "What does 'do not take sides' mean?"
That afternoon, the house was peaceful, and Draco walked through the house's first-floor area. The home is so spacious with hallways that are nowhere to go. It didn't seem like one day would be enough to explore the whole house. Draco stopped at an open door and took a little peek. He was fascinated to find the high shelves lining the walls, full of books!
"Your drink.
In a hurry, Cedric grabbed Draco's hand. He pulled the hand a little harshly, but Draco didn't make a protest. He knew a man like Cedric must have great energy. Maybe Cedric didn't mean to grab his hand so violently.
"Send me back," Draco said quietly. Harry just stared at him without moving. "I'll never love you, Potter. Get me home quickly," he added.
"I saw the wings of angels being cut off and falling on the ground. Thousands of human corpses were covered in blood, and demons were doing destruction." Draco tries not to tell the part where he saw himself being killed by Harry.
"Because," Harry growled slightly, and with a quick move, the man gripped Draco's jaw with his fingers, soft but threatening. “Because I love getting into you so much, you are different from the others, feel your hole envelop my cock in heat, then hear your moans until your orgasm. Clear?"
Revised:
"You're always a bother," said Harry. Though, he immediately added to his words as the other's expression turned sour. "Just kidding. What's wrong, Ron?"
Harry sat in the chair next to Ron and fastened his seat belt. "What place should we visit first?"
"How is that possible? The blood—a lot of—ugh—" Draco felt sick. It was really traumatic for him.
"Still," Draco still had doubts. "Why me? Just out of curiosity? Really? Then what if I disappoint you? If I'm not as beautiful as the rumors say, then what will happen to me?"
Draco grabbed a kitchen knife and opened the door carefully, letting the chain hold it in place. "Who?" He looked at the handsome man in the neat suit while frowning.
Draco was led into a room with wooden furniture and shades of brown and elegance on the second floor. Alden sat on the sofa in front of him and motioned for Draco to sit down.
Draco was dumbfounded. His twenty-third birthday was coming. Why did Harry know the details of his birthday? Draco was interested, but he will satisfy Harry if Draco follows him. Maybe that was Harry's goal, so Draco wouldn't get in the rain and follow him.
"It only exists in your dreams!" Draco half screamed, ran to the door, and slammed the door loudly, still hearing Harry's laughter as he left.
Sparta's palace was nothing like he had ever imagined. Not as simple as the image shown in the movie 300 or as grand as the medieval castles in the Game of Thrones series. Sparta was a respected kingdom in Greece and was known for the toughness of its warriors. Draco didn't know if the boys here were really trained in martial arts from an early age because he was still reluctant to ask too many questions.
The shrug irked because Draco didn’t want to believe those words - but he did, because they were so much like Harry Potter. He’d fought against a whole army seeking him out in the countryside and still he’d won - but the shrug was so… not bothered and Draco wasn’t sure he’d be able to walk into a place with crups for sale and be told no again. Hearing this, hoping for something else was just a sure way to crush the dream.
It wasn’t unfair of him to ask was it? Was it? As Luna turned to go, he panicked.
What part of ‘never bring this up’, ‘ever’ did he not understand? Did he not--oh. Draco stared into his champagne, nearing empty. He had mentioned spells, he should have ignored it. Was this a dig, was this a proposition because Draco hadn’t ignored it?
“We should talk, probably, then.” Charlie scuffed at his feet and offered his hand to Siobhan, “I’m Charlie, we should hurry. We don’t want this little bugger being too hungry.”
Seamus complained about Dean – and Luna complained about some form of elusive Pixie – and Draco hadn’t a clue what that was either. The goal for tonight? Forget his name, wake with the worse hangover in the history of Britain and ignore Harry bloody Potter forevermore.
Leaving had Scorpius come after him, grumbling how Draco needed to tell him what was going on more – and more about how he was feeling and Draco nearly laughed. Not happening.
Draco flew away, notepad and all and the entire Auror Department allowed him to leave. He hid away, not sure if he should tear and rip the notes apart or keep them and see just what Rita was trying to accomplish.
“Harry, tell me. Did you think going AWOL helps any of us? Were you just waiting for this one to land on my lap without a warning?”
“Woah, woah. Look. Harry said it was unfair you were asking him to change.” Neville huffed out a noise that certainly sounded like a scoff. “I told him you were trying. That you weren’t the same brat from school.”
“I like how it feels.” Harry smothered himself into the covers and mumbled. Really, Harry was—“You’re such a prude out of the moment.” He dragged his fingers over the lines and wondered how long they’d stay.
Yelling out, Draco shoved away the weighty darkness. Blaise’s voice still whispering in his head. Sticky, insidious, the pressure only increased no matter how much Draco pulled away.
Should Draco bother to admit he had no need any more to go visit the Muggles? Learning their ways of food preparation and cooking served him no more. Harry wouldn’t have any reason to eat anything he prepared. Should he admit his new-founded comfort around Muggles was purely for Potter’s benefit? No. His ego couldn’t take this. No. No. No. Potter did not dictate what he did or did not do in his life. The arse was out of his life, he'd made that quite clear by leaving without a word.
So, Draco did, sidestepping in between the coffee table and the armchair set and Harry curled onto his side. He could hear his breathing and Draco calmed down from the panic someone might have seen and took advantage. Over him or over Potter, it didn’t matter much.
Draco assumed that trait to lead was why the Aurors hadn’t shunned him completely, no leaks making their way to the papers. Because Potter did always seem to inspire loyalty (a bizarre trait to be sure because there was no real test, no real way to know who would crack under the pressure). And then, especially Harry had to consider Draco would trust his judgement (there was a reason why he allowed the Albus-Scorpius separation fiasco as much as he’d pleaded for Harry to reconsider) and not go against it in the end. Draco did admittedly trust Potter more than anyone else, really.
The difference between them was Potter should have had someone here. Ginny or Ron, Hermione or Longbottom, Luna or -- someone. Draco drank and was awoken by the house elves and a hangover that didn’t remove any of the loss and the thought he had to raise Scorpius on his own. Scorpius as a child had too many habits that to Draco were Astoria’s. He didn’t like looking at his son’s face. So, Draco drank because that was a shitty thing to think, to even feel because the kid just lost his mother and the world responded with indifference and more questions on if Astoria had shagged Voldemort.
Thank you for your patience and for reading.
Harry finally peered up, his face wet and blotchy from tears. It was odd seeing Harry Potter cry. Draco always assumed he was a little too well put together, a little too lucky for crying. He thought maybe, if he ever found Harry like this, he’d gloat. “What is it? I’ll try anything,” Harry sniffed and as if he’d gained his own mind back, he relaxed his hold on Draco’s wrists.
“It’s impossible for a human’s magic to grow an All-Mother tree.”
“To your father, you mean. What’d you think happens if your father’s dead too?”
When Draco kissed him, chaste – though Harry tried to change that – Draco let go, used his hand to keep Harry’s head still with his chin. And kissed at the side of his mouth and across his jaw and on his check and over his temple. And then that ridiculous scar, each side of it and Draco spied Harry wasn’t entirely out of the way and his skin was damp from the shower.
Draco didn’t know how many incidents in his life were more embarrassing than sitting in the shower, barely covering his modesty with a towel, – an old High Society phrase if Draco had ever heard one – and having both a Healer prod at his side and having Harry anxiously wait just at the door.
“Oh no, he’s been very gentle. Isn’t even gripping onto me all that much. My mum had one of these, nice to look at yeah? Nasty temper and one hella bite.”
“I’ve only used your name one other time and you know about that bloody woman who wasn’t going to give me a Chasing Tree seed. I don’t want to use your name.”
“Well, I got some fast food.”
“How do we know he isn’t just saying that-- My mum said--”
Thankfully Matthews didn’t regard this as common, or restitution for Draco’s past. No, he jotted some notes and sat back in his own chair. And asked Draco to explain and Draco was relieved.
Luna might like him to care for his words regardless of person. But he wouldn’t deal with the old Slytherin’s with anything but a sharp tongue and faster wit. Draco left, laughing at Pansy's upturned lip.
His arrival wasn’t greeted with hurtling hexes or traps being set off.
“Have you ever shagged Pansy? Or are you shagging both of them?” In the distance, peacocks yelled and the wind chilled him as Blaise stared off into space.
“Any potions or salves?”
Another wobbling start and Harry moved to the mess. He was on his knees, pulling with shaky hands. Picking at the metal fused into the carpet. The rush up the stairs, to have Draco hold onto him in a grip so tight probably hadn’t left him much energy for magic casting.
“He just needs to write the bloody thing,” Blaise snapped and Theodore snarled, tossed the Intent to Marry the Greengrasses off the table, disintegrated it in a show of defiance and Draco couldn’t say he wasn’t grateful. But in the end, Draco could feel it, see it in the ring as it darkened more and more. Blaise was losing it and so was he.
Draco was in two minds, know every detail or know nothing and push to forget all about it. The only one in danger now was Theo and Blaise if they ever dared show their faces. Revenge wasn’t an option. He never wanted to see the two of them ever again.
But Scorpius? His son hadn’t hurt anyone.
“I can’t be near people. I just keep thinking, how easy it would be to kill you. To cast another
Right. Different houses. They lived in different houses. That was insensitive more so than the ring comment. “Sorry,” Draco said and left it to hang in the air without anything further to add.
Scorpius blinked away, whatever emotions he wrestled with, before he asked, “This doesn’t end happily does it?”
“I…” Did he? Didn’t he?
Blaise scuttled away, a little too obedient and quiet from what Draco was used to. He hissed towards Theo who was making it obvious he didn’t want to engage. “You have to get the ring off him.” Nothing. “If not for my sake for his.”
“I guess it doesn’t like me much.” Harry tried to smile but failed. It looked as if it hurt.
A finger was violently pointed at his face. “You’ll take that back or you’ll have no more supplies from me.” Draco could tell a lost cause. He sighed at the madness of this conversation never mind its contents. One last vestige of leverage.
Playing peacemaker didn’t feel right. It went against everything Draco was brought up and taught. People played peacemaker to him, not the other way around. But he didn’t want to stay here, alone, thoughts of a murderer on his mind for the rest of the night. He’d win one over Harry later.
“I’ll go tonight. You go be a good friend. Does that sound like something you can do?”
“The healer’s didn’t say anything?” Draco drew back then, why did Potter know more than he did - about his own condition? Why hadn’t they just-- How could a healer just--
“Access?” Draco repeated and Neville paled in the cold, only his nose reddening. And like a clock striking the hour, a question leapt into his head Draco had never considered. Access. Siobhan’s access. Not over the Artefacts or over Potter, no her access in being in the Manor whenever Harry and Draco had left. She’d had her rest after taking care of Potter through a rough night or she’d make some more potions or she’d jot down every little job she did so Draco paid her just right for her services. But she was in the Manor whenever Draco left for a quick jaunt outside, a meeting elsewhere.
A replay of Scorpius arriving in the Floo, alone, flashed across his mind and was gone before Draco could grab the small details of the scene. Someone had arrived after but the Manor, unprovoked by a Malfoy guest meant it hadn’t needed to remember anything else about the guest - only that they were there by Scorpius’ express permission. Albus was on the wards, allowing him to apparate inside if he so wished. So, it couldn’t be Albus because why use the Floo? Or had they both used the Floo just in case Draco was in?
Draco shook his head at the sight. What limitations did magic have if Potter’s Will was this - two grown trees worth. Now, Draco wondered if there was even a point to feeling competitive for any reason, it was clear as the trees he would never win. Not that Harry would ever win in the more refined parts of life or know what a hairbrush was. Draco would take his wins where he could have them.
“No one could act so convincingly like you Mother.” The parchment was span around and Draco hesitated to sign with a final glance to the two of them – and he did trust them both quite implicitly – he signed his name. His mother didn’t waste time leaving after and Harry might as well have started jumping up and down on the spot for how much energy he couldn’t shake.
“Draco Malfoy! What can I get you?” Agnar was an old, white-haired, with long bony fingers even by goblin standards.
Draco had to say, him saying no made Harry seem even eager now to drag him to a Muggle Zoo.
Divorce was never an option for Draco, for Astoria. For Pansy or Nott. It rose a flag, high, to everyone else that not only did their very spouse find them unworthy but also unlovable enough to leave. Harry could leave Ginny but Draco wasn’t naive enough to think the papers and the people who read those papers wouldn’t take a side. Harry stared at his wedding ring for so long Draco considered the topic closed and out of bounds for the future.
“You really,” Harry sighed and it weighed Draco down by his feet. “I really didn’t say any of that. I’ll leave it up to you.” Harry’s smile might not be as broad but it was there, still, taunting Draco all over again. “Does this mean you’re actually, really, thinking about it?”
Later on, he took Harry up on his own issued ultimatum.
“You’re here without anyone shadowing you? That has to be a record.” He managed to stare at Harry’s hair, one wayward strand waving at him.
“Who started it?” Draco wasn’t sure Scorpius and Albus had ever escalated fights to this point. They weren’t under his supervision all the time but leaving the two alone even as children garnered no arguments, petty or otherwise. They were delightful to look after since neither were the type to dare the other to jump out a window and spell themselves to safety (something Goyle and Crabbe did frequently at Draco's behest).
“Best let him calm down a little first,” she whispered and kept her head down. That was precisely what Draco would not do. He launched himself away from the desk, shrieking and cursing the tiny door handle for its lack of perching capacity.
(See the end of the chapter for
Going over to visit Ginny was both on Draco’s agenda and also put off for as long as possible. They didn’t talk, they didn’t natter or have small talk even these days. He spoke well enough – pleasantly as much as a Malfoy and a Weasley could – with
(People aren’t vases, Draco. Matthews said once, when Draco had said the War broke him. He’d found the interruption maddening and insolent. Clay, he added, people were more like clay – easy to shape and steal from, but never enough to ever take away what could be – Draco had lorded the idea as hypocrisy. If he were clay he’d easily paint over his Mark and be done with it. Matthews said painting doesn’t go on softened clay, it goes on vases and Draco had found the entire discussion far too pompous even for him).
benefit.”
“I do.”
Read. Tap. Read. Tap. Read. Every now and again, glancing up to see where Harry was and then down again to read more. Every now and then he was certain he was slowing down and sped up intermittently. Then it was back to the phone. How could Muggles put a library into such a small, tiny device and be amazed at a simple levitation spell? He wouldn’t say it was amazing. Never. Not even Potter could rip those words from his throat. Every now and then Harry would try and steer him a certain direction and Draco followed.
“I’m the worst father in the world!” Draco wasn’t sure if the noise he made was worse or if it was the distressed crying of his son, who lay in his crib and seemed to want the very walls to come down. His face a tear-stained red and his scream made Draco want to curl into himself and proclaim he hadn’t a clue what he was doing - he shouldn’t be allowed to be near Scorpius after this.
“Do you think I’m so easy to fool, Potter? Get back here.” The branches did not fade out of existence as they should. They appeared burnt and gnarled despite the rest of the tree unblemished. “You stopped it. You stopped it growing.” Harry didn’t say a thing. “Why?”
If this was Rita, he wasn’t going to say he wouldn’t just use his owl legs to stomp the living crap out of her. What was she doing here? What was she thinking of writing? Was it anything about Harry? Had it finally leaked? At the worst time possible (not only on the vote but him staying at Malfoy Manor might be revealed in the aftermath).
The hippogriff pranced about, rearing up, lowering its head keen on Potter’s attention. This wasn’t happening. Harry grinning and cooing all over it.
“Is there really nothing I can do to help? I could stay here. While you write.” Harry sat down facing away from the table itself, the backless chair was transformed from a bench many generations ago, it wasn’t comfy by any stretch.
Either way, it was safe to surmise that Giannini Quartz probably knew about Draco’s animagus form well before he’d sent his son and his cronies into the Manor. A spell that made him unable to eat and begin once Draco tried to return wasn’t the greatest worry. The Rings of Celius were still in the house. Fake ones might sit in plain sight, beckoning the idiots to steal those two. Once they found out the fakes did nothing, then they’d return for the rings and -- if Draco wasn’t back in human form, Scorpius. That could not happen.
He buried himself into the ever sturdy Harry, grateful he didn’t ever falter when it came to people. Harry hugged him as tightly as he could. The words he said weren’t important. What Draco listened to was the lull in words as Harry breathed and Draco tried to slow his own down. If left on his own, Draco was sure he’d smell that decay again, the rust on iron and have no way to stop his legs from giving out. He hated this house.
“He wasn’t cared for…?” Draco didn’t know how to word it. Would it have been unfair to say abused? All because Draco didn’t think it sounded right, but then again he hadn’t thought a lot of things sounded right when it came to Harry’s upbringing even at Hogwarts. “Neglected.” Draco decided on. Finally, Ron turned to look at him.
“Yes, yes. I need the list.” He produced it from his breast pocket, ignored the grunt and complaining nature of Wrek as Draco watched him work slowly. A not so much older man with a gut but Draco had seen the man move faster. “Sometime today, preferably.” The shop stunk of rotting wood and damp and while Draco was aware of why - most alchemy or potion ingredients were grown by those who sold them. Wrek was a terrible one for appearances but the botany skills was enough for Draco to return when he needed a discreet purchase.
Oh. It was said in defence of him, was it? Did that make it better he spilled his secrets? Should Draco thank him? Neville rubbed his hexed jaw, tender fingers prodding.“Okay, so you are still a bit like the brat from school. I don't know what's going on with you. This's a bit of an overreaction.”
Spoiling and soothing tempted him, to calm Potter’s distress and mutter everything would be fine. “Harry.” Let himself stay still as Harry tried to speak again, to dismiss it all again. It was be easy, to cuddle in close and do nothing more than ignore it. Let Harry go on and pretend he couldn’t tell anyone, ever. To breathe in and hug into him and let this go, push it aside and that be it.
“’ione just left. You could probably still catch her.”
No, no, no, he didn’t want to do this. He wanted to cry out because was this life now? To try and hurt the people he cared for? Hearing Scorpius and Albus duel Blaise was one nervous breakdown after the other whenever he didn’t hear Scorpius’ voice. Please be okay. Please be okay. Don’t die.
Draco may have tried to up his pace.
Occasionally a nail digging into the underside of his thigh had him curling his toes and Draco could handle that along with the smooth heat of Harry’s mouth or the lavish attention of his tongue. The only pattern was the more he said Harry’s name (and this wasn’t, couldn’t be his voice), the more teasing and slower Harry became. Torture, sweet almost there but - not enough, torture.
“How do I know you’re not just doing what my father did.”
And Draco didn’t know what to say or do. Wasn’t she scared of him? Was this a Gryffindor move? Draco made a point to look away, not to interfere. Was this for the adoring public? Was this all an act? If so, this was the more uncomfortable experience out of the two. Harry and Ginny had spent a day together, when looking to buy for the party. They talked, then. Really talked. Draco shifted in his seat. (They were married). So it stands to reason they would sit (a little close) next to each other. The public eye wouldn’t allow Harry to flirt with anyone else.
“You’re a good person, I think--” Draco turned to watch Luna as she turned a strange but fake looking Artefact in her hands from the stalls outside an overflowing shop of junk, “--when you aren’t being a prideful git.” Draco laughed, nerves all of a sudden bundling up and reminding him he didn’t deal well with most people. Even now, his reputation was built on work he could do, followed with what people perceived as Malfoy arrogance.
Clearing his throat, Draco started to build up those walls again. “Go meet and greet, Potter. Party’s still on.” Draco ran his hand through his hair, wanting to ignore how his lips felt were entirely too tingly to chat with old geezers that were stuck in their ways about policy. Harry left first as he didn’t need to worry about his hair, it was always a mess. Draco was grateful he hadn’t hung around to try to talk.
“You’ve seen what happens. Are you alright? We can go on another one.”
“Dark magic? Are you sure?” Harry hadn’t bothered to look away. So Draco ducked his head, shuffled on his stand and wished the two would leave.
He’d head to one of the balconies and return home. The summons were completed. No point in making this an entire night. Apparation impossible within the house’s influence. Could he escape on wings? Going to the Floo this early would just highlight who left early. Slow and steady, he would leave everyone’s sight and escape without notice.
The elf left, humming a tune with Draco in-tow. The room was gone and nothing remained but these roots, everywhere in varying heights. A tray, served by Lotty, sat next to Harry on the floor.
“How is that relevant? Help me with this and I don’t know – what kind of thing do you even want Longbottom?” Draco sighed. How awful to try and negotiate when he had nothing, knew nothing of what Neville might want. These were basic mistakes and Draco couldn’t undo them nor ask for help from anyone else.
“Enough. Just take your soup.” Draco retreated back to the dresser. Harry thanked Lotty, who was starstruck at the compliment of her cooking. Harry took a few mouthfuls - and Draco was glad he hadn’t exploded, turned blue or dropped dead right there.
“That’s not the same.” Draco ignored Potter then, as he could see Luna hand over the gift to Mary. He tried to see more, but knowing Potter he’d ask and so he stood, watching what little he could of Luna’s reactions. She was smiling, beaming and talking. That was a good sign, wasn’t it?
“Hedwig didn’t like being cooped up either.”
Hermione would keep her position and in no way, shape or form would Draco Malfoy work or conspire to remove her from it. Such an admission might sound like loyalty but it was not so Hufflepuff in nature. Another Minister might just throw charges at him again. Hermione was a safety net for Scorpius keeping his family name. One Draco had tried to pull from the clutches of ruin.
Hmm. If they were being honest here, truly honest, his foot tapped. Honestly?
“Just—here, okay?” She threw a letter on the ground as she apparated. Its waxy seal heavy against the gravel.
“So, if I happen to have a Port-Key home--” Out of his pocket came a tiny penny, one of those Muggle currencies. He held it up between his fingers, between them both, and Draco reached out, grabbed over it and onto Harry’s hand. Good. Harry for once looked surprised as the view distorted and twisted.
“Yes, Harry, Chocolate Frogs are chocolate frogs.”
Nott and Pansy were together by the door, whispering away to each other and Draco said back, “Even if I wasn’t here the people I wanted to vote a certain way should still do that. Me not being here doesn’t make much sense. That’s just one vote.”
As Draco watched, Harry was hesitant to drink. “...Is this a Muggle thing?”
“You--” Harry let out a sigh, “Hermione was worried you know.”
Harry lurched. “You could tell?”
“Chocolate frogs jump,” Harry said as if that was somehow a counterpoint.
Harry picked them up before frowning. “How did you get these?” Draco explained and left, not keen to watch Harry read them. Checking on his lab, the newest bubbling cauldron, Draco ignored the world around him as he set to stripping more of the plants down to their bases. Not too many left now. He should be done--
“I should hand this over to you and Ron to look after. Thing’s probably terrified of me now.”
“I never once thought it was your fault. Ever.” How could Draco ever be relieved to hear those words – they shouldn’t even exist. Like he was a child again, Scorpius tugged at a sleeve of Draco’s robes, pleading. “I never faulted you, never. But if it makes it easier to forgive yourself, I forgive you.”
“I’m not short.”
“Sorry,” he told the adorable beast. Really, he wouldn’t mind even a quarter-pup because clearly no one else would adopt this one. “You’re stuck here, aren’t you?” If Draco had been brought into this room as a child, he wouldn’t have wanted this either. Because it wasn’t what a crup was in the Wizarding World, it wasn’t like the other status symbols or small and easier to hide away. Draco Malfoy wouldn’t have given this one a second glance back in the day. Time changed perspectives and Draco was certain this one was meant for him: clearly the breeder at least had taste - the bloody thing was practically the same shade his hair was.
Footsteps made his heart rate spike and he couldn’t say he found them too familiar. No, the magic too sour and uncomfortable.  He wasn’t going to be caught unaware again. He wielded his wand and turned to hex – Blaise or Theo, whichever had decided to return for their revenge – and Harry waved his hands, palms open.
“Muggle animals are ridiculous.” Draco and Harry sat on one of the many benches, thankfully not many Muggles were around at this time. “Why are the bears eating plants, the mammals laying eggs and the bloody well fish giving birth to live young.”
“She’s here!” Before Draco could ask the question which haunted him Harry continued, “She’s okay!”
Draco tilted his head as he watched Harry flee then back to the FireWhiskey bottle on the table. Really? Had he forgotten again he could just wave his wand and forgo the hunting of whiskey?
“Nothing quite so dramatic.”
Draco shook his head, running a hand through his hair checking to make sure the rain hadn’t made it rat tailed and awful. Harry could wander around with bad hair all he liked.
Draco could use this brat. Harry liked to ignore rules, snap back at others if they annoyed him regardless of rank or societal pressures. And this kid, this kid might give Harry a shove. To quit or to tell Hermione to shove her sabbaticals and her covering up his latest mistakes. Potter did like having to prove himself, one way or another.
In response the heavens rumbled and groaned. Draco flinched at the disorientating noise as if someone had put a metal bucket on his head and walloped it hard. He screeched back. Sound was not the problem, the ensuing downpour was. At first he could ignore it, simply an extra weight onto his wings. Heavy and constant, the rain soaked into his feathers and dragged him down in minutes. No matter how fast or hard he flapped, it was tiring and he waned in the air. He screamed again, made to land onto the grating of his home.
“No, I don’t but--” Draco stopped talking, not shutting down, no he was thinking. Hard. Lying wasn’t what he did, maybe exaggerate or let people panic over what he knew but lying didn’t help Draco. So he didn’t lie, not often. He didn’t realise the sheer amount of mental gymnastics he went through on a daily basis. His head hurt and as he looked to the clock, he had another hour left.
“I tried, I mean – I wanted to - I was trying to ignore you. I couldn’t stop thinking about you; and you, you almost died again.” Not quite sure what Harry was even saying, Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair, pulled it away from his face and how utterly devastated he seemed at giving voice to those words. “I couldn’t save you, twice.” Draco pushed himself to sit up, his leg hooking over one of Harry’s thighs.
“Lotty understands.” Unlike her typical reaction of rejected praise and hating being the centre of attention, she didn’t argue.
“Right. Sorry, forget I said anything.” The smile said something else and Draco didn’t have to wait long and Harry was proud of his words, “Fornax could chase away anyone I don’t want in my office.” He sat down next to him, no longer bumping into him. No, he was shoulder to leg next to him and Draco snorted.
Now he had his attention; what was he supposed to do with it?
Harry lounged on the couch, calmer and face no longer blotchy from tears or snot. “I can’t wrap my head round it. How’d you get Ron to help you?” He rubbed at his face while his glasses were pushed high.
“It’s a surprise!” Harry was still not letting any information go on what exactly Draco had been gifted. Why the extra paperwork?
Draco had taken to twisting and lifting his leg up into the air, examining the marks left. Harry had taken to curling into the pillows, trying his best not to stare too. But Draco could see him, he wasn’t as subtle as he thought.
“Better.” Draco conceded, huffed to himself as he saw the plate slowly go empty.  “Are you still hungry?” Draco didn’t hear the answer, he was too focussed on staring at the tray. Not as if it was the most interesting or curious thing in the world but his eyes locked onto it and everything else faded.
“I do not.” Harry turned to Matthews. “I like being the exact opposite of the centre of attention.”
Draco considered he was dead. For one, it was too dark and quiet and the pain had disappeared. In actual fact he felt quite good, indeedy. He didn’t last long, the weakness in his limbs and the fatigue – not like he’d fought to save his life, no, fatigue like a crup resting by a fire too cozy too move – made him yawn and sleep some more.
The real rings were underneath the house, a mid-floor between the cellar and the ground floor. Hidden behind a charm and in need of an invoking word for even the hinges of the door to appear. Creaking and groaning, the house shifted and as if someone hammered the appearance into the stone itself, piece by piece, the door emerged on a once blank wall.
“And yet you're here to apologise.” Silence. Draco wasn’t sure Scorpius was breathing. “You are here to apologize aren’t you?”
“Draco--” Harry grabbed at him again. Hearing his name out loud, not peppered with loathing or suspicion was almost enough for Draco’s irritation to be sated. Almost.
‘Found you.’
Harry became overly wary then. “Theo, what are you doing here?”
“It won’t stop,” Draco whispered as he could only watch as parts of the ring melted and dribbled and the carpet turned black too, crackling and filing the air with sulphur. He wanted to be sick and maybe it was because of the smell or maybe it was because of how hard and awful he sobbed because now - now he didn’t have anything of hers.
“Nott was?” They were talking about Theodore weren’t they? People weren’t pampered as much as Malfoy were but Notts were a close second. To leave it all wasn’t what Draco considered even possible for Theo never mind characteristic and agreed upon.
He asked again, phrasing it as a passing thought and not a key point of logic which put Blaise in poor standing, “If you were here to warn me of political change I don’t see why you couldn’t just send an owl instead of trespassing.”
Draco wondered how he hadn’t heard it before, the harsh and ripping sound of uneven and unsettled breathing. It hurt to listen to, like a vice crushing his quick extinguishing anger. He’d been wrong. This was all his fault. What was he supposed to do? How did he make this right?
“Come on.” Harry put his hand out and Draco glared at it. Did he forget what he said? He walked away first. Draco held on tighter to Neville’s shoulder else he might slap him away.
“I don’t mind her, really. She said you could do them.” Draco doubted every word of that. “I can tell you about what happened while you do.” It was a terrible deal with Draco only gaining more insight to how close Scorpius was to injury, from the very person who caused him harm in the first place. How accurate could Harry be, how truthful would his story be to reality?
“What?”
Hermione grinned and Draco tutted before he turned, wings pleased for a stretch. Tucked away in the hills of Scotland, Draco dropped off onto the window, pecked at the glass.
His attention was taken by the crup wiggling and trying its best to squeeze between his legs and Harry’s.
Lotty popped into existence and Draco wiped his face dry. “Mister Harry Potter asks if you’ll be much longer.”
Harry returned, like he always did, a few days later. Flooing into the Manor and looking ill-rested and a bit put out.
“I know.” Hermione cupped some water and dropped it over Draco’s head. Blinking away the stray droplets, he saw as Harry perked up.
A group of purebloods were after the Minister. Someone was after the Rings of Celius. His house lacked the wards of old and remained vulnerable. He’d allowed Potter to pull one over him with this Muggle notion of trading spittle meant a kiss (that said too much on what Muggles thought a kiss entailed, really). And in his rush out of the Ministry he noticed no registry form in his hands. Bugger.
Neither Siobhan, Lotty nor Draco ever claimed to have witnessed Harry use so much as an
Why did she have to bring that up? Urgh, he remembered reusing to go to some foreign place as a venue and Nott had got it and he’d been utterly furious and beside himself with angry snot and tears. So it was something he wanted but hadn’t considered.
“Do you secretly like all small animals?” Harry teased and Draco gave him a once over.
“No, he’s been driving me nuts since he got here.”
“Where are you going?” Why was he being avoided? Was this over the magic that’d spilled out of him?
The reminiscing about Hogwarts, Harry, Hermione and Ron was uncomfortable. In such that Draco did find some of them hilarious still - Ron using his broken wand to try and cast spells and how awfully sore that punch was from Hermione - to the more uncomfortable knowledge of how much effort he’d put into those bloody badges.
Draco had no idea what that turn of phrase meant (why ducks, why sitting, why was a duck sitting bad?). An explanation never came and Draco wished Muggles didn’t have so many sayings involving animals. “And?” He pretended to agree minus the duck part, all he had to do was not get off his face with FireWhiskey and it wouldn’t be an issue. As if Draco would hand people he hadn’t seen in months ammunition against him.
“How does it work? How exactly did all--” Harry abruptly stopped and Draco nearly tripped over him. The little box - phone - was handed over and Draco blinked. What was he supposed to do with this? Without answering, Harry tapped on the screen, wrote out a few words and then there sat more words, not on parchment.
“Let’s have a look at that wing.” Draco didn’t move, keeping calm as Mary opened up his left wing. It twinged near the joint and Draco fluttered his right wing to stop from falling off. He didn’t like this. He really didn’t like this. Harry had stepped forward and Draco could feel Mary tighten the leather rope on his leg. Nope. No, no, he wasn’t letting Potter touch him.
Draco’s magic was pulled, hard and sudden as if he was being forcibly apparated. The urge to push and pull away never rescinded no matter how much or how long magic was fed. What was clear, even to Siobhan, Draco’s magic wouldn’t satisfy. Only two people Draco could count on not to use this against him or Potter. Begrudging he pulled his hand away, knowing his magic was like Siobhan’s, already too frayed and used throughout to help. Between Lotty, Siobhan and Draco, Harry Potter would die. They needed more help.
Heavens above, Neville. “I’ll send word for a Healer this instant.” Neville punched his leg hard enough to make him flinch but he pretended it didn’t hurt. “Do you want to see it? The crup? More than some Muggle photo.”
“Take a breath. It’ll be fine.” Draco didn’t wish for his optimism. Offering a vague and tiny distraction in the form of a scratch wasn’t too bad though, so Draco accepted it and ignored the dread building in his chest. Who had he opened his home to? He’d sought her out and ended up with a liar.
“Your birthday cake!” Astoria smile dwindled, it was well known to Lotty to never let Scorpius wander into the kitchen. So what had he made? With what ingredients?
“Do shut up, you’re distracting me.” Cauldron Two sparked, caught onto Cauldron One and its sweep of purple and exploded into tiny red crumbs that glittered and hovered in the air with no urgency to drop. Draco gave it an extra stir clockwise.
“You’ve spent your whole life having the world baby you, protect you and you dare think you can say what you want about my son? You can say whatever you want to a Muggle, a half-blood little fanatic of your dad and not raise any ill attention but if your father wasn’t Harry, I’d have sent you to St. Mungos for what you said about him. Are we clear?”
His face heated. No, no, no. They wandered in silence. Harry next to him all the while. It was nice. To see him again. Odd feeling, really, considering their last meeting. Draco stared, no dark rings under his eyes. No veins burst in his cheeks from over consuming potions or stress. The Prophet photo on his desk was not of the same man.
“But… it’s chocolate.”
It took Scorpius some time to speak, which only meant he was considering backtracking and Draco remained quiet, drinking another and another glass. Scorpius hadn’t so much as sipped at his glass yet.
Draco wasn’t sure if he was glad or not Harry showed him the videos he’d taken. Granted seeing himself move was normal, not like those strange Muggle pictures. This phone seemed to also have caught Harry’s laughter as Draco’s expression changed.
Scorpius started to write faster, the parchment near scratching through with the strange Muggle contraption.
“You’re both mad, you know that?” Draco laughed, nervous and not sure why he was now, so uncomfortable in his own skin. “It wasn’t the same. As an owl it’s more like a -- hug, I guess? It’s comforting as an owl. It’s weird otherwise.”
“Where’d that confidence from earlier go?”
What was an immediate was the horror as ring claiming he needed to see to his husband – and Draco halted that thought then.
She beamed at Scorpius cooed over how big he’d gotten and awkwardly Scorpius pulled away, checked in with Draco.
“I’m the patient, yes? I’d like for you to get some scope on what I’ve been talking about. Maybe find a referral for this one. You can do that can't you?”
FLEE AS IF IT WERE A SNARLING JACKAL
And that’s all that was said between them. Scorpius might have assumed Draco to fret a little over the time it took for him to return at his message. But Draco knew the brat was trying to make point - just not say it. Yes, Draco had been terribly worried, unsure some might say. But Draco did not put in a three day disappearing act for the cheap thrill. The quicker he could illuminate the looming danger, the quicker Scorpius would be appeased and this lashing out could end.
“Are you awake?” he whispered. Nothing and somehow it made Draco fret more.
Astoria had told him one day when he’d asked her what she’d seen that had changed her mind on Muggles and Muggleborns. To this day he still didn’t know. He didn’t ever want to know, he’d seen enough for himself.
“I don’t know how to cast one. Do you think I’d be able to? Given that I. I’ve used Dark Magic,” Draco said, making conversation and having no intention of trying to summon a Patronus himself.
“You-- You wash your own dishes? By hand?” Draco did not witness Muggle chores and he wasn’t sure Harry was doing them right. Soapy water and submerging his hands? It couldn’t actually, be done by hand. Every dish and plate? Everything?
“We’ll make sure you’re compensated.” Harry sounded off, as if he wasn’t enjoying speaking about how powerful and fantastic the Aurors were now under his eye. Really, another Dark Wizard caught and Potter sounded like he was going to a funeral.
Draco didn’t need to wait the full hour, but he did. He didn’t need to slip into the same bed where Harry slept, but he did. For one, Harry had hilarious bedhead. Second – and perhaps Draco would acknowledge one day he was being facetious in his thoughts and this really was First priority - he didn’t want Harry to wake up alone and miserable.
Luna shook her head. “He’s just panicking in case I tell you what he said at the party.”
“You can’t divulge it yourself?” She only raised a now finely sculpted eyebrow and Draco admitted defeat. Healers that didn’t talk were rare but it wasn’t possible to hear much gossip from them. “I suppose you’ll be my plus one.”
“I think it might be Draco Malfoy’s.” Harry saying his name had Draco move forward a little, curious and also cautious to see if this was just a test. An elaborate plan to see if he had sentience. Potter co-ordinated plans with several departments, it wasn’t outside his capabilities.
“I am using happy memories, if you must know. I’ve not been standing around like a pillock thinking about tea cosies.”
When he heard Blaise, his voice close enough for him to feel the puff of air at his ear, Draco wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. Or why he was supposed to care. Really, everything was fine. “Potter’s here. Are you sure you aren’t mixed up in anything?”
“Talk, about anything.”
“It’s a stupid thing. A kid thing, it just popped into my head.” Harry shook his head more, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and Draco wasn’t sure what to think.
“Know whatever subjects you excelled in at Hogwarts doesn’t mean you’re stuck with, you don’t need to go into potions. Do what you want Albus.”
And on the last day, Harry nowhere in sight Draco found it dangerous his expectations now grew too. No matter how many times Draco heard or felt movement around the Manor - and it told him where roughly everyone was, Lotty in the ballroom and the other two together on the first floor. Draco wondered if he wasn’t going to be brought anything today. The absence was starting to make him wonder. Was one week of avoidance too much for Harry?
This idiot. This bloody idiot was the bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World? What kind of farce was this? What kind of fate did Draco Malfoy have to follow in order for this moron to understand the bigger picture?
“You did say last time I was here. Excuse--” Harry wouldn’t have it. He grabbed onto his elbow and Draco froze. Oh, this was the worst idea. Second only to snogging the bloke at a politically charged function.
He sat on the bed, he paced the room, he sat on the bed, he paced the room.
For a while, a shared drink at the Leaky, more boasting from Scorpius ended the afternoon well enough. At least, Draco assumed it well until his son started to puff up again like a peacock ready to charge. Urgh, boy. Not again.
Really, Draco needed a larger cauldron, the largest made twelve at most and Draco couldn’t tell how fast Harry was taking them right now. How long would it take to make a stronger dose? The somewhat guilty expression wasn’t what Draco was expecting. Potter really didn’t like asking for anything it seemed.
Decimus might not be the most intimidating of crups, might be on the scale of cutest than deadliest, but it did run like the wind especially when Draco called. For the most part, Draco only wished to spend a few moments outside to show off where the crup could go.
Just a FYI, this fic will never be abandoned, even if it takes me forever to finish. Thank you for your patience.
Harry left him at the bar and returned to the table and Draco was the one to heave a sigh, try as he might rid himself of this energy.
Wait. Was that supposed to be an insult?
Harry didn’t cast him a glance. So, Draco decided to escape the confines of the post by fluttering down to the floor and pulling the entire thing down with him. It thumped against the floorboards and Draco started to peck and nip at the leather again.
“I’d agree with him, mate. The thing will be biting into--”
“Oh off you get. Do you think every adult isn’t? Up.”
“Mary! Harry Potter is here! Can you take out the Australian Mask? They’d like to check it over,” The old man yelled behind the desk. Draco was certain no one else could hear the way Mary’s footsteps changed in sound. Suddenly she was heavy in step, like her feet were stomping on the floorboards - was she trying to power walk downstairs? Draco hooted a laugh. Harry smiled at him again and Draco lowered himself further. Damn it. Just go Potter.
Harry squinted and sank back into the bed. For a moment, Harry closed his eyes again and Draco though he might fall asleep before he asked, “How long?” His throat sounded shredded, and Draco had the urge to clear his own throat.
“Oh. Well, shit.” The facade of Blaise’s lies were caught and he sighed. Draco put his wand away as Blaise deflated like a boggart. At least he’d have an answer now that Blaise knew he couldn’t twist this into something else.
“You’re like a combination of everything I love and hate.” Emotional blackmail from a pet. Honestly. Draco huffed, gave the beast his full attention. (The ears were far too fluffy and soft to be left alone, the crup knew this).
Figure it out, Potter. Every past Head Auror would cringe at this.
“Want to know how Muggles get rid of it?”
“You don’t mind me calling you endearing? You’re so weird.”
Decimus wasn’t a dog. But it was unlikely he would befriend other crups due to Draco’s blackened name and Draco wouldn’t be at home all the time.
“That’s what I said!” Oh thank Circe, there was sense in that head. If Potter was here --“There’s this thing called a platypus…”
Harry landed, looking to his scuffed shoes, upset oddly at yet another win. What was he going to say he hadn’t put up a good enough competition?
“Going by his face, I don’t think he knew either.” Undoing the tie which, courtesy of Harry was tear-stained, Draco cast it aside. “He’s a loyal friend. Slightly jealous since it would seem mine aren’t even law-abiding on my account.”
“Don’t worry, we’ll get you fixed up.”
James scrambled to his feet, veins popping in his face. Unlike what Draco expected, his rage was directed at Harry.
“She did. I thought she was just using you as a mouthpiece, I guess.” Harry shuffled and Draco looked over him for any more hints as to why the embarrassment. All Draco saw was more cuts and dirt that Potter had refused to remove despite Draco’s permission to use the part of the Manor that still stood to clean up.
He dodged the kiss to his mouth, placed his forehead against Harry’s and sighed. Proper. He wanted to do this proper. So no one could argue it was any different from what he’d done before. But...
“I didn’t consider she could die,” he started only to pause not sure if Harry would interrupt with platitudes. “She’s been around forever, she’s older than some of the rooms at the Manor. She was stunned, what does that mean? Who delivers a dead body and only stuns the elf that might see them?”
“I’m not willing to bet his life on that.” Charlie just settled into the Protective Older Brother archetype so easily. Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed at the posturing. This wasn’t up for Draco or Charlie to bicker and waste time.
he searched, making sure not to fall to the temptation of
“He’s usually… more prone to snapping and biting.”
“Why Draco’s?” Hermione saying his name was always… not fine. Her saying his name after everything just kept proving how much more of a mature adult she was than him. At no times did he ever think of her as - as the - as the term - from back when. But Granger was common for him to denounce her with, especially with the marriage with Weasley.
Was it pathetic of him to want to forgive Blaise at the drop of a single possibility? Blaise had always been there and now he wasn't. Draco had other things to do, more important questions to ask.
No going back on this now. This was the best route of action, it wasn’t his favourite – wouldn’t be Harry’s either but it was necessary. They couldn’t go on like this. With Draco’s trust at an all time low and paranoia at a high he sniped at Harry each and every time he could. And Harry’s lack of sleep, lack of admittance he was ill, he was struggling, left him too in a foul mood.
There it was, the implication this Muggle knew Harry best, knew him longer and had many secrets to share. Draco wasn’t fooled, wasn’t taking the bait and yet Harry still tried to defend him.
Hoping it'll pass soon though. (I suspect just a cold. Which case, I'll be golden soon enough).
“Are you finished yet?”
“Then, the magic before, returns.” The cup overflows and Draco squinted at the sight, “You made an All-Mother, so my guess is you’ve been taking that potion for at least, what, five years?”
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes widened and Draco might have swore too but Blaise made more noise. Blaise backed up and Draco’s anger had him withdraw his wand.
He did not know the people Harry spoke about and for once he was glad. This was the perfect time to stop. Go find Hermione and usher her into the room as a distraction. But-- it... Draco needed clarity.
“What can I do for you, Mr. Potter?” He cleared his throat, turned his back on both of them at the table.
Well, he’d spent as long as he could in the bathroom. Trying to calm the redness of his face and the croak of his throat finally, showing its injury by the shouting and crying earlier. The return to his bedroom wasn’t a much desired one. What would Harry say now? Clearing his throat, trying to test how raw and miserable his voice was he muttered a few words, to Harry who had perched on the bottom of Draco’s bed. He used to door to cover himself from whatever slew of could-be insults.
“Sorry, no more deliveries today. I don’t think I can handle it.”
“We hardly need to go back to--” Draco cut himself off, glanced up to the pair of ladies who were bickering. One of them shushed the other, and upon noticing he was watching and fell into silence.
“Not necessary Lotty, but I'll take it under advisement.” He ran a hand through his hair, scalp far too warm and now too self-conscious over the heat on his face.
And that was sad and worrying because if Moran hadn’t even been given a sentence, a slap on the wrist then it was possible he was simply waiting. Waiting for what? Perhaps his father had another target? Another panic, another thought maybe it was Scorpius he was waiting to use for the rings flared.
Right. Well, Draco huffed to himself, the disappointment on his son’s face annoying him. Now, he needed a distraction. Finding someone to help with this Muggle cooking couldn’t go amiss. And he was supposed to deal with the lack of apothecary that would resupply him the necessary ingredients for Potter’s potions.
“Trust me.” Harry sat by him but not too close and Draco wondered why. Until the door opened and out came a barrage of crups of varying size and colour, Freya standing looking anything but pleased.
“It’s boring in here.” Harry looked around the room and Draco caught the sigh. And that was a jump in conversation. Again.
It may have also been an excuse to test how Harry seemed to relax - melt, for his whole body seemed to slump - whenever Draco had his fingers at his scalp. That was cute, Draco had decided, very much so. Well, clearly he wasn’t getting much of anywhere with this but he continued for a few minutes, playing absent-mindedly with Harry’s constant bed head.
Well, it wasn’t awful, so Draco allowed it.
"You have to bear Potter's child. It doesn't matter if you love him or not. Your mother gave birth to you with that gift, so don't waste it." Lucius said in an overtly authoritarian aura.
Alden fell silent. Actually, he wanted to change his duty of delivering breakfast to a maid, but he knew very well not to disobey his master's direct orders. Based on his master's sudden good mood and satisfied look, Alden was very much aware of what happened last night in this room. Thank you very much.
Harry bowed slightly, then lightly touched Draco's cheek. The young man groaned softly and then changed his sleeping position but did not wake up. Harry took the risk by bowing down and kissing Draco on the lips, tasting the sweetness of them. Until then, he dissolved in his unsteady passion and crushed Draco's lips.
The entire chapter got me like: *face palm*
Troya, who was a prince that secluded—Ares, didn't want to frighten him. He was still a virgin, and his father's restraint nature meant he didn't get familiar enough with men. Ares knew his reputation among humans wasn't very good. The prince was most likely frightened when he was brought to Olympus.
"Icarus," the other man said. Now there are no wings on his back, only a sword behind him.
"You're so desperate. I doubt Ares will ever leave you," Alastair tried to comfort him.
"I can help you, Ares. I might be able to keep him stay legally at Olympus." Hera offered.
A few minutes passed, now Draco began to raise his right arm. It seemed his body was gradually recovering. He wanted to get out of the place immediately. The strange older man was muttering something right now. His wrinkled hands seemed to be stirring something rotten and dark in his earthenware bowl.
God knows he's been trying to save this boy. But somehow, this blonde had such a strong determination to harm him until he forgot that he had already challenged the most dangerous man.
"Repeat what you said, Athena," Zeus rebuked firmly from atop his throne.
"No, I don't know," Draco replied stubbornly.
That sentence made Draco's head suddenly feel heavy. The words Cedric had just said disturbed Draco's composure.
=WARNING=
His husband's fingers tapped on his reclining chair as if he was venting his boredom.
"Oh, come on. This pack isn't as large as your study room. Don't think negatively before you try," said Ron. "Well, stop all your activities for now because, during the next session, we will be busy adventuring!"
Draco knew that the bird didn't hunt like an eagle. Even more suspicious—they shouldn't want to get that close to a living human. Vultures were not commonly domesticated birds. They can't be trained to send mail like a carrier pigeon or look beautiful in a cage.
Draco saw Harry standing among them, moving on to another person and another. Draco started changing places again. Now he was in a small village filled with children. They were running here and there, but the village suddenly turned dark, and their houses caught fire. Several children screamed, and again it made Draco's ears buzz.
"Do I look pretty, Harry?" asked Arabelle, flashing her happy smile at Harry.
"That vulture! Have you forgotten what the priests taught you?! It's one of God Ares' pets!"
The frown that adorned Harry's forehead immediately disappeared when he heard Draco's words. "Yeah, I should be with Arabelle right now. If only my work didn't pile up."
Harry wiped his face with both hands as the tragic event—the nightmare—came back to haunt him. The day when the center of his world was snatched away from him. The day his soul went with the person he loved the most, Ginny Weasley, soulmate for life and death.
Draco had a dream. His body felt light as if he was floating. He felt comfortable like a baby who had never known danger. Then he felt her back touch a slightly complicated but cool surface. His fingers touched the soft mat that he recognized. He was in his own room. Draco was refreshed and woke up after realizing that his husband had been carrying him.
There was a large painting hanging on the wall. A huge painting with a lovely golden frame. But it wasn't the size of the picture or the beauty of the frame that stunned Draco, but the person in the picture.
"Draco, you better put on this dress, or you'll really regret it." Harry started hissing angrily. His hand grabbed the green dress and threw it carelessly at Draco, who immediately caught it and carefully held the dress.
He had thought about it several times. Living as Troya as he was right now would be equally as displeasing to him. Indeed he was the King's son. Troya received the best services and facilities as the beloved son of the King of Sparta. But living everyday life as a
Draco approached the man, trying not to notice his arrival. But it turns out he saw Draco.
The young man was busy looking for spices in the garden, crowded with various wild plants. Draco could even find rare truffles there. But he needed more basil and rosemary for his meal tomorrow. He once took private lessons with the chef of a Michelin-starred restaurant, but he remains an amateur chef. Even so, he was sure that the food would taste better than what the Nymphs cooked. He didn't need to take this job too seriously.
Cedric directed his hand to tuck Draco's hair that seemed to come out of his hair tie because of the naughty wind in this place. Cedric brought his hands to cup Draco's face after ensuring the hair was no longer covering his beautiful face.
Draco stayed where he was. He gently rubbed his eyes over his dress. He didn't want anyone else to see his tears. After all, Draco was a queen of a great empire. He couldn't seem weak in front of anyone.
Discussing with Draco was one of the things Harry loved to do when he wasn't with his mistress, Arabelle. Really, Harry truly admired Draco's brain, which had many unique solutions to all the questions he asked.
"How did you get along with His Majesty's mistress?" Natalie asked without a second thought which made Draco slightly raise his eyebrows. "If Your Majesty doesn't want to answer, that's okay. I know if this question sounds inappropriate. Your Majesty can forget this question." Natalie continued quickly when she saw Draco's silence.
"Curious about me?"
When he saw Draco and Greyson's togetherness in the garden, Harry seemed to want to explode. He was jealous. But why? Is it because Harry doesn't like what was his to be taken by someone else? Yeah, it could be because now Draco was his lover.
"Ah, Draco asked me to feed him because his body is still weak..." replied the doctor nervously. He quickly put Draco's bowl on the table, then got up from his chair. "Since Mr. Potter is here, I'll excuse myself. There are things I still have to do." with that, Doctor Jason excused himself.
"I'd like to try it, but I can't," Draco said sadly, managing to make Cedric's smile fade.
"I forgive you because you just woke up from your long, deep sleep." Then Harry turned to the refrigerator next to him.
Draco's instinctive urge forced him to break free from Harry's grip.
Draco and the rest of the palace hall witnessed a sight that they had never seen. The vulture trembled and spread its wings. Then the bird squealed loudly as if it had just had a shot of adrenaline. Clumps of muscle and veins are clearly visible from beneath the feathers. Its body grew rapidly until it was almost the size of a horse.
Alden shrugged his shoulders. “Mr. Tom harbored anger towards you, master. Mostly because your actions have entirely crushed the entire project planning."
"Okay, I'll take care of it," said Harry at last.
"Because they don't live on Olympus. All the secrets of the Titans are here, Ares!"
Hyde is a genius assassin with a psychopathic mentality, which is very cruel and maniac. He kills his victims with very thoughtful calculations and can sometimes be very cruel. Up until now, no one knew the real figure of the killer. They all called him Hyde because he always managed to kill his victims…until now.
Without thinking, Cedric immediately lifted Draco in his arms. Panic was clearly depicted on that handsome face. Cedric ran fast from the training ground.
His mother left a few minutes ago. She left some money for Draco, even though he doesn't ask for money from his mother anymore, but his mother said it's his birthday. So Draco can use the money and buy anything he wants.
Soft music played along with Harry and Draco's elegant dance. At this time, only the Emperor and Empress filled the dance floor, while the other nobles chose to pull over to the side of the ballroom and watch a romantic scene that might later become a hot conversation among nobles.
The glitz of the lobby was intimidating, and Draco felt all eyes on him as if he was a misplaced freak. His hands gripped the envelope of files Seamus had given him this afternoon and tried to challenge the piercing gaze of the receptionist who was looking at him suspiciously.
Draco turned and narrowed his eyes. A slight glare from the very bright sun. It was Hermione's husband, Ron. The redhead wore a black suit and smiled faintly at him. Even though he was Harry's business partner, luckily, this one was a good man and loved his wife. Draco recalled Ron and Hermione's affection at the party that night and was amazed at the amount of love that emanated from Ron and Hermione when they met eyes.
Draco hummed softly, his fingertips gently touching a bunch of pink roses that had just bloomed. The soles of his feet carefully stepped over the grass that was drenched with dew.
Draco's words seem to have brought Harry back into consciousness. The man was stunned. And a second later of relief, Harry let Draco go. "Damn you!!" Harry whispered sharply into Draco's ear and left the room.
"Draco,"
"Your
Draco chose to sit under a large, shady olive tree while writing something on papyrus. He noticed when his manservant peeked at his busyness and only frowned. He did not write Greek letters but Latin letters in English. Of course, it was not something the ancient Greeks could understand—especially a servant like him. Draco felt safe writing anything even if he idly complained about the Spartan royals he didn't like.
Draco bit the hand that was covering his mouth. But the hand did not let go of his mouth and instead pulled him into the corner of the room. Suddenly Draco is in another place. But it felt like he recognized the place quite well. Reflexively, Draco elbowed the face of the person who was still covering his mouth, and finally, the person pulled their hand away.
"I just want to get out of this place!!" shouted Draco angrily, frustrated that Harry had used sneaky threats to prevent him from running.
Ares liked his current expression. The prince looks sincere and nervous with him. His gaze became a little different. It was something Ares wanted. He hated it when his wife smiled so quickly at other people. But right now, he saw different gestures and expressions. The thing Draco only showed when he's with Ares.
Harry entered the house furiously. Alden and the others had surrounded the white villa. The villa was quiet and lonely as if no one was there. Then Harry's eyes turned to the door at the end of the hall, which was half open, and stepped out of it, then entered in a rage when he saw what was happening there.
She gasped as if she had just realized that her cries might invite the nobles to come to this place. If those gossip-hungry nobles came to that place, Arabelle was sure, the reputations of King Harry and Queen Draco would definitely be disgraced.
"I just found out that Your Royal Highness has a habit of eavesdropping and stalking other people," Draco said as he tried to act as casual as possible.
"I'm not mad at you," Ares said casually without looking at him.
After that, Draco chose to stay silent the whole trip while wearing his headset and listened to music, trying to keep himself busy with his phone screen as much as possible. He couldn't hear Harry speak, or the man simply didn't talk. Draco didn't really care either.
Draco tapped Icarus on the shoulder, a little awkward. "Don't worry. I won't deal with him again after this."
"I-I want to vomit... Please help me," Draco pressed his stomach, trying to be as convincing as he could.
The bartender returned, handed the blond a piece of paper and a pen.
Simple indeed, but for some reason, Draco still exudes an aura of extraordinary luxury even though his beautiful body was wrapped in that simple plain clothes.
Draco's body was burning all over, hot with anger and fever with passion. This man was clearly so skilled at flirting with his partner that even the inexperienced Draco was carried away by his passion, overcoming his hatred.
Lucius then raised one of his eyebrows before his lips pulled into a faint smile. "I trust you so much, I trust you so much, I even put you in the position of queen," He replied sarcastically.
Of course, Draco denied it. "I'm not your lover."
"You're a madman!" Draco screamed with flaming anger.
"Maybe. There is another way to make him a Titan without having a god to guarantee him. That is if he can adapt among the Titans. He had to prove that he could be quite useful on Olympus. Not only as your sleeping partner, Ares." Hera said with a slight smirk on her pretty face.
Not wanting to stand and stare at the bustle of his subordinates, he then stepped his feet towards the place where the horses belonging to the group were rested. Before actually leaving, it would be best if he chose a horse to use later.
Harry growled internally. He thought he could threaten Harry by letting himself starve. He did not know that Harry would use any methods to get Draco to surrender to him.
He had already put poison, which would not be detected, on the bottom of the glass specially prepared for Harry Potter tonight. Harry Potter doesn't want to use the same glass as other people. The glass was exclusive, especially for him to use, and this afternoon while pretending to clean the bar, Draco sneaked into the particular storage area and put an undetectable poison on the glass. Harry Potter swallowed a drink from a glass that had been smeared with poison, and then all his revenge would be avenged.
Draco suddenly felt sad about the journey of his life. Confronted Doctor Jason, who always looked cheerful and unburdened, made Draco want to cry, and his eyes began to fill with tears.
7. Glamour or 'charm hood' is the power that all mythical creatures have to hide their original appearance from humans. Still, only Harry can use Double Glamour that cannot be seen by humans and mythical beings, except by Draco.
"Do ask," Draco tucked a few strands of his hair that were flying because of the small wind that entered the carriage.
Harry couldn't be that cruel, could he? Draco looked into Harry's eyes with terror, trying to find the truth, but he couldn't find anything. This man was cruel, and who knows what he will do.
A splash of warm water soaked the two of them, making the glass of the bathroom mist from the steam.
"Watching me so I can't hide from you while you can find out where I live? Very funny," Draco responded sarcastically.
He nodded his head hesitantly to answer Arabelle's question with a fine frown still on his forehead.
"What are you doing?" asked Harry, confused.
"I'm fine," Draco said.
Even so, Ares always hoped that Hephaestus would make a new sword for him. He was the best blacksmith in the world—fitting his title as the god of volcanoes and blacksmiths. Unfortunately, it's been thousands of years since they haven't really greeted each other because his wife Aphrodite had an affair with Ares.
"Stop it," Harry warned in a low voice, making Draco whimper again. He grabbed the front of the man's shirt even harder, trying to get him to give Draco a little mercy.
Actually, what had happened to these people? Did they think Draco was so crazy that he played with a guy behind his husband's back? Tsk! If he had longed for love and attention, surely long ago, he had been looking for another man who could warm his heart.
When he got home, his mother was not home yet. His mother always comes home at night, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, because there are more restaurant visitors on these days. Draco opened the refrigerator and took out a box of cereal, complete with milk. After taking the bowl, he prepared his meal.
"Good evening, Your Majesty. May blessings always be with you and this kingdom."
All the guards held their breath when they saw that smile. Seeing how fierce Cedric was when he was fighting, the guards were overcome with fear that their queen would be hurt later.
He was immediately greeted by tall pillars and a huge statue of the Goddess Athena when he was inside. There was still the smell of fragrance there because this temple was never devoid of ritual offerings. Draco saw Oracles blessed with longevity and wisdom from the gods sitting around. Occasionally they will convey a prophecy or message from the gods to humans who stop by.
"You're so lucky Potter likes you, Pans,"
Draco then averted his gaze to the side. He didn't want to look at Cedric. Even though he was currently looking at him with a piercing gaze and shouting at him harshly, Draco could still find a glimmer of frustration and sadness that was so deep in Cedric's eyes.
"You know it's impossible," declared Harry.
Of course, at all times, Draco would never be able to comply with the ridiculous request ever made to an Omega like him. The Alpha thought with Draco's position being at the bottom of the caste. He would want to be made a pet who would follow the man's will constantly?
Draco sighed in frustration. "You guys just misunderstood!" he said decisively. "Stop talking like I like him. How many times do I have to tell you I'm just kidding."
"Where's the Oracle who found me?" Draco asked again.
"I'm fine, but what I want to know is, what is God Ares like?" Draco asked.
He wanted to run away from this party and drown again with the popular books among the Delion people that Natalie had given him.
The girl, Arabelle Ansbach, lowered her voice.
"Don't you want to try to feel it? Falling in love is fun," said Cedric, smiling widely and showing rows of white teeth.
All the guards who were right there on guard bowed their bodies without daring to look at Harry as the man walked right in front of them. Well, that was indeed one of the royal regulations that have been implemented since this kingdom was formed.
Natalie clung to the arm belonging to the King of the Delion, who no longer looked so stout. The man's strength had been eaten away by time. Even so, Natalie managed to show everyone that she was a woman who loved her husband, even though Draco knew very well that she had been playing with her stepson behind her husband.
Ares took Draco's hand and asked him to stand up.
"You think I'll believe you?"
"No, Hogwarts is ours."
Harry was silent and froze. When he finally looked at Draco, his eyes were cold as ice. The man looked really, really angry at Draco. "So, you admitted..." Harry stepped back again, and Draco felt immense relief that the man did not take his anger out on Alden, who had knelt helplessly on the floor.
Harry felt like he was going crazy. He hasn't had sex with any women lately. Because he's not interested, his craving was centered on Draco. This young man made him want to subdue him, conquer, and dominate him possessively. Harry wanted Draco to bend to his feet, adoring him as so many people did to him.
Icarus nodded, and the sword disappeared in the blink of an eye. As Icarus said, Draco only needed to summon the sword.
Alden shrugged his shoulders. “You can take the pain away. Tomorrow, once you have him, maybe he will be even more obedient."
If the Spartan prince were destined to die before meeting Ares, his body would probably be sent back to Sparta. Ares knew that prince Troya's current position was in Hades' territory. It was the worst place for humans because the monsters there were much more ferocious than in other areas. In addition, Hades likes to experiment with humans in the name of science.
Draco could feel every curve and every tendon of Harry's cock buried deep inside his body. Even though it had been more than half an hour, the other man still didn't want to move and give Draco what he needed, what Draco wanted.
Draco was just about to apologize for his impolite behavior, but the loud thumping of his bedroom door and the voice of a man he knew very well made Draco stop his sentence before he could finish speaking.
"Prince Troya, are you sure you don't want to take a warm bath? We've got some great herbs for muscle soreness," Alastair offered Draco when he was ready and refreshed since morning to explore his husband's palace.
Harry looked at Draco and sneered. "Don't hallucinate," he sighed irritably.
In fact, before him, he was a real Greek god who was very old and had a lot of experience. Moreover, he was ready to pounce on him. Finally, he nervously looked up at the ceiling of his room.
Draco considered saying it, but in the end, he said it anyway. "Hell?" he asked doubtfully.
Narcissa immediately ignored all of her work and walked over to Draco. She hugged Draco tightly and caressed his head gently. "I'm always with you," she stated reassuringly.
Draco stared at Doctor Jason sharply. "I'm not his lover, and never will be!" Draco hissed angrily.
It was one of Ares' duties as a god. He had to prevent the monsters from running amok in human settlements. Olympus kept the monsters to repel and frighten humans. But there's always something out of control. Humans remember the monsters in legend, like the nine-headed serpent monster named Hydra, who Hercules fought, or the Cyclops in the story of Jason and the Argonauts.
"Of course not." Ron turned the steering wheel, slowing the car a bit as it entered the gates of the packhouse. "You can take one of the Omegas in our pack to go."
Draco's eyes suddenly turned dark. He took a few staggering steps back from Harry. Draco returned to where he was, staring at Harry, whose eyes had now returned to normal. Seeing Draco's terrified face, Harry started asking him.
Draco moved his eyes to look at Cedric, who had been staring at him with admiration. "I think you must know what my answer is, Prince Cedric," He said with a smile and gently closed the thick novel on the wooden table. He put his elbows on the table and rested his chin on his hands.
His eyes were wide and fragile with a golden brown finish, and Daphne had so much accentuated his high cheekbones' structure that they looked attractive and aristocratic. And his lips are polished with a peach lip gloss in a nuance that makes his lips always look wet.
"Looks like someone's coming," said Cedric, who seemed to have also caught the same sound.
"This must be a dream," Draco whispered, trying to calm his racing heart.
Draco let out a sigh of exhaustion and satisfaction. Harry wrapped around the blond’s middle. Draco’s entire body felt sore, especially his stomach and now limp, oversensitive cock.
His only chance might be to negotiate with the entourage who would pick him up later. Hopefully, they weren't real Ares' followers because if they were from Olympus, all the gold pieces he had would be of no value to them.
Harry raised his eyebrows in an interesting motion. Harry then spun around so that he could now face the large red curtains at the far end of the ballroom.
Harry finally takes pity and switches their positions, gently lying Draco down on his desk and hovering over the pretty blond with a predatory grin. He slips his cock in Draco's slick-wet hole just as he kisses the blonde, swallowing his desperate cries.
"I'm going back to the office. Oh yes, Hermione greets you," with a dazzling smile, Ron gave a friendly wink, then turned and walked out of the lobby.
Waking up breathless, Draco rubbed his sweaty forehead. He realized that what had just happened was a dream. Draco reached for the glass on the nightstand. He drank the water until the last sip.
Draco glanced at Harry for a moment. Sometimes the man's words just can't be trusted. But considering all these things are possible, Draco began to believe in him. His eyes were now on Professor Trelawney again when Luna suddenly nudged him on the shoulder.
"Your Majesty, you should have let me go. We've already missed the pair swap part." Draco said as he lifted his face so he could see Harry's face.
"What? Is he serious?" Ares was surprised and confused.
Yes... certainly. Draco imagined himself dressed in fancy clothes, dressed by a professional makeup artist, free to do whatever he wanted. Most importantly, he had the golden opportunity to go out with Alpha which is the dream of all Omegas.
Wait. Not necessarily immortal, right? Like werewolves, they are not immortal. But Draco still called them immortal. Yes, at least Harry
Draco stared at Harry in silence. Harry's parents had also died, that was what he knew, but somehow, the information about Harry's parents was kept tightly, so far away that no one could dig it up.
"The air is getting colder. It would be better if Your Majesty returned to the tent," Cedric said formally, lifting his ass from the wood he had just sat on the last few minutes.
"In that case, I also apologize for what I said earlier, Your Majesty. I realize that the existence of a child sounds impossible." said the King of Delion without a second thought, which managed to make Draco feel a little uncomfortable.
“One more time,” Harry said, both of them were lucid enough now, “I want to fuck you one more time.”
"Hey, strange man! What are you doing? Hurry up and walk!" ordered a man whose path was blocked by Draco. It was actually Harry who got in his way, but the man definitely didn't see Harry.
In an instant, the castle was immediately filled with dense fog, black clouds swarming to fill the clear sky above them, the lightning that started to flash made the atmosphere even tighter. Draco really can't avoid his destiny.
"If your words just now were a new ruse to get me to look for Omega elsewhere again—"
Even after he got into a relationship with Blaise Zabini, one of his close friends, he still couldn't get over his feelings for his first love.
Somehow the scent of flowers doesn't make him nauseous like the smell of food. It might sound a little strange, but Draco thought he felt a little better outdoors than indoors, which made him feel short of breath.
"I'm not offended. Men are like that," Attica shrugged approvingly.
The sound of the door being pushed violently made Draco jolt in surprise. Hastily, the young man tucked the vulgar book Glenice had given him under his soft goose pillow.
A fine frown graced Harry's forehead at the question.
"Not my taste, but okay," Ares said again.
The Spartan warriors might have been discouraged if the Oracles hadn't said that Goddess Athena was on Sparta's side this time. But there was something else that preoccupied his mind more than anything right now. An Oracle who brought medicine to Troya said that God Ares asked his son to be his wife in exchange for his recovery.
Draco's starting to feel uncomfortable, so he might as well tell them that he recognizes them in their true form. From their face, Draco could see confusion and surprise.
"Draco, what are you doing here?"
Draco turned his head towards Daphne, who was also in the room, tidying up Draco's seemingly endless clothes, and kept coming into Draco's wardrobe.
Harry positioned himself so precisely as if he had known every inch of Draco's body. And Draco felt Harry's hot, hard body merge with his, giving a tantrum of pleasure that grew even deeper.
"Do you have any business with me?" Draco asked and immediately felt stupid about it. It was a vulture, not a chimpanzee.
Draco watched Harry's face slowly. He could see the look of worry and frustration over his handsome face. Draco knew he had to do something. Without saying anything, Draco stepped smoothly toward his husband's desk. He made brief eye contact with Harry before he decided to kneel right next to Harry.
"Prince of Sparta, I am Eros, son of Aphrodite. Sorry I overheard your conversation," The handsome man introduced himself. Draco just nodded. Eros was the God of Love whose story was famous in Greece. About him who fell in love with Psyche and had time to oppose his mother. Eros was Aphrodite's son from her affair with Ares.
With Harry Potter, his first love.
"Buying time," Harry repeated. He suddenly looked nervous. "So that I can stay here longer, w-with you." Harry quickly turned his face to the side so Draco wouldn't notice his blushing face, embarrassed.
"No! I don't want to! I'll sue all of you!" Draco felt sick. He bent over, clutching his stomach, his diaphragm muscles forcing him to press the contents of his stomach out through his esophagus. But there was nothing he could vomit.
Ares was a God. No one could go against God's will or question their morality. Moreover, even though Ares was the most hated God, he was still one of the twelve main Gods of Olympus. But now, he came with a lavish gift for the king and formally asked for their son.
Draco was standing like a statue. Even as Harry bring their hands together, he allowed Potter to continue speaking. Draco had never expected that hand to feel so warm and soft.
"What happened?" Harry asked in a choked voice, the man's heart beating fast too.
"Aahhh..."
Draco lets out a long sigh. "Bad day, I met a weird man,"
"Like Alastair and the other warrior there, I want to be able to do what they do."
Draco bit his lower lip which was starting to tremble. Did Draco have to give it a chance? Draco didn't want to be a hypocrite either. He wanted to feel the thing called
"I can't, Draco! I can't!" shouted Cedric while shaking Draco's arms so hard with the enormous power.
Without saying anything, Harry spurred on his horse quickly. The sky had darkened, and the sounds of wild animals were starting to dominate the forest as if they were forcing the husband and wife to hurry out of the woods.
"The bird is dead. You'd better just put him here. The snakes will surely be happy to have a lovely meal." said Harry with a straight face.
Can Draco get through everything without Harry with him?
This new plot will make those who read it angry and annoyed because I also feel the same LMAO. Harry really is an asshole and a fool in this fic. Poor Draco.
As much as possible, Harry controlled his sentiments. He didn't want the anger that was currently filling his heart to ruin the party that the Delion Kingdom had prepared for them.
Luna joined in tidying up her books and grabbed the bag that was lying at her feet. "I'll see you this afternoon, Dray…" she said and left the classroom ahead of Draco.
The large vulture walked towards him, looking at him with its eyes that looked friendly at first. Draco looked around him. He's alone. There were probably several guards watching him from afar, but the bird only focused on him.
Draco reached into his pocket and found his cell phone as intact as before. He started to cross the street and call Luna. When his call was picked up, Draco asked Luna to meet him at their usual meeting place.
"You are the one who is targeted by your enemies. Why should I even bother?!" interrupted Draco angrily with burning eyes.
"And if the persuasion of the smiling doctor does not easily fool you, you will not be kidnapped easily." Harry interrupted sharply.
But right now, Draco couldn't laugh at the show anymore because the Titans who were now escorting him to Olympus—had just confessed that they came from another solar system. At least, that's what the young man concluded.
"Where are we going?"
The Nymphs and Satyrs, who were not human, took care of the kitchen instead. Of course, the food served was not exactly delicious. Moreover, Nymphs like to eat raw meat. It's only natural that their meat dishes taste tough.
Cedric just smirked and shrugged his shoulders. Without saying anything, the brunette stepped into the place where the royal guards were training.
"N-Nothing," Draco replied nervously, trying to swallow the lump that seemed to have caught it in his throat.
"Yeah, that's possible. It's not the first time Ares was grown tired of his lovers and left them. But if he had wanted to, you wouldn't be here now, and he's still letting you roam around his palace and gathering spices," Eros hummed.
Did he have a fever? Draco gasped. Everything felt hot… He needed to...
"Your Majesty, is my embroidery done now?" the girl asked, holding the cotton cloth in her small hands.
The man grabbed Draco's hand and hugged him. Then he flapped his wings. He took Draco flying, entirely off the ground. "What the hell! Hurry up and put me down!" shouted Draco frantically.
Hearing that familiar deep voice, Draco quickly wiped the tears that were still on his cheeks using the back of his hand. He took a moment to take a deep breath before he lifted his face and smiled at the other man.
"What?"
Draco ends up eating his food again, and suddenly he chokes. It was as if someone was choking him, and he couldn't breathe. Draco saw a glimpse of Icarus choking him, but the man wasn't there. Draco hit Icarus from the right and hit his handsome face.
Draco determined as he took Alastair's hand, who would guide him into the horse carriage. Draco thought back, in his time, there was such a thing as a magician. Even Draco had seen David Copperfield's fly in a bubble around the theater without a harness. The vulture that turned giant could be a super sophisticated magic trick.
“Please…”
"Drug? Am I poisoned?" Draco asked innocently.
All need sacrifice. Draco realized that revenge took great sacrifice. Like when he had to dress up as a cheap woman in a mini skirt and sexy clothes. Sometimes night after night, he had to endure the torment of the noise and frenetic music, or he had to endure because of the many flirtatious men always thought he was a cheap woman to buy.
"I want hi—" Harry's words stopped, but then he was pointing at the woman. "I want her." The words were spoken in a calm, lazy tone, but the echo could be heard throughout the room.
Feeling desperate, Draco sat up, hugging his knees. In this case, how can he get out of this house? Meanwhile, he could not even leave this room. His eyes glanced at the bedroom door. The locked door was the only way. But the only ones who could go in and out of the door were only Harry, and also a cold-looking man named Alden, who was always beside Harry every chance he got. The cold-looking man seemed to be assigned to deliver the food.
"Ah, you must have never heard of the outside world," Hermione laughed again. "Gossip is spreading fast in this elite world. You are the most talked-about person these days."
"No, but I'm sure that angel has a goal of loving a demon. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dared to take such a big risk." Draco didn't even know where the words came from.
Draco tried to wriggle, terror creeping over him when he realized that this man in front of him was not only the bad guy, but he was the terrifying psychopath Harry had been talking about.
"I'm happy and relieved," Ares said.
Cedric laughed out loud. For a moment, Draco just stared at the man who was laughing until he finally stopped laughing and cleared his throat.
Draco smiled with satisfaction when he saw the beauty of his embroidery. His dainty fingers moved to clean the cotton cloth from the small embroidery threads stuck to it.
It was time for Draco to free the poor man. With Hector’s title and physical beauty, he would have no shortage of beautiful women. In vain if he waits for a son who was forbidden to marry by his father. Especially now that he would be sacrificed to become the bride of the God of War, Draco also asked his servant to walk faster and away from Hector.
"Ha! I caught you!"
Draco chuckled. "My mother likes growing flowers too, so I guess that's natural for some women." Draco felt sad when he remembered his mother's face, who always cheerful when talking about flowers.
"Give me one chance, Draco. We'll both be happy in this relationship, trust me," Cedric said.
"Here you are. I've been looking for you everywhere, dear." the deep voice distracted Hermione from Draco.
"What is the purpose of these angels and demons of loving and having children? That is my question now." Professor Trelawney put down her sketchbook and then sat on the edge of the table.
"No, prince of Sparta. Humans only perform magic. Therefore it is strictly forbidden to do it on Olympus. We as Titans only act with logic and science," Argus chimed in.
"You are a Demigod!" repeated Harry. This time his voice rose a little.
Both Charles and Draco then danced to each other to the rhythm of various musical instruments from the orchestra. They continued dancing until Charles reluctantly had to release Draco's body so they could change partners.
Harry crushed Draco's lips all over, and then his tongue explored Draco's mouth, their tongues interlocking hot and wet. Harry's lips moved against Draco's mercilessly. The man was aroused but still covered in tenderness, and for a moment, Draco lost in that incredible kiss, until then he felt Harry's hard cock pressed against his thigh.
Draco smiled as he listened to Natalie's grunts, not typical of a royal concubine at all. Maybe it was because Natalie was not a woman who was born into a noble family. No matter how hard Natalie applied all the royal rules, she would still broke sometimes.
"I love you, sweetheart." Harry whispered, remaining buried deep inside his baby.
"Will that really affect my credibility as an Alpha?"
"It's delicious, though," Dion commented.
And it didn't take long for the guards to start fighting with the session numbers they had gotten. Mistakenly, Draco didn't feel bored or tired in the slightest. Hearing the sound of clashing swords and seeing the swords gleam in the sunlight, he felt increasingly impatient to see who would win.
"Then what about you?" Draco asked, a little panicked.
"Draco, don't be stubborn. Do you think, by not having children, you can keep your position?"
"Oh, but I haven't even greeted her yet," Draco sounded guilty.
Harry is stunned, but then he chuckles and decides to sit in the chair next to Draco's bed. "I repeat, don't you ever fall for that young doctor, he must be from a conventional family, and I'm sure his moral education and his family will not tolerate you, the person Harry Potter has tarnis—"
she thinks.
(See the end of the chapter for
"God Ares? You're Ares, right?" The Satyr spoke.
"What is it, Arabelle? What do you want to ask?" Draco blinked.
Annoyed, Draco walked over to Harry and stood in front of him. The man still didn't look at him. "I have a life, I have a family, I have a job, and you must send me back."
"We're not like you and your
With a hardened face, Draco resumed his steps towards his horse carriage.
Harry leaned against the wall and squeezed his throbbing forehead, his chest aching and hurting. So, this feels like... Seeing Draco in pain almost made him explode in distress, and it was all because his enemies were about to harm him.
Draco's eyes widened. "Are you pregnant?"
"If you're sick, you don't have to force yourself to come here. You just need to send a letter. I'll definitely accept it."
But then Doctor Jason's words provoked him. He wasn't Potter's whore! "I'm not Potter's whore!" Draco shouted his rebuttal loudly.
After making sure Draco wouldn't switch sleeping positions again, he instantly moved his feet towards a large cupboard at the end of the room. He opened the wooden cupboard engraved with gold ornaments. His hand reached out for one of the neatly arranged scarves in the closet.
"So soon? Not waiting for the morning?"
"We were worried that the place might bear a curse on you. That means six snakebites at once. Even snake charmers say it doesn't make sense." She reasoned.
"What happened?"
Cedric always followed Draco's footsteps with the same happy face as Draco. Cedric felt happy because he managed to make Draco happy.
Before things got complicated.
"I'd better use the cloak," Draco muttered as he reached out his hand to grab Harry's flimsy robe, which was lying helplessly on the ground.
Draco looked at him expressionlessly, even though he was actually feeling a little apprehensive. The Omega, Harry's soulmate, has already left this pack for one year due to the tragic accident that happened at the time. All of this, this stupid and unreasonable offer—supplication—would never have happened if the soulmate was alive and healthy—literally.
"…Ares?" his red lips whispered, unable to believe what he saw in front of him right now.
"Should I report it to Master and call a doctor?" asked the maid, sounding worried.
The Nymphs of about three people always accompanied Draco. They were always alert and agreed to Draco's requests, but they never spoke. They react by nodding and communicating with each other with a glance.
I should have written the next chapter of Wrong Passion, but I couldn't resist. My fingers itching to post a new story. I'm so sorry for those of my lovely people who are waiting for the next chapter of Wrong Passion. I'm still working on it. I don't know when I will be able to update ( Ĭ ^ Ĭ )
"Ah yes, before that, I would like to introduce my name, I—"
That's how Draco felt. The feeling made Draco tighten his grip on Cedric's strong hand. Abruptly, Cedric's stopped. A frown crossed Draco's face when he saw the spot where the other had stopped.
Draco swallowed hard when he heard the price. Who wants to buy a guitar for 250 Pounds Sterling? "Is there anything less than 100 Pounds Sterling?" Draco asked.
Draco took his lunch with a quick move and ran to the room where Professor Trelawney was teaching. He had to hurry before Icarus killed Harry. Before, Draco also ran out of breath because Harry tried to connect himself with him.
Without saying anything, Harry slipped his hand between the girl's thigh and back to carry her in bridal style.
Draco stopped his lunch and looked at her seriously. The red-haired girl frowned. "Good. You like him?" asked Draco.
The window was covered with thick glass and was filled with substantial iron trellis. After all, Draco had just realized that he was on the second floor. Even if he could open the window, he had to find a way to safely off the second floor.
A waiter came, and Harry ordered again in fluent French. When the appetizer arrived, Draco was blown away by the presentation. Harry explained that it was
"Huh? Why are you playing romantically with humans until you marry them? Just sleep until you get bored and then leave like you do your other human lovers!" snapped Aphrodite emotionally.
Four.
Someone suggested that I should write about Harry's past when he first met Draco in Lucius's study room, where I said that Draco's past appearance was a nerdy. Yes, I'll try to include their pasts in the future chapter.
"In this room?"
Draco made his way to the courtyard of Malfoy Manor with hasty steps, where his carriage was waiting for his return. Before Draco got into the carriage, Draco gripped the glass bottle his father had given him.
He was eager to get down on the dance floor and join the noble couples. However, the young man's desire immediately evaporated when he saw his husband, who was now standing beside him, emitting an aura of boredom.
Uh oh... Finally Draco was able to escape. What do you think? Is that a good decision or vice versa? Let me know in the comment! 💞
The shop owner's face changed, and he let out a long breath as if his expectations were crumbling for a wealthy customer. "It's over here," the man said, leading Draco to a different spot. "It's 80 Pounds Sterling."
Draco embroidered with such skill and detail. In just an instant, the young man had already managed to finish his embroidery. Now, the soft beige cotton cloth has been decorated with a blue tulip flower arrangement which is very soothing to the eyes.
“You need my cock inside you, don’t you? After going through a few orgasms, you're still able to harden, huh? How pervert.” Harry purred, content patience settling on his face.
Draco was stunned angrily at Harry's abuse of him. How much he costs? Hah! Does he think he's a king who can buy anything he wants? This evil man must be taught that even though many bend their knees at his feet and beg to have him, someone was unwilling to be touched by him.
"Think about it, Draco. Your position—"
Draco glanced slightly at the mirror, not interested in Daphne's makeup at first, but couldn't help but hold his gaze a little longer. This time he's wearing a black suit. Draco's long blonde hair was lifted in ponytails, showing off his ears. Overall, the appearance looks so elegant and classy. Daphne is excellent at making his appearance change drastically like this.
Not that Draco hoped to be married, the problem was that he was already at Olympus. He can't get out of there and needs someone to protect him, at least until he can protect himself. However, he doesn't know when it could happen because he couldn't even run properly when chased by a wolf.
Draco had to survive, even though now that was doubtful because Draco was in the hands of a very cruel Hyde. Harry will do everything he can to get Draco back, safe, and alive.
Draco woke in the morning to a light shuffling sound and a sizable pain radiating from his tailbone. Harry was standing next to the bed, slowly dressing in his expensive clothes. Draco groaned in bed, making Harry realize that the blonde had awakened from his deep sleep.
Draco immediately frowned in fear. Hermione had probably passed his request to Ron for help, and Ron told Harry about it.
Troya was uncomfortable with all of Hector's attention. Even though the man claimed to think of Troya as his younger brother, he knew that Hector's concern was not genuine because he also has an older brother, and they all never care when Troya was sick or injured.
No! Was Draco going to end up like that too?
"You sound confident," Draco felt his voice tremble slightly. He felt the War God's hair on his neck. They shouldn't sleep together so soon.
While running, Draco occasionally looked back to see if the werewolf were still chasing him. And, of course, he's still after Draco. Draco could also see Harry, who was standing at the end of the road. He saw the werewolf too. As the werewolf gets close to Harry, he makes a net of fire. The werewolf kept running, and the moment he broke through the net of fire, he disappeared.
"Then you have to stop acting like that, understand? If you repeat what you did like before in the garden, staring at Greyson with your cute, innocent face again, Daddy will really show Greyson who has the right of you. This is your first warning, understand?"
