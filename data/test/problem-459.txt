“Sorry to disturb you, sir,” Reynolds cut in, “Just routine, checking in after the first three days.”
“If it’s got you messed up, then I’ll give you my advice. Can’t promise it’ll be good, necessarily, but…” Ron shrugged, took a sip of beer.
When he was through, he took another look at himself. He’d done pretty neat work of it, in his opinion. And looking at his reflection, he realized that, for the first time in a long time, he felt a little more like himself.
“Oh, it’s you.” Harry took a breath to calm himself. He was jumpy tonight. “Can’t sleep?” he guessed.
He’d slipped onto the floor, back pressed against the desk. He felt movement beside him, and pulled his arms up to shield himself.
They sat in silence for a long while, just drinking, before Malfoy finally slammed the bottle down on the table. “You ever used a Cruciatus Curse, Harry?”
“Of course.” Corbyn offered Potter an officious smile from thin lips. “How would you rate your level of satisfaction with the program so far?”
Malfoy simply raised an eyebrow in response, but he rose and followed Harry back up the stairs. Harry climbed them slower this time, since Malfoy was obviously in pain. Once they’d made it to the second floor, he turned to the first room on the left.
Draco rolled his eyes. “How about we pinkie swear, instead? Since we’re apparently in primary school now.”
Potter was still looking up at him, one hand in his pocket, the other hand hovering over Draco’s socked foot.
Harry knew what it felt like, to be alone in the world, to truly believe no one cared about your well-being. He remembered how happy he’d been to finally meet Hagrid. What had Hagrid
Malfoy tilted his head to the side, regarding Harry as if still trying to tell if he were serious. “I’ll pass on the hug, thanks,” he said. “But if you wanted to blow me, I miss that, too.”
Once he climbed the stairs, the couch began to look very inviting, so he laid down, still wearing his prison clothes and Potter’s jumper over them. He should return it, he realized, and it was his last thought before he drifted off to sleep.
Harry bit his lip, wondering if it was the loneliness that bothered him. He knew well enough it wasn’t fun, being alone with your thoughts. “You could have the couch, if you like.”
“Whatever you’re about to say next, it had better be ‘We’re very sorry we wasted your time, have a lovely day,’” Harry interrupted.
And then the searing pain hit him, running up his arms and into his chest, squeezing at his heart, like fingers of liquid fire. Draco’s whole body shook, his fingers squeezed tighter, as fireworks of agony exploded behind his eyes.
Harry’s quiet voice was only one of many, swirling inside Draco’s head, and it was lost like a drop in an ocean, slipping through Draco’s fingers as he tried to hold onto it.
to be treated like garbage. Even if you did deserve everything that happened to you, it’s pointless, anyway. It’s not going to change anything, and it’s never going to make you a better person. It’s never going to make the world less of a hellhole.”
Draco watched him leave, and then sank to the floor again, eyes stinging, dry sobs wracking his chest. He struggled to take a shaky breath, unable to cry. It seemed he’d finally spent his tears, leaving a hollow, aching emptiness behind.
Draco felt that soft, warm feeling swelling in his heart again, rising in his throat, and swallowed it. “Hey, yourself.”
“It’s alright,” Malfoy drawled. “I’ll just go back to my cozy little cell, get some rest.” He turned to the heavyset Auror next to him. “Say, do you think I could have a bottle of wine delivered? This weekend is promising to be terribly more boring than expected—“
Potter ran a hand through his hair, turned the tub off with a wave of his wand. “It doesn’t matter what I tell you. You have to forgive yourself.”
“I know, I know, but I couldn’t stop it before it started, so I’m doing my best from the inside out, placing prisoners in the best environments I can, gathering evidence that the whole thing is a loathsome, money-grubbing sham.”
Draco shook his head, dropped it into his hands. “It’s not you. Like I said, you’ve been...absurdly nice.”
“Okay.” Potter removed his wand from his pocket slowly, but didn’t raise it, instead holding it in his lap. “Start with the wrist, then? I’m just going to use the simplest healing spell I know.”
I don't think Rowling has a lot of magic tech in her books, from what I remember, but it's one of my favorite concepts, so I made the heater sort of science fantasy. (That's one of the reasons I like writing fanfiction, you can make up whatever you want and have it exist within the world. It's amazing.)
Thanks to everyone who left comments on the last one! You guys are so nice and really encouraging me to keep writing. Thank you, sincerely.
Potter slipped off the couch to sit on the floor beside him. “It’s okay, you know, we can wait...we can just sit here and complain about the weather, if you like…”
There was nothing, really, to say. And telling Potter about the things he’d done, about what a slime he really was, would just make Potter hate him more.
Hey guys, sorry this one's kind of short and not much happens. I wanted to post something though. <3
Potter shut the door and turned round. Draco could feel Potter staring at him; he fixed his gaze on the floor again. Looking at his hands, he realized he was shaking, harder than normal. His whole body was. He wrapped his arms around himself. The cuts on his chest stung beneath them.
“Oy,” said Harry, as Malfoy doubled over, coughing. Sure, he and Draco were far from friends, but Malfoy was bound with what looked like the heaviest chains Azkaban could afford. Surely there was no need to be hitting him?
“I’ll go back to ‘keeping the estate,’ then,” Harry said, hoisting the empty bottle in his hand. “Enjoy my booze, you old creep.”
“I mean, they never tried to kill me, or torture me, so…” Potter ran a hand through his hair, finally abandoning his fork to stare into his coffee.
“Cleaning out my liquor cabinet, more like…” Harry muttered. “Would you stop winding that damn thing? Keeps me awake.”
It was then that Draco realized he had yet to inquire about Kreacher. “Oh, I forgot to mention, Potter,” he said, unsure how to even broach the subject, “You...you do know you have a deranged house elf living in your basement, right?”
Ron chuckled some more, and then his smile faded into something almost sad. “He did seem concerned though, honestly. It was...weird.”
“I’m cleaning it,” Potter retorted, holding gently onto Draco’s heel. “It hurts ‘cause the germs are dying.”
“Hello?” Draco asked. He couldn’t see anyone else in the dim basement, all he could hear was the quiet croaking voice, seemingly muttering to itself.
“He didn’t deserve to be tortured,” Harry retorted, the vicious cuts on Draco burned into his brain. “If you knew the stuff they did to him…”
Malfoy looked up at him, his eyes half shut. “If you really want to help me, just put me out of my misery.”
When he looked up, Malfoy was regarding him carefully. “You know the feeling, don’t you? You just don’t hate me enough.” He looked away. “If you knew me better, you would.”
If Potter wanted to do any kicking, he’d have to locate his shoes first, Draco thought with a smirk, eyeing the piles of rubbish and clutter littering the hallway. What
Ron looked back down at his shoes, and when he spoke, it was almost in a whisper. “Take care of him for me, will ya?”
“I’m just being honest.” He ran his hand through his hair, looked away. “You want some coffee, since we’re apparently staying up all night?”
Harry realized he was openly staring, and focused his attention back on his drink. Draco was...strangely distracting, sometimes. He shook the thought out of his head.
“What do you want me to do, Malfoy? Threaten you? We’re going to be living together for the foreseeable future, can’t we just be civil?”
Harry felt his eyes prickling again. Fighting sounded...exhausting. Hadn't he done enough of it, for one lifetime? He blinked, trying to get his eyes to stop stinging. “I don’t feel brave,” he said, quietly. “I just feel tired.”
Potter lowered his mug, looking almost offended. “It’s my house, I’m not going to make you sleep on the floor.”
What was he thinking? Draco reminded himself. Potter was a Gryffindor, he’d probably forget he possessed a wand at all and just punch Draco in the face. Or kick him. Potter’s line from the front doorstep floated back into his head.
Potter’s expression fell, instead. He stared at the floor for a minute and then a smile spread across his face. “I might be a stereotypical dumb jock,” he said, “But I know one Gryffindor who’s not.”
“I’m afraid they’re necessary,” Corbyn said, holding up a parchment self-importantly. “How would you rate the prisoner’s behavior, on a scale of Outstanding to Dreadful? This will go on his permanent record, and be considered upon his opportunity for parole.”
“...And so anyway, they gave me the paperwork and asked me to track you down. And I knew you’d refuse, but…” Now it was Hermione’s turn to look guilty. “Draco Malfoy had just come across my desk, and I...well, he was just a kid when he committed his crimes, Harry. I still remembered his little eleven-year-old face underneath the sorting hat, I still remembered how scared and hollow he’d looked at Malfoy Manor, I still remembered how he hadn’t identified us, and I just...I couldn’t let him get hurt.”
Draco shook his head, and took a careful bite. The chicken was over-cooked, and the vegetables were almost raw, but it really wasn’t too bad.
“No. Like I said, I’m not overly fond of anything in this house. Although you did probably muck up the resale value a bit.”
Draco tugged the door open—it stuck, and hurt his arm...he was pretty sure that elbow was sprained, but that was a problem for another day—and descended the chilly, cement steps down to the basement. It was filthy, cluttered with crates and tapestries and a disturbing number of taxidermied house elf heads, all hung with cobwebs and coated with dust. Draco began to pick his way through the piles of junk--tapestries, old dish-ware, objects that most certainly looked cursed--when he heard it.
Harry narrowed his eyes, searching Malfoy’s face but finding nothing. “There’s more to it than that.”
Draco was silent. He dropped his hands from his face; a tear escaped from his lashes and rolled down his cheek. He wiped his eyes, swore. “I don’t even have a right to cry. I’m not the one who got hurt.”
Potter looked incredibly worn out, and Draco didn’t blame him. Too much healing was taxing on anyone, and the marks from the chains had been abnormally difficult to get rid of. Potter wiped his palm on his jeans again, rubbed his shoulders with a sigh, and leaned forward, wand raised towards the bruises around Draco’s neck.
“I don’t have any interest in making threats,” Harry said, his voice still quiet. “But I won’t live with someone who treats me like garbage. I’ve been there and done that, believe me. And we both know it's me or Azkaban.”
When Harry reached the top of the stairs, he stopped short, staring around his living room. The room was...clean. The trash, the bottles, all gone, the clothes, piled in a hamper, the books, stacked, the dust and cobwebs, cleared…
“I’m not gonna touch you, don’t worry, I’m not gonna touch you. But I’m here, if you need something to hold onto.”
“Probably has a killer case of PTSD, after Azkaban,” Ron said. He raised his beer sarcastically. “I’ll drink to that,” he muttered, taking a long drink.
In a way, he felt strangely responsible for Potter. Like it or not, he’d been dumped into the man’s lap, and into the center of his storm. And even though Draco knew he could never make a very good friend--or even a sorry excuse for one--he was still going to give it his best shot.
“What did they do?” Draco asked, before realizing it had probably been a faux pas, asking about Potter’s childhood trauma out of the blue like that. He certainly didn’t want to talk about his own, while hungover and trying to eat.
He hadn’t suspected he was opening such a messy can of worms, suggesting he and Draco were friends. But considering Draco didn’t have any, these days, perhaps Harry ought to have expected it, in hindsight. And he had to admit, he felt a little strange himself, calling his old enemy a friend. But Draco looked like he could use one.
As they headed back up the stairs, Malfoy tripped, near the top. Harry reached out to steady him, and Draco leaned back against his arms, chuckling slightly.
Harry chuckled softly and flopped down on the couch next to her, already feeling strangely calm. It was nice, so nice, seeing her again. Then he remembered the conversation he needed to have, and his nerves flooded back.
So much a n g s t in this one. Harry has been repressing his issues for a long time in this fic, and Draco is still trying to figure out how to be a friend, so it's kind of slow going.
Right. Draco had forgotten about that. He’d been too invested in their conversation about Potter; he’d neglected to even come up with a lie. But there was no way he could tell the truth--Potter would just send him back to Azkaban.
Draco sighed tiredly. “And I can’t even make pancakes without scorching them to a crisp, apparently.”
They sat there, watching the fire until it settled into glowing embers, and cold blue light began to steal in through the windows.
Draco Malfoy was curled up on the floor next to him. Draco Malfoy, the one who had tormented him and his friends during their school years, who had tried to kill Dumbledore, who had become a Death Eater,
That had been Harry’s opinion, as well, from what little he’d known of them. “Would you want to try and track Goyle down? Might be nice, to see a familiar face.”
“It’s like he blames himself for...everything. Like every single thing Voldemort did was his own personal fault.” Harry dropped his head into his hands. “Sorry to bother you with this, I doubt you care, but Hermione seemed to think you’d have advice, and...well, if you do, I’m sure it’s worth hearing,” he finished, staring at the Burrow’s stained, well-worn carpet.
“Well, you’re getting one. It doesn’t help, roughing yourself up in your head, so you’re ready the next time someone decides to have a go at you. It doesn’t work like that. Trust me, I’ve tried it.”
Potter hesitated, and finally shook his head. “Alright, fine. They were awful.” He looked back up at Draco. “Now can we stop throwing a pity party about my sad excuse for a childhood?”
“It’s a spit pact,” Potter said, as if it were something everyone did. “Me and Ron used to do it. C’mon, it’s not official until it’s a spit pact.” He was smiling now, looking amused.
Harry rubbed a hand over his aching shoulders. Healing Draco had taken more out of him than he’d like to admit, but at the same time, he felt as if a weight had been lifted. The marks on Draco, his small, half-hidden winces here and there, had been eating at the back of Harry’s mind since Draco had arrived in his custody. Maybe it was his ‘Saving People Thing,’ as Hermione would have said. But whatever the reason, Harry felt a little closer to Draco, now. Maybe it was just their situation, their forced proximity to one another, or maybe it had been being that close to Draco, hearing his breath slowly steady as Harry methodically healed him. He thought of the hand Draco had offered him, pulling him to his feet, and bit his lip.
He’d leaned down closer to whisper in Draco’s ear. Draco felt a shiver run down his spine, at the memory.
He didn’t feel like himself. He didn’t feel like anyone. He certainly didn’t feel like Harry Potter. And he was going to drink until he forgot that damn name, forgot he was the Savior of the Wizarding World. Until he felt numb again.
His fire had died hours ago, and he had chills rising on his arms, but at least the house wasn’t ice cold anymore, thanks to Malfoy. He got up to get a glass of water, picking his well-worn path through take-out boxes and empty bottles in the pitch-black room. As he passed the staircase to the upstairs, he glimpsed a soft light coming down the hall.
“Thank you for fixing my heater, cause I didn’t have the foggiest notion of what I was doing,” Harry admitted, “But you really didn’t have to clean up after me. It’s my fault I let it get this way.”
“...Safe, you’re okay, you’re at number 12 Grimmauld Place in London, your name is Draco Lucius Malfoy, you’re safe, it’s three pm on a Sunday, December second, you’re okay…”
Harry swallowed, hard, unable to speak. He’d never seen Malfoy show this much raw emotion before. The closest he’d ever seen was in the bathroom in sixth year, but this time, he knew Harry could see him, and it was
“If you’d activated the curse at all, it would glow, apparently, but otherwise it’s not noticeable. It’s not supposed to trouble you, just Draco.” Hermione sounded disgusted.
Harry swallowed, chose his words carefully. “Because...when I see someone in a bad situation, I imagine how I would feel, if it were me. And it makes me want to help.”
“Well, eventually, when I was a teenager. When I was a kid, they used to lock me in this broom cupboard under the stairs--you don’t wanna hear me go on about it,” he finished hurriedly, taking a large bite of bacon.
Draco straightened up and turned around, holding an apple in both hands as if it were some priceless and highly fragile museum artifact. “Can I…?”
“I think you have a right to be wary. I think I’d be terrified, if I were you. And, well…” Potter cleared his throat, apparently choosing his words. “I think that’s why you didn’t want me working any kind of spell on you, in the beginning. But I think if I pulled my wand out, right now, and threatened you with it, you’d just stare straight back at me--probably dare me to do it. You haven’t backed down from a fight since you got here.”
“Mrs. Weasley knits me jumpers for Christmas sometimes, though.” Potter wore a fond smile. “Can’t say they’re fashionable, but...they’re probably my favorite thing I own.”
“What are you looking at?” Harry all but snapped. He was already sick of having Malfoy in his house, and it hadn’t even been an hour.
“Sounds like quality entertainment to me.” Malfoy swirled his remaining coffee in mock contemplation. “So, Ginny. Wonder who she’s with now?”
Malfoy let out a long breath, leaned his head back against the couch cushions, although his arms stayed raised. Slowly, slowly, he lowered them. “What the hell, Potter.”
Potter was just a stupid Gryffindor, how was he so perceptive? How had Draco let him get the upper hand like that? He needed more sleep, Draco decided, but sleep was still elusive.
Draco was crying harder now, staring at the fire. He let the tears roll down his face, his hands in his lap.
Harry was lying on his back on the floor in front of the fireplace, rolling an empty bottle between his palms. He was starting to suspect the sunrise would find him in the same position, still wide awake. It was just one of those nights. And the conversations he’d had with Malfoy were still turning in the back of his mind.
I was considering a more plot-heavy, suspenseful version, but honestly I just kind of want to write about the relationships developing and stuff, and I like the sort of quiet, intimate tone I've created and I want to keep it.
“Go on then,” Draco said, with a bravado he did not feel. “If you’re bitter, why don’t you do something about it?”
“Still hurts,” Harry muttered. “When you start realizing all the marks life’s left on you.” He looked back at Draco, after a moment, and was surprised to find Draco staring straight back at him.
“It’s alright. I’m just glad we’re both here now. Ron and I, and all the Weasleys, we’ve been worried.”
Kreacher bowed, almost falling off the chair again. “Of course, of course, whatever the master wishes.”
But Malfoy simply ignored his remark. “Maybe we should relight the fire, give her a floo call. If you gave her a few Knuts, she’d probably clean your filthy house for you, too. She is a Weasley, after all.”
Draco stared at the marks in the mirror, at the faded Dark Mark scar on his arm. He remembered Corbyn’s next words, and his stomach twisted again.
I changed the rating on this to mature just to be on the safe side, this chapter gets a little raunchy (and I think I might end up writing some sexy scenes later on, no promises though. I’m bad at it and need practice.)
Last chapter was a little crap--not trying to be disparaging about my writing, but usually my scenes have more direction than that. Anyway, hopefully this one came out better. Love you all, thanks for all the encouragement <3
Hermione gave him a soft smile, seeming to understand. “Of course, Draco. Let me fill you both in on what I’ve picked up on the curse--it’s not much, unfortunately--and then you two can have some privacy, alright? Now, pay attention, Harry--are you drunk?”
Harry rolled his eyes at the both of them. “It’s the most comfortable thing I own, I told you, I’m not throwing out my favorite jumper just cause it isn’t fashionable, it’s not like I go anywhere--”
“Like I told him, door’s always open, if he wants to drag his arse over.”  There was a strange, pained look on Ron’s face. He turned to leave.
Draco wet his lips, and nodded, feeling as if he were diving underwater. Something about Potter taking his sock off, touching an injury, felt very intimate. And giving someone else his trust felt alien, and wrong, like a shirt he hadn’t worn in a while, that had become too tight around the chest. Draco breathed shortly and deliberately, as if he were taking sips of water.
He hadn’t even laid eyes on her since almost four years ago, when they’d been dragged past each other through some Ministry hallway, reaching for each other and shouting ‘I love you’s as the Aurors pulled them away.
“Slow down,” Harry said, standing and reaching for the whiskey. They stood there for a moment, both of them holding onto the bottle. Malfoy finally relinquished his grip.
There was Kreacher, standing on a chair to wind the grandfather clock in the hall, a bottle of Harry’s liquor clutched in the other bony hand.
They stayed like that for a moment, fingers linked, looking at each other. Draco flushed, pulling his hand away. He didn’t want to let on how nice it felt, having any kind of contact with another person. Even just linking fingers was strangely calming. He remembered the offer of a hug Potter had made the day before, and wondered once again if he’d been serious. Knowing Potter, the cheesy bastard, he probably had been.
That was all Draco had wanted, when they’d first met. And sure, he’d been trying to climb the social ladder, get close to the famous Boy Who Lived. But Potter’s rejection had still stung.
They stared at each other for a moment. The kitchen suddenly felt very small, and very quiet. Draco’s foot was throbbing. The concern in Potter’s eyes was doing that funny thing to his throat again. He swallowed, hard.
Hermione waved a hand. “You’re the Chosen One, you automatically got the first pick of them all. For the publicity stunt, if nothing else.”
Knowledge was power, and reading and note-taking was far more comforting than Draco would ever have expected, back in school.
Potter just gave him a deadpan stare in reply to Draco’s attempt at a cutting remark. “That’s the plan,” he said finally, and then turned for the door.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief at that; at least Narcissa was safe. He couldn’t wait to tell Malfoy. He hoped Malfoy would believe that Hermione really did have the best of intentions, that Narcissa really was safe with her.
Draco considered. He’d really rather get it over with, and not have to work up his nerve again. And now that everything else was healed, the bruises around his neck felt even heavier, making it hard to breathe. But he felt like it was asking for too much.
And apparently, if what Draco had heard as he was coming downstairs was correct, it had been Hermione who placed him with Potter. So Potter had been telling him the truth, about never wanting this in the first place. But despite that, Potter had still taken care of him.
Potter approached Draco, giving him a dark look, and then reached abruptly upwards towards his face.
“Better than whatever slop they’re serving in Azkaban, I’ll give it that.” He looked back up at Harry. “Thanks, uh, for the food. And the jumper. You know you don’t have to do any of this, right?”
Hermione stood, and then stopped in her tracks at Malfoy’s small flinch. “Of course, Draco. It’s water under the bridge. And call me Hermione, please.”
He knew Hermione wouldn’t be pleased about any of this, and he didn’t need the situation worsening by her thinking
Surely, if Potter wanted to use magic to hurt him, he would have by now. And even if he changed his mind, he didn’t need Draco’s permission.
Draco gave him a short, sarcastic laugh. “Spoken like the Savior of the Wizarding World. Maybe the world doesn’t need you, but you don’t think your friends do?”
Well we finally know what Corbyn did to Draco now, which I think some of you guessed, and Harry gets a closer look at Draco's guilt. And then...Draco gets overwhelmed and turns back to his old ways for a minute. Like everyone says, recovery ain't linear.
“I’m just here to fix the heater, then I’ll be going,” Draco said, pushing past the elf. He could almost feel Kreacher’s malevolent gaze burning into his back as he squeezed his way to the back of the room, where the heater was clunking ineffectually. He’d found a screwdriver under the sink—with no wand, he’d have to do this the Muggle way—and now he opened the panel in the back, rolled up his sleeves, and got to work.
Draco passed the apple back and forth from hand to hand, considering. “We hung around together. They backed me up. We had a laugh, now and then.”
Harry shrugged and took a bite of toast. “Just a thought. Have you reconsidered that at all? Me healing you, since you can’t work magic?”
Harry had no idea what to do for Draco to make him feel any better, let alone what to say. No matter how stubbornly Harry tried, he couldn’t seem to change Draco’s mind about himself. Harry supposed it would take time, but still…
But even if he’d been lost in the midst of the worst kind of nightmare, Malfoy’s reaction had been…dramatic. Harry didn’t want to think about what Malfoy had woken up to in the past, to have
Malfoy was shivering, Harry realized. Harry had become accustomed to it, but the house was freezing, and he still couldn’t make the damn heater work.
“Don’t mention it.” Potter took his glasses off to rub his eyes, looking even more exhausted now. “I need a drink.”
Draco looked up at him. “You’re overpaying,” he said flatly, trying not to stare at Potter’s eyes. They were so green, in the soft morning light spilling through the basement window.
Draco shook his head. “It tried to kill him from afar--I almost killed students. I let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. I followed his orders, I took the mark. I
Malfoy was staring down, his eyes far away. “Your memories…they were awful things that happened to you. But mine...I built them myself. They were all my choices. My mistakes.”
“Well, Draco,” she continued, “I'll keep looking into it, and I’ll send you some books over, if you’d like to research it on your end, too.”
Most of his injuries were healing by now, bruises fading. And he was lucky, he reminded himself, that Potter hadn’t given him any more. Draco rolled his wrist gingerly, even though he knew it would just make it worse. The cuts on his chest burned.
“So don’t worry,” Malfoy continued, giving him a sarcastic smile and throwing his arms wide. “You’ve got me for as long as you want me.”
Harry woke slowly, his head pounding. It took him a moment to recall where he was. He’d drank himself asleep at his kitchen table last night, apparently.
Draco pulled back, but the elf was surprisingly strong for his size, and simply yanked the arm closer to his face.
“These are old marks, very old, yes. Very old, when the world was new, and the blood was clean. Kreacher has heard of such things, Kreacher has seen…” The elf was making even less sense than he had before, somehow.
“So you decided to, what, alphabetize the Black family library?” There seemed to be more books stacked around Malfoy than there were on the shelves.
He took a deep breath, hoping he wasn’t about to piss Ron off even more, and pushed the words out of his mouth. “He’s really in a bad way, you know. Your friend.”
Anyway, so so sorry about the wait y'all, I've fallen down a depression hole and I'm still not quite out of it. I didn't really have it in me to even do my dishes for week and a half, let alone be creative. But writing this was nice, I'm going to try and write some more. Already have the next chapter planned. Anyway, hope you enjoy this one, it's mostly angst. Hopefully it doesn't suck, my brain still ain't functioning too great.
“Nice, to me, since I got here. And I’m too much of a coward to even let you heal me. I didn’t used to be that way--I mean, having a wand raised at me made me wary, for good reason, but I could at least
“Hermione, I...I need to tell you something. And I need you to promise to let me explain the whole situation, and not judge me until I’m through, alright?”
Draco struggled to keep up in the chains, picking his way through the filthy living room. Take out boxes, open books, empty coffee mugs and muggle clothing were all piled around the room, along with an impressive collection of empty potions bottles in the corner, among empty bottles with labels Draco didn’t recognize, but assumed were some type of Muggle sprits. Seems the Chosen One had picked up a habit in the post-war years. Not that Draco could blame him. He would have too, if he could.
Draco startled, hard, and raised his head. The tub was overflowing, water beginning to touch his toes. He couldn’t summon a response.
Corbyn finally looked back at Potter, casual once again. “I left the Malfoy boy a little gift, when we parted ways.” He smirked. “It’s worth seeing, I promise.” With that, he turned away, walking down the front steps and Disapparating with a sharp crack.
The things Draco had said about himself were haunting Harry’s mind. The remarks about wanting to die, about being weak, pathetic, about deserving the things that had happened to him.
Potter rolled over on the floor with a quiet groan, and slowly sat up, rubbing the back of his head.
Draco blinked back his tears, swallowed hard, wishing his stomach would steady. “Nothing.” He didn’t feel like letting Potter in, not again. And anyway, it would just make Potter pity him more, and Draco knew he didn’t deserve it.
“I told you,” Draco said, opening the fridge. “I don’t do anything I can’t do well…” He trailed off, staring into the fridge.
“My ‘situation’ makes you want to help me? I’d imagine you’d find it amusing. It’s sort of poetic justice, isn’t it?”
“What are you gonna do about it, Malfoy the Maid?” Harry said, a half smile tugging at his lips. He’d started to enjoy bantering with Malfoy, over the past couple of days.
Malfoy picked the sandwich up, turned it over. “That’s cause I haven’t.” He chuckled to himself, bitterly. “Yeah, I know, poor little rich boy, had to go a couple days without eating.”
“Don’t pretend like you care, Potter,” Malfoy muttered, and bit into the sandwich, chewing carefully.
So now, he was in the uncomfortable position of knowing that he needed to apologize, but also knowing his mouth could never form the words before he choked on his pride.
It was Ron who finally broke the silence. “So, you...wanted to talk to me about Malfoy?” he asked incredulously.
Malfoy gripped the spatula tighter, ignoring the batter as it popped and bubbled behind him. He was silent for so long, Harry had started to accept he wasn’t getting an answer. But then, Malfoy spoke.
Malfoy leaned back against the counter, ran a shaky finger over the abrasions. “They haven’t. Those chains were...not ordinary. I don’t think they’ll heal at all, on their own.” He looked up at Harry. “And I swear, Potter, please don’t start with your nurse routine again.”
Draco considered, for a moment. Why did Potter assume his friend’s first reaction to him would be anger? He wondered what Potter’s childhood had been like. Potter never talked about the Muggles who raised him, even though Draco was pretty sure he remembered that they had been related to him. And Potter had never had a problem with Muggles, had never looked down on them. They’d raised him for almost seventeen years, so why weren’t they close? He remembered Potter’s words from before,
He wondered if he could ever forgive Draco, and found himself surprised to realize that he already had. Mostly, at least. The amount that Draco had suffered, the weight of his actions obviously hanging on his shoulders...it put his desperate, foolish crimes into perspective.
messed up, after we...lost ya. I probably couldn’t have gotten much worse. So yeah. It helped.” He looked up finally, giving Harry a cheeky grin. “You oughta try it yourself.”
It took him almost an hour, but Potter healed every one of Draco’s injuries from the neck down, besides the cuts on his chest. Even the small ones were gone: the cut on his foot, the ache in his elbow, the bruises on his knuckles. Draco rolled his wrists, enjoying the calm silence, the absence of pain.
” He turned back and picked up the liquor bottle, took a drink, and then poured a little on the rag. He knelt again, and wiped Draco’s foot.
Harry sat on the couch, bouncing his leg and checking his watch so often he was sure it was going backwards.
The grandfather clock in the hall chimed fifteen past, and Hermione jumped. “Oh no, I really need to get going…”
How could Harry not think him weak? Draco recalled his panic attack from earlier—he was no stranger to them, but having one in front of Potter was beyond humiliating, all the same. But instead of mocking him, Potter had actually
held, but Draco was at Potter’s mercy for the foreseeable future, however brief it ended up being. Potter looked like he was barely keeping himself alive at the moment. The years had not been good to the Chosen One, evidently. Briefly, Draco wondered why, before sternly reminding himself he didn’t care.
Anyway, this chapter finally has more Ron! He is so. hard. to. write. Idk why, he just is. I enjoy the challenge though. Hopefully I did okay <3
Potter shrugged again, half-heartedly this time. “I don’t know. He used to give me the creeps, when I was younger. But now, I guess...I guess I can understand living in the past.”
“Didn’t what?” Potter asked, sounding disturbed. “I didn’t do anything, I just put the blanket on you.”
Draco was stepping into the entryway as Potter opened the door, but when Draco saw who was behind it, he stopped short. Corbyn. And Reynolds, that ginger lard who loved kicking him. Reynolds was big, but Corbyn was even taller. They made an intimidating pair, blocking out what little grey, noonday light managed to filter through the clouds.
“They’re on your face.” The words coming out less scathing than he’d intended and more fondly amused.
Draco’s throat felt like it was closing; sucking in the cold air was becoming painful. He could feel his pulse racing in his neck. What was he supposed to say to that?
Potter was in the kitchen, his back turned, stirring something on the stove and humming to himself. There was an open bottle of brown Muggle liquor beside him on the counter. Great. To make matters worse, Potter was drinking again. He’d been calm the last time Draco had seen him intoxicated, hopefully that behavior remained consistent.
When Potter came back from the kitchen, he was holding two mugs. He handed one to Draco. “Here. I put this potion in it--it’s an instant hangover cure.”
“Hi, mum,” Draco said, leaning almost all the way into the fire, wishing he could jump through the flames and hug her.
Draco huffed softly. “Cause that’s how the world works, Potter. In every interaction, there’s always a goal, and a road to achieve it. A victor, and a victim. We’re all just trying to get things from each other. And if you’re not playing, you’re losing.”
So bafflinghaze reminded me on the last chapter that Crabbe died, which I'd forgotten in the moment of writing it. RIP Crabbe (pours butterbeer out on the floor) I feel guilty for smack talking him in the last chapter now, but he was kind of a huge asshole.
Draco shook his head. “These are fine.” In truth, being in Harry Potter’s custody, living in Harry Potter’s house—it was already too much. He didn’t think he could stand wearing Potter’s clothes on top of it. The sweater was different—it had been a seemingly kind gesture, an almost friendly one, and because of that, Draco supposed, he somehow found it comforting. But his prison clothes, despite being a reminder of a place he’d much rather forget, were the only thing that was
“Would I?” Harry asked. He was pretty sure that wasn’t true--what Harry had hated most about the Death Eaters was the way they seemed to
I finally changed the title, the old one just didn't feel right. It's from the song of the same name by the Cars, if you're curious.
Harry reached out, took Draco’s hand where it was sitting on the table, clasped the shaky fingers in his. Draco started to pull away, but he stopped. Eventually, he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s hand, his eyes fixed on the floor.
Harry couldn’t imagine what it would feel like, spending so many years only being touched when people wanted to hurt you, or drag you around. “Do you want a hug?” he offered, before he could stop himself.
“I’m not the best with healing spells, but…” Potter wiped his forehead with his sleeve. “That was a lot harder than I thought it would be.”
Draco took another deep breath, wet his cracked lips. The air was chilly in the absence of the fire, the room quiet, the only sound the rain pattering against the windows.
The elf looked up at Draco with his strange, milky eyes for a few long, uncomfortable seconds, before bowing low. “Kreacher should introduce himself. Kreacher used to serve here, used to serve the Noble Family of Black, before the house was overrun with the filthy blood traitors…” Kreacher trailed off. “Kreacher does not know you. Kreacher knows a bad sort when he sees it, yes, indeed--”
“God, those things are strangling,” she said. “I feel like a Muggle judge. All I’m missing is a powdered wig.” She was wearing a much less official-looking T-shirt and jeans beneath them.
It took him a little over two hours, but Draco managed to get the heater working. He rose and dusted off his hands, feeling the need for another bath already, but too exhausted to even consider it.
Draco fisted his hands. More words began falling from his lips, unbidden. “I was certain you were going to torture me, when I first got here. But now, I really...I don’t think you are. I don’t even think you want to, honestly.” He squeezed his fists tighter. The shakes spread, from his fingers up his arms. “So
hatred. I felt bad for you, Draco. You looked trapped, and—and terrified. You looked like you were dying inside.” Harry paused, seemingly waiting for a response, and then finally spoke again. “Bullies come from everywhere. And they can join any side. And that’s what you were, Draco. A bully. But you’re a lot more than that too. And you were just a damn kid.” Harry huffed in disgust. “This Corbyn guy, he’s the one who should be ashamed of himself. He’s a grown man, and he’s still just a bully.”
Draco’s jaw clenched. He could feel anger coiling inside him, and even though he recognized it as a defense mechanism, he couldn’t stop it. He’d let Potter in too close, and now he felt the urge to push him away again. “Don’t patronize me. I told you before, I don’t want your pity.”
The light was coming from the cracked door of the office. Harry considered peeking in to see what Malfoy was up to, but he didn’t want to ruin any trust he’d managed to build, so instead, he tapped softly on the door before pushing it open.
Draco looked away, cheeks warming as he realized he’d been staring. He’d just been bored, waiting for Potter to be done, he told himself. That was it.
“Wha…” Harry said sleepily, readjusting his glasses and taking another look at…prisoner #6583-9K. As he did, the man looked straight back up at Harry.
Thank you thank you thank you for all the kind comments on the last one! it means so much to me that people are still enjoying this fic.
Harry sat watching the interaction unfold in shock. He’d never in his wildest dreams conceived that Malfoy was even capable of being this polite. Malfoy had been barely anything but cheeky and rude to Harry since he arrived, and Harry quite literally held Malfoy’s life in his hands. But obviously, he reminded himself, Malfoy’s pride wouldn’t matter to him in the slightest when it came to Narcissa. He’d clearly do anything to see her safe; he’d practically bitten Harry’s head off when Harry had so much as mentioned her.
Draco looked down, at the bruises around his own wrists, the raw skin. It still stung, and it hurt every time he moved his hands--along with his neck and ankles. Potter had offered so many times to heal it with magic…but the thought of a wand raised at him still sent shivers down his spine. He sighed heavily, disgusted with himself. How many times had he faced down Aurors, looked them steadily in the eyes as they shoved a wand in his face, spitting threats? Potter had been absurdly nice, why was he still so afraid?
Laying waste to an entire room of Potter’s house had also been stupid, and Draco had been fully ready for a fight when Potter had caught him at it. But Potter had surprised him once again. Draco wasn’t sure what to label that conversation. It hadn’t been a fight, exactly, as hard as Draco had tried to turn it into one. He winced, remembering how many things he’d said he wished he could take back, how much ammunition he’d given Potter to use against him, if he wanted to.
It was 6 am on a Friday when the Aurors knocked on Harry’s door, rousing him from a nightmare wherein he was back at the Dursley’s house, and Vernon was banging furiously on the door of his cupboard.
Potter smiled sardonically, washing down a mouthful of scrambled eggs with coffee. “They did worse, trust me.”
“Yes, she’s doing well, sitting right here…” Hermione’s head disappeared, Draco could make out some muffled chatter, and then, finally, he could see his mother’s face in the flames.
“He was right, for once. You’re the kind of guy to care about anybody who’s hurting, even if they’re your worst enemy.” Ron scratched the back of his neck, staring at the label on the can in his hand. “Can’t believe I’m about to say something this cheesy, but...ah, hell, if you care, Harry, I care too.”
Draco held the bottle up in the glow from the fire, regarding it as it caught the light, head tilted. His eyes were narrowed, shoulders sagging. When he finally answered, his voice was quiet. “Things that happened, but they’re...different. Things that never happened, but the feeling’s the same. Always wake up with the same taste in my mouth, like…” He trailed off, took another drink, swallowed, hard.
“I suppose I’ll postpone slitting my wrists, then,” Draco shot back, as he walked to the bathroom. Squinting into the dusty mirror, he began pulling strands of hair away from his head and cutting. The scissors were a little rusty, but they did the job.
Okay, well I hope you enjoyed, please please leave me a comment, they brighten my day so much <3 If I ever don't reply to them, it's just cause I don't want to be annoying, but I read every one, and they give me the inspiration to keep writing. Love you all <3<3<3
Malfoy was tense again, jaw clenched, shoulders rounded. “You ever consider my mother is none of your business?”
Harry finally broke the silence himself. “Corbyn was...he was misguided. And I doubt he’d ever be able to forgive you, for being associated with the Death Eaters, for being a part of your family--but he shouldn’t have let his hatred make him abuse his power like that. Make him abuse a
Potter took a step towards him, and Draco stepped away, back hitting the wall. A wave of shame washed over him. As much as he despised Corbyn, the man always succeeded in making Draco feel lower than dirt. All the things he’d done, all the screaming he’d sat through, all the murders he’d watched--he could see them reflected in Corbyn’s black eyes.
Draco pressed his hands against his eyes. “I know that. I know I don’t even deserve to feel guilty, I know I’ll never change any of it, no matter how much I suffer, I don’t need you to tell me.”
“Feeling guilty won’t help anyone. It won’t help people like Corbyn, won’t bring anyone back to life, won’t erase any of the pain. It won’t even make you feel better, wishing you could take it back, wishing you’d done something differently. So if you want my advice…” Harry squeezed Draco’s fingers. “Try to move on. It won’t happen overnight, but try. You survived. There were a lot that didn’t. You have a chance, a chance to become someone else. Someone you like better.”
“So,” Draco began cautiously, doing his best not to look nervous, “If you’re not going to send me back to Azkaban, what are you going to do?”
“Hilarious,” Harry replied, and drained the glass. He went to pour another, and then paused. “I’m guessing you don’t want one?”
He could tell Draco was in his own hand-made hell inside his head. And every time Harry tried to comfort him, or give him advice, he felt like he was stumbling around, struggling to perform brain surgery in the dark.
Reynolds thanked Potter awkwardly for his time and then followed his coworker, disappearing into the cold, misty air.
Draco had looked a little reluctant, when he’d headed for the stairs to his room after they’d finished eating. But when Harry had invited Draco to join him for a drink, he’d simply shaken his head. Harry had at least insisted on cleaning the glass from his room, and after a few protestations that he was the one who made the mess in the first place, Draco had let him.
“The master said,” the elf continued muttering, “The master said this was Kreacher’s part of the house, Kreacher does not know what this criminal is doing--”
Harry wet his lips, took a slow, careful breath. “I hated you in school. Because you always seemed like you enjoyed putting other people down, making them miserable. But when you became a Death Eater, that was the first time I started to feel something
“Ah, I see. The idea of having Draco Malfoy as your personal prisoner sounded fine and dandy on paper, but now that you’re looking me in the eyes, you’re getting cold feet.”
“Thanks,” Draco mumbled finally, setting the half-eaten apple on the counter to flip the pancakes. It seemed no matter how enraptured Draco was by a piece of fruit, he couldn’t let his pancakes burn.
“Thank you,” Draco said, sincerely. It was a small comfort, knowing Ron shared Hermione’s sentiments about his mother. He could feel Ron staring at him, and looked up.
Harry bit his lip. He’d anticipated anger, not...whatever this was. Draco sounded as if he were close to tears. “Draco…”
It went back to being six, pulling his robes up to gingerly inspect a skinned knee, his father hauling him off the ground by his collar,
“That he does,” Potter agreed. He looked lost in thought. “There’s got to be some way to break it, especially if I’m involved--like the clothes, with house-elves.”
“If Ron accepted you seeing his sister, you can’t very well be mad at him for marrying your friend.”
Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, a second mug of coffee in his hands, watching Malfoy as he fussed with the stove, muttering something about ‘Muggle contraptions’ intermingled with a number of colorful swears Harry had never heard.
“Let me see that,” Harry demanded, snatching the document from the Auror’s thin fingers. He skimmed it for a moment—prisoner rehabilitation program—prisoner #6583-9K, formerly referred to as Draco Lucius Malfoy—Custody of Harry James Potter, by legal agreement filed with the Wizengamot—He’d read enough. He all but threw the parchment back at the Auror.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, coffee cooling, forgotten on the table. He didn’t want to tell Malfoy he was wrong--Malfoy was talking about his experiences, and he had a right to feel any which way about them. Harry didn’t want to attack his perspective, but it was still a dismal one, and one Harry disagreed with.
Draco heard a muffled voice behind Ron’s head, and then Ron was yanked out of the fireplace and replaced by Hermione. Draco stepped a little closer.
I feel like this chapter sucks but I feel that way about every chapter so who knows. The next one will probably be fluffier cause it's been a hell of a week and I'm in the mood to write something happy.
worth a shot. Ron could be emotionally...well, incompetent at times, but he wasn’t an idiot. If he deigned to give advice on the subject, it would probably be worth hearing. Harry opened and shut his mouth, unsure how to begin.
Draco stared at Potter’s face, rather than focusing on his own arm. His nerves faded, ever so slightly. Potter’s look of concentration was somewhat endearing: he was biting his lower lip, eyes narrowed, glasses slipping down his nose. He raised his other hand to push them back up, and brush his overgrown bangs out of his eyes, tucking them behind his ears.
Potter was sitting on the couch and gazing at the fire, his eyes a million miles away, a long-since cooled cup of coffee in his hands.
“They locked you in your room?” Draco whispered. No wonder Potter thought people would be happier if he weren’t around to muck up their lives.
Draco looked up at him, his eyes going cold. “I told you, Potter, no matter what your intentions are, if you--”
The Auror punched Malfoy in the face and shoved him to his knees on the dry leaves covering Harry’s doormat. “When you get back to Azkaban, we’re going to have a little talk about your continuing attitude problem.”
Harry took the stairs down to the kitchen slowly, feeling gutted. He knew it had to be worse for Draco, but seeing what had happened to him firsthand, hearing yet again how much he hated himself, watching him break down like that--it turned Harry’s stomach. He reached for a bottle, uncorked it against the counter, and raised it halfway to his lips before something caught his eye. He set the bottle down.
“No idea.” He’d both grown and lost weight in the past five years, and by now, Draco didn’t have the slightest clue.
Harry heard a noise in the hallway, and sat up with a start. He rose, and stepped across the room to hover in the doorway.
“Would you stop calling me ‘master,’ at least?” Harry said, for at least the hundredth time. “You’re free, remember?”
on me, more than once. Not many Aurors willing to use unforgivable curses--they get paranoid, superstitious. But Corbyn...Corbyn loved it.” Malfoy spread his shaky fingers out on the table, observing them as they twitched like they belonged to someone else. “And when he used it on me, I could
The Auror crossed his arms and glared childishly, while his skinnier coworker handed the parchment over to Harry, with a quill.
“She’s married to Ron. And I figured she’d be mad at me, too. Besides, they had both tried to help me, too, just like Ginny. But I didn’t want help, back then.” Potter took a deep breath, spat his words out almost painfully. “So no, I don’t think any of them want to see my face.”
The idea of Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, being friends with a former Death Eater was laughable. But Draco didn’t feel like laughing, watching Potter stare into the flames.
Malfoy stared down at the slightly sticky, crumpled packets for a moment, obviously stifling his disgust, and then tore into all four at once and dumped them into the coffee. He took a sip and shut his eyes in contentment. “Perfect.”
Wide-awake, Harry folded his arms. How dare they. How dare the ministry show up at his house—when he’d made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with them—and drag his enemy onto his doorstep? And into his
“Coming,” he shouted, searching the coffee table with a frantic hand for his glasses, sending boxes of takeout and empty Styrofoam cups flying.
“He’s in my custody, I’ll be the judge of that.” Potter was sounding more irritated with every second that passed.
He sank back down onto the couch, wrapping his arms around himself. Just another nightmare. It was already fading, all he could remember was a dark, hooded shape chasing him through a maze-like forest at night as he ran for his life, tripping on roots and snakes. The dream felt like the ghost of a memory, and Harry had a sick taste in the back of his mouth.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. This conversation kept going in the worst directions. Not that Harry had ever been very good at saying the right thing. His number one talent seemed to be putting his foot in his mouth. He distracted himself from the tension that had settled over the room by pouring himself a drink. He sat down at the table with it, and found Malfoy watching him intently.
“A certain brilliant Muggle-born witch named Hermione.” He smiled wider. “If anyone could find something promising in a book, it’d be her.”
“He’s...he’s just feeling awful, and…” Harry struggled to find the words, not wanting to reveal too much without Draco’s permission. “The Aurors, in Azkaban, they did some really awful things to him. And whatever bad ideas he had about himself, between the Aurors and the Dementors, they’re a hundred times worse now, and I just...I have no idea what to do.”
“And you know, anything can become comfortable, if you sit with it long enough." Ron's voice had dropped a little lower, sounding uncharacteristically serious. "I doubt Malfoy even wants to part with his guilt.”
I’ve just been kind of writing what I feel like, and sort of letting the story write itself, but there will be more Harry angst soon. He’s messed up too, but he’s been repressing/ignoring his trauma for a while whereas Draco’s is still fresh. It’s gonna take some digging for him to start opening up, and letting his friends in and all.
Anyway, if you're in the mood for tooth-rotting fluff with a side of Harry angst, dinner is served folks
Harry considered belatedly it had been a rather intimate thing to do, giving Malfoy his own clothes to wear, but it had seemed natural to him at the time. He was just making all this up as he went along, sue him.
“You look like you took a bath,” Potter said, changing the subject. “You want some fresh clothes? I bet my stuff would fit you.”
Potter shook his head, an absentminded, worried hand in his hair. “I’m not going to...remove your clothing without your consent.”
anything to him, he’d been too caught up in their conversation. “You could always toss more of my stuff at the walls, you know.”
Poor Harry, he really tries in this chapter and Draco isn't quite having it, lol. I imagine Draco having very low self-efficacy and a sort of learned helplessness from all the situations he's been stuck in, so trying to convince him he can recover and change is going to be a hard job. Luckily our boy Harry is stubborn as hell.
Malfoy wet his fingers in the sink and flicked water at both the pans he had heated, and then smiled as it sparked and crackled in the oil. “Perfect.”
“If I didn’t want you waving a wand in my face, Potter, what makes you think I want you wielding scissors next to my neck?”
Corbyn was opening his mouth, but Reynolds interrupted him, looking uncomfortable. “Very well, sir. You may answer the questions as fully as you’d like. Finally, would you say this program has improved 6583-9K’s character in any way? Our primary wish is to reform.”
Harry watched him, wishing he could do something. He’d always been rubbish at knowing what to say, and he didn’t think Draco wanted to hear any of it at the moment, anyway. But still, Harry couldn’t just sit there and watch him cry. Tentatively, he reached out a hand, and rested it on Draco’s shoulder, waiting for Draco to pull away. He didn’t. Eventually, ever so slowly, he leaned against it.
And apparently, it really was, as Draco had wound him up seemingly as far as he could go today, and Potter hadn’t even pulled out his wand. He’d just...left.
Malfoy obliged him, slowly pulling out a chair and sitting down. He picked up the package of bologna Harry had set on the table.
Draco shook his head. “He has a right to be furious with me. I--I watched his wife, suffering horribly, watched her
Harry stared down at him, wondering if Malfoy were drunk enough to let him see what Corbyn had put on his chest “Can I...can I see?” he asked, reaching towards the hem of Malfoy’s sweater.
“Thank you, Mrs. Granger. At your earliest convenience, of course.” Malfoy came closer to stand beside the couch, his gaze fixed on the floor. “I hope you’ll accept my deepest apologies for any offenses I may have caused you in the past. If there’s any way I can make it up to you, I sincerely hope you’ll tell me.” He paused, and looked Hermione in the eyes. “I wouldn’t dare ask you to forgive me, but I hope that any grudges you may rightfully hold, you will not extend them to my mother.”
Malfoy had descended back into his usual, comfortable cynicism, but Harry was still reeling. He could tell Malfoy had been abused, but what he was hearing now was...beyond.
They drank their coffee in silence for a long time, and then just sat, until blue light began to filter in through the basement window above them. Potter looked down at his watch, and swore. “It’s morning.”
“More or less,” Draco said, wiggling his toes. “Thanks.” His voice came out husky. Potter’s concern still felt strange, and his technique could probably use some work, but Draco had to admit his foot
“Well, she had to be, we all did, working for Voldemort.” He sighed quietly, scrubbing a hand over his face, as if trying to wipe away the dark look he was wearing. “But the fact is, I’m not sure I ever saw my mother happy, not really. Not all the way through.”
Harry removed his glasses again and rubbed his hands over his face. How the hell had he gotten here again? What cruel twist of fate had put him in this position exactly?
Draco sighed and flipped the page of the book he’d been reading, fingers twirling his quill. As frustrating as it was, not finding much in the texts Ron had delivered, reading was still calming. Rain was hammering on the windows outside, turning the light coming through the curtains a soft gray, and the fire was crackling and popping softly. It had been a quiet day, so far. Potter had made eggs and coffee again that morning, and brought it to Draco where he’d been sleeping beside the couch. Breakfast-on-floor, as Potter had called it. Little kindnesses like that shouldn’t have even surprised Draco, by now, but he still found himself taken aback at every one.
Harry winced internally. It didn’t sound like Draco had accepted that he didn’t need to be better than everyone around him—it sounded like he’d simply decided he was garbage. Harry would almost prefer to see Draco go back to his old arrogance, rather than the look of self-disgust that lurked in his eyes now, but there had to be some kind of middle ground.
He hadn’t given Hermione any details when he’d called her, in fact he’d barely come out with the fact that he needed her help before she was already telling him what time she’d be there.
Draco hesitated a moment, and then walked over to drop to a seat on the floor, still a careful distance from Harry. He was sitting with his knees up to his chest, arms wrapped around them. Harry could see hollow, grey smudges beneath Draco’s eyes in the firelight.
Draco took the cell from the thing’s grimy little hand and returned to the heater to snap it into place. Now he just had to get that muck out of the filter and jerry-rig something to fix the fan blade. Kreacher, after giving him one last suspicious look, thankfully retreated to his room and shut the door.
Draco tucked his overgrown hair behind his ears and attempted to tune out the muttering and focus. The filter was clogged with a strange green sludge, the fan blades were broken, and it was running on one power cell. No wonder the damn thing didn’t work.
And then there was this morning. Draco had been humiliated by his overreaction to being startled out of a nightmare--Potter had barely touched him, and Draco had cowered away as if Potter were trying to kill him. He was disgusted with himself, ashamed that the things that had been done to him had left such a deep scar in his brain.  He’d thought he was stronger than that.
Finally, as always, please leave a comment if you have any thoughts, even if it's a criticism or a correction. I live for feedback on my work and I can't tell you how happy they make me.
“And besides,” Potter continued, pausing to take a sip of coffee, “This has basically become my bedroom. The rest of the house kind of creeps me out, to be honest.”
“In any event,” Hermione continued, cutting them both off, “From what I’ve gathered, it’s what links you. The curse marked you when you signed for Draco.”
Draco smirked, holding an arm out to observe the lumpy, grey knitting of the jumper. “Normally I'd say I look good in a sack, but this...this might actually be worse than a sack.”
Potter gave him a fierce smile, more life in his eyes than Draco had seen yet. And he held out his pinkie.
She looked lovely, her bushy brown hair tied back in a myriad of thick box braids down her back, her ministry robes tailored and pressed, a soft smile on her face. As he looked closer, however, he could see she was a little worn down; there was a heavy, dull fatigue in her eyes and the hang of her shoulders.
“Well, like I said, it was my fault. I had let her down, over and over again. Finally, she told me she wasn’t going to watch me destroy myself any more. But if I ever decided I wanted to start trying, to live again, to give her a call. Cause she’d never stop being my friend.” Potter sighed. “That’s always how she was. Never the kind of person to turn her back on someone. But in the end, I guess I turned my back on her. And after that, I couldn’t face Ron. It took him a long time to accept that Ginny and I were seeing each other--he was mad, at first--and I didn’t know what he’d do.” Potter leaned back on his hands, shrugged. “Not such a long story after all, I guess.”
The day before he’d left Azkaban found its way into the forefront of his mind. He remembered his aching wrists chained to the wall above him, remembered the door of his cell opening, the sinking feeling in his stomach as he recognized Corbyn.
Potter offered his arm, and Draco reached for it tremulously and closed his shivering fingers around Potter’s wrist.
That made Draco feel even worse about their argument, and he was realizing he probably owed Potter a real apology. He took a deep breath, and forced the words out. “I’m sorry, about this morning.”
, he decided. He didn’t want to go back to the person he used to be, anyway. And if Potter took his vulnerability and used it against him, so be it. His situation couldn’t get much worse.
Draco reached a hand up to touch his neck and face, taking a long, deep breath. “Thank you, Potter.”
