It had perhaps not been as inward as he had hoped, as the first thing Ginny said to him on returning from saying her goodnights was, "You are being rather rude to my mother, Harry."
There was no talking, no thinking now. Just Malfoy, his skin, his scent driving Harry to distraction. Their bodies slid into a rhythm together almost unbidden, Malfoy straddling one of Harry's thighs, Harry desperately rocking against him. Malfoy's erection pressed into Harry's leg, the rolling of their hips making Harry groan. He reached up blindly to have Malfoy's mouth back and found it, swiping his tongue over those lips as he had seen Malfoy do to Bertram back in that alley.
"I can sleep when I'm finished," Draco snaps. He can't afford to lose concentration, can't afford to lose a single drop of the liquid.
"Why are you bothering Harry?" Ron demanded. Harry turned slightly, his eyes finding Malfoy's in alarm.
Harry had to take a moment to ready himself, his breaths growing longer in an attempt to calm himself until he finally said, “It is true.”
Harry might not even have looked at the card, might have stuffed it in a pocket or some such, but for the certainty that Lord Malfoy would do nothing without purpose. He sighed and looked down at it.
"You know about Remus and I," Sirius began at length.  "What I have to tell you happened before you were born."
He was greeted with a clap on the shoulder from Ernie, but when he turned, Lucius was looking straight at him, brow furrowed. Harry straightened and raised his chin.
"Don't," Harry cried. Harry didn't think of the body as his, didn't think of things the way Draco did.
No reason to bother. Because Draco didn't want to hide this: he wanted it to be all right to display it to the world, Harry knew that now.
Harry almost welled up when she said it. It was the certainty of a friend who knew exactly what he was capable of and what he was not – and to whom he was still the same person despite all the revelations of the hour.
“Assaulting a blackmailer isn’t going to look great if they found him. Do you think they might have?”
“That’s not my title, Fawley,” Harry reminded him. He gave Padfoot’s head one last gently pat and pulled his hands back through the bars. “But thank you. And thank you, Ron.”
Harry was all at once exhausted just from standing. “Quite right. Best you go now. Thank you, Goyle.”
and lots of dull hand-wringing over not wanting to hurt anyone. But then there was the delightful passage about halfway through the article:
“Like the golden snitch?” Sirius clasped Harry’s shoulder in the same fatherly gesture people kept making to him. Perhaps he seemed increasingly in need of propping up.
Draco’s voice was odd when he said, “Do you really think he will permit that? In his mind you have added insult to injury. He will see no alternative but to take you off the board.”
Malfoy was always colourful and so Harry chose a burgundy waistcoat and cravat to wear beneath his tailcoat; he had purchased matching gloves but never worn them as Ron had declared them 'dandyish'. He thought perhaps that on this occasion that would be appropriate.
Feeling at a disadvantage from his position on the floor, Harry stood, righting his clothes. "Draco, what would you have me do? I am married, I am a father, I have responsibilities and you knew all of that long before now."
"I am tired, Harry," Ginny said quietly. "It is pleasant to have nothing to worry about beyond resting and I am sure that it is terribly dull for a man of your position…"
Harry in the present had to swallow bile. This was Draco’s own memory. Lucius was right, it offered proof positive that all the allegations were true; he knew what was coming and knew how it was going to make him look. And worst of all, in order for this to be included in the trial, Draco must have given it to his father. The thing did indeed speak for itself.
Harry didn’t know what he intended to say until “It’s not true!” burst out of him. “You cannot expect me to believe that all of it, more than a year, was nothing more than a revenge plot!”
"There is an entire floor to be had, Harry!" Sirius said at once. "And Remus is only here for the weekend, it's the middle of term don't you know..."
So when Ginny told him the price of seeing his children — "You must never, ever see Draco Malfoy again" — Harry thought of how many times over the last year he had told himself that same thing and how impossible it had felt.
"I'm almost finished," says Draco. His hands are shaking as he opens the phial and pours more of elixir down the body's throat.
The invisibility cloak was the easiest: Draco inherited it when Harry died. In the sense that he knew where it was and he knew how to get it.
“I…” There were still no words in Harry’s head, still no defence to offer. Sirius had caught him completely off guard. He cleared his throat and tried, “Is this because I had lunch with him at the ministry? Because—”
“You see, it would be better by far to meet him halfway!” Draco said eagerly, as though he’d already convinced Harry he was right.
The beautiful Tazza Fountain seemed to soothe him a little, but he could still barely speak to Harry, who wished abruptly that he had not brought the two of them out in public so that he could wrap his arms around Draco and tell him that whatever his father said, Draco was perfect exactly the way he was. He wished he could promise Draco a lifetime, coax him into smiles with kisses right here in the evening light.
"Nothing like that!" Harry reassured her at once, cursing his own stupidity in scaring her so badly. "Not at all, no, much more like…" Harry bit his lip. "You remember Romilda Vane?"
It was at times like this that Harry most missed being able to go to his friends for counsel. Hermione was the only one who suspected anything about his having an extramarital relationship and she was hardly prepared to advise him. It would be the height of cruelty to ask Ginny or Ron. Sirius… Well, he suspected that Sirius had more experience in that area than he had ever let on, but that didn't mean that Sirius was a viable option either.
“I don’t know,” Harry admitted. He took his glasses off and rubbed his face. “I won’t become his puppet.”
“Oh, yes, him,” Draco said, remembering a certain athletic enthusiasm which had made for a very interesting long weekend, and a certain incorrect name blurted out at an inopportune moment. He scowled. “It wouldn’t get back to Boot straight away, would it?”
Sirius hesitated, and Harry saw the truth in his face. “I think if you do, whatever misfortune Lucius has planned for you will end up involving your wife and children, if it doesn’t already.”
The effort seemed to drain him; he collapsed back into his chair. There was a glass and an open decanter on the table next to him; Harry realised he had been drinking heavily, presumably to digest the results of his investigation. He’d come to the house at the worst possible time.
PLEASE READ THIS NOTE: a kind reader pointed out a couple of inconsistencies in the plot and on looking back I realised I'd posted the chapter here below (in its rightful place) instead of chapter 3. So if something there was jarring, that would be why. I'm so sorry. I have no idea how I managed to do this.
Shaky, Harry stood a moment, breathing deeply. His mind whirling, it took him a few minutes to register that something was odd about the house; he had expected it to be dark, but he could see through the window that the lights still blazed. Harry frowned in confusion, and entered the house at once.
"I remember thinking before, though," Harry went on, "that Ginny would like to have a girl. We are thinking of Lily, perhaps, or Molly."
The thought was anathema to him. Even with Draco furious and petulant, he would rather be here than back in Strathpeffer, or even Godric's Hollow. He knew now why he was hesitant to give himself fully to Draco; it would be a point of no return. But Harry felt now as though that point had long since been passed. Perhaps in the back room of the Hogs Head, perhaps in the carriage where Draco had first kissed him. Perhaps even before then. He did not know.
This was it, at last, then. “You would make him miserable. You have shown him no love and you would destroy it where he finds it.”
Harry looked up. He had spent the day with Sirius looking into the finances of the Black estate and had not anticipated an evening excursion.
The distance was insufficient for him to be able to finish his mind's feverish speculations: he was permitted to walk under his own power into the stone room at the end of the corridor, considerably cleaner than any he had walked through to arrive at this point. As the door closed behind him he looked into the one face he had been so desperate to see.
He ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and then returned to his room, jittery, to await Draco's arrival.
It was true he’d hurt Kirke for daring to do what he and Draco had asked, just because Harry had changed his mind. He had brought this on himself firstly by going to renters and secondly by hurting them.
Draco's whole body was taut as a bow string as he arched into Harry's body, his hips jerking, his hard cock rubbing against Harry's hip again and again, continually seeking a better angle, more contact between their two bodies. At last, with a snarl of frustration, Draco surged upright, flipping them over so that Harry was beneath him.
Blaise’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, or perhaps it was resignation. Harry couldn’t tell. “Very well. I tried.” He reached for his wand with exaggerated slowness, and pulled his memory from the Pensieve, returning it to his head. “I think it best I be on my way, then.” He hesitated another moment until Harry gave him his full attention. “I know you’re used to a great deal of trouble, Potter, but I don’t think you’ve had nearly enough practice dodging it.”
“I suggest a compromise, Mrs Weasley,” Lucius said. “If after the next witness you still see no relevance in Mr Filch’s testimony, object again and let us ask the Minister to rule at that point.”
. He made an effort to be courteous to Molly even if he no longer always felt warmth towards her. He spent far more time with his children than most of the men he knew. And he missed his wife while it seemed as though she merely wanted him to cut off more and more of himself.
Malfoy glared at Zabini, who smiled benignly. "He met the Black Widow and of course the lovely Lady Malfoy. I suspect the tabbies thoroughly savaged him, did they not, Potter? But of course I was there to save you."
"You continue to comfort yourself with the notion that you have no choice," Draco said though his tone was, for him, exceedingly gentle.
"I'm inside you," Harry echoed, looking into that most dear and desired face. Draco's eyes then were so wide, his eyes almost all pupil. He looked as though his very senses had been stolen from him so that he could do nothing but feel; he had been reduced to pure sensation and Harry's nerves twitched. He caught one of Draco's hands and pinned it down on the mattress, interlacing their fingers before he began to thrust.
"About my criminal infatuation with my own sex?" Draco shook his head; Harry felt the movement though he could not see it. "Even I did not know until later."
Sirius shook his head. "I do not know who you are becoming, Harry. I've watched the fire bleed out of you – well and so, it happens to many as we age. It even seemed perhaps that such a calming of the soul was what you would wish. I remember you after the war, your desperation and loneliness despite all of us being there for you as best we could. And now it is as though all of that is come again when you have so much in your life, Harry!"
Hermione held him until she managed to stop weeping, then she took a seat. “Before you say anything,” she began, “I’m going to need to cast a few spells to ensure the Aurors aren’t listening.”
Harry followed him toward the lift. The Wizengamot rooms were all on the second floor of the Ministry and comprised some ten courtrooms, two assembly rooms and various and sundry antechambers.
"And you were so kind when we were here before that I do not wish to outstay my welcome," Harry said firmly. "There are no doubt some reasonable rooms to be had for rent; it need be nothing extravagant."
Harry had not pressed, knowing that to do so would only give rise to questions he would not know how to answer. He merely steeled himself as best he could against the inevitable encounter, and concentrated on planning.
Draco whimpered and Harry realised he must have said part of that at least out loud. He bit down on Draco’s throat causing him to shout out. The drag of herringbone robes against Draco’s pale skin, the tension and fury of Harry’s desire, all of it culminated in Draco spilling over Harry’s fingers with a cry.
But Lucius went on, “I conceded that as male lovers go, you could have done far worse. I remember I once hoped that you would follow Potter's example and marry. I did not expect that instead you would encourage him to follow yours. But he already has his heirs where you do not. He can afford to indulge himself. You must do your duty. I suppose I should be relieved that at least you will bring no half-bloods into this world and shame us all but I cannot: you are less than a man, unworthy to be my son and I…"
Harry didn't know how to untangle that. He'd known that Draco's relationship with his father was not as Draco would have wished it long before this, but he had never before seen the damage when it was like this, so raw.
Sirius grimaced. "The woman is my cousin Narcissa. Extremely apt, no woman ever loved herself so much. Remember, I warned you her son would be in your year at Hogwarts. Her husband…" But then another man came to speak with Sirius and press his embarrassing thanks on Harry, and Sirius forced himself to return to his better manners.
“Oh, yes, Revenge of the Veela,” said Draco sourly. “She always did fancy seeing if she could turn Potter back on to women. She’s a little young, don’t you think?”
Diagon Alley seemed quite busy this day. Harry had rarely come in spring, and the clean, warm air was a pleasant change from the filth of the Muggle streets. The chatter of shoppers going about their business made Harry smile. He did not spend enough time here.
Draco cut him off. "I know what you fear. You fear that after such an act you will no longer be able to deny that you are a sodomite."
Harry sighed. "I was engaged in a discussion not so very long ago about the role of the Muggle-born in the wizarding world."
"Is that so?" he said quietly, and his tone must have been dangerous because Zabini and Nott both looked at him sharply, the humour fading from their faces. "I beg you will excuse me."
Narcissa was now scowling at her husband. "Lucius, please," she said, forcing a laugh which Harry was sure she had intended it sound like a trilling bell rather than the sound she produced: sharp, with the edges of a serrated blade. "What must the Potters be thinking of us?"
Ginny frowned at him from across the room. "Are you quite well? You have been very quiet these last few weeks."
feelings," Ginny replied flatly. "I nearly died, Harry, and I am sorry if the changes wrought in me inconvenience you."
Draco pushed at Harry's shoulders, manoeuvring him against the billiard table. Harry wondered if he was about to be pressed down into it and a leap of renewed fear made him tense, but Draco soothed him with a kiss to the throat before meeting his eyes with the promise of pleasure and dropping to his knees.
Draco was still trying to catch his breath. His legs wobbled beneath him and Harry took more of his weight.
Harry and Ginny had barely taken their assigned seats before Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy arrived, wearing robes much finer than the occasion warranted. Lucius was dressed entirely in black, as was his wont; Narcissa entirely in ice-white. Harry wondered for a moment if that was why Draco insisted on bright rainbow colours before he found himself nose to nose with the father of his lover.
He hadn't been in ever since that name-shouting incident. He'd taken to ordering via Owl instead, considered it best for all parties – in much the same way he did when he had a hankering for goods from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Of course, in the latter circumstance, he also used an alias just in case.
He had failed to consider what a burden this would be on the man who had first-hand experience of the prison to which Harry might find himself condemned. Every time Harry thought he had reached the depths of self-loathing, he discovered a new way in which he had let down someone dear to him.
A flash of red hair in the corner of his eye made him look round sharply, but he could see no one familiar in his line of sight and was forced to conclude that he was suffering from mere paranoia.
He would never have had his children, though. And he would never wish their lives away. James and Albus were growing up fine, and though he had barely seen Lily he loved her. Thinking of them simultaneously relaxed and pained him. But there was no world in which he could have everything he wanted and Harry knew that beyond doubt.
“Then you should have brought your own,” Sirius replied. At least there was a hint of humour there now. Harry gave a small, half-smile.
Lord Draco smirked again and Harry found himself distracted from his thoughts by watching those lips curve into different shapes. He shook his head to clear it, perturbed by his abstraction.
Harry began to lift his napkin from his lap when Lucius’s hand came down on his shoulder. “No need to get up,” Lucius purred. “I merely wished to greet my son and of course to let you know how much I look forward to working with you on the Committee for Muggle Relations.”
Harry kissed Draco's mouth again gently, stroking his hands over the lines of Draco's chest. "I wish-"
“Shut up, Blaise! He wants me and I will make him see it.” Draco took a long, aggressive draw on his cigarette before stubbing it out. “By the time I’m done he will be completely at my mercy. He will swear he loves me and weep when I leave him.”
“I object, on the basis that this memory is not the best evidence – testimony would be preferable in this instance.”
Draco blinked, as if surprised by the question. “I feel quite well,” he said, surprised. “Indeed, I feel lighter, if anything.”
"No," Draco replied. "No, some choose instead to torture themselves by fearing that which they long for most fervently. But you and I here together, who does it hurt?"
“I’ll have to go back to the hotel at some point,” he said quietly. “I’ll need my things and make a payment on the bill.”
"No," Harry said and took her hand. Now he knew himself to be selfish and the worst type of coward for he would have been much better able to face losing Ginny had he not lost Draco. But there were other things to think of. "Ginny, I have loved you for years and I love you still. I have felt only… unnecessary. No – confined. You wish to do specific things in certain ways and I feel as though I never meet your requirements any more. I did not know how to talk to you of it because you were so weakened."
“So you see,” Harry said, his throat dry from the smoke in the room and the effort of talking, “the relationship between Draco and I – I could not possibly give it up.”
James Potter's left tibia, retrieved from a grave at Godric's Hollow. Lucius Malfoy's blood, drawn from his arm against his will. Draco's flesh. Draco's left ring finger, willing given. The finger on which he would have worn a wedding ring, the finger which was Harry's by right and desire.
Potter gave a pained little laugh. “Right, because of the papers. You know Ginny never said that. Any of what they put in the papers. But she wasn’t about to deny things that made me look good when she’d gone and dumped me.”
Teddy had seemed more confused than anything by what had happened at the time, but what if now that he was older he had made sense of it and wanted to confront Harry? Or what if he wanted…
In the home stretch now! Big hugs to all you lovely commenters, especially lijahlover, the real MVP xx
"Harry, don't panic," Draco said, soothing him with a touch. "He may know, he may not, but either way I would like you to sit with them, talk with them."
"Mm," Harry replied. He stirred slowly, leaning back to look into Draco's sated eyes. "I didn't look for long after all."
Hermione was on her feet in a trice, her face reflecting a deep-seated horror. "Harry," she breathed, "you cannot mean… Is Voldemort… is he…?"
"Everyone knows, of course," Ron said. "And there is considerable debate regarding the veracity of your motivation. But I know that you would never hurt Ginny." He squeezed Harry's shoulder in solidarity. "I know it."
"Now," Draco said in a friendly sort of way, "Guess who gets this nifty little device if you don't back off my man!"
"Hermione," Harry burst out as she sat down, "Hermione, I need your help but I must first ask you to promise that you will tell no one about this."
He had now been away from Draco overnight, he reflected. Draco might well be frantic or furious. Harry would have preferred to wait and talk to Sirius again this morning, but he could not in good conscience leave Draco longer with no word. He sighed and rubbed his face. He had never managed to tell Sirius about the card, not with everything else they had had to say to one another. It would have to wait.
all these clothes for daring to come between his skin and Draco's. He raised his hands to place his fingers in the hollow of Draco's collarbones, marvelling that they had not changed at all, that they still entranced him beyond all reason. Harry wanted to spend hours kissing his way along them but the need was too strong. Reason had deserted him completely.
And then, right around the time Draco was beginning to pay attention, to wonder if Potter really could be that good, to wonder if it would be worth pursuing…
Sirius nodded. The bitterness in his eyes transmuted into outright hatred as he spat, "Thus solving two family problems with one masterstroke."
Sirius' face was ashen.  He sat, seeming to need the support of something beneath him.  A long moment of silence followed as Sirius steeled himself.
At the time, Harry had no idea how significant that encounter would come to be. He was merely grateful for the distraction afforded by the presence of Remus Lupin.
"So tell me, Potter," Malfoy said, his voice oddly empty of the mocking tone Harry had come to expect. "Was it really so unnatural and repugnant?"
Malfoy's petulance caused Harry's ire to rise. "She is in a delicate condition and there have been some complications. The Healer is worried about her."
"And yet I too find myself behaving uncharacteristically," Draco said. "I have never cared before whether a lover chose to stay or go. You…" his voice trailed away.
"No," Harry said, shaking his head. "No, that wasn't... I felt so sick afterwards. Draco, I don't want to think about you like that. The way we are, with someone else. I..." Harry forced his hands, which had clenched themselves into fists, to relax.
Harry rolled his eyes, but he went, green powder in hand. At the other end, a butler was waiting to greet him with a "Good evening, sir!" and Harry passed him his cloak and top hat, privately thinking how ridiculous it was to wear such things just to take a Floo journey.
“As far as I can see,” Sirius said, “your only remaining option is to do as Blaise suggested and flee.”
"Teddy is my godson!" Harry snapped. "You are trying to corrupt me! The two situations are hardly comparable!"
"Graphorns," Sirius said bitterly. "Bagman wanted the hide for a coat and thought he could make some money selling other parts of the beast off for potion supplies."
"That is rather my point, Draco," Lord Malfoy said waspishly. "You are not taking responsibility for any of our estates, you are not taking your obligations to the Wizengamot seriously, you are not interested in preserving pure-blood traditions. You have spent the last month or more in what amounts to little more than a sulk and it is unbecoming."
Harry swirled the brandy around the glass, not knowing what to say. "I may stay with Sirius a while or I may take my own house. I do not know."
"You will visit Remus as usual?" Harry asked, noting the way Sirius' features relaxed at the mention of Remus' name.
“Order, please,” Diggory said, his tone resigned. “Mrs Weasley, you are here to act as advocate for the accused?”
Pansy had arranged to meet Gabrielle for lunch at Tore de Pants. When Draco arrived, Pansy was already chain smoking, her usual activity in lieu of actually eating, and Gabrielle was sipping a Pumpkin Pimm’s. The little tart.
He reached out then instinctively to touch Draco's face. Humans are such tactile creatures and impulses born of habit and experience are not easily discarded. But Harry's hand could not touch Draco now, would never be able to touch Draco again and it drew a strangled cry from his throat.
Harry did the only thing he could think of, reaching out as he had wanted to do since Draco had entered the room. His wand was still clutched in his right hand so he reached out with his left, grasping the back of Draco's neck and pulling him closer. He kissed Draco to quiet him, just a touch of lips, and then pressed their foreheads together, breathing in Draco's scent and feeling the heat of his body so near.
At the time, Draco hadn’t been overly interested. “Really? Good lord, Pans, for anyone in particular?”
Draco tried to smile again but there was something uncertain in it. "I asked you before if you knew what you were getting into."
The disdain with which Blaise said the last made Harry stiffen. He was tired and had been sorting his belongings by hand in order to help himself accept the transition away from the life he and Draco had shared these past months. “I suppose I am.”
"She nearly died," Harry snarled, squaring up to Malfoy now. Their bodies were so close but for the first time Harry wanted to punch him more than he wanted to caress him. "She nearly died when I was with you. Don't you
So Harry took them to the back room where Sirius had installed a Pensieve. Harry had never had cause to use it, but it was not secured – being in the house was surely security enough to Sirius’s mind – so it was the work of moments for Blaise to pull a silvery thread from his head and place it into the water for Harry to see.
Draco gasped as Harry's hands went to divest him of his clothes, pulling away frock coat, waistcoat, cravat, shirt,
Harry smiled and bent to brush a kiss over Draco’s mussed hair where it hung over his forehead. “And what excitements will your day bring?”
Harry had never been good at dressing up what he wanted to say, not really. He had to hope that direct would be good enough.
"Oh, yes," said Lucius, a thin smile appearing on his lips. "I saw you at Portree with your lovely wife but a week ago. And how does she fare?"
August had come and so the ball was to be held outside, in a quiet corner of St James' Park which would be warded against non-magical visitors for the occasion. Sirius had insisted once again on footing the bill, which must surely have run into hundreds of galleons.
"He was good," Harry said, remembering. "I liked having him there. But the restrictions against werewolves…"
The burning grey of his eyes haunted Harry for the rest of the day, swirled through his mind as Minister Shacklebolt slapped his back and called him 'My boy', as Headmistress McGonagall told him that "Albus would be very proud of you today."
"He was present in Scotland," Harry said. "He is a very urbane man, well-spoken. And he argued his case so fluently that I did not know how to put my own forward. To me it is so self-evident that progress in the world should be based on merit that I cannot understand people who think otherwise, yet I find that when challenged, I cannot articulate my reasoning."
Lucius immediately snapped to attention. He had gone for purple robes that day. Positively flamboyant, Harry thought. He was probably going to have a wild party that night to celebrate his victory. “Minister, I object—”
Harry and Draco were having afternoon tea when all at once a familiar Patronus in the form of a large silver dog entered the room.
A small cheer went up. It really was going to be a circus, Harry reflected. The show of support warmed him but how long could it conceivably last?
“We aren’t,” Draco said. “But I am in a position to foster closer relationships with you and with some of my patrons.”
At that Hermione's head came up. The three of them had shared all manner of secrets at school, but it had always been
“I do,” Draco looked awkward. “There are some I could look to for favours, but Harry, they would expect certain things in return and I…”
Just a moment, he told himself. Just a moment to gather his thoughts and to remember, and then he would return.
Draco realised he’d let that slip – good lord, he was all over the place this morning. “I mean that there doesn’t seem to be any truth to it.” Significant pause. “Because there isn’t – is there?”
The boy looked at him, then back at the pictures. "I see. Oliver Wood for you then, is it?" A nasty tone had replaced the previous joviality.
Harry reached out to touch the furniture and the things of Draco's lying haphazardly around. Would it be too dangerous to keep even one?
Harry chewed his quill as he had in school. There was so much to say, it was hard to know where to begin.
The shock of a lady’s presence after the soft delight of finding Lord Draco was like an abrupt soaking in ice water. The pleasant, drugging sensation he had been experiencing quite vanished and Harry felt a frisson run though him of disaster narrowly averted. He had the perfect excuse to leave now as he and the lady were not acquainted, and Draco had not seen fit to begin introductions.
"Well, here we are at least. We have made it through the summer," Ginny said, mostly to herself. “And I have lived another year.”
In the morning, Harry lay holding Draco for a long while before hunger at last demanded that they rise for the day. Both needed to bathe and while Draco's suggestion that they did so together tempted Harry greatly, he demurred, saying that was a pleasure best savoured when they would have time to enjoy it fully.
Afterwards, after Harry was dead, Draco remembered that day. He wasn't certain until he held the wand in his hand, but when the power of it filled him he knew with certainty that he could do this, he could bring Harry back.
Harry woke a little too early the next morning, in his old room, with a monstrous headache brewing. Some kind soul – most likely Dobby – had placed some restorative potions by his bedside and Harry gratefully drank them at once.
"Of course," said Ginny. "As could you. But I imagine he'd find a way to punish us for it." She looked at the monochromatic pair another moment before she shook her head. "And you are fighting the legislation he wishes to pass?"
But Sirius was shaking his head. “I think we are beyond that now. If Blaise is right then Lucius has all he needs.”
"Not at all – you yourself might be regarded as a pureblood," Lucius said. "Your children, certainly so. There is little enough to find fault with there. No, indeed, I meant rather to draw quite a different parallel."
Gasping, Draco broke away. "No, no, Potter, not yet. Here I am naked as per your request, and you still wearing half your clothes."
The hotel foyer was still lit with gleaming charms when Harry made it there, the drawing rooms still open, the concierge desk still manned.
Harry woke to a sharp flash of sensation. He moaned, still partly asleep, and heard Draco's choked response; his mouth was already around Harry's cock.
Ginny, Morag and the children were on the uppermost floors, while Sirius and Harry were on the second. Harry considered going up to look at his children to banish this strangeness but found himself instead descending the stairs, heading for the drawing room.
"Do you think I care a whit what Draco says?" Sirius burst out, a man pushed beyond endurance.  "Listen to me, as you should have when I told you to stay away from him: if you pursue this course it can lead only to your destruction."
Harry did not need to see more, although Blaise had not seen fit to end the memory there. With a roar, Harry pulled himself away as Draco opened Blaise’s trousers.
“You don’t understand yet, Lucius. Do you?” Harry raised his voice. “Whatever you did, it has cost you your son. He will never forgive you for this, even if you were capable of remorse. Which I doubt you are. I’ve seen that arrogant look before and I know it well. I fell in love with a man and you would condemn me for it but you, you cannot love your wife or your son of anything beyond your own ambition and you feel yourself to be the more honourable man here?” Harry couldn’t help the laugh which escaped him. “Perhaps I am guilty under the law. But the law is wrong. The law should celebrate love – particularly when we wizards know so well what magicks it imbues and what cost the lack of it exacts. We see the consequences of love in our world every day. My life was saved because of my mother’s love for me, her sacrifice for me. Many of yours were saved because of my love for all of you.”
Malfoy was sitting back on a hard wooden chair, his long legs thrown up onto the table before him. His cravat was red, the colour of rage. He stood, long limbs levering him upright with effortless grace, and prowled towards Harry like a predator about to execute his prey.
Sirius kept eye contact with him as he drained his glass one final time. “In that case, I rather think we had get another bottle after all.”
The words hit him like a body blow. He was going there after all, to be drained of all the joy in his life, to become a husk of who he had been. The cries from the gallery grew louder until Diggory was shouting to make himself heard.
Diggory didn’t look at Harry this time when he came in to take his seat. “Thank you. Mrs Weasley, do you have any witnesses for the defence?”
"Charming," Harry said, though he had been utterly unable to follow the latter half of the performance. Sirius had suggested attending a gentleman's club but Harry didn't dare; he knew instinctively that Malfoy would be there, either by design or by reason of the terrible misfortune which had caused them to meet in the first place. He insisted on going home to check on his family, leaving Sirius to spend the evening gambling his money away alone. Harry had checked on his sons before selecting a book on which he could not concentrate, to provide himself with the illusion that he was not thinking of Malfoy.
They had somehow grown closer over the course of their fight. Harry found himself snarling those words directly into Malfoy's face, his hands clenched into fists by his side. Malfoy was barely inches away, his face flushed, his eyes furious and alive.
Draco nodded slowly. He reached into his breast pocket and said, "Terry, have you seen one of these?"
"Master Potter is here," Kreacher said. "Master Potter has come back and Master Sirius did not tell Kreacher, no, and now another bedroom will have to be made up."
They had met in the Atrium; Diggory had managed to look for all the world as though he had merely been passing through but Harry did not believe it for a moment. He followed the Minister into the lifts and to the first floor into his office while Diggory greeted the other people they passed throwing only the occasional pleasantry Harry’s way until finally they reached the office and closed the door.
Harry turned to meet Draco's gaze. There was an expression in his eyes that Harry was unaccustomed to seeing – something quite unlike the brash confidence Draco wore like armour or the softness Harry could find in him sometimes when their passion ebbed and they lay together like this.
Malfoy stood, and Harry wondered how so great a change could have taken place in this filthy little room.
"Draco," Harry gasped and was dually rewarded as Draco's mouth took him in completely and his finger slid all the way inside. Harry climaxed at once with a sharp cry, and his arms gave out. He would have crashed to the floor but Draco held him, withdrawing his finger from Harry's back passage and rearranging Harry's body on the couch.
“Yes. And I’ve got some bills now, you know. Had to get a potion to heal those bruises after you sent me flying. Another for the bump on the head.” He looked at Harry meaningfully, and Harry cursed inwardly.
Potter appeared to be thinking, as terrifying a prospect as that was. “So wait… you didn’t come in here and throw Baddock out because you knew you and I had already…” Potter waved his hand between the two of them. “You just decided you wanted me and you were going to have me?”
"I could hardly send her no word, Draco!" Harry cried. "I could not have her wondering where I was, trying to find me - I would not worry her. And I wrote to my children, too!"
“And what would you have me do, Draco?” Harry shouted. “Kowtow to him? Sell out the last of my principles so that you can hold on to yours?
"Do you feel different?" she would ask after every attempt and Harry would search his feelings and be forced to conclude that no, he did not.
"Good morning," he replied, the moment's warmth fading fast as he remembered his purpose in coming. "I have everything you need."
And I will never see him again, Harry remembered in a rush and the force of it almost knocked him from his chair.
"To qualify the honourable member's assertion, let it be known that the lack of a strategy focused on the latest information is one of the problems we face," Lord Malfoy said smoothly. "Homogenising a range of issues into one and labelling it 'hysteria' is counter-productive to ensuring the best health of wizarding society."
Sirius had sat down to breakfast before Harry even made it downstairs. Kreacher poured Harry some tea unprompted and Harry thanked him quietly.
Harry hated to be rude but the boy had made him so angry that all he could force out was, "Take the money, if you please."
His business with the goblins was concluded before lunchtime and when he left the bank he was disconcerted to find Remus waiting for him.
Lucius turned to look at him then and for a moment Harry panicked, wondering if the man was a Legimens. He slammed up his Occulumency shields as best he could, but Lucius’s expression did not change, and in another moment he was back to the matter at hand.
“Then how can I refuse?” Harry said at last. “I hope you know that I would countenance such a thing for none but you.”
Sirius held up his palms, "Fine, fine." He seemed a little relieved. "Well, let's see, all the preparations here are in place. Morag's a fine girl for the boys, and I have engaged a Madam Pomfrey to act as Healer."
“Kirke, I really wish you hadn’t done this,” he said quietly. “You are quite right that it was ungallant of me to use a Knockback Jinx in such a circumstance and I will happily give you the cost of the potion ingredients. Which I reckon to be less than two Galleons; I shall offer you five, by way of compensation, and I apologise sincerely for my lack of gallantry.” He crossed to Kirke in a few steps and tucked his wand and the coins from his bag securely into a pocket in the coat; Kirke stared at him in fear, all but frozen even though Harry had not used a full-body bind. “I am sorry not to have thought of the damage done to you before, and I would happily have offered you compensation. There was no need for this.”
Harry sat himself on the couch. One of the boys – Bertram, perhaps – handed him a sweet-smelling clear liquid which might have been gin or frankly might have been any one of a number of things. Harry smelled it a moment longer to ensure it wasn’t a potion and then took a long sip.
"Perhaps not," Draco said, shaking his head. "Yet I think there are certain establishments where we would draw less attention than we otherwise might. I will meet you here at seven o'clock."
"You won't even try!" Draco snapped. "You'd rather go and bury yourself back in that nowhere marriage where it's nice and safe - you're pathetic."
"Perhaps bridges might be built?" he suggested feebly. "I am sorry, Ginny, none of this has been about what we want for ourselves."
"Because I think we already know that our views are utterly dissimilar," Draco said, reaching for his cravat on the dressing table. "You believe that someone of no wizarding family, who has never studied our traditions, who had no knowledge of our culture until they were already more than halfway to being of age," Draco's fingers tugged angrily at his cravat, belying his cool tone. "We play with Muggle things perhaps but we have culture of our own – art and literature and music, families and etiquette. Is that all meaningless? Should someone who has never known these things be not only regarded as equal to the best of us but permitted to rearrange our whole society to better suit himself?"
"No," Draco agreed. "No, you should be able to feel it when I touch you." Without thinking, he looked back over his shoulder to the body on the slab.
Harry slid his mouth over his lover’s cock again and again until Draco was moaning above him, fingers knotted in Harry’s hair – though he did not tug, did not fuck his face but rather allowed Harry to worship him. The head of his cock hit the back of Harry’s throat and he gagged a little. Draco whimpered at the sensation so Harry let it happen again.
“Seriously?” Draco straightened. “You don’t think she’d want to have another crack at Potter herself, do you? I mean, I could definitely see that Blaise wouldn’t mind a little ménage…”
"Remus!" Harry said, a smile coming naturally to his face for what felt like the first time that day. "I'm so glad you're here!"
“I thought I’d join you for breakfast,” Ginny said brightly. “It has been too long and I have missed you.”
Draco gave a sound like a scream before finally, "Yours!" burst out of his throat. "Yours, yes, I'm yours, yes, please,
The man gave no answer but merely stepped from the shadows into the lamplight. A familiar flash of light hair gave way to a face which bore no further resemblance to Draco. Harry frowned at him for a moment. “Kirke, is it not? I would not expect to find you here.”
"The entrance to the public gallery is over there," Sirius said, pointing, but Harry had already seen a flash of familiar pale blond hair.
"The committee on experimental charms tends to run late." His tone tempted Harry to ask further questions, but they had reached the entrance to the main hall. Above the door was inscribed,
"I think Sirius mentioned that your family held a ball at this time," Harry said carefully, remembering Sirius' snorting about the pureblood pretensions. It was a Black tradition rather than a Malfoy one, and Sirius had recollected sneaking down with his brother to watch the festivities which according to him were "archaic and designed to secure them in their superiority".
“Yes, you did, Harry,” Hermione said, her tone firm though not accusatory. “None of this will be without cost.”
"Of course you do. It is not the most exotic blend we have available here but I would be no kind of host if I could not make my guests comfortable." The final word dripped with disdain.
Harry made an impatient noise in his throat but Sirius pressed on. "Do not underestimate Lord Malfoy's influence, Harry. He may not wish harm to his heir but make no mistake, if he can find any way of separating you he will do so and he will have no compunction about destroying you to achieve his end."
In the morning, I am going to return to Godric's Hollow, Harry said to himself. I am going to go from there back to London, where I will spend more time with Sirius, learning properly how to manage the Black properties.
Lord Malfoy stood only a moment wondering what had happened before he turned to Harry, furious, and reached for his own wand.
Harry nodded as his mind whirled. The thought of Draco with another man burned like acid through his body. He wanted to beg Draco not to, with every fibre of his being, but he already knew that Draco did this sometimes, needed this even, when Harry was not there. If it was a simple case of working out his anger, Harry could see how Draco might not want to bring that into the love between them.
When Hermione was finally satisfied, she nodded to Harry. “Ron went to see Sirius, who immediately threatened to charge down here but I think Ron talked him out of it. I don’t know if he convinced Sirius to stick to whatever plan you two agreed, though.”
"It is a great pleasure," Draco said, his eyes intent. "I would wish you to know both aspects of it. I would wish to do everything I have ever thought of with you, to know you as my lover completely. I know you fear the one; very well, let us try the other. You will see the pleasure you give me and you will no longer fear the act. And you should not fear it, Harry," and the rare use of his given name made Harry realise just how serious Draco was. "You should not fear that your own body will betray you."
"You're going to kill yourself," Harry says quietly from the corner behind him. It's the first time he's spoken in days.
Diggory came in. “After several rounds of voting, we have reached a majority decision. Will the accused please rise.”
Sirius' lip curled upward, baring his teeth. "We are all war heroes and he is still on the fringes of society."
"I do not believe I would like to spend much time away from home having only recently returned," she said.
"It must be hard," he said, taking a precise bite of the pigeon pie then reaching for his wine. "To divide your time so. But of course the thrust of politics waits for no man." And then the bastard
“I am not a house-elf,” Blaise retorted. “I am here to show you something I think you need to see. I know all about you and Draco, which I imagine does not surprise you?”
"Thank you," Harry said, relief swelling in him so sweet and sharp he feared he might collapse. "I know how much I am asking of you."
"Harry?" Sirius' face was full of concern. "Harry, at last! I quite feared for you. Ginny told me you were staying at a Muggle hotel?"
And on and on. Harry was not, it must be said, enthusiastic about his entry into politics. He would frankly rather have been on a field facing down a Dark wizard with only his wand in his hand. For a moment he speculated on how a duel between himself and Lucius would go, wondered if it was worth suggesting such a thing despite its illegality in order to resolve this matter once and for all.
The touch of Harry everywhere was the same – so cold it burned Draco's very blood. Draco had torn the veil aside and this kiss was his reward: ash and death and Harry on his tongue.
It was so senseless, that was the thing that shocked him. He had never been unfaithful to Ginny, barely even felt tempted and suddenly this terrible lust had come upon him unannounced and unwanted.
Spelling's was on Knockturn Alley, and Harry folded up the collar of his cloak lest he be recognised. Draco looked at him in amusement.
Pansy snorted and took a long drag on her cigarette. “Honestly, if he didn’t like cock, I’d think you two were perfect for each other.”
Harry smashed their mouth together so violently he almost expected to taste blood. Draco gasped and swiped his tongue along Harry’s. His body was all but shaking.
“Our life,” Harry echoed, delight suffusing his body. He felt powerful, immortal, beloved, and as he dropped to his knees to take Draco’s cock in his mouth, the musk and hardness of him irresistible, he was overwhelmed with a sense of how lucky he was to have such a love.
Harry wore himself out in the days that followed, watching Ginny sleep, comforting James and Albus who were too young really to understand but who knew that their mother was ill and cried for fear of it.
The night before the trial was due to start, Harry was lying awake on the stone floor with only the sounds of Smith’s snoring for company. He and Fawley took turns sleeping, and both had brought books. This must have been the most boring assignment either of them had ever had; Smith had been grumbling about it while Fawley slept. “Three years’ training to babysit a willy woofter?”
Draco, gasping, forced himself to stand. "Yes, Father," he forced out though his eyes watered and his body language was full of misery.
Draco forced himself to stand, ignoring the ache in his limbs and his arse, the pounding in his head and the rush of blood to his cock.  “I need my wand,” he said hoarsely.
Harry felt as exhausted now as he could ever recall. “You did your best for me, Hermione,” he said quietly. “But I had to do my own best, too.”
He turned back. Ginny was staring at a fixed point on the floor. "Will you not come to me this night before you go?" she asked. Her face seemed strained as though she hated herself for asking.
Harry thought of how many times over the last year he had told himself that same thing, how many others had said it, how it had seemed so impossible for so long.
Draco shrugged. "Observation. Of him and of you. He has been your de facto father, no? And you are in many ways a conventional man yourself."
That, combined with the formal charge, made three pieces of good news. Dawlish had gone for a charge of gross indecency rather than sodomy.
Harry’s hand tightened on his wand. He could curse Lucius again, of course he could, but what would it change beyond making his opponent even more determined to destroy him? “You have said quite enough, sir. I must ask you now to leave.”
"You do realise that it is rather the upper half of your face which people recognise?" he drawled. "No matter, Spelling's is very discreet." As if to prove his point at once, Draco knocked on an unmarked door. A panel slid back and a pair of dark eyes was visible for a moment.
I have ruined all their lives, Harry thought, not for the first time. Ginny, James, Albus, Lily – they shall bear the shame of my actions for the rest of their lives. And the others, all the other men like me, I've ruined their lives, too.
"But now there's Lily," he said softly, and Ginny smiled her agreement into his shoulder. "So we'll do what we have to do and then we'll go back to Godric's Hollow." He kissed Ginny's forehead gently and her smile widened.
The Atrium was full of reporters and photographers. Questions were shouted at him as flashes went off again and again; it was all too much. Harry did his best to hold his head high but every instinct was telling him to shrink down. Then they were through the worst of it, to the area cordoned off which only condemned men walked through.
“Hm,” was all the warning Draco got before Potter swallowed him down, sliding his mouth down to the base of Draco’s cock and pressing gently behind his balls with his fingers. Draco gave a gurgling cry and
“You too,” Charlie said helplessly, and off he went, one child clasping each hand, no one remembering to give back the Sneakoscope.
It reminded Harry of Ginny, something in the tone of it which on the surface seemed mild but beneath held a kind of accusation.
Harry managed a chuckle at that. "I am sorry, Sirius. I fear that for too long I denied the things I wanted and now…"
"I fold," Zabini said, smoothly drawing Harry's attention. "Well, Potter. We were just talking about the memorial ceremony, as it happens. We all heard you speak, of course. Responsibility, strength of character. Very important values, to be certain. We must accept all the consequences of our actions, would you not agree?"
"Watch for a while then," Malfoy told him blithely. Bertram threw a look over his shoulder before he fell to his knees in front of Malfoy, sliding his hands up those thighs to pull down Malfoy's trousers. His erect cock emerged and Harry swallowed hard at the sight. Malfoy chuckled and Harry squirmed again at realising that Malfoy had been watching his reaction.
"Indeed. She was delighted to be spared the Black Yule Ball this year. She gets her fill of Malfoys very quickly."
"Yes, mother," said Draco tightly. "But he had already decided on a path for the future and did not require my help."
Draco's fingers stilled. He dropped his hands and leaned forward onto the dressing table, gripping the table's edge tightly. "You are a half-blood," Draco said quietly. "This world is as much yours as is the other, and you know that. But consider your friend, the one who married Weasley."
Many husbands lived apart from their wives, for reasons of business or finance or simple inclination and it would not seem strange. I'll see the children, he told himself. I'll see them all the time. But the words sounded hollow even in his own head. It was their mother, not he, who was the most intimate part of their lives and Harry knew it.
Harry looked at the speaker instinctively. It was the man he'd seen before who'd caught him staring at the Malfoys. Had he crossed the room just to speak with Harry? From a distance he had appeared handsome; this close he was oddly beautiful. His was not a conventional beauty, the angles of his face much too sharp for that, but he exuded a certain magnetism and he was staring right into Harry's eyes.
Aberforth grunted again and turned his back to Harry, whose mind raced. He considered forcing the issue, but he was certain that he would need all his resolve to make it through whatever might be coming.
Hermione just nodded; she had known. He wondered if she had put the pieces together before now, since she had taken it so calmly. Her knowing presence was every bit as familiar and comforting as Ron’s stoicism had been.
Ginny wrinkled her nose. "As though I have not heard the same from every Healer, every relative, every… everyone! Everyone has an opinion," she said, glaring at Harry as though he were responsible for all the evils of the world. "I
Kirke hesitated. “No. It turned up at the house; I assume he left it there but I do not know who for.”
"Harry, my family was one such as a man should dread seeing," Sirius said sharply. "They were racist and prejudiced and brutal and when they passed I mourned none of them."
Harry grimaced, an expression which felt far more natural than a smile. “I have had occasion to learn much in little time.”
Lucius. Harry had been anticipating this; he had already been invited several times to meet but had carefully declined, citing prior engagement after prior engagement. Apparently Lucius had grown tired of waiting, and he, too knew which hotel Harry and Draco resided in. He had been waiting in the sitting room when Harry arrived, dressed in silver brocade robes with the air of someone who could easily wait a year and enjoy every moment.
“Indeed. I have a memory I wish you to see. However, I do not wish to be long parted from it. Do you have access to a Pensieve?”
He was so hard, harder than he had ever been and all he wanted was to touch the rest of Draco's body, all lithe and pale and stretched out for him to
"That does not mean that the witch or wizard is inferior to others, nor that they should be treated as such," Harry protested.
Smith sneered at him. "You've a visitor," he said, reaching for the chains around Harry's wrists. Farley stood close behind him, as though Harry could have summoned the will to break for freedom.
Their skin made contact for the first time. Lord Draco's fingers were long and cool, long enough to curve around Harry's whole palm so that the tips grazed his wrist. Harry gulped involuntarily, looking at the wicked curve of Malfoy's mouth as he ran his fingers gently over the pulse point, once, twice. Awareness flared, so very strange and yet familiar as though some previously unknown part of himself was awakening. He raised startled green eyes to amused grey, but couldn't quite manage look into such a knowing gaze for long. He dropped his eyes again and stood, content to hold on forever just feeling Malfoy's fingers begin to warm against his, gazing at Malfoy's mouth all the while. Harry licked his lips as his own mouth suddenly went dry; Malfoy's gaze dropped to watch the action and Harry's nerve gave out. He yanked his hand away and took a step back, rattled. That was not how two men touched one another.
Kirke had freed Harry's cock from his trousers. Where Bertram had licked and teased, Kirke leaned forward and in one motion swallowed Harry's cock to the root. Harry's hip jerked and he gave a small cry, catching Malfoy's attention. Harry's hands curled into fists at his sides as he forced himself to concentrate on the exquisite sensation of a willing mouth on his body, something he had never dared ask his proper wife to do. He forced himself to look Malfoy in the eyes as desire overcame them both. Harry was panting, Malfoy moaning. He took in all the details of Malfoy's body and desperately ignored the realities of what they were doing there. Then, in another moment, he no longer had to wish away the world.
At last they were making their goodbyes and returning through the Floo to Grimmauld Place. Standing back in the parlour, Harry felt as though he could breathe again for the first time that night.
Harry had sat by her side for the rest of that night and well into the next day until she woke for the first time. He'd held her hand, stroked her face, ignored Madam Pomfrey's insistence that he get some sleep. When Ginny had finally awoken, he had kissed her knuckles and whispered, "I'm so sorry."
"They are my wife's favourite team," Harry told him. Perhaps some little present for Ginny would help resurrect the easing in her temper that Ron and Hermione's visit had seen.
It was good advice, kindly meant, but it made resentment flare in Harry nonetheless. "Is it right that the sacrifices are always mine?" he said harshly.
He knew, of course, what the next hour or so would entail and he was right. Draco drank from his wine goblet and licked his lips after every single sip. He leaned this way and that, revealing strips of skin, and emphasised every word that could possibly be regarded as an innuendo.
Charlie snorted. “Yes, I worked out that there was something you wanted to say.” He folded his arms and Draco was distracted for a moment by the delicious bulge of his upper arms.
"It feels as though I do not," Harry said, raising his head, looking towards Draco once more and taking in the details of that face, imperfect and beloved. "I see you and my very soul leaps within me. It seems to me a great achievement that you have been in the room for the better part of a minute and I have managed not to reach for you. You have a great deal of power over me, Draco, and I fear that you are unafraid of exerting it."
Harry gripped the arm of the couch tight, shoving his feelings down. When the next tot of gin was handed to him he drank it at once. Draco had been methodically stripped naked now. He kept glancing over at Harry for reassurance, perhaps, or maybe in an attempt to connect. But Harry knew his face was like stone and eventually Draco stopped. He had Hastings on the floor in front of him, cock in mouth, and Kirke behind him, opening him up with his fingers. The sight was nowhere near as arousing as that first time. It was only painful as Kirke kissed Draco’s shoulders and tugged on his own cock until he was ready to slip inside. Harry watched it all from far away, a roaring in his ears growing louder every moment Draco kept his eyes closed and Harry his feelings locked away.
Harry swallowed convulsively as Draco slid his dragonhide boots off his feet. He stood there then in his trousers and open shirt, his feet, wrists and throat bared.
Draco’s lip curled. “Fine, Harry. Let me just say, I have slept with considerably more than four people, and that right there? That was the fuck of the year. Maybe the decade.”
Sirius' mouth twisted.  "Far more severe than that, Harry."  Sirius paused for a moment.  It seemed as though he was struggling to go on, emotion choking him.  "They…  They had me taken to Azkaban."
At this Harry fell quiet. He did not know how many others like him there might be, what would happen to them. “What will you do?”
It was Percy. Not a day after Lucius’s threats, Percy lost his position at the Department of Magical Transportation. He was not outright dismissed but rather shuffled to a lower position in a different department – a better outcome than Harry could have expected for him but no doubt intended merely as a first step, to demonstrate Lucius’s sincerity.
Draco would normally have scoffed and said something abrasive but he just couldn’t this time. “Blew my mind,” he said. “Literally. Can’t think.”
Sirius shook his head. "Lord Malfoy is corrupt, cunning, ruthless and smart. His son is but a wastrel. He runs up gaming debts and abuses everyone around him. He is not a person I would wish to see developing influence over you." There was a definite edge to Sirius' voice.
Hermione ignored that. “So you tried to extort money from Mr Potter over a letter you obtained who-knows where, which might have included anything, as you no longer have the letter, and you offer this as proof of some kind of liaison?”
"Your tune has changed in recent years," said a silky voice suddenly from behind Malfoy. Harry had not even noticed that there was anyone else there: Malfoy had seemed to demand all the focus Harry was capable of giving.
"In any case," Lord Draco went on, reaching into a pocket, "here is my card. It is never too late to form an acquaintance. Good evening to you, Mr Potter. Lord Black."
But Katie Bell had been around and done things Ginny Weasley hadn’t even known about until Blaise. She was also too savvy to get it in the papers, but the chat around the pub was telling: Harry Potter? Lives up to the hype.
Draco's mouth curved into that particular smirk which indicated that he was about to say something he hoped Harry would find filthy. "Why, I would have reached for the oil and stroked myself, of course," he said, his fingers caressing Harry's where they lay over his cock. "I would have slicked up my hand and touched myself ever so slowly, hoping that you would come and find me, save me from my frustration."
"I imagine that latter can be the source of considerable controversy," Harry said with something of a sardonic note in his voice.
Harry's hands felt like lead weights hanging from his body as Malfoy slowly moved his thigh back and forth just a little, just enough to force Harry to catch his breath and close his eyes. His blood was pounding, his mind was scrambled, there was nothing real or solid in the whole world except the jewel-brightness of Malfoy burning into his very soul and when Malfoy pressed a kiss to Harry's jaw Harry at last gave in and with a strangled cry, took Malfoy's head in his hands and plundered his mouth.
There were tears in the corner of Harry’s eyes as he gazed up in wonder at this man, the only man who had ever made him furious and desperate and whole. Draco stared back, face alight with happiness.
A mistake, he saw at once. "Oh, indeed, you know Blaise. And Blaise has designs upon you, I suppose you enjoy knowing that."
Blaise’s expression changed again, becoming more thoughtful. “You see it with your own eyes but you will not believe it?”
It took the better part of a fortnight to make the arrangements for the presentation, and longer for Ginny to feel ready to be included. The prevailing wisdom had it that this was still much too soon, but Harry was desperate to get away from London and Ginny had almost matched him in this feeling.
As Sirius had never married, Harry was heir to the Black title and fortune – which brought both freedom and responsibilities. Harry had had the importance of "going to town" for the birth of a child drummed into his head but had had to work hard to convince Ginny this time; she would much rather have gone to her mother at the Burrow. Harry had understood, but convention dictated their actions in this case and Ginny had rather sullenly agreed. Where her previous pregnancies had given her a glow, this most recent seemed instead to have sapped the vitality from her completely and Harry was ashamed to admit that he was looking forward to her confinement, allowing him some time with Sirius.
Malfoy's eyes flickered up to Harry's face, lingering a moment before returning to his cards. "Zabini, Nott, Mr Harry Potter. Consider yourselves acquainted."
Harry had always had more gold than he had known what to do with. His estates generated wealth, he had inherited cash from his father's family and, all things considered, he and Ginny lived quite modestly. The galleons were just sitting there. Harry now had reason to spend them.
"Draco," a voice replied. "Oh, Draco." And then a hand, cold to the touch but tangible and solid stroked Draco's cheek.
"Very good, my lord," Filch was saying. "The chamber on the left is free." He began shooing the boys from the antechamber: Malfoy caught Bertram by the cravat and dragged him through the door.
Harry found himself rather less able to defend himself on that score. "I have not been bombarded with invitations," he said and while it was true it was little excuse. Between themselves there had never been much formality.
In the morning, he washed and dressed, and headed first to Gringotts to convert some of his Galleons into sovereigns, and from there to the hotel to make a payment on his bill. He thought about giving the suite up entirely, but he knew what Draco would make of that and he honestly did not know where they could go from here.
"Good," Draco said, and he opened his legs wider for Harry to settle between. "I got myself ready for you while you were sleeping."
"Indeed," Harry said in a low voice. "And what would you have done if I had not come home in time to find you like this?"
"I like the peace," Harry confessed. "While I have been blessed with many good friends I do always feel the pressure to perform."
They had talked about it, Harry and Hermione, and there was only one answer which would afford them the opportunity to make their case. “Not guilty, Minister.”
The name hit Harry like a blow. He forced his face to remain unchanged as he struggled to cover his emotion. "I did not think that the relationship between Andromeda and her sister was overly cordial."
Lucius looked at his son for a long moment even as Narcissa said, "Tea is a matter of preference, my dear. Exotic blends are all very well but provided the leaves are of a high quality, one may choose a different flavour on any given day."
"There is something I can try to brew," Hermione said at last. "It seems most likely that it might be a potion – there is nothing to suggest that you are under a particular incantation." Hermione knew as many spells to counter such incantations as her husband, who had been Head Auror for three years. Harry wished sometimes that his life might have allowed him to pursue a career in such a field, but he had responsibilities as the Black heir and it was unthinkable for him to enter a trade of any kind.
Draco's mouth was hot and eager beneath Harry's, opening to receive Harry's tongue which swept once across his lips before delving inside. Draco's hands slid over Harry's shoulders to tug at his hair while pulling him closer, urging the kiss on and on. Over and over again Draco's tongue met Harry's, their lips crushed together, their breathing growing ever more ragged. Harry felt as though he were in some state of delirium and as he clutched at Draco's skin, all Draco's games and challenges were swept away at last.
His hair, usually sandy brown, turned gold. The muscles in his back and shoulders, slender and well-defined, moved beneath his golden skin. Then he turned to face Harry, droplets of water clinging to his chest and collarbones.
No one quite knew what to do with Harry after they arrested him. There were holding cells in the Ministry, of course, but given the sheer interest there would inevitably be in this case Dawlish reckoned they were not secure enough and was making some alternative arrangement. Harry was left there meanwhile and could almost feel the anxiety of the DMLE representatives who fluttered in and out of the room.
"Please, you must call me Narcissa," she said, waving her hand, quite a different woman to the coldly formal creature he had met before. He darted a glance towards Draco, but there was no help from that quarter. Just then, though, the lady's husband shot her a look; Harry watched Lady Malfoy see it, frown, and choose to ignore it.
"You came," he breathed, and felt the sharp sting of tears behind his eyes as he looked into the face he had feared he would never see again.
"Harry," she said and her voice was perfectly even. "Harry, it may be a shame and a scandal but if you will not live with me then perhaps we should think of a divorce."
In retrospect Harry should perhaps have anticipated that he would not be the only member of the Wizengamot using the Minister's box that night.
He was almost ashamed of having sent the letter at all. Sirius had a good plan and if Harry were sensible, he would write to Ginny, convince her the break would be good for all of them and thank his lucky stars.
Harry started at the voice and turned; while he had stopped paying attention, Malfoy had appeared behind him. He was all in emerald green tonight and Harry's breath caught at the jewel brightness of him. His heart began to pump faster, alarm filling him, yet the longer he looked at Malfoy the less urgent escape seemed to become. Instead that insidious effect Malfoy had on his senses began to take hold, far more intoxicating than brandy – Harry swallowed the last of his in a gulp, looking away from Malfoy for a brief second before unerringly fixing his eyes on that mouth again, a compass finding true north.
Thus reassured, Harry kissed him frantically. “You were beautiful,” he said between kisses. “Magnificent.”
It was a silver sickle smoothed flat on the reverse side with green enamel forming the shape of a leaf. Surrounding it, an engraved statement of purpose.
Pale skin and pale eyes flashed before him. Harry hesitated. "Terry Boot, though I didn't have much chance to speak with him."
At this Ginny's eyes widened. "Oh," she said, her gaze dropping to the floor. Harry swallowed, waiting for her reaction.
“I am not the beloved hero,” Draco always replied. “No one worships me. Instead, I have the Slytherins.”
Harry had plunged his body into ice cold water and tried to slow his pounding heart, uncertain of everything about himself. But when he saw Teddy again he said only, "There you are, Harry – I was afraid you'd got sun stroke."
"And of course, you are getting plenty of rest I hope, Ginny dear?" Molly fussed. "You had such a difficult time with Lily after all."
Harry wondered how he must look to her, flushed and wild-eyed, and walked in without a word as he tried to compose himself.
"Harry, I do not believe you know this," Remus said, sitting back in his chair. "Indeed, it is not something of which I am proud at all and therefore I do not speak of it. But I think perhaps you will understand. You see, I once left Nymphadora, much in the same way you have left Ginny."
Perhaps the Dark Lord's mistake had been in his scattershot approach. He wanted immortality, blood purity, power, servants. Draco wanted only Harry forever and always.
Harry held Draco for a long time, the two of them kneeling on the dirt floor. Draco sobbed for a while, clinging on to what he had made: Harry so much larger and stronger than him now, by his own design and his self-neglect. Draco had become so thin and he hadn't noticed at all.
Exhaustion and crippling guilt proved quite effective at dampening Harry's overactive libido. Sirius never raised the subject of Harry's whereabouts again, seeming to believe that Harry's guilt stemmed merely from his having left Ginny alone in the house. Harry almost wished that Sirius would press him on the matter, demand answers, force Harry to face what he had done. But Sirius instead fussed over Harry and the boys in lieu of bothering Ginny, who spent most of her time now drugged into sleep.
As it happened, it was Draco who broached the subject first. He'd returned to their suite to find Draco in an affectionate mood. Draco had been lounging on the chaise longue in only trousers and linen, his shirt collar open and his sleeves rolled up.
"Harry," Sirius said, clasping his shoulder, "you know you are always welcome here, so please do not begin another litany of apologies. I'm relieved you have seen fit to come at last." His tone was all reproach and Harry hung his head. "Remus is quite capable of looking after himself while we talk – unless you feel he could assist you in… whatever the matter is?"
The only place Harry knew of where Draco’s demand could be met was the bawd-house he’d been taken to that first night, so long ago. He didn’t even know where it was, precisely and was reluctant to ask Draco since this was something he had asked Harry to do for him. He had thought for a few minutes before sending out his stag Patronus to find Goyle and instruct him to collect them from the Italian Gardens at Hyde Park. He did not know how much Goyle knew about Draco’s living situation and would rather not run the risk of having anyone from the wizarding world find them out.
Sirius looked at him. "There is something else going on, something you're not saying. You cannot confide in me: very well. But do me the courtesy of realising that I see it."
Mercifully, at that moment Draco's mother arrived. "Lucius, you're not torturing the poor boy who has come to celebrate with us, are you?"
When Harry came back to himself, it was to find himself half on top of Draco, half slumped against the edge of the dining table, which was now covered with Draco's semen. His breath still filled his ears, harsh; his heart still pounded.
"You are gone for long stretches of time," Draco replied smartly, "and married besides. Do you think if I were suddenly afflicted with the green sickness of celibacy it would raise no comment?"
Harry tried to stand, but his legs found it difficult to cooperate. The guards at once grabbed him and lifted him up.
"I suppose there was Pansy Parkinson," Draco admitted. "She was more a co-conspirator than a beloved, though. Things didn't quite work, somehow. She left for France under something of a cloud, scandalous wench." His tone was distinctly fond.
"If it causes you distress I will not speak of it," Draco said softly. "I thought it would be but an enjoyable story. I do not think of these things as you do. Seeing you with Kirke - I thought you made a beautiful tableau. It did not give me pause."
Ron and Hermione left via Floo on Thursday morning and, sorry to see them go, Harry contrived to spend the afternoon at Diagon Alley. Madame Pomfrey required various potions and ingredients, and while she had offered to go, Harry had insisted that she remain with Ginny, glad of the excuse to be away from the house while Sirius was out and only his wife was at home.
and a range of slurs. Diggory was shouting, trying to restore order and Hermione was looking down at Harry in horror.
"Ron and Hermione have an occupation and a cause respectively," Harry pointed out. He swallowed hard. What he was saying was true, it was all true, but the fact was that he was trying to leave his wife behind in order to begin an affair proper with a man. He almost wished that she would push her point and prevent him from going – but then he saw in her eyes that she meant to and he felt a flash of fear. Draco had promised him all he had hoped for and he would have it.
"Let me," said Kirke. Harry nearly started – he had forgotten that Kirke was even there. But now the boy reached for Harry's cock, rubbing it through the fabric and Harry could resist his arousal no longer. He had instinctively reached to stop Kirke, but his hand fell limply back onto the chaise. Malfoy was gasping now, Bertram's head bobbing up and down faster. All that skin on display, all that chest, the shoulder where the shirt had fallen away. Sculpted collar bones cast shadows into the hollows they created. Malfoy was perspiring and the fine sheen of sweat made Harry itch to run his tongue over that skin, collect all that evidence of desire and keep it for himself.
Draco's chin lifted. "And yet back you shall go and all shall be as it was, not so? Off you go then, Harry, and I shall go back to my life. I'm sure there's more than one renter in need of a good fuck - enjoy your inertia." And then, with a spin and a crack, Draco was gone.
Sirius snorted. "It is the privilege of the young to be offended when the world does not suit them; older men have learned to live with it."
Draco winced as he recalled screaming at Terry and pushing him out of the Manor. "I was a little upset," he allowed. "You did call out another man's name while I was…"
Harry grinned at the character of the letter. He had looked forward to seeing Sirius, of course, but it did rather leave him at a loose end as he had anticipated spending that evening with his godfather. The hotel suite was not booked until the following night.
"Good morning," Hermione said when he arrived at her home, through the Floo this time. Rose was gurgling happily in her Moses basket, and Harry smiled, warmed by the sight of her.
“Am not,” Draco said at once, sitting up on his elbows to take in the details of Harry’s body again.
Hermione snorted again. "If you can consider equal rights for women anything but the commonest sense!"
Harry touched Draco's face, stroked his thumb over the sharp cheekbone. "I can never love you publicly," he said. "But I would not have it undone."
Hermione, for once, did not interrupt not even to pass judgement. So he told her the rest: Lucius. Kirke. Percy’s dismissal, Blaise’s memory. He omitted only Sirius’s true relationship with Remus which was neither pertinent nor his story to tell.
“It is the only way I can think of to fight your father,” Harry whispered into Draco’s shoulder for what felt like the hundredth time. “It would be a good idea for you to do the same.”
"You make me proud sometimes," Harry said because he wanted to change the subject and because it was true. When Draco let him in, for example. When he truly shared something of himself.
Harry was staring at the ceiling, to take a break from his usual occupation of staring at the walls. He had expected prison to be many things but even more dull than committee meetings had somehow failed to make the list.
"And Lord Potter," she said, offering him her hand to shake. "I recall we became acquainted in Scotland. What a pleasure to see you again."
"Quite so," Sirius said, nodding, ignoring the way Molly's lips had pursed during Arthur's speech. "Indeed I had thought to purchase such a tree for the parlour at Grimmauld Place. But it seemed wasteful as we will not have guests ourselves this Christmas."
And now he was thinking of Draco even here. It was not the suite that had become saturated with Draco after all; it was Harry himself.
Harry shook his head. He felt the calm clarity he’d always felt in battle take over from the shaking furious fear that he was in love with a man who would do this. That was a problem for later. “I am going for that walk, now, Draco. I will leave your wand on the table by the door. If you try to stop me, I promise you, you will regret it.”
Harry trusted Draco in some ways but not with the secrets of another. “Something like that. He also went to great lengths to warn me that your father would stop at nothing to separate us.”
"Zabini actually; but of course we are not formally acquainted," Zabini said. He pulled a fine silver cigarette case from his pocket. "I would offer one to you but I see that you are already indulging. Perhaps you would like to try one of these presently. They are imported from Italy, very fine indeed." He lit the cigarette.
Sirius sighed deeply. Harry wondered if he had managed to drink himself sober. “Nonetheless, Harry, you must give him up.”
Harry placed a gentle hand on his shoulder; Draco shook it off. "They'll never be happy until I marry, you know."
The evening was warm, and Harry had found it pleasant before, but all at once it rather seemed suffocating. Harry stepped further into the gardens, telling himself to stop thinking of Malfoy even as he wondered why he had not yet arrived.
“Having tea with his mother. I thought it best we speak alone.” He gestured towards a chair and Harry’s blood boiled at being treated as a guest in what had become his own home. Lucius clearly noted it, and continued smoothly: “You have made it clear that you care not for aspersions cast upon yourself and I commend you for that. There are always so many whispers at court that declining to give credence to any is most wise.”
Draco raised an eyebrow in lieu of cajoling; he knew she would enjoy it far too much. “Probably not. Do you think I need a manicure?”
Harry was not sure what to say in response. "It was Hermione who taught me to think of such things," he demurred, but Sirius shook his head.
Harry forced himself not to react as his character was thoroughly reviled and misrepresented. He could not stop an angry, shamed flush from staining his cheeks, but he did not raise his head once. The crowd did it for him, calling out their objections to Lucius’s words until Diggory gave up and cast a silencing charm on the gallery so that the Wizengamot could hear what he was saying. Harry wondered what would happen if a mistrial was declared. Would that be the end of it or would he be back here in a month?
Remus shook his head. "Unlikely, Harry, for today at least. I'm in charge of the students of my house; I need to keep an eye on them. But perhaps I could come and visit soon, if Sirius can find space for yet another guest."
That was almost too much. Harry's body jerked against Draco's in response to his low-voiced admission and he bit down hard on Draco's collarbone to keep himself in check. Draco hissed in response and Harry felt his legs moving, coming up so that his feet were planted flat on the bed, one on either side of Harry's thighs.
," and with that Harry surrendered, pitching forward to grasp the hair at the back of Draco's neck tight as he came, hot and furious, deep inside Draco's body.
“I did not trust myself,” he went on. “After all I’d been through, I did not trust that I would not to give them up the moment a return to the clutches of the Dementors was threatened. So I insisted they use Peter as their secret keeper, and sealed their fates.”
It was quite the other way around, Harry was beginning to realise; Harry could not come between Draco and Lucius, not for long. Crabbe’s words so long ago now seemed like a kindly-meant warning rather than a threat.
"Kreacher, what…" Harry began but then all at once Dobby appeared next to Kreacher and Harry was ushered into the house at once.
"Very well. I presume my invitation will arrive once you have confirmed your attendance with the family Matriarch," Sirius said drily.
"They don't have to," Harry said fiercely. Ginny looked up at him, startled. Whatever she saw in his face caused her expression to soften.
The simple declaration moved Harry more than he might have expected: it was nothing he did not know after all. He nodded, half to himself. "Yes, there have been other things that have affected my enjoyment of my time in town. We will have the presentation and then Ginny and the children and I will return to Godric's Hollow and we will stay away from London for a long while." It was the best course of action Harry had been able to come up with.
Harry shook his head. He and Hermione had been through this. It might be possible to show that Draco had been pursuer rather than victim but that would hardly clear his name. He had been in a sexual relationship with another man and it was against the law, no matter the circumstances. The most pursuing this line would achieve would be to drag Draco down with him.
Draco didn’t question his luck, instead choosing to rush through the main office where the majority of Aurors sat completing paperwork and straight to Potter’s office.
Harry nodded as Malfoy's jaw worked as though he was stuck between a number of reactions and finding it impossible to settle on just one.
Harry managed a watery smile at Ginny, frantic for her to believe that all was well even as his own heart raced.
The moment Hermione had Harry alone, she rounded on him. It was little more than he had been expecting.
"Seeing you like this," whispered the shade of Harry, "it's like I've fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares."
The jinx knocked Kirke away from Draco and smack into the other side of the room. Harry was across the room and hauling Draco into his arms and away from Hastings. A trail of saliva connected the boy’s slack mouth with Draco’s cock and Harry found himself shoving Draco into the wall. His grey eyes were wide, he grunted as his back hit the wall and then Harry was on him, hands possessive. He was almost fully dressed while Draco was naked against the revolting wallpaper and it was the only thing he felt he had control of in this moment. He smashed his lower body against Draco, the others in the room forgotten as he kissed Draco senseless, urging his lover to ride his thigh. He hadn’t known what reaction to expect from Draco, had thought he might rebel but instead he gasped and begged.
Blaise returned to his seat with his cigarette and his port. “I see. You intend to make a nuisance of yourself until he – what, takes pity on you? Or throws you a fuck so you’ll leave him alone.”
“No,” Harry said, pulling off his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose in a vain attempt to ward off a headache. “I mean – I knew it was adultery and wrong. But it seemed like the furthest thing from a crime. When I was with him, it was beautiful.”
Remus did not seem convinced, but he let the matter drop as was his wont; Sirius began to chatter about all the diversions London might offer with the winter season beginning, and if he seemed relieved that Harry was not about to become a semi-permanent house guest, Harry did not wonder at it then.
Blaise visibly forced himself to relax. “I suppose I should have expected that,” he said in his usual sardonic tones.
Harry had rather hoped to stand, bow, and have that be the end of the encounter but Lord Malfoy had other plans it seemed. "Yes, indeed," Harry said, quite at a loss as how best to handle this. "And yourself as well, I presume?"
"It is important to carry on the family line," Lucius said firmly. "A man in your position understands that, Harry. After all," he said with a small smirk, "you will inherit not only from your own family but from my wife's as well."
When he returned to the other room, Sirius was laughing with Arthur. Almost the entire clan Weasley had assembled, and there in the corner by her brother Charlie was Ginny.
Lord Malfoy responded in a way Harry would not have expected; he raised the cane he always carried and swept in front of his son. In another motion, he had cracked it full force into Draco's body, winding him.
Harry smiled at her and proceeded into the gathered throng. Many of Sirius's old acquaintances were present. Some he greeted with pleasure and some with mere politeness. But Harry did not see Sirius's jaw actually clench until the arrival of, "Lord Malfoy, Earl of Wiltshire, Lady Malfoy, and Lord Draco Malfoy!"
When Draco came with a shuddering sigh, Harry licked his hand clean. "So beautiful," Harry said. His own cock was pressing hard and insistent against his clothes so when Draco pushed him back on the floor and took his length into that mouth, Harry barely took any time at all to follow Draco into bliss.
There was something to that, perhaps. Harry sighed. "I merely wish to have my wife back. You remember when we used to enjoy one another's company? When we used to talk about sports or some interesting new development in magic or politics?"
“Any time, mate,” Ron said, giving him a soft smile. He nodded at Fawley, flicked his gaze over the still-snoring Smith and quietly retreated down the corridor.
"Ah?" Lady Malfoy scanned Harry from the tips of his dragon-hide boots to the top of his stubbornly messy hair. "Well, such a meeting as this may allow for conversation, Mr Potter, despite the lack of introduction. Tell me, you are here with your lady wife?"
That October in London was very warm. Indian summer meant the days could be spent walking through parks, taking in the Great Exhibition, meandering through the Muggle world.
Draco straightened his cufflinks, examining himself in the large mirror which was in the middle of telling him how attractive he looked. “All the more reason for us to go, don’t you think?
Malfoy let out a deep groan and his fingers tangled in Bertram's hair. Bertram seemed to respond by doing something Malfoy liked even more, causing him to throw back his head. The motion exposed miles of Malfoy's exquisite throat from which he let out a whimper, his hips jerking forward to thrust into Bertram's mouth.
Harry would never want Draco to use Voldemort's blood in his resurrection. Draco already knew that Harry was going to have a hard time forgiving him, but that, that would be too much to ask.
"Right," Harry said, as though it made any sense in the context of what had happened. "Er," he forced out another syllable. It made Lord Draco's expression turn positively sardonic. "Good to see you again, Malfoy."
The moment Draco’s cock stopped pulsing, Harry put his hand, still covered in spend, over Draco’s throat. “I will give you what you need. Only me.”
Long after Blaise left with his memories, Harry brooded on what he had been shown, and all Blaise had said. The thing was, he could not tell himself that the memory had been altered – he knew what that looked like. Nor was it some stage play in Polyjuice – he knew Draco and that had been him.
“Fine, fine,” she said, lower lip sticking out for a moment. “Have you decided who will be the first task?”
Harry knew it had to be a trap, designed to make Draco uncomfortable. However, he could only agree. "I love James and Albus and Lily very dearly. I could not imagine my life if I had not become a parent."
Ginny held up her hand to quell him. "I cannot plan for the future until the sentence is passed. I cannot however see how we could possibly resume our married life as it was before."
“Yeah,” Potter said ruefully. “Some people I thought I could trust and some I never actually touched. You’re only the fourth person I’ve slept with you know. And you didn’t even remember it. Between you and Oliver, I might have got a complex.”
After they had finished, Malfoy had pulled out his wand and cleaned them both up. Now he stood watching Harry dress.
With no small relief Harry and Sirius were able to excuse themselves to greet Remus and Teddy; as usual Sirius fell into immediate conversation with his oldest friend while Harry looked at Teddy.
Draco had the unsettling feeling that this was about to run away from him. “Look I didn’t… not remember, I just didn’t remember and I know that sounds the same, but it’s not!” Damn it, Draco was smooth! Why did it always desert him when he needed it most?
"Fuck me," Draco forced out, sounding as though he were dying. Such coarse language shocked Harry, but not to disgust. Rather, he thought it the most arousing thing Draco could possibly have said.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep, steadying breath. It was easy to forget that Draco’s experiences and the expectations placed on him were radically different from those Harry faced.
Harry would once have been mortified to hear someone speak of him so. These days any number of indignities had been heaped upon him, and he could no longer bring himself even to flinch. He was, though, capable of gratitude when Farley snapped, “Shut it, Smith. You wouldn’t smell so hot either if they wouldn’t let you bathe.”
Draco met his gaze with a whine. Harry wanted to say something about how good Draco looked when Harry had him held down, but instead found himself kissing Draco again, shifting forward until he went from kneeling over Draco to lying on top of him. Harry still had on his trousers and he knew he would have to remove them or ruin them with an unexplainable stain, but for now he instead slid a leg between Draco's parted thighs and slid against him, pulling more desperate groans from Draco's mouth.
Draco acknowledged it with a forced shrug of his shoulders. "You come and go and I try not to grudge it," he said. "I know that for you it is me, only me. But it is a lonely life nonetheless, living a lie. Blaise knows about you though he never voices it. He is the only one but if I were to speak to him of love he simply would not understand. Who else is there? Nott I could not trust. I have to lie to all others I know about the very nature of who I am. I have long lunches with a Pureblood girl whom my mother dreams I will wed. I smile and flatter and lead her to believe I may love her when the truth is that her body repels me."
Bile rose in Harry’s throat. “This isn’t about how much I love you, Draco. This is about what it’s costing everyone else. Percy was the warning shot – Arthur could be next, or Ron—”
"Sorry I'm late," Ron said, not looking up. "We had this wizard cornered in Knockturn Alley, it took… Oh," he said as he shrugged off his cloak and found Harry sitting before him. "Hullo, mate."
“And who lands in the papers more often than I do? Who could wear your clothes more often and drop your name into more interviews than I?”
The evening drew on and darkness fell. Harry smoked and sighed and caught up on reading the papers which would be considered at committee over the next few days. Eventually, though, he tried again to knock on the door.
“I?” Blaise laughed. “My family has an estate in Sicily. I will return to it, marry some local witch with a suitable fortune who is not put off by my mother’s martial misfortunes, and make out of all this quite well. But I would rather not be in the position where I fear to return to what I do regard as my home. Which is exactly what will happen, Potter. I know these people in ways you do not and they are malicious beyond all.”
But it was moments like these when Draco fully appreciated the genius of Pansy Parkinson. “Potter?” she said and gave a burst of genuine laughter. “Potter as fashion icon? Gabrielle, darling, I think all that alcohol has pickled your brain.”
Ginny inhaled sharply at Harry's right. Harry, for his part, stood dumbstruck. This was an exceptionally familiar way to speak with him, implying an intimacy where none existed. Harry's eyes darted around Lucius's face tying to work him out.
Potter huffed out a laugh. “Don’t lie, you quoted it at me last night. All that stupid sex-god stuff.”
"It began at school," Sirius said.  "Remus had always been there.  I used to look at him without knowing what it meant, feel these…"  He waved his hand, trying to find the right word before settling on, "desires."  Sirius smiled a little.  "He was beautiful, Harry.  He still is, to me."
Teddy blushed a little more. Harry looked around quickly; the others were still occupied so perhaps he could get away with asking the other question he so needed an answer to.
Kirke was very talented at what he did, there was no sense denying it. Harry's hips were jerking involuntarily and Kirke was meeting every thrust Harry made, taking him deeper and deeper. Bertram's fingers snaked up Malfoy's body to pinch his nipple and with that Malfoy cried out and shuddered, Bertram's choking making it clear that Malfoy had found release. With that, Harry could hold back no longer and, closing his eyes, he emptied himself into Kirke's willing mouth.
An eyebrow flickered. "I would never miss an engagement, Potter. It doesn't do to let down one's friends."
"I believe young Malfoy to be trouble," Sirius said flatly. "If you are wise you will not allow him the opportunity to prove it."
"An excellent speech, Mr Potter," Lord Malfoy offered. "It is well to remind us all of the importance of the choices we make."
"You are every inch the man squaring himself to face the gallows," Sirius told him, very little humour in his eyes.
"It came on so suddenly!" Harry burst out, relieved at last to be able to speak of this. Perhaps it was by telling a dear friend even part of the truth that he might lance the boil, deprive Malfoy of his power over him. "I was not looking for any such thing, Hermione, I swear it, but now my thoughts, my dreams, everything is changed and I do not want to, I
Draco turned fully towards Harry. "Politics? We are dressing for dinner and you wish to further discuss politics?"
“Your father had Percy Weasley removed from his position at the Ministry,” he told the lump huddled in the bed when he entered the room.
“He’s probably right. They’ll try something else.” He looked at Sirius. “Lucius Malfoy had Percy dismissed from the Department Head position.”
Potter was staring at him now with what from anyone else he might consider a calculating look. “Well, all right, then,” he said. “But only because I wanted to do it again anyway.”
Gabrielle’s cupid’s bow mouth curved into a half-smirk. Someone less self-consciously ladylike would have snorted. “And why would you consider that you and I are on those terms?”
But Lucius was not finished. "Really, Draco, do you truly believe you can convince me to approve of this? You did not wish to marry Pansy Parkinson – such things happen, I did not insist. But you turned down another suitable young lady last week and bring a
"So in fact between school and such visits, Miss Granger as was spent barely any time at all with her family even before she left them behind to spend her life in our world. Well and so, one cannot live forever with one’s loyalties divided and of course she would want to leave the Muggle world behind! But by her very existence, she has exposed our world to an entire Muggle family, who perhaps have friends, who in turn have acquaintances..."
"I don't think Father much cares." Draco shifted. "I might have liked to continue under Professor Snape's tutelage longer, but of course he was lost at the Battle of Hogwarts. Besides, he was only a half-blood and it would not have been fitting."
"Sirius," Ginny returned, smiling. She was obviously tired; even with Harry's assistance she stumbled a little as she stepped down from the carriage.
He couldn’t bear it. Silently, Harry crept from the bedroom into his dressing room, leaving Ginny curled on her side facing away from his side of the bed.
"It is a lesson I have long attempted to impart to my son," Lord Malfoy added. Harry swallowed. "You have children of your own do you not, Mr Potter?"
When Harry reached up Draco smacked his hand away. It was not a playful gesture but one born of equal parts determination and frustration. Draco opened Harry's trousers in seconds and pulled them down his legs only to find boots preventing their being completely shed.
. "Please, Hermione," Harry said and as he raised his eyes to hers again, he felt the weight of frustrated tears welling in his own. "Please, there is no one I rely on more than you."
"Of course," Harry said at once. His pulse quickened a little as he tried to imagine what conclusions Remus might have reached, what conjecture he might have heard.
Draco laughed. "Oh, indeed? And in the Muggle world, are there not lords and servants, rich and poor, prostitutes and those who buy them? They may have different measures of who is deserving and who is not, but are you telling me they are better?"
“‘Loved those of great ambition’,” Draco quoted with a smile. He downed the port all at once and crossed to kneel before Blaise, who opened his legs. Draco placed his palms on Blaise’s thighs. “I’m going to have him, Blaise.”
"It has been but five months, Padfoot," Remus replied, but the reluctant tugging of a smile at his mouth told of his pleasure at hearing he was missed.
"Indeed?" Hermione spat. She glared at him another moment then pulled out her wand. Harry wondered for a moment if she meant to hex him but instead she pointed her wand at the door, whispering the spell that would prevent them from being overheard. "You know that I am thinking of how hurt Ginny has been and yet how staunchly she has defended you against all criticism? I have said not one word of my suspicions to her and yet I can see in her face that she feels she has failed you as a wife?"
Hermione stood up slowly. At least Harry had told her enough that she knew about the blackmail attempt.
"You do not yet know what it has cost," Sirius said sharply.  Harry could make no answer; he fell silent.
Sirius stood abruptly, forcing Harry to let go of him.  "After that it was quite simple.  Remus and Nymphadora took refuge in the country.  She miscarried."
Charlie had a small strawberry-blond child on the end of each arm, obviously the offspring of the eldest Weasley and the elder Delacour. Extremely attractive people, both, and Draco took a moment to study the children’s faces: both likely to grow up pretty. As it should be.
Draco winced a little. He didn't seem to know where to look. "Not- not frequent, per se," he said at last.
Harry looked at him then. His mouth showed a pout but behind that Harry thought perhaps he could see hurt.
"I don't know what to do," he said, embarrassed. Embarrassed for himself, for having Malfoy see him in this state, for Kirke who was little more than a slave to rich men's desires. This was humiliating, all wrong, nothing like he had imagined. He had never wished to see Malfoy on the other side of the room with another man pulling at his perfect clothes.
“I…” Harry had a vague memory of a boy who reminded him of his cousin, who had said something snotty. But they’d never spoken again, that he could recall. “You’ve been holding a grudge since the start of school? Draco, what the devil is
As Harry took a few long, deep breaths to steady himself, Draco curled up around him. He touched Harry’s hair, chest, face as he whispered, “So good, so amazing, Harry, yes.”
Yes, yes, that, anything, touch me everywhere. Draco couldn’t manage the words so instead he grabbed Potter and pulled him back into a kiss. Potter held onto him and Draco could feel his arm flailing, heard various items go flying off the desk but didn’t have time for more than a moment’s interest in Potter’s wandless magic before he was being shoved back on the desk.
The committee was comprised, quite deliberately, of many people with different areas of interest and different agendas. Lord Malfoy was speaking in support of Lord Blishwick, and those two seemed to have Lord Scrimgeour firmly on his side while the opposite case was being argued by Lord Prewett and Lady Longbottom. Harry had not seen Neville's grandmother in many years and, despite age which would have bowed a Muggle woman, she was still proud and fierce as she ever had been.
"You can keep yourself from falling?" he asked. At Harry's jerky nod, he smiled and brought his little finger to his mouth, fellating it as surely as he had Harry's cock. Then his mouth was back on Harry's shaft and his hand was around Harry's testicles again. Harry gave himself over to the pleasure of it, the wet heat of Draco's mouth, the persistence of his nimble fingers. Draco's hand slid further back and then that wet finger was teasing at Harry's entrance, sliding around it and playing with it. Harry gasped and almost wanted to say no, not that, but the pleasure was all too intense. The finger slipped inside. Harry groaned. His senses were overloaded; there was ecstasy to be found in the way Draco worked his body, agony in the tension of his arms keeping him in position.
“You’re telling me,” Draco wailed, “that last night I fulfilled the fantasy of years and got you to go to bed with me, but I was so drunk I barely remember any of it?”
"It was more difficult after school," Sirius went on.  "We could still see one another, visit, but it was harder to find places to be alone.  We wrote often because we missed each other so terribly.  I was nineteen when my parents discovered us."
“No, of course,” Draco said, waving his hand as though dismissing the unimportant. “You know her much better than I do, of course. It’s just that, well, women can be a little strange about their ex-boyfriends, you know?”
“Visiting for a few weeks, but who knows what he could accomplish in that time,” said Pansy. “He does have a certain
Harry remembered the way he’d crossed the room, the way Draco’s body had felt beneath his fingertips. There was no denying it now.
Smith was a Hit Wizard; highly trained and competent. But Hermione had been in the war. He eyed her and raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. “I intended no disrespect.”
Potter had kindly cast cleaning charms on them both and handed Draco his clothes while he tugged on his own. Draco, however, could still barely feel his limbs and was enjoying a little more afterglow.
The summary defiling of his childhood haven had left Harry with a bad taste in his mouth. He had planned to visit Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour before returning home but now desired only the quiet and solitude of Sirius's study.
That night, Harry could not sleep. The quarrel with Ginny weighed on him; she wanted him to be nicer to her mother, she wanted him to show more genuine interest in her and their family, she wanted him to show her more understanding. But Harry was
The courtroom was quieter that morning. Harry assumed the Minister had forbidden the public to enter given the chaos of the day before.
How was it possible to feel so completely himself with Draco if Harry had to sacrifice so many of his best qualities in his name?
The pressure of his hand around his member made Harry gasp and his hips jerked to thrust into his hand before he could stop it. It felt so good, too good, to lie back and touch himself, thinking of that mouth, that luminous skin. At first Harry tried to keep images of Ginny at the forefront of his mind as though he could ameliorate this sin, but hazel eyes kept turning grey, red hair to blond. Harry tightened his hand around the head of his cock and imagined Malfoy's fingers on him the way they had been on the boy in the alley. He came immediately, all over his hand, with a shock of disgust hard on the heels of the pleasure.
Ginny turned her head slightly to look into the room. Harry looked at the familiar curves of her face in profile. Strange, he had never thought of how he would be without her and yet this sudden question – which he must concede she was well within her rights to contemplate – had his head in a spin.
If Sirius had said something of the kind Harry could have retorted but this was Ron and Harry didn't know what to say.
Draco shifted. "He has always known about me. I made a point of telling him when I was younger. A kind of rebellion, I suppose."
Draco had always desired Harry, wanted to conquer and cherish, to defile and deify. But as his childish whims had given way to something far deeper and infinitely more terrifying, Draco found that he also desired the company of a man who could sympathize with him, whose eyes would reply to his. Harry had proven himself so many things: gentle and courageous, possessed of a captivating as well as of a caring spirit. His tastes were so different from Draco's own and so it always meant that much more, when Harry would deign to approve or amend Draco's plans.
"If you like," said Harry, "but only a few days. I prefer to be back in my own space before committees resume."
but Mr Lynch merely smiled. "Of course, it takes time to adjust whenever one spends long periods outside London."
Draco's passage was so tight that Harry feared he would last barely a moment before he reached completion. His cock was clasped and gripped; he shivered and ground his teeth and thrust again, watching Draco's eyes roll up in his head. And then the world was heat and sensation, Draco's body and his own fusing into one being. Draco met his every thrust and cried out incoherently for more, more, more. Harry gripped Draco's hand as hard as he could – it was his anchor to reality, the only thing keeping him tied to the world as his blood boiled, his veins burned. That hand and those eyes, never looking away from his own.
Harry nodded jerkily in acknowledgement. Was that to be it? A return to the fold, his time away considered a temporary aberration, some episode of whose effects he had been cured?
"People are human," Harry said quietly. "Even I, though the world has scarce allowed me to be so. Sometimes our feelings get the better of us, sometimes decisions do not seem so black and white as you would paint them."
The Deathstick he won duelling with Harry for practice. Harry didn't use it, never used it, had thought it destroyed but tools that powerful were not so easily unmade.
In a sustained military campaign, the best advantage is a strong ally.  Which is one reason why Draco had made certain to stay close with Pansy for all these years. Standard Slytherin protocol.
"There you are!" Ginny said, all smiles when Harry returned. "The last of the guests just arrived so I believe we may proceed." She lowered her voice to say, "The Malfoy family is here – did you know Sirius had invited them?"
Ron looked well, the warm sun beginning to paint even more freckles on his face. Hermione's hair kept escaping from its elegant knot and Ron kept reaching out to straighten it for her the way he had in school. Harry's chest ached a little at the easy affection between them. It had been that way once for him and Ginny.
An excellent question. It felt as though about a year had passed since Lucius had handed Harry his card in the committee room.
The hands Harry had raised automatically to steady Malfoy had somehow become entangled in his cloak; Harry held handfuls of Malfoy's clothing and really wished for nothing more than to have it fade away and find the freedom to run his hands over the flat planes of Malfoy's chest. For now he explored the heretofore undiscovered country of Malfoy's back as the kiss went on and deepened, Harry now meeting every thrust of Malfoy's tongue with his own, following it back into Malfoy's mouth when it had the temerity to retreat. Malfoy's hands moved from the back of the carriage to Harry's shoulders; Harry's mouth moved to do what he had longed to before and charted the length of Malfoy's long, beautiful throat.
"It must not be!" Draco screamed and at last the lightning swelled and burst free, crashing out in all directions, filling the whole room with light and electricity and sending Draco tumbling away from the body and away from consciousness itself.
She cleared her throat. “Esteemed members of the Wizengamot,” she said, stalling, “I suggest to you that your duty is simple and clear. This case is in short nothing more than a collection of innuendos and entirely hinges on a memory taken from a witness who never testified – who has made no statement, nor presented himself for questioning. The defendant speaks of love, not indecency. Given his record, which Lord Malfoy dismisses as irrelevant, it behoves us to take him at his word. In making judgement, members of the Wizengamot, you are called to act not upon suspicion or prejudice, but upon an examination of the facts, and on the facts, I respectfully urge that Mr. Potter is entitled to claim from you a verdict of acquittal. Thank you.”
“Before you start, Potter,” Draco said, but he didn’t get any further before Potter had caught the front of his robes and hauled him into a kiss.
So, I missed a couple of posting dates. My apologies. The ups and downs of lockdown hit me with a really big down. But I'm back and posting is almost complete! Hope you enjoy the penultimate chapter.
"You are anxious to return to town," Ginny acknowledged. "I never thought you would become so involved in politics."
Blaise lit the cigarette hanging from Draco’s mouth. “You always were good at detecting those interested in the Greek perversion.”
"I want you," the memory of him said to the gasps of those assembled in the court. Harry let his eyes close so he couldn’t see his own face, so full of emotion, or Draco’s tensed body, the lines of which could be terribly misconstrued.
Harry missed Draco but had no idea what to say to him. His head was so full of contradictions that he could barely think, and the Draught of Peace had done nothing to soothe his anxiety. Perhaps he had taken it so often before that he was now immune. Or perhaps this was simply the worst it had ever been.
"If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other." Rage and love, fear and strength, wands and scars. Potter and Malfoy. Draco lowered his wand after a moment, a heartbeat long enough to ensure his point was made. "Beware what you try to keep me from. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand."
The carriage jerked slightly as the horses negotiated the corner onto Oxford Street, the sunlight on the brisk spring day illuminating the elegant facades of Grosvenor Square. Inside the carriage, Harry kissed his wife's temple gently. "You see? We've arrived in London. We'll be there soon."
Once the chains had been removed, Harry rubbed at his wrists. The manacles had chafed at the skin and he had sores where they had been.
"Oh, they hushed it all up," Draco snapped, "said he froze to death. But he was a wizard. All it would have taken to save him was a warming charm!" He was trembling now. Harry held him tighter.
"Of course," Harry said quickly. "Of course you are." He hated himself for it but said it anyway: "Let me fear losing you a while longer." He kissed her as he had intended to the first time, gently on the forehead. Ginny looked up at him again and then swiftly away.
“I am sure.” Ginny’s frown remained until Harry pressed her for more details of the children’s lives and she allowed herself to be diverted. Perhaps she did not wish to know any more than he wished to tell her.
Sirius nodded. "The Boneses only receive him because he retained his place on the Wizengamot. His family is among the darkest. The Ministry have been trying for years to confiscate their library of dark texts but somehow the Aurors are never able to find it when they search."
Ginny watched Charlie go for just a moment then looked at Harry and suddenly the sadness was gone. Her expression had turned fierce and blazing; she had steeled herself for this.
Sirius laughed again, sharp and hurt. “A Malfoy, of all people! They are all cruel, Harry, even the ones who are not outright evil. Abraxas Malfoy was well-known for spit-roasting a house elf who displeased him over his fire! Morpheus Malfoy earned his nickname by inventing the Draught of Living Death, which he used liberally on all his political opponents.”
Harry fiddled a little with his watch chain. "Ginny, I am restless here and I fear I am making you unhappy. That is the last thing I want. I have been fractious and I have been treating you unfairly in consequence, and I apologise."
,” said Harry and at once Kirke legs locked together. He fumbled for his own wand but Harry merely flicked his once more. “
"Quite." Harry remembered him now. He had been thin and sarcastic and had taunted other students; Harry had not developed friendships with such people.
Given that Pansy had once drunkenly confided that half the reason she’d married Neville was because even after two years they were still on a twice-a-day sex schedule, Draco could only imagine that this disruption was not going down well with her at all.
"And here I offer you the opportunity to change their minds," Draco stormed, pulling his trousers up his legs, "and you dismiss it out of hand."
"Yes," Harry said. "Yes, and I think your father knows it. He says things to me that he should not."
Kreacher’s muttering filled the hallway and Harry opened the door to the parlour a crack so he could see into the hallway.
Harry's breath caught as Draco efficiently undid his trousers and slipped his underwear down. His cock sprang free, already hard, and Draco weighed it in his hand. Harry closed his eyes against the pleasure, digging his fingers into the billiard table, grateful that Draco had known he would not be able to stand for long.
The Apothecary was one of the first shops after the Leaky Cauldron so Harry made sure to visit there first. Madam Pomfrey had given him a written list, and it was merely a case of handing over the list and the Galleons. He smiled at the boy behind the counter and turned to leave. It was then that he heard a drawling voice so familiar it might have been that of his dearest love despite his only having heard it the once before.
"In some ways," Harry acknowledged. "He was as you know very close with my parents before they passed away."
"Please," Draco sobbed, his muscles squeezing down all around Harry who could bear it no longer and came inside his lover's body. He closed his eyes just for a moment but when Draco cried "No!" he opened them again at once, so vulnerable and open to anything Draco might ever choose to ask of him.
Harry sighed. “I do have to go. It would not look good to miss the first day of sessions. But perhaps you could meet me for lunch?”
For those keeping track, this is the last of the previously-posted chapters. It's all new material from here on out!
“You always choose everyone else instead of me,” Draco said, soft and self-pitying. “And you’re going to do it again.”
As the Chair brought an end to the debate, Harry looked up to find Lord Malfoy's gaze locked upon him. Harry returned the appraisal for a long moment then turned deliberately away.
Draco was checking him for wounds or some such but at this, his eyes narrowed. “And where did you spend the night?”
Draco laughed harshly. "I will never make my father proud. I had my chance in the war, but I refused to do as he bid."
Molly retired early that night and Harry breathed an inward sigh of relief. He cared for the woman, truly. Her kindness in his younger years had earned her a special place for him. But since he had married her daughter, he had come in once too often for the kind of ‘advice’ she offered her sons and it was hard not to see it as an imposition.
Yet the words lingered in Harry's mind. He knew that no one could possibly understand or support this relationship, but he had allowed himself the luxury of choosing not to think on it. He was aware, however, that their time together was stolen and that the world they had created for the two of them could not last forever.
Harry had never liked him. He hated that this man was here for this, that he’d been quicker than Sirius’s attempts to save them both.
Draco could hardly deny the charge. “Well,” he began in a confidential tone, leaning in. For a moment he breathed in that masculine scent and almost became distracted – but no, he was pursuing a higher cause today. “I heard a rumour that Wood and Potter parted ways due to lack of common interest and you were, er, comforting Potter in his hour of need?”
Zabini shrugged. "I thought you would be. Draco is so tiresome these days – I had rather hoped that you would be able to divert him." The tone in which Zabini said the last two words made Harry's hackles rise.
“I won’t beat around the bush, Potter. A formal complaint has been lodged against you with the DMLE.”
"Harry," said Sirius hesitantly, "do you not remember Lord Draco's father? He was in the Inner Circle."
Once they were gone, he allowed himself a long, shuddering breath, pulling the summer air deep into his lungs.
The proceedings snapped back into focus dramatically when a man to whom Harry had never spoken before smirked a little and said, "Mr Potter. We meet at last."
Victoire took it and giggled when it started to hiss. Once the children were safely distracted, Draco turned his attention back to Charlie. “I have a confession,” Draco said. “I came looking for you.”
Draco's mouth curled unhappily. "I do not believe anyone has ever ignored me so effectively, before or since. Excepting my father, of course."
Harry looked between the three of them. Something was happening here that he did not understand. "We are responsible for all the consequences of actions we make," he said finally.
Hermione rose. She was clearly startled by everything Harry had said. Her entire statement would have to be rewritten, no doubt. What could she say?
Pansy rolled her eyes. “And I found out last night when Neville was leaving for the pub. ‘Cheer Harry up after the break up’ was all I got, and I would have told you that then, only you weren’t answering when I called.”
Potter groaned and pulled his mouth off Draco and just looked at him for a moment, splaying his hands across Draco’s ribcage. “So perfect,” Potter said, bending down to tug a nipple with his teeth. Draco gave a choked sound, his cock beginning to leak.
Ginny had been gesturing in her excitement; she pulled her hands back into her lap, staring at Harry. "I haven't thought of for some time," she said, picking at the cloth of her skirt. "There were so many other things to consider."
Harry watched Draco curl his hands around the table's edge just before he gave in to the instinct overwhelming him and snapped his hips, pulling back and bucking forward with barely a thought. Draco's whine urged him to do it again, and again, to fuck him furiously as Draco clutched and cursed and grunted. Harry watched all the muscles of Draco's back move under his skin. He wanted to reach forward, sink his teeth into that shoulder blade, but he was too far gone to change the angle, to risk any movement more than the inward-outward thrust of his cock into Draco's greedy hole.
A woman about Harry's age looked around from behind Mr Bones; Harry dimly remembered her as their daughter, Susan. Ginny wrote to her from time to time, so Harry made a point of speaking to her now.
"Please, do watch," Malfoy said as Bertram leaned forward and took Malfoy's cock in his hand, guiding it to his mouth. Malfoy's eyes grew lazy, pleased. Obscene wet slurping sounds filled the air as Bertram worked Malfoy's cock. Harry writhed, uncomfortable as his trousers grew tighter.
“Stop that,” said Draco irritably. “We all know you can speak English perfectly well, and neither of us here finds that accent sexy.”
Then Draco gripped Harry's hair hard, pulling his head back, his mouth away. "Do you want to fuck me?" he said.
"Ginny," he said at once, forcing himself to be gentle as he took her hand. "We are not being kind to each other. You know we are not. Let us give one another room to breathe. You are right – you have changed and I have changed and I feel we must each of us confront the changes within. Then, perhaps, we will be better able to take pleasure in each other's company."
Sirius nodded.  "Do you truly believe," he said, coming to sit next to Harry at last, "that Draco Malfoy would do the same for you?"
"Look," Draco ordered Harry and he complied, watching Draco part those perfect lips, stretching them around Harry's cock. In this moment he was lovelier and more obscene even than Harry had been able to imagine. His cheeks hollowed as he sucked, his eyes on Harry's own the whole time. His grey eyes were devoid of their usual wicked gleam, instead glazed with desire as though Draco was unable to see Harry despite gazing right at him, as though he were unable to see anything at all.
Harry had written but a few lines to his wife, advising her that he had taken a discreet hotel and would be gathering his thoughts before contacting anyone. The letter for the boys had been a little longer, explaining that he would be away on business but would visit them very soon.
There were many rooms in the club, most filled with card players, another with men talking. Harry followed the soft sound of piano music to a room at the end of the corridor. A man was singing there, a German aria. Harry took a place by the door, opting to allow the music to fill his senses in lieu of trying to make conversation. The air in here was cleaner and Harry breathed it gratefully. His brandy was empty; another seamlessly took its place and Harry drank that too, his nerves steadying. He had thought earlier that he had caught sight of that other friend of Malfoy's, the stringy looking fellow, but he had not seen him since. He was relieved to think he might have been mistaken.
Harry spent most of his time on long walks through the countryside. There was a thriving wizarding social scene to be found but Ginny eschewed it at Molly's insistence and Harry felt uncomfortable without her. It was London all over again, Ginny essentially indisposed and Harry left whiling away the time.
Remus nodded. "Occupation, Harry. You are quite right. It will do wonders for you. I am always at my best when I am able to work."
“Mrs Weasley, do not force me to silence you as well. Mr Potter, this has been a hard case for us given your standing in the community, your past services to wizardkind and your connection with several prominent families. However, it seems beyond contestation that you have made explicit solicitations to at least one young man. And while many were prepared to accept the truth of your… feelings,” he managed, the word barely making its way past the man’s throat, “we also believed that you had attended bawdy houses. Someone who could do that must be dead to all sense of shame.”
Harry heard about it from Ron, who wrote him a letter with a few bits and pieces of news but who was really writing to ask if Harry had heard any rumblings about this at the higher levels, did he know the reasoning? He also invited Harry to dine with he and Hermione but Harry didn’t dare in case he let his own complicity slip. He did though force himself to attend the all-Weasley intervention meeting where the whole family came together to talk through Percy’s next moves. There was less pressure on Harry with so many voices in the room wanting to be heard. Percy seemed humiliated by the whole thing, always proud, and kept asking everyone to hush. Ginny had brought the children, who clustered around Harry to envelope him in their joy at seeing him. How much the boys had grown without him filled him again with guilt and self-loathing even as the sight of them lifted his spirits. So many feelings flowed through him that he recalled Hermione listing everything Cho Chang must have been feeling after Cedric’s death and how he’d struggled to understand how one person could feel so many things all at once. He understood now, when there was no friend to talk him through it; Hermione would not look at him while Ginny seemed near tears more than once. Ron was too focused on his brothers to notice, which was Harry’s only saving grace.
Sirius had been quite the rebel in his early years, or so Harry had heard from those who had seen it. But there was little evidence of it left in his character beyond a certain restlessness that Harry could see was what drove him into gaming hells and gentlemen's clubs. Idleness was unnatural for all of them.
“No, indeed,” Sirius agreed. “The Malfoys of the past have been exacting, intelligent and quite ruthless. Draco by all accounts is a spoiled child who likes to pull the wings off flies.”
It stung, particularly after Harry's own determination to remain faithful to Draco despite everything. But this was nothing he had not known or could not have surmised. He reached out to stroke Draco's arm. "Are you not happy?"
"You should think about what you're doing," he said to Draco, which Draco thought was funny because Weasley had never seemed to find Draco capable of sound moral judgement before.
When Harry came back to himself, Kirke was wiping his lips and Malfoy was looking at him with that terrible knowledge in his face.
That was not even the worst of it. The day after the nightmare began, an elegant eagle owl arrived bearing Harry a missive in fine cursive. Luckily it came straight to him, obviously having been instructed to deliver it direct rather than allow house elves or other household members to accept it on his behalf. Harry did not need to see the Malfoy seal to know who it was from.
“I am afraid that my learned friend is reading in double-meanings where none exist,” Lucius said smoothly. “The provision he refers to would merely permit the reclamation of important wizarding sites lost in witch hunts and other aggressive Muggle incursions into our way of life. Further, it would compel anyone taking such action to provide a similar accommodation for the dispossessed.”
The stronger wand was not enough. Draco knew that, as Harry had known that. He himself had to be stronger, had to overcome the loss and the silence and twist the world into being as he would have it be.
His father was narrow-minded. That was a gross understatement. He had only ever seen idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. He had failed Draco repeatedly.
The door opened. An unhealthily thin, rodent-faced man stood there dressed in a suit he clearly believed to be fine, but looked far, far cheaper than anything either of his guests would have considered. "My lord!" the man said. "Come again – and with a friend. Do enter."
"I really wish you would cease from harping on that point," Draco snapped. When falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of happiness?
Not long after that, the other guests began arriving. Luna gushed over her god-daughter at length and Ginny smiled to see it. Seamus did his duty by the family before heading straight to the punch; Parvati had brought a few gifts for the children. As the marquee slowly filled, Harry watched Ginny carefully for signs of strain and told himself off repeatedly for wondering when Malfoy would appear.
Kore looked only slightly disappointed. "In any case, we should be going or we shall be late for our treatments this morning and Mr Urquhart was
"You'll be all set to begin Healer training, then?" he asked, the kind of question family members are expected to use to break the ice.
Ginny was exhausted but she was smiling as she lay back against the pillows, so strong, always so strong.
Malfoy climbed in after him, closing the door and issuing a sharp, "Drive on!" The carriage lurched into motion. Harry could not bring himself to look at Malfoy now, and stared blindly out into the gas-lit streets until abruptly the blind was pulled down in front of him.
Malfoy responded to the kiss by fisting his hands in Harry's hair, gasping for breath, words like "Yes" and "So good" and "Please" all spilling from his mouth. Harry did not dare explore Malfoy's body though he was desperate to touch him – the thought of running his hand over flat chest or wrapping a hand around another man's cock was just too, too much. But this, kissing him, letting Malfoy slide his jacket off and work at exposing as much of Harry's skin as possible, this in itself was enough to make Harry feel as though the whole world were breaking apart.
Potter looked embarrassed. “We hadn’t had sex for a long time. And when we talked about it he said he was really sorry but he just wasn’t that into sex anymore. I knew it had to be me and he was just too kind to say so.”
