“It’s not you against the world, Harry. It never was.”
The taste of Draco’s mouth against his is just a faint memory in the heavy darkness of the corridor. He can hardly remember what compelled him to sneak into the Slytherin dormitories that night, to find Draco’s bed, to lay beside him and say
Draco cannot pinpoint when this changed.
Draco whispers, his voice choking. Harry goes still, his eyes wide for a moment, filled with surprise, before relaxing into a slack expression. Draco wills Harry to move to the door, every second filling his lungs with pain like a thousand sharp needles. Harry takes a reluctant step backwards, then halts. A vein in Harry’s forehead pulses. Draco realizes with a sick feeling of horror that he’s fighting the curse.
Draco Malfoy is glaringly absent from the funeral. Supposedly he went back to You Know Who, Snape too, though it’s only a rumor. Ginny doesn’t really care. She only cares about Harry.
Hermione almost mentions this to Ron, which would unravel the entire encounter with Pansy, and her thoughts, her questions. But in the face of her beaming husband, they pale and shrink, like cobwebs that had once held a nasty spider turn to dust in the shadows.
Is it everything Draco ever imagined? Is it the unfulfilled hope he’s always held on to as his world burned down in front of his eyes? Is it the beautiful, enchanting happy ending he’s always wanted?
They stare at each other in pensive silence before Ron yawns big and loud. “I dunno what’s going on here, love, but I need to go to bed. If anyone can figure this out, you can. And you will, but not tonight.”
“Draco—”
“Good morning,” Harry had mumbled, stretching. He remembers how Draco had glanced away, frowning, his shoulders tense. It was an unmistakable sign. “Is everything alright?”
“Why that’s wonderful news! If only Eighth Years were allowed Prefect privilege, I am sure you would be made one again!” Mrs Weasley exclaims, kissing her son on the cheek. “And what about you, Miss Granger?”
“That’s not true, Harry.”
Harry shrugs. “Why not? It doesn’t have to be holding hands. Say, why don’t you come with me to Slughorn’s Christmas party? I need a date anyway.”
Hermione takes a sip of her tea and says nothing, her hand straying to her stomach, which has started to grow exponentially larger every time he sees her. She gasps suddenly and beckons Harry closer.
“Pansy is here,” he protested.
“We should talk about it,” he says quietly. “We’ve been putting it off for a while but now…”
“If only that were true,” Harry says quietly. “
“None of your business,” Draco retorts sharply.
“But why didn’t you take Charms? You told
“Hermione? What is it?” Ron asks in a hushed voice, following after her. He finds her in their joint office in the attic, her face hovering over their Ministry borrowed Pensive. She has a strange smile on her face that the glow of the water illuminates in an eerie blue, the blue of past voices on the wind, lost footsteps at the door, forgotten moments in time.
“I see,” Harry says quietly. He lifts Draco again, and they walk out of the bar and behind the building, waiting for a few stray Muggles to disappear. “Hold on, Draco.” A hand squeezes his arm reassuringly before Harry braces himself for the dizzying Apparation.
It is Valentine’s Day. He has not been on a proper date in years. Is this a proper date? He has been around Draco many times, though always with other people. Their friends have been waiting for this to happen. Everyone says it was inevitable. Harry never saw it.
Draco loves to ride Harry, and it’s even better when he cannot focus, cannot move, cannot do anything except take Pansy’s cunt in his mouth and fuck her with his tongue, all while Draco has Harry inside of him, making Harry shudder and groan, his arms clutching the couch as if he were in pain.
Harry feels relief first. No one saw them. But then an almost paralyzing anxiety spears through his stomach, and he mutters a quick excuse and races after Draco, hoping he can still catch up to him.
He remembers what Hermione said earlier.
“Fine,” Draco says. “If you were in Slytherin, would things be different?”
“Hermione,” Harry says, cutting her off, and the seriousness in his eyes washes away all doubts. “I really can’t tell you.”
They stare at the ground, an awkward silence ensuing. Harry briefly remembers his first visit to Diagon Alley, when he was only eleven, and had met Malfoy buying robes. He realizes now the multitude of things he said and did that would have offended someone like Malfoy, who had grown up in such an old fashioned world.
“You should tell him you won’t be a secret anymore! Back in school it was different, there was a war, and lives were at stake. But now? What excuse does he have?”
Hermione looks at him questioningly. “How did you know?”
Harry smiles and it’s twisted with bitterness. Draco’s heart pangs. “But that’s exactly what I want. I don’t want to be
Harry laughs softly, shaking his head. “I couldn’t ask for better.” He looks at Ron seriously. “Thank you. I don’t say it enough.”
“A memory.”
Ron grins. “Well, this is certainly a surprise, and a welcome one too. Is that a new suit?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks, narrowing his eyes.
Nearly midnight.
are the unspoken words Pansy does not need to say; he sees them on her face.
“Pansy, my love, can you come here?”
“Sometimes I wonder if I made a mistake,” Harry says quietly.
His legs fall helplessly open, shaking, his mouth open, gasping for breath, his muscles seizing up as his orgasm floods his body, pulsing deep inside until he cannot see, he can only call out Harry’s name and lift his hips up into the burning heat of Harry’s mouth, who swallows, his throat working, the vision beautiful in Draco’s half-intoxicated state.
“I better get some sleep too,” Ginny says after a moment, then heads to the girl’s dormitories with a quiet good night.
and I can’t do it? I—”
Pansy smiles, and allows Harry to slip an arm around her waist. She looks at him seriously. He studies her arched brows, her full lips, slightly parted, and her dark brown eyes that are almost black, the same color as her hair.
Harry’s eyes flash. “That’s rich, coming from you.”
He hunches over, the heels of his palms pressed against his eyes, barely containing his sobs. Ginny wants to comfort him, but she knows with her unswerving certitude that this is something Harry must do on his own.
“You and Lavender?” Harry asks with an amused smirk.
“As well as can be hoped.” She hesitates, looking at the door to the back of the shop where the fitting rooms are, and where Harry assumes Malfoy must be getting fitted for new robes. “We are very grateful for your testimony at our trials.”
“She has a point,” Ron mutters, blushing when Harry raises an eyebrow at him. “Look, Harry, you’ve been pretty out of it lately. Ginny needs a friend, and you two were always close. I’m sure you’re going through a lot, what with Dumbledore and the memories, and I don’t want to take that away from you mate, but sometimes all you really have are the friends you make. It’d be a shame to lose them.”
She keeps praying until she falls asleep, even though she knows with a damning certainty that Harry won’t hear it.
He is ashamed of himself for choosing someone who could not even choose him back.
Harry shrugs. “Can’t get them all the time.” He hesitates. “And I think...I think it might have some side effects, from relying on it for so long.”
A small cauldron is whisked onto a hook that protrudes over the furnace. Lucy drops in a sprinkle of what smells like lavender, stirring clockwise. Harry hoists himself up onto the edge of the counter.
“Is someone making the choice for you, or are you making the choice because of them?”
“Why not?”
But usually, Hermione slept up here in Sirius’ room because Harry could hardly think about Sirius since his death, while Harry and Ron slept on the couches downstairs in the living room. Draco always took Regulus’ room. Perhaps it reminded him of the Slytherin dungeon. Perhaps he just liked to be alone.
“Then what is it like?”
“It’s my fault,” Harry says darkly. “It’s my fault he’s dead. It’s not safe for you to be around me.” He looks at her for the first time and his eyes are storming, the green flash of a thundercloud. “There’s a war coming, Ginny.”
He glanced at the door across the hall.
Hermione nods energetically, her mind naturally filtering through the necessary next steps to coordinate the raid. She draws up her calendar and list in the air with her wand and jots a note.
Draco’s too busy looking at Harry to notice Hermione narrowing her eyes at Draco briefly, before continuing to argue with Ron.
“You mentioned side effects?” Draco calls out. Even younger Hermione turns to look at him, puzzled. Just a moment ago he had seemed against the topic.
With a wave of his hand, he lights the end of the cigarette. A trick Albus—his father—taught him years and years ago, so it feels like another lifetime altogether. His father…
“You don’t love me,” Pansy says after a long drag, the smoke curling up into the night sky. When Harry refuses to answer, she continues, shaking her head. “You don’t understand. You and Draco, you have that love which no one can take away. It runs deep. It’s not just sex; it’s more than sex. But I don’t—I can’t have that with you, or with him. I love both of you, but it’s a passing love.”
Draco smiles lazily, leaning forward. “Don’t tell me you haven’t thought about it?”
“Potter,” Draco says with a sigh. He’d been having a good night so far; the last person he wanted to see was Harry. “What are you doing here?”
Something in her face made Ginny pause. “What do you know, Hermione?”
“That would be counterproductive, I’d think.”
“Us.”
“I know,” he says quietly. “Ginny.”
“You should throw that away before you get caught,” Harry said. Malfoy sneered.
Malfoy frowns, but his eyes glitter. “You heard me. We need to stay close, like this.” He drops his arm and turns to stand beside Harry. The backs of their hands brush, and Harry holds back a shiver.
The cool air of the London night gusts across his face when he steps out of the bar, his eyes adjusting to the bright lights of the street lamps as he rounds the corner into the alleyway, his body humming with the warmth of a few drinks. He fishes a cigarette out of his pocket and with a quick glance around to make sure no one is looking, lights the end with a quick snap of his fingers.
Draco kisses his throat.
Look up at the stars.
“So can you.” Ginny takes his face between her hands. “We’re in this together. Promise me, Harry. Promise me you won’t do this alone.”
This time Mrs Weasley shares a concerned look with Mr Weasley.
“It’s hard to say, though probably someone not too keen on the Ministry getting in,” Draco murmurs, taking out his wand and gently casting a wordless spell on the spot where the floor plan has been tampered with. A shimmer of red hovers briefly over the paper, before winking away. “Dark magic, but nothing complicated. I’m sure I can restore it.”
Harry nods, but he looks unconvinced.
“We all have light and dark within us,” Dumbledore reminds him, and Harry scowls. He hates these witty turns of phrases, even though he likes to come up with them as well. However, when directed at Harry they always come with a hint of condescension that only reminds him of how his guardian always treats him like the child he no longer is.
“Is he pissed off at me?” Draco asked.
“Um, I’m sorry about the way I talked to you last night.  I was tired.  I know you were only trying to help.”
“No, Harry.  Let it go.  I’m sure no one really believes Weasley is a ponce.  And what she said about you wasn’t that bad.  They’re too busy laughing at me anyway.  Let it go.  You should cut your losses.”
“What--”  Hermione began to question.  Until she saw what Ron did.
“Draco,” he said as he opened the door.  “What are you doing here?  I thought you had lesson plans to write.”
“Oh, okay,” Harry blushed.  “You must think I’m some sort of a prudish coward,” he laughed nervously.
He could hear the quiet sounds of Draco’s snore.  Normally, it was he that woke Harry from his post-reading nap.  Harry felt warm and comfortable in his lover’s arms and was loathe to wake him.  But Harry had been dreaming and had woken up quite a bit randy.
“What’s all this?” Blaise’s voice echoed through the room.
“Thank you, by the way.” He glanced quickly at Harry. “For helping me home this morning. And the tea.”
“Stop what?”
He was beginning to get a headache when he realized his jaw was clenched and he was scowling.
Draco tried the door to find it unlocked.  He smirked to himself, thinking that down in Slytherin, he would never have left his door unlocked.
Harry’s smiled dropped as Stephen turned his head.
“Shit!” Draco shouted in frustration.  “I can’t apparate.  The charms are preventing it.”
“It’s not that late.  I wanted to talk to you.  Can’t I come in?”
“No, I didn’t say that.  That’s not what I think,” Draco stammered.
“Meaning?”
“You’re just jealous.  You’ve always been jealous of me.  You could have chosen to fight on the right side.  Maybe if you hadn’t been such a coward . . . Merlin, even Snape turned out to be a hero!” Harry regretted it the second it left his lips.  Draco had hit perhaps a little too close to home, and Harry lashed out.  He had come to confess the kiss and apologize, not start an argument.
“You’re staring again.”
Lifting Draco’s bottom off the bed, Harry pulled his legs up and scooted closer.
“Not soon enough,” Boot sneered.
Harry laughed.  “I’m getting to it.”  He took his thumb and forefinger, and gently squeezed the head of Draco’s cock.
“Eew,” Ron wrinkled up his nose.  “The thought of anyone shaggin’ that disgusting monster . . . it gives me the chills.”
“I hope you’ll be happy here,” Draco said, looking up at the ceiling.  “This is
The headboard banged against the wall, keeping time with Harry’s thrusts. Each one ending in a pointed grunt.  Draco, still not quite used to being bottom, whimpered and moaned as Harry raked his prostate. His hands were bound with a soft velveteen rope he’d transfigured from the ones Harry produced from his wand, while his ankles rested on Harry’s shoulders.  Normally, Harry enjoyed submitting. But when Draco offered to change positions, Harry carefully tied his hands above his head.
“Wait,”Rita said.  “I haven’t agreed.”
Draco awoke with a wide yawn. He sighed it out contentedly and opened his eyes.  His husband was still fast asleep lying next to him.  Even in his unconscious, disheveled state, Harry was a thing of beauty.  His hair was covering part of his face, but Draco could still see the thick fringe of dark eyelashes.
“You know what I think?”  He continued without waiting for Blaise to respond.  “I think you were
Ron clench his fists, but Hermione came and laid a gentle hand on him, reminding him to remain calm.  Harry stood.
“Do you think Luna knew it was us?” Harry wheezed.
Draco moaned, “Oh, I’m so close.” He hurried his pace and threw back his head.
Harry sat watching Draco for a little while, thinking he would say something else. When he didn’t, Harry closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep at the other end of the couch.  The Slytherin couches weren’t as comfortable as the Gryffindor ones. And Harry couldn’t stop thinking about what Draco said.  Did he really want to be friends with Harry?  Harry certainly didn’t think they were enemies anymore.  It was a bit like deja vu, like the first time they met.  Harry had turned down Draco’s offer of friendship back then, with good reason.  But now, things had changed so much.  Malfoy had changed.  Harry thought it probably took a lot for Draco to even bring it up.  And it looked like Harry went and shot him down again.  Harry decided to bring it up tomorrow, if Malfoy was still speaking to him, that is.
“Maybe it will all work out.” Pansy put a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “But if it doesn’t, I’ll be here for you.  And I don’t mean that in any way but as your friend.”
“Because you can do anything you want,” Draco reasoned. He said it with a twinge of jealousy in his voice.  “Not everyone else can.”
“I think it’s called growing up.”
“I don’t feel right just leaving, Mione.  I should have been able to do more.”
“But you were going to leave me out,” Hermione hissed.
“You know what this means, don’t you?” Harry asked.
“Actually, the note was from Pansy.  And she wasn’t specific.  The note only said that she couldn’t get Draco to leave.”
Deciding to accept Knox’s apology, Harry said, “You didn’t. Draco and I are better than ever. We’re finally taking our honeymoon in a few weeks.”
“Nonsense.  Breakfast in here is a wonderful idea.  And please, call me Narcissa.”
He wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.
“But this is a muggle publisher.  It came by owl?”
“Ah, yes, fuck me hard.  Hurry.  Hurry.”
He led them to another roller coaster line. The wait was a little bit shorter, and the ride was more of a tall spinning sort.
instead of girl.
Ron glanced over at Harry, who was busy talking with Hermione and Harper.  “Yeah, all right.”  He would do it for Harry.  “Excuse me.”  Ron got up and moved over to Ginny.
“You misunderstand, Harry,” Narcissa began.  “I’m not talking about your homosexuality.  I’m talking about the Chosen One shacking up with a Death Eater.”
“I don’t think I could eat another bite,” Draco said.  “It was wonderful, as usual.”
Lying down next to Draco again, Harry put his arm around the shivering man, rubbing his body to use friction to warm him up.
Of course, there was the bit about Knox’s criticism of the way Draco dealt with Casper in Potions.  Again, Harry couldn’t actually find fault in that.  He sighed.  Well, there were worse people McGonagall could have chosen.
Harry put his hand up to stop Draco from saying anymore.  “I know.  You didn’t let me finish.  I thought time apart would help us figure out if it’s real or not.  But after talking to Tracey, I don’t think it’s necessary.  I’m pretty sure that if it was just the game, we would have already lost it.”
“Of course I didn’t know it was you,” he said.  “After what you made me do at the party, I wouldn’t have gone anywhere near you.”
“Plans today?” Harry asked.
,” she giggled.  “You know, the greater the wizard the bigger the wand.”
Hermione giggled while Ron’s eyes grew big.  He was still not completely comfortable with Harry and Draco’s innuendo and displays of affection.
Throughout the period, Draco walked about the room, peering into cauldrons, inspecting technique, and occasionally advising, in order to avoid disaster.  To his surprise, Montague’s potion didn’t explode or take on a life of its own.  It actually seemed to work.
“Why, what are you and Ron wearing?” Harry asked.
“I know.” She kissed his cheek. “But sometimes, timing is everything.”
“You will dear.  You’re a fine, handsome young man.”  She patted his hand and leaned closer.  “Any wizard would be lucky to catch you.”
“Ron,” Hermione shoved him lightly.  “What’s the matter with you?”
“You should be there, more than I.  Do you want me to watch Rose for you?”
Leaning slowly to his left, Draco peeked around Harry and locked eyes with Ron.  The redhead’s eyes were as large as saucers.  His mouth hung open, as did Hermione’s.  Draco gave the slightest of waves and leaned back to face Harry.
Smiling with approval, Hermione said, “Then we’ll just start with the Ministry and see what happens. I’ll get right on this.  I just need to find something to do with Rose.”
“No. I’ve learned my lesson.”
“Yes,” she replied.  “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’m afraid your mother has had an accident.”
“Did I hurt you?”  Harry voice was filled with concern.
“You didn’t even ask me what I wanted,” Harry pointed out.  “How do you know I wouldn’t have said to leave the game as it was?”
“Leo.  Actually Leonard, but we’ll call him Leo for short. Leonard Arthur Thomas.  We used my father’s middle name and of course, yours sir,” Dean said as he shook Arthur’s hand.  “My parents aren’t here yet?  I owled them hours ago.”
“All this talk about how much you trust me,” Draco said, defiantly crossing his arms over his chest.  “I never even questioned whether or not I should trust you.”
He held out a small bouquet of simple flowers for her, which she accepted. “I’m sorry for my behavior at the wand party.  That first one.  And the second one as well, I guess.  I should have just cleaned your room for you.  It was the least I could have done.”
“A zoo?  Why would you think that?” Draco questioned.  “That’s an odd thing to presume.”
“Yes.”  Harry grinned.  “He asked me to move into the Manor with him.”
He smiled.  “I wouldn’t be able to become an Auror without my N.E.W.T.s.  It was either come back or choose a new career path,” he answered.
“Do you like being a Healer?”
“During your last formal interview, you were quoted as saying, The Malfoys certainly haven’t redeemed themselves completely.  As an Auror, I will make it my business to know the comings and goings of all Death Eaters.  I don’t believe they can be trusted.”  Rita smirked.  “It sounds to me like a bit of a conflict.  How do you justify your relationship if you don’t trust him?”
“Accio lube,” Draco called, without his wand.
“Me too,” Harry replied.  “McGonagall wouldn’t make an exception?”
“If you want.  The beds aren’t really meant for two, but I’m sure we could manage.”  She buttoned up her blouse as she contemplated the evening.  Logically, she knew it was just a game.  There were no real feelings between them, despite how he made her feel. They barely knew each other and yet she gave herself to him.
Harry could only hum in response, as his mouth was occupied. It served to help bring Draco closer to the edge.
In an effort to make Harry feel better he offered, “But you did play well.  I didn’t have to make too many mistakes.”
The girl nodded.
“I confess that I have used it on occasion,” Glenda told Slughorn.  She leaned down to retrieve the special quill from her bag.  “Some of my guests can be stubbornly reluctant to come to me.  What do you say Harry?”
“She just seems . . . down.  Like there’s something on her mind.  And whatever it is, Gin’s not telling me about it.”
Draco laughed out loud at Harry’s comment.  “I hope she’s better at it than Wand Match for Lonely Wizards.”
Dean brushed Ginny’s cheek with his hand.  “I know I didn’t treat you that well when I had the chance.”
But if it had been, the part where he got to kiss his date was getting close.  The butterflies were churning as he walked up the staircase next to Draco.  Harry’s quarters were coming up first and he was trying to think of an excuse to invite him inside.
“We ought to get going,” Draco suggested.  “I may not know anything about babies, but I know exhausted parents when I see them.  We should let Ginny rest.”
“Good to know,” he nodded. He hesitated.  “So, does that mean you accept my apology?”
Nodding once, Harry answered, “With all my heart.”  He paused.  “I believe that concludes our interview.”  He decided not to bring up the fact that Rita had asked an extra question.  He was happy to answer that one.
“Morning.”
Fortunately, the sight of his current nemesis did the trick and as soon as the man was out of sight, Draco strolled into breakfast.
“You were? Why didn’t you stop in? You’re always welcome back in the locker room.” Simon again glanced at Draco’s hand clutching Harry’s.
Pansy shot Harry a look after he asked his question.  He guessed she hadn’t mentioned the game’s true influence to Tracey.
“We have time,” Harry said.  Now that he felt things would eventually fall into place, he was less anxious.  And he could afford to be patient.  “Thank you,” he whispered and squeezed Draco’s hand.
“Did you really?” he asked quietly.
Harry furrowed his brow.  “You didn’t attend Hogwarts, did you?”
His wife nudged him again.
Within minutes, Harry had Draco stripped down to a pair of Slytherin green pants, pinned beneath him on the bed.  Rutting against one another like a pair of randy teens, they barely had time to snog before Harry was reaching for the lube and spreading it sloppily over his arse. Without using fingers for prep, Draco entered Harry.
“Yeah, oh that’s good.”
The small movements he was able to make weren’t going to get him off.  Not anytime soon.  He tried shifting without revealing himself, but Millicent glanced up at him from her book.
He tossed it at her, not caring whether or not the throw was accurate.
“Since he has been off Hogwarts grounds for the past two days,” she clarified.
Harry giggled.  “It really is pink and purple.”
Draco cleared his throat.  “As I said, I don’t know how to prove to you that I am sincere with regard to my feelings for Harry.  But I’ll answer any questions you have.  I invite you to spend time with us.  Anything that will put your mind at ease.”
“I told you.  It was an accident.”
Pansy made a face.
“Are you sure you want to tell me then?”
“Then invite him as well.”
“I saw Knox go to your room after I left.”
February 14 1999, continued
“It makes sense Ron,” Hermione chimed in.  “He’s always been good at potions and he’s Slytherin.”
“I intended to be your friend.  We work together well, and . . . I enjoy our conversations.  I enjoy your company--as a friend and colleague.”
“Dances, yes.  But not quite like these. There were very strict rules.”
Draco pushed himself up on his hands.  “I didn’t mean that I thought you were doing something on purpose.” He remembered Pansy telling him at the beginning of the year, some old witch’s tale about powerful wizards and sex.  But he and Harry had sex a few times and nothing like that had happened before.  “Harry, has anything like this ever–fucking hell.  It’s gone.”
Instead of disapproving the innuendo, as Harry thought she might, McGonagall gave a small giggle.
Harry’s heart began to pound, and his palms sweat. He subconsciously rubbed them on his trousers.
“Mione!  I’m all right,” Ron called to her.  “He wasn’t aiming for me.”
Hermione began tucking his hair in when she noticed a very faint mark on Harry’s neck.
“Master Harry Potter,” the elf smiled.  “Can Minke get a tray of food for Master Harry?”
Harry wanted to speak up.  He wanted to tell Ron to stop treating him like a child who needs protection, and to stop treating Draco like a criminal.  But his best friend and his lover seemed to have come to an understanding, on their own.  And he thought it best to leave it alone for the time being.  He waved to the server, who hesitated before walking over.
“We’ve shared a few meals there, as friends.”
There was.
Tracey laughed.  “It’s not like
Reluctantly, Draco agreed with Harry’s point, but still maintained his wariness over her applications.  After making a list of positive factors for each witch, Harry’s original choice prevailed.  Barely.
Gasping slightly and pulling away from Draco, Harry turned to see Ron standing there uncomfortably, giving a small close-mouthed smile and a wave.
“He’s different now. And he’s sorry.”
“I don’t recall,” Hermione addressed Fleur.  “Did you include a binding ceremony to your vows?”
“I guess that bloke never got jealous,” Draco sulked.
Draco was beginning to think he wasn’t going to be able to get the information out of Harry he was looking for.
“Then what am I supposed to use?” Harry asked.  He knew Draco was right.  He meant to give the wand back, but he never got around to getting his own before school started.
“I wouldn’t have been down here had I known you walk around without watching where you’re going,” Draco smirked.  He stood and brushed himself off.  “I was looking for a book, of course.”
Pulling back suddenly, Draco stared at Harry.
“You can’t make me leave.  This is a public place.”
He stood in front of the Potions room, catching his breath after running the whole way.  Harry composed himself as best he could, then disengaged the charms on the door. Before stepping all the way in, Harry was seized by his tie and pulled against a firm body.
“Chump,” Blaise grinned.  “How about I take you to lunch tomorrow?  Take your mind off Potter for a while.”
Hermione picked up two fortune cookies and tossed them to Harry and Draco.  She handed one back to Ron.
“Yeah, I guess he has.  But crikey, that story you told me about his family.  No wonder he was the way he was.”
“Still, not about me, personally.  Although, it seems you have a high opinion of me.”
“What?  You want me to spend time with Malfoy by myself?  Are you mental?  It’s hard enough to be around him with you there.”
“It’s okay. I guess you’re not as shallow as me, going after the best-looking boy at Hogwarts.”
“Yes.  Quite,” Draco huffed.  “Just show me the fucking spell.”
Draco raised his hand, grinning. “I volunteer to stay with him.”
“Well, my favorite book is whatever we’re reading on a Sunday morning,” Draco began.  He unbuttoned his shirt and draped it over the back of the sofa.  “I played the usual games-- exploding snap, gobstones and traded chocolate frog cards with my friends.”
She grinned back.  “Why Harry, I didn’t know you were the sort.  You Gryfs come off as so morally superior.”
Still prodding, Hermione queried, “Was he expecting you to–”
Draco glanced at Harry, who looked down at his plate.
“What do you mean, safe?”
“Draco,” Harry blushed.  “There are students around.”
Daphne raised her eyebrows and smirked.  Seeing the look on his face, her features softened. “Not
“You still haven’t told me what you want from me,” Lucius pointed out.  “Aside from the terms that have already been laid out.”
“It’s gold and platinum,” Harry said, smiling.  He debated telling Draco the story behind it but decided against it. He was pleased that Draco seemed to really like it.
“I’m happy,” Harry answered.  “Isn’t that a good enough reason?”
“Oh, right.  Are you chaperoning the dance?” Harry asked, noticing that he was in dress robes, though, not haute couture, as Draco’s were.
“Oh, fuck. Now. I’m cumming now. Watch out.”
“Of course,” Hermione smiled sympathetically.
“Harper told me everything. Including his confession.”
“Maybe that wasn’t from him.  Maybe that was you all along,” Draco suggested.
“When shall we do it?”
Grabbing onto Harry’s hips, Draco gazed up at him.
Browsing the merchandise in the second-hand shop, Ron was trying to decide what to get Hermione, while Harry was practically falling asleep on his feet.  Ron seemed oblivious to Harry’s condition.
“Everything,” Harry said.  “I want to know all the little things, like your favorite book, what toys you played with as a child, or your favorite color.”
Turning serious for a moment, Draco questioned.  “Are you saying there are blokes you don’t trust around me?”
“Harry, this is a huge assignment.  I had no idea it was so important when you told me about it.  And you’ve stuck Ginny with Zabini,” she admonished.
“I fear I’ve ruined all future romantic gestures for myself,” Hermione said.
“Draco is the first . . . no, I mean, the
“We’ll simply conjure one up, along with a hat and bandana.  Just remember that they won’t last.  Anything else?” Hermione wanted to know.
It took Draco several moments to move from the door to the love seat.
She was so fast, he never saw the hand that slapped him hard across his face.
The rest of the greetings were mainly hugs for Harry and nods for Draco, but it was more than he’d even hoped for.  Before supper, the family gathered in various rooms of the home catching up on news and gossip.  Harry and Draco were the subject of much of it.  Harry noticed a conspicuous lack of conversation whenever he and Draco entered a new room.
“Because we want you to come, silly.”
“It’s customary for purebloods to get permission from their fathers before marrying, isn’t it?”
corny.  But it’s true,” Harry said.  “This room is fine.”
Harry and Ron walked back from the marsh in silence.  As an Auror, Ron knew when to ask questions and when to keep quiet to get information out of someone.  Though Harry wasn’t a witness or a criminal, the tactics worked on him as well.
“I was afraid all the time,” Harry corrected him.  “And I wasn’t
“Oh.”
Harry could hear a voice calling Draco from beyond the floo.
Hermione smiled gently.  “That’s a risk we all take.”  She reached across the table and lay her hand on his.  “But what if he does?”
“You’d do that?” Harper sat up.
“He keeps telling me that needs to pass or his father will punish him.  He’s been begging for help.”
“The son of a prominent Death Eater,” she added.  “Either way, it’s not going to sit well with either side.  There will be those that will feel it’s their business.  They will harass you, provoke you, and attempt to torment you.  Are you really ready for that?”
“Fucking hell,” he said, trying to smooth out his hair.  He grabbed a tie and quickly put it back into a ponytail.
Harry had to restrain himself from thrusting his hips and allow Draco to set the pace. He gazed up at his love, gliding up and down gracefully, the way Draco did everything. Sometimes, he couldn’t believe how lucky he had been in catching the Potions professor. Running his hands up and down Draco’s sides, Harry smiled.
Before Harry manages to get over her shock, Malfoy has turned off the water and brushed past her towards the bathroom door.
Harry shifts her weight slightly, and I gasp when she slides her hands under my shirt and onto my back. The way she grips at my skin, pulling my body closer to her, speaks of a desperation I am happy to accomodate.
I’m a little nervous at the dealership, but the sale goes off without a hitch. I suspect I’m not getting as much money for the car as I ought to, but I don’t really know how to get more, and I don’t want to waste the time trying, so I decide I can live with it. And besides, the car is stolen anyways, and I’m lucky no one has caught onto that fact yet.
At least the car has a full tank of gas, because I am certainly going to be driving for quite some time.
Here she pauses to laugh breathlessly. I watch as she rubs her hand along the back of her neck.
It is the day of the dance competition, the day where Harry will perform her very first solo. She’s been practicing as much as she can– to the point where her dad had said that he’d heard her humming the song in her sleep.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know. And if nothing else, I do have to go, so: two birds, one stone.”
Harry thinks that as much as she wants to be the one to get the solo, Ron might actually want her to get it more.
Resting my head against the steering wheel of the car, I consider my next move. When my eyes start to close against my will, it’s abundantly clear what my next move needs to be. On my drive into town I had failed to pass any motels, so I start my car and head along the main street, hoping that there’s a motel on this side of the outskirts of town.
“But you couldn’t really hurt Katy or Ron, because you didn’t really want to. You know how closely I’ve been watching you, you think I don’t know what you’re capable of if you put your mind to something? Whatever you’re up to, if you really wanted to succeed, you would.”
But he couldn’t hear it over the blood pounding in his ears. He feet carried him to the always empty bathroom on the sixth floor and he stumbled through the door. He pulled off his jumper and gripped the edges of the sink, sure he would tip forward and shatter. His hands were shaking. His face was ghostly white, might already be dead if not for the red rimmed eyes and cold sweat, and
“Why do you want to die?” He said it quietly, seriously, but Draco shrugged it off.
But Potter recovered rather quicker than he’d expected. “Fine, a boyfriend then?”
to jumping off the Astronomy tower that morning, so close to the real thing and realized he didn’t want it, was too scared of it after all.
“The promise of at Gryffindor, how noble,” Draco said, trying for sarcasm, landing on something a little too sincere.
“What are you doing?!” Potter shouted, like it wasn’t perfectly obvious. His face was drawn in horror, and some remnant of Draco’s eleven year old self wanted to smirk.
“And you think that’ll change if you’re dead?” he said. The moonlight glinted off his glasses. “If I can’t stop you from doing this I’ll never forgive myself, I’ll obsess about it for the rest of my life.”
Potter was so close. There were specks of brown in his eyes. He had Draco’s shoulders pinned to the floor but Draco’s arms were free. One of his hands was wrapped around Potter’s wrist like it might try to shove him away. The other wasn’t sure what it was doing, hovering in the curve of Potter’s neck, thumb over the pulse of his throat. Potter’s heartbeat was still elevated from their fight, thumping and not slowing down, and his eyes were roving all over Draco’s face, daring him to disagree with his words, with the look on his face, with whatever was happening right now.
“What are you talking about?”
But Potter gasped and pressed tighter against him, kissed him back open-mouthed and heated, taking control of the kiss like it had been his idea in the first place. Draco wanted to cry for a moment with a feeling like that buoyancy spell, like he was going to float right up off the floor with Potter balanced on top of him.
? Too good to help him or just too good in general? Was it a jab? An insult? He couldn’t think of a single time before today that Malfoy had ever said something nice about him.
Potter folded his arms tightly.
Potter looked him over, then scooted across the stone to sit next to him. Their legs barely touched, hands resting loose on their thighs. He thought it over for a long moment, letting his head rest against the end of the bed, and Draco finally allowed himself to just look at him, to stare at his face in the way he was never allowed to before. His delicate nose, a bit crooked from the break that Draco wanted to apologize for again and again. His disastrous hair that Draco wanted to mess up even more. His sharp jawline that Draco wanted to cut himself on. His red-bitten lips that Draco wanted to kiss and bite even more.
though, seemingly fascinated by his bed-head. “I said nothing of the sort, Potter, I’m merely stretching my legs.”
Draco dropped his wand. It clattered on the stone floor and he made no move to pick it up.
“Don’t joke about that.” Potter glared at him.
Draco’s aim was wildly off, the pain in his arm was making his vision go spotty. He sent another curse as quick as the first, a crack echoing around the room. But Potter was just as quick, and Draco leapt out of the way just before the sink he’d been bleeding all over cracked and sent water shooting everywhere.
What did he want to do? He didn’t want to go home. He didn’t want to see the Dark Lord ever again. He didn’t want his mother to die. He didn’t want to have to make any more difficult decisions. He didn’t want to die. He wanted to be sixteen.
Draco didn’t know what to do with the thrill in his stomach. It quickly soured to smug satisfaction, then to anger, fear, bitterness. It didn’t matter what Potter meant. The days he’d once thought he would make it out of this unharmed were long gone. This would end with one of them dead, and, though he’d never say it, Draco preferred it to be himself. He shoved his left arm under Potter’s nose.
It wasn’t a yes or no in either direction. Draco resumed his pacing, trying to be nonchalant, though his pulse had sky-rocketed with the continuation of this conversation. “Thomas, huh? He’s quite fit, I suppose.”
“Malfoy! Stop!”
Potter nodded, and hesitated only for a moment before taking his hand. His face was determined. His hand was warm, square, a bit smaller than Draco’s.
But the Dark Lord wouldn’t just AK him and be done with it, no, he’d promised him to Greyback, he’d promised an excruciating, degrading death. And his mother would never stand by and let it happen, which means she would die too. Hell, even if Draco succeeded in becoming a bloody corpse on the bathroom floor and the Dark Lord found out it was by his own wand, she might be killed anyway.
“What do you want to do?” Potter said, and Draco had to look away, had to turn off that small wild part of himself that immediately conjured fantasies of Potter saying those words under very different circumstances.
“So you’re a long-distance legilimens now?”
He lowered his wand and held up a hand, approaching slowly like Draco might bite. He didn’t. Part of his arm had started to clot, but the deepest part of the wound still bled freely. He watched the blood pool on the floor, mixing with the water from the broken pipes, dissipating into nothing. Maybe that’s what it would feel like, just a slow, slip away…
Did Harry even know what Malfoy was going through? Sure, he’d watched Malfoy’s slow progression from the snobbish show-off he’d always been, to the silent, brooding ghost he’d become. It had never occurred to him to be concerned about Malfoy’s wellbeing—whatever happened to him he would have brought upon himself the moment he’d taken the Dark Mark.
It was in the back of his mind,
“Look, it doesn’t matter who,” Potter said. “Dumbledore, the Order, they’ll—”
“Stay,” Potter said, softly against his mouth. “Please stay. I promise you, I will figure this out.”
He realized he was muttering
“You hate me.”
“Well I don’t accept that!” Potter shouted, his jaw red from the slap, hands tightening on his shoulders. “I’m sorry that I assumed so much and didn’t try to think about what your life is like right now, but…I was wrong about you.” He looked a bit shocked at the words, and Draco wanted one of those stupid little muggle image-capturing devices so he could look at that wide-eyed face forever.
to be himself, to be a Malfoy. That he deserved it all—the manor, the wealth, the friends, the infamy—because of his blood and his right to rule.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course that’s what a Gryffindor would get from this. Congratulations, another life saved.”
“Sorry,” Potter whispered, throwing off his invisibility cloak, and Draco had the absurd impulse to laugh. Potter was still wearing his blood stains. Why on earth hadn’t he changed?
He had a sudden, inexplicable fantasy about the two of them running away together—the beloved golden boy of the Order of the Phoenix and the total fuck-up of the Death Eaters. They could go to America or maybe South Africa, just step neatly out of the war, continue peacefully hating each other on a new continent.
Potter swore again. “M’sorry, I’m crap at healing spells.” Why did he care? Why couldn’t he just let Draco go?
“Do you think you can walk? We need to get you to the hospital wing.”
“Okay then, swear to me that you won’t try to hurt yourself again.”
“I know.” Potter didn’t even look up. Draco stared at him. His hair was everywhere, a stray lock was glued into a point with Draco’s dried blood.
Draco’s breath hitched because Merlin that sounded far too much like the things Potter sometimes said to him in his imagination.
“Shut up,” Potter snapped, and took a deep, calming breath. He ran his wand over Draco’s arm a few times, muttering incantations that Draco vaguely remembered from his mother’s brief healing lessons. The cut knitted itself sloppily back together, blood still welling at the edges.
Because surely Katy Bell had told someone. If she hadn’t, she would. And if she didn’t, Potter would figure it out, or McGonagall, or Dumbledore. Or they would just kill him.
Draco had no idea what to say to him. He struggled to sit up straighter, not wanting to be so vulnerable in Potter’s presence.
He wondered if Potter would forgive him or condemn him, after they, the proverbial
Potter ducked, but the shock and fury was plain on his face. He pointed his wand at Draco.
moved in, before the garden was full of werewolves, before the parlor was a place of nightmares, curtains forever drawn, house elves never quite able to scrub the blood out of the floor.
“Malfoy!”
Draco needed to get out. They would be coming for him come morning, Dumbledore, Pomfrey, Potter, maybe even the Ministry. Potter had seen the Dark Mark, so had Pomfrey. How could he have been so stupid? He paced the length of the hospital wing, blinking quickly, hands twitching. The combination of potions Pomfrey had given him was still making him see spots, still making him tired, but his anxiety had won over his need for sleep.
But Harry had seen Voldemort living in Malfoy Manor, torturing his father, screaming at his supporters. How much of a choice had Malfoy had in the matter? He was living in the manor with Voldemort, could he really have refused the madman anything he wanted? Perhaps he could have said no to the Mark and to whatever mission Voldemort had given him, but there was no way he would survive the refusal.
He shrugged. “Is it the boy-Weasel or the girl-Weasel?”
“Malfoy!”
“You weren’t,” he said. “You weren’t wrong, I’m a bloody Death Eater, Potter.”
“If I have to,” Potter said, and squared his shoulders. His seeker’s shoulders, well-shaped but rather narrow, made for speed, not strength.
But Draco hated feeling like a caged animal, like his choice was being made for him. He let go of Potter’s arm and smacked him across the face. Potter stilled and blinked in shock.
Draco wasn’t sure what his plan was here, he was making it up as he went along. He stopped, bare toes touching Potter’s trainers, their noses inches apart.
Draco kissed him slowly, hand roaming lightly over his neck, his jaw, his hair, not even looking for a reaction. It didn’t matter. None of it did. This was the last time Potter would ever see him, so why not. He would either hate Draco and let him leave, or…not. And that was enough. Potter had gone completely rigid above him, lips pressed tight and quivering.
bad?”
Draco smirked. “Good.” He checked his watch, trying not to let himself blush. It was going on two in the morning. “Not that this line of questioning isn’t
He tried to turn his brain off, but the thought slipped through like a whisper—
Potter hesitated at the bathroom door, then reached one-handed to his bag that had fallen to the floor in the first moments of their fight. He slung it over his shoulder and with some effort pulled out what looked like an old, faded blanket.
he whispered, voice shaking and still too loud in his ears, and a pink line appeared down the center of the mark. Barely a scratch.
“So you
“‘Course you have one of these,” Draco slurred as they left the bathroom. “‘Splains so much, why you’re, you’re always…”
“I almost did,” he said into his palms. “I almost—I don’t know what I was going to do.”
Potter spluttered for a moment behind him.
“Sectum—”
“Then it's a perfect time to compile evidence.”
“I just want to live,” he said after a moment, and he knew Potter understood he meant that he wanted something more than mere survival.
“And people say Gryffindors are stubborn.”
His vision went white and his head lolled onto Potter’s shoulder.
There was something about being asked, not told, not yelled at, not tackled, that erased all Draco’s previous answers entirely.
—if he thought it would help him win.
Potter had been following him. He’d have to be deaf, dumb, and blind not to notice; he could think of handfuls of adjectives to describe the “Golden Boy,” (idiotic, self-absorbed, arrogant, reckless—) but
He realized after a moment that Potter was staring at his arm too, and he hurried to shove it under the blankets. He could not identify the look on Potter’s face. He expected disgust but it was more like shock, muted horror, an edge of fear.
He had to leave before they could stop him. Where would he go? It didn’t matter, he would figure that out later. Right now he had to get his things and stop the room from spinning. Perhaps he could summon his trunk from his dorm? Perhaps he could steal some pepper-up potion from Pomfrey’s stock?
“And how are you going to do that?” Draco knew he was goading him, but he couldn’t help it. One way or another, he was going out the hospital wing door. Might as well start the process now. He walked toward Potter with purpose, keeping their eyes locked, and Potter stared back, his scowl morphing into something like awe, mouth half open like he might answer.
Pomfrey was suddenly in front of him, flapping and fussing, and Draco listened to Potter attempt to explain his ‘accident’ as Pomfrey settled him in a bed and waved her wand over the wound. It sewed itself up properly this time. The blood on his arm was dry and sticky. It had gone rusty brown where it had soaked into his white shirt.
There was a rushing in his ears, his head felt like it was on fire, eyes streaming, wand in his hand before he realized what he was doing. There was a list of spells running alongside the insults, spells that cut and burned. He pulled up his left sleeve to stare at the dark mark. He was so pale it almost leapt off the skin.
Potter looked shocked. His arms folded somehow tighter, like he was trying to reign himself in. “Why didn’t I
Katie Bell was back. Draco had walked into the Great Hall, and for the space of a heartbeat he’d felt relief. He had no illusions about his allegiances; if Katie had faced him on the battlefield he’d have no qualms about fighting her, about killing her if necessary. But this was not a battlefield, and he hadn’t hurt her in a fair fight. Hogwarts was not a battlefield.
“Look at me,” Potter said, “I can help you. We can talk to Dumbledore together, he’ll understand, and he’ll know what to do.” He leaned towards Draco again, intensity all over his face. Draco had seen that look before, on the Quidditch pitch, in DADA classes, periodically aimed at Ginny Weasley.
“I’ve done other things,” Draco said. He’d done things Potter wouldn’t be able to forgive him for. “I’ve hurt people. I almost killed your chaser. I almost killed your—I poisoned the weasel.”
Harry sat in the dorm window and watched the last light of the day disappear over the mountains.
“Stupid Gryffindor,” Draco grunted, trying to shove him away. “Can’t handle things diplomatically to save your life, can you—?”
He drank from vials she gave him and the pain disappeared. Air seemed to return to the room, even as he felt himself float up off the bed, though his body hadn’t moved. Somewhere in his addled mind he identified each of the potions—Extract of aloe and juniper, Wiggenweld potion, blood-replenishing potion. Somewhere else in his mind was panicking now that the pain was gone and he remembered that he was still alive and trapped in this mess.
Potter was smaller than him—he could probably throw him off if he wanted to, if he really tried. He scrabbled at Potter’s forearms and bared his teeth, as though this would help. Potter rolled his eyes and leaned down harder.
Draco didn’t know why he was saying these things. His tongue had taken on a mind of its own. The combination of potions made him feel warm and far too comfortable, like he was drinking butterbeer by the fire.
What if he killed Dumbledore, he allowed the Death Eaters to kill students and teachers, he allowed the insanity to continue because he was too cowardly to do what needed to be done.
It struck him how stupid it had been to assume that it would be painless, when the time came. Stupid to debate with himself over the merits of hanging versus drowning, when all along he should have known it would be this, crying like a child in a bathroom, ready to rip his veins out if it meant he would be rid of the mark. Rid of himself.
Draco closed his eyes. Dumbledore would tell his parents, of course he would. Maybe they would stick him in St. Mungo’s. Or Dumbledore would figure out everything he’d done and stick him in Azkaban. Except Azkaban was under His control now, and whether by the Kiss, or by Greyback, or by the Dark Lord’s wand, it would mean his death.
“You’re going to live,” he said, like it was an order. Malfoy considered scoffing at him, but found he didn’t particularly want to. “I’m going to make sure of it.”
He looked up at Draco. Even with the few inches Draco had on him, their faces were far too close together.
Except there was a third option, wasn’t there. He’d said it himself: Potter was too good. He wouldn’t let Draco go just because he didn’t want to kiss him, he would get all apologetic, he would try and fail to hide pity and disgust, he’d tell him sorry but he just didn’t like boys that way, and Merlin’s beard Draco should have just stunned him the moment he’d showed up in the dark hospital wing to cause trouble, because kind rejection was so much worse than a long walk through the dark.
“I don’t know,” he said, in their absence. It was like he’d forgotten all of his options, his mind instead filled to the brim with Potter’s face, hands, lips, voice.
He wondered if it was Potter who would find him. Potter, who seemed to be around every corner, watching him, waiting for him to mess up.
Potter’s eyebrows knit together. He looked almost hurt.
Potter dove out of the way just in time—a stall behind him exploded.
—And Draco stepped smoothly away, sliding past him.
He’d become a dangerous, inept creature backed into a corner: striking at random, both desperate for freedom, and slowly realizing its impossibility.
He tried to lift Draco bodily off the floor before apparently remembering that magic existed. He waved his wand silently and Draco felt suddenly lighter, almost buoyant. Potter got an arm around his waist and steered him toward the door. The world was losing color. Potter’s hand gripped him tightly.
Had the castle always been so enormous? It took years to make it down two flights of stairs, an age to make it to the long corridor near the entrance hall. Draco was sure he was dreaming, kept gasping himself back to full consciousness and realizing all over again that Potter was the one holding him. At some point he became aware that he was mumbling again, no control over what he was saying. The words disappeared from his mind the moment they came out of his mouth, and this time Potter wasn’t shushing him.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Girlfriend?”
The little name was unmoving, until suddenly it wasn’t.
“Everyone seems to think so, yes,” Potter said, sourly.
he contemplated his wand, his potion kit, the bedsheets, the lake, wondering which would be easiest.
Draco rubbed little circles into Potter’s shoulder blades, unable to stop himself. His hands were shaking. So were Potter’s, he could feel them on either side of his face.
Sometimes in those first, startling, honest moments after waking up he realized it was his greatest fear.
“If you tell anyone about this, I’ll tell everyone about what just happened,” he said, and Merlin, what in hell was he on about? But he unfurled the blanket and threw it over both of their heads. It had gone silvery-transparent and Draco nodded. Potter didn’t want to be seen with him. Or didn’t want others to see the blood that had soaked through both of their clothes.
Ron and Hermione were waiting for him by the fire. They’d seen him rush out of the Great Hall after Malfoy. He shrugged and lied the best he could; Malfoy had gone down to the Slytherin dungeons, and Harry had gone back up to try to break into the Room of Requirement to no avail.
“Then why haven’t you gone to Dumbledore?”
“Malfoy,” Potter hissed. “If you don’t shut up, I’m going to leave the cloak and just levitate you down the halls in front of everyone.”
“Why didn’t you come to me, you idiot? Or Dumbledore? Or McGonagall?” What was Potter on about?
“Not exactly a compelling argument against,” he muttered. Potter glared, hands in his pockets going rigid. “So what, I’m supposed to stay alive, battle my way through this mess, watch people I care about die, so you won’t
Katie had seen him and his entire body had gone numb with fear. She remembered. She would tell, and they would find everything. It was all over, he’d been caught, he had
They made their way slowly down the hall. Draco floated above it all, his mind as light as his body, but as they descended the stairs one at at time, he had a moment of clarity.
He closed his eyes. “Why on earth would I do that?”
Draco didn’t want to talk anymore. He leaned his head back against the wall, the force of his little outburst draining his remaining energy. Potter, however, was vibrating with it.
Draco rolled his eyes, then couldn’t help but shoot Potter a smoldering look through his eyelashes. “Don’t worry, Scarhead, you’re a bit alright too.”
Potter just stood there, staring at his arm and the spot on the floor where blood was plinking into a small puddle. It wasn’t enough, not yet. Draco raised his wand, this time at Potter.
Potter’s eyes narrowed. Pomfrey hadn’t bothered to scourgify his clothes. His sleeves and the front of his shirt and trousers were streaked with Draco’s blood.
under his breath, and Potter was muttering back, peering into his eyes, one trembling hand on his face.
He took out the map and watched Malfoy’s familiar dot, unmoving in the hospital wing. If he died, the dot would disappear.
“What about you?” Draco said, unable to stop himself.
He couldn’t think about them right now. They’d be better off without him. Because the fact of the matter was, his existence was a problem. Any way he turned someone died, someone better than him.
“Why’re you doing this?” he breathed.
“That was amazing,” Draco whispers. His legs are still shaking. He places a hand on Harry’s side. “Do you want me to…?”
“Hermione,” Harry pleads. He sees Weasley blush faintly out of the corner of his eye, probably because of his use of Miss Granger’s first name. Despite their familiarity, wizards and witches avoid informally addressing those that are of age and unmarried.
* * *
“Well I know we didn’t do more than that,” Draco says irritably, then looks away, reminding himself not to sound too invested. “I remember you said something, though.”
He remembers saying that, but he also remembers the rejection. He remembers Harry lying about what he had said, and he remembers the pain of his insults like a sword straight to the heart.
“You’re joking.”
He climbs onto her bed and places his arm around her, stroking her hair away from her face. She turns and curls herself against him, hiding her face against his chest.
“Actually, never mind,” Ron interrupts with a nervous laugh. “I’m basically in all the same classes as you. And you always have perfect marks. Stupid question, really.”
“If I’m honest, it wasn’t my idea,” Draco says. “I hope you don’t mind, but I showed my flatmate, Pansy—you remember her from school?—the floor plans, as she had been family friends with the former owners. She's my best friend. I trust her with my life.”
“Well, do you know what you wish to do after graduating?” Miss Granger asks hesitantly.
“I’d better go. Pansy’s waiting.”
Harry tries not to show the paralyzing fear he feels inside. “That is funny.”
“I don’t know. I was never in that position,” Pansy lies through gritted teeth. She thinks of Blaise, beautiful, handsome Blaise with his straight teethed smile, those warm, strong hands, gentle against her skin, and his voice, the voice she hears in every dream and every fantasy.
Harry shrugs. “Why should it?” He turns around, as if to block Ginny from his mind not just mentally, but physically too. This has always angered Ginny, and it still does now. She strides over to him and yanks his shirt sleeve. Harry whirls around, stunned, looking at Ginny like he wonders how she got there.
Hermione knows exactly who she needs to talk to. But she sighs irritably, crossing her arms, because there’s just one small problem.
“Oh, piss off.” Ginny rolls her eyes, but there’s a serious set to her jaw. “I mean we’d be awful together. It’d never work, and people would just get hurt because of it.”
“Why, Miss Granger, we will not see you at all outside of class!” Weasley cries upon looking at her schedule.
He leans down and kisses her, tightening his hold on her. But she pulls away, and untangles herself from Harry’s embrace.
Draco stops. He reaches out and unzips Harry’s jeans, pulling them off and throwing them across the floor. He feels Harry’s cock through his briefs, his erection pulling the fabric taut. Harry groans, pleading with his eyes for Draco to do something.
Only after the voices upstairs lull to a fitful quiet does she return downstairs. She walks back to the living room and finishes the bottle of wine, lounging on the couch, soaking up the space where she found and lost herself in one blow. With trembling hands, she finds a cigarette in a drawer and shuts herself on the balcony.
“Still am,” Draco mumbles, the words more heard than felt against Harry’s bare chest.
Footsteps, barely heard. Harry strains his ears, and when they pass his hiding spot, he gets up and follows them.
Of course, he would never tell

“Your steps are as loud as a Giant’s,” Draco says coldly. “If you want to follow someone successfully, I would suggest a Muffliato.”
Another world. He’s trying to find another world.
her, and how Ginny saw her too, the rosy cheeks and golden curls, the suppleness of her waist and the trembling of her voice in the air when she says your name like a lone note from a violin.
“Are you?”
“Maybe later, though,” Harry adds, awkwardly, but still smiling, almost bashful. Draco grins, his love for this boy like a second heartbeat beside his own, yearning for his soul, yearning for a unity of more than their bodies, if possible, wanting to live in the same skin, in the same bones.
Blaise raises an eyebrow. “Well, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to put two and two together. He never told me explicitly, though, but I figured it out quite easily after a while.”
Now their love glows in a different way, but Hermione wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. But sometimes she does remember those nights with a little nostalgia.
“I would like to be an auror, though I am not sure my marks from previous years will allow me to do so,” Weasley says, suddenly embarrassed. He steadfastly does not look at Miss Granger.
"Lucy, you nearly killed me. What are you doing here?"
They briefly lock eyes, before Draco’s gaze slides away easily.
“For raids?” Harry asks.
Draco stares at her silently for a very long moment, at first stunned but then gradually resigned, even grateful. Then he nods.
“He slept through Defense Against the Dark Arts
“Do you feel it?” Hermione whispers, as if the baby might stop if she’s too loud.
“After we set up the game, I tossed it aside and didn’t give it a second thought.”  She paused, “Until this week.”
“I’ll save a seat for you in my compartment.”
“Understandable,” Hermione nodded.
“How long have you and Mr. Malfoy been dating?”
Contemplating a long explanation, and trying to figure out a way to hedge his bets, Draco stalled. Not knowing which way Harry was hoping the conversation would go, he eventually settled on one word.
“Oh Merlin!  I almost forgot,” she laughed.  “The whole reason we wanted to come see you, Harry.”  She held out her left hand for him to see.
“You would go with me?”  Draco slowly sank back down into the pillows with Harry.  “He won’t exactly be welcoming.”
“Let me help you--”
“My, don’t you boys look handsome,” she commented.  “I rather like your hair shorter, Draco.  I feel less inclined to call you Mr. Malfoy.”
“I always fancied myself a top. Until you told me you wanted to shag me for days on end,” Draco gave a small smile. “I was afraid you wouldn’t go through with it if you knew I’d never . . . done that.”
Chuckling, Harry answered, “I wasn’t going to tell you.  I never acted on any of my feelings until after Ginny and I broke up.  And now I know for sure. I’m definitely gay.”
Suddenly, Harry sat up.  “Where’s my kiss?” he slurred.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, along with Theo’s.
“One of my books was spelled to pass gas, loudly, when it was overdue,” Harry said.
“Some things do,” Harry replied softly.  He rested his hand on the bench next to him.  With his other hand, he picked up his glass to drink.
“He’s not worth it Terry,” Cornfoot warned.  “You don’t want two months of detention.  It’s enough to break them up.”
“He’s changed.  We both have.  We talk, like normal people, like friends.” Harry tried to convince his friends.
After their goodbyes, Harry took Draco’s hand and led him into the sitting room.  Arthur was in his favorite armchair, with his older sons on the sofa.  George and Ron sat on the floor near the coffee table, and Harry joined them. Draco took a seat in a comfy chair off in the corner.
“Are you hungover?” Hermione peered closely into his eyes.
“It’s so difficult to keep the romance alive once the little ones come along,” she said.  “How do you do it?”
“That’s not what she was wearing when we put her down.”
Ron and Harry looked at each other.
Pansy looked away. “I know, it’s ridiculous.”
Harry approached Draco’s door and turned the knob.  He had gotten used to letting himself in over the past month or so, as long as no one was watching.  But Draco’s door was locked.
“I realized that I was on the side that wouldn’t be winning,” Draco said.  “Wait, it was more than that.  I was on the side that shouldn’t win.  I knew that, and I wanted Harry to win.  I know my actions didn’t always reflect that.  But it was necessary to keep up appearances in order to stay alive. I couldn’t even trust my friends.  As you can all attest.”
Harry’s brow immediately scrunched tightly and he felt like the wind was knocked from his lungs, leaving him unable to speak.  But Draco continued.
“Master Harry is finally awake,” she smiled demurely.  “Poppy has been waiting to serve you.”  She bowed to him.
“I’m kidding.  Draco, you know I’m kidding.”
“Is it okay if it’s a little slow going?”
“What?  Why are you yelling?”
Nodding, Harry said, “That’s sounds like a good idea.”  He yawned.
“This is really lovely,” Hermione remarked as she popped a small piece of carrot into her mouth.  “I’m so impressed you were able to do this.”
Harry was glad that Knox had gone with friends to Hogsmeade for most of the day.  At least he and Draco spent it together, playing chess, flying and reading.
Hermione and Harry sat, taken aback by the exchange. Harry looked about to see if anyone overheard Draco’s rather loud reaction.
Ron and Harry left the shop with the clerk waving wildly behind them.  She’d given Ron the discount, but the boys were asked to autograph a post card for her. It was a small price to pay.
“You should come, Harry,” Romilda chimed in.  “It’ll be fun.  What are the odds you get paired with Malfoy again?”
Smiling, Pansy agreed, for appearances sake. “Yeah, you’re right. But where
“They’re coming soon. It’s almost two o’clock,” Lily announced to the living room full of guests.
“Then I guess you’re going to have miniature replicas of yourselves someday,” Harry smiled.
Glenda smirked.  “All right.” She waved her wand at the quill.  “So tell me, Mr. Potter, how are your studies coming along this year?”
“They make a very cute couple, don’t they?”
“Look at you, juggling a baby in one hand and a drink in the other,” Harry joked. “Fatherhood’s finally agreeing with you.”
Could he be attracted to another boy and
He broke the kiss and removed his glasses and put them in his shirt pocket.  “I guess I don’t need these anyway.”
“We don’t want to wake the little princess,” Arthur told her in a hushed voice.
of them?”
She left him standing in the corridor, alone and in the dark.  Deep down, he knew she was right.  Malfoy was under his skin.  He just didn’t understand in what capacity.  Was it the reason he and Cho didn’t work out, the reason he and Ginny didn’t work out?  The reason that, despite girls clamoring for his attention, he always found himself watching Draco?  Of course, it was always under the guise of keeping an eye on him, to keep him from wrong doings.
“Aw, who cares what everyone--”Ron began.
As Draco made his way back to Slytherin, his grin slowly faded.  He thought about the things Professor McGonagall had said.  The one that kept gnawing at him was,
“Ha. what do you know about raising kneazles?” Blaise scoffed.
“Probably not,” Harry laughed.
“Egads, you’re not getting on one of those aeroplanes, are you?” Madame Pomfrey questioned.
Harry looked away to answer.  “What does one usually say?”
“Yes, I know.  And, again, I am truly sorry I let my temper get the best of me.  I didn’t mean to say that to you.  I was angry with someone else.”
“You’re asking an awful lot,” the editor said.  “What do we get in return?”
“But . . .” Harry sighed heavily. “You looked like you . . . longed for it.  If I hadn’t known better, I would have thought you were envious of Bill and Fleur.”
Draco stepped inside and immediately began to snog the other professor.  His hands made quick work of the buttons on Harry’s shirt, then moved down to his trousers.
Draco frowned.  He’d been willing to write it off as an accident.  His mother was getting older, and it was plausible that she could have simply lost her footing.  But now Harry was putting ideas into his head.
“Yes.  You know I am.”
“Just about.  Do you want to shower or should I just cast a Scourgify?”
Ignoring Harry and still addressing Draco, Hermione continued.  “So, when you said at the pub that night that you’d been in love with him for a long time, you weren’t exaggerating just for drama.  You literally meant that you’ve been in love with him all these years.  Since when?”
Harry remained quiet the rest of the way to the cafeteria. Once there, the two parted ways to gather up snacks for the others, and a sandwich for Ginny.  They met back up at the cashier to pay for their items.  Ginny patiently waited for Harry to speak on the way back to the waiting room.
James perked up at his grandmother’s defense of him.  “I’ll catch a frog for you, Grandmama,” James smiled.
“So maybe the magic didn’t affect us because we already had those feelings?” Draco suggested.
“Perfect.”
“But you’re not even married yet,” he pointed out.
A small, shy smile appeared on Draco’s bedraggled face. “I’m injured, un-showered, helpless in a hospital bed, at the lowest point physically and emotionally I have been in a long time. And you choose now to tell me how much I mean to you?”
Sensing the earnestness in Harry’s voice, Draco tried to reassure him.  “Yes, I only like you.”
“Well, I’m here now.  I may as well enjoy myself.” Ron picked up a butter beer and took a big swig. He noticed Harry looking at him with concern.  “What?”
“You’ve never let anyone run you off before,” commented Ron.
“Why I didn’t Die When The Augurey Cried,” the librarian read aloud.  “Where in Merlin’s name did you get a first edition of this?  It was published in 1824.  We have a copy here in the library, but . . .”
“It’s over at midnight anyway,” Ron reminded her.  The large enchanted clock read eleven forty-three.  “Let’s go make our own magic before our roommates get back.”  He wriggled his eyebrows at her.  She couldn’t see the gesture behind his mask, but she didn’t need to.  She knew what he meant. “Although,” Ron continued.  “I am curious as to who those two are.  If I had to guess, I’d say the taller, skinny one is Malfoy.  Except he’s smiling way too much to be him.  I don’t have any idea about the other one.”
“But I don’t have anything to hide,” Lucius snorted. He removed his wand from his pocket and handed it over.
The pair checked in with the Welcome Witch, then sat in chairs to wait for a Healer to see Harry.  Hermione took a moment to send an owl to Ron explaining that she’d taken Harry directly to St. Mungo’s.
Hermione waved to them from her table at one of the cafes.  Ron sat there too, with Rose playing with colorful round cereal at a highchair.  The two families were meeting for lunch before the new term began at Hogwarts.
“The things you do for me are intangible, valuable beyond measure.  I am happy.  And that is no small thing to me.”
As they hesitated, Ron whispered, “Those feet, wrapped around Harry’s waist . . . they’re awfully big, aren’t they?”
“Grandmama, Grandmama!”  The small sandy haired girl held out her arms as she ran
Harry laughed.  “I’ll give you that.  But we can avoid them.  Just come on a couple of rides with me.  If you hate them, I promise I won’t drag you on anymore.  There are a few shows you might enjoy, sort of like theater.”
“Well, if she’s staying, I’m staying,” Draco said, lying on Harry’s bed.
“Ginny was sitting on the floor clutching her belly and crying,” Neville added. “Next thing we knew the floor was all wet and Dean asked us to run up and get McGonagall.”
“Mr. Malfoy, are you finished?” the professor asked when he noticed Draco sitting and staring into his cauldron.
“Yeah,” Knox went on.  “I don’t know if it’s going to work out.  He’s sort of clingy.  He always wants me to reassure him that I’m having a good time with him.”
Edmund, that’s right.  Harry was close, at least.
“To tell the truth, I rather like it this way,” Draco admitted. “Your mother can concentrate on celebrating their birthday instead of mine.”
On the other hand, Parvati seemed rather pleased to have another chance with Michael.  After a few butter beers at the last party, he was most charming, not the shy boy he normally was.  And this time, she was in charge.
very handsome.”
“Half-one or so.  Maybe later.”
“Yeah, I thought I’d let him chew it for me as well,” Harry joked back.
“Hmm,” was Flitwick’s reply.
“I thought you said there was no party tonight?” Blaise said to Pansy as they sat eating supper.
“I’m not guaranteeing anything.  Maybe he’ll at least talk to you.”
“I didn’t need to see that,” Blaise said under his breath.  “So, what is it already?”
Daphne gave him a fake pout.  “Aw, poor thing.  Let me take care of that for you.”  She unzipped his trousers and slid her hand inside.  He moaned.
Harry smiled, thinking the same thing about the man beneath him.  Transferring his weight to his left arm, Harry used his right to tweak Draco’s firm nipples.  It pushed the Slytherin prince over the edge.
Smirking, Skeeter sat down in a chair nearby.  “I must really have hit a nerve this time.”
Harry’s jaw remained gaping as he listened. “No pulse,” he said quietly, staring.
Draco nodded. Now all he had to do was convince Harry’s friends to all switch partners.  Piece of cake.
“Get out of my house.”
“Yeah.  Are you?” He held his hand up to his chin.  “Sorry, I don’t know what happened.  I just tripped.”  Harry stopped when he heard giggling from around the corner. He realized what happened.  Furious, he got up and drew his wand.
“You can’t.  She won’t be any more fair than before.”
His heart? Harry wondered. Was Draco really going to die? Until that point, he was certain he would not. Was this the last conversation they would ever have? Harry felt as though a part of him was breaking as well.
“I suppose if you can forgive my sins, you can forgive anything.”
“You seem to have mastered it,” Knox commented.
Draco got up and walked to Harry, putting his hands on his shoulders.  “All right.  It’s just habit.  I’ll try.”  He bent down and hugged Harry.  “Are you upset with me?”
Draco sighed.  “I just realized that it’s Sunday night.  I probably shouldn’t stay.”
“Shh, do you hear that?” Harry whispered.  “Someone’s over in that corner.”
“I was avoiding you because I didn’t want you to see me. I had to pay the consequences of the game and I got boils.”  It was embarrassing to tell him she had them, even if he didn’t actually see them.
As Harry waited for Draco to return, he began having second thoughts about the gift he bought.  Hermione was with him, and said she thought it was perfect.  But still, Harry wavered. He didn’t like second guessing himself, and there was nothing he could do to change it now anyway, so he tried not to be anxious.
“I had some errands to run,” Harry explained.  “First, I went to Azkaban to see your father.”
“All right?” Harry questioned.
“Too busy for love?  Harry, you’ll never find a nice girl and have a family if you don’t put yourself out there.  Don’t you want a family?”
“She’s practically been one for years,” Harry said.
Harry stopped moving. “Uh, I was hoping you’d forgotten about that.”
“Merlin, so do I.  But I should go back to my quarters.  With my luck, McGonagall will be looking for me.”
He leaned forward and kissed Draco.  What started out as a peck quickly escalated into all out snogging.  Slowly and steadily, Harry pushed Draco onto his back on the sofa, and gently lay himself on top.  Forgetting themselves, both boys began to grind against one another as Harry sank between Draco’s legs.
Slowly, the corner of Pansy’s mouth raised.  “So
“What do you think Pansy will say?  Or Blaise?” Harry questioned.
“Everyone else gets to sit together,” Harry pointed out. “Please?”
Just a few hard strokes in, Draco cursed loudly.
“Something wrong, Harry?  What’s that you’re reading?” Hermione asked, always curious.
“I see,” said Draco.
“We’re a rather small group this afternoon, Harry.  Why don’t you sit next to Draco so we can all chat together?”
“No.  Keep fucking.”  Harry’s hand stroked his cock with breakneck speed.  “Harder.”
“I . . .”  He burst into tears.
Pansy and Blaise traveled to Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw to give the same address to those students.  All in all, interest was mixed and many of the students were skeptical of the Slytherins.  For the following two days, it was all the older students at Hogwarts talked about.  By the time Friday rolled around, the anticipation was a distraction in all their classes.  Girls giggled, discussing which boy’s wand they were hoping to choose. And whose they definitely did not want.  Of course, most of the girls were hoping for a chance at Harry, now that he and Ginny had broken up.  Low on the list, were Justin Finch-Fletchley and Michael Corner.  But lowest were Blaise and Harper, who many suspected were homosexual. Few of the girls seemed to relish the idea of sharing their man with other men.
“I think Hermione’s rubbed off on me,” Ron laughed.
“Yeah, and why did he get so embarrassed?” Blaise chimed in.
“Where’s your Gryffindor courage?” Hermione implored.
“Because of meeting my mother, or being in the house.”
Ron himself, couldn’t help but smile.  He enjoyed seeing Harry having fun, even if it was at his expense.
He held a finger up to her lips.  “It’s all right, luv.  We’ll take it slowly.”
“It’s all right.  If the information he gives is useful, he’ll be out soon enough.”  Draco patted his chest.  “Come on.  Lean back.  What book have you got today?”
“They were different.  I wasn’t serious about any of them.  Any of them,” he laughed.  “It was only two boys.”
“Yeah,” Justin agreed. “I miss the bagpipes, though.”
“He hasn’t called me mudblood in years.  And, truthfully, I felt sort of sorry for him sixth year.  He was always brooding and miserable looking.  And then of course, he helped you in his family’s manor.  It seems as though he was never much of a willing participant in all the Dark Lord’s plans.”
Laughing, Harry held up his glass in cheers.  “Well, I suppose it’s not going to happen overnight.”
“Well, it would be a shame if you didn’t get a chance to be a father.  My girls are my joy.  In fact, Fleur and I are planning to have another in the next year or two.”
“Hold your legs up.”
“But there are options.”
“Harry,” Draco began.  “I was going to say, ‘for a long time’.  I’ve never really been around children.  I don’t particularly like them.  I can barely tolerate the First and Second Years,” He tried to laugh, but it came out as more of a cough.
“What?” Ron asked incredulously.
Draco sighed and silently berated himself for his moony-eyed behavior.  Malfoys were the sort to be sought after, not the one to follow others like a puppy dog.  He couldn’t help himself around Harry.  Draco had never felt the need to reassure a lover before.  But he didn’t want to let this one get away.
“I thought she should know first,” Ron explained.  “But now I know I shouldn’t have tried to set something like that up all by myself.”  He rested his head in his hands and closed his eyes.  “She says I humiliated her.  What if she won’t forgive me?”
“Let’s find Blaise and get it over with then,” Pansy smiled empathetically.
Ginny grumbled, “Mum’s insisting we live at the Burrow until Dean can secure a steady job with the Ministry.”
Harry threw the covers off, revealing Draco, who was trying so hard not to laugh that he was practically convulsing.  Under the blanket the movement looked much more unsettling to Ron.  Finally releasing his laughter, Draco fell backwards on the bed.
She led them through the Manor, past the dining room that once hosted dinners and meetings for Voldemort. The furniture had all been replaced and the room painted a soft yellow color.  A vase of colorful flowers was placed in the middle of the table.
Narcissa furrowed her brow.  “Something is troubling you.”
“It’s not as if I haven’t spent time ogling you.”
“Harry, my aspirations shouldn’t supersede yours.”
Harry took a deep breath and smiled. “I would place a ring on your finger and talk about what it means to me, to give you a piece of my family history, and how proud I am to have you wear it.  But you refused to take it off once I gave it to you. So I guess I’ll skip that part.” He tapped his family ring on Draco’s finger.
But then she leans forward further, pressing her lips to mine, and I promptly lose that train of thought.
“Then I will have to teach you how,” Draco says, tightening her grasp on my hand, and soon enough she is pulling me into motion alongside her.
She leans back and her eyes widen in shock. “How?” she whispers.
Harry whoops with excitement, then gasps as Ron hugs her, driving all the air out of her lungs. Ginny slaps her on the back.
The in-team competition between them had only increased in intensity with each passing month– even when dance was out of season– to the point where Harry had chosen to go to dance camp instead of playing field hockey during the fall, just to get an edge on Malfoy.
“I insist you take a shower with my things,” she says. “I have plenty of everything else, and there’s no need for you to go without.”
First I climb into the shower, doing my best to rinse off the stink of both the road and the swamp. I hadn’t thought to purchase any toiletries, so I have to make do with just the hot water, because this isn’t the sort of motel that provides any extras.
We exchange a smile as we set our things down.
to the performance.”
Harry nervously nods her head along with the rest of the troupe.
She’s smiling happily at me, and I automatically smile back. “I think there may be one about a thirty-minute drive away,” she says.
Ginny nods in agreement and says, “Yeah, you definitely deserve that solo.”
I immediately get to my feet, spin the chair around, and sit back into it. Then I pull my hair out from where it got trapped between my back and the chair, glancing nervously up at Draco.
As I’m standing around, waiting for the gas to finish dispensing, I make eye contact with the woman who is filling up her own car across the way. I quickly look away, but not before I notice that she’s staring at me. I worry, for a moment, that she’ll say something to me about my attire, but thankfully my car finishes then, and I’m able to remove the gas nozzle.
Draco joins me just as I’m signing the final papers. She waits until I receive the check, and then we hurry back out into the parking lot. Draco guides me to her car by the hand. She opens the door for me, and I climb in, flashing her a smile as I go.
She spreads her arms and falls backwards. Harry sighs in relief when she feels the press of hands against her back, catching her.
“I’m just saying,” Malfoy continues, “if we lose this thing, it’s on Potter.”
Several pages later of what are probably senseless ramblings, I see Draco get up and dig around in the bags she’d brought back earlier. I quickly look away, not wanting to pry, but then she comes back over and sets some tiny bottles of alcohol down upon the table.
McGonagall scrutinizes Ginny for a long moment, then sweeps her gaze over the rest of the team.
Harry hadn’t even noticed that McGonagall was in the room. McGonagall’s presence causes Harry’s nerves to act up again. She nervously twirls her hair around her fingers.
“Five minute warning!” McGonagall calls.
She’s about Ron’s height– a bit taller than Harry– and has silky blonde hair, braided flat against her head, her silver eyes glinting. She’s wearing workout gear that looks expensive and seems perfectly tailored to fit her.
“Is everyone ready?” McGonagall asks.
Draco stares into my eyes for a moment, as if to make sure that I’m sure, and then she steps past me into the dingy motel room. “I’ll just set my things down for now, then,” she says. “If that’s alright. I still have a few more errands to run.”
Harry nods. She sucks in a deep breath, then lets it out slowly. It’s time for her to focus on one thing, and one thing only: her solo.
this makeover.”
I gratefully duck into my car and drive off to find the corner convenience store. A town this size must have one. I find it at the end of the main street, and so I park the car a few steps away. I slide a dime into the meter and go into the store.
“Lay off, Malfoy,” Ron says.
Once Harry had finished her errands, she’d gotten into her car and pulled onto the road again. I’d given her a head start, and then set off after her, doing my best to keep her in sight without letting her know she was being followed.
Malfoy interjects, “Only you, Potter, would be able to land a solo, and then not manage to keep the beat. Oh wait, maybe it’s because you didn’t deserve the solo in the first place… We’re doomed.”
Eventually, we break apart for the final time with a gasp. I slide off Harry's lap to properly survey her appearance for the first time since we had started kissing. And then I nearly lean over to kiss her again, because she looks absolutely stunning.
“Doing a bit of reinventing, I take it?” Draco says. “Did you want to do it yourself?”
It’s times like this that the close quarters of their warmup space gets to Harry. Though, with how persistent Malfoy has been about harassing her, she can only imagine that even if they did have more space, Malfoy would probably still find a way to hang around and be a nuisance.
Harry’s heartbeat picks up and she starts bouncing again. The solo was up between Harry and Malfoy, and Harry thinks that she would have to die if she lost the solo to Malfoy. Especially since this is the first time they’ve ever truly competed against each other; being on the same team doesn’t give them much opportunity for true competition.
Next, I think of the moment as I was cutting her hair, then the moment we started dancing together. It’s as though I’ve unleashed a veritable flood of memories; moment after moment where I’d felt that same thing crowds through my mind, and I realize, at last, what that feeling is.
so the response to the first chapter was great! please please keep leaving comments! (and kudos/bookmarks/subs)! originally, this story was about 6k words and now it's going to be about 9k, and that's thanks to y'all!
Her hair looks almost wind tousled from the amount of time my hands spent threaded in it. And her lips… are swollen and pink. She has a slightly dazed look in her eyes, a look that I think might also be present in my own gaze.
huge thank you to amanda aka
“I’m sure you’ve noticed that some groups are
“Something I should have done long ago.” And then I had reared back and slapped him across the face with as much force as I could muster. I had longed to do more, but the office was too public and there were too many witnesses.
I’m torn. I do need the money, but it doesn’t feel right to accept it from her.
I shift so I can look at her face properly, and I see that her expression is perfectly serious. “But you don’t have a
“Oh!” Draco says, upon seeing that I’m awake. “I got dinner for us,” she says, gesturing at the takeout that sits invitingly on the coffee table.
I feel bad for continuing to lie to her, but I can’t see a way around it, because telling her the truth would mean being abandoned, and I don’t think I could take that. So that means my only option is to continue to hide the truth.
“Oh.  All right,” Draco said hesitantly.  He carefully opened the envelope to find a certificate to Twilfitt and Tattings for a sizable amount.
The pair lay, foreheads together, panting into one another’s mouths. Eventually, Draco extricated himself and lay down next to Harry.
“Draco.” Harry yelled, pushing the blond off him.  “All the Weasleys are going to see that.”
Hermione was skeptical, but let it go.
“Technically, you know I can’t tell you,” Ron said.  He glanced around.  “But if you just happen to be there when I take my witness into custody . . .”
The first time he mentioned it, it was insulting.  Somehow, the second time he said it, she found it less so.
“Mother, calm down.” Draco placed his cup on the floor before joining his mother.
“Mione’s due at the beginning of November.”
Draco leaned a bit closer.  “Missus doesn’t know everything about me,” he winked.
Harry was unconvinced.  But a knock on the door distracted him from carrying the conversation further.  Grateful, Draco walked to the door to find a familiar face.
“All right, now that everyone is here, let’s eat,” Molly announced.
“You’re free to go,” the Healer smiled.  “Don’t forget to take the potion, Auror Potter.”  He held out his hand to shake once more, and left Harry to dress.
“Please have a seat before the food is gone,” she motioned for him to take the empty seat next to her. Professor Flitwick nodded politely at him, while Sibyll Trelawney, on the other side of Flitwick, smiled vacantly at him as if she hadn’t recognized him at all.
“What?  You think we should have?” 	“How likely is it that your mother merely fell?  She doesn’t strike me as particularly clumsy.  In fact, just the opposite.”
He heard voices coming from the drawing room.  Hermione walked into the kitchen and gave Harry a huge smile.
Draco nodded solemnly.
The inch or so that was shaved at the nape felt like velvet against his hand.  The rest of it was long enough not to be considered short, but a good five inches had been trimmed off.  Harry found it most attractive.
“Well, I had a similar experience,” Hermione said.
“And you think you’re ready for that?”  Draco asked sincerely.  “Have you come out to anyone but Granger?”
“Okay, I get the picture,” Pansy chuckled.  “Yeah, he’s special, that one.”
“What’s wrong?  Am I hurting you?  I’m not
McGonagall sat quietly and nodded once.
“Nonsense.  There’s always more to tell.  And people want to know.”
“It looks great,” he smiled.  “It’s almost the same colour as your eyes.”
George put in a floo call to the Ministry to come for the would-be assassin.  After two Aurors came to collect him, and the excitement had died down, Draco insisted that Harry come back to Hogwarts with him.
Stepping out from behind Harry, Draco cast a Jelly Legs Jinx at Stephen.  The Ravenclaw fell to the floor, dropping his wand.
“Harry met with someone last night,” Ron blurted out.
“Tracey’s got Goldstein in ours.”
“Yes.  Thanks to Harry.  He’s been a big help.”  Knox sat in the vacant seat, third down from the Headmistress, next to the DADA professor and winked at him.
Ignoring his embarrassment, Hermione pushed forward. “You have several options available to you.  It only depends on whether you want to adopt, or have a biological child.”
Subconsciously, Draco rubbed at his forearm. He poured himself another drink.  “It was excruciating.  Aunt Bellatrix and that fucking Greyback held me down.  I thought I was prepared for the pain . . .”
Ron shut his mouth tight and shook his head.
“Go.  I’ll hold these for you,” she smiled.
“But what if it’s not early?  What of the baby is coming right on schedule?”
Before long, they were both caught up in the moment, nearly forgetting there was a purpose to jerking in a public lavatory.  Harry had returned the favor and was stroking Draco along with him.
“I don’t know,” Draco rubbed the back of his neck.  “Plus, there’s Harper, Blaise’s boyfriend.  He doesn’t seem to go anywhere without him.”
“Storm McGonagall’s office and use her floo, if I have to.”
“Malfoy, wait.”  Harry wasn’t sure what he wanted to say. But he wanted to say something.  He felt as though the pair had made progress toward peaceful coexistence, if not friendship. He also felt as though he may have ruined it already.
“It wasn’t for nothing,” Harry finally said. “I did notice you. I noticed the change in you. I looked forward to seeing you.” Harry chuckled at himself. “You didn’t need to be brought into the Ministry as often as you were. And it wasn’t Ministry policy to take informants out for a meal after questioning.”
Several minutes of the rhythmic movements brought them both close to climaxing.  Pansy’s moans became deeper, lower, almost growling.  Harry himself had begun to murmur as well.  The beat of the desk knickknacks banging together, the hum of Pansy’s moans and Harry’s grunts came together like a song.  A song sure to end on a high note.
“What is it?” Draco asked eagerly.
Draco frowned. “It’s just something I thought wasn’t in the cards for me.  Unless someone has invented a pregnancy spell for wizards,” he said.  He paused and glanced over at Ron and Hermione.  “I’m realizing that there is much more we don’t know about each other, than we do.”
Draco sat and looked at the package.  He couldn’t understand why Ron and Ginny’s mother would send him, of all people, a gift.  Harry opened his.  It was a scarf and glove set, hand knitted by Molly herself.  The set was green to match Harry’s eyes.
Harry cleared his throat subtly.
Several students laughed, and Hermione jabbed him in the ribs for asking a stupid question.
“Take me, Harry,” he whispered.
Draco blinked, as if he was surprised by Harry’s assessment, then finally answered, “Because it was the right thing to do.”
Draco shrugged.  “I didn’t notice.”
hdhdhd
“What are those?” Harry asked.
Harry backed up before Draco could do anything to stop him.  He turned and quickly descended the stair case.  Mortified on more than one level, Harry mentally berated himself for his foolhardy behavior.  Of course Draco would be entertaining a lover on a Saturday night.  The fact that it was Blaise Zabini was a bit surprising.  Harry was fairly certain he was straight and had been dating one of the Greengrass girls off and on.  Then again, anyone asked about Harry would have said he was straight as well.
“Oliver Wood.  He was my captain when I joined the team first year.  You don’t remember him?”
“I’ve never kissed you in public before either,” Harry said, leaning in before Draco realized what he was doing.
Music began to play, cueing them to walk down the aisle.  Harry held out his elbow for her to take hold. “Shall we?” he asked.
“I tripped,” Harry interrupted Draco’s explanation.  “I took poor Draco down with me,” he chuckled.
“Oh, yes, you couldn’t get rid of books. Your family must have an extensive collection,” Hermione perked up.
He smiled weakly back at her, then looked back at baby Rose. Ginny couldn’t possibly comprehend the obstacles he and Draco faced, even if they did decide to have children.
A slow grin grew on Harry’s face. “You like them.  You actually like them.”
“I know, but I figured it was rubbish and you’d given up on it long ago.”
“Absolutely,” Pansy replied.  “We need some fun around here.”  She jerked her head toward the rest of the Great Hall.  “Some of them are in desperate need of loosening up.”
“Astronomy Tower?”  Harry didn’t really have to ask.
Draco stopped.  “You want me to keep some clothes here?”  The corner of his mouth raised.
“Harry.  Wait.”  She bit her lip. “I’m sorry, you know.”
“He seemed disappointed that Malfoy didn’t care for him after all.”
“So . . . what are we going to do?” Hermione questioned.
“That’s what we came here for,” Draco scoffed.  “So you could tell
hdhdhd
“We will,” she smiled.  “Happy birthday,” she called out to Draco.
“Oh, Hermione, try the cake.” Harry winked at Ron.
Harry glanced up at Ron.  “Yeah.  It’s my own fault.”  He shook his head.  “Such reckless behavior.  Then I didn’t even have the good sense to keep my mouth shut about it.”
“They have been dating quite a long time.”  Draco bit his lip. “I’m sorry.  He isn’t my friend.  I guess I shouldn’t make fun.”
Draco snickered.  “I always wanted it that color.  It’s very soothing. But my father would never hear of it.”
“But Harry doesn’t,” Romilda insisted.  “I wonder where he is anyway.”  She gasped.  “You don’t supposed Malfoy made a pass at him, do you?  Maybe Harry grew ears and a tail and is too ashamed to show up.”
“All right,” Harry agreed.  “Are you two going to the masquerade?”
“What’s the matter Pans?  No one to fuck over the holidays?”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “I suppose it could be worse.  There really could be a girl in Potions you like.” For a second, he looked uncertain. “There isn’t, is there?”
She glanced up for a response.
“I’ve never been in love before,” he said, before he could censor himself.  Shit.
“Crikey, Ginny!  You look like you’ve swallowed a watermelon.  And that waddle.”
“What rumors?”
“Well, four months is a long time, considering we used to see each other every weekend before you started at Hogwarts,” she pointed out.  “By the way, how is it going this year?”
“Oh, that’s right. You don’t remember, but you tried to take advantage of my drunken state at that second wand party.”
“Did you eat anything, Harry?” Hermione asked.
“Uh,” Harry stood uncomfortably.  “You could say that.” He shot Hermione a look.
Sensing the hesitation, Draco offered, “You don’t have to.  It’s all right.”
“What?  I didn’t even ask a question.”
“Now?  Here, in front of everyone?”
“So, what now?” Harry finally asked, hoping Draco would have some brilliant insight.  But he simply shrugged.  “Do you think it’s chance that we keep ending up together every Friday night? Or something more?”
Resisting the urge to question her friend further, Hermione sighed.  “Will you come for supper?  Just you, me and Ron.”
Harry frowned.  “But Olivia Tifft said she couldn’t tell if they were my biological children.”
Rose wasn’t crying as much these days.  However, Ron still hadn’t figured out the secret to soothing her.  Occasionally, Hermione didn’t have any better luck. Christmas day was one of the baby’s good days, though, and everyone was happy to take a turn holding the seven week old.
Harry stood, “Listen, do you mind if I beg off tonight? I’m exhausted. I didn’t sleep last night, and I meant to take a nap but, then Dra– Malfoy came to my office. I just want to sleep. You understand, don’t you?”
“I thought you wanted children. I’ve never heard of anyone raising children in the castle.”
Draco’s eyes roamed hungrily over Harry’s body, lingering on the conspicuous bulge in his boxers. “If you don’t call yourself fit, I can’t imagine what you’d call me.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry frowned.  “I knew Skeeter would write something unflattering about me, but this is outrageous.  She called you predatory! I’m going to her office tomorrow and–”
“Harry, what are you doing here so late?”
“I guess.  I never thought of Malfoy as having any feelings before.”
“So, you saw first-hand this student’s difficulties?  Who is it?”
“I wanted to get her some sort of jewelry, but now that I’m here, I’m not sure what to get.”  Ron was looking at some books at that point.
Harry felt a pang of jealousy. “Oh. Okay then. Tomorrow morning at half-ten?”
“No.  Baby is not good name,” Margherita chimed in.  “Baby look like my two sister, Giada and Allegra.  You like this names?”
“No problem, mate.  I’m glad to get out of the office for lunch for a change.  Is everything all right?”
“She’s so tiny,” Draco commented.  By then, Harry had joined him.
“I never knew you had any sense of humor,” Ron said dryly.
“Cyril will show you to the holding room where you can meet with your guest,” Virgil said.
“And a tad higher up,” she breathed.
“Do you feel up to making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside?” Draco leered. “But you have to promise to stop thinking about babies, and concentrate on me,” he smirked.
Harry's mind was racing in a thousand different directions.  Malfoy hadn’t been precisely what he was expecting.  There were glimpses of his arrogance and attitude.  But generally speaking, he was a humbled version of his former self.  His gratitude took Harry by surprise, leaving him feeling . . .
“Two months?  You just got finished complaining that we weren’t married yet.”
Draco shook his head.  “That’s a frightening thought.  Even as an adult.”  He paused.  “So, we have the night all to ourselves?”
“The marks are still very faint.”  She pulled his scarf a bit tighter around his neck.  “There.  Now they won’t show at all.”
’ bullshit stories?”
Standing, and gaining courage, Harry took out money to cover their meals and a tip.  “And for the record, meeting you wasn’t a waste of my time at all.  You’re perfectly lovely company.  I hope you find a nice bloke who deserves you.”
Harry shrugged.  “I don’t think there’s anything more to say about it.  I don’t know why it wasn’t working.  It just wasn’t.”  He paused before asking his question. As he moved one of his knights, he casually, and without looking at Draco asked quietly, “Were you afraid of him?” He knew he didn’t have to elaborate.  Draco would know exactly which ‘him’ Harry meant.
“I’ll bet he had some vile things to say.  I wish he had never started all of this.  My mother doesn’t need him.  We don’t need him.”
“Feels like weeks. Did you forget that you said you would come with me?”
February 14, 1999
As Draco began to read about the legendary match between Puddlemere United and the Haileybury Hammers, Harry wriggled and settled in deeper.  The Slytherin Head had a pleasant voice and just the right inflection, making the statistical prose sound like poetry.  Harry often thought that Draco’s future children would be lucky to have a father like him to read bedtime stories to them.  Having never been read to as a child, Harry was envious of the make-believe children.
Blaise remained silent as he finished putting on his Quidditch ensemble. Draco also began putting on protective gear, intending to fly with his teammate.
“Who says I was alone?” she smirked.  “Actually, I left my quill in Divinations today and I came to get it.”  She held it up.  “Why are you here?”
“Do you need help?” Hermione offered.
Draco looked at Harry.  “It isn’t just about the sex, right?”
When she walked into the Great Hall, Romilda Vane tried to cover her face.  She had combed her hair in an attempt to cover her forehead and even considered cutting fringe to hide it.  She glared at Susan Bones as she walked past the Hufflepuff table. A group of them giggled.
“Harry,” Draco opened his eyes. “I know you well enough to know that you wouldn’t have suggested that.”
“My only friend. My only
Trying to hide his gratification, Harry suggested they find Hermione and go to the Three Broomsticks for lunch.
“Is something wrong?” Draco asked as he pulled back.
“Um.” She wasn’t sure how to answer.  She had been, but not for the reason he probably thought.  Seamus had chosen her wand at the third party.  She refused to do everything he requested of her, and so she broke out in boils for the following week.  Feeling embarrassed and ugly, Tracey didn’t want anyone to see her, but especially Anthony.
“What?  Oh.  No, not yet.” Then the lightness returned to Draco’s face.  “Don’t forget to pack some nice clothes.  I want to make some people jealous as well.  There are some very fine restaurants I’m told.  Though I’m quite certain you’ll be the best dish.”
“Everything all right?”
“Whose wand is this?” Blaise questioned.
Hermione casually wandered to his side as he nibbled on crisps by the buffet.  She addressed him without looking at him, so they wouldn’t appear to know one another.  She was dressed in a beautiful pale blue ball gown with a rather low neck and bodice that pushed her breasts up high, causing them to just about spill over the top.  Even Harry couldn’t help notice.  Her cleavage rivaled Pansy’s.
“Oi, Draco.  Where have you been?”
“Harry, you don’t need to explain,” Hermione said.  “I think Ron and I can figure out what’s going on.”
“Ron, you don’t really believe all that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote about him , do you?” Harry questioned defensively.
Reaching for Harry’s crotch, Draco replied, “The large protuberance in your pants might have given me a hint.”
Looking a bit sheepish, Hermione continued.  “After speaking with you last night, the idea just popped in my head.  All I’m asking is one evening with her.  She’s quite pretty.”
“Nice to meet you.”
With a small smile on his lips, Harry silently pulled his foot out of his shoe.  He took a quick peek around. There were a few students in the library, but most of them were deeply focused on their own potion essays.  Harry’s foot slid leisurely across the floor, searching for its target.  It gently bumped against Draco’s shoe.
“Harry, what happened?” Hermione questioned.  “Where’s Greyback?”
“Let me put it this way.  If you do not cooperate, the Ministry will do everything in its power to retrieve Harry. That includes destroying the Manor if necessary.  And Draco’s safety will not be guaranteed.”
“Yes, please.  My Fourth Years and I will be coming in at half-eleven today.”
“Yeah,” Harry answered.  “So maybe it’s just a phase I’m going through.  After breaking up with Ginny.”
Harry nodded.  “You once told me that you would tell me if you were unhappy, even at the risk of arguments and hurt feelings. You’ve kept your end of the bargain.  But I have failed.”
“And you want me to convince him to take it.”
“Draco?” Trelawney leaned forward.  “I thought you looked familiar.”
“Thank you.  That was more effective than a cold shower,” Draco said.  “And you did earlier, by the way.”
Lucius handed them each a small glass of golden liquid. “This will put some hair on your chest,” he grinned.
“Don’t speak. You can tell me later, when you’ve recovered.” Harry wasn’t about to let him say his goodbyes. That was as good as giving up. He wasn’t going to give up and he wasn’t going to allow Draco to either. He continued to breathe on Draco’s hands, satisfied that he had gotten his way.
“Are you here to break up with me?”
In her high pitched, lilting voice, Luna urged her partner on, encouraging him or her to bring Luna the ultimate pleasure.
“Beside the point.”
“Isn’t that a good thing?” asked Ron.
you to bottom for me.  But what I want tonight, right now, is for you to fuck me.”
“Well, the best way to decide if you want to work in the hospital is to come and observe, do some volunteer work.  Then, if you think you’d like to, you can join the apprentice program.”
“Eight?  That’s hardly trying. I’ve read that some of the muggle best sellers had been rejected dozens of times before they were picked up.  You just need to find the right agency.”
Wyndam returned with parchment and quill in hand. He sat down with Harry going over details of their arrangement, while Rita began a list of questions to ask Harry.
They all raised their glasses.  Except for Draco, who refused to have anything else in his hand as long as he was holding little Cissy.
The Death Eater at Harry’s feet began to stir, prompting Draco to hit him with another stunner.
“For the room.  No green or red.  So, how about blue?  With lavender accents.”
“Has Draco given you any reason to think he’s insincere?”
Justin Finch-Fletchley sat on the window seat in the Hufflepuff common room with his arms crossed and a scowl on his face.
That time, he distinctly heard him say ‘he’, when referring to his future love.  Suddenly, the improbable seemed possible.  If only he could find a way into the Gryffindor’s lonely heart.
She wiped away a tear and composed herself.  “So, what brought this on in the first place?”
From across the room, Miranda shouted, “To us, that is a boy.”  She and Horace laughed heartily.
“Your shirt is buttoned wrong. You have an extra hole at the top and your collar is crooked.”
Millicent narrowed her eyes.  “Maybe.”  She thought a second. “Come on Finch-Fletchley, you’re going to clean my room.”  Justin garnered many a sympathetic look as Millicent dragged him up to her dormitory.
“You’d think.  Like I said, price is a factor.  But you probably wouldn’t want a garish two carat blue diamond set in yellow gold.  Your hands are small and delicate.  A ring like that would overpower you.  A man asking for your hand should know what suits you.”
“No.” Olivia said matter-of-factly.  “Emotionally, these are your children.”
Draco cleared his throat.  He was much more nervous than he expected to be.  With hundreds of eyes on him, and ears hanging on his every word, his voice cracked several times before he was able to begin. Behind him, best man Blaise gave him a reassuring pat on his shoulder.
I smile at her, just as softly, and say, “Of course I did. You didn’t seem like the type to murder your uncle without reason, and I
As if in a dream, Harry walks over to the toilet stall.
consequently, I've made the decision to switch to writing something else for the next couple of days at least, until I see how the response to this new chapter is. if the response is sufficient enough to motivate my brain into wanting to write this again, then I'll gladly switch back to writing it. otherwise, this could be the end of this fic.
By the time Harry has settled and refocused herself, McGonagall is back.
Harry is still staring into my eyes. Then her eyes dart down towards my lips, and my heartbeat quickens. My own eyes mimic her motion, and I am entranced by her lips. I notice that they’re still a bit swollen from when she’d been biting them, and so I lean closer to get a better look, just in case she’s actually hurt herself.
I nod and say, “Just your toiletries left.”
I quickly purchase a long-sleeved polka dot t-shirt, a pair of white shorts, and a comfortable pajama set. Then I hurry back to the car. Thankfully, I’ve made it back before the meter has run out.
“Would you like a drink?” she asks, taking one for herself and sitting back down.
Harry grins. “I did!”
Ron splutters incoherently and Harry glances between Ron and Malfoy, trying to decide what to do.
“I’m glad you stopped here too,” I say.
Then I realize that I still need to respond to what she has said, so I say, “I don’t really know where I want to go– I just can’t stay still.”
“Ah right, introductions. I’m Draco Malfoy. I’ve just been wandering aimlessly for a while,” she says. She tips forward slightly onto the balls of her feet, then settles back down.
I pull my legs into the bed, and then she tucks the covers down around me. A few moments later, the bed compresses as she gets under the covers on the other side. I fling my hand over to her side of the bed, and she takes it. “Sleep well, Harry,” she says.
Honestly, the thing that annoyed Harry the most about Astoria joining was that her presence forced Harry to refer to both sisters by first name, which didn’t really fit the enemy vibe they were going for.
With that, she grabs Ron’s and Ginny’s hands, turns, and walks off into the small crowd of waiting parents, cutting off any chance Malfoy might have had to respond. A part of Harry is trying to tell her that this is a coward’s move, but Harry thinks that it’s better to end the confrontation now, before it escalates to violence– again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then the song begins, and Harry has to hurry to her start position. From here she is able to watch her troupe-mates performing, and she almost starts to lose herself in the rhythm of watching her friends.
Eventually, I feel Draco stir in her sleep. I can feel that she’s awake now, but she doesn’t retract her hand or move away.
I refocus on finding my room and remind myself that my only goal at the moment has to be to get away.
And just fyi, I don’t care how long it’s been since I’ve posted, I still want your comments!! And any comment, no matter the length, is appreciated!!!
I nod solemnly, though I know that nothing she tells me will make me abandon her. And, well, I think I know what she’s going to tell me.
I blanch. I thought she had already seen, in the mirror, the bruises Vernon had left behind, and either hadn’t said anything, or hadn’t cared.
Harry still looks so distressed that I can’t control myself any longer. I slide over to her on the bed and place my arm around her shoulders, rubbing at her arm soothingly. She chokes on her sob and presses her hands into her eyes. I get the feeling that she needs to let this all out, so I hold my silence, even though it kills me a little to see her like this.
“I can’t believe she said that? I mean I can, it is Malfoy, but god, your part was incredible, Harry,” Ginny says.
“Did anyone see where Malfoy went?” Harry asks the group at large.
“Thanks guys,” Harry says. “I can’t believe–”
I’d assumed that since she’d looked so exhausted when I’d seen her, she would be heading for somewhere to sleep, and I’d been quickly proven right when she pulled into a motel parking lot.
After a moment of this, I head back out of the bathroom. While I had been showering, Draco has finished packing up and cleaning.
“You’ve been nervous all day,” I say gently. I wish she would just come out and say it, whatever it is, because I hate to see her worrying like this.
As soon as they are clear of the stage, Ron and Ginny stop and clap Harry on the back.
My stomach drops, and I wonder who she’d met while I had been selling my car– and what I’m going to do without my car, now that Draco has found her person.
“Well? Did you come here to gloat?” Malfoy asks snidely.
Ron narrow her eyes and says, “Are you sure she’s worth it.”
“I do hope you like what I got for you,” Draco says. “I had to make a guess.”
“Good luck, I guess,” Ginny says.
I shake my head as she starts dancing next to me. “I don’t– I don’t know how to dance.” The thought of Petunia letting me
But she can’t dwell on it yet, because the music is swelling once again. Harry gets to her feet and lowers her arms slowly as she turns to face the semicircle again. She takes a few hesitant steps towards the circle, then comes to a halt.
I roll the window down, enjoying the wind blowing through my braid. The dappled moonlight is streaming down onto the road and into the car. I take a deep breath of the crisp night air, then exhale it slowly.
I quickly found, however, that my gender kept me from getting anywhere. No matter how hard I worked, how much overtime I pulled, or how many people I schmoozed, I never received any recognition or advancement.
“So I decided that enough was enough. I reached over and grabbed the fireplace poker and hit him over the head as hard as I could. He collapsed to the floor– dead.” She pulls her hands away from her face and shifts so she’s facing me, finally making eye contact. “I’m a murderer, Draco. I decided to kill him and I did and then I tossed his body into a swamp.”
We spend the first little bit of the drive in companionable silence.
Thankfully, the bruises have long since faded away, or else the sight of them, in addition to the things Harry is telling me, might have driven me to do something rash.
And he’d laughed at me. Actually laughed at me. The disappointment and loneliness that had been swirling around in my gut morphed into anger, rushing straight to my head. I’d stalked forward, moving around his desk.
I shift slightly on the bed and release Harry’s hand so I can gently cup the back of her neck. From here, I can feel the rapid beat of her heart against my palm. Harry’s lips are slightly chapped, and I hesitate for the slightest moment before I run my tongue along her lips.
“My name is technically Rose Potter, and… well, god it’s hard to know where to begin…” Harry says, still looking anywhere but at me.
I give her a moment to see if she’ll continue, but she just averts her eyes again by looking around at the bland motel decorations. I reach out and grab one of her hands, holding it between both of my own. “Harry, I already know,” I say.
“Yes, you. I knew it from the moment I saw you at the gas station,” Draco says.
She nods, and then she shifts her hand as if to remove it. I hold it in place for a moment longer, then release her.
“You’d do that for me?” I ask.
“And we’ll help you,” Ginny says. “Just, you gotta wait till after the dance.”
“What was the rate for the room?” she asks.
I return the smile and hand her the scissors.
“Are you sure? I don’t really– I can’t really afford to pay you back for this,” I say. My budget doesn’t include the price of takeout, and as hungry as I am, I don’t want to take advantage of her kindness.
“Excuse me,” a voice says from right behind me.
After several long moments where we both remain still, Draco says, “What plans do you have for today?”
Harry throws a look at where Malfoy has seemingly appeared from nowhere, then turns her back on the girl. “I feel like there has to be something,” Harry says, just to Ron and Ginny.
She pauses, then says, “You’re very welcome, Harry.”
It had been that moment, in the middle of my colleague’s announcement, that I had stood from my desk and marched into my boss’s office. I went and told him: “I
By the time she walks out of the bathroom, Harry has managed to shake off her stupor, replacing it with a determination to dance her heart off and prove, once and for all, that she’s earned her solo.
Unfortunately, there is nothing more of use in the wallet. I replace all the cards that I had removed and climb back out of the car. I reopen the trunk, then pause for a moment. I had been planning to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but I hesitate. If I do that, then it will be easy for the body to be identified, and I don’t think I want that.
Draco smiles again and says, “I would be perfectly happy to.”
Whatever Malfoy was going to say in response is cut off by the dance team coach calling them to order, so Malfoy scoffs and walks off with a final glare at Harry and Ron.
The next morning, I stop at a gas station. It’s located in one of the larger towns I’ve been through. It’s now past time for the shops to be open, and I’m quite grateful to be able to finally stop driving, at least for a bit. I’m beginning to get so tired that I’m worried I’ll crash, so once I get some hair dye I plan to check into a motel until tomorrow.
I blink dazedly as this statement sinks in. Then I think back to the first time I saw Harry, to that feeling I’d gotten, deep in my chest, as I’d realized that Harry was the one I’d been looking for.
I climb stiffly out of the car and head inside to pay for my gas. Then I head back out to fill up the car’s tank. Nothing quite like driving through the night to empty your gas tank.
Then she hears the musical cue that means there are mere seconds left until it’s time for her to go on stage. Harry gets into her starting position and takes one last deep breath.
I give my hair a toss, making brief eye contact with Draco in the mirror before I blush and quickly look away. “I was going to cut my hair, too,” I say, reaching for the scissors.
“What?  I don’t remember that.”
The boy remained silent.
Harry closed his eyes.  “Fine.  Okay?  It’s a boy.  Are you happy?”
Hermione drew in a breath to retort Ron’s sarcastic remark.  But he kissed her before she could utter a word.
“I’m sorry about what my father did to your mother,” Knox said sincerely.
Draco slumped his shoulders.  “I promised I wouldn’t tell.”
Draco came back from the loo smiling. “You’re fidgeting.  Are you nervous or something?” he teased.
“When was the last time you had a date?” Hermione questioned.  “Even Malfoy seems to be more social than you.”
“Personally, I’d rather not,” Draco said.  “I’m ready to move on.”  He twirled an oversized silver ring around his finger.  “So, are you going to help me with this. Or are you going to do laundry?”
“I had a talk with Knox,” Harry told him.  “He’s going to back off.”
Pulling away, Ron smiled at Hermione.
“That’s Mother,” Draco said.  “I’ve got to go.  I’ll call again soon.  Love you.”
“I’m not,” Harry said.  “We should slow down and really get to know each other better.  See what we have here.  See if it’s something that will last.”
“What about your other friends?  Longbottom or Finnigan?”
“True,” Harry conceded. “I am looking forward to seeing your little bum all tanned.  But really, I don’t see why having children should stop people from going on holiday. We’ll just choose places that are kid friendly.”
The man leaned forward as if to drive his point further.  “Mr. Malfoy, it is imperative that you answer these questions with one hundred percent honesty.”
“Oh Draco, you are most definitely not like any other man,” Harry said.
Ron subconsciously rolled his eyes while Hermione sighed.
Harry shook his head.  “Nothing. I’m simply not ready to be in a relationship right now is all.”
By the end of the day, Harry had lost any patience for his students and the last unfortunate class of the day was relegated to writing an essay on the immorality of using Dark Magic.  He sat at his desk, head in hand as the students wrote in silence.  All he could think about was talking to Draco.
“But you could have gotten Goyle and had Granger and Weasley get me,” Draco pressed.
Harry glanced around then settled on Draco’s hopeful expression.
“Oh, perhaps I should be caring for you then,” Draco said sarcastically.
“You missed a spot,” Draco told him and licked a bit of cum off the corner of Harry’s mouth. “But what about you?”
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “You have to promise.  Draco probably still won’t be happy about you and me being friendly.  If you make him feel uncomfortable again, or have him doubting my feelings for him--”
Laughing, Harry agreed, “Good. ‘Cause I don’t want to tell you about that stuff.”  His mood turned more serious.  “Are you going to be okay with all of this?”
“Whatcha want, Malfoy?” Ron asked, not exactly in a friendly manner.
Harry nodded in agreement.
They continued to walk in silence among the chatter of the crowd, and music playing over the loudspeaker.
“Weasley all but confirmed it.”
“Not at all,” she answered quickly.  “In fact,” her heart started to beat faster as she contemplated what she was about to say.  “I was hoping the second time would be even better.”
Ron pursed his lips.  It was a losing battle if Hermione was on their side.  He was odd man out in this particular situation.
“That’s a good idea, Mione. I’ll think about it.”  Harry yawned widely.  “Better be getting to bed.”
“I want you,” he murmured against Harry’s mouth.
Draco Malfoy, Potions Master
Harry leveled his wand at Boot, ready to hex him with the first thing that came to mind.  But Draco put a hand on his arm and forced it down.
Ron swiftly scooped Hermione into his arms and kissed her passionately enough to make Ginny blush next to them.  Harry and Draco kissed tenderly, finishing long before Ron released Hermione.
It really wasn’t funny, but Harry had to stifle a giggle at the burst of energy from the formerly lethargic man. Draco had always been in such control, Harry couldn’t recall ever hearing him swear like that before.
“How about blue?”
“What can’t you do that you want to?”
“Are you certain?” Draco was still subconsciously frowning. “You seemed so . . . ready before.”
“Oh, Granger,” Draco called out.
“Now don’t start crying again,” Draco said. “I know you don’t want to hear this, but you will get over it.  And in the meantime, you have to keep up your studies.  Especially in my class.  I can’t show you any more favoritism.”
“I have to.  You could come with me, if you’d like.”
Draco’s turn came and he withdrew a wand, frowning.  “This is my wand,” he said.
to cum.  Please take it off.”  Harry barely breathed out.
“You’re hardly eating,” Harry remarked.  “Don’t you like it?”
“You’ll have to choose my wand next week then,” he winked.
“Harry, you can’t let them intimidate you,” Hermione said as Harry turned to leave.  “You have to eat.”
Putting his arm around Draco’s shoulder, Harry asked, “What did your mother say?”
As Draco came, his muscles clenched tightly around Harry, bringing him along. They kept eye contact through their climaxes, feeling closer than ever before.
“I’m sorry I walked out on you in those lacy pants,” Harry smirked.
Breaking the silence, Malfoy spoke as the entered. “You were expecting me, weren’t you?”
“You know, I don’t really feel well.  Maybe I’m coming down with something.”
He’d been too overwhelmed to speak when the mediwitch placed the baby in his arms.  All he could do was stare. He knew Harry was standing nearby, equally anxious, but he couldn’t take his eyes off his precious newborn daughter.
“Hm. Sectum Sempra?  Why no, I don’t think I have,” Goshawk eyed up Draco, who had been relatively quiet until then.
Draco’s eyes were large and wide while his father yelled at him.  He felt like a child being disciplined.  He snorted and took in a breath, but before he could speak a word, a hand gripped his arm.
After less than an hour, Harry was finished his essay for Advanced Herbology.  It took him much less time than he thought, and he was silently berating himself for putting it off.  He looked around the empty common room, bored.  Wishing that he had, in fact, gone to the party, Harry wondered whose wand Draco plucked from the cauldron.  Would fate have brought them together again if Harry had gone?  He figured he would never know.
“Good evening Professors,” McGonagall appeared out of nowhere.
“But my friend Althea and you would get along so well. Please?  Just go out with her one time.”
Draco smirked and settled back into place.  Harry grinned and brought the book of parchment to the sofa and lay down.  He relaxed as Draco’s smooth voice brought his story to life.
“Yes, I certainly have.”
