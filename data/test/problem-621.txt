"Yes," it seemed her non-aggressive reaction was encouraging him, "last year. Don't you remember how I helped you get through all the tasks? Why would I have done that if my goal was to harm you?"
Professor Snape lifted an eyebrow. "It seems so. Magic does not simply disappear. It had to settle somewhere."
"Like you." Professor Snape confirmed. "And like you, he foolishly used it against someone whose intentions could not be considered as 'true evil'. Therefore… the curse backfired. Instead of the one he intended to hit, the curse hit the one it deemed more evil."
There was a tingling sensation somewhere in her stomach. She felt the sudden urge to throw herself into his arms. But that would probably cause the boy to have a heart attack since she was still wearing her Invisibility Cloak.
“The one who always has her nose stuck inside a book.” The girl elaborated. Hermione then. Interesting. That was almost as good as an apology.
Before Haley went to bed that night, she made sure to put her mum's clasp in her hair. And she squeezed her hand into one of her brother's gloves for good measure. It was a tight fit but luckily her hands were fairly small. She would be able to explore the dream corridor tonight! Haley was almost too excited to fall asleep. She took a deep calming breath and closed her eyes.
"I'll look over it before dinner," he told the girl as he reached for his cup of tea. A cup of Earl Gray was the best way to start the day.
Once Draco's heart had calmed down somewhat, there was a tingling sensation that filled his whole body from head to toe. What was it he was feeling? It reminded him of flying but it was even better than that. He wanted to tell someone. Anyone. How was he supposed to keep this to himself?
I want him to always smile like that. I don't want him to wake up and long for a dream he can never achieve.
her. She was about ninety per cent sure that he liked her. It was strange how he was expressing his feelings in so many different ways like actions or looks or his behaviour but he had never straight out said that he
“What does it mean?” I ask quietly. The words make me think of a time when I used to fill up pages in my journal with the exact same combination of names. When I was in love for the first time. The words don’t make me feel giddy any more. They make me feel like I’m looking at a memory. Something that’s in the past and has nothing to do with my present self any more. How strange. My heart used to be ready to burst, when I only thought of Neville and now… it doesn’t even flutter any more. Funny, how you can paint the future in the most vibrant colours but one step in a different direction can blur the picture and lead you somewhere else entirely.
revenge. It had just been a stupid nightmare. But then why did she feel so bad about it? And what in Merlin's name did Neville have to do with all of this?
This takes place during chapter 3 of Songs of Yesterday, when Haley asks Michael Corner to be her date.
"What are you staring at, Potter?" He sneered derisively, before rolling his eyes and marching past her down the hall they had come from. It seemed like he had lost the fight. Or won it? Haley shook her head, feeling even more confused than she had before talking to Malfoy. What was the meaning of this? If she wasn't mistaken, he had tried to say he was sorry… in his own clumsy way. Even if he hadn't straight out said the words. But what else could this have been about?
"Where?" The blond asks, turning around. Ha. I didn't think this would actually work. Now to Zabini. I make a swift gesture with my hand in his direction like I'm trying to get rid off a fly. And just like that he vanishes. So far so good. Closing my eyes, I quickly envision Zabini's appearance and will myself to look like him.
The first steps were an easy routine. Heating up the water. Adding ingredients. Stirring the liquid. He'd done that a thousand times. He didn't know how much time had gone by when the potion was ready and it was time to sprinkle the golem with it. He filled up a small flask with the light blue liquid, ready to pour it over the golem.
"Actually, I did. I… saw you scaring a group of boys almost to death because they'd been mean to your little brother. It involved gobstones as well, I think." He added that last bit almost casually.
It was a sobering realisation: Malfoy… He seemed to genuinely care… about her. Unfortunately this realisation raised another question: How did she feel about him?
Haley sighed. "Still, let's talk to her first. All right?" She made a step closer and took his hand carefully.
"Yes," he replies. "I've always liked the song but sometimes… I really hate it." There is definitely something in his eyes. Something sad… or even
Professor Snape nodded. "Tempted by the description, he used the curse against his enemy without knowing exactly how it worked."
"Like I thought," she declared in a thoughtful tone, "Murtlap Essence. Let me guess, you made this from strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles?" She didn't wait for an answer. The liquid indeed looked like the one Hermione had made for her the other day.
“I…” The question seemed to confuse him. Didn’t Slytherins have friends? He frowned. “Still… it seemed quite serious. Your fight.”
"Speaking of a different matter," the man continued. "I have not received an owl from you yet. I have been wondering… why that is?"
They were all relieved when they were finally allowed to leave the Knight Bus. Haley didn't understand why that bus was so fascinating to Ron. All it did was make her nauseous and throw its passengers around like billiard balls.
"In love? Ha. That's fun." Honestly, how'd she get that idea? I shake my head, denying her suggestion. "I'm not in love. Don't you think I would have noticed that?"
Just as he was putting the helmet on, he heard soft foot steps drawing nearer. They got louder and louder and Draco swore they passed him, but… there was no one to be seen! For a second Draco thought, he was hearing things. Then he remembered, how he had seen Potter's head floating in the air in Hogsmeade last year. It had to be an Invisibility Cloak of some kind. Father had told him once, that these cloaks were extremely rare. So of course the golden girl had to be owning one.
Hermione looked from Luna to Rita, biting her lips. "Haley, is… there anything you would like to… um… revise?"
him. She had – There was a strange sensation going on inside him. Something warm was pulling at his insides. But it wasn't unpleasant. Far from it. The night hadn't been a waste after all.
Everything hurt. His body felt as if he had been launched right off the Astronomy Tower. Which was only slightly exaggerated.
Harry began peeing forcefully into the bushes. When the stream finally tampered off, he shook himself dry, before jumping at the sound of a throat clearing.
Draco was quiet for a moment as he watched the other’s movements. He could tell that something was still bothering his boyfriend. “Okay, out with it- what’s wrong?” He asked suspiciously.
To Harry, he honestly still didn’t know quite what to think of what had occurred last night- not the sex though, that was great.
“One good thing about being outdoors is at least you can go anywhere and not worry about the mess you leave behind.” Harry moaned as another fart bubbled out of him.
After a minute, while Draco’s pee was still going on, the blonde spread his legs further apart and farted really loudly.
“Where are you going?” Harry asked, a bit grumpily as he had been looking forward to having a morning cuddle with the other for their first morning together in their new house.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I know you didn’t wipe yourself properly. And I will not have you bathing in the same tub as Teddy and I without being properly wiped. Now scoot up, Potter. It’s not like I haven’t been acquainted with any of this before.” He gave a sneer, but his eyes were twinkling.
Sighing, Draco wrinkled his nose at the smell and waved a hand around his arse as he cuddled to Harry’s side once more.
“Thank Merlin for our metabolisms or we would be as fat as pigs by now.” Draco shifted in the sofa to make himself comfortable.
“Okay, what did you have in mind…mnh!…with Teddy?” Draco asked, grunting a bit as he pushed a booming blast of gas out, his face red with the effort.
“By that time, she just barely changed my diapers- maybe once a day, if she remembered? I kind of had to train myself to use the toilet or else suffer the stench of my own waste and deal with the diaper rash I got for hours later on.” Harry shrugged, not really bothered anymore in regards to what he suffered at the Dursley’s.
“Yes. So in order to make the mess disappear, you will cast Evanesco. This works much better with a wand, but you should be able to clean yourself enough using this motion- now watch.” Making a half-circle motion with his hand and curling his hand slightly, he said, “Evanesco.”
Harry nodded. “Exactly. Now, one of the things that big boys do is they learn how to use the potty. Do you know what that is?”
Draco sighed. “Of course not, Harry. Hermione said it herself- to prevent any accidents or ill-will, Hogwarts makes it so I have to use the facilities here.” He reminded the other.
He then remembered that he and Draco were currently Glamping and must have fallen asleep after having another good shag.
“Next is a spell that you will not be able to use until you get your wand. Mmh…Thankfully, the wizard robes that you have has charms spelled to help with the smell. This is a spell that can clear the air, getting rid of any bad smells you make. It’s called Olefacio minuere.” Taking his wand, Draco casted Olefacio minuere.
With the light from the full moon above them, Harry smiled as he watched his lover swim along with the fishes.
Draco frowned at him but before he could comment, a small but audible burp suddenly escaped his lips, followed by a sharp fart.
Laying in bed, both of them were nude although not because they had made love, but because they had wanted to feel one another’s body against their own, wanting to feel the warmth and protection and love as their naked bodies touched every inch together.
Harry playfully glared at the other, although deep down he was relieved that his boyfriend was getting back to his normal self again. “Well, do you think you can do any better?” He challenged.
Draco could feel when Harry’s body finally gave in, as his body stiffened and Draco could feel a round mound form, stretching the pants material as it keep growing larger underneath the palm of the blond’s hand.
Draco just smirked as he sipped his own coffee- although to Harry, with 3 creams and 5 sugars inside, it’s was barely considered coffee anymore.
As soon as Draco bent over to open the lower shelf, a loud fart sound came out of nowhere, making Draco jump back up and cover his bum with his hand.
Letting out a loud groan of relief, Harry just tossed his clothes as close as he could to where Draco’s laid before squatting down and letting out more bursts of chunky diarrhea.
His bathroom habits were usually pretty regular. He would poop at least once every other day, maybe twice depending. But since their toilet was still out of commission and due to his poo-shyness, Harry was just unable to go.
“Well, I wanted to make sure we both enjoyed our little getaway together.” Harry winked, biting into a slice of pineapple that his boyfriend fed to him in return.
Teddy and Harry cackled loudly as Draco blushed, but soon enough the blond also joined in their laughter. “Excuse me.” He chuckled.
Draco reached up and held Harry’s face, lightly but firmly making the brunette meet his eyes. “Harry. We promised that we would be open with each other about anything and never lie to one another. You shared your childhood with those horrid muggles to me and I shared the torture I went through when Voldemort was living under my roof. We both know each other too well for you to lie to me now- and yes, it’s completely obvious that you’re lying about being alright even though I know you’re anything but right now.”
Harry moaned as another sharp cramp hit him. He slipped off his shoes and socks and bundled them together with his shorts and knickers, leaving his bottom half bare like Draco.
Draco held his own arms up and Teddy readily went into them, giggling as the blonde placed kisses all over his face.
Sniffing the air and finding it tolerable again, Draco fixed his pants, making sure he vanished everything properly and did a quick Tergeo as well. He would still need a shower (cleaning spells were alright but the feeling of dirtiness never truly went away unlike a nice warm bath does) but he wanted to cuddle with his lover for a while before they can both bathe, together.
“Harry’s right. Teddy is in good hands, Aunt.” Draco agreed, putting a comforting hand on her arm. “Now you go and enjoy yourself- and please tell mother to do the same.”
They enjoyed each other’s embrace for a few more minutes before Harry felt another, much larger vibrating on his lap and actually heard the barking *BRRRRRAAAPPP!* burping out from his lover’s arse this time.
“Actually, I wanted to ask you two a favor. Teddy is almost two now and I think this would be the right time for him to learn how to be potty trained.” She explained. “I would teach him myself but I think you two might be better at this- with being males and all.”
“Oh, shut up.” Draco blushed as he dropped his hand, sticking his tongue out at Harry before going back to getting the marmalade.
Harry enjoyed the snake exhibit— he made good friends with one of the pythons and Draco had to talk him out of helping this snake from escaping the exhibit too.
Which made some sense because they never needed to hold it in for long (only needing to excuse themselves to find a bit of privacy or if they were confident enough and with the right spells, could go right where they were without anyone finding out (the robes that wizards wore could hide anything underneath them).
The following day, the three enjoyed visiting Muggle London together, where Harry decided to bring them all to the zoo.
Wide eyes behind round glasses widened as a small brown spot bloomed right at the middle of the other’s arse before the small dot slowly became larger and wider.
Harry smiled. “That’s right. Now, instead of peeing or pooping in their diapers, big boys will either go the Muggle way- in the loo or if they were wizards, they can go in their knickers but use magic to clean themselves.”
Harry quickly shook his head and gave the other a reassuring smile. “I’m fine love, just a bit tired. The coffee probably isn’t working as well today.” He lied.
He let Harry pull his body into a hug and listened when Harry finally spoke up. “Do you know how much I’ve been holding that in? Merlin, I feel better.”
Harry gritted his teeth, shaking his head as he tried to take deep breaths in an effort to lessen the cramp. The bugger really hurt!
“For the Wizarding way, it usually takes longer to learn it because magic is involved. Mother taught me the hand motions and how to harness my young magic back then to clean myself and vanish the waste away. Although I couldn’t do anything about the smell- one usually needs a wand for that level of magic.” Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, who could do the spell both wandlessly and wordlessly.
Harry sighed as he finished the rest of his cup. “Oh well, I do love the taste it gives you though.” He winked as Draco grinned back.
“I think it’s time we head back.” Draco suggested, straightening the loose curls from Teddy’s head (for that day, Teddy went with blond curls, alike a combination of Harry and Draco’s own).
Harry gave his boyfriend a sympathetic noise at that. "Ah. Sorry about that love- I know we both ate a little more than we should have.” They pretty much devoured everything, leaving only a few potatoes and a bit of the paella left.
The couple engaged conversation, talking about their upcoming plans, what they needed from grocery store and other mundane things that made Harry once again thankful that this was his life.
Draco rolled his eyes but he had a smile on his lips, and a bit of red tinted his cheekbones. “Figures. Well, it’s not like I’m unaccustomed to your constant staring problem anyway. And you’re the only one I feel comfortable around so I guess it’s more of a benefit that I don’t need to always leave the room in order to go.”
Harry didn’t really understand his thoughts, but at the same time, he understood a little more of how he felt now.
“No one else knows that I do it- it only happens when I’m very full and if I’m alone in private.” Draco whispered.
Draco chuckled, as he nodded. “More like brunch at this point really. What are you in the mood for? Maybe a sandwich…roast beef sound good?”
“Alright, so can I know why are you so against going the wizardly way?” Draco asked, looking nothing but curious at this.
He pulled his lover along and sat down on the rug, urging the blond to do the same. His grin widened when he heard the soft moan the other let out as they sunk into the rug’s unexpected softness.
When the sun was finally down, Harry used his magic and grinned when his lover let out a gasp when their entire campsite was lit in twinkling fairy lights and soft glowing lanterns, giving in the area very romantic feel.
Lifting his other hand, he cupped Harry’s face so that the other looked directly at him. “Harry, when was the last time you defecated?”
Harry nodded. “Yup, you can use this for now and once you get bigger, you can use the adult potty, okay?” When Teddy agreed, Harry hesitated for a few seconds before he grabbed the top of his pants and pulled it down, along with his knickers, just low enough so his cock sprung free.
And if that wasn’t enough, Draco involuntarily lifted his bum up slightly and had followed up with an equally loud fart right after.
When Draco finished about a few more chapters of his book, he decided to put it away as he watched his lover throw a few ingredients into one of the cast-iron pots and then start preparing the steaks.
“Shhh…it’s alright. It’ll be okay.” Draco hushed the other, giving the other a kiss on the cheek and then his forehead. “It’s only me, only Draco. I love you. So stop hurting yourself now.”
But Harry remembered that it was only Draco and Teddy and they both loved him and would never judge him for anything.
Harry quickly shook his head as all earlier thoughts went to the back of his mind as he watched in anticipation when the shower curtains pulled open.
“Ahhhhhh….mmmm…” Draco sighed, lightly rubbing his flattened belly with one hand as he slowly got his bearings back.
“I’ll need to kip out for a bit to pick up some potion ingredients.” Draco told him, taking a sip of his coffee.
Draco snorted, but leaned over to give him a small kiss on the cheek, obviously forgiving his daft lover.
Draco glared angrily for a few more seconds before giving a huff, finally calming down. “They should hope their paths never cross ours. Because I swear, if I ever see them I’ll-“ Harry cut off his threat with a kiss.
Draco was still upset about not getting any of the exotic plants, but he brightened up when he bought the zoo’s gin and chocolate as his souvenir.
No, what was on Harry’s mind was the scene of Draco soiling himself right in front of Harry, completely and abashedly.
Harry nodded. “Trust me- I don’t think I look at anyone even one-fourth as much as I look at you.” Draco grinned, an expression full of pride on his face.
Sighing, Harry looked at his godson. “When you’re done, the most important thing is to wipe yourself. Hold on.”
Taking some tissues from the bog roll, Harry looked back at the little boy. “Now, you can wipe yourself however way you like, but just make sure you’re absolutely clean. There should be nothing on your tissue for your last wipe.”
Harry flushed but instead of saying ‘no’ like he immediately wanted to, he instead gritted his teeth and opened his legs slightly to revealed the mess beneath him.
Taking sips of his coffee, Harry felt a familiar pull in his bladder and he felt himself start to sweat a bit.
Draco paused as he looked back and Harry saw the look of confusion clear on his face. “Why? You don’t need to go out of your way to go anywhere. Let me just take care of this first and then we can continue cuddling again.” Draco pouted, clearly wanting to go back to snuggling with his lover once more.
Unfortunately, their bowels wasn’t quite done yet as they both had to pause about halfway to the stream and they practically ripped down their knickers as diarrhea shot out from their arses.
After finishing off the tiramisu and putting away the leftover crackers and chocolate (they devoured all the marshmallows), they moved to cuddle together on the sofa.
Teddy woken up an hour later and the trio went back to the living room together to once again play with the little boy.
When Teddy nodded, he continued. “Make sure you sit down on the seat and make yourself comfortable. Then you can go.” The room was quiet once more as they waited for what would happen next.
Harry blushed when he saw what he had just done. He quickly turned on the shower and felt some relief as the ‘evidence’ washed down the drain.
Draco rolled his eyes, but smirked as let his own burp out in retort, “Urppppp-Oh!” He felt a short fart, pooting out of his bum by accident.
Harry sighed as he took in a whiff of his hazelnut coffee, the caffeine much needed to keep him going all day.
Harry sneered. “For Dudley, I think it took him until he was 6 or 7 to be fully potty trained- he had a tantrum when they first attempted to take his diaper away.”
“Just let it go, baby. It’ll be alright.” Draco assured him. One of his hands cupped over his lover’s bum in reassurance as he lifted his other hand to guide Harry’s head to his shoulder and rubbed the other’s back.
Harry sighed. “Well, back to the topic. I think your way was best- we’ll teach him by example, me the Muggle way and you the Wizarding way?”
Draco just shrugged. "I don't want my clothes to get dirty and this feels like a messy one." He merely explained before he turned his body towards the bush and immediately started to piss.
As Draco slapped away another mosquito from his arm, he let out a groan in frustration. “Harry! I know we agreed to do this with no magic involved, but can we please be allowed to cast a bug repellent spell? I feel like a blood buffet right now.” Draco pleaded.
Draco’s heart melted at that. Never had he thought that the gross quirk he grew up with- where when he burped, sometimes his bum would just follow up with a fart- would actually be something that someone else would find ‘cute’.
Harry continued to watch until the butt bombs that was going off in his lover’s derrière was slowing down, the stream of endless feces ending as his lovers farts became more airer and less moist than before.
“The potential would be there for the spells to go wrong, with quite humiliating results. Also, it’s not hard to imagine the potential for chaos if bullies decided to use this to prey on their unpopular victims, transporting feces into their bed-chamber or school-bags. In the end, Hogwarts decided to forbid the use of spells outside classrooms, which would have also prohibited this.
When her parents came by to pick their daughter up, they were mortified when they learned what their daughter did.
“You are.” Draco now joined in, still holding his stomach as he kept himself from letting anything out. He was hoping to hurry along the explanation as he could feel the gates within his body about to open soon. “And so, Uncle Harry and I are going to show you how to go both ways.
Other than that, when Harry was not with Draco, he found himself either hanging out with their friends and family or doing odd jobs here and there- such as warding homes, babysitting or on very rare occasions, would help out on a few Auror missions if they pleaded with him enough.
But Draco continued to look questioning at him but before he could say anything, Hermione- who was sitting on Harry’s left with a snoring Ron on her other side- sighed as she jumped into the conversation.
“We we’re in the living room then. But I didn’t suppose you wanted to witness anything in our dining room, right after eating.” He pointed out, looking uncomfortable as more gas started to slip out unintentionally.
So... just so you know. I messed up the timeline a bit... In canon the interview is published one week after Valentine's Day. But I kinda skimmed over that chapter in the book and confused the date. So... it's going to be published a bit earlier in here. It just works better like this. (lalala... artistic freedom) And - I stole the title from Hamilton's Your Obedient Servant (You're welcome for the earworm ;)
After raising it up to his mouth and taking a careful sip, he cleared his throat and finally began to speak. "Surely, you are wondering what it is that has brought me here." He didn't give him a chance to reply and instead continued speaking, "There is an urgent matter I need your assistance with."
"And now let's talk about something else," he suggested in a tone that didn't leave much room for arguing.
I raise my paintbrush to the wood again and after a few well placed strokes a caricature of the blond Slytherin smirks at me. His head is extra big (big-head) and his chin even pointier than in real life. I even managed to depict his arrogant sneer and the way his nose is always high up in the air. It's
That was too much. "But she's the one who turned away from us first! She's the one who acts like a completely different person!"
"That's not true!" She replied. "I wanted to tell you. I just…" She looked at her fingers. "I didn't know how."
"I – It's nothing," she said, eyes to the ground. "Just – just a dream I had the other night. A nightmare," she added, with a nervous chuckle.
His words were like a rope that he had thrown down into her hole of unease. Now, she only had to grab it and climb out.
"Okay. We've done your stupid research. It's time for you to answer my questions now." Draco interrupted her.
"Where are your manners? You're scaring away our guest," mum's voice admonishes. But she's nowhere to be – there. The dragon wings. She is still as small as my thumb and cheerfully painting colourful patterns onto the cookies with a toothpick airbrush. Did I imagine it or did she just wink at me? Has everyone gone insane? I march over to where Simon is cutting out the next batch of biscuits.
"When you were out with Malfoy," she explained impatiently. "Did you talk things out? You know, about the dreams?"
"Right. So, how do I…" the boy stares at me questioningly. I guess there is no way around it. With a snap of my fingers I turn into myself again.
"He's not even a human being!" Said one, while the other argued, "I'm not the one who's acting like an arse!"
She chuckled. "It means as long as you take care of your pretty mouth, I'll be stuck to you like… like bubble gum." To demonstrate her point, Haley threw her leg across his lap and wound her arms around him like a koala bear.
"Well, we got an assignment for Charms. But that shouldn't be too hard. And," she paused, crossing her arms. Draco lifted an eyebrow. She rolled her eyes. "And there's that essay for Snape, I haven't quite finished," she admitted, pouting slightly.
"Oh. There's something important I need to check. Almost forgot," Haley answered vaguely. In truth, she was afraid Malfoy would be waiting for her in the Great Hall again. She still didn't know what to make of that dream.
"So… if I don't cause our team to lose the game you won't have a reason to tell anyone about Draco, right?"
"Oh, I don't tell my dad everything either." I say, trying to lighten the mood. "Actually," I bite my lips wondering if I should really tell him this. But it's only fair, isn't it? "You know in first year, when we were sorted into our houses…I almost didn't become a Gryffindor."
It was an afternoon like any other on a day that still carried the faint smell of late summer along with it. The leaves had already started to change their colours and it wouldn't be too long until they'd begin to fall.
That's when Ginny reached across the table and finally snatched the card away from him in order to look at the image. It really was a drawing. A drawing of a man with red hair, sitting in a bed with something that looked like a bandage around his arm. Was this supposed to be Mr Weasley? The expression on the man's face seemed rather glum. But there was something in his hand – a mug? – and after he took a sip from it there suddenly appeared a big smile on his face. And the whole card lit up with colours and glitter. Haley snorted. This was a bit much. But also really sweet. Now she felt bad that she hadn't even thought about getting Luna a present for Christmas. Right. Presents!
"Sorry, about earlier," Haley whispered, staring up at the canopy. "So… are the two of you dating now?"
Haley didn't know what to say. She was deeply touched by the story and the incredibly sweet gesture.
It was a good thing it was already Friday, so maybe she could catch up on some sleep over the weekend. If only to get her friends to stop asking whether she was okay all the time.
Crushed by the Hufflepuffs. It was worse than the game in third year where she'd fallen off her broomstick because of those dementors. She hadn't gotten enough sleep. And during the game, she hadn't been able to focus because her gaze kept wandering toward the Slytherins, looking for a familiar face. But she hadn't found him. He hadn't even come to the game. Did he despise her that much? And then she'd seen Zacharias Smith speeding toward the snitch. Not even with her Firebolt she had been able to catch it first. What a disappointment.
He shook his head. That seemed terribly cynical. What kind of a person was her dad? Well, if he was the chief editor of
Malfoy tsked, shaking his head. "Here I am complimenting you and how do you thank me? With mockery."
"No. I mean I do like listening to it but… I like… how it can reach people. Connect them." Did that make sense? It was really hard to explain.
That muggle sounded truly awful. Did he get mad often? At Haley? He didn't know what to feel. But he did know that he had to do something to cheer her up. He got up from his seat and walked over to her, standing beside her chair.
him. He was hurt. He was sitting in a huge hourglass, sand grains, raining down on him constantly. Tirelessly, he kept hammering on the glass wall, he was confined in. "Haley! Help me!"
Lily was already by her side, flicking her wand and patching up Draco's skin, along with the glass object that had been smashed to pieces. It was her dad's terrarium. The special one with little goal hoops, in which he kept all the snitches he had ever caught in his life. Now, they were all zooming about the room, adding to the overall chaos. It was a good thing her dad wasn't present.
When she pulled away after what could have been hours, he instantly missed her lips. He opened his eyes slowly, fearing this had been only a dream and he was about to wake up alone in his bed. But she was still there. Softly, smiling at him as if… he was someone special to her. Then he noticed something shiny in front of him.
confused. Draco didn't know. He only had Crabbe and Goyle as a reference point. And those two? Well, he didn't remember the last time he saw them
It wouldn't budge. His head was stuck inside the blasted thing. A manic laugh left his throat. Then another. Then another. Then it was completely quiet again. He really hated Haley Potter. Why did she always have to turn his life into a complicated mess?
"Of course we came back to look for you after Charms but you seemed so tired this morning that I thought it was best to let you sleep some more."
Haley sighed. "Come on, just tell me," she urged softly, looking up at him, her lips slightly pouting. She didn't know what changed – maybe it was the tone of her voice – but Malfoy turned to her, his eyes wide and lips slightly parted. His eyes wandered across her face like he was seeing her only now. She had missed him, she realised. Missed him looking at her like that. Like she was special. Like he never wanted to stop looking at her. The thought made her blush. But even so, she didn't look away. Not even when he closed his eyes and sighed. How odd. The sigh almost sounded like he was surrendering.
"Which brings us back to Occlumency," Snape concluded. Right. Occlumency was the art of protecting one's mind, if she remembered correctly. The potion master took his wand out of the inner pocket of his robes and held it to his forehead. He pulled a silver thread from his temple and let it sink into the Pensieve on the table between them. After repeating the action twice, he picked up the Pensieve and placed it on top of a shelf behind him.
… What did that even mean? How could she be hopeful when it had been her who had taken away all his hopes and dreams? He sighed. There was no way he would be able to bear being in her presence any longer. Not without giving in. Or letting her explain her way back into his heart.
Haley sat up abruptly. Malfoy grumbled softly in his sleep but she couldn't be bothered to worry about him as well. This was bad! They had to get back to the castle quickly.
"No, what'd he call you?" I'm already getting angry even though Simon hasn't told me the insult yet.
"Why else would I have kissed you?" She gave his shoulder a shove. "Why else would I have enjoyed it?"
All at once her sense for adventure kicked in. She would certainly not try that out now but… she filed away the information for later. She turned toward Malfoy, unsure what was supposed to happen now. His eyes were already trained on her. Had he been watching her the whole time? The moment seemed fragile. Intimate.
She sniffed, feeling the tears start to pool in her eyes. Merlin, she hated crying. Her friend made a gesture as if he wanted to touch her arm but stopped himself in the last second. He gazed away, a trace of something akin to sympathy or perhaps regret in his features.
Sirius sighed, running his hands across his face. "Merlin, this is hard," he mumbled, before letting his arms sink and interlacing his fingers in his lap. "I've been thinking hard about what you told me the other day and… well, let's get to the point, shall we?" He proposed, the hint of a smile ghosting around his bearded mouth. "I hate the thought of you going around with that Malfoy boy and doing who knows what with him. And let me assure you, James would have shared that opinion."
"Where is he?" She asked urgently. "What happened to him? I need to see him!" She reached for Draco's arm, clutching it to anchor herself somewhere.
Without making a noise, I land on the foot of Malfoy's bed next to his legs. His mumbling is still too quiet to understand. I uncomfortably feel like a mouse trying to steal past a sleeping cat. He looks like a
? I haven't heard anything this funny in ages." The boy replied with a laugh but Haley could swear that there was a flush of pink rising up his throat.
"Here," he said, holding the quill out to her. She took it out of his hand but before she could turn to leave, Draco grabbed her wrist, effectively stopping her.
Haley got up and tried to catch her breath. The sweetness of the memories was almost too much to bear.
Draco hadn't known that he could want this girl even more. He was almost drowning in the all-encompassing affection he felt for her. What did anything matter if he had her? He didn't need anything else if he could just hold on to this one girl forever.
He chuckled. If only things could stay like this forever. He'd never have to worry about a thing again.
Draco held her even tighter then, pressing himself against her back, as if he was trying to pull her inside of him. Was this his way of expressing how happy he was? First going mad and then becoming clingy and affectionate?
" she pleaded in her most pitiful voice. She even resorted to pouting which was really stretching it far. James made the mistake of looking at her, so he was hit with her pouting face full force. He was trying hard to resist but Haley could see that he was losing the fight. She tried to look even more innocent and small. 3… 2… 1…
She grins at me cheekily. "I told you, if you want to know the secret, you need to find it out yourself," is all that she says.
"Just answer the question, Haley!" He interrupted, his grip on her fingers becoming uncomfortably tight. "If it had been me, would you have betrayed me, too?"
"Wait, that was you?" I remember how embarrassing the conversation with the Charms Professor had been.
She had reached the lake now. All that was left to do was find the willow Malfoy had mentioned in the note. There were still lots of leaves on the trees although they had mostly turned brown now. A few metres to her right Haley spotted a person leaning against a willow tree. It was a boy with suspiciously white blond hair, who was tapping his foot to the ground impatiently. Was she that late? Instead of walking faster she slowed her steps in an attempt to make as little noise as possible. This reminded her oddly of that one time in third year when she had snuck into Hogsmeade and thrown mud balls at Malfoy and his unsuspecting friends. Wouldn't it be fun to re-enact that particular memory? Scooping up a handful of fallen leaves she slowly walked closer until she was almost directly in front of him. If she took one more step she would be able to touch him. Just one more step and then –
The Slytherin frowned. "But what if I get something I don't like?" He asked, sounding honestly confused. That boy really was ridiculous.
It was like Malfoy was telling her something through the kiss. No words. More like little impressions of what he was feeling. It was impossible to discern what each of those impressions meant. But overall there was one feeling that stood out among the others. Something
She shook her head. "I was thinking a lot… in the beginning. Fighting all of this for a long time… I doubted him… doubted everything… even my
The girl scoffed, "Is this the part where you tell me that life is hard but we have to get through anyway?"
"It's not like we actually dated or anything," she said off-handedly, "Still, what he said about me at the ball… don't you think you believed him a bit too readily? He was talking behind my back and you just stood there and nodded? I mean, I know that he's really cute and everything but do the last four years mean nothing to you?" At first Haley had only meant to tease her a bit but there was definitely some truth to her words.
“Hello darlings, what can I get you?” Asks a warm voice suddenly. I know that voice. I turn my head so fast, I almost fall off my chair.
"So? Snape is a Slytherin as well and it wasn't him who tormented others just because they existed!"
Haley pulled at a loose thread on the coat she was kneeling on. "I really like…" she started to say, looking up at the boy who was staring at her expectantly. She grinned. "When you're wearing your hair like this." She nodded at his blond locks that were framing his face softly. Devoid of any gel.
Haley inhaled deeply. "Okay. Okay, let's… just forget about all of this, alright?" She didn't want him to get disappointed again. She still remembered how devastated he had been the previous night. He had already suffered so much pain.
"I totally forgot about this. I was sure I had finished it along with all the other essays on Sunday," Haley replied around a piece of toast, furiously writing the conclusion to her Herbology essay.
"Oh. Right. So, we are." Ron said in a dejected tone. Were his ears turning red? Then Haley realized something. Tomorrow was Valentine's Day. Actually, it coincided with the Hogsmeade visit. Was her friend trying to ask Hermione out? She grinned to herself.
thought of that? Then she mentally slapped herself. Of course… he hadn't been able to. Maybe he'd even thought about it… only to realize he wasn't capable of casting the spell.
Haley followed her gaze and noticed a piece of parchment by the door that seemed strangely familiar.
"I'm sure, he'll be back for breakfast tomorrow." Hermione argued, pushing her friend toward her four-poster. "You can start worrying if he stops coming to class."
She didn't even remember getting to the owlery. People and places were only strange shapes and colours that didn't matter to her. The only thing that was important was that her godfather would finally stop sending the boy she liked these atrocious letters!
"A hot drink for a hot lad," the blond drawls, pulling off the cork and adding no more than a teaspoon of Firewhiskey to his cocoa. I chuckle at his careful administrations. This is the best thing since chocolate frogs.
Haley shivered. Her friend could be really scary if she wanted to be. If she remembered correctly they had found the spell in a book called "Revenge and Other Sweet Pleasures".
So that was the story behind the tree house. Haley's heart ached for him. He must have felt so sad and lonely.
When Haley opened her eyes – she had closed them due to the bright light – the lake and the castle grounds were gone. Instead she found herself in a small meadow surrounded by tall trees. The sun was painting the colourful leaves around them in golden colours and with a start she realised that this was the place in Hogsmeade where they had spent the afternoon only a few days before.
, she wanted to ask but he was right. It would be best to keep whatever they were going to talk about as short as possible.
"Watch out!" Someone shouted near her. Haley turned around, to find Neville crash into her forcefully. With her right hand she managed to hold onto a nearby table, preventing them from falling over.
"It's not poisoned, I swear," she assured him, storing away the sound of his voice for later. There were more important things at hand.
Looking back, this maybe hadn't been the most clever way of putting it. But this: provoking each other; teasing and taunting, where it was most uncomfortable, this was what they did. And a big part of Draco enjoyed this more than anything in the world. More than being mean to first years. More than calling the know-it-all a mudblood. More than insulting the weasel and seeing just how red his face could possibly turn.
Draco was silent as he listened to Harry’s explanation. After a minute, he finally spoke, “If the fact that I go the traditional way bothers you Harry, you need to let me know now. Because Hogwarts is the other place where I use the muggle loos. Everywhere else, especially at home, I WILL do what makes me the most comfortable. And since we plan on moving in together after Hogwarts well…” Draco trailed off, looking away. “…maybe this issue may make you change your mind…”
Draco nodded. “Leave Teddy to us, Aunt. We won’t promise that he’ll be completely potty trained by the time you return, but at least he’ll have the idea in his mind.”
Teddy’s high-pitched giggle could be heard but Harry did not look up as he felt something more than air about to come out.
Not bothering to hold it, Draco quickly pushed out his own load into his pants, and when he finished, he returned his focus on his upset lover.
“This spell is short lived and once you release your gas, it will smell again-nnh! I personally like to leave this spell for last since I do not fancy having to constantly cast it after every bout of gas.” Draco explained, Teddy nodding.
They sat on the chairs, pushed side by side close to each other, watching the fire as they enjoyed a dessert of what Harry called ‘camping tiramisu’ and of course, s’mores.
It took a few more minutes, but eventually Harry felt like he was done. Draco had blinked his eyes open when he heard the sounds of gurgles and farts had ended.
Harry gave him a soft look as he leaned forward to give the other a kiss on the nose. “Like I said, it’s not disgusting, it’s cute. That look of surprise you get when it happens is something I want to capture on camera.”
Where they went was to the souvenir shop, where Harry bought Teddy a bedtime cuddle set that consisted of a children’s book, a bath bomb and a stuffed monkey- one that looked exactly like the baby chimpanzee from earlier.
“Places like Hogwarts believes proper plumbing was better than a simple disappearing spell. There actually is no such thing as a "disappearing" spell. Even in the Wizarding World, matter cannot be created or destroyed, meaning the witches and wizards were presumably transporting their waste elsewhere - maybe to a waste pit.
Draco just looked at him confused as Harry shrugged sheepishly. “Just stay and…go here. We can talk about our plans with Teddy this weekend.” He offered.
With an audible grunt, Harry watched as a deep fart rumbled out of Draco’s bottom before slowly transforming into a crackling sound instead.
Harry turned to grin weakly at his boyfriend. "Mine’s probably sound the same as yours, love. At least the cramps is feeling much better now." He ended his sentence with another booming fart accompanied with more chunky poop.
"Maybe? But I ate so much of everything that it could have been anything that caused this." Draco admitted, bending lower to let out more diarrhea, the brown sludge pouring out of him.
Just as Harry wrapped his arms around the blonde’s waist and hugged the other tighter to him, Draco suddenly gave the other a light push, sleepily shaking his head as he started to move away.
They were lying on the room’s conjured sofa- they decided to go to the bed later since they both wanted to sit up for a while, feeling stuffed with all the ice cream they had eaten earlier at Floreans.
"What?" Haley asked, feeling like she had barely understood half of the things her mum had told her. But Lily had already got up from her bed and was standing at the door.
"I figured." He sighs but the smile is still there on his lips, if only a little wistful now. "Still a pretty brilliant dream." He winks.
He narrowed his eyes at her for a second. "Fine." He let her up then. After all, he didn't want her to pass out because she didn't get enough air.
Haley gave it a try. She tried to imagine what it would be like to go on a date with Justin Finch-Fletchley. She came up blank. She didn't know him well enough. In her mind she saw herself smiling awkwardly and frantically thinking up things to talk about.
doing here?" Asked the younger girl accusingly. Of course it was that Emily kid. "You need to hurry! The game starts in fifteen minutes!"
After the first two sentences he stopped listening. Strange, he didn't even feel like punishing her.
"We will continue with your lesson on Wednesday," Snape said tonelessly. "Go back to your dormitory now. And be assured I will notice if you do not practice."
"So… is it okay if I tell them?" She asked. "That you're my–" she hesitated. "my boyfriend?" The word
"I haven't even told father," he admits quietly. It seems like a secret in itself. Like something private. That I shouldn't have heard.
Another heavy silence followed and Haley already regretted having said anything at all. She noticed Ron sending Hermione a pointed look that Hermione answered with a similar one. She seemed both frustrated and helpless.
As always leave me your thoughts if you feel like it and check out my new fic "Walking on Dreams" if you want to.
The little girl who was still struggling against Draco who was holding her up by her collar, sent her a glare. "It's
"It's a tuning fork," Hermione informed them, she had walked over from her bed and sunk to her knees on the carpet in front of Haley's bed. There was an amused grin on her face.
"I wouldn't ask you…" She said softly, raising her hand to his cheek. "To fight against your own father."
"Mm. I like it," he says, grinning triumphantly. There's a mad glint in his eyes that makes me slightly uncomfortable. What is he planning?
We sit down to eat our ice cream at one of the tables in front of the parlour. The sun is shining and it feels like late spring or early summer. I hear birds chirping and while I lick my ice cream I notice the boy, sitting opposite me, stare at me, an annoyingly smug grin on his face. It gives me the feeling that we're playing some kind of game that I don't know the rules of and he's the one winning.
But that was why he couldn’t figure out why he was still so hung up on the fact of how other wizards, specifically Draco, did their elimination so differently to the Muggle way.
“But even once Muggle plumbing was finally adopted into then Wizarding World, there are still some of those- mainly those who grew up in the Wizarding world- who still choose to relieve themselves in the traditional way.” Hermione finished.
Draco watched a slumbering Harry with hooded eyes, a tired smile on his own lips as he ran his hands through the other’s hair, listening to the quiets snores that filled the room.
Harry whimpered as he felt his stomach cramp even more. Then his eyes widened as he felt his anus suddenly open and felt the tip of something hard turtlehead out between his cheeks.
Harry must have fallen asleep again because he found himself blinking awake once more, but this time he saw lovely grey eyes blearily look back at him.
He watched as Draco shuffled slightly away from him and the couch, just about maybe 2-3 feet away and shifted his body so Harry saw him from the side, couldn’t really see the blonde’s face but had a good view of his behind.
Draco grimaced but nodded his head. “We’ll clean as much as we can and just keep the stasis charm on the toilet until he comes.”
The older lady gave them all a hug goodbye and held onto her grandson a bit more longer as she hugged him last. “You be good while I’m gone, okay Teddy?” She said as she kissed his forehead.
The following day, the two boys trekked through the woods towards their campsite. One of the compromises they made was that they would be doing this entirely the Muggle way (with just a bit a magic allowed).
They quickly removed the boy’s diaper and gave the boy a quick cleaning spell- he would be taking a bath anyway, so he would be properly cleaned there.
Draco was still sitting on the tub, watching Harry’s lesson with interest, and gave him an encouraging smile when their eyes met. That smile gave Harry more confidence to proceed on.
"Yes. For now, at least." Draco answered as he bent down, giving a clear view of his diarrhea-covered legs and bottom, and ruffled through his pants pocket.
After a moment of two, after their giggling fit ended, Draco let out another groan as a sloppy, squelching fart left him once more.
After a moment, a roll of tissue flew into view and straight into his hand. Grinning, he turned to his lover and gave a wink.
As consciousness stared to evade his mind, other things also began entering his thoughts as well- including the memory of yesterday’s little happening.
“-You’ll do nothing because then you’ll end up in Azkaban and I really don’t want my efforts in keeping you out of there go to waste.” Harry told him gently. Draco harrumphed but knew the other was right.
After they had a good shag on that exceptionally soft rug, the two headed back to the campsite for a small lunch (the champagne and sweets had filled them up quite a bit).
At that, Draco stopped laughing and bit his lip. Everything in his pureblood upbringing repelled at doing something so vulgar, so impolite, so repulsive…but Draco felt like those reasons made him want to do it even more. To show Harry his true self and not hold anything back. For them to be truly comfortable and have total trust between them.
Later that night, they both slipped into Draco’s bed that night. For the 8th years, they were split into genders and it was four people per room; in order to promote interhouse unity, it was usually one person from each house per room.
It had been challenging enough that one time when he had pooped on the toilet in front of both his lover and godson when they were potty training the little tyke.
Draco gave Harry a panicked look and Harry quickly reached for Teddy to pull the little boy away, who thankfully just missed getting wet from the growing puddle.
They would also make sure to cast a vow (that’s safe for children) so Teddy wouldn’t let slip of the minor details of their potty teachings to anyone.
“Wait, what?” Harry did a double take when he saw that the blonde didn’t automatically laugh and agree with him about what he had ‘misheard’.
“And don’t worry if you are not able to do it the first few times- for most wizards, it takes them until they’re at least five before they can get the hang of it.” Draco assured the boy.
If anyone wants to write me a fic or a short story, I would love to read two scenarios, 1) Draco accidentally farting in front of Harry and/or 2) Harry and Draco having a fart contest. If anyone writes this for me (you can send it to my ask box in my tumblr and you can stay anonymous)- in exchange, I’ll write you a Drarry drabble or post one of my drabbles that I have saved up from other fandoms that I have done. And if you add pooping to your story, I’ll make sure your fic is EXACTLY what you want. (But no more face-farting for the time being please- I don’t think I can write another one so soon 😆)
Draco gasped. A little to the right, a few feet away from their campsite, they stood right at the edge of a cliff. In front laid a majestic view of the mountains and forest trees landscaped before them. A lake that sparkled changing colors of blue to sea green at the middle of it all. And amidst everything was all the forest animals as they continued to move around in their natural habitat.
Harry kept himself from letting any noises out as he felt the blond wipe him down gently but with a firm hand. When Draco put a little too much pressure on his hole, he couldn’t stop the small puff of gas from coming out.
Andromeda chuckled as she nodded, her early anxiety about leaving her grandson and going on a leisure trip for herself after how many decades…it all started to fade away as she knew that everything would be alright. She trusted Harry and Draco.
Harry reached over as he rubbed his boyfriend's stomach. "Don't strain too much, Draco. Try to relax your stomach and take deep breaths before giving another push." He instructed to the other.
Harry blushed but Draco forced him to keep eye contact, refusing to let the other avoid this. “Harry.” He said warningly.
Draco’s blush darkened at the ‘compliment’. “It’s just something that comes out on its own- it’s like a disgusting quirk of mine.”
Harry looked up in surprise as he saw his lover turn around and lower his pants even more. Before he knew it, a fart came out, followed by what he could see was a log slowly coming out of the other’s hole.
Draco wore only a pair of light gray boxer-briefs that he just barely put on after their nightly activities (the blonde hated sleeping in the nude, even after sex).
Draco gave him a soft look as he leaned forward to capture the other’s lips in a soft peck. “Shall we have lunch first?”
As Teddy took his nap, Harry had started on dinner while Draco finished some of the potion orders that came in that morning (Draco was currently working towards being a Potion master and actually would supply Hogwarts with some of his own made potions whenever Madam Pomfrey and Professor Slughorn requested from him).
When they woke up again the sun was just beginning to set. They went back to where the rug laid, and cuddled there as they enjoyed the sunset together.
Leaving a soft kiss on the other’s shoulder, Harry got out of bed and put on some clothes before leaving the tent.
Draco squatted down so he was close to Teddy, about a foot away, and the new position caused a loud fart to boom out of him.
That night, both slumbering boys laid in each other’s arms, bodies intertwined, and loving smiles on both of their faces.
Nodding to himself, Harry looked at his godson. “Teddy? If you’re ready, Uncle Harry will teach you how to go the Muggle way. It’s a bit easier than the Wizarding way and you’ll need to know this method once you go to Hogwarts or anywhere in the Muggle world.”
Even though Harry had grew up in a world that looked down on such a disgraceful act of soiling oneself, for him to think that nothing was wrong and to even be…intrigued by it…well, that was abnormal wasn’t it?
They played with Teddy, everyone having fun as Harry and Draco would chase the little boy around the house and charmed his toys to fly and have little battles together.
“No, we do not play with the toilet- it’ll end up breaking and then we won’t have a loo.” Harry told him sternly.
Harry thought about it for a moment, before slowly nodding. “Yeah, I am. I trust you and am the most comfortable around you with everything.”
When his steam died down, the blond could feel something trying to poke out of his bum. Biting his lip, Draco decided to just bugger it and just…go.
Harry looked at her in disbelief. “But we have loos in Hogwarts and I’ve seen it in other places too- like Hogsmeade and the Ministry.” He pointed out.
Draco shuffled inside the bag before pulling out a potion bottle. “We’re gonna have to make an exception for magic again. Here, this should help settle our stomachs.”  Drinking half the bottle, he handed it to Harry who finished off the rest.
“Lunch?” Harry wandlessly casted a tempus spell and blinked when he saw that it was almost 12 in the afternoon. As if realizing the lack of food, Harry’s stomach gave an audible growl right then. “Well, I supposed we should then.” He said sheepishly.
The last time Draco felt like this was also on that fateful and unforgettable day, during their eighth year in Hogwarts.
He felt Draco rub his back, trying to comfort him. Harry gave him a grateful look before he winced when a particularly violent fart left him.
They went back to their campsite and Draco helped Harry with their meal (and by helping, he placed the ready-prepared ingredients in the pots). When everything was left cooking, the two decided to kip on the sofa for a short nap.
“I’ll show you stink.” Draco grumbled, pushing his bottom down more so his lover could feel the unmistaking rolling vibrating erupting from him.
Harry’s jaw was dropped during her explanation. He shook his head, trying to absorb all this new information. “Wait, so wizards or witches will still choose to go in their knickers on purpose?”
Draco sighed, knowing what his significant other was dying to ask. He knew the other had been strangely quiet and distracted after their class. “Be glad I love you and am willing to humor you. But, yes. I usually do my business the traditional wizarding way.”
Not long after, Draco suddenly gasped as his grabbed his stomach and a series of juicy, wet-slick farts was pushed out.
Harry suddenly jumped when he felt a hand take his and looked up to see that Draco had moved closer to him. His blond boyfriend gave him an encouraging smile as he gave his hand a comforting squeeze.
Draco’s fart ended up coming with a surprise- as not only did gas came out, but a thick stream of diarrhea sprayed out as well.
“How is it, love?” Harry turned and saw his boyfriend standing at the doorway, a crying  Victoire, in the blond’s arms.
Draco nodded as he followed his boyfriend's advice and slowly, the log slid its way out, landing with a thud on the bush. From what Harry could see, the log was about a half an inch thick but about 7 inches long.
Draco was grinning as he listened to the story and opened his mouth to let out a laugh, but instead he ending up letting out a loud burp instead.
Both boys wore nothing but their knickers and dress robes- although Harry realized that Draco had removed his robe before doing his business.
Draco chuckled before letting out another moan himself as his own arse peed out another stream of diarrhea.
Harry hummed as he swallowed the bite of toast in his mouth. “I’ll come too- we also need to pick up some more ice cream at Florean’s since we’ve run out.”
As the peeing finally tampered off, he listened to Draco give a small sigh before he began to shift his legs more apart as he squatted down a bit so his moistened butt stuck out.
Sighing, Harry got up from his seat and sat on his lover’s lap, rubbing the other’s arms to calm the still irate blond down. “Draco, you know that I’m already over whatever the Dursley’s put me through. I’m fine and I’ll never see them again.”
Now, Victoire didn’t know if she’ll ever get any more desserts or even be allowed back into their home after what she did.
Harry made a sympathetic noise as he rubbed his boyfriend's back for comfort. The stench of their afterdinner permeated the air, but it wasn’t too bad since they were out in the open, with the winds blowing away the smells being made. "Was it the bean soup, maybe?” Harry wondered. He had second guessed himself while making it, but beans was a staple when one went camping.
They had a good laugh when Harry had accidentally farted and the water had been so clear that they could see the bubbles rising from his bum up to the surface, popping once they got there.
Giving him a caring look, Harry sighed as he nodded. “Alright- I suppose that request is reasonable. Grab my wand?” Draco cheered as he reached into the small knapsack that he wore (they each wore one pack each) and searched for the other’s wand.
Harry grunted as a loud squeaky fart left him, a stream of liquid feces following after. “Ah, no- I had only planned to take a piss when I came out here and didn’t think I’d need it. Hold on…”
“Marmalade. And its in the bottom left drawer- I had to do a few rearranging when your Mother sent us those antique dishes.” Harry pointed out.
With a practiced motion of his hand, Draco was once again dry, all proof of the fluid he expelled suddenly vanished.
Suddenly the sound of hissing filled the air and Harry watched as the gray boxer-briefs quickly darkened, streams on piss flowing down the other’s legs.
Draco chuckled as he removed the hands from his mouth, but continued holding them in his own. “More like a voyeurism fetish.”
Unlike someone like Draco who grew up with this type of behavior, it was normal for him because there was never a time or a reason to ever think it wouldn’t be. Because he never grew up with these prejudices, he couldn’t be considered strange for not following what muggles considered the norm.
Shushing the other, Draco continued to soothe his lover as they both found themselves standing in a puddle of piss.
Sniffling loudly, Harry reached up to wipe his face but Draco beat him to it, wiping away his tears with the blond’s clean hand.
“Only you am I comfortable enough to show this side of myself to you. You are the only one who was seen me, felt me, and even smelled me like this. No one else. And I don’t want anyone else. I love you Harry Potter so please stop thinking yourself as dirty. You are beautiful and you are mine.” Draco gave him the most loving smile Harry had ever seen.
He was still poo-shy, but at least around Draco he was able to confidently let himself go in front of his lover.
Draco grinned as another violent fart left him, but he could only feel it, not hear it. It did also leave a stench that made all three occupant’s noses scrunch up.
As he dropped the tissue into the toilet, he opened his mouth to say something but shut it again when he felt Draco giving his hand a squeeze.
He was sure his words were only half comprehensible, as he spoke the words through his crying, but he knew that the blond understood him.
Teddy looked at the blond, tilting his head to one side as he had a thoughtful look on his face. Suddenly his eyes widened as he said, “Excuse me!” The little boy smiled widely as Draco nodded at him and patted his head.
Draco walked out their floo, having just picked up some takeout for their dinner to see his lover with both arms wrapped around his middle as he was bent over in obvious pain.
On Teddy’s last night with them, the little boy had actually managed to use his potty. His pee may have missed the bowl a bit and he still pooped his diaper, but it was progress.
He opened his eyes once more and looked down, his concentration focused as he expelled more waste into the toilet.
Draco sighed as he realized that he didn’t have anything to wipe with. “Harry? Did you by chance bring a roll with you? I don’t have anything to wipe with.”
The couple waved the little family goodbye, reassuring the parents that their daughter will always be welcomed into their home.
Harry shook his head, giving out another laugh. “No aplogizes, love. When nature calls, gotta answer it.”
“Ooh-ohhhhh…” Draco moaned as he could feel his fart explode out of him before taking its time to come out in a gurgling-bubbly fashion, sounding so wet that Draco wondered if it would leave a stain in his knickers.
He couldn’t tell if he was in the wrong for staying while his love was about to do…that. But by the look of Draco’s face, he then wondered if maybe he was wrong for thinking that this was…not normal while the blonde obviously found no issues with their current situation.
Draco was not an animal person, but what he did enjoy was observing all the exotic plants when they visited the Botanical garden portion. Now it was Harry’s turn to convince the blond that he could not nick any of the Nepenthes plants to make potions out of.
It was hard to believe that only a few weeks ago, Harry had been poo-shy, so much so that he had been reduced to tears during that fateful ‘accident’.
The trio had lunch at one of the places in the zoo, where they all enjoyed some fish and chips with mushy peas and ate ice cream cones as they continued around the zoo.
“She’s at ze age vere children is zo curious.” Fluer sighed, looking at her slumbering daughter. Looking at the other two men, she also had an apologetic look. “Ve vill talk to her.”
Another spell, Rhinal Anasenthsia, was a similar spell that actually cancels out the entire smell entirely for a very long period of time and by the time the spell ran out, the smell would have long dissipated. But it was dangerous because done wrongly could result in permanently losing one’s sense of smell forever.
Seeing the emotions in his lover’s eyes, Harry was instantly brought back to the present and the fog that filled his mind cleared instantly. He hated it when Draco looked like that.
As the toilet quieted again, Harry sighed- he really did not want anyone to see the ‘aftermath’ of his meals for any longer than necessary.
This incident would prove that they could be completely open and trusting towards each other about anything (they already were, but this would just be MORE).
Draco was the one to help lift Teddy up so the little boy could flush the toilet himself. Again, Harry notice Draco give a slight jolt at the sound but Teddy was fascinated as he saw the tissues swirl down until they disappeared.
Harry gently ran the tissue over his lover's bum, taking loving care when he wiped off the lingering poop from his lover's dirtied arsehole.
His smile widened as Draco giggled and Harry noticed bubbles coming out of the blond’s bum, scaring some of the fish away while the rest curiously swam near the bubbles.
“Harry?” He called out. Harry, who was currently helping Teddy build a large castle out of blocks, paused to look up questioningly at his lover.
Just as he was about to rest against his lover’s side, Draco brought his fist to his mouth and let out a large belch, which was quickly followed by a loud wet fart as he lifted his bum to the side as he let it out.
His best friend frowned at him. “Yes. Harry, there’s nothing wrong with it- yes, it may seem strange to us who lived among Muggles in our younger years and have adapted to certain Muggle customs, but here in the Wizarding World? It’s considered the norm here.”
Harry nodded as he bit his lip worriedly. Draco caught it and asked what was wrong, but Harry shook his head to wave off the other’s concern.
When Harry checked again, his diaper was still full. “It’s okay Teddy bear- it just takes some practice but you’re doing very well.” He assured his godson.
Harry had been telling Draco a funny story about something that happened in the Gryffindor dorms when it happened.
Draco chuckled, his face red as he began to strain. “So-mmh… the first thing you should do is that when you feel like you need to go, it’s best to go to-ahh… somewhere private with no one around. If you are not able to, make sure you are wearing your wizard robes so they can hide anything you let out….mmhm!”
Harry watched as Draco sluggishly stood up, holding onto the side table to push himself to a standing position.
Draco slapped his hand over his mouth, the other one going behind to cover his bum, face pink in complete mortification.
Crinkling his nose at the smell that still lingered around him, Draco wordlessly (but still needed his wand) casted Olefacio minuere. He liked to to cast that spell last since it was an annoyance to cast it repeatedly while he was trying to focus on clearing his bladder and bowels.
Draco looked up, face red as he was in the middle of pushing a hard log out right then. “What was that, Harry?” He asked, though his attention was mostly on his current task. He widened this legs, making room for the stool to land in between.
Harry quickly hugged the other close to him, feeling horrible for upsetting the other. “No! Draco, of course I still want to live with you!” He kissed the blonde forehead, trying to banish any doubts away. “Nothing you do would ever make me not want to spend the rest of my life with you!”
As soon as he was naked and inside the tub, Harry had let go, moaning in relief as his piss came out in a hard stream, a puddle of yellow piss forming in the tub.
“That’s right. So next time, you know what not to do so this doesn’t happen again, okay?” Draco added, rubbing soothing circles on her back.
It got to the point where even Gryffindors and Slytherins had finally made a truce and even got along now (the friendship that evolved between Hermione and Pansy though was something that Harry did regret a bit though- those two were scary when they were plotting something, like setting up their best friends together).
Draco actually blushed at this, but before he could say anything, his grey eyes widened as piss started to quickly come out involuntarily.
But yesterday was when the cramps started. They would come and go, but today they were worse than usual.
Harry also recalled that Draco never used spells to hide the sounds he made or tried to hide the sight of what was going on. The only spells he casted was when he rid of all the evidence once everything was already done.
Draco didn’t care that his hand was getting dirty as he only focused on comforting his now crying lover, hearing his sniffles and whimpers as he continued to unload five days worth of digested food into his knickers.
Interestingly enough, against Harry’s initial assumptions about his proper, pompous significant other, he learned early in their relationship that Draco was perfectly fine ‘breaking a bit of wind’ in his company.
Curtains closed, Silencio spell up and cuddling into his boyfriend, Harry finally asked, “So…about our conversation earlier during History…” he trailed off.
Harry loved watching the amazement on his two favorite boy’s faces as they looked around their surroundings.
Unsure of exactly what happened, but what the men could understand through Victoire’s crying was that when they were busy washing the dishes after dinner, the little girl thought it would be a fun idea to see how many things could be flushed down their toilet.
Draco blushed but nodded as he made his way to his boyfriend. Harry motioned for him to turn around and Draco followed, bending over slightly so Harry could wipe him down.
But before he could put his clothes near Draco’s under the tree, Harry was hit by an uncontrollable cramp that made him bend over and release his own diarrhea all over the bush with a booming wet fart.
On the other hand, Harry was staring in between his lover’s legs, a big bulge starting to tent in his pants as poop started to come out.
As Harry continued to unload, sounds of gas being mixed in as he defecated, Draco felt a familiar drop in his own belly.
“You boys are right. I guess this old lady is just worrying over nothing again.” She gave her grandson a fond look before looking back at the other two.
Draco, who was also not paying attention but working on an essay for Charms, looked questioningly at his lover who sat right next to him. “What’s wrong, Harry?”
Leaning down, Draco gave him a hug. “You are a wizard now and no longer living in the past. I know more than anyone about letting past prejudices go. Harry- wizard or not, you are most certainly not a freak.” Draco leaned back, arms still wrapped around him. “You’re amazing.” He said simply.
The blond pretty much went when he wanted to and wherever he wanted to as long as it was in their house and as long as they had no guest.
Harry finally looked away, green eyes meeting grey for the first time. “I don’t find this disgusting. I think all of this is just as normal as breathing, not shameful like I grew up being taught. But me thinking this just means that I’m…not normal. I’m a freak. Just like they’ve always said.” He admitted.
After their trip to the zoo, they had chosen a cute child’s potty- one that had the characters of Teddy’s favorite show on it- and bought it before going home. They had gotten two so that Andromeda could have one at her house as well.
Andromeda, Teddy’s grandmother, had actually asked them a few weeks ago if they could watch the toddler while she took a ladies trip with her sister and Draco’s mother, Narcissa, to France. While the boys had wholeheartedly agreed, unfortunately the trip had been rescheduled due to horrible weather and Teddy being sick for one weekend.
After another round of sex on the river rocks, the couple made their way back to their campsite where Draco decided to relax with his book while Harry prepared dinner, music from their radio playing quietly around them.
“I love you, Draco.” Harry crooned as he wrapped an arm around the other, showering the other’s face with many kisses.
The three of them were sitting at the dining room, eating the last of the bangers and mash that Harry had cooked for their dinner.
Finally when Draco gave one more push and the only thing that came out was a small poot, it was done.
The two men exchanged a look before Harry walked out with Victoire while Draco casted a stasis spell on the room before joining the the other two.
When Teddy nodded, the entire room was quiet for a while until the sound of piss finally trickled off. “When you’re done, give your peepee a shake, you can dab it with some tissue to make sure it’s all dry before you can put your clothes back on.” Harry did so slowly, letting Teddy watch his actions.
When Draco felt his stomach give a familiar grumble as it dropped down to his bottom, he knew it was time to start Teddy’s training.
Falling into this world was a HUGE culture shock, but a very welcomed one (minus the homicidal maniacs and blood quills though).
“We should start with the potty training when we get home.” Harry nodded as they headed home. Teddy had gone in his diaper a few times during their zoo visit, but one of the perks to being a wizard was that he or Draco only needed to discreetly cast a cleaning charm and it was quickly taken care of.
Harry gave them a hug, followed by Draco who did the same, “It’s completely alright. She’s just barely three years old and she didn’t know any better.” He assured them.
Harry made a comforting noise as he wrapped his arms around the other, putting a warm hand on the other’s bloated belly. “Hey! You were the one who suggested the restaurant in the first place, you git! And well, I did warn you that you probably shouldn’t have eaten all of those samosas. The butter chicken and that large serving of rasmalai you also devoured wouldn’t have helped things neither, love.” He pointed out lightly.
Letting the waters soothe his tired body, Harry floated around, playing with some of the fishes that swam by them (Harry had made sure to vanish all their soap and waste residue in order to keep the waters clean for the fishes).
Casting an Olefacio minuere when their gas was a bit too ripe for them to handle, Harry hugged his lover to his side as they both watched the flames cackle and burn in the fireplace.
Harry again did not know when he fell back to sleep, but this time he woke up to someone playing with his hair.
Draco jumped at the loud sound as he looked to his right to see his lover’s arse vomiting diarrhea all over the bush.
Harry couldn’t look away. Wasn’t even sure if he was supposed to or not but all he could do was watch as the other continued to fart and poop himself. Harry could only remain silent as he watched the small chunks of poop that made its way in the cess pit that was pooling around Draco’s feet.
Draco then took off his pants, knickers and even his socks and shoes and placed them a few feet away from him, under a nearby tree.
He quickly looked up to see that Draco still looked as if he was half-awake, but Harry knew that the other was still conscious enough to be aware that he was intentionally wetting himself at that moment.
Harry always had a large appetite but the past few days, the other had struggled to finish his plate, waving it off with an excuse that he had snacked on something earlier and was full.
His godson was in a laughing fit right now (mostly because the sounds his godfather was making was so funny!) but Harry couldn’t even care as he couldn’t stop the farts from coming out once he freed them.
One thing led to another and somehow Victoire’s favorite dolly accidentally got flushed down the toilet as well.
The abs on the others stomach tightened as a burst of flatulence blasted out, popping through the quiet air around them.
Harry confusedly watched as the other gave another yawn, eyes half-hooded, as the blonde sat up from the bed.
As he read, Draco could feel a slight bubble in his lower bowels. He lifted one of his legs a little and pushed a good healthy fart right out.
“And that lake here is also connected to a stream which runs up to this area- so we can bathe in its refreshing waters later. Oh, and also…” Harry tugged the other’s hand and pointed to an area that he had also set up.
Haley opened the door and pushed Neville through the empty room toward the chimney at the back. The voice had come out of the fire, where Professor Snape's head was sitting and sending them slightly irritated looks.
Oh. Her dad's. Had it escaped from the terrarium? Ah, maybe it had sneaked into her hood when Draco had accidentally broken the terrarium earlier.
Malfoy chuckled softly. She saw his eyes gleam with amusement for a second before he closed them. It was almost too perfect the way a sunbeam fell across his face, tinting his blond hair with warm glints of gold. She realised not for the first time, that she liked looking at him when he couldn't look back. Like now, with his eyes closed and his features soft and relaxed. He didn't seem like Malfoy at all. In that moment he was just a boy. A rather cute one, she had to admit. And his hair looked so soft… Would it seem too forward if she reached out and touched it?
But Victoire knew that Uncle Draco was lovey dovey with Uncle Harry like her parents were with each other, so she gracefully surrendered her first love. But it was okay, because at least Uncle Harry made Uncle Draco happy and always made her her favorite cherry clafoutis whenever she came over.
Draco snorted as he rolled his eyes, taking a bite of his toast. “You’ll buy two pints and one additional pint of earl grey and lavender as well.” Harry grinned as he nodded.
Draco decided to ask later, but for now he needed to get his boyfriend to let it all out to prevent any more damage than he already caused from holding in his poop for so long.
Once Draco got Teddy’s attention again, Draco continued. “Alright. When you are done, the most important spell to do is to make your mess disappear. The difference between babies and big boys is that big boys can clean themselves- they do not wait for other’s to clean for them.”
Draco gave Harry a deep kiss in gratitude, which led to a few minutes of snogging before they decided to continue on to the campsite.
They chatted about their plans for that day, deciding that the strengthening of the wards were their top priority and afterwards they could proceed with the gardens.
This was a very rare spell that of course they had learned from Hermione, and was only done between people who had complete trust between them.
As Teddy was distracted with his dessert of sticky toffee pudding, Harry and Draco discussed how they would go about with Teddy’s potty training.
“How you are able to drink that, I’ll never know.” Harry eyed the drink in Draco’s hands, shaking his head.
“…I wish I knew magic back then.” Harry muttered, watching as Draco’s briefs could no longer contain all the mess inside and began to seep out through the bottom portion, coloring the pale back legs brown.
Draco harrumphed, keeping his face hidden in the other’s neck as he audibly gave a loud grunt, pushing a messy and wetter- sounding fart out of him.
They both stayed there for a long time, enjoying the full moon and the stars that sparkled brighter than they would ever be able to from the city.
Harry had prepared them a feast- with steaks cut up and roasted veggies on the side, potatoes baked in foil slathered with plenty of herb butter and garlic, a pot of black bean soup still bubbling, warm baked bread hot from the fire, and the main dish was a large skillet of paella that sat in the middle of it all.
Harry could feel his eyes tear up again. He hugged the other tight and nodded his head, telling the other that he was only comfortable around him and loved Draco so much.
John had been a distant relative of Neville’s and the good-natured jolly man not only knew how to mind his own business but he did his job well.
He gave a jump and looked at the other with wide eyes, only realizing that Draco was in front of him, completely clean now as he looked at Harry with a sad smile.
“Go start on the shower first, love. I’ll follow when I’m done.” Draco told him, soaping up one of the mugs.
Draco straightened out and gave his boyfriend a kiss as thanks. "I'm going to stay with you until you're done and then I suggest we both take a good wash in the stream before returning to bed." He said as he made his way back to the tree to put on his clothes.
They got Victoire to smile again with Draco speaking comforting words to the little girl in French while Harry made sure to serve her an extra  large piece of her favorite cherry dessert.
He had been a die-hard tea fan until he got together with Draco and discovered the wonderful world of coffee. Now Harry preferred to drink coffee right when he woke up and enjoyed tea later in the day.
Shaking his head, Harry looked to his right, unable to stop himself from smiling- not that he wanted to- as he stared at his blonde partner who was still snuggled in their blankets beside him.
Almost one month later, it was finally the right time for her trip so Andromeda was now here to drop Teddy off for the weekend.
“But I learned best by actual example- not by Mother, of course- but I had many ‘play dates’ with other kids my age and some of the older children who were already potty-trained basically demonstrated how it was properly done. By the time I was five, I was properly potty trained in both ways.” Draco finished.
They all enjoyed the spaghetti bolognese that Harry cooked, Teddy especially loving the cheesy garlic bread.
Harry yawned and he blearily blinked awake. He absently reached for his glasses that was on the side table and put them on.
This is what Harry had wanted. He loved seeing his lover out in the wild, feeling good and free enough to just rip arse with no care to what was around them. Yeah, the blond usually did that at home, but it was different when they were out in the open, with no walls hiding them in.
Harry nodded. “Wow. That’s pretty interesting. I didn’t think of how different it would be to be trained in stuff like this.” It seemed he continued to learn new things everyday in the Wizarding World.
One of the most mind-reeling things that Harry discovered was actually during one of his History of Magic classes (shockingly enough).
Victoire loved her Uncle Harry’s warm bear hugs, his homemade desserts and his jokes that always made her laugh till her tummy hurt.
Harry raised his eyebrow as his lover made his way back to the bush, his entire bottom half completely bare to the world. "You know, Draco. Most guys just lower their pants and go.” He pointed out, recalling the blond had done just that earlier.
Harry was nervous because he had never went in front of anyone before- at least not defecated in front of anyone but his Aunt when he was young.
He held his arms up for the little girl and once in his arms, gave her a soft kiss on her cheeks. “Oh, honey. It’s alright. It was only an accident after all.”
As Teddy went back to playing with his blocks, Harry joined Draco who now sat on the floor and wrapped an arm around the other. “Good job, Professor Malfoy.” He winked at the blond.
Draco grinned and leaned forward, with his bum still letting out a torrent of toxic gas, as he captured the other’s lips in a deep kiss.
Glamping stood for Glamorous Camping. It was like luxury found in the woods and apparently the ‘in’ thing that a lot of Muggles did nowadays.
Harry sat there, now unsure of whatever emotions were currently churning inside of him as he tried to make sense of everything around him.
Harry looked down as he quietly answered. “It’s…d-different. I think it’s fine for you but it’s different when it’s me. Not just embarrassing but it’s like it too intimate, too…too much. It’s dirty.” He mumbled the last part mostly to himself.
Harry blushed harder as he whispered so quietly that Draco almost missed the words. “Since the day the toilet had broken.” He confessed.
Harry grumbled under his breath as he let go of the plunger, wiping the sweat that was dripping down his face.
“Right. And I need to strengthen the wards as well.”  Harry sighed, finally giving in and resigning himself that it was finally time to leave their warm nest.
“Thankfully, robes for children had spells weaved into the fabric that helped negate the smell for them- and it was more effective since the robes were smaller than a regular adults, so the magic in them was more concentrated.
Harry hummed as he wrapped his arms around the other, hugging his boyfriend closer to him, breathing in the other’s sweet apple scent from their body wash.  He yawned. “You say that as if it’s a bad thing.”
Harry lifted his head to even peek at the other side of the bed. There was no puddle as well- which was a given since he had seen it vanish right before his eyes.
Putting the seat down, Harry shoved his pants and knickers down and sat down in a swift motion. He perked up at Draco.
He reached for Draco’s hand, quickly pulling the other down on the couch and he shifted so now Harry was the one that was on Draco’s lap.
After living years of eating meals made by his family’s house elves or at fine-dining restaurants, and later on the meals that Hogwart’s elves cooked, Draco always looked forward to the homemade meals his lover would cook for them on most days. Draco now understood when people said that nothing beats a homecooked meal.
So they made a compromise. They would instead go on something that Harry had learned from Hermione when she had come back from visiting her parents in Australia- Glamping.
Harry looked thoughtful. “I wasn’t really taught. I think just before I was two, my aunt was already forcing me to learn how to use the loo by myself. I can’t remember much, but I do recall her screaming at me as I sat on the toilet while trying not to fall in since I was very tiny back then.
Tracing the smooth angles of the blonde’s cheekbones, Harry couldn’t help but admire how even more lovely his boyfriend looked when he was asleep, free from any stress or troubles.
Draco gave him the ‘look’ as he placed one hand on his rumbling stomach while giving shifting his gaze to Teddy.
Harry giggled as he saw the caught-off guard look on his lover’s face. “Wow. And you never even had your morning coffee yet.” He teased, knowing that their favorite brand of coffee tended to make the blonde extra gassy.
Draco grimaced as he swatted away a mosquito that was hovering too close to his face. “You better. I wouldn’t put up with this just for anyone, you know.”
Teddy especially loved the monkey exhibit- his favorite was the baby chimpanzee and both Harry and Draco laughed when they saw the little boy and the baby monkey making faces at each other.
“I can’t believe I’m about to urinate on a tree like a dog would.”  Draco sighed as he lowered his pants until his cock sprung free and aimed at the lower trunk.
Draco was quiet for a moment before he grinned. “So as long as it’s only in front of me then you’re fine with it?”
But his lover managed to wear down his resolve and that prat knew exactly how weak Draco was against his puppy dog look- those blasted green eyes of his could make Draco do anything to his will.
Harry looked around to make sure that he was still alone and then proceeded to give a few experimental pushes.
Harry coughed as his blushed a bit, the other raising an eyebrow at him. “Um…I probably might keep staring, actually. I-I don’t know how to explain it but, I can’t really look away when it happens. It’s…interesting? Sorry.” He said sheepishly.
“Wait! Do you want me to go out while you…” he trailed off as he looked away, wondering if he should wait in the kitchen or maybe their bedroom.
Harry laughed as he accio’d a bog roll to him. “Of course love, we may be out in the wild, but even I know there are limits.”
“Me neither. I actually don’t like to camp but I thought that if it was with you, I might find myself enjoying it.” Harry murmured, running his fingers through the blond’s silky hair.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “You know that magic makes things trickier when it comes to Muggle things- especially plumbing. I think we’ll need a professional.”
Draco smiled at him wryly as he pointedly looked down at Harry’s open fly. "Sorry, dear. I woke up because I had to relieve myself and I figured you had the same idea when I realized you were gone. I then saw the lit walkway you made and just followed it.” He cringed a bit as he held his rumbling tummy. “I don’t think our meal is sitting well in me by the way.”
Harry held up one hand, trying to redirect his focus from his bottom half to manifesting his magic and called out, “Accio, bog roll.”
He knew that Harry had been anxious about going in front of him, his fear amplified due to his past trauma caused by those blasted relatives of his. So the blond did his best to make sure his lover felt comfortable, safe and especially loved and would trust that Draco would always be there for him and nothing would ever change that.
Harry’s own eyes opened wide in shock as he stared at his lover who’s face was quickly turning redder than a pepper imp candy.
Harry himself actually also did not enjoy camping- living on the run for about a year in the woods made him love having a roof over his head that much more.
Harry stared at him, the only thought on his mind was that this was the first time he actually saw Draco’s face while the other did his business.
Harry chuckled as he made a gesture around them. “It’s all around us. Dear, you didn’t really expect there to be plumbing here, did you?”
As Harry was in the middle of telling Draco about Andromeda asking if they could look after Teddy next weekend while she planned to take a weekend getaway with Narcissa to France (the two sisters had made up after the war and were inseparable nowadays- always visiting each other almost everyday) Draco put his cup down and made to stand up.
Good news: the doll was brought up during the explosion and now safely back in her arms with little damage done.
Draco blushed again but didn’t stop him as he watched as his lover’s face twist and a few moments later, a small *POOT* could be heard.
The conversation stopped there, but Harry spent the rest of the day thinking about what had transpired.
"Okay, you're all good to go. This will make things easier for you." Harry announced and not a moment too soon as Draco immediately painted the bush with yellowish brown diarrhea.
Teddy managed to stay energetic until they hit the aquarium. The tired little boy was now found snoring lightly on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco groaned as he let Harry go and stood up, crouching a bit as he held his slight pooching tummy. “I think I gotta go.”
With a few more poots and a last fart that was wet enough to paint the bush yellowish-brown one more time, Draco sighed as he finally straightened up, wincing at the pain in his back from bending over for too long.
“Harry, I need to go- where is the loo?” He asked, looking at the veggies that were cut up in a bowl. Since they were mainly doing things the Muggle way, he figured that relieving themselves would be done the same way.
So the night before their trip, Harry got everything ready- setting up the campsite and making sure everything was in order. He casted a spell so everything would be still be in place and ready for when he brought his boyfriend.
Draco took a deep breath and gave a loud grunt. Instantly, a very loud and wet fart boomed out of his arse, so large it caused Draco to lift his bum off the sofa and shake slightly from the sheer force of it.
When he was finally done peeing, Harry came up to the blond and placed his arm around his boyfriend’s shoulder, guiding Draco away from the small pool of diarrhea and carefully brought him to another nearby bush.
Harry blushed at that, reddening even more when he heard Draco comment under his breath, loud enough that Harry could hear, “Yes it is.” He sneaked a peek at the other and saw the blond sitting on the edge of the tub, giving him a wink.
Draco gave him an unidentifiable look before nodding his head and walking back towards the table, stopping about a foot away.
Any doubts that had lingered inside was now replaced by joy and love in Draco’s expression and he gripped Harry close to him, resting his forehead against the other’s as they both let out a sigh of content.
Harry winced at his last name being used. “Of course not, dear. That would be very…impolite and improper of me.” he apologized, giving the blonde puppy eyes as he wrapped an arm around the other.
Harry joined the conversation then. “Great, so now you know the wizarding way. We can have you try out the spells yourself, alright?”
A thought suddenly occurred to him and Harry’s eyes widened as he looked down at himself, lifting the blanket slightly.
