“Don’t be,” Harry shook his head, “this is the best I’ve ever felt.” He realised as soon as he had said it that he wasn’t even lying. Nothing could ever compare to this feeling that was threading underneath his skin at Draco’s touch.
Healer Sweetbridge had warned that a Fretterling Fever might mimic aspects of an omega heat and right now it seemed that was exactly what was happening. Harry realised with horror that a good portion of the bath water was also now sticky and smelled like honeydew. Draco was obviously releasing slick and sure enough, their new position meant that Harry could feel intermittent gushes of warmth where Draco’s arse was pressed against Harry’s leg.
“Oh!” Hermione emerged back from the wardrobe, her edges frizzy and a sparkle in her eyes. “I remember those. Gosh, she must think highly of you, they’re normally hidden away in her personal chambers. Did you see the one about the dragon?”
alpha, he wanted to be taken and mounted, to be loved and bitten.
Draco’s eyes opened momentarily, just enough for him to stare at Harry for a few seconds before he gave a tight nod. Harry toed off his socks before climbing into the bath and positioning himself behind Draco’s small frame. This way, Harry could wash off any smells that weren’t his own, comforting the other boy with his alpha presence, whilst making sure Draco didn’t fall unconscious.
Harry slumped back down into the chair in the headmistress’ office, this time choosing one with a cushion on it for the extra comfort.
“Um, mate?” Ron began hesitantly when there was suddenly a loud pop and a balloonful of custard exploded across the table, drenching several of the nearby diners in sticky dollops.
Ron frowned as if that was something he hadn’t quite realised.
Harry turned to see a small group of what looked to be Fourth Years piling into the ward, a couple of them were sporting bloodied lips and one rather strained looking girl was holding her arm in an unnatural angle. Harry hurried forwards, calling out again for Madam Pomfrey before he asked the group what had happened.
“Crikey,” Ron groaned, rubbing his own aching calves, “we’re meant to be going out tomorrow night for Seamus’ birthday.”
“Oh it’s on!” Harry suddenly laughed, a loud and brilliant sound and he sprinted across the globe and kicked up a cloud of snow to shower down on Draco. Draco squealed in surprise before relief flushed through him and he began giggling and joining in on the fight.
“Quite brazen of him to bring the omega here,” Muriel scoffed. “You’d think he would have sent the boy away somewhere.”
“But don’t” Draco frowned and nibbled on his lip. “Don’t they hate me?”
“Sorry we have to wake up so early,” Harry grimaced, “I just thought it might be a good idea to get you on the train before all the crowds descend on Hogsmeade Station.”
Draco tensed, staring down at his knees. Harry still had his arm around Draco and lightly squeezed his side.
“Severus, enough,” Remus spoke quietly and calmly but both Harry and Snape fell silent. “Any fool can see how much Harry adores Draco and in turn how much that boy loves Harry. I would be willing to form an unbreakable vow with you right now assuring that Harry will never mistreat his family.”
Harry began to thrust into Draco with his fingers as more slick pooled beneath his buttocks. The older man went back to licking Draco’s breasts, his obsession with them showing in the way he suckled tightly in time with his pistoning digits.
“No,” Harry shook his head, still looking thoughtful, “are you angry I kept the ceremony a surprise?”
“There we go,” Harry whispered, encouragingly. He tried to ignore the fact that he was completely hard in his jeans and had been since the first moment he had walked through the curtains. There was no denying it now, just how much Harry’s alpha, and Harry himself, wanted the boy in front of him.
Draco’s mouth dropped open, he couldn’t believe how crude this grown alpha was being. He supposed this was what his aunt Bella had in mind whenever she would drone on at Draco about the importance of being chaperoned everywhere, lest he encounter a drooling mindless alpha predator. Draco had always been sorely tempted to point out that Bellatrix was an alpha herself but he had bitten his tongue instead.
“You’re early!” A tall man with light brown hair and three jagged white scars across his face jerked open the door. Draco tensed, Harry had been right to warn him that Remus Lupin might spell like an alpha due to also being a werewolf.
Harry waited nervously at the foot of the arch, along with Ron, Sirius and Remus standing behind him. In the front row, Hermione sat with Lyra in her arms, wrapped in a lilac Liberty Print silk scarf. Katie was leaning over and shaking a small rattle that Neville had made from a pacay tree, one he had been growing himself for the past ten years. Harry’s daughter had never stopped gurgling and was happily babbling all throughout Luna’s cello instrumental.
Unfortunately, Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to live with Severus after graduation. However he hoped that Harry’s promise of looking into Draco’s inheritance might come through. Even if Draco was only able to get a little bit, it might still be enough for him to buy a modest flat somewhere that was safe to raise a child.
“Brilliant,” Harry sighed happily, lifting one of his hands away to gently cup Draco’s face. “That’s our baby.”
Draco moaned as Harry placed damp kisses across his brow and cheeks, there was a rising heat swirling in his groin and he didn’t know what to do with it but he was sure Harry would make it better.
“Draco had hot soup spilled on him, I don’t suppose you have any soothing ointment left do you Katie?” Hermione asked.
“Yeah, Madam Pomfrey says we shouldn’t apparate or floo for at least another week after Draco’s injury,” Harry told her. It’s not a big deal, we’ll find a quiet compartment on the Hogwarts Express and then get the bus to Padfoot’s.”
“Watch it,” Harry snapped, shaking his head at his friend before glancing in concern back at Draco. “You okay?”
“Harry, are you telling me you do not know Draco Malfoy?” Professor McGonagall questioned.
Draco thought miserably as he stirred the simmering potion
Harry sighed, “Yeah, I get how that would be weird. You could have warned me that Draco and Sirius were related.”
“May I touch you, Daddy?” Draco asked, his eyes flicking to Harry’s purpled cock, straining with arousal, having been denied release for so long now.
“We haven’t used this kitchen at all,” Harry commented regretfully, twisting round to look over at the small work surface.
“I’m sorry, can you repeat that?” Ron was staring at him aghast, the liquorice wand that had fallen out of his mouth twenty minutes ago was still stuck to the carpet.
Harry frowned, “I’m not sure if that would be comfortable for you.”
Harry jerked his head up at her as Ginny smiled serenely back before snorting and rolling her eyes. “Come on Harry, you know my brother can’t keep a secret after a good four pints.”
“Well,” Ron sighed, “I guess I better tell
“Merlin no!” Harry replied, regretting quite the level of denial he had infused his voice with. He didn’t want Draco to feel embarrassed about natural bodily functions but on the other hand he also wasn’t quite ready to reveal that the image of Draco leaking milk from exposed swollen breasts was more than a little arousing. “Honestly, Draco,” Harry cleared his throat whilst metaphorically trying to flick his inner alpha on the nose, “it’s a sign that your body is healthy. It must be a result of eating a bit more recently. I think it’s a good thing.”
“Well fuck me,” Sirius exhaled on a low whistle, staring hard at Draco. “It’s like I’m eighteen again.”
“He’s,” Harry cleared his throat, “he’s interesting looking.”
“Yeah well,” Sirius gave a strange laugh, “when you wrote to say you’d gotten a Malfoy pregnant I can assure you it was quite a shock.”
“Hey! That’s actually pretty good!” Ron exclaimed jovially.
“Oh, this is Draco,” Hermione, flapped her hand dismissively from the wardrobe. “Draco, this is Padma, Felicity and Katie.”
Draco smiled shyly as he imagined being in the middle of a grand ballroom somewhere with Harry as his partner, the alpha looking down fondly at him as they waltzed across the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s perfectly normal,” Madam Pomfrey noted, tilting her head towards Draco, “he just needs rest and your magical energy.” At some point, Pomfrey had lost her hat and her brown hair now stood in erratic frizzy curls, some of it plastered against her damp cheeks. Harry thanked both of the women, he felt exhausted himself and couldn’t even begin to fathom how Draco’s small body had gone through such strain.
“Right then, thank you for all portraying me as some sort of Scrooge who needs drugging to be an amenable host,” Sirius huffed, shaking his head and walking towards the staircase. “I’ll go let the poor sod in then shall I?”
“It’s okay,” Harry laughed, “I know what you’re trying to say. You’re right, it does seem a little unfair. Would you like me to take off my trousers?” He reached down to the drawstring of his bottoms whilst looking questioningly at Draco. Harry paused, not wanting to commit to anything without the omega’s express approval. It took a few moments before Draco licked his lips and nodded quickly.
Harry’s alpha side had been going a little haywire ever since finding out there was an omega carrying his child. He could only hope it would be appeased by moving Draco in close to him so Harry could keep watch over the younger boy.
Harry smiled, kissing Draco on the forehead. They had already decided that Hermione and Ron were going to be godparents but Harry had had a feeling Draco might also want to ask Katie. “Of course,” Harry told him before pulling back the curtains and sticking his head out.
“Thanks,” Harry replied, he knew that without Snape’s many potions and remedies Draco would have been in a lot more discomfort throughout the pregnancy. As it was, the omega had seemed in good spirits for the most part.
“Don’t be scared,” Harry murmured, reaching out to stroke through Draco’s hair. “I’d never hurt you.”
Draco nodded shyly, having an alpha in his nest for the first time was something he had only let himself dream of in moments of romantic self indulgence. He sighed happily, running his fingertips against the duvet as he heard the shower start up again.
it,” Draco stated firmly, licking urgently across Harry’s lips as the alpha let out a surprised moan. “I love you, you silly, wonderful, man.”
“If you’ll have me,” Harry smiled, sweeping back the younger boy’s sweaty fringe and pressing a small kiss to his forehead, “I would like to be your alpha even after the baby comes.”
“There’s a bump?” Harry jerked his head to stare questioningly at Draco. There was a strange expression on the alpha’s face that Draco couldn’t place but it almost made him want to run and hide.
Draco nodded lazily in agreement but evidently didn’t move his head quite right as Harry chuckled fondly, stroking the side of Draco’s cheek. The alpha lifted up Draco’s legs, holding his slender feet in the air and exposing Draco completely. Even after everything, Draco still found it within himself to blush as Harry stared down at Draco’s puffy and gaping hole.
“What?” Harry rolled his eyes and braced himself.
Draco swiped his fingers across the bulb of Harry’s cock, staring avidly at the mixture of the alpha’s precome and his own slick that coated his hand. The tentative touches continued, Harry locking down his inner alpha and remaining glued to the bed so as not to jerk up and scare Draco. Finally, Draco leaned in and pressed a careful kiss to the tip, his tongue darting out to press into Harry’s slit. The older man groaned, deep and rumbling as Draco looked up for approval.
Draco pulled a face but didn’t dare to disagree with her as he thought about Harry’s furious expression and drawn wand back in the hall.
“It…it’s right next to the compost heaps,” Draco whispered.
Draco always wore quite loose clothes on the upper half of his body, so as to better accommodate his bump. Harry’s mind was suddenly flooded with questions about whether Draco’s presumably previously flat chest had already started to swell?
“Yes Alpha,” Draco nodded, his eyes slipping closed as Harry’s heart swelled with adoration. Unfortunately, nothing Harry did seemed to quite get rid of all the slick, so he was forced to carry a grumbling Draco over to the sofa whilst he changed the bed sheets. After that, he pulled a thigh length t-shirt over Draco’s shoulders, figuring the omega might prefer not to be naked when he woke up.
money and I’ll still support him with mine and –“ Harry trailed off as he realised Snape’s expression had changed, he was still smiling but there was something a lot less practised and forced about it.
“So desperate,” another voice piped up.
“Perhaps,” Harry sighed, crossing over to the ensuite bathroom. “You should get into bed, you’ll get cold by the window.”
Draco was purring.
“No,” Harry huffed, pressing his finger under Draco’s chin and forcing the omega to look up at him again. “When I first found out about the spell and decided to let you keep the baby,
Harry smiled as he moved out of her way only to see two more students coming in, both with a hefty amount of mud on their faces. The boy was limping whilst the girl helped him along.
“You alright?” Harry asked, not waiting for an answer before he strolled over and drew Draco into a warm hug. Draco let out a shuddering breath as he felt Harry’s chin rest on the top of his head. “There’s still more presents or we can take a break? We’ve got profiteroles that need eating or I know Remus wanted to go on a walk along the river?”
“We anticipated fraternisation and whilst there is little we can do regarding entanglements of the physical nature between inhabitants of Gaedere House itself, I am incredibly disappointed in what you have done.”
“I do,” Olive replied proudly. “I graduated from the School of Magical Fashion Design in Lisbon before coming back to England and opening this boutique. My great aunt Dotty left me and my sister some money you see.”
Remus drew Harry into a tight hug, patting him on the back as his eyes fell on Draco.
Finally, they drew back, Draco’s body heaving for breath as they leaned against each other. Harry closed his eyes and smiled as the omega’s chest began to vibrate with low, soft purrs.
“Well well,” Smith smirked, “are you lost omega?”
“If you were to press charges against Mr. Malfoy,” she continued, “it would be incredibly traumatising for an omega…”
“Where do you want to get married?” Harry asked as Draco blinked at him.
“Stop blubbering,” Harry snapped, “I’m sure it will change back in a few hours. Until then, just avoid the penguin feeding area.”
“A little,” Draco admitted, not wanting to lie.
Draco slowly opened his eyes again, biting on his lip as he focused on letting the rigidity across his shoulders dissolve. Harry’s touch was so comforting and Draco still felt swollen and hot with arousal. His scent glands were throbbing in his neck, itching to be bitten and claimed and there was a deep ache inside him that wanted nothing more than to be filled.
“Don’t s-send me away,” Draco said, looking up at Harry with pleading eyes. “Please. I know I said I d-didn’t want anything but please don’t send me away.”
Draco woke up gradually and it took a good few minutes before his eyes focussed and he seemed to become properly aware of the surroundings.
“Okay,” Draco smiled happily as he watched Harry hurry out from the hall, jogging after Seamus. Draco vanished his plate before gathering his bag and heading for the main staircase.
“There’s your baby,” she announced happily as she ran her wand over Draco’s exposed stomach, his baggy cashmere sweater rolled up to just below his bralette.
“I –I’ve never done that before,” Draco admitted, gathering the courage to look up at Harry’s worried face. He knew his own tone was pleading, willing Harry to believe him. The only times Draco had produced slick before were in the darkened privacy of his own bed to fragmented dreams of the same alpha that was now standing before him.
“Do you offer all your customers that?” Harry chuckled.
Harry grimaced as one of Angelina’s beta friends sidled closer to him on the couch, her lips tinted blue and sticky from Sambuca.
A wide set, brunet man appeared as Harry quickly stepped in front of Draco and found himself letting out a warning growl.
“Isn’t that dirty?” Draco asked, turning round slightly and frowning at Harry, he looked completely perplexed and Harry simply wanted to gobble him up.
“He feels cold,” Harry sighed, “no matter how many warming charms I cast, he just feels icy.”
“I’m sorry sweetheart. The truth is, I only decided I would quite like a proper ceremony today and when I heard what Bellatrix was saying I wanted to wipe that smug look off her face,” Harry replied, stroking his thumb across the back of Draco’s hand.
“Did they involve being a giant tosser?” Harry asked, cocking his head innocently as Snape glared at him.
Draco raised his eyebrows, he had been thoroughly spoiled the entire day and it was getting a little embarrassing now. The present was small and rectangular and he unwrapped it to find a sleek steel photo frame. The picture inside showed two figures standing in front of the Great Lake, one of them in Slytherin robes.
“What a shame for you that the selfish spell you created decided to save parts of both of them,” Remus remarked wryly.
“I mean, I was originally a little peeved because with the timing and everything I figured you’d been seeing him at the same time as me.”
“They will,” Harry replied fiercely.
“Right, let’s make some brow -“ Harry was cut short by a dramatic squeal. He gaped as he was met with a flash of Draco’s very white bare buttocks, jiggling wildly as the omega scrambled to pull the duvet up from the nearby bed and around his nude body.
“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured, feeling even worse. On top of making a complete fool out of himself, he had also gone and ruined Harry’s night.
Draco excitedly pulled off his robes, leaving himself in his boxers and a thin t-shirt. He looked happily at the mound of lace, silk and frills, wondering which he should try first.
Eventually, he rounded a corner and collided with a large, hard body. Draco let out a winded noise as he stumbled backwards, clutching his bump. A hand reached out to steady him as Draco looked up at an alpha he knew was in Gaedere with Harry. The man’s name was Zacharias Smith and Draco was immediately on edge. This was the same alpha who had made those nasty remarks about Draco in the Great Hall.
“Yes, thank you,” Draco nodded. Harry rose to get up and sort out the bed Draco wanted moving when he felt small fingers around his wrist. “Harry,” Draco murmured, “you’ve been r-really kind in letting me keep my baby. You don’t have to do anything else for me.”
“Really?” Draco jerked his head up excitedly as Hermione chuckled and nodded.
“That’s insane!” Draco looked horrified
The waiter walked away as Harry leaned forwards to press a kiss on Draco’s cheek, “you’re going to need the energy,” he growled, low and promising as Draco’s gut flared with arousal.
He huffed and stood back up, cradling his bump as he walked over to the wardrobe and pulled it open. Inside was a stack of all the extra bedding that Harry had procured for him. This along with a sizeable amount of Harry’s own clothes, given that the alpha was basically living full time in the Morgana Suite with Draco now.
“Mum’s already knitting him some kind of maternity jumper,” Ginny sighed distractedly, pulling out her wand and checking the time.
Draco’s eyes jerked back to the photo, his mother was in a pale blue dress, having graduated the year before, although Draco couldn’t see a ring as the two figures’ hands were intertwined.
“I take it you’re in a better mood then?” Harry muttered, reaching onto the nightstand for his glasses.
“Oh I know,” Ginny sighed casually, “I just didn’t think you’d be dumb enough to get anyone else pregnant. But now I know you didn’t anyway.”
He and Ron were sat on the roof of the Gaedere annexe, wearing large puffer jackets and sharing a few cans of beer. It was February already and Draco was now five months pregnant. Harry wasn’t quite sure where the time had gone but whilst he had been horribly busy with training, Draco too had found much of his time occupied by NEWTS preparation.
At first, Draco thought it wasn’t working, but then the trees seemed to bow, their frosted tips sprinkling him with snow before they slid apart from each other and revealed a wide, open gap to a new path.
“No,” Draco groaned, tipping over on the bed and rolling into as much of a foetal ball as was possible whilst pregnant.
“Quite,” Remus grinned toothily, “It’s Bedlam at our place when the postman arrives.”
it,” Draco announced, with a small degree of vicious satisfaction.
^*^*^*^*^
“Fuck, I’m so lucky,” Harry groaned, kissing the omega again, licking his way hotly into Draco’s lax and receptive mouth. Harry’s hand didn’t stop massaging and pulling, milking all the aftershocks of Draco’s orgasm out of him. Eventually, it became too much and Draco let out a whine of discomfort, clearly over sensitised as he weakly tried to push Harry away.
her.”
“They didn’t work for me either,” Damien continued. “Say, Harry, would you walk with me for a bit? It gets awfully boring otherwise and all my friends are back in the compartment playing cards.”
“Well, how about you try them on for me and I’ll give you my honest opinion?” Hermione suggested as there was another knock on the door.
“Six brothers,” Ginny stated defiantly, “I know how men work.”
The Potions classroom was currently occupied with other students, but Draco had a free period and was able to skirt round the hidden tapestry of Medea poisoning Glauce’s robe and into a small stone chamber that adjoined Severus’ office.
“Right you,” Olive looked up at Harry before pointing towards a comfortable looking sofa in the corner. “I reckon you might as well take a seat whilst Draco and I start staging the next Fashion Week.”
“Harry, why does one of our fairy lights have a bottle of whisky?” Draco frowned as the fairy continued to huff and puff, heaving the large dusty bottle further up into the air. “Oh!” Draco gasped as brightly coloured jets of spells fired upwards, the fairy deftly weaving out of the way as Harry recognised Sirius’ shouts of outrage below.
“Oh, can you bring some of your fudge brownies over on Boxing Day?” Ron perked up, listening in on the conversation. “Only, don’t tell mum but they’re my favourite.”
“Draco fainted last night,” Madam Pomfrey explained, “he was brought up to the hospital wing unconscious. We did a scan and found he was with child.”
“Harry thinks I should do it,” Draco mumbled, trying not to bristle at Severus’ surprised look, after all, his godfather didn’t know Harry as well as Draco did. “But I would need a reference from my current Potions Master.”
“Mione!” Harry exclaimed, momentarily letting go of Draco’s hand and moving forwards to help disentangle his friend. Draco followed after them but gasped as he suddenly found the path blocked by an impenetrable wall of Christmas trees.
“Is um,” Remus cleared his throat, “is Bellatrix pleased by your news?” his eyes flicked to Draco’s baby bump.
“Madam Pomfrey would like you to go for a check up today,” Harry said, “some routine scans, nothing to worry about. Reckon you could manage some breakfast first?”
Draco looked over his shoulder, his cheeks were sweaty and flushed, his silky hair turning curly at the ends. “C-Can we…do we have time…”
“You like that little one?” Harry half whispered, as if afraid to break the spell in the otherwise quiet room. “You like that Daddy will take care of you? Always make sure you’re safe and spoiled?”
“They’re all our patronuses, this stag is mine and yours is there too. I can see Hermione’s, Ron’s, Molly’s, Sirius’, Remus’, I
“Oh, okay,” Draco said quietly, biting his lip on a pleased smile. He had never heard of an alpha helping an omega with their nest before. Providing scent for it sure, but to actually be bothered with the trivial details of making it? That was certainly not something Draco had imagined an alpha would concern themselves with.
Draco relaxed his shoulders with a sigh before nodding again as knowing triumph registered on Katie’s face.
Harry gently led him back into the living area and they continued to unwrap the rest of the gifts whilst Sirius put on some festive music from an old vinyl store he had visited in the Philippines.
“Watch it,” Harry growled angrily.
“Yeah,” Harry pulled a contorted expression, “I can see why you wouldn’t get the best impression from her.”
“Try?” Harry said, somewhat pleadingly. He couldn’t help but feel jealous again that Draco was confiding in Hermione but not him.
The argument between the alphas was growing louder, with other people getting involved as Draco let himself be tucked up against Hermione’s chest and ferried out of the Great Hall. The beta woman smelled like shortbread and crystallised ginger and Draco noticed that she was leading him towards the castle’s stone annexe that housed the older students.
“Nah, we’ll do the rink first,” Ron peered down at the map, “work up an appetite then have lunch somewhere, I bet there’s loads of free samples.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply when he suddenly tensed and let out a distressed noise. Harry only realized why a moment later when there was a heavy creak on the stairs and the smell of an unknown alpha wafted across to them.
Harry didn’t really mind that Ginny had gone back to Dean. Harry and her had been on again off again fuckbuddies for the last three years and he was pretty sure that when she grew bored of Dean, Harry would find her back in his bed with teasing words and clever hands.
“Draco, I –“ Harry began as Draco let out another frustrated sound. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
“Look, Damien,” Harry sighed, trying to not be as cold or blunt as Hermione used to scold him for being when rejecting potential partners.
house. I’m sure the guests will entertain themselves if you’d like me to fuck you properly.”
the baby.
Harry froze, pure anger was prickling underneath his skin.
“No,” Draco replied miserably, “but everything hurts.”
“I know,” Remus agreed, “but I think we’ll have to wait until the formidable Hermione Granger gets into the Ministry before we can expect any big changes to such an antiquated system.
Despite having been hit in the middle of his torso by the spell, the baby appeared to be unharmed. Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that Draco had redirected his own magical core so as to shield the foetus, a natural defence mechanism for pregnant omegas. This is turn meant that Draco was going to be pretty weak and shaky for a few days and Harry was going to need to siphon him more energy than usual.
Draco watched her go before looking back awkwardly at Harry.
“The place looks great,” Harry noted cheerfully.
Draco watched as Harry rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, revealing hairy, dark forearms, the corded tendons flexing as he grabbed his tall ginger friend and steered them over to the Gaedere table. Draco blushed and flicked his eyes downwards back at his abandoned meal.
Colum, the other man must have been wearing an enhancer charm.
Shame flushed through Draco, he hated how pathetic he must seem.
Eventually, after ten more minutes of twists and turns they emerged out into a large clearing. In the middle was a Christmas tree, but this one was completely draped in all different coloured lights, glittery tinsel, hanging baubles and, amusingly enough, a rather harangued looking fairy sat on the very top of it instructing winners to only take one present per person.
“Merlin,” Harry laughed, trying to play it off, “if you’re telling me you can smell who I’ve been in bed with then that Weasley-Delacour summer party last year must have been an eye opener for you.”
honourable. After all, you were raised by Sirius,” Remus smiled, evidently attempting to diffuse the angry alpha pheromones in the air. Harry sighed, he hadn’t even realised he’d been putting them out.
“I’m useless!” Draco mumbled, throwing himself down onto the nearest chair.
“Um, why is there an omega in his underpants by your bed Hermione? I thought you and Ron were working things out?”
“What f-for?” Draco snapped, he was still feeling nauseous from his over ambitious breakfast and being around so many different alphas and betas in the crowd was making him dizzy, tendrils of panic prickling down his spine.
“Draco,” Harry hissed, leaning forwards and holding Draco’s face in his hands, he gazed at the omega in wonder for a moment before kissing him squarely on the mouth and whispering, “I think you’re having the baby sweetheart.”
“And of course then there’s Ursula White’s annual Yule party,” Damien added casually.
“I don’t know,” Draco wrinkled his brow, he hadn’t even thought about using his wand to help with the nest. “I think so, a lot of omegas don’t because of the smell but your magic just smells like you.”
“Blimey,” Ron stared at his girlfriend before turning back to Harry and looking apologetic. “Yeah, alright, sorry mate. You know I support you.”
Whilst not threatening enough to warrant Draco’s transfer to the Hospital Wing, Sweetbridge had given them detailed instructions on how to control his temperature, an ice bath being one of them. Apparently the fever was the body’s reaction to when the omega would normally have been going into heat. She also mentioned that Draco’s symptoms might evolve or change, anything from disorientation to arousal. Harry had begged the heavens that he wouldn’t have to deal with the last thing.
“Oh keep your knickers on,” Sirius huffed, “It wasn’t meant to imply anything other than Bellatrix has always been a vile piece of work. The woman burned ants with a magnifying glass for fun whilst the rest of us played gobstones and made sandcastles.”
“Can’t bloody think about anything else,” Ron huffed, sinking miserably further down in his seat.
“Buggered off down to Hogsmeade,” Ron sighed “Merlin knows why, it’s pelting down.”
“Circe’s tits,” Remus suddenly laughed, causing both Draco and Sirius to stop what they were doing and peer curiously over at him. “Oh, James would have
“Sorry!” Draco exclaimed, hurrying to unclip his dungarees whilst Katie and subsequently Hermione came over to help him into the blue dress.
“I need to get back,” Harry told the two men, “I’ve got a meeting with Professor Tung.”
Harry muttered another hex that Draco couldn’t quite hear, however a second later Smith screamed out in pain before clutching wildly at his crotch. A weird, salty, briney smell permeated the air.
“Sorry I’m late,” Harry announced, affecting his best nonchalant cheer. “Thought I’d come and check on how you’re feeling today?”
“I’m sure he’s fine Olive,” Harry grinned, “Draco’s only two months pregnant, although I’m surprised you didn’t notice his scent earlier.”
Draco was still staring intently down at his bowl of soup but he thought he recognised Toby Flint’s voice. “You really think someone with their pick of omegas would bother getting it up for
“You…” Damien’s mouth fell open as his cheeks turned red. Harry could finally smell embarrassment on the other boy.
mum before Ginny gets to her first.”
The wall tiles were contrastingly cool as Harry leaned his forehead against them, reaching down to squeeze the base of his uncooperative cock. He hissed as the touch brought momentary gratification.
“You look like an angel,” Harry blurted out, wincing as Sirius sniggered before Remus batted him across the head.
Suddenly, Draco had found himself with a nose full of heady alpha scent as a large body had knelt down beside him to help. It had been the first time Draco had ever been up close to Harry Potter and the other man smelled divine, like cinnamon and bonfire smoke.
“Shit,” Harry swore as the omega’s eyes fluttered closed again. Harry was bent over the side of the bath at an awkward angle, trying to make sure Draco didn’t slide down. At the same time he managed to shuck off his shirt and jeans, sniffing himself to see if any of the scent causing Draco distress was still lingering on his skin. There was, unfortunately, the very faint but present hint of almonds. Harry huffed frustratedly - he hadn’t even
The younger boy was fresh from the shower, Harry having insisted Draco warm up after they had returned from Hyde Park. Draco’s skin was still flushed pink and his slightly damp hair was stuck to his neck and forehead in places. Harry had offered to cast a drying spell, however after his accident, Draco had become very reticent about the idea of having spells aimed at him, even if Madam Pomfrey had assured him they were baby safe.
“You’re seventeen!” Harry exclaimed, feeling angry again. “That’s legal wizarding age.”
been a little too close to Draco’s scent glands for the omega’s characteristic sense of propriety.
Draco laughed and Harry was pleased he had managed to share a joke with the omega. In fact, the younger boy seemed to be almost leaning in to Harry now.
“No, thank you, I can’t,” Harry replied, noting the relief that washed through his own body at the decision.
“I’m Nadia by the way,” she nodded, “if you fancy anything else, just send a patronus down to the guard’s carriage and I’ll come back.”
“Are..are these?” Draco’s eyes widened as Harry beamed at him.
Apparently, Harry had a muggle uncle and aunt in Surrey somewhere, although he had never actually met them.
Draco whimpered, closing his eyes tightly as a gush of warm slick pulsed stickily from his hole, saturating Harry’s lap. “You’ll always remember this,” Harry promised, nipping at Draco’s lobe, “whenever you walk past this spot, you’ll know it was where you let your alpha knot you so naughtily, with all those people just downstairs.”
Harry huffed a laugh, “I think you’re forgetting that said seventeen year old is still pregnant with my child.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry reached out to squeeze Draco’s knee over the blankets, “I honestly was thinking of coming back early anyway. I wasn’t enjoying myself too much.”
“Alright, so maybe tonight then, yeah?” Harry asked, climbing out from the bench and gesturing for his friend to wait for him. “We could try the touch thing whilst I feed the baby magic?”
“Just thought you might want to get back in the game,” Ron added, “hey did you hear Ginny finally dumped Dean? He’s been going on about how he’ll go all out tomorrow, single and ready to mingle and all that gumph,” Ron laughed.
, Harry thought miserably.
“Already sorted,” Hermione smiled, handing Draco the neatly folded clothes. The joggers were stretchy and white whilst the sweatshirt was a pale powder pink and felt soft to the touch. It was the kind of ridiculously comfy and casual wear that Bellatrix would no doubt sneer at and Draco felt a vicious kind of joy as he gratefully accepted the pile from Hermione. There were even a pair of delicate white ankle socks with ruffled tops.
“Madam Pomfrey?”
arse under all those robes.”
“Merlin, I’ve always known you were a piece of shit,” Harry laughed grimly, drawing his wand from his sleeve as Smith’s face hardened and he did the same.
“Ronald, I do not want a repeat of the sauerkraut incident,” Hermione warned her boyfriend, “please remember that even
Draco’s neck was long and swan like and Harry could see the line of three freckles he had spotted that first time in the Hospital Wing.
“Do you mean the driveshaft?” Draco asked, looking confused.
“Sorry, that’s something muggle builders do – figured I’d really try to get into the role,” Harry explained. Draco shot him a glare as Harry quickly hurried over to give the omega an apologetic kiss on the forehead.
too eager to be back at school right?”
“A patio?” Harry frowned.
“It’s not that,” Draco retorted crossly, “we’ve just gotten to know each other better now.”
“You have Uther Cobblet’s b-book,” Draco stated as Hermione pulled open a wardrobe and began rummaging through the hangers and drawers.
“Like Mrs. Weasley and her mate!” Draco exclaimed brightly.
“So, um, Draco I know you were a little worried about him being lonely with you coming here for Christmas,” Harry began, clearing his throat.
“Heavens above…” Remus whispered, drawing away from Harry and gaping at the omega. Draco blushed under the scrutiny, not sure why the other man was so shocked, they were already well aware he was pregnant. “Sirius!” Remus yelled, angling his head slightly into the building.
Besides, Harry was sitting closest to Draco, his left arm outstretched over the side of the settee so as to occasionally brush his fingers against Draco’s knee. The fire was crackling happily away as the groundskeeper Hagrid, whom Harry was apparently very close to, had brought dried logs from the stores.
Draco keened beneath him, cool fingers coming up to grip at Harry’s biceps, tugging him even closer. Harry grinned as Draco sat up on his haunches, angling his head so as to place a kiss on Harry’s cheek, before rubbing their faces together.
Harry nodded his gratitude before jogging over to the annexe’s utility room and exit. The day was cloudy but still relatively bright and Harry spotted Draco’s dark robes across the grass and down by the water.
Harry glanced up to see Remus stare at Sirius for a moment before winking at Harry.
“It’s Saturday, mate,” Ron grimaced.
Draco’s face fell, had he misread this completely? Did Harry think the nightgown was horribly vulgar?
“I’ve never seen your body,” Draco admitted, looking more than a little flushed. “Not that I’ve seen any alpha’s body, just –“
“Would you like a wet wipe Mr. Potter?” Madam Pomfrey asked without looking at him. “Or maybe a cleaning charm? I can assure you you’ll become quite adept at them once the baby comes.”
“I am now,” Damien replied, still holding onto Harry and sweetly looking up at him.
“Hold on,” Harry instructed, placing his hands over Draco’s bony hips and hoisting him up onto Harry’s thighs so that the two of them were facing the same way.
“I suppose not,” Severus sighed, “I’m guessing your unruly alpha has already picked out a name?”
“Oh you know Harry,” Ron grinned, “so laid back he’s horizontal. I swear he doesn’t even notice half of the pretty omegas drooling over him.”
“So, is there a reason you’re wearing a decorative throw?” Harry smirked. Draco tried to send the alpha his best glare but he didn’t think it worked as the man just laughed and shook his head. “Oh good, there’s a sofa up here too,” Harry remarked, looking over to a smaller green couch. “I’ll make myself comfortable and you can show me what you try on if you like?”
“Bollocks to that,” Harry muttered. Hermione had told him all about the Malfoys the previous week and from what she had said, it sounded like they had been absolutely loaded. Bellatrix must be sitting on a massive pile of gold that should for all intents and purposes be Draco’s.
Draco accepted a glass of water a few moments later from Harry, staring down at the cup and feeling pretty shoddy about himself. He should be
“I know it’s silly,” Draco shrugged.
“That one hurt,” Draco pouted, “I think they’re excited to meet their daddy.”
“You, um,” Ron cleared his throat, “you fancy him then?”
want to start a family with you. Don’t misunderstand me, yours and Draco’s baby is always going to be your first child and in your life and you will be a bloody brilliant father but after we all graduate, Draco is going to go and live somewhere with the baby and you are going to be somewhere else.”
“Oh, I see,” Olive’s face fell in sympathy before she studied the photo again. “Well, would you like to try and find something like she’s wearing in the picture? She looks absolutely wonderful in it and I can see you’ve inherited her genes.”
“Draco’s godfather,” Harry announced, “he normally spends Christmas with Draco but of course this year…”
“Am I allowed to be here?” Draco asked, feeling nervous.
“Professor McGonagall reckons people are already going to make assumptions about Draco,” Harry replied awkwardly as Hermione made a noise of agreement. “If I go out there and tell them it was a spell he cast then that’s only going to make them think worse of him.”
“Good, and what about the baby?” Dean asked, earning an ugly snort from Ginny. Harry glared at them as Hermione sent Dean a withering look.
Draco pushed open the door to the Potions rooms, peering around in the shadowy space.
Harry stood back and grabbed his glasses from the nightstand. “Draco I
“Shitting hell,” Ron panted, clutching his rolled up jeans over his underpants.
The noise of the bathroom door made Draco still, but he kept his hand where it was, the very tip of his index finger breaching his hole. Harry entered the room, silhouetted at first by the light of the bathroom, but after he turned it off, Draco could see that the alpha was naked.
“S-Stupid,” Draco huffed. Harry was pleased though, the omega seemed to have relaxed and the tremble that had previously been shivering through his body had subsided as he reached up to paw at Harry’s chin. “I just like yours.”
Hermione had yet to say anything, but Harry could tell she was bursting to. He had managed to get his best friends alone that evening, in a small study room in the Gaedere annexe. The walls were covered with Rococo style paintings, the occupants of which were listening closely. Harry figured as soon as he left, the figures would be off, dashing between canvases to spread the news that Harry Potter had impregnated some hapless omega.
After presenting omega, however, it switched more to just being icily ignored. A month ago, Draco had been half wondering if he had started turning invisible as a group of second years had obliviously barrelled into him on the third floor corridor.
“Did they?” Harry asked, a hint of amusement in his voice before he sighed again. “Are you sure you’re okay? I can send up a wand flare and the maze attendants will come get us.”
Harry’s own mouth dropped open in indignation.
“Do you want me to stop?” Harry asked carefully.
Harry had always expected to bond with someone after years of dating. Maybe after he had progressed to becoming a mid level auror and was ready to start a family. He tried to imagine that still happening, of meeting someone else in the future. However, no matter how many times he pictured it, the person would always morph back into Draco.
Draco’s mouth fell open as he began to moan loudly, Harry cock slipping past his sticky lips and batting against his chin.
Harry chewed the inside of his cheek, he knew that lack of intimacy, whether physical or social, could really affect omegas. Plus, from what he had learned, Draco was also an orphan and the idea of having Snape as your godfather instead of the warmth of Sirius and Remus, Harry shivered at the thought.
Together they continued to modify the nest with Draco giving instructions until it looked exactly how he had always wanted. He hesitated at the edge of the bed, he could sense Harry’s magic all around him, holding the nest together with trails of cinnamon.
“Draco?” Hermione was stood in the hallway, looking at him with a questioning smile. “Come with me, I want to show you something.”
Harry walked down the gangway towards the toilet, the train was leaning a little from side to side and one of the top windows had fallen open, allowing in a bracing draught until Harry quickly shut it. It was quite far down from their compartment but he had gotten in the habit recently of worrying about Draco getting cold.
Katie packed up Draco’s robes in a tote bag before giving them back to him and he bid goodbye to her and Padma, promising that he would be back to visit as soon as he had grown a bump. Felicity led Draco down a stone hallway, the light filtering in through stained glass windows until they reached an arched doorway from behind which they could hear Hermione’s raised voice.
Snape gave a small strangled sound as Remus stood up and walked out of the garden, resting his hand on Harry’s shoulder before leaving across the lawn.
“So, you noisy lot want to come meet your new goddaughter then?”
“I believe I owe you an apology Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall stated over what Harry swore was her eighth cup of tea that morning. He figured though that the headmistress probably really needed it considering one of the omega students was pregnant on her watch.
“He did,” Katie replied, reaching out to take Draco’s hand and falling into place beside him as they began to walk down the corridor. “How are you feeling today? Bloody hot isn’t it?”
The entire place stunk of pheromones and there were definitely at least two omegas in the stages of preheat. Ron was already trollied, him and Michael Corner holding an overly loud and nonsensical conversation about gnome magic.
“Suit yourself,” Seamus replied, disbelievingly.
Eventually they came to an area where a young blond witch sat next to a massive glass sphere, close to the size of a small room. Draco tried to look inside, however the sphere was almost opaque, being full of densely swirling snow.
“Just try?” Draco asked, his eyes pleading. Harry huffed, he was never going to be able to say no to anything this omega wanted. God forbid their child inherited Draco’s pout as well.
“Now let’s just shuffle you forwards a touch,” Harry murmured as he helped the younger boy wiggle into a position that didn’t strain his back but also gave Harry access to begin his massage.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, looking pleased. “I’d like that.”
Harry sighed and shook his head, Ron had always been a little insecure about having presented as a beta when they were fifteen. This was despite the fact that most of the students in their year had matured into betas. Harry estimated there were only about twelve alphas in their cohort, with him included. Researchers claimed that the low alpha birth rates for their year were a direct result of Voldemort’s uprising.
“You,” Harry cleared his throat, “you were friends with her?”
After finding out Draco was pregnant, Olive had excitedly started showing them her maternity line which was just as delightful as the rest of her designs. Draco had always imagined maternity wear would be rather frumpy and utilitarian.
,” Harry insisted fiercely, leaning down to kiss Draco hard and encouraging so that when he drew back the omega was breathless and dazed.
“What if I want to?” Harry bit out, groaning as Ron’s eyebrows shot up.
“Fuck,” Harry murmured in wonder, “we might need to redo the nest.”
“But Lily died,” Remus murmured.
Harry stared at her for a moment, his eyes narrowed.
“Draco,” Harry said firmly, causing the younger boy to tense. “Do you really think I would bring home a mate whilst also living with you and our child? Like some sort of harem?”
“Oh, well then I’m bloody delighted! Congratulations you two,” Sirius grinned. “Anyone want a cuppa?”
“It was an a-accident,” Draco said.
“Y-Your mother, was she a beta?” Draco asked. He figured if Lily Potter had been an omega, Harry would have mentioned it at some point.
Merlin it was wrong, Harry knew it was wrong but he bit his lip hard as the moving picture of him fucking into Draco floated across his vision. Dream Draco’s mouth was wide open in a perfect circle as Harry held the omega’s thin wrists behind his back with a single dark hand. The omega’s own ivory skin would be shiny with sweat and his small pert breasts would be bouncing happily with Harry’s thrusts.
“That fucker,” Harry bit out, “you already taken one?”
“They’re very nice,” Harry agreed, suddenly imagining the omega in front of him dressed in that outfit. His throat went a little dry as he pictured Draco smiling to himself as he rolled sheer stockings up his pale legs.
Olive nodded, “Yes, he carried me, whilst our mother gave birth to Audrey.”
“Draco know about this?” Ron raised his eyebrows with a smirk.
“I’m not sure,” Harry cleared his throat, “I mean, I have bigger hands than you,” Harry blinked at his own insanity, what the
Harry did his best to exude comforting pheromones as he stroked his fingers through Draco’s gossamer hair, it was softer even than the fine silks at Olive’s.
Draco let Harry lift him up off the seat before walking back over to the bed. He felt hot now after having moved so many things about and shed himself of his lavender cardigan. He jumped in surprise as Harry let out a loud wolf whistle. He turned around to see the older man laughing.
“That’s kind,” Harry smiled, some of the tension at sharing the news with his best friends slipping away. “I think we would rather just get bonded sooner rather than later though. Although it would be a nice idea to have a celebration.”
“Are you feeling excited?” Katie asked Draco, gently nudging his side. Draco blinked at her, these women were acting as if this was all normal and happy, like an unmated social pariah of an omega wasn’t in their midst.
“Bother!” Draco exclaimed suddenly.  Harry glanced round to see the younger boy staring petulantly down at some carved pieces of wood and odd metal pins in his hands.  Draco looked so put out that Harry half wanted to laugh but he didn’t think the omega would appreciate that.
“Venetia Dawson’s been smelling awfully sweet when you’re around,” Seamus grinned with his teeth on display.
“The bell’s already rung so you should be safe from any more stampeding hoards,” Harry told him and as Draco lifted his head the man had
“You were testing me,” Harry grunted angrily. “Don’t you think it’s a bit late for that? We’re already bonded.”
“But –“ Draco began as Katie mock glared at him and he giggled and fell silent.
Draco noticed that Sirius had disappeared, ducking into a side room before they all sat down.
Draco made a noise of distressed protest as Harry laughed and resigned himself to a very sticky sleep, perhaps the bubble bath could wait until morning after all.
“I’m sorry!” Draco exclaimed, his voice already sounding scratchy and
“Please don’t be,” Harry frowned anxiously, stepping forwards. “I shouldn’t have been so long in the shower,” he added guiltily. Poor Draco had probably been awake and waiting to use the bathroom for ages before giving up and attempting to change in the bedroom.
“Draco’s inherited that as well then,” Harry beamed, “he got five Os in his mock NEWTS.”
“In a ticklish way you b-brute,” Draco replied, undoubtedly trying his very best to look cross.
“I love you too,” Draco replied, mewling at the loss of Harry’s fingers as the alpha repositioned them.
“Suck up,” Ginny snorted, grabbing her brother’s arm and tugging them in the other direction. “We’ll race you there then.”
“I’m sorry Harry, but really, where’s that come from?” Hermione snickered, “it’s not like you to have an existential crisis over cottage pie at half six in the afternoon.”
“Actually, I’m feeling a little hot in this silly big jumper,” Damien laughed. The pretty omega stopped to pull off his knitted green sweater to reveal he was only wearing a t-shirt underneath. Harry was also immediately blasted in the face by a thick, sugar sweet smell. It was like Damien’s natural odour but even more condensed.
“Well we’re graduating in a few months and I’m also going to be a father by then,” Harry replied wryly. “It was probably about time.”
“You’re not really my alpha,” Draco said quietly, still not looking Harry in the eye. “You don’t have to –“
“Your godfather won’t be pleased,” Draco remarked but he sounded amused.
Draco nodded as she gestured for him to sit down on what was presumably her bed. There was a tall stack of magical theory books, including a rare volume about rune composition that Draco had always wanted to read.
“Bill’s French wife’s cousin is here,” Muriel declared, “she’s an omega and around Harry’s age at that.”
“Honestly mate,” Harry shook his head, “sometimes I think you’re
Draco nodded happily as he opened the door the Morgana Suite and tottered over to the wardrobe. He pulled out a broderie Anglaise dress in a pale blue cotton. It had delicate flounces on the shoulders and elbow length puffy sleeves. He knew that Harry hadn’t seen the dress before as he had ordered it online from Olive’s after his inheritance had come through. Olive had even included a beautiful pair of sandals and a long periwinkle ribbon which Draco used to tie his hair in a small plait.
Other omegas would constantly touch each other for comfort and security. Friends would cuddle together and gossip about alphas whilst Draco was left, ostracised on the outskirts looking in. Severus had never quite appreciated the level of the other students’ apathy towards Draco or perhaps he simply didn’t know how to help. In the first few years the distain had been acted out physically with stuck out legs to trip Draco up or sharp elbows to his ribs in the quidditch changing rooms.
^*^*^*^*^
“You know my mother’s the same towards my dad,” Olive said. “Can’t refuse that man anything.”
“Her love was more than enough to choose to sacrifice herself,” Snape continued with a sigh, “as was his father’s. They died that day to save their son, it’s true. However, it was the spell that cemented the emotion into a shield, rebounding a killing curse from the most powerful dark wizard of our time.”
“I suppose you must be very pleased with yourself,” Venetia announced as Draco attempted to hurry past her. “No wonder you always looked so smug.”
“Right then, you’d best change out of those wet robes. I’ve got some joggers here along with a sweatshirt that I think will fit you."
Snape jerked his head up in surprise and Harry loved that he had finally unbalanced the normally stiff professor.
Draco was happiest with his nose in a book, cuddled up on the sofa next to Hermione or Katie. He was proudest when telling Harry about a new potion he had concocted with his godfather. He had even made an effort to get to know Ron, despite his initial misapprehensions about the other man.
“Why don’t you come in Draco?” Hermione asked kindly. “We’ll arrange for the house elves to bring you some food here seeing as you missed lunch.”
Harry joined hands with Draco, guiding him across the floor as they waltzed to the music. Draco was clearly classical trained and Harry had to apologise a few times for nearly stepping on the omega’s toes. Draco, having ditched his heels, was now pale and barefooted as he swayed and twirled. Fairies hovered about with firefly lanterns and Harry laughed and nodded for Draco to look as Professor McGonagall attempted to do an ambitious spin with a rosy cheeked Arthur Weasley.
“I don’t think that would be safe for pregnancy,” Hermione frowned beside them.
“There we go,” Harry breathed, pressing a tender kiss against Draco’s shoulder, “that’s my angel.”
^*^*^*^*^
“I guess it’s always the quiet ones,” an unfamiliar alpha sniffed in clear amusement.
Draco scrunched his eyes shut and tensed himself, feeling slightly disappointed as Harry let out an amused sigh and wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle, hugging him.
Draco squeaked with mortification as he tried to jump out of Harry’s lap, yelping as the sudden movement threatened to undo all the good the massage had accomplished. Harry quickly spread his legs, causing Draco to slip between them, effectively trapping him on the seat where he couldn’t do any more damage to himself out of embarrassment.
“Ah,” Harry stated as he saw that Draco was wearing a white nightgown with long sleeves and decorated cuffs. The fabric fell to just below his knees and Draco’s feet were pale and bare against the dark stone floor. Half of Gaedere House ran about in far skimpier wear but for some reason there was something rather provocative about the garment, as if it wasn’t meant to be seen by others.
The two of them collapsed against the floorboards, Harry careful not to let Draco’s skin touch the wood and be pierced by any splinters. Instead he cradled the still whimpering omega onto his chest, bundling Draco in his arms as the world continued to expand and contract, the room slowly spinning.
“True,” Harry grinned, pleased that Draco was being so thoughtful. “Both it is.”
Hermione nodded in understanding. Sirius was fiercely protective of Harry and if he got it in his head that some omega had taken advantage of Harry’s good nature then he would probably be the first to kick up a fuss.
“We watched Rosemary’s Baby at Halloween,” Remus explained drily to Harry and Draco, “It’s a muggle horror movie.”
“It’s stunning,” Draco admitted, running his fingertips over the set stones. “Thank you Harry.”
Harry and Remus exchanged self satisfied glances as Sirius and Draco began chattering about the carousel.  Despite Sirius being a relatively unknown alpha, Draco seemed to have relaxed and looked to be enjoying himself as the pyramid’s different levels came together.
^*^*^*^*^
“So why do you need
the last thing he remembered? Everything felt like a bit of a congealed blur. “We were revising financial sector reforms…I f-felt a bit weird…I remember being really thirsty.”
The ceremony passed in a wonderful blur of heartfelt words, laughter and the pervasive scent of apple pie. After the ritual, a grand buffet table was revealed, along with sliding glass doors, opening to a spacious, wood floored room inside the house, decked out ready for dancing.
Draco shuffled awkwardly, he had grown even closer to the curly haired woman over the last month of living in Gaedere House and whilst he still felt horribly shy around Harry at times, he was pretty confident about talking to Hermione.
A second later, a horrified roar echoed through the building.
“Shit, yes Draco,” Harry groaned, “you’re the best omega, look how good you are, letting your alpha milk your tits for you. I’m so prou-“
That evening, Harry walked out of the Morgana Suite bathroom to find Draco was wearing his strappy silk nightgown again. The creamy fabric appeared almost golden in the candlelight and his hair was down and curling at his nape.
“Okay,” Draco replied quietly, but he lifted his head up enough just to send Harry a small reassuring smile.
“Oh,” Draco blinked in surprise.
Harry snorted a laugh and settled back down, remembering that Remus was more than capable of defending himself.
“W-When the baby’s born,” Draco explained, “please let me stay with you. I won’t be any trouble. I won’t b-be upset when you bond with someone.”
“No, I do!” Draco insisted quickly, blushing as Harry chuckled. Madam Pomfrey bustled over to them a moment later and sequestered Draco onto a bed further along.
Harry wasn’t sure he did remember Gabby, although he had the vague impression that she might have been strawberry blonde.
The street was relatively crowded, which wasn’t all that surprising given that it was the weekend. Quite a few heads turned their way once Harry’s recognizable scar was spotted. People were probably also looking as Harry was so clearly a powerful alpha, his scent and stature giving him away. Harry, however, completely ignored everyone as he shot Draco a small, private smile.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, noticing his caution, “it won’t collapse.”
Harry frowned as his inner alpha’s desire to protect any omega from harm rose up within. He had always hated alphas who wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer and thought they were entitled to harass omegas into dating or spending time with them.
Surely Draco must know that Harry was aroused by him? It wasn’t like Harry was even attempting to hide it any more.
“Please stay,” Draco blurted out at the same time Harry said “Don’t worry, just forget it.”
“Oh no,” Damien swung slightly from side to side as he talked, “I was just feeling a little train-sick so thought I would go on a walk.”
The evening weather seemed contentedly mild at first, however the barometers were all pointing decidedly to storms. Sure enough, at around eight pm, the faint pitter-patter of rain began to echo on the annexe’s slate roof. The wind picked up quickly afterwards, grabbing fistfuls of droplets and lobbing them against the window panes.
Harry wondered absently if he should shave? His stubble was starting to cross the line into beard territory and his hair was also getting a little long and erratic. Upon hearing the curtain move behind him, Harry turned round to come face to face with a very nervous looking Draco.
Since then, every morning Harry stared up at the ceiling wondering why he was choosing to inflict such a special brand of torture upon himself. After the snow globe incident, Harry had tried to maintain at least some semblance of space. So although they were in the same bed, Harry carefully kept to his side.
“Did you just throw a snowball at me?” Harry asked, blinking behind his glasses.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, “too many people and too loud – think I’m getting old.”
Harry finished off the rest of his pint before checking in on Hermione and letting her know that he was walking back up to the school if she wanted to join. Hermione had declined with a sigh, saying she needed to speak to Ron again.
Harry looked around desperately, there was no fucking way he was going to risk taking Draco outside of the locked bathroom in his current state. They weren’t in the one attached to the Morgana Suite, given that it only had a shower. This meant Harry would have to carry the omega down the hallway to get back to the private quarters.
“You’re just being honourable,” Draco muttered. “You’re doing ‘the right thing’ because I’m p-pregnant.”
“Did you enjoy yourself?” Harry asked softly, crouching down beside Draco’s chair so that their faces were level.
“I didn’t know that could happen!” Draco exclaimed urgently, making Harry jump as nothing else had been said for the past minute.
“I was always warned not to eat the yellow snow,” Harry frowned suspiciously down at his own icicle before shrugging and smiling at Draco, “bottoms up!”
“Three cups so far,” Remus sighed, “I also spiked the eggnog.”
Draco bristled, leaning back to try and get the waiter’s attention again for the check. This had been a mistake, for one stupid moment he had thought he owed it to his aunt to meet up with her and hear what she had to say. Now, however, he could see she was never going to change and all he wanted to do was return to the castle, safe in the knowledge that Harry most certainly didn’t run in the same social circles as the Lestranges and Sourbolls of the world.
Plus, Draco had thought selecting Hogsmeade as a rendezvous point might make his aunt less inclined to be as venomous as she could be in private.
“Did he really?” Harry murmured, staring down at Draco in amazement.
“Please don’t be upset,” Harry said as they passed a jolly looking wizard handing out German wurst and paper cups of glühwein. “It was a natural omega reaction and completely my fault.”
Harry bristled, shoving his hands into his pockets and clenching his jaw.
‘Sheltered,’ Harry finished at the same time Ron suggested, ‘Clueless?’
you had a fight in you,” Smith announced, looking inordinately pleased. “I’ve watched you around school you know, for a few years now. You always have this ‘meek and mild’ shtick going on and whilst I guess that’s what pops Potter’s knot, I prefer ‘em a bit more feisty.”
Harry, Remus and Sirius all tensed and Draco could see that two of them had even drawn their wands.
“Oh come now Rodolphus,” a woman’s voice laughed nastily, it set Harry’s teeth on edge. “Are we really that surprised? You know how pathetically desperate omegas can get, the amount of abortions you’ve had to funnel money over to your squirrelly little mistr-“
“Their head certainly is,” Harry whispered to Draco with a wink as Madam Pomfrey let out a despairing noise and began casting another set of spells.
“Bloody hell,” Sirius grunted, “no wonder you were so desperate for another alpha.”
“Yeah,” Ron whispered, “waiting for it to kick in.”
Harry couldn’t help the yelp of alarm he let out before frantically scrubbing at his scalp as several May-bugs toppled onto the grass and buzzed unhappily at him.
“Fuck,” Harry grunted, realizing that his imaginary Draco was also still pregnant. A beautiful belly carrying Harry’s seed, ripening with the two of them. It looked so good to Harry’s alpha, the bigger Draco got, the more proof that Harry had filled him properly, bred him just right. Dream Draco was swollen and whimpering, waves of honeyed slick rolling down quivering thighs and pooling at their feet.
Draco stared at Harry, his eyes as big as dinner plates.
"Yes," Draco replied breathlessly, he could tell that Harry was being so gentle with him, so loving. He revelled in the sensations of Harry's warm, rough hands cupping his chest, the alpha's throbbing cock filling Draco's arse, moving carefully backwards and forwards in tiny increments. Draco's omega was purring happily at having been finally mounted by his alpha. He bit his lip and closed his eyes before rolling his own hips forwards, causing Harry's length to slip backwards, dragging hotly against his walls. Harry let out a strained noise as Draco grunted at the fizzles of ecstasy he could feel deep within him.
“Oh! You scared me,” the boy laughed, clutching a hand to his chest.
“What did you want to ask me?” Draco questioned, wondering if he should put the cardigan back on. He
“Oh my Hecate!” Olive gasped, pulling the curtain back and gaping at Draco. “I didn’t realize you were pregnant!”
“Ah, actually,” Harry grinned, rubbing the back of his neck, “she was an alpha too.”
“I also hope,” Harry sighed, shifting to draw closer towards Draco and causing the omega to naturally roll into the dip the alpha’s weight was creating, “that you know me well enough by now to realise I would never take advantage of you.”
he got pregnant, I think he feels like he can’t ask for things, like he’s not entitled to them or something.”
Harry nodded, starting to walk away before pausing and looking back. “There’s nothing wrong with being opportunistic Damien, you’re a Slytherin and that’s one of your strengths. But you should never resort to tearing other people down to try and build yourself up.”
“Yeah?” Harry frowned, wondering what that had to do with Draco’s mock exam results.
Draco inhaled sharply, looking up at Smith’s amused face. The other man had dark brown hair, a handsome Roman nose and thick brows.
“You don’t mind do you?” Damien asked, his thick black eyelashes fluttering, “only I always get like this when it would have been my heat. I’m on suppressants of course,” he added with a giggle. “But I’ve been told my pheromones can be quite strong.”
He and some of the others were seated in the Gaedere common room for their weekly joint study session. Neville had even lit the fire, despite it not even being that cold outside yet.
“No!” Draco gasped. “P-Please.”
“Absolutely,” Padma replied, “don’t you worry.”
“Ron, do you seriously think I’d tell you?” Harry replied as Ron smirked and sat back.
“Aren’t you tired?” Draco frowned, looking at the way Harry was carefully holding himself up so as to not let any weight fall on the omega.
“NO!”
Eventually, Harry recovered himself enough to sit up, peeling Draco stickily back enough to check that the omega was okay. Draco grinned lazily up at him, his ash grey eyes still somewhat glazed. An indeterminable amount of time later, both of them hissed as Harry’s knot finally softened enough to let his prick slip messily from Draco’s hole.
“I – I,” Draco stammered as Harry slowly turned around, his face in total shock.
Draco was still hiccoughing small giggles as Harry reached down to place wide hands around Draco’s waist, hoisting him back up into a more dignified position.
Harry vaguely recognised the boy, he was pretty sure he had helped the omega a month or so ago in one of the school corridors. But apart from that, Harry was certain he hadn’t interacted with this omega in any other capacity, definitely not one that would get him
“I meant with a-anyone,” Draco explained. “The other omegas in Slytherin didn’t like me very much.”
Draco passed Harry a faded looking photograph. Harry could tell it was a duplicate and the charm was going to run out soon but he still handled it as carefully as possible as Draco watched him intently.
nest is going to also house your alpha and your baby,” Harry smiled. “Surely that’s a plus point for it?”
A little while later, Draco found himself sitting on a deck chair in the shade, watching the other guests set up a game of magical croquet. He could smell Harry all around him, along with the people he felt safest with. Draco closed his eyes for a moment and let himself doze a little, full of cake and love.
be better. I wish Draco would come and ask me for stuff when he wants it but I think he’s still scared to.”
“We could argue about James Potter until the hippogriffs come home,” Remus murmured, “but you were telling me about the spell?”
“Sure thing,” Harry’s voice called out as Draco shut the door behind him.
It was the first time Draco had allowed Ron to enter his quarters, always having been a little nervous of the other man. However, after learning of how Ron had come to his aid in the hallway and even carried Draco all the way to the Hospital Wing, Draco had decided that the unusually tall beta didn’t pose any threat.
“Snow at Christmas,” Hermione grinned, squeezing his hand as they both looked up to the whirling swirls of white that were descending on the garden, “must be the first time in years.”
Harry hurried out of the dorm, turning left to head for the Morgana Suite when he saw Neville gesturing for him.
Harry shifted on the seat, he figured that was probably fair. Once Harry had made his circle of friends he didn’t give much thought to anyone else. He had occasionally heard himself described as ‘aloof’ and he knew he had inadvertently been a little too harsh in the past when rejecting offers, resulting in embarrassing floods of tears.
“Sorry, were you worried?” Harry asked, reaching up to rub the patch with his thumb. Draco went a little cross-eyed trying to look down at the movement.
“I want it to be roomier,” Draco announced, studying the nest foundations. “I couldn’t make it bigger without it falling down but with me b-being pregnant and you being so big I don’t think we’ll fit.”
did you say he could keep the baby?”
“Right,” Harry muttered darkly, pocketing the vials and wholeheartedly reconsidering his stance on letting Snape remain in their lives.
“Fuck, that’s it sweetheart,” Harry rasped, moving to gently nip at Draco’s left buttock, delighted to find more faint constellations of freckles. “Move for me, show me what you want.”
“H-Harry,” Draco began, suddenly remembering something, “were you in engagement talks with the Dawsons?”
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Harry muttered, reaching out to ruffle Draco’s hair, “Katie was onto something -  you do look pretty adorable in that outfit.”
“Are we doing lunch then or what?” Harry asked loudly, interrupting whatever Ginny had been going to say and sending her a warning glare.
Draco laughed, “I doubt I’m quite as b-big as they are, don’t thestrals normally birth twins?”
Harry took the opportunity to mouth at Draco’s dominant scent gland, scraping the skin with blunt teeth.
“Everyone
Occasionally, Harry would even receive letters from simpering parents of omegas near his age detailing just how wonderful their progenies were and how the families would be ever so delighted to welcome Harry at their estates in the south of France or skiing chalets in Switzerland.
“Okay,” Draco replied, seeming appeased by the explanation.
“Ugh,” Harry groaned, seeing the mess he was making of the floor. “I’m going to shower.”
“And when baby Severus comes I’m sure you’ll figure out babysitting,” his godfather concluded as Draco let out a loud laugh.
“It’s soup,” Draco replied quickly, lest the beta start thinking he had wet himself.
“Well, either Draco and I stay at school or he comes back with me to Padfoot’s,” Harry grimaced. ‘Padfoot’s Place’ was the name Sirius and Remus had given their London home. After selling his family’s ancestral townhouse, Sirius had gone and bought a large brick building near Temple. He had converted the second floor into a sprawling open plan loft whilst downstairs had turned into a garage for all his motorbikes and tools. Harry’s bedroom at Padfoot’s was pretty sweet, with exposed walls and a balcony overlooking the Thames.
Draco could feel the anger threatening to overtake him, bile was rising his throat and his cheeks were damp with sweat or tears, he wasn’t even sure. The hallway started to tip horribly to one side and Draco swayed to keep his balance, inadvertently swinging his wand arm.
Draco smiled as he felt gentle fingers trace the outline of his bond bite. He cracked open his eyes to see Harry standing beside him, gazing down at the younger man with a look of such raw and open affection, that it made Draco feel exposed in turn.
The omega made a small, pained sound that made Harry’s fingers twitch with discomfort.
Draco thought of Harry Potter, how such a charming and popular alpha must never feel alone. He thought of the beautiful red headed girl on Potter’s lap, of Venetia’s assertion that Potter was to be holidaying with her family.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, winking at Draco. “Figured I’d save your cardigans, I reckon custard would be tricky to get out of that type of fabric.”
Draco bent down to roll up a small ball of snow with his mittens before standing up decisively and throwing it at Harry’s back. His eyes widened in horror, however, as the snowball exploded against the back of Harry’s head instead, ice slipping down the alpha’s collar.
“It feels good,” Harry said breathlessly, carding his own fingers across Draco’s scalp. “Do you think you could try to suck it?”
“Actually, Poppy, would you mind giving us a moment?” Harry cleared his throat and stood up, making sure that his face was now clear.
“Have you told Remus and Sirius?” Hermione asked in a strange parallel of when they had first found out about the baby.
Harry’s mind conjured up Draco again, the blond boy sat on his bed, hugging his knees as Professor McGonagall had lectured him and Harry about what the next nine months would look like. Draco hadn’t said a word, chewing his lower pink lip until it turned red and sore. Harry had half wanted to reach out and stop him before it bled. Draco’s hair was so pale, whilst most of Fleur’s family were blonde too there was something almost unnatural about Draco’s complexion. His eyes as well were such a light shade of grey to be unusual. Draco’s skin made him look like he never saw the sun albeit apart from the odd freckle or mark.
Harry caught the Ogden’s bottle with ease as Seamus laughed tipsily and sent another whizzing through the air towards Ron.
“You’ve changed,” Ron said, laughing and shaking his head.
“My older sister’s just had her first baby,” the boy announced proudly, “Can you believe I’m an uncle already? Mandy just says that means I get to spoil ‘em rotten and buy them all sorts of things I shouldn’t.”
“Would it be weird?” Draco asked.
“Just for an assistant’s role,” Draco explained hurriedly, “I could do most of the training at home, only going into the apothecary a few times a month.”
“Severus is the boy’s godfather,” Professor McGonagall murmured in explanation.
“You’re so much warmer than I am,” Draco hissed, his nose wrinkling, “I think t-that’s why I couldn’t do it. My hands are cold no matter what I do.”
“Ooh, you’re going to start showing soon,” Katie told him excitedly. “Nick, that’s my boyfriend, keeps hinting we should start having children.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Harry smiled sheepishly. “I was just wondering about all the times you’ve accused me of being closed off. How many instances have I shut someone down who was trying to get close to me, when maybe they just wanted to be friends?”
Suddenly the branches behind Draco gave way and Smith let out a shout of surprise as the maze pulled back, creating a large gap. Draco felt himself topple backwards, only to be caught by strong arms and the smell of bonfire and cinnamon.
“Well, like Remus said,” Harry declared, stretching his neck lazily from side to side, “let’s leave the past in the past.”
acted that way?
“If you are using that extra half hour to wash then I think the guests would insist upon it,” Hermione huffed but looked amused. “Anyway, Sirius has just cracked open some bottles of aged whisky he found in Grimmauld Place’s wine cellar so I daresay everyone will be nicely distracted if you need even longer.”
Harry kissed him softly, the tenderness a juxtaposition to the reckless abandon of his previous fucking. “I just thought you might want to change position after coming.”
Apparently it was not a formal affair, so Draco didn’t want to dress up too much and bring attention to himself. In the end, he settled on a ruby red pinafore with a black, long sleeved turtleneck on underneath. The buckled straps of the pinafore could be adjusted to make extra room and it was from the maternity section at Amberly’s anyway. He also donned opaque stockings and polished black brogues along with a black velvet Alice band.
“Harry James Potter, you have been in an absolutely foul mood all morning,” Hermione trilled, crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes. Her usually bushy hair had been tamed into braids and she was wearing one of Ron’s oversized grey hoodies with her feet tucked up underneath her on the sofa.
“Please stay,” Draco repeated. “I know m-my omega would really like…the touch thing you said.”
Hermione and Ron had joined them at the wonderland’s entrance, along with a few other people that it turned out had booked tickets for the same day. Draco had been a little nervous to see that Ginny Weasley was also there, but she had simply smiled at them in greeting and commented on how Draco was much bigger than the last time she had seen him.
A moment later it creaked open and a small, sweating face looked up at Harry.
“You want my cock?” Harry asked, quirking a thick eyebrow as Draco felt the rigid weight press against his thigh, the wet head slipping on Draco’s skin.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked, getting in beside him. Harry was wearing green cheque pyjama bottoms but had chosen not to put on his usual t-shirt. Before sharing a bed with Draco, Harry had tended to prefer sleeping in boxers or nothing at all.
“Yeah, alright,” Harry nodded, knowing a bit of fresh air probably would do him good.
“Of course,” Draco nodded. Harry had actually been the one to find the apprenticeship posting, after Draco had mentioned he would love to one day get to work in that area. The idea of further education and even a job had seemed like such a ridiculous notion when living under Bellatrix’s roof. However, now, everything Draco wanted seemed so tantalisingly close.
The next morning Harry awoke with a raging headache, fumbling around on the bedside table for a hangover potion.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, gripping tightly onto the alpha’s wrist. “I – I’m scared.”
“Absolutely irresponsible,” a man was snarling, “I took you into my home, fed you, clothed you, and this is how you repay us? By attempting to bring further shame to our families?”
“Mr. Potter,” she announced, her lips coming together in a thin line. “I would appreciate you coming with me.”
As if knowing what Harry was thinking, Ron nodded thoughtfully, “I mean even if not Christmas why don’t you swing round for Boxing Day or something?”
Harry looked up, raising his eyebrows in confusion.
Draco laughed as Harry picked up their empty mugs of herbal tea and went to place them over in the kitchen. “I’m telling you, Remus says he had to turn the hose on them all once.”
“Yes,” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s hand and placing it over the cool silk nightgown. Draco frowned as they waited for about twenty seconds before Harry felt a definite thump against his palm.
“Ooh,” Harry teased, “both eh? You know I’m pretty sure Sirius won’t have a clue which colour goes with what.”
stomach has its limits.”
“A l-little harder,” Draco requested, the tips of his ears going red.
“I got to keep a part of her in my world,” Snape stated, his voice was taut with misery and came out as a sob.
Draco pursed his lips, whimpering as Harry climbed back on top of him, erection jutting into Draco’s abdomen whilst his lips fixed round a leaking nipple. Draco arched his back painfully as Harry fingers left his balls and began rubbing hard at his slick soaked crack, passing back and over his hole. Draco could feel the wrinkled furl opening and closing, fluttering with need. Harry was starting to suck so insistently Draco raised himself onto his elbows and stared down as the alpha released the swollen red bud, abused and sensitive from his touch.
He heard Draco’s shy voice in his mind, what he had said to Harry at Olive’s;
“Maybe,” Snape said quietly, “maybe you are a little more like Lily after all.”
“I find it difficult to get comfortable,” Draco admitted when Harry asked. “My back is aching a little.”
“You’ve been funny every since that meeting with Professor McGonagall,” Hermione stated and Harry could see the cogs in her brain whirring, trying to figure out the solution to a problem she didn’t even know about. Harry had decided not to tell anybody about what happened with Draco, if the boy was already having a shit time then spreading a rumour like this would be bound to make it worse.
Harry tried not to wince as he heard the headmistress let out a resigned sigh, coupled with Snape’s strangled groan.
“Here,” Katie smiled as she sat up on the bed next to Draco and interlocked her fingers with his, “squeeze me if it hurts.”
Only one more chapter to go.
“Damien,” Harry growled, “

century goblin economic reforms. Draco had been wearing silk black pyjamas which had served to make him look perhaps even paler than usual and Harry had been a little worried about the omega’s refusal to eat dinner that evening. Draco had assured him, however, that it was just a bout of pregnancy nausea.
,” Harry hissed, his eyes lighting up. “Show me sweetheart.”
“Ron,” Harry sighed, this was about the third time his friend had asked since Harry had told them of his plans the previous evening.
“Oh darling,” Harry sighed, glancing to the bed, “are you making a nest?”
“It’s okay,” Harry stated firmly, shrugging off his own large woollen coat and wrapping it around the omega. The coat was thick and warm and went down to Draco’s ankles, completely covering the very obvious stains. “We’ll find you something to change into okay? That was completely my fault.”
“Harry Potter what on
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry grunted, “you’re so tight. Feels amazing.”
Or perhaps it was just that Harry had been brought up in an incredibly forward thinking household with Sirius and Remus, given some of the shit he had been hearing from the rest of the school recently.
“Plus, you’re wearing a blue dress – just like you mum was!” Katie beamed.
“Maybe I can cook something for you when we get to Padfoot’s?” Harry offered.
Draco couldn’t help the way his lips twitched into a small smile at that.
Draco nodded shyly, “She was,”
“Never mind Harry, I know you and the rest of the Weasley boys have never paid much mind to fashion. You know, last Christmas I gave Percy a hand woven shirt made with silk from Serbian sugarplum silkworms? Well two months ago I find out the rotter went and washed it above forty degrees!”
Harry grinned and turned back towards the mirror when Draco’s head suddenly appeared behind him.
“Harry, there you are,” a tall red-headed man Draco now recognised as Ron Weasley sauntered up to the table before fixing his eyes on Draco. Ron was quickly followed by a couple of other Gaedere students, two of them Draco could smell were alphas.
“Do you think you might need to throw up?” Harry asked in concern, looking around for some sort of bucket.
“Let’s get out of this wind shall we?” Harry suggested, very aware that neither he nor Draco had a coat on. “How come you wanted to find me this morning?”
Draco had winced guiltily as he read that part.
Draco pulled a confused expression before realisation dawned across his features, along with a cherry red blush. “O-Oh, you…” Draco cleared his throat, glancing down at the soiled bed sheets.
Harry smiled before glancing over to the staff table. Hagrid sat down and gave him a jaunty wave, whilst Snape was eyeing him dubiously as if he highly suspected that Harry was ‘up to something’. Then again, Snape had pretty much looked at Harry that way for the past eleven years.
“I would never tell Draco who he could or couldn’t spend time with,” Harry replied frustratedly. “You’re his godfather and he loves you.”
Harry just about stopped himself from pulling a face as he recognised Professor Severus Snape. Advanced Potions was unfortunately a compulsory part of Harry’s mixed arts diploma course. Snape looked, characteristically, like he had swallowed a lemon. Harry wondered what he was meant to have done wrong now? Snape was always trying to pin shit on Harry, despite it normally being Seamus and Dean who were the perpetrators.
“The perils of being an omega I suppose,” Damien sighed, leaning back again the wall partition between compartments and fanning himself. The younger boy’s back was arching slightly with his hips tilted away from the wall and towards Harry. “We can’t all be big, strong alphas.”
For a moment, Draco revelled in the wondrous fact that he could say no, that he knew with certainty that Harry would listen and go sleep on the sofa. However, Draco didn’t want that at all so instead he smiled, bringing his hand up to Harry’s cheek and nodding.
“Thank you,” Draco said. “I’m s-sorry if that was forward of me.”
“Right,” Harry muttered, trying to think of ways to make the omega less nervous around him. The last time Harry had seen Draco in Madam Pomfrey’s office, the younger boy had practically hidden behind her swivel chair so as to avoid him.
“Little one, please tell me what’s wrong,” Harry pleaded. “Whatever it is, I’ll fix it.”
“Do you want to get some air?” Colum asked, turning to Harry. “I heard you mention you’ve got a headache and it’s wicked hot in here.”
lovely,” Harry murmured softly. “Despite how people have treated him, he’s still so willing to talk to everyone.”
“Draco? Hey, what’s wrong?” Harry hurried to push the covers off himself, reaching over to squeeze the younger boy’s shoulder.
“Oh yes,” Smith chuckled, obviously sensing Draco’s surprise. “Kind of hard not to notice something like that when you’re standing in a transparent glass sphere.”
“Not for omegas,” Draco replied miserably. “I c-can ask for full access when I’m twenty-one.”
“You look nice,” Harry said, giving Draco a questioning smile and hoping they could put the moment behind them.
Draco could only roll his eyes, he was far from the scheming mastermind they perceived him to be. However, his Slytherin side had to admit, he did feel a little gleeful every time he caught the curious and jealous expressions of people like Damien Tuppence and Venetia Dawson whenever they saw his scar.
“I’d like to do it,” Draco replied before they paid for their tickets and walked through a small round door into the globe. It was rather frightening at first, like being stuck in the middle of a blizzard. Draco couldn’t even see the exit anymore. He leaned into Harry who wrapped an arm around his shoulders comfortingly.
“Not whilst he’s pregnant,” Harry said wryly.
“Brilliant,” Harry laughed. “And you um, you call him ‘Dad’?”
There was a moment’s silence before Draco replied, “I’m trying to relieve some m-milk pressure.”
“No,” Draco replied quickly, looking worried. “You’re a good alpha. I’m sorry, I don’t think you’d ever do that.”
“Please don’t,” Harry replied, “this is natural. You’re pregnant and all of this is to be expected.” Harry quickly licked his lips, “How do you want me?”
“Oh fuck, sweetheart,” Harry gasped as Draco moved to suck and nip down Harry’s throat, slender fingers scrabbling at the alpha’s shirt buttons.
“I didn’t either,” Harry shook his head reassuringly, “honestly, the healer said it’s quite rare and tends to only occur with male omegas. But it’s good you’re feeling better now, you fell asleep pretty much after – um, after your bath.”
“Huh?” Draco cocked his head quizzically, it made Harry want to reach out and ruffle his hair.
“Yeah, maybe not,” Harry shrugged, tapping the cold aluminium of his beer can.
“Are you okay?” Draco asked, attempting to lever himself down from the sill and cross over to the older man.
“Yeah, I don’t think Draco falls into that category,” Harry replied, thinking of the true terror in the omega’s eyes, the way he had admitted everything immediately.
Draco gasped, looking wide-eyed at Harry. “I d-don’t think alphas do that,” he blurted out before visibly cringing.
Draco looked a little sad at this thought before he sighed and gave Harry a small shrug. “Bellatrix hasn’t sent m-my allowance this month. But I can still get the blouse!” Draco added happily, gesturing to the pink garment hanging up in the changing room.
“Oh good,” Sirius said brightly, “maybe someone finally dropped a house on her.”
Unbidden images of pale white skin and spit shined pink lips flashed through Harry’s mind as he thumped his head in self reprimand.  It was no good he decided, if he didn’t beat off now then he knew from experience he would probably spend the rest of the day on edge. It was Christmas Eve and Sirius and Remus had gone out for the day to visit some friends. Harry wanted to enjoy his precious time alone with Draco whilst he could, knowing that the next week would be a flurry of parties and events filled with other people.
“Of course little one,” Harry beamed, drawing Draco into a brief hug and whispering, “Happy Birthday love,” in his ear.
“Why aren’t you eating?” Harry’s voice sounded deep and concerned. Draco wasn’t sure if the Great Hall had fallen silent again or not. He cracked open his eyes and peered up through his blond fringe to see the alpha staring down at him curiously.
“I think I know h-how to get there,” Draco told them both, patting Harry in order to be gently put back down. Draco hurried over to the nearest wall of trees before touching one of the branches with his fingers. “Your friend Neville was doing the right thing!” Draco leaned in to the foliage before whispering.
“Oh gosh, that’s very thoughtful of you,” Remus smiled apologetically. “I’m so sorry, my name is Remus Lupin, I’m pleased to finally meet you.”
“I’m waiting for June fifth, it’s Draco’s birthday and also the day after his final NEWT. I’m organising a marriage ceremony. I’d invite you come but it’s friends and close family only,” Harry told Bellatrix, each word falling heavily as a blow to her crumbling conniving.
“You want to be bonded sooner?” Harry finished, looking at Draco in understanding. Draco nodded, pulling his hands away from Harry’s and fidgeting with the hem of his sweater.
“N-No,” Draco said, his lips moving by Harry’s nipple, tickling the hair there. “Don’t be sorry. You’re here now, I knew you’d come.”
^*^*^*^*^
“What’s the last thing you remember?” Harry asked kindly. Draco noticed that the alpha was looking rather haggard, with dark purple bruises under his eyes and his skin somewhat washed out.
“Thank you,” Draco called out after her as Felicity shot him a thumbs up and disappeared round the corner.
“Regardless,” Hermione said breezily as Draco knew his scent was starting to get notes of embarrassment, “you
“It’s okay Draco, I’m a beta and a friend of Harry’s. I think we should get you out of here hmm?” Draco turned round helplessly to see a dark skinned woman wearing Gaedere scholar robes smiling tightly at him. “My name’s Hermione,” she added.
“I suppose,” Draco grinned ruefully.
“It’s complicated,” Harry huffed, “but the baby’s mine okay?”
The door to the common room opened and a flux of tenth years filtered in. Harry waved lazily over to Ginny who returned the gesture with a rude one of her own. Harry laughed, evidently the red headed beta was still pissed off at Harry for making a mean spirited joke about the size of Dean’s dick after a locker room dispute.
“Have you ever seen Harry duel?” Hermione asked, arching her eyebrow and looking somewhat amused. “He’ll be fine. Besides, it’s just stupid, puffed up alphas posturing isn’t it? Even worse when they’re boys.”
“Are you…” Hermione tapped her lips thoughtfully, “are you planning on being in the child’s life?”
the mother are you? The Prophet didn’t say anything about bonding?”
^*^*^*^*^
“Draco,” Harry murmured, reaching out to hold either side of Draco’s waist as the younger man began to undulate, rotating his hips in small, maddening circles atop of Harry’s straining crotch. Draco was biting at his lip, tipping his head back. “My perfect mate,” Harry sighed happily, he threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair, gently pulling the strands free. Various bobby pins and a peach ribbon fell to the floor as Draco’s silver locks spread down across his shoulders. His hair was still intertwined with sprigs of flowers, giving him the appearance of some sort of ethereal forest nymph.
“And what about Draco?”Ron grimaced, “What the hell is
“I’m glad you like it,” Harry sighed with relief. “It will look great on you.”
“Yeah,” Ron nodded, “like ‘a floo call away’ close, not shacking up the same sodding house. What are people going to think?”
Snape inhaled sharply and Harry could see his bony fingers tensing as his hands clutched together. At some point, the beetles must have flown off, for the other man’s lap appeared bare again, clad in thick, almost dusty, robes.
Harry turned to look out the window, wincing a little at the pale light. The rain was coming down in heavy sheets and he could see that the grounds were already becoming waterlogged, great muddy puddles bubbling up on the grass.
“I,” Draco looked up at a still frowning Harry, “I’m meant to be in History of Magic.”
“He’s lone-“ Harry began but Hermione interrupted.
“Sure,” Harry replied, “but I have to get back soon okay?”
“Oh Merlin,” Harry sighed, “Ten minutes old and she already thinks her dad’s uncool.”
“Draco!” Harry shouted, holding the omega’s trembling body tightly before jerking his head up to stare dangerously at Smith. “
“But,” Ron interjected, “they don’t know
“Harry?” Draco asked, opening his eyes to see the alpha standing over him with a strained smile.
were in Seventh Year.”
“A-Alpha!” Draco cried as his spine bowed and trembled, little spurts of white droplets splattering from his pink cock across the bottom of his bump.
“Well, Draco’s pregnancy should last about nine to ten months,” Harry replied, trying to avoid their eyes and focus on a cloud shaped stain on the tapestry of Morgana stirring her cauldron. “He’s going to remain at school so he can complete his final year and also he’ll need me nearby to help feed magical energy to the baby.”
“Draco,” Snape began in a voice far kinder than Harry had ever heard it directed at him or his peers. “Calm down and explain. What did Potter do to you?”
“Why are you crying sweetheart?” Harry sighed, “Are you upset with me?”
“How about I keep Fred and George away from Draco for an hour?” Ron offered as Hermione raised her eyebrows, clearly disbelieving that this feat could be accomplished. Draco had heard about Ron’s unruly twin brothers, they ran a joke shop on Diagon Alley and were worryingly
“I didn’t order it,” Draco explained.
“How many of you are in there?” Hermione asked.
“Make it two and I’ll whip up a walnut free batch just for you,” Harry grinned before he and Ron shook hands.
“Is –is it okay to use when I’m pregnant?” Draco asked, looking at the small blue tub that Katie passed her friend. Padma unscrewed the lid and the scent of camomile and honey wafted across.
Harry stared silently down at Draco’s sleeping form. The omega was still unconscious, although Madam Pomfrey had said that was nothing to worry about as she had given him an I.V. of some kind of modified calming draught in order to allow her to complete the necessary scans.
“I do,” Olive nodded in understanding, “But he called my grandfather “mummy”. I think it just depends on what the family decide. I mean it doesn’t matter too much does it? I’m sure when the time comes you and Draco can figure out what you’d like to be called.”
“This is an apprenticeship application,” Severus frowned curiously down at the papers, flicking through them with the tip of his wand. “For Potions?”
“Right,” Sirius huffed, folding his arms across his chest, “well it’s a bloody good thing you got your looks from her. Cissy was a stunner, even if she was a little too aware of it sometimes.”
Hermione excused herself to go to the loo a little while later as Ron sent Harry a shifty look.
“You’re mine, Draco,” Harry growled, feeling instinct taking control of his limbs.
“Good, I think,” Harry replied, “we’re on to the second outfit.”
“Merlin’s balls Harry, you rob the Louvre or something?” Sirius guffawed as Harry rolled his eyes. “Are we on the run from Interpol now?”
Harry’s eyes widened as he felt little jets of come spurt past his fingers, how was Draco this responsive? Harry had barely touched him.
“Like I said,” Sirius huffed, “it’s good you inherited Cissy’s looks and not his.”
Draco wasn’t saying anything, just fidgeting with a few loose pebbles on the ground beside him. Harry sat down next to him, trying to shield the younger boy from the biting wind.
“I don’t know,” Draco frowned, “maybe if I…” he swung his body round so he was sitting upright, his legs dangling over the side of the bed. “You could sit in front of m-me, if you get that chair?”
“I just think you’re very attractive,” Damien smiled, biting his lip and looking up at Harry.
“Yeah?” Harry grinned as Draco pulled his head back so the tips of their noses were lightly touching, Draco’s cold against Harry’s warmth. “You just don’t want to miss out on one of the prize presents right?”
“Fuck, Draco is that –“ Harry began to ask, sounding shocked when suddenly there was a loud rapping knock on the outside of the snow globe.
Draco’s labour lasted a gruelling sixteen hours and by the end, Harry’s hand was blossoming with bruises from the omega’s surprisingly tight and relentless grip. As he had promised, Harry didn’t leave Draco’s side, stroking his back and giving him words of encouragement and support as Healer Sweetbridge and Madam Pomfrey fussed about underneath the towel.
“Hmm,” Harry hummed thoughtfully, glancing back at the attempted nest. “Well, what’s the purpose of building a nest for an omega?”
“You want to get married someday Harry,” Hermione continued quietly, “you’ll meet someone and
“It’s not,” Harry stated firmly. The alpha reached out his hand and settled it across Draco’s hip bone. Draco could feel a hot flush blossom across his chest. Thankfully, his new nightshirt was high necked and went down to his ankles.
“You alright?” Harry asked. “Not too hot or cold?”
Draco gasped as Harry crowded him further, gently lowering them both to the ground. “You know, we haven’t made a snow angel yet,” Harry told him, his voice quiet as Draco became acutely aware of quite how close the alpha was, all the points they were pressed against each other.
“Courgette, Harry,” Sirius stated sombrely, “who the
“Everything’s fine sweetheart,” Harry said firmly, making sure that Draco heard and understood him. “The baby is okay, it’s just you are going to feel a little rotten until we can get this fever down.”
“N-No,” Draco whined in protest as Harry drew back and began to reposition them. Harry paused, rubbing his fingertips lightly across Draco’s wet perineum.
“You must have thought you were so clever,” Iona sneered, moving quickly to comfort the female omega. “Whilst poor Venetia was doing everything the proper way like a respectable omega, you had already crawled into Potter’s bed and sealed the deal for yourself.”
The woman made an aggrieved noise before there was a shuffling of fabric, “Luckily, Draco, it doesn’t matter what you want. What exactly are you hoping for here? To waltz off into the sunset with your alpha lover?”
alpha.
After dimming the candles, Draco let his hand slip up and down his side. He was enjoying the sensory experience of the nest and the smooth silk of his nightgown felt chilled and slippery in comparison. He bit his lip as his hand rested on his hip bone before gliding forwards into the dip of his groin, very lightly brushing his soft cock.
“Fuck, Draco. You want my cock baby? You want your alpha’s cock?” Harry asked quickly, his words almost a slur with excitement and approval. “It’ll be so good sweetheart, I promise I’ll make you feel good. I’d never hurt you Draco, I love you.”
Draco laughed, a little louder than he had meant to as he clapped a hand over his mouth a second later and glanced sheepishly at Harry. The other man was grinning and looking pleased.
“H-Harry?” Draco called out nervously, sure that the alpha must right on the other side. However, there was no answer as Draco looked anxiously around the grove. The way they had come from was also gone now and there was only one path leading out. Draco glanced back at where he had last seen Harry before quickly hurrying down it.
“Thanks,” Harry nodded, “and thank Merlin for external examiners eh? Bumped that mark up to an A”
It had been two weeks since Draco had been taken to the Hospital Wing and so far, along with the help of Severus’ home brewed scent suppressors, Draco had managed to keep his ‘condition’ away from prying noses. Unfortunately, it looked like the dab-on tinctures had reached their limit and the whispers had already started up from that morning.
Harry helped Draco to turn on the taps, along with one specially installed for bubble bath, when there was a tentative knock on the door. Harry left Draco in the bathroom, happily swishing the growing bubbles with his fingers whilst Harry tucked himself back into his trousers and gingerly cracked open the bedroom door.
“Did you now?” Harry murmured, playfully tipping Draco forwards as if to pin him to the ground. Draco laughed as he tried to bat his hands back to hit any exposed part of the alpha. “Are you
“Your father’s an omega?” Harry asked in interest. “Audrey‘s never mentioned,”
“Is...” Draco’s nose wrinkled up, “is it not normal?”
“Not yet,” Draco shrugged, the truth was he was hoping to get some more things with Harry’s scent on them before trying to construct somewhere for the later stages of his pregnancy. Draco had never properly nested before and being rather friendless back in Slytherin meant he had missed out on the shared omega experiences of constructing nests together.
I cannot believe this has kudos already, I’m super appreciative and grateful for the kind support but y’all are mad ballsy leaving kudos on a wip, I mean what if we get to chapter five and I dramatically kill off Harry in a toileting accident and have Draco begin a torrid but fated love affair with Filch?
“Well you’ll see for yourself won’t you?” Harry snapped, rolling his eyes as Ron made a teasing sound in response.
“Still,” Harry said, “perhaps I should shave in order to spare your smooth skin in future.”
“I s-should really have sleeves as an omega,” Draco murmured, glancing back at the mirror and running his own fingers up his pale arms. He turned back to Harry with a gleam in his eyes, “But I think my mother might have been quite daring for her time!”
“You wanted to help Hari,” Pansy snaps, “don’t put yourself down.” Hermione looks at her with wide eyes before nodding. Pansy leans forward and touches one of Hermione’s curls.
“This is wonderful, Hari!” She cries in awe, running her fingers along the spines of a few books.
“Goodnight, Draco,” Hari replies.
Hermione opens her mouth to retort but ends up just glaring. Hari has a point. The muggle clothes make her stand out more than the upscale robes will.
“What’s going on?” Hari asks, peeking out the window. Hermione looks, too, and goes pale.
“Okay,” Hermione stands, “almost done. Get to Muggle Studies, you guys.” She and Hari migrate to the small table set up a little ways away with two books on it. They set out their parchment and get to work, scratching down information as they go. In the short amount of time it takes Draco to read the important bits of the chapter, they’ve gotten enough information that the two short essays they need to write tomorrow will be easy to get through. She and Hari wander back over and take their seats, filing the work away into their bags as Draco winds down.
The students diligently take notes and ask questions as needed. By the end of the hour, they’ve gotten all that they can out of the lecture and the rest is up to them to learn. Professor Snape assigns a six inch essay on the uses of Dragon’s Blood in Healing potions. Beau leaps to the floor and makes to follow the students out, but Professor Snape catches him easily.
“Draco practically thinks you hung the moon,” Daphne interrupts. “If you asked him to, he’d find a way to buy you all the stars in the sky.”
They discuss the ins and outs of the evidence provided until the bell chimes to call them back. Before letting him split off, each friend places their hand on Hari’s shoulder and whispers ‘good luck’ to him.
The last portion of the afternoon is someone in the Muggle Artifacts department speaking about cars. He hears Draco’s voice in the back of his mind.
“Hey, you’re back!” Draco chirps. Hari thinks about what Daphne had said about initiating and grins at Draco.
It doesn’t pass.
, or do you admit to having made all this up?”
“Lord Potter,” Fudge turns to face him. Hari stares dispassionately. “I’m sorry, but I cannot justify withdrawing the Dementors.”
“What’s wrong?”
Draco says, “whatever you need, I’ll do what I can to help.”
“Dray, just give me the black, slim-fit closed-to-open robes. I’ll wear black slacks underneath,” Hari sighs. The goblins had warned him he would be expected to speak at the meeting. He may as well look the part.
“Stay safe,” Tonks waves and darts off after her partner, tripping over her own feet at least twice over the short distance.
“Oh,” she lifts it to study the charm on the end, “it’s beautiful, thank you.”
“Hello, Mango,” Hari whispers. The kneazle’s purrs grow immensely as Hari pets him. Draco reaches out and strokes along its back as well.
“Us,” Draco replies simply. “We’re talking about us. Mostly,” Draco’s cheeks go a little pink, “because I really like you. Romantically.”
Yesterday, there had been a long conversation about whether or not it would be safe for Hari to go to Hogsmeade at all. But they came to the understanding that Hari is allowed to use magic outside of school now. With his self-defense classes, he’s learned enough protective spells that he can, at the very least, defend himself until help arrives. That, and Luna said they wouldn’t have anything to worry about.
“To start? He’s unnecessary,” Hari replies bluntly. “He frightens students, takes pride in terrifying them with talk of corporeal punishment before detentions, and overall hates children.”
“I have not,” Lord Nott smiles slightly at Hermione, “Pleased to meet you.”
“House elves can also shop for their families,” Daphne adds, “so if you need new robes or anything, Critter can get it for you.”
“Oh, come on, you know you’re a drama queen.”
Later, he promises himself, he’ll ask Draco why he didn’t like Hermione’s necklace. For now, he laces his fingers through Draco’s and whisks them back to Potter Manor to spend the rest of the day playing with the kneazles and flying with the hippogriffs.
“If it isn’t indicated on this letter,” Hari taps the small pile, “then it will be on the ones coming in. If you could search those the same way, that would save you time. And ensure we’ve gotten it all correct.”
“Switch,” Draco holds out the book he’s just bought.
“One who is faithful, keep my secret, I give you the location: 12 Grimmauld Place. So mote it be.” Hermione’s hand comes down over his mouth quickly, her eyes boring into his.
“I can’t just—“
“I’ll see to it,” Hari promises. A minute later, they’re gathered in Hermione’s living room, Hermione staring at them in shock.
“Of course,” Hari smiles over at him, “maybe you’d like one of the other studies to work in?”
Narcissa’s testimony, though, seals the deal.
“You, too, Heir Longbottom,” Hermione smiles. Hari hides a grimace—Narcissa would have a field day with that phrasing. She could have phrased that practically any other way.
“Sorry.”
“What are you looking for, Lord Potter?” The worker asks.
“Oh, that’s alright, what is it?” Hari turns to face the witch, letting his face go neutral.
Pansy gives him one of the planners he’d mentioned wanting. Hari stares at it in awe for a long moment before declaring that he’s putting in every major event he can think of as soon as he wakes up tomorrow.
“Man…”
Professor Snape chuckles, “Slytherin, through and through.” He opens the door for Hari. “Here we are.”
“Not yet,” Hari says and kneels down to Critter’s level. “I would love to, but I’ve still got to go to school for most of the year. But I can promise I’ll visit more often.”
“That’s exactly it! I thought it might be a good idea to put together a few more personas, but then decided four was enough.”
“Alright, then, let’s perform the Fidelius,” Sirius comes down the stairs and grins at Hari, “I’ve always wanted to pull one over on Dumbledore.”
Lucius is called down next. He explains the rage he felt at the idea that a wix child could ever be treated like that and how he couldn’t initially comprehend that it had been caused on purpose.
Remus studies him for a long moment and seems almost frightened at what he sees, but he nods and lets Hari return to his friends.
They appear in the Ministry and Hari looks at Hermione.
“Hari! You got the class added!” Pansy practically leaps on him.
“I want her not to seem like someone who’s being bullied,” Hari corrects, “if that means she’s in our group, then so be it.”
he reminds himself and ignores the little voice that reminds him he still has much to learn, as well.
“Okay, you were right,” Draco falls into step beside Hari, “that was terribly boring. Was it just me, or did that entire first two and a half hours do nothing whether or not it passed?”
“He doesn’t give me any attention,” Draco practically shrieks, “it’s absolutely his fault.”
“He made me promise I’d teach you,” Hari says, “I think he misses having a big family to take care of.”
Fudge is pale as a ghost, “I’ll have the Dementors removed within the hour,” he promises.
Draco pouts, but admits, “I guess you have a point.”
“There will be a Fall Festival Ball before we return to school,” Theo tells them, “My family is hosting this year and we will be sending invitations soon. Shall I tell my father to include Miss Granger on yours?”
“I will,” Hari promises. “The charm I’d like to use will take the location of your home from the minds of everyone who knows it. I would be the only one able to give the information out. Not even you or your husband could tell someone. The wizard wouldn’t be able to find Hermione here with it.”
“You really think she is?” Blaise asks softly.
Ajay reminds himself,
“I have got to remember to save room for that.”
Hari reaches for Draco’s hand, blushing a little, despite there being no reason to.
“Critter is doing!”
“Heir Nott,” Hari smiles at him, “do call me Hari.”
“Are there any surprises we should be ready for this afternoon?” Blaise teases before they split up.
Hari makes eye contact with Draco and Daphne nudges him, “go ahead.” She steps back a single step and smiles reassuringly. Hari tilts his head to invite Draco over. Draco grins and leads Hermione back. Hari shifts so he’s nearly facing the dance floor and bends his arms, fingertips lightly brushing. Draco’s eyes shoot between Hari and Daphne and his smile softens. His eyes settle warmly on Hari.
They leave an hour and a half later with shrunken packages filled with, according to Hermione, horrifying amounts of clothes.
“You love cats,” Hari replies, lips turning up again, “almost as much as you love chocolate.”
The others groan.
“Can you snap, Hari?” Draco turns to Hari. Hari mimics the snap Draco had done, but Draco shakes his head. “It’s a little faster.” He demonstrates again and this time, Hari manages to do it. “That’s how Critter wants you to call for him.”
“Okay,” Hermione nods, “what does that have to do with why you’re here?”
“Snap is appropriate way to call,” Critter tells him. “Especially with guests.” Hari glances to Draco.
“I want you to do your homework.”
“Just tell them they’ll never have to pay for anything ever again,” Blaise suggests. “That’ll probably help it go over better.”
have to fight down the urge to brush them aside.
“Lucky we just finished getting that set up,” Hari grins.
“Eh,” Draco wraps an arm around Hari, “not really. It would’ve benefitted you in the long run, proving you’re not afraid to follow through on your threats, but this works, too. Fudge obviously fears you enough to assume you’ll follow through without needing confirmation.”
“Will we not be having doubles periods anymore?”
“I don’t see them yet,” Draco says, “let’s go get our compartment before someone else takes it.”
“Exactly,” Draco nods sharply, “we’re wizards. We live in the wix world. No need to go out there.”
“I can hear you!” Draco yells. Hari walks away calmly. Draco will only come around if he doesn’t get the attention he’s seeking… Hari thinks. “Hari? Hari! Hari, don’t leave me!” There’s a pause, then a dramatic gasp. “You took my wand! Give that back, I need it.”
Hari nods, remembering the few times he’s taken it.
“We have a whole hour to eat as much dessert as we want,” Draco chatters happily.
“Well, I’m glad you like them so much,” Hari smiles then, cruel and uncaring, “You’ll be seeing a lot of the Dementors from your cell.” He steps to the floo, grabbing a pinch of powder. Fudge grabs Hari’s arm. “You will unhand me or I will add assault to the list.” Fudge drops him like he’d been burned.
“Wait, you don’t already know he likes you?” Daphne asks, shocked.
“Most definitely,” Draco agrees with vehemence. “The henna looks spectacular on your skin tone.”
“Could I see just one of them, then?” Critter opens the door to the first guest room and lets Hari see a suite of rooms with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sitting room, and a small dining area.
“Surely the meeting will not take that long,” Lucius says, but his face betrays him. There is every possibility that the meeting will take several hours. Hari snaps his fingers twice and Critter appears, eager to please.
“That is being Manja, Master Hari. Manja is being with the Potterses inside the Manor and at Godric’s Hollow.” Hari’s eyes go wide and he scoops the cat up, marveling at Critter's garbling of the name.
“Miss Umbridge, have you bothered to read Newt Scamander’s
Hari decides,
“Why choose to dance with me? If you asked Blaise, no one would question it, he’s danced with almost everyone in here. If you asked Theo, no one would dare go against him in his own Manor. So why me?”
Draco smiles at Hari and presses a light kiss to his lips, “goodnight, Hari.”
“Master Hari should learn to snap for Critter,” Critter admonishes.
“It was,” Hari sighs, leaning his head into the crook of Draco’s neck. “But I was mostly irritated I couldn’t see all of you.” Hari pouts, “why do you and Pansy have to be on the left?”
“And someone has to tell me how to take her under my protection,” Hari adds.
“No, it wasn’t,” Hari admits, “Hermione wants to be involved in the government. Coming to sessions will be beneficial for that.”
“Mr. Lupin is highly qualified,” Professor Flitwick assures Hari.
“Oh, Merlin,” Hari looks out the window, “so these things are checking the train for him? Are they even allowed to do that?”
“They can,” Pansy whispers, “that’s why this is so bad.”
“You look incredible,” Hari says simply. Words, for whatever reason, seem to not be working at the moment.
“Actually, yes,” Hari picks up a stack of paper and passes it around. It has the new class schedules laid out. “We designed the new schedules to allow for the new mandatory classes, as well as give students the opportunity to take more electives. This, however, does not add to your workday,” Hari promises, “in fact, it will likely lessen it.” Because there’s more classes per day, the classes themselves are shorter. The teachers, however, still have the same number of classes to teach.
“I’ll come tell them with you,” Hari offers. “They’re collecting you from the Leakey—or do you have your floo connected?”
“It’s not an issue to worry about this year,” Professor Snape reminds him. “Have you decided whether to go to the next Wizengamot session or not?”
“How do you know all this?” Daphne asks, revealing that it’s not just common knowledge. Draco blushes slightly.
“My apologies, Lord Potter,” he bows, “for not being able to stop him.”
“Oh, you poor dear,” Narcissa reaches out for Hermione, “come, we’ll go back to the Manor and heal you right up.” With that, she apparates away.
“We’re going to your Manor tomorrow?” Draco asks.
“Yeah, well, there’s people out there who don’t,” Hari mutters, Dumbledore flashing through his mind.
“Alright, then,” Hari sighs, “You all are clear to go. Critter, please call the crups.”
They finish their ice cream quickly and step outside, hurrying back to the floo.
“The day after tomorrow,” Hari smiles, “hence why we’re here today. Oh,” he turns to Draco, “I forgot to ask, but did your father register my port-key into the Ministry?”
This is what he waited for.
“I know,” Professor Snape sighs, “but it has created arguments and it would be best if someone of the hierarchy was there to lay it out plainly.” There’s a pause, “you’ve done well today. Is that what you’re like in court?” He glances down at Hari, interested.
“If you messed up my hair, I will hate you for real,” Draco warns, raising a hand to finger the bangs just touching his eyebrow.
“That’s one of the most incredible things anyone’s ever done for me,” Hari tells her, “thank you. Thank you so much.” He leans back and laughs, a little watery, “I will definitely come to you with questions. If you’ve studied as much as I think you have, you’re practically an expert.”
“I’m glad,” Hari says with a bright smile and he settles back into Draco’s arms. “What will you name him?”
“You’re under my protection and part of my House, ‘Mione,” he reminds her, “That means I pay.”
“I didn’t expect…” Draco trails off, then grins and swoops down to catch Hari’s lips in a kiss. “You’re wonderful,” he whispers over Hari’s mouth. Hari smiles at the words. They get ready to sleep and snuggle into the center of the large bed. They cuddle up next to each other, Hari wrapped firmly in Draco’s arms, and the promise of Professor Snape working on their troubles allowing him to relax into a deep sleep.
“It’s exactly right,” Hari assures her.
“I have. Critter, Draco wants to meet Mango, could he?”
“They made a lot of changes,” a Gryffindor says.
“And you shouldn’t,” Professor Snape sweeps into the room. “The new Headmaster designed the schedule to take both professors and students into consideration.”
“You got it,” Hari agrees and sneaks a little peck on the lips from Draco. He hurries off to the Headmaster’s office, calling out the new password—Cobra. He’s going with snake breeds as his theme, though he feels like it’s not very creative.
Blaise snorts inelegantly, “he’s going to come see you to argue.”
He strides out and makes it to the meeting room just before it begins. Lucius gives him a somewhat proud look, probably assuming Hari had been playing mind games.
“Like, go to him for cuddles?”
“The Ministry makes no distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples in marriage,” Draco informs him, “children are a little more complicated and I don’t know all the details, but I did a little research, anticipating this question.
“With permission from the Headmaster, I suppose,” Hermione nods. Hari pales and his eyes flash almost frantically to her.
“Kissing later, Dray, homework first,” he mumbles, pushing his boyfriend back.
“Of course,” Hari agrees, “If you bring your homework, you’re more than welcome to join us.”
“I yelled at the conductor to start the train again and he did,” Hari grumbles. “But I’m going to need to contact the Minister. He’s the only one able to authorize this, right?”
“I’m jealous,” Draco huffs, then holds his arms out. “I know today was hard for you.” Hari lets himself be pulled onto Draco’s lap and cuddled.
“Yes, Hari?”
“Exactly,” Hari nods. “For Slytherin, the dorms alternate which side of the hall you’re on each year. Instead, we would have a dorm on each side of the hall for each year, one for scions and one for typical peers. The only occasion I see this as being inappropriate is if there is only one student in either category in a year. That is an isolation I do not anticipate being enjoyable.”
“Such as how Lucius is using it now,” Hari smirks. Blaise, Daphne, and Pansy all start laughing.
“It definitely is,” Draco agrees. There’s a slight pause, then, “why ask me?”
“Want to contact that solicitor?” Draco smirks at him.
“They all have bedrooms and there’s a guest room and Hermione has her own bathroom. There’s a sitting room, dining room, kitchen, and a study. But there’s nothing more than that. They have an average sized yard out back.”
Hari rolls his eyes at the jab, but does as instructed. When he comes back out, the outfit before him is, as Draco promised, a tasteful combination of red and green. The suit is a smooth Slytherin green with a white shirt and muted red tie and pocket square. Offset with brown shoes, it somehow doesn’t look like Christmas. The robes are a rich navy so dark it’s practically black.
There’s several items he doesn’t really care about, but the very first is one that reads ‘Goblin Announcement of Charges Filed’. He smiles slightly at that and listens absently to Dumbledore prattle on about who would be speaking and how the session would be structured. Which is to say, he offers a list of names and rambles about nothing for a half hour. Finally, they’re allowed to leave.
“I want to date you, Hari,” Draco tells him. “I want us to go to Diagon together and Hogsmeade. I want to buy you little things just because I can and I want to and I want to cuddle with you all the time, even in public, and have no one ready to rebuke me.” Draco smirks a little self-deprecatingly. “And I want those girls who think they can have you to back off. I want to not be feeling crazy when I want to yank their arms off you. I want to be allowed to push them off you without anyone looking at me crazy. And I want to not feel jealous of every little thing someone else does around you. I want you.”
“The problem, Lord Flint, is that that leaves our current seventh years out of the loop, as they would not be able to take it after graduation.”
“We’re dating,” Draco announces with a beaming smile. Hari giggles and tucks himself under Draco’s chin, a little embarrassed. “We have been since the night of the Summer Ball.”
“They’re getting me from the Leakey,” Hermione confirms. Hari looks to Draco.
“Bleeding heart,” Draco huffs, but his lips curl up. Hari leans into his side.
“I have,” Hermione agrees, “he is a wonderful cousin.”
“What about my home?” Hermione asks fearfully. “Dumbledore knows I’m close to all of you, what if he goes for my parents?” Although Hari knows Sirius can be insensitive and immature at times, he’s not surprised when his godfather manages to pull himself together to behave as an adult for this.
“Is Master Hari liking his room?” Critter eyes him nervously, “Critter changed it for Master Hari. Master Hari is being more like Lady Lily than Lord James.”
“Would you allow me to order for you?” Draco asks before Hari can make a decision. Hari smiles and nods, setting his menu down. Draco sets his own menu down, apparently having already decided. A server makes their way over and smiles politely at them, seeming unsure about their ability to pay. Well, unsure until their eyes take in the glint of their rings. Then their eyes turn greedy.
The others bid them goodnight as well and separate into their own Family Suites. Hari opens his door and watches Draco do the same. They step in simultaneously, knowing from the first few nights at school that if they don’t, they’ll both stand there, waiting for the other to go in.
“Yes, Critter,” he turns in a slow circle to take in the whole hall, “I thought I’d come visit while I had the chance.”
Blaise slowly sits up properly and eyes the two of them warily. “Yes,” he says, “it is. I can sleep. But it’s only an extra hour of sleep.” He pauses for a moment, “Wait! It’s only Thursday?!”
“I will have him removed, then. I suppose if you’re bored, you wouldn’t mind me requesting a bit of a menu change?” The elves’ eyes grow brighter once more. “We have a lot of different ethnicities here at Hogwarts and I’d like to reflect that in the foods we serve. I’ll provide a list of suggested dishes for each meal, but if you know more, or a student comes to me with a suggestion, it may grow.”
Hari does know. Hari knows because they’re the only pet Draco has ever imagined himself getting. He also knows that a large part of the reason Draco likes cats is because if they’re big enough, they’ll chase the peacocks, and maybe even nab one here and there. Draco has told him this before.
“I’m pretty certain she’s a distant cousin of mine,” Draco says, tilting his head to study her retreating form. “I’ll have to go through the genealogy books later, just to check.” Hari nods. They start walking back to the dungeons.
“You’re welcome,” Hari smirks. The group laughs.
“I would suggest a scion of a House, someone raised with our culture, but who can be sensitive to muggleborn’s difficulty transitioning.”
publishing those?”
“See that you do,” Hari glares, “or I’ll make good on my promise.” Hari strides from the room, not looking back to see if Fudge gets started on his assigned task, just returning to the Great Hall to eat some good food.
“But what about cooking?”
“And let them know not to worry about money,” Hari adds as she starts to dart off. She gives him an odd look, but nods and carries on.
“Okay, so they’re bad. Why are they here?”
“So,” Draco asks, “when will you be moving in?” Hari glares at him.
“Good choice,” Blaise comes back over from wandering through the fabrics, “Mother made the mistake once of only having bright colors on hand and had to have something pre-made sent to the Villa for an event.” He shudders, “it was hideous, but we altered it enough that no one could tell for one night.”
“Okay,” Daphne sighs once they’re through with potions, “that’s everything for this year.”
“How long do kneazles live?”
“Are there any other changes?” Professor Sinistra grumbles.
“Exactly,” Hari spins his cup in his hands. “So, I wanted to make her a space in my Manor before taking her there. Kind of show her I’ve already accepted her in.”
Hari nods, “alright. I’d like to start by looking into firing Argus Filch. I want to add the Wizarding Culture class back as a required class for first years and find some way to back-track and teach the upper years, as well. I also think we need a new teacher and curriculum for History of Magic. It would also be beneficial to teach something of government and politics, even for students not in power, since everyone should understand their government.” There’s nods around the room, so he continues, “I would also like to evaluate whether or not Divination is a class to be taught here.” Hari holds up a hand before anyone can argue, “I realize that it’s value lies in identifying true Seers, however, it is relatively useless to other students. There are other classes I would like to look into adding, ones that were originally part of the Hogwart’s curriculum that have since been removed; the full list is in your files.”
“It probably gets old living as a rat,” Pansy sneers. “And disgusting.” They all shudder at the idea of the things he’d probably had to do as a rat to survive.
“We should,” Hari agrees breathlessly.
“May I join you at the room without a door tomorrow? I should like to have a look inside,” she tells them.
“If you’re sure, Dray,” Hari hums and nuzzles his cheek into Draco’s shoulder. “I’m tired.”
“Ah, Lord Potter,” Professor Flitwick is practically standing on his chair. “Just the person to help us.”
“Exactly.” Daphne strides from the room and makes her way to the Jungle Room. She knocks in the assigned pattern to let Ajay know she’s safe and coming in, then opens the door. “Ajay?”
“I tell you guys all the time, he’s going to rule the world,” Pansy laughs.
I got somewhere around two hundred comments in the period of time I've been gone, so I'm not even going to try to reply to everyone individually. I want to thank everyone for their kind words about the fic. I'm really glad everyone likes it as much as you do. And to everyone who offered their support while I was struggling, thank you so, so very much. It really means so much to me and helped me push through that much quicker.
“Pettigrew was in Hogsmeade,” Hari says quickly, “we ran into him and had to wait for the Aurors to come get him.”
“It’s not usually easy to catch unless you talk frequently with that person,” Draco explains, “so, Professor Flitwick probably only ever sees her in passing. He might think she’s slightly odd, but we’re wix. Odd is kind of expected. Plus, she wouldn’t be putting what we discussed with her into her essays.”
“That,” Draco beams, but still sounds a little bitter, “and because she’s been researching and studying his culture for him.”
“That is awfully convenient, Hari.”
“For Lord Potter?” Tonks’ eyes glint with mirth. “Anytime. Say, you and I are related, you know?”
“True,” Draco nods, “I can see how it would be jarring and hard to accept. It’s a lot, after all.”
it. He’s strong in a way Draco doesn’t know if he’ll ever be. And they’ve barely started Hari’s self-defense training.
“Despite your insincerity, Miss Umbridge, I accept your apology. I hope our next meeting will be more friendly.” He steps past her and strides over to where he sees Daphne. She bows and turns to walk with him, keeping time easily.
They work hard for a full hour, managing to get through the three short essays before deciding it’s time for a break.
“So you consolidate your work,” Hermione says understandingly. “That makes sense. Although, maybe it would be better in the long run to change the schools?”
“I’ll come with him. We can bring the others, too,” Draco grins, “mount a real rescue mission.”
“Thank you,” Hari smirks again, just because he can, then checks the time and sighs. “Guys, lunch is about over.”
“Absolutely hectic,” Hari replies. They smirk at each other and continue on their ways, Hari, to his seat, and Blaise back to his mother’s side.
“Right this way,” he replies and leads them to a booth. Around it is a discreet silencing charm, preventing those outside the bubble from hearing their conversation. There’s only a small extended patch for their server to step in to hear their order.
“It is my pleasure.” Hari’s certain it is. After all, just being seen with Hari will raise Lord Nott’s status in the eyes of the other Lords and Ladies. “Here you are, then.” He gestures towards where Hari can now see Lucius.
Slowly, ever so slowly, Hari nods. “Yes,” he whispers, not trusting his voice to be any louder and remain even somewhat steady.
“Hari,” Draco draw’s Hari’s gaze back to him. “May I kiss you?”
“Lady Longbottom,” a voice greets them, “Heir Longbottom, Lord Potter, Miss Granger.” Draco walks up, Lucius and Narcissa close on his heels. He bows elegantly, “wonderful to see you all.”
“Sneaky,” Pansy chuckles.
“I take it that’s the Lord’s suite,” Draco grumbles.
“At which point, Professor Tonks would have a rather empty day,” Lord Nott points out.
“It’s a sweet name,” Hari smiles, “for a very sweet cat.”
“I do,” Draco tells him gently. “It’s because
The meeting has wrapped up with this and so Hari makes his way down to the Entrance Hall and port-keys to Potter Manor, then floos to Malfoy Manor.
“We are,” Draco confirms, “Hari petrified him before he could do anything. Aurors Shacklebot and Tonks took him away just a minute or so ago. We port-keyed back right away.”
They carry on, wrapped up in each other and blissfully unaware of the world around them.
“Why are you speaking as if you’re never going to see him again?” Harry frowned, feeling irritated by Snape’s characteristic cryptic intonation and phrasing.
“Yeah, that might be an idea,” Harry nodded before wincing. “I um, I think Remus might be expecting us to go home next week as well actually.”
Harry sighed, feeling himself thicken between his legs as he stood up and walked gingerly towards the bathroom. He turned on the shower and stood in the blistering hot spray, willing himself not to sink to the level of jerking off whilst Draco lay innocently sleeping in the next room.
“Nngh!” Draco let out another groan, he was clearly attempting to touch himself again and was close to slipping out of Harry’s hold. Harry winced as he lowered the younger boy carefully to the ground, hoping the cold of the flagstones might help abate his fever. Harry sat down behind Draco, bracketing him between his thighs to ensure the omega didn’t just fall backwards and hit his head.
Harry had his sights set on the aurors and whilst Sirius had scoffed at the concept of extra voluntary schooling, Remus had been very pro the idea. The quiet and fiercely intelligent werewolf had batted Sirius over the head and told Harry that he should opt to stay at Hogwarts for as long as possible before being thrust into the drudgery of working life.
Sometimes, late at night when Draco couldn’t sleep and his anxiety was creeping in, he couldn’t help but imagine a future where Harry mated with another omega or beta. What would they make of Draco? A youthful indiscretion on the part of their otherwise perfect spouse? Would they make sure Draco never saw Harry again? Would they try to turn Draco’s child against him? Surely Harry would never allow such a thing?
“Uncle Sev?”
Harry smiled softly, “To be honest, I tried but I think my alpha would prefer to be between you and the door if that’s okay?”
Half an hour later, Draco was dressed in a new, warm pair of trousers and novelty underpants with a Christmas pudding on them. Harry had taken his coat back and was shooting Draco worried, furtive looks as they made their way towards the food stalls to meet up with the others.
Draco looked across to where Ginny was peering at them with interest, Seamus and his friend Dean too. Draco already felt like a kid who had wet himself and needed Harry to carry around his dirty clothes, he didn’t think he could bear to isolate himself even further from all of Harry’s adult friends who were clearly eager to get into the maze.
Harry frowned and suppressed his scent as he drew closer. He knew Remus had been aware that Draco’s pregnancy had not been a natural one, but he hadn’t known that Remus had already figured out about Snape’s spell.
cooling charms,” Hermione announced, looking a little put out, “anyway, we’ve moved the food under one of the oak trees but I thought I’d come and get you before Harry sweats himself dry.”
“It’s okay, it’s okay sweetheart, I’m still here,” Harry murmured, managed to extricate himself completely before hurrying to get a towel. Harry wrapped the thick purple cloth around his middle, hoping to conceal his own state of arousal before he leant down to scoop Draco up and lift him out of the now empty tub. “I’ve got you,” Harry told the struggling omega who pressed his face against Harry’s scent glands before falling limp in his arms.
Draco nodded, looking pleased as he cooed at Lyra, unwrapping her silk shawl before cradling her gently to his chest and drawing across the water to look out of the window. “It’s so beautiful here Harry, I’m so happy.”
want to know is why you didn’t tell me this poor omega was pregnant? I’ve had him on his feet rushing about for the last forty five minutes. Good lord Draco, please sit in the chair, you must be absolutely exhausted!”
“You alright?” Harry chuckled at Draco’s strange behaviour. “You look like a puppy trying to get dry.”
“Oh sweetheart,” Harry sighed with a sympathetic expression. It was the first time Harry had used such a term of endearment to refer to Draco, despite the women of Gaedere doing so regularly, and Draco bitterly regretted that he couldn’t even enjoy it.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “they didn’t sound too surprised though, I reckon it was pretty obvious at Christmas how I felt.”
“Mm,” Harry murmured, not the least bit interested in Dean’s plans for his sexual exploits. “What about you and Hermione?” Harry said looking up, “Is she going tomorrow?”
“Ronald Weasley if you open that door I will hex your bollocks off,” Hermione declared loudly, winking at Draco who let out a surprised laugh.
“Don’t you think it’s weird though?” Harry frowned, “The idea of me going out on the pull whilst someone else is carrying my baby? I mean what am I going to do, have a quick fumble with Gabby in the club loos before coming home and crawling into bed with Draco to feed the baby magic?”
“You’re not going to do anything ridiculous like bond bite him are you?” Hermione narrowed her eyes.
Draco sucked in a sharp intake of breath as more slick gushed out of him. Harry groaned as he felt the warm liquid coat the swollen head of his cock, running down his shaft and pooling in his dark thatch of hair.
If he hadn’t read about how omegas sometimes passed out after bonding he would have been beside himself with worry by now. He dreaded to think of what might have happened if he had been forced to call for Hermione. Even the thought of it had Harry reaching for one of his larger shirts to drape over Draco’s nude form, protecting him from non-existent prying eyes.
Hermione raised her eyebrows and waited for Harry to continue.
“Harry,” Professor McGonagall began, jerking Harry’s attention back to her at the unusual use of his given name. “When we introduced the higher education programme at Hogwarts, we understood the implications of having a large number of adult students mingling with the younger cohorts.” McGonagall paused to levitate a pot of tea over to them, refilling her cup with something that smelled strongly of valerian, the calming root.
“What?” Harry said in surprise. “He didn’t say anything to me,” he looked sadly down at the omega.
“You saying my mum was magnanimous?” Harry grinned.
Harry looked up in surprise to where Draco had emerged wearing a very sweet looking velvet smock.
“You’re so beautiful Draco,” Harry whispered, starting to thrust in and out, “you’re so perfect for me, I’m going to take care of you always.”
“What contract?” Snape frowned.
Harry felt the anger leave him as quickly as it had come. He stood back with a sigh, rubbing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.
“Are y-you in a relationship with Ginny?” Draco asked, hugging his legs a little tighter.
“Good,” Harry said. “You have my express permission to set Hermione on me if I even start showing signs of being that much of a jerk.”
“Well,” Harry grinned, “this is going to make it a lot easier to remember birthdays in our household.”
Harry gave her a grim smile. During his time at Hogwarts, several of his admirers had gone out of their way to try and send Harry love potion infused chocolates or scent fixators, hoping to secure some sort of claiming bite.
“She’s so tiny and perfect,” Harry commented, stroking Draco’s damp hair, careful not to snag any with his fingers.
“I’m not sure,” Harry admitted. He had honestly been watching Draco pretty closely to see if his pregnancy was showing but the boy tended to wear quite loose fitting robes, probably to stop the rest of the student body gawping at him. Even his nightgown had been very deliberately shapeless.
“Fine,” Harry huffed, snatching up the quill and scribbling his name as quickly as possible. The whole thing left a nasty taste in his mouth. He knew that omegas were legally seen as property, even Molly wasn’t able to open a Gringott’s account with written approval from Arthur, but other than that Harry didn’t have many experiences with them.
Harry’s lips pulled back in a snarl,
“All done,” Padma announced, screwing the lid back on the jar of ointment. “You got anything to change into?”
wedding and
“I love you Draco,” Harry murmured, cradling his husband and daughter a little tighter in his arms.
“Oh that’s lovely,” Katie announced, coming into the room a moment later in a very short, pleated sundress with embroidered flowers.
Harry stared at him in surprise, it wasn’t unheard of for omegas to get knocked up at school but it was pretty unusual. Most likely the omega had forgotten his birth control or perhaps he had just really wanted to become a parent.
Without another word, the Lestranges turned on their heel and marched out of the Hospital Wing, leaving Harry to wonder what in the hell he had just done.
“Reward for what?” Harry prompted.
“Atherol Sourboll is f-fifty years old!” Draco’s voice squeaked.
He glanced at Hermione again to check if they were mocking him but she was merely regarding him as if curious for the answer.
“So how’d you do it?” the alpha, whose surname was Smith, addressed Draco directly. The man was dark haired like Harry but with paler skin. Whilst he was also very handsome there was something about his scent that seemed threatening to Draco. Draco tensed in confusion, glancing at a stormy looking Harry to see what he should say. Had Harry told his friends about the spell? Was this ‘Smith’ asking Draco about the potion?
“I don’t think so,” Harry pulled a face, “I mean you are my omega, right now, and I want to help you with any discomfort however I can. It’s just a massage right? I gave you one of those on the train.”
“I know,” Harry replied, the sky was starting to darken as the sun set.
“Alpha,” Draco pouted, “need you.”
“Don’t be so hard on yourself,” Harry told him, “this is the first time you’re having to learn all of this stuff.” Harry took a deep breath, “Do you…do you want me to try and help?”
“So what’s the plan?” Hermione asked, frowning over at Harry.
“Promise?” Draco asked anxiously, he could see someone’s iguana patronus scurrying off away over the grass towards the castle.
told you so then…”
“I fear you never did quite understand James,” Remus sighed, “Glory was never his goal. He only wanted to protect his family.”
“Yeah,” Harry laughed, “We’re all out of presents now anyway.”
Venetia screamed hysterically, raving about how Draco wanted to now get rid of any competition for Harry’s affections.
“Katie suggested it,” Draco shrugged, “she thought…seeing as it’s our wedding night…”
“I’m okay,” Draco whispered, but his eyes were shining.
know is always trying to look eighteen,” Harry grinned, trying to get Draco to relax. “The outfit looks great, honestly. Probably not warm enough for the current weather but by the time you’ll be able to fit into it again it will be summer right?”
There was another pause as Harry winced, he had probably sent the omega into another panic spiral.
^*^*^*^*^
“We were wondering if you had overslept,” Hermione smiled. “Are you coming to breakfast or have you finally hit morning sickness?”
“No, no! Mr. Caulfield, I said not up there - I’ve got an omega in the changing rooms, goodness gracious!” Olive materialized at the top of the stairs looking flustered.
“Do you not like it or something?” Harry asked, ignoring the shocked murmurings as he swung his legs over the bench and sat down next to Draco. Harry towered over the omega, along with most of the betas and even the alphas on the Slytherin table. Plus, he did look so much older than them, Draco couldn’t imagine what was going through some of the staff members’ minds as he saw even a great number of professors were peering over at them from the high table. Draco knew that knowledge of the spell was being kept strictly between Professor McGonagall, Severus and Madam Pomfrey.
Draco looked up at Harry who shrugged uncomfortably, turning to his godfather with a confused frown. A second later, a slightly shorter man with black hair in a messy ponytail appeared. He was wearing ripped denims and a leather jacket, undeniably handsome with some sort of strange inky smudge on his chin that resembled car oil.
