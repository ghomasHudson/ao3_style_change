Harry chuckled. ‘
“Me too. Honestly, Harry,” she said, glancing up from her stirring. “I was really worried about this arrangement. But I like it. A lot.”
And as many times as Ron had reassured him… he couldn’t stop the suffocating feeling that he was somehow no longer a part of the only true family he’d ever had—because he tore it apart. And Colin… too young to die, had snuck back into battle to fight for him, and Harry hadn’t been able to stop him. Hadn’t been able to save him. And by the time he knew about Colin, he was already dead.
“Harry, I’ve shared that class with him since sixth year. With all the tabs you kept on him back then, I’m surprised you didn’t know that.”
“Harry, please don’t start this again,” Hermione practically begged.
The eighth-years are brought to their new dormitories. Once the boys and girls separate, the boys all spend the evening chatting and goofing around--mostly.
Harry took a deep breath, eyes closed, then opened them again. He knew he shouldn’t be so shaken, they were only in class after all. If anything, it should remind him of the fun times he’d had with the DA. But now, even that stood for something more, and he just couldn’t shake off the bad memories and connotations held by so many things he used to enjoy.
Finally, he picked up the razor and banished it back to his trunk. He washed the blood from his arm and drained the red colour from the floor of the stall and any of the water around him. Swiping at his cheeks angrily he waited until his breathing was even, and no one was coming in or out to turn off the water. Once it was off, he threw a towel around his waist, pressed his bloody arm against the towel harshly, and hurried back to his bed, snapping the curtains shut.
Simultaneously, Harry and Hermione whipped their heads to the side as they heard both the bang of an expanding cauldron and a sharp gasp. Malfoy’s cauldron had been the culprit, and he sat at his desk, eyes blown wide and breathing quickly. He’d crossed his arms and backed as far back in his space as he could from his desk, eyes slowly becoming glassy. The two Gryffindor’s watched as he retreated into himself for a moment. He quickly snapped out of it, yanking his phone out of his robe pocket and stuffing headphones in his ears.
Harry nodded, then scooped some more eggs into his mouth. Hermione turned to the black-haired girl. “Well, you’re welcome to sit here whenever you want.”
“S’alright. And yeah.”
“Thanks. You can come sit with use over there, too. I swear Draco and Blaise aren’t so bad. Even Theo.” She laughed at that, like it was some sort of inside joke. It probably was.
“Draco?”
“Huh?”
to sleep, okay?”
Draco’s face softened. “But you’re good.”
“Nothing, Harry.”
He pressed send.
“Don’t need someone else ending up like Crabbe!”
“Hmm?” He looked up, then glanced at his pile. “Oh. Defense, potions, charms, transfiguration, ancient runes, arithmancy, and alchemy.”
After a few minutes of near silence, Harry, Ron, and Seamus decide to move closer to where Neville and Dean’s beds were on the right side of the room. Harry and Ron sat together in the windowsill, while Seamus joined Dean on his bed. The five talked about their summers, their NEWTs, Quidditch, anything other than what had just happened only two months prior.
“Why?” Faith asked.
As always, let me know your thoughts! Also, go me! Two updates in one day, woohoo! -Emma :)
“What do you guys wanna do tonight?” Ron asked, looking between him and Hermione, who gave him a look.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the common room at the same time that Blaise hit the bottom stair. He looked at Harry, who was headed towards him. “He’s upstairs. Just brought him some food.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron smiled sadly, turning his back and leaving them alone once more. He walked back out to the other boys, who looked at him expectantly.
The boys laughed together, some jokingly dancing to the music. The conversed together as they goofed off with the candies. Next, Michael sounded like a duck. The boys chortled as he hopped around, jumping over their feet and flapping his arms. Harry’s head fell back in laughter as Michael stepped on Ron, causing him to yelp.
Harry wondered?
‘Are you okay?’
Malfoy’s eyes turned to icy daggers. “Funny. What I was going to say was that I’m actually really interested in becoming a healer
“Talk about it.”
“Secret,” Hermione said, a finger to her lips. Then she laughed again, finishing the last of her muffin. “How about you guys? Was it awkward?”
different now.”
He huffed. “I don’t mean something evil. I mean I think something’s wrong.”
He looked down at his messy scrawl, cheeks heating up as he felt Draco’s smirk beside him. “Uh, no. No, not yet. Sorry.” He peeked up and she had gone back to her work, shaking her head at his daydreaming. Then he turned to Draco, placing a hand on his arm to get his attention. His icy eyes looked into Harry’s. “Did you know I was almost sorted into Slytherin?”
“Eh,” said Ron. “Maybe.”
Ron jumped in before Ned could pick up where he left off. “About how much you first-years know about the older students here.”
The common room door opened and in strode the Slytherin quidditch team. Daphne came though first, blond ponytail falling out. She waved at Pansy, grabbed some food from the platter laid out for them, then jogged upstairs. Blaise followed suit, and Draco emerged from behind him. Harry watched as he looked around the room, then flashed a smile at Harry when he saw him. Harry waved.
“I don’t want to talk about!” Draco snapped, glaring up at Harry, who took a step back.
Malfoy’s icy eyes were piercing as he glared at Harry. He hadn’t meant it that way, but it was too late. The damage was done. He gulped, opened his mouth to speak…. But nothing came. He closed it promptly, turned, and left the room. As he made it to the bottom of the stairs a few pairs of eyes landed on his. Blaise and Pansy stared at his red cheeks—his lip bloody from biting it. They eyed him and he inhaled sharply, tearing his eyes away and hurrying over to Ron and Hermione. He hadn’t met to upset their friend. Honestly! He was just checking on him…
“Yeah. And so I went to try and wake him up, but when he did he, er… he sorta broke down.”
Ginny scored another ten points and Ron huffed at Harry, drawing his attention away from his thoughts. “Can’t we work on something else now? Training Maya, maybe?”
“Malfoy—” Harry called out, but the boy had already snapped his curtains shut. He tried to convince himself that the sound he heard from behind the curtain wasn’t real… that he’d only imagined the muffled scream or sob of frustration that had torn from the other boy’s throat. His chest burned.
After dropping the book to the ground and sliding it under the curtains, Harry headed back to his own bed to get dressed. He pulled on his dress shirt, sweater, and robes, fiddling with his tie to get it to sit properly. Ron asked him about their classes from the day before, standing in front of Harry, ready to go, as he tied his shoes.
Harry looked at him, amused, and nodded. Then he tapped Ron on the shoulder. “Wanna partner up today?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I never said I was.”
“Dead serious.”
Late night conversations and early morning distress.
“It’s only been a few weeks and you’re already acting the same way.”
Ron Weasley: Can u help me out? Had to give some kids detention for hexing Draco while we were patrolling. He’s fine but bloodied up, so I sent him back to the common room. Can u help clean him up?
Professor McGonagall’s robes billowed behind her as she swept around the corners of the corridors. The eighth-year students followed her eagerly, excited, yet nervous to see their new arrangement. Turn after turn they made, the architecture catching their eyes as it had always done… although now it had a newer feel. And an intimidating reminder as well.
The pang turned into an ache. A longing. He didn’t want Harry to feel like this. He had saved his life more than once. He didn’t deserve to feel this way. He didn’t understand why Harry felt guilty. Why he kept apologizing to Ron, and everyone else for that matter. For everything. As if it was his fault that he was a pawn in a war, being used from such a young age. They were
‘Idk… whats ur fav subject’
Harry sat back on his haunches, hands up. “I—sorry…At least… just… talk to someone. Even if it’s not Blaise or me.” Draco avoided looking at Harry, reigning in the anger from his outburst. He swiped at his eyes, engulfed in silence. “Goyle’s wrong by the way. I remember what happened. It wasn’t your fault… Please don’t blame yourself.” He was still silent. “I’m going to dinner. But, I’m here, if you need someone.”
“Defense,” said Hermione without looking up from her book.
Hi everyone. So yes, I know that Dean was caught by the snatchers at the same time as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but I am writing it as if he was captured around the same time as Luna. Just to clear that up. Anyways, let me know what you think! Until next time! -Emma :)
‘Sometimes. Sometimes in my room.’
Harry laughed abruptly. “You’re talking to me.”
Ned glanced up at Ron. “A lot of us do. Well, at least, the one’s who grew up as wizards or have older siblings. I don’t mean to sound rude… it’s just intimidating. Being a Gryffindor. I don’t know if I can hold up what you guys have left for me.”
Malfoy didn’t rise to Goyle’s taunts. Harry’s eyes widened, flitting back and forth between the two, former, friends.
Harry pondered that for a minute. “Er… probably in a couple of weeks. Let everyone settle back in and get used to this new normal, ya know?”
down, let alone how to calm Harry down. He rested his head on top of Harry’s and rubbed his back as he let out all of his pent-up emotions. “Shh… you’re safe with me… no one is here to hurt you…”
“What’s happening?” Blaise demanded, worry creasing the lines of his face.
Hermione side-eyed the girl on the floor, who was smirking up at her. She rolled her eyes, setting her closed book on the table, a hint of a smile on her lips. “Fine. Just one game.”
The next morning, Draco thanks his number neighbour for advice. Harry and Hermione chat in potions class and Harry is oblivious as ever.
The dorm room appeared before him once again and he blinked into the darkness, rubbed his eyes. A few of the boys were shuffling around him, and although his curtains were open, he couldn’t see what was happening in the absence of the normal moonlight streaming in the window. “
Harry shrugged. As Ron turned to leave, Draco’s breathing shuddered. He turned back to see the boy he’d always loathed being comforted by his best mate… it was jarring. All of it. “It’s okay,” Harry whispered to the blond. “You’re safe… breathe, Draco…”
“Dammit, Justin!” She layed down her cards. “I had three Kings!”
After the boys calmed down and Michael handed the box of sweets to Seamus, Harry spoke again. “Actually, that just reminded me of something. Sorry if this is a little personal, but it’s a warning. I’ve always had nightmares, my childhood was kinda rough, but since the end of the war they’ve been especially bad. I can put up a silencing charm at night if you all want me to, just so that you don’t have to wake me because I wake you.”
“It’s okay.”
Harry’s heart lurched, thudding twice as fast in his chest.
He turned to Hermione, who’s brow creased in confusion. “Yeah. It’s a really small class this year, there is only six or seven of us.”
The group nodded then turned back to each other. Harry pointed his wand at Draco, who went cross-eyed. “What are you doing Harry?”
“Yeah. Makes sense.”
Within a few minutes, they were racing again, diving and swerving through the beams of the stadium. Side by side they stretched to close their fingers around the snitch and finally, Harry emerged with it in his grasp. His team cheered, as did Ron and Hermione as he smiled at them from afar. Ginny and Dean flew over, clapped him on the back. Dean nodded at Draco, who returned the gesture, uncomfortably.
Until next time, guys! -Emma :)
“I see that you’re getting closer with him Harry, and I just wanted to tell you something.”
“Are you going to be okay?” Draco nodded, and he stood to leave. “Okay.”
He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. When he opened them again, he found that Harry’s piercing green eyes were still boring into him. “I’m fine.”
Draco smiled to himself and rolled over onto his side. Maybe he should ask this boy for advice more often.
Blaise cocked an eyebrow at him. “Think about it.”
Carefully, Harry opened the door and stepped through. All of the boys had their curtains drawn and seemed to be sleeping. All except one—Malfoy. The blond Slytherin was laying on his left side, wand lighting the words of his book. Harry frowned, crossing the room to his bed. Though he thought the other boy’s eyes were trained on the lines of text, Harry didn’t see his brief, curious glance. Once in his pyjamas, Harry headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Upon emerging, he headed back to his bed… or at least, he intended to.
“So, what do you want us to do?” Ernie asked. “Just say our names?”
“Harry?”
He rolled his eyes. “Fine. Harry, what do you want to do tonight?”
Harry shouted at himself, inwardly.
know, even if you don’t realize that I do, that you’ve suffered more than just one night.”
Draco’s eyes didn’t divert from Harry. “He didn’t know he was a wizard?”
She grinned up at him. “Yes. Have you started the homework from last class?”
“You aren’t gunna get passed this one so easily,
“Whatever you say, Harry,” he sang, diving back into his potatoes.
‘U will know who I am.’
“Personally,” Dean piped up. “I think it was brilliant for McGonagall to find a way for us to use the technology at school. Especially with our new Hogwarts email addresses. I think it will be a lot easier.”
“Stupid prat deserves whatever he got, and whatever comes next,” said Justin.
Draco nodded, rubbing the nape of his neck. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Harry shook it. “Of course.”
“You sure?”
He turned from the mirror abruptly, heading to the showers to wash away the terrors of the previous night. Draco turned the water on and stepped into the shower, resting his forehead against the wall as the water ran over his body as soon as the stall door was shut. Eyes shut tightly; he remembered the events of the day before. The texting… why would anyone want to talk to him? Want to get to know him? Of course, they didn’t know it was him… but if they did… And then there was Potter. He came up and actually
“That’s what you want everyone to believe. But Blaise and I… we see past that. Draco, I
“Hey! I can’t help that I’m good at this game. Don’t knock my skills.”
think it would.”
“Yeah. Just let me finish tying my shoe.”
He nodded, staring at the thin cloth shielding him from his thoughts. Ron cleared his throat and tore his eyes away. “Do you want anything from the trolley, mate? It’ll be by any minute.”
It was Sue. She was staring at him with a creased brow. Harry looked at her, then at the others at the table, who were all giving him a similar look. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just texting someone that’s all.”
“Was it Malfoy?” Harry glanced up at Ron. “Well, he’s always in there.”
Ron chuckled, tying his tie. “Okay, okay! Let’s go.”
this song.”
Draco raised an eyebrow with a breathy, humourless laugh, looking Harry in the eyes. “Are you kidding? I already have it.”
“I said I want to study ancient runes.”
Harry smiled. ‘
“Why? Because he’d just been consoling Harry?”
’ He slipped his phone back into his pocket as Hermione stood from the table, sliding her book into her bag. Remembering Draco heading straight back to the dorm, Harry found an empty plate on the table, cringed at it, not knowing what he liked, and then decided to load it with what he had just eaten. Hermione and Ron raised their brows and he only shrugged. “Draco didn’t come to dinner after charms.”
“Thanks. See you.”
“It.. that’s just so like him. And I haven’t seen that side of him much lately. He always was a snarky little shit, but with us he was just plain funny. But now Goyle isn’t
Harry responds to Draco's message, and they discuss what has been going on with him. Followed by a mishap on Prefect duty.
“I never said that,” she chuckled, and Hermione shouldered her, supressing a smile.
Hermione eyed Harry. “So what did you do?”
“Where is he now?”
“Morning, guys.”
‘Nope. I haven’t been so lucky in that department.’
“I know that. It just… gets to me sometimes.”
Harry grimaced as Ron laid his hand on the boy’s shoulder, “Harry. Wake up.” He shook him gently. “Harry.”
Harry glanced around him, heart still beating out of his chest. Behind him, Ginny crouched under her desk, wand drawn, breathing steady but eyes full of terror. Luna crouched next to her, hair in her eyes because of her downcast gaze. Neville was beside Ron, shaking his head as he rose back to his seat. Hannah, Ernie, Tony, Michael, Terry, and Lavender all looked to be in a similar position.
“Alright class,” Professor Spunks boomed, striding into the room. “I assume you all remember that we will be duelling today?” The class nodded. “Now, today we will be doing review. Just what you already know. Try your best to use silent spells, but you can verbalize if you must. But first, let’s go over some quick theory. Who can tell me what the difference is between a jinx, a hex, and a curse?”
Ron nodded. “Ready to go?”
After the class had resumed for a few minutes and they were back to working with tiny animals, Harry felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned around, meeting blue eyes. “Hey, you all right, Luna?” He felt Hermione turn around as well.
Pansy smiled broadly. “Yeah, for sure!”
Harry shot up with a sob and a gasp, staring straight at Draco, terror and pain etched into every line of his face. He broke down, letting his head fall and sobs ripping from his body. His chest impossibly tight, Draco pulled Harry into his arms. Draco held Harry tight as he jolted and cried, horror and pain seeping from him as he sobbed into the Slytherin’s chest.
Harry nearly choked on his eggs, and he spluttered for a moment. “Y-yeah. He’s fine.”
Draco let out a short laugh through his nose, but it wasn’t indignant. He seemed… amused? With a smile he took the plate from Harry. “Thanks. You didn’t have to.”
Justin cut the cards. “If you can collect three of the same cards, you can knock. The other players get to draw one more card. Unless they have three cards of a higher value than yours, you can win. So if I had three kings and Hermione had three aces, she’d win, because she’s ace high.”
“I was saved by a mother’s love, three times. First by my mum, from Voldemort. Second, by Molly Weasley, from loneliness and neglect. And third, by your Mother… because of her love for you. She checked my pulse in the forest, and when she found out I was alive, she asked if you were alive, and if you were in the castle. When I said yes, she lied to Voldemort. It’s the only reason I’m here.”
Professor McGonagall cleared her voice at the front of the room, causing every head to turn in her direction. She stared out at the faces before her, smiling warmly at her students who had decided to return this year, all eight years of witches and wizards. “The sorting ceremony will now commence! Professor Sprout will bring in the first year students momentarily. As it is our first year post-war, some may be frightened. Many of you, I’m sure, were not convinced about returning this year yourselves. Please make them feel welcome. Treat them well, and each other well, also. That is all.”
“How do you figure?” Ron asked.
“Would you like to scrimmage? Neither of our teams seem to be doing trials and we still have another thirty minutes.”
“Okay, what col—”
The Great Hall looked just as magnificent as it had before the Battle of Hogwarts. The windows had been repaired, the ceiling as well, and the tables stood in exactly the same places as they had when Harry had last seen them on a normal school day. Although, despite its beauty, he couldn’t stop himself from tensing when he walked in. Many of the eighth years did as they entered together… all remembering the scene they had left behind the previous year. The bodies strewn on the ground, the yelling, the screaming, the blood and jets of light flying past your head… barely allowing you another day. Of course they all remembered that… who could forget?
“Yeah. I’m not used to him being so quiet and drawn back. I’ve tried to talk to him, but he won’t say anything. Just pushes me away. We’ve always been close, so that makes it more weird.”
He returned to slicing ingredients, consulting his textbook every few minutes. Eventually, his eyes found their way back to Draco, watching as the other boy smiled and laughed at a joke Blaise made. The concentration on his face as he placed ingredients in the cauldron and stirred.
“Perfect! Well it looks like we’ve got all four houses now, five points to Hufflepuff. Finally, can anyone tell me some of the curses I will not, under any circumstances, tolerate in this room? Mister Malfoy again.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat at a table by the bay window, intending to do homework. Harry pulled his phone out from his pocket and opened his messages. His fingers flew over the keys, genuinely curious about the reserved Slytherin.
Harry chuckled to himself as he rose, bare feet hitting the cool floor. He padded over to Malfoy’s bed quietly. Being friends with Hermione, he knew that bookworms losing their place was disastrous. Timidly, he attempted to pry the book from the other boy’s limp hand, but was shocked when he jumped up, startled, wand raised and pointed at Harry. The latter jumped back, hands up, one still clutching the book. Draco’s face was contorted, anger and fear mingling there.
Hermione glanced up at him as he let his leg land back on the floor. “Maybe that’s the point. McGonagall invited us back as the first ever eighth years to finish our education… and if I’m right there’s thirty-three of us returning. Some of us have been injured, some scarred, others traumatized. It’s not
“You can also knock if you think you have a higher value than anyone else, say… 29. That’s a common time to knock. Do you guys want to play?”
No one woke Harry the next morning. He woke around 11am to a silent dorm. He pushed himself into a sitting position, grabbed his glasses from his nightstand and blinked at the bright sunlight. Fluffy white clouds drifted by outside and the sky boasted a brilliant blue. Harry huffed a small smile, then looked around the room as he got out of bed. All of the other beds except for one were empty. Draco lay in his bed with the curtains open, fast asleep, clutching his blankets. Harry’s smile spread. He looked so peaceful like this.
“I’m Justin. There’s nothing interesting about me. I’m literally boring as hell and can’t make a joke to save my life. But I could probably out-eat
“You were
I'm so sorry I've been gone, guys. I really am. I'll explain more in the end notes.
He nodded at his plate. “Yeah. Tell her I’ll be down in a bit.”
Ron blinked a few times, then whispered in amusement, “You got
Hermione laughed. “If last night was any indicator of what this year is gunna be like, it’ll be a riot.”
“Stop saying that,” Harry whispered. “Stop lying. You don’t have to keep this all bottled up or hide it. You’re allowed to
“Sure,” said Draco. “Or you can do mine, I’ll do Hermione, and Hermione can do yours. How about we try and give the other person our own hair colour?”
“I’d say hex ‘em back but, you know… maybe don’t do that?”
“Er—what?”
Ron sat back and pulled out his phone. Harry turned to Justin. “Wanna play cards?”
“Dammit, Ron!” Harry turned to Justin and Ron, watching Ron’s smug face as he took Justin’s king. Justin turned to Harry. “He’s a cheater, I’m tellin’ ya!” But he didn’t mean it, his smile was too genuine.
I guess we will have to find a way around you. Shouldn’t be too hard though.”
He paused, thinking of what to say. “It’s not your fault.”
“You’re joking, Pansy.”
‘Idk… we’ve never gotten along. He’d just push me away.’
She nodded. “Yeah, it wasn’t too bad, really. A charm went wrong. But it wouldn’t have looked so bad if that side of the class was taken up by old books.” She pouted at that at Harry had to hold back a smirk. “What happened with you three?”
(See the end of the chapter for
She glanced down at him, contemplating. Then she closed her book and slid onto the floor. “Sure. Haven’t played that in a while.”
“Well…” Hermione leaned back in her chair, picking a piece from her muffin and stuffing it in her mouth. “Fay is a horseback rider, which is really cool. Pansy is a lot more into makeup than we all thought, and she’s apparently really good at it. Padma and Parvati don’t like a lot of the same things—you should hear them bicker! Daphne is as much of a bookworm as I am, and Sue and Hannah both keep gifts from their younger siblings in their trunks because they’re too young to be at school.”
He decided that he didn’t mind coming back to school after all. He’d been skeptical about how he’d handle it, but so far, it didn’t seem too bad. He was settling in nicely. He had his friends still and was developing new relationships with people, like Blaise and Draco, that he never would have imagine. He was getting closer with people like Justin that he hadn’t been as close with before. It was fun to sit in the common room with everyone his own age, everyone who’d gone through the war together in some way, shape, or form. Everyone who he knew, but didn’t know at the same time. It wasn’t so bad, after all. Granted, it had only been a few weeks, but an eventful few.
‘You want to get to know me?’
“Oh yeah,” she said, smiling at the bunch. “We know a lot. Is that what you were telling them, er…”
Ron gave him an incredulous look as Harry smiled at him. Harry said nothing, but Dean and Ron both made faces at him throughout the game, rolling their eyes jokingly saying he’d never win. However, their initial reactions to his comment about winning were no match for the
Draco shook his head at himself, then rested it against the wall. It had to be Harry Potter that came in, didn’t it? Of all people… He chuckled lowly to himself, swiping at his eyes again. Blaise he would have expected… he’d had an eye on him recently. Even Theo. But not Harry. That was the last person he was expecting to see when he finally looked at the person who’d comforted him… He wasn’t one to accept comfort, often. Especially not when he felt he didn’t deserve it. And now he’d shown him weakness, vulnerability… to the one person he’d thought would never be the one to be there for him. Of course, though, it
Harry tore his gaze away and refocused onto his own team. Ginny was instructing the chasers on a new drill, while Jimmy was showing Maya how to properly swing her bat. Harry decided to circle above them and practice some rolls and dives as he searched for the snitch. He practiced corkscrews, vertical twists, dives, and finally, a looping dive that allowed him to quickly change directions, as if folding on an axis and heading back the way he had come after turning upside down. In his head he called it a looping dive, as he wasn’t quite sure what the real thing was called.
Harry surveyed the room to see what the other boys were up to. The Hufflepuff boys were sitting on the far side of the room, talking quietly. Malfoy was laying on his stomach on his bed, his nose buried in a book. Goyle was annoying Blaise, who sat with his arms crossed on the edge of his bed. Terry Boot was seemingly playing a game on his phone, as was Theodore Nott, and the other Ravenclaw boys were talking amongst themselves.
Once again, he thought about how odd this was. But at the same time, he also recognized that he didn’t care anymore. Whatever had been their old relationship, the war had turned it upside down. It had flicked a switch in him, the events, the stress, the reality of what his parents had instilled in him, the torture, the loss… all of it. It had been hard on him, too. After all, they were
His head shot up. “Sorry, what?”
Mumbling reached his ears and slowly became clear. The rest of the boys were up getting ready for classes. Showers were running, a toilet was flushing, trunks opening and closing, groggy early-morning conversations…
“None of us do, ‘Mione. That’s what I was trying to tell them. We all just went through a war… let’s keep the peace,” Harry replied, sighing. He glanced over to the Slytherin table. Malfoy was sitting with Pansy and Blaise… but Goyle lingered there, too. Harry rolled his eyes. “Come on. We better get to class.”
Draco was practically jogging as he rounded the third corner, yanking relentlessly at his tie. Harry couldn’t help but remember a similar sight in sixth year and it yanked on his heart harshly. Too many what-ifs to count. He had just about decided enough was enough and was going to call his name when someone else entered the corridor from an intersecting one.
Draco stopped at his curtains, looking at Harry with an expression Harry couldn’t read, but wished he could. “Yes. You definitely can.” He turned and looked at all of the closed curtains with a sigh, then back at Harry. “Goodnight.”
“Yeah. Yeah, just keep going.”
“Huh?” Ron looked at him quizzically. “What do you mean?”
Harry took a swig, then set the goblet down in front of him. “Draco was having a nightmare… remembering being tortured. That’s why he was screaming like that.”
“I didn’t mean—”
He nodded. “Yeah, but only for the last two years of school. It’s not an OWL subject. It’s just an extra class, I guess.”
“Do you think you could show me how to do my eyeliner like that sometime? It looks really good.”
“You’re both brilliant,” Harry mused, staring down at his screen. It lit up and he lifted it in front of his face instantly, ignoring Ron’s comment about how they were also both infuriating.
. And it's your fault.”
Harry snorted, picking up a forkful of eggs. “Whatcha reading, ‘Mione?”
‘idk if id call it that’
Harry startled as a noise reached his ear, although he couldn’t quite place it at first. He listened harder, dropping the map onto his stomach. Somewhere in the room, a sniffling noise was echoing. After another minute, Harry frowned, realizing that it wasn’t some sort of cold—one of the boys was crying. He didn’t know who, couldn’t recognize it as one of the Gryffindor boys. Besides, they wouldn’t cry by themselves in the middle of the night when they thought no one would hear them. Seamus and Dean would be together, and Ron or Neville would come to him. They always did, even if Harry wasn’t always the best at comforting people. He tried his best, though.
Harry didn’t take his eyes off of Draco as he spoke. “I think he’s having a flashback to the fiendfyre…”
Harry’s gaze shifted to Malfoy, who looked skeptical, but curious. The corner of Harry’s lip quirked in amusement. “It’s sort of like a quill. Except you don’t have to dip it in ink all the time.”
Harry laughed. “I mean it! I argued with the fucking hat against putting me in Slytherin!”
“I’ll testify again,” Harry insisted, to which Hermione only gave him a sad smile. “What’s next? Dragging Draco into it again?”
“How was practice?” Pansy asked.
The table laughed as Hermione rolled her eyes. “I asked if you’d finished the tenth question yet.”
Harry woke to the slamming of the door the next Friday morning. He sat up as the door reopened, someone called an apology and the door shut once more. He rubbed his eyes, put on his glasses and blinked the remaining blurriness away. Harry swung his legs over the side of his bed, throwing his blankets to the side and winced at the coolness of the floor. It was only the middle of September, but the mornings were already beginning to become colder. Grabbing today’s clothes from his trunk, he began changing, listening to the commotion outside his curtains. A moment later he pulled them open, surveying the room.
Harry shrugged. “I figured. I mean, you’re all in different houses.”
I don’t know how to make you understand.”
He was sure Ron rolled his eyes that time. “It’s only half an hour earlier than normal.”
Harry put his phone down and unrolled his half-finished potions essay, leaving his bag on the seat beside him. He looked up as Padma Patil and Sue Li stood beside the table. “Hey guys, what’s up?”
“Heh… sorry.”
Harry watched Alice move to her seat as the next student was sorted. Alice walked along the table, staring at the students at her table who were either shocked or horrified. She caught Malfoy’s harrowed, icy eyes as she approached where the prefects sat. She stopped momentarily and watched his unmoving stare. Suddenly, he tore his eyes away and stared at the table. Alice watched him warily as she sat across from Pansy, who instead gave her a smile and introduced herself and Draco.
Harry’s curtains were open, and the boy was clearly having a nightmare. He had been calling out for Fred, who had been like a brother to him. Draco knew that—he had gone to the funeral. Not that anyone remembered that.
“Hey, why’re you looking at me,” Ron exclaimed. The boys all laughed.
Harry chuckled, swiping left to reply.
“You and him are at the top of every class, though,” said Ron.
He spoke through gritted teeth. “Would you rather I did?”
He laughed. “What should we start with?”
Draco gave him a ‘duh’ look. “Everyone is afraid of your sister. Tell her to keep that bat-bogey hex away from me, please and thanks.”
Harry frowned, thumb texting furiously as he shoved the sandwich further into his mouth with his other hand.
“Oh well.”
The two headed to the showers, towels around their waists as sunlight dimly lit the room from around the side of the castle. Ron pulled the door open and they stepped through, letting the door shut softly behind them. Harry looked up and stopped in his tracks. Draco had been coming towards them from the showers, hair plastered to his face, water droplets running down it. He stopped, too, as did Ron. The three boys stared at each other for a moment, before Harry smiled at him. Draco nodded back, before continuing his walk back to his bed. Harry watched with curious eyes, but was taken aback by the spot of blood half concealed by where his arm pressed the towel to his hipbone. Harry stared quizzically at the closed door until Ron touched his arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry thought his face might get stuck if he kept smiling, but he didn’t mind. He was beginning to genuinely like Draco as a person, if he hadn’t already, now that he was getting to know him. Intelligent. Funny. Snarky. Ambitious. Clever. Competitive. Artistic. Creative. The more he learned, the more he wanted to learn
“You know full well that I wouldn’t do that,” Harry retaliated, squinting.
The boys nodded, silence overtaking the group.
“Yep.”
“Beats me,” spat Ned. “He should’ve been sent to Azkaban. A lot of this is his fault, he would’ve deserved it.”
“Chang, Jadzia!”
“What was that?” Dean hollered, turning the volume up even higher. “Did you say crank it up?”
“I was going to change her hair colour,” Harry said. “I can try yours, too, if you like. It might be easier, because your hair is such a light colour.”
Hermione side-eyed him, then looked at Harry and Ron. They were all thinking the same thing in the silence. The boy was miserable.
Ron tapped him on the shoulder. “What’s 31?”
Hermione shook her head with a breathy laugh, then took a card off of the pile and put down a seven of spades. Harry scowled, then picked up the top card. Ten of clubs. He surveyed his cards. Queen of spades, five of hearts, nine of diamonds. He rolled his eyes, replacing the five. Justin smirked at him, as did Hermione on her next turn. He managed to pick up a jack of clubs as well, but Hermione knocked on her next turn. “Suck on that one.”
Unable to contain whatever longing he was feeling, he typed, ‘
‘Always.’
The dark-skinned boy nodded. “Yeah. He’s upstairs doing homework.”
“I’ve never been allowed to feel. Ever. Especially not when I needed to, or needed to talk, or whenever I wasn’t okay.” Draco’s stormy eyes searched Harry’s, as if begging him to understand what he was saying and why. “The last few years have been hell for me, too, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”
Ron was right. After another twenty minutes, they had just enough to fill the team circled around them. Ron would keep his position as keeper; Ginny, Dean Thomas, and Demelza as chasers; and Jimmy Peakes and their only new student, second-year Maya Lyle, as beaters. Everyone but Maya were clad in their uniforms, so Harry instructed Ginny to take her back to the changerooms and get her one. She also didn’t have a broom, and so would need to borrow one of the school brooms.
Ron chuckled. “Come on, mate. Let’s go upstairs. Maybe we’ll get some work done up there where it’s quiet. Wanna work on the potions together?”
“Yeah…”
Harry rolled his eyes, picking up a seven of clubs. Then Justin pulled a card, stared Hermione right in the eyes, then cried, “31!”
The three of them grinned and Hermione spoke up. “What else should we try, Professor?”
Outside the curtains, the boys sat on the beds surrounding Draco’s. The adrenaline surge had kept them awake, unable to fall back asleep right away. They’d sat in small groups, lost in their own thoughts. No one spoke in the stunned silence, but the looks on their faces told that they were all thinking the same thing. It was only then that the majority of them had realized how much pain Draco was really in, especially when they heard him break down. They were all uncomfortable and shaken, hardly able to believe that that terrified, pained sound could come out of Draco… the boy they’d all thought to have it all. Maybe as a child… but during the last few years… no one really knew. But here he was, in pain and breaking down. None of them had heard anyone else in near as much mental pain… aside from Harry. They sat watching the shadows behind the curtains, listening to Harry’s incoherent voice through Draco’s cries, and praying for the heart-wrenching sobs to cease.
“I guess I would know, Crabbe and Goyle did follow me around for seven years.”
As the bridge came to an end, Harry stepped further into the room, leaving the other two staring from the doorway. “Amen,” Harry belted, causing Dean and Michael to look up at him with shocked smiles. He danced over to them as Seamus hopped off his bed and followed.
“Hello. I was saying that we all know who they are, and a lot of the others, too.”
“Argeynt, Alice!”
“Not really. I’m sure it won’t be too bad. It’ll be weird being back in class, though.”
“No. Well, overall, no. But right now, yes. I think he’s okay right now.”
Harry slipped off his bed, grabbed his toothbrush from his trunk, then headed to the bathroom. As told by the large clock on the far wall, they still had plenty of time to get ready and eat breakfast. All of the boys who weren’t showering were in the room, chatting and changing.
“You don’t have to say that if it’s not true. We all went through stuff. We’ve all seen death, seen torture, felt pain, lost people… I’m not okay sometimes…”
“I’m fine.”
“NO!”
Draco’s eyes ignited with fury. “What the fuck, Harry? You can’t just—you
The Gryffindor rolled his eyes. “I’m Dean. I really love football, and I’m dating Seamus. But you all knew that already so, uh… I am actually really good at Ancient Runes even though I hate it with a passion.” He looked down to the floor at the next person.
You’re not my type.” Ron’s mouth dropped open as Draco turned back to Harry. “What were you asking me?”
Dean glared at him. “He’s not going to lash out! Can you hear him? Do you know where that—”
“Of all people,” said Ron. “Harry, you should totally mess with him!”
Harry searched the room for Malfoy, but he was nowhere to be seen. At the same moment, Blaise passed Harry on his way out, seemingly amused by Harry’s search.
His fork froze on the way to his mouth as he thought about it. “Now
“Which one is which way?” Neville asked.
Draco nodded, straining to keep a semi-straight face. “It already is,” he mumbled under his breath, but Harry still caught it.
“No it’s not,” Draco whispered. “It’s not your fault, Harry.”
Ron shrugged, looking behind him at Harry and Neville for their opinions. Neville contemplated it before speaking. “He probably wants us to stay used to it, instead of getting rusty, or avoiding it altogether. The longer we wait, the more nervous we will get. You know?”
Her eyes widened. “He said that?”
Hermione shut the paper with a shake of her head. “I guess not.”
Not thirty seconds later, a message lit up Harry’s screen. ‘Huh, so we might know each other.’
“How?” asked Malfoy, examining the pencil.
Ned smiled at her, then turned to look behind him at other students. “And that’s Draco Malfoy. None of us want to mess with him, we were all saying that outside. He’s evil.”
“Yeah,” he said, a little jittery. “Just, er… give me a second.”
Then one from Dudley, to Harry’s surprise asking him how the start of his year had been going so far. They had made up and caught up in the summer, and had taken to talking on the phone once in a while. Dudley hadn’t lied to Harry before he’d left that day—he didn’t think he was a waste of space. He had apologized to him, and asked him what it was like, being a wizard. What the war was like. He seemed fascinated, but also worried. Harry could tell, even though Dudley just laughed it off.
But he probably wouldn’t do it. He thought that he was just talking to some random guy who was giving him advice. And he had very particular opinions about Harry.
Harry slid onto the bench in the Great Hall beside Ron and pulled out his phone.
As he finished his plate, he glanced over all of their work materials. “What are you all working on?”
“Shut it, Ron,” Harry laughed, shoving his pillow at him. He ducked as he began speaking, the pillow flying back over his head. “I don’t know how to explain them all, but there’s a variety.”
Harry shook Ron’s shoulder, and when he turned, agitated, Harry pointed at the growing flame. Ron shook Seamus, and he and Dean too were soon staring at the flame. Professor Flitwick called out in shock as it began eating at the stack of books he was standing on. With a gasp, Hermione turned and shot a jet of water at it, but it wasn’t enough. Flitwick tumbled off the stack into the row of seats on the other side of the class. Hermione jumped down the rows with a few other students, who were trying to put the fire out.
‘Can’t tell u that. U will know who I am. Just trust me.’
“I don’t know if he knew it was you or not, at first. But he’s definitely not fine, judging on what happened. Frankly, I’m not sure if he cared that it was you once he found out. It wasn’t really characteristic of him. But war… I guess.”
Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes, only picked at his potatoes, scowling at the hunk missing, but said nothing. Harry cleared his throat. “Hermione wants to know if you’ll come study Ancient Runes with her later?”
Harry awoke suddenly to the shaking of his arm, a dark figure in his dream quickly receding into the depths of his subconscious. He blinked up at a blurry silhouette, the outline of which he could barely see against the darkness of his curtains.
‘Me too! R u on ur house team?’
Malfoy quirked his head. “Then where does the ink come from? It’s… muggle… right? So it can’t be…”
me. Never have. So for the love of Merlin, just leave me alone.” Ron only stared at him. “
“I did my best… but he fell when we were climbing… And after we left, trying to get us out of there unscathed.”
Hermione’s bushy hair bounced as she threw her head back with a laugh. “You should’ve seen the look on her face! She was furious! It was war at that point. I ducked off the side of my bed when objects that weren’t pillows started flying past my head. I lost my place in my book, but it was actually quite fun. I enjoyed myself. I think we all kind of called a truce by the end. Especially when we had to lump all of our belongings in the middle of the room at the end to sort it together because everything was mixed up.”
Draco nodded and squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “G’night, Harry.” He turned and slipped out from the curtains to find the boys who were still up gawking at him. “What?” He followed their gaze down to his chest, where his grey shirt was dark with Harry’s tears. Now they all knew he’d been holding Harry while he broke down… and surprisingly, he didn’t care that they knew. He raised his brows. “What’s your point?”
And he had a good chance of being able to find out what was up.
‘Okay fine, then I won’t tell you who I am, either.’
. Not anymore. So… I don’t know. It’s funny that now of all times I catch a glimpse of that side of him.”
“The name’s Seamus. I’m notorious for blowing shit up and I’m gay! All you need to know really.”
Harry took this in, and realized where Draco’s sudden fear of snakes had come from. Living with Voldemort, he’d know all about what that snake could do. Had probably seen Nagini kill or maim on more than one occasion, and then had her around the house constantly. Harry pointed his wand at it and said, “
Ron shook his head. “Nah. Don’t think the decision will be very hard for you this year, Harry.”
“Please forgive me! I never wanted any of this!”
Hermione eyed her with an amused smile as she swallowed a mouthful of toast. “We’ve found that out.”
“Gerroff, Ferret!”
“He was taunting Malfoy,” Harry added. “Then everyone else joined in… it was a mess.”
He shrugged. “Contrary to popular belief, I’m not a stupid fuck.”
“How did you know it was him screaming…?”
With that he put his phone away and returned to his essay. A few moments later footsteps pattered down the stairs and over to the table. Draco strode towards them, a book and supplies under his arm, still wearing his school uniform, minus the robes. Harry removed his bag from the chair next to him and put it between his feet. He sat down, mumbled a hi to Harry, and looked across the table to Hermione. “You wanted to study Ancient Runes?”
“How could it even affect him? He just hid out with his family the entire time,” said Seamus.
Hi everyone! I hope that you enjoyed this chapter. I will probably do a lot of writing over the next few weeks so I hope to update more! Let me know your thoughts. Until next time, Emma :)
“I—I wish I could’ve done something… I was a coward.”
he thought. Himself and Ron returned to their homework for another twenty or so minutes before Ron spoke up again. But this time he wasn’t asking Harry and question. He was asking Malfoy. And it wasn’t about potions. “Say, Malfoy?” The blond glanced up without moving his head, brows raised. “Why aren’t you teasing us yet? I mean, you always do and now…”
Wednesday had been a hard day for Harry. He’d spent more time than he’d like to admit standing in front of the portraits of Lupin, Tonks, and Fred. They were beginning to emit some sounds, and Harry had taken to reading their lips. Lupin had been proud of him, as was Tonks. Fred did some sort of miming that Harry had chuckled at but not fully understood. He’d even meandered over to see the portrait of Colin Creevey, who flashed a huge smile as Harry stood in front of the small 16-year-old who would never age another year. Though it felt good at the time to see these people, he couldn’t push them and their sacrifices from his thoughts.
“Do you think they’ll help?”
“But you, er… you never saw that, yeah?”
“You did a piss poor job of it. We both ended up bloody and almost killed by both sides. You’re bloody pathetic.”
‘I don’t want to talk about it.’
Malfoy must’ve take some time to think about his answer, because Harry was able to finish three questions before the answer popped up on his screen. ‘I don’t wanna come out. No one tries to make me. Its easier to hide from ppl now than to face them.’
“Obviously, the three unforgivables. But a few more dangerous ones I can think of are the entrail-expelling curse,  obliviate, transmogrify… sectumsempra… and… fiendfyre.”
Draco waved to Blaise over Harry’s shoulder as he headed past them to the stairs, then turned back to Ron. “Doesn’t matter.”
Dean scoffed. “Merlin, Harry. Spend less time laughing at Ron and watch her. She’s an amazing flyer. She was showing Jimmy a few of her moves during practice.”
“I was a coward.”
“It’s a talent,” he laughed. “But obviously, this one wasn’t me. Seemed to be coming from one of the seventh years at the bottom.”
Harry shuddered as the door swung shut, the thoughts ghosting over him and mingling with his reality. He held his hand up in front of him, surveying his fingers. He flipped it over and stared at his palm, then dropped it, startled by the crackling of the fire. After extinguishing it, Harry took a deep breath, then hurtled up the stairs.
Ron snorted. “You have to get passed me first, you know?”
“Ned, got it. I’m Faith.”
Harry stared into them, quirking his head. “That would have been a shame.” Then he shook his head and took a step back, as if he’d revealed an embarrassing, intimate part of himself.
Dean gulped, looking back at the shadows behind the curtain. “I’ve heard that before.”
Harry looked around the table at his friends, who seemed torn between actively listening and pretending like they weren’t. “We’re more alike than you think. A pawn in the war, our futures being decided for us when we were only children, not wanting what was being handed to us and then having it shoved down our throats. Just on different sides in the battle.”
“Yeah.” At Blaise’s expectant look he continued. “Honestly. I was a bit rattled at first, but I’m alright. Why do you keep checking on me?”
Draco’s blood ran cold. If he lied, would they know? No, they couldn’t… they’d been at practice. And seeing as Blaise wasn’t around to call him out… “No, I’ve already eaten. But thank you.”
“Okay. I understand.”
Draco only stared at him, mouth slightly open, pulling his arms tightly against his body. “What?”
Harry turned to the boys. “How the fuck did someone manage that?” He stood as they did, pushing their chairs in to exit the room. Harry looked at Seamus, who was being nudged by Dean. “How the fuck do
!” Then he cast tallentalegra, and Ron was doing a jig. It was amusing, Ron’s scowl and shaking head in contrast to the cheerful dancing.
Harry rolled his eyes, piling eggs onto a piece of toast. “I think most of us think that. Especially Malfoy.”
Both teams got in their positions. Harry rose above the rest of them, Draco across from him, waiting for Hermione to yell ‘go’ at Seamus. Once she did, and he released the balls, the Slytherin chasers were off to the races, the Gryffindor chasers blocking them to the best of their abilities. Ron blocked a quick shot, knocking the quaffle to Demelza, who passed it to Dean, who passed it to Ginny. Daphne quickly won it back after Goyle sent a bludger Ginny’s way, and Daphne dropped it to Blaise beneath her. Jimmy nodded at Maya, who held the bat in a shaking hand, swung the incoming bludger, and knocked it straight at Blaise, who tucked up and rolled, but lost the quaffle, dropping it to Dean. Harry smiled as he watched, nodding at Maya’s quick learning from Jimmy. Dean sped through the Slytherin chasers and tossed the quaffle to Ginny, who tucked it in the left hoop. Hermione and Seamus cheered.
“A bit of both,” said Harry, rubbing his neck. “I didn’t know what to do. I remember dropping next to him in the bloody water, no clue how to fix it. He was bleeding out right in front of me, and the look on his face… God. Ron, I don’t ever want to see that look on his face again. I don’t care who he is.”
Harry held a hand up as Blaise sighed, staring at the empty spot next to him. “Guys, I know we don’t all get along… but we can’t do that. We have to live together for the next year, so that means we all have to make it work.” He turned to Blaise. “What was that about?”
“Stop that!” Harry glared as Draco snorted, then shook his head as he headed back to his bed. He glanced back over at the other boy. “Night, Malfoy.”
“Cool.” Dean turned to look backwards over his shoulder at the rest of the room. “OI! All you lads, yeah, Ernie, you too. Come sit over here with us. We’ve got some Weasley products to try out and some weird candies to help us make fun of each other.”
“Harry, I think you’re thinking of hair dye,” chirped Hermione.
Harry smiled as he locked his phone, slipping it into his pocket. He returned to eating, shoving a good chunk of his second sandwich into his mouth. He and Ron goofed around, wagging their sandwich-stuffed mouths at Hermione, who scowled. She rolled her eyes, stabbing a strawberry with her fork. It backfired though, splashing her blouse with juice. She stared down at it disappointedly before using a spell to clean it. The boys suppressed their laughter, biting their tongues until she looked back up. “Let’s go to class.”
“What’s a pen?”
Harry swallowed thickly; eyes fixed on the boy in front of him. “We all went through a war… Just like you said the other day.”
Dinner passed quickly and soon the trio were heading back to the common room. Their footsteps echoed off of the walls as they jogged up the steps, secretly happy that they no longer had to worry about them moving. They had stayed longer at dinner than most of the other eighth years, and the common room was bustling when they walked in.
“Surprisingly well, actually,” Harry smiled. “You?”
He did as Harry said, then, “Huh.” He twiddled it between his fingers. “What else do muggles have?”
“I’m sorry… I didn’t mean—”
“Then why—”
“N-no,” Ron stuttered, alarmed by both his response and the warning look he received from Harry. “I was just curious…”
Harry scrutinized the screen. ‘
While Pansy and Hermione played, Blaise read, and Ron took a trip to the bathroom, Harry pulled out his phone. It opened on his messages from dinner, the ‘Hey,’ still lingering at the bottom of the screen from Monday. he'd never responded, feeling awkward about starting a conversation, even though Malfoy had no idea it was him... but the last two days he'd found himself wondering. Out of curiosity of where this might lead, Harry typed back.
“Mate,” Harry laughed. “It took you seven years.”
Harry dropped his hand and looked him in the eyes. “Why?”
Harry sang and danced, causing Draco to laugh and try and keep up with Harry’s unconventional moves. Happiness, for the first time in years, seeped from him. Ran through his veins and showed itself in the crinkles by his eyes, the full sound of his laughter. It was addictive, seeing Draco like that, and Harry found himself deciding that he wanted to continue to make him this happy. Seeing him happy was addictive, and he craved it, every time he caught a glimpse. But moreover, he wanted to be the
It didn’t make any sense. The boy had seemed fine not two minutes ago… Maybe it was someone else? Maybe they had nicked themselves…? But Harry knew that wasn’t it. It had been Malfoy, and somehow, that unsettled him even further. Had it been him when he’d seen blood a few days ago? And if so… why?
Faith turned to Harry. “He’s right. I know that you three saved the Wizarding World. That’s Neville Longbottom over there… he killed the bird!”
Harry shook his head, which was buried in Ron’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry.”
. I’m gunna make your life a living hell. Got it?”
“Told you,” said Ron. “Flirting.”
Harry laughed out loud. “No! And I don’t plan for him to.”
In the doorway, Ron looked over at Draco with a chuckle. “Sometimes I forget he understands all of the muggle pop-culture. He was really sheltered, but I guess he would have learned it over the summers and at school before he came to Hogwarts. Before he knew he was a wizard.”
Harry stifled his laugh and pointed his wand at the vinegar. A burst of air came out his wand and Ron had to catch the goblet, glaring at Harry. Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “I guess I need more practice.” Ron rolled his eyes, but grinned as he turned away, trying once more.
Harry made to stand, but Blaise waved him off. He jogged after him. “Draco!”
“Just stop.” There were tears in his eyes, Harry could see them from their proximity, but he held them back as he spoke. Malfoy returned to his book.
“Scared of some sweets, Malfoy?” Goyle boomed. “Doesn’t seem to be the only thing you cower away from.”
He grew impatient, throwing his arms up. “Then what is it, then? Huh?”
‘That’s good to hear. And no… I’m not really into girls.’
After dinner the trio returned to their dorm. Hermione and Ron left to find a table to spread their books and papers out on and begin research for their newly assigned essays. Harry, thinking of his forgotten book by his bed, assured them he’d be right back, and
Harry and Ron took their seats in the Great Hall while there was barely anyone there. Draco sat alone at the Slytherin table, a few Hufflepuffs were eating cereal at their table, and Ned and Faith sat together down the other end of the Gryffindor table, chatting over their pancakes. McGonagall gave Harry a questioning look as she talked to Professor Flitwick, and glanced over at Draco with the same one. Harry followed her gaze, momentarily wondering why he was up so early, especially after the events of the previous night. The thought quickly left, however, as Harry remember the troubles the other boy had with sleeping.
“Do you remember the nightmare you had? And how I sat with you until you calmed down?”
“I’m just kidding with you.” He smiled, a breathy laugh escaping. “Not many people know but I’ve always been right behind Hermione in grades, and I genuinely enjoy school. Though, I’m really not enjoying the arse-kicking I get every single year, thank you very much.”
He huffed, staring back at his knees. “Stop...”
Harry blinked at the message, then typed, ‘
Harry snorted, only nodding in response.
Harry and Ron both sighed with relief when they saw their trunks beside each other. Their beds were made up with scarlet blankets and golden pillows—curtains hanging above scarlet as well. Harry flopped onto his bed on his stomach, staring both ways to the ends of the long room. His bed sat almost directly in the middle of the room on the one side. The two long walls were spanned with beds, eight on Harry’s side, seven on the other. The walls of the room were grey, but the colours of the bedding and the hardwood floors made it feel much more welcoming. A smile tugged at Harry’s lips as he watched the other boys find their beds and belongings. It was good to be back, despite everything.
“Yeah,” she said, supressing a grin. “Does he have any idea who it is?”
With an eye-roll Hermione glanced over at it then scoffed. “Yeah, okay, Pansy. Whatever you say.”
Hermione grinned before moving her bag so Pansy could sit. “Of course.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Do you ever shut up?”
of that wondrous smile that he seldomly saw these days. Harry wanted to be the reason behind it.
There was a pause for a few moments as Harry scrawled the answer to the first question from his potions homework down on a piece of parchment. His eyes flit back and forth between his book and his paper, drops of ink dotting his path. He cursed, removing them with his wand, then checked his phone when it lit up. ‘Its an escape’
Harry chewed on his lip, setting his phone face down on the table. Hermione looked up at him, then over at Ron who was playing a game. She rolled her eyes. “Are you guys going to do any work?”
Outside the curtains some of the boys had tried to go back to bed, but a few still stood nearby. Ron sat on Blaise’s bed, with Seamus and Dean nearby. Neville, Justin, and Ernie were still there as well. Ron and Blaise looked at each other, wondering if they were both thinking the same thing.
“Ah, don’t give me that! You’re not sorry you little minx, and you know it!”
“How did you get him to calm down? He was practically hysterical.”
She blinked at him. “I didn’t even know that was a class.”
Hermione laughed. “You’re just thinking about this now?”
“Right.”
As the two girls walked away, Harry turned to the rest of the team. “Alright everyone, welcome back to another year of Quidditch! I sure missed it last year and am happier than ever to be back on the pitch. Ginny will be my assistant captain this year, and will likely take over for me once I graduate. Does anyone have any questions?”
He was startled from his thoughts as Harry went silent. He tuned back in. “Draco?”
“Huh?” He jerked his head up to stare at Hermione. “What?”
She went back to her reading, presumably more Ancient Runes as she was translating something for Ron. He hummed and then asked her, “Say, did you ever figure out that rune that was giving you and him a hard time the other day?”
Harry cleared his throat, changing the course of the discussion. “Did you do much flying over the summer?”
“No, I’m not!” She gave him a stern look and he rolled his eyes with a groan. “If you or Ron say one more time about sixth year—”
“Clearly.” Both boys heads whipped to the side as Hermione slid in beside Ron, dropping her bag on the seat. “Before, you two
“Well stop.”
After about a half-hour, Harry was tired of keeping a constant eye on his wobbling ink well. He banished it. “Accio, pen,” he muttered. A black ballpoint pen zoomed from his trunk and into his waiting hand. He clicked it, then began writing once more. After a few moments, however, he glanced up after feeling like he was being watched. And he was right. Both Malfoy and Ron were staring at him. “What?”
Neville stared at the curtains, then back at the group. “I see what you mean.”
“I never did thank her,” Harry said quietly. “For saving me. I feel bad.”
She rolled her eyes. “Wipe that smirk off your face, Malfoy, and take the compliment.” He only laughed as he watched her attention shift to Harry. Within seconds his hair was a light brown, which oddly suited him. Hermione’s eyes widened as she took him in. “That actually looks good on you!”
He looked away. “Vaguely.”
Hey all! I hope that you enjoy this chapter. Let me know your thoughts. The next chapter is coming soon. Until next time! -Emma :)
Blaise looked at Harry, eyes pleading. Harry interjected. “Everyone, shut up!” The boys all turned to him, startled. “You guys don’t know anything about the behind the lines of the war, okay? I’m not going to go into it, but I owe him my life. And his mother. Now, we’ve been rivals the entire time we’ve known each other, but if I can play fair, so can all of you! We have to stick together… you need to understand that. This year is about moving past everything. Inter-house friendships and cooperation.”
“You… what?”
“Well, one day Voldemort got very angry… I think he suspected he was trying to help me. He used the curse on Draco in front of me and I realized it was the same scream I’d been hearing for months. After that I always knew when they were using it on him. You could hear him, even when he was on the upper levels. His Mother, too. She was never cruel to me, but some of them were to her. I suppose she wasn’t mean enough for them.”
DADA has the class duelling, revealing the struggles of some of the students. Harry has quidditch practice, and then he, Ron, Dean, and Draco have some fun.
“What about the snitch?” Hermione asked.
She stared at him for a minute as if wondering how thick he really was. Then she pursed her lips and turned back to the cauldron. “Nevermind.”
Slughorn almost instantly set them to work, saying he’d be coming around to check on their progress. They could work in pairs if they chose to, so Harry and Hermione decided to work together.

I am also doing one-shot commissions for multiple fandoms right now so if you are interested, leave me a comment and I will send you the link to a google form!
