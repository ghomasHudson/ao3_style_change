“Precisely. You see, Blaise is throwing a party. He’ll be thirty-two and he’s decided to celebrate his old age in a typically flamboyant fashion. And I need… Well, I need a date. Preferably a famous one. Who isn’t hideous.”
"Indeed," he agreed. He darted out his tongue to capture the drops of liquid that spilt over the brim of the glass, eyes flicking up and skittering over the party guests only to land on a bright green pair already fixed on him. Draco's heart stuttered to a halt in his chest.
you manage to get this banged up by doing desk work because unless you’ve had a run-in with a mad possessed stapler, then I think you’ve got some explaining to do!”
"This is very embarrassing," Draco said, leaning in. "But, you see, the love of my life is in London, and this is the last Portkey to the UK tonight. If I don't get there, it's all over. He'll find someone else, and that will be the end of it."
Potter snorts again and holds out his hand. Draco takes it limply in his own and then feels the familiar tug behind his navel before they’re dropped outside his store. It’s a perfect landing, and Draco has never wanted to punch Potter more.
"Admit it," Harry said, the lilt in his voice teasing enough to take the edge off the devastation of the truth. "You care about me."
Weasley gestured towards a storage case pressed up against one wall, empty aside from a couple of outdated magazines, a basic potions encyclopedia, and an ugly vase. But the case itself was bloody
Emile leaned against the iron railing of the patio as Draco cast an Impervius Charm to protect them from the drizzle. Draco cracked the window so he could monitor his potion and hear if the thing exploded again
Potter smirks, though he’s watching Eddy attempt to wear every item of the Lacroix 1998 collection simultaneously. “So you can relate?”
“Afraid I might be... up to something?” Draco goaded, which probably wasn’t wise. But there was just something about Potter that begged Draco to poke at the bear through the bars — some nearly forgotten instinct that rose to the surface whenever Draco stood in throttling distance.
"No, I'm worried about having to go back and edit out all the bits where you talk about my cock. Now —" Potter lifted his hand off the quill, and it returned to its ready position. "Your
"Oh, fuck." Draco's knees promptly went out, and he threw out a hand towards the bedpost to keep from crumpling to the floor. Potter hummed, amused, then swallowed Draco down to the hilt.
So, Draco did the only thing he could: he took off after him. He was only a breath away from Potter, nearly close enough to touch, but not quite. The wind was painfully cold against Draco's face and his eyes streamed, but he barely noticed it. He threw his entire body into the pursuit, willing the broom to go just a little faster.
Those sorts of spells simply weren't used in modern magic. It was the ancient type of spell work referred to only as the
Harry nodded. "It's very… you." His fingers smoothed down the fabric of the jacket all the way to the single button done at Draco's waist. Then, he dropped his hand and looked back up into Draco's eyes.
Draco had every intention of binning everything that Noah left behind, but Pansy insisted he let her sift through it for anything valuable.
"Pans, stop. I don't want to talk about it." He dropped the Prada wingtips into the suitcase next to the Ferragamo’s then strode across the room to collect the suit. He tried to shoulder Pansy aside to get to it, but she barely even teetered on her high heels.
They wouldn’t know if they’d been successful until the end of the week. They would supply Mary with healing potions and Muggle painkillers, though Draco anticipated very little discomfort. It was one bonus of threading magic into surgery. But even then, the potions, spells, and Mary’s body would need time to heal, and until that time, Draco and Marcus would have to wait.
“What happened? Couldn’t stand one more pair of pleat-front dockers in the closet?” Potter said with a smirk.
Potter hummed in that obnoxiously pleased little way. “That’s fair enough, I suppose. Then I guess it’s a good thing I’m patient.”
"I honestly don't remember," Harry said with a gasp as Draco's knuckles skimmed over his cock, already thick and straining against his pants. "I'm not sure I could remember my name right now."
“Thank you, Brian. Did you get a croissant? Help yourself, there’s plenty,” Marcus said, getting up from his chair to help the young man unload his items.
Draco shoved through the crowds to get to the counter, where an exhausted looking witch sorted through a box of junk that made up the evening's Portkeys.
Draco’s mouth tilted into a cruel smirk, a practised expression that felt more comfortable on his face than a smile. “Keeping tabs on me, Potter?”
Pansy paused, sighed, then held out her glass, tapping the rim. “I’m going to need you to top me off, love. I’m not nearly drunk enough for that conversation.”
Narcissa gave him a polite smile. Draco suspected she knew he was lying, but was too afraid to admit it, or too frightened of setting off her husband.
Of course, that meant Draco didn’t wake up until a quarter to noon to the sounds of the front desk ringing him. Draco barely managed a breath-freshening charm and a piss before the lift doors were sliding open and Harry Potter was standing there, looking a bit bewildered in dark scarlet robes, his magic filling the room like a physical thing.
Draco drained his glass of wine, went straight home, opened another bottle, and drained that one, too.
Blaise’s expression sobered slightly but was still tinged with exasperated fondness. “And this is London. You’ll have to tread a little lighter while you’re here, you know. They’ll be waiting for you to slip up again. They’d like nothing more than to tack you down for the first thing they can.”
"I love my job," Harry continued. "But there's come a point where I've got to quit while I'm ahead. I have things I want to live for. People I want to live for. And if I keep it up at this rate, I might not have as long with them as I'd like. After the last injury, which was one more in a series of injuries, it was recommended to me that perhaps I think about living, rather than just not dying."
The responding chuckle was the last thing he heard before burying his face in the pillow and falling asleep.
“I don’t need your judgement,  Potter. What are you doing here, anyway? Hanging around my flat, barely even invited. Do you think we’re friends now?” he snaps. But Potter doesn't flinch back like he hopes.
Potter stayed there, ear tilted to the wind, until his call was answered by a roar so loud Draco could feel the vibration from his feet to the top of his head. He blanched, the fear turning his blood to ice as they crested the next hill and the Jeep was engulfed in shadow. When Draco looked up, it was into the scaly underbelly of a massive dragon, wings outstretched and taloned feet curled up against its sides. It roared again, giving Draco a view of row upon row of knife-sharp teeth, as it sailed ahead and overtook them. There was a burst of wind as the dragon pumped its leathery wings, the acrid smell of sulphur and smoke thick in the air.
“Quite right,” Draco said, stepping back to start work on the bandages wrapped around Potter’s shoulder and down to his wrist. He held Potter’s elbow carefully as he unwound them. Potter’s arm fared well, for the most part. It was still marked with a smattering of scars, but the places that had been so horribly burnt only the day before were now covered with fresh skin. Draco nodded in satisfaction.
” Harry said as he braced himself with one hand on the back of both seats, and launched himself over the centre console. He dropped into the back seat with a huff.
“What have I ever done to deserve anything, Blaise? Honestly,” Draco said, fixing his eyes on where his hands were twisted in his lap.
Draco pushed his hands under Potter's t-shirt, his fingers skating over smooth skin and hard muscle. Potter's groan vibrated against Draco's lips, and Draco chased that gorgeous sound with a flick of his tongue. The fingers in Draco's hair tightened, and Harry pushed hard against him, aligning their bodies from hip to head. And gods, Draco thought he might catch fire. Potter's skin was so bloody warm, Draco worried he might be ash by morning.
Harry just looked at him, half wondering if Malfoy knew he was speaking aloud. But he must have because he turned to Harry, a soft but inquiring look on his face.
Draco frowned, hip leaned against the till, watching the open sign swinging once more as the door shut behind her. He withdrew his wand and unlocked the filing cabinet built into the service counter. He rifled through the folders, past the building deed and a dozen different permits, until he found the stack of resumes he'd received from parties interested in a position at his shop. He flipped through them, pulling a few promising options from the pile. He would need to hire backup for Eryn. Draco didn't know what he was thinking, expecting her to do it all on her own. Not everyone wanted to sacrifice their lives for the job. And he wouldn't always be here to cover her day off as he’d be back in France soon enough. It made perfect sense, and he felt a fool for not considering it sooner.
Potter stood, his palms flat on the desk and fires flashing behind his eyes. "And when that day comes, I'll be ready. I came to terms with that well before I took this job. I know the consequences."
responsibility to put yourself into the line of fire? Quite literally this time, I might add. One of these days, your luck is going to run out and you won’t be able to just saunter out because you’ll be dead, Harry.
“Luna told me Malfoy came to your house after your accident,” she said. Her brows were pinched together, but the expression on her face was inscrutable.
Draco slipped a thigh between Potter's legs to press against the steely hard length of him trapped behind the zipper of his jeans. Potter pulled back with a gasp, and Draco opened his eyes. Potter's lips were red and swollen, shining slightly. He looked wrecked and beautiful and wild, the way he always did in Draco's dreams and nightmares alike.
Emile chuckled, and the deep sound, rich as melted chocolate, made Draco shiver, which only made Emile laugh more. He spun Draco around.
Draco rounded the desk and perched on the edge, one foot flat on the floor and the other hanging in the air. He leaned in just a touch. “I’m a very busy man.”
“But I left a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. And I wouldn’t be opposed to a glass of that about now,” Draco said with a waggle of his eyebrows.
He was right when he said Harry likes it rough, likes it desperate, likes it when they beg. He does. But he’s never heard begging sweeter than Draco’s, with that deep voice and posh little accent. It’s so fucking filthy and wrong and it makes him so hard. There are nights when Harry drags it out for ages, for as long as he can possibly stand, until Draco is practically weeping, cock dripping precome across his skin or Harry’s sheets. But Draco will be lucky this time, Harry decides. He isn’t going to make him wait. He can’t.
"Draco, my darling." Her voice was too soft, raspy and worn. She bent her head to press her lips against his limp hand, and Draco could feel the dampness on her cheeks.
Potter’s hand was so close to his cock and Draco wanted desperately to feel it wrapped around him. He was aching and it
Since then, Draco hadn't let another man inside his body. It never felt right — too intimate, too vulnerable — but this wasn't just some Muggle prick he'd stumbled upon in a bar. This was
But it was too late now. Pansy wouldn't let him step from her fancy sitting room until she knew the truth, and Draco almost thought it might be a relief to free himself from the burden of his long-kept secrets. And things were different now, weren't they? Pansy was still the same wicked, cutting woman he'd known most of his life. But it was as if her sharpest edges had been filed down — smooth to the touch, but still able to slice you open, if you pressed hard enough.
Harry threw an arm around his shoulder and they stumbled up the stairway, Draco’s nose tucked into Harry’s neck as he dismissed his usual fortress of wards with a casual wave of his hand. They went sprawling through the front door, a tangle of limbs.
“You, Harry Potter, are an utter hypocrite!” Draco said, pointing at Harry with the lit end of a cigarette. “How you ended up working in Magical Law Enforcement is probably the biggest oversight in Ministry history. If I’d only known back then.”
Draco shot a worried look at the door. He had some rapport with Lovegood, had patched her up his fair share of times while he was still a trainee. She seemed to have a penchant for dangerous magical creatures, and the wherewithal of a newborn kneazle. But he hadn’t seen her in Mungo's in ages, and never in the Intensive Care ward.
Draco snatched it from where it landed on his chest and held it close to his face, examining every inch.
"I never do," Draco replied, turning the handle of his broom in the direction the Snitch disappeared, and took off.
Draco's heart clenched. It just tightened until it hurt — and then it burst, expanding and blooming and suffusing him in warmth.
“The gala? How is it coming along? Are you asleep on your feet, Potter? Please don’t fall over in the suit. It might wrinkle.” It won’t. Draco has included three layers of spells to prevent it.
Potter chuckled and shook his head. "Trust me, Malfoy. If I was threatening you, you'd know it. Now —" He gave the book another little shove in Draco's direction. "Read. Please."
She remembered him from that day in the A&E, but she seemed relieved that he didn’t ask her any further questions about it.
Draco slumped against a wall and swallowed hard, breathing heavily as he stared up into the light fixtures that ran down the ceiling, willing his eyes to focus.
“I’m just saying, you can be scary as fuck when you want to be, what, with the wandless, wordless magic. You do realize how rare that is, right?”
George leaned against the mantle. “Ginevra, dear, you know perfectly well, if Aunt Iris and Cousin Beatrix are within spitting distance of each other they’ll be throwing plates before supper is served! I’ll not have the good china ruined!” George said, his voice trilling and shrill, a near-perfect impersonation of Molly Weasley.
Draco tried to take solace in the fact that Harry likely wouldn't die, but he wasn't sure that this was better. He didn't like the way Harry looked, limp and lifeless, all the colour drained out of him. It was unsettling. Difficult to reconcile with the Harry Draco knew. Raging, and laughing, mussing his hair and exploding magic everywhere.
Draco clicked his tongue at him while Harry munched away at his doughnut. There was frosting at the corner of his mouth, and if Marcus would fuck off already, Draco was going to lick it off.
Potter laughed, but there was no humour in it. It was too dry, too ragged, too bloody pained. He shook his head, eyes still downcast. “I can’t stop thinking about it. About you.” He looked up then, and straight at Draco, his eyes bright and his mouth twisted into something between a grimace and a sad smile. “I’m fucked up, Malfoy.”
And there it was, not far in the distance, a little stone cabin with lights on either side of the door — a door that was opening, spilling lamplight into the black ink of night. Draco took a few wobbly steps forward, one hand still pressed against his chest, and the other clutching his aching head. He thought he walked forward — he must have — because the next thing he knew, Potter was there, barefoot in jeans and t-shirt, hands on Draco’s shoulders. He looked puzzled at first, eyes scanning Draco’s face and clothes, then widening.
"This right here," Draco hissed, his voice low and dangerous. "This is the reason I'm here. It's because I have nowhere else to go. And if that means I go home with a bartender or some other bloke I just met, it's because I want to get fucked. So, tell me, Potter. Who do you know that wants to fuck a Death Eater?"
Harry is fit. He’s long since grown out of the gangling, knobby-kneed boy Draco grew up hating. He’s taller, for one. And he’s gained the wiry sort of muscle that lingers just beneath the skin, the sinews twisting every time Harry holds his wand or reaches up to get something off a high shelf, shirt rucking up at his waist. Harry doesn’t treat Draco with the same animosity as before. They joke around in a way that might be misconstrued as flirting, if Draco wasn’t… well…
what football is. And you're wrong. It's horribly boring. Absolutely nothing happens, no one scores, and they're always rolling around in pain every time the ball comes anywhere near them. Poor bastards wouldn't last five minutes against a Bludger. If they weren't so bloody fit, I'm not sure I would be able to make it past the first quarter of the game. But if Beckham wants to take his kit off and run around for two hours, I'm certainly not going to complain about it. In fact, it might be the only interesting part. Now, I did not come here to listen to you condescend me over the merits of Muggle sports. Do you have a case for me to look at or not?"
go home, back to his well-appointed flat and expensive sheets. He could drink espresso in the morning and perhaps read that new book that was gathering dust on his shelf. Or…
Harry blows a smoke ring that bursts on Draco’s face, which he bats away with another scowl that Harry finds sort of cute.
She shrugged. "It's not, really. But Luna likes these sorts of things, for whatever reason. And I figured Blaise would bully you into it."
“It isn’t like I couldn’t find a proper date, but I don’t have the time, energy, or desire to go through the agony of dating right now. But showing up to Blaise’s party unaccompanied would be… not ideal.”
In fact, there were very few corners of Harry’s life that the misery had not infiltrated. While it was nothing like the fear that permeated the years leading up to the Battle of Hogwarts, nor did it compare to the excruciating months of media circus that followed. No, this was different. It was a slow, creeping dread that manifested over a number of years – a slimy sickening pit in his stomach that only seemed to ache when he was alone in the dark.
Malfoy laughed and the sound resonated in Harry’s chest, causing it to bloom and expand with pleasure. “That may be true, but I’m counting on more than luck.”
Draco sighed and turned back towards Harry's room. Hermione and Weasley both looked up from their slumped huddle on the sofa. They looked exhausted, the circles under their eyes bruise-dark and the skin on their faces swollen and raw. But they'd changed clothes — Ron out of his bloodied uniform into a pair of joggers and a clean t-shirt, and Hermione into leggings and an oversized hoodie with the Holyhead Harpies logo on it, which could only mean Ginevra had been through at some point. Stacked next to them on a cheap plastic side table in a bubble of stasis charms were glass containers of what appeared to be enough casserole for a small army. Hermione cradled one of the containers in her lap, two forks sticking out of it, though neither she nor Weasley were eating.
Harry casts the lubrication charm again and coats his cock, hissing at the drag of his own palm over sensitive skin. He gets it wet, absolutely dripping. They’re going to need it because Harry doesn’t fuck slow and easy.
Draco was lost, fevered, and sick. And when Harry tugged on his collar, pulling their mouths apart, Draco gulped in a breath, his mind swimming.
Sharing an office with Potter was a massive inconvenience and a source of endless distraction for Draco, mainly because Potter was a complete slob. There were paper cups of half-drunk tea scattered across his desk, and he left books open and piled atop one another. He had no identifiable filing system and had taken to charming the teetering stacks of parchment to keep them from tipping onto the floor. He had a myriad of unpleasant habits, such as propping his boots on the edge of the desk and giving Draco an unfortunate view of their dirty soles, while he read through papers with a crease between his brows. Potter sucked on the end of his quill when he was thinking and had a tendency to chew his bottom lip when annoyed about something.
. Harry loved Ron and Hermione’s place because of all the homey touches. The knick-knacks and collectibles that lined the mantle, the stacks of books, the half-played game of Wizard’s chess abandoned on the coffee table, the walls adorned with dozens of framed photographs of their friends and loved ones. A whole history of their lives together was there on display for anyone willing to look long enough to see it.
Draco felt odd. It wasn’t like he cared what Weasley thought of him, but Potter said they weren’t together. So what was he still doing living with him? And why did that make Draco’s lungs constrict painfully and his throat grow tight?
Potter sighed and dropped into the chair across from Draco and ran a hand through his already disastrous hair. “I tried to get out as soon as I could. Things got all fucked up, and the time zones were a confusing mess and—” He sighed again, and smiled a little sadly. “Sorry. Was it fun? Were you surprised?”
As if summoned, Draco heard the punctuated click of shoes in the hallway. The door swung open and Head Auror Gawain Robards strode in, flanked by a stony-faced Harry Potter.
“You’re lovely like this, you know. Desperate and wanting. Flushed,” he ran his fingers teasingly down Draco’s fevered chest. “I could do this all night. Do you think you could stand it?”
“I sent you an owl,” he says, muffled by his hands. “About the St. Mungo’s Foundation Gala at the hospital.”
Draco curled his fist around Harry’s erection and Harry gasped and bucked in response. He watched with hungry eyes as Draco stroked him slowly, his fingertips digging into Draco’s thighs. Draco kept his touch light, teasing, torturous.
That was the problem, Harry didn’t know what he wanted. He supposed he’d never really known. His life had been planned out for him by the time he was eleven, and before then, he didn’t even bother dreaming about a future. For Harry, the decisions were never really his own and as soon as the war ended, it was as if he’d been set adrift, bobbing along from day to day hoping they counted for something but never really sure that they did.
“There’s Eleanor, she works at the Ministry,” he muses and Pansy crinkles her nose. “Or Colette from the WWN? No, wait, she’s here with the drummer from the Hobgoblins. Oh! What about Daphne?”
Draco rounded the corner towards the Physical Damage Ward, then stopped dead in his tracks. There was a veritable army of gingers pacing anxiously between the waiting area and the hallway in front of Marcus’ surgery.
Draco hesitated then. He didn't want to finish the story. He hoped it didn't need to be said. Pansy was a clever girl; she could probably come to her own conclusions. But she just sat there in that strange silent state, her eyes trained on Draco. He took a deep, shuddering breath.
Later, though Draco couldn't pinpoint how long, Mark kissed him while they danced in the throng of bodies and Draco's heart fluttered, just a little.
Draco expected as much considering Lovegood was one of the first people he invited to his opening party, after Pansy, of course. Potter was second, before even Blaise and Greg, though Draco would never admit that to another soul so long as he lived. He also invited Hannah, and slipped an invitation under the doors of a few other shops in Diagon Alley. All in all, he'd invited close to thirty people. His doors were open and his sign hung bright and new over the doorway: Eden. It seemed an apt title, and he could credit Emile with the idea. Plus, it looked brilliant in his signature curling silver script.
Draco tilted his head to one side, admiring his handiwork for just a moment, then disappeared back into Blaise’s closet. He snagged a pair of charcoal coloured trousers from a hanger and threw them at Harry.
There, in a pub in Muggle London, Draco was just another bloke. And in that moment, Draco felt the first addicting frisson of freedom, as it filled his chest so rapidly it nearly left him gasping. Never once had Draco experienced true freedom. It was like flying, like the millisecond after Draco angled his broom towards the ground and the world hovered on the breeze before he plummeted towards the earth, leaving his stomach in the clouds.
Who knew Potter could look so edible in tight trousers and a well-tailored shirt, unbuttoned nearly to the waist with a tie hanging loose around his collar. If that was what Potter was hiding under all that scarlet, Draco had half a mind to send a complaint. He didn’t know to whom, exactly – the uniform designing department, the Minister of Magic, Potter himself – because honestly, it was a disservice to mankind. He was certain that a lot fewer criminals would skip their parole meetings if Potter walked around looking like
“Oh, Harry,” she said. “Everything is complicated if you let it be. But if there is anyone in this world who deserves them uncomplicated, it’s you. If you like him, why fight it?”
“What did I do now?” he snapped, throwing up his hands and nearly spilling his drink. “If this is about Potter, don’t worry. I’ve stayed away. I won’t be bothering him anymore. I have some pride, after all.”
It carries on that way, and when Potter emerges in Tom Ford, Pansy drools openly, and Draco clings to the last shreds of his professional dignity. By the time they’ve worked their way through the rack, Potter has amassed a hefty bill, and Draco concedes enough to offer him some jeans, which fit him so well Draco isn’t sure who he ought to thank first — Ralph Lauren, Potter’s fine genetics, or himself for thinking of it. In his infinite generosity, he even lets Potter pick out a few t-shirts, though they are a far cry from the faded and stretched rag he wore in.
One song bled into another as they danced. If you could call it dancing. It felt more like fucking. Hell, It felt more like making love than fucking usually did. It may have been twenty minutes; it may have been three hours, but eventually, Malfoy pulled away from him. He nodded with a jerk of his head toward the bar and Harry let himself be drawn from the crowd.
“No, I’m fairly certain total humiliation was the aim, but the table was probably a bonus.” Draco gestured at the bartender again, who delivered two more shots of tequila.
Draco placed one palm gently over Potter’s good eye, which Potter allowed, then dropped the hand at his chin to hold up three fingers.
"Thank you, Lovegood. I appreciate that," Draco said with a nod of his head. Lovegood beamed at him, her eyes squeezed shut and cheeks flushed from the champagne. Pansy had to keep her from careening into the sandwich board with the day's specials outside Sugarplum's Sweets Shop with a firm hand on her elbow.
He took Potter by the arm and all but dragged him across the party. Potter went willingly; jogging behind Draco, offering a few silly waves and a kiss on the cheek for Madam MacDougal.
"Well then, I'll leave you to it," she said, clutching her potion to her bosom. She leaned across the counter to kiss Draco on each cheek, and he took the opportunity to drop the galleon back into her pocket.
Narcissa's face pinched and her fingers tightened on the stem of her brandy glass. But she said nothing, and Draco didn't blame her, not much at least. It was useless arguing with Lucius when he was in a mood, and defending himself did about as much good as bashing his head against a wall. So, Draco took it for as long as he could stand it, which, as it turned out, was until exactly eight-thirty when Lucius fell into an alcohol-induced doze. Narcissa busied herself by bossing the elves around, giving clipped orders regarding the remodel of the dining room (her current pet project), which allowed Draco to slip out the front door unnoticed.
Draco groaned and slapped a hand over his eyes. “Ugh, Potter, that was dreadful. You should be embarrassed.”
“Oh, nicely done, Granger!” Pansy says, then turns back to Draco. “We’ll just meet you there, shall we?” She herds everyone out the door and pulls a slip of paper from the bodice of her dress. She places it on the side table, taps it once, then tucks a hand into the arse pocket of Blaise’s trousers and leaves with a wink.
“Excuse me, Mr Auror, could you just read me the cards on the table there and tell me if I won? I have an awful lot of galleons riding on this,” Draco drawled. It wasn’t the first time he’d been tossed around by some blow-hard trying to prove himself with a little unnecessary force.
"It figures you'd have a big cock," Draco said with a trace of a sneer. Because, honestly, of course he did. The universe was terribly unfair like that.
The pub was not Draco’s usual fare. It was the type of dark, dingy tavern that stunk of lager, replayed past Quidditch matches on the wireless, and boasted toilets with unknown health hazards. Draco much preferred the posh little tapas bars near his flat in Soho, or even a sleek cocktail do in Chelsea. But this was equal parts grimy, boring, and painfully heterosexual.
Draco can feel the heat of Potter’s gaze against his face like an open flame. Draco’s mother taught him it is rude to stare in such a way, and Potter should know it won't endear him to any of his potential sponsors or board members. It would make most people squirm and edge away, but it only makes Draco’s face and neck feel pleasantly warm and his stomach cramp a bit — but not in the way that hurts, more like the gentle tugging that he sometimes feels when he tastes fine wine, tries on Italian leather loafers, or watches Hugh Grant run fingers through his hair in that film on the telly with the American actress.
“If it’s a duel you’re aiming for, then I welcome the challenge. Somehow, I imagine your magical capabilities are bottom of the barrel, else you’d be working
Draco starts walking in the direction of home. It isn’t close, but it’s walkable so long as the weather isn’t shit, and Draco is far too drunk to Apparate.
“I didn’t realise it at first. Not until you were gone, and I was here alone and the packages arrived. God, dozens of them. I didn’t even know what half of them were. But then I started going through them and I remembered that this is the chair you said would be the best for reading in the winter. This coffee table was perfect because I wouldn’t be able to scuff it easily with my boots. The shelves are good for photographs. The kitchen table will seat at least six, eight if we’re friendly. You picked all of them. For me.”
"You're such a sap, Potter. And it hardly seems evenly matched. I haven't flown in years." Draco was loath to admit it, but it was better to come clean than allow Potter to see him floundering around in the air like a First Year.
“Why would we be hiding?” he said blandly, though his stomach tightened. He could practically see Pansy scenting the air, sniffing for blood.
“Could you imagine the publicity? If I could get Potter parading around in one of my designs, I’d be set for life. Could open a second location. Expand to the continent.”
Weasley led Draco out a door at the back of the kitchen, through a small garden patch with some of the most freakishly large vegetables Draco had ever seen.
“Enter,” he said, but kept his quill in hand and eyes on his papers. He was not presently on rotation and shouldn’t be disturbed. Whoever deigned to do so would incur some of Draco’s infamous ire.
"You sure about that?" Potter snapped, expression suddenly pinched. Then it cleared, though it seemed to do so with a bit of concerted effort. "And of course I like him. What's not to like?"
"Shit, forever. Since I was, like, twenty? It belonged to my godfather. Hagrid kept it in shape for me and then handed it off on my birthday. Nearly lost a limb or two learning to ride the damn thing. But I've grown attached to it after all these years." He patted the hulk of gleaming black metal like a loyal crup.
Draco’s attention was immediately drawn to the bandages on Harry’s arm, the way he favoured his weight on the left leg, the pink puckering of a recently healed cut on his cheekbone. All of Draco’s fear and anger abruptly came bubbling back to the surface. He stormed up the steps to stand in front of Potter and jabbed a finger into his chest accusingly.
Draco’s smile wilted somewhat, but managed to keep it from slipping entirely. He didn’t want her feeling sorry for him, especially since he was quite sure Mrs Marchbanks had been treated to her fair share of parties and lavish attention when she was young and vibrant.
“I’ll be seeing you, Potter,” she says with a flap of her hand. And then she’s gone, and they are alone.
The blurry edge of drunkenness eases and Draco shivers as a gust of wind cuts through the thin cotton of his shirt. He reaches for his wand, but before he can pull it from where it is tucked safely into the waistband of his jeans, he feels Harry’s warming charm slide over his shoulders like a cloak.
It happened quickly. There was a scuffle at the edge of the asphalt and suddenly, the perp was sprinting across the carpark with three others in pursuit, curses flying between them in blinding flashes of light.
Draco peered at Potter over the folder. "It's a stretch, if you ask me. But I'm not the Auror, you are. Show me the lists of what's been stolen."
Pansy takes his arm, the grip on his elbow tightening like a vice, but Draco doesn’t comment. He just holds her closer. They step through the doors and into the darkened room lit only by low-hanging Edison lamps and tangles of fairy lights, which were Draco’s addition (to warm all the concrete and chrome). They are enveloped in the scents of rich food and the passing clouds of expensive perfume. Corks pop in the background along with the clink of glasses, distant laughter, and quiet conversation.
Something welled in Draco’s chest that felt a bit like panic. It was too much, seeing Harry like that, to be at his mercy. It didn’t feel like sex with strangers or sex with friends. It felt like more. It felt like sex with Harry bloody Potter, and the weight of all that hate, jealousy, and fucking
Emile's mouth tightened, and he shook his head again. He had a point, of course. Adding wormwood to anything with an acidic compound was risky. That was why Draco had added the Lethe River Water to neutralise the acid and support cohesion. Emile was an excellent potion maker, but Draco was better. And Emile hadn't spent night upon sleepless night pouring over dusty texts and dull studies. Draco had even taught himself German to better understand the complex and intricate research on the similarities between Calming Draught and Draught of Living Death conducted by Albrecht Ziegler in 1842.
Harry vouched for him. And that didn’t hurt, of course. But Harry’s support was a quiet thing, because a whisper in his ear that he was doing
"C'mon mates, 'urry it up, will yeh? I'm full to burstin' 'ere!" The stranger shouted, pounding on the door with a fist.
He knew Malfoy would wait him out, but he didn’t really want to talk about it. He was going to get an earful from Robards when he went back to work the next day, and he had a feeling Malfoy wouldn’t be particularly pleased about it either. But when the silence stretched too long, Harry heaved a sigh.
Draco did recoil that time. "I —" He faltered, wanting for some reason to deny it. But Hermione was looking at him with an odd mix of discomfort and disappointment. Draco decided there was no way out but through. "Yes. I've seen him. In a professional capacity," he hurried to clarify. "He rather insinuated that it was on your recommendation."
Weasley lifted his head when Draco approached. His face was as twisted as Draco had ever seen it, blackened with dirt and striped with tears.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, okay.” He stood and took the bag from Marcus, digging around until he found what he wanted, and extracted some hideously frosted thing with colourful sprinkles. He dropped the rest of the bag into Draco’s outbox.
Potter looked down at the place where Draco’s fingers were wrapped around his wrist, and Draco pulled his hand back. The crease between Potter’s brows remained, but his posture eased as he relaxed back into his chair.
Harry dipped his chin and looked up at Draco through his lashes — a devastating move with which Draco was becoming all too familiar. “We’ve done far more unprofessional things than that.”
To his surprise, Draco's former classmates responded with guarded interest. Lovegood even cornered him while he attempted to procure another drink and insisted he give an interview to
But Potter just laughed and threw an arm over his face while the blasted sound wheedled its way between Draco’s ribs, leaving an unpleasant fluttering in his chest.
And this time, when Draco pulled back, it was Harry who chased after him. Draco held him at bay, his fingers tightening in the curls at Harry’s temple, only so he could look into his eyes, to study his face in the silvery moonlight.
from angelic), but they might as well have because he was there, at the bar, procuring a glass of firewhisky and running a hand through his hair.
Potter licked his lips and wobbled, as if attempting to reach for Draco then thought better of it. He scrubbed a hand across the back of his neck awkwardly. "See you around?"
. How could he not? Draco’s words were designed to break down his barriers –  his every action planned and curated to carefully take Harry apart. Harry could see it for what it was now with painful, aching clarity.
"Now, we wait," Draco said, dropping into a chair. His knee bounced, and he kept his eyes trained on the cauldron, unblinking, waiting for any sign of an impending explosion. It took him
“Did the Dior shipment come in?” Pansy asks, setting her takeaway cup on the counter and flipping through Draco’s post.
Draco placed his lips close to Harry’s ear. “Fuck yes. I thought you’d never ask.” He curled an arm around Harry’s back and slipped his hand under his jacket to scrape fingernails down his spine, and felt Harry’s responding growl rumble beneath his palm.
Draco clinked his champagne flute against hers. He didn't bother to remind her that it was temporary, that once his shop was in order, he'd return to Paris and continue his nice, quiet existence, without that constant reminder that Harry Potter was mere miles away, living his life, and doing it without Draco.
Draco had not gone in with a plan, but as soon as he had Potter beneath him, he knew what he wanted. Draco trailed fingertips down Potter's spine, watching as he shivered at the feather-light touch. When he reached the cleft of Potter's arse, he grabbed one cheek roughly, spreading him open. Potter let out a surprised gasp but didn't pull away. Draco used his other hand to spread him wider and traced a finger over Potter's hole, light and teasing, just enough to tickle. Potter widened his knees, and Draco took that as an invitation. He pressed two fingers into his mouth, coating them with saliva, and then ran the slick digits around Potter's entrance, a little harder this time. Potter mewled in response, and Draco did it again. It was entrancing to watch the way Potter gave himself over to the lightest touches — he was so desperate for it, and Potter's desperation was like fuel to Draco's flame. He wanted more, needed to taste it.
“Mum has finally lost her gobstones,” Ginny announced. “She’s totally redoing the seating chart Fleur and I spent all evening putting together.”
Harry’s apparition was perfection, as always, and they landed firmly on the front stoop of Harry’s house. It was just shy of dusk and the last rays of light leaned across the hills, silhouetting the cottage against the setting sun.
Potter’s face does something complicated where his mouth looks like it’s smiling but his eyebrows are bunched together and pulled low over his eyes.
The bastard had done a marvellous job of clearing the place of anything worth keeping, and abandoning only his blandest wardrobe staples. Draco was certain he did it on purpose. Noah sent in a fleet of house elves at six in the bloody morning to collect his things, while Draco stood bewildered in only his dressing gown. If he hadn’t been so distraught at the time, he would have sat his arse right down on that teak table and let the elves carry him out atop it. Draco felt his face heat at the memory and shot an
thought of it as anything more. But Draco hadn’t tried to touch him. He was acting casual and friendly, and Harry tried to take some comfort in that.
“It isn’t quite right, is it? Too cookie cutter. All a bit too…precious. Not quite you. I’ll schedule us something better next week.”
“Like showing up to a bloody Weasley wedding, perhaps?” Draco said and snagged the invitation from the table, flipping it with two fingers towards Blaise.
In retrospect, getting sloshed the night before he was supposed to meet Potter was probably not Draco's brightest idea. When he woke the next morning, his head felt three times its usual size, and his stomach lurched as he pushed himself to a seated position.
Harry is looking at him again. Draco knows it, though he keeps his lids shut tight. Harry releases his wrists and holds Draco’s face between his hands. Draco can feel the trails made by Harry’s eyes as he takes in Draco’s blotchy cheeks and tear tracks.
He needed Potter to want it so badly he begged for it because that was what dangerous men like Potter deserved.
“Eurgh, what is that?” Draco asked, his nose wrinkling as the rich scent of roast chicken and buttered bread reached his nose.
It was over. Draco was free. He should have been happy about it, he should have been booking his portkey back to America, or perhaps to France to visit Mother, or maybe even a brief holiday in Greece. A holiday did sound rather nice.
Draco leaves Blaise’s office feeling lighter. Maria offers to do more than snog him, though he politely declines, saying she isn’t quite his type. To which she pretends to look put out and stares at his arse a bit too hard as he leaves.
"Ah, here he is!" Emile called out as Draco approached, pushing from his chair to stand and beckon Draco closer with a hand on his shoulder.
The sales staff flock around him, as they always do, blabbering on about this or that, complimenting his selection while lavishing him with praise. They tell him how marvellous or fabulous this or that would look on him, as if he doesn't already know.
As promised, Emile returned to Barcelona the next morning. Draco's flat felt oddly empty without him, and it wasn't only because of Draco's missing Italian loafers.
Draco smiles lasciviously, likely seeing the fires light behind Harry’s eyes, the possessive gleam that twists his expression. He can’t help it, he’s just this way. It scares people. It makes them flinch, makes them cringe away in fear, those soft ones with their tender hearts. Because Draco is right. He’s so fucking right and god damn it, Harry hates it when he’s right.
And Harry, whom Draco had loved as long as he could remember. But that love felt different, somehow. It wasn't like any love he knew, or any he'd ever seen. It sat atop Draco's skin like an itchy sweater, and he shifted beneath it constantly, seeking comfort and never finding it. Over time, he'd grown used to the feeling, accepted it like a sickness, a chronic diagnosis — he could live with it, so long as Harry stayed far away.
at every bloody charity event was appalling. Pansy even tried to convince him that it wasn't the most humiliating thing, that Potter and his cronies were almost civil to her.
“Indisposed,” she said, stepping into the foyer and twirling her wand between her fingers, looking around the room with narrowed eyes. “Fortunately, I was there to cover for him."
." But this time his voice wavered, and Potter heard it. He dropped his hand to his side and took a step forward. Involuntarily, Draco fell back. It was all the give Potter needed, because he walked right through the entryway and kicked the door shut behind him.
Draco smirked and watched Potter over the rim of his glass. Potter downed his second drink in record time and slipped from the barstool to the floor.
Draco set about making coffee, grumbling all the while because it was a poor substitute for Hannah’s cappuccino — even with the rarely utilised French press and the fresh coffee grounds he’d procured from the Muggle spot down the street two days ago in a pinch. As he waited for the water to heat, he idly wondered if Hannah would ever consider a delivery service. If so, he’d be her first investor.
Potter guided Draco out the front door with a hand on his lower back to where the bike leaned next to the house. The morning was bright and sunny, but there were clouds gathering on the horizon and the sweet scent of rain hung heavy in the air.
Potter huffed a laugh, and Weasley groaned, grabbing Bridges by the sleeve, casting the charm at her. He dismantled the barrier long enough to shove Bridges inside and follow after her, then recast it.
Back home, Draco packaged up the tea and a fresh bottle of the salve. He pulled one of his business cards from his wallet and wrote on the back NO WHISKY, circled it twice, and signed it Healer Malfoy with a curling flourish at the end of the Y. He sent it to Potter via owl and could almost hear Potter’s amused snort all in the way in Scotland.
“Wonderful,” he sneered. “It was marvellous and French and fucking peaceful until your bloody owl showed up at my flat and shat out this bit of manipulative tripe.” Draco shook the parchment crumpled in his fist at her. “Care to explain what the fuck this is?”
Mark smiled, wide and brilliant, and took Draco's hand. He led him through London's back streets to a darkened walkway behind an auto repair shop. Ahead of them stood a squat building with brick walls and a low-hanging roof. Draco's right hand twitched at his waist, ready to grab for his wand at the first sign of danger, but as they drew closer, he could feel the vibrations of loud music and heard a chorus of voices, laughing and shouting. Mark grinned, encouraging Draco towards the entrance like a skittish foal. And that just wouldn't do.
He doesn’t have to say the words. The whimpered plea is enough to have Harry pulling off his cock, tongue swiping across the tip as he went, making Draco’s hips buck as another pathetic mewl drips from his lips. Harry removes his fingers slowly, carefully, one hand flat against Draco’s belly to keep him still. That gentle, soothing gesture is the only thing preventing Draco from surging up and crawling into Harry’s lap because he can’t bear the emptiness. He can’t allow the fog of lust to clear even the slightest bit or else he’ll be lost.
Draco also knew that Emile loved him, had told him multiple times, and there were even moments Draco was inclined to return the sentiment. He wanted to. And why wouldn't he? Emile was everything he ought to desire, and he did desire him, but he couldn't love him. No matter how hard he tried.
“Harry,” Hermione said. “You remember Olivia, right? From the Magical Creatures for Peace and Unity board meetings?”
“It’s about that time, Harry,” he said, to which Harry nodded, catching the heap of cording when Weasley tossed it to him. Then Weasley turned to Draco. “Say, Malfoy…”
Draco placed his briefcase on the floor and hung his coat on a wobbly hook next to the door. He rolled up his shirtsleeves and twirled his wand across his knuckles before grasping it in a loose fist.
He knew that, of course. It was the reason Draco stopped reading the papers in the first place; Potter plastered over every other page alongside Quidditch players, pop stars, and politicians. The British news did little more than depress him most days anyway.
Potter released his grip on the Snitch between his fingers, flashing that achingly familiar crooked grin that Draco saw in his dreams and nightmares alike. The thing hovered for half a second, and then was gone, zipping away across the night sky in a blink of gold.
"I need to watch it," Draco replied, but stood anyway. Thankfully, Emile dropped his hand from Draco's wrist as soon as he stood. Draco could hardly stand the sensation of skin against skin, and Emile had noticed, though he didn't ask questions, just waited him out. And Draco planned to keep him waiting a very long time.
Potter frowned and held it up to his chest, reading the print, then turned an unamused look on Draco.
Potter licked his lips, still grinning, and every alarm bell in Draco's mind started ringing for an immediate retreat. But that foul fluttering in Draco's chest had him turning the bottle around in his hands, considering.
“Maybe you ought to trip and fall. Make sure they get a photo for the papers,” Theo says with a smirk.
When he returned to Blaise’s penthouse, the foyer was filled with sacks and garment bags and Blaise was standing in the middle of all of it smiling and brandishing a silk tie in a deep, royal aubergine that suited his complexion beautifully, as Draco knew it would.
When Draco returned to the sitting room, Potter was standing, scrubbing a hand through tousled hair.
“I – erm – should have owled first, I guess,” Harry fumbled, shoving his hands deep into his pockets and taking a step backward.
Harry’s eyes light up like someone’s cast a bloody Lumos inside his brain. He grabs the slip of paper Pansy left on the table and examines it. “Well, let’s get a move on then!”
Draco tugs at the hair in his fists, pulling Harry down for a kiss, because that means he doesn’t have to look at him. Harry’s pace doesn’t falter, and he returns Draco’s messy kiss with enthusiasm, chasing his tongue, biting his lips, swallowing his breaths.
"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck," Draco whined. His fingers dug into the skin at Potter's shoulders, probably causing blood to pool in the crescent moon indentations left by his nails, though he couldn't see it. He couldn't see anything. He was too afraid to open his eyes again.
Why did Draco have to wait until they were both drunk and stupid and hidden under the guise of darkness to have this?
. After all those failed trials, the explosions, the messes, the frustration, he'd done it. He'd fucking done it. It happened alone in his lab one night. Emile had long since gone home or found someone else to keep him company until dawn. Draco was feverish, sick from days without rest, obsessing over one drop of this, a teaspoon of that, until it was finished. It lasted the night, minimal grogginess, effective in small doses. Near perfect.
Two days later, Draco received an official owl from the ministry confirming that Auror Potter would be meet him at twelve o'clock on Thursday and Draco almost found himself looking forward to it. Antagonizing Potter used to be one of Draco’s favourite activities in school, second only to Quidditch and scoring a higher mark than Granger. And anyway, it would break up the monotony.
Draco threw up a hand and snagged a pillow from the top of the bed and hurled it at his head. Potter dodged it easily with a bright laugh.
"That sounds dreadful," Draco said, poking at the sandwich Potter placed in front of him. Ham. He hated ham.
It was his sentence, his punishment for his sins, and he wanted it to hurt. And Potter's tenderness was more brutal than a slap, a cut, or a curse. This was what he truly deserved, to have the one thing he wanted more than anything in the world right in front of him, pressed against him, while knowing that he could not possess it. That, come morning, he would have to let it go. It was torture. But fuck, it felt like heaven.
Harry shrugged. "Didn't see any reason to do much with it. Most of the time I spend in here, my eyes are closed."
“I don’t know what the bloody hell you’re on about,” Draco said, taking a sip of his wine, still staring at the place where Potter’s motorbike had disappeared.
He’d known that, on some level. He saw the way Malfoy’s gaze followed him. And there was nothing subtle about his flirtation. And yet, the idea had never really materialized that Malfoy was actually attracted to men, attracted to
“Don’t worry, Malfoy,” Potter said with a sigh, settling back against the pillows. “I’ve got plenty of scars to remind me. Shall we see if I’ve earned any more?”
Draco dipped the tip into the fire and took a long inhale. He released it through his mouth, just like the tattooed bartender taught him, proud that he did so without coughing like a fool.
Outside, Marcus was drowning in a sea of gingers, all listening raptly as he explained Weasley’s condition, and that he was expected to recover, though he needed time to rest before he could have visitors. Potter caught Draco’s eye just before Draco turned toward his office in the opposite direction. He wanted to think he saw something there, something soft or forgiving, but it was inscrutable.
Draco blew away the hair that was mashed down over one eye with a puff of breath. Potter grinned at him crookedly, put his own bucket on his head, and threw a leg over the machine. He kicked the bit of metal that kept it standing and the thing settled between his thighs.
The silence stretched thin and Draco tried not to shift. Potter just stood there looking nonplussed and more than a little amused with a crooked smile that caused his cheek to do this silly little dimple thing that even Draco could admit was somewhat fetching.
Draco’s lip twitched at the use of Potter’s first name, as if Noah had any right to address Potter like a friend.
"You can't. Not yet. I've waited too long to have you, and this is what you get when you make me wait."
"We can't do this, Potter," Draco ground out, dropping his face into his hand, rubbing at the ache already forming at his temples.
Draco stepped around the umbrella stand in question — a hideous and familiar thing shaped like a troll foot which was indeed in the centre of the corridor and held two bright yellow umbrellas and a single sword — and followed Potter into the living room. Gone were the musty old sofa and wing-backed armchairs Draco remembered, replaced by a far more modern twill grey sofa and matching chairs that looked both new and comfortably broken-in. It was every bit Potter's style. There was even a Muggle television set against the wall.
It’s like being doused with cold water, placing his bare hand on the hob, being split from groin to throat with a sharp blade — like nothing at first, and then blinding pain.
. They didn’t share hopes and dreams or have the deep sorts of conversations Draco associated with an actual relationship — not that he did that sort of thing with anyone other than Pansy. And a couple of nights in Potter’s bed didn’t make it real, didn’t make them anything other than consenting adults seeking mutual gratification.
“Fine,” Draco choked. He cleared his throat and tried again. “I’m fine. Just… tired. Overseas Portkeys and all that.”
Pansy sipped her wine and wobbled her head. “They’re alright. Pretty, if you like that sort of thing. Bit boring, maybe. Honestly, I don’t think much of them at all. They never last more than a month or so. Why do you ask?”
“You are,” Draco argues. “Why else would they all run off before morning as soon as the liquor wears off?”
The silence lingered, static over the line. Then he heard Harry sigh, a rustle, and Draco imagined him running his hand through his hair, which caused an ache to bloom in Draco’s chest.
There was nothing instantly familiar about her. She was pretty in a simple, wholesome sort of way, with high cheekbones and clear blue eyes. Her fair hair was plaited in a messy braid that fell over her shoulder.
Draco’s lust and jealousy twine together, burning hot in his abdomen. And when Harry’s fingers trail lower, skating past Draco’s perineum, only to hesitate at the crack of his arse, Draco’s thighs fall open, splaying wide because
Weasley stepped up and took the bag of tea from Draco’s outstretched arm and sniffed it, eyes fluttering shut. “Fuck, I love this stuff.” He eyed the other bag, nose twitching much like Draco’s had. “That’ll be for the Ukrainian Ironbellies. I’ll let you hang onto that. Harry’s round back. Hold on.”
Emile was fit, that was for certain. Draco couldn't help but watch him, and maybe that gave Emile the wrong impression. Draco didn't watch Emile simply because he was beautiful and charming and charismatic, though he was all of those things. Draco watched him because sometimes, out of the corner of his eye, Draco would see that tousled coif of dark hair, those bright eyes against olive skin, and think, if only for a second, that Potter was there.
Potter's expression cracked for only a moment, then hardened again. "What difference does it make to you?"
Potter's hands found their way into the back of Draco's trousers, warm, sure, and welcome. "Definitely not."
"I know. But not yet." Harry added a second finger, and Draco hissed at the sharp burn. Harry's forehead dropped against Draco's hip, and Draco could feel each of his breaths fan over his sensitive skin. "Fuck, Draco, you're so tight. How long has it been?"
“On your command, captain,” Marcus said, drawing his own wand, tossing it in the air, and catching it with a flourish.
"Did you —" Draco breathed, then groaned, as Potter nipped at his throat. "How did you — you didn't even touch your wand!"
Draco clamps down on his urge to spin in the direction Lovegood is nodding at the last possible second and manages to glance casually over his shoulder. Sure enough, there is Harry, sans fawning slag, jogging in their direction. His hands are shoved into the pockets of his jeans, and he looks flushed and sweaty, and so fucking lovely Draco nearly groans.
Draco had just thrown the invitation down for what was probably the tenth time when Blaise came swanning onto the patio, just home from whatever terribly important meeting he’d attended, and dressed in an orange suit so bright it made Draco’s eyes water.
Draco just held the plastic bucket and glared at Potter, to which Potter laughed, took the silly thing and plonked it onto Draco’s head, fastened the strap beneath his chin with nimble fingers, then gave the side a rap with his knuckle that nearly made Draco stumble.
All Draco had to do was stay in London long enough to set up his shop and hire competent staff to manage it on his behalf, and he’d be back in Paris drinking rosé and eating petit fours from the fingers of some dashing Frenchman within a matter of weeks. He reckoned he’d have plenty of time to focus on his work because, aside from making enough appearances to placate Pansy, it wasn’t as if there was anything else in England to hold his attention.
There was that strange, stretched imitation of a smile again. It was nothing like the soft ones accompanied by a blush that Draco was used to seeing. "That's alright. I'm fine."
The photo of Harry's mum was the only bit of decoration in the bedroom. It sat on Harry's bare dresser, right in the centre. Draco ran his fingers over the dark wood frame and watched as Lily Potter smiled and laughed out at him.
It ruined his relationships, his friendships, everything. On her deathbed, his mother had told him, “Draco, darling, there is more to life than work.” He didn’t believe her then, and he wasn’t sure he believed her now because nothing else gave Draco a stronger sense of purpose than blood to his elbows, an unsolvable puzzle, a deadly timeline. He felt powerful, clever,
Draco nearly swallowed his tongue. "What?" he sputtered inelegantly. "No, I don't want to dance, Potter! Are you daft?"
was bliss. It rumbled from somewhere deep in his chest and rolled out his mouth, ragged and warm. Draco felt that laugh in his gut. He felt it in his cock. He felt it curl inside him and settle like a house cat in a patch of sunlight.
Harry laughed. He braced the hand behind him and thrust his hips upwards, a direct hit against Draco's prostate that lit him up like an electric shock as his eyes rolled back in his head.
He wasn’t sure what sort of game Potter thought he was playing, swirling into people's offices, accusing them of ludicrous things like
Harry knows Draco fancies blokes, is openly gay. He has to notice the way Draco’s eyes follow him, doesn’t he? Sure, Draco insults him, calls him an idiot and a dolt and squib. But Harry has to know that he was only saying those things because that’s just what they do. They tease and poke fun, and try to keep it from veering into cruelty.
Draco was good at this. He loved it. He loved the taste of it, the heady masculine scent of it, the feel of throbbing pressure at the back of his throat. And Potter, the lucky bastard, was going to get Draco's very best, because Potter wore jeans without pants, and laughed when Draco was being properly clever, and because Draco wanted him so badly he could hardly think. Draco had every intention of keeping his ministrations light and fleeting, of pushing Potter to the precipice, only to hold him there ruthlessly. But as soon as he felt Potter thread his fingers through the hair at Draco's forehead, combing back to settle behind his ear, Draco was lost. He swallowed Potter down in one movement, a moan pulled from his throat.
Draco sighed, tucking his wand back into his sleeve. "Reckoned it was worth a shot. Best to keep you on your toes."
Potter looked feverish, cheeks flushed rosy and his eyes blazing. His hands twisted once in their bonds, and Draco realised with no small amount of pleasure that Potter could snap them if he wanted. One sharp jerk and metal would bend, or the leather would crack and break. Potter kept his hands away by will alone and the attempted obedience suffused Draco with smug satisfaction.
Harry walked backwards, fingers of one hand curled into the front of Draco’s jacket. He released Draco and turned when he reached the bike. He threw a leg over and kicked the machine to life, and Draco didn’t hesitate for even a moment before climbing on behind him.
Watts gave Draco a hard shove, but the third Auror, a tall, slender woman with short, dark hair cut sharply around her face approached the poker table and flipped the cards dropped in front of McConnell’s seat with her index finger to reveal two queens and three sevens.
Draco scoffed. "Never connected the dots, did you? All those years ago. You'd barely finished moaning my name like the slag you are before letting
Draco tucked his nose into Potter’s shoulder. He smelled nice — woodsy and a touch smoky — like whisky and fire. And he was so bloody warm that Draco didn’t even feel the whip of the wind against his skin, safely huddled behind Potter like a shield.
There were still a dozen people milling around the shop when Draco returned, including Pansy, Blaise, Eryn, and the older gentleman chatting with Eryn. Gods, Draco hoped the girl had better self-esteem than that. He had to be twenty years her senior, and that moth-eaten jumper wasn't doing him any favours. But Blaise and Pansy sidled up before he could warn her against any champagne induced decisions, and Draco let them pull him away, showering him in compliments while drinking generously from his backroom stash.
"Can the two of you quit mucking around?" Weasley called, a desperate edge to his voice that had Potter spinning around and sending a burst of magical force from his wand, as another attacker crumpled at Weasley's feet.
“That’s a nice suit,” Potter said, walking backwards up the stairs so he could face Draco, all the while Draco hoping in vain to see him trip.
“Yeah, see, not exactly the qualities I look for in a date, but I get where you’re going with this,” Potter says, though Draco thinks he might be attempting sarcasm because he’s rolling his eyes an awful lot.
Potter turned on his heel, undone shoelaces flopping around his boots, stalking out of the room. He hesitated in the doorway, hand on the frame, knuckles white. He hung his head and spun back around.
Draco had tucked away so many years ago. And before Potter could pull away, Draco opened beneath his lips with a gasping sob. Potter swallowed it hungrily, pressing his tongue, hot and wet, into Draco's mouth.
Draco was hard to the point of pain, his balls drawn up against his body, and the cramping in his gut pulled so tight it was difficult to take in a proper breath or to keep the moans locked behind his teeth.
There was power in a name. It had slipped from Draco's lips before, though almost exclusively in anger and lust. He'd caught himself chanting Harry's name in his mind all night, but allowing it to spill from his lips and settle between them gave it new weight. It was a symptom of the sickness, a familiarity that Draco wouldn't allow himself in the daylight. But it felt right here, felt dirty and wrong and so bloody
It was quite a sight, after all, both of them still half-dressed, trousers around their thighs, Draco with his shirt open and tie loose, Potter with his jumper pushed up to his sternum by Draco's questing hands. Potter was letting out gasping little moans, and his face was so flushed, and his hair absolutely wild, his eyes squeezed shut and his lip clamped between his teeth as Draco bit kisses up his neck.
Potter straightens with a grunt and wipes his brow on the back of his forearm. “Are you taking the piss?”
Hermione managed Peace and Unity for a Fruitful Future, an umbrella organization for the range of charities she’d helped Harry found after the end of the war. She was brilliant at it, of course. And while Harry was happy to help in any way he could, the day to day operations were completely over his head.
“Perhaps. Except that Luna found it rather surprising that Harry would do something like that without a bit of prodding. And I got to thinking, hm, who do I know that is an expert at prodding people into doing things, clucks like a hen, and convinces a man of simple tastes to spend two thousand pounds on an Ethan Allen sofa,” Pansy said, tapping one long, red fingernail against her jaw.
Draco growled and shut the door with a slam on her laughter. He sunk back to his perch on the stool to scour the papers in relative peace, only to be disappointed. There was very little on the case, even in
She swings around the corner in a cloud of Chanel No. 5 and a shiny red skirt so short she clearly has no plans on sitting. Or walking.
Harry almost gives in to him. He sags against Draco’s body and kisses him back. He lets Draco suck and tug his lips with his teeth. But then there are hands around Draco’s wrists again, gentle this time, peeling Draco’s fingers from where they curl around the back of Harry’s neck, sticky and clinging.
Draco glanced at the list next to a taxidermy marmot with button eyes. “Can you believe someone actually bid three hundred galleons for this monster?”
“We shall.” Pansy takes his arm, and he leads her to the front door. They take the lift even though it’s slow, because Draco can’t risk getting caught Apparating in the hallway outside his wards, and there is no way he’ll risk Pansy breaking her neck attempting to walk down three flights of stairs in Manolo Blahnik’s. Because if she doesn’t die, she’ll kill Draco for ruining her shoes.
“Why?” Potter was studying him with narrowed eyes and Draco resisted the urge to shift beneath his stare.
Hannah chuckled and nodded. “That’s correct. He’s one of my best customers. Spends a bloody fortune.”
He didn’t tell Potter any of that, of course. He didn’t tell Potter that the dreamy flat he described didn’t belong to him, neither did any of the other flats he’d referenced – which were truly nothing more than dingy hotel rooms that he would rent by the week on occasion. He didn’t think Potter would find that particularly impressive.
It’s just…” he cleared his throat and crossed his legs, the epitome of casual. “The men I date, what do you think of them?”
The ache that Draco had once found easy to suppress when Harry wasn’t in reach became nearly intolerable. It was probably a bad thing. A dangerous, catastrophic thing that would burn them up, but it felt so bloody good that Draco didn’t mind. And Harry didn’t seem to mind it either. Certainly not with the soft way he kissed Draco’s wrists in the mornings, fed him vegetables even though he hated them, fucked him to sleep when Harry knew Draco wasn’t getting enough rest.
Potter also spent a bloody fortune, not only in donations to the Ministry’s Foundations for Futures organisation, but also to a group devoted to the creation of better support systems for squibs, and another for the destigmatising of magical creatures in positions typically reserved for wizards. Potter even promised to spend time in the Children's Ward at Mungo's over the holidays. Draco knew Potter had money, but he had perhaps underestimated how much. Because if Potter could kiss that many galleons goodbye with barely a twitch of the eye, then he was sitting on a bigger vault than Draco suspected.
Hermione did a similar thing, flapping about and scolding Harry whenever he got hurt because she seemed to find that easier than crying like Molly, joking about it like Ron, or slugging him like Ginny.
“Stop!” Harry said, holding up the hand that wasn’t holding his tequila. “Just, stop. You’re giving me whiplash. I’m never sure whether you’re complimenting me or insulting me.”
Draco stubbed out his cigarette in a pot of frostbitten roses. "I should go back in and check on my formula."
He was so engrossed in the results of the diagnostic tests and his own swirling thoughts that he didn’t even hear the squeak of the Mediwizard's trainers on the floor until the man cleared his throat nervously.
Harry’s follow-up exam was scheduled for eleven in the morning, and by eleven fifteen, Draco was pacing the exam room, his Tempus charm pulsing red and beginning to release steam where it hovered in the air. Just as he was about to throw up his hands and shout at Irma to get Potter on the Floo, there came a scuffling sound outside the room, and the door swung open with a bang.
A smile tugged at the corners of his lips. Damn Lovegood for being so bloody disarming. He’d almost forgotten he’d only come here because he needed something from her.
Draco doesn’t give Blaise the benefit of privacy while he changes into the trousers, kneeling as soon as they’re buttoned and marks the hems at the ankle with the white pencil he keeps tucked behind one ear.
Draco approached the girl, placing a hand on her shoulder. She turned, though it felt too slow, too deliberate. She blinked at him.
Harry ate most of the chips by himself, although Malfoy would occasionally pluck one from the platter, all the while watching Harry with hooded eyes.
The wine arrived a few moments later, the poor server tripping all over himself as he poured Potter a taste, to which Potter nodded. Although, if Draco had thought the wine would make conversation with Potter easier, he was sorely mistaken. It didn’t help that they were approached multiple times by fans and will-wishers, none of whom bothered to acknowledge Draco’s presence with anything more than a tight smile.
Draco dragged his lips up and down Potter’s erection in tandem with the circle of his fist. Potter’s hips rolled, fucking up into Draco’s grip and pressing into the back of his throat, the bitter tang of precome flooding Draco’s mouth. Draco moaned into it, the vibration only driving Potter higher as the headboard creaked again, the metal bending and grinding under the force of his movements.
“Still inconsiderate,” Draco grunts and swallows the shot while Pansy carries on rolling her eyes at him.
He nipped at Harry’s bottom lip, sucked it into his mouth, his teeth scraping across the swollen flesh before he released him. Harry planted a palm on either side of Draco’s head, his hips stilling for a moment, unable to rock and move the way he wanted when curled that way. But he kissed Draco luxuriously, a tangle of tongues as Draco thrust slowly up into him, one hand clamped around Harry’s hipbone to keep him in place.
? I am not a patient man, but for you, Harry, I have tried. To be this straightforward is honestly so painfully unnatural for me that I'm about ready to spew this bottom-shelf champagne on my very expensive Italian leather shoes. So, could you please do me a favour and save me the embarrassment and the trip to the cobbler, and make up your mind?"
"You're not listening, Potter," Draco said, exasperated. "It's rare and pricey, but not dangerous. Certainly not deadly, unless it's being mixed with something else on this list, and because I don't make a habit of murdering people, I can't be sure what that is. I cannot imagine any situation where such a sizeable amount of these particular ingredients would be necessary. Are they selling them on the black market for a profit, by chance?"
Hannah dropped the galleon into the till with a smirk, which shifted suddenly into an apologetic little smile as she caught sight of something over Draco's shoulder.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up and a laugh burst from him, loud enough to echo in the sparse room. “Prat,” he said, still chuckling.
Draco glanced at Harry out of the corner of his eye and smirked. Then he carried on smoking and drinking tea and staring into Harry's messy little garden while Harry just grinned at him, lip caught between his teeth.
Harry winked and started the Jeep. He hit the gas hard enough that Draco’s skull smacked against the headrest.
But Weasley was already walking through the front door of an ivy-covered brick building. Draco followed her, the bell over the door tinkling softly as it closed behind him. The room was humid, with plants absolutely everywhere. It had the same chaotic, almost
“I’m not a cop,” Harry muttered. With Malfoy’s rap sheet, he supposed it wasn’t particularly shocking he knew about Muggle police.
Lovegood sighed as the flames died down and returned to the counter where Draco stood. She ducked out of sight, then reappeared with two bags of the sweet-smelling tea. She pushed it across the counter to Draco, waving his hand away when he reached for his wallet.
Blaise smiled. “Pick me up a new shirt while you’re there. I don’t think Potter has any intention of replacing the one he ruined.”
Harry felt Ron shift next to him, turning to face him, and heard Hermione’s sharp intake of breath. He squeezed his eyes shut.
Draco had to swallow hard around the lump in his throat to squeeze his next words out. "You should leave," he said, turning away from him, begging the tears that stung and burned behind his eyes to stay put just a little longer.
“Good morning Miss Melgren, how are you feeling?” Draco asked, plucking the clipboard from its holder on the wall, not because he needed to refresh himself on the details of her case, but because he required something to busy his hands.
Draco shouldn't have even noticed him. In a room full of beautiful people, Potter was perfectly ordinary in his dark jeans and tight t-shirt, hands shoved into the pockets of his ubiquitous leather jacket. He was fit, sure, and maybe other men noticed him when he stepped in the door, too. But it wasn't the clothes or the hair or the alarmingly bright eyes that had Draco swivelling in his chair and snapping his neck around so fast it twinged. It was his
Potter nodded with a frown. “That’s true. But even dangerous things deserve a happy life.” He was quiet for a moment, then continued. “But they’re safe here. Even from us. The barrier restricts certain kinds of magic. No Apparition within the wards. Basic spell work is allowed, but nothing fancy. Nothing big. Not even by accident. They’re very sensitive to magic, the dragons.”
Harry’s expression was soft. His chin rested on the fist of the hand not in Draco’s hair. “And if you can’t?” he said, though it wasn’t unkind or sceptical, only thoughtful.
, and Pansy was right. She wasn't an idiot. She would have seen right through him, would know even before Draco that fucking Potter wasn't really about the fucking at all, and he couldn't bear it.
That searching gaze used to unnerve Draco, made him feel exposed. He had once worried that Harry would see something he didn't want him to see, would peer right past Draco's carefully articulated veneer and
Draco didn’t get a response to his invitation for a full thirty-six hours, but on the day of, he received a scribbled
"Big, silvery. Looked quite official." She held out the box, and Draco snatched it from her. "Same owl that's been here almost every day for the past two weeks."
“Pans,” Blaise says, already tapping away at his mobile with a frown. “Fucking idiot! That’s it. I’m sacking him.”
Draco was on his feet immediately, wiping his mouth with the back of his fist. Potter gripped Draco's arm tightly with one hand, his body twisted to watch the silhouettes of what appeared to be a woman and a man snogging against the door. Potter spun back around to look at Draco, his eyes twinkling and a cheeky grin on his face.
"That works too," Harry said with a sigh as he sank against the door. He tucked his forefingers into the pockets of Draco's trousers, drawing him closer.
Potter was unrelenting and it was fucking heaven. Potter’s cock was dragging against Draco’s prostate and Draco’s moans and gasps were falling from his lips unchecked. Draco felt one of Potter’s hands release his hip to curl around Draco’s stomach and up his chest, guiding him upright until Draco was sitting with Potter’s chest to his back. His knees were spread almost painfully wide and Potter was still pounding into him with deep powerful thrusts. Potter’s hand that wasn’t pressed against Draco’s stomach curled around Draco’s neck, tipping his head back and exposing his throat. Draco’s body was curved like a bow and Potter held him fast, preventing Draco from twisting away from him.
Draco’s hands ball into fists on the table and he glares daggers at the design in the steamed milk. Minutes pass in that uncomfortable silence.
Draco hated stakeouts with Potter. For one, it involved them sitting in close quarters for long periods of time. The first few they suffered through as partners were painfully awkward while they sat in silence, each minute stretching longer than the last. Over time, they became more bearable, if no less terrible. Potter was quite chatty once you got him started, and Draco was subsequently subjected to hours of inane prattling about Potter’s new broomstick, his godson Teddy, Granger’s latest bout of academic brilliance, the previous nights’ Quidditch scores, or the newest nonsense from the Weasel’s joke shop.
A reluctant grin cracked over Harry’s face and Draco’s stomach flipped in response. He didn’t think he’d ever get tired of making Harry smile and deigned to do so at every possible opportunity.
He clears his throat and holds out a hand towards the riser surrounded by mirrors that he uses for fittings. “If you don’t mind.”
“Hah! I knew it,” Draco said, vindicated. “What is it you’re buttering me up for, then? Must be particularly sadistic.”
There was the usual burst of flashbulbs as they stepped through the door. Potter squinted against them, dipping his chin and waving awkwardly, just as before, which annoyed Draco to no end. Draco straightened his spine and angled his hips to show off the cut of his suit against his long, lean figure. The photos would be brilliant if only Potter would stand a little straighter.
"Ha, bloody ha." Potter withdrew, bumping his shoulder against Draco's. "Now, what was it you told me about being a shite host? I was promised champagne in the invitation."
Luna grinned at him, a wide and gentle thing that made her eyes crease at the corners. "I think the best photos are taken of people as they are. You're quite handsome when you aren't scowling, you know?"
Draco followed Potter's line of sight to the bed, where Draco's suitcases were still spread across the duvet, a couple of suits rumpled beside them, poised and ready for his escape. He looked back at Potter to find his eyes gone hard, and his hands tightening into fists at his sides, only to stretch wide, then ball up again. Draco shivered as the invisible magic crackled around him.
Harry liked him this way – desperate and wanton. It was such a stark contrast to the snarky smirking and cutting words, though he found that rather sexy as well.
Malfoy was watching Harry from beneath lowered lashes. It was predatory and heated and Harry’s stomach jumped in response.
“Doesn’t make any difference to me,” Harry said, his tone gruff and entirely too jagged at the edges.
Draco and Marcus worked comfortably in tandem. Draco wove his spells through Marcus’ like a tapestry — stitching spells around skin, bone, and muscle in delicate, ornate patterns. Their spells bound the severed retina back together, fused frayed nerve-endings, and scraped away mottled scar tissue.
“Don’t be cruel,” Harry said, even though he barely managed to suppress a chuckle. “I’m sure they're lovely girls."
Draco straightens the collar of his shirt and smooths a hand down his waistcoat, affecting his most casual, non-plotting smile, and with a quick run of his fingers through his hair, flings open the door to Blaise’s office.
"No." Draco shook her off, grabbed all the suits in his arms, and tugged them from their hangers. He stumbled back to the suitcases laid across his bed and dropped them in without a thought over what his tailor would say.
Draco tries to keep from looking up when he hears the tinkling of the bell over the door. He presses another button and leans very casually, elbow only slipping slightly.
“That dick again? Merlin, Harry. Just quit already.” Ginny helped herself to a beer and popped the cap with her wand. She stuck her gum to the inside of the bottle cap and hopped onto the counter, freckled legs swinging, heels hitting the cupboards with the backs of her trainers. “Shacklebolt would absolutely ream him for losing you.”
Potter had at least three figures crowded against the far wall, held fast behind a magical barrier, but his wand was pointed at a man sprinting towards Weasley. The man didn't make it more than a few paces before a spark erupted from the tip of Potter's wand and slammed him to the ground with a grunt. Then Potter was storming forward, tables sliding across the room with each violent slash of his wand. He swung both hands back towards his head, elbows at his sides, wand tucked between his fingers. Then, as if pushing something heavy, thrust his hands forwards, and every single table in the room tipped onto two legs and went flying towards a cluster of wizards, who were throwing spells from the safety of a shield of crates. A few pained shouts pierced the chaos, breaking through the rumbling of the earth. The crunch of wood echoed as the table legs embedded themselves in the crumbling stone walls, trapping the wizards there.
Potter shook his head, fingers tightening visibly on the handle of his broom. "Together? We're just… it's casual. Couple months, I guess?"
Mr Walton invited others into their circle, waving Potter about like a prized crup, and Draco almost felt sorry for him. Almost.
When he could find no further things to fuss over, Draco pulled on his coat, locked and warded his shop, and hastened towards the Apparition point. Moments later, he stood in front of an innocuous row of dark brick townhouses on a poorly lit street. He counted the numbers next to the doorways, jumping suspiciously from eleven to thirteen.
Pansy’s face pinched and Draco felt a curl of guilt in his gut. “You ran away and are pretending that’s better?”
Harry was huddled by the bar, downing his fifth canape and his third Firewhisky while attempting to avoid the insipid chattering of Mrs Grenilda Greenwich from the Pureblood Ladies Association when he felt a presence at his back, followed by a cool, posh voice.
Potter led him back outside, pointing to each of the huts, some wooden and laid with soft hay, others made of stone and scorched black on the inside. He told Draco about the newborn Mooncalves and the Nundu they’d taken in after it destroyed a fishing village in Portugal. He made a joke about a few wild Hippogriffs that came round in the summertime, which Draco did not find amusing
Weasley let out another whooping shout and the Jeep lurched forward. They chased after the dragon at breakneck speed, flying over the hills until they reached the sea. Weasley turned the vehicle as they raced along the edge of the cliffs, the incline so steep that one wrong move and they’d be tumbling over the edge to break upon the rocks and waves. But Weasley was grinning like a maniac, and Draco experienced a strange sort of elation. It swelled in his chest until it was almost hard to breathe and it made him want to shout, to roar into the wind.
Draco lifted one brow, a question on the tip of his tongue, but before he could ask it, could demand to know what Potter meant by that, Royston Fothergill, an old associate of Noah’s who Draco found tolerable, came barrelling up to them.
"Not good? Merlin's bollocks, Potter. That was just about the sexiest thing I've ever seen. Fucking hell. But of course,
Draco was busy fielding some rather forthright questions regarding the future direction of Potter’s financial contributions, when Potter placed a hand on his shoulder and whispered into his ear with whisky-soaked breath that he was going off in search of another drink. Before Draco could reel around and yank him back to tell him to bloody
Weasley yanked his tartan overshirt from his shoulders, making to wrap the cut, and Draco was suddenly clambering from the Jeep on unsteady legs and stalking towards them.
Once alone, Emile leaned against the counter, a sly smile on his face that had Draco instantly wary.
Harry’s face pinched in a pained sort of way that made Draco’s heart break a little, though he wasn’t quite sure why.
Draco’s chest pulled tight at Potter’s apparent ease in Weasley’s bedroom — the way he rummaged through familiar drawers and selected a shirt from a clean stack, as if he’d done it a hundred times before. Probably because he
Harry’s hands were on his arse, squeezing, using the leverage to push deeper inside Draco’s body, the deliciously slick drag of skin against skin. His fingers slipped down the crack of Draco’s arse, where they were connected, teasing around Draco’s rim with the tip of one finger.
Draco finished two cigarettes and a few long swigs from the neck of the champagne bottle before he began to feel a bit foolish. He nodded towards a handful of party guests as they dispersed into the night, each waving a friendly hand in his direction.
“I have every confidence you will,” he said honestly. Lucky for him, Malfoy would be long gone by then.
It might have been the most pornographic sight Draco had ever witnessed, and Potter wasn’t even finished spilling himself across his own chest and stomach before Draco firmed his grip at Potter’s calves and fucked into him with violent desperation.
Draco grinned so wide his cheeks ached and he practically ran the rest of the way. He snagged the matching black helmet off the seat and jammed it over his head, as he’d done a hundred times before.
“Nothing happened. Well, something happened, but not…” Draco sighed and slumped. He drained the last sip of his champagne. “Weasley ended up in the A&E.”
“I don’t want to stand around posing for photos and doing interviews about my favourite food or perfect date,” Harry said with a frown.
Potter must have recognised the invitation for what it was, because he gusted out a shaky breath that cooled Draco's fevered, sweat-damp skin, raising goose pimples in its wake. Potter's fingers disappeared for a fraction of a second, and Draco heard him mutter a word under his breath. There was a rustle of fabric, and Draco lifted his head from the mattress to catch as Potter's wand sailed across the room. He barely touched the thing, eyes intent on his right hand, then dropped it back to the floor. And when those fingers returned to Draco's body, they were wet.
No one responded right away. There was no outburst, no exclamation of surprise, and when Harry glanced up, it was to see his friends sharing a small, secret smile.
Draco fumbled for the bottle of lube, lost in the wrinkled tangle of the sheet where the corners had already tugged free from the mattress. He thought of all manner of bland things — dry toast, American baseball, the Queen — as he slicked up his cock, avoiding any opportunity to linger over his own flesh, swollen, sensitive, and aching for touch.
“What the fuck is that?” Draco asked with a helpless wave of his hand, his voice still an octave higher than its usual deep timbre. “Why are you talking like that?”
“Harry used to come visit me every week. And then one week, he didn’t. It wasn’t like him. Harry has always been very good to his friends. He would never just… not show up. And I made treacle tart.” She smiled. “Harry loves treacle tart.”
Draco was mistaken. This wasn't a dream. It was a bloody nightmare. Potter was taking the piss. He must have been. There was no reason Potter would even be there other than to use it against Draco in some way. The bastard was probably going to twist the knife and sell the story to get the reporters off his back. Yes, that must be it. Draco could see the headline now:
. See, I thought they threw your lot behind bars just after the war. But then I find that you were released thanks to the testimony of one Harry Potter. And here he is, in charge of your parole. Seems dodgy to me. One I can assure you I’ll be looking into.”
He unpacked, hanging his suits and robes neatly in the closet, and selected his favourite from the lineup. It was custom tailored and the perfect shade of pale grey-blue, fashioned in a distinctly Muggle style. The French rarely wore waistcoats, but even after all his years in Paris, Draco was an Englishman and felt rather underdressed without one. He paired it with a crisp white shirt and a slate-coloured tie.
Draco studied Potter for a moment, searching for any sign of sarcasm or cruelty, and found none. “Nor I,” he said.
“I suppose that would be acceptable. I’ll consider forgiving you. When we get there.” Draco conceded.
They stumbled out of the club into the night and Apparated back to Grimmauld Place. Potter's aim was impeccable, as usual, because he dropped them right into his bedroom and they were naked in seconds. Draco tossed him on the bed and crawled over him, covering Potter's body with his own, rubbing against him just to feel the hot friction from Potter's skin against his. Potter was gasping into their kiss, completely lost to it. When Draco told him to turn over, he did so without protest, grabbing fistfuls of the sheets.
Draco just blinked at him, then shook his head. “You’re right. Sounds mental. Ought to get your head checked, Potter.”
He is startled from his ruminations by the ear-splitting roar of an engine echoing across the small street. The next thing he knows, a familiar black motorbike is skidding to a halt right in front of him.
Harry looks lovely, like something out of a magazine, in his perfectly tailored suit and astride the gleaming machine. His cheeks are pink from the cold and his lips are curled around a half-smile. Draco would like to say he’s admiring his handiwork: the way the jacket, unbuttoned, reveals the breadth of his shoulders and the trim cut of his waist or the drape of the trousers across his slim hips. It is perfection on him, Draco’s absolute best work. But it doesn’t matter. Harry could wear anything and Draco would want him.
“Marvelously, to be honest. Thanks ever so much for the report on Chizpurfle Carapace. Saved me an age on research.”
part of the entire ordeal was that they brought you to me. The rest had nothing to do with luck. It’s
Malfoy stepped forward and took both her small hands in his much larger ones and gave a little bow. “Ms. Witherbottom. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. Harry and I are so glad for your help. You see, there is simply no other way to navigate this market without someone of your experience.” Malfoy’s smile was conspiratorial and charming. “I hear you sold the flat to Princess Di’s accountant last year.”
Potter rolled his eyes, but gestured for Draco to continue. Draco did his best to recall all the details of the afternoon — the hidden room in the lab, the massive store of illegal and hazardous substances, the attack made by persons yet unknown upon their forceful entry. He made sure not to leave anything out and didn't miss a single opportunity to make a jab at Potter's competence or tendency to tear into dangerous situations without adequate preparation.
Draco waited for the sickening jealousy to curl up from the pit of his stomach, like worms unearthed in the rain. But it never came. Instead, all he felt was warmth — warmth from the room, from the charm that still lingered in the fibres of Draco’s coat, from the look that Harry shot him from across the pub, as he traversed the sea of tables and wobbly chairs, an overflowing lager in each hand.
“Guess we’ll have to build another shelf. Someplace dark, perhaps,” Harry said with a sigh and set the thing back on the bar, where it caught the light and shot beams of rainbow fractals directly into the eyes of the head of the Mungo’s board. Draco prayed it would catch his toupee on fire.
Draco hummed. "Both, actually. The feeling itself can be quite calming. Euphoric, even. That's why it is used in its benign forms in Calming Draughts, Sleeping Draughts, sedatives, and the like. But regular users will experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, sleeplessness, paranoia."
The Ministry Gala was held in a stately old building a stone’s throw from the Gringotts Bank. It was by no means one of the grandest events of the year, but it was well attended, if perhaps a bit stuffy. The guest list consisted of government officials, the heads of various Ministry departments, past and present Wizengamot members, as well as the affluent. There would be boring speeches and awards bestowed in honour of services given, but the food was nice and the bar well-stocked.
“Been a while,” Potter said. “When was the last time we saw each other? That function at the Opera House? Last June? Been well?”
Things with Eryn didn't improve over the following days, but they didn't get worse. Draco experienced frequent flashes of trepidation over the safety of the shop and, when coupled with the constant trickle of concern for the girl's health, Draco's stress levels were through the bloody roof.
Mrs Marchbanks’ door was already cracked open and Draco stepped right in. She sat upright in her hospital bed, wrapped in her best velvet dressing gown, weighty pearls hanging from her ears.
Draco snarled and snapped, but it was no use arguing with Pansy Parkinson, particularly not when it involved her getting properly fucked. She could be bloody single-minded.
Potter yanks the curtain back into place, and Pansy grabs Draco by the arm, pressing her face into his bicep and screaming silently. She manages to compose herself by the time Potter pulls back the curtain again, this time in a Brunello Cucinelli sport shirt and Prada trousers.
Draco took a moment to stare unabashedly at Harry, not caring a lick who saw. He really was bloody handsome, and Draco planned to boast excessively about shagging an underwear model. Oh, and that the underwear model was also
It was a daydream, of course. Draco wasn’t delusional. Chances were, he’d never have Harry like that. But what he did have was now. He had these strange moments alone with him in Harry’s tiny cabin between the hills. And he didn’t think he was imagining the way Harry clung to him or the way he sighed against Draco's lips. It felt real, the way Harry let Draco inside his body with absolutely no resistance, like he was made for him, built to fit better than a tailored suit.
Harry grinned and felt like his heart might burst from his chest. "Exactly where you left me," Harry said.
Hannah nodded. "She came in yesterday with some old bloke. Horrible jumper. Didn't seem herself. Perhaps her father?"
The Horse Brass was nearly deserted, given the early hour. But the barkeep greeted them with his usual nod, and shortly later, delivered Draco a dry gin martini and a frosty lager for Marcus.
exhibiting such uninhibited delight in soaking Draco like a wet rat. So, Draco did the only thing he could do. He swam right up to Harry Potter, put one hand on his head, and shoved him under the water.
The Paris Portkey Point was in chaos by nine o'clock on New Year's Eve. Witches and wizards in fancy dresses, sequins, silk, and glitter flitted everywhere, grabbing a quick trip to the next big party. A large group of British travellers caught Draco's attention. They couldn't have been a day over twenty, but they were all so glamorous in their dishevelled drunkenness, arms thrown around the shoulders of their friends as they laughed and shouted.
“Mm. Right you are. How about this?” He offered a crisp Tom Ford shirt with a subtle floral print, paired with a slim grey blazer.
“Really? Are you sure about that? Because I seem to recall you appearing in my flat at a rather awkward moment,” Zabini said with a tilt of his head.
“And bring us some of those little stuffed mushrooms with the cheese. Draco loves those. Off you go! Scoot!” Pansy called after them. As soon as they were out of earshot, Pansy rounded on him. “What happened? Where is he? Did he hurt you? I swear to Merlin, I’ll kill him.”
"Not as such. He said…" Lovegood cleared her throat and dropped her voice an octave, "'Some bloody Frenchman faffing about like he's so clever.' Then he kicked that umbrella stand he dislikes. I don't think he meant for it to explode, but sometimes Harry's magic gets a bit… enthusiastic. I thought it was quite funny, especially because when it reappeared, it didn't sit right. Sort of lopsided. I liked it better that way. More character. Hermione didn't seem to agree. She gets that pinched look when Harry's magic goes wonky. Or when he talks about Draco."
That’s all good style is, after all. There is a creative element in defining one’s own personal look, of course, but Draco knows his legs look miles long in slim trousers and that leaving a few buttons on his shirt undone flatters the pale, smooth planes of his chest. He knows that black makes him look severe, but he’s softened by dove grey and pale blue. He knows that a single-breasted jacket with one button is more flattering to his slender frame and that he ought to avoid robes and never let his hair grow long because it makes him look like his father.
Briggs’ expression turned shrewd, her muddy eyes narrowing to slits. “Saw him carted off to hospital a right mess. Looks like the healers will have their work cut out for them this time. Maybe if Potter spent less of his time throwing his life away over Death Eaters and dark wizards, he wouldn't have to spend so much time in the Curse Damage ward. He’s a regular around there.”
He sighed, then nodded, resting back on the pillows, his gaze gone glassy — the potions finally kicking in.
Harry has one elbow still braced beside Draco’s head, but his other hand is gripping Draco’s arse, lifting his hips from the bed to drive harder into his body. Draco hopes it bruises, hopes Harry will leave impressions of his fingerprints on Draco’s skin so that when the alcohol and the lust wears off, he’ll have proof that it wasn’t a dream, that Harry actually wanted him enough to touch him there, to hold him that way.
option," Draco replied with a certainty he did not feel. "In case you weren't aware, London has one of the largest hospital systems in the Western hemisphere, along with one of the most distinct magical communities."
It was a long time before they peeled themselves off the floor, kicked aside the stupid umbrella stand and bloody sword, and tripped up the stairs to Harry's bedroom.
Potter took it, Draco’s face still held between his hands, his mouth pressing kisses against Draco’s temples, until Draco’s body slackened, and he sighed.
"There is no one Harry Potter watches closer than Draco Malfoy. He was furious after that first break-in. Started the whole bloody thing. Though it worked out, because you gave him everything he needed to figure it out. That powdered stuff?"
and his pathetic whines. Just the thought has Harry snarling against Draco’s vulnerable throat. He hates the idea of anyone else being privy to Draco’s mewls of pleasure. Those were for Harry alone.
It wasn't until that moment that Draco felt the ache in his knees, or the stiffness in his back. She gave him a watery smile, and he returned it with a nod, easing himself into the chair with a wince. He looked up to find that Weasley hadn't moved much either, still curled in half in a chair on the opposite side of the bed, staring at Harry's face with a sad intensity that made Draco want to weep. But he didn't. He didn't do anything. He sat there and let the hours pass, waiting for some change, some flicker beneath Harry's eyelids, a twitch in the hand grasped between his own. But nothing happened. Nothing changed.
“You find something about that funny, Malfoy?” Robards tone was benign but his expression was sharp and drenched in loathing.
Harry's attention was drawn away as he leaned down to listen to something Hermione whispered into his ear from her seat on the sofa next to him. But his eyes slipped back up to Draco again and again.
from the stack of magazines that sat on the floor next to the sofa. He tossed it onto the table, his eyes never leaving his papers.
“Actually, Potter, I don’t sleep in anything at all,” Draco retorted, then winced, because that wasn’t the sort of thing he ought to say to Potter.
Potter smirked. "I don't. But that book has very nice pictures." He gestured to the page spread open across the table.
It would be a marvelously fun game, seducing Harry Potter. Draco was just itching for a challenge and Potter had always been his favourite opponent. And when it was all over, Draco would be able to return to his life with a lovely bit of wanking material, an excellent story to hold over his friends from school, and the satisfaction of knowing he’d bested Potter at a game he didn’t even know he was playing. Because if there was one thing Draco loved more than playing, it was
The surgery took all of four hours. It was longer than what Draco was used to, though the magic itself wasn’t as draining as it had been when healing Potter or Weasley. It was, however, delicate and careful work — the fiddly sorts of spells that required unblinking concentration in order to navigate around Marcus’ manual techniques. But Draco was unwavering. When Marcus’ stasis spell slipped and he huffed a frustrated breath, Draco redoubled his efforts. He cast on Marcus’ behalf, and ignored the other Healer’s sceptical raised eyebrow and the disbelieving shake of his head.
Harry casts a wordless, wandless lubrication charm, his palm filling with translucent liquid. “Don’t do it again,” he says, rubbing the slick between his fingers. He trails the fingers over Draco’s hips and over his cock, leaving a shining trail in its path. He drops them between the cleft of Draco’s arse and a delicious tremor wracks his body. Harry presses in just a little, just enough to skate across the soft warm skin, teasing. He’ll never tire of Draco’s arse. It’s bloody fantastic. Best he’s ever had.
Draco groaned aloud, startled by the echo of it in the quiet kitchen. But there was no putting it off, not now. He yanked down his fly and shoved his hand into his pants, leaning heavily against the kitchen counter for support.
Draco barely managed an indignant squawk before Potter was slashing his wand at the entrance to the DMLE and bloody
Draco inclined his head and considered her question. "There is a café below my flat in Paris. They make a lovely lemon tart. The pastry absolutely melts in your mouth, and the lemon curd is just right — nice and bright, not too sweet."
thing, not Harry’s. And the bloke across the bar is definitely wearing a glamour, one of Harry’s favourites, in fact. The bastard could never just pick a plain one, like the one Harry currently wore (and the only one he could manage to maintain after a couple lagers), with the lanky hair and mud brown eyes. No, his were always bloody gorgeous. Harry knows this particular one takes minimal spell work and only certain details are changed. It’s just enough to make him unrecognisable — unrecognisable to anyone but Harry, that is.
Harry smiled softly and shook his head. Hermione and Ron were married on a beach in Scotland. Only Harry, Hermione’s Mum and Dad, and Ron’s immediate family were present. Afterward, they all gathered at the Leaky for what was probably the rowdiest, most boisterous parties Harry had ever attended. Everyone was there. Even McGonagall showed up with a bottle of Elven wine with a bow around the neck.
Emile leaned one elbow on the table, gazing at Draco with fondness in his eyes. "It means he knows you. He knew better than to ask you to stay. Tell Draco Malfoy, 'stay still, don't run,' and he's already twenty paces away. Harry is waiting for you."
"It's what's in them that I like." Draco had to fix his eyes on the perfectly fitted shoulder seam of Harry's jacket to get those words out, but when he glanced back at Harry's face, it was to see his brows twitch inward, smile wavering, for only a moment. But then it returned in full force — nearly blinding.
He dug around in his pockets and pulled out a handful of coins mixed with wadded Muggle pounds, fished out far too much money, and dropped it on the table.
Potter's entire body was shaking, clearly hanging on the edge of orgasm. A thin sheen of sweat coated his back and his hips were rocking shallowly, fucking into thin air. It was so bloody sexy that Draco couldn't hold back a deep, throaty groan. Potter gasped at the vibration, his muscles pulling taut. Draco pressed a finger just inside, swiping the flat of his tongue against the slight opening, and Potter fell to pieces.
Harry’s chin dropped to his chest as he huffed out a laugh. “You’ve got me there. What time should I pick you up?”
Potter snorted and tossed the mass of cording into the back of the car, then used the overhead bar to hoist himself over the side without opening the door, and dropped into the backseat. He leaned forward and unlatched the passenger door, which swung open with a creak.
“You’re awfully confident,” Harry said, turning to him. There was a small smirk on his lips, but his eyes were searching, flicking back and forth between Draco’s own in a way that made him feel flayed open, as if Harry were looking for weakness, a chip in his armour.
"I'm going to go clean up," Draco said, and rolled from the bed. Harry hummed and watched Draco go with half-lidded eyes.
“You think I don’t know?” Theo says, his voice losing its pleading tone and taking on a cruel edge. “Everyone knows you can’t Apparate. What are you going to do, walk home?”
The unreality of the situation slammed into Draco all over again, and before he could think better of it, one of Draco's hands was disentangling itself from Potter's hair to smooth down his jaw. Potter pressed his face into the hand, cat-like, and Draco settled the length of his forefinger in the hollow beneath Potter's cheekbone as he swiped a thumb across Potter's mouth. Potter's lips fell open on a gasp.
“I wanted to see you,” Harry said simply, and Draco’s cheeks heated in response. “Will I always need to make an appointment?”
Draco sighs. He takes a long, slow drag of his cigarette, nearly burning it to the filter in one breath. The smoke pours out of his mouth in a dense cloud that has Harry wanting to tease him about dragons.
"Sometimes I'm just walking the grounds, or sitting in the library with Ron and Hermione. Sometimes it's the Great Hall. Or maybe beating you at Quidditch." He smirked, then it faded. "And other times…" Harry's voice trailed away to nothing, but Draco nodded anyway. Harry didn't have to say it, because Draco knew. He had those dreams too. Had them in bed next to Harry on more than one occasion, and would awaken shouting into the dark, only to have Harry soothe him with a palm against his chest, or fingers in his hair. And Draco did the same for Harry, when it was his turn to have the dreams — dreams of the castle crumbling, of tents in the woods, of dark places, and empty train stations.
Potter kissed with his entire body and it made every kiss Draco had received until that moment seem weak and amateurish. It was more than just passion, though Potter was bloody bursting with it. There was something possessive about the way he spread his fingers wide over the back of Draco’s skull, turning his head to control the kiss, even though Draco was the one with his cock up Potter’s arse. His thighs slid along the outsides of Draco’s; a restless movement as he rolled his hips in time with Draco’s ruthless thrusts.
It was almost alarming, the intensity of his gaze, and Draco frowned, wincing under the pressure of Potter's hand. "I didn't see anything labelled poisonous Dreamless Sleep for arsehole Wizengamot member number five, if that's what you mean," Draco said dryly as he peeled Potter's fingers from his shoulder. Potter must have realised what he was doing, because he let go suddenly. "But a lot of the components were there for certain. And there were two more storage cases next to it. Who knows what else we'll find in them."
“That would be the drugs, the alcohol, the partying, the crime, the Muggles.” He winked and then leaned forward across the table on his elbows. “If you could do anything, be anyone, what would you do?”
Draco finished his drink too quickly and then ordered another. He drained that one as well, letting the soft, fuzzy warmth of the alcohol distract him from the tightness in his chest. He poked at the buffet, but everything tasted like ash in his mouth. He stood on the sidelines as Pansy danced and Blaise chatted. A few brave souls attempted to lure him into conversation, but were soon chased away by the storm cloud brewing over Draco’s head.
Potter rolls his eyes but steps past where Draco is holding back the curtain. “Don’t hold me under for too long. I’ve been known to hex people for less.”
Potter dropped into the chair next to Draco, hands cupped around the mug of tea. "I thought you might like to meet my friends."
Harry hands over the carton, snagging a chip as soon as Draco grabs it, then grins as Draco clucks at him and bats his hand away. Draco settles with his food next to Pansy on a rickety picnic table between the chippy and a closed discount potions shop, dusting away the crumbs of a previous customer. To his horror and delight, Harry sinks down beside him.
Potter must have noticed as well because he was kind enough to hand Draco one of the two glasses of whisky he was holding.
Draco's mouth curled into a smirk, a slowly growing thing that matched the unfurling lust in his belly. He kicked the empty barstool next to him and gestured towards it with a tilt of his chin.
“Why, are they silk? And Prada?” There is a mischievous glint in Potter’s eyes, and Draco’s heart bangs wildly in his chest in response.
Pansy arrives at the shop just as Draco smooths the last of the wrinkles from Blaise’s finished trousers and places them on the hanger.
If someone had told Draco at the age of fifteen that he would one day find sanctuary in Muggle department stores, he would have laughed them right out the front door and slammed it on their arse. But the first time he stepped foot in Harrods was practically a religious experience. He’d never seen anything like it. Wizarding clothiers are highly specialised, catering primarily to tailor-made items in a traditional style. While Draco grew up in a fashion-conscious household, the Malfoy’s were anything but flamboyant in their dour robes of black and grey. There is nothing playful about wizard’s robes, even when made in brightly coloured patterns or adorned with buttons and baubles.
“And on that note, I'd best be off.” Blaise folded the paper and tossed it onto the sofa. “I have a meeting with the American Ambassador at two. They can talk all day, and I haven’t had lunch.”
"This is Michele Renaud, formerly of the French Potions Distribution Authority," Emile said with a meaningful look.
"Clearly," Pansy said and sipped primly from her flute. "Though I can see why you didn't want to miss this. There is no way we're going to make it until nine o'clock without someone attempting to snog the man dressed as St Nicholas. I've seen more than half the ladies from Tariffs and Taxation sit in his lap already."
He liked Harry beneath him. It allowed him some semblance of control, though they both knew that in the throes of pleasure, he wielded almost none whatsoever. He also quite liked the view. Because Harry was wrong; it wasn’t Draco who was beautiful; it was Harry. Draco didn’t know what Harry saw in him, with his too-long limbs, knobby knees and elbows, or the way he turned pink and splotchy wherever Harry touched him. Harry, on the other hand, was a vision of golden skin and raven curls, with a jawline sharp enough to cut, and a smile that was charmingly crooked.
Blaise spun and walked back into the flat. He returned moments later with a day-old Prophet which he dropped into Draco’s lap. The headline read:
Draco was one giant frayed nerve by the time Thursday finally rolled around again. Try though he might, he could not stop thinking about Potter – no,
He thought about having a drink, then decided against it in favour of pacing restlessly from one end of the sitting room to the other.
Harry’s expression went darker than a storm cloud and Draco wasn’t sure who Harry wanted to deck more, himself or Jeremy. Perhaps both?
It was Draco's worst fear made reality — the ultimate defeat. Potter would take one look at him and know that Draco was sick and obsessed and painfully, regretfully,
Draco frowned. Potter was rather cavalier for a man who’d nearly just died, but perhaps it was simply another day for Potter. What with being an idiot and all.
Potter’s strange shift in demeanor over the past few days unnerved Draco. Potter was unusually quiet and cagey when he was normally all fire and crackling magic, wry jokes and warm smiles. Something wasn’t right.
Draco breathed. He breathed in the scent of the fire in the grate, of dried herbs, of the man in front of him.
But time was growing short and Draco had less than four weeks left before he lost his paper-thin excuse to see Harry regularly and to command his precious time.
readers wanted to know what hair product Granger used or where Perfect Potter took the Girl Weasel on romantic dates. They wanted to see their holiday photos and know how they spent their Christmases. It was salt in the wounds of a lonely socialite like Pansy Parkinson.
Potter studied Draco for a moment, his eyes flicking between Draco’s own. Then he nodded once, slowly.
“I’d prefer you not drink while holding scissors this close to my face,” Potter says warily as he drops into the chair and pushes his wet hair back, sending rivulets cascading down his neck that Draco does not trace with his eyes.
“Shut up, Malfoy, I’m talking. Harry is stubborn and headstrong, and he doesn’t listen to anybody. But he listened to you. I don’t get it, but maybe I don’t have to. I couldn’t get to him. Ron couldn’t get to him. Hermione couldn’t get to him. But you did. I don’t know about this weird thing the two of you have, but if it makes Harry happy, and makes him decide to live his fucking life for a change, then, well, I’d be a shit friend if I didn't make sure he has it.”
you. She’ll pair you off with some carrot-topped niece twice removed named Nancy or Mary, who enjoys things like
He was bloody exhausted, but sleep always seemed to escape him in such moments. He turned his head and looked at the empty pillow next to him, waiting for that hot lance of pain and loss that he ought to feel. He’d felt it at first, in those initial few weeks, but it was getting better now. He managed to stay standing, to not double over like he’d been punched in the gut every time he thought about Noah. Every time he thought about Noah and Philip.
Potter's finger's in Draco's hair were beginning to tighten, fingernails scratching deliciously against his scalp, and he knew if he kept it up just a little longer Potter would come down his throat, and Draco would welcome it.
Draco hated this part; the fading afterglow that made Draco feel like a stranger in his own skin. What was he going to say to Harry? Nice seeing you, thanks for the fuck, you've totally ruined me, yet again. Perhaps a simple get the hell out would suffice.
Blaise set his martini down on the glass coffee table and slouched elegantly into his leather sofa, arms stretched across the back, straining the buttons of his shirt. He studied Draco with a knowing expression that made Draco want to squirm.
, with his scowling face and so much angry, wild magic swirling around him like a Balmain coat that it made Draco choke.
Sleep found him quicker than he expected. He didn't notice when the warmth of another body pressed against his side, nor when an arm snaked around his waist and pulled him close.
“Potter, I didn’t know you were offering chauffeur services. I wouldn’t mind a lift to Covent Garden later. I’ve got a date.”
“Oddly specific,” Potter said, the corner of his lips twitching. “I don’t know. She sounds kind of nice.”
“We’ve gone from James Dean to picture book villain, but I suppose you could bring it out at parties. Something to scare the kiddies,” Draco said.
"No more. Please, I need you –" he groaned as Harry twisted his fingers once more, just to watch him squirm. "I need you to fuck me."
But before Draco could find out if Potter tasted as divine as he smelled, he was interrupted by a wisp of blue light that coalesced into the form of a terrier, zipping in circles around Potter's ankles.
"Fine then, spoilsport. Let's get you home." Potter said. He summoned the abandoned brooms and tossed them into the depths of his bag, then held out his hand.
Potter tilted his head, and a grin tugged the corners of his lips. “Yeah, I don’t hate that. But Harry is better.”
Draco's mouth fell open with a gasp and Potter clamped a hand over his mouth, muffling his moans. Draco forgot about his wand, forgot about Edith and the undersecretary, forgot about air, and fucking
“I second Healer Lang’s diagnosis. Miss Melgren, you are free to go. Please check out with the Mediwizard at the desk, and do not hesitate to call if you experience any further symptoms,” Draco said, prodding the parchment on the clipboard with his quill but not actually writing anything.
He took a step back, eyes still narrowed and fixed on the wall. Weasley fell back a pace, feet apart and shoulders square. Even Bridges tightened her grip on her wand, a massive thing that looked like she'd ripped a branch right off a tree.
“Me? Late? Wouldn’t dream of it.” Then Harry stepped away. “Healer Malfoy,” he said with a nod of his head, and left through the door.
“I still don’t. Not to worry Potter, I still think you’re a bastard and I always will. You have my promise.” He jabbed Potter in the ribcage to emphasize his point, even though all he wanted to do was press his lips against his neck. “Any old-timer in a position of power has every right to be afraid of you”
Draco stepped in close, even though he knew he ought to keep his distance. But Draco seemed prone to doing all sorts of things he ought not to these days. "You better," he grumbled and placed his hand lightly in Potter's.
He grabbed a fistful of Potter’s hair and yanked him back with a gasp. Potter’s eyes were dark and a little feral and Draco nearly reconsidered allowing him to stop ravishing him, but no, he had to get Potter horizontal immediately.
Draco wastes no time. He yanks the bow tie from his own neck, because it’s hard enough to breathe as it is with Harry looking up at him with bright eyes and flushed cheeks, and then sinks down into Harry’s lap. Draco rocks forward to press their hips together as he places a hand on either side of Harry’s face. He kisses him, and Harry opens easily for him, sucking his tongue and running hands up Draco’s spread thighs to grip his arse.
Blaise stumbled backward, his brows at his hairline and his eyes wide as he looked at Harry, then back at Draco, then back to Harry.
Draco pursed his lips, contemplating. He'd been in France for five months and hardly spared a word to anyone beyond the necessary pleasantries with the Potions Master, in whose lab and under whose nose Draco was making potentially dangerous combustibles.
Unable to help himself, Draco peered around Potter's broad shoulders to see Shilmore's face go from inquisitive to furious in half a second flat. Fortunately, the mechanics of the Floo prevented the git from seeing the look of delighted triumph flash across Draco's expression before he managed to get it under control.
“Wallet, c’mon, hand it over.” He waggles the knife in Draco’s face, glancing over his shoulder with nervous, darting eyes.
“Philip, so lovely to see you again,” Draco said, smile slimy and words slick with disdain. “When was the last time we saw each other? Oh yes, that’s right. You were wearing
“Stop that. You’ll wrinkle them,” Hermione chided, gently pulling his hand away, squeezing it once in hers, and then dropping it at his side.
Draco did not take commands from Harry Potter and crossed his arms over his chest while Potter kicked the bike to life with one booted foot. The thing rumbled and vibrated so hard it made Draco’s teeth chatter.
The young woman was in Draco’s surgery by eight o'clock the very next morning. Her name was Mary Melgren, and although she was a slight thing, there was a familiar hardness to her expression, a determined set to her shoulders that Draco found immediately likeable. She had a noticeable scar running the length of her face, as Draco had anticipated. Although he was glad to see that it was slim and neat and showed no signs of infection or puckering.
Potter cleared his throat and reached for his pants while Draco buttoned himself up, desperate to cover his nakedness in the light of his verbal blunder.
Shilmore's expression shuttered and his lip twitched in a rather unsightly way. He took Draco's hand in a punishing grip, shaking it roughly. "Cheers, mate. Harry?"
Draco lingered in the shower, using every product in his arsenal, convincing himself it was just a way to brighten himself up after a rare night of overindulgence, and had nothing to do with the fact that he would see Potter later. He carried on with that farce as he carefully selected his wardrobe: dark grey slacks and a shirt with a subtle paisley that did rather nice things for his fair complexion.
Harry lit the cigarette with wandless magic, which made Ron grin and Hermione scowl as she batted away the cloud of smoke.
The rider gracefully dismounted and pulled the helmet from his head to reveal tousled dark hair and a crooked grin aimed straight at Draco.
Draco has to squeeze his eyes shut tight against the tidal wave of aching longing. He doesn’t know what’s worse, never kissing Harry, or kissing him and then having to live the rest of his life knowing what it feels like and that he’ll never get to do it again. But even then, there is no real debate because he’s going to let him. Of course he is. It doesn’t matter how much it hurts when Harry takes it away, or when Draco inevitably has to watch Harry kiss someone else, because he wants to know if it compares to his fantasies, all the times he’s kissed Harry in his mind. He can have this, just this once.
Harry knew how to play poker. He wasn’t even all that bad at it, usually able to best Ron eight times out of ten. But Malfoy was a different beast altogether. There was almost no way he’d win. It was just that he didn’t know if he cared. He saw the way Malfoy went pink when he pulled off his shirt to change earlier, he saw the way his eyes turned dark when he’d caught sight of Harry’s embarrassing magazine photos.
“Could you do that more quietly?” Draco snapped. Potter really wasn’t eating very loudly, but Draco found the silence between them grating.
Just then, Ronald Weasley wobbled onto a tabletop and started some kind of cheer, or song — Draco couldn't really be sure, though he could comfortably say that Weasley was tone deaf.
Pansy tightened her grip on Draco's jacket, the fabric crinkling in her fist as her eyebrows drew together for only a moment, clinging to him. But then her expression cleared, and she released her hold, smoothing the wrinkle in the silk with her palm.
Draco crawled between the cool, clean sheets and closed his eyes, begging sleep to be merciful and take him quickly, but his mind wouldn't stop racing. He hated himself for remembering that night specifically. He wasn't sure if he could come up with a more masochistic memory to wank over.
He sat back, thighs tucked onto either side of Potter’s hips, as he slipped the shirt from his shoulders. Potter’s fingers flexed on the headboard. Draco pushed away from Potter’s supine body and got to his feet, divesting himself of his clothing with measured efficiency. Potter bit his lip again, worrying it red between his teeth, and watched wild-eyed as Draco’s clothes hit the floor.
He ought to give Pansy more credit. It wasn’t as if it had been easy for her to make amends with all their former classmates. Although she would never admit it to anyone, Draco was certain it took an embarrassing amount of apologising and grovelling for her to reach that level of friendship with so many people they once considered their enemies. He also knew that there were many evenings in which Pansy, Blaise, and Greg sat alone with catered food and enough fine wine for an army, only for the Floo to remain cold and the invitations ignored. But Pansy Parkinson was nothing if not persistent. She sent invitations to cocktail parties and garden parties. She delivered gift baskets on birthdays, expensive bouquets for housewarmings, lovely handmade toys to expecting parents. Draco was surprised she hadn’t drained her Gringotts vault with all her well-wishing.
Draco thanked Merlin that Marcus took to schmoozing like a phoenix to flight, because Harry looked edible in his well-tailored black suit and white shirt with the collar open. The tie was in his pocket — Draco knew that because he’d stuck his hand in there to cop a feel when no one was watching. But Draco couldn’t be bothered because he was beyond ready to drag Harry home and let him start apologising for his tardiness.
Draco's stomach jumped, eyes lighting as his hand tightened around his glass involuntarily. He took a drink without thinking about it, and was surprised to find it was fantastic.
“All right, Mr. Potter. You are free to fidget elsewhere. Your robes will be ready by Friday,” Madam Malkin said, tucking away her hovering pins and curling measuring tape with a flick of her wand.
Always one to flaunt his success, Blaise had splurged on season tickets in a private box, which, to Draco's delight, included a choice view of the pitch and comfortable accommodations. Settled between Blaise and Greg, Draco indulged in a pint of lager, as it seemed rather unfit to drink a gin martini or a glass of Cabernet during a sporting event.
Draco hesitated, then settled himself primly on the edge of an armchair and plucked the top folder from the stack. "You think it's a political hit?"
He wished Blaise would come back from wherever he was and distract him. He hadn’t heard anything from the bastard in two weeks aside from an off-handed text on his Muggle mobile that said: contract extended, enjoy the flat, don’t break anything.
“Merlin, you must be in a mood,” Blaise said, looming over where Draco was curled on the sofa. “Have you been sitting around in your pants all these weeks pining for me?”
"Can't imagine they'd include it in the French news. And I was under the impression you didn't read the London papers."
. And Harry is very productive. I think he shut down every Neo Death Eater cell in England after you dumped him."
“Yes, well.” Draco attempted to recover from his shock, but his voice sounded a bit too thin. “She didn’t find my clever use of charms during wand check quite as amusing as you do.”
Draco couldn’t help but wonder if there’d ever been a time where they might have crossed paths — Draco in school and Potter chasing after wild things, both of them nipping at the heels of danger, only to have it elude them once more.
With each word, Draco's eyes grew wider, and he leaned forward in his seat. He cut a glance to Emile, who sat there grinning like the cat who got the cream, twirling the stem of his wineglass between his fingers.
"Is that so? Has Emile been whispering in your ear?" Draco said, pulling out the seat across from Renaud to sit, crossing his legs.
"Be happy, Harry," Ginny said. "Go shag that obnoxious bugger. Forget about the world for a minute. It'll all be there when you're ready to come back."
“That’s what this is,” he explained, turning to Draco. “The Garden of Eden. It is from the Muggle Bible. You remember, from the Nicolas Poussin painting in the Louvre? Oh, we saw one today. Brueghel the Elder. A wonderful painting. God gave to man a perfect world — safe, beautiful, endless resources — with one condition. You see this tree?” He ran long fingers across the marble branches. “Do not eat the apples from this tree.”
open the door to his office. With another sharp yank at his collar, Draco reeled, stumbling backwards and landing in Potter's massive leather office chair. Draco had half a mind to ask Potter what the buggering fuck he thought he was doing, and did he know this jacket was vintage, tailored specifically to him, and rather fucking expensive? But then Potter was crawling into his lap, knees tucked on either side of Draco's hips, and Draco forgot what the hell he was meant to be complaining about because
Draco’s own designs make up a large part of his extensive closet, and yet, he still feels a rush of pleasure when purchasing clothes. A chef still goes out to eat, does he not? And Draco
“I should probably be worried that my wife is kissing Harry Potter on our wedding day,” Mr Weasel said with a frown.
"Aha! Here we are," Potter exclaimed, reaching so deep into the bag that all Draco could see was the messy top of his head. When he reemerged, he was holding two broomsticks in his hand. He tossed them to the ground with a flourish.
Pansy and Draco lingered over their tea. Draco knew she was just trying to save him any uncomfortable interactions with Harry's hoards of worried friends and family. But Draco ached at the distance. What if Harry woke, and Draco missed it? Or what if something went wrong, and he faded away, and Draco was sitting here like a fool, sipping tea and hiding?
Draco arched a brow. "Potter is quite capable of taking care of himself. He did defeat the Dark Lord, if you recall. I highly doubt I pose any threat."
Harry releases the hand in Draco’s hair and shoves him, hard. Draco catches his footing easily — the bastard is so lithe and graceful sometimes it pisses Harry off. He lets Harry crowd him into the nearest toilet stall, falling back a step with each prowling stride. Harry slams the door with a backward kick of his foot. He grabs a fistful of Draco’s collar, crumpling the crisp, white cotton shirt in his hand, inordinately annoyed at the way it is unbuttoned far too low— the way Draco wears it when he wants attention, the way he
it, and that is almost too much for Draco to stand. He wants to pull away and demand Harry tell him who’s done this to him. To know who stroked his neck with gentle fingers as they shoved their cock down his throat that first time. Was it someone he met at the club when Draco was only twenty paces away? Did Harry follow a stranger home and let them take him like this? Draco can’t imagine it,
His fingers are halfway to the buttons at Harry’s throat when a whistle sounds somewhere behind them, followed by a shouted “Get a room!”
Draco garnered a few curious glances, but the barkeep greeted Harry with the sort of warm, good-humoured familiarity that implied Harry had been here many times before. He could see it now, Harry sitting alone on the barstool, his boots hooked into the rungs while he tolerated fishing stories from some weathered old geezer. Or perhaps he tucked himself into this very corner with Weasley, downing whisky, laughing loudly, cheeks pink and eyes bright.
"That's only a few months away," Potter stated, as if Draco didn't have a perfectly firm grasp of the modern calendar system.
Ron squeezed his shoulder with one hand. “Good on you, mate! Houses and secret girlfriends? You’re on a roll! Is it that Chaser Ginny’s been trying to set you up with?”
It was far too cold to be outside without a jacket or a charm, and all the others were cocooned in warming charms or bundled in wool, fur, or fleece. But Draco didn't mind the chill; he was feeling sufficiently flushed as it was.
Draco needed something to do with his hands, so he pulled a cigarette from the crumpled pack in his pocket. He lit it and took a drag, then offered it to Potter, who did the same while Draco marveled over the thought that Potter’s lips had just touched the place his own had been moments ago – like a kiss, but not quite.
Marcus smirked as his office door swung open to reveal a harried-looking young man balancing three takeaway coffee cups and a brown paper bag with the bakery logo.
Later that evening, Draco stepped out onto the busy London street. He pulled his collar up around his neck — a barrier against the early October wind — and extracted a silver cigarette case from his jacket pocket. He clamped the filter between his lips and lit the end with an engraved lighter, inhaling the smoke deep into his lungs until it burned, and the nicotine wrapped his anxious mind in its soft, buzzing warmth.
Draco blinks for half a second then flips, pushing to his knees, his palms dragging across the carpet as he pushes up, a feline curve to his spine that Harry traces with with the heel of his hand.
Potter didn’t say a word, just stalked to the evidence window, tension and magic still crackling around him like static electricity. Draco took the opportunity to look his fill, without Potter’s unnervingly green eyes watching him.
It was just one more thing for Potter to martyr himself over. Oh, poor pathetic Malfoy, so in love with the scar-headed idiot that he'd almost offed himself by accident. Potter likely felt sufficiently sorry for himself on that one. Not sorry enough to do anything about it, of course. He'd probably gone to Granger and Weasley, all tearful and ashamed that he'd nearly managed to take Draco's life a second time. No doubt they'd coddled and consoled him, told him not to beat himself up over it, to forget about it. It was only stupid old Malfoy, after all.
"Where is all the staff?" Draco asked, curious, glancing around the empty room. "This place ought to be packed with people considering the amount of product they put out."
“Sorry, am I interrupting?” Potter asked, an elbow propped against the door jamb, a paper takeaway cup in one hand.
everything that's wrong in my life. Everything I've ever done, it's always you in the wings judging me, beating me, proving that I'm fucking nothing."
Potter accepted the glass hesitantly, and sure enough, the hovering politicians began walking straight toward them as soon as Draco began his exit.
Potter’s eyes did the flashing thing again, and Draco had the urge to sink into the floor, or punch him. He refrained, though only just.
They were so close. Harry could almost taste the tequila, lime, cigarette smoke of him on his tongue. His hands moved of their own volition, first curling their way around Malfoy’s hips, up his back, and over his shoulder blades.
Harry keeps doing stupid things like flexing his fingers on Draco’s waist to ease his bruising grip, when all Draco wants is for him to hold on tighter, to mark him and own him and take what’s bloody
Harry sighed and yanked his sweatshirt over his head, mussing his hair and exposing so much skin so quickly that Draco nearly fainted.
Her expression went a little soft, but not pitying, never pitying. “Well, how about you start with what you
They probably thought he was moping over his broken heart or pining over Ginny (they always imagined things between them were more serious than they were), but they had it wrong. Harry was
Draco barked out a laugh. And once he started, he couldn’t stop. He laughed long and loud with his head thrown back. He grabbed the box out of Harry’s hands and tossed it onto the kitchen counter. He flung his arms around Harry’s neck and kissed him, hard, and Harry’s look of baffled confusion melted away, his face splitting into a grin.
Potter's eyes lit on Draco the moment they opened, and his lips began to curl upwards, then froze. The telltale crease formed between his brow, and he pushed himself up on one elbow.
Lovegood patted his hand gently. "You needn't worry so much, Draco. Everything will be just as it ought to be." Then she stood, arranging her skirt and collecting her purse. "I have to be off. But it was very nice talking with you."
“I’m quite certain you could have, but I was happy to help. Anything to undermine the Lord Chancellor of the Land Right Registry. Lennox Lachlin has been sitting pretty in his corner office for far too long.”
Even though it made his gut twist and his throat tighten, Harry couldn’t stop imagining it. He couldn’t stop torturing himself with thoughts of Draco with another man because, for some sick reason, Harry felt like he deserved it. He let the pain and the jealousy lance through his heart again and again because it was what he got for wanting a man like Draco. It was what he deserved for having feelings for someone who could never return them.
Marcus took a long drink and then licked the foam from his top lip with a noisy smack that had Draco’s nose wrinkling in disgust. Unfortunately, it only seemed to encourage Marcus.
Draco hands fisted in Potter's hair, tugging handfuls to twist Potter's head to the side so he could plunge his tongue deeper between his lips. As Draco sucked Potter's tongue into his mouth, Potter's hands dropped back to his arse, squeezing tight enough to make him hiss as he ground the hard line of his cock against Draco's thigh. And then Potter was shifting, rolling his hips subtly, fingers kneading into Draco's flesh. And bloody hell, it felt like being fucked right there on the dance floor. Draco moaned, the sound lost to the thump of the bass.
Draco knew that, of course. He could see it now, the herds of gingers shouting and slugging each other, fighting over some pathetic little gifts, all in their matching woollen jumpers. He couldn't see the appeal.
He pushed himself off the desk and flopped into the chair opposite Draco. He crossed one booted foot over his knee and fiddled with the laces.
"Merlin, Potter. Who have you been fucking?" Draco asked on an exhale, pushing his sweat-damp hair from his forehead. He realised a second too late that it was probably not a good question to ask, but he couldn't help but wonder.
Draco clucked at him and returned to his sutures. When he finished, he sat back and pushed his glasses into his hair, admiring his perfect work.
As soon as they were through, Potter collapsed onto Draco’s sofa and started tugging at his tie, undoing the top two buttons of his shirt as he went. He propped his feet on Draco’s new coffee table and Draco swatted at them, tutting.
She fell back a step when Draco got to his feet, looming over her from his considerably loftier height. She held up her hands in surrender, though she was still smirking.
is reserved for friends and family, for people Potter likes. And Draco desperately wants to be someone Harry Potter likes. Though he isn’t sure he can squeeze the name from his vocal cords without wincing, he plans to practise in his mind until it slides off his tongue with ease.
“Yeah, fine. Just needed a minute.” Harry scrubbed a hand across his face as his friends approached, one standing on either side of him, not too close, but present, solid, comforting.
He lit the cigarette, luxuriating in that first sweet drag, watching as the smoke curled away from his lips and nostrils into the air. It was still early in the spring, but the air smelled lovely, even though there was a bite to it yet.
“Fucking brute,” Draco says as his head falls back against the metal door with a thunk and Harry attacks that long, pale expanse of neck with his mouth and teeth.
“I don’t need your judgement, Potter,” Draco said, taking the glass from him, their fingers brushing lightly. “It’s my birthday. Be nice.”
Draco released him. The bartender hummed. He patted a hand on the bar, his eyes lingering on Draco's mouth and then his throat before he turned away. Draco admired the man from behind with a wicked grin. Perhaps the night wasn't ruined after all. Just so long as Harry Potter stayed far,
He did. Draco knew exactly what it felt like. He’d experienced it the moment Potter’s wand landed in his palm. But he couldn’t force the words from his mouth, completely in shock as he was. Draco had assumed it was one-sided, that only
“So you’ll come? Of course you will,” Emile murmured into Potter’s ear, already guiding him towards the door with a little squeeze of his arm. “My goodness, Harry, your shoulders! Do you exercise? So
“Over there.” Harry pointed to the stack of boxes and Draco realized he’d been standing frozen in the doorway.
That was true, and Draco was bloody grateful. Harry swore regular flying was helping his rehabilitation after an injury he’d sustained the previous summer and had since taken to keeping a couple brooms in Draco's coat closet. He’d bullied Draco into flying with him sometimes, though he still managed to fly literal circles around Draco. Draco even spent extra time practising while Harry was back in London, and was almost up to his old tricks. But Harry always seemed ten paces ahead, the bastard.
“That’s because I’m the only one in England doing it. It is yet untested, but I’ve had some success in the past. With your permission, I would like to bring your case before the Board. If it goes successfully, there is a chance it could change… well… everything.”
Draco studies him, searching Harry’s face for some guidance — something that says Harry would like nothing less. But Harry just stares out into the crowd blandly as he sips his drink, and Draco deflates.
“I’ve got nothing else on my schedule this afternoon. And I’d say we earned it. Don’t you think we’ve earned it?” Marcus asked the nearest Mediwitch, who shrugged helplessly. He waved her off with a huff and threw an arm around Draco’s shoulder. He spoke more quietly into his ear. “And if I leave you here, you’re just going to sit there staring at him and fluffing his pillow like a mother hen. He won’t wake up for hours, Draco. Come on. Take a breath.”
Draco sets aside his wine and steps up to where Potter is seated, and without preamble, combs fingers through his hair. Potter sucks in a surprised gasp, eyes going wide.
“Not what I meant,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “I have no privacy. Anyone I date is either there for the attention or ends up hating me because of it. Muggles don’t know who I am. It’s easier that way. Without the expectations.”
"Oh, that's rich," Draco spat. "I imagine it must be terribly difficult, being you. However do you find the time for yourself between all the victory rallies and photoshoots? The adoring fans and simpering women? The suffering must be unimaginable. Did you just run through all the fanny amongst our own kind and decided to turn your attention to Muggles? Variety is the spice of life, after all. Or is it because no one is good enough for you, oh great Saviour mine?"
Potter hissed at the touch, leaning into it as his eyes fell shut. He placed his palm across Draco's chest, parting his already unbuttoned shirt and running his hand up his sternum to curl around Draco's neck. Potter pulled him close. Draco dragged his hand up Potter's length, feeling it harden through the cotton of his pants. Draco moved slowly, teasing the tip with the flat of his thumb as Potter shuddered beneath his hand. Their mouths were only a breath apart, but they didn't touch. When Draco curled his fingers around Potter's clothed cock and gave it one firm stroke, Potter moaned, and Draco couldn't help himself.
Draco wants to say yes. Yes, you hurt me every fucking day and I’ll let you for as long as you want, just please don’t leave, please don’t kick me out, please let me have this sometimes. I promise I’ll be good to you. Just let me prove it. But what he says is, “No. I’m fine.”
“You’re overthinking the Apparition. It helps if you can see the place you’re going in your mind. Feel it.”
“Are you trying to kill me?” Harry asked, looking at the shot glass like a venomous snake about to attack.
"Draco, don't," Emile warned, shaking his head. "You can't mix liquefied unicorn horn into an infusion of wormwood. It's unstable. Potentially poisonous."
Draco knew he fancied men, rather exclusively. He'd known since third year when he'd seen Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, strip out of his kit after Quidditch practice, and Draco's knees turned to jelly. There had been a few messy kisses and fumbling gropes to completion with Theo Nott in the Slytherin dormitories, but it was born of nothing more than convenience and a mutual desire to get off, and Theo preferred fanny anyway.
“I told you, I don’t like wearing them. But it was a very nice gesture,” Potter replied, though nothing in his tone suggested he found anything nice about it.
, carrying on as if the world hadn’t come crashing down around them, as if their future hadn’t been dashed to the floor.
Draco decided not to tell Pansy that yes, he had in fact pulled Potter's hair once. Potter let it grow long and sometimes tied it in a stubby knot at the back of his head to keep it out of his eyes. And one Tuesday, Potter was just standing there in the crowded lift, directly in front of Draco, looking grim and worn around the edges. It was distracting, and before Draco really thought about it, he'd given that dark knot of hair a sharp tug. Potter had whirled around, his face going from furious to amused quick as lightning. And when Draco exited the lift at the next floor, he was sure to put in an extra sway to his hips. He could feel Potter's eyes on him until the lift doors shut, and Draco spent the rest of the afternoon glowing.
“You’ll kill Harry Potter?” Draco said with a snort, though something warm and affectionate bubbled in his chest.
Pansy’s sharply arched black eyebrow twitched. “Fun? Have you been having fun with Harry Potter, Draco? I thought you were just playing house and spending his money. Is there something more?”
“You’re the one who pushed me!” Potter argues, but any further disputes are lost to a groan as Draco runs his tongue over the shell of Harry’s ear.
But now? Draco was stagnant, frozen in time as the world moved around him. Waiting for something to change.
“It’s Luna’s place,” came Potter’s voice from the other room, and Draco huffed, because of course it was. “She’s letting me crash here for a few nights because my Healer is an arse who won’t let me Portkey home.” Potter peeked back around the corner and held up a bottle of beer and tipped it in Draco’s direction. “You want?”
The lost, dejected expression painted across Harry’s face makes Draco’s traitorous heart ache and it makes him so bloody furious he has to grind his teeth until his jaw creaks to keep from screaming.
Draco asked what on earth Harry Potter was doing flying around like a Muggle? Did the baby have a name? And yes, Draco supposed he would accept an invitation for a drink, but Harry was buying, and he would expect something other than firewhisky or the lager Harry drank that looked like it was fished from the Thames, and didn't taste much better.
, on the carpet, with a stack of magazines. He declared it ‘research,’ and set about dog-earring pages featuring acceptable, non-Ikea furniture. To which Harry called him a lazy brat and a few other choice names that Draco did not bother to acknowledge.
Draco hesitated, but then capitulated at Emile's pointed glare, and pulled the letter from the pocket of his waistcoat. Emile scanned the words, then scoffed. "Is this what young people call flirting these days? 'Best wishes?' Pathetic." He tossed the letter aside. "I could send him some naked pictures."
Then there was a cool breath against his face, the softest press of lips across the scar once, twice, three times.
“Hi,” Potter says with a grin — the one with the dimples and all the teeth that makes Draco’s stomach swoop and his throat go dry.
Potter must have caught him, because the next thing Draco knew, a warming charm slipped around him like a cloak. Draco shivered again, though this time it had nothing to do with the chill.
“Don’t touch it, you idiot,” Draco snapped. Potter had no sense of self-preservation if he went around poking at potions in restricted labs. Not that any sort of restrictions ever seemed to apply to Harry bloody Potter.
"I invited him to the opening," Draco said, snagging a cloth from behind the counter, wetting it with a spell, and wiping the champagne from his sticky hand.
Draco was surprised that the earth kept spinning, that the tides bothered to change, that the sun would even consider bloody rising again because it was as if everything shifted. Draco’s entire world dismantled itself and rearranged its pieces around Harry. Draco wasn’t sure how he’d convinced himself he could return to his old, empty life — not after this. It would be like every night without moonlight. Coffee without cream. Sex without love.
“I knew you’d be like this,” Harry says, lips skating across Draco’s chest. “Exactly like I imagined.”
Draco had invited Harry over that night and part of him desperately wanted to leave off and apparate to the penthouse to spend the final hours of his twenty-eighth birthday fucking away his worries over the London skyline. Because that was what Draco wanted, wasn’t it? That was why he invited him – to fuck. Harry wanted to, of course he did. It was some of the most brilliant sex he’d had in years – hell, probably some of the most brilliant sex he’d had in his life. And he could manage it. He could manage a bit of no-strings-attached sex to take the edge off the loneliness. He was young and single and that was the sort of thing he thought he ought to be doing. It was just a bit of fun.
