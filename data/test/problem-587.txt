"I do think it's worth it... Draco, you're so different now, after everything that went down last year and...I feel like I'm growing attached to you...I like you and I wish I could do more with you than just meaningless sex." Draco was a bit taken aback at this. "Potter, I told you. I'm not the boyfriend type."
"Look, Malfoy... I don't know if I...can."
"Oh, fuck!" the blond boy cried out, wrapping his legs around Harry's waist to push him deeper inside of him. "Don't stop."
Going to Herbology was hard as ever. It took students several minutes to get through all that snowy path. Neville even fell once, finding himself sinking into the snow. But he would never miss an Herbology lesson, so he got up and went anyway. When he got to the greenhouse, he was shivering so much that Professor Sprout had to send him straight to the Hospital Wing.
"He's telling the truth." said Hermione. She rose back up. "We need to get to Harry, before he does anything stupid."
"Dreaming of Malfoy, eh?" Ron's voice almost startled him. He looked at his best friend, who was sitting on his bed, giving Harry a blank stare. Oh shit, he had talked in his sleep. He didn't know what to say now, but he was certain that Ron would have killed him.
"But it's in a week? I mean, it's impossible to find the dresses in little to no time!" Hermione squeaked.
Bill and Fleur came to visit one weekend, while George and Angelina stopped by for a day to announce the woman's pregnancy.
The moment he began unwrapping, he knew what it was. His mouth dropped as he saw a cage with a tiny owl inside. It was a snowy owl, looking exactly like his late Hedwig, except for some brown spots on its head.
She had appeared out of nowhere, true, but he knew that her heart wasn't as black as her husband's. After all, she had lied to the dark lord to keep him safe.
But, boy, was that hard.
He could finally breathe again.
"Here I am, ready for this binge!" the elderly lady said, as she jumped on her chair.
"Ah, guys..." Draco said, addressing both him and Pansy. "Did I ever tell you that I love you?"
Muggles were weird.
"He so did!" Hermione said in a loud whisper, still shocked at what Harry had just done.
However, Ginny had been unable to look at Luna, so she didn't know whether she had been simply petrified or fatally harmed in the fall.
Although his friends were expecting  some kind of reconciliation between him and Ginny, he wasn't up for it. He was only hoping that the girl wouldn't replicate her Great Hall Harry and Draco bashing as a Christmas present.
"Well she hasn't seen her parents in four months, can you blame her?" said a nearly exasperated Harry. Although, neither he nor Draco could have possibly related to how she must have felt.
"Why didn't I just leave you to die in the fyendfire?"
"What is going on here?" said Headmistress McGonagall, as she had heard the 'expelliarmus' from minutes before. "Are you dueling in the Great Hall?" She was quite angry, but she stopped her scolding as soon as she saw what had just happened.
"And that's why we can feel your pain, Ron." said Draco, "But Hermione would want you to have fun with us here. I'm sure she misses you too, but she's trying to enjoy her time with her family. And you should too, while you can. We will do our best to make it as good as possible for you."
It was red, with a golden belt loosely knotted around the waist, suggesting the colours of Gryffindor house - strongly representing the bride and groom's unity, as they were both Gryffindors in their Hogwarts years.
"Let's go, Ron." She ordered. "I don't want to hear anything that this traitor has to say. "
When they parted, both of them were smiling at each other. "I will be your girlfriend, by the way!' Ginny said. "If you want me to!"
"Oh, he went to say hi to George, his parents are here to talk to the Headmistress and George tagged along." The girl answered.
"Harry's got a point." Said Ginny. "But if Draco's not bothered by his behaviour anymore... I'm guessing Jean Jaques is a decent guy."
Harry noticed that, above their head, were beautiful colour-changing chandeliers that shifted from red to gold, to green, to silver.
There it was, forgiveness. Ginny couldn't believe it, Harry had just forgiven her. She let out a long sigh of relief.
Ginny smiled back at her, then she turned to Draco. "And Draco, when Harry is with you... he's literally the happiest man in the world. The way he looks at you... He's so in love with you, I don't think it's even remotely possible for him to want to divorce you."
That was what it took for Draco to forgive him.
"Ok, then... I think we're ready."
It was all too much for him. If he had to make peace with the loss of his parents, receiving a threatening letter didn't help. What were they trying to obtain?
Miss Jones flashed her a bright smile. She was sitting at a desk, still in her Quidditch uniform, a quill in her hand.
They let Hermione and Ron sleep in Hermione's room, on the condition that they had to leave the door open.
For once, he had beaten Harry at something.
Throughout the next days, the hatred for Jean Jacques spread among Harry's friends, as well.
Ginny clapped her hands, smiling, although she was a bit bummed that Gryffindor had ended up in the third place. At least, it wasn't the worst one.
"When I learned that it was Pansy, I couldn't believe it. I mean, I worked on... Some plans with her, but, really, this one is beyond me." Said Ginny, still incredulous.
The Ravenclaw rolled her eyes. "Fine, but I also want a reward later."
"I can't either! It feels like yesterday that we hated each other..." Harry responded, raising his head to look at the other boy.
"Must have been occupied. Maybe by a couple." Luna said nonchalantly.
Plus, Harry's excitement upon seeing the love of his life speak highly of his favourite place in the world had momentarily distracted him from his sadness.
They were all in the Gryffindor common room, waiting for everyone to be ready to travel by portkey.
Around five minutes later, Narcissa's rum was almost finished. Harry wondered how such a fragile looking woman could drink this fast.
"All molesting types." Said Draco, shaking his head in disbelief.
Laura was laying the table for Easter feast in the dining room.
"Do you..." The alleged fairy moved on to ask the question to the remaining two.
Worth losing his family... He knew that his father would have murdered him.
"Morning, Mione." said Harry. "I think Ron's trying to clean his feet with the toilet brush." He said, chuckling softly.
There, dancing at a wedding,he was even more joyous. He was not afraid to show anyone that he loved him, another male. And his love for him was stronger than any spell, it was simple and pure and it was all it took to make him happy. He wanted to feel this way forever.
In Harry's bedroom, the now rekindled Harry and Draco, were in their post orgasm state, bodies and minds intertwined, while lying in bed, still naked.
"What if Harry divorces me right away?" Said Draco, his head poking from the bathroom.
Draco chose to ignore it, though. It was probably that he was happy that his once fellow players had just gotten married. After all, George and the rest of the Weasleys were Harry's chosen family.
Everyone noticed it, even Ron, who had been fangirling over the Harpies Beater signing a piece of parchment.
That woman was too beautiful and breath taking to care.
She was sitting next to Ron with some books in her hands, they were both cross legged.
"Oh, he's spending Christmas with us, dear." said Molly, giggling nervously.
"Even with this stupid potion my hair won't look decent!" Harry groaned in frustration.
Ginny's face was rather shocked. She gave Pansy a look, her mouth still open. Pansy was also taken aback. No one said a word, the whole of the Great Hall was still in shock.
"Ah, yeah, I recall. Right after we did it, you said it was a 'mistake', I quote." Draco said, taking in air quotes.
"Well, yesterday... Don't act like you didn't fool me into thinking you'd kiss me."
The other girl was still livid with rage.
The two girls were holding hands on the table. They let their hands go as soon as she saw them.
Luna broke their kiss to bring her lips onto the other girl's neck.
Luna couldn't suppress a gasp.
A fortnight later, it was time to leave Hogwarts for Easter Break.
They both laughed hysterically.
"Come on, I know a way to make all this stress go away." Draco whispered, lightly brushing Harry's lips with his own and breathing against them, all while he grabbed his left buttcheek firmly.
Draco remembered those jumpers from a few years back, they were truly horrible.
"Please, listen to me." Ginny pleaded. She was fidgeting with her hands, apparently from the nervousness.
"Guys, I will miss this school so much! I will miss seeing you every day!" The green eyed boy said, throwing himself at his best friends, who had pulled away from Ginny.
At this, Ginny blushed.
"Yes, three-" Harry began saying, but Narcissa shook her head.
Draco set his gaze back on him. His future husband was crying.
"I'm almost ready!" He shouted back.
Draco had never seen it from the inside before. It looked definitely old, he observed, but it had that atmosphere of cosiness that he could not ignore. It looked much like the tree house that he used to have in his own garden as a kid, for there was a lot of wood on the walls and ceiling.
They all spent a very calm , happy Christmas eve night. They went to bed pretty early, as they were knackered because of the long journey from Hogwarts.
But now that she was alone, doing her homework, she couldn't help thinking about how awkward Christmas would have been.
"Maybe you're right." Harry considered, "Maybe I should break up with her..." He wondered why he'd never had this thought before. Did it really make sense to be with someone he didn't like?
Blaise tried to argue, but Goyle tugged on his arm. Draco smiled because he saw fear creeping up on Gregory's face. "Let's go, Blaise." Goyle said, "These fairies are not worth getting detention over." But both Harry and Draco knew that this was his fear speaking. He had become a scared little shit upon thinking that Harry was taking his wand out. After all, Harry had defeated the darkest wizard of all time.
His only companion was Pansy. She had been the one to reverse the mouth zipping spell.
"And Ginny... Mione and I are going to study under the tree, if you want to come..."
"Yes. I mean, you're a cute girl, you're my only friend. Why shouldn't I like you, you silly." Luna said with one of her dreamy eyed smiles.
He wasn't sure if he knew, but, given the Wizarding World being small, he wouldn't have been surprised had the news spread overseas.
When Luna reached the lavatory, she heard retching noises coming from one of the stalls.
"Harry? Are you ok, mate?" he asked. "Are you afraid you will make a fool of yourself? I mean, look at my sister!" He then pointed to where Luna and Ginny were, spinning around like fools.
Hermione noticed it. "If that had been Ron, I would have made sure that he would eat."
Her initial reaction was fear, but then she relaxed when she saw that the hand belonged to Fleur.
Harry's expression was unbelievably serious. His green eyes narrowed and stayed put on the Malfoys, who were listening to him while feeling defeated.
"Do you think I look cute like this?" Luna asked Ginny, while entering the room.
"Is he there yet?" a fire-faced Harry spoke.
"Yeah, that's what they all say, right?" Harry laughed in frustration. Then, he froze in horror at the realisation. "Job well done, Malfoy! You really outdid yourself on this one! You're incredibly disgusting!" He shouted.
"What do you want, Potter?" Blaise asked in a bitter tone. "Looking for trouble, you faggot?" As he said he got into Harry's face. Harry's hand was in his pocket, aiming for his wand.
Hagrid was the one to interrupt the sweet moment. "Sorreh to interrupt yeh, but it's time ter go." He said, placing his enormous hand on both Hermione and Ron's shoulders.
A good way to hide his insecurities was bully other people.
"No, no!" Draco cried. "You!" He had the most disgusted look on his face. He was determined to hurt those two foul women, so he tried to run after Ginny but Harry grabbed him by his robe.
"Wow, it's really cool! I guess I will make some irritating potion for you when you get under my skin, Potter." Draco said teasingly. "Now, yours."
"Oh, this is technically a muggle weddin'. If you had seen a real one in our world, boy, yeh probably woulda fainted from the shock." The half-giant chuckled.
"Your team will survive." said miss Sivan.
Great, he was the last person that Draco wanted to have a conversation with, in that moment. Why did Pansy have to go? Having her there would have given him a shield, at least.
"Wow, Draco, Harry consumed my ears with his wailing! 'I miss Draco this, I miss Draco that'" Ron said teasingly, sipping his drink.
Harry stood for a moment and looked at the place that had been his home for many years.
"You English people are so uptight." said Jean Jacques, leaving Draco's bed. "Good night Dracou."
"Hell, he even had a dream about the bloke, didn't you, Har?" Ron said to his grilfriend, who gasped. "Wow, this is serious.. look, if you're gay... I'm down with it. But if it's with Malfoy... I'm not. He's a prick!"
"Laura, Don! We're here!" Rosemary said, banging on the door.
Luna thought that Ginny, in that moment, looked like a strawberry, her favourite fruit- her body was filled with freckles and it was embellished by her fiery red locks.
"These, my love, are ice skates." Harry explained. Then, he made another chair appear, sat on it and gave himself a pair of skates as well. "These are used to skate. It's kind of like dancing, but on ice." He concluded, smirking.
"Happy fourth month-and-a-half-a-versary, baby girl. Here," the Ravenclaw girl pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket. "This is us."
Ginny thought that changing the subject would be a good idea, so she turned to Draco and Harry and asked them about their talk with Narcissa, as they had not been able to discuss it before.
As the pale man opened his mouth to cast a spell, his son disarmed him.
"...and this is Ronald, my boyfriend." Hermione said nervously.
So, it was true. Draco nodded, thinking about how fast news traveled through the world.
So, nargles actually existed and the Lovegoods bred them? She wondered if the nargles Luna hated so much were the ones who had escaped from her backyard.
Harry swam closer to the blond boy and put an arm around his shoulders.
Not long after the proposal, it was time to say goodbye to Hogwarts.
So, it had gone well with Mrs Weasley, but her husband was nowhere to be found, still.
They were what Harry had seen, hence his proposal of using the veritaserum, he knew he would have obtained a confession.
What if Jean Jacques had been a spy the whole time? Maybe sent in by Lucius to break them up.
She'd used a glass vase of flowers as a centerpiece, they were a bunch of pink roses.
The Bride and Groom even drank to them.
Blaise waved, smirking.
Narcissa's eyes widened greatly as she was being taken away to a location of temporary custody.
"This is all my fault." she said. She was standing at the door, thus facing the two of them.
"We love you all. And now... time to drink!" He shouted.
Harry bit his lip. She looked convincing, he had to admit.
"Thank you for agreeing to this, babe." Draco said to his lover as they made their way to the three broomsticks, holding hands.
Great, now Harry was trying to guilt trip him into feeling ungrateful. Was he for real? He had been the one making the effort, not Harry, nor the Weasleys. He had been the one to suck it up and face people who disliked him, just to spend the Holidays with his boyfriend.
Now, it was only Draco, Harry and Pansy on the spot.
Its rosy tones made Hermione wish that it would end up being her and Ron's suite.
The boys looked at the sheet, they had both got a D.
Then, they began their secret escapades in the Room of Requirement, which were meant to stay meaningless.
"Don't lie to me." Harry warned, raising a finger.
Quidditch practice had been postponed so many times in the last month, given that everyone had been busy. But now, the only missing player was Harry.
He knew that in UK, in that year, same-sex marriage was not legal.
The two girlfriends were both fans of the Welsh team, so they picked matching hats and Omioculars.
"So, for the power invested in me by the French Ministry of Magic, I now pronounce the people on my left as Husband and Husband and the people on my right as husband and wife."
"Love you too!" Hermione replied, then her attention fell on Harry. "Harry, you suck! Why didn't you say 'I love you too' to her?"
"I do not want him in my house!" He snapped furiously.
"Good. Because I would cut him."said Harry.
"It's not like you need to have a tea party with them! You just have to sleep in the same room as me and hang around my common room." Draco sat up as well.
"Laurent! Fabron! Segal! Deschamps! Travers! Brun!"
"Thanks!" she responded with a giggle.
"Saw what?" Draco asked innocently.
"Whatever, it's not like we didn't use it for the same reason not one day ago!" Harry chuckled.
"Night." Draco murmured, then he ran after his boyfriend.
Chapter Warning : girl on girl, NSFW
Her hand was a bit stained with ink from the many signatures she had placed on things.
"Oh, he's just at this Defence Against the Dark Arts remedial lesson with Sivan." He responded absent-mindedly.
The intruder watched in amusement as screaming young adults celebrated an union in glee.
"You're such a flatterer, you know that?" The Slytherin said, as he gave him a peck on the lips.
Percy suddenly appeared.
"I only speak from the facts." said Jean Jacques, sporting that confidence only someone full of themselves can pull off.
"...and the spectrespecs are the only mechanism known to man that makes you see the Wrackspurts." Luna concluded, although she noticed how Ginny had been staring at her.
"Maybe it's the nargles that made him change his mind about you..." Luna said in her absent tone. "Maybe it is them... I really don't have a clue... He was so distant..." Ginny said, she then buried her face in her hands.
The two girls ran off, locking arms.
That said, everyone happily dug into the turkey and roasted vegetables.
"Wait WHAT? Am I fucking hallucinating or did you just snog freaking Germain? How long has this been going on?" Harry said furiously. He was livid with anger, while hot tears stained his face.
"Is that... from your father?" Harry asked, aghast.
"Are you staring at me because you want to kiss me?" She said,without thinking. "Because I'd be fine with it."
Who knew Ronald Weasley could be happy with having a baby? He was full of surprises sometimes.
How could Harry have been so stupid? Falling headfirst into a relationship with lying, scheming Draco Malfoy. He should have listened to Hermione.
"Ah-ha!" the Slytherin exclaimed when he found what he was looking for. It was a small vial containing a clear liquid. Its lid read "Veritaserum".
The special gift was a pair of hand knitted gloves, that Luna promptly wore on her ears.
He felt someone climb into bed with him. The next thing he knew, his roommate was lying behind him. Then, an unwanted hand felt him through his pajama pants.
He needed to man up and do it.
Draco wasn't too in love with its looks, but it was still pretty beautiful.
"Such characteristic makes him incredibly odious." Lucius spat with a disgusted expression.
"Honestly, why should you care now? You've been fine all these months, now all of a sudden you get sad. Screw them Draco, you're here with me, with your friends, why should you give them so much thought?" Harry asked.
-------------------------------------------------
However, I could not be in the same room as he was and I had to take the potion every hour.
Harry was not going to stop.
Draco sighed, he wasn't too ecstatic at the thought of spending the holidays with a family who didn't like him. But Christmas at Hogwarts, at this point, wouldn't include his lover. So, he figured he could make an effort.
"And I'm sorry if I fooled you, in any way. I was going through emotional turmoil, as I didn't know who I was. Now, I do. And I am, as you said, in love with Draco." As he said that, he looked at his boyfriend, who was smiling. He turned back to Ginny and continued with his speech.
As soon as Ginny heard "Malfoy", it hit her like a lightning.
"Captain and Seeker Adrian Martin!" the man bowed as he said that name.
The news had gone viral throughout the school, even the Daily Prophet had gotten their hands on it.
He rolled his eyes, he had forgotten to protect himself. But he didn't really care in that moment.
Harry grabbed her by her neck, then he forcefully poured the content of the vial down her throat.
Weasley Burrow, Devon, England, Great Britain."
With one last tear filled look at the cosy Common Room, which enclosed significant memories itself, the four friends left to go meet the rest of the school in the Great Hall. It was time for the leaving feast, but none of them, with the exception of Ginny, was excited for it.
"I threw you on the ground!" Malfoy sneered.
"Quaffle in the hands of Miss Weasley-- Seeker Potter of Gryffindor has seen the Snitch, he's flying his way to it - Slytherin has now gained the quaffle... Slytherin about to score... Keeper Ronald Weasley stops it!" Miss Sivan was saying, while watching the game in awe. Her hair was tied in two very fairy-like buns, but it still spilled glitter.
She just wanted to play the victim, working on her son's pity to get back in his grace.
"Sorry, we're late!" said a puffing Hermione. She waved a hand in the air at the pair, then she skated towards them. Draco was baffled to see that she had such graceful movements on that damned ice. She literally looked like she had walked to them. Ron, on the other hand, was struggling to move an inch. "Oh, Accio Ron's skates!" Hermione said. Her boyfriend flew straight to her, screaming a little.
He had played many games before, but he had never seen such a skilled seeker.
She felt so silly for thinking that her own family wouldn't have given her a warm welcome.
It was even better than the burger he had eaten on his first date with Harry.
As he finished, he put his hand on her shoulder.
No one was triggered by their public display of affection, not even the Slytherins.
Not many days from then, she would have been enduring in NEWTs, her most dreaded exams.
"That doesn't change it. I wish I didn't have to spend Christmas in the same house as her."
He was beginning to consider asking the Headmistress  to make an exception for him and let him hang out at the Gryffindors' as much as he wanted, given his situation. He wondered if he could ever find peace in his own dorm again. But that was unlikely, given how much shit Blaise was giving him lately.
"Yeah, Mum's going to go mad, there will be like... thirteen people in her house!"
Hermione's bushy hair needed taming as they were supposed to attend this Dentist New Year's Gala, an event involving all the best dentists of the country and many important people would have participated.
"Relax, Draco." Harry said, massaging his boyfriend's shoulder lightly.
Harry's gift looked a bit heavy as Draco lifted it with difficulty.
Each minute counted, as Harry could have done something irreversible, given his state.
Hermione began to think that maybe Harry had brought up Draco for a reason. Could it be that reason?
"Hi, Oh Merlin, I love you! I'm your biggest fan! I have a poster of you in my room!" Ginny blurted.
And besides, Draco needed this and he couldn't always speak up for him, his fiancé was perfectly capable of standing up for himself.
Adrian Martin's eyes then fixed on a redhead girl who was talking to his opponent.
"Yes, but father made himself clear. And if you're trying to indoctrinate-"
"No, Lucius." Harry intervened. "You should be ashamed... I shouldn't have spoken in your favor at your trial, I should have let you rot in Azkaban!"
Soon, the floor became a dancefloor and everyone grabbed a partner.
There were two aurors for bodyguards and they both glared at Luna intensely.
"Yeah... This is yet another Holiday in which they completely ignored me." Draco let out.
Luna was the best girlfriend in the world, if anyone thought they had a better girlfriend, they were wrong.
"Oh, hey, Luna! I simply want to look my best, at all times." he said, while getting closer to her in order to hug her. "Aw, and hi Hugo!" he cooed, lightly touching the baby's nose with a finger.
He wanted to spend a civil Christmas.
"I love you, Hagrid, it's been nice to see have you as a friend here. I'm sure I'll see you again many more times!" Said Harry, tightening his grip on his good friend.
"Did you see our kiss, Mrs Weasley?" Asked the Ravenclaw.
Both Harry and Hermione had talked about it dreamily, so Ron and Draco were having high hopes on the dish.
"Go on, Lucius. Disapparate." Narcissa instructed.
When he got on the train, he gave one last glance at the castle.
"Let her speak." said Draco.
And, besides, she had promised Hermione that her secret was safe with her.
"I want you, Harry, inside me." Draco whispered.
"Time to go now, Lucius. You're not welcome here." he said.
When he finished, his body shook because he was sobbing as well.
Plus, he would marry his Hogwarts school sweetheart.
One Saturday morning Draco was determined to ask his boyfriend to stay there with him and spend Christmas together.
Ron had to admit that his girlfriend had a point.
"Hey, baby, it's Ok! You can still visit the school, once in a while, it doesn't mean you will never see it again." Draco cooed, caressing Harry's back gently.
"Oh nice to meet you! Such good looking lads! My name is Rosemary Granger." Rosemary said. Her eyes lit up at she saw those two boys. By the looks of it, she found younger men attractive.
Hermione rolled her eyes at that. "He's just too vile." she said to Luna.
"Guys, you're late!" Said Hermione as she rushed to the door to see her friends.
Even bidding farewell to the rest of his roommates hadn't been an easy task.
"Oh, Harry..." the girl said, "These words are just so beautiful." She was now crying freely. Ron put his arms around her. Harry was pleased to see that Ron, too, seemed to have understood what he had meant.
"Don't be," Hermione reassured. "You have been through worse. I know you can do this."
He smirked at sight of Harry's hard on and proceeded to cup his crotch through his jeans.
"I love you, too, Mione." He whispered.
"But I'm its rightful owner, as I touched it first." Ginny smirked as the blonde kept pulling the egg to herself.
"Ah, right, the gay couple!" Said Laura, not dropping her smile. "It's so good to meet you both. Hermione spoke very highly of you."
The two of them were dancing almost as badly as Ron and Hermione, but at least they had a sense of rhythm. Draco had a hand on Harry's waist , the other one was entwined with the other boy's. Harry gripped his shoulder firmly, even though, often times, it would slide down his arm, due to the sweat.
If even she saw it, it meant Harry was really in love with him.
"You could have tried to at least send me a sign of you still being my mother! Yet you gave me the cold shoulder." Draco snapped.
"I don't have it with me now!" Harry said, sincerely. "Oh damn..."
It was quite big, almost as much as the table was.
She tried to think that maybe she might have been wrong.
"If you say so." Luna shrugged. "Ah, it's so warm here, don't you think?" She said, removing her coat, revealing a low-cut purple dress, with a giant bright pink bow tied around her waist.
"Well, I simply thought that you wouldn't care."Draco said as he was finally put down.
Hermione gave a moan of annoyance, putting her binoculars down. "Ah, Ron, come on! You can do better!" She shouted.
"Clear." Harry responded. They both felt incredibly ecstatic as they dived right into their first official boyfriends kiss.
"A surprise, yes, but not for them... Um, actually, I want to propose to my boyfriend, while I'm at it." he said, playing idly with the glitter on the table, getting it all over his fingers.
Some people turned their heads to stare at them, but they didn't say a word.
"Oh, Harry! Thank you!" She said, wrapping her arms around him. "I hope we can be friends now."
"Don't blurt it out like this, thanks!" Hermione hissed.
"Yeah, one day we will find them and destroy them together." she said.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but he was interrupted by Harry.
The couple stopped walking as they saw Pansy and Blaise coming towards them.
"When?" Ron asked, confused. He didn't remember seeing them kiss or anything like that.
Harry let out a soft moan, which indicated to Draco that he was ready for his tongue to enter his mouth. Harry's thoughts were fuzzy, he felt like his brain was being attacked by one of those spirits that Luna warned him so much about. He opened his mouth, letting Draco's tongue in.
Arthur drove them to the Heathrow airport, from there they flew to Nantes, home of the Tournament.
*****
They all had to hold on to their scarves to prevent them from flying away.
Draco's heart sunk in his chest when he saw that it was the frame containing their most adorable picture. He picked it up with trembling hands.
His voice sounded exactly like Pansy's puppet.
"Oh, God, what was that?" said Hermione, startled.
Everyone laughed, even Draco.
"So, does zis mean we can start over now? Be friends?" The French boy suggested.
"Just wear yours." Draco said, rolling his eyes.
He knew that, in that moment, there was nowhere else he'd rather be.
It was Pansy Parkinson, her old bully.
It hadn't been made official to him, but he knew already, it seemed.
"I told you, dear, he can not always be available for communication, given his situation." His wife reassured. She walked closer to him and place a loving hand on his shoulder. "You will see, he will be here any minute."
Reluctantly, Harry got up, with a groan.
They both embraced their daughter so warmly that Draco couldn't help feeling envious.
She felt a bit weird while digging her fork in her ration, as everyone was looking at her with held breaths.
"I mean, Mione had to go to that stupid muggle teeth doctor party just to please her parents,
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm glad I did, I would have been with you much earlier had I not been so scared." The redhead said.
The boy gasped at the sight of a mini potions set.
He must have had French origins.
Draco and Harry told them all about it and everyone thought that Mrs Malfoy was very interested in the public recognition that would have come to her for her son's marriage to the Chosen One, but saw it as a simple reminder of the Malfoys being material people.
He took a breath. It was now or never, he had to man up and apologise to the person he loved. They'd had a terrible fight, but it wasn't so serious - not to break them up. This was only a matter of pride.
After the last sentence, the howler self destructed, leaving its shreds on Hermione's bed.
"Oh, I'm sixth year now... I don't study what you study..." Ginny said, sheepishly.
"There's another girl, right? Is this why you were so distant? I thought it was the NEWTs pressure!" She was screaming at this point. Of course she would think that he was cheating on her. The dream didn't count.
"Oh, relax, Dracou." said Jean Jacques, putting his hands out in defense. "I just felt alone and wanted to cuddle wiz you." the French guy explained himself.
The two girls got changed in the bedroom, while Draco went into the even fancier bathroom.
"Oh, but I don't like girls... I was just thinking of..." the redhead tried to say.
"Bye girls! Have fun!" the brunette said.
He decided that a bath in the Prefects Bathroom had to be to in order, so he made his way to it- it was the best way to calm his nerves.
But they didn't go right away.
The first to enter was Hermione, her arms linked with her father's.
He couldn't believe how unpleasant this guy was. And he had just met him.
He smiled awkwardly. There was really nothing else he could do.
What were those questions about? Was this guy some kind of a fanatic who knew too much?
Draco looked at Ron and Hermione giggling at whatever Harry had told them, he found it so annoying that Ginny had just gone to leave her Potter seat to those two goons. "You just can't help yourself, can you?" Blaise said, thinking that his friend had been staring at Weasley's ass this whole time.
She was considering telling her that hens were the ones infesting her garden, not the nargles.
"Now, when you soar, your first thought must be balance." the Gryffindor said, rising up in the air. "Just concentrate on a fixed point in the air. Watch." that said, she sped towards one of the rings, looking right ahead of her, not daring to shift her glance.
The blonde let go of the other girl's breasts, moving her hands towards the girls red lacy underpants. She gave her a questioning look as to ask for permission. Ginny nodded for her to continue.
And Draco, who had called her a mudblood many times, could say that the feeling was mutual.
"Then let's do this!" Harry said, quite excitedly. He reached for Draco's hands and held them in his own. "I'm messed up, too. See, we complete each other."
Ginny didn't really care about the subject of their meeting, she was more interested in spending time with her friend.
After a bumpy ride in Rosemary Granger's old Panda Young- a ride that Draco and Ron found rather scary - they all arrived at the Granger household.
Once inside, they raced to Harry and Ron's dorm. Draco took a breath, then he opened the door.
The whole room fell into a loud applause.
"What's your name?" Adrian asked, completely clueless that Draco was trying not to associate him with a terrible person.
He chose not to waste his good times with his boyfriend and friends crying about his estranged parents.
His now boyfriend opened his eyes slowly and Draco squealed a little internally.
Hermione looked more annoyed than ever. "Get lost, Malfoy. That isn't your tree and besides we can all fit there!"
Molly Weasley, who was sitting next to him, was weeping lightly, although not as badly as when her first son got married. "I'm getting used to this wedding thing, three sons in less than two years!"
Lucius was a mean and calculating figure and he often imposed his own beliefs on his son,  If Draco dissented on something his father proposed, or even had a different idea than him, that was when the two personalities wouldn't match.
Draco couldn't help blushing as he heard this. Harry was really a sweet talker.
When wasn't he right? Draco wondered.
"So... you're ok with it?" The youngest of the Weasley children addressed, feeling hopeful.
Speaking with Ron or Hermione was pointless. They would not reason with him, no matter how hard he tried. They were firmly convinced of the theory that their whole story together had been fake and part of a cruel plan to 'get back at the chosen one'.
His boyfriend continued glaring at him.
Naturally, seeing Laura and Donald as they met their daughter's boyfriend, all laughs and smiles, was a tough blow on Draco.
"We were both wrong. But... know that I never thought that our love wasn't worth it, nor have I ever pretended to be in love with you for nefarious purposes." Draco let out in a broken voice.
"I-" she tried to say, but the Headmistress intervened. "Miss Weasley," she said sternly. "and Miss Parkinson, the price you will pay for your misconduct consists in the removal of 50 points each. Nevertheless, sending unauthorized material to the Daily Prophet is considered a felony, therefore you should both be expelled, but we will have the time to discuss the matter with your parents."
"Be careful, Weasley girl," Draco said. "If You don't want a bludger to hit you in the face."
Later that day, Draco found himself sitting under his precious tree, alone for once. Not that he loathed having someone to keep him company, but damn, it felt so good to be alone, sometimes. Just as he began to bask into this much needed 'me time' he heard footsteps coming his way. Ugh, why couldn't he just spend a few minutes undisturbed? He looked up to see who the loser was, only to see his crush staring back at him. "Hey." Potter said, looking a bit uneasy. Nevermind the me time, this would be so much better. "I'm not a broken hearts club, Potter, I'll have you know that. I see you're falling out a bit with Lady Weasley, eh?"
The next day, in the afternoon, Draco and Harry agreed to a meeting with Narcissa, in Hogsmeade.
"These are Draco and Harry." The girl said as she pulled away from her Grandma's grasp.
Ginny's hearing had been temporarily lessened, Hermione had told her that it would pass, but still, she'd had a mild panic attack.
It was basically an old decorative armour remodeled for the girl's physique. It covered her whole body except for her torso and Ginny thought it was perfect for their activity.
"Did you have a fight?" Luna asked bluntly.
Harry shook his head. "No, it's just.. Hermione found out about us... and she's giving me shit for it."
"What is he doing here?" he said. Everyone fell silent.
Draco and Luna weren't there; they were in their respective Common Rooms, preparing for the imminent detachment.
"Why can't I be lucky with room mates? He's almost worse than Blaise and Goyle, combined." Draco wailed, as he put his head on Harry's shoulder.
So he asked him.
She still managed to speak in her sweet voice when talking to Harry.
As Ron, Hermione and Draco made their way into the room, the latter noticed a broken frame sitting on the bedside table and some drops of dry blood were on it. The glass shreds were still scattered all over the floor.
Draco could barely believe it. They were husbands and they would be for the rest of their lives together. There was nothing that he looked forward to more. Simply growing old with the love of his life was something that he couldn't wait for.
"Well he's in the wrong." Harry shrugged. "Besides, he doesn't look so sad, does he?" He turned around to glance at the Slytherin table, where Draco was laughing wholeheartedly at something that disgusting piece of muck had said.
"Thank you guys, you're quite decent friends I reckon!" He said.
Ginny lay carefully down on her bed, letting her hair down sensually.
In the meantime, Ginny and Luna were at the Lovegoods, ready to engage in Easter fun.
Also, they had to go to France anyway, since the wedding would have taken place in Paris, only two weeks later.
"Hey Mione!" The two husbands said in unison, ignoring her reprimand.
"He's out of his mind!" Pansy stated. "You should tell McGonagall. Or Slughorn, at least."
"I know... I'm sorry..." he replied, looking down at his feet. The look the other boy gave him cut through him so violently that he had to look away, in order not to be burned by that look that he hated. He knew he deserved it, but it still hurt him to an extent.
A/N: Mrs Granger's name is not specified in the books, so I had to get creative.
Draco couldn't find the words, he was far too touched to do so. He was only able to say "Oh, Harry..."
"I know, I should have accepted this... Harry loves you. And I see that, every day at school... and I'm happy for you. Yes, and I will try to make life easier for the both of you." Ginny finished. She swallowed, anticipating their response. She was hoping they wouldn't kick her out of the room.
No one had ever made Draco's heart beat so fast, even just by looking into his eyes.
"If we don't get up we will fall asleep, fucking up our sleep patterns." Draco observed.
He definitely wasn't gay.
Luna gave a hearty laugh. "So romantic!" she murmured to Ginny.
"Are you talking to your hair? Oh, not again! We're late, babe, for goodness sake, hurry!" An annoyed voice said, along with a loud knock on the door.
"Oh don't worry, I'm used to this, I lived with muggles for ten years." said Harry with a polite smile, as he put down a fork.
"How long have you been holding this in ? You know damn well that I don't see eye to eye with the Slytherins!" his boyfriend said, in a rage, his jaw clenched
"Oh, alright... I'm just stressed. Ron has never met my parents." said Hermione, sighing.
"I'm sorry, Granger," Draco intervened. "What do you care if we spent the night together?"
Harry laughed, too. "In your dreams. Um, Draco Malfoy... My life became a thousand times better since you slithered into it." he started with his vows.
"Mum, I..." Ginny murmured.
"Move!" Ron instructed. "Go get him!"
"Because you know, Hermione! That's why... I mean, otherwise someone else would have said something, but no one is." Harry explained. It was true, no one in the Great Hall seemed to have seen it. They were all too busy munching on their food, anyway.

Slughorn nodded. He could never say no to Harry, anyway.
He broke the wand in two, emitting a sound 'crack'.
"Together with their families
The three of them hurried out of the office and rushed to the Gryffindor common room. It was on the tower, though, and they were in the dungeons. There was no time to lose.
Ron and the rest of Harry's roommates, together with Hermione, had spent the night in the Common Room, too drunk to reach their beds.
His wife summoned another armchair and proceeded to sit next to him, her legs crossed.
"Perce, your father and I got married when we weren't even twenty yet." his mother pointed out.
"Allo, can you tell me ze way to the last yearr dormitoires?" they boy asked in a seemingly french accent. Must have been from Beauxbatons.
"Donald! Rosemary! Come on downstairs! Food's ready!" Hermione's mum called out, ignoring the wishes.
The NEWTs hit the four graduates like a tidal wave. It was a week from hell.
"Aren't you a bit full of yourself?" Draco sneered.
Draco and Hermione looked at each other, awkwardly, as silence fell on them.
"Draco Malfoy, your mother and I are thoroughly disappointed in you.
"Then we decided to swim into this ocean, new to both of us, and I've come to the realization that we are all we need to be complete. I am the light, you are the darkness. You and I, together, are all that is most different, but also all that is most similar. With you is the only way that I feel like I'm Harry Potter. I love you, Draco, like never before. And I hate the fact that we have to hide. I'd shout it from the rooftops... " Harry said. He was smiling brightly and he felt tears threatening to invade his eyes. "I'm in love with DRACO MALFOY!" He finally shouted. He was now panting, hoping that Draco felt the same as he did.
When the exams were finally over, no one really knew if they had passed- well, except for Hermione- but still, they were immensely relieved that it was finally over.
She was shaking to an extent, although she tired to keep her smile.
Then, Harry took all of Draco's aching member into his mouth.
"You're awful, why did I even marry you?" Harry playfully said. He wrapped his arms around his lover's middle while saying so.
Ginny stopped her girlfriend from taking her wand. "Baby, it's fine, let's just go. He's not worth getting in trouble for."
Sometimes, the four of them would joke about being the 'best gays' that Hogwarts had ever seen.
He was surprised, though, that the Gryffindors, whom he had bullied relentlessly through the years, were more supportive than his own house mates.
As soon as Harry was done speaking, he noticed that Hermione was teary-eyed. Not that it was hard for her to become emotional, but he was glad that she'd reacted like that to his speech about how he felt for Draco.
After her parents left, Ginny ran to the Great Hall. She was determined to apologise to Harry and Draco. She had done something terrible to them. Sure, Harry had hurt her, but he didn't deserve this. She wondered if she had become a bad person. She wasn't positive that she would gain Harry's forgiveness, but she knew that her own forgiveness was far from being achieved.
"George and Angie here have taught me that if you love someone, why should you wait to always have them by your side?" Harry expressed.
However, Luna still noticed that her friend was a little too tense to only be worried about the NEWTs. She was constantly tapping her book with her quill, biting her lips and looking downright uneasy.
As Luna babbled, Ginny would find herself looking at her hair, her eyes and her moving lips. The entire ensemble was rather hypnotizing for her. She began to wonder what it would feel like to kiss those lips while running her fingers in her hair... No, that wasn't possible, Ginny was straight and still mourning the loss of a relationship with Harry.
"Look, I'm not in the mood." he warned him.
"Come on, it will be alright, darling." Narcissa reassured.
"You like me elegant." Harry shrugged.
Just as everyone was laughing at the face Ron was making, something strange happened.
If only he knew what a girl has done with his features, Draco thought.
"No, Luna... It was my fault, I was angry and hurt... but I shouldn't have done that. Or involve Parkinson into it." The redhead said.
"Aw they look so in love!" said Draco, smiling and taking Harry's hand into his.
"Well, I can't say that I didn't find your...action creepy. But I suppose, if it's a Beauxbatons tradition, that for you it was 100% innocent. But around here, it's not that ideal. And also, I have a boyfriend, so it's not so nice." Draco said. He didn't really mind the boy's presence on his bed, probably because in the last day he had not really spoken to anyone. Except for Pansy, on occasion. But she wasn't really present lately, she was... Elusive.
The pair froze. They slowly broke apart, then they turned around to face a shocked Pansy and a smirking Ginny.
"Mini Weasel... um... Ginny,"Draco mocked. "We certainly didn't start on the right foot, the two of us. Mostly because you were dating my man, but then we became close and formed this cute friendship that we now have. Thank you for telling the whole world about me and Harry, doing so you helped me overcome my insecurities and the fear of my father. But, mostly, thank you for being a little sister to me."
Pansy was growing more and more suspicious. The fact that Draco had not complained supported her theory that something was off with him more and more.
"Good luck!" Hermione said to the pair, then she hugged them both.
"Oh now I can see... Ginny, baby! Get the Quaffle!" She cheered for her girlfriend.
Ginny ignored the feeling of disgust at the mention of her brother and his girlfriend's search for a place to do their stuff in and focused on the fact that Hermione knew who the people occupying the room were. Could it be... "Luna, it was Harry! I'm sure of it! He was surely there with someone, the bastard!" She got up. "I might finally know who Harry cheated on me with! I need to go there... thank you Luna!" Ginny grabbed her friend's face and planted a kiss on her cheek, then she hurried out of the library.
Something felt fishy about it.
Draco stayed silent for a bit, hardly believing what had just happened.
They both felt their bodies being pervaded by a roaring fire, as their mouths collided.
"Follow me, Ronald!" an angered Hermione said to her clumsy boyfriend.
"Harry, I..." he said, teary eyed, when his boyfriend was beginning to sweat profusely.
"Are you planning to set him on fire?" Luna asked, putting on her gloves inside out.
"I'm here, see? It will all be alright." Harry lulled.
On August 28th, after weeks spent going to beaches and local pubs, it was time to take the train to Paris, where the wedding would have taken place on that same day.
Suddenly, an explosion of flavour invaded his mouth. His eyes fluttered back as he took in the delicious taste of this simple muggle food.
"Should I worry about them stealing my man?" he joked, but Draco couldn't hear him.
Luna, Ginny thought, looked like a veela. There was nothing that Ginny didn't like about her physique.
"Oh um... I was just looking for Ginny..." Harry said, but Hermione must have known that it was an obvious lie.
The brunette glared at him slightly, but she went on, "But then Harry fell in love with him and I was forced to spend more time with him... Doing so, I was able to see that no one in this world can make my best friend happier than Draco can!" When she finished, she wiped a stray tear from her eye and cheered for the couple.
He knew who 'Jean Jacques' was, now.
And, since all three of them were too tired to apparate, they thought it would be best to wait until the morning after.
His comeback brought the two of them back to their "hot discussion", as Hermione called it, from November.
The Slytherin was as nervous as can be. This was the first contact with his parents in four months. Sure, it would not be positive, but, at least, they remembered that they had a son.
Draco couldn't really say no to her tear filled face.
"Yes, this is from him, I'm sure. That was our owl." Draco explained.
Boy, was she right.
Their last year in Hogwarts had been good, quite calm, but it had felt too weird without their friends.
As Hermione was about to pronounce the words to a binding spell, a hand was placed on her mouth to prevent her from speaking.
She went on to talk about their under-the-mistletoe kiss.
Something like an hour later, it was finally their turn.
"Then put your pride aside and talk to him! Tonight, at Hogsmeade, before that giga Nargle brainwashes him!" Luna exclaimed, stomping her fork in her chicken.
It was like when the scandal had gotten out, all over again.
Harry was on top of Draco, his head rested on his chest, while the other boy softly caressed his head, playing with his unkempt hair.
Ginny caught her subtlety immediately. Their kiss had not been mentioned, until now.
Draco made a face that seemed angry, but he was hiding a smile. He wanted to play a little.
The commentator for that day was Miss Sivan, who, to everyone's surprise, was a big fan of Quidditch. She was perfect for the job, since she had been a Hufflepuff in her Hogwarts years, so she wouldn't have taken sides.
Everything made sense, now.
Lucius was a strict father, he was never up for jokes, or affection, but he loved his son deeply.
That afternoon, during the Quidditch practice, the team was beginning to question their captain's absence. Ginny, in particular.
She ran her hands through her hair as she grew more and more aroused.
It was a Reception room belonging to the hotel, its walls were white and there were around four marble columns, each of them had a least four balloons tied to it; one was golden, one was red and the last two were green and silver.
As Harry held his husband close, he could have sworn that had never known this level of delight in his life before.
Note to self, never accept a drink from the bloke. Draco thought.
The Gryffindor girl couldn't repress a laugh. "Oh, Luna, you're a funny one. It's impossible for you to be pregnant if you're having intercourse with a girl."
It was her own version of the red velvet, it had golden edible glitter on top and it spelled 'Happy 19th Ginevra' with hardened golden frosting.
Hermione couldn't wait to meet members from both teams, she was most excited about the beaters. Ron had been enchanted by the Keepers, even upon seeing that the Harpies one had not done her best.
Harry didn't seem so sure of what he was saying, but he told her that Ginny knew he loved her and that he didn't need to say it all the time. Hermione and Ron looked at each other for a bit but brushed it off right away, they just made their way to the tree.
"Well..."
He looked at the head seat opposite his, which was empty. "To our Fred, hoping he's spending a marvelous Christmas in Heaven if there is one, filled with fireworks and jokes. Fred, we miss you every day!" As he finished his speech, Arthur gave a sob. His wife hugged him from her seat, fighting her own tears. Everyone was sad, now. George fought the urge to leave the room, but his girlfriend grabbed him by his hand, giving him a comforting smile.
Arthur looked at his daughter, but he didn't say a word. He was far too aghast.
His body trembled as he let out hiccups of broken sobs.
"Jean Jacques?" the couple said in unison when they looked away from the devices in their hands, their jaws dropped and their eyes widened.
"Wait, so you knew about us?" The red haired girl gave her mother a quizzical look.
It was made of chiffon, it was long, down to the girls' feet and it had a sheer lace bodice.
"Ah, my gay dads!" The redhead squealed playfully.
The European Cup had contributed to making Draco's late birthday celebration almost as good as Ginny's, despite Adrian Martin.
"Yeah, but, do you think Draco would be willing to do that?" asked Ron.
The only person in the whole school who didn't seem to hate her was Luna. Too bad that she was a Ravenclaw.
"I'm joking, sweetie." said the Slytherin.
The two girls felt relieved.
He also wondered how this guy had been sorted into Slytherin already, even before setting foot in Hogwarts. There was probably a way to do it from a distance, he thought.
Some of them exchanged awkward looks, fearing the worst.
Harry looked in his eyes and apparently stopped breathing. He kept eyeing his lips and his heart was racing. They looked as though they were about to kiss. But it wasn't what Draco had in mind, since he pushed the shorter boy to the ground.
And he was his.
Her thoughts wandered back to her fantasies about the girl. They were finally coming to life.
Ron was momentarily at a loss for words, it still felt weird that Malfoy could ever say such a thing.
She was holding a pot of roast lamb.
Ron joined in on Hermione and Harry's hug.
"I saw that you did not respond to my letter. Therefore, I came here to fetch you myself." Lucius said in a cold tone.
"Those little discussions that are somewhat... hot."
"We are together." Seamus added.
What did he have now that was worth living for?
But she wasn't enough for it to be alright.
At the Slytherin table Draco was smiling his brightest smile. "Ah, Blaise, don't you think today is a wonderful day?"
Both girls had their breasts exposed to the other, feeling mesmerized at the artsy view.
"I am sure that I am going to cry." said Luna. "I always cry at weddings. But in this one I will cry more because I will imagine my girlfriend as the bride and me as the groom but as another bride." she smiled as she shrugged her shoulders.
"Yes, this is our tree." said Draco, when Ginny turned around to face him.
Back to the Grangers' house, the meal had come to an end.
Draco slithered into bed, too, feeling a bit tense.
Behind them were Draco and his mother, also linking arms.
They were the most eye-catching players, their moves were impeccable and reminded Draco of dancers.
Two months later, at the beginning of March, the relationship between the two girls was still a secret, as they weren't ready to be out just yet.
"Yeah, it's the wedding thing. No more name basis." Harry chuckled.
They ended up making love into the tub. That was what they both needed to end that exhausting and stressful day.
Ginny was determined to win, as she was hoping to see her favourite team ever, the Hollyhead Harpies, compete against the Quiberon Quafflepunchers.
His body turned into a female one, revealing the true nature of this mysterious foreigner.
Draco suspected something was up.
The floo powder was not at option, as the snow had fallen inside of the chimney, thus blocking it.
Poor Ginny, she was right... He had never been attracted to her. And he may have known why... he was actually gay. Made sense.
******
"Mmm." Harry said, smiling into the kiss. "I'm a natural, I reckon."
"You are too sweet, Weasley!" Draco exclaimed, flashing him a grin.
Neville was left unscathed, though.
They were his idyllic idea of parents, he was sure of it.
"Wow, lesbiennes? They turn me on ever more." Adrian giggled softly, as he put a hand on Luna's cheek to caress it.
Not a minute after they had entered the room, Malfoy was already pushing Harry on the king size bed that the Room of Requirement had produced. The Slytherin straddled him, then he kissed him. This kiss felt even more incredible than their previous ones, if that were possible.
"Oh, I have yours, too." Draco said, then he summoned a package. It was quite big, but harry couldn't make out what it looked like.
"Do you think it's worth it?" the French asked.
"Say it and this torture will stop!" Said Harry, a smirk on his face.
Bill, Fleur, Xenophilius, George and Angelina had to leave, too, so that the only people left at the Burrow were Mr and Mrs Weasley, Ron, Harry, Draco, Ginny and Luna.
"Where did Santa go? He's so good with special effects." She chanted.
"Guys... you need to see this." said Hermione. She was holding the new edition of the Daily Prophet in her hand. She showed it to the both of them and they saw that the picture of their kiss was on the front page.
"Accio lube." he panted. When the bottle flew straight in his hands, he opened the lid and poured the lubricant onto a finger and began to thrust it into Draco's entrance.
"And congratulations guys! Even if you're copycats!" He concluded, playfully.
"Don't worry, I don't think anyone noticed." Harry said and a second later a magic air kiss settled on his lips. Ron and Hermione noticed right away. Harry gave a surprised giggle, while his two best friends were looking at each other. "I mean, we did notice." Hermione observed.
All of his friends plus boyfriend looked at each other.
"I love you my sweet boy." She breathed.
At first glance, this famous Italian delicacy looked like a vinyl record, as it was flat and round.
The girl was very proud of her flying abilities and she wasn't afraid to show it.
He felt sick to his stomach as he imagined Draco sitting down with Jean Jacques to discuss said plan.
"He's doing it!" Hermione gasped, tugging at Ron's suit.
"She has our outfits prepared, Mum will send them in as soon as possible." Ginny continued.
Harry lifted his head, after pulling away, then he pulled down his own pants and underwear.
"Go, aunt Ginny!" said Draco, taking Hugo's hands into his and moving them up and down.
"Why should I? This disgusting excuse of a human being has completely fooled my best friend! He hasn't changed, Hermione! He shouldn't have been trusted!" Ron growled.
This was because they were perfect for each other, their complicity was made possible by their differences, which accentuated their similarities, thus making them two halves of a heart.
This is how things are, then. Draco thought. The same person who had called him the love of life had just told him to get fucked by someone else. And for something so stupid. He wondered if their love was really as strong as he thought it to be.
She found it so unfair that she had been the fool this whole time, crying over Harry while he was screwing around with Malfoy. To think that in two years Harry had never touched her below the waist... and now there he was, giggling about his sexual encounters with Malfoy.
Draco was starting to think that there was a sneak in Hogwarts. It was probably Blaise.
Keeping secrets wasn't Luna's favourite thing to do, as it never came easy to her.
"I'd say that wins Quidditch over by far." He muttered, then pressed his forehead to Harry's.
There were a clicking sound and a flash, but the boys didn't seem to notice.
Suddenly, a smile was painted on the brunette's lips. "This calms me down a little." she said.
"Oh, Bonjour! The Saviour." said Jean Jacques, bending down in what looked like a mocking bow.
Hermione and Ron gave a 'woo' at the sight of that PDA, Draco was not afraid to show his love for Harry anymore. Hermione put her hands on her chest, feeling proud.
"Yep." Harry said.
"Oh Merlin, I can't believe I'm about to talk to Gwen!" Ginny squeaked, all while holding her girlfriend's hand. "This is a dream come true!"
"Well, I hope you like this cake, Gin." said Hermione, trying to suppress a smirk. "You are going to cut it from here." she pointed to the first "P" from the writing.
"You're crying already!" Draco whispered loudly, a smile on his face.
Luna screamed and laughed for the whole duration of it.
That had just become the best day of her life, hands down.
Pansy was visibly upset, it was obvious that she hadn't gotten over what she had seen just yet.
Just as she had predicted, the flames roared and a face appeared in the form of fire.
Professor McGonagall had had enough of the ruckus that was now taking place in the room, so she yelled "Finite Incantatem!" and ordered for everyone to keep quiet.
He shook his head while chuckling softly.
Hermione gave her a look at the word 'baby'.
He felt so stupid for fighting with him. All he wanted to do was run in his arms and kiss him fiercely.
It was the fact that she had sworn secrecy on Hermione's condition.
To be fine, Draco had to treat them as if they were dead. It would take a while as it would be a grieving process, but, in the end, he would have gotten over it.
He had never said I love you to anyone in his life before.
"You mean, like my heart?" Harry asked, timidly.
The Weasley boy looked quite nervous. Harry could relate to his state, not long before he had felt that way. When proposing to Draco, to be exact.
"I was suspecting it, yes." Draco confirmed with a smirk. "I'm sure I was able to visit you in your dreams that night." He teased.
After all, his grandma was all he had, he would have done anything to keep her safe.
He had always been an icon in his Hogwarts years, but he was never too grateful for it, as people's expectations of him were high.
"Babe, are you alright?" Ron shouted, but his girlfriend wouldn't give him an answer.
Harry's gloom was so much that he was able to make it rain on himself temporarily.
In fact, only a few days later, he had something planned out.
"What the fuck do you want?" Harry shouted, angrily, taking his wand out, ready to fight him.
Her body didn't obey her voice in her head saying 'push her away!', though. She just relaxed into the kiss. When Luna pulled away, she gasped.
Draco looked at him with a puzzled expression. "What are you talking about? Harry, I swear to you, he kissed me, I didn't want him to! I love you, I didn't cheat on you, I would never!"
"Directly from Hogwarts, the saviour of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter, seems to be in love with ex death eater, Draco Malfoy." Hermione began reading the snippet. "Could this be dark magic?"
"On our left we have ze Hollyheard Harpies!" the head of the Magical games shouted, pointing his hand at the Welsh team.
"Oh, morning, sweetie." Laura greeted her daughter with a smile. "You're just in time for lunch. Gather your friends here, will you?"
When the girls went back under the tree, they had all reassured him that Hermione had suffered a panic attack for the excessive stress she was in and she had been sick as a consequence.
That afternoon, in the Gryffindor common room, Ginny was sitting by herself, scribbling on a piece of parchment.
"We spent two weeks apart." Draco giggled softly.
"No, Ron, I don't need distractions... I have to study... And you should too. Tell you what, you go to the library to save our seats, I'll  meet you there in a bit, ok? Then we can finish the Potions assignment before our class starts."
"So you're telling me he's gay? It would make sense... I mean we never did anything uh... special... in almost two years of dating...But... who?" Ginny stopped to think. Who could have stolen her man? Maybe Neville? "Might it be... Neville? Oh, Luna, we need to get to the bottom of this." Ginny said. She swore to herself that she would find out who had corrupted Harry's mind into breaking up with her, but there were so many guys in Hogwarts... she just didn't have a clue as to who that might have been.
Not much later, someone unwelcome walked in.
"I know, Mione," said a smiling Harry. "It's just, I can't really help it... It's hard for me to hide how crazy I am for him." He finished, blushing a little.
As the last remaining weeks of Hogwarts life passed, Hermione's secret was kept safe among her friends. Ron had no idea about it and resigned from looking more into his girlfriend's strange behaviour- he simply blamed it on school matters- or, at least, so it seemed.
"Ok, fine." Draco said.
Draco stood there, awkwardly. He watched as the woman planted a kiss on Harry's head, they looked so cute it made him a little sad. He wonder if he would ever be this adorable with his mother again.
"Yeah, keep dreaming." said Harry, teasingly. Then he flew closer to him.
"It was a pleasure, by the way." Ron added.
The redhead sighed softly. Her girlfriend's act had actually made her feel all warm and fuzzy inside. She felt protected by her.
Luna was wearing them wrong, so she saw the players even farther than they were. "Wow, why are they so far from us?" She asked naively.
When they pulled away, they were smiling broadly.
During meals she would sadly look at the people that had once thought very highly of her. They were laughing with each other, living perfectly fine without her. She wondered if maybe it would have been better to be expelled. At least, she wouldn't have to see them every day.
"Yes." Ginny answered.
"Thanks, Gin." Said Hermione. She then removed her hands from Ginny's hold and flashed her a bright smile.
"Ginny is the one who worries me." said Harry, shifting a bit into his seat.
Lucius gasped. "This is disrespecting your own blood! You should be ashamed of yourself. Think of mother... she almost fainted upon reading this article!"
When Luna finished speaking, both girls were in tears. "I love you too!" Ginny said, then she took her girlfriend's face and pressed their lips together.
Down in Beauxbatons we do it all the time. It's not sexual harassment there." Jean Jacques said, sitting on Draco's bed, uninvited.
On top of the table lay two scarlet and gold plates, suggesting Gryffindor. At the center of the piece of furniture stood a large bottle of butterbeer , whose label said 'for the happy couple, Draco and Harry'. Both glasses had the Hogwarts crest printed on them. Next to the bottle were two lit candles, both vanilla scented, which were white with golden finishings.
Draco hesitated at first, but then he took his hand. Both of them stumbled for the lack of balance, but they were able to get on the lake, eventually.
"That's what I thought. She's simply a magical skank." Draco said, shrugging his shoulders.
"When will you ever listen to me?" Harry said sternly, turning around to finally face his lover. "Lucky I was suspicious, think of what they could have done to you if I hadn't been!"
Ginny wondered if she would ever marry the girl in her arms.
In that moment, everyone thought that Lucius Malfoy would have used his old slur on her, but he didn't argue with her. He turned to his son, instead.
Luna held her breath as she leaned in, then, as their lips crashed together, she heard fireworks in her head.
But Draco couldn't understand. That castle didn't have the same sentimental value for him as it did for Harry.
It was Ron's turn to talk to Draco now and he didn't seem too happy about it. "Look, Malfoy, don't you dare play one of your tricks on Harry, ok?" he warned. "Or you will see."
Thankfully, the pair didn't seem to be bothered by him.
He had to look at him to marry him.
"Happy Birthday, Gin!" Harry managed to say through his friend's tight grip.
"Wow, Draco's parents really love crashing celebrations, don't they?" Ron observed, shaking his head, showing a half a smile on his face.
This year, Harry was going to celebrate it in an unusual way- first thing being with his boyfriend, secondly, he was going to spend it in Hermione's house.
However, Luna didn't seem to mind that her House was in fourth place.
"I'll go." Ron offered. He then got up and went straight to his room. He came back right away holding a piece of parchment, that he handed to Harry.
When I saw the disgustingly cute couple out and about in Hogsmeade, wearing each other's scarf, I thought it was just the right time. In a fervent jealousy, I approached you and I pulled my most regretful face - the crying bit was the easiest. I also made myself a tad bit goofy and cute - I knew Draco wouldn't have been able to resist me. So, after he forgave me, I had to come up with a plan to destroy the happy couple. My initial idea was to brew a love potion, but I couldn't get my hands on one, no matter how hard I tried. So, I moved on to plan B, brewing the polyjuice potion to become Potter. But, on New Year's Eve, in a muggle hair salon, a better opportunity presented itself.
"I'll start!" Ron intervened, raising his hand in the air. "Well, Gin, you're my sister and I know we haven't always got along - we often fought and had our fair share of disputes, some of them even lasted long. But they were usually due to my protectiveness towards you. Ginny, I love you so much and I will forever be thankful to Mum and Dad for giving me a sister like you exactly nineteen years ago!"
The food they ate was a little different than what the elves usually offered, it was burgers. In all his 18 years of life Draco had never had a burger before, it sounded too muggle-like for him.
"Is it true your father kicked you out?" the newbie asked.
"Well, now, we really need to get going." Harry said, as he sat up. "You coming?" He extended his hand for Draco to hold.
"Harry I promise to love you and cherish you till the day I die. I'm positive that you will do the same. If you won't I might murder you." Draco finished.
"You're joking, right? What were you thinking, inviting Malfoy's son to our house?"
Her husband was sitting close to her, on his beloved armchair.
"Oh, impossible, Pansy cannot use magic, not anymore. That must be the original Jean Jacques. He's the guy that she cloned." Hermione added in her clever tone.
"I love you more than anything!" Ginny gave her girlfriend yet another kiss.
Concentrating wasn't Luna's most important skill. She was terrible at it, most of the times.
"Ginevra, this is not how I raised you. I was also shocked at the news of Harry and Malfoy - believe me, it is hard to accept, also because I didn't know about your breakup, but that is no way an excuse to attempt at ruining his life like this. Do you even know what that could do to a person?" Molly reprimanded her daughter. She was very, very disappointed in her,
"Like hell I'll move on", Ginny thought. I'll teach you to mess with Ginny Weasley.
Hermione picked it up and carefully tore the envelope open, five pairs of curious eyes watching over her. She pulled out an embellished piece of parchment and began examining its content.
"Guys!" Harry shouted, running towards his friends. They were both sitting on the sofa next to the fireplace and they were all cuddled up to each other.
The had upcoming exams, too, but theirs were simple, routine ones, so they thought it wouldn't hurt them to lighten the load a little.
In those past days, Harry had told them about their fight in detail.
"Babe, are you sure that this is only due to the NEWTs stress?" A worried Ron asked.
So, shortly before dinner, he found himself knocking on the door of her office.
How had he lived his entire life without trying it? There was nothing that tasted better, he was sure of it.
He grabbed him by his robe and pushed him to a wall. Before Draco knew it, the redhead had punched his face hard enough to make him fall.
The pain was unbearable. That's what you get for trusting Draco bleeding Malfoy so quickly, Harry thought to himself as he lay in his bed.
They were sitting in three different arm chairs, one per couple, all located in front of the fire place. On the floor, next to the chairs, was a six pack of butterbeers, courtesy of Seamus.
"Harry, wait!" he shouted, but the Gryffindor would not stop for him. "Harry, please!"
All the boys were wearing tuxedos.
Also, he thought that not forgiving Pansy would be silly on his part, given that he had done things that were significantly worse than putting a picture on a banner.
"Careful, Draco," Ron warned. "Our Harry here is serious."
"Well, he needs to mind his business." said Draco, impatient, as they entered the Great Hall.
"No, not that..." said Harry, gulping.
The good in his heart was expanding, clearly.
"The Weasleys? Oh, but... you know that they don't exactly love me..." Draco answered.
The place looked very similar to the Leaky Cauldron, however, it didn't have that same vibe.
After all, she was his mother, not some bratty girl.
Harry, too, was triggered by his presence.
The morning after, at breakfast, Luna tried to avoid looking Ron in the eyes.
He had forgotten how good it felt to see them staring back at him. He had missed them.
Harry let out an involuntary gasp when he did that.
He didn't know how long he had been there when he heard someone come into the room. He suddenly opened his eyes and sat up, trying to cover his privates with his hands.
It was obvious that they represented Gryffindor and Slytherin merging together.
It was Bill , the oldest of the Weasley children, who opened the door. "Hey family!" he exclaimed, with open arms.
Neville would report his every move to them.
So, Lucius really did come to Hogwarts to talk to Draco. The boy was hoping that this fear of him visiting him would not come true. But now, his father was there, for him. He felt like he could faint at any minute. "Oh, no." He murmured. He was shaking and breathing irregularly.
They were both sitting in one of the leather sofas of the Slytherin common room, discussing Draco's misadventure of the night before.
If Harry had found out about it, he would have challenged Jean Jacques to a duel - if not worse.
She winked.
Took him long enough. Ah, his day just kept getting better and better. He wanted to smirk, but decided to play along a little. "Oh come on Potter, did you really think I'd kiss you?" He gave him his best impression of a disgusted face and walked closer to him. He now felt his rival's shaky breath on his face and he loved just the effect he had produced.
"Harry, Draco!" said a puffing Hermione, she had just arrived there after an extenuating race up the moving stairs. Ron was there with her, too.
Not much later, the bridesmaids and the groomsmen made their entrance. Ginny and Luna walked inside, happily greeting the guests with one hand, the other one holding a small bouquet.
She wrapped her arms around her thighs, so that her face was as close to her vulva as possible.
"I'm so glad you're sleeping here tonight, it's been a long week!" Harry purred into Draco's ear.
Miss Adrastea Sivan was a young woman, possibly in her thirties. Her teal blue hair fell in a cascade of curls on her shoulders and, as it moved, it scattered glitter everywhere. Many speculated that she was some kind of a veela, but it was never confirmed. She was very fond of long, white cloaks, which gave Harry the idea that she was always ready for her own wedding.
Draco wondered if it could be possible to love that boy more than he did in that moment.
That afternoon, at lunch time, the new couple decided to use their meeting place for something different: a date.
He had chosen an emerald embezzled ring for a particular reason; he wanted Draco to be reminded of his eyes every time he took a glance at it.
She wanted to look like the submissive wife everyone thought her to be.
"So, when I met you I never would have dreamed to be in a relationship with you. I felt a strong sense of dislike for you, but then as time went on I realized that what I felt for you was a strong attraction that I tried to conceal with hate.
"Pansy, why?" he asked her, apathetic. "This is why you were never in the same place at the same time as Jean Jacques and why he suddenly disappeared! That's why you were so elusive... what a fool I was, thinking that you were having some sort of trouble! That's why he'd wake up at 5am! And why a flask would never leave his side. It was the polyjuice potion, not a sickness remedy. "
While Harry and Draco were out with Draco's mum, the remaining four of the group were under their favourite tree, preparing themselves for the impending exams.
Then, they both started singing a tune that lacked rhyme. It went like this, "Nargle eggs, nargle eggs! Come to us! So we can fry you!"
"You are a bit horrible..." Draco joked.
"Oh, we will never study under the big tree again!" Draco intervened, joining the group hug.
"Not really! I think I'll be sick!" said Ron, trying to breathe evenly.
"Father, I..." Draco began, his voice trembling.
It was Ginny's birthday, so Hermione had offered her spacious flat that she shared with her husband and son to host the party.
She was curious to see what these 'nargle eggs' actually were.
Harry organized his initial thrusts into Draco's body in a slow pace, which he later accelerated on his boyfriend's desperate requests.
"The first thing I needed to do was to get back into Draco's grace.
Harry and Draco didn't focus on the parchment, though. As soon as their teacher closed the door, Harry launched himself at his boyfriend, wrapping him into a tight hug. "I've been waiting all day for this!" He said in an excited tone.
Now Ron was more confused than ever. "Guys-" he tried to say, but the other two kept interrupting him. "If you're not fine with it, then it's your problem! You're too busy criticizing and judging that you don't see that people do change!"
Their first kiss had not been romantic; on the contrary it had been something done out of teasing.
"Enough! I don't want anyone else. I made friends with him because I missed you! And I should have been more honest with you, told you I needed more..."
"Pansy," Draco said, reaching for his friend. "What have I ever done to you?"
"By the power invested in me by the Ministry Of Magic, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations!" The teacher squealed as the newly weds pressed their lips together.
While on the train platform, Ron revealed how he had received knowledge of his girlfriend's pregnancy.
It was a great opportunity for the girls to come out as a couple to him.
Hermione gasped. "Well, at least I don't just throw on the first thing that comes to hand!"
Ron, having broken his kiss with his girlfriend, suddenly seemed to remember something.
Ginny and Luna shared a look, knowing exactly what had just gone down in the bedroom.
The girl did, laughing. Then, she held Luna close as they watched the marvelous pyrotechnics.
"Everything is better with your touch." He breathed.
"Hi, you're stunning." Ron managed to say, trying to contain a sob.
"Time's up!" Xenophilius yelled, running towards the girls.
As time passed, they two of them found themselves in a relationship together.
"Babe." Draco said in a croaked voice, still stroking the other boy's hair.
She was the only one in the room from Draco's side.
"I told you, it's nothing." Hermione repeated. Her nostrils were beginning to flare. Talking to her in this state was like trying to cuddle with a hungry lion.
"Ha, ha... so funny, Malfoy!" said Hermione, annoyed. She then reached down to help Harry up. "Come on, boys," she said to both Harry and Ron. "Let's go somewhere else, it isn't worth it."
"What do you mean, a thing?" The Weasley girl stuttered.
He gasped at the sight of Draco. He was standing with the frame in his hands and he had a fading black eye. He suddenly felt a strong sense of worry inside of him. How had he hurt himself like that?
"So, Ginny, I don't know if you do this too in your home, but Luna and I have a special tradition for this day! It's hunting nargle eggs!" Xenophilius said excitedly.
It wasn't a coincidence that the partygoers were reminded of her behaviour in class.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him. "Why must you always be so insensitive, Ronald? We have so many memories here!" She scolded.
As the three last ones entered the marquee they admired the view of the whole room.
Ron's eyes widened in worry. "What if she has a virus? If so, I caught it, too!" he groaned.
But they made it through this trial as well.
"Mmm." Narcissa said, thoughtfully. "Harry should be a legilimens, he really is good at reading through people."
"Want a duel, Potter? Make it a duel." Jean Jacques hissed. He, too, took his wand out and disarmed Harry.
"I know, but our rivalry is what brings us together! When I look at you, I see myself. All this repressed anger... I've been through that. Feeling like you don't belong... but with you it's different. With you I belong." Harry interrupted him. There wasn't much Draco could say to this. It was beautiful. Maybe he was right, he could have just dived in this new thing, for all that mattered. But he was Draco Malfoy, after all. He couldn't just fall in love... or could he?
"I missed you too, my sweet son. You'll see, your father will understand too, one day. You just have to give him time." Narcissa said in a delicate tone, showing Draco a comforting smile.
Ron turned around and looked a him with widened eyes, as he could scarcely believe what he'd just heard.
Draco gasped at the realisation.
"Oh no, I wanted to talk about something else." Ron turned to face his sister. "You will have the chance to make amends with Harry and Malfoy, since he's spending Christmas with us."
He definitely did not feel bad, not in the least.
Hermione was the next one to speak. "Ginny, my partner in crime for our pranks on your bro here and my favourite sister-in-law, you are truly a blessing to this world. I love you so, so much and I hope the best for you in your life to come! I know you will do great things. I'm so lucky to have you by my side."
"Malfoy, can you believe it, Luna!" Ginny said to her friend, that same day. They were walking to Herbology, that they both had in common. "From what I know, they're pretending to hate each other still. I don't understand how he can just... be with him, you know?"
With trembling hands, she unhooked Luna's bra and threw it to the ground.
He shuddered as Malfoy continued talking. "Well, what can I say? I hate you, Potter, I really do... But damn me, and much as I hate myself for this... I can't stop thinking of fucking your brains out." Draco said in a raspy voice. His eyes were darkening by the second and that was too much for Harry to handle. "Draco... Screw you." He said as he attacked his lips with his own. The kiss felt exactly like it did in his dream. It was all kinds of good. Maybe it was a bit more raw than what he had imagined, but still. Draco was now tugging at his tie, making the kiss even hotter, if that was even possible.
She put her own piece on a small, red plate, then she served it to everyone else in the room.
Harry and Draco couldn't help laughing hysterically at their friends' craziness.
He saw that the other boy had his arms wrapped around him, which made him smile. Oh Potter, what have you done to me? You turned me into an emotional sap, he thought.
"Babe, are you ok?" Harry asked, since his boyfriend looked like he was about to pass out.
Harry pulled away and looked into his eyes. "My love?" He repeated.
"But the place will be packed with photographers. After all, it's the Chosen One's wedding." His mother chirped.
The arena was significantly smaller than the one they had seen in the World Cup, but it still looked colossal.
Then, they kissed in mid air. The Crowd cheered louder, except some Slytherins, who booed.
Draco felt the tension in the air, it wrapped them both so tight, almost choking them.
He would have continued his beating if it hadn't been for Hermione, who intervened.
He was incredibly afraid of what he would say, he dreaded that he would have come to Hogwarts himself, ready to disown him.
"You're just so unbelievably cute, all angry and unexperienced." Harry said, wrapping his arms around his lover.
"Next year you'll understand!" Said Harry.
"Pansy! You need to say 'Imprimo' while pointing at the camera!" Ginny screamed through her captors' arms.
As he did, the bird flew away, without even greeting him.
Charlie only sent letters from Romania as he was too busy with dragons and such.
After the edible parts of the cake disappeared completely, Ginny had to open her presents.
That was his way of getting out of a scolding. It had never failed so far.
Ron looked like he had tears in his eyes. "Ginny," he said, putting his hand on his sister's shoulder, after Hermione had pulled away.
Where was Pansy when he needed her?
"Thanks, you look cute too." Ginny said, blushing.
"Oh I know." He simply said, grinning. "But what about my mum? What if she doesn't show up?"
"Nothing." His girlfriend said in a stern voice, not daring to meet his gaze.
"No, I'm just... Happy.. seems like Potter's having trouble in paradise...and I do enjoy seeing that baboon suffer!"
That night Harry went to the Room of Requirement as he'd done those past nights. As soon as he and Malfoy entered the room, the blonde boy was already trying to remove his clothes. Harry stopped him. "Wait, I don't know if I feel like it tonight." He said, looking down. Draco looked at him with widened eyes. "Don't tell me you're still thinking of Weasley?"
Draco looked a bit scared, so Ron couldn't keep a straight face. " Come here, you twat!" He said, wrapping his arms around him.
After taking a deep breath, she tried to make swirls in the blue, but they didn't come out as beautiful as her girl's.
Draco was unable to move, or to process anything at the moment. He was standing in the middle of Hogsmeade, no coat on. He was cold, but he didn't mind it.
Molly glared at her son, putting her arms on her waist. "When will you learn?" But it was clear that she wasn't really scolding him, as her smile betrayed her.
"I love you too, Ronald!" said Harry, sending his best friend a non-magical air kiss.
In the end, the Quafflepunchers beat the Harpies by two hundred points, as Jean Jacques' doppelganger caught the snitch.
And Jean Jaques, he was going to pay. Not just yet, though. Revenge was a dish best served cold.
A few days later, back in Hogwarts, Luna and Hermione threw Harry and Draco an engagement party, which they hosted in the Room of Requirement, inviting students from all houses.
The girl stood there, her mouth dropped. Several people stared at her in disbelief.
"You think you're so noble, but you're mentally poor. You only care about appearances, but the truth is you're simply a coward." Draco spat.
It was their building familiarity that did the trick. They became used to each other's bodies and minds, so much to form a connection unlike any.
It was a warm evening in the middle of August. Harry was in his bathroom, getting ready to go out.
"Oh, Potter!" she said as she raised her eyes to see who the guest was. "Congratulations, you restored your legacy in my subject." she smiled broadly.
"Oh...Luna... no I mean... you like me?" Ginny asked, embarrassed.
He had to admit that she was even better than himself.
"I missed you, too." Draco moaned, throwing his head back.
"Oh, good morning." Narcissa said with a smile.
The silence was eventually broken by Harry's voice."What the fuck do they want?"
"Harry..." Ron began. "People wouldn't understand... homosexuality is treated very cruelly in the Wizarding World. Especially by purebloods. Think of how the Slytherins would react."
Draco had to face him that night, though. He would spend it with him, but he would sleep in Harry's dorm for the weekend. Sleeping at the Gryffindors' every night would have been too risky. Draco's change of rooms had already been an exception.
"No! That's..."
"I'm on my way to save him." Said Hermione, then she disappeared out of sight.
Draco nodded.
Blaise spat in his face.
To Harry, it was the same amount of nervousness that he had felt on his very first Quidditch match. Just without the thrill.
After exchanging their rings, Ron kissed Hermione and Harry captured his now husband's lips with his own.
Ron sighed. Indeed, the boy looked determined, there was no denying in that.
"And now," Draco continued. "I'm here, in a place that belongs to muggleborns. Where were you, father? You told me yourself, 'do not come home or we will kill you'."
Everyone cheered and applauded loudly, even George and Angelina, who weren't mad that Harry had taken some of the attention away from them.
The truth was that Harry was undeniably stressed because of the NEWTs and everything else and Draco knew just what he had to do to calm his nerves.
Draco simply chuckled. "Don't worry, I know."
"We are gathered here for yet another wedding - wow, I must say, this is turning into a trend." the woman joked, earing a laugh from many guests. " On the left here we have Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, while on our right we can admire Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger."
"She looked like she was about to throw up." Ginny remarked.
There sat his boyfriend and his friends.
The black haired boy took a deep breath. Talking about this very personal issue with an almost stranger wouldn't be too easy.
Hermione helped him up, while Ron awkwardly helped Draco.
Her cheeks were both red, she was wearing a large hat that covered her eyebrows and her Slytherin scarf kept going left and right.
*****
"Mione?" the girl called upon knocking on the sliding door. "Are you sick?"
"It's nothing, I told you. I don't feel like spoiling our first night in the muggle world. "
Harry knew that she wasn't exactly genuine, given her abilities to lie to powerful legilimens, but he chose not to interfere with his lover's happiness.
This was different than their first kiss, this one was filled with want, encircled in a ring of exploding fire.
Her friendly hand on his shoulder failed to make him feel better because he knew that, deep inside, Pansy wasn't really sorry for him. After all, she had been in love with him ever since he could remember. If anything, she would think this was the 'green light' to be with him.
Soon came time for cake and everyone moved to the kitchen, bringing their stereo with them. With a flick of his wand, Ron switched the music to "Happy Birthday".
"He did it on purpose, as he knew I liked him." said Harry, looking at his boyfriend.
There was a fight over one of the eggs, as both girls ran towards it at the same time.
There must have been a wild hen roaming around the garden, who had possibly escaped from a farm.
He wondered if she had been hiding something.
When they landed back on the ground, Ginny planted a kiss on the other girl's lips.
"Because I am in love with you, Draco! Can't you see? I have always loved you, given you everything, while that goody goody Potter screwed you once and got you under his spell!" Pansy shouted. "I thought I had to make you both pay. I figured, if I had transformed into a boy, I could have seduced you, thus separating you two. And I had made it!"
With no further hesitation she began eating Ginny out.
"Right back at you." Draco intervened in a playful tone.
She was already seated, waiting for them.
"Sorreh to say zis, but I think he's not doing enough for you." the French guy said.
Harry was happy to comply. He slammed himself into him, earning a scream of pleasure. He moved, slowly at first, then he quickened his pace. "Oh f-fuck, yes!"This is what heaven must feel like, Harry thought. It felt better than anything he had ever done in his life. This is what the fuss was all about. As shocks of pleasure pervaded his body, he thought that there was no place he'd rather be. He was perfectly fine inside of his arch enemy.
"I do, more than anything." Harry said in a croaked voice.
Harry must have noticed the boy's puzzled expression at the sight of it, given he chuckled softly. "Oh, don't look at it like that- I can assure you, it's really good. I asked the elves to make us this special muggle delicacy- and a cheap one, too- so that our first date could have a bit of my old traditions, hoping to deliver a new one for you... and to introduce you to Muggle food, really." he added, smiling. Draco gave him half a smile, he wasn't too convinced, but changed his mind the moment he bit into his burger. Harry enjoyed looking at his boyfriend digging into his food, emitting some moans of pleasure. "This is afmafing!" Draco said in a muffled tone and it reminded Harry of Ron whenever food was put in front of him. The messy haired boy grinned. "Told you you'd like it."
The three girls apparated, Luna screaming of joy.
"Ah..." Harry managed to say. Malfoy was now removing his jeans, just as slowly as he had done with the shirt. Then it was time to remove his boxers.
When Harry sat, his friends noticed that he was trembling.
As the girls' gazes met, Ginny began thinking.
"So, instead of talking to us about him into making our ears bleed," Luna began, "Why don't you just talk to him?"
"Well, he could come there, for once!" the French guy argued.
Hermione's parents, Laura and Donald, had invited all her friends over, mostly as a Thank You to the Weasleys for having given their daughter a place to stay on so many occasions.
"Fine." Luna eventually said, surrendering. "But only because I love you."
"I doubt it'll be possible..." said Draco.
Luna had made a miniature mistletoe for Ginny, while Ginny had bought her a pair of shoes. "So the nargles won't leave you barefoot." She said to her.
It was made like the muggles would do, a recipe of Rosemary Granger.
"Well, when did that happen?" Harry asked.
"You're right! I will miss Hogwarts!" he lamented, his eyes beginning to water.
Hugo definitely liked Luna more than Ginny, he loved playing with her butterbeer necklace.
"Hey, don't you dare! Leave him alone!" Harry shouted, coming to Draco's rescue.
As Harry made his way to the Room of Requirement, he was more than certain that he would have refused to have a go at Malfoy's sexual games. "Ah, here you are, Potter!" His rival greeted him with a smile as he approached him.
Everyone froze as they heard her speak.
"So, since we're here I propose a toast to the happy couple!" He said, when everyone fell silent, raising his drink in the air.
She was a very jealous girlfriend, she had let her hug Gwenog Jones only because she knew she had been wanting to for ages, but this guy was crossing a line.
"Oh, no, you'll fall from the sky, like this. Here," the redhead corrected, placing her own hands on the other girl's and moving Luna's in the right fashion.
Six plates were set, they were also pink, with golden borders.
The woman sat up to touch Draco's face. "Oh, my dear, naive son. Did you really think that I'd be fine with you marrying a man? In a muggle ceremony?" She shook her head, while clicking her tongue.
Draco just looked down. It wasn't a lie, all his life he'd always had to do things that would please his father. His family background was responsible for his bullying and taunting throughout his Hogwarts years. All he wanted was to make his father proud. It's not like he had a choice, whatsoever. He didn't feel like digging deep into the intricacies of his family life, not in that moment. So he changed the subject. "The point is, she doesn't accept this thing between us, so what? It's not like we're married. But if you think I'm not worth it, well, you can leave and go find some other guy to screw."
He hadn't even put on his coat, he was outside in the freezing March air with only his shirt.
A/N: Just like Adrastea Sivan, Jean Jacques Germain is an OC, and my inspiration for his looks came from Gaspard Uilliel.
"Because you're afraid. But you shouldn't care. Fear is what turned you into a death eater in the first place. You have to react! I'm almost giving up a friendship for this, because I want to be with you! I always felt something strange for you... now I know that there was a lot more behind our rivalry ."
The room exploded with applause as the two of them shared a kiss.
Harry concluded.
He had a big, pointy nose, which reminded Draco of the late Severus Snape.
"Even her drink is posh." She muttered to herself.
"What did he say?" asked Pansy, looking curious.
"But you deserve someone who-" Harry began, but Draco cut him off.
"Harry!" She called for him when she entered the room.
Harry would never eat in the Great Hall. Draco was worried, as he was kept in the dark regarding the other boy's condition.

Harry glared at him. "You're too funny, Ronald. Ugh, my hair isn't even the worst part of this! I'm going to throw up, I know, I'll fuck up the whole thing and Draco will run away!" he said, sitting on the bed and then putting his head in his hands.
George Weasley
Pansy put her wand back in her pocket. "We were just leaving." She said to the teacher.
Luna's grip on Hermione was really strong. She had missed her dearly.
The gallery soon became packed with wizards and witches of all ages.
The three couples were all granted separate rooms, so Harry could sleep in the same bed as his future husband without any unwanted guests-especially Percy-  and the news of the double wedding infected the whole household with a spread of high spirits.
What did Neville have against those couples that he had so dearly stated to love?
"I told you it wouldn't be that bad." Harry said, after the laughter had died down.
Harry gasped. Then he started tickling him.
Hermione gave a giggle as she witnessed the two lovers bickering. She seemed to find them cute.
"Ok, now I'm gonna go get changed for dad's photo. You should too." Ron said, then he left the room, heading towards his.
"Ok, Ok, I will!" Draco said, breathing heavily and with some tears in his eyes from the excessive amount of laughter.
"Hi, you look breathtaking." said Harry when he saw Draco standing in front of him.
Draco let go of Ginny's camera, which she vanished promptly.
" Thanks, Harry, you're the best boyfriend ever!" Harry said in a mocking tone, still tickling him.
"Are you two a thing?" Molly finally asked, crossing her arms.
"Fuck you, Pansy. Don't get too burned, down in Hell." He said, then he left the room.
"May I have your attention, please?" Mrs Weasley called out, after clearing her throat.
Not long before dinner Harry found himself in the library with Hermione, telling her of what had just happened. He watched her eyes widen with what looked like shock together with disappoint. "You made out with Malfoy? I can't believe it... You broke up with Ginny today!" "Shh, Hermione! No one needs to know!" Harry tried to shut her up. "I don't know if you realize just how full of shit you are! I'm gonna tell Ginny. And Ron. You're dead." Just as the girl turned around to leave the room, Harry grabbed her arm. "Oh please, no!"
Her fate was still unknown, though the girl was dreading expulsion.
She had organised a wizard's chess tournament. It had to end before midnight, though, and the winner would be granted a special gift.
Suddenly, everyone looked at her and Ginny. The redhead eyed her girlfriend nervously, then she nudged her softly.
Harry had told him so many things about this special device called a 'television' - apparently, muggles used it as a pastime. It was like a box, Harry had described, and it displayed luminous moving images of people or animals, usually. It sounded a lot like something the Wizards could have used, he found it odd how muggles had more advanced technology than them.
His boyfriend was sitting on the bed, not dropping his fake smile.
As they got off the train in nine and three-quarters, Hermione had already put her arms around Ginny and Luna to say goodbye to them. The latter still had one foot on the locomotive.
He had first set foot in it blindfolded by Harry's hands. Once the other boy had taken his hands off his eyes, the former Slytherin's mouth had dropped very low.
The boy stopped to think for a moment. He was young, he would have been nineteen soon, but then again it didn't mean they had to marry straight away.
"Malfoy," Professor Slughorn's voice called. "You need to come with me to my office. Your father is here for you."
Ron seemed to light up.
As the other girl made her way to the DADA office, she had the confirmation that they were going to see something about Draco and Potter, since she knew that they'd be there for remedial lessons.
Also, dirty dishes wouldn't just fly back to the kitchen.
While he was beating himself up for having said horrible things to Draco, while he wouldn't eat or sleep because of how terrible he felt, the boy who once told him he loved him was making out with a French hottie, not even a week after fighting with him.
He woke up in the middle of the night, must have been around 3 am.
Before that could happen, though, the brunette felt it was time to make an announcement.
Ron said, after counting on his fingers to be sure.
Draco said, smiling.
"I think I'll do some tryouts. " He said.
She was a modern witch, to put it out there. She had married four times, once it was with a pimp. Rumor had it, she would participate in some of the orgies.
"Come on, it is obvious, Harry. Ron hasn't noticed yet...but we both know him. Just focus on your girlfriend, ok?" Harry nodded at that.
"I hate you, Potter." said the Slytherin, biting his nose. That made Harry grimace.
Those words were even more special to Draco because they were coming from her.
"That's for sure. Thank you so much!" Draco responded, squeezing back.
"Night! Love you!" Hermione shouted at them.
"Aw you guys are just so sweet!" Ginny murmured, feeling a little warm in the face.
He had reappeared after days of absence.
"Don't bother, dad, I retrieved them myself." His daughter said.
Their brother, Fred, had died in May. They didn't talk about him much, mostly to numb the excruciating pain his death had brought, but Ginny knew that he would be mentioned at Christmas.
Harry didn't mind not giving his own speech - it would have ended up with him bawling his eyes out, not being able to finish it.
He wasn't mad at him, not anymore. When the words "Petrificus Totalus!" had come out of his mouth, he had felt betrayed by him. But now, he could only feel pitiful for him.
"Well, that's the reason I love him." she finally said.
He had made peace with it.
Harry gulped at the sight of them together.
It was nothing compared to this new touch.
"Ah, aren't they cute?" Luna observed to Ginny, while rocking slightly back and forth. "they don't need a mistletoe." she said vaguely.
"Aren't they so cute?" she said to Ron. "You never kiss me like that at random!"
"I'll go check on her before she runs into Pukey Boplnikes." Luna offered, then she got up and made her way to the girls' bathroom, leaving Ginny and her brother alone to wonder about Hermione's sudden sickness.
She was visibly cold, as she had her arms crossed and she was shivering.
His beau was obsessed with surprises. Even their flat had been one. Draco hadn't got a clue of what it would have looked like.
"Guys, please, don't worry! Everything will be fine, I know!" said Ginny. "Mione... Ron can't wait to marry you! And mum says you're perfect for him!" she looked at Hermione through the mirror, as she was standing behind her.
What he said was true, the last time they had kept things from each other, they ended up not speaking for a week.
"He's... he's the one who brainwashed you." Harry said in a dry tone.
He could never thank him enough for all he had done for hin and he would miss him in an indescribable way.
There was a buzzing of excited voices reverberating through the room.
Molly then went to hug Hermione and Ron. "I hope he's treating you right, dear!" She said to Hermione, winking.
"This is not the real you, our son we knew and loved would have never accepted such invitation.
"Ugh, I swear, I wanted to hex him, so that his mouth would disappear!" Draco complained.
*******
"None of your business."
"We noticed you two have been acting a bit... too friendly." said Harry, gesturing to the two girls.
"You just control yourself ok? Don't want Ginny to be hurt... think of how Ron would react..." Hermione warned Harry, who just acted vaguely in response.
Then, the blonde kissed her way down her lover's abdomen, until she reached her crotch.
"Come on, who cares if you suck at it, this is just so fun!" the Gryffindor said. He took Draco's hand back into his and skated all around the lake, clumsily making pirouettes and tricks, all while a stumbling Draco kept screaming, but he slowly turned his scream into a laugh.
Draco giggled, all while putting his arms around his neck. "You're so cute when you get all fired up about your hair. I like it untamed, it's kind of hot." He said.
It was what he had always dreamed about. A house that looked a lot like his common room at Hogwarts, but it was also quite chic. Plus, it was complete with a "brewing room" that Draco could have used to practice his potion making - his dream career was to become a potionist in Hogwarts. The place even had a small room for Viridis.
Draco gave the baby back to his mother and summoned a package.
They were so into it that no one heard an unwanted person step into the room.
"Aw, come on, we can still see each other through fire communication." said Draco, smiling.
"Oh, here they are!" Harry exclaimed to Ron, who jerked his head towards the door.
"But-"
True, telling your boyfriend to get fucked by someone else isn't really considered romantic.
Chapter Warning: Boy on Boy. NSFW.
He concluded. He wasn't lying. He had finally found the courage to be himself.
Ginny and Luna hugged while crying freely.
Half an hour later, Ron and Hermione were walking around the castle, headed for the library.
"To Fred!" Bill said, breaking the tear-filled silence.
Minutes later, both girls rushed downstairs as the clock stroke five minutes to the beginning of the new year.
Narcissa Malfoy had not left Hogwarts grounds yet. She had fled from Hogsmeade, but only to access the castle.
"Oh, Dear. Worse than a girl!" said Hermione. "I'll go rescue him!"
"So, Madam Hooch taught you how to mount and how to take flight, with the occasional trick. I'm here to show you how to do these things combined and perfectly. I noticed that, during our Christmas Quidditch friendly match, you were good at taking flight, but not at maintaining yourself in balance. " Ginny explained, her voice sounding like it belonged to an expert.
"Hi, Percy." he said to himself, in a mocking tone, since no one was giving him a shred of attention. "So good to see you, brother." he said.
What were the odds of her dating only gay guys?
"Mione, Is this device next to the toilet used for washing your feet? Because it looks... weird."
When they arrived at the pitch, they positioned themselves on their brooms. Ginny mounted her Cleansweep Eleven, while Luna had to use one of the school brooms.
This brought him back to Draco and his father's confrontation, which had taken place the day after their scandal.
Draco, Harry and Ron were already outside, while Arthur was setting his son's firecrackers.
"Father, I don't care about our name, for it is only associated with death eaters. And I never wanted to take part in that." Draco said in a serious tone.
They would have had to stay in a place that sounded like the Leaky Cauldron, only French, Le Chaudron De La Sorcière.
Throughout the last month Draco and Harry found themselves sneaking off to the Room of Requirement for their little sexual encounters.
"I can't look!" said Ginny, burying her face in her girlfriend's shoulder, scared that Harry would get his heart broken.
Ginny was the last one to congratulate her ex. She hugged him like a sister would, rubbing his back lightly. "Congratulations, you deserve this!"
"Don't, Harry, let it go, it isn't worth it." Draco said, then he grabbed him by his robe, motioning for him to sit back down.
Draco sat up swiftly, breaking free from the other boy's grasp. "What the hell are you doing?"
This time, he was alone.
Draco wasn't used to talking to someone that way, so he found it quite funny to see his boyfriend's face in a chimney.
"So, I'll explain the rules." Luna's dad said, clearing his throat.
That night, at dinner, Harry found himself lost in his thoughts as he looked over at the Slytherin table, where Malfoy sat next to his minions. All he could think of was how close he had been with him, how it seemed like they were going to kiss... He felt something weird in that moment, but he didn't dislike it.
Harry turned around. "Ginny, I'm so sorry to tell you this, but you need to move on!" He then went back to walking away.
She didn't take too long to get into her dress, however, fitting Hermione into her gown wasn't as easy as she'd hoped, given the many layers and the zip in the back.
He said, extending his hand to his daughter, who happily obliged .
"It happened right before midnight," said the Ravenclaw. "And as the new year came, we kissed again. But I guess you were too busy enjoying the fireworks to see."
"Yes, oh dear, yes! More than anything I will!" She squealed.
"May I?" Harry asked, eagerly. The Professor nodded and gave him the wand.
Everyone began singing for Ginny, all while Hermione summoned the cake, which flew on the table.
The day she turned nineteen was very special to her, she would see her friends and brother again after months.
"Ah, Draco." He said, seemingly calm. It felt, though, like the calm before the storm.
These thoughts were torture for him, he wanted to obliviate his mind, he wanted to remove this beautiful, raw, emotional relationship that had all been fake.
Then, the Weasley boy moved on to Draco, just as Luna went to Harry.
In that moment, shocks of pleasure invaded both bodies, uniting them in a familiar frenzy of ecstasy.
As time went on, Draco learnt to listen and never go against him.
"You like it baby?" Harry asked, chortling.
"Good morning, Draco. I see you're awake." Harry said with a smile. "Good morning, Harry."
(See the end of the chapter for
The husband and wife to be were already standing on the wooden platform, next to each other.
Draco thought that he had somehow read his mind on the day before.
"Me too!" Lucius yelled.
The redhead in the drawing would blush every time the blonde kissed her cheek.
Hermione's eyes were filled with tears. She wiped her eyes and snuggled into Ron's shoulder, who held her into an embrace and kissed her head, then looked at the kissing couple and couldn't stop smiling. He felt proud of his friend.
They must have slept in. Harry face palmed and Draco did the same, just mentally.
"Remember, we don't have much time. We also have to find that spare second to say goodbye to the girls." Hermione reminded them.
"Tone down the threatening, babe." Said Harry. "Remember that I'm your most dreadful foe today."
Harry felt a lot of disgust for that man.
Finally, the two lovers had found their way back to each other.
He was irate.
"It's on your left... wait, I think you might be my new room mate." said Draco.
When he regained himself from the sobs, he spoke.
Molly was euphoric about becoming a grandma. What she didn't know, though, was that she would be a grandmother of two, not one.
"Miss Parkinson, I heard and saw everything. Your wrong doing, which marks second on your criminal record, is punishable with immediate expulsion, no possibility of a trial. You fooled everyone here; Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter and the whole school. Plus, you forged a signature and made up a person, that is identity theft. " The teacher said in a bitter tone.
Harry still wouldn't listen.
Luna pretended to be upset, but she was actually very happy for that.
Could have also ended better if it weren't for the fact that they had to share their bedroom with Percy.
If anything weird had happened, the non magical attendants' memories would have been wiped out.
As he said that, everyone rejoiced and began pouring the warm butterbeer down their throats.
When the flamboyant man shouted "Sonorus!" Draco and Ginny squealed loudly, looking at each other.
"You'll regret it!" Ron shouted at him as he sat.
"I couldn't talk to you before, but now I am here, Draco, hoping you will see past your rage and at least try to forgive your own flesh and blood." Narcissa pleaded, looking even more emotionally destroyed than before, her gaze fixated on the floor.
After they parted, they disapparated to Ron and Hermione's house.
"Ah ha! There really is something, then! And I will make sure to find out!" Pansy sneered.
"Oh come on, Hermione!" Harry exclaimed. "I can look after myself. He seems pretty genuine to me. You just need to get to know him, that's all. Didn't you say it yourself, that you were ready to become friends with him?"
Harry turned around to face him. "Really? You've been caught and you continue with this lie? Wow, you've just won boyfriend of the year."said Harry, now visibly angry. "I heard Pansy talking about what happened the other night in your room." he explained.
No matter how oftenGinny heard her girlfriend's compliments, she would always blush at them.
Their little playful fights never failed to entertain him.
"Don't tell me," Draco scoffed. "Thank God I'm changing rooms tonight - this is what I talked about with McGonagall."
As he breathed shakily, his lover squeezed his hand tightly, trying to calm him down, telling him that he was there, next to him.
But the thought of receiving a reward from her girlfriend, even if it meant to say goodbye to the Nargle event, pushed her forward.
Also, the way he was asking those questions made him sound like some sort of a therapist, coming straight from Saint Mungo's.
"How dare you?" Lucius Malfoy hissed, reaching for his wand. This brought Harry back to that time he had freed Dobby and that man had tried to hex him.
"I'm pregnant." Her words came out as an almost inaudible whisper.
"Don't talk like this to my boyfriend, Ginny." Harry warned jokingly.
"We really need to thank you, guys." Said Dean, referring to himself and Seamus. "Yes, because your courage inspired us to be courageous. " he then squeezed Seamus' hand in his.
"Eh mine weren't so bad. I wasn't forced to constantly fix your tie." Said Draco teasingly, apparently off the veritaserum now.
She then turned around to face her fellow schoolmates and took a breath.
"I do, but, it will never work."
And Draco had to admit that a proud Harry was too cute to handle.
"Oh, it does?"asked Draco, a hint of sarcasm in his tone.
Hermione had worked her magic on him to make him calm down, somehow.
Ok now Harry wasn't so sure that he was just exploring. "I could end this right now, but I like him!" He shouted.
"I like you even when you look like trash - which is every day." He joked.
There was a Weasley Quidditch Battle, as Harry's birthday request, on July 31st, which was won by Draco.
Not long after the match had started, Ginny was taking a hold of the quaffle.
Their best friends were finally married and that had been too emotional to handle.
"Here we are." Ginny said as they arrived at destination. "After you."
"Oh, well, because I always want to surprise you." Harry replied.
A/N: So, yeah, this story (sadly) comes to an end. I had a blast writing it, I spent entire days on some of the chapters and I really hope it was worth it.
"But, Harry, my father! He will know!"Draco argued. "I have nothing to lose now."
Rosemary hurried inside, complaining of a back ache.
Ginny would replay every move that her idol made, wishing that, one day, she would play alongside her.
"Oh, come on, honey bee, it was still a great match- my favourite part was when the seeker flew in that way you taught me!" Luna chirped.
"Luna, sweetums, really, you shouldn't have done that to him. Sure, he was an asshole and I wanted to kill him for touching your face like that, but you could have been arrested!" Ginny scolded as she pulled on her girlfriend's arm.
"Never! Ah!" Draco screamed while laughing. He then fell on the grass.
He wrapped his arms around his boyfriend, pulling him into a warm embrace, his tears springing freely.
When he purchased it, he told the man behind the counter that he was looking for an emerald engagement ring - obviously, it didn't take the man long to put two and two together.
"Ron," said Hermione, giving her boyfriend a considering look. "He sounds pretty serious to me."
"What exactly are these?" Draco asked, wiggling his feet a bit.
"Oh, no, he's not here now - he's gone into the kitchen to inform the elves that he can only eat some foods, as he has a weird magical sickness. In fact, he's always carrying around a vial of medicine." Draco explained.
And that was the best medicine for stress, it had worked for Harry.
Without him, Harry never would have known a world as mesmerizing as Hogwarts.
Last but no least, she threw herself at Harry. "Oh, Harry, dear!" she said, still smiling.
This was when the bride to be became panicky.
Draco was too shocked to do anything, he didn't even have his wand with him. He cursed himself for having been too muggle-like for his wedding.
"Ah, is this the surprise? You look like you're going to a wedding. You look even smarter than you did at your own wedding." Draco observed, after giving him a long lasting glance.
"Hey, casual Draco and ready for ceremony Harry!" the blonde girl greeted in her usual voice.
"I'm not forgiving you for this." The Slytherin said to Harry, although he didn't look angry at all.
"Oh I hate these moments!" Ron cried as a teardrop as big as a ball fell on his head.
There it is, Draco thought. He still thinks I'm the worst git to have ever lived. He's going to break up with me this very moment.
Draco Malfoy was spending Christmas with her family. The families had been clashing for decades. She wondered how that could have ever worked. But, his presence meant that she could go on and speak to them without the possibility of them running away from her.
"I'll start!" said an eager Hermione, flinging her hand up above.
"I found one!" She shouted as she took it in her hands and lifted it in the air for them to see.
"Oh, damn!" Luna's father groaned. He was a sore loser, unlike his daughter. "This is just beginner's luck!"
"Not in Quidditch, that one would be you. I always win."
"Hi." Draco said and, as he sat, he gave his boyfriend a kiss.
"I'm sorry, I need to.. go to the toilet." she said as she rushed towards the castle.
"Yeah.. long story. Uh, it's in our dorm, right under my pillow." Harry explained.
Harry had not argued Narcissa Malfoy's presence, not one bit.
Luna nodded frantically. Then, she gave one of her gloves to Ginny for her to put on her ear.
Ginny was the first one to grab it, but Luna wouldn't give up on it.
"It's time." she mouthed. The boy gave a nod of understanding, then he sat up and shouted, " I object!" Everyone in the room looked at him, feeling shocked.
"Hello, mother." He said.
"Told you, babe." Harry said to Draco, sticking his tongue out.
"Oh, sorry..." she said, blushing furiously.
He had covered his whole body with the duvet, even his head. Draco found it odd that someone could sleep like that, he wondered if he was even breathing.
He was sipping his butterbeer alongside Jean Jacques, who was drinking something the three friends had never seen before. They were laughing, as Jean Jaques seemed to be teaching French to the other boy, who looked like he was failing at the job.
Ron and Hermione, who had not said anything yet (though they had been clapping), congratulated the pair on their courage. "Thanks." Draco responded. "Although...could I sit with you Gryffindors?" He timidly asked.
The green eyed boy turned his head swiftly, meeting his gaze. "What?" he mouthed to him.
"I told you, Pans, you're like a sister to me." The boy grinned. She snorted. Sometimes he'd feel bad about this, but there was no way that he and Pansy would ever get together. Also, he couldn't tell her why. The whole school would have known faster than he could say "Potter."
Draco was slightly annoyed at the sight of that person, he looked exactly like his former room mate from hell.
Thoughts of his father left his brain as he basked into the warmth of three of the most important people in his life.
"We were really the worst couple." Ginny began, "A gay and a lesbian."
Miss Sivan nodded for him to sit on the chair, all while still scribbling on the essays.
"I said, go away!" Harry tried to shout, but his voice came out choked.
"Let the dance begin!" Molly shouted.
"In this life, I never knew luck." Draco continued, looking straight into Harry's eyes. "But you are the only luck I will ever need. You saved me. And every day you make me the happiest person in the world... I never want to forget how you make me feel."
It was now Draco's turn to speak, him being the Slytherin Prefect.
"I was just showing this filthy loser how to behave. He just couldn't help disturbing me." Draco quickly said. Harry raised an eyebrow at the mention of 'filthy loser' and 'how to behave', it was usually the other way around. He had to suppress a laugh at that.
"Ah, fuck it." said Draco, turning around to face his boyfriend. "Who cares what they say? All that matters is we're together." He then offered his forearm for him to hold.
"That you refuse to sleep in my dorm! It's always me who has to break the law in order to see you at night!" Draco let out in a bitter tone.
Hermione pronounced the password to the common room. The portrait moved to the left and they crawled their way in, one by one.
Draco wondered if he had learnt about his little 'experience' with Jean Jaques. He chose to carry on with his lie, though.
"Take my arms, you two." Hermione ordered.
"Weasley, watch your steps! Where are you going, all sad? Trouble with Potty?"
Tbh I never thought anyone would like it, but I was proven wrong. Thank you to everyone who loved it, your support means a lot to me!
"Oh allo, Dracou, I'm Jean Jacques Germain. My old school is Beauxbatons." the boy said, rolling his Rs and shaking Draco's hand. "The same school as Fleur Delacour, so to speak."
"Tell me 'bout it!" said Draco, putting their heads together for a second.
It was still early, there was still an hour left to midnight.
"You aren't? Well, what do you call being with my sister, but at the same time having wet dreams about Malfoy? And don't deny it, I heard you say his name in your sleep!" he was speaking loudly now, risking to wake up the other three room mates. "Keep quiet, Ron...Look, I don't know what I feel for Ginny, ok?" There, he said it. "So you're using her? It'd make more sense if you broke up with her and told her that you're about as straight as Hermione's hair!"
The six friends had VIP passes, which meant that they could meet with the players after the game. Also, two gadgets per person were included.
Even Draco's birthday was celebrated quietly and quickly -however, Harry promised to do something special in the Summer to make up for it.
"It was four years ago! I was confused!" Harry said, defensively.
"But, really, under all of that army he had constructed, lived a decent guy. He just needed someone to help him come out of his shell. And it seems like I'm that person. You see, we get each other, guys. I feel like I'm home, with him. He's like that dark part of me... but at the same time, that part of me that can make me happy like no one else can."
Ginny decided it was time to leave her hiding spot.
Harry proceeded to lightly tug on the girl's left year nineteen times. It didn't hurt, at all, Ginny observed.
"I'm so annoyed that you won't get to sleep in my bed tonight." Harry pouted to Draco, who moved his hair out his face.
"Now," Miss Sivan's voice interrupted. "I say, if everyone is alive and well, that I give you all five minutes to recover from the shock, then, we carry on with this thing."
"Well, because my boyfriend isn't there, simply." Draco said dryly.
Draco got himself a hot pink banner for his team, while Harry got a green Hollyhead Harpies pin.
Silence.
"I'm sorry Ron," Harry said, looking at his best friend, who was still red in the face. "But I never felt anything like this with Ginny... I guess I was never really in love with her." He then turned around to look at Draco, smiling. His boyfriend didn't see him, as he was chuckling lightly at something Blaise had said.
"Well, well, well, look who's here!" said Hermione, still smirking.
Hermione and her friends were eating chocolate eggs, feeling a bit sleepy as a consequence of their big lunch.
"Ah, Gin Gin, I'm super fine. I worried about you, too. I feared you were dead and the Gordonds of Death were coming for you!" Luna muttered.
But what would father say, if he ever found out? He thought. He'd probably disown me. And Blaise... he'd make my nights a living hell. I wonder if this is the right thing...
There were two rows of chairs; the first one, which was on the left, was golden, while the one on the right was silver.
Narcissa looked relieved with Draco's answer, then she cupped his face in her hands and planted a soft kiss on his temple.
He couldn't believe he had just said it.
"I'll come, too." Harry said.
So, Draco thought it would be wiser to just wait until the whole thing would be over.
"So, you grab a slice of pizza, like so..." Hermione instructed as she held a piece in her hand.
"I highly support this theo-" Pansy was saying, but then she stopped as she saw Draco with Potter. "Draco? Potter? What are you doing here together?"
"I wonder who that might be?" Luna asked herself, then twirled around.
"Yes, it is. I am the one he trusts, now, aren't I? It only makes sense for me to make the first move." the woman explained.
He was something else, really.
In the nights I spent with Draco, I had to sleep with my whole body covered by the duvet, as I would go back to my true form while asleep. Also, I would wake up so early because I had to rush into my actual dorm. It was the only way I had to see Draco in the morning and hear everything he had to say about the obnoxious new roommate.
Harry sighed, then he put a hand on Draco's thigh. "A relationship is not just happy moments, Draco. It's getting through things together."
Many attendants had their jaws dropped.
Adrian winced in pain, then he held his injured hand.
His taunting grew more by the year, until he realised that these were only his ways to seek attention from a person he actually liked.
When the Slytherin girl bent down to pick up something she'd apparently dropped, Hermione wondered if that had been her wand.
Ginny watched as the other two people in the house engaged in a crazy dance, much similar to their secret handshake.
"I love you too, Luna Lovegood." Then, she cupped her face and kissed her softly, in front of the whole bar. She wasn't afraid and she didn't care about what people thought, she had been through too much to even worry about some looks.
"George is getting married? And this is how he lets us know?" The brunette said, dropping the invitation letter and covering her gasping mouth with both hands.
"What?" Draco asked, confused.
The carpet, this time, was red and there were no balloons; the whole of the tent was adorned with flowers, some vases were attached to its ceiling and descended in a cascade of white.
This talk about Harry and Draco made her imagine herself and Neville as them.
"You and Draco are still in a fight?" Asked Hermione, one day at lunch.
Their idea was to go for a leisure flight in the Quidditch pitch.
"Wow, he's got heavy. And bigger!" She observed with a giggle.
Harry had spent most of the journey crying and feeling utterly upset.
Harry, obviously, did not attend the class, but Ron and Hermione did.
The crowd roared so loudly that it was impossible for the group to hear what their friends were saying.
"Thanks, Draco." He said, grinning at him. "And Harry. For putting up with me. But don't tell Hermione how I've been, ok?"
Their peace and quiet was interrupted by a faint sound in the distance, it was footsteps. Someone was approaching the Room of Requirement.
Additionally, he didn't break down and cry like he would have done on other occasions, he just stood there.
"Think of what the parents will say now." Harry said with a sigh. This situation reminded him of when nobody believed him when he'd said that the Dark Lord had come back. He remembered how the parents of some students had accused him and Dumbledore of being corrupted.
Harry fell with a loud "thud".
Ginny looked at her girlfriend with heart-shaped eyes.
What had happened to the old Draco? He was dead.
"You were both late for potions and arrived at the same time because you spent the night together, didn't you?" Hermione simply said, not dropping her very, very infuriating smirk.
Harry grabbed it with a smile and repeated, "Together." Then, they disapparated from the Platform.
Her steps reverberated through the living room, given its hugeness.
"Fine." Draco groaned, rolling his eyes.
"The hell with 'you're like a sister to me'! I'll destroy you, Malfoy! Your father WILL hear about this! We will make sure that this information will fall in the hands of Rita Skeeter!" Pansy yelled.
"Oh my God, are you alright?" said Hermione, leaving her hiding spot and running to Harry.
The other girl simply smiled and went back to her magic beasts ramble.
Then they walked off, leaving him sitting there, his mouth magically sewn shut and his eye black.
"Not to burst your bubble, but... Don't you think you're rushing a bit? I mean, you've just gotten together..." Hermione said.
The snow reigned supreme all around the Hogwarts castle. Anyone who dared walk outside found themselves calves deep into that icy substance.
"You just mind your business." He said in a menacing tone. This wasn't the first time he told Pansy that. He wondered if ordering her to stay out of his business was a way to make her even more interested in that matter.
But what made her sick to her stomach was the fact that Ron, her brother, knew of this, apparently. How could he have done such thing to his own sister?
Both girls were now very confused.
"Ugh, Transfiguration is just so boring!" Draco lamented. It really was; the only subject that he truly enjoyed was potions.
"Oh..." Pansy said, although she didn't look too convinced of what she had just heard. "Isn't it that you like her, perhaps?"
He would have missed it so much. It was where he'd truly begun to live.
Only a few minutes later, the two couples were once again standing on opposite sides of the altar, Miss Sivan right in the middle.
"I don't know how to feel about this, myself!" Hermione whined. "I mean, part of me has always wanted a baby... And I seem to be pretty good at taking care of people... But another part of me is terrified. I don't know if I'm too young... Or if Ron is fine with it. What if I scare him off like this?" She was definitely agitated and she started breathing heavily.
"What a careless son you are, Draco, getting engaged and forgetting to tell your mother." Narcissa Malfoy reprimanded as she walked towards her son.
Harry wasn't too pleased with the results, but he still let Draco pick him up and twirl him around.
Ron nodded, then he added, "Harry must still be in our dorm. He's always so predictable when he's sad. Not that he left it much these days..."
Not to mention, the lad was a good laugh, especially when a butterbeer was put in front of him.
"I see them and I can't help identifying myself in them. Their love reminds me of my experience with my boyfriend, Draco, who is with me today..." He went on.
"None of your business... And I wanted to talk about something else..."
Ginny shot him a warm smile. "Thank you, Slytherbitch." she joked.
When the Hogwarts Express arrived in King's Cross, the two couples were among the first people to get off the train. But they couldn't go to the Burrow just yet, as they were supposed to apparate there and Luna and Ginny, being sixth years, couldn't do it on their own.
"You, of course." The Gryffindor teased. "Not me, as I'm a master."
Hermione laughed her heart out as her boyfriend was making a mess, getting the sauce all over his chin and hands.
The messy haired boy slapped his arm. "What did you just say? I'll end you."
"I like it, too, but I need you to focus on the broom." she giggled.
Or, he would straight-up interrupt her as she spoke.
"Well, you're my boyfriend now."
Harry's body was as far from Draco's as possible. The distance between them was starting to get under Draco's skin.
"Not yet, but I'm not giving up." Luna responded.
At this, Draco laughed so hard that he had tears in his eyes. When he finally stopped laughing, he took a breath. "Oh, aren't you so funny, Pans?" He said, wiping a tear. Draco was genuinely entertained. Oh boy, if she knew who he really liked...
"Oh, mother, I feel so excited yet scared!" Draco said to Narcissa, all while trying to steady his shaky breathing.
"It's almost been a week!" The girl continued.
"No time!" His girlfriend said, then she took his hand and rushed out of the hallway.
Draco suddenly felt a lot of love for his mother. He wasn't fully convinced of her words, but he had to admit that he had missed her and her reaction to his relationship with Harry was nothing like his father's blinding rage... Maybe, all hope wasn't lost, after all. He would live without a father, but at least he would still have a mother. All it took was to give her one chance.
"Ow! Malfoy, are you crazy?" He said.
"Come on, Potter and Malfoy! Don't be childish!" Professor Sivan scolded them. "At least you agree on your mark... "
Both tongues were swirling around each other like dancers, sending the two boys to heaven.
"Nothing." He replied.
"Why, hello!" he said, peeved.
His trail of thought shifted to the last month of his life. He had thrown all of that away because of a few nights of sex with his old enemy. But, for some weird, astronomical reason, he had fallen for him. He had told him that he loved him. He had never said those words to anyone in his life before. He wondered if it all was worth it.
And it was the best thing that could have ever happened to them.
Now she got to call the most amazing girl in the world her girlfriend. Someday, her wife.
Ron flew his sister in the air for how happy he had been to see her. They had become closer over the last year and they had developed a very sweet friendship.
"They could have wiped out your memory of me! Or... Merlin knows what else!" Harry scolded, worriedly.
Now, he knew why his boyfriend was so wary of her.
"I can already see the jumper through the wrapping!" said Ginny, shaking her head.
He knew he'd be sharing his dorm with Jean Jacques, but he really didn't feel like talking to him, not after what they had said to each other. And besides, Harry had to be the one to apologise.
"Pleasure." said Harry.
He looked like he was running for his life.
"Will you stop hurting me?" Harry whined, making a puppy face.
He felt a sudden sense of strong dislike towards him.
"Um, Harry..." asked a very confused Hermione. She was hungover, so she looked a little ill-like."Did we miss anything?"
Therefore, Harry and Draco went back to their seats, helplessly. They both prayed that they'd finish their work as fast as they could, there was still a chance that they could stop the two girls from doing something unspeakable with the photo that they had just taken. If only there was a quick way to communicate with Ron or Hermione...
"Yeah, it was still amazing! Thank you, baby! This was the best birthday ever, and it's all because of you!" said the redhead, then she kissed her girlfriend fiercely.
He would be marrying a truly amazing person.
But Molly Weasley was open minded.
The European Cup didn't have the show of Mascots, but there was a presentation of the team members.
Draco had mixed emotions about it. Sure, meeting the players would have been an amazing thing, but the Seeker looked too much like the guy who had almost ruined his relationship with Harry.
"Yeah, Weasl- um - Ron! Thanks for inviting me." Draco said.
"Hey!" Luna intervened, her nostrils flaring with anger.
"Don't worry. Just hold my hand." Harry said. The grey eyed boy held his hand tightly.
"Who?" Ron asked, clueless
Draco had decided to ignore the fact that the Quiberon Seeker reminded him of someone he hated, so he still went to get his banner signed.
Draco was looking at it in awe.
"You were right not to trust her." Said Draco to his boyfriend, letting out a sigh.
He punched the wall so hard it made his fist bleed, but he didn't care.
"So, what? Could have been Voldemort's son for all that matters, if Harry loves him!"
So, why shouldn't he do the same with Draco?
"You remind me of Ron and I," she said, fondly. "We used to bicker like this all the time."
"Of course, you can not do that." said Professor McGonagall, walking towards the three of them.
"Yes, mum!" The three boys said in unison, as they descended from the carriage.
He just gave Pansy a fake smile.
"Mmm, no. I see that something is up." said Luna, arching her lips.
She and her girlfriend had gone on a date at Madam Puddifoot, as it was their month-and-a-half-a-versary, as Luna put it. Ron and Hermione had never had one, although they would have the monthsaversary. Apparently, girls were obsessed with these things.
"I taunted you for years." He responded, looking down.
"Speak for yourself! Luna and I have one more year!" Ginny pouted. She wanted everyone to think that she wasn't in love with the idea of spending yet another year in that school, but the truth was that she was happy to come back in September. However, it would still hurt to study under the big tree without the gleeful company of her friends and her brother.
He didn't know what to say at this point, he was outraged. After what felt like forever, all while he heard his boyfriend cry, he spoke. "Go back to Jean Jaques, go! Go get fucked by him, since your boyfriend here won't even move a finger for you."
In that moment, Draco heard a familiar noise, it was the passage to the common room opening, therefore someone was entering. "Must be him." Draco muttered, looking behind his back.
Ron and Draco found themselves staring at the screen in awe.
Draco came with a loud moan and then he fell flat on his stomach. Not much after, Harry came, too, and collapsed on top of him.
The two girls made a bet on their outdoor fun for the day; if Ginny succeeded in making Luna a perfect flier, they would have gone to see the European Cup that summer, if the Ravenclaw had not learned anything they would have gone to the Nargle convention, instead.
********************************
"Sorry I punched you." he muttered to him. "It doesn't always show, but I'm a very protective friend towards Harry."
"Yeah, but they're both males!" Percy observed.
In many occasions Harry had proven himself right, he knew that, but he was suspicious of everything lately. When he slept in Draco's dorm he was afraid that a menace would kidnap them in their sleep - said menace was Blaise, to be exact.
For one, they had Whiskeys without the fire bit and beers without the butter part.
"Hey, Draco... have a minute?" the Slytherin girl asked.
However, the moment his taste buds felt the pizza, he realised that he had judged too soon, given his delighted expression.
"No, Harry, we can't just destroy all that we've built so far because of him. That's just what he wants. We are stronger than that, remember?" the grey eyed boy said, moving closer to Harry, holding his hand.
"Yeah, that'd be me. And I don't go over to the Slytherin table because they all hate me. And now they hate my boyfriend, too." Harry snapped, feeling confident.
Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him close to his chest, rocking him back and forth as he broke into a sob.
"Hey, Lu, I missed you!" said Draco. Harry took Hugo from Luna so that his husband could hug her.
"Lastly, know that I don't think you are unworthy of love. Someone will love you, I'm sure of it. It just won't be me. As for your Great Hall thing- you know me. I believe in second chances. I figure you deserve it, too."
"She wouldn't shut up about you being presentable at the Chosen One's wedding... sounds to me like she wants to take advantage of the attention we'd get to plan something nefarious." he snorted.
Draco's face sported a smile that wouldn't drop at all costs.
"What you looking at, Draco?" Said Pansy, as she noticed that her friend was looking directly at the Gryffindor table.
Ginny shook her head, grinning from ear to ear. "No, silly. But it's something that I can't give you out here."
Harry and Draco, though, were still on platform nine and three-quarters.
Instead of being hit by the usual fiery passion that would reign supreme through their nights together, they were both overcome by a freezing dullness.
"Ugh, can't stand the bloke!" Ron complained.
"Try. Me." The redhead said. She was now in Harry's face, giving him a defiant look.
In the days prior to them Hermione didn't sleep much, too busy revising herself to death.
"Uh-oh, are you telling me that you're willing to lie to Potter so that he won't harm Jean Jacques?" said Pansy, gasping slightly.
"To Fred!" the others repeated, smiling through the tears and raising their glasses.
Teachers would say that, because of his 'magical maladies' he was in Saint Mungo's, but Draco knew that something was up.
Ugh, that smirk, how he detested it. He scoffed, hoping he wouldn't see through him and know that, yes, he'd expected a kiss. "I would never kiss you."
"Where is my Luna?" Luna's father's voice echoed through the Burrow.
"Greetings." said Lucius in a monotone.
"I cast Protego around my bed. " Draco explained.
"You read my mind." said Ron. he took the vial of the truth potion out of his pockets and gave it to his best friend.
So, the day of the wedding, everyone received their outfits for the ceremony.
Ginny stopped her, no one in the room knew of them, except their friends and Xenophilius.
"I didn't mean it when I said I should have left you in the fire."
He pulled his curtains open violently, expecting to see only Ron and Hermione.
Flashes of green and red lit up the room, all while shocked muggles didn't know where to turn.
"You were right, I'm sorry that I didn't see it right away. " said Draco, swallowing a lump in his throat.
Ron nodded, then he helped Draco up.
"It is worth it because every day I have something to live for. You're the reason I get up in the morning because I know that, with you, my life will have a meaning." He started. "I lost my family, my house mates... but it is worth it because I love you, more than anything. I never knew love or friendship before you and I won't let that French idiot ruin all of this!"
Not much later, Draco was running after him.
He knew why Harry was acting like that, but he had to put a stop to that as soon as possible.
"Mother... I've missed you, I'm not going to lie... I thought I lost you..." He managed to say through his broken voice.
"You are a Malfoy, your blood is pure, therefore you should not hang out with this... scum. Or this pervert." his father said, referring to Harry, who had not said a word until now.
Luna looked at their hands and blushed slightly. "No problem. I just think you're influenced by vile creatures, but I know that the real you is much better." she said.
"Oh Merlin...He's gone nuts. If Draco says no, it's the end of our best friend." Ron expressed, feeling anxious. He grabbed his girlfriend's hand in hope.
He was with his girlfriend, Ginny Weasley. He would often see them making out all around the castle and he always found it rather annoying to witness. He grimaced at the sight of it. I can't stand them, he thought, I really don't understand what he sees in her. Always kissing her and laughing with her... that bloody redhead.
"I just wish Father was here as well." Draco muttered.
"Oh she's fine." Bill responded. "She's helping mum with some preparations for tomorrow." His attention then settled on the others. "Hi Hermione, Luna! And of course, Harry!" Bill shook his hand. He didn't seem to have noticed Draco, so it was Draco who greeted him.
As the five friends discussed their way through breakfast, Narcissa was in her house, pacing the floor.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Ginny said and pointed her wand at the camera. She opened her mouth to pronounce the spell, but Harry disarmed her with an "Expelliarmus!". He, Ron and Hermione were now taking a hold of her in order to stop her from getting to her wand.
The girl couldn't find the words, she merely gasped.
"Harry, it's not so subtle that you and Malfoy are... exchanging... messages..." Hermione observed one day at Breakfast. Harry and Draco were sending each other looks and magic air kisses. They were not so evident, as the air kisses only took a second to arrive to the recipient. They were heart shaped, small, flying pink clouds that culminated in a soft "pop" upon reaching the target's lips.
It involved them being outside though, was all that he knew about it.
"I'm a what? A nincompoop? Where did you learn this word?" said Harry, nearly falling from Draco's lap.
"Orchestrating this buffoonery! What were you thinking, humiliating students like this?"
"Like what?" Harry asked, entertained.
On that night they were supposed to go out to eat a very special muggle food called Pizza.
"Thoughts of my father are haunting my brain."
"And you had to put up with this for 7 years?" Draco asked his boyfriend in an undertone.
The guy she had been flirting with had dark brown hair and blue eyes and he didn't look British.
His boyfriend kissed him in response. That took him by surprise, but he still dived into it.
But he had to admit that being with Potter wasn't so bad, after all.
"Ginny, stop!" the boy grabbed her wrists, but she quickly squirmed away and planted a sound slap on his cheek. He totally deserved it, in his opinion. "Don't. Touch. Me!" This said, she ran off.
"Hey. I would like to trade my hair with yours so that you could see how hard it is not to look like a homeless man!" He snapped.
Many people gasped. Hermione was now at the center of the attention.
On her left side she had her brother, her sister-in-law and Draco, who was holding her nephew.
"No. My love for him is real, among the realest things I have ever felt." Draco responded.
His fiance's firm hand on his shoulder indicated for him to move quickly, so he whispered underneath his breath,
This was simply a walk in the park, as far as his experiences went.
The three of them were all outside. Luna was holding her girlfriend's hand and she was jumping feverishly.
Draco had almost thrown up when the aircraft had taken off and he had been scared out of his mind with the turbulences and the fact that he had never been this high in the sky, not even in the Quidditch Pitch.
"Congratulations Big Brother!" Came Ginny's voice. It was the signal. Harry was going to be the next one raising his glass for the newly weds.
"What? I just mean, because with you it's like I have friends." Luna said defensively.
"Aren't you in your own world, Harry!" came Hermione's voice.
"Oh, but where is Ron?" Harry asked, just now noticing his absence.
He didn't intend to reveal his intention to his friends - he wanted it to be a surprise for everyone.
"I hope the cake is a giant pudding." Luna mused.
"Oh, you don't know how honoured I consider myself for that, girl." Gwenog said, sighing contentedly.
"My feet?" he asked with a hint of fear.
"You don't think that...?" Harry said, realising what it could mean.
That was when Hermione began fuming. "OH I don't Understand? Tell me, what's there to understand in such betrayals?"
********************************
When time to sleep came, he crept into his bed as fast as he could, trying to ignore the other boy in the room, who was already tucked in.
The white dress, Ginny's maid of honour gown and Draco's suit were all carefully laid on the bed.
"I missed you too! Addie always talks about you two, guys. Even in class. She uses her officiation of your marriage as an example to educate students on homosexuality. You two were legends this year." The ex Ravenclaw stated.
"Oh, and, Draco..." the girl said as she pulled away from Harry. "Don't mind my dad. You will see, he will be fine with it. Let's go back."
The redhead reluctantly passed him to her lover.
But, then, she'd always realise that she had been talking to no one.
But Draco wasn't going to fall for it, not anymore.
"I shouldn't have... I don't know what got into my head, really. I was just angry and... I let that get to me. It was just a shock for me to see... this." Pansy said, referring to the two of them.
"What is up with you, dad?" Ginny yelled to her dad. "You'll ruin Christmas for everyone!"
"You will see, Harry will forgive you. I mean, he's forgiven Malfoy." Luna observed.
"But I don't want you here, you little mudblood." The pale boy said. He was sure that the word "mudblood" was what it took to push Potter's buttons. And so, it did.
"Ugh you just want me to say it, don't you?" Draco said in between laughs.
Obviously, Ron had been oblivious about it, but everyone else had noticed.
Luna emerged from the kitchen to walk towards her friends, little Hugo still in her arms, playing with her anti-nargle chain.
"They must have used the room for something...uh... romantic...like a date." Hermione said in her usual know-it-all voice. The door finally appeared on the wall and Hermione displayed her most triumphant smile. "Ah ha!" she gracefully pulled the door open and entered the room, followed by an astonished Ron. Harry and Draco stood before them, both with their faces pale, as though they had seen a monster.
She didn't pair it with the silver shoes she had been given, but she had decided to go with the simple, casual shoes that her girlfriend had given her for that Christmas.
"Oh, finally!" said Ginny, detaching herself from her girlfriend. "Was he still giving you shit?"
"I need to get used to seeing Harry smooching my sister." Ron said to Hermione as they walked closer to the pair. "Oh Ron, let it go, if she's happy!" His girlfriend reprimanded him.
Her whole ensemble needed to have a touch of Luna, otherwise she wouldn't have been happy about it.
Draco had detached himself from all Gryffindors and Luna, so that he could become closer to Jean Jaques who, he noticed, was not so bad.
"May the best team win!" Said Ron, although he felt even more nervous than his sister.
"Wait a minute..." Pansy muttered to herself. She had noticed that smile.
The right time of his arrival was when Draco had to switch rooms.
Pansy had chosen the right person to imitate. Both he and his "alter ego" were insufferable gits.
"That spicy ginger is my girlfriend, so stay away!" The blonde girl ran from her position, which was in front of a Harpies Chaser, to the French Captain's desk.
"Oh, and you'd always act like the hero of the situation, I bet."Draco mocked.
No Slytherin came, unsurprisingly.
"Ugh, Luna, don't make me think about it!" Ron said, grimacing. The last thing he wanted to think about was his best friend having sex.
There wasn't a single Weasley in the room who had dry eyes, not even Percy.
"She is? Oh dear Merlin, this just increases my anxiety!"
"Addie? Oh, yeah, Miss Sivan!" said Draco, slapping his own head for not getting the reference straight away. "Tell her we miss her."
When Professor McGonagall prounced the word "Hufflepuff!" no one in their last year seemed to give her a shred of attention.
"They say that they're the vilest creatures to have ever lived. But I have never encountered one... only their eggs."
Draco noticed that the whole room was decorated with Gryffindor and Slytherin flags, so much so that it looked like a Quidditch match was in order. There were also paper hearts and petals scattered all over the floor and table. The chairs were two large maroon poufs with the Hogwarts crest sewed on. He mentally applauded the room and its creator for the artsy view.
Hermione and her mother, Laura Granger, walked into a hair salon.
"I don't think so. Last time I checked it, people saw us as two deadly enemies. They'll just think we had one of our duels, if anything." Harry said. Well, that much was true. So they hurried to the potions class. Hungry and with their hair unkempt, but there was not much time. Not that Harry minded the hair part, anyway.
Now, it was Ron's turn to blush. He threw a cushion at his sister, who caught it with a sneer.
"Yes, Minerva, I received your owl. And I can't even begin to express how sorry I am on behalf of my daughter. I can assure you, she had never behaved like this in her life before." Molly said dryly.
"Well, if it makes you feel better, I'm not that relaxed, either... with Ginny and all... and I feel like I'm introducing you to my parents, really." Harry chuckled nervously.
If he made someone feel small, he would be granted the feeling that he would always look for, he felt superior.
"Oh, given his situation, I'm positive that he will not fail us, my sweet." Narcissa guaranteed.
He glared him so intensely that if someone had been in the middle of them, they would have been badly charred.
He had found true love and he wanted to hold on to it as much as he could, therefore, getting married would only reinforce this bond.
It held roughly fifty thousand people inside.
Ginny rushed to him and wrapped her arms around his neck. "Morning love!" She leaned in to kiss him but Harry wouldn't let her. She was puzzled at this. "Look, Ginny... I need to tell you something..." Harry took a deep breath... why did it have to be so hard? Why couldn't he be a cruel man and give zero fucks about Ginny? No, he had to be fond of her. Damn him. "What?" his now future ex asked cluelessly. Here it comes..."I don't... know... if I really... love you..." He murmured. He was visibly shaking now. "You're kidding, right?" Ginny said while pushing him away quite violently.
The black haired boy gasped. "You like that, uh?" asked Draco in a raspy voice.
"Oh my, Ron, I'm going to faint." Harry whispered loudly, so that only Ron could hear.
Draco couldn't believe it. He had trusted Pansy. He had forgiven her for ruining his life and she had not been honest about it. Her tear filled apology had just been for show. He should have known.
"Your brother isn't." said an annoyed Hermione, as she put a flower pin in her braided hair.
"In all modesty, I am proud of myself." said Ron, looking full of himself.
" I need to get the ring, but it's in Diagon Alley. To go there, I need to be granted permission and, since the headmistress isn't here, I was wondering if you could authorize my absence from school tomorrow. Also, if you confirmed to Draco and my friends that I'm at the ministry for Auror talk, I'd be grateful." he said.
On Friday night, he was in the Gryffindor Common room, having a chat with his friends. Luna was the other odd one out.
Ron turned to his girlfriend, feeling uneasy. "She didn't say it back..." he whispered.
"Hoping you payed attention." said Harry.
Draco downed it in one shot.
Although, at the Slytherin table, a perplexed Pansy was looking at the pink trail of sparkles the air kiss had produced, but she could have easily mistaken it for one of those magic illusions of the Great Hall sky-like ceiling.
"You're right, Draco, but if Harry weren't with you right now, you would be sad too." he said.
She had the worst luck when she bumped into none other than Draco Malfoy.
She was surely a fierce woman.
Hermione shook her head as she walked closer to him. "Just can't help yourself, now, can you?"
Luna inadvertently blushed.
"You're cute when you're jealous." Harry giggled, then he pulled him into a sweet kiss.
A/N: Mr Granger's name, too, is made up. His mother is yet another OC
To her surprise, she didn't succeed in it, either.
"Mmm, do come around, though... and um.. avoid those things with Malfoy, possibly."
Ginny reached the seventh floor and hid behind a wall as soon as she heard footsteps approaching. She couldn't believe it when she heard Draco Malfoy's voice.
"Ginny!" Harry called while running to her. Pansy was the one holding the camera, apparently waiting for the whole school to be in the room before acting. They had made it, they were in time. Ginny had her wand ready.
But still, he mentally punched himself for having been so blind.
In the heat of the moment, as everyone was fixed on Harry and Draco, no one seemed to notice Luna and Ginny's quick kiss, except for Molly, whose smile dropped as she did. Although, she chose to ignore it.
A/N: yeah, I know, not much drarry in this episode. But I pinky swear that next chapters will make up for it, my loves.
Draco couldn't help grinning upon hearing that. "Aw, my sweet! I won't leave you alone in your bed, for the next two nights." he said, planting a kiss on Harry's cheek.
"Honestly, ignore them, Draco..." Hermione intervened. "Enjoy easter with us! Try not to give them too much importance, ok? Life is too short to always be this sad. "
"Do you mind helping me finish with the table?" The woman asked, panting slightly. "It's really a toll."
"Oh, well, yes... I think... why?" the girl replied, not giving it too much thought.
Ron was kept in the dark when it came to their fall out, but he had had enough of watching the two most important people in his life grow apart for no apparent reason, so that early December morning at breakfast he decided it was time for them to tell him why they were acting so ridiculously.
"I love you, Ginevra Weasley."
And this wasn't true, he had given up everything, his family, his status, just to be with him.
"Tell me, how much do you want me, Potter?" Draco purred, as he clutched Harry's member with his hand. "Oh f-for the l-love of Merlin!" Harry whimpered. "I want you so b-bad!"
When he pulled the fingers out, he took a hold of his own erect member and, upon lubricating it, he lowly pushed it inside of Draco.
He was now able to crawl, something that his mother defined a nightmare.
He obliged and he added another finger, stretching the muscle, thus getting it ready for more.
They ended up dancing and blasting music all around the living room, all while making snacks and drinks fly into their mouths.
But there she was, telling him she loved him.
There was no way he could ever spend it at home. Not that he wanted to go there, anyway.
The two last year couples spent their afternoon trying to study in the library, as their top spot was occupied, this time, by Blaise and his posse.
She was so similar to Pansy, on this matter.
That gave Ginny a slight sense of hope.
She tasted so, so good, even better than she had imagined. With every flick of her tongue, she brought Ginny to beautiful places.
She wondered if it was Luna or any other of her friends.
How was it that the Malfoys always heard these things about Draco? First, that he was spending easter at Hermione's house, now that he had gotten engaged to Harry.
"Hmm?" Asked Harry, still entranced into his thoughts.
"Baby girl," she started. " Will you please honour me with the details on what on Earth these nargles are?"
"Oh, man! The Keeper was probably ill or something! That is not fair, not in the least!" Ginny whined, feeling defeated.
"I never told you anything about that." Harry observed.
Malfoy had gotten him to fall in love with him to then shred his heart completely, later on. He wondered how someone could be so cruel. Hell, Jean Jaques was surely a set up. They knew each other before and they had collaborated on this damned plan to destroy him.
Meanwhile, at the Defence Against The Dark Arts class, the new professor for that year, Miss Sivan, came bearing results for the NEWTs mock test the students had taken a week earlier.
"Oh, Harry, I know who this is..."
She must have been halfblood.
I don't know how, but their love is too strong for me to break. "
"Yeah, you would always ignore my signs." said Luna, rolling her eyes.
"Yeah, ugh! Not that I slept in my own dorm much, but I still needed to change my sleeping arrangements. I can't always sleep in the Gryffindor dorms." said Draco.
Well, that was certainly unexpected.
"Yeah, a bit um.. aghast, but I'm fine. All thanks to Harry, I guess." said Draco, smiling at the other boy, who didn't return the smile, though.
There was a flush, then the brunette opened the door. She looked extremely pale. She stumbled to the sink to rinse her mouth.
She wondered how her girlfriend could be fast asleep, not in the least bothered by what had happened only hours before.
"Oh, silly Ron." The blonde giggled. "She's in the room next door."
Ron, Hermione, Draco and Harry all looked at each other.
"Ah, Draco how could I leave you behind? Congratulations! I couldn't be happier for you! You're both in good hands." she told him, while resting her chin on his shoulder.
When she finally spoke again, she managed to get out a broken "yes!"
Draco nodded and Harry thanked him.
"She's afraid to play against us." Draco said teasingly.
Ginny's face turned crimson red, but she didn't cover her body. "Oh, no problem."
He found it so ridiculous that Draco could ever like her and he was damn right. But the boy wasn't willing to risk letting him know that he'd been looking at her for so long because he imagined himself as her.
Harry and his two best friends went to the Three Broomsticks, as the Marauders Map had told them that was where Draco was located. Hermione and Ron came as Harry's moral support.
"That's your fault!" Harry talked back.
Every year had left him something permanent, even the year prior to his last- he had helped save the world and finally found the courage to make a go on the girl that he'd liked for years.
It was just too precious to see her girlfriend so happy and thrilled about going to see her beloved team play and this happiness was a consequence of Luna's actions.
Doing so, he'd heard Hermione confess that she was pregnant.
Hermione confidently walked towards the Head Table and shook the professor's hand when she reached her destination.
But what sent him over the edge were Draco's moans, together with the knowledge of the fact that he was enjoying this just as much.
The blonde was indeed very cute with her blue gloves placed on her ears.
Also, he ran no risks of Draco knowing before it was time.
Ginny's heart began to race uncontrollably, she felt warmth creeping up her whole body as Luna's mouth attacked her neck deliciously.
"He says it makes, and I quote, his 'ass look big'" said Draco, barely covering up a giggle.
"Oh," Draco said. Pansy was not trustworthy with these things, he should have known she would tell her blabbermouth friends. He mentally cursed himself for telling her. "I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to get into trouble... I mean, I knew you'd want to fight him or something." He reasoned.
Ginny bashfully took off her hat and gave it to her. "If you cold sign this, I'd be happy." she managed to say. "I'm Ginevra Weasley, by the way."
"I'm afraid I can't. You were just about to kidnap me. You are no longer my mother, if you betray me this way."he spat, looking impassive.
The other girl giggled in response.
"No." Draco replied.
"Because I'm awesome." Draco responded. He then placed a chaste kiss on his husband's lips.
"Harry?" Ron called.
Draco could hardly believe his ears. Harry had just said that he would sleep in his dorm, therefore he had to walk through the Slytherin common room.
When they reached the Stadium, a witch muttered something in French, showing them the way to their VIP seats.
