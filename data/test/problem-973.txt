on the gate to let themselves in.
“Uh, yeah - yes. Full steam ahead.” Harry babbles, his face hot. Ron’s snicker is loud enough for him to hear, too quiet to reach Hermione and Draco so that he can’t get away with elbowing Ron in the ribs without raising curious stares.
"It was implied but don't worry, I forgive you."
dazzled by the green light.
SIDE NOTE: I don't want to get caught up in negativity but I do want to take a moment to mention something. I'm not a perfect writer. In the past, I've written fics for characters who were already friends and didn't have as complicated a history as Harry + Draco + Ron + Hermione have. This was me trying something new out; I started this a few years ago and, rather naively, didn't plan a tremendous amount outside of a basic outline for each chapter and some random scenarios that I wrote chapters around. Needless to say, the ideas I had for this fic didn't totally translate onto paper (well, screen) and I'm very sorry for that.
"Nothing." he says too quickly, turning back to the front of the hall so that she won't catch on. It can be a curse and a blessing to have a friend as perceptive as Hermione.
Harry has no idea how long he's been standing there for or what he may be thinking beyond his carefully blank face. Had he been following Harry?
Harry mumbles from the depths of Draco's chest, "Better?"
Now, though - now, it is as if Draco has finally found his soul again. He glows before Harry's eyes, nimble fingers grasping the hilt of his wand like he is prising Excalibur itself from stubborn rock.
"Hermione, I didn't mean it like - "
"We have Transfiguration in ten minutes!"
"Unfortunately, we have to pass through here so if you just quicken your - "
"Draco..."
that just being able to look out and see all that sky...it was infinite to me."
"Wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination though, would it?" Harry says in way of an admission. "You're not exactly chuffed to be here."
"And that that is a demand - not a request - from the Ministry of Magic itself in exchange for Mr. Malfoy's attendance here?"
to focus and failing miserably as he scans the pages of her book over her shoulder, perks up with sudden interest.
McGonagall wavers and casts a glance at the teacher's table, towards the headmaster's chair, silently acknowledging where Dumbledore and Snape once sat. She stands up straighter, her voice growing stronger.
Harry has just finished telling them about his Christmas, surreptitiously skipping over that near-kiss. He’s decided there are some things that he’d like to keep to himself.
"Merlin." Ron groans, throwing himself down onto the table in mock despair just as dinner is cleared away. He grumbles into the table top, accepting Ginny's consolatory pat on the head. "You know what? Forget I asked. I'll manage with my own - or Harry will let me borrow his, won't you Harry?"
"Draco, no." Harry says desperately, fingers digging into the bed-sheets. "You're one of the strongest people I know. You're not
"OI, DRACO!"
so that you can accomplish something you haven't yet before: let it drop, Potter."
"I'm not sure." Hermione says, nose crinkling; a tell-tale sign of her frustration at not knowing the answer to something. "Did you ask him?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is?”
Yet Draco had called him a friend only weeks ago; his cheeks rosy from flying, the warm slide of his palm against Harry’s, the fringes of his snowy hair falling into his eyes. The glimpses of that Draco have grown evermore frequent and Harry thinks it won’t be so easy for him to slip back into his solitude now.
"As if it never parted with me."
"Leave Ron alone!"
"Oh." Harry says after a pregnant pause.
"Unless you need anything?"
Draco hardly lifts his eyes from the clean lines his hands are making of the cloak and nods, "Vaguely."
"Draco." Harry says in greeting, sliding onto the bench opposite the startled Slytherin.
taken some getting used to. Their trio had suddenly felt like a pair that Harry was intruding upon when Ron and Hermione had began to date. Somehow, it felt like they were moving on without Harry, starting something that he had no place in. He didn't want to feel that way, he didn't want to be an obstacle in the way of their relationship.
, just don't expect the same from everybody else. I don't - I won't. So please, do try to
?" air to his expression.
He'd even been allowed to return to Hogwarts to resume his final year, much to the outrage of his peers - that is, except Potter. Potter, who had immediately shown him such kindness that Draco was loathe to return it. Until - bewilderingly - he had started to, all against his will. Draco bets Granger and Weasley weren't keen on the peculiar turn of events either, especially when Potter started insisting on them all
The rest of the tour of the Manor is brusque, dispassionate even. Draco guides Harry through the vast empty rooms, stripped bare of any furniture they may have formerly housed, sending goosebumps along Harry's spine at how much the place seems all but abandoned. Draco shows him a witch nook, similar to the muggle priest holes of their time, concealed behind a decorative fireplace and used by the family during those uneasy times when witch burning was still prevalent and slip ups could cost lives.
"Would you prefer the Boy Who Lived, then?" Draco suggests, snapping his book shut. "Our noble saviour?"
Harry holds himself still because he can't be sure that Draco won't take flight at the sign of any movement, however slight. There's an edge of nerves about him, permeating from Draco's boxed up body and Harry wonders how long it's been since Draco kissed anyone.
it though; stepping into the dungeons had felt like a scream ripping from his body. Being there had given him a release, a reason to finally turn his back on that chapter when all hope had seemed lost.
Ron holds his hands up, a smirk on his freckled face at Hermione's mortification. "What? I'm just telling it how it is."
It's Hermione's turn to blush.  "I sort of guessed - "
see me. Just some kid who got stuck with his end of a bad deal - one that I never asked for. Someone who doesn't even know what he wants now that he can think for himself. I don't know who I am without the Dursley's - without Voldemort. How messed up is that?"
Draco looks as shocked as Harry feels, his face grey at the sight of it, then panic consumes his features as he returns his focus on forcing the boggart back into its trunk.
Hermione bites down on her lip, lowering her wand from Harry’s essay. “Thank you, Draco. I appreciate that.”
Oh Merlin, he can't
A heavy moment passes. Neither of them speak - Harry doesn't dare to.
With others though - with Fred or Remus, with Sirius - it is inconstant. One moment, he'd be able to bear it, he'd grow used to their absence and learn the new foundations of his life - because that is what it is. All this death around him has taken him back to the start, a place where he has to navigate the uncharted territory of living without them there. His life is changed, a new chapter full of blank pages he is yet to find the narrative for. The rest of the time, he just wishes he could let the pages fall back through his grasping fingers to one of the old chapters again.
Despite that, all he says is, "Just get on with it."
Harry had tried to be there for her as best as he could after Fred's death, as she tried to be there for him. To love each other hadn't been enough in the end, they just weren't compatible any longer.
Harry’s smile widens to teeth, jubilant at the sound of his name finally,
"You never could shut up about him. Always jabbering on about that
Until he seeks out someone who he knows will be too preoccupied to notice. He looks instead to Draco Malfoy continuing on in his mission to glare down at the table like he's hoping to disappear from the spot. A miracle, really, that he decided to come back for his final year. He had to have known the sort of commotion he would cause and yet he still chose to return. Outwardly, Malfoy still looks preened; there isn't a single hair out of place, nor a wrinkle in his clothes but his face is pallor, his complexion ashy against the sleek white-blonde of his hair. Something else is different there though. Harry can't seem to look away from him, trying to place what it is...
"There, there." Hermione says bracingly, coming to his side to pat at his arm. "If it's any consolation, we don't think Draco has noticed either. In that respect, you're perfect for each other."
"Looks like we made it in the nick of time." Ron says with relief, stamping his boots clean. His tone grows playful when he turns towards Harry, shoving at his shoulder with a halfhearted thump. "Next time you suggest a walk down to Hagrid's, I say we check the weather first. Right, how about we head to the common room and make ourselves some hot chocolate before dinner?"
Hermione squeezes his hand again before they step into the hall. The effect of his presence is instantaneous, he knew it would be. He'd been hiding outside for this very reason.
"Where the hell are you going?" Ron calls after him, leaning out into the aisle to stare after Harry hurrying away. He's loud enough that several people have turned their heads. "Pudding is coming!"
Hermione pulls him back into the present with a snap of her fingers, her hand flapping insistently before his eyes.
They've officially broken up for Christmas and Harry is standing on the drizzly platform at Hogsmeade Station, having caught the Threstral-pulled carriages up from the school in a foreboding silence with Draco. Draco, it transpires, is not much of a morning person and as a result, not particularly prone to conversation - not that Harry hadn't tried. Draco was gracious enough to throw him a few one worded replies, shrinking back into the shadows of his seat whenever the light flared upon his drawn face.
practice with the slimmest possibility of interruption. If it weren't for the occasional waves of noise rolling from the Quidditch pitch, Harry would think he and Draco were the last two souls left in the world.
Slughorn waves a hand dismissively as he leans towards Harry's simmering potion, "Yes, yes. That's what I said, Wesley. I expect you added too much Erumpent Horn, hmm? Harry? Mr. Filch?"
Draco spirals on his broom like a sycamore seed falling from a tree branch, one hand reaching to shove a fistful of hair from his beet red face when he's regained control. Harry braces himself for a verbal dressing down but instead he finds Draco grinning.
When they reach the ground floor, they continue through the Long Gallery and make their way up a winding staircase leading them to the Serpentine Corridor on the third floor. Harry takes notice of the missing Staffroom door (the Staffroom sometimes chooses a different location depending on its mood) but is soon distracted by the sight of what looks like every single Gryffindor fourth-year lined up outside of the Defence classroom, chatting excitedly amongst themselves.
Taking a deep breath, Harry focuses his every sense and lets the memory fill him up…
… Harry is torn between laughing bitterly and shouting
”Nonsense, O’Flaherty”, Binns snaps. ”If a long succession of Hogwarts Headmasters and Headmistresses haven’t found the thing —”
Harry watches him sweep across the office to put the half-empty cup down on a shelf full of potion phials in different colours. He pulls a face as the horrid taste of dirt and rotten eggs that lingers in his mouth, but at the same time he feels most of the ache disperse from his head.
”Obviously noy”, Seamus says and nods towards the paper. ”What was stolen?”
”Well”, Harry says. ”If the point of that was to show me that Voldemort is a descendant of Slytherin, or even that he’s an illegitimate halfblood whose muggle dad abandoned him and his mum as soon as the love potion wore off… well, he could have just said. But we spent about half an hour in that Pensieve watching that particular memory of that Auror.”
”—if you were heading to the dungeons —?”
Harry blinks and tears his eyes away from the archway and looks around to see a firey
The next thing he knows, the darkness of his eyelids explodes into a fleshy orange and as he blinks them open, he’s immediately blinded by the bright sunlight streaming through his bedroom window.
”Thanks, Eric”, Sirius says. ”Don’t work too hard now!”
”You…” Harry trails off uncertainly.
”Gerroff, you maniac—!”
”Sweetheart…” her soft voice says.
”I’m sorry…” Sirius murmurs and reaches out to cover the other man’s hand with his own. ”I’ll make sure to be home for dinner.”
him?!"
"Nothing." Draco says quickly with a shake of his head, turning his attention to the gargoyle. He lightly butts the toe of his shoe against the statue. "I can't believe I'm saying this but let's just get this over with and shout passwords at it until it lets us in."
and a silencing charm on the creaking door, grateful for his sock-clad feet as he tiptoes across the stone floor to the storeroom door on the farside of the room.
Harry sinks back down onto the bench. "I can?"
“Will you - “ Draco stops himself, blushes at some internal reprimand, and corrects himself. “May I say something?”
Hermione smiles at the question, knowing that he knows
Harry looks between the two Draco's, at the plain

to help Harry when he'd needed it most.
He yanks the door shut behind him so that its crash echoes throughout half the castle, until eventually even the sound of his fading footsteps leave Harry alone in the night with more questions than answers.
Draco goes limp against him, finally sprawling out, with his head pillowed on Harry’s chest and Harry raises heavy arms to hug the boy closer.
Draco starts talking again and the amusement and warmth quickly leaves his face. Harry watches the silver leave his eyes as the focus of his gaze turns inwards to the memories of what he’s telling Harry, leaving his eyes a dull grey. Harry keeps squeezing his hand, first in reassurance but the more Draco talks, it becomes more of an anchor for Harry himself.
”That’s okay. We’ll just walk you to the door, how’s that?”
”We should do this every weekend”, Harry says as they make their way back to the castle. ”No matter what happens tomorrow, even if neither of us make the team, we should still come out here and fly together.”
The next thing he knows, he’s standing next to the Pensieve in the Headmaster’s office again.
”You don’t remember?” Ron says, looking at him in surprise.
Harry thinks and stifles a sigh, but he doesn’t say anything because the truth is he’s missed Draco so much all summer that he doesn’t even care anymore.
Draco and the others give him a wide berth and wait silently for him to finish his struggles with his school uniform and his shoes, then continues to stay patiently silent alongside him all the way up to ground floor, even when he mutters darkly in their general direction.
” Harry says bewildered — as if he’d be able to tell one insect apart from all the rest!
”Absolutely not—!”
”No”, Harry says firmly.
”Where’s my dad?” He demands, but even as he says it, he knows he’s just stepped into a trap.
”Five more minutes!” Harry yells back before slamming his pillow over his head.
Draco quickly stuffs his copy of Unfogging the Future into his book bag and hurries over to the trapdoor, avoiding everyone’s eyes. Pansy and Daphne hurries after him, but Harry stays seated, smiling to himself.
Draco wrenches his lips away again and leans his forehead against Harry’s as they both catch their breaths.
With tears stinging his eyes and stomach in knots, Harry fumbles with his quill and nearly spills the entire contents of his ink well over the parchment in his haste to compose the letter, but he manages to jot down the message without incident and quickly folds it up and heads for the owlery.
”No, Severus, I don’t…” Dumbledore says with a calming hand gesture.
”What are those?” Harry asks, nodding towards the now destroyed paper aeroplane.
names for us?” Crouch presses.
”That’s fine”, Professor Snape says in a long-suffering voice. ”We can arrange the details later. We need to get started on the lesson now…”
Harry frowns. Something is not right. Draco is never
”Well, it just squirted something out of this end, so I’m guessing that one…” Seamus says.
Harry widens his eyes and gasps, hardly daring to believe it… but when Remus’s smile grows wider, confirming his suspicion, he lets out a squeal of delight and throws himself against the man. Remus chuckles and hugs him back.
Harry grumbles about it all the way back to the castle and Draco listens patiently, but when Harry hurls a passive-aggressive
”Your daddy is going to be fine. He’s just tired”, Sirius says seriously. ”Don’t worry about it, Harry. Really, he’s fine.”
rat spleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly that just
”What?” Harry frowns.
An ’Out of Order’ sign is hanging lopsidedly on the door, but when Harry tries the handle it turns without trouble and the door slides open with a squeak to match the continued wailing coming from inside. Harry tip-toes through the rushing water and glances around the dim bathroom apprehensively. The wailing stops abruptly and he can hear an echoing hiccough coming from one of the bathroom stalls.
It’s been an age! I hope you saw my piece on the International Confederation of Wizards’ Conference this past summer?”
Harry shoots him an unimpressed look. The Irish boy shrugs again, this time with a grin.
For the rest of the Christmas holiday there is a severe shift in attitude towards homework amongst the students compared to before the Yule Ball, as the start of spring term gets closer at an alarming speed.
”One of your ones, actually”, Blaise says with a smirk. ”Weasley…”
”What’s that, pup?” Remus says, combing his fingers through his hair.
Harry trails off as another memory shoulders the first one aside and stretches out before his mind’s inner eye… he’s sliding over the tiled floor, his snake’s body twisting and coiling… Mr Weasley is sitting slumped against
”Oh…” Draco says softly, staring in wonder at something inside the bell jar.
”I don’t know”, Draco says, shaking his head. ”It was like… all the strength just drained out of my body, like… like I didn’t have any muscles left or something, I couldn’t even hold myself up and then I just… fell…”
The brilliant blue eye swivels in its socket and fixes on Harry, and he suddenly feels a strong impulse to join Draco under the desk…
Draco looks horror-struck and just opens and closes his mouth silently a couple of times. Harry frowns, ”Suit yourself…”
Harry gives the man a wry smile and waves back as he holds up one hand in a parting gesture, before turning on the spot and Disapparating.
Heart hammering wildly in his chest, Harry fumbles for his wand, but his fingers are numb with cold now and he drops it to the ground.
I only knew him as T-Tom… We’ve been writing to each other all year!”
Harry feels a thrill of pride as he looks around and notices that most of his classmates cauldrons are either smoking or spitting sparks, not emitting the silvery vapour that his own and Draco’s are.
”With Narcissa? No, no, she behaved admirably… And no, we’re not mad at Draco either.”
”Yeah, just give me one minute… I need to write a letter to my dads”, Harry says.
So he just smiles and nods.
”What do you mean, I’m coming too…” Harry says, grabbing his toiletry bag from his trunk.
”What, dance with you in front… everyone…?” Ron says faintly, blinking quickly.
… Harry nods, and continues describing how Ministry officials started arriving, along with the Minster himself, and Voldemort Disapparated. Dumbledore made him a Portkey to take him to his office — this office — and said to wait for him there and that he would be exactly half an hour… Harry trails off again, feeling a bit uncertain now.
This time when he returns to the Slytherin Common Room, Draco is sitting with the girls in front of the fire again. He immediately looks up when Harry walks in, as if expecting him and when Harry approaches his eyes are wary but hopeful, while the girls glare suspisciously. Harry ignores them and keeps his eyes pinned firmly on Draco’s.
”What? Are you mad?” Draco says incredulously, his already pale face draining of blood at the mere suggestion and making him look as pasty as the Bloody Baron.
”Awesome! So he’ll be back to teaching tomorrow?”
He turns around to see Remus standing at the side of the road, watching him calmly.
”Good night…” Harry mumbles.
Draco nods eagerly and hurries ahead of them on the path.
”I believe that concludes our career consultation, Harry…”
”We shall resume your lesson tomorrow evening. Same time. And you better do your exercises before bed tonight, have I made myself clear?”
”Okay…” Harry says slowly, but picks up the quill, eager to get the detention over with as quickly as possible.
”I’m glad it all worked out”, Remus says. ”Now clear the table please, so we can eat.”
”Well, like I said, I’ve… I’ve taken a liking to you, Harry, that’s all… just thought I’d ask…”
”What’s wrong?” Remus asks.
”, Snape hisses, his eyes narrowing in irritation.
”Harry, I swear…” Draco murmurs quietly.
know?”
Harry smiles against him and nods.
The dark eyes glint back at him, but the man remains silent. Harry falters.
”Don’t make me laugh”, Sirius grumbles. ”No wizard with half a brain takes any stock in that mumbo-jumbo… I still can’t believe Dumbledore introduced the subject in the first place. He obviously doesn’t believe in it myself —”
”Your dad and I have checked into the Three Broomsticks”, Remus says. ”We’ll come back to see you in the morning before we head back home, so we’ll talk some more then… Okay?”
”Good one”, one of the furry boys told his twin.
”It’s okay, Remus. We should get home and start dinner…” Draco says softly, glancing over at Harry. ”Harry, you must be starving by now — and I’m getting hungry, too.”
?” Draco demands shrilly, glaring back at him. ”You’re not competing! You’re not allowed! Professor, tell him—!”
Some things aren't the same. Neville, Seamus and Dean all opted out of McGonagall's open invitation for students to return and resit their previous year. At Fred's funeral, Dean had mentioned to Ginny that he couldn't face coming back. He said he planned to study Art History at Muggle university instead and Seamus had elected to go with him.
aid or the impossibility of his father being here in the castle.
"Well - uh - that's good to know."
"I guess Hermione is ready to move forward. Maybe - maybe don't take that for granted." Harry adds, suddenly struck down by a fear that Draco won't realise how important it is that Hermione has decided to include him. This is her olive branch and if Draco refuses it, Harry very much doubts she'll extend any further offerings of peace. "You said you wanted to live on your own terms. Here's a chance to do that."
Harry starts; he shifts on his heels and finds Malfoy's rangy frame braced in the doorway but he's paying Harry little attention. He's staring at the gramophone in revulsion.
"What in the name of Merlin is that, Potter?"
"Fat chance of that," Ron huffs, forgoing dignity and choosing to scramble out of the ditch on his stomach. One of the scarves has started to slip down his face. "If we get stuck out here, I'd risk even Hagrid's baking over starvation. We'll see who's laughing when you're begging me to share."
"Hold on, you're a - you're a boggart?" he says in disbelief, even as the undeniable screams of his mother fill his ears and his vision clouds around the edges. "What in the - "
"Violet Dickinson, third year. She's alright but she's not as good as you, although maybe after a few games and a bit more training she'll get there. Ginny was fuming after the whistle was blown, she's still peeved about Madam Hooch not calling a foul when - "
done that stuff, he died before he could clear his name. I don't want you to go through the same thing."
"Uh - about that, Ron..."
Draco narrows his eyes at Potter's suggestion to turn back and musters enough of his old nerve to stare Potter down, "We're almost to the top."
"Look, I know what you're going to say. I know that I shouldn't go because this - this
The action had been careless - automatic - but Harry doesn't require the reminder that Voldemort's threat is still felt. He'd been presumed dead before now, it would be a hard thing to expect the wizarding community to completely accept that truth.
." Harry repeats forcefully as Draco allows himself one curt nod. "Please, Professor. I've been thinking about what you said at the start of term feast, about all of us being united. This is how I want to do that." Beside him, Draco makes a small sound of disgust in the back of his throat, quiet enough for only Harry to hear.
"Of course, Professor. I'll see what he can do about
Sixth year had put an end to it, the sight of Draco writhing amidst the pink-tinged water of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom had made sure of that. Screams of agony subsiding into gurgling sobs. Garbled words lost as Draco slipped from consciousness. Harry's vision singling down to those scarlet slashes in a crisp white shirt. Harry had done that to him. It had zapped him out of the paranoia and madness so that he could finally see Draco for what he was: a desperate boy complicated by family beliefs and his own learned prejudices.
Draco can't seem to find his wand. His movements and words start to become more frantic. "It may - come as a surprise - to you - but not all of us - were given a pair - of
"Let me help you with the boggart."
"It's because I think you
"You must be joking?" Draco's gaze shifts minutely towards the Gryffindor table, face closing off as he gestures to something behind Harry. "Speaking of. I think your friends are in need of you, Potter." he says quietly, abandoning his seat the moment Harry swivels around. Hermione is clinging onto Ron's arm, holding him back, their mouths moving furiously like they're in the midst of a mumbled argument. "I'll see you around."
"Speak for yourself! If it's not broken, no point trying to fix it - eh, Harry?"
Chocolate and spit sprays everywhere from his mouth, earning a look of utter repugnance from the Slytherin across the room.
Harry absentmindedly follows his friends, puzzled over this predicament dropped unexpectedly in his lap. He can hardly believe it but he's going to help Malfoy - that much he is certain of - he just wishes he knew
"Presumptuous, Potter, to think you could know me at all. A schoolboy rivalry hardly provides the grounds for personal acquaintance. You and I might as well be strangers."
Harry squeezes his eyes shut, fending off the next twist in his gut. "A word of warning would have been nice!"
He slips out of bed and noiselessly gathers a few items; his glasses on the bedside table, a jumper, his wand, the Marauder's Map, then sneaks downstairs to the common room.
Harry knew the name though. He knew it as well as he could recall the final sound Lord Voldemort ever made as his body hit the earth with a resounding thud. Human. After everything, all he had been was human.
Hermione’s rigid posture softens a touch. “You’re welcome, I’m happy you like it.”
"Oh, Ron." Hermione tuts, pursing her lips in disapproval. "Don't you remember how awful he looked in sixth year? Or when we saw him in - in Malfoy Manor? He was under a lot of stress. If McGonagall trusts him, then so do I."
"I reckon there's always been more to us than that, Malfoy. So what's it going to be? Will you let me help you?"
"I trust that you both know that discretion is key." she says, not bothering to lift her eyes from the parchment. "I would appreciate it if you kept this between yourselves. See to it that you behave responsibly."
about?"
Harry nods. It's an easy enough solution to their problem. "You need to take it from me. Win it."
"So what are you going to do about it, Harry?" Hermione asks briskly, gently nudging Crookshanks from her lap to get ready for breakfast. She starts vanishing any stray cat hairs from her robes with her wand, glancing over at her friend.
"You're here, aren't you? Here at Hogwarts in spite of everything."
Harry ignores that for the present; he turns to locate his bag, begins hastily stuffing his belongings into it. Draco seems to sense the end of today's lesson is fast approaching and affects a firmer tone.
High glossy beams of dark wood contrast with the black and white floor tiles, every surface made to pick up the slightest noise and echo it back to the anxious guest at three times the volume. It's opulent, to be sure - but it's cold, without any warmth to it. Harry has to suppress a shudder of discomfort at the impersonality of it. Even the Dursley's house bore signs of familial love, even if they had neglected to include Harry.
Harry's smile diminishes slightly. He falls back onto his elbows, tilting his head to regard Draco sat straight backed and haughty at the other end of the bed.
shame me. You shamed me through unyielding kindness. It horrified me on multiple levels, Potter.”
them because he'd never known what it was like to be with them.
"Look, it's not just about Quidditch. I - I feel like I'm being stretched all the time," Harry begins, settling himself on the edge of a desk. He focuses on the faded fabric of his trainers, the tears in the rubber from one too many steps made in them, appreciating the ease in which the words seem to just ribbon out of him like fogged breath on a cold day. He's always been one to keep things bottled up until recently, he's surprised to hear admissions flow like this for Draco. "On one side, there's this - there's this
Harry lets out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding, the tension ribboning out of him in one go.
"You didn't see the look on his face. He reminded me of - " Harry awkwardly breaks off the sentence, unable to say it. Unable to say,
Draco holds out one steady hand.
"You were just as helpless as Sirius was."
“Right,” Ron says with an air of decisiveness, brushing himself down of bread crumbs and bacon bits. “That’s enough weird stuff for today. Who’s ready for Charms?”
"Well, it's just too bad, I'm afraid. I'm Head Girl, I have to set an example to the younger students."
Draco tugs the loose collar of his jumper up unconsciously, blonde hair falling into his skittish eyes. He can't seem to look at Harry directly.
"Your point being?"
Behind him, Draco Malfoy is methodically taking the steps one by one, occasionally glancing over his shoulder in fear of them being found out - ludicrous really, he thinks, acting like a scared first year after everything he's been through. He can't help but jump at the shadows that seem determined to set him on edge, movements that turn out to be no cause of alarm: a shadow of an owl gliding by outside of the window, the passing of a stray cloud against the moon.
Draco raises his voice, "And sometimes that can happen without you even realising it? Even when that person is being so overbearingly nice to you when you've done nothing to deserve it."
Draco doesn’t sound nervous the way he used to when it came to facing his boggart. He stares down the trunk with a cool, shrewd gaze, wand raised in readiness. Harry claps him on the back - Draco rolls his eyes at that - and steps aside, allowing Draco to have the honours of opening the trunk.
Potter blinks those intense green eyes slowly, "I thought it was obvious?"
on the classroom floor.
Potter
"Do you ever get tired of being lonely?" Harry asks, half joking to backtrack on his mistake.
"No, it's not that." Harry pulls off his hat, one hand reaching up to tug at his scattered hair before he can think about it. "I sort of promised Draco that I'd go with him to Malfoy Manor for Christmas..."
Draco's eyes follow the shapes of the letters at Harry's fingertip. "I'm hardly the same as Black."
"Remember, write us when you can!" Hermione had said, leaning out the window to press a kiss to his cheek. She'd pushed a neatly wrapped parcel into his hands and then, more hesitantly, "I hope you have a nice Christmas. Don't open that until the 25th."
"What about you, Harry? Do you think it's a good idea?" Hermione inquires eagerly, turning to catch Harry slipping out of his seat. "Harry - Harry, where are you going?!"
He doesn't rush back to class though. Instead, he idles, letting thoughts swirl around his head uninterrupted by Slughorn's incessant chatter or Hermione tutting in his ear whenever he begins to daydream. Seeing that wardrobe has struck Harry down with an idea; perhaps it might turn out to be a fruitless one but he can't dislodge the image of Draco crying on his knees out of his brain. Maybe Draco, like Sirius, needs to be seen from a new perspective. He feels like he owes Draco to at least try.
"Er - yeah." Harry mumbles sheepishly, knowing full well that they had in fact been chatting quite a bit. "We're getting there..."
The house had been so oppressive that, when they had finally packed their bags the day after Boxing Day, made that long walk down the driveway and through the ornate gates, a weight had lifted from Harry’s back that he hadn’t even realised he’d been carrying. He had turned to look up at Malfoy Manor one final time before Draco’s hand had grasped his forearm to Disapparate, somehow knowing that he would never step foot in that suffocating place ever again. He hadn’t felt sorry at the thought.
Harry hoists the broom over his shoulder and raises his eyebrows, not unkindly.
It's more than he's ever managed to say to anyone, even Ron and Hermione. He's tried - of course he's tried. That niggling secret dread that he's cursed,
"At school, the pressure and my desperation only worsened. He'd demand these - these
hadn't tried for the Slytherin team.
The sound of gossip - growing steadily louder like rainfall - dawns on Harry. He notices Draco isn't ignorant to it either, his knuckles white and body stiff as if he's exerting all his efforts to keep from crumpling in on himself. Whispers follow Harry like his shadow; by coming over here, he has burnt all of Draco's carefully cultivated anonymity to the ground.
The turrets of Hogwarts are capped in a delightful frosting of glistening snow, the morning sun reflecting off of the white landscape and dazzling Harry's eyes in its wake.
"What about the Burrow?! Everyone is expecting you. My mum's got your present under the tree and everything!"
"You're disgusting. Do you know that, Potter? You and your - your - good deeds!"
"Merlin's Beard, of course I do! Did you think I was hounding you just to be irritating?!"
"I - I didn't realise it bothered you."
"Oh, shut up."
Harry barely waits for Draco to turn in the midst of his gloating. He draws in his shoulders, butting into Draco with everything he has, a move that would have Oliver Wood weeping with unbridled pride and Madame Hooch disqualifying him from a match in an instant.
No one in the Muggle world would guess that there is anything remarkable about this boy or what he had done. They'd sensed something dangerous mingling with the early morning fog and the dark, churning skies. They'd uneasily laughed off the sweat that dampened their hairline or the prickling feeling of being watched by unseen eyes. They'd read about the disappearances of neighbours and signed it off as just another tragedy. Yet they could never put a name to it; all they had known was that there was
"Why don't you come and sit with us sometime? Ron and Hermione won't mind - "
"But about Malfoy - " Ron begins when he and Hermione break apart, grimacing.
"They told me that for the whole of that year, they felt like they were missing something - that it was like they forgot to pack something in the move but couldn't figure out what it was." Hermione pulls herself up and pins Ron down with her defiance; she looks formidable against the swirling storm behind her. "I did what I had to to keep my family safe but erasing all memory of me from their minds was the most painful thing I've ever had to do. I may not have spoken about it but I thought of them every single day when we were looking for horcruxes, knowing that they couldn't think of me back. Your family knew that you were alive, you had someone to run to when it became too much. Allow me the same right now, Ron."
"Mr. Potter." she says slowly, gaze sliding from one unlikely boy to the other."...and Mr. Malfoy." She carefully lays down her quill and looks between them in suspicion though Harry can hardly blame her for that. "I take it that it was the two of you creating that racket outside? To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Before Harry is able to dwell too long on the prospect of Draco refusing to comply and how best to deal with that, the boy in question blinks out of his stupor and lightly tosses it back to Harry. "You can't blame me for wondering about it. It felt unnatural casting with it. Its bond with you is too strong, it was trying to resist me."
"If anyone needs me, I'm going to be collecting my things and then I'll be in the shower for the next three hours." Ginny says miserably, snaking strands of red hair plastered to her pale cheeks. "Honestly, it's not the same without you, Harry." she adds as she passes him by on the way to the girl's dormitory, pressing a wet hand to his for the briefest second.
, Harry thinks as they emerge out onto the circular pitch. He spins to take it all in: the flags atop of the turrets flapping in the breeze, patchy grass worn away to dirt from feet kicking off of the ground, the roar of the wind whistling through the vacant seats, almost as if hundreds of voices are calling out in unison to urge him on.
“I guess we both got something more than what we thought we deserved.” Harry says, pocketing his photograph. “It’s funny, isn’t it?”
With its swirling robes starting to twist around its ankles, the dementor stumbles and trips backwards despite its best efforts to glide effortlessly toward Harry. Harry casts again and again, not stopping until the boggart-dementor is flailing around, its clumsiness sending a telephone flying off a nearby shelf. Harry spots his chance, sending the boggart flying backwards into the open cupboard behind it before throwing himself at the sliding bolt to lock it shut.
"So you know that I cannot possibly hand this wand over to Mr. Malfoy myself, otherwise I would be facing the discontentment of not only the Ministry but that of the public as well if it were to ever get out."
Ron harrumphs, wiggling further down into his armchair so that he can kick his feet up onto the foot-rest, sending a few discarded Fizzing Whizzbees there flying onto the carpet. He looks down at Harry on the floor and raises an eyebrow, a conspirative "
"The effects of the Killing Curse seem to be finally taking hold of you, Potter. There's no way she would agree to that."
Mrs. Norris stretches out, clawing softly at the thick carpet before she slinks out through the door after Filch but Harry's attention is already turned back to the wardrobe, his mind humming with plans and what-if's.
Harry stares down at his lap, fiddling with the laces on his shoes. He'd heard those words before about Dumbledore's faith in Snape from so many people yet it had never been good enough for him. Is it possible or right to believe in someone else's judgement so definitively that you disregard your own doubts? Harry had been wrong about Snape for the most part; he'd been a bully, he'd been cruel - but he'd been helping Harry all along.
Draco splutters. "I - well, yes but I - "
"Sorry - "
on the rare occasions when she invites me into her parlour, it's as if I'm as far away as the clouds - untouchable but not in the best sense of the word. I feel like I'm constantly trying to - to swim back down to earth but I keep getting sucked back up into the sky."
"What we've always done," Harry says with conviction. "We push back."
"No, Harry's right." Hermione breathes heavily, eyes shining. She seems to crackle with some unseen force, the light that shines when she talks about S.P.E.W but to full wattage. "We can't stop fighting for what we believe in. We
"I can't decide whether that's intended as a compliment or not." Hermione says dubiously.
"Even after everything, will you still not call me by my name?" Harry asks quietly. “Have we really not moved on from that by now?”
Thanks for reading as usual!
"If you really want to." Draco tells him slowly, cautiously. "I - " Draco clears his throat, tries again. "I didn't mean to annoy you."
"Ready, Potter?" Draco asks with some hint of trepidation just as the train begins to slowly chug away, thankfully taking with it their ogling peers.
"Go on then, what's been going on?"
"Okay, we're up here. What now?"
Ron is still in his mud splattered Quidditch robes, dripping all over the carpet in the common room, hanging over the back of Harry's armchair to spy the pages of The Quibbler in his hands. He has a wad of clumpy tissue pressed to his nose, splodges of scarlet blooming like grotesque flowers.
"Christ, Draco. Do you never let yourself have any fun?"
Draco waves his hand about as if to bat the words back at Harry, "
Harry says it nonchalantly enough but Draco swears he catches a faint blush running across the tops of Harry's cheekbones.
Her eyes cut between them again before she reaches down to an unseen drawer in her desk and pulls it open, drawing out the hawthorn wand and laying it on the table in front of Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
and after my father's imprisonment, she simply gave up bending to the will of society and chose solitude over judgement. She chose an easy road and I don't blame her for that."
The sight of the goblets hits home that Harry will be alone with Draco for the next hour. He hasn't given it much thought to how this is going to go but Ron had certainly made his opinion clear after Harry relayed to his friends everything that had happened since he'd left the Great Hall in pursuit of Malfoy days before.
"I heard you blathering about visiting Hagrid to Granger during lunch. You should practice your indoor voice if you'd rather no one overhear your plans, Potter. Making yourself scarce hardly lends itself to your lifestyle though." Draco bites back, pushing past Harry and storming off in the direction of the Quidditch pitch, his cloak billowing out behind him in the winter wind.
Yet when Draco was free of his responsibilities, he often came to Harry. He seemed to have a particular knack for tracking him down no matter what corner of the grounds Harry had disappeared off to and it was -
It's deserted, a chill in the room, the last sparks of warmth from the dying fire close to sputtering out entirely, enough to make Harry shiver in his now damp bed-clothes. He takes a seat in his favourite squishy armchair near the fireplace to soak up what little heat he can and raps his wand against the parchment of the Map, burying his chin into the collar of his jumper.
. Remember that; the house in which you are sorted may be where you will reside but make no mistake, we are all of us family."
Draco takes a bracing breath.
He hates all of it.
her being around but he knows she needs the distance between them for now.
"Do me a favour and just leave me alone for once."
Ginny looks tired. She looks as tired as Harry feels. She contemplates his question, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, and nods decisively.
"Actually, you were." Ginny cuts in brightly, emerging from the girl's dormitory stairway, playfully shoving Ron's elbow off the armrest so she can perch there. "You did it all the time when you were flirting with me. I used to think that maybe you had bad dandruff or something."
"Ever since I found out about this whole magical world, I've been met with some preconceived expectation. They see my mother's eyes in my father's face and already, their estimation of me is based off of my dead parents and who
"...Is that an apology, Draco?"
"It's Weasley, sir." Ron interjects a little heatedly, heedless of Hermione desperately trying to tug his singed robes off his shoulders. "I only bloody went and helped defeat You-Know-Who, not like that should be enough to remember my name or anything..." he adds in a dark undertone.
"Oh - right." Harry says, trying not to sound too glum. "Who's that again?"
Harry shakes his head, no.
Still, he fears. That is, until a few days later.
"You're nothing alike. You're your own people. It's easier talking to you about some things - things that I couldn't really say to Ginny. Ginny, well, she didn't really - "
Harry can't recall a recent night where he has been allowed to sleep undisturbed by the dreams.
"Hermione told me." Ron says plainly.
I'd like to preface this with an apology. I know that it's been a really,
"Fine. Fine, let's get this over with."

" Harry repeats, pulling fingers through his knotty hair. He glances at Ginny. She's as beautiful as ever: freckles on snow-white skin and waves of deep red hair falling about her face, that pure
Draco lifts his wand, pointing it upward towards the wooden structure of the four poster bed. Leaves begin to sprout there, unfurling to reveal small white berries, a beautiful bow of red delicately twining itself around the stems of the plant. Mistletoe.
"I honestly can't believe you, Ron." Hermione reprimands over her stew. "You had
Hermione manoeuvres around a large rock, speaking calmly. "Just because we can do magic, it doesn't mean we need it in every aspect of our lives. We should take note from our muggle counterparts - just think of all the advancements they've made while we're effectively still  stuck in the middle ages!"
Even Ron has the sense to make himself scarce, slipping away with Hermione to give them privacy.
, Potter!" he breathes, pink faced and angry.
"Good," Ron says cheerfully, planting a kiss on her cheek. "I intend to sit in my pyjamas all through Christmas, playing chess with Harry and zoning Perce out when he starts talking about his promotion at the Ministry."
Hope you enjoyed this chapter!
“It wasn’t just the thought of getting my wand back. I thought it would be a joke. I thought you would lure me to a classroom on my own and, I don’t know, shame me so thoroughly for everything that I’ve done that I would run back to Malfoy Manor again with my tail between my legs. I
"What are we waiting for? Aren't we getting on?"
those problems. You're not the cause. You take on too much, you don't owe them anything else."
"Are you okay?"
"I suppose I must." Draco sighs, shrugging off his cloak and beginning to neatly fold it. He catches Harry watching and frowns. "You may not give an owl's hoot about your state of dress but I'm not about to give in to wrinkled clothing for your sake, Potter."
everything for him. I very nearly did."
"Right. Well, now that that's out of the way," Harry says briskly, adjusting his glasses. "Can I hug you now?"
Nearly every face turns to stare at him, a noticeable hush spreading across the room. Some people actually strain to get a glimpse of him, kneeling in their seats and shoving their friends by the shoulder, the revered looks on their faces too much for Harry to bear.
Harry and Draco drop into the seats she gestures to; Draco perches on the very edge, as if prepared to flee at the drop of a hat. From somewhere within the depths of the many cabinets, soft chimes are drifting out into the circular room, the gentle sounds instantly setting Harry at ease.
Malfoy's wand flies out and into his hand. A little embarrassed, he wordlessly offers it in a silent apology. Instead of taking it, Draco grabs onto Harry's forearm and for one wild second, Harry almost mistakes it for an embrace.
“You must have thought the worst of me if you thought I’d do that.”
"We have one house-elf in our employ. It seemed imprudent to insist he clean the entire manor for the sake of my mother, who only keeps to her room and the parlour. I think it can stand to grow a little dusty."
"If you want my opinion, I think you're doing a pretty good job of it."
It's still early hours of the morning, one quick glance at his watch informs him of that but there's no getting back to sleep now. He wonders briefly at waking Ron to tell him about the nightmare, almost immediately deciding against it to spare himself of one of Hermione's pitying looks in the morning.
Harry lets himself sag against the wall, fighting hard against the buckling in his knees to keep upright. He's glad McGonagall had no qualms for him - or any other student whose life had been disrupted last year by Voldemort's reign - to come back, to return to complete his studies. He really is. It's all just a little...too much in this moment.
How can Lucius Malfoy be here? He should be under lock and key in Azkaban. Harry glances over his shoulder, pure terror tricking him into seeing the crumbling rows of headstones of the Little Hangleton graveyard, the glassy-eyed expression on Cedric's face illuminated by the cool blue of a portkey. He squeezes his eyes shut and open again, relief flooding through him when the illusion fades and there is nothing besides a school room empty of all but desks.
"Is that you?" Harry murmurs, already knowing the answer, staring up at one of the largest portraits in the room.
It's of the family -
behalf and yet you still chose to approach me all those months ago. Why? Why do you treat me like I'm - like I'm deserving of it."
Harry shakes his head, instinctively reaching for his scar. "I've spent a lot of my life feeling helpless. I've never been able to turn away from someone who needed help. How could I? How could I refuse after all the stuff I went through? Everyone turned a blind eye to the Dursley's and the way they treated me, I don't want to be the person who looked away to somebody else."
you following him, Harry?" Hermione cuts in shrewdly.
Draco whizzes by overhead, dropping an apple so vibrantly green into Harry's waiting hands that it makes his eyes water.
"I'll be okay - we both will, I hope."
to process that. "Why do none of you sound surprised?!"
for them but he could never
It's only now that Harry realises Draco has no trunk or luggage with him.
my name, after all." he adds haughtily, as if momentarily forgetting that his purpose in life is to be mean to Harry Potter.
Then one dot catches his eye. There is only one Death Eater whose name shows up on the Map and he isn't in the Slytherin common room.
Everyone around them has started rising to their feet, the wide-eyed first year students already being shepherded out of the hall by their respective prefects. Harry stands up and stretches, fingertips reaching towards the familiar starry sky above them.
When he arrives at the staff room door, he's half hoping that Filch isn't there so that he can wonder the castle for a while looking for him to give this headache a chance to pass.
he does.
"...Potter, I need to ask you something."
Harry jolts upright, one hand blindly reaching in the darkness for the handle of his wand. It is only when the unnerving silence is punctuated by Ron's soft snores that Harry realises he is not in the Forbidden Forest but safe in his bed instead.
Harry is fighting his way through the conclusion of his essay for Flitwick over breakfast, hand cramping as his writing grows unintelligible by every passing sentence. He knows he’ll be lucky to scrape an A out of this, though he reckons at this stage in his life he understands the benefits of nonverbal spellcasting better than most.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Malfoy snaps. "Are you saying that I'm weak?"
"I'm taking an interest in Harry's pursuits, aren't I?" Ron says, affronted. He sits up straighter, wagging a finger in Hermione's direction. "Remember when you told me we needed to encourage him more when he did stuff without us?"
"Don't listen to it, Draco!" Harry yells. "Remember why we're here!"
"What are you talking about? I never said anything to do with that!" Harry says, coming over to where Draco is crouched, jostling about on the floor. He places a hand on Draco's back - he's not sure why, perhaps to comfort - and for a brief few seconds, he feels the warmth and the dips in his spine there. Until Draco leaps up and away as if he's been burnt by the touch.
"Don't bring Harry into this. Besides, he's better at Transfiguration than I am."
Harry makes himself spring into action, moving to stand in front of Draco. The boggart-Harry is gone with a blink, now once more the all too familiar towering shape of a dementor.
There is where Ollivander had been slumped, haggard and only just alive. And there - the spot where Luna had emerged from the gloom, pale faced and astonished to see Harry. Then there came Dobby, a hopeful flash of a lifeline, appearing when Harry needed him, just as he always had. Harry glances around the dismal place, the sounds of Hermione's harrowing screams ringing faint in his ears, the remembered helplessness in him so acute that he has to shut his eyes against it.
"But you didn't - "
"Incredible. I believe that should be your life motto, Potter."
With nothing else to do but wait, he takes to inspecting the room to divert the peculiar combination of boredom and nerves; he peruses the complicated charts pinned to the walls and finds himself newly relieved that he hadn't let Hermione talk him into taking Arithmancy back in third year, unable to appreciate her enthusiasm for the subject. He inspects the old engravings from students past on the even older desks. He - perhaps a trifle childishly - doodles the clumsy shape of a snitch onto the corner of the chalkboard, and when he checks the time to see it is now a clear half hour from when Malfoy was supposed to arrive, he half contemplates resigning himself to the idea of being stood up and the strangely crushing disappointment at the acknowledgement.
As if on cue, a shrill whistle rings out as a final warning to board and Harry pretends not to see the watchful faces pressed up against fogged up windows, feeling as if he could be under a spotlight. If Draco had wanted a conspicuous departure, he'd certainly found the most effective one.
”Harry, put Selina down while we’re eating at least…” Remus says softly, carding his fingers through Harry’s hair.
He breaks off, as the jinling and clopping sound of horsehooves suddenly filters in through the open window. Harry realises some muggles must be passing on the lane just on the other side of the trees. Everyone in the room has gone still. Merope is looking even paler than before, her eyes wide and fearful.
he thinks.
”, Parkinson snarls.
as a general rule”, Snape says coldly, but Harry is too shocked to hear anyone refer to Remus as
”Blimey… How can they keep a beast like that in a school?”
”You… sent for me?” he adds tentatively.
He hears the doors to the Hospital Wing open again and two sets of footsteps approaches his bed.
Harry gives a small nod to show the man that he is listening, and that yes, he does remember, so that he will get on with it. The old man mirrors the nod, his face softening slightly.
He rifles through the contents of his trunk with trembing hands until he finds a quill, some ink and a bit of parchment and he hurriedly sprawls out on his front on the floor, jotting down a hurried message to Granger as he’d promised, before jumping back up and wrenching the window open and letting out a loud whistle.
”It’s bad enough that I’m short, why do I have to be smaller as well”, Harry mumbles, looking away.
”Er… Well, it… it depends, I guess…”
”He needs to stay the Hell away from me”, he growls.
”Okay, fine…” Harry mumbles and with a final, furtive glance at the nearest sink he gets to his feet again and drapes the invisibility cloak over the both of them. ”See you later, Myrtle!”
”Oh, yeah, sure…” Harry mumbles, reaching for his wand again. ”
”How’s your first weeks been?”
”Why…?” Harry frowns, his grin slipping off his face immediately.
”The Dark Mark”, Malfoy says quietly and when a soft gasp escapes Lupin, he flinches and big thick tears tumble down his face. ”They were going to surprise me after dinner… it’s a big
”I told him no”, Draco says quickly.
”Thank you, Sir”, Harry says and strides across the room to grab it from the desk.
”Well”, Remus says pleasantly, handing the Aurors a cup of tea each. ”If you didn’t, you’ll know that at least one more person must have been present at the time of the…
”Ron…” the man adds, nodding at Ron as he takes the seat on the other side of Harry.
”Brought my boy with me today”, Sirius says unnecessarily.
”Oh, Sirius…” he whispers and tips forward, throwing his arms around the man’s neck and burrowing into his chest.
”It’s okay, you’re safe now”, Harry murmurs, grabbing his hand. ”They won’t do anything in front of all these witnesses.”
”Is what true, Sir?” Harry mutters.
Draco glances at Harry quickly, but doesn’t say anything. Harry pretends not to have heard and helps himself to some pumpkin juice. He can’t stand Pansy, but it’s really up to Draco whom he talks to.
”OH SHIT —
”Marcus”, Adrian admonishes. ”Not now!”
”Dumbledore’s missing again”, Pansy comments, nodding towards the empty Headmaster’s Chair at the front of the Hall.
Finally, something happens. A ripple of confused whispers erupts all around him, then Granger is running towards the doors and within seconds she comes back with a very haggard-looking Remus trailing behind her. He strides up to Harry’s bed and Harry only has to take one look at the redness in his eyes to know that it’s true. Harry immediately crumbles as the man sidles up to the bed.
His fears are quickly confirmed when there’s a chorus of gasps around him. His arm doesn’t hurt anymore, but on the other hand it doesn’t feel remotely like an arm at all.
”Thank you, m’boy…” Dumbledore says softly. ”You have been most helpful… Now, I will try and return the favour, but first… Let me just have a moment with your professors.”
Even as every single head turns to stare at him, he tells himself
”Hold on, Harry”, Krum’s ghost —
”Git”, Sirius mutters, but is ignored by both his son and husband, who frowns at Harry instead.
Granger has sent him a card again, even though Harry completely forgot to send her anything on
”Yes, well… Nevertheless, there are protocols to adhere to. You will need to blindfolded until we get to the Time Room. At no point are you allowed to see any other room that then the Time Room and Space Room, as per our agreement…” she adds, giving Dumbledore a pointed look.
”Well, no harm done…” Remus says lightly, if a little out of breath. ”I’ll go wait in the kitchen for the others to show up, if you want to show Harry around, Sirius?”
to do that now in front of the whole school. As if sensing Harry’s embarassment, Remus lets go of him again after a record three seconds and with only a brief caress over his head he then steps back from him entirely.
”Nothing, really, just… wanted to talk to him… about somthing”, Harry mumbles.
The high, shiny buildings are gradually replaced by smaller houses kept at a distance from each other by trees and fields. Harry lets his mind wander, staring out the window. He doesn’t mind the countryside. He’d been really excited to move from Islington to Hogsmeade in Third Year.
what’s your problem!” the blonde demands and stops right next to Harry’s desk, slamming his hands down on it.
”It’s a — er — Basilisk”, Harry says. ”You guys know what that is?”
more innocent than we are now, at least—”
”Voice?” Snape says sharply and Harry immediately snaps his attention back to him and nods. ”What kind of voice?”
As soon they leave London and all its curious muggles behind, Sirius pulls the motorcycle off the ground again and they fly the rest of the way hidden above the clouds.
”Yeah, okay, I… I understand…” Harry says, even as the monster thrashes its head to and fro, its jaws opening and shutting again in agitation, the
”But father—”
, the wooden leg falls to the floor as a real leg begins to grow out and Sirius jumps back swiftly, out of the way.
”Idiot. You know what I mean”, Draco grouses and swings himself up to sitting, his pale legs sticking out of the cover and dangling over the side of the bed.
”Er… t-two un… unforgivables?” Dawlish repeats hesitantly, eyes flitting between Remus and Harry uncomfortably. ”That’s… that’s what Harry, erm, says happened, is it…?”
A rustle and a crack is all the warning they get, before suddenly a man has dropped out of the nearest tree and landed right in front of Ogden who staggers back, startled. The man’s thick hair is matted with dirt and his ragged robes and skin are equally dirty. He’s got a wand gripped in one hand and a small, bloody knife gripped in the other. His small beady eyes are staring emptily in opposite directions, which might have been comical in any other circumstance, but right now, Harry has never felt less inclined to laugh.
Harry blinks in surprise and turns around in his seat to follow her narrowed gaze. Granger is standing a few feet behind him. She blushes a little, but her face remains neutral and she ignores Pansy. Shaking her large mane out of her face, she favours Draco with a calmly polite look instead.
"What are you talking about?" Draco says, frowning warily. "If you're trying to scare me so I'll stop —"
”Oi…” the Irish boy objects half-heartedly.
”You were?” Harry says, feeling a stab of ill-ease over not knowing this already.
"I dunno if you strike me as the sort, to be fair." Harry says blithely.
"You don't have to be sorry. You've already spent too long being sorry."
"Lucius Malfoy was rather exacting in his role as a father." Draco begins conversationally, eerily calm as they stroll through corridors with no apparent destination. "I was always taught that if I wasn't the best, I was a failure. I had to show the world what it really
"I wasn't going to say that but it's a good point." Ron says seriously. He lowers his voice, watching Hermione rub at her arm through the sleeve of her puffer jacket, at the place Bellatrix had scarred. "Are you sure you're okay going back there?"
Harry pulls out a crumpled photograph from his trouser pocket. It’s slightly bent at the edges and when Harry places it on the nearest desk, Draco has to twist to look down at it. Two people are waving up at him; one, a woman with flowing red hair and familiar startling green eyes, and the other, a man with light brown skin and the same untidy scruff of hair as Harry's. So young, only a few years older than Harry is now.
Harry stares at that wardrobe and has the strangest sensation. He feels like he's aged a lifetime since that moment four years ago, how different everything had been; how can he be that same boy whose misdirected anger almost manifested into something too terrible to comprehend? He'd wanted to kill Sirius in petty revenge when he thought he had been the one to betray his parents simply because he'd been told - by the papers, by friends, by everyone - that he was bad. He's learnt his lesson that nothing ever really is what it seems.
Harry decides to give Malfoy five more minutes.
The majority had not been happy to see him set free without so much as a year in Azkaban. There were cries of corruption, of bias. Lucius Malfoy may be locked up but his generous donations over the years to establishments, to the
When they dismount, Harry can practically
"Yes, mine." Harry says with a snap, knowing that he can never tell Ron that he'd handed his own wand over to Draco Malfoy. "This is how you get your wand back. I don't know about you but I'd like to report back to McGonagall with
Harry nods without taking his eyes off Draco delicately crumbling chunks of bread into his soup. "Mmm."
"My aunt and uncle made me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs for eleven years." Harry explains nonchalantly; that sickening, twisted fact is uncomfortably easy for him to admit. "I got my own room eventually though - "
"I get it, I know what - "
“I think it makes perfect sense. She loves you so much that the thought of you being dead became such a demanding fear, one she couldn’t ignore.”
"I haven't been touched this past year." Draco doesn't mean to breathe so loudly; he's mortified to hear that ragged sound in his own ears, as if the words are being violently torn out of his throat. His voice takes on a trace of panic. "I can't remember the last time someone touched me, Potter."
"You - you
"I guess I could say the same." she says, reaching out over the table to pat Harry's hand, fingernails chewed down to the bone. Those nails have been a constant source of dismay to Molly. "I'm fine though, I'll be fine."
Christmas at Malfoy Manor isn't how Harry had imagined it. In some aspects, it's
Draco actually manages a small smile, barely a quirk of his mouth but it causes Harry's heart to hammer out in a disjointed rhythm all the same. He has no memory of Draco ever smiling - not like
"No. You know what I mean. Why did it stop being Malfoy?"
Draco ducks his head, thoroughly ashamed. "Sorry."
"Yes. We have Ploddy - that's our house-elf - a chef and a gardener. Ploddy takes on most of the responsibilities in the house and he has freedom to come and go as he wishes although he never really does. He does take Sunday afternoons off, at my request."
"Now? I never get that far. Generally, I just wing it."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco lifts his head in time to see a glowing stag erupt from Harry's wand tip, marvelling at the form as it gallops a graceful arc around the Astronomy Tower. Harry's face is serene as he steers the Patronus out and over the ledge, allowing it to run against the backdrop of the jewelled sky.
Ron told Harry that he was barmy, that willingly putting himself in a room with an armed Malfoy and conducting the entire thing in secret was clearly a lapse in judgement but as long as Harry kept returning to Gryffindor Tower in one piece after their lessons, he'd be begrudgingly alright with it.
"But I haven't gotten you anything." Draco says, grip tightening on the wand like he's waiting for Harry to wrestle it from his grasp now that he knows there's nothing in exchange.
Golden sunshine - the kind you only find at dusk in late summer, deep and warm and orange -  slices the room clean in half. Harry walks over to the window of the Arithmancy classroom, turning to take it in; McGonagall has made the room available for Draco's first boggart lesson whilst everyone else is at dinner. There's an abundant stack of sandwiches piled high on a platter at Professor Vector's desk, a jug of water and two goblets beside it.
"It may come as no shock to hear he was hardly a saint."
During his free period at the end of one tediously long Wednesday, Harry risks Hermione's disapproval and decides to head down to surprise Hagrid instead of catching up on homework, only appeasing her by promising over lunch to dedicate the forthcoming weekend to studying.
When they had veered down a similar vein of conversation before, Draco had been flippant about it.
"Shove off, Draco. I just thought you should have company, is all."
"Rubbish, mate. We were down about seventy points the whole match, we were getting murdered out there." Ron grumbles, kicking off his boots to reveal even dirtier socks. "We're lucky your replacement caught the snitch before Hufflepuff could do anymore damage."
There are times when Ron thinks of Fred and withdraws, privately grieving; Harry had accidentally stumbled, unseen, upon him and Hermione in the garden at the Burrow that summer, to see Ron sobbing into Hermione's lap as she brushed through his hair with trembling fingers. Harry had retreated back into the shade of the house, all at once feeling Fred's absence, not knowing what to do with himself. He'd felt numb. Lost.
making faces! I - I was actually reading a rather fascinating article on international governments within the magical community and the lack of action taken between countries during times of crisis!" Hermione trills, flustered to the point that Harry nearly takes pity on her.
Harry understands that loneliness, he knows it. He'd spent all those years at the Dursley's without a single kind word, let alone the prospect of a comforting embrace. He'd never known what it was like to be hugged earnestly, sincerely, not until Molly. Not until the Weasley's and Hermione, or Hagrid or Sirius. He hadn't realised how you could be dragged back from the edge by a caring touch, how it could help you find your feet again when you thought you'd been spiralling through the air.
"I wouldn't." Harry tells him firmly. "I wouldn't let them."
"Yeah, I really think you do."
"I thought maybe she'd say a bit about you, if I'm being honest." Ron confesses to Harry. "You know, on account of you obliterating You-Know-Who from the face of the earth. In this room. Literally right over there where the Hufflepuff table is."
"Thought I told you to stop apologising."
Harry doesn't even want to begin getting into that with her. He's already backing out the door, his answer trailing off as he slips around the corner. "Oh - uh - yeah, real great - yeah. I should probably get going. I have Potions and Professor Slughorn will be wondering where I am, so...uh..."
"What do you know of being alone?" comes Draco's sharp reply.
"Something like that..." Harry mutters under his breath; he briefly ponders over the idea of calling out to McGonagall until she comes down but that's no good, they could be here for hours. Harry runs both hands through his hair over and over again as he thinks, a side effect of stress that he's yet to break out of; he's starting to worry that he'll be bald by twenty if he keeps it up. When he glances across to ask for Malfoy's opinion on getting through, he catches him already staring back, lips slightly parted as if he's been Stunned. "What?"
"Merlin, Potter. Who would use that mouthful as a
Draco takes a deep breath in, turning to Ron. “The sentiment extends to you also, Weasley. I should have said this sooner but I am deeply sorry.”
Leaving the Fat Lady's protests behind in the darkness, Harry keeps a close eye on Malfoy, periodically pulling out the Map to see if anything has changed.
There isn't much; he spots Mrs. Norris patrolling the lower corridor on the first floor, then there's Peeves zipping around the fourth floor boy's bathroom causing who knows what sort of mischief.
"You weren't going to do it. You were lowering your wand."
Harry can see that Hermione has already forgiven Ron before she says a word, the way the crackling energy between them is swept up and away from beneath the covered bridge by the wind, lost to the stormy skies. She steps towards him, deep brown eyes unguarded and wide, standing on her tiptoes to reach arms around his neck. And Ron - Ron is utterly lovestruck, folding himself into her without a moment of hesitation, his whole body curled around her as if she's the only thing hinging him to this earth.
”Each person’s Patronus is different”, Remus continues in his teaching voice, as he pockets his wand again. ”It will assume the shape of an animal that either represents the conjurer’s personality or essence, or since the Charm itself is built on the recollection of a single talisman memory, its’ form can also represent that particular memory or the essence of a person in the memory, or simply the person that is closest to the conjurer’s heart, such as a lover or a family member…”
why he’s stalling… Because he doesn’t want Harry to see him as a monster!
And he always seem to get a misty look in his eyes whenever Harry does anything to reaffirm the idea that
It’s with bated breath that Harry sprinkles powdered moonstone into his potion and quickly stirring it three times anti-clockwise, before sinking back into his seat to wait for the potion to simmer for seven minutes. However, he keeps glancing nervously at the clock on the wall, hardly daring to let his mind wander for fear of losing track of time.
”YOU FILTHY ABOMINATION!” she shrieks, pointing an accusatory finger at his heart. ”BRINGING BUGS INTO THE NOBLE HOUSE OF BLACK!”
”There is no need to talk”, she tells them pointedly. ”Did you have a question about the course aims?”
”You can’t hear me…” Harry mutters, and just to be sure he waves his hand in front of the Headmaster’s face. ”Or see me… I’m not actually here…”
”No! It’s against the rules, you can’t let him—!”
”— I’ve got it —!”
Slowly, both boys turn away from the door and look into the room. Except it isn’t a room at all — it’s another corridor — Harry’s heart lurches into his throat and he stares horror-struck at the monstrous dog towering over them… It’s the largest dog Harry has ever seen, it’s paws the size of seals and the heads —
”Aren’t you going to send it?”
”Possibly”, Draco mutters. ”But I’m told we’re allowed to… Shake things up?”
Sirius sighs in exasperation, ”Oh, let’s just tell him…”
Sirius claps him on the back.
do you have to talk to the Gryffindorks though? You’re not really friends with them, why can’t you just…” he shakes his head and sighs again, this time in frustration. ”I do love that about you, but I kind of hate it too. If that makes sense.”
Wrenching his mouth away from Draco’s, Harry gasps as he feels the unmistakable hardness that rubs against his own.
There’s a ripple of whispers through the Hall. Harry watches Professor Snape stand and sweep over to Dumbledore and whisper urgently in his ear. Dumbledore nods, but gesture for the younger professor to wait. He looks over at Harry again, his eyes devoid of their usual twinkle.
Suddenly the free period before lunch doesn’t seem at all luxurious, with such a mountain of homework now looming over them.
”For Merlin’s sake”, Blaise says. ”He wants you to go to the dorm with him!”
”Oh-kay, fair enough”, Diggory says in his unwaveringly cheerful manner, which Harry has come to realise is the teaching persona he’s chosen to go with.
”You know what”, Seamus says. ”I will help you practise, Harry! I can’t concentrate out here anyway!”
”Careful…” Sirius murmurs behind him.
”It’s okay!” he calls up towards the trapdoor, now the size of a small postcard over his head.
Slughorn throws his arm out and seems to conjure Professor Snape out of thin air, pulling the other man into his side in a hug as one-sided as it’s one-armed. Harry bites his lip, peering up at the thunderous face of his favourite teacher.
Snape runs a lot faster than him and soon catches up, but Harry’s Seeker instincts are quicker and he darts away every time the professor tries to grab him.
”What is it? What aren’t you telling us?” Draco demands.
”Look, even Dumbledore’s bird knows you’re dead, Harry Potter…” Riddle says pleasantly. ”See what it’s doing?
When all the students are seated, Hagrid climbs into the last boat and shouts, ”FORWARD!”
”And you said ’almost’, which we all know is Harry for ’I’ve opened my trunk and thought about putting some things into it’…”
”Now?” Draco more or less whines, and Harry throws his pillow at his head, ”Yes, now. It won’t take long…”
”It’s okay!” Harry says quickly, as a deep scowl contorts Moody’s face and the magical eye flits over to Draco. ”I’m fine… Really…”
?” Harry asks in frustration.
Harry huffs in amusement as his dad blushes slightly and then shuffles out of sight. After a moment he can hear his muffled voice out in the kitchen, muttering about Remus being
”Oh, come on… we’ll be really careful, she’ll never know it was us—!”
”Didn’t you hear what I said?” Draco hollers. ”
”He…” Draco starts, his voice barely above a whisper. ”Who Must Not… Be Named…”
” Harry snaps back at him.
, Harry thinks and barely refrains from hanging his head in frustration.
”Worst what?” Draco demands.
haven’t even said anything about it.”
Staying true to his word, Draco continues to not-talk-to Harry all day, which suits Harry just fine. In fact, it gives him the chance to observe the other boy from afar to try and make sense of the two of them as a couple. Something that, even in this topsy-turvy world, seems like a ridiculous, if not impossible, idea to Harry.
Harry slumps back a in his seat, feeling a little abashed, but nods and gives the blonde’s hand a gentle squeeze.
”He’s going to tell his parents”, he murmurs. ”That boy, I swear…”
Harry huffs out a chuckle, rubbing the back of his neck and blushing as he shoots Draco a shy look. His stomach is full of Snitches again, a flurry of happy, nervous movement.
, he thinks.
They watch the Sorting Ceremony in silence and applaud every time a new student gets sorted into Slytherin. Headmaster Dumbledore stands up at the podium and makes one of his odd little speeches, and then the feast materialises on the tables in front of them.
Suddenly five other hands are also thrust towards him, as the other Durmstrang boys sitting close enough to reach him want to shake his hand too. They’re all staring at him in awe, their eyes flitting between his glasses and the scar on his forehead. Harry shakes all of their hands awkwardly, feeling very confused.
The blonde then makes a sudden movement towards Harry, but immediately stops dead in his tracks again when Harry staggers back. He looks stricken, like Harry has just punched him in the face.
A barrage of images flits through his mind, images of shifting rainclouds giving way to rainbows, of caterpillars turning into butterflies, of sitting in Tramsfiguration and watching Professor McGonagall transfiguring an owl into a pair of glasses.
”Did he wear anything festive?” he asks eagerly. ”I can’t
Professor Snape’s eyes dart up to meet his curiously, ”This evening is Professor Slughorn’s dinner party.”
"Do you miss it?" Draco finally says to the chandelier hanging above him when the next crescendo of applause and cheering quietens down.
At that moment, a young house-elf - Ploddy, Harry remembers - comes bounding around the corner. He's a far cry from how Dobby appeared when he served the Malfoy's. His uniform is pristine, a bright white pillowcase bearing the house-elf's name neatly embroidered in electric blue upon his breast. He's holding a sugar bowl in one hand and a tea cup in the other.
"You're looking dry." Harry observes, accepting the warm hug from Hermione and catching the familiar comforting scent of her: lavender and vanilla.
Harry can't stand to hear much more for Draco's sake and steps into the path of the boggart, giving it no time to draw out the cries of his mother or the bright green flash that haunts his dreams to this day. With a deftness that only endless practicing can bring on, he easily overpowers the boggart and guides it back into the safety of the trunk, the latch securing itself back into place so that all the boggart can do is trash about on the inside of its prison.
Hermione breaks it, for once struggling to find the right words. "That's - that's really quite - "
A simple tap on the lid of the trunk from Harry's wand causes it to flip open, a blonde head already emerging from its depths, rising tall and imposing before Draco - Draco, who seems to shrink even as the boggart replica of his father steps out of the trunk and regards him with an inscrutable expression.
"It's three o'clock in the morning. I insist you come back here right now!"
within them both. The blankness in their gaze is identical; Harry's heart breaks for him.
"I don't want your charity, Potter. No deal."
"Perhaps I'm masochistic."
“For what?”
There had been a lull in news of Draco Malfoy after the outrage had died down, until of late. The word had begun to spread from unnamed sources that he would be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his final year. Harry expects the backlash will be tenfold what Malfoy had received during his trial.
Across the table from him, Hermione is softly tutting at his frenzied pace, siphoning some of his messier ink splotches off the parchment in a show of sympathy.
, Draco thinks in despair.
This chapter is by no means perfect but I hope you like it!
I shouldn't have gone back to Hogwarts. I know how it looks to other people, the sheer entitlement of it all. I'm tired though. Tired of having things taken away from me."
"What?" Draco says absently, lifting his eyes from the watch face. "Oh, Merlin no, Potter. We're not taking the train."
"I said, I had it handled." Draco repeats firmly, glowering at Harry beside a stack of Muggle magazines.
It had taken surprisingly little time for Draco to give up everything he had to Harry; he can be flinty but he cooperates. He can be private but his best kept secrets whistle through gritted teeth like steam from a kettle. He can be rude but sometimes Harry can't help but wonder if Draco hates him as much as he
"Next time?" Lucius laughs coldly, fingers lightly tapping against his cane. "Do you think I would be so stupid as to let you nearly ruin everything again? No. I think not, Draco..."
"Concentrate! Remember
For a second, the air between them is thick, dangerous with static. Ron's lips, smeared ruby red with drying blood, part as if he's about to hit back, the tangy taste of cruel words already on his tongue - but then, it's as if he becomes unplugged. The anger seems to zap out of him quicker than it came on. He balls up what's left of his bloody tissue and they all watch it zip across the length of the room until it wings its way into the wide mouth of the bin with a revolting splat.
"You're hilarious," Harry says drily, winding back his arm to catapult the apple up and away, pleased when Draco hurtles after it on his broom, exactly what he was hoping for.
Draco doesn't seem to be at ease now, not here in his own home. This time, something gives him pause; he casts about the room, voice dropping to a whisper as if afraid of what his confession may unleash or what spirits of the past may be around to overhear it.
"You remember the spell?"
They’d parted somewhat awkwardly but warmly in the entrance hall, Draco headed for the dungeons and Harry for the seventh floor, with the arrangement to meet for their first boggart lesson of the year that next day. With his wand now in his possession, Draco’s determination to overcome his fear had seemed to triple.
. He doesn't point out that Draco had only just made a joke about them dating to begin with. "Next Friday it is."
Harry follows her line of sight and sees Ginny next to Ron. He watches her fiddle with the fork in front of her, unusually subdued, a curtain of hair concealing her expression. They'd broken up the month before; it had been mutual, heartbreaking because the grief between them was simply too great and they'd realised early on that it wasn't working anymore. They'd cried together on Ginny's bed the night they confessed that to each other, mourning what they could have been if not for the war, if not for the death, if not for the agony that wrung out any good thing between them. Harry loses himself for a moment, remembering the stifling darkness from her sheets pulled up over their heads, the overwhelming scent of her floral shampoo against the pillow so that it slowly suffocated him, her breath hot against his face and fogging up his glasses as she pressed a kiss to his lips.
"It truly astounds me that you've talked me into this." Draco drawls, shifting his face out of a patch of sunlight pouring in through a nearby window, leaning beside the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to the office.
"Well, maybe count to three next time!" Harry says, resurfacing to see Draco watching him with mild amusement, then the ever imposing childhood home of the Malfoy's looming just beyond him. "I, uh - don't remember there being so many gargoyles on your house..."
When the last scraps of dinner are cleared away and pudding has been all but demolished, Harry pushes the crust of his treacle tart around on the shining plate in deliberation. He doesn't look up when he speaks.
"I'd appreciate it if you sat back."
"This is your house, Draco."
Ron deserves to be known by his name. He deserves to be seen.

"Acid Pops."
"Got anything better?"
For the most part, Ron is unchanged. His friendship with Harry has only grown stronger, any petty jealousy from their younger years banished once and for all. Ron anchors Harry into himself, almost makes him feel like nothing has happened when they laugh together but it never lasts long.
Hermione snorts, finally giving up to frustration and melts a path in the snow with her wand. "Don't be so dramatic, Ron." she says as she slides in the slush to lead the way.
"What is
"Anything beats the cupboard under the stairs."
A moment later, a knobbly elbow nudges Draco's ribs.
"Look, I don't know what you're trying to do but I can teach you how to fight it."
serious about their education or when she's standing on a foot-stool in the common room trying to recruit more people for S.P.E.W. She shakes the hair from her face and turns to throw the full weight of disapproval in Ron's unassuming direction.
to go back to Hogwarts, for myself." Draco explains. "I need to start living on my own terms and that includes people being free to think of me as they please. I need to - to relearn how to be a person."
"Ah - um, Draco, m'boy? A word about the coming term, if you will?"
"Oh please, Potter. I don't need to be treated to another one of your little speeches about how desperately sad I am. Come on, this way."
"You said you had staff to meet when you asked me here?"
"You've got to know me better than that by now. This stuff doesn't come naturally to me either, alright? It took me months before I got with Ginny."
Draco allows himself one lonely breath of a derisive laugh. "And this, our grand saviour? Unable to decipher his way into his favourite teacher's office?"
"You'll think of something." Ginny says confidently, a smile in her voice. So sure of him that he has to blink away at the prickling in his eyes. "You always do."
"Exactly," she agrees with a small, satisfied smile. "I can't give it to Mr. Malfoy so I'm giving it to you instead, Potter. I'm entrusting
This is practically risque for Draco.
Ron laughs incredulously, "Hermione, no one will even know if you let me borrow your notes if you don't tell them!"
Ron's parting words had been less tactful. "If he starts driving you mad and you want to duck out of there early, come straight to the Burrow. You don't even have to send word."
Draco turns enough as they pass beyond a tapestry concealing a passage so that Harry can see his disparaging eye roll.
"Really," Draco leans forward, folded arms pressing into the table. "And what
"Oh - fine!" Hermione concedes, softening after a few seconds of regarding Ron with narrowed eyes. "I suppose you've earned a break."
"What's with all the questions?" Harry bristles, violently yanking up the zip on his hoody. "I thought you weren't here to be friends."
"Not as well as it could," Draco confirms Harry's suspicions reluctantly, eyes lowering to the wand in the Gryffindor's hand. "Something seems off with it now."
Harry nods, grateful to her for that. A part of him nearly tells her how much he misses her; he misses her casual teasing, the snort in her goofy laugh, the competitive streak that arises during games of Quidditch or Exploding Snap or when someone questions her hexing abilities. Ginny is wired differently to Ron, their need to prove themselves manifesting in wholly opposite ways: where Ron pulls back deeper into himself, bridling and stewing until everything spews out of him at once, Ginny grabs at everything she does with both hands and stares it down until it moves out of her way. Harry
valid and I love you.
Harry doesn't recover enough to act completely natural but Draco takes no notice.
"It's a matter of principle! Harry - Harry, tell him! You've written your own notes, haven't you?"
"I was thinking we could hold a revision group for O.W.L and N.E.W.T students in the common room during our free periods - or after dinner in the evening? We could make a party of it, maybe provide some snacks and pumpkin juice so that it'll be fun! I know that I wished we'd had some scheduled extracurricular studying during our fifth year - "
"It's still not good enough though, is it?" Draco snaps, weak and shaking right down to his bones. He swallows down the poison in his mouth, lets it trickle heavy and bitter into his gut instead of unleashing it upon Harry. As compensation, he kicks at a chair and falls haphazardly into it, limbs hanging limp and zapped of energy. "He's still
"Are you okay?"
"Well - "
Draco takes a step back. Then another, and another until his back hits the opposite wall across from Harry. He thrusts his hands into his pockets, crossing one long leg in front of the other, the tone of his voice cooler than the corridor itself. With his pale skin and white hair, he might as well be forged from ice and snow, distant and unreachable as an iceberg.
"This is what you wanted. Get it over with, just do it."
an act. Draco always used his father a threat because, to him, that was the worst thing he could think to inflict on someone. He deserves our kindness, not ridicule."
Harry knows that Draco is seeing exactly what he is, a perfect parallel of the last time they had been here together when Draco had come to collect Griphook and Harry had been captive; Draco's fear had been clear to Harry even then, his shaking voice barking orders through the locked gate with as much conviction as someone who had a choice between only this or death. He knows that Draco is seeing not just how close the two of them had come to something perilous, but how far they have both been altered since that desperate time.
