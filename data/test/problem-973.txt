) When Harry finally felt the cresting waves of orgasm wash over him like a tsunami, and shudder-moaned Draco’s name, Draco would hold him tight, telling him all the while that
I was wondering if the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures might be interested in passing a law to make degnoming illegal. I have first-hand proof that gnomes are actually intelligent and benevolent creatures, and it seems cruel to pluck them from their homes and throw them about. Floo me so we can discuss it.
“I’m sorry,” I tell her. “I’m sorry I’ve spent so long without seeing all that awful stuff that seems so obvious to you. I’m sorry you had to explain all this to me. I’ll try to be better, I promise. I want to be better.”
I gesture towards a chair, she pulls it up and sets her handbag on her lap, smoothing the grey wool of her skirt with her left hand. She still doesn’t say a word. I feel her chestnut eyes trying to bore a hole at the base of my throat.
“Let me tell you what you’re going to do, Harry, since you’re too stupid to figure it out on your own. You’re going to go to your hotel this very instant, and you’re going to pack your bags, and then, you’re going to Apparate to wherever Draco’s dragged his sorry arse and you’re going to convince him that he needs to take a chance on you, or you’re going to die trying.”
“This part requires some concentration,” he warns me as the contents of his cauldron turn bright turmeric yellow. I tell myself his change in demeanour is entirely explained by the apparent difficulty of this step in the brewing process and watch him in silence.
And then, she’s out of the door, the sound of her heels the only reminder she’d ever been here. I collapse into my chair and don’t move for the rest of the day.
Harry does not mean to answer that it didn’t hurt when he died because he’s never told anyone about it and because it would be a stupid answer anyway, wouldn’t it? But it’s the only one he has, this stupid answer, it’s the only one that wouldn’t feel false or trite or useless, and so the words escape his mouth unbidden before he can even think about holding them back.
Nothing works and his heart keeps beating slow and steady in the unbearable emptiness in his chest as the name of the only person he will ever want sits on his tongue and sticks to the roof of his mouth like honey.
Draco opens the door. You stop thinking again because he’s here, pained and lovely, struck by your presence as if by lightning. You don’t tell him you love him, but you walk up to him, slowly, and he lets you (he lets you, he lets you) and it is a first step.
She squeezes my hand back. I can tell from the look in her eyes she’s putting a reading list together for me in her head and I silently vow to read every article and every last book she gives me. I owe her this. Before I can tell her as much, Ron asks if he might cast a few diagnostic spells on the writing.
“Tell me how you found my shop again?” He asks, grinding up the thick leaves of some sort of succulent plant into a paste. “Not that many people manage to find it by chance, especially since I can’t afford to have a proper storefront yet”
“I had tea from the tea trolley too,” she adds. “But everyone has tea from there. I don’t think whoever did this could have known exactly when I’d want a cup of tea and which cup I’d want to drink it from.”
The inside of the shop is surprisingly bright, given the lack of windows. I suspect someone with an expert hand at interior design charms has had a hand in that at some point. Other than that, the shop is entirely unremarkable. The hardwood floors are tarnished with time, and pine shelves full of boxes and bottles and jars stretch from floor to ceiling on every wall. I recognise raw ingredients—nothing rare, things like asphodel and dittany, things I remember using in potions class at Hogwarts.
“Yes.” Harry’s voice is sob-strangled and bark-rough. He knows he’ll regret it as soon as the word spills from his lips, but he’s too far gone to fight. “Yes,” he whispers again against Draco’s collarbone, delirious with want and love and grief.
“You’ve always been one for hopeless cases until they get too hopeless and then you run away, you mean?” he hisses, before turning around and adding in a deadly, quiet tone: “You ran away from your entire life when it got too difficult for you, then ran right back into it by impulse, buying something and letting everyone else fix all the messes it made for you. I should have known, really. It’s what you’ve always done. Still, I expected you to have changed at some point in the past five years because I am, apparently, an idiot.”
It wasn’t until he came to Switzerland that he finally found a place that cast a hook in his heart. It wasn’t until he saw the
Then, the anxiety constricted his lungs and filled his mouth with cotton wool, and there were no words left to say anymore. All Harry could do was shake helplessly in the cold silence of an empty house, with hands clutching his heart and tears streaming down his face.
This is the part of the story where everything turns into a disaster. This is the part where the world turns on its head and everything spins out of control. This is the part where you come violently against Malfoy in a dingy back alley, with quicksilver in your veins, ashes on your tongue and eyes shut so tight your entire vision turns to white.
Draco’s opening the buttons on Harry’s shirt with trembling fingers, and Harry can’t look. He can’t look—he’ll catch fire if he does, he’ll combust and burn with blackened flesh and charred-chalk bones.
“I’ll burn this entire street if I damn well have to,” Harry continues over the sound of sirens filling the air. “I’ll burn this entire town if that’ll make you talk to me because I can’t take the silence anymore. I can’t take the silence that covered the world after the war, I can’t take not being in your life, I can’t take not having your name on my life every single day because I—”
“You think you’ve been targeted because you’re a woman?” I ask. The look Hermione shoots me makes me wish I had kept my mouth shut.
“It’s a beautiful house,” Harry says, the softness of Draco’s magic still clinging to his skin like the scent of soap. “I promise. It’s incredible, and it’s broken, and it deserves to be saved, Draco. It deserved to be saved so much. Please, help me save it. Won’t you help me for old time’s sake if nothing else?”
That night, when Harry lets his hand snake across his belly and down into his pyjama bottoms, he thinks of all the good bits and nothing else.
Your hand is black and blue and swollen at the knuckles. You’ve cried, and you’ve yelled, and you’ve begged every single item of furniture in your house to tell you, just tell you how to make him come back. Tell you how to make it right.
“It wasn’t right, I see that now. A child cannot grow up without being allowed to laugh, and cry, and love. But I never had the opportunity when I was a girl myself, and I didn’t know how to tell my own child I loved him more than my life. I hurt him, denying him a normal childhood. I taught him to put up walls that he never knew how to take down, and by the time I realised how much damage I’d done, it was already too late… You’d already left.”
I don’t know how to explain everything to you. I’ve never been good with words, have I? It’s what got us into this mess in the first place.
“Haven’t we been happy, this past week? Haven’t we been good for each other? Draco, we could have this. It could be you and me and a crowd of ghosts in an empty building. We could build things back together slowly: the house, our relationship too. And when all the floors are waxed, when all the walls are white and all the windows clean, we’d realise all our old pain has been painted over by new memories too. We could be happy here, Draco. I could be happy with you. I could make you happy if you let me.”
“I will translate for you,” Iris continues. “This time, mind you. I won’t always be around. I’d say I have a life of my own, but clearly, I don’t. Still, I might have better things to do, you know? A girl can hope! So… As I was saying. I’ll translate for you into French, and then Annemarie said she would translate into Swiss German for Greta and Vreni. So we all know what you’re saying and we can give informed consent—that’s the phrase, isn’t it? Informed consent? Or was it enthusiastic consent?”
You don’t mean to switch back into an Auror and let everything that was important to you slip into the background as you put other people first out of habit and muscle memory, but you do. And it’s only when you feel the honey-warm brush of Draco’s magic on your skin that you realise what this looks like to him.
You go through everything once again, as she taps her foot restlessly on the wooden floor and nods sharply every time you finish a sentence. You’re glad the chat you had with Lee did at least spur you into taking a quick shower and getting dressed in appropriate clothes because when you make it through less than three sentences before your voice turns sob-broken and shaky, she doesn’t offer any comfort. Her dark eyes pin you down, silently appraising how honest your grief is, and you have never felt so small in your entire life.
“I have to.” Harry’s voice was flat and almost inaudible as he let himself fall onto the sofa and stared at the ceiling. “They’ve suffered too, they need someone to hold on to, to tell them it’ll be alright.”
It is all I can manage before Freya, outraged at the journal I am holding precariously perched on top of her, lets out a distraught scream and both of my hands in her fur are needed to pacify her again.
, although some scholars, such as Plutocrasius Merriweather, have theorised that it can be traced back as far as Antiquity. Little is known of the use of the spell until the late 13th century; in the 14th century, however, it seems to have gained in popularity, and by the middle of the 15th century, its use is attested, both in literature and in magical theory, as a mean for young people of all social strata to ensure they are entering a successful marriage.
This is how Harry finds himself in the chapel, hollow-hearted and paint-speckled, almost two weeks after Draco left. It is every bit as beautiful as it was the first time Harry saw it: light is still pouring in and leaving watercolour-puddles on the flagstone floor and the wooden pews are still dust-covered and finger-polished by the years. Harry sits silently as if to pray. Then, he closes his eyes and tries to pull the past week out of his memory like a weed (tries to dig it out of his flesh like a splinter or a bullet, tries to spit it out like a mouthful of gravel or sand.)
Everything that was holding Harry together shatters suddenly. Words lose their meaning entirely. (And time. And reality.) There is only Draco—Draco’s body pinned under him, Draco’s fingers inside him, Draco’s voice all around him.”
He hands me the cup. I hesitate. I wasn’t expecting him to want me to drink anything right there and then.
The forest disappears, and the lake, and the sky. And Draco, too, of course, and that’s the worst loss of it all.
And in the warm light of afternoon, surrounded by happiness and friendly faces, with his hand in Draco’s, Harry finally thinks he knows what it’s like to be home.
“I’m happy you came back, you know,” Draco eventually whispers, “I’m happy you’re here. I’m happy it’s you who shows up here when I can’t bear being alone anymore.” There is a small silence, a sharp inhale. “I know it didn’t work out between us at Hogwarts,” Draco continues, his voice fragile and shaky, “and I don’t think I’ve ever told you that I was sorry about how it ended. It was an awful time, wasn’t it? We were so young and so afraid and in the middle of a war. It was so hard keeping it a secret even when our lives depended on it. But I really am—sorry, I mean. And I’m happy you didn’t choose to  die.”
The trees are tall here, their crowns reaching into the blue-grey fog, their branches all weighed down with humidity and vines. The floor under Harry’s feet is moss-soft. Leaf-crisp. It is autumn and everything has turned into taxidermy fireworks of reds and golds.
You run out of words, suddenly. It is overwhelming, acknowledging this. You let out a heavy sigh. You’ve gone this far, you remind yourself. You’ve told him this much. And you’re still afraid that he’ll reject you, still afraid he’ll tell you he never loved you, still afraid it might have been just sex to him—but you’ve lied so much already, and you’ve hidden so much already, and if he breaks you? You know you’ll heal. You know you’re strong enough, now.
“I want to touch you,” Harry whispers, running his hand down Draco’s back, further down, further down, until they’re rubbing small circles around Draco’s puckered hole. Draco arches his back as he cries out in pleasure, and he’s
Draco starts fucking you in earnest after that, grabbing your shoulders and your hair, biting vicious kisses into the skin of your back and calling out your name. Pleasure overcomes you, blinding-white and scorching-hot. You make embarrassing sounds, you lose yourself entirely in him, in the motion in the act. You want it to never end—the feeling of him inside you, the sounds of him and the smell of him. You want it to never end, but it feels too right, too good, and you feel your orgasm in your bones a split second before you come all over the floor, Draco’s name on your lips. Draco comes at the same time, clutching at your hair and groaning curse words into your neck.
, Harry thinks. Draco’s eyelashes flutter shut, he lets out a small, shaky breath. They’re still holding hands, and Harry can barely remember how to breathe because if they can kiss in this dream, and if Draco isn’t really dead, perhaps there is hope after all. Hope that one day he can kiss Draco in the real world instead of in forests and by the sea and empty labs. Hope that if this version of Draco wants him too, kisses him too, perhaps so might the real version of Draco one day. Harry’s heart catches fire, bright and hot and hungry at the thought.
Despite some grumbling and suspicious glances, the few eighth-years turned back to whatever they were doing, and the low murmurs rose back to their former level. Draco took a deep breath. “Well, I imagine the reason you haven’t figured it out yet is because you’re looking too hard. All I really did was adapt a typical Disillusionment Charm to work with voices, and in different layers. The hardest part was getting only the intended target to hear the true message, but if you’ve ever had a notebook or something that’s charmed to only open to your touch, well, it’s something like that.”
In the grand scheme of things, being on the sidelines wasn’t too bad. Draco had expected to be hated, stomped all over and spat upon by those who felt he owed them reparations for his part in the war. But as bitter as people were, he seemed to have escaped their derision; perhaps there had been an unspoken agreement in the Wizarding World to let bygones be bygones and not start more decades of pointless fighting.
Harry had looked so disappointed that Draco had almost changed his mind. Almost. But no, he had to be strong. Before he drove himself into insanity. It was especially hard since he had begun to spend more time with Harry and his friends since the first night Hermione had forced them all together. So close yet so far, and it was unbearable.
Weasley’s statement sent the room back into excited chatter, and like everyone else, Draco turned back to his breakfast, though he didn’t have anyone to talk to. None of his Slytherin yearmates had returned after the war, and none of the younger ones wanted to associate with him. Which, Draco was willing to admit, was quite reasonable. If he was anyone else, he wouldn’t want to associate with himself either.
“I don’t understand,” came Harry’s reply. Draco could practically hear the bemused frown in his voice. “Who would send me a Howler just to tell me that I should take better care of myself? Why couldn’t they just say it to my face?”
“Oi!” came a yell from across the room. “Harry, mate, are you going to kiss him already, or what? We’re all waiting.”
“Point taken,” Harry said, dragging a hand through his hair bashfully. Draco noticed that Harry’s hair was still kinked from the braids Draco had given him yesterday, taking a page from Luna’s book. “I guess I’m the idiot.”
Harry leaned closer, shielding Draco from the stares with his broad shoulders, and Draco was grateful. It was bad enough to break down in front of Harry like this, but he didn’t want the whole room knowing he was on the verge of a breakdown. He’d stopped acting like what his father would call a proper Malfoy since the war, but that didn’t mean he had no pride at all. “When’s the last time someone hugged you, Draco? When’s the last time you felt like someone cared about you?”
The Howlers were Draco’s way—a very Slytherin way, but a way nonetheless—of supporting Harry from the sidelines, letting him know that he was loved in a way beyond the blatant hero-worship that he knew Harry despised. Because yes, Harry was a hero to Draco, but a
Draco smirked to himself, bringing a piece of toast up to his mouth to hide his face. It wouldn’t be his voice, he’d made sure of it—the spell to disguise his voice had been one of the easier ones to figure out, in the grand scheme of things. His own voice, which he liked to think of as somewhat distinctive, would be replaced with a voice impossible to identify.
“What kind of hint is ‘You’d never guess without a hint’?” Draco heard Weasley grumble. The Golden Trio had settled in the library for the weekly afternoon of mandatory study time, as dictated by Granger, and Draco had parked himself nearby, hidden on three sides by towering bookshelves and complete with a sturdy Disillusionment Charm just in case. He had hoped, correctly of course, that Harry and Weasley would be so desperate to avoid studying that they would try to draw Granger’s attention away with a good mystery.
“Come on, now, you,” he said gently, his voice loud and clear amid the silence. The owl hooted indignantly but hopped onto the finger Harry offered all the same.
The next time Draco lifted his head from Harry’s shoulder to wipe at his eyes, the common room was empty. Most likely Hermione’s doing, he thought wryly. Honestly, he would be surprised if Hermione had chosen their spots on the couch to result in this seating arrangement. Far too cunning for her own good, and for Draco’s.
So, instead of talking with a friend, Draco spent the rest of breakfast definitely not watching Harry as he gazed about the room determinedly, no doubt trying to figure out who it was that was sending him the messages.
“Well, there’s the one to make the voice unidentifiable, of course. It’s the same voice for both messages. The base message is the one that everybody hears, because if it didn’t work, I’d rather have that message publicized than the other one. So the second layer is changing the base message to the real one for him. It’s really not that complicated once you understand how it works, but it took me a few weeks of research in the library to figure it all out. If you want some further reading, you might consider—”
one, not an all-powerful savior. Draco knew Harry’s humanity all too well, and had scars crisscrossing his chest to prove it.
“I think I’ll let you puzzle over it a bit more. Don’t think I haven’t realized your attempts to get out of studying, boys.” The amusement in Granger’s voice made Draco chuckle, but it also sent a jittery feeling tingling through his limbs. Because if Granger had guessed right—and he didn’t doubt she had—he suspected he’d soon be getting a talking to.
“Yeah,” was the only thing Draco would say in response to that. He couldn’t very well admit that he had been actively hiding from Harry, could he? “Harry? I want to thank you for speaking up at my trial, even though you didn’t have to. I—I’ll never be able to thank you enough for saving my family even though we were horrible to you. Even though
Hermione waved a hand, not caring that they had an audience. “Do you think they’ll understand what we’re talking about? Even I haven’t been able to figure out how you did it. If anyone asks, I’ll tell them I had some theories for Harry’s Howler mystery and wanted someone to consult. Someone who, unlike Harry and Ron, would actually be able to keep up. I love them, but they can be rather slow.”
Draco watched the other side of the Great Hall furtively, doing his best to appear completely absorbed in his breakfast. But that was hard to do, especially when he saw the school owl he had chosen the night before make its way towards the Gryffindor table.
The chaotic chatter of the Great Hall fell to quiet murmurs as Harry reluctantly reached towards the owl, the crowds no doubt wondering who in their right mind would send a Howler to Harry after his victory over Voldemort. And had Draco not been the sender, he, too, would have been outraged. Quietly, of course. But if everything worked according to plan, this wouldn’t be any ordinary Howler.
Draco’s face burned at the reminder, and he groaned. “Don’t bring that up, I was such a slimy git back then, I feel awful.” He looked up to meet Granger’s gaze. “I’m sorry, Granger, I really am. I treated you horribly.”
“As you’ve told him,” Hermione added wryly. “Very smooth, I’ll admit. Yes, okay, I think I understand.” She held out her hand. “Friends?”
. “You don’t need to cry.” But that only made Draco’s eyes burn more, and he bit down on his lip before he did something ridiculously daft like tell Harry he loved him.
Draco knew for a fact that Harry and Ron would not like to join the discussion. However, Draco also knew that Weasley would say yes to make sure that Draco wasn’t conducting any sort of funny business with his girlfriend, and Harry would join once both of his friends had joined. Hermione was far too clever, far too Slytherin for her own good.
“You’d best open it, mate,” Weasley said, the near silence of the room doing nothing to hide the angry tone of his voice. He glared around. “Maybe someone will recognize the voice, and we go give the bastard what they deserve.”
“So,” Draco repeated weakly, silently contemplating making a run for the door. But that certainly wouldn’t end well.
For as incorrigible and snobbish as Draco had acted towards his teachers in years past, he truly loved learning in a way that only someone like Granger would understand. Those hours spent in the library, poring over book after book and piecing together the bits of knowledge they offered to perfect his charms—well, Draco hadn’t enjoyed himself quite so much ever, really, and certainly not since the end of the war. It provided an escape from worrying about his mother, all alone in the manor after his father had been exiled to France. And while Draco had felt horribly guilty since fourth year about being a downright git to Harry, he couldn’t deny that riling Harry up wasn’t fun.
Draco pulled back, partly out of shock and partly out of the need to look at Harry’s face to make sure he wasn’t joking. “I—you—what?”
“Well, yes…It was a stupid crush at first, of course, but by then, well, I—I loved him. I couldn’t—” Draco swallowed a sudden sob. He’d always been prone to mood swings, but even more so since the war. And with his feelings for Harry thrown into the mix, he was a disaster. The Mind Healer he had seen over the summer liked the phrase “emotional fragility due to an unstable environment during childhood.” Draco preferred “messed up,” euphemisms be damned. “I couldn’t see him die, even if it meant getting tortured or killed. He deserved so much more than what he got.”
“Good lord, the kisses didn’t say it for me? Fine, fine- though it pains me greatly to admit this out loud, I have grown somewhat...attached to you? In a...romantic fashion…?”
“Hermione! Reading again, I see. What are your eyes feasting upon on this lovely evening?” Theo said in a sing-song voice as he approached from across the library aisle.
With a loud grunt of displeasure, Draco swiftly packed up his things and forced himself out of his compartment, Theo right behind him. As soon as his crossed the threshold between the compartment and the hallway, he collided with something very tall, very orange, very freckled, and very angry.
Ginny sat staring at the crackling fireplace before her, the heat warming her cold limbs. The night was still young, but the chill still crept through the stone walls of the castle. She let out a long awaited exasperated sigh, sweeping a curtain of red hair out of her face.
Draco was much too used to staring at the curtains of his bed. Whether the insomnia was from stress, or sadness, or anger (usually towards himself), he would always be forced to stare at the bed curtains.
if she touched it, she could find Theodore- but the world stayed still as she planted her hand on the same page. She sucked in her breath, waiting for something to happen- anything at all- but for several seconds, nothing did. Then the whispers were back, surrounding her in the same cloud. This time, she didn’t back down, standing up tall despite her fearful quaking. The screams pierced her ears, but she screamed right back, voice filled with a boiling fury she had never shown before.
“Theodore! That’s wonderful! I can’t believe I didn’t notice it sooner!” Luna hopped up to give him a quick hug, then bounced back to her previous position, feeling her face reddening.
Luna nodded in agreement as the shaken pair righted themselves. She casted a quick Muffliato on them as they slipped under Harry's invisibility cloak, so they wouldn't be heard or seen; he was quite sure that it was hours past their curfew, and neither Luna nor himself had Head Boy or Head Girl curfew privileges.
Ron wove through the aisles of the library searching for that familiar bushy brown head, scanning with his eyes. He was so busy looking for Hermione he didn't hear the soft footsteps behind him.
"Ronald," she spoke in her signature whimsy, soft voice, "Why are you hitting the wall? That must be awfully painful, considering it's solid stone." He looked up at her in a pleading way like he hoped she was some goddess with all the answers to his questions.
Hermione’s shot up from her book. “Now where exactly did you hear that? You weren’t eavesdropping, were you?” As his grin widened even more, she scolded, “Theodore Nott, I really did expect exemplary behavior from a prefect like yourself.”
Hi, so this one's a little longer than the last one. Hope you enjoy it. I promise that I'll go into more depth with the "funky death room" in the next chapter.
Okay so there's another slightly confusing time jump in this chapter, but if you think back to a previous chapter, this time jump will hopefully make sense. I labeled it, too. I hope it is understandable and I hope you enjoy it! :)
I will be back on February 3rd with a new chapter. Thank you for reading! I hope you've been enjoying this so far! I apologize for delaying the next chapter, but as much as I hate myself for making this decision, I really need this time off. Again, I'm really sorry for making you wait, but I'm not doing so hot. Thank you! See you next week!
"What the hell?" Harry wondered in fearful unease. The blood had completely disappeared from the ground. And at that exact moment, he heard a whisper of a familiar voice and felt the familiar tug under his navel as the world spun and transformed.
Suddenly on edge by her behavior, Harry, too, brought his eyes up from the book and listened intently. And there they were. The softest hint of footsteps on the naturally muffleling, carpeted floor of the library. He would never have noticed them, but Luna was always so perceptive; he was grateful it was her and not Ron in that library.
But suddenly the beautiful fantasy disappeared, replaced by a very angry, very zoomed in image of Hermione and a very tired looking Harry opposite of her.  She was glaring down at him in the most adorable fashion, and he immediately put on a goofy grin to see if she could keep a straight face...and after several seconds of this facial expression war, he realized he was on the losing team.
"I wager that if any one of us lays a finger on her right this minute we'll get hexed straight back to the Platform," Ron mused. She didn't respond to his answer, merely sending yet another angry look in his direction. At nearly the exact same time, the train began to slow to a stop.
The footstops grew closer, the thump on the floor loudening significantly. Harry's heart thudded in his chest with adrenaline, praying it wasn't Filch or worse...Malfoy. But as a lanky, chestnut brown haired figure came into view from behind the bookcase, Harry was momentarily relieved to see it wasn't either of the two dreaded candidates. But that relief dissolved as he saw the green and silver of a Slytherin tie beneath the robes.
GOD she hated EVERYTHING about that absolute SUPREME ARSEHOLE MALFOY. She hated his face, his smirk, his hair, his
Ginny jumped from the hallway in a sprint as soon as she reached the bottom of the stairs, climbing the hills of green in the night just as quickly.
In an instant, it felt like Luna’s whole body was being torn apart, as though a million hands were grabbing and pulling, stabbing through flesh and bone. She screamed in agony as an icy cold filled her up to the brim, freezing her body in place. Her blood stopped. Her limbs ceased all movements. Her bones felt as though they were shattering all at once. The pain was blinding, flashing stars in her vision, her brain on overload. She choked on her breath, her entire body stopping.
"I don't want her to know I'm getting in a duel with Malfoy later just because of some crap he said about her. I don't want to seem like an overprotective tosser, you know?" Harry nodded.
I was looking at it, something felt rather peculiar, since it didn’t have an author or anything, or really much on the back cover of the book or the spine. But I could
"Oh for GOD'S SAKE, don't get your knickers in a twist," Blaise yelled back, "You should have TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE!" In a slightly gentler tone, he added, "Draco we don't care if you're gay or whatever, don't you understand that you're our friend and none of us give a shite?"
Draco shifted in the bed uncomfortably as he thought of their trial at the Ministry. The way the Wizengamot stared at them behind plum robes, some with hatred, but most disturbingly, some with respect. He and his mother had been let off the hook with fairly light charges, the confiscation of wands for a short couple of months, and the limited wand use for some time after, but his father wasn’t so lucky. Having been witnessed participating in several dark acts, his father was sentenced to home confinement by magic. He couldn’t leave the premises of the Malfoy property, and personally, Draco didn’t think even his father deserved that light of a punishment. He might have defected to save his own son, but he’d done unspeakable things that he needed to pay for.
“Come on, Theodore, just up these stairs,” She turned and smiled at Theodore, who was looking a bit worse for wear and frightened. He nodded quietly, and followed her up each step, the silence of their surroundings broken by the peskily squeaky stairs. The hallway was dim in the night, even more so than usual.
“Theodore! What brings you here?” Luna shivered at her own words from the past, internally quaking with anger and fear.
But that train of thought was cut off by a sudden searing burst of pain is his right calf as the wall
Originally, Ginny had been angry that Harry had followed them, but that was swept away by a towering tsunami of laughter at his extreme confusion regarding where they went. He really could act quite stupid sometimes. Toying absentmindedly with the butterbeer cork necklace strung delicately on her neck, her perky ears picked up the sounds of a rather dumbstruck and frustrated Ron yelling to...nothingness it seemed? Her curiosity took over, her feet automatically turning in the direction of where Ron sounded to be.
Did she really think that he was interested in her? By the looks of how she was batting her stubby eyelashes, yes, it did seem that she had the completely outlandish idea that he fancied her. How did he even put up with her for that many years? Between her and the Weasel, he wasn't completely sure of how he hadn't just taken an Avada Kedavra to himself yet.
"Well you know what? I DO challenge you to a duel. I'll see you in an hour at the room of requirement, wanker. Bring a second," Ron confirmed, sounding much more cocky than he felt. His stomach twisted into a knot of dread.
Again, I'm sorry the chapters are taking so long to go up, I apologize for the amount of time between each. I've got a lot going on for me. I hope you enjoy this one!
A sharp jab on his left shoulder brought him from his thoughts, and he looked down to see Ginny, the culprit, staring up at him expectantly.
“If you really think that, maybe you should go find him. It’s been a little while since dinner and he still hasn’t shown up.”
Ever since Ron had seen Harry and Luna with Theodore, he’d been a complete bugger. He had an unhealthy prejudice against all Slytherins, and his immaturity caused far too many quarrels and hexes that could have easily been avoided in the first place. He’d gone absolutely mad when he realized that Hermione, too, had begun hanging around with Theodore. In fact, she even considered herself Theodore’s friend. His lively spirits, sassiness, and good humor always lightened the mood. And then Ron would come and drench it all in rotting sewer water.
"Alright so I'm guessing since you spent so much time getting in you know how to get out...?" He trailed off as she shook her head.
"OH GOD HARRY I'M SUCH A NUTTER AND I NEED YOU TO SECOND ME IN A DUEL THAT I'VE GOT WITH MALFOY IN A HALF HOUR," Ron panted as he ran up behind Harry, "I've been looking all over for you why are you staring at an empty wall I need you help come the hell on hurry up we need to scram right now!"
He turned his head abruptly back to Theo when Potter turned around, catching him staring at the back of his curly black head, and tossing him a cold glare. Great. Now that the tosser had seen Draco staring at them, he was never going to hear the end of it. Breaking the scowl, Potter tightened his arm around his girlfriend's shoulder and turned back to his group of misfits. He scanned the area around them, noticing Longbottom, Lovegood (wasn't she in Ravenclaw?), and a yacking Seamus Finnegan, who was gesturing his arms in a way that suggested he was telling a battle story.
"Bloody hell!!! What in the name of Godric's hairy arse was THAT?!" Harry exclaimed as they collapsed in a previously determined safe corner.
But the rumor mill of Hogwarts worked like fiendfyre, spreading from person to person in a matter of hours, each of them stupidly believing whatever shite they were told.
“Of all the things in the world, you say that- what’s that supposed to mean?” Malfoy waved his arms in emphasis, then quickly went back to shielding his beet red face.
This is the second half of the previous chapter. I apologize, but I'll be unable to post a complete chapter before Christmas, so I hope this one satisfies for a few days. Happy Holidays, everyone! I hope you can still be happy this time of year, with everything that's going on. Anyways, here it is.
I hope you enjoy this chapter, it's definitely longer than the last! I've had a really rough past few weeks, so I might not post a chapter next week, and if I do, it'll be a few days late. I'm guilty of overworking myself and not sleeping (ooooops). Anyways, please enjoy this one, and next week there may or may not be one.
“It’s much less...shrieky than I assumed. No shrieking at all, really. I remember how scared me and my friends used to be of this place. Draco would’ve ran to hell and back just to keep his arse out of here.”
Would you look at that...a sight Harry never, not once in his lifetime, thought he would ever see. He could have sworn he saw Malfoy watching them with what seemed to be jealousy. He stole another quick glance in Malfoy's general direction, to find (thankfully) that he had looked away and had turned his complete attention to snarling at that Parkinson girl. Harry almost felt bad for her, then completely revoked that thought. Even before the war, he'd never been friendly with her, and her stance in the fighting certainly didn't do any wonders with that.
Draco thought himself to be the most dimwitted and naive wizard in the history of time. Even more so than his muggle counterparts. This was all Draco could think of as he lay staring at the dimly lit curtains of his four poster bed. He groaned and rolled onto his stomach, burying his face in his dark emerald clad pillow, and recounted the events of that night against his will, his brain playing them over and over and over.
“Alright, alright,” Ginny waved her hand dismissively and climbed out of the portrait hole, stepping foot into the cold, abandoned corridor. Her steps echoed around the stone walls, the soles of her shoes clicking against the floor.
“We’ll get back at him, you know? We’ll get back at him good.” Hermione mumbled into her ear, still embracing her tightly after over fifteen minutes.
It is I, elusive_lagume. For the past month or so, I've been dealing with a lot of pressure, stress, and internal negativity coming from many different places and have been struggling with my mental health. Usually writing makes me feel a lot better, but it's difficult for me to churn out more than a sentence right now. My motivation this month has just completely dropped. I'll be back around March 9th, so about two weeks time. Thank you for reading and hopefully understanding. I am really really sorry.
Harry had spoken to her earlier that evening, telling her she needed to confront Ron about his behavior of late, and ask him to explain what was going on. He knew, of course, but they’d kept her in the dark. Like usual.
“Make sure he’s alright, Ginny, ok? And tell me what happens. You’d better or else I’ll come hunt you down in the dead of night and force it out of your throat.”
Harry froze in place, the shock and adrenaline rooting him to the spot, not even offering him the choice of movement.
This thought was rather disturbing and he let out a small snort of disbelief. Why in hell would he be jealous of Theo? What did Theo have that he didn’t? Immediately the answers to his thoughts bubbled up inside his head.
That didn’t go down well with his family, and it seemed that they were even more set on getting the two together after that encounter.
conclusions. Of course you're here looking for your muggleborn girlfriend. I'll never understand why a person with her level of intelligence would stoop so low as to be with you. I mean, you're about as smart as, well, nothing, you have the temper of a badger with its coat on fire, and that hair really just doesn't suit you. I mean I would never take an interest in you, if I were her, it's just such a complete waste." Ron felt his face reddening at the Hermione comment. He was thoroughly pissed. But Malfoy didn't stop there.
” Harry shouted over the wind, his voice climbing. He huffed his breaths in and out, Malfoy’s eyes on him still. Harry fought to control his emotions, which were bubbling up in massive waves, slamming him over and over.
OK here's the latest chapter! So I'm very sorry that I skipped last week, it was a kind of rough week, and I had a lot of work (school and LIFE argh argh). But I'm back! Woohoo! I hope you enjoy this chapter!
He turned swiftly, and headed back to the Slytherin dorms, filled with an unidentifiable anger that burned inside him, boiling his blood, and lacing his vision with red.
Harry looked up at the other boy, his heart doing somersaults and beating in his chest with the force of a sledgehammer being wielded by a mountain troll. Even in the dim light, he could see Malfoy’s face flushing a bit, even though the entire lower half of it was hidden by one hand as he turned a bit to hide it.
. But the thing is, each one of those words was hidden inside a letter of the title, and the writing was
But when the actual truth came out, everyone thought it was fake. How strange these people were to believe the argument he’d had with Blaise was a hoax.
to have such study habits as her. But she seemed perfectly content with learning, and he wondered often why she hadn't been a Ravenclaw.
I promised him I'd help him with his-" Harry paused, "-issue. He's going to have my head when he sees me again, and YOU CAME HERE WITHOUT FIGURING IT OUT FIRST?" he belted, a look of exasperation on his face.
But until he knew what exactly he was going to do with himself, Draco would let them believe whatever the hell they wanted.
Luna grimaced and clutched the deep cut on her right forearm, whispering healing spells quickly to mend the gash in Harry's calf, then doing the same for herself. "Well," she began, "The wall threw knives at us. I suggest we don't touch it anymore. That seems the most logical thing to do."
“Yeah,” Ginny rubbed her eyes tiredly, “Yeah, I do. I should be supporting him when he needs help, not pushing him further away.”
A special thanks to my Elderly Friend, Tailspin, for editing this for me! I couldn't have done it without your help, you crazybeanhead. *grins maniacally revealing sharp, bloody, vampiresque teeth* I hope you enjoyed this chapter! The next one will be up within the week. :D
"Leave him alone, Malfoy," warned Potter, whose messy head popped up suddenly from behind Weasley. "In case you haven't noticed, you aren't really all that
Luna towed her companion along, stepping daintily over the roots and bugs and such that littered the ground beneath her sneaker clad feet. She inhaled the cool scent of earth as they reached the stairs to the Shrieking Shack, the steps as dusty and dank as usual.
Her gut twisted uncontrollably, the memory she’d squashed down only dragging her deeper into her prison.
So one hour later from that slightly infuriating interaction, Luna was lying on the floor next to the wall and thinking. If Harry had merely bumped into the wall without even trying to enter, maybe she had to find a way to make herself to just pass through the wall by taking her mind off the wall. She leaned up against the wall, tucked her legs into a criss cross position, brought out the latest edition of the newly remade Quibbler, and began to read.
The bizarre encounter between Malfoy and Zabini never really left the back of Harry's head. Not that day, not that week, not even that month. He wasn't against who Malfoy was, he was just...really surprised. All of their years at Hogwarts, it'd been rumored that Malfoy was such a ladies man, always with a different girl. And Harry had, though he felt shame for it now, believed those rumors.
Ron was the first out the door of their crowded compartment, only looking up from his snacks when he ran into the one and only person they'd all been planning on avoiding that year. Draco Malfoy.
and Hermione was absolutely fed up. She realized she was practically huffing in rage at the book in her lap, and quickly looked up to make sure nobody had seen. When the coast was confirmed clear, she got back to her angry thoughts.
“So I wrote them down- in much larger writing- on a piece of parchment and looked at them some more. It sounded like Latin when I read it to myself, but it wasn’t any Latin words I knew. So I found a book on Latin in the library-isn’t it so cool how the library has everything- so I was looking and reading and such and I realized they weren’t words at all. Well, they were words, just a bit mixed up. They were scrambled up words, like those games muggles play. Just in a much smaller font and harder to decipher. So after about two hours or so, I finally came up with a sentence that made sense and used all the letters from each of the words. ‘
"LuNa! Get away from this wall!" He bellowed, just as he heard a small shriek coming from her direction, cutting through his words mid sentence. He bolted away to their previous position to the left away from that particular wall and grabbed Luna's arm mid sprint, dragging her along.
“The name’s helpful though, because now you can tell me all about the book without having to obliviate anyone!”
"Should we wake her?" Hermione inquired, sounding rather concerned for her friend, as the look on Ginny's face contorted into a half scowl-have sob.
He shifted his line of vision to the two people seated directly in front of the pair. Weaselette and Potter. Was it possible that there was an even more
Harry looked down at the rather intimidating plant below and began to try to unwind it's death-tight grip from a few of his gloved fingers on his left hand, eventually having to use a severing charm on the ravenous vines. He groaned as another two wound their way around his other hand. After glancing up at Professor Sprout and seeing the rather disappointed look on her face as another two vines joined the few on his hand, he groaned again.
With nothing but the sound of an occasional shuffling or snuffling and the bubbles outside their dorm windows that look straight into the lake, the quiet allowed him to hear his thoughts even louder. They filled the silence, overwhelming all else, akin to spilt ink on a blank piece of parchment.
Some time later, Luna thought she had dozed off at the familiar sensation of falling out of sleep, jolting her to her senses. It took her several moments to realize she was actually falling through darkness, and gave out a small squeak of surprise as she collided with a soft, warm, lump that let out an "OergOfh" as she landed. The soft warm lump suddenly scrambled up with a frightened yelp and lit a bright lumos.
He thought of bringing up Malfoy's argument with Zabini, but it seemed like that might only make matters worse, so instead he warned in a voice as loud as the library allowed, "Don't you dare call Hermione that name, just SOD OFF, you tosser. I would get the hell out of here if I were you, or I might just hav-" Malfoy interrupted him mid sentence.
If you have any questions about the storyline or anything, just comment, and I'll respond asap! Happy Holidays!
Luna Lovegood had been abandoned in an empty hallway precisely two hours prior. She rarely felt embitterment towards situations like this, being such a patient and gentle person, but time was flying by and she had no clue how to get Harry from the clutches of the wall.
To make matters worse, about an hour after Ron ran away in a fit, he returned, his frustration replaced by a full blown hissy fit. She knew it was him as soon as she heard the mile long string of profanities coming from the hall; he could be so irritable. Without even saying hi, he only demanded to know if she'd figured out how to get Harry back. When she responded with no, he lost it, and completely went off. Trying her hardest to keep calm, she asked what had him worked up so terribly. He yelled at her to mind her own business and stormed away, not even bothering to offer help with the Harry situation.
Suddenly the ground shook beneath her feet, throwing her off balance. She landed on her bottom with a thud, gripping onto a root to steady herself.
"He did seem a bit worked up, but he'll come to his senses, and yes, I was curious and you needed help, so let's begin picking this place apart, shall we?" It wasn't a question, it was a command, and from the rarely seen impatient glint in her eyes, she really wanted to begin.  Harry nodded, and they began their empty journey to the way out.
Luna watched helplessly as her body turned, her mother now directly in front of her. How Pandora’s mouth opened to cast the spell, how she thrust her wand in front of her, the passion on her face so beautiful, so strong.
Doesn’t that sound super creepy? But totally appropriate for the kind of shite this book deals with. So I think if we say that and do some sort of wand motion the book might...open? I’m realizing it’s not a lot to go off of, sorr-”
Ron stabbed angrily at his chicken with a knife, turning it from perfect, crispy golden brown to a mushy vomitesque lump in a matter of seconds. He'd already been in a bad mood from his earlier Transfiguration excursion, where he was supposed to turn a common pebble into an earthworm, instead turning it into a mincemeat pie. He swore he had no idea how that happened...it just did.
Ginny got up from the table and motioned for Luna to follow her. They looked pretty dodgy, and if they wanted to sneak away from dinner, they could have at least tried to look like they had a purpose that wasn't mischief involved.
“RELASHIO!” The vines held tight on Malfoy’s frame, the descent into the earth quickening, Harry’s spells not making a dent in the fight.
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry said quietly as he sat down so as not to disrupt Hermione and Weasley’s bickering. “I haven’t seen you around much this year.”
The Great Hall was silent enough to hear a pin drop as that same feisty owl swooped down to land on Harry’s head. Draco had planned to get a different owl every day to hide his tracks, but after seeing how well Harry took to the little menace, well, he couldn’t choose any other. Especially not after Harry had affectionately named the owl Salazar.
The patterns in the wood of the table were suddenly very interesting, but Draco knew trying to withhold answers would only provoke her, and, well, maybe it would be easier to spend time with Harry if Hermione liked him. “Fourth year. He was getting so much crap for being in the Triwizard Tournament when I knew it wasn’t his fault, because I heard my father talking about it. And I just…he didn’t deserve it, and I could tell it was tearing him up, and I just wanted to go up to him and give him a hug. That’s when I realized. It was downright terrifying.”
By this point, Weasley’s face was purple with anger, and it was all Granger could do to keep him from launching himself and his food across the room in a fit of rage. But that wasn’t what Draco was interested in—no, he was far more interested in Harry’s reaction. That was the true test.
, he added in his head. There was no way it could be him, after all, and Draco knew it. He was setting Harry up for disappointment.
And sure enough, Weasley grimaced but stomped his way over and sat down between Hermione and Draco. Which, of course, left the only spot for Harry right next to Draco. Dear Merlin, this would not be good for his heart.
As he was learning, though, causing a stir without being the center of attention was just as fulfilling, if not more so. To be honest, Draco was tired of putting on a show for whoever was watching, acting like he was expected to instead of how he wanted to. It was bloody annoying in the best of times, exhausting and dehumanizing at the worst. But this latest scheme of his—now, that was the real him. Draco took great satisfaction in ignoring his father’s voice in his head that told him things like
“We’re all glad you promised we could stay, Harry, don’t get me wrong. But it was never about us. It never was about the house either—your magical core was closed off, love. It’s not that you couldn’t bond with the house, it’s that the house couldn’t bond with you.”
“No, Ron, that’s not it.” Hermione’s voice is tense. Shrill. I can tell she’s about to break. “It’s not ‘threats’. That’s not even remotely the problem.”
You’re sat on the floor of your office late on a Tuesday night after everyone’s already gone home, and you’ve already drunk half a bottle of fire whiskey in a desperate attempt to forget your own name, when you see Malfoy again. You don’t know why he peers through your half-open door. You don’t even ask.
There is no sympathy in Iris’ voice, but it is not unkind. She sounds like she’s caught an unruly child or an over-eager dog doing something abominably stupid, and she’s trying to understand how on earth they ever thought that idea was going to work.
In a lot of ways, it stuck needles through Harry’s lungs and turned heart to dust, but there were also the good bits. There was the way Draco looked at Harry right after they kissed sometimes, with a reverent sort of wonder. The way Draco would trail his fingers along Harry’s chest and whisper in his ear that
He’s put his beer down in favour of a quill and a parchment and is taking notes. I can’t remember him ever being so keen on writing stuff down before. Has to be Hermione’s influence, I think and it makes me smile. They deserve each other, they really do.
My body springs into action of its own volition and I chase after him. “Kiss me, you coward,” I yell, startling a small herd of old ladies on a guided tour. It does not make him stop and by the time I make it into room 41, I have to admit I’ve lost all trace of him.
Soft wind blows through Harry’s hair, and waves crash all around him, and still, he walks. His face is wet and salt seeps into his mouth as the sea spray kisses his skin (as tears escape from the dam that has been building across his throat ever since he set foot on the island, earlier still, since he took a portkey to Romania, perhaps. Ever since he ran and never looked back.)
You have to understand her, reader. She’s stepped through flames three separate times in less than one week to do her job. She’s sacrificed two pairs of robes, one pair of shoes and half a head of hair to this disaster of an architectural nightmare, and she just needs a couple of signatures. She just needs a couple of eyewitness accounts before she can be on her way, but she can’t even get that, can she? She can’t even ask for the idiots who keep blowing things up every other day to comply with her reasonable professional requests as she cleans their messes up for them. She can’t even ask them to look at her, and—oh Merlin, are they moaning?
“I can’t live like this, I can’t,” you’d sobbed into the skin of your wrist while a violent wave of nausea wracked your body, making it convulse and shake. “I can’t live without him. I love him, fuck, I love him. I’m fucking gay, and I’m fucking in love, and I can’t go on pretending I’m not.” Your voice grew louder and louder with each word, and you couldn’t bring yourself to care because you needed to tell someone, anyone, about everything you were going through. And suddenly, you weren’t going to be fine at all. Suddenly, none of it mattered any more: all your fear and carefully crafted protection from the world, the press headlines and the interminable interviews, the inevitable hate letters pouring from every window and the word “gay” branded upon your forehead. Suddenly, all that mattered was how sad and defeated Draco had seemed the last time you saw him, how he’d seemed to want you to admit you were gay, to want you to stay or go after him or show him it mattered, what you did together.
“I don’t know if that says anything about me, though. I guess… I guess we’re both a bit broken. But… do you think we can build something from this if we’re willing to work on it?”
“Can you talk me through what you remember?” I ask because her story resonates strangely inside my chest; because every single one of her words awakes something behind my ribs, something terrible and ancient that I didn’t even know was there before it started to stir, and I need to know more.
“What other choice did they have?” As the words left Harry’s mouth, he knew with unbearable certainty the topic would lead to another screaming match. It always did. “It’s not like they wanted me to get hurt or killed, it was just a choice between me and the rest of the world, really. My life wasn’t worth everyone else’s.”
“He’ll see you now,” she says and motions for me to follow her. “I didn’t mean to be so curt with you,” she continues as we walk, “but we’ve had bad experiences in the past, not everyone’s keen on having a werewolf clinic down their street. Especially after the war... We like to be careful.”
There is an instant of blinding brightness, and Harry feels like he’s grown another pair of lungs suddenly. He can feel the house breathe underneath his skin. He can feel the loneliness of it, the slow decay—and the hope for a better future too, shining warm and bright behind his ribs.
There’s no emotion in his words. No warmth, no surprise. They’re careful. Measured. Indifferent. Everything inside your chest turns to stone, heavy and cold.
Just as I’m about to give up, I realise that whoever is on the other side of this, whoever is writing on my skin—they know what this spell does. They also knew what I wrote to Hermione earlier, and I’m almost certain that whatever I write shows up on their skin.
You’re hurt and afraid and it doesn’t matter because life is giving you a chance at being your broken, half-healed self with the man you love by your side, and you want it more than you’ve ever wanted anything in the world.
In my veins, my blood turns cold with the unbearable certitude that everything is so much worse than I thought.
I’d kiss you back. Oh, if you had any idea of how badly I want to kiss you. How I’ve wanted to kiss you for days.
You’re the only person I’ve ever been this in love with. You’re the only person I’ve ever bared my entire soul to. You’re the only person I can imagine myself with.
“And you know that because you were there, weren’t you?” that little piece of Harry answered. “Funny, I thought you were hiding away at the Manor between your blood purist parents until things went to shit and you had to grow a spine and a heart. These people, Draco, these people you’re talking about—they loved me. Dumbledore was the closest thing to a father I ever had, and he wouldn’t have sent me to my death if there had been any other way. He died for this too, remember? You were there. Should I refresh your memory? You almost killed him. Did you look for any other choices before you went up those stairs with a wand in your hand to kill an unsuspecting old man?”
She stops pacing and turns towards me. Fear and anger paint her face in equal measure. She looks me straight in the eye and unbuckles her belt.
He could run, Harry could. He could still run, now. He could avoid rejection, avoid confrontation. He could go home to his hotel, to his empty house at the foot of the alps. He could never go home at all, could take a Portkey again, move to the desert and the forest and the arctic ocean and try to lose himself entirely there, try to forget his name and his face and spend an entire life trying not to be alive at all. It wouldn’t be good, but it would be safe, oh it would be safe and it would be familiar, and—Harry would be lying if he said he wasn’t thinking about it at all, because the vulnerability is cracking his chest open like a crayfish, and it is unbearable, it is—
“It’s your choice, Harry,” he tells you when you’ve finished talking, “It’s your private life  and no one gets to decide what you want to do with it but you.”
The words ring hollow, and you regret them the moment they spill from your tongue, but you’re a statue of pining and grief, and the sea of him keeps eroding at everything you are. You’ve given up  everything already, you’ve placed your heart and your life and any tiny chance at happiness you ever had on the altar of this impossible love, you’ve taken every single scrap of feeling that could fit inside you, and you’ve laid it at his feet, and—you’re empty now. Empty and hollow and broken, and all that’s left of you is the golden shell, the medals and the dress robes, the newspaper headlines and the gala invitations. You can’t let him take those too, because who would you be then?
He sighs, tired and weary. “But Draco was my friend,” he adds in a soft voice. “I miss him more than I can say.”
They make love, slow and gentle on the forest floor. The trees above them lay out blankets of gold leaves below their backs and the fog wraps them in thick, warm air. Close by, the lake stretches its sparkle-green water, and echoes their cries and moans, too. And for a while, it is perfect. But it cannot last, for pleasure builds in Harry’s chest like a pharaoh’s snake—growing, burning, twisting and turning and filling up every single inch of it, until Harry is entirely certain there is no space left in his body at all that is not filled to the brim with love and light and the unbearable feeling of Draco’s hands on him.
“Stay,” Harry says again, taking Draco’s wrist in his hands and holding them as gently as if they are a fragile heirloom or an injured bird. “Stay—please, Draco. Please. I’ll be better. I promise I will. I’ll change. I’ve changed already. Stay, Draco. Stay for me. Please. We’ll make it work this time, I promise.”
Harry silently sits down next to Draco. Clouds shift and the warm light of sunset floods the room, the sharp lines of mountains cutting through the stream of light like dark knives. The sight of it paints awe all over Draco’s face, his eyes gleaming burn-gold with the warm light as he stares through the window at the scenery.
I pause for a while. I can’t think of anything to ask him that won’t give his identity away, but I don’t want to waste a precious question either. Then, I ask:
Because here’s the thing about you: your body’s filled to the brim with the mindless routine of all the days you rolled your tired body out of bed, numb and exhausted and animated only by your sense of duty. And you’ve been so busy crafting this careful identity for yourself that you can’t quite remember you really are. You don’t know who Harry is when he’s not the hero and not the Auror, not the golden boy and not the protector. You can’t believe it’s never bothered you before.
“Harry,” he says in a strangled voice, and the sound of it fills Harry’s lungs with dry straw and cotton wool.
“Din översättningsformel måste vara den värsta jag har sett, under alla år som jag har jobbat här,” he says as he casually takes a wand out from under the counter.
Fortunately for you, you can’t think clearly, because Draco is still fucking himself on your cock, still making sinful noises as he pleasures himself with your body, still moving in all the ways that make you writhe and moan and beg, so all you can think about is that fuck, he feels good, and fuck, he’s gorgeous. You complain about the ropes tying you down. You beg him to make you come. He sucks at your earlobe, and he pins your wrists down with his soft, warm hands, infuriating and wonderful.
(It can’t be over. It can never be over. Harry needs this moment to last forever like he needs water or oxygen.)
What does it have to do with Jemima Graves and the Unthinkable Affront, you ask? Hush, dear reader. We are getting to it.
You don't expect Draco to come back, you realise. And it might have broken you at any other point in time, but you've just talked about who you really are for the first time in your entire life, and hundreds of people listened, and Lee shook your hand and thanked you, and the world didn't end, and you can't let it matter.
“I love you,” Draco pants against Harry’s mouth. “I’ve always loved you. I’ve never stopped. I wouldn’t know where to start if I tried.”
Yes. Today. Four O’Clock? Somewhere public but not too crowded. British Museum? In front of the Battersea Shield?
He’s over Draco, he has been for years. Draco stole his breath and broke his heart and left him alone to painfully puzzle all the pieces back together, but he’s grown since then. He’s mended his heart, and he’s forgiven Draco, and he was going to be okay—being in the same house as him, working under the same roof. Working. It’s just that, it’s just working. Just this once, Draco said. Just this once and never again.
“Sorry, I er… I didn’t mean to spend the night,” you add, because your brain and your mouth are apparently not connected.
Investigated the parchment. It is full of words. Strongly dislike those. Nibbled the corner. Did not taste as good as fudge. Lost interest and dug up five carrots from the vegetable patch instead. Boring day. Would like another treat.
And he’s right. Of course, he’s right. He’s gay, isn’t he? He’s out about it, too. Of course, that’s what it looked like to him. Of course. And what can you say? You can’t tell him you love him so much you can’t breathe sometimes. You can’t tell him about the tidal waves of feelings and how you think you’ll burst with them. There’s your heart at his feet, beating and bloody, ripped straight from your chest, and you can’t tell him about that either, so you settle for not saying anything at all.
When the journalist shows up, you’re tired and depressed and the side of your neck has turned an upsetting shade of purple. You’re ready to go home, roll yourself into bed and have a good cry about everything. You’re doing a pretty good job of ignoring him and his pointless pleading for an interview, until he opens his mouth and says:
One man reaches out to the other, with bright smiles and loud words, and the other recoils for fear he’ll break apart entirely. And then, there’s only one man in that street, alone in the soft heat of an early summer evening with a smile that feels like a knife gash across his face. And all the while, Jemima Graves writes her report and thinks about the charred holes in her robes and doesn’t notice anything at all.
When Harry thanks her and shakes her hand, Mrs Malfoy’s cheeks are perfectly dry and her face perfectly composed, but when she smiles at him, there is an ocean of sadness and regret dancing across the tight line of her lips.
Harry hasn’t bought a house. He’s bought an abandoned sanatorium at the foot of a Swiss mountain. An abandoned sanatorium that’s both magical in nature and steadfastly refusing to bond with Harry.
I need to warn you about one thing. I’m sorry I haven’t told you before. There is a distinct possibility you know me. Please remember the person you’ve come to know through our conversation. Please.
Harry Potter was spotted last weekend at ex-girlfriend Ginevra Weasley’s wedding. As Ms Weasley, seeker for the Holyhead Harpies, tied the knot with her girlfriend and owner of highly fashionable sportswear line
You find yourself on Draco’s doorstep a week later. You have no idea if he’s going to open the door and you have no idea how he’s going to react. You haven’t thought about it. About any of it, if you’re honest.
“I’d say so. Have you any idea how impolite it is to just disappear after you’ve come, without even offering some release to your partner?”
He tosses and he turns for several hours before he gives up and gets up and gets dressed. Then, he sits at the desk. Stands up. Paces around the room. Runs his hand through his hair. Sits again. There is a hole in the middle of his chest, shaped like Draco, and the anticipation is turning his blood into ants (running in his veins and burrowing chambers into his lungs.) He decides he might as well walk to the lighthouse
I am a terrible liar. Aaron adds a crimson powder into his cauldron, carefully stirring it in with slow clockwise motions. I feel the mood in the room shift.
In time, the owls stopped coming. It was only natural: people moved on from the war (buried it in the garden and planted hellebores to mark the grave and went back to their lives.)
He never saw you on Draco’s doorstep, he saw you with your fucking colleague and thought there was a story in your early morning coffees and casual chats. You want to tell him there’s nothing here, you want to tell him Nicholas has been disgustingly in love with Orion for as long as you have known him, that they’re planning a future together and they’re picking paint colours for the nursery. But then—then, he’ll ask you about your love life and you’ll have to tell him about Malfoy—and what if Malfoy doesn’t want to be in the paper? What if it disrupts his private life?
never fell from my lips—but I lost you in the process and when I lost you, Draco? When I lost you, the entire world went grey and I lived every day like I’d been wrapped in gauze or smothered in fog. When I lost you, I became a ghost or an empty shell, and life isn’t worth living like this. Life isn’t worth living without you.”
“I don’t even remember leaving her,” Pansy whispers with shiny, round tears rolling down her cheeks, “I loved her so much, and I don’t even remember leaving her, and when I woke up I was going to marry that idiot Bletchley.”
I come back with a large book in my arms. On its cover, the words “Magic in the Middle Ages” glimmer in gold lettering. That night, after I’ve fed the animals and done all of my chores, I sit on the sofa and start reading.
He stormed out instead, slamming the door behind him. He made it all the way to his flat before panic took him apart. As he lay on the rug, with tears in his eyes and trying to remember how to breathe, he vowed never to have another anxiety attack in front of Draco.
Him and you—it just works, you decide. You’re not gay, of course, but you’re still single. There’s no harm in having a good fuck once in a while. Some of your friends do it. It doesn’t have to mean anything. No one else ever has to know.
“No, don’t be sorry,” said Harry, squeezing him harder. Draco was suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of Harry’s scent, and Merlin, that made it hard to think. His mind was going in circles, still unable to fully comprehend what was going on. “I’m so glad it was you.”
The abnormally hushed chatter in the Great Hall came to a complete standstill as an owl swooped down to perch himself primly on Harry’s head. Draco had chosen that owl from the school Owlery because he thought the little furry thing’s fiery personality would amuse Harry, and indeed, Harry chuckled at the new presence resting among his mop of hair.
“Fine, then.” He glanced around warily. “Can you do something to stop the staring, though? I’d rather not talk when every single person in the room is trying to listen in. I may not have many things to hide anymore, but if this gets out, I’m done for.”
Hermione let out a fascinated hum and pulled a notebook from her bag to scribble some notes. “You’re right, I was making it too complicated. Still, that’s brilliant, being able to adapt such an obvious charm like that. I never would’ve thought of that. How many different layers are there?”
Draco stared at her hand in awe. This was definitely not how he had expected this conversation to end. “I—are you sure?”
Draco didn’t quite know what to say when Granger—Hemione, now—sat herself down beside him in the eighth-year common room. It just simply wasn’t done—nobody acknowledged his presence, and certainly not the Golden Trio. But here she was, poking his shoulder and demanding in a quiet whisper that Draco tell her how he’d spelled the Howlers. Needless to say, it drew quite a few stares.
was horrible to you.” Draco met Harry’s gaze and suddenly couldn’t help the tears swimming in his eyes. There was regret, so much regret. It was easier to push down when Harry wasn’t acknowledging him, but now that he was right here and staring into Draco’s eyes, he couldn’t take it anymore. Fuck, Draco hated his mood swings. They made him feel like an idiot. “I’m so sorry.”
“Um, mate? Are you okay?” Weasley ventured in his typical blunt fashion. Draco wasn’t at all surprised. “Hit your head too hard this morning or something?”
An involuntary scoff escaped Draco’s lips. “As if. He needs me about as much as he needs a Bludger to the face.”
A thrilling tingle of anticipation shot through Draco’s body, beginning at his head and rushing down through his toes. It was finally time to put his weeks of research and experimentation to the test, to see whether or not his spellwork would hold. Merlin, he hoped it would work. It would be enough to put a smile on his face for the rest of the year. Even if he wouldn’t let anyone see it.
Hermione had sent Draco a sorrowful glance when Harry repeated the contents of the message aloud, but Draco just looked away. He didn’t deserve her pity for this; he had gotten himself into this deplorable situation all on his own, and he deserved whatever suffering that brought him.
By the next morning, the mystery of Harry’s strange Howler had spread throughout the school, and nearly every student had been in the Great Hall since the beginning of breakfast in the hope of seeing another Howler arrive.
“I don’t get it at all,” Harry said glumly, which did not surprise Draco in the least. Both he and Weasley had always been oblivious to a fault. They wouldn’t recognize the truth unless it was written out in front of them in colorful, blinking letters. And even then, Draco thought, a wryly amused smirk on his face, they’d still find some way to deny it. Not when the truth was him.
Draco whimpered, for it really had been years since he’d been held like he mattered. Nobody he knew was open in their affections, not like the Weasleys, he supposed, who were constantly invading each other’s personal space with hugs and pats and shoulder bumps. Draco used to scoff at displays of affection of any sort, really, but it was more out of jealousy than a true derision for physical contact. Because who was he kidding? He’d wanted to be wrapped up in Harry’s arms like this for years now. Or the arms of anyone who cared about him, really. But there weren’t exactly many people lining up.
In the back of his head, Draco knew that the entire student body, not to mention all the staff, were currently watching their exchange. But he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when Harry was finally this close to him. “Four years,” Draco croaked, blinking rapidly to keep his tears in check. “I’ve loved you for four years, Harry. Don’t call me an idiot.”
Draco had made a point of trying to avoid Harry outside of classes and meals as much as possible. There was only so much yearning and wanting his heart could take before it got too painful to bear, before it wasn’t worth the happiness Draco got from seeing him. Being near him in the common room as well was simply too much, so Draco stood up to leave. But apparently Hermione had other ideas and tugged him sharply back down.
Draco was frozen in his seat as Harry stood and crossed the room. This was not how this was supposed to go at all. Harry was supposed to be the oblivious and thick-headed Gryffindor he’s always been, not actually figure out that Draco was the one behind all the messages. Merlin help him.
Weasley cackled delightedly. “Merlin, someone’s flirting game is top notch today.” He scanned the room. “I know everyone is listening, so if you’re the one sending these messages, send a hint in your next letter, will you? Or at least tell how you did the spellwork, I’m sure George would love to get his hands on this. Whatever it is, it’s bloody brilliant!”
Hermione’s stern demeanor softened, and Draco watched with heart in his throat. After a torturous silence, Hermione finally nodded, her eyes flicking to Draco. “Yes.”
Draco scoffed again, but both his heart and his mind were racing with thoughts of Harry. “If you say so.”
“Shh,” Harry chided, shifting so he could pull Draco flush against his chest. “Just stay here for a bit, okay? It’ll be okay, I promise.”
Harry’s sharp intake of breath was audible, even with the shelves between them muffling the sound. “Who?”
?” Draco heard Weasley call. He glanced over to his left to see Harry and Weasley clambering through the entrance to the common room, and his breath caught. He didn’t know where Harry and Weasley had just come from, though based on several tiny little braids in Harry’s hair, they were probably with Luna, and it was so adorable it made Draco want to cry.
“She had some theories about the spellwork on your mystery Howlers that she wanted to run by me.” He risked a glance up at Harry’s face. “You don’t have any ideas who it is, do you?”
“Well,” Draco said, ignoring the lump in his throat, “I hope it really is who you want it to be. I think that’d be really sweet.”
There was a warm hand under his chin, and suddenly Draco was no longer looking down at the table, but rather up into Harry’s searching eyes. His eyes were alight with something, but Draco didn’t think it was anger. Still, he couldn’t help but flinch at the intensity of Harry’s gaze.
Harry was, needless to say, happy to oblige. And Draco thought he might just come to like Weasley after all.
“It’s okay. Well, not really, but I forgive you. I know you were under a lot of pressure, Draco. And please, call me Hermione. But we’ve wandered off topic again. How long?”
Draco just threw his head back and laughed, then fixed an expectant gaze on Harry. “So, are you going to kiss me, or am I going to be left waiting?”
And sure enough, the voice that rang out across the room was extraordinarily normal, impossible to place. “Harry Potter!” the voice screeched. “You are the biggest git I have ever met! I can’t believe the audacity…”
“Is that really what you want to know?” Draco asked critically. “Out of all the things, that’s the most important?”
And Merlin, it felt amazing. Harry’s arms were warm and solid around his torso, and Draco felt as though he was wrapped in a bubble of protection and comfort. Not to mention Harry’s body heat was through the roof, and just being near him felt like the pleasant warmth of a Warming Charm. Draco took a deep breath and tried to memorize the feeling of being held like this, held by
That was another thing. Draco had long envied Weasley and Granger for their ability to support Harry, not that he’d admit it to another living soul. But around the same time that Draco began to feel guilty for being such a prat, he had realized
“What were you talking about with Hermione when Ron and I came in?” Harry mumbled, sending a puff of air onto the skin of Draco’s neck and making him shiver. But Draco was pleased, far too pleased really, that Harry hadn’t made to shove him away even though he had calmed down.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” he heard Granger ask. She had clearly picked up on the fact that Harry’s reaction was not at all the angry one it should have been. Draco didn’t dare turn around to look, but he sat as still as possible to hear Harry’s reply.
Harry shook his head fondly. “I’m surprised you haven’t noticed by now.” He leaned forward, brushing his lips over Draco’s. “I like you, you idiot.”
But Draco was used to being in the spotlight in one way or another, and this sudden lack of any attention whatsoever was remarkably disorienting. He was used to creating a stir, to eliciting reactions from people, whether those reactions were good or not. Admittedly, he found himself floundering a bit without the motivation to constantly conduct himself in a proper manner to uphold his reputation.
It was Harry’s turn to look away and hide his face, but Draco could still see the pink tips of his ears. “Maybe. Secret.”
“Harry,” Granger interjected, and Draco could imagine the way she placed one hand on Harry’s shoulder while using the other arm to elbow Weasley in the side for his brutishness. Honestly, they were so predictable it hurt to think about. “You must’ve heard wrong. There wasn’t anything about you taking care of yourself—I don’t know who, but someone just yelled at you for being an idiot.”
Draco relished in the satisfaction of being able to create this much of a stir. He’d been cast into the shadows since the end of the war, not explicitly hated but certainly not included in anyone’s vision of the future. He was simply on the sidelines, a spectator as the rest of the world moved forward.
Hermione gave him a stern look. “I’m serious. You should know how much he detests being idolized. And, well, I know you’ve seen him at his worst—yes, I know about the bathroom incident, don’t look so surprised. If you can still love him after that, then it’s real. He needs that.”
Draco turned around in his seat so that he could fully watch Harry. It certainly wouldn’t draw any extra attention to him, not when the rest of the students were just as openly interested. And even if it was a little odd that he was looking, it was all worth it to see Harry’s befuddled reaction.
Harry turned even pinker. “Erm, no, it’s fine. They said that they—they loved how selfless I am but that I deserve just as much as I give, which is quite literally the world.” Harry buried his head in his hands, but even from my position across the room, Draco could see the tips of his ears burning bright red.
Draco shifts, and Harry’s suddenly on top of him, and Draco’s fingers are caressing his back, dipping down the cleft of his arse, and it’s everything Harry wants. Moans escape from his lips as he writhes against Draco, desperate for more friction between them.
At some point during the exchange, my hand has moved to my crotch and I’m stroking myself in earnest now, imagining his hands, his mouth, his skin. I let his words dig a nest into my heart until I feel like the months of April: entirely new and bursting with life. When I finally come, I suck at the skin of my wrist where his last words have appeared and I quietly mouth
What you must understand, dearest reader, is that Harry Potter doesn’t want to think of himself as being in love with Draco Malfoy. There are many reasons for that, many complicated reasons, some of them having to do with how the two of them were enemies for the longest time and all of them having to do with the fact that Harry Potter has been steadfastly refusing to take a good look at his emotions since the end of the war.
“It’s okay. It’s not so bad I’m dead. I don’t mind. My parents were going to marry me off to a man anyway, so you know, when you weigh up the options, tuberculosis isn’t all that bad,” she continues. “No offence meant, of course, since you’re both men and all that. I just prefer girls by a lot. It wasn’t something I could just tell my parents when I was alive, though. I would have had to marry the bloke and have children and...”
The words are the first thing I see when I wake up, lazily stretching along my right arm. And that’s when I finally realise something is seriously wrong.
“Pounding,” he repeats as he finds the right page and sets the book down on the table. He busies himself with clearing the table to make space for a small silver cauldron; I crane my neck and try to make out the contents of the book. It is some sort of potion recipe. I don’t know what I expected.
who was kind enough to point out a handful of mistakes in this chapter. All remaining typos are mine.
Slowly, Draco pulls away and brings his wrists to his chest, his face split open by pain and regret. There is something different there too, something harder and sharper like resolve. (Harry suddenly knows Draco is not going to stay.)
Then, Draco finally touches Harry, finally palms his cock in warm hands, and Harry thinks he will go entirely mad with the friction and the pressure and the mere thought that it’s Draco touching him (finally, finally, finally.)
“I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” you say into the crook of his neck as if it could somehow explain the ants and the emptiness, the nausea and the loneliness. He pulls you closer, fists his hand in your hair, and you can’t find it in yourself to tell him more. Not now, not now, not when he’s warm and soft against you, not when you love him so much and you’ve missed him like a thunderstorm.
I love you, Draco. I’ve loved you for longer than I’ve known. I’m fairly sure I was in love with you in sixth-year when I followed you around all the time. I might have been in love with you before that.
I’d start with your shoulder. I’d touch the skin there, softly. Then, I’d run my fingers gently along your collarbones and up your neck. I’d caress your jaw bone, I’d learn its shape by heart with my eyes closed. Then, I think I’d move on to your mouth. I’d trace your lips with my fingertips, I’d press one inside your bottom lip until the pad of it is wet.
You are no longer welcome here, and there is no amount of degnoming that will make me forget what you did.
I shouldn’t, of course. I should wait a few days, I should clear my head, talk it over with Ron. I should do a whole lot of things that I don’t feel like doing at all, so I don’t do any of them. I just leave my office on my lunch break and walk through the streets of London.
Malfoy’s face darkens. He pushes himself to his feet and puts his clothes back on in angry, brusque motions.
You know the weightless exhilaration of declaring you're gay on national radio will fade, and you know that by the time you're alone in the soft silence of night, sat in your living room with nothing but the endless stream of your panic-yearn thoughts and the sound of a ticking clock, you'll go entirely mad with longing and sadness again. But it is not dark yet, and the soft sunset is kissing the cobbled streets in peach-golden hues, and you'll be alright. Eventually.
Wait, no, that’s too personal, isn’t it? Let me put it this way: I’m twenty-six. Do we have more than a five year age difference?
And then, Draco’s coming too, and Harry is holding him through his orgasm, and kissing his collarbone, and runs soft hands down his back, and—
I touch myself again, before I go to sleep, all the while imagining his hands on me, his mouth on my neck and his name on my lips.
There is an entire rainforest under your skin, filled with a million tiny lives and a million tiny deaths, and you’re not sure how to deal with it.
“I bought a house,” Harry says. It is an early April morning and he’s standing at the gates of Malfoy Manor, drizzle sticking his hair to his forehead and dripping down his neck.
You want to tell him how wrong he is. How different things are, this time. You want to hold his face, and you want to tell him you’ll never reject him again if he’ll have you. But time’s running out, and you have a job to do, and you’ve never been good with words, have you? You’ve never known how to use them unless it was to goad or hurt. So you just blurt out the first thing that comes into your head, and it’s confused and wrong, but Draco agrees to see you again, and it’s good enough, you think.
“Really?” she asks, twisting a strand of hair around her finger. “Do you mean this? We could really all stay?”
The man doesn’t turn around, but he’s got starlight hair and he’s wearing a fuzz-soft jumper despite the biting cold of early morning, and Harry would know him everywhere. (Draco. Draco. Draco.)
“Mr Potter,” she answers in a voice that sounds like pearls falling on a marble floor. “I’m afraid Draco is not home at the moment. May I inquire as to the object of your visit?”
“We usually only treat werewolves here,” he says when I’m done pouring my heart out to him. “We don’t even have enough beds for all of them. We don’t have enough funds.”
Malfoy answers with something snarky. You fall back into the familiar ebb and flow of trading blows until you spit out:
Fat tears roll down his chin and along the line of his jaw. He does not move. He barely breathes. In his hand, there is Draco’s, still and warm.
“I think that will be enough, don’t you?” she asks Draco, who’s leaning against the wall in a corner of the room, face pale and spine stiff. When he smiles, there is sadness behind his eyes.
I follow him behind the counter through a heavy plum curtain and to a cluttered table in a tiny room full of books and paper.
My breath catches in my lungs at his words. Everything, I want to say. Everything you want. I would do it all. I would give you everything I have. More than that even, if you let me.
“As I was saying,” Draco continues with a frown, “there are many ghosts in this place, and they’re very anxious about what you intend to do with the building. It’s been home to them for several decades now, and they’re not keen on being banished or having to share their space with rude hotel guests or businessmen on fancy seminars.”
“Charlie could use help with the dragons,” Ron suggested one day over a late evening cup of tea. Harry had been telling them he couldn’t stand the idea of going back to Grimmauld Place when every single room was still filled with memories of Draco. He couldn’t stand facing them yet. “I could owl him if you liked. Might do you good to be on your own, for a bit… Go back to nature, you know. Supposed to heal you and all that.”
“He… He never did anything to me.” The air is thick in Harry’s lungs, the words heavy as lead on his tongue. “Not… Like that… Not in the magical sense.”
I also try not to think of the particular way Draco used to stand hunched over cauldrons in his lab at the ministry when I visited him.
“Kiss me, you coward,” I hiss at a helmet with odd eyebrows and a moustache sitting in a display case. “You said you were going to,” I add, barely above a whisper.
I smile. He’s not wrong. I’ve grown fond of his quick wit and propensity to find fault with my questions. I rephrase.
Draco is crying in earnest now, sobs shaking his thin frame as he buries his face in his hands. Gently, Harry pulls him close and into a hug. Draco doesn’t stop crying, and Harry rubs circles onto his back as a terrible kind of sadness submerges him like a heartbreak-ocean until he is drowning in the undertow.
“I remember going to my parents’ for Sunday dinner. Then, my memories start to fade. I remember my parents’ Equinox ball last summer, Miles had a hand over my shoulders and it was the happiest I have ever felt. I remember shopping inon Diagon Alley—a new dress I think, an awful mess of light pink chiffon I would never normally wear. I remember thinking it was wonderful. I remember the smell of roses in Parkinson Manor Park, and I remember thinking Miles was going to propose. I remember bits and pieces, in no particular order, like puzzle pieces that don’t fit together. And I hate it, Potter. I hate it. I hate not having my memories. I hate that there is a hole in my mind where the last two years should be.”
The words are a silver bullet through Harry’s heart, and Harry thinks his thick jumper might grow red with the impact of them (a pain-peony blooming warm and wet across the cable-stitched wool.). He wants to punch Draco or to kiss him or to fall apart entirely.
