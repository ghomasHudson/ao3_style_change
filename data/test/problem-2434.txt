Kretcher had been to see a magical mind healer and, after spending many years being healed and helped had been helped. Instead of being known by the cruel name of Kretcher was now being called by his birth name Knobby and working at though had expressed a desire to come work for him when he set up home again. Knowing that he wanted to set up a home for magical creatures he set about looking for a place that he could set up such an adventure. After a few lunches with Draco Hogsmeade had become very interesting to him the only issue he had was the lack of space.
“Lucius was thinking about October but we will have to see how things go” Narcissa hummed very gently her hand coming to rest on Harry’s shoulder. He felt instant guilt knowing that he had made things a lot more difficult for them. He hung his head only to have it lifted by gentle fingertips. They walked the rest of the way to the hotel in silence talking again only when they were saying goodbye to Pansy in the lobby.
“Don’t worry about him, that’s just Moony” The boy said with a smile that caused green eyes to flash brightly. A basket of neatly folded laundry was shifted from one hip to the other before he held out his hand. “Let me help you up”

My favourite team is the Jumping Toadstools, however I must swear you to secrecy on that as many believe them to be very folksy, they have more joy for the game than most professional teams these days. I have a Quidditch pitch at home but sadly my father is often too busy to play, he was keeper at school, and Pants pretty much hates everything about the game so mostly I just fly laps on my father’s old broom. My parents refuse to buy me my own until I’m in Hogwarts.
“If I touch you here does it hurt?” Tobias asked very lightly touching him on his hip and then the base of his spine.
“Madam, please be silent” Lucius waved his stick and her mouth snapped closed causing her eyes to fill with fear. “I am going to tell you what is going to happen, in just a few moments will be summoning the aurors and you will be explaining your actions to them. Child abuse is not something we take lightly”
“I need no name but if it pleases you, you can name me” Boy smiled happily, and he was delighted in the blush that Draco gave. His pale skin made it easy to show his emotions and Boy was always happy to see it. Once he had gathered enough firewood they walked back to the edge of the forest. They never travelled too far into the Forbidden Forest knowing that a great evil lurked in the centre, but sometimes, before he had met Draco, Boy had wondered if he should just walk to the centre and give himself to Voldemort. Now, with Draco visiting him, he thought he could take anything his master’s could and would give him. “I will see you again soon, Draco” He said as they once again reached Nimbus. Severus flew from his perch on Draco’s shoulder and settled back in his tree while Moony pressed against his leg. “And I will see you both again soon”
“Please show him in” Narcissa smiled her hand resting on Harry’s shoulder. The green eyed boy smiled up at her and then nervously waited for his parents old friend. Lucius and Severus were ruffled from their duel, with Lucius’ hair having escaped its tie and Severus looking a little red in the pale cheeks but both smoothed themselves out quickly as the door to the training room opened and the light brown haired man came in. He was wearing the same clothes as he had been in Hogsmeade and here against the wealth of the Malfoy manor it made him look shabby and tired and yet he was standing with his back straight and he bowed politely.
“They are beautiful”
“I can speak, French, Italian, Latin, and Japanese, does that make me a freak? Parsel is rarer certainly but it is another language and you should be proud” Draco answered quickly taking Harry’s smaller hand in his own and squeezing it tightly. The green eyed boy looked up at him with his lips parted a flush staining his cheeks before he gave a smile and ducked his head downwards.
“Sevvy?” Remus murmured his voice rough and faint as he opened his eyes and looked at him with a somewhat sleepy smile. He looked so rumpled it took a great effort for Severus to not do something foolish like smooth out his hair as he would Harry when he had forgotten a comb. His amber eyes were clouded with sleep and yet the glow of the wolf was there, as strong as ever this close to the moon. Severus wished that he could do more for his gentle lover, but even he could not find a cure for werewolf-ism, at least not yet.
Draco woke abruptly the remnants of his night-terror clinging to him just as assuredly as the sweat that drenched his body. Milky white strands of daylight had only just started to make their way lazily into the room telling him it had only been a few hours since he had managed to fall to sleep in the first place. He sighed pushing his fringe from his face leaning back against the ornate headboard staring out at the furnishings of his bedroom. His body ached with the need for more sleep but he knew he wouldn’t manage it. His alarms would be going off in half an hour anyway and he couldn’t ignore them, not unless he wanted to start months of work once again. The life of a wand maker wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, he thought closing his eyes and flexing each of his fingers and toes in turn. In honesty, he could have handled the light nights and early mornings, he’d always been an early riser and he had grown used to late nights, but he couldn’t handle the nightmares.
“And you are far harsher. You have made mistakes, Severus, as we all have, you should not let your life go by wallowing in them. Have you thought more of the blood adoption?” Severus let his eyes soften as he looked at the child of his former enemy and best friend. The idea of blood adopting the boy had been flying around in his mind for as long as he had known Lily’s intention, it was the best way to protect the boy from Dumbledore and other’s that might seek to harm him but he didn’t know if Harry would wish to be tied to him in that way, even if he would be staying with the Malfoy’s and then there was Lupin to consider. Lupin would surely argue for the sake of his friend.

Harry sighed, his left leg twitching frantically as he looked nervously over at the door to the small private café, he had arranged to meet Ginny in. He felt more nervous than he had in a long time, and he didn’t like it, it made him feel like that scared 11-year-old boy struggling to find the platform for 9 and 3/4. He told himself time and time again that he had done the decent thing by Ginny, he had tried to love her as he should and then, when he had figured everything out, he had broken up with her quickly. She was young enough to find somebody else and from what he’d seen and heard she had made a name for herself in Quidditch, playing not only for the Enchanting Eternals but also England as Seeker, it was believed that England had a real chance for the cup this year and he was happy for her.
“Draco…He told me…When we were in France…I…I told him…I told him I can talk to snakes…” Harry whispered as soon as he saw that they were alone. “He said…He said that only Vol…Um…You know who could talk to them…”
“Did you see that, Harry?!” He shouted running over and giving him a bear hug. “I did it!”
“You’re the amazing one, Draco. I’m so happy you’re my friend!” Harry giggled happily turning to look at him the angle making them appear upside down to each other. Harry’s eyes were really green without the glass of his glasses and Draco could see his own reflection in their green orbs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry?” Draco whispered in disbelief half convinced that he was mistaken. Harry was only a few months younger than he was and yet the pale black haired boy in front of him barely looked to be older than seven years. The clothes he was wearing were four times the size of the boy and stretched out of all shape and style. His unnervingly green eyes widened as Draco stepped out from behind his mother his lips parting in a gasp.
After that day Draco would sneak to the forest every chance he got calling out for Boy and spending hours in his company. Boy would get him to help gather firewood, wash clothes, or gather fruits and Draco would teach him to reach and write using a stick in the mud. His days with Boy were becoming his best though he couldn’t help but notice that his friend often wore the marks of abuse on his skin and the chores always seemed harsh for somebody so fragile. Draco thought that if he could, he would take Boy to the palace and treasure him and have people take care of him.
“Oi! Freak!” The fat boy said with a sneer before his eyes moved over to Narcissa who had her arms folded over her chest but Draco could see the tip of her wand poking from under her hand. She didn’t have time to use it however as their was a crack and Draco saw his father walking towards him. He had removed his outer robe but otherwise he was wearing what he would always wear. His snake headed cane was in his hand and he was glaring out at the world or more particularly Dudley and his friends. He strode between them causing them to scatter like rodents.
“The draught of sleeping death”
Hmmm I hope that this wasn't too boring... Castor and Pollux were the sons of Zeus and became the star sign Gemini. The story goes that Zeus transformed into a Swan and seduced Leda who had four eggs. From which were born Castor and Pollux and Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra
Thanks
“Master Lucius! Youse frienden Professors Snakes is heres, Sir” Rocky announced from he door and suddenly Harry felt very cold and very afraid the memories he had been forced to relive coming back sharp and fast until he heard Narcissa say;
“The Malfoys have taken him to their hearts. You should visit and see them with him, speaking of which, if all went well today, Narcissa has invited you to the manor for lunch next week. They may not be a light family but they are a good one you should come and see that for yourself” Severus pulled a small letter from his pocket and handed it over and Remus chuckled lightly as he saw his name in a golden swirl. He hadn’t known what to expect in this meeting. He had hoped that it would all go well but he hadn’t known how Severus would act around him but now he had the promise of potion that would help him and an invitation for dinner at Malfoy manor.
“But why did Merlin become a student? Why not just have him as the teacher?”
“You think they brought some of each to send just in case?” Harry chuckled touching the feather on his Quill and Draco nodded happily.
“Is there a chance he was exposed to a dark artifact? House elves are very tuned in to the magic of a wizard’s home, but they are the only true light humanoid creatures. Prolonged exposure to Dark magic could cause an unbalance” The man mused thoughtfully when they had almost reached Narcissa’s room. “It was something that Grindelwald tried to do. He wanted to corrupt House elves. He thought if he could corrupt them, he would have an obedient race that would listen only to him”
I hope the chapter was okay xD
“You are, now I will do the spell from last week, okay? We’ll see if it hurts if it does you can go without it for today” She told him getting to her feet and pointing the wand at him. She murmured the spell and once again Harry’s bones felt as though the they were being pulled and squeezed but there was no pain this time. “You okay Harry?”
“So, Severus, you and Lupin settled your childish differences?”
“Sorry Aunt Petunia”
“You want me to help?”
“Good morning, Harry, Draco, I trust you slept well?” Lucius said as the pair came into the bright breakfast room. Harry thought that this room was one of his favourites with beautiful flowers in large vases. It was smaller than the other rooms more intimate with a small table. The rooms overlooked a new part of the garden. Narcissa was reading a letter while sipping a cup of tea while Lucius had a bowl of fruit with some yogurt as he read a newspaper. Vernon had always hated being talked to while reading the paper but supposed that he was expecting an answer.
“Oh, I read them, Pants, but it was rather dry going. Did you have to talk about every cafe you have visited and every drink?” Draco sighed heavily and Pansy let out a laugh her eyebrow lifting up her face. She wasn’t as beautiful as Narcissa or even Draco but there was something about her that was pretty when she smiled even though she had an upturned nose.
“Just stay with us and run when we tell you…” George winked pulling something out of his own pocket. It was thin and long with a cord on one end. Harry didn’t recognise it, but Draco hissed out a breath.
“So Harry can stay here? Right?”
“You gained the trust of a wolf, you surely must be one of the fairy-folk”
“I’m sorry, I’m being such an idiot” Harry whispered his voice barely audible over the almost choked sob he let out. “I don’t even know why, they didn’t even hurt me all that much...I’m just being stupid”
“Would you like to be in our group?”
“…Why did Dumbledore have to leave? Wasn’t he the greatest wizard of all time? I wanted to learn under him!” Hermione asked immediately “I read all about him!”
“After warm milk and Uncle Lucius read to me” Draco didn’t miss the use of Uncle Lucius over the more formal Sir or Mr Malfoy that he had been using and he wondered what had happened to make it change in the space of a night. He didn’t get to ask though as Rocky popped into the room with a crack.
“See! Harry! If we were pirates, we could sail all around the world learning about different cultures! It would feed your nerdish behaviour and I would make a very dashing pirate” Draco announced happily nudging him in the stomach with his bony elbow. Narcissa and Remus joined them as he said this, and she ruffled his hair before announcing to the assembled party
“Yes, the whole village is much the same, we shall have time to explore a little later, for now I see Lupin” Severus motioned to a corner table where a man with sandy brown hair and shabby looking robes. He hadn’t changed much since they were younger, Severus thought noting how pale and tired Lupin was and how his amber eyes moved from the door to the clock on wall. Several empty bottles of chocolate milk drink were scattered on the table around him and Severus remembered that Lupin was fond of chocolate and always seemed to have a bar stashed away about his person. Harry moved slowly into his side as he always did when he was nervous clutching tightly to Draco’s hand. “It will be fine, brat, I’m here. As is Draco and Jinx is only a shout away, nothing can hurt you”
“No! Not at all, Sir, I just…Um…Didn’t know…You had a son, sir”
“Madam Figg is rather fond of cats, she never noticed another amongst her horde. I rarely saw him however and when I did, he was doing all manner of chores. They worked him harder than any house elf.” Minerva pushed her glasses to the top of her head and Severus watched her steadily. He wanted to believe her; he had always been fond of her. In some ways she reminded him of his mother, or what his mother would have been without his father and the years of abuse she had suffered at his hand, but he was always sure that she was Dumbledores and he would not risk Harry for anything.
“Me Da’s a muggle…” Seamus was saying cheerfully as he rubbed his head from the latest wand smack from his mother. They were almost at the teams changing rooms and the casual conversation had come round to parentage. “What about youse?”
“Nonsense! You are no fuss at all! Severus is at fault and he knows it, he will be back tomorrow to offer and apology but it is up to you if you choose to accept it, Harry dear” Narcissa said softly heto r blue eyes firm and Harry gave her a smile nervously taking another square of chocolate. “Once he has been we will go to Paris and get you some clothes”
“And I will do more. I have the money and my lawyers are having fun. Just accept it and let’s carry on. It is growing late and in the morning we will have much to do”
“Thats good, because you are anyway, Harry, in a roundabout way, deceptions always work best with the element of truth to them. So for today you are Harrison Black, child of my cousin Sirius” She smiled fussing over his hair again before straightening his collar. The Parkinsons would no doubt believe that Harry was in actual fact her bastard borne of a romance, his younger appearance would feed such rumours but she didn’t mind. She knew the truth as did her husband and it was better that gossip would be put her way than Harry’s when he already had so much on his shoulders. “Dragon, go on through...” She hummed as the flames flared indicating that the link to the house in France was open. “Remember to speak clearly”
“Brutus! I’m happy to see you as well!” Masaki laughed grabbing the mane and twisting his head this way and that. The goat head with a beard of black fuzz baaed happily its blunt teeth biting gently at the man’s hands. The three females watched until their male was satisfied and then moved forward giving him the same treatment. “Hey Gloria, Tammy, and Sophia! How are you my girls! I’ve missed you! But you need to be good! I brought some friends to play with you” Masaki moved away from the Chimera and motioned to Harry and Draco who both shifted nervously. There wasn’t much time to do anything else before the four Chimera were running to them. The male, Brutus lapped a long stripe over Harry’s face and Harry jerked just slightly at the feeling of a scratchy tongue. “Okay! Guys, you’ve said hello but let me introduce you properly!” Masaki let out a laugh and pushed the Chimera away until they were all standing in an orderly line. “That’s better, Draco…Come stand here”
“Oi, where’s Potter?” A voice sneered not too far from the bush he was sitting in and Harry carefully closed the book, where he had been reading about postage owls, and crouched down as low as he could. Dudley’s gang had decided that it was time for a game of Harry hunting now that he had been allowed out and they were bored which was why he was sitting in the bush in the first place. He normally went to the small playground on the next street over but the Gang knew about that spot and he had been beaten up more times than he could count there already. Dudley never came into Figg’s garden however because none of her many cats liked him and would spit and hiss whenever he got too close.
“Do you yield?” Severus asked pointing his wand at Lucius’ throat. His stance and expression were completely different to normal. Harry thought that he should have feared it, but as he could see a playful smile on the potion master’s lips, he was relaxed. Harry had inched forward his green eyes enraptured by the duel that had just taken place. He didn’t fully understand everything that he had just witness but he was positively tingling with excitement. Lucius dropped his wand and held up his hands laughing as he hummed
“I’m okay, but...But can Dray be here? And Aunty Cissy?” He asked nervously still hating asking for anything as he was always waiting for a hit to the face. “Sorry”
“I wass, I thought, you were going to let me go in the groundsss…” The snake wrapped its slender body around his neck and pushed its head down in between the top two buttons of his shirt. It felt cold against his skin but not overly unpleasant.
“Yes, sir” Harry answered closing his eyes as the man cast a spell. As he had been warned his whole body started to tickle as though he had full body pins and needles. It seemed focused in more areas than others but over all it was a full body thing. As it was happening Tobias made a series of snorts and tuts and Harry had a feeling that if he opened his eyes the grandfatherly man would be shaking his head.
Narcissa was in her nursery tending to a rather beautiful but deadly Angel’s trumpet plant. It was useful in many potions but it was deadly poison if used incorrectly. Narcissa’s beautiful hair was tied up into a butterfly clip which fluttered every so often as she worked.
“Does she have a name?”
Placing his cup in the white sink, Harry quickly cast a cleaning spell on the major wash waiting. He had been sure he wouldn’t use magic at home to do his chores, considering he was only a single person, but after having to work horrible long hours at St. Mungo’s he quickly realized how handy magic was.
“I’m gay.”
Coughing, Malfoy changed the subject.
“I’m sorry.” Harry scratched his head. “History isn’t my strong side.”
Quickly locking eye contact with Dumbledore, Harry silently expressed himself as much as possible. Dumbledore gave him an almost invisible nod, before turning to Professor Snape.
Harry just shook his head and tried to conjure a polite smile. The door closed again with a shushing sound and Harry was once again left to himself. His friends would arrive soon, he hoped. Ron and Hermione had duties in the Prefects’ compartment but they would hurry back, they promised. While some of the others had to say ‘hello’ to all the other Gryffindors first. At Kings Cross’ it had been obvious that a certain amount of Slytherins were missing. Some had obviously not been allowed to come back. Others had been collected with their death eater parents or been rushed to a more neutral school. Such as Drumstrang.
“I know and I’m really sorry about that part, but Hagrid, he breathed fire-“
“But Pansy, I still promised-“
“Okay, Potter. I have to tell you something.”
“Potter… this is-“
“Okay, I will do it another day, but right now we should probably focus.”
“Erhm..” Harry doubted he would be able to get another sweater if he talked to him right now. He could always catch up to with him later that day. “I really have to get to my room before class, so kind off.”
Wanting to keep the good mood, Jason decided to let it go. While it was unnerving not to trust his mate completely, something in him sensed a lie.
“We cannot control what people think of us, Harry. We can only be ourselves and hope for the best.”
“What happened?”
Shaking his head, he mustered the will to smile reassuringly.
“Well, I guess Ron is just a little sensitive, thinking you an egotistic asshole who never cares about anyone except himself!” The hissing sound leaving him might as well have been in parseltongue.
“WHAT? You slimy git!”
He could storm out and find Draco. Hex him to pieces and not give a shit who saw. He could quietly leave Hogwarts and never come back, just disappear into the night. But no matter how much anger pierced him the one other emotion that had grabbed its hold on him was shame.
“So,” Knott began. “How do we win this thing?”
“Hello Harry! How are you enjoying the party?”
“Yeah, its fine. I didn’t know you… you know. In here.”
“Harry-“ Hagrid looked him straight in the eyes. “If anything had happened to ‘ye-“
“Hogwarts will miss your presence, but I am certain you will all do well, going into the real world and turning your focus and skills elsewhere. For everyone one of you; We at Hogwarts wish you congratulations and most of all, good luck.”
“So how are you and Jason doing?”
“What time is it?” Harry stretched.
“Fine. It is always harder the first week, getting used to the new beds, sharing a room with so many people and generally be in another country again.” Malfoy explained. “You?”
“Which can only be proven if you willingly take a stand in the court and register yourself under their Creature Value and Protection law, meaning you will be under sharp measuring and detection constantly.”
“Oh, merlin beard…” Hagrid mumbled. The two stood completely frozen as they waited for the Professors to join them.
“Splendid, then let’s join the party.” Zabini smirked convincible and turned around without another word.
Without another word, the determined golden boy got up and raced towards the dungeon. Quickly making his way through the hall, he felt his calves start burning and he dearly missed how much Quidditch he had used to play. ‘After this, I’m gonna start jogging.’ Harry thought as he rushed through the cold veil of the fat prior who undignifiedly yelped.
Harry hurried and shook the outreached hand. Smiling, Harry replied who he was.
Laughing, Theo could obviously see the surprising pleasant effect the bubbling drink had on him.
Quickly, he felt his body reacted and his cock started twitching against the warm water. Keeping one hand on his nipple, his other hand teasingly started playing with his smaller head. Gasping as he pulled back the foreskin and twisted his hand around. Leaning his forehead against the cold stone wall, he closed his eyes. Different images erupted and the tan boy from Ravenclaw sat in front of him on his knees. He sinfully sat all innocent before him and slowly darted his tongue forward, licking his head as if he were a kitten. Gasping, Harry pinched his nipple a little harder, as the fantasy was replaced by a paler hand from behind. Running teasingly over his body, the hand mapped out his toned muscles, moving down his abs and it suddenly grabbed his cock. Hollowly, Harry pushed into his hand and speed up. So close. His other hand went to his mouth and he pushed a finger into it. Pushing it back and fourth he imagined Malfoy’s finger in his mouth teasingly running his tongue all over it, getting it good and wet. So close.
The wolf was gladly surprised when he got a discreet leather band ‘For his especially rough after-transformation days.’
Bingo.
Taking a deep breath, she collected herself and got up. “You need to leave.”
Cautiously opening his eyes again, Harry tried to get used to the light.
“That’s okay. Well, she is really kind and calm, this one.” Harry laughed as the mare bumped against his hand to continue his stroking. “See?”
“Merlin, I had no idea.” Draco pondered for a second. “Well, based on everything you just said, it seems as if you’ve already made a decision.”
He pulled it back and fourth gently, simply noticing his inner walls as the wrapped around him. Feeling the slight pain fade, he moved another finger inside himself. Harry couldn’t help but rock back and fourth as his cock desperately tried to find any kind of friction in the water. Moaning, he slipped a third finger inside and finally hit god’s greatest creation. He couldn’t help moaning so loudly now that he noticed the mermaid had woken up by the noise.
“Father, why- Harry?”
“I want to.” Jason took his glove of his hand pulled out the hardened flesh. “Lean back.” He ordered as Blaise gasped loudly, feeling the cold air hit his erection. Glancing at the dark flesh in his hand, Jason teasingly moved a hand up and down, getting to know the most intimate part of his boyfriend. The heavy flesh pulsed underneath him and a bead of pre-come gathered at the slightly darker head. Jason’s mouth watered at the sight, and he leaned in to taste him for the first time.
Harry practically jumped back in surprise. Blushing wildly, he realized that Professor Snape was standing right behind them, cross-armed and dark eyebrows raised in question. Harry couldn’t help but wonder what was going through the professor’s mind right now. Seeing two students, whom had always been enemies, stand so close and alone together in the hallway.
“Harry, where are you going? Class was cancelled, remember?” Hermione’s voice called after him as he went in the direction of the front door.
Harry quickly assured him, he would keep it to himself, no matter what. Still, he was rather curious and Jason didn’t seem to mind the questions. They laid back in their own bed talking, until the natural light inside the infirmary began to brighten. Seeing this, the boys became aware of the fact that they had stayed up through most of the night and decided to sleep the few hours they had left before Madam Pomphrey would come and wake them up.
“Because he told us, Potter. He told everyone about the fact that you slept together. He told us about that stupid giraffe you gave him.”
Well that would a person who was sweet, helpful, funny – if his father had anything to say – and charming. Well, Malfoy was definitely charming. He was funny sometimes. Mostly in a sarcastic way or at the expense of others. He could be sweet when he really tried. He was probably helpful for some of his friends… Okay, looking back over the years Harry had known Malfoy, he wouldn’t exactly be the right guy for him to introduce. Certainly not to the Weasleys. That would be even more of a disaster than back in third year with Ron’s old rat Peter Pettigrew and Crookshanks. So who would be a great example of a boyfriend? Harry ripped a small corner of the parchment from his schoolbag and grabbed a feather. Looking amongst the students, he gathered inspiration.
“Hagrid…”
Harry couldn’t help but wonder where Voldemort was right now? Would he be in hell? Had his soul been so damaged, he just disappeared into nothing? Harry had never felt more pity for another person than when he watched Voldemort’s final moment in the Ministry. To see a person crumble in front of you, realizing you lost everything you believed in. Harry didn’t regret killing him, and he never would, but pity? Yes, Voldemort was indeed a person who needed it. Even the deatheaters’ – no matter how awful they were- had families, sisters, brothers and children whom they, in their own way, cared for. But Voldemort?
“They are probably attached to all the excitement.” Neville tried to engage in the conversation.
“You were right.”
“Are you going to try out for the Quidditch team again?”
“Harry, love, please. I made a mistake. I don’t know how you found out and it doesn’t matter- please just let me explain-“
“I do not know if Fawkes will do anything yet, Mr. Zabini. He is here of his own free will and I cannot force him to do any other.”
“Sorry man,” Jason smiled overbearingly. “The rules stated you had to be hit with a snowball, or in Harry’s case, a handful of snow. Getting pushed over into the snow, doesn’t count.”
Chuckling Harry decided;
“Mr. Potter, I have recently discovered a few ingredients from my private storage have gone missing. You wouldn’t happen to know what had happened to them, would you?”
“It’s probably nothing. We just had a small fight earlier and I just want to talk things out before it gets awkward.”
“And while I find it very noble of you to tell me of which I already know, I don’t believe you being a guest at the grounds gives you permission to allow the students to break rules.” Snape’s voice could cut glass as he glared at Remus. “Now all students who does not feel like having detention for an entire week with Mr. Filch, get going. 10 points from each of you for breaking in.”
Malfoy expression was still pure confusion and he desperately tried to gain control by touching Harry cheek.
“What? You wanted the bet. Of course, the second the golden boy goes out with anyone, someone will notice.”
“Hey, I’m here too, you know, your brother?” he grumbled.
Leaning against the railing, Jason looked as the hills surrounding them turned white. Harry was rather curious as to what could be so important they had to discuss it up here.
“Besides, I don’t have to do anything. In the end it is my choice.”
“The present…” Draco looked him directly in the eyes and Harry awkwardly stared at his chest, blushing. “It was wonderful.” He whispered.
“He is your son, isn’t he?”
“Watch it Potter, I will still kick your ass even outside the field.” Malfoy sneered, while Harry leaned back his head and laughed. This was actually nice. Talking like normal teenagers. Not having to worry about anythin.
“You may, IF you will sit in complete silence and do your homework. I will not have you dallying off.”
“I know.” Harry smiled lovingly.
Slightly annoyed, Harry accepted the glass and took a sip. And then a bigger one.
“Merlin’s lumpy underpants!” Harry laughed as the Veela honestly jumped into the air. Sitting down gently, so as not to create even more disturbance, Jason held a hand over his heart in a theatrical sense.
“Malfoy!”
Suddenly the older man looked straight in the other direction of their conversation.
“No, sir.” The elf apologized, his giant ears dropping. “Elves don’t usually get involved with other magical creatures unless they are asked to by their master. Dobby wasn’t even the elf, asked to deliver the stash of food for them, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh.”
“Oh, Severus. Thank you….so very much.”
Draco slipped through a larger group on the floor and gathered him in his arms. Although it was wonderful to feel the strong hold on his body, Harry had little but no doubt, he would mess it up.
The boys left the dying fire and settled down in the dorm room. Harry asked a house elf for new sheets on one of the beds next to Jason’s. When they had both used the bathroom and gotten into their pajamas, they sat on Harry’s temporary bed to talk a little while longer. They had started talking about what to come after their graduation.
This thought hit him a few times a day now and it was getting quite exhausting having to hide his erection in class and at dinner every so often.
“The Professor is right, boys. It’s time to go to bed.”
“Mr. Weaple? What is all this commotion? Why aren’t you going to class?” Professor Binns slowly appeared through the wall, having heard the loud voices outside his classroom. He floated a few inches of the ground watching the four students for answers.
“Pansy, why are you here? I thought I couldn’t see you-“
Nonetheless, the more important topic was the fact that his son knew of his corrupted youth, following Lucius and his father Abramax, whom had taken him in after Severus left his own family behind. The ruthless man was certainly as charming as the dark lord had been in his younger years and it was hard not to get involved with the only people who looked out for you. Or left you with the fake feeling of being wanted and cared for. Being the only real family Severus had ever known, the Slytherins became his family and unfortunately left them to drag him down with them. It was only after his cowardly nature killed his best friend, he had truly meet people who cared for him for no other reason than being himself. While he knew he would never be good company or the kind you asked to join for a party, Severus wished to believe he would fight and stand by Albus and his colleagues, no matter the consequences.
Remus thankfully came to their rescue.
“That’s good to hear.” Remus seemed genuinely relieved. “Is Professor Snape still with him?”
“But Harry is coming too, Ron. He has class with us, remember? Harry are you coming?” she asked loudly. Clearly expecting him to follow her lead.
Oh. Taking a few steps ahead of the group, he stood still, waiting for Hagrid to continue. As he could see, some of his classmates had already been paired up and was waiting at his left.
“Pansy… I can’t leave you to deal-“
“So…” Ron tried to start up the conversation as he and Harry was walking behind. “How are things with him?”
“Just stay away from me.” Letting go of the pale hand, the lion returned to his tower while the snake stood left in the hallway, staring at his hand where the broken necklace shone.
“Hey Harry! Where have you been all day?” Dean demanded to know.
“He let you drink from-“ Harry awkwardly pointed at his own throat.
“The egg was left behind by its mother. Dragons never leave their youngsters, but… Charlie believes with all the new rules and new people sneaking around the reservation, she has been stressed and is no longer interested in keeping it.”
“Childish. But interesting,” Theodore chirped. “I actually wish to place a bet of our own. I place three gallons on Draco. Anyone else want in?”
“SILENCE!”
On the bedside table beside them, stood, not just a single, but almost a dozen different bottles of lube. Different sizes and colors, just ready to be opened.
Both were shaken out of their personal bubble when everyone around them started cheering. Embarrassed they had been seen, Harry’s heart almost flipped over, but then thankfully, Professor Dumbledore took the stage. His classic robes were coated in golden flakes at the bottom, giving it a slightly feminine touch. Although Harry didn’t really think the old man cared. As the applause died down, Dumbledore spoke.
“Even then-“ Snape began, still looking very upset.
Everyone seemed frozen. The two gorillas seemed surprised as well but didn’t dare to question their leader. Giving them one last glare, they turned around and went down the crypt. Malfoy had actually defended them. This was seriously disturbing.
Draco was happily getting in to it, not at all seeming embarrassed by the loud groans he emitted. After some time, Harry felt his jaw become slightly numb so he slowed down until he pulled off.
“Just a simple giraffe in natural colors and brown eyes. About this size.” He indicated. “If you could deliver it by owl to Hogwarts that would be perfect.” Discussing the few last details, Harry was certain it would be a perfect gift. He waved goodbye to the old man, and as he was about to leave the store, tiny puffs of smoke hit him in the chest. Searching for the source, he found a small red dragon made out of wood looking intensely at him. Chuckling at the tiny creature, he suddenly got another great idea for what to give Snape.
“That’s great!” Harry tried to keep his excited voice down as not to alarm the whole school. “So I guess we will see each other Christmas morning?”
“Oh no!”
Jason didn’t answer him but finally, the contact between them was broken and Blaise stood and watched him leave.
“Of course, at seven, right?” Jason nodded and waved goodbye to the group.
“No, Malfoy.” Harry stopped them and forced the paler boy to face him. “Do you WANT to work there? At that job? Beside your father?”
Remus laid a hand on his knee.  “If Mr. Malfoy came to you and told you he had made a mistake whilst being drunk and had slept in the same bed, in their underwear, kissing with another Slytherin; Would you forgive him?”
“I’m coming…” Potter gasped.
“Who release?” Dean intervened confused.
“Perhaps not, but that is my decision, so as it will be, when I start talking to Potter, he will be automatically drawn.” Hopefully.
“Draco, I’m really sorry but Hermione only got tonight to-“
Draco snorted and dusted off his sweater. “Keep dreaming, Potter.”
Time went by slowly and no potions was to be brewed today, so Harry found himself drifting off thinking about his encounter with Malfoy, rather than writing notes. Shaking his head at his own immaturity, he tried to stay concentrated and began listening to the professor in earnest.
Both knowing that Blaise was trying to ignore his question, Jason stopped him from continuing walking.
“Severus, you can’t make the pain of losing a parent simply go away. You need to talk to him.”
“Okay.” Harry leaned closer to whisper. “I think… I have a date next Hogsmeade trip. With Malfoy.”
“Stay here with me. Really, it would be so much fun and you could also spend some time with, you know.” Harry didn’t wish to say the name out loud in case anyone was snooping around the shelves.
Finally arriving at the infirmary, the group of four hurried inside.
Feeling on the urge of going crazy, Harry barely thought about the words leaving his mouth.
The candy store was as always one of the most visited sites in Hogsmeade. People stood outside waiting for the others to leave so the line would move. Thankfully, the window display outside had been changed since the last excursion and instead of the giant Chinese figuring with beard and hair made of licorice was now a giant peppermint mountain with tiny little miners digging and transporting the white lumps. While they stood in line, a smaller group of miners had placed explosives on the left side, sending a small cloud of white smoke up and letting boulders down onto the window ceiling.
Surprised but none the less very happy at the revelation, Jason kissed him again at the top of his hair. Breathing in the soothing smell of wood, spices and cold air, he continued to kiss his way down his face. Kissing slowly down the side of his head, to the ear where he gently bit the top, to his warm cheek. Blaise had kept composed and had been breathing very deeply. To Jason it had sounded very forced but he loved the fact that Blaise was so strictly holding himself together. It was only so much more fun, watching him crumble underneath his administrations.
“No, I guess not.” Knott didn’t look very impressed but left the matter alone.
The weather seemed truly perfect for such a day and Harry wondered if Dumbledore in someway was powerful enough to influence the weather on Hogwarts ground. Walking for some time, Harry stopped under a tree, simply enjoying the warmth seeping through the branches and watched as the students around the gardens, desperately tried to hug every single friend, goodbye.
Harry was truly confused how to answer that. Of all the ways he had imagined Draco asking him, this was not one of the scenarios.
But right now, it seemed like Malfoy might be wanting more. Harry tried to calm his beating heart. His hands were getting sweaty and he discreetly wiped them on his black robe as Malfoy came closer. In the end Harry forced his eyes shut and just waited, anticipated the following move.
“Blaise, stop it. I’ve decided.” Draco silenced him with a lifted hand.
Severus could have destroyed this pathetic shop in less than a second with him in it.
It’s time! Hope you enjoy and thanks for the reviews. This chapter is very short, since it is a lead-on to the story outside of Hogwarts.
“Great.” Seamus said, sitting across from him. “Except five days where mother had invited my cousins to stay. Not the older ones, just the younger triplets of girls my uncle Ralph just got. All of them!” he cried, smashing his head against the backrest. “I swear if someone ever tries to make a ponytail in my hair again, I will kick their tiny ass’!”
“What is the first class anyway?” Ron asked disinterested.
Trying to keep himself in line, he silently counted to ten before taking off. Running through the forest, he felt branches and twigs break beneath his feet. As he remembered to breathe deeply, the adrenaline caught up to him and he ran even faster, simply letting his nose and ears be his guide. He could hear Blaise run in front of him as he was getting out of breath.
Not even when his grandfather – the only family who had truly cared for him – died right before him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, not so far.” Harry bend over the table trying to see inside the crack. The egg was completely dark but slowly a yellow beaming opened up. The color quickly changed, getting used to the light from outside. The eye turned large as it finally connected to Harry’s. As if Harry’s presence became encouraging, the egg began cracking in several places at once. The shell flicked off and hit both Harry, Hagrid and a couple of pots, until nothing was left except a slimy very bright red dragon looked up. His eyes instantly sought of Harry and the second he noticed him, it tried to walk over the edge of the table. Thankfully, Harry’s seeker reflections were up to date and he caught the slimy reptile. The dragon moved even further up against him and tried to climb up his shirt with its tiny claws. Laughing, Hagrid sat down exhausted.
“Harry. This…Is something…” Severus started and then stopped his mouth opening and closing as he looked from Harry to the snake and then back again. Harry wondered if this was going to make the teacher hate him and wish he hadn’t adopted him, and he hung his head asking softly
“No fear, Professor Snape!” The twins grinned and Harry found Fred’s arm sliding around his shoulders as he led him to the desk. George followed with Draco and Harry soon found himself being introduced to Lee Jordan a cute black boy with tight braids and a huge friendly smile.
“James! Just let me do mine, Dumbledore will be here in a minute and I don’t want him hearing this until after” Lily said and Harry found himself turning to look at Dumbledore who had shifted in the seat his mouth dropping open under his beard. “I, Lily-Rose Potter, being of decreasingly sound mind thanks to my idiot husband hereby decree that this is my last will and testament and all other wills before this is null and void. First things first, Dumbledore, stay the hell away from my son, you hear me? Anyone that’s listening Sirius, Remus, do not let Dumbledore near my son and do not...And I repeat do not let my son, let Harry anywhere near my sister and that oaf of a husband of hers. I swear to Merlin that if Harry ends up there, I will come back and haunt you!”
Harry laughed reaching up to touch his hair. After a week with the Malfoys his hair was softer than ever and had started to take on a natural curl that although not as tame as Draco’s was no the less no longer like a birds nest and he was rather fond of his hair now and the way it curled about his face.  “Go back to your breakfast brat, I will see you tonight”
“How I wish I had gone to her before Dumbledore”
“Y-yes, thank you” Harry smiled at his secondary father who was soon spooning pules of soft mashed potatoes onto his plate.
“Sshs, Master Draco!” Jinx said putting a long finger over her mouth and hissing out a sshing noise her large eyes glittering with amusement “Sometimes it is fines! Little Master Harry had a bad turns! I fetches you somes now!”
It was smaller than his walk in closet and had less decoration. The walls were bare showing only the plaster walls. A beam above the...Bed...Held broken toys and there was a scribbled ‘Harry’s room’ there didn’t seem to be a source of light. Anger bubbled up inside of him as he turned back to Lucius and Harry. The latter was opening and closing his mouth like a goldfish while blinking out owlishly from his oversized glasses. Lucius flicked his wand sending red sparks from the tip muttering a spell as there was a strange sound from outside. The slamming of a metal door sounded and then a large man with a grey moustache came through the front door. He was a huge man whose face seemed to have melted into his chest. There was little doubt that this was the obese boys father and Draco waited to see what would happen.
“Can you believe it? Me! A lion!” Pansy gushed dropping down half on Harry’s lap and half on Draco’s “I almost had a heart attack! I thought for sure Slytherin but no, the hat said I had untapped courage! Me!”
“Thank you, Dad, Pop. I am so happy for you!” He said and Severus found himself choking up. He quickly recovered when Narcissa clapped her hands excitedly together
“Youse is not to comen too closes to Little Master Harry! Mister Dumbles of Hoggywarts! Master Harry is very frighten”
“She…It’s a female snake” Harry whispered back looking at the snake who was truly looking at him now her head tilted to one side and Harry was sure that if snakes could smile she would be smirking.
“Dobby shoulds be punishes! Dobby spoke bad about Masters but Dobby needs to save Harry potter!” Dobby wailed as he continued to hit his head against the frame until their was a twin pop and two elves Harry didn’t recognise appeared. Both of them seemed to have a bloody nose and they silently stunned Dobby and wrapped ropes around him.
“Yup, its that thing you and I do so well, though she wasn’t asking me why I threw a game, she was threatening to hex my balls off” Harry laughed at the statement moaning louder as Draco found a tight painful not in the middle of his shoulder blades and stared to work it out with his fingers. His skin felt amazing and the sponge was forgotten as he moved over him all over. “Why?”
“I believe it is rather too early for such sentimental displays” Severus said dryly as he and Remus came into the room but he had to bite back his words when not even five minutes later Remus had popped his cracker and found a ring box inside. “I am not one for romance wolf, but it would be tolerable, I suppose, if you would consent to be my husband…”
“Okay, Uncle Sev, I trust you” Harry mumbled slowly with meaning as he was handed the small vial of green potion that he himself had helped brew. Severus had helped him to get it to taste like butterscotch, at least a little, it was designed to help his digestion. Too many rich foods with the Malfoys’ had started to cause him to have a stomach ache. Remus watched him drink the potion with his strange amber eyes and Harry wondered if he was worried what it was. “A digestion potion. My stomach...Is sensitive”
“It’s not going to happen, mother has been given ministry rights of guardianship over you for a month at least, the aurors have also said that she has rights, Dumbledore doesn’t have a leg to stand on, even if he stands outside all day in the rain and father will make him stand out there. Its rude to come calling before 9 am and it has only just turned 7”
“...A passport?” Narcissa said looking to Lucius who cleared his throat speaking for the first time since arriving;
“Harry, I couldn’t give a toss what other people think of me, besides, I have you on my side…And you have me.” Draco used the hand draped over his stomach to tickle him just a little and Harry let out a snort of laughter while wiggling as much as he could without failing off the bed. “It’s us against the world, Harry…”
“Why are you ordering him about?” The third and last boy in their dorm asked his arms folding across his chest as he glared at Draco. It was clear that while the other two didn’t seem to mind Draco, or the Malfoy name, this boy had a dislike of his friend. “Death eater scum. Weasley was right, you should have been in Slytherin.”
“Yes, we shall only be going for a month or so, barely enough time to see everything but Nino has offered her and her fiancés services as guides. We will be leaving on Saturday, Harry you aren’t looking as excited as Draco…Are you not happy?”
“Enough!” Severus growled breathing heavily waving his hand so the will went still and silent. His face was coloured rather unnaturally, and his breathing laboured. “Potter…He thought I was better father material than Black? Potter wanted me…This must have been…Potter hated me…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have no doubt, but I was once a fine chaser, I will not let you win so easily, either of you!” Lucius announced with a chuckle and proceeded to roll up the white sleeves of his shirt. “Let us begin”
I hope you like this part
“And I live with those mistakes daily” Lucius said stiffly rubbing the bridge of his nose suddenly looking a lot older than he normally would. “He is a child, Severus, younger even than Draco. Did what you saw give you satisfaction at least?”
Harry watched the Yule log crackling in the fireplace his heart warm as he sat between his fathers listening to Narcissa tell the tale of the first Yule, the wedding of the winter witch and the autumn prince. They had had a small feast with just a few adult friends of the Malfoys and Harry and Draco’s friends. It was sedate compared to a muggle new year with large drunken parties. New Year was about reflection and being with those that you loved into the new year. The fire popped again sending green and purple sparks up the chimney while the story came to an end.
“Since you appear to have gotten the hang of handling your broom, Harry, how about a game of Muggle in the middle? I shall be muggle first” Lucius offered throwing the ball to Draco who caught it easily. “The object of the game is to pass the ball back and forth without the muggle catching it, if the muggle does so then the one who threw it becomes muggle”
“There are a great many things that I don’t want to do but I will do it for you, brat, now stop chopping those leaves before there is nothing left” Severus sighed and Harry was almost positive that there was something fond in his expression. “Have you decided on a name for that owl of yours?”
“Draco...” Harry whispered looking at the books, toys, and sweets again his eyes itching with a prickle of tears surprised that somebody, anybody he didn’t know would send him a present and he wondered if there was a way of sending a letter back to thank the mysterious boy.
The Jewish ladys speech was from a survivor I met at a holocaust memorial service when I was a child. I never got her name but she was an amazingly brave woman
“I can’t help it! He’s so cute, I want to squish him!”
“Oh dear oh dear...Just as I thought, you really have been through it, Harry...” The healer sucked on his teeth his hands moving down the lower part of his legs to his ankles. “Tell me does it hurt for you to walk some times? Often get cramps?
“A butterbeer, would be nice, thank-you”
“Good Morning, students! I have here your class schedules for the coming year as well as a map of Hogwarts!” Professor Flitwick said in his ever-cheerful tone making his way down the line of students handing them all the same slip of paper as Severus was his house.
“You’re mine, Dray, no matter what. You heard what Aunt Cissy and Uncle Luci said. Bella gave them information that will get rid of the dark lord. If you think about it! She has helped stop him…Or she will!” Harry said and Draco let out a warm laugh against his neck and if it was a little wet Harry wasn’t going to say anything. He rubbed circles up and down the taller boys back in the same way he had had done to him and eventually Draco pulled away wiping his eyes before flashing him a brilliant smile.
“Jammie Dodgers okay for you Harry? All I’ve got in, will have to nip to Tesco’s later...” she said a few minutes later and Harry was genuinely surprised to see her coming towards him with a small saucer of Jammie Dodgers and the drink.
“I want to, so pick.”
“Masters and Mistress, there are aurors at the gate and Dumbles from Hoggywarts!” The shrill accent sound of Rocky the butler elf said from the doorway and Draco watched as his father stiffened into what his mother described as his battle stance.
I hope that this was okay xD last part tomorrow with all the fluff you can imagine
“I had a nightmare, I’m sorry”
“Sorry, am I keeping you awake?”
“And how did you answer?”
“Right, Moony” Harry nodded blinking owlishly as another creature this one stockier with what appeared to be green hair with a bowl cut swam passed its beak like face turning to look at them. “Is that a Kappa?”
“They will send me into exile…” Draco hissed shaking his head ever so slightly as his nose twitched. A faint but familiar scent was clinging to the man in front of him. It was so faint that it was almost gone under the alpha’s husky aroma but it was there just barely. Entranced by the scent Draco stepped forward and scented the air.
“Honestly, Harry, I can’t say that I’m surprised, nothing your cousin does surprises me much anymore, but it does make me hate them all the more” Draco grumbled with feeling just as Remus came into the room. The amber eyed werewolf didn’t have the same bellowing robes that Severus did but he was brimming with joy his body so much better rested after his full moon transformations with Severus’ potion. The air crackled with his excitement his ring proudly on display on his finger.
HP POV
“Oh,” Blaise leaned against the bookcase, as Jason continued to search for whatever. “So, he told you.”
“Ron, wait!” Hermione took off and the three boys followed.
After a couple of giggling girls had gotten their drinks, they left hurriedly at the sight of Professor Snape’s glare. When they were finally alone, Snape spoke in a lowered voice.
“Good to hear.” He tried to follow up. “Hermione says you are very good in Ancient Runes and you two almost always tie in the pop-quiz.” At least that was what she said back in third year. Harry crossed his fingers in desperate hope that Knott was still taking the class.
“Would you tell your little boytoy to mind his own business.” Draco snarled.
He didn’t mean to pry for details, but Harry felt no need to be within a hundred yards from any of the Slytherin group right now and being friends with Jason could certainly complicate things.
“Hey.”
Jason pushed his hair away from his eyes, seemingly tired.
Blaise’s hands trembled badly as he kept trying to touch and remember every single part of his lover. The guilt and pain overwhelmed him as he thought of how he had damaged a person this much. Jason had always been a piece of work, but mostly because he had seemed so assured of them ending up together. While it wasn’t uncommon to marry your school sweetheart, it certainly wasn’t common to talk about it after a few months of dating. But Jason had always been different and so… confident in their relationship. Not once, had he seemed put off by Blaise’s insults, by his anger. If anything it seemed to spur him on, confirming whatever weird love notion he had held against him.
“Sorry my friend, it seems like Potter is going to be your new partner.” Theodore gurgled. “See it from the positive side of things, it could be worse. Two second later out the door and you would have had to sleep with Longbottom.”
“How many more times?” Jason snorted.
A fish shop… pet store…. Bookstore…. Smaller clothes shop… another bookstore…
What would it matter? Who would give a rats ass about her so called betrayal?
Glancing at the blond, Harry kept from replaying. Somehow knowing that Malfoy would continue when he was ready.
“We are. Somehow.”
“I… guess. Why?”
Harry couldn’t help it, he was ready for more.
“What’s going to happen to him?”
“I know it is a lot to ask, but please just accept it, for now at least?” Harry begged.
“Harry.”  Looking behind him, the group of wizards were ready to interfere. One of the men stepped forward and Aodhan started growling in displeasure.
“But, the wolf part of you was the one doing it-“
He gently pushed the blond away with a hand on his chest, but not further than they were still holding each other tightly around the waist.  “Thank you, Draco.”  Smirking, the teen answered cockily; “You’re welcome. I know I’m a good kisser.”
“You can’t and I’m not really here.” She came in and quickly closed the door behind her. Slowly she sat down beside him on the bed and Draco was filled with nostalgia of them playing in his room while their parents were downstairs chattering.
“So you became friends? Really?” Harry wondered. Remus poured him another cup to keep him quiet.
“Hey.” He announced his arrival to his two friends as they realized whom had entered the common room.  They looked to be in a rather lively discussion and Harry figured they needed time alone so he hurried towards the dorm.
“Well, Potter, since my date for some reason see the ‘fun’ in sitting with Gryffindors- which I fail to by the way- and the fact my so-called best friend abandoned me, I saw no other option than to join this side of the floor.” Blaise huffed.
The idea of sleeping with Draco for the first time was definitely a pleasing and exciting thought. He felt ready to have sex and right now Draco was the only person whom he could see this happening with.
“Arrogant?”
“-On a shelf? What does that even mean?”
“Yeah.”
“And you are okay with that? Just being a student?”
“Meddling brat… constantly…his father…”
“Why?”
“No. Well not them, but Ginny asked about Harry…” Without Hermione to back him up, even Ron didn’t seem convinced anymore. Served him right. It only took a second before Dean and Seamus practically attacked him.
“What do you mean?” Draco challenged.
“What?” Harry perplexed asked.
“Severus, you don’t hav-“
“…Do you need help?” Harry awkwardly asked as it sounded like Hermione was having trouble with the dress.
“I’m sorry. I don’t think-“
Speaking of relationships, he and Malfoy had made progress and were most of the time able to keep the conversations free of Voldemort-related topics. Of course, it also meant Harry constantly had to be careful before opening his mouth but for now it wasn’t too difficult.
“Okay, Potter. I know we aren’t exactly friends and I’ve been acting… a little…”
Before a mutter of unhappy voices could reach its peak, Harry spoke up loudly.
Neither seemed to know what to say. Severus had never actually escorted a date back to their house. Should he just say goodnight and leave? Kiss him first?
Let see how he does it.
The compartment was deadly silence as Draco friends waited in anticipation for his answer. Pansy seemed at ease, but Draco could see her fingers picking at her nail roots. A horrible nervous habit she had had since childhood.
Honestly he couldn’t find it in himself to care right now. He moved so much now that the water slouched over the tub and fled into the floor.
“My boy that is truly wonderful news. A new member of our small family here. If you wish Severus, I’m most willing to ask the schoolboard for permission to have your son live here.” The headmaster squeezed his knee in joy.
“It was just a joke…” he cried. “Don’t know why… it was just because I was the first walking by…. And everyone knows now!” He wasn’t sure if Snape even understood anything he tried to say. He wasn’t even sure what he was getting at. Everything seemed to fall apart. So many powerful memories fell to the ground and how the hell was he supposed to pick them up again?
Draco was nervous as he wrote the note and transformed it to a tiny origami bird. He waited carefully until the Professor had turned his back, before he silently gave the paper a little tap and let it soar. Slowly, the bird flew across the room and gently sat down on the golden boy’s desk.
“Yes, It had barely been a few days since the attack… You can imagine; two Gryffindors – especially one as popular as your godfather – suddenly seemed like they came out together. Just one student had to see us holding hands and the entire school knew.”
“Oh yes, sorry. Harry may I introduce you-“
Getting caught looking at a group of Slytherins he quickly turned his attention to Neville whom were looking doubtful.
“Of course.” Ron interfered.
Pansy apparently took the hesitation as enough to go on. “Exactly. Don’t you think it is a little odd how he just went from hating your guts to actually start flirting?”
“Sorry?”
“Professor Snape, I’m certain Harry didn’t go into Knockturn Alley… unless you believe he would have thought of a Christmas present for you since the beginning of the year?”
Severus simply nodded his consent and sat down once again, after making sure the headmaster had settled in the couch.
“Agh! Oh…” Draco could see the golden boy hanging with a slack jaw as he moaned in pleasure.
“Hi! I… was waiting for you, actually. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay… after, you know.” Harry pointed his eyes towards the other students in the room. He had obviously realized that Draco weren’t interested in having the other Slytherin know his parents had been here.
“I wanted you to know, that Remus Lupin was here today. I have asked him to replace Professor Bjorkfire after Christmas vacation, although he will probably settle in his personal quarters beforehand.”
“Yeah.” Harry smiled as Malfoy laid his hand on top of his. Malfoy´s hands was exceptionally warm against his own cold ones. Harry had always imagined that every part of the Slytherin would have been as cold as his silver eyes and platinum hair. But this? It was heating up his hand and left his heart galloping. The moment was unfortunately ruined when a few girls at the table next to them started giggling from behind Malfoy, and Harry could see they were watching them. Embarrassed by the public display of affection he slid his hand out from underneath and placed it on his mug. Malfoy could somehow better stand their annoying behavior and just ignored them. Instead, he kept the attention on Harry and gave a knowing smirk.
“What?” he asked coldly. Glaring at his ex, it was impossible not to notice how swollen his red cheekbone was becoming.
Draco mostly felt the need to give the older man the middle finger right about now, but instead decided to crumble the note in his hand. Giving the professor a single nod, he asked to be excused and left the classroom shortly after. Feeling the list of names in his hand gave him a strong sense of antagonism. Why did Potter believe him to just be another name? Was this list of any kind of recognition? Future lovers?
“And?”
Raising his eyebrows at him in a mocking nature, Snape continued to inconvenience his story;
“Gezz, Harry, we don’t really know him. Beside something for Quidditch, I don’t really have any idea what he would want.”
DM POV
“I understand.” And Harry really did. “I wondered SO many times what my life would be like if I had just been Harry.”
Lunch was almost over but the seventh years were trying to stretch their break as far as possible. Next period was History of Magic. No matter how much they had wished for it, Professor Binns still refused to retire – or just become a Hogwarts ghost at least – and therefore, it was still the class everyone dreaded. The Ravenclaws tried their hardest to keep awake during his ramping on the great goblin war in 1337, but even they had to give up half way through.
As much as he hated to admit it, Malfoy definitely had his attention now.
No, exams didn’t worry him.
Obviously taking a deep inhaling breath, Malfoy spoke.
This morning Draco had sat down alone at the Slytherin table. Slowly chewing on the last mouthful of yogurt parfait, he considered last night’s event. Convincing Potter to join him had been easier than he had comprehended. Digging up the last blueberry from his bowl, he pushed it aside to think. Potter weren’t exactly a player or even very popular amongst the students so Draco wouldn’t really have much competition. Although he had no idea wither or not Potter had ever considered himself gay at all. But Draco was certain of the signs he had shown. Potter was attracted to him, that was for sure. Having never heard any kind of rumors of the golden boy being gay, Draco assumed he was still in the closet or at least just getting out. Potter was clearly new to boys-kissing-boys, so Draco would probably have to do the firsts of many. Such as inviting him on a date. He could barely contain a shiver of disgust at the idea.
Thankfully, the topic of Luna’s weird creatures did not return as everyone started gathering food on their plates. While Harry waited for the potatoes to be passed, he sent a worried glance to the left, catching the eyes of Jason. He too, seemed slightly worried. And although the thought made him feel like a terrible friend, Harry hoped no one would take Luna very seriously even if she had managed to actually guess right about Jason’s heritage.
Steadily set on ignoring them, Potter got into the carriage from the other side. When the cart was loaded with students, it slowly went into motion and an uncomfortable silence settled. The ride would only take ten minutes tops but it was without a doubt the most silenced moment in Draco’s life. As if everyone tried to breathe carefully, so as not to make too much noise. Draco looked out the window, realizing it was starting to rain. Enormous wet drops smashed against the small windows. A gentle cough turned his attention to Theodore, who not so subtly tilted his head towards Potter. Right. He supposed that now was as a good time as any to start easing the tension between them.
“Yeah, in most cases he would have, but we have a great reservation over there; “Polokwane Reptiles Reservation.” We have two females there right now a few years older than him. They will surely take good care of him.”
“Really? I feared it was too…”
“Some tea, perhaps?” Albus suggested. Not even waiting for his potion Professor to answer he called upon an elf from the kitchen.
“Harry!” She said and gave him a blazing smile. “How are you?”
The idea of hurting Potter… was horrifyingly hurtful.
“I don’t believe I asked you Lupin, and don’t ever believe yourself or your opinion to be valued from me.” He practically snarled. “You made certain of that long ago.”
, boring, ordinary, goody-goody scrawny Potter, could have turned the eyes of Draco Malfoy?
“It’s okay.” Harry assured him. He didn’t have to share personal details. He had his fair share of experiences of published his personal life and it never led to anything good.
“Please don’t tell anyone!” Harry cried out.
“Not now.” Harry ignored her gaze in favour of the plain toast on his plate.
Opening his eyes, he sat up startled. He was shaking and tried to calm his heaving breath. His heart was racing at the thought of something still lurking in the dark. Looking around he saw light, but without his glasses, everything was mostly blurry shapes and colors. In front of him, an orange dot sat on his bed. He could feel the warmth of another human being. Unless Ginny had decided to join their dorm, Harry was most certain it was Ron. The color couldn’t be mistaken for anyone else. Some of the other shapes moved and Harry could see his glasses as they came closer to his face and he reached out to grasp them.
Malfoy huffed. “Are the Gryffindorks still having a hard time understanding ‘growing up’?”
“We’re the only ones left.” Harry whispered.
Again, not a single hair moved.
“Then why does it even matter?” Harry wondered.
“Harry, please, I know-“ Harry struggled harder. “I KNOW I messed up, but it wasn’t fake. What happened at the dance, afterwards-“
Harry hadn’t even come to realize that Jason only lived with one parent because they hadn’t been together. If Jason didn’t know his mother…
He felt ridiculous.
And soon, Harry was drifting off to sleep.
“How was the summer vacation? You went to Australia, right?”
“Here.” Malfoy gentle pushed his glasses upon his nose and his friends’ faces became clear. Hermione and Ron stood a few feet away. Both had odd expressions on their faces. While Hermione seemed concerned with Harry and smiled when his eyes focused on her, Ron was obviously more interested in glaring at Malfoy, who ignored the redhead in favor of Harry.
“Me?” Harry asked perplexed. “Why?”
“Yes.” Severus tried to gather his courage once more.
Smiling, Harry removed the few drops of ice left in the blond locks.
“You shouldn’t have left the house without telling me. What if Aodhan hadn’t heard you getting attacked? It could have taken us hours to find you-“
“Wow.” Harry sank deeper into his pillow, supporting his back.
For a long minute, they merely watched the other, soaking in each others’ presence as if they hadn’t spent almost seventh years practically living together. Draco looked no different than usual, but somehow Harry had missed the smaller details about him. The way his hair glowed in moonlight, lightest patch of freckles across his neck and the steal grey eyes piercing through him.  In the next second, Draco almost ran towards him and used both his hands to tilt Harry’s face towards him. Their cold lips met in a desperate motion and Harry tried not to wince when he felt the scolding tongue enter his mouth. Their breath entangled and Harry had no choice but to hang on to Draco’s shoulders, trying to keep his legs from buckling.
“Okay, Draco and I went to the Rooms of requirements and we spent the night there.”
Harry tried to relax again, and finally the strong head came through. It was quite painful compared to the fingers. He bit his lips, hoping to keep the whimpers inside, but Draco must have felt the tension roaring through his body, because he gently started stroking Harry’s waist and shushed him.
“So,” Harry tried to sound as innocent as possible. “I’m going to stay here, and Remus has promised we could spent it together.”
When Harry finally started the conversation again, it took almost twenty minutes for Blaise to regard any subject with an opinion beside the weather. Harry truly realized how intelligent the teen was. He took almost as many classes as Hermione with the exception of Muggle Studies. But Blaise could already pinpoint a few aspects of Jason and Harry’s chosen topic and he actually gave him good advice on which book – beside their usual – could help on the matter.
Entering the empty classroom, the Gryffindor was surprised to see Remus already sitting at his desk, correcting papers.
Harry could see in his eyes, the second the truth dawned on the Slytherin.
“Draco, come on!” Parkinson screeched further ahead.
“Everyone, if you could please take your seats.” McGonagall stood forward and greeted the families. “When I call your name, you will step forward from the line and onto the podium.”
“Hermione, this was Snape, he is not exactly keen on Gryffindors, remember?” Hermione just huffed and turned back to eating even though it was obvious her cheeks were a slightly darker color.
He would be catching him in no time, but where was the fun in that?
“You are already here, so you might as well go the last five meters.” Professor Snape glared.
Again, the room became quiet, except the kindling fire and Snape whom had started pacing in front of it. Harry wasn’t sure why he had called for Jason. He wasn’t even sure if he wanted to really see him right now. If he turned out to have been part of it, would Snape refuse to help him? It seemed right to protect his son from getting in trouble, although most of the times where Jason had gotten into it, his father had been the one to give him detention.
“Malfoy.”
When everyone had sat down and settled their things on the table, Snape began the lecture. Gently waving his wand, ingredients list and instructions appeared on the board. Another wave collected the necessary ingredients and placed them on the front desk. As Harry tried to concentrate on reading the potion instruction, his eyes couldn’t help but shift focus and look at the Malfoy who was also reading. Harry must have been staring a little too intensely as it was only a mere moment, before Malfoy looked up from his potions book and their eyes met.
He made it outside without the least problem and headed for the owlery. The sounds of the wind sweeping through the broken windows and the owl feathers shuddering would actually be quite scary if he didn’t know Draco was in there as well.
Malfoy casually leaned back against the wall.
“It’s just… Draco and I have known each other for years, yet I don’t know anything about him really. We have fought for years and it never got us anywhere but becoming a childish school rivalry. Now, we have a chance to let people see it is okay to change, give each other a second chance, and if I say something wrong… I’m afraid to waste my chance. To say something wrong because of our history. I wish we could just be two people meeting for the first time on our first date. No houses, just two people.” Harry said, now realizing how worried he really was becoming.
For Merlin sake, Melck. Shut up!
The widening of his eyes must have been enough for Knott because he gave a cat-like smirk before returning to his book.
As he calmed and slowed down his pace, he gently shook the mysteriously bag. It was surprisingly heavy for only three croissant, especially since the pastry was seventy-percent air. Opening it, he was hit with the delicious smell of bakery once more. Inside was the three croissants he had asked for and one of the amazing pastries he had tried for free. Beside it, a single white ruffled napkin with a rather curly handwritten note;
His friend huffed irritated, before leaning slightly closer to Draco.
“I can’t lose him. Not him. I finally have a reason to go on-“
“Harry, what is going on? Why is everybody staring at you?” Dean questioned.
Harry barely managed to look up before he had a present stuck under his nose.
Pointing his lightcolored tortous wand, he pronounced the incantation rather clearly;
“I know, but hasn’t it ever bothered you
not someone you knew. I met him overseas.”
“Whatever you may think of me, please know that, that night at the dance meant everything to me. I have never known it was possible to feel so connected to another human before and I felt so lucky it happened with you.”
Harry got his things and settled on the small corner of Snape’s desk. For a second it looked like the professor was about to object, before he continued to write. Harry was careful to be as quiet as possible, as he started his own notes on Herbology. Besides the scratching of the quills against parchment the two men sat in comfortable silence. Harry had worried Snape at some point would have had enough of him dipping his pen in the ink too much or commented on the way he licked his finger every time he turned a page, but nothing. Snape kept quiet the entire time and when it was time for Harry’s next class, he simply thanked the professor again. However, right before he closed the door, Snap called after him. Turing around the man looked conflicted.
“Hi, Harry are you okay?” Dean asked.
Merlin sake, Remus.
“Jay, I’m sorry. I really am.”
Discreetly checking if Neville or any of the other Gryffindors had noticed, harry looked behind him and got eye contact with Malfoy. Judging by the smirking face, it was definitely from him. Harry turned back to read the note once more. The dolphin boulder? It wasn’t very far from the dark forest. The boulder had gotten the name for looking like a jumping dolphin escaping from the cold lake. It wasn’t very big, but just wide enough for two people to sit on it, side by side.
“Knew? God, no.” Jason smirked almost angrily. “As far as I knew, my father was a squib. We were never very close to the wizarding world in Australia, except when I went to school. I think it was painful to him, never having experienced it, but he was happy in the muggle world so… we just stayed there.” He shrugged.
Before answering, Harry turned to Neville. “You already heard didn’t you?” he knew how much Neville hated being placed in the spotlight but right now he had to know what he was dealing with. Carefully nodding, Neville just gave him a small smile. And in fact, that was all Harry really needed from him to know where he stood.
Entering the dorm quietly, Harry got somewhat of a shock.
Harry tried his best to take action. Altering between cheering him up by playing games and distracting him, to simply staying by his side during whatever Jason was doing too. Finally, after three days of staying locked up inside the castle, the snowstorm passed. A lighter, blue sky had appeared this morning and Harry had taking advantage and hurried to breakfast so he could see his friend once more.
“Oh Harry. Sorry we didn’t hear you.” Dean said trying discreetly to cover himself up.
Small pots of Venomous Tentaculas were standing in front of them on the table. Their leaves were very disoriented, and a few branches were broken in several areas. Their assignment for today wasn’t too difficult theoretically, but physically they had to be at least three student per pot if not four. As Professor Sprout explained; the Tentaculas were becoming vicious and tried to dominate each other by breaking branches and pull off smaller parts, if they could manage. So for today’s lesson they had to keep the plants still enough until their classmates could ‘carefully’ cut off the ruined twigs. Then the plant could focus on growing new leaves instead of trying to keep the rotting branches alive.
Inside the cabin Harry greeted Aodhan and was immediately sloped in drool. Aodhan was now the size of fang and his tail was almost as large as his body. The dragon must have caught a whiff of the treats Harry had hidden because the animal started pulling on the hem of his robe.
For long time Jason continued to throw smaller rocks. He didn’t look at Harry, but seemed to be thinking about something. Harry hoped Jason didn’t feel like he couldn’t be trusted, and if Jason truly didn’t wish to bring it up, then he would stop the interfering. He just felt like something important must have crossed their path, for Jason to actually attack another student, even if that student was Draco. He still held the one cold stone in his hand that Jason had offered him and he too, threw it at the lake. At some point, Jason sighed loudly and threw the last one.
Professor Binns had already started the lesson and Harry tried to concentrate. He really did! But only a few notes had made their way on his parchment before doddles and small tick-tack-toe sketches appeared. God, how was it possible to be this boring? Harry had always been curious to know if Binns even liked the subject or he just enjoyed the time spent between the livings. Noticing the ghost float through his wooden desk, Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to be a ghost if the option ever became available. To watch your loved ones grow old and die. It seemed painful. To never get eternal rest. To never sleep, eat or touch things. Never touching others? It seemed like a punishment worse than death.
“You seem less happy than the others.”
“Are you going to sell them?”
“Thanks,” Blaise got up and clapped him on the back. “I will see you down there.”
“He is
“Okay… but my father didn’t know?”
“I know.” He mumbled. “I realize you must have been mad at me, and I actually didn’t want to face you. I’m sorry. It was cowardly done.”
“YOU didn’t think this through before making the bet?” Malfoy snorted. “That’s on you.”
“’right?” the boy didn’t look at him but after a second he nodded and Draco felt him relax once more. The head was already passed the ring muscle and he pushed in deeper. It took another minute of careful pushing before Harry groaned again. The pain passed quicker this time and Draco moved back and forth in minor movements.
“Blaise.” Jason tone had changed. Harry couldn’t help but notice the different attitudes Jason withheld. The usual uncaringly happiness it brought shifted whenever Zabini was involved. Harry took a second glance at the dark-skinned boy sitting quietly beside Malfoy.
“Ah yes, thankfully, Andrew managed to explode two cauldrons in one class, otherwise you might still have been first priority.”
“How so?”
“Oh. Well, I know he would be happy to see you.” Harry tried to sound confident.
They walked in a rather uncomfortable silence for quite a while after that. Jason wasn’t used to not liking others. He always found it possible to like everyone in a certain way. It had just always been so easy for him to make friends no matter where he went. The charms of his veela probably helped generally, but it still felt like something he could do perfectly on his own. Malfoy had been a sore spot for them for a while now. Jason didn’t trust the blond. There was something about him that screamed at Jason to stay as far away as possible and within that, Blaise too. However, he had no right to tell Blaise what to do or whom to spent time with.
“Malfoy.”
“Hmm. So you say.” Draco suddenly got a rather sultry look in his eyes. Leaning in closer to his boyfriend, he whispered hotly against his ear. “Does that mean you would lick chocolate off
“No, sir.” Draco answered honestly.
“What?” Jason grinned in delusion
Although this year had been rather quiet so far, as his parents had moved to France, staying at the summerhouse. In France, his father had better opportunities for restarting his business. While Draco never doubted his father revelation after the Dark Lord’s fall, his intention never sought further away than his money could carry him. His father had never hid the fact that it matter little, wither it was light or darkness he followed as long as his powerful position at the Ministry remained intact and his wallet was full.
“Yes.” Draco held his head high.
“Everyone saw you! Not just an entire class of Hufflepuffs but a teacher as well! Even if we don’t choose to expel you, the schoolboard-“
The older man wrinkled his eyebrows, searching through the masses. “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any giraffes.”
Laughing Harry was surprised as a brown owl almost landed in his pumpkin juice. A small note was attached to the leg and it impatiently stretched it out for him to gather. Harry took the note after giving the owl a single cornflake to munch on.
“You should probably get some warm clean clothes on before you get a cold.” The older boy suggested.
Suddenly Malfoy eyes shone a bit more than usual and Harry got a chilling feeling he wasn’t going to like it. Without another word, Malfoy shoved his finger in front of Harry’s face. Looking from the finger to the silver eyes and back, Harry hadn’t gotten a clue what he wanted.
“Your parents? I mean, It won’t… but we will figure it out, you know? We take one day at a time. Besides, if anything your parents were Gryffindors right? Wouldn’t they be happy if you are happy?”
“Chiss mey!” He demanded keeping his lips gauntly puckered, feeling like a bloated fish.
Finally, after what seemed like an hour, Snape spoke.
Leaving the bathroom he noticed Dean was the only other in the room. He was leaning back against his bedpost, reading a book.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Esben quickly explained. “I don’t think you are jealous or anything, I just don’t think I would be that easy around Parkinson if Malfoy was my boyfriend.”
“I wonder if my parents would have accepted me. If it would bother them if I was dating- erhm… someone whom weren’t in Gryffindor. My parents and Sirius as well, gave up their lives for me. I just.. I just can’t disappoint them. I think my mom would have perhaps, but I know my dad was all about house pride and or at least Sirius was a little short-tempered. How could I possibly continue my life down this path if I knew they would have wanted something else for me?”
Maybe… maybe a little harder. He would squeeze his cheeks.
Enchanted snow was falling from the ceiling and spreading out across the Great Hall at breakfast. Harry was sitting and trying his best not to fall back to sleep. Yawning for what seemed like the hundredth time, he grabbed the nearest pot of coffee, pouring it up to the rime of the cup.
“Yeah, but that is small compared to what I want to do” Harry mumbled thinking of the first Wizarding tent he had been in at the world cup. He had been in more since then and he had to admit that he was blown away every single time.
“You’ll be great, you’re too stubborn not to be awesome at something you want to do…Think about it! We could be the next Wyrd Sisters…I would look awesome with a mohawk” George laughed running his fingers through his very red hair and Harry couldn’t stop the ugly snort that escaped even though he slammed his hands over his mouth in a vain attempt to catch it. Draco laughed as well all knowing that a ginger mohawk would not be as nice as Tommy’s the lead guitarist from the Wyrd Sisters was.
“Harry, are you still…Uncomfortable with Remus and Sev?” Draco asked getting him to hover at the farthest edge of the pitch and Harry shook his head spluttering,
“I finished early and decided to come watch. Hey guys” Remus said nodding to everyone. Harry could tell that the man was awkward. Things had been very awkward between them all since Remus and Severus had deepened their relationship. Harry had felt strange around them. He didn’t want to feel that way, but he couldn’t stop Vernon’s voice in his head. He hadn’t even been able to tell his mind healer about it and he had been able to talk about almost everything else. “Its okay that I came, right?”
Narcissa Malfoy had always considered herself to be a strong capable witch. Little to nothing could scare her, but her sister Bellatrix Lestrange was the one thing that scared her like nothing else. However, she stood proud, her back straight, and her eyes set and determined as she gazed up at the looming, chilling building that was Azkaban. It had been months of planning, but finally she was here, and she was going to see what her sister knew.
Winter was coming to an end and they were entering spring with a bounce. The snow was melting from the garden and although he was sad to see it go Harry had to admit he was looking forward to warmer weather and he couldn’t deny that he shared Narcissa’s enjoyment at seeing the new flowers breaking their way lazily out. With the end of the holidays meant the return of lessons and his healing. He had enjoyed the break from his mind healing, and he had been dreading starting again but he had a lot to unpack. The knowledge that Dobby had gotten out of the hospital somehow was troubling and that feeling was growing the longer he was in the wind.
“How did you enjoy France, Harry?”
I hope that this stupid little story made somebody smile at least a little
“It wasn’t your fault mama, he was very rude” Draco huffed his nose wrinkling in a cute way Lucius’ did when presented with something he didn’t like and Narcissa forgot her anger at the young healer as she smiled and ruffled her son’s long hair.

“What happened a few days ago?”
The monster an Alpha snake-shifter named Voldemort wanted to bind himself to the Omega child causing his parents to recoil in horror and disgust. They refused and sent him away from their home, sadly the snake-shifter refused to take no for an answer and one night when the moon was full, he slipped into the Potter home and slaughtered both Lord Potter and his Lady. He attempted to spirit the boy away into the night only to be destroyed by Lord Potter’s brother in all but blood Sirius Black. Black was a Dog-Shifter and a fierce and loyal friend. Sadly, the cost of defending Harry from the monster was his life. Voldemort’s final attack was to poison the dog-shifter with his fangs.
“Promise not to tell anyone?”
“Remus!” He gasped with happiness looking at his friend. Remus Lupin was a wolf shifter, he lived most of his life out in the forbidden forest outcast from polite society for being a lone wolf. He was an Omega, stolen when he was only a babe and forced to mate with a savage beast named Fenrir Greyback. For almost twenty years Remus had suffered under his mate and his pack until one day he had slain the alpha as he slept, after Fenrir had tried to snatch another child Omega because Remus had failed time and time again to produce an heir. Remus hadn’t been punished for his crime, but he had not been accepted back into society either, people looked at him with suspicion and scorn treating him no better than a rabid dog, but Harry had grown to like him. Remus was kind and gentle even with the life he had lived, and he would spend hours in the forests with him when he was collecting firewood. He had taught him about plants, herbs, and the magic of words. Nobody else had bothered teaching him to read or write however Remus had carefully taught him, first by writing in the mud in the forest and then by sneaking him books to read.
On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me...
“And...And you...” Harry smiled though it appeared to be forced and his hand squeezed at his when he heard the sound of boy’s voices. Draco turned and saw a large boy, about the same size and shape as a young hippo, wadding towards the house with a group of pasty faced youths following behind. “Dudley...”
“Albright…”
Crisp white lined paper was inside and with his pale eyebrows knitting together he pursed his lips and pulled it free of the envelope unfurling it slowly as if expecting a curse to spring out. It wouldn’t be the first time, that was when he was five years old, though even Dobby would have checked for that now. Nothing happened and Draco caught sight of the name scrawled at the bottom of the page. ‘Harry'. Eagerly he shifted his eyes to the start of the letter and began reading;
“My dear Lady Malfoy, what an unexpected honour to have you here. When the message came, I thought that there was a mistake. You make even Azkaban a brighter place by your beauty, Lady Malfoy”
“Two turtle doves” Harry muttered his eyes widening as he started at the birds in the cage. They were admittedly very pretty birds to say that they were closely related to the common pigeon. Their bodies were a soft grey that almost appeared to be blue while their wings and necks were speckled with browns. Their eyes were watchful blinking up at him from the ornate white cage they were in. They cooed in a gentle way that Harry found almost soothing but he had absolutely no idea what he was going to do with them. Hedwig wouldn’t like sharing the smallest bedroom with two more feathered friends and that was even if the Dursley’s didn’t flip at the very sight of them.
“I wrote to my Godfather, Severus is not the most social of men and he has a tendency to think ill of everyone however he told me that your father was well liked at school, father confirmed that although he didn’t know him personally James Potter was popular amongst his peers. Even Severus said that he loved those that he thought of as friends dearly” Harry looked at the photo of him with his parents a warm bubble in his hear “Severus was much kinder towards your mother however, he said and I quote him here ‘Lily on the other hand was the most talented witch I have had the pleasure of knowing. She was particularly fond of charms and care of magical creatures. She had the ability to be willing to see the best in everyone she met’. He went on to say that they would have loved you wholeheartedly while they had you. I am once again sorry that it wasn’t much however mother and father have agreed to help me find out more about their time at school for you. Father is on the board of governors for Hogwarts so I am positive he will find something more for you”
“I won’t” Harry answered, but he knew that it was a little bit of a lie. The snake had sounded serious when it had mentioned the Ancient One and a shiver moved quickly down his back. Severus ruffled his hair with long, bony fingers and then together they made their way up the stairs of the temple enclosure to the Quetzalcoatl. It was a beautiful creature with a head the same size and shape of a lion but with scales that had the shape of feathers in bright colours however it just lounged around the branch of a tree singing dirty limericks as it swished its gigantic tail back and forth. Once or twice Harry was sure it looked at him but then let out a hiss of
“Yes father, he wrote me to thank me for the birthday gifts I sent him and...He is rather more interesting than Pant...Pansy” Draco corrected himself at the last minute, his mother found his nick name for his oldest and perhaps dearest friend as funny his father however thought it rude to speak of a woman like that even one like Pansy.
“A daughter, ma’am, not even four years old” Kingsley answered with a nod helping her climb the slippery wet stairs that led to the front gates of Azkaban. It was a place void of magic meaning that the only way in an out was through muggle means. The dark spectres of the Dementors, guards of Azkaban, was felt more than enough to guard the souls within. Narcissa shrugged, a cold feeling of dread washing over her the closer they got to the building.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry, Pansy my I introduce Harrison Black? He is the son of my mother’s cousin, Harrison this is my oldest friend Etain Viola Pansy Parkinson” Draco said and Harry flushed under the stare he was getting not knowing how he was meant to act when being introduced, more confused when Pansy held out her hand to him.
“These are black birds?” Harry asked looking at the black birds in the cage. They were thinner than the Doves sleeker with black shiny feathers that seemed to be almost blue when looked at in a certain light. Their eyes were bright blue and seemed to have the same intelligence as an owl. He had to admit that he had never known what a calling bird was since hearing the song and he wasn’t sure if he was disappointed or not that they seemed rather...Not what he was expecting. “They are just black birds right?”
“No, thank you, La...Nar...Cissa, I’ve already had so much” Harry said surprised by the frown he received and for a moment he was worried he had offended her.
“I’m surprised the female Weasly didn’t return”
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm back! I can't promise daily updates at the moment but I will try to get them out in a quick fashion
“And you Professor, Dad has told me a lot about you.” Harry said managing to rein in his emotions and sound collected and proper in the way the Malfoy’s had taught him. It was okay to be nervous and even scared but never let anyone see it. Severus had spoken of the Professor a few times while they had been working on the potions and Remus had mentioned her even more, though his tales were mostly of her catching him and his father and their friends out of the dorm after curfew. “And Pops”
Following Harry’s directions they eventually reached the centre of the maze and were amazed to find that the fountain had been changed to shoot chocolate milkshake from the nuzzle with glasses being held out by house elves, all kinds of desserts and treats were on the stone stools. There was a reward for the team for the fastest time and although they lost out to Blaise, Theo, and some other purebloods they did come second and each received a silver token with Samhain written on one side and the Malfoy crest on the other.
“Is this educational or pleasure?” Severus asked after a few moments watching and was surprised when he saw Lucius give a sheepish expression turning to face him and fixing his hair with his hands.
“Dear Draco, thank you so much your present! I loved it! I don’t have any of the books, in fact I didn’t have any books about the magical world. I didn’t know it was real, I always thought that magic was just in stories” Draco blinked at those words unable to understand how Harry Potter couldn’t know about magic. It didn’t seem believable that Harry would be brought up in the muggle world. “My family doesn’t like me even talking about magic, my neighbour Mrs Figg is a squib, but I didn’t know until she caught me reading the book you gave me. She let me borrow her owl to send this letter. Sorry for rambling...Um...If you want to write back, can you send your letters to Mrs Figg? Sorry, if you don’t want to write...”
“I would be upset, not because you weren’t a Slytherin a different house wouldn’t change anything, but because we wouldn’t be together” Draco drifted off slowly a thoughtful look coming to his face as he gave a small grin humming “All Malfoys have been in Slytherin...But maybe I could change it, father refuses to tell me how the houses are picked but, I’m pretty smart, I bet I could make Ravenclaw too”
“If that’s what you wish for. Jinxie ‘ere asked me to serve yer for one year starting from today. Anything yer need, I’ll be around, if yer want me to find summet, just shout my name, Ernest…Now get me outta this ‘ere box” Ernest grumbled, and Harry quickly set the box down and a tiny man dressed in doll sized brown trousers and a puffy shirt came out. He stood less than twelve inches high but unlike the elves he had hair and a ruddy sort of complexion. All his features looked perfectly humanoid expect for his ears which were a little big and pointed.
“The soldiers wouldn’t think me brave! They will laugh at me as they always do” The bat puzzled this for a moment and then flew down to sit upon the head of Boris.
“So, Potter, I heard that you went to China”
“Professor Snape, will you tell me what happened?”
“And from the way my dear husband was carrying on last night you are a natural at it. I’m sure when you have spent more time with us you will be as enthusiastic as my Dragon” Narcissa smiled sipping her wine as the trio spoke back and forth. Draco was growing increasingly more animated as he spoke, his hair flopping around his angular face while his hands were moving around as if mimicking the movements of aa broom. His cheeks had gained a pink flush and his grey eyes were sparkling. Harry didn’t understand what they were talking about but he did like seeing Draco so happy.
“You are the care of and your magical signature is needed to open it and read it” Tormuld said with the same kind of bored indifference the Goblins seemed to show everyone they served at the bank and Harry wondered if Dumbledore knew how much he was disliked.
“Just…A little nervous”
Pushing on his glasses Harry followed her yellow gaze and saw a brown and ginger owl sitting on the windowsill peering at him with bright ginger eyes. Confused, knowing the post for the family went to a post elf, Harry slipped out of bed and padded to the window to open it. The owl clicked its beak holding out a leg with a letter attached and flew off as soon as Harry took it. His name was scrawled untidily on the front with large blotches of ink smeared here and there. It didn’t look like an adult writing and slowly he tugged it open. Inside was a single sheet of folded parchment paper and he slowly unfolded it finding the words on the inside smudged but still legible, albeit barely,
“He’s just gone to Romania to play with Dragons or something!” Fred or George said while the other nodded. Conner gave a laugh running his fingers through his hair again as his teammates came out of the changing room chatting happily. They all looked relaxed for having lost a game and Harry admired that, a lot.
“Or at the very least a petting zoo”
“How unfortunate that your parents seem not to have installed manners in you, at your age, I am sure they will be willing to rectify that immediately. Now boys, come with me, Harry, Draco have fun with your friends. There is a team challenge in the maze that you might enjoy. A scavenger hunt”
“Then trust me, mother, father, Severus and Lupin won’t stop until they figure this out, I promise” Draco promised him his lips ghosting over his forehead, over the scar and for the first time since it started the pain seemed to fizzle out and he let out a soft sigh and closed his eyes.
“Well! I bet that’s never happened before” Chao-Xing giggled as the rest of the sorting went off without a hitch with only two more students being sorted.
“So…You really are…Harry Potter?” A girl, Chao-Xing Chang, who had been sorted before them asked with wonder from Penelope’s side. As if realising that she was staring the girl flushed and then held out her hand for him to take. She was a pretty girl with short black hair and a round face. Her accent threw him off more than a little, but only because he was used to Nino and her thick Japanese accent. “Um sorry, I’m Chao-Xing Chang. Most people call me Cho…’Cause they can’t be bothered to learn my name.”
“Without question, Thistle” Narcissa nodded as she rose from her seat placing some money onto the silver plate that had appeared on the table. The coins vanished immediately replaced with a yellowed piece of paper. “Come then, Children”
lupin has appeared...briefly....i hope this was okay
“No! No he won’t! Because you won’t be going back to them! Mother and Father won’t let them! You will never have to be with them again!”
“But she has not stopped our Dragon from speaking to the boy and has even allowed him use of her owl”
“Not being in Slytherin…”
“Right Dray!”
“Yes! Thank-you!” Harry squeaked almost as loudly as Flitwick not knowing how to talk to the giant of a man. Excitement tingled at his spine, however. Since learning about Japanese Magic with Nino he wanted to know about all magic around the world and how different it might be. Kingsley gave him a smile and a bow of the head.
“Do you think they will let us start real magic straight away? I’ve only practiced a few spells, I’ve read all my books though, I wonder what sort of teacher Ninomiya is? She looks really young. Like she only just graduated. Quirrell looks sick, I’m glad we don’t have muggle studies this year” Chao-Xiang said without pausing for breath her thick Scottish buzzing around the table and Harry swallowed a piece of bacon about to tell her about Nino when a flurry of gasps filled the hall and some students started pointing upwards towards the high windows. Harry turned to look and smiled as he saw the owls flying into the great hall packages and letters attached to most. Harry spotted Hedwig easily against the sea of dark coloured owls and she immediately spotted him and came flying down followed by Draco’s owl who had a package tied to his foot. Hedwig had a small parcel, a letter, and a similar package to Draco’s. Harry recognised the messy scrawl on the top of the small parcel as belonging to Chuck and he took it first carefully untying the twine around it. The brown paper fell open to show a leather-bound book with a guitar etched into the front. He smiled tracing the pattern lightly before opening it up and found that the pages were all music sheets aside from the first which had more of Chuck’s scrawl on it.
“Come on, Harry, let’s get your trunk onto the train.” Remus said taking one side and Harry took the other trying to ignore the Weasley Matriarch shouting about manners and Malfoys. He glanced at his Pseudo-Aunt and Uncle who were helping Draco with his things very pointedly ignoring the whispers that Harry had just noticed. Parents all over the station were clearly warning their children about the evil Malfoy’s. The thought made him both angry and want to laugh. The Malfoys were traditional, yes, but they were the most loving family he had ever met.
“Yeah, okay.” Harry slowly got under the covers as well. Whispering goodnight to each other, the boys were quiet. Harry couldn’t hear if Jason had fallen asleep but he himself spent a long time staring up at the ceiling of silver, wondering if Blaise had any idea how deeply the boy depended on him.
He didn’t. The dark teen continued to eat and read the book he had brought to the table.
Harry was happily eating a big brunch, feeling as if he hadn’t eaten in ages. Neville sitting next to him was not hangover either and they amused themselves by watching the struggling students sit done and trying not to throw up in their porridge.
“No. Not now.” He turned back to his breakfast but didn’t even manage a single bite as the woman dug her nails even deeper.
Chuckling slightly the man leaned closer to look Severus straight in the eyes, his icy blue owns twinkling with booth sadness and warmth.
“Aha. And that would mean?”
Harry couldn’t help but wonder if it was because of him. It sounded like Malfoy was truly trying harder and the idea made him feel lightheaded, almost… fuzzy and warm inside. Trying to keep his friends from seeing him, he felt a smile spreading across his face. Looking discreetly towards the Slytherin table he searched for the blond boy. As he finally found him, Harry’s face split into a big smile and he tried his hardest to turn his gaze from the boy before anyone noticed. Malfoy seemed shocked at the smile he sent him and he didn’t recover before Harry had looked away again. He couldn’t believe Malfoy actually had stood up for his friends like that. It seemed so un-Malfoy-ish. But if he continued like this, Harry could see them becoming friends, or something more, faster than he expected.
The pair panted in union, as their breath was the only heard sound in the bathroom.
Chuckling the round man looked a few lines down, finally pulling out a black suit. Harry instantly loved it.
Looking back at his friends, he simply answered by giving a thumb towards Blaise and his friends.
Shakingly crying, Draco smiled relieved, sounding as if he could breathe for the first time.
“Ouch!” He exclaimed and tried to lift his hand to examine the cause. But even though his hand felt heavy another force was obviously holding it down. Carefully turning his head as not to increase the pain, he saw a very recognizable Slytherin sitting beside him.
“My eyes.” The boy smiled fondly. “Thankfully, brown is the most common color amongst humans.”
“You can drink this one as well, Lupin. It is not the wolfbane potion, but simply a mild pain reliever for the formation.”
“I’m sure he will love it.” Harry smiled confidently.
“Well hello there!” Fred came down from the stairs, George right behind him. George was still looking over a few papers before handling them back to Ronda.
After that, they didn’t bring up Malfoy again, but continued to discuss the egg’s progress and how Hagrid’s other ‘pets’ were doing. When they finally finished their tea, the sun had set and Hagrid believed it was best for him to be escorted back to the castle.
“I think Nino is awesome” Draco said stiffly, and Harry tried his best not to smile too wide at the flush that was in the pale cheeks. Draco’s little crush on Nino seemed to have faded over the months he had been with him, but he supposed that it was still there bubbling away under the surface. Harry couldn’t say he blamed him. Nino was attractive, objectively, but he didn’t have a crush on her even if she was nice and smelt good.
“Albus? What is going on?”
“Fred! George! Get yourselves over here this minute!” She howled her voice ringing around the station harshly drawing the attention of the crowd. The twins shot them slightly embarrassed looked and slunk over to their mother, the young girl peeking out and staring directly at Harry.
“Yes…” Harry saw a small brown snake laid near the glass close to him and slowly he made his way over and cleared his throat focusing on the snake before whispering “Good morning”
“For you to practice on! You were pushed around by these muggles and you couldn’t do anything about it. Now you can push them around! Even if you don’t use magic you can punch them” Draco said grinning from ear to ear as he held up his hand and punched the Dudley shaped dummy sending it rocking back and forth and Harry grinned tentatively pushing the Vernon one sending it bumping into Petunia.
“What are you all doing out here?” The fat monk said with a happy sort of voice smiling at them fondly while Nick looked at them all and beamed.
“But why...If you took him in why would he hate you so much?” Harry was so surprised that Lucius treated them with a maturity that most people he knew didn’t. He didn’t fully understand what had happened in the war but he did believe Lucius when he said that what he had done was a mistake. There was something honest about the elder blonde as he spoke. He might not have learnt about the Wizarding war but he had learnt about the first and second muggle war and that had told him that people made mistakes.
“Yes, dear, the Malfoy’s have a small chateaux on the outskirts of the wizarding town we will floo there and then visit the town”
Draco ran to his bedroom and threw open his door with a burst of accidental magic. Although he was truly horrified by what he had learned from Harry he couldn’t deny that he was excited about seeing him for the first time and he wanted to make a good impression. His walk in wardrobe was filled with clothes mostly robes and suits but he had a few casual clothes and he quickly decided on a simple pair of black dress trousers, a t-shirt, and a bottle green shirt. He ran a comb through his hair and then put on some dragon hide shoes. Once done he went back down finding his mother waiting for him dressed in a long light blue dress with flowing sleeves, the outfit made her look ethereal more so with her hair down in light waves around her shoulder.
“Draco will be fine, Mr Lupin”
Urgh...Narcissa is so totally OOC sorry >.< but I really wanted her to be sweet in private in contrast to what she is in public >.<
“I wish you a very happy new year, please take this bread that you might always have something to eat in the coming year and this coal so that you might always have heat”
“And I would rather hear you, please continue…” Narcissa opened the book where it had been saved by a magic marker and held it to him. Lucius was too polite to roll his eyes or smirk but Harry could sense it and he smiled into his bed covers as once again Lucius started reading his deep baritone washing over him in waves. The sound of Lucius speaking and the warmth of Draco settled beside him made him drift easily to sleep were he dreamt of talking Bats.
“Um…No…” Harry shook his head. He wanted to see dragons. Of course, he did, but honestly, he was terrified more so when a painted dragon on the map turned to wink at him. His eyes moved away from the dragon to a yellow area, which according to the map was closest too them, and he gasped seeing a horse with large golden wings. “Is that a Pegasus?”

“I see, well then you shall have more time for research. The Malfoy Library is at your disposal and if you feel the need to rearrange things to make yourself feel more at home then do so” Lucius’ stopped speaking as an alarm went off on both his and Severus’ wands. “Harry, it is time for your potions. We shall have a light lunch and discuss it later”
“Look kid, it’s like this, I stay around for a year, you don’t lose anything, marble falls down the back of a sofa, I get it for you, your socks get darned, your shoes get shined, your pillow smells like lavender, a coin slips out your pocket? You will find it on the counter. Just think of me as a good luck charm. You don’t gotta worry about it. If I do my job you won’t even know I’m here unless you want a little story read or a shadow play, I do a mean shadow play about a tailor” A little hand was pressed on his cheek and Harry was almost certain that the brownie winked at him before vanishing again. This time he didn’t reappear, and Harry was sure that he should feel nervous.
“Of course, you will all need the basics. I expect you all to do well. You will not be given special treatment.”
Remus was dozing on Severus’ small sofa when the potions master entered his private rooms fifteen minutes after sending Harry and Draco off with the twins. It was perhaps something he would regret sooner rather than later; however, it would be greatly remiss of him if he were to stop Harry Potter from causing some mischief in Hogwarts. With that thought in mind Severus paused at the door to his rooms simply gazing at the other man. Remus wasn’t asleep, his breathing patterns told him that much, however his eyes were closed his eyelashes, the same brown as his hair, splayed over his pale cheeks. The thin moustache he had been sporting was thankfully gone for the most part. His threadbare robes added a splash of colour to the potion masters’ dark rooms and Severus felt his heart swell at the sight before he crushed the feeling down, cursing at becoming a romantic. His eyes moved from the worn face of his love to the photos he had now perched on his fireplace. Harry and Remus laughing in the snow in the largest their hands waving out from the frame while in the other Lily and James beamed out at him.
“I forget how little you know of our world sometimes Harry. Do you know of the Summer King and his spring maiden?” Remus asked both ignoring Draco who was exhausting himself gushing over how accurate his pirate outfit was. It was truly an amazing thing if Harry were honest with a tri-corner hat and a cutlass that appeared to be real. The sleek blue tailcoat hugged his frame and he even had a fake wooden leg that when attached made his real leg seemingly vanish.
“His father was an excellent Quidditch player” Narcissa remembered with a little bit of a frown. She would have been a few years ahead of James Potter but they were distantly related and everyone knew of James’ love of the sport. “I’m sure he will love them, Draco, but do as he says, send it to this Figg woman, if his family truly doesn’t like magic then its best that you don’t provoke them. Muggles are irrational creatures”
“Take Dobby and put him somewhere quiet please, he is rather hysterical” Lucius sighed and Severus knew that his friend wished he could just give the elf clothes but he knew too much about the Malfoy family. “The last thing Harry needs is to be left with Dobby for any length of time. Do you have to report back to Dumbledore?”
“You must be a black, nobody but a black has that hair, how do you do?” A polite male voice said to his right and Harry looked but only found himself looking at the painting of a short fat knight holding a banner with a silver serpent on it. Harry stared in confusion until the knight twitched his nose and gave a little sneeze. “Sorry about that, its the feathers in this damn helmet!”
“Six”
I hope that this was okay!
“I yield”
Draco Malfoy was lazing on his bed flipping through his mothers copy of advanced potions. Lady Narcissa Malfoy wasn’t as proficient as his God father was at the subject but she had been the best in her year and her talent and enthusiasm for the subject had rubbed off on her son and it gave him something to do while his parents were busy and it stopped him from worrying that his gift to Harry had been rejected or worse still met with scorn. His father had told him that it was likely, that Harry would have been brought up believing the Malfoy’s to be as bad as Voldemort, and not to expect friendship but he had still felt compelled to buy and send the gifts.
Much good it did him as he was almost sure that the mate his fox wanted was dead by now. He had been years since he had seen him in the woods. A raven-haired green-eyed beauty dressed in rags with dirt over his face. A vagabond no doubt only clinging to life then and who would no longer be alive now. It was unfair, it truly was. He hadn’t meant to find his mate in the woods in passing so many years ago. He had been riding alone for the first time and his horse had thrown a shoe sending him flying from its back and into a puddle of murky water. Not wanting to admit that he had been thrown from his horse he had looked around for the river he knew to be nearby. Following his nose hadn’t been much use when all he could smell was the dirty water covering his expensive clothes but eventually that scent had faded allowing him the scent of a breeze over the ocean on a warm summer’s day mixed with the sweet scent that came with omegas.
“Come in, child”
“Oh, my dear sweet Harry, those muggles will pay for how they have treated you, I will make sure of it” She told him softly and Draco let out a laugh saying;
“Yes, mother, I was thinking of sending him some more books, I have some of those old Quidditch books I thought he might enjoy”
“Did you have a family?” Harry swallowed hoping that he wasn’t asking too many questions. Mrs Figg didn’t seem to be angry however and she gave a nod saying;
(See the end of the chapter for
“They are a very sensitive flower Harry; they tend only to respond well to the person that planted them” Lucius said softly from where he was walking behind them. “But it seems that you have a softer touch than Draco, if you enjoy flowers then you should talk to Narcissa, I’m sure she would be delighted to have somebody share her interest”
“I said I would be with Harry, no matter what. I’m really surprised by Pans, who would have thought she would be in Gryffindor?”
“My father left you some money and a letter in his will” Harry told his former teacher softly when he realised that they had slipped into silence. He reached into his pocket with his free hand and slipped the shrunken letter across the table.
“Good day, Jinx” Lucius chuckled as Narcissa cast a feather light spell onto Harry and then carrid him from the room with Draco following after.
“Little Masters Harry!” Jinx gasped her eyes almost comically wide before she popped away to fetch Narcissa who had been heading to her nursery to tend to her roses. The matriarch of the Malfoy family appeared a moment or two later holding to Jinx.
“My husband” Narcissa smiled a relaxed smile full of warmth and love that she only showed to her family. Draco knew that most people thought his parents marriage had been political in nature but Draco knew that it was a love match first it was fortunate that their parents had agreed to the match. “Read your letters Draco, you have been incredibly patient”
“Just showing Harry and Draco around, Nick…”
“Harry, those that matter know, those that don’t, well they simply don’t matter. My mother made me realise that. I have always been a Malfoy Harry; I have always had people like Albright thinking the worst of me because of it.” Draco informed him with a careless shrug his voice causing his chest to vibrate loudly. Harry had already known this though Draco had never gone into much detail, Pansy had told a few stories about her own childhood and the bullying she had received, and he had guessed Draco had had much of the same. It was hard to hear his friend talking about it though and he rubbed his nose lightly against his chest. “The first time I had something like that happen was when I was younger, about five, mother took me to a park, I wanted to play with some other children, their parents wouldn’t let me play with them. They snatched them away. I remember crying, I was only incredibly young, I didn’t know about the war and the dark lord or why adults hissed at me. Mother found me crying holding my Pigmy puff stuffed toy in the middle of a now empty playground. I sobbed as I told her what had happened, and she told me that I wasn’t to blame. Mistakes in the past cast shadows over the future. It wasn’t fair, she said wiping my eyes, and I wouldn’t understand for a long time but one day I would have friends who wouldn’t care about the shadows. The next day I was introduced to Pansy. Growing up I always thought I would only have friends with ‘Dark’ children. Then I wrote to you and you became my greatest friend. I don’t need the world to like me, Harry.”
“Severus, you’re early”
“Promise? Promise that I will come home for Yule?”
“Yes! Yes, very good! Take a point for Gryffindor…Now, Harry…Swish and Flick…Your father Remus was an excellent charms student...And I see you have his grace! Very good now combine the spell with the movements…Wing-Gar-di-um Levi-o-sa!”
“Yup a fluffy scary flower petal” The twins and Seamus laughed reaching out to ruffle at his hair and Draco stuck his tongue out at them his cheeks flushing just a little. At this rate he would be a Hufflepuff before he was at school with Harry smiling at him like that though he decided that he didn’t care.
“Of course! Come on Harry! The party is next week!”
“Anything you want, Gin”
“I think they will be happy to allow you” Lucius chuckled “It is rather satisfying even if a little common” Lucius laughed as they walked over to the dummies and Severus removed his outer robe. Although he had come to teach potions maybe it would be a good thing to punch out the stresses of the day on the effigies of those that had caused so much harm to the son of his best friend. The boy he had grown to care for.
“Remus, this is a surprise. Nice to see you again.” The older professor said looking between the two men with a grey eyebrow lifted. “Mr Malfoy, Mr Snape a pleasure to meet you both.”
“Filius I need you to come through, there is a matter of great importance” Dumbledore said quickly and soon enough the small professor was in the room. His hair was still shaped into the strange bowl cut and he was pin striped trousers and a jacket that ended on his rotund stomach.
Thank you all for your kind words about my father. It has been extremely hard, he was my friend as well as my dad and his death was so sudden. He had always been as healthy as a horse, he had no health problems that made him high risk for Covid and he wasn’t even old, only just turned 65 when he passed. Paul was only 33 though he had underlying health conditions. The fact that even now people flaunt the rules make it so much harder sometimes…Its like a slap to the face that people who don’t seem to care don’t get sick and those that tried their best get it and die. Sorry for my rant!
“Wow!”
“You speak like its alive”
“We saw Cheshire cats in France. They were really creepy” Harry hummed as the Kelpie swam away and he remembered the purple vanishing cat with a huge grin. “Was Lewis Carroll a Wizard?”
“If you want it...”
So...In canon it seems that all the teachers have different ideas on the structure of their lessons, there isn’t any rhyme or reason, so this is just Nino’s way.
“Well, those…Muggles…Have said a lot of things to you Harry, and not even one of them is true” Draco pointed out as they reached the study they had been in with Nino earlier that day. “Sev is still Sev and Lupin is still Lupin. Why should who they are with be anyone else’s business? In truth Harry, I think more people are going to focus on Lupin being a werewolf and Sev being a former Death Eater over who they go to bed with. But don’t think about those muggles or anybody else! Be happy! This weekend they will be your fathers”
“Draco, you have some letters”
“What are we doing today?” Draco asked with excitement that Harry started to feel even when Nino smirked before answering.
“Professor Dumbledore was indeed a gifted Wizard; however, his methods were not considered suitable for a headmaster at Hogwarts, and Headmistress Sinistra has proven herself to be a great replacement, now no more questions? Jolly good, let us go” McGonagall ignored Hermione’s waving hand and the look that clearly stated she had a million more questions and turned smartly on her heel and walked to the double doors of the main hall.
“There is a great many breaks and fractures, Lord Malfoy, one or maybe two have been treated but several have been left to heal on their own. Okay Harry, I’m going to do another spell but this time on your eyes, Lady Malfoy said that you were hoping to get rid of your glasses, but now I need you to look at me...Okay, that’s it Harry don’t blink...”
“That’s a good boy, Little Master! Youse is gonna be okay now” It said and Harry had the feeling that the little creature was a female.
“I would say that it was agreeable, Harry...But never throw another game, I want to beat you, but I want you at your best, I don’t want or need pity” Draco huffed and Harry rolled his eyes flicking the pointed nose of his former school rival growling.
“Is that allowed?” Harry asked happily. They had seen Hogwarts on their trips to Hogsmeade, but they had never been inside. He had been thinking that he would only get to see the inside when they started in September. Draco had been to the castle before with his father when he was younger but had only been in the main hall and the headmaster’s office and he couldn’t really remember much of the trip.
