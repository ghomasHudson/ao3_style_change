now, they strolled aimlessly down diagon - a bag on pansy’s arm and their stomachs pleasantly full. they had stopped in at one of pansy’s favorite cafe’s, and she had forced him to eat a double chocolate chip muffin, expressing how much she knew that he had liked these once upon a time. he ate it dutifully, and smiled with a mouthful of chocolate, complimenting the texture and flavor, despite not being able to taste anything. it had tasted grey, as most things did nowadays, all color and brightness and joy had been sapped from draco’s world - but the last thing he wanted was to be a bother to his friends.
“oh my god, if we have sex will you stop talking?” harry interrupted draco, throwing his arms up in exasperation.
but now, harry is smiling up at draco as if he hung the moon and the stars with his bare hands, just for him. now, that void closes - and draco feels somewhat complete for the first time in a very long time.
he sits up, swallowing down his nausea and ignoring the pounding in his head. his entire body hurts, but the pain in his chest trumps any headache or hangover. draco stares blankly ahead, unseeing.
harry bit down the urge to burst into the living room and tell draco that his lyrics were shit and that singing was out of tune.
the fire is a slow burn, crackling with tension and growing hotter and wilder as each moment passes. harry watches with slightly parted lips as the flames grow, emanating heat in waves even from across the street. a heavy, acrid scent pours from the car, burning their nostrils. the sounds of glass shattering and plastic crackling rips loudly through the air, and thick spirals of smoke curl into the sky in a lazy spiral.
“i’m with harry on this one,” ron says, looking a bit queasy. “the levels of PDA tonight have been a bit... unnecessary.”
with perfect timing, briseis jumps into his lap, nuzzling her soft head into his chest. if he looks down, he knows he’ll be met with striking green eyes - the very reason he had adopted her only three days after he had landed in new york. even if it was impossible - looking at briseis provided him with a semblance of comfort... a gentle reminder that there were pieces of harry scattered all throughout the city - even though it was 3,459 miles from home, and harry had never been.
“what are you on about, malfoy?” ginny snaps, effectively joining the conversation. she looks irritated with draco’s antics - no doubt annoyed at not being able to understand what’s going on. she had been less than enthusiastic about accepting draco’s presence in the fold, but draco hadn’t cared. they never spoke. not until tonight, at least.
“so,” harry started, sitting up and turning towards draco. curious, draco flicked his wand and muted the television. “i’ve been doing some thinking.”
, and draco’s eyes flutter shut as his soul promptly evacuates his body. harry’s lips are surprisingly pillow soft against draco’s, and he tastes overwhelmingly of peppermint. his strong hands come up to pull draco closer, until he effectively straddles harry’s lap, their chests pressed flush to each other. he whimpers into the kiss, and then feels terribly embarrassed about it, and then harry cups his face delicate and he does it again.
“you know, you can’t just say the first thing that comes to your mind, draco.” harry said. he smiled tightly at another couple as they passed, their eyes lingering on an obviously drunk draco. “that’s not how this works.”
“i thought i told you not to tell me what to do,” draco sneers. his lip curls, and harry looks away. he knows he looks every inch the malfoy scion that had haunted the halls of hogwarts years ago. “fuck you, potter.” a dry laugh forces its way from draco, humorless and painful. “fuck you so much,” he says in an undertone, watching potter. “finally been taken down a fucking peg, have you? now you’ll have to slum it like the rest of us.”
first, one of pansy’s subordinates goes through the floo - she has a kind face and rosy cheeks, but is surprisingly quick with her wand, and is adept in hand-to-hand, muggle-based combat. draco had gotten the pleasure of watching her take down a random wizard who had run at harry a few years prior - it had been hilarious watching her push the burly stranger to the ground and stand on his back without losing her signature smile. draco goes behind her, his robes flying around him entrancingly, and a secret smile on his face as he made eye contact with harry before disappearing in a flash of green flame. the two remaining junior aurors go next, one right after the other - leaving only harry and pansy.
“please direct all questions to auror williams,” harry said gruffly gesturing to thalia. “i have business to attend to elsewhere.”
the sun has long set, and draco blinks belatedly as he realizes that he has been sat in the dark, holding harry’s body to his and trying to muffle his sobs. as he stands to close the curtains, his fingers brush a strip of plastic. he doesn’t have to look down to know that harry’s small green bag is at his fingertips.
draco watches him as he leaves, his shoulders tense and his fists balled menacingly at his side. anger practically radiates off of him, paralyzing draco. he doesn’t want to think about what will happen after this distraction is over - after harry manages to charm granger back through the floo with smiles and promises to do the breathing exercises she was always peddling. he’ll turn to draco, the smile melting off of his face like butter, and throw him to the floor, maybe kicking him in the stomach until he pukes. maybe he’ll step on draco’s ankle and snap it again, before healing it incorrectly. or worse, he’ll do nothing at all, let draco think that hermione’s lessons worked. and then, in the middle of the night, he would drag draco from the bed, shouting and landing punch after punch everywhere he could reach. he wants to turn to granger and tell her to run, to leave before she can make things worse.
his parents had attended harry’s funeral - dressed in the formal mourning robes and standing silently away from the rest of the crowd. they had been relatively ignored by everyone else, but their silent solidarity had been somewhat of a comfort for draco.
after more than a few drinks and some time spent leaning heavily into lovegood, listening to her blather on about a theory that each of the founders of hogwarts were secretly animagi, potter and ginevra stand up, grinning stupidly and clutching each other.
now, he does not find harry in the garden. his eyes linger over the path of grass they had lain in, remembering the way that harry’s wild hair had splayed across the lush carpet of green, clashing brilliantly. he stands in the sun for a moment longer, letting it warm his shoulders and head before turning and heading back into the house.
a flush spreads across harry’s face as he laughs quietly and pulls away from draco, never one to take a compliment. he moves backwards until his back presses against the couch, and spreads his legs before gesturing for draco to sit between them. he obeys, and is pleasantly surprised when harry’s fingers slip through his hair and begin to gently massage at his scalp.
for a long while, neither harry nor draco move. harry stares hard at the table, at the small green bag, and draco watches him, watches his shoulder twitch and him wet his lips again and again. finally, harry shakes his head, wiping his hands over his eyes and standing. before draco can process it, harry is standing before him, leaning down to pull his lips into a searing kiss.
harry stared at him, hard. for a moment, draco thinks that this it. he’ll realize that this is more trouble than it’s worth, and pack his bags and leave draco alone in their big, quiet house. he doesn’t. instead, he sighed, before shaking his head and turning on his heel, disappearing up the stairs and slamming the bedroom door shut behind him.
,” he mutters to draco, holding out a hand for harry to shake. draco doesn’t have to turn around to know that andrew is smiling, that same brilliant smile that he had used to ensnare draco almost five years ago. “hello,” he says now, his accent making the words sound pleasant in his mouth. “you are?”
,” he snorted softly as he murmured their ridiculous nickname - it had been coined years ago, and was still used in the papers each time the three were spotted together.
he walks away then, disappearing into the kitchen. after a few moments, draco hears the familiar sound of one of andrew’s culinary knives being drawn and sharpened. if he weren’t so shocked right now, he might’ve actually laughed at the idea of his soft-hearted partner actually stabbing harry.
“urgh, harry,” draco moans. he pushes himself closer to harry, his usually graceful movements uncoordinated and clumsy. he’d had around four drinks before harry lost count  - but his low tolerance didn’t need much more than that before draco lost all of his inhibitions.
“i was going to wear a coat,” harry grumbled, slumping down into the couch beside draco. he crossed his arms over his chest, glaring down at the ground.
harry was somewhere in the building - he knew that much. early in their bond, things had been this way often - granted, on a much smaller scale. harry would leave draco downstairs to take a shower or use the bathroom, and he would practically ache with the loss. when harry would appear on the landing once more, draco would find himself inexplicably drawn to him, and practically overwhelmed with the desire to frot against his leg like a child.
groaning, harry grabbed at draco’s wrist and pulled him from the balcony, marching determinedly towards their room. for the first time, he was grateful that they had chosen a room on the first floor - getting draco into an elevator or up the stairs would be torture.
draco opened his mouth to respond, but stopped when his eyes welled with tears and he felt himself become overwhelmed with emotion. he had expected the tentative friendship he had built with ron and hermione during his and harry’s relationship to crumble upon his death. they no longer had reason to tolerate his presence, or treat him with kindness. yet, they had taken him in, and taken care of him when he needed it the most.
he doesn’t breathe or think, as he flicks his wand and puts all of his potions under a stasis, stumbles upstairs, pulls on a pair of robes, and apparates from his living room directly to harry’s doorstep. as soon as he lands, he begins banging on the door and yelling for harry, completely aware but not caring very much at all that he looks absolutely mad.
“you lot didn’t have to come,” he said, blushing. “but i would’ve left the country ages ago if i knew it would get all you lazy sods out of bed before ten in the morning.”
he wonders if he can just stay here forever, in this cold room with this body that looks like but doesn’t act like his harry, clutching it until he dies and can go to wherever harry has gone. there is nothing for him outside of this room anyway, nothing he cares about more than harry. he would give it all up - the house and the career and the friends and the money - to bring harry back, would live like a pauper and sleep in dark alleys if it meant that he could have harry potter by his side again.
draco stands from the table, his chair scraping loudly against the floor as he rushes away from the table. he storms up the stairs, weeping openly and not bothering to wipe away his tears. harry follows closely behind him, calling his name again and again, pleading with him, begging him to stay. with each word, draco’s hands grow shakier, his mind foggier.
“yes!” draco interrupted, bursting forward and pulling harry into a kiss. “yes, yes, a thousand times, yes.”
“harry,” he says, finally saying his name. it tumbles out of him clumsily - he hasn’t said it in over a year. references to his past are minimal and non-descript. andrew had been adamant about moving forward and not allowing the past to define their future together, and draco had readily accepted this dogma. harry was very rarely mentioned by name, and the impact he had on draco’s daily life was handled with care. “why did you come here?”
the fight leaked from draco’s body like a deflated ballon. his fire faded rapidly, transforming into a dim candle before quickly extinguishing completely. he slumped forward, sprawling onto the ground beside the circle of pebbles - beside harry’s final resting place. as he pressed his cheek tot he soft earth, draco swore he could feel the familiar caress of harry’s magic, warm and playful and welcoming.
“i’m sorry, draco.” harry whispers slowly, their foreheads pressed together. tears fall from his eyes now, slowly and steadily. “i’m sorry.”
the air has become chillier, and draco suddenly wants nothing more than to curl beneath his sheets and sleep, with the familiar weight of briseis at his feet. he stands, draining the last of his glass and pocketing his cell phone and wand. as he walks, briseis winds between his legs, her soft fur tickling his ankles. she slips through the glass door first, and draco turns to close it behind him - shutting the door on the city, the noise, and his pain, if only temporarily.
harry goes to respond, but falters as they step up to the stairs, where a herald stands with his wand pressed to his lips. he pats draco’s hand softly, bracing himself as he hears the herald announce - “head auror, miss pansy parkinson,”
malfoy manor hadn’t had any close neighbors - neither had any of the wizarding homes he had visited, ever. each house was unique in design and personality, and perfectly suited to the needs of each family. the houses lining privet drive lacked any sort of personality or flair, and it looked, frankly, depressing.
“what?” she turns to harry, her eyebrows furrowed. it’s obvious that she thinks draco is being purposefully difficult. she wants to return to the fun - to continue celebrating her engagement and drinking and dancing with her friends. she wants to continue ignoring the fact that draco exists - but he’s going to deny her that pleasure. the idea makes him practically giddy. “what the hell is he talking about?”
“i haven’t worn these robes since - since harry,” he stammers, glancing around rapidly as his heart rate and breath begin to speed up. he’s close to hyperventilating - to completely losing his shit in the middle of diagon alley. however, he’s too distraught to care much about what the public will say if he has a full-blown panic attack in front of a stationary store. “and there’s peppermints in them -”
“malfoy,” ron choked as he got closer. hermione looked up, her eyes bloodshot and her hair disheveled.
this morning, pansy had dragged him out of bed, expressing that she needed his help picking out new dress robes from some high eng store in diagon alley. they both knew that she was simply worried about him, seeing as he hadn’t left his bed in almost three days, and had adopted a sickly pallor.
hermione’s stomach twisted uncomfortably - the healer had essentially confirmed that something was indeed wrong. even after all of these years, harry had avoided st.mungo’s like the plague, and had only been a handful of times. for him to have been admitted - something had to be seriously wrong.
draco gasps loudly, his hand pressed to his heart. “unnecessary!” he repeats, his eyes wide. he turns to harry, mirth sparkling in his eyes. “baby, did you hear that? ron here thinks we’re being unnecessary. sounds like someone needs to put a galleon in the bigot jar.”
“‘m gonna find my seat,” he says lowly, squeezing lightly at harry’s bicep - still deliciously firm from his auror workouts. harry nodded slightly, although he was already grinning at the wizard he had marked his target, his eyes twinkling as the old man waved enthusiastically in his direction. he wandered through the nearly-full tables for a bit before finding his own designated spot.
on the day of the funeral, draco pulled himself out of bed and dressed in an expensive pair of formal black robes. he used a glamour to conceal his puffy eyes and took a few deep breaths to steady himself, before pressing a kiss to harry’s lips and disappearing through the floo. by the time harry tumbled out of the floo and into malfoy manor, draco had already transformed into a completely different person, his head held high and a blank but proud expression on his face. when witches and wizards approach him for conversation or to express their condolences, draco entertained them effortlessly and graciously, smiling and shaking hands throughout the entire affair. during the actual ceremony, he stood stoically in the front row, with harry at his side. there were no displays of emotion, no tears or heartfelt speeches from anyone in attendance, and it gave harry the creeps. in a tiny moment of weakness, draco grabbed harry’s hand, squeezing it tightly and inhaling a shaky breath.
on their very first night together, draco and pansy had curled in her bed, drinking wine and catching up on their last few years. when he tells her about harry, she pulls him into her arms and doesn’t let go for a very long time. she curses his name, muttering about how she should’ve actually given him up to the dark lord, or should’ve killed him herself when given the opportunity. draco lets her rant, grateful to finally have a friend staunchly on his side, to have someone be openly incensed about harry.
draco swallows, squeezing his eyes shut and willing himself to remain calm, to not lash out and scream at harry like he so desperately wants to. “no, you didn’t
“you sounded like you were in distress over the phone,” pansy reasoned, smiling around at the table, “so i bought reinforcements! they’ll provide alternate, erm, perspectives. think of it as a slytherin support group.”
“to getting sloshed on a tuesday afternoon,” theo says, raising his glass. goyle follows soon after, the liquid sloshing over the edge as he clumsily thrusted his glass upwards.
when harry finally found his glasses - in the guest bedroom closet, tucked into a pair of his bedroom slippers (
she froze in her tracks, staring with wide eyes. “a suicide attempt? that doesn’t make any sense. harry wasn’t suicidal. he - he’s engaged to be married, for merlin’s sake. he’s not…” she stopped and glanced up at at healer, who looked very uncomfortable. hermione continued to follow behind the healer in a stunned silence, her hands trembling. as they reached the hallway, the healers moved aside, allowing her to see inside of the room.
“i messed up. i know i did.” harry’s voice is gentle and apologetic and draco wants to do something stupid like reach across the table and hold his hand. “i fucked up, and i lost you because i was too blind to realize what i was giving up,  too much of a coward to try and go for what i really wanted.”
. andrew visits draco at his bakery as often as he can, always ordering that same croissant, and leaning across the counter for a gentle kiss and a whispered
“it’s a mourning bird,” draco whispered, drying his slightly shaking hands on a towel. “someone’s died…”
and then potter laughed - a loud, barking sound that startled draco so much that he jumped and his drink sloshed over the rim of his glass, spilling over his fingers. finally, draco turned to glance at potter, and found his heart doubling in speed immediately.
“he’s obviously a complete dunderhead,” draco inserted, knowing that pansy didn’t truly need his comfort. she was a resilient girl, and would bounce back with another paramour within the next two weeks.
instead, harry is surprisingly affectionate with ginny today, brushing her hair away from her face and staring at her all night, even when she’s not looking back at him. they hold hands and she leans into his chest - they share a drink and even order a basket of chips that they pick at and feed each other. the entire thing is disgustingly performative and heterosexual, and it makes draco feel sick to his stomach.
“fuck you,” draco whimpers, looking up at harry through blurred eyes. “i hate you so much. so so much.”
pansy slapped blaise across the back of his head, before turning to draco with a wavering smile. “draco, let’s be realistic here. harry’s mad about you. and he’s a gryffindor... he’d never be unfaithful.”
taking a deep breath and summoning all of the courage he can muster, draco reaches over and grabs the cell phone. he doesn’t look as his finger pushes the call button, and immediately pushes the mobile to his ear. the ring tone sounds for only one second before the call immediately transfers to voicemail.
when draco malfoy showed up on pansy parkinson’s doorstep, drunk and in tears, she didn’t ask any questions. instead, she simply ushered him in, biting back the thousands of questions that were playing on her mind. it wasn’t as if he would be able to coherently answer anything she asked him, anyways - he was rapidly oscillating between deep, gulping sobs, and taking swigs from the bottle of firewhiskey that he had produced seemingly out of nowhere.
he leads potter into the kitchen, where they sit at his small table. there’s only room enough for two - he very rarely has more than one person over at a time, anyways. on rare occasions when he’s able to get all of the slytherins in one place, they tend to congregate in the small living room anyways.
but the words die in his throat. instead, he stammers for a second before his lip quivers and he begins to cry, embarrassingly enough. he wants granger to leave him alone, to allow him to cry to himself at her kitchen table without an audience, but he can’t bring himself to. horribly, she stands and crosses the table, hovering over him for a moment before wrapping her arms around him and pulling him close, resting a chin on the top of his head. worse still, he goes into her touch, burying his face in her soft stomach and releasing loud, earth shaking sobs. she strokes his hair as he cries into her blouse, murmuring things about healing and moving forward.
draco stared over at him blankly, his mouth slightly open. as the moment grew longer, harry began to fidget in his seat. the only sound that could be heard throughout the entire house was the faint ticking of the wall clock.
he bought his knife down again, continuing to slice angrily at the roots. as another tear fell, draco’s vision blurred, and his hand slipped, causing him to nick his thumb.
from this close, he could see the exhaustion written across harry’s face - his eyelids were heavy, and the bags beneath his eyes were slowly becoming more pronounced as each long day passed. his smile, always fixed, seemed forced - even more so than usual. suddenly, draco found himself wishing that granger would wrap everything up and end the event, if only so that he would have an excuse to drag harry home and into bed, where they could curl around each other and pretend as if no one else existed for just a few hours. as hermione continued to speak passionately, harry watched her, smiling indulgently each time she glanced at him, or in the general direction of their table. draco only half-listened - his eyes lingering on the curve of harry’s jaw, exposed by the high neck of his robes.
miles below him, the sounds of new york city filled the air - faint honking, sirens, and shouting that seemed to never cease. he stares out at the skyline, admiring the view for the thousandth time. he’s seen it every single day since his move to new york, and still found himself breathless at the sight.
for a week, things were perfect. they woke early enough to watch the sunrise and spent their days swimming and lazing around in and around the cottage, surviving on wine, cheese, pastries, and fruits. when they became hungry for a real meal, they apparated to a market harry had discovered, and spent the day picking out cuts of meat and fresh vegetables.
“draco,” harry interrupts again, his lips pursed and distress written over his face. “it’s not that easy to just stop. i’ve tried.”
it was his signature move - after he came, he would bury his face in draco’s neck, leaving gentle kisses on the sensitive skin, and murmuring love declarations. draco knew that harry had been with a few men and women before him, and it was likely that he had done the same to them in the throes of passion. yet, it was something so intimate, and so private that it physically pained him to see it being done with anyone else - more so than anything else that had happened in the dream.
harry didn’t know what to say, so he rubbed a gentle circle into draco’s back and held him close, feeling each tremble and sob that left draco’s body. harry had, never once, been grateful for the loss of his own parents. he felt their absence everyday in small, manageable ways. losing them so early, after just barely having them, had left him with almost no real connection to his parents. he missed them, not as people, but as concepts. he craved the idea of a mother’s love from lily - but not necessarily lily’s love - for he had never truly experienced it in a way that he could explain to someone else - like a kiss on the forehead, or a warm hug on a long day.  but here, sitting on the floor with draco malfoy as he fell apart, aching so desperately for narcissa, harry is terribly, terribly appreciative that this specific type of heartbreak is one that he had managed to miss.
“maybe you should go home for the day, draco” hermione suggested moments later, as she pocketed her wand. “you don’t look very good at all.”
since their fateful dinner, draco had stopped communicating with his father entirely, and seemed to only receive correspondence from his mother on occasion. the letters always came after nightfall, and were short and straight to the point. draco had expressed his worry once, but then quickly brushed off his worries with a murmur about paranoia and delusions, before curling into harry’s side and quickly falling asleep.
as they swept away from the couple, the enchanted counter at the top of the steps increased by another twenty thousand galleons - draco whistled lowly under his breath.
“i’m sure potter here has already shown you the report,” lucius said dryly, “your mother died of natural causes.”
“for three hours?” draco spit. he knew he sounded shrill and aggravated, but couldn’t bring himself to care very much. for weeks, harry had been acting strange and aloof, and draco was nearly at his wit's end.
it stumbles from his lips easily, partially pushed out by his alcohol consumption but still whole in its authenticity. he had known that he loved harry for the longest time - for so long that it had begun to feel like second nature, loving harry. he knew that he loved him, just as he knew that the sky was blue and that he was a wizard. but telling harry, even after they had forged a tentative relationship, had been one of the most difficult things that draco had ever done. even after tackling the initial mounting of saying it for the first time, saying it to harry as often as he wanted to proved to be another monster in itself.
“that’s nice, dear” said a considerably less drunk pansy, patting draco’s hair maternally. “do you feel better now?”
“did you say something about harry?” she interrupts, waving a hand to silence the witch. “what’s going on?”
the rest of their friends disappear in similar fashions, making whispered excuses about why they suddenly need to be anywhere but this table right now. draco doesn’t pay much attention to them - instead, focusing on finishing as many drinks as he can. his options are essentially limitless - they had ordered a new round just a few moments before draco had decided to ruin everyone’s night. as he drinks, potter stares at him. there’s no emotion on his face - not anger, or hurt, or frustration. he's blank, annoyingly so, and shows no awareness of the fact that his fiance and best friends have just both walked away from him, metaphorically and physically.
he didn’t understand why they acted like royalty, or why everyone else allowed them to. why they were still so invested in the whole blood purity thing when most of them had enough money to still be extremely powerful in wizarding society without all of the inbreeding and disowning business. why they were so stupidly strict, and continuously limited themselves to empty lives full of money but devoid of happiness for very unclear reasons.
“draco,” she tried, her voice just barely heard over his heart-wrenching sobs. “i know that right now feels like the end of the world, but i promise you that it’ll all work out. it’ll be okay. you’ll find someone else, and you’ll love them much more than potter. i promise you that, my love.”
draco woke with a start, his heart pounding wildly in his chest. he felt hot and overwhelmed, and suddenly had the desire to stand outside and scream into the open air. he was still pressed tightly to harry’s chest, one arm thrown around his waist and the other supporting his head. slowly, he removed harry’s arm and stood from their bed, his legs still feeling shaky.
“I’d like alcohol too.” blaise added, standing from the table and wandering into the kitchen. he returned a moment later with a bottle of firewhiskey and a sultry grin on his face. “remember when we did fun things, like get sloshed and have group sex and not discuss our feelings for gryffindors?”
it was like a flip had switched in harry’s brain. he wasn’t sleeping well anymore - he would often lie in bed beside draco until he thought he had fallen asleep, and then go to sit in the daybed, staring blankly out into the night sky. the dark circles under his eyes were slowly becoming more pronounced, to the point where even his daily glamorous wouldn’t fully cover them. he stopped eating as much - and seemed to consist entirely on slices of toast and water. on a rare night when draco would abandon his study and they would eat together, he would push around the food on his plate for the hour - talking animatedly to distract draco from the fact that he had only taken five bites.
there’s no logical explanation for why he can’t, or shouldn’t kiss harry because it’s more than likely that harry will kiss him right back. after all, it’s harry who’s organized almost all of these outings, harry who has left lingering touches on draco’s arms and legs, harry who is now staring into draco’s eyes with blown pupils.
later, harry would learn that these particular owls were as dark an omen as the grim itself. they had many names in wizarding society - morning birds, mourning birds, couriers of death, and so on and so forth.
“this is getting a bit long now... suppose i should wrap it up. so, i guess this is goodbye. for now. i’ll see you on the otherside, yeah? save a seat for me, love. bye, now.”
“everything about you is just - addicting. i can't get enough, and it’s been killing me to stay away for the last two years. every single part of you - i want every part of you, every bump, every line, every scratch, every bone, every fucking thing, draco. you were mine, and i fucked up, but i can’t stop thinking about you being mine… only mine.”
tears flow freely from draco’s eyes as he speaks, his voice nearly a whisper at this point. he holds the phone between his ear and shoulder as he takes a shaky drag from his joint. he doesn’t want to end their chapter this way - sobbing pathetically alone on his balcony, but the tears refuse to cease.
hermione gasped shakily, her hand coming to cover her mouth. what had harry been doing in the forbidden forest? had he been attacked by a creature?
from his spot in the middle of the booth, neville glances over at pansy worriedly. although she seems to be significantly better at holding her alcohol than draco, she still has had more drinks than anyone else.
“gentlemen,” draco says, tugging on his tattered old sweater and suddenly regretting pulling on harry’s old rags. “what can i do for you?”
“harry,” draco gasps, as soon as he’s through. he reaches out for harry blindly, tearing at his necktie with a trembling hand. “harry,
draco felt the sting of a cleaning charm and heard the familiar pop of the plastic cap on their lube bottles, and absently wondered when harry had summoned it. he couldn’t think too critically about it though, because harry was teasing his hole with his thumb, rubbing slow circles around the wrinkled skin. harry’s thumb abruptly disappeared, but is quickly replaced with the cool press of his lube covered fingers.
“they’re for harry!” he shouts, his voice breaking on his name and dissolving into a sob. “he, he loved them, and i carried them for him
sometimes, draco would wake up and find the old harry beside him - his eyes clear and bright, a stark contrast to the dark and stormy green they always seemed to be lately. he would smile, and laugh, and press kisses to draco’s cheeks, nose, and neck. they would twirl through the house, wrapped around each other and singing loudly in between brief kisses.
“i missed you,” harry says softly, matter-of-factly, as if this is just a thing that he is allowed to say, after walking back into draco’s life after two years. “i've missed you so much, this entire time that you’ve been away. i wanted to reach out, just to see how you were doing… but nobody would tell me where you had gone. i've been trying to find you since last year. i finally got your address about a month ago... i've been working up the courage since then.”
ron and hermione were both staring at him, likely wondering why the fuck he was still standing in the hallway, rather than inside of the room with harry. steeling himself, draco took the few wooden steps towards the door, training his hand on the doorknob. he froze for another moment before pushing it open, holding his breath as he entered.
“are my parents dead?” he stammers, staring over draco’s shoulder at harry. “harry, don’t let him kill my parents. that’s my mum and dad.”
“stop it, malfoy.” harry snaps, snatching the glass from his hands and slamming it down. the drink had been luna’s before being abandoned - the sparkly blue liquid sloshed over the sides and spilled across the tabletop. “just fucking stop it.”
“oi, what are you talking about, malfoy?” seamus says loudly, obviously misjudging the severity of the situation. beside him, dean nudges him discreetly, shaking his head.
usually, they would wake with draco curled under harry’s arm, or somewhat pressed against his body. the excuse draco often gave was that harry was a walking furnace, and due to his inbreeding-induced anemia, he required some of his body heat. in reality, draco simply loved touching harry, whenever possible.
“i have to,” draco sniffs, his tears resurfacing and threatening to come faster than ever. “i can’t do this.”
“forever,” harry returns - and then he leans forward and presses his lips to draco’s, like he means it.
harry pulled away with a soft sigh, running his hands through his hair one more time before straightening up and moving towards the door. his hair was surprisingly well-groomed, with a few strands falling over his scar in an artfully tousled way. it wasn’t covered completely - seeing as the scar expanded past his eye and spread over his forehead and into his hairline - but the deliberate placement of the hair did wonders to draw attention to it. his facial hair was still gloriously intact, as requested/demanded by draco. draco bit his lip as he watched harry descend the steps of their home, wishing desperately that they could just skip the event and fall into bed together for hours of uninterrupted close personal contact.
“it’s funny you would say that, potter.” draco says lowly, his lips curling into an evil smile. “because you always seem to want something with me.”
the peppermint lies innocently in his palm as draco stares down at it, his entire world falling apart.
but this - the anger that burned in the pit of his stomach - was red and hot like fiendfyre, and threatened to consume him completely. it had him gag, the force of the anger - hitting him like a reducto. his entire body warmed, and he suddenly was filled with the desire to tug off his sweater and throw it to the ground, and perhaps tear it to shreds like a savage.
“hermione,” he pleads. he’s not sure why he’s hesitating - here’s the way out he had been craving since this had all started. except, he’s too afraid to take it. he loves harry, doesn’t want to leave him - forgives him for all he’s done, all that he will do. “i can’t - “
when he’s finally done falling apart, she lets him retreat to his bedroom, where he cries and hates himself some more. a few hours later, a note is slipped under the door, containing an address and a small message scribbled on it.
“imagine,” draco had whispered into harry’s ear after a few nights of grumbling and misdirected frustration. he had sat behind harry on the couch, holding him close and caressing his temples. “we’re in our cottage in the countryside. the sun is setting, and we’re watching it from the back garden. we’re sharing our favorite bottle of red, and there’s a gentle breeze in the air. you don’t have to worry about the ministry, or politics, or bureaucracy. you don’t have to worry about making anyone happy, except for me. and you’re fairly good at that, in my biased opinion.”
he could hear harry moving behind him - and could feel his eyes on draco’s more private areas. it’s a testament to their relationship that draco doesn’t feel embarrassed or nervous about finding himself in such a prone position - rather, he feels more aroused than ever, and anxiously anticipates harry’s next movements.
instead, he sinks into his own seat, pushing his mug aside. his throat feels terribly tight, and the idea of drinking makes him feel a little nauseous. he wants it to be twenty minutes ago, when draco had been debating making himself a sandwich and going to sit in the garden and perhaps writing a letter to his aunt andromeda and teddy. he doesn’t want to be sitting across his kitchen table from potter, with his stomach fluttering and doing terrible, awful things that he doesn’t want to acknowledge.
draco burst from the lift as soon as the doors opened, his hands trembling as he felt himself drawing closer to harry. he passed the head auror’s office - storming past a few friendly faces who waved or greeted him. he kept walking, eventually reaching a room he knew to be the auror debriefing room, if only from description alone.
“harry,” he whispered, tears streaming from his eyes and dripping from his chin onto the pristine sheet. “harry, please, don’t go,”
“i’m not done with you,” harry says, pulling draco towards him. he pushes his knees to his chest, eyeing his glistening hole. he slides in easily, draco moaning loudly simultaneously. his eyes flutter shut and his mouth falls open, full pink lips curling back against perfect white teeth. “like that, do you?”
“well, he does get attention.” draco says, recalling the various occasions on which they had been followed and photographed on dates or outings. harry was still frequently harassed by small mobs everywhere he went - and he had more than once regaled draco with stories about signing autographs in the loo. just as quickly - images of harry pulling him in for a kiss, hugging him from behind as they cooked dinner, and grinning at him flooded his mind. “but i don’t worry about it. we’re in love… he wouldn’t do something like that.”
they sort the lube into piles, first by regular versus flavored (“sour green apple?” pansy asked incredulously, holding up a nearly empty bottle, “i like what i like,” draco sniffed.)  and then by effect (“this one is terribly sticky, but it’s self warming and tingles,” draco explained, passing the bottle around. “tingles?” goyle asked, sounding a bit frightened.)
tonight was different. draco found himself lost in pleasure as harry kneeled over him, driving into him slowly and making his toes curl. draco wrapped his arms around harry’s neck, sobbing with pleasure into his neck as euphoria washed over him again and again. he lost track of how many times he came apart under harry’s ministrations - swimming in the mindless bliss and bonelessness of multiple orgasms.
draco nodded jerkily, but didn’t move from his spot. suddenly, his feet feel impossibly heavy. the idea of going into the hospital room and seeing harry - or rather, not seeing him, makes draco feel nauseous. he doesn’t want to think about how many times he could’ve said something but didn’t - or how many red flags he might’ve missed.
draco nodded as the hungarian consult spoke passionately, his hands distractedly waving about the air. as the senior advisor to the international magical cooperation committee and the resident department liason, it was his duty to facilitate conversations between the other foreign advisors. it was also his duty to not be distracted by mundane thoughts concerning lunch and grocery shopping - yet he felt himself failing spectacularly.
“been thinking about you,” potter murmured into draco’s neck, his fingers tearing at draco’s clothes. “want you to fuck me so bad,”
been a coward. wishes that he wouldn’t have rushed out to the front lines, perpetually leaning into his saviour nature. wishing that he had, terribly enough, let someone else take the killing curse. he would’ve felt guilty - so insanely guilty that he would be almost physically sick with it. nightmares and angst would’ve haunted him for months - but he would still be
as he shovels random articles of clothing into a bag, his vision blurred by tears, draco thinks. he thinks of the fear that had wrapped tight around him last night, suffocating him and holding him frozen in place when he had pushed their bedroom door open and taken in the sight of harry, slumped over and strung out. his experiences with the dementors of azkaban had been limited - he had only visited his father a handful of times while he had been imprisoned - yet draco was familiar with the all-encompassing coldness and despair that had filled him as he had walked down that chilly hallway to lucius’ holding cell. that same sick feeling of emptiness had gripped him last night, knocking the air from his lungs and almost sending him to his knees. draco had stopped visiting his father once his mother had stopped mandating it. and now, draco was making the same decision once more. he couldn’t,
“mione, what’s going on?” she rarely called them, and instead preferred to pop through the floo when she needed something.
there’s a long silence - during which potter clenches his jaw and looks murderous, and all of their friends look confused. draco drinks in his anger, relishing in it and allowing it to delight him. it's simple, slipping into this hogwarts-esque mentality - the one that thrives on any attention from potter, whether it be positive or negative. he revels in his ability to rile potter up, to get him angry and out of control. even after all this time, there’s no one who can get harry as angry as draco.
it’s a bit ironic that she caught him with harry’s fist around his throat, draco thinks. harry didn’t often strangle him, but it had been the method that he had used the first time he had ever lain a finger on draco. but he knows hermione, her tenacity, can feel the strength of the wards going up around him right now. he won’t see harry again. not if she has something to say about it.
“they are something special,” draco agrees quietly, taking a sip from his champagne glass - it was delicious, and he hummed appreciatively. “a force to be reckoned with, you lot,” he adds, looking away from ron just as he turns to draco, his eyes wide and a pleasantly surprised smile playing on his lips.
with that, he quickly turns on his heel and disappears through the double french doors, and into the garden.
instead, he knotted his hands in a small clump of wildflowers inside harry’s ring, ripping them from the ground with a furious yank. when the sight of newly upturned earth and frayed roots didn’t soothe him, he tried again, yanking up a different patch of grass and weeds. again and again, he tore at the ground until his fingernails were dark with dirt and his forehead beaded with sweat.
“hah, did you hear that? i’m even using customary units now. i’m practically a native new yorker! anyways, i just wanted to let you know that i’ve been going to therapy lately and i’ve been learning alot. they’ve been teaching me about coping mechanisms, and moving on, and things of that nature. so i just wanted to let you know that… i forgive you.
“that’s what you always say,” draco murmured against harry’s lips, his fingers toying with the hair at the nape of harry’s neck. “you’re always wrong.”
“i need to know harry potter’s condition, under the orders of the minster for magic.” she lied smoothly. the healer regarded her warily, glancing from the badge to hermione’s face. privately, she hoped she wouldn’t lose her job over this.
he chokes on his tears as he reads the paper again and again, running his thumb over the line of harry’s writing again and again. knowing that harry had written this note to himself, had touched this paper and ripped it himself and tucked it away in this dark little box. draco presses it to his nose, hoping to catch even a whiff of harry’s essence. the only thing he smells is peppermint - which is close enough, but also so very far from fully capturing who harry was.
he doesn’t want to love harry - doesn’t want to be attracted to or to feel something for the man who had almost killed him so many times. harry had claimed to love draco, but had looked him in the eyes and purposefully inflicted as much damage as he could - hitting and punching and bending and breaking, just because he
luna nods and turns away, busying herself with something on a small table behind her while draco stares up at the ceiling, attempting to steady his breathing. it’s not as if he’s afraid of the pain - the dark mark on his arm and the crucio’s he had experienced during the war had been more physically painful. emotionally, well - draco could handle anything that luna had for him. he watches as she pulls out the tattoo gun and her wand and presumably sanitizes them, before turning back to him. when she first puts the needle to his skin, he winces simply out of instinct. in reality, he feels only a slight pressure in the general area as she works.
“no, i’m not feeling okay, thank you very much,” draco snapped, suddenly irritated. why didn’t potter just put two and two together? “i made the damn potion, and all i could smell was you, and your bloody peppermints -”
“nice place,” harry says, “it suits you.” still looking around. his eyes linger on the muggle appliances in the kitchen, and a small smile spreads across his lips.
goyle stared down at the table, looking as though he’d rather be anywhere else, doing anything else.
after a few moments, draco stands from the table, partly to give harry time to pull himself together, and partly because he knows that there’s something he must do. he finds the letter quickly, because it’s in the same place it’s been since he had first moved into this house. it’s still in its envelope, tucked away in the farthest corner of his sock drawer. he holds it against his chest for a moment before sighing and going back into the kitchen. his hand shakes as he places the letter before harry, knowing that he’s preparing to open a proverbial can of worms.
“i wanted to tell you - the sun is setting now and it looks like art. the night that you, er, left. there was a sunset that i wanted to show you. and i never did get the chance… but everytime i look at a sunset i think of you. or a seashell. or anyone with glasses. i guess what i’m trying to say is that i’m always thinking of you.
the dursleys amble out of the car clumsily, standing awkwardly in the middle of the road while draco watches, leaning against the side of the car. harry stands further away, his arms crossed in front of his chest. he’s been hesitating all night - as if he wants draco to take the lead. draco accepts the role gladly.
he’s ready for this - has been since the day he lost harry, but especially now that he’s lived a long life, full of more triumphs and failures and heartbreak. he’s not afraid of whatever will come next, because, if his wishes are correct, he’ll be able to do it all with harry at his side.
for the better part of an hour, harry and draco had held court in the middle of the dance floor, grinding sinfully against each other to the rhythm of the music. they had only returned to the table to order drinks and then to throw them back quickly before returning to their spot (although draco had came back quite a few more times than harry had).
they had figured out pretty early in their relationship that nothing could shut the other up quite like a kiss. most of their arguments ended with one pinning the other down to kiss them - and may conversations had been lost (and never recovered) after one of them had leaned in for a short peck.
he tells draco about spending long hours with teddy every week, about buying him his first broomstick and teaching him how to fly it. he tells draco about reuniting with his cousin and making an effort to have a relationship with him, and about beginning to see a mind healer to work through some of his “internal muckiness.”
when the darkness would inevitably return, draco would hold on to these memories with a vice-like grip. every time harry would pull away from his touch, or disappear for hours on end, or be caught staring out the window, unseeing -- he would think about the stroke of harry’s thumb against his jaw, or the press of his lips to draco’s temple.
harry about the whole amortentia situation. what if he didn’t feel the same way? no - what would draco do
draco splutters unintelligibly in response, a shaky hand coming up to scrabble at harry’s arm. harry’s own fingers remain firmly attached to draco’s hips, pressing in hard enough to surely leave a bruise. he uses his hold on draco’s body to anchor himself, driving into draco with a laser-like focus. his frustration seems to pour into each thrust - the confusion and anger evaporating a bit with the sounds of skin slapping together. harry comes suddenly - a debilitating burst, deep inside of draco’s hole. his entire body trembles as his orgasm rolls through him - his hips stuttering and pressing deeper still inside of draco.
“harry,” draco says brokenly, his eyes welling with tears. harry’s mood swings and sudden depression hadn’t been easy to deal with, but draco was more worried about his fiance’s well-being over his own. seeing harry, who was rountinely so strong and cheerful, seemingly crushed was jarring, and it frightened draco more than he cared to admit.
draco’s not sure how or when he became a part of the group. it had started with granger inviting him out for a drink one evening - an olive branch that had quickly blossomed into a beautiful friendship. and then he was tagging along for pub nights - squished in between longbottom and lovegood like it was a completely normal thing to do.
“mmm,” harry groaned. he pulled draco towards him, wrapping an arm around his waist and hugging him close - his back pressed to harry’s front. “talk to me.”
“oh, of course,” harry responds. he reaches behind draco, wrapping an arm around his shoulder and pulling him closer. “that’s actually why i keep you around. i don’t think this marriage would work if your hot chocolate skills were subpar.”
after what felt like hours, the healer stepped away, frowning beneath his bushy mustache. he closed his eyes for a moment and bowed his head - folding his hands before him.
although draco was loathe to admit it, talking to pansy did help him to begin somewhat reconnecting with the person he had been before all of this had started. he found himself laughing more often, and actually having polite conversation with granger and weasley, beyond meaningless pleasantries. he even started calling them ron and hermione in his head.
a small movement breaks harry’s attention - which he quickly refocuses back at draco’s hole. he’s stretched slightly from his fingers, and remains of the lube circle the outside of the rim. he places a gentle kiss there - giving draco time to react, before pointing his tongue and lapping at his hole.
harry stood there, his arms folded across his chest. his black booted toe taps against the floor as he stares down at draco, hard. draco, who had suddenly developed an interest in a piece of lint on his trousers, could feel his heart pounding in his chest.
harry follows closely behind draco as he rushes back down the stairs - both men tripping over their own feet in their haste to move faster.
as soon as the last word was uttered, draco was off, casting spell after spell at his father. lucius quickly returns the favor, muttering spells under his breath and casting wordlessly, slowly easing his way out from behind the desk and advancing towards draco. they don’t seem to be wasting time with dramatic, showy spells, instead using quick, direct spells obviously intended to hurt or incapacitate the other.
?” he pulls him close, partly so that he doesn’t have to look into his piercing eyes, and partly because he needs to feel harry’s warmth against him, and the gentle pound of his heartbeat against draco’s own - because he needs to be reminded that he’s alive, that harry is alive, that he hasn’t descended into some twisted version of hell, where he’s stuck reliving his fears over and over again.
“ron, there’s no service on this floor, i’m gonna go down for a bit. i’ll be right back,” she pokes her head back into the doorway, but ron doesn’t even glance up at her. he’s always been this way - supportive of her ambition and in awe of her drive. ron had always been more family-minded, but it was a dynamic that worked. ron, with his job at the joke shop, was able to take as many days off as he wanted to spend time with rosie, while hermione was required to report to the ministry nearly every day.
“then what, draco? you - you have this crazy dream, and then instead of actually talking to me about it, you ignore me. all day, i was going over the past few days, trying to figure out what i did wrong, and i just kept drawing blanks. and i come home, and you’re off your arse with your friends, telling me that you were upset because you thought i was cheating on you, because of your dream!” his voice picks up speed and volume as he talks, and by the end of his rant he’s standing, his hands buried in his hair and his eyes squeezed shut. “draco, look, i love you, so much, and i’m sorry if i haven’t make you feel that way, but i do, and - i would never, ever, cheat on you. you’re all i want. fuck, you’re all i need!”
“you don’t have to worry about getting back to me, because i’m going to shut this line off.” draco starts, his voice already thick with emotion. he takes a shaky breath and pauses for a moment, blinking back the tears that are already welling in his eyes. “i’ve tried to distance myself from everything, so that i can come to terms with it and all that. 3,459 miles of distance to be exact.
“did you talk to him?” demands pansy as soon as draco answers the phone. “did he cheat on you? bloody hell, draco, tell me he didn’t. i’ll kill him, i swear. azkaban be damned.”
“i love it,” draco says finally, overwhelmed with emotion. even now, three years later, harry was still able to make him feel like a teenager with weak knees and sweaty palms. whether it was small things, like drawing in the sand or little notes, or surprise vacations all around the world - harry never stopped showing his love for draco. “i love you.”
“i’m sorry, draco,” he says again. “we don’t have to have a relationship or anything like that. i just wanted you to know that i’ve changed. i’m not that person anymore - who hurt you.”
“i can’t stay here anymore,” draco murmured, his voice shaky. he curled his hand into a fist, relishing the burn of his fingernails digging into the delicate skin of his palm. “he’s just everywhere, and nowhere at the same time. i hate this stupid fucking house,”
“draco,” he drawled softly, taking a slow draw from his glass.  “i was wondering how long it would take you to burst into my home. you know you aren’t welcome here anymore.”
harry pulls away first, although he stays close, pressing his forehead to draco’s and staring into his eyes, their breath mingling together in the tiny space between them.
“i can’t,” he cries weakly into ron’s chest, after finally being pulled away from harry and ushered towards the door. “i can’t -”
“did you cheat on him?” theo asked, suddenly seeming more fascinated in the conversation than ever. “are you just projecting onto him?”
they walk slowly through the entrance hall and into the ballroom - which is decorated in equal amounts of splendor. the room opens to a balcony and a sweeping staircase - down which the attendees walk to reach their tables. harry glances down at the tables below, which are nearly all filled. near the front, hermione’s familiar bushy head bobs enthusiastically. harry bites back a smile.
“blaise, you slut.” draco sneered. he heard a laugh from theo, closer now, and draco hoped he hasn’t found their strawberry flavored hallway lube. “can we please focus on what’s important right now? my relationship is hanging by a thread!”
draco peers in, pushing aside two tea bags before his fingers brush a small, velvety object. his heart freezes as his fingers stroke the fabric again, tilting the box towards him so that he can look inside. there, nestled in a bed of peppermint tea bags, is a small black box - one that looks terrifyingly similar to a...
draco steps forward, into the floo. he catches one last glimpse of harry, curled on the ground before the fireplace, his eyes vacant and one hand reaching in draco’s direction, the other hovering over the pocket of his trousers.
“you should go in and see him,” ron suggested, reaching out and touching draco’s shoulder. “i think the aurors might be on their way - they might have questions.”
granger and weasley, although kind, were still very obviously torn about harry. draco had often felt weasley staring at him when he wasn’t looking, his eyebrows furrowed and eyes dark, as if blaming draco for turning his best friend into an abusive prick. granger often mentioned harry’s name before squeaking softly and looking away, blinking rapidly as tears flooded her eyes. neither had ever voiced their thoughts on the matter, but draco didn’t blame them.
“thirteen,” he announced, slurring the word a bit. “i found thirteen lubes around this house. frankly, it’s a bit excessive. i’m not sure if i’m comfortable staying in a home where nearly every surface has been defiled.”
the embrace is affectionate, but different from hermione’s. nonetheless, draco allowed himself to be held. when a fresh onslaught of tears began, he presses his face into ron’s shoulder and allows himself to fall apart a bit, and to be held together by ron’s warm embrace.
up the stairs - which were wooden and stained with chipped white paint, there was a loft, equipped with a large bath and bigger bed. the house was filled with windows, letting in natural sunlight and a cool ocean breeze.
suddenly, the table was filled with chatter and bodies. pansy, ginny, and luna crammed into the booth beside neville, each grabbing for glasses of water that covered the surface of the table. hermione slid into the booth neatly beside ron, running a hand through her hair and murmuring about the line in the bathroom and humidity. theo appeared, his arm wrapped around the waist of a tall woman with dark skin and long straight hair.
“well, you were in the war, too. probably saw more fucked up things than i did. are you seeing someone?” harry sits up, his face now hard and his voice accusatory. the dreamy bubble that they had just been floating in had now popped.
“draco,” he says, his voice shaky. his hands slide quickly over his length, bringing him closer to orgasm. “you’re mine. i’m yours, and you’re all mine.” he stares into draco’s eyes as he whispers this, his free hand coming to stroke draco’s cheek.
down on the first floor, hermione found an empty corner to take her call. as the minister’s assistant relayed the most important notes from the meeting she had missed, hermione half-listened. outside of the relative calm of her corner, the hospital was hustling and bustling like usual. a team of harried looking medi-wizards rushed past her, shouting to each other.
harry was standing at the head of the table, head down and bracing himself on the edge and speaking in a low voice. his eyes were closed, and he looked, frankly, worse for wear. his partner, a woman named thalia, stood beside him, also speaking to what seemed to be a large majority of the auror department.
“oh,” blaise said, leaning across the table and placing a hand on draco’s. “in that case, he’s definitely cheating on you. if i were you, i’d pack my bags, burn the house down, and run off to france. lucky for you, i slept with a witch in the portkey office months ago, so we can be in paris within the hour. come now, i’ll help you gather your things.”
he looks down - from this angle, he really does look very much like draco - so much so that it’s easy to believe for a moment that harry’s at home, in his own bed, getting ready to kiss draco goodnight. every feature is nearly identical, save for the eyes. they gleam silver with hatred and evil, things draco hasn’t possessed in years.
“fuck, draco” harry moaned softly as draco lapped at the head of his cock, almost affectionately. he swallowed harry completely once more, running his tongue along the vein on the underside of
when ron and hermione stepped through the floo for tuesday night dinner, they promptly dropped to their knees and covered their heads. clothing, furniture, and other objects flew around the room in all directions, organizing themselves in random piles. in the middle of the chaos stood draco malfoy, pink cheeked and frantically flicking his wand back and forth.
“you ought to nothing,” draco sneers, storming forward and snatching the blankets off of petunia and vernon. “you rotund waste of space - get out of the fucking bed,
draco buries his face in harry’s chest, tears falling hard and fast now. “harry,” he gasps. “i love you.” his fingers reach up, tangling in harry’s wild hair.
“leave it, malfoy.” harry says lowly - he’s realized his misgiving. his eyes are hard, and angry as he glares at draco as if he already knows what draco will say or do. he looks threatening, and draco’s entirely up to the challenge.
from there, the night wraps up quickly, which draco is grateful for. hermione gives another speech, this one short and gratifying - chock-full of phrases like “
“i’m sorry,” he said again. before draco could react, harry reached out and pulled him against his chest, holding tight despite the way draco squirmed. he pressed his lips to draco’s temple, hugging him close until draco finally relaxed into the embrace. “i love you.”
“that’s a good point.” draco said, nodding as if he hadn’t been telling himself this the entire time. “i’m the perfect partner. i’m beautiful, and smart, and difficult enough to challenge him without him completely giving up on me. also, i give what is arguably the best head in the world.”
harry sighed forlornly, putting a hand to the cold window. he knew he was being dramatic, but he felt he deserved it. his first day off in weeks, and he couldn’t step a foot outside the door without at least five layers on. to emphasize his frustration, he grumbled a bit more, glaring at the snow with enough heat to melt it away.
it’s harry who initiates the kiss, pulling draco’s chin upwards and connecting their lips slowly, sweetly. the moment is picturesque: the sun setting in the background as they hold each other, the waves crashing around their bare feet - the evidence of their love on the ground beside them.
harry introduced hermione warmly and indulgently, spending most of his short speech grinning down at her and gesturing about the hall as he listed her personal and political achievements - at his side, hermione wiped away invisible tears and grinned proudly, looking down at her shoes with practiced humility. when harry was finished, hermione pulled him into a tight hug, one that lasted several long moments and was thoroughly documented by the reporters fluttering about the outskirts of the tables. as hermione took the stage and immediately set into a longwinded speech about her passion for equality on fronts and the strides necessary to make
ron nodded her away, rubbing a hand across rosie’s back in an attempt to soothe her before the inevitable outburst. hermione stepped outside the room and put the phone to her ear, but was greeted with only the sound of static.
“perfect,” draco murmurs, leaning forward to catch harry into another, deeper kiss. he laces his arms around his neck and pulls harry close again, separating their lips but maintaining their proximity. “harry, my beloved, you’re a gem.”
deciding to stretch his legs, draco abandoned the familiar warmth of his blanket and headed into the kitchen, where he quickly prepared two identical cups of steaming hot chocolate. he swirled whipped cream across the top and even sprinkled some cinnamon across the top. harry loved hot chocolate - perhaps it would get him to stop staring outside like a kicked crup.
nobody talked about the war, or death, or anything unpleasant. in fact, these things seemed to cease to exist on friday evenings, when they drank themselves under the table and leaned into each other’s personal space in the name of camaraderie.
“fuck you!” he shouted, picking up one of the smooth stones and hurling it into a nearby clearing. he wasn’t sure who he was cursing, or why - but he knew that it felt good to destroy this singular patch of earth - so well decorated and cozy compared to the rest of the treacherous forest. draco grabbed another stone and threw it in the other direction. it fell short, landing only a few meters before him. “damn it!”
“oh, don’t tell me you didn’t all know,” draco says, looking around at each of them. “you heard it here first, i suppose. the savior, boy wonder himself, is bent. gets on his knees quite a bit too. that one was a bit of a surprise for me, i have to say. when potter propositioned me, i expected to be manhandled and pampered… imagine my shock when potter wants me to bend him over and -”
this confession had been closely followed by heart wrenching revelations concerning harry’s remaining family and his upbringing - but the singular beacon of light throughout the conversation had been the portrayal of hogwarts as harry’s saving grace. it was there that he had met his best friends, and formed both his best and worst memories. it was there that his life had truly begun.
sick of staring out the same window, harry turned on his heel to head for draco’s study. perhaps the view would be different there. as he passed draco on the couch, he sighed loudly - and perhaps a bit petulantly.
but harry was gone, and draco had been transformed into nothing but an unfinished sentence, in one fell swoop.
“hmph,” harry says softly, turning and walking slowly towards lucius. “just me and you now, huh, lucius?” he looks down at lucius, who doesn’t speak or move. “i’ve thought a lot about how i want to kill you. not
,” draco murmured so that only harry could hear him. he glanced around the room - most of the junior aurors were staring fixedly down at the table before them, although a few caught each other's eyes with knowing smirks.
harry’s eyes flick to draco, and draco bristles. he fights the urge to turn around and bury his face in andrew’s shirt.
harry comes back later that night, at nearly one in the morning. draco is sat on the couch, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and his face set in a grim line. for the last few hours, he had fumed silently, preparing a dressing down for harry the second he crossed the threshold.
he knows that he’s being dramatic. he could’ve moved in with any one of his friends, or bought another apartment or home somewhere in london. but, as he had lain in their bed alone, he had realized that the centaur had only been half-right in his advice. time had passed - it had been almost nine months since harry’s death, and draco still found himself waking some mornings and reaching across the bed for harry - only to be severely disappointed when his hand instead brushed a cool, empty pillow. distance would help him heal. and then, when he finally felt like himself again, he could come back to london and give this life another go.
“well,” blaise said, breaking the tense silence. “this was lots of fun. potter, it’s wonderful to see you, really! have you been working out?” blaise slid by harry, fetching his robes from the sofa and tugging them on, smiling hastily. “i’m afraid i have to go, so sorry about that. draco, pansy, greg, harry, you lot have a good one!” before he can leave, harry reached out and snatched the biscuits from him, his face set into a frown.
“draco,” harry murmurs, his head dropping in pleasure. his eyes screw shut as his thrusts become more erratic - obviously approaching his second orgasm of the night. “‘m close,”
. draco could have tried to kiss away tears, and hold harry close during nightmares, rubbing his back and murmuring him until the guilt finally ebbed away.
“what?” harry said, pulling away from draco and sitting up. emotions flickered across his face rapidly and bizarrely. first, he looked confused, his eyebrows furrowed and eyes wide - then, his eyes welled with tears. he looked away from draco, blinking rapidly before turning back, his face set into a hard line. he stood from the couch, detangling himself from draco and pulling on his shoes.
when draco had finally seemed to stop trembling, harry released him from his grip - and he promptly fell forward, into his own mess. he seems relatively unbothered as he turns around, staring up at harry through lust-blown eyes.
after many rotations, the blunt fizzled out, and blaise clumsily vanished it, along with one of their throw pillows. draco shrugged, unable to bring himself to care about much. sometime between his first drink and his last pull of the blunt, draco had come to accept that whether harry was fucking his secretary or not, his insecurites would be the true cause of their relationships destruction. this realization had halted his tears in their tracks, and pushed him into silence.
when he opens them again, he is met with white once again - although it is not the harsh, severe light of st.mungo’s, rather a warmer, more inviting glow that makes him feel as if he’s young again. and when he looks down, he is - his hands are free of the wrinkles and spots that had covered them mere moments ago. he spends a few seconds marveling at his sudden youth before he remembers why he had been so excited to come here in the first place.
“maybe you should take it with you,” hermione said quietly, sitting cross-legged on their bed. draco had sank to the ground, with his nose pressed deeply into the fabric. “something to remember him by.”
they are warm, and comfortable and safe. before them, the fireplace crackles, and lazy spirals of steam rise from their mugs, still holding strong under the warming carms draco had cast.
“maybe slow down with the drinks, malfoy,” harry says offhandedly, glancing over at draco while mid conversation with ron and neville.
“don’t worry about it, draco,” ron had said gruffly. “we’re sorry. for not noticing something earlier.”
for a while, they don’t move. they sit in silence, with their heads still tucked into each other’s necks, chests heaving, and arms wrapped around each other.
harry pastes on a smile that he knows falls flat and waves quickly as he stands still for a moment, allowing the applause to quiet a bit before he begins his descent. draco maintains his sparkling grin, all the while leaning close and murmuring through his teeth, “why’ve they always got to put your bloody name first? you can’t possibly be that important,” harry’s false smile makes way for a real one as he chortles quietly at draco’s quip, squeezing draco’s hand tightly just as they reach the foot of the stairs. for just a moment, they remain close together, before draco pulls away with a quiet sigh.
harry had smelled of grass and clean sweat and flowers and broomstick polish and the lemongrass shampoo he favoured and, inexplicably, a warm day.
“brute,” draco grunted as he stumbled into the room, wiping at his mouth. his mood brightened as his eyes caught sight of the bed. suddenly, he ran for the four-poster, wrapping a hand around one of the columns and using it to spin himself around before jumping and landing securely on the soft mattress. a satisfied cackle burst from him as he rolled around, burying his face in the duvet.
with one final dark look at pansy, draco began to recount his dream. his friends listened dutifully, gasping and sighing at all the right moments, bless their hearts.
“that’s a lie!” draco shouted, already losing his composure. he stalked forward, slamming his palms on the surface of lucius’ oversized wooden desk. “you killed my mother - your wife! how could you?”
as he stepped from the lift, draco caught sight of ron and hermione. they stood at the end of the hallway - well, ron stood, rocking rosie in his arms while hermione sat on a chair, her head in her hands. he could hear her sobs as he stepped closer, and each cry made his heart clench more. ron also seemed to be in tears, although it was a lot more discreet. baby rose seemed blissfully oblivious to it all.
“harry potter was in great pain when he came into our forest. my brothers and i made to warn him - but even we could feel his sorrow as he found rest. there was nothing to be done, except to bring him as much peace as we could in the moment,” the centaur gestured to the mostly trampled patch, and a flood of guilt pulled draco under.
in his chest, draco’s magic thrashed wildly, reaching out to touch and grab at harry’s essence. harry seemed to be doing the same on an exponential level - judging by the way the lights in the room flickered and the air crackled with electricity.
“get back, lucy,” draco laughs softly as she runs through his legs. “if you trip me, i’ll eat you!” he’s still grinning down at her as he yanks open the door, using one foot to keep her from running out. “
“draco,” harry says quietly, his lip quivering and his eyes spilling over once more. he sounds petulant, and innocent, and almost like a child. “don’t leave me, please. i need you. i’ll get better.”
“oh, harry, no,” draco said, standing and rushing over to harry. the alcohol and gillyweed are still in his system, and his eyes well with tears. “you haven’t done anything wrong, i - this is all my fault,”
it’s corny, and dramatic, but true. there had been a night, early on in their trysts, during which they had fallen asleep after a few rounds. draco had had a nightmare - a terrible one that involved torturing his mother, and listening to her terrified screams over and over again. he had lurched awake, distraught and confused and breathing heavily. harry had reached over and pulled draco into his arms, whispering comforting sweet nothings and pressing soft kisses to his forehead. now, draco thinks that this is when he started to fall in love with harry - why he’s still so terribly in love with him.
“the best,” harry groans. “i don’t know why mine never tastes this good? i do the exact same steps!”
“what are your plans?” draco asked after a moment. “you’re free now, right? no more war… you can do whatever you want now. so what are you going to do?”
“are you sure?” she asks. he can practically see her pursed lips and squinted eyes, and draco bites back a smile.
“can we go down to the beach?” he asked, his eyes big and bright. “i want to feel the sand in my toes! and other places…” he giggled to himself, waggling his eyebrows at harry.
“it’s their thing,” pansy provided. “after they’ve gone at it, harry always kisses draco on his neck.”
his eyes didn't flutter open - bottle green and full of life. his pink, plump lips didn’t part to release a laugh, or to frame his perfect, white smile. he remained cold, and stiff.
“thank you for loving me,” harry says gently, taking draco’s wine glass from his hands and sending it to the table with a wave of his hand. “i love you, too.”
“fuck you,” he screams at potter’s retreating back. harry ignores him, walking steadily down the street. he lives in the opposite direction, draco knows. “fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!” he repeats, almost like a mantra. he stumbles and trips and nearly falls a handful of times, clumsily making his way towards harry. and then he’s on him - pushing and shoving at his back, still screaming at the top of his lungs.
a witch with a stack of paperwork floating behind her watched him from a safe distance, her eyes wide. draco supposed he looked a bit erratic, what with the way he had begun walking in fast circles and curling and uncurling his fingers.
“bed?” harry asked quietly, his free hand finding its way up draco’s jumper. he traces patterns over the skin, dragging his nails lightly across draco’s spine and savoring the shivers that travel through draco’s body in response. when draco moans lightly, harry swallows it immediately with a thorough kiss.
draco could only hope that harry entertained himself with things that kept him busy, and safe, if not a bit tired.
“i’m sorry to impose,” draco murmured one night. rose had already been put to sleep, and the unlikely trio had curled onto the couch in a position reminiscent of their first morning together. ron had his arms wrapped around both draco and hermione’s shoulders. hermione sipped at a glass of wine, while draco nursed a warm mug of tea.
nobody seems to know what to say to him - but he doesn’t mind, because he doesn’t know what to say to them either. they are all grieving different people - a soulmate, a best friend, a brother. they lean into each other for support - but no amount of crying sessions or alcohol consumed will fill the empty space at the table, the space they all know should belong to harry.
stand here and listen to harry accuse him of every doing anything other than loving him wholeheartedly. “please, just stop,”
“harry,” draco murmurs, rushing forward. he grabs at harry’s shoulders, shaking him gently. his head lolls to the side for a moment before he straightens up, and draco resists the urge to be sick. “what are you doing?” draco tries and fails to keep the tremor out of his voice, to hide exactly how upset he is - the way that his stomach turns and his throat grows tight at the sight of his darling harry, so strung out on merlin-knows-what. “you - you said that you quit!” he sounds petulant and childish, but can’t bring himself to care very much.
as she entered the room with ron and rose, she took a deep breath, attempting to calm herself. as soon as ron looked up at her, he saw through it.
he stays with ron and hermione for nearly four months - sleeping in their guest bedroom and staring blankly at the ceiling, wondering silently how his life had turned out this way. he supposes the dramatic irony of it all is appropriate -  living with and depending on the goodwill of two people he had tormented for much of his childhood. they are kind to him, if not a bit awkward. it’s obvious that although they don’t seem to mind having him in the house, they’re not sure what to do with him. he tries to make himself useful, cleaning and cooking and generally staying out of the way, partly out of gratitude and partly because he’s unsure of where he would go if he didn’t have their support.
“draco,” harry whispers, breaking his trance. he still stands by the foot of the stairs and doesn’t make a move towards the cupboard. he seems to be avoiding it, and it makes draco angrier at harry’s stupid muggles.
draco wants to cry out - thanking merlin for the first time for hermione’s overbearingness and inability to mind her own business. however, a part of him fears exactly what will happen after she’s gone, when harry has another opening to release his anger and frustration.
of the trio, ron had, as expected, taken the longest to warm to draco. he had approached hermione first, full of apologies and remorse and speeches about making up for the past without making excuses for it - with pursed lips and an intimidating glare, she had bought him into the fold, pushing him into a seat beside her in the pub and pointedly telling harry and ron that he would be drinking with them and that it was “
for a moment, draco actually feels guilty. weasley will likely never speak to potter again - he’s broken his sister's heart and violated the unspoken gryffindor code of conduct, all in one night. worse still, it was a slytherin - no, it was draco that he chose to fuck around with. if it had been neville longbottom, or one of the patil twins, ron might’ve punched harry and ignored him for a few days, before all would be well again.
it feels right. it feels like kismet… like magnetism… like magic. it feels like their entire lives have culminated into this singular moment: here, in harry’s bed, tangled together and holding each other.
draco placed his palms flat on the table, ducking his head between his arms. he let out a loud scream, wrought with frustration, before dropping his supplies and vanishing the cauldron completely. wiping his palms on his joggers, he abandoned his station, slamming the door behind him hard as he left.
.” she presses a kiss to his forehead and wrapped her arms around his neck, and rubbed a gentle circle into his back. “it’ll all be okay. i’m sure of it.”
“yeah,” draco said softly, folding the sweater carefully and sending it down the stairs with a flick of his wand. “i think i will.”
when draco finally managed to peel himself from the ground of the forbidden forest, the sun had almost set completely, and the centaur had disappeared. he could hear the rustle of creatures through the trees, and felt distantly that he was being watched. however, he knew that nothing would touch him.
ironically enough, it is hermione granger and her disturbing lack of boundaries that save draco’s life.
“i’m sorry, i’m unable to disclose private information pertaining to mr.potter’s condition,” she said, wringing her hands.
draco kisses him back eagerly, melting in harry’s palms like putty. this is what he’s missed for so long - this passion, the fire, the warmth. harry feels alive, pressed close to him. he thinks, for a few long moments, that they can make this work, that harry can truly give up his habit, and that things will return to how they were before all of this. they will return to lying nose-to-nose, tangled together as they further plan their life together. in the future, when they are married and have children with sleek dark hair, or wild blonde hair - they’ll lean into each and smile. these two years, this dark period, will be a small, unremarkable blip on the timeline that is their love. they will look back on this and hold each other close, and whisper quiet things about overcoming, and being stronger for it. they will live clean, and happily, and every moment will feel like this one - scorching and heavy with passion. harry pulls away, and draco looks up at him, grinning like a fool.
“in the pot,” draco hears himself say. his voice sounds tense - hollow. harry hears it - draco can tell by the way his shoulders tense as the words roll over him, sharp like knives. draco watches carefully as harry pours himself a mug, adding in just a spoonful of sugar and no milk. when he turns, draco forces himself to look up at his face.
petunia cries harder, and draco has to work very hard to bite down a cruel smile. he stands before her, watching her cry and beg for a bit. beside her, dudley whimpers quietly, shaking violently, with his eyes trained on the back of his fathers meaty skull. eventually petunia’s sobs die down into soft sniffles, and draco continues.
“ah, forgive me,” he deadpanned, his eyes swimming with glee. he moved to straddle harry’s lap. “please, harry potter - put that large cock of your in my arse and fuck me until i can’t walk. and then a bit more after that.” he glanced at harry, who looked more annoyed than aroused. he softened his expression and kissed harry’s temple lightly, pulling harry’s hair from the elastic band. “please?” he added.
,” draco sneered, coming to a stop before vernon. he pushed his wand into vernon’s meaty and bent down just a bit, close enough so that vernon could clearly see the hatred in his eyes. “for the cupboard… the starvation… the beatings… the emotional neglect… he’s told me about all of it. have you any regret?”
draco nodded tearfully, unrolling the socks and placing one on each hand, rubbing them across his face with a satisfied sigh.
weasley had made a toast that night to harry for finally ‘coming to his senses and getting back with ginny’ and everyone had drunk and danced and been generally merry, and draco had swallowed the lump in his throat and smiled along with everyone else.
“he’s not cheating,” pansy said matter of factly. “your relationship seems so perfect, why would he risk that?”
“draco,” she said softly, maintaining eye contact with him. draco had always had the prettiest eyes, one pale blue and the other a gorgeous silver. how she hated to see them so sad. “my love,
harry called for him, but draco ignored him, fleeing down the stairs and into the relative safety of the study.
draco takes the box with shaky hands, glancing down at it and feeling his heart shrivel up and die completely. folded at the bottom of the box was a grey jumper that draco had gotten him during their first christmas together. there are a few photo frames, containing photos of ron and hermione, teddy, draco, and some of them all standing and smiling together. there are also a few knick-knacks of harry’s - a small dragon figurine and a spinning broomstick. and there, nestled in between it all - a small crystal jar, filled with peppermints.
“i’ll change,” harry says shakily. he buries his face in draco’s neck, his warm breath ghosting across draco’s exposed collarbones. “i’ll be different.”
he hadn’t seen him in almost a week, as a result of their busy schedules seemingly working against each other. harry worked impossible hours at the ministry (fetching coffee and pushing paper work, according to him), and draco spent almost every waking hour brewing down in his lab. at first, his potions business had struggled - but word of mouth and stellar reviews from some of his most loyal and infuential customers had quickly turned things around. his skill and impeccable customer service had taken presidence over his name, and nothing made draco happier than to know that his name had finally taken a backseat.
harry pulled at draco’s pants as he whimpered, stripping him naked and crawling up to straddle him. he pushed their foreheads together, brushing draco’s lips with his own as grey eyes meet green.
harry pushed into draco’s mouth completely, using his fists to brace himself as he slowly fucked in and out of draco’s tight, wet mouth. for a few long moments, draco simply lies there and allows himself to be used, humming and moaning softly around harry’s cock. as he regains his strenght, his hands begin to travel, first coming to rest on harry’s hips, and then moving down towards his arse. he squeezes harry’s arse cheeks in between his hands - mirroring the movements harry had made earlier.
draco doesn’t respond verbally, but he locks eyes with harry and slowly opens his mouth, his pink tongue darting across his plump bottom lip. harry wraps his hand around his cock and drags it slowly across draco’s lip, watching with satisfaction as he eagerly lapped up the liquid left behind.
once draco trusted himself enough not to run screaming, he climbed back into bed - opposite harry, and turned on his side, staring unseeingly at the wall. his mind raced as his dream replayed, over and over again. the way harry’s hands had roamed his body had been eerily realistic, and practically mirrored the movements he had used on draco countless times.
“hello?” draco felt a bit proud of himself for figuring out the phone so quickly. he usually fumbled for at least a minute before being able to accept the call.
“if this is what you need to do to feel okay,” ron said, clapping his hands together and spreading his lips into a thin line. “then we’ve got your back completely.”
even now, more than six years later, draco still flinches when andrew raises his voice in an argument, or while on the phone with his colleagues. he knows that andrew wouldn’t dare hurt him - but harry had instilled a fear in draco so deep that he feared he would never be able to have a truly healthy relationship.
hermione looked up then, a curious smile on her face. the bond had always been a point of interest for her, and she never gave up an opportunity to discuss it at length. the magical theory and mechanics behind it seemed to fascinate her - and draco didn’t very much mind being her guinea pig, as long as she consistently allowed him to hide from his on responsibilities in her office.
in the week between narcissa’s death and her funeral, draco mostly sleeps around the house. occasionally, harry would also catch him staring out of a window blankly, his eyes bloodshot and damp. he never seemed to want to talk much, but he still clung to harry like a koala when he was home, always pressing his face into his neck, or wrapping his arms around his waist.
for the rest of the walk, harry kept his hand clasped securely over draco’s mouth, groaning as the man licked at his palm and attempted to talk nonetheless. when they finally reached their bedroom, harry fished out his key with one hand, opening the door and shoving draco through it none too gently.
“can i look at you now?” harry asks quietly after a few moments. his fingers linger on draco’s hip, gently stroking the soft, exposed skin there. draco nods jerkily, sighing softly. he turns slowly, watching harry carefully. his eyes were open and full of love, and he watched draco with a slight smile on his face.
“draco?” harry called for him softly, his morning voice raspy and arousing. his arm reached across the expanse of the bed and brushed draco’s back, lingering on the smooth skin for a moment.
“thank you, pans” he said to her kindly. “and the rest of you useless arseholes, except you goyle, you’re a sweetheart, can fuck right off.”
when draco wakes the next morning, his head pounds, his throat is raw, and his memory is hazy. he’s somehow in his bed, although he doesn’t remember ever making the trek from his front door to his room. he’s not wearing the tight trousers and silky top he had worn to the bar yesterday - instead, he’s dressed in soft flannel trousers and a worn sweater. he’s wearing socks, fuzzy ones with purple and orange spots. on his bedside table sits a glass of water and a vial of hangover potion.
draco hesitated for a moment - surely he wasn’t meant to come in if the door was closed. he had been raised better than that and wasn’t one to abandon his principles out of simple curiosity or urges. before he could develop adequate reasoning, the door flew open. whether he or his magic had pushed it open remained up for questioning.
he took his hand, leading harry to the sofa, where he sat beside him and placed a hand on his knee. harry waits, patiently, watching as draco collected himself. his gaze is full of affection and acceptance, and it causes a bulk of draco’s insecurities to melt away. he can hear pansy’s voice in his mind, reminding him that harry loves him - and his sitting beside him in their silent home is practically proof.
“touch me, harry,” draco choked out, his riding growing frantic as he chased his release. obediently, harry reached down and stroked draco’s cock - paying special attention to the sensitive head. it was obvious that he was close - his neck was flushed and his fingers had begun grappling for purchase on harry’s shoulders - squeezing him tightly. filled with a renewed sense of passion, harry gripped draco’s hips and took over, fucking up into draco with fervor.
from harry’s perspective, the entire thing had happened in almost slow motion. he had watched as draco untied the letter and opened it, his hands shaking minutely. his face had been pinched - his forehead creased and his nose scrunched adorably, the way it always did when he focused hard on something. when he had finally gotten it open, his eyes had scanned it slowly - left to right, and then again and again until -
“yes,” he says instead, his voice hoarse, like it always is after a good strangling. “we got caught up in our anger.” he stands upright and pulls his hand from hermione’s, doing his best to look as if he’s not shaking like a leaf.
as he washes his dishes and retreats into his study, his mind replays scenes from the night before. he doesn’t think he’s ever felt anything like it. after months of harry only being half-there, he had truly seemed to be in the moment with draco last night. they had kissed like they were dying, and that the only antidote could be found behind the lips of the other.
he takes a deep pull from the blunt, closing his eyes as the buzz immediately begins to settle over him. they pass around the joint for a bit, taking turns attempting to blow interesting shapes and laughing at the most plebian of jokes.
ron nodded absently, although his eyes were trained on harry’s body. hermione dialed the number to harry and draco’s home phone with trembling fingers and blurry eyes.
“you’re going to wear a bloody hole in the floor,” draco commented, closing his book and looking up at harry with twinkling eyes. harry ignores him and ventures into the study anyways - despite having left it only an hour prior. “stop the pacing, you’re making me anxious.”
when he called ron and hermione to tell them he wasn’t coming back to england, they had hummed good naturedly and told him that it was probably for the best.
he hears the darkness slip beneath the crack of the bathroom door - a loud, gnashing sound like two bunches of wire wool being dragged across each other. it fills the bathroom, flooding the floor and crawling up the walls like vines. the light in the bathroom reduces dramatically as the darkness slips into the shower. draco watches as it approaches him, rushing towards him and then stopping right at his pointed big toe.
“why did you bring these idiots?” draco moaned, dropping his head on the table. when pansy had stepped through the floo, draco had nearly burst into tears of relief. he had been decidedly less excited when his floo flared again repeatedly, releasing theodore nott, blaise zabini, and gregory goyle. “i promise you they’ll be of no assistance.”
“potter,” draco breathes, looking down at his shoes. “you... you smell like broom polish, and springtime, and warmth, and you taste of peppermint, and -” he tapers off, sighing heavily. he runs and hand through his hair and admonishes himself for not practicing a speech during the time he had sat here worrying.
draco goes home alone that night - his hands trembling endlessly and his breath shallow. he had been interrogated by the aurors and healers, who had seemed unconvinced that the reformed death eater had nothing to do with the death of the saviour. finally, when he had begun to stumble over his words and talk in confusing circles, they had released him, offering their halfhearted condolences.
“what did you do to my mother?” draco stepped forward, his chin still raised despite the slight wobble in his voice. “what spell did you use on her, father?”
“he is gone, but only from this realm. harry potter lives on forever with all those who were lost before him.” the centaur says quietly. the image of harry, dressed in white and walking with an easy grace, surrounded by all of those he had loved and lost appeared in draco’s mind. his parents, sirius, remus, tonks, dumbledore, and even snape - welcoming him into the afterlife, or the second realm, or wherever it was that spirits went, filled draco with a strange warmth. “you will heal, draco malfoy,”
