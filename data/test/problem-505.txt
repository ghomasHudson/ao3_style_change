"Oh yes?  And what will
"Stop!  No!  Leave me alone."
Wolfwood snorted, his twitching beard framing his frown. "Yes, Mr. Potter. Do you doubt us?" Harry looked into those eyes, piercing and astute, threatening physical hell if such a suggestion were claimed.
Harry appears from below deck.  Today the wind is sharp, the sky a dove-wing gray layered upon charcoal, layered upon a bleak swirl of black.  The wind tugs at his hair, the open collar of his shirt.  The man still wears indecent clothing that bares his chest, an angry scar now bisecting the tanned flesh.
Harry crossed the room and sat on the edge; the mattress dipped and half his butt dangled off.  With one hand he reached out to touch Draco, rub his back maybe, but inches from contact he pulled back, unsure.  Draco was always the one who initiated contact; by ignoring Harry was he expressing a true desire to be alone?
"Thanks."
"Lily?" he asked the blackness.
"I got another letter."  Harry fluttered a paper between himself and the Floo.  It crinkled in protest.  "Another note…about Fritz.  I found it taped to my door.  It--"
Severus threw his head back, his face contorted in a petrified scream as his orgasm overtook him, and he flooded Harry's mouth with his semen.
And finally Draco surrenders.  "Yeah, it is."
Surprisingly, Draco only pouted.  "What is it?" Harry asked.
Greg's jaw dropped.  "Merlin’s balls!  You’re pulling my leg, Draco."
Movement down the road caught Draco's eye, and he resisted the urge to call out when he saw that it was Potter walking their way.  Romeo and Peking rose up off their haunches and barreled down the road, kicking up dust.
"Don't talk to it, Potter!" Draco scolded.  "If you talk to them, they'll just trick you into doing something you'll regret."
"Not today," he said with a sorry shake to his head.  "There is this one criminal I've been working on, but he refuses to cooperate.  I'm certain he's doing the crime he's charged of, but I've no tangible proof yet."
"Good.  I will leave it to you to deal with mooning Potter," Severus said, offering Draco his own form of smile, slight yet genuine.
The time for testing was at an end.  Time for action had begun.
Her sight growing dim, Luna wheezes.  All she can see now are shoes, black neat slip-ons with a sliver buckle.
"Seamus!" calls out Neville as Seamus strolls through the room.  He's got a new tattoo of a woman on his arm, breasts disproportionately large, that dances like one of the girls at Jenny's when he flexes.  Luna knows, she's been there once to see what all the excitement was about.  She didn't quite understand the allure of such a place.  What was the point of being with one unknown person for just a night?
"What do you mean, 'What the fuck'?" Draco asked, slightly manic. "That's supposed to be my line!"
The bed dipped.
Remorse unites with his tenaciously clutched denial, which has been whittled away, layer by layer, since he'd learned of the true fate of the pirates' captives.  It isn't just the shape of Harry's body, or the fact that Draco has been abstinent for far too many years.  It's the smile on Harry's lips when he sees Draco, the light in his eye when he laughs.  The determination and fever that burns within him when he faces some injustice.
It wouldn't be good for Harry.  As Bill, Professor Slughorn, and Hermione were busy with the dagger, Harry and Ron were preparing an empty dungeon room for the ritual.  After they had finished, it looked like a medieval torture chamber, complete with chains attached to the bare floor meant to secure Harry as they cut into his scar with the dagger.  A large pentagram and protection circle were drawn on the floor using a mixture of salt, coltsfoot, and Harry's own blood to contain the huge energy release that they expected with the destruction of the Horcrux.  The blood-stained circle was then burned with chameleon fire, charred into the stone floor, leaving an acrid odour hanging in the air.
"No!" Draco cried out, and he wasn't sure if it was to Tufts or the boy, but the boy lunged for the lynx, grabbing at ears anyway.
"So, who set off the bomb?" Harry blurted as Draco turned his body away from Harry.
Though Draco would never admit it, he'd often imagined kissing Harry and what that experience would be.  He hadn't imagined anything this tender, this full of love.  He'd imagined passion and desperation; he'd imagined clumsy fumblings as well as talented, well-earned skills.  But he'd never imagined this moment as Harry's strong arms held him tight, like he was some cherished prize that the other wizard wanted to keep safe.  It was heaven and hell and something Draco had never hoped to experience before.  It was the stuff of dreams and he never imagined he'd dream of lions.
"I can't.  I've got this meeting with the French ambassador, and the Committee for Werewolf Rights is still being stubborn; I couldn't leave it right now."  There was so much to do.  Harry couldn't just leave it all.  That would be irresponsible.
“You are banned from the Chocolatier, unless reparations--” his white eyes darted to Draco “--are paid.”  Draco didn't think the man wanted him for fun and games.  A shiver coursed his spine.
"Well, there were two more Dark items we collected that we believe were sold by our guy. One victim is in the hospital being treated for shriveled lungs. His prognosis isn't good," Plincher said in a subdued tone.
"It's not like you spend any time in there anyway," Draco said, laughing to lighten the mood.
"Thank you… Draco," Potterette said and placed her hand lightly on Draco's arm.
With a tap of his wand, the door opened.
Harry grinned and lifted his chin in acknowledgement. "So, what do you got?"
Snape wrapped a comforting arm around each of them and turned to face the cottage.  It had become home to Harry, perhaps even replacing Hogwarts in his heart.  The thatched roof, the light blue paint, the beautiful lake in the distance.  He'd felt safe here, and he wasn't ready to leave it.
"You?"
"I see. Terribly fascinating," Apis said as she squinted at Sirius who continued to shimmer in negative.
"Merlin's balls, I can't do this."  Harry began to struggle against his restraints, thrashing in panic.
"Down!" Remus yelled as a new bombardment of spells pinned them to an outcropping.
"Hello," Draco said with morbid curiosity at the flopping perch in the man's hand.  He then noticed a large oak tree not too far in the distance behind him.  He smiled, not at the man, nor the fish, but at the tree.  The fisherman smiled at him with a shaky nod that seemed to cause the man's head to go round and round, like the London Eye.
She nods.  "But I'm fairly certain the fumigation of burnt banana leaves did the trick.  Though," she adds as an afterthought, "do keep a look out for snargelpusses.  We might have one or two of those stowed away now."
Just like the map.
"Come on, Draco.  Sit here."  Harry held out a chair, and Draco sat.  Harry refused to look at Snape, knowing their every action was being monitored, distilled like the effects of a new ingredient in a potion.
The cloth hung intact, like pristine lacework, so different from the ratty looking veil held by a similar arch sequestered deep within the Department of Mysteries. It stood solid and mocking, taunting Remus with secrets only it knew and would never share.
"No… it wouldn't work out… I quit."
Moony rose high within Remus, offering his strength and anger and sheer will, and he pulled away from the temptation.
"This is what was left," Harry said, he voice strangely flat.
Draco's fingers played around the soft fabric of his shirt, unbuttoning each button with grace and casual teasing. A smirk flitted across his lips as Harry fought a losing battle to let Draco continue his dance without interference. Struggling in a pool of frustration, Harry stepped forward, tossing one hand casually in the air, and completely disrobed Draco.
Snape insisted it was necessary.  They all watched as a charmed sparrow fluttered off with a message to Arthur Weasley.  Harry watched it with a kind of obscene fear, its tiny little wings flapping at a hundred beats per second, taking a message to the world out there.  But they were almost out of food, and Snape had always told him that they couldn’t stay hidden forever.
He was trying to distract himself.  October 31st was fast approaching.  They would cast their spell and see Draco for one day, assuming he had remained at the cabin and saw the magical circle.  They would tell Draco that they were lovers and gauge his reaction; Severus thought it would be positive.  Harry hoped it would be.
Draco cast a spell, then another; the mischievous Fae dodged each one.  Then, as the green fairy began racing around him, Draco ceased his assault and blindly stepped backwards.  The fairy buzzed a hoop around Draco's head, over and over, at such speeds that soon Harry couldn’t even track the movement of the Fae; all that was left was a green halo around Draco's head.
"You're a vampire."
A long pause.  "Fine."  The door shut.
Harry stepped towards him and grasped his shoulders.
"What!" Remus said a little too loudly.
The bar was adorned in mistletoe and garland in celebration of the winter season and while everyone seemed jolly at the new decorations, Harry looked on in sadness.  The holidays always made him feel lonelier.
Perhaps if he only smothered her to death, didn't do anything Unforgivable, nobody would ever accuse him of murder.  Surely, it would be a mercy to the population of the world.
The waitress came by one more time, keeping her eyes on Draco like someone would keep an eye on an unknown dog sitting on the street corner.  Harry smiled up at her and ordered some coffee concoction that Draco didn’t quite follow.  When the waitress returned to Draco for his order, he grudgingly asked for the same.  Harry had the audacity to laugh.
In the flash was an image, a negative reversal of a white dog in a black backdrop, tongue lolling; a goofy look about the canine.
Mrs. Weasley might be getting old, but she was still a mother of seven, even if they weren't all there anymore.  Even as a mother of seven, eight if you count Harry, she still had a bottomless well of love for more children in her life.
"I like to stay in control."  Harry took a sip of his drink.
"You better go," Lovegood said, turning away from him.  "I hope that wand works well for you for many years."
"I figured you might need some help and I haven't been to Mexico before," Draco explained, squinting at the low hanging sun. It was late afternoon, almost evening, but it was still bright out. "I'm not sure I like it."
Then Draco turned back to Snape.  "Yes, Severus.  We do wish to return.  Sing first—" He delivered a heated gaze at Snape. "—then we can get back on the train."
Draco sipped his drink.  "Well, Hermione did win Krum back in school.  And that man was fit."
With childlike exuberance, Harry waved at Neville.  "Neville!  Come on and join us!"
"Yeah… just, don't take so much, okay." He gave Harry an apologetic look and Harry's eyes grew large in realisation. Realisation of what Draco had done for him, of what power the orb had grown into.
Her smile melted from her face, leaving worried, sad eyes and a frown of disappointment.  "Oh, that's too bad."  She looked down at Tufts and Lily playing with each other.  "He so loves his children," she said, almost to herself.
"How often to you see him?  When was the last time your father met with him?  Have you ever visited with him and if so, what locations?"  And on and on the questions continue.  Mostly from Harry, but Terry Boot, Ravennerd extraordinaire, has to make sure he isn't left behind.
"No."  The feeble word snuck out of Draco's constricted throat.
"He knew I was going," Harry said in a small voice.  Maybe this wasn't easier through the Floo.
They reached the little hillock and sat on it, Harry perched on his rock, and they watched as Beltane slowly burned away, the sun long past its peak in the sky.  The thing about not having a wand, or the telly, or even many books, it created a lot of time to think.  And Harry realized, Draco was right, as much as he wanted to, he couldn't keep hidden away.
Remus hated that she was in danger. Ever since they had come together he felt an overwhelming sense of protection over her. But his logical side realised they needed every able fighter, and Tonks was more than adequate at her job, if a little clumsy at times. But every time she got wounded his stomach churned; every time she went out on a dangerous mission, he only wanted to scream.
seeped over to Draco.
Harry mulled this over.  "What happens if we meet ourselves?  Isn't that some kind of paradox or something?"  Would the worlds crumble in on each other if he set eyes on this world's version of himself?
Stiffly, Harry turned his head and looked over. A blond man whose hand rested on his, gripping him tight, stood there, skin pale. Eyes wide.
Not used to being scolded by vicious young women, let alone one who obviously held a lower social standing than himself, Draco’s immediate response was to scoff at the fraulein and let loose some scathing remark that would remind her of her place.  But then Greg was his friend, one of the few ties he had left to his childhood, and he didn’t want to alienate him.  So he did the next best thing.  He charmed her.
"Harry!" Draco called, pulling his attention to the threat, and Harry lifted his wand and without any thought cast out: "
The mournful bells ring out.  'Harry!' he wants to scream.  'Harry, rise up and hear the bells.  Rise up and be with me.'  But all that happens is he swallows words he cannot say, and Harry lies where he has fallen, cold and dead.
The shock of it arrested any protestation, not that he would have protested.  The taste of blood was what first jerked Harry back into the present, along with Draco's soft and gentle lips.  A low noise rumbled in the back of Draco's throat, and his arms tightened around Harry.  He kissed back, swiping his tongue along Draco's lips, requesting and receiving entrance.  It was soft and tender and filled him with joy.
"Yes, I am," he insisted.  "I want a TV."
"And no more drinking!" the Chief Auror said as he took the glass from Ron’s hand and went to stand by the Minister’s side at the podium.  Harry heard Kingsley chuckle and would have laughed too if he wasn't already apprehensive about the Minister's handshake.
What did that mean? Did Kingsley really want him to go to Mexico? Was he under surveillance too so couldn’t talk to Harry? He was acting so odd, so peculiar, and then it hit him. Why was he thinking so slow? Was Kingsley under the Imperius Curse? Holy hell.
"Based on the specifics I gave her, she didn't know exactly what the base formulae for the curse might be, or what kind of artefact it might herald from. However, she did tell me she had come across similar magical systems from some items she examined from South America."
"Merlin, Harry. What the hell?"
The night air harboured a slight nip to it and Draco shivered against the cold tiles.
Dazed and numb, Harry stumbled back from Hermione’s body and turned towards the cluster of men by the receiving bay.  "You bastard Malfoy, what did you do to her?"  Harry marched over to Draco, fisting the front of the blond's stylish jacket and slamming his slighter form against the dirty stone walls of the building.  Ted Riley grabbed Harry's shoulders, tugging uselessly on his body.  Turbulent winds tossed Harry's shaggy hair, his green eyes glowing as a hidden surge of wrath searched for release.  Draco cocked an elegant eyebrow at him, not struggling against Harry all.
"I'm sure that they didn't mean it," Harry said.
He'd slept on the couch, and it was not the most comfortable of furniture.  He couldn't define exactly what he was feeling, but he didn't want to be near Severus right now.  He'd thought they were going home.  Once they had mastered their magic, they would cast this spell Severus had discovered and they would go home.
"So, you still hate all that's Muggle?  Despise filthy Mudbloods…"
Severus snorted.  "You seem to lack faith in my magical research skills, Harry."  Harry rolled his eyes.  "I worked off of those circumstances.  Without knowing what Rowle cast, it will take some time to unscramble.  As it was, I found this spell to layer the dimensions together on Beltane and Samhain."
Once fully sheathed, Draco leaned forward, pressing his forehead into the small of Harry's back.  Small spasms fluttered through Harry's body, and Draco kissed him.  Once, twice, a thousand times he kissed him over the soft skin covering the base of his spine.
And Harry looked up at Snape again as Draco stilled his movements.  The man's face was firm, but Harry could see that he was smiling in his own way.  He could see a flush to his cheeks and their eyes met.  Snape nodded.
"What?  I'm coming through."
Harry jumped from his usual chair, excited to see his old friend peek her head into the hospital room.  Ginny had been down in Africa studying ancient wizarding culture and spells, a font of knowledge left mostly untouched by European scholars.  Her hair fell long with fine layers of braids down the entire length, each with an earthen coloured bead at the end.  They hadn’t seen each other since she left England following the fall of Voldemort.  In fact, she hadn't returned to England at all since then.
The three wizards halted their song—they had three more stanzas left—and looked up at a very pale fairy.  Her eyes were pink and Harry thought she might be an albino.
"Harry, stop this.  It was not your fault.  The spell—I cast it too soon…"
"Captain!  Captain, we've got him."  Terry barges in, is brought short by Draco, still half undressed, chest covered in bites, hair an array of startling chaos.  Harry stands up from tying his shoes.  Silence, then Terry nods.  "Cardiff, Harry," he says in a steady voice.  "Voldemort's in Cardiff.
"What the hell?" Draco squawked.
Above the register hung two large portraits. One of them of Harry, Hermione and Ron, designed from a photograph of them straight out of Hogwarts after Voldemort had been destroyed. Remus could see the tired look in each of their eyes even as they smiled in relief for the camera. It was a moment when each of them knew they would survive the world, where they accepted that they were heroes and realized they each had a future.
"This one?"  Harry looked at it curiously and held it in front of himself as he looked in the mirror.
Moments, like memories, are fleeting. Draco knew this. And as he stared into those vibrant green eyes, alive and sparked with wonder, he wished he could somehow capture this remarkable moment that passed between them.
Casually, Severus set his cup on the table and with just two strides, he reached out and gripped Harry's wrist and dragged him back to the bedroom.
"We are not the Ministry!"  Her eyes are wide, her lips pulled back to reveal square teeth.
"Daddy!"
Once Draco realized Harry had figured out his secret and hadn't descended into crazed fear or developed a rabid desire to jab a stake through his heart, he'd relaxed and had given up trying to act superior.  Really, he was just a normal, average guy.  Well, as normal as a hereditary vampire could be.
"Yes…" he said and felt the teeth bite deep.
"Jump over a fire?" Draco suggested.
The two are no longer circling each other, only calculating and watching for movement.  Draco knows the timing is everything.  Timing and speed.
"Did you just compliment Hermione?"
"What else am I supposed to do?  He complains of being cold."  And amusingly, Harry's color deepened, and Draco wondered what it was the man wasn't telling him.  "Maybe you could convince him to change," Harry bolstered on.  "Tell him you want to talk to him, or something."
"Yes, yes, of course.”  He then bid goodbye to two of his students, who had stayed after class to perfect the Draught of Peace, a potion currently in high demand.  “I will be retiring to my office, Miss Brocklehurst and Mr. Hopkins.  I shall return in due time."
"Hello, Harry," Luna said.  "Hey, Teddy."  She sat in the chair next to Harry and began reading the menu.  A bright blue ribbon was tied around her right pinky finger.  Still standing where he'd stopped when he first spotted Harry, Neville's jaw was slack and his brown eyes were wide with shock.
"Hey," said the brunette.  "Haven't seen you here before."
His own dulled senses.
"Oh really?"  Harry lifted up his hand and started ticking off fingers.  "I saw you drinking blood.  You fly.  Your eyes, they have a bit of a glow to them, you know.  And during the day… dead to the world… literally.  If not a vampire, then what are you?"
Harry blinked once, twice, leaned minutely towards Draco.  Then, with lips almost brushing Draco's, Harry said, "I think I found a way to find Fritz."
Harry rolled his eyes and stepped into the dark.
"I was waiting for you."
"George is fine, the charm is fine.  I'll tell you more when I return.  I'll talk to you later."
With tweezers Draco plucked a stamen and dropped it into the potion he'd prepared in anticipation for this very moment.  Harry stood nearby, practically vibrating with expectation.
"For running out on all of us!  You bastard.  We're here trying to add some sanity to your father's government, and you just run off to Merlin knows where and hide for the last… what fifteen years?"
Draco laughed and then, after some consideration, reached out to slowly touch Tufts, run his hand from the crown of his head, along his back to the end of his tail.  Tufts' skin twitched under his touch, alive, every inch of him alive.
Harry had found out that the Malfoy bloodline, while pureblooded in the broad sense of the term, were also hereditary vampires.
"Excuse me, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley."
"Who would have eaten it?" Severus asked.  He'd been hovering over a lined notepad of yellow paper all morning, periodically scripting out his thoughts and then pausing to ponder some more.
"Oh, Draco," Lucius groaned out with the exasperation of a parent scolding a two year-old who won't stop pulling on the cat's tail.  "Don’t dive into that American trash any longer.  Go find an issue of Sandman, or perhaps Tank Girl.  Something decidedly more British."
The End.
Harry stops speaking and turns away from the sea.  A wall rises between them, and Draco wonders if he should regret the question.  "Let's get below deck.  There's a storm coming."
He'd often reminisced over those first few months following the war before he escaped to France; maudlin thoughts always seemed to grace his doorstep these days.  After his discussion with Harry—or argument depending on how one looked at it—Draco returned to his club to reflect on his life: past, present, and future.  Some might call it wallowing in self-pity—but a Malfoy never wallowed.
With a few concise flicks of her wand the manacles were released, and the door opened.
"Yes.  This is it."
"I bit myself," the left hand said.  "Stop smothering me, you know I can't stand to be smothered."  Harry could just make out the eye, nestled between the soft mounds at the base of the pointer and ring fingers.  Hermione's face turned pink.
"Oh! We are so excited to have you here," she twittered. "Welcome, come in, come in. Sorry for all the cinematics, but we must maintain a certain appearance, I'm sure you understand." Harry caught Draco's eye and winked at him. "I'm Alissa McCormick. It's an honour."
Remus reached up and ran one finger from the corner of his friend's eye to his chin. Yes, this was Sirius. Real. Solid.
The Dark Lord has a stench; it saturates the air, and Draco can taste it on the back of his throat.  It's an odor of putrefaction.  The scent of damnation.  His eyes gleam, reflecting the crimson flames.
"Stop it," he said louder and grabbed Harry's wrist as it was going up for another pass.
Severus
As her voice rose and fell with the tune, all Draco could do was open his mouth and laugh.  He laughed at the absurdity of it, of the utter gall of Harry and Severus, and he laughed with joy.
"Merlin that's a nice arse," Draco said, then suddenly clapped his hand over his mouth, his eyes darting around to see if anyone was near enough to hear what he'd just said.
But here he was. Trudging under the Mexican sun, hot even in February, looking for some vague address that he had been certain he'd found twice, but later realised he stood on the wrong avenue or street or whatever these damned people called their roads.
“I know, Harry.”  Draco’s chest tightened.  “I know.”  He urged Harry to his feet and led him to his bedroom and held him until the shakes gave way to sleep.  Draco stared up at his ceiling, mind shifting over different spells and potions that could heal Harry’s mind.
"Remus, I've been thinking..." Harry opened with, as he laid a plate of food before the scrawny man. Remus pulled up a chair and descended upon the meal, glancing up every so often to listen to Harry. "Malfoy and I have been spending so much time deciphering these scrolls we haven't had time to do any footwork. Would you mind helping us with it?"
He was cursed by the Fae.
Fully covered with the potion, the two men grabbed each other's hands to support each other due to their slippery footing.  Taking a deep breath, Severus began casting something in Greek, the words unknown yet pregnant with power as Severus wove the spell that would send them home.
He wiped his face of the cold rain, a large drop dangling from the end of his nose, grumbling that the worst battle of the century hadn't happened on a beautiful spring morning instead of this bleary autumn day. He was soaked through, no energy to spare for a simple weatherproofing charm. He had to focus. He had to concentrate. He had to be ready.
"Why else do you think he hangs around so much?" Remus asked, then stood and stretched his back.
.  Harry's eyes inched over the surface of Draco's face that now burned, and slowly, like an admission gained through torture, he nodded.
In this odd land of gray, Remus found freedom.
"Yes," he replied.  It was a very stupid conversation considering the circumstances.
"Sleeping," Remus said between mouthfuls, finally slowing down after about eight pieces, not that Draco was counting.
Harry looked back towards the counter and saw George, trailed by Ron, emerging from the back room.  George tossed a rubber ball from hand to hand.  Harry left the display of inflatable charmed rugs, "Guaranteed to hover for one hour per rug," that he'd pretended had interested him and stood by the other men.
As the three unraveled the lengthy roll of paper, Harry's eyes jumped over the page.  The writing was in neat, precise print.  It was Hermione's, in full, living colour as if she'd just jotted down a note to Harry, Ron, and Remus, and it wasn't some final hint calling out from beyond a comatose grave.
He went to retrieve Severus', sitting in the little holster by the door.
Harry stripped down and started the water flowing.  The showers in Grimmauld Place were quite fancy, but sometimes the temperature was a bit temperamental.  He tested the water with his palm and after some minor adjustments, stepped into the water.
Now, it seemed, he was trapped here on a 10-acre parcel of land in a world of strangers.
says.
"Potter.  I want to go."  His voice is a smidgen above a whisper, sharp like glass.
He had to get Harry out of here and soon.
, he wondered.  He hoped.
"Do you know anything about an artefact that curses people, the effect being drainage of their magical energy? Perhaps something South American?"
As the leader flew at Harry, Harry met the challenge, curses burning his lips.  Red flash.  Blue.  Cleansing white.  Slash of claw and fang.  The creature screamed.
They crossed through the door and walked straight into the Potions classroom.  Where Hermione and Snape were doing unmentionable things, with Peeves overlooking the entire scene.
"Malfoy, I want you to come back.  We'll send another Auror to the next site.  This is too deep for you."
Unfortunately, that was not the only dirty limerick Draco knew, and he regaled them endlessly as the two men in the kitchen completed dinner.
"No," Harry said.  "Just until you wake up."
His morning stiffy brushed against the sheets, sparking intensely along its length.  His need to pee and the scent of coffee urged him up with bull-headed determination.
"How far back are you planning on digging, Boot?" Draco demands.  It has been over an hour and a sharp pain claws down his spine.  The ropes force him into uncomfortable positions, binding tighter if he shifts left, tighter if he slouches an inch.  A lesser form of crucifixion.  "I've told you everything I know about the Dark Lord.  I have nothing more to offer.  Now, either cut me lose, let me go, or kill me now, because your constant droning is a hell unto itself."
The hills were littered. They paid a heavy toll during the final battle; his eyes danced upon the contorted faces of his friends and comrades forever frozen in the struggle against the Dark Lord's forces, a memorial to all that was sacrificed for peace.
"Away with you, little vermin.  To think I thought you were cute when I was a child.  Obviously, I was naïve and sweet-natured in my youth."  Draco lifted his wand, and Harry reached out to stop him.
"What exactly do you mean?" Draco asked.  "Severus, you've always been a man to make your own choices."
"Well," said Draco, "that wasn't very productive."
"Potter.  I want to talk to you."  Draco looked around the room, the institutional white now slightly coated in a layer of long cat fur.  He seemed shocked at the minor gathering of his old foes.
The room was empty except for one thing.
"Malfoy, please.  He's been missing all day.  Don't be a bastard."
Draco reached out for the paper, paused, then took it from Harry's feeble grip.  It had been crumpled in one corner, the tacked on letters pulling free in places from the Muggle paste.  Draco held it tightly between a forefinger and thumb and read the threat.  His eyebrows rose, his lips pursed, and Harry stared at him, hope sparkling within the green of his eyes.
Songs: in order of appearance.
"This is the way out," Harry said flatly.
"Of course!" Draco said.  "I completely agree."
Apparently, his old boss had something up his sleeve, because he sweet talked the ferret into meeting with Harry to discuss, civilly, whatever it was Harry needed.
"Thank you so much, Mr. Malfoy."  She held out her hand to be shaken again.
"Yeah, thanks."  He followed Bledsoe upstairs, through a soundproof door, down a long hallway and to a very stately office.
"Greg!" Draco called out, pushing his way past the two men poised to attack and opened the door—his own wand at the ready just in case it did prove a trap.
"Fucking leave us alone!" he yelled, pulled back his fist once more, but it was stalled by strong fingers wrapped around his wrist.
and snuggled into that warm embrace until they both fell asleep.
And there was no question: this was Draco Malfoy.
He'd eaten all of his provisions before his fever had hijacked his clear thought, and he remembered throwing his empty water jug to the far end of the cave in annoyance at discovering it empty.
"Well," he began.  "Let me start from… well, from the point in the ritual when I wanted to totally rule over you.  It was so odd… and so fucking amazing.  That power."  Harry looked up and stared at Draco, then looked over at Severus.  "I just wanted you to be mine, both of you, your power, your bodies, your souls.  Mine.  It was overwhelming."  He stopped and stared over at Remus.  Then he swallowed and continued.  "But intellectually I knew that wasn’t what I wanted, so I pulled back and forced all of my frustration out on the Mark.  Voldemort's signature finally fled and that dominant part of me eradicated your old Mark.
"No problem.  I'm quite familiar with Merlin myself," he said, one eyebrow cocked in amusement.
Spurred into action, Harry dove through the air and slammed into Draco, wrapping his arms around his friend, pulling him to the ground.
"Bibble, have you been stealing sheep from this field?"  Harry stood over the poor little man, wand steady and aimed at his overly large nose.  What Draco had first though was an amorphous head was really a floppy, woolen cap.
Kingsley nodded thoughtfully.
"It's good to see you," Potter said, eager like a puppy.  Draco didn't answer; he only rolled his eyes and looked over at Lupin, who wore a matching eager-puppy look, though admittedly not as blinding and brainless.
Draco stood and waved goodbye has he retreated from Harry's mind, passing through the unformed memories and thoughts and finally finding himself in his own body once again.
"Kingsley…"
Maybe if he took shorter steps, it could make the room be twenty paces long.  Make his cage grow.
"Who," Draco asked, growing annoyed. He'd add 'develop super sensitive senses' to his to-do list once he returned home.
The two men sat for a while longer staring at each other, tense uncertainty aching in their muscles. Perhaps they should just get the fuck out of there. Screw the others and just flee this hellhole. But as soon as that thought crossed his mind, Draco tossed it aside, knowing not only that there was no way Harry would ever abandon his friends, but also understanding that he wouldn't either. Plus, there was the added intrigue of that Staff and Draco never was a man who could turn away from some new mystery of a magical artefact. He blamed Snape.
With a nod, Harry stood and approached Draco.  He seized the hem of his shirt and pulled it off.  Draco saw his scars and rib bones highlighting his torso.  He'd always looked malnourished.  Harry jumped up and sat on the examination table that Draco had long given up on configuring back into the stool, ready for Draco's prodding and spells.
"Yes, come in," Draco said. Ron and Harry exchanged glances, passing secret knowledge through faint facial expressions that Draco read like an open book. Stepping back, Ron let Greg enter but still held his wand aloft. Harry had lowered his to his side.
He looks from Harry's to the Dark Lord's forms.  With hands shaking, fucking shuddering with palsy, he fumbles with the eye patch, avoiding that hollow recess.  Harry had said that all that was needed was contact.  The patch and the Dark Lord's skin.  Patch in hand, Draco stumbles towards the fallen Lord, and with little finesse, he drops to his knees and presses the leather patch to the bare skin of the Dark Lord's hand.
Malfoy, still standing, smiled brightly.  Harry couldn't tear his eyes away.  "Well, you see, I think someone put some mutagen in a bomb and set it to go off over the castle, attempting to create a world of mutants for a better tomorrow."  He nodded eagerly.
Harry’s sturdy form was sprawled half across Hermione’s legs, half in his chair, as he snored lightly, worn down from his endless vigil.  He and Remus had taken turns, been by her side for days, just in case the mediwizards and witches had discovered something, anything, or Hermione's sheer perseverance shrugged off the unknown curse.  Since Remus was still attempting to hold down a job, it fell to Harry to spend most of his time in the hospital room.  The wait proved fruitless.
But he never did believe in miracles and impossible things were just that, impossible.
"Then, call Draco.  If you'd quit being a pillock, you'd realise he is your best choice. Here, I'll do it for you."  Ron twisted on his toe and sprinted for the Floo, locking Harry in the back room with a flick of his wand as he tossed in the Powder and called up the Auror division.  By the time Harry had charmed the lock open and hurled some great one-liners at Ron—he would have to remember them later for George—someone had already run off to retrieve Draco.
, and he grudgingly acknowledged that this craphole did hold a few treasures.  He picked up a small leather-bound pamphlet on charmed potions and flipped through it, deciding to buy it for Hermione as a 'You Made It' gift once she was cured.
"Really? What's going on? They're killin' us. Is it the Ministry?" Greg's eyes pleaded for Draco to offer him some explanation, to tell him everything was going to be fine and nobody else they knew would turn up dead.
However, he could sense no spells active.  Nothing.
They had contacted Ron immediately, of course.  He'd Flooed in from Mexico, petting Hermione's hair with worry in one moment and in the next boiling with righteous anger about how nobody on this end was doing anything about it.  Harry withstood three hours of Ron's berating words for quitting the Auror Program, and when he finally burned himself out, they sat in sorrowful silence together.  But since Ron was knee deep in his mission, and he knew there was nothing he could do, he was forced to return to work, and Harry returned to useless pacing and avoiding attractive young men and curious medical staff.
"No," Harry assured, his face burning.  They stared at each other for a moment, and Harry worried that Snape might press him further, or read his mind, so he said, "I haven't been out at all.  I'm glad we're going walking together."
"Stephen, is this guy harassing you?"
Casually he leaned down, presumably to tie his shoe, and dropped Crookshanks to the ground.  The cat, sly as ever, quickly ran beneath the bed and waited.
Harry laughed, and Draco took a step away.  Maybe madness was catching.
The blood hadn't been that appetizing.  Though they ran and screamed and he'd punished them for their crimes, he was sure it was supposed to be better than this.  Not that he really knew anything; Harry knew more about what he'd been turned into than Draco did.
"Yes, he goes by Tufts," she said with a warm smile, petting the long hair on the end of his left ear.  The purr grew loud.  Draco suppressed the urge to frown at the noise.
It was the first fire of the fall that they lit in the fireplace.  It blazed cheerily, and Harry was reminded of chess games and couch snuggling with his two men.  Things had been so perfect back then.
It all tasted like dust.
Draco smiled; he'd been waiting for this.  "Need any company?" he asked
"No idea," Harry said. "Draco?"
"What?"
"Harry'd done that ritual that he developed, the one to break Malfoy's spell,” Neville said.  “People were angry and it almost looked like a mob might rally against your father.  When he'd left, most of the people followed him.  So then it was just us, in the street with a few stragglers, mainly those who didn't quite understand what was going on."
"Am I interrupting?" Draco sneered.
"Can I help?" he offered.
"Fuck it," he muttered and leaned forward, embracing Harry in a rough kiss. It was embarrassing, how eager and close he wanted to be to Harry, how even in this moment of death, he could brush it all aside as insignificant when he had Harry in his arms. Between kisses, Draco breathed sweet words over Harry's lips; silent promises that he hoped fervently to keep once they saw the light of day. He never knew his heart could beat this fast.
"Well," Harry said, breaking the lull, "did you have time to think about everything from last night?"
"Actually, Snape… Severus," Harry said cautiously, but Severus only grunted in response.  "I want you two to keep me in check.  There is something inside of me… that wants to control, and I'll need both of you to remind me of who I am.  Keep me sane.  Keep me myself."
Galator Cullpepper and Pansy Parkinson blink step onto the main deck from their own, the farthest instant travel available since the Order damaged the Disapparition Net.  Then blink again, Galator's long blond hair a sunspot in her vision.  Luna's specs sparkle, seeking out the invaders' intermediate presence, where their bodies are in that transitional movement phase, trapped in the in-between.
him.  But yeah, I'm over him."  And Draco felt a hand touch his back, run down his shoulder blade along his arm and grab his own in a tight fist.
"I've been having some very disturbing dreams." Remus started, not sure how to tell Harry he had potential visions of his godfather.
"How can you touch me?"  The words were thick.
As a curtain of silence built up around them—and other magic that Draco couldn't analyse without overtly using his wand—did its work, Harry mused, "Let me see, where to start."
Draco throws his napkin on the table, an impotent action, but still Pansy flinches next to him.  Draco turns to storm away, but is stopped short, pulled tight by the Anchor around his neck.
"Sirius, we'll help Remus. Stop the Staff! Please!" Harry wanted to run to him, to stand by him, but he knew that he'd never escape that deadly hold. The Staff wanted Harry and Harry's own fear of that kept him away, fear of losing himself, fear of what the Staff would accomplish if Harry was its slave. Draco was on his knees, slick with silver but no longer wiping at it, instead sucking the substance off Remus with his wand.
Tufts finally brought them to a closed door, its golden handle glimmering in the fluorescence of an overhead light.  It seemed to taunt him.  He didn't want to turn that handle; he was taken back to that second floor room in Samokov.
Being a larger city, it took them an entire day to find the address.  Luckily they could mostly decipher the map.
"Right, and somewhere in some other universe, you're also the normal one."
The Dark Mark was gone!
"Just watch the car," Draco said as it drove by Hyde Park, past Piccadilly Circus and straight into Diagon Alley, where the Ferrari stalled once more.
Potter lowered his wand and squinted into Draco's light.  Then he shrugged and looked back down at the gnome.  "You can't take anymore," he said.  "These sheep are under my protection.  I use their wool, too."
"Revenge is not noble, Draco," Lucius said.  Thomas, lounging on the idyllic pastureland, growled as he munched on seal blubber, but didn't have much else to add.
"It's you," Harry heard from his right, and his blood froze.
"When we leave here I expect you both to visit often, and regularly.  I've grown fond of both of you and I don’t think I could be appeased by just one."
Dumbfounded, Harry could only stare, then something warm kneaded his insides and he struggled to keep the laughter inside.  "I don't know, Draco.  Maybe they just took the full-sized car and shrunk it, for easy display purposes."
With great care he lifted the egg and carried it awkwardly in his arms, while Harry leaned on his side, hobbling along while floating Charlie along with a
arm that was attached to his body but had no feeling and realized why.  It was in a stasis field like Harry's had been after he'd been attacked by that creature.  He lifted his good hand and felt where his Dark Mark would be through his clothing.  Strange heat emanated from it, pulsing with the beat of his heart.  He grabbed the cloth and drew the sleeve up.
With clean skin and a beardless face, Teddy could see the discolouration from bruises and scars pop out in relief.  He'd cheered over every article of clothing Teddy'd offered him.  He'd fingered Teddy's silk shirt like the material was a brand new invention. He rolled the rough cotton of blue jeans between his hands and rubbed a scratchy wool sweater against his face.  Sometimes he would inhale the scent, taking in deep breathes, making Teddy uncomfortable.  He had washed them; he was sure of it.
," he said and kissed Draco on the temple.
The wards surrounding the cottage and land remained.  The forest still contained the unknown, because Harry had never ventured there.  His world: it was microscopic.  It was safe.
He would do this because he could.
"So at this point, Hermione knew, through Bulstrode, that old Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers were gathering and that this curse was spreading, mainly through those ranks. She wasn't sure what other avenues to take. She wanted to talk to me and Ron, but again Bulstrode wouldn't let Hermione tell anyone about it, especially people who might know her."
He had faced both dark wizards and vampires in his day, but nothing seeped of evil like the artefact nestled below the floorboards, hidden away like a dreadful secret. Its magnificence was disarming; its hollow need was far, far worse.
Harry's head dropped into his hands, the note crushed up in one fist, and he mumbled something that sounded like debt and tight.
"Well," Duncan said, drawing the word out in two syllables, "why don't ya meet me out back in a few?"
"Severus!" Harry called out.  "Draco!"  The rainbows traversed the sky; the multi-colored reflection doubling on the surface of the lake.  It was spectacular.  "Come here and look at this!"
He chuckled at that thought.  He chuckled at Harry and shook his head at himself and his odd nervousness.  Nothing had changed.  Harry was still his friend and this new revelation would change nothing.
A wave of invincibility swallows Draco down, blocking out the world, the war, the dawning of the broken day.  A gust whips his hair, tugging it with anger and with greed as lightning flashes between the clouds above like silverfish dance upon the waves.  There is so much energy, it spills over with nowhere to go; sucking, drowning, swallowing him and soon he is lost in it, unable to surface.
"This is chicken," Harry said, pointing to the
Then he stood and began a sixth iteration of the Storcher's Mending Potion.  That last one certainly wasn't viable.
He reached for Harry, snatched his wrist and pulled his unresisting body towards him. Then he reached for Remus, who pliantly let himself be hauled forward as well. And so, with the two men in tow like misbehaving school boys, Draco turned from the moonlit room and bone-white arch to search for an escape from purgatory.
The wind pulls at Harry's hair, and his gaze slips down to a spot at the center of Draco's chest.  Above them, sea birds screech, heading for solid ground to weather out the impending storm.  Harry turns back to the sea, his gaze soft.
Harry stood heavy on his left leg, wand held limply at his side, eyes glued on the fallen form. A moment passed. And then another. And finally Harry drew in a shocked breath, a wave of tension shuddering through his body as he fell to his knees, wand silently dropping to the churned ground under his feet.
Draco was sitting pensively on the couch, leaning forward, his elbows on knees, pressing his fingers against each other then relaxing them. He did this over and over again. When Harry entered, he glanced up and smiled wanly.
Pansy is livid, smoking like he hasn't seen her since Vince practiced the Crucio Curse on her puffskein.  "Be good to her."  The words menace, attack with subtle grace, and Draco categorizes what Pansy must be thinking and feeling to push her to this precipice.
"You have another visitor.  Kingsley Shacklebolt from the Ministry."
And the orb longed and the orb hungered. It longed to be whole and it hungered for more power. It knew who it wanted. He would get that wizard for his precious jewel.
"Why don't you do it, a solo?  It will be grand," Harry suggested, his eyes wide and hopeful.
"Follow the instructions.  I think I can do that.  Well I'm off.  I have to make sure wonder boy hasn't blown anything else up.   I can't believe you thought it wise to break him free and dump him on me."
He glanced around at the headstones, ancient and crumbling in places.  The snow smothered everything, muffling all noise except for the crunch of footfalls.  A black cat sat atop a square monument, tail swishing a bare spot on the marble.
"I see we have a guest," came a voice from within.
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Lupin."  She nodded at them, recognition in her eyes as they darted to Harry's forehead, searching out the dual scars crossed in a tilted X.  How he hated that.  "Miss Granger is suffering from several unknown curses, and we have our best medical curse breakers working on it.  She is not in poor physical health; the spells appear to have affected her mind and magic only.  We know that Miss Granger works in the Spell Development sector of the Ministry.  If an experimental spell is affecting her it might interfere with her recovery.  Do you know if anything like that might be involved, an accident at work maybe?"
"What do you remember?" Draco asked lowering his voice.
Over his shoulder Draco sees some of the merry gang of the Marauders.  With Terry, Luna, and Laura are Hermione Granger and her pet twit Ron Weasley.  If that wasn't a mismatched pair…
Right now he had to watch out for them, had to protect them. They were buried under tonnes of dirt and stone, their minds bent and taut, ready to snap under any more pressure from just one more shock. Even as they followed him blindly, he still clung onto the fact that they were there, behind him, every step of the way. It was easier to think of them stressed and blank with trauma than to imagine the alternative, because he didn't want to think what it would mean if they weren't there with him at all.
"Not bad," he said, and Draco lost hope.  It hadn't worked.
He couldn't forget it, the sizzle through his body.  The whisper against his ear.  Severus really did have a sexy voice.
"What now, Margie?" the other drawled as she took a bite of her cake.  Harry wished his sandwich would just come so could go to Central Park to eat alone in silence.
"Ah, Miss Granger. How's she doing?"
"But he's not dead, that means there's a chance," Harry said with optimistic energy.  Things weren't as bad as they could have been.  His gaze returned to Draco and what they saw alarmed him.  Draco was shifty and twitchy and he didn't look at all pleased.  In fact, he seemed agitated, almost cagey, like a wild beast that'd been backed into a corner.  Desperation, that's what it was.  Draco looked desperate.
"What?  The Minister's son?  No.  It couldn’t be him.  I can't imagine he would be
"Gregory, please," Draco quietly interrupted.  "Something is happening, and I need to know if our old organization might be rallying for any reason."
"The Confundus Charm, Bone Cruncher Curse, extensive Cruciatus and Legilimency.  Also he'd been under Confutimago and Scindomago variants, to name a few.  Those are the major curses that his body and magic show signs of being subjected to.  But it isn't just that Harry," Pansy cocked an eyebrow and Draco continued on, "is under the after-effects of all of these curses combined, there are also other curses, more recent, that I've never seen before.  I have a lot more research to do.  A lot more."
He tilted his head down and looked at Harry through his thick lashes.  "So, the… er… biting and blood-drinking doesn't bother you?" he asked.
Harry had wondered why Draco always looked so pale back in school.
Tufts was amused and Draco couldn't help but let the light emotion consume him.
Draco stopped and thought about it.  He'd been raised speaking to portraits and ghosts of the dead.  People lived and then were gone, but often there was something special, something eternal that was left behind.  Was there something else, something other than enchanted ink and ethereal spirits afraid to go on?  "Harry, I've no idea, but the spirit does exist and in most cases, it goes somewhere, somewhere we haven't quite yet discovered.  Maybe those wizards in the Department of Mysteries know, but I know I sure as hell don't and it wasn't passed down from the wisdom of my ancestors."
, though I have seen neither, and it is simple to assume I of this world could have set up this cabin for such a hideaway as I did in our own dimension."
"We can share a room, we don't mind," Harry said with a gesture at Draco, red flags of embarrassment gracing his cheeks. Draco stared open-mouthed, then smiled. What the hell. What did it matter? He had no concern for how others would perceive him, because here was Harry and he was smiling. At him. Openly accepting him for all that he was.
"Not so many wizards," Draco corrected.
Draco shielded his eyes from the sun.  "CatBoy.  You naughty boy, where have you been?"
"So, what would you like to talk about?" she asked politely.
"Come on, even I know we can't stay here forever," he began jovially.  "Say we get some food sent our way in the next few days, we still can't keep hiding here.  There is a world out there and yes, I'm not quite ready to return either, but eventually we need to.  You're already getting squirrelly being stuck here.  I think," he looked over at Snape then back to Harry, "I think that we should move on soon, help with the war, so that…" he swallowed and examined his hands twisted in his lap, "so that what happened to us, doesn't happen to anyone else."
A shallow choking sound preceded a moment of silence.
"Let me go!"  The fairy squirmed and Draco's fingers clenched and suddenly all the struggle left the little body.  After that, Draco's fingers relaxed and the fairy looked sourly upon them
Draco's heart turned to stone at the sight of his father.  His scowl caused those close to him to move a few steps away, keeping a sharp eye on his features like one would an unfamiliar man on a dark street.  As usual, Draco kept his mind locked tight.  He could never be too safe amongst these fanatic patriots.
The temperature dropped in the room as Harry's relaxed form pulled tight.  "Did what?" he drawled.
"So, Harry.  Didn't work out with Guinevere, huh?"  Hermione sat in the chair between Harry and Ron, and Draco leaned in to listen.  Harry rolled his eyes.
The spell shot from the far side, yellow and heavy in the air. It slammed into the blood basalt and the cage shattered sending little shards of stone airborne. A shard hurtling through the air pierced through his shield and gashed Harry's cheek. The blood trickled down his face, mixing with his sweat of fear and exertion.
It's all just a lie.
Harry shook his head and then rubbed his face down with the palms of his hands. His eyes gained some focus and Draco relaxed. "Let's go in here," Harry said, this time more confident, more himself.
"Biscuit before you leave?"  She held up a plate with one flabby arm.  There were butter and chocolate dipped ones neatly stacked on it.  He plucked up a chocolate biscuit and lifted it up in salute.
"He found out Ginny was dating a woman and now he's all excited he has a lesbian in the family, like he's trendy now or something," Hermione said with her perfected eye roll. "It isn't like you don't already have a gay best friend, and she's really bisexual. Oh, Remus, do you think I could get some unicorn blood from you." She batted her eyelashes at Remus, which only made him laugh more.
"I know you," Potter said to him.
As they continued eating, Draco told Harry about some of the cases that he and the team had solved, inwardly preening at the interest Harry showed, the keen ear he turned towards Draco's stories.
He nodded at his mother, "I do, Mother.  The red ones were so full of bees.  I enjoyed watching them fly around."
It took only a moment for them to revive the monstrous snake, and it was then that Draco became aware that his pocket had grown warm.  The heat had slipped into unbearable without even his notice, and he quickly dug into his trousers to pull out the locket with Snape's portrait, the moonstone glowing white hot.
"Don’t worry about it.  Let's go."
Yes, indeed, a storm was brewing.
"Oh yeah.  He must be.  Vigilante Hero.  That's New York for you."
offer and Draco had better not screw it up.
"You're not dying," Draco simply said.  This was perhaps the thousandth conversation they'd had like this and he worried at this fixation.
Lucius, to Draco's shock, suggested that Potter had a point.
"He was always looking out for me, saving my life. And I hated him." Guilt could be an overpowering force. Draco reached out and touched his shoulder. It wasn't one of those friendly slaps on the back like Ron always gave him. This was more. Draco's hand lingered, an almost caress full of compassion and understanding.
Draco's arm, as usual, was lying across Harry, a solid, comforting weight.  Only this time Draco was calmly rubbing him, slow circles over his T-shirt clad chest.  He'd been doing it for a half hour.  While new, and therefore odd, it was nice, and Harry didn't want to get up because it would mean Draco would stop and Harry didn't think he was ready for that.
"But!  There has to be some other way… A modification to the potion so it only seeks out…"
"Ted Riley? So, we were right," said Remus, baring his teeth in a sneer.
"I don't like to talk about that."
Snape had always been a man of personal denial.  Controlled.  Sharp.  For too long he'd denied himself simple pleasures, because it had been unwise to offer fodder to those who would use anything against him: his job, pets, favored students, heirloom keepsakes.  He still hated Lucius for breaking his mother's singing bowl.  Then it'd turned into more of a form of retribution.  'Look at me, I'm without love, I'm without home, I'm without joy… Have I suffered fully for my sins?'
"Yeah?" Dog Man asked.  The heat from his glare burned Draco's cheek, but he refused to look that direction.  He watched Potter instead.
"Are you certain," Severus asked, his face hidden from Harry's gaze, but he could hear the desire and the joy in his scarred voice.
"Oh, I'm sure the tumor never had a fighting chance, but I'm not so sure of your prowess on the date.  Spiced beef?"
Lily, who wasn't really Lily, looked into the mirrored backing of the bar and caught his own eyes floating amongst the back sides of countless liquor bottles: green and full of a hollow loneliness.  He'd gotten quite good at the feminine disguise, wrapped up in soft silks and an even softer nature, but his Adam's apple was left noticeable for those who knew what to look for.  Not that he would have gone home with the American.  Getting his arse kicked once was a valuable lesson, so he became very sure of his bloke before he ever made a move.
"What are you going to do now that she's better? She's going to want her place back, you know," Draco said, his grey eyes sharp. Harry wondered just what he was up to.
"Malfoy," Harry warned.
His cup was empty so he stood to fill it from the sink.  Over the last few days things had fallen into a comfortable routine.  After he got over his jealousy, constantly supported by Draco's ravenous sexual needs and affection, he backed off of his overly possessive feelings.
He remembered looking down upon that empire of broken possibilities.
Harry threw a squeaky chew toy at Ron's head, which he easily ducked.  Working at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes really toned those reflexes.
“You gave him water you spat in?” Laura Madley asks as she sets a platter full of carved chicken onto the dining table between the other dishes of food.  Millicent spears a chunk with her fork and dumps it on her plate next to some discolored peas from a tin and two boiled eggs.
"Yeah."  It was the only word his addled brain could formulate.  Hand in hand the two men jogged to Draco's room, the same room they'd been sharing for months now.  They passed through the door, shedding clothing as they kissed and touched and drowned themselves in each other.  With a bounce they landed on the bed and Draco felt like laughing, giggling at his good fortune.
"Harry. You're being an idiot. Listen, Remus can find us on his own. We can leave signs that he can follow once he calms his crazy, wolfy head and comes to his senses. Let's go." He regrettably dropped Harry's hand, grown warm in his own, and stepped through the doorway.
"Okay, I guess.  Odd.  Really odd."  He watched as Draco's wand passed over him once, twice, and finally he batted it away and did the thing that Draco, himself, had desired.
With a squint to his eye, he examined Potter's retreating back until he disappeared.  Then he pulled out his wand and tested the blanket for magic.  It was clean.  He tucked his wand away and reached out for it.  The fabric was soft, though it still had the typical scratch of wool, even fine wool.  Nothing like the jumper he'd felt yesterday.  Still, it was fine craftsmanship with bright greens and deep blues.  “You made this?” he asked as he ran his hand over it.
"Yes. Let's go."
"Wait!  No!"
"I'll… ah, let you get settled in.  I'll call you for dinner in an hour," and with that Draco turned his back on his guest and fled the room.
Finally, Snape stood.  "Get up, brats.  Let's go outside."
"Help!"
"Mr. Popicon, I'm so sorry we're late. You see, we had this problem this morning…"
"What?"  He glanced down; did he still have an erection?
Waiting was one of Harry's foremost personal vexations and he felt for the last four years all he'd been doing was waiting. Sure there were skirmishes, conflicts, plenty of battle plans prepared and unleashed, but it really was all aimed at this one fight. He and Voldemort. Hero and Villain. Promise of a future and resignation to an archaic past. For all of wizarding and Muggle kind, Harry knew he could not fail.
"Perogies?"
"Merlin's balls, Potter.  You didn't tell me this place was still infested.  And what the hell is that thing?"
"It isn't complete. You didn't include everything in that report."
Draco looked out at the view, amused at how far they had to climb up the hill.  Then he turned to Greg.  "You remember how I was passing messages to the Order?"  Draco asked.  Greg nodded.  During their time with the Death Eaters, Gregory didn't know that Draco had turned traitor.  It all came to light after Greg ran and Draco stayed, covering his friend's tracks for him.  Vincent had fallen in a skirmish before the final battle and losing him had left Greg with less loyalty towards the Death Eaters and more interest in living.  Through the past few years, little pieces of information had finally fallen into place, and Greg had figured out more of Draco's involvement.  "Well," he continued, "someone recently contacted me through the same means.  It was my old contact from the war, and I was asked about some dark curse that seems to be spreading.  Another of my contacts has told me that some ex-Death Eaters, either those who renounced the Dark Lord or those who didn't get caught, have been moving in concert again.  Forces are gathering.  And I finally learned that there have been planned attacks throughout England and Wales, though the public is kept blind to the fact.  The Ministry is keeping a tight lid on this one.  I only guess that all of these things are connected.  So, do you know anything?"
, who'd followed him all sixth year, saved his life in that last.  He'd always resented the prat for that.  He was Draco's prime adversary and he'd saved his life.  He owed Potter and they both knew it.
Harry reached out, no longer appeased with watching, and brushed Snape's hair with his fingers, then ran the tips along his skin.  With his other hand he pressed lightly against the back of Draco's head as it rose and fell.  And in this gentle touch, he felt a part of it.
"Potter, you want to help me with a highly delicate potion with which your friend will be treated?" Draco chuckled, and Harry, while disappointed, laughed in shy agreement. Remus inhaled, looked about to speak, but shut his mouth with an audible 'click'.
"I don't know.  Yes, I like him.  He… He grows on you, like an ugly van Gogh you walk by every day.  Eventually you forget how contrasting its parts are and just enjoy it for its whole.  And Christine—I will always love her.  But she's gone.  I think it's about time I get busy with life again."
"Harry?  I don't know, Malfoy.  He wasn't in the common room this morning.  Why don't you ask Ron, he might know."  She smiled, nodded once to Draco, and then fled from the Great Hall.  Definitely up to something.
Slowly, Draco looked up from his crouched position; eyes wide like a frightened horse, a vicious sneer marring his smooth features.  The expression was incongruous and ugly.
As Plincher and Weasley continued to search for an exit, they heard a large explosion. The Agents followed in the most direct route they could find through the passageways (see Appendix A for facility map).
Snape flickered his tongue.
"Is that wizardman having
"Harry, did you just giggle?" Draco whispered, eyebrow arched.
Part of Draco hates him, a very large part.  Hates him with a burning passion, but he only nods, nods and waits and listens to all the things that are not being said.  Because, though he's trapped on a vermin infested heap of junk, apparently the renegades don't mean him harm.  Unfortunately, the real clincher, the part that frustrates Draco on oh so many levels, is the aura of confidence exuding from Harry.  The deep self-awareness, the pride, the assurance that he can stand up to anything, race through Hades, and still come out unscathed.  That… That is what speeds up Draco's heart, causes his brain to fizzle when he rather wishes to toss off something disarming and witty, but none of Draco's vast piles of scathing remarks are within reach when Potter's full attention is on him.
"Oh, they're exchanging crew, sharing supplies, having a gam."
The woman laughed, childlike, joyful, as if ready to eat cake covered in candies.
wanted to be Draco's sidekick.  That was a laugh.  Didn't Lucius know he was so much more?
Draco brushed his hair out of his face once more and lifted his chin.  “Would you quit talking with that snake, Harry?  And to think, you make the poorly postulated assumption that I'm the mad one.”
"Really?" he asked, his small voice echoing into forever.
The grit and gravel on the roof dug into Harry's shoulders and the back of his head where he lay out flat on the rough surface, but he paid it little attention.  It was the emptiness he focused on, within and without.
Kogelmann began to cackle.
Harry's jaw clenched and his nostrils flared, as if coping with his own unexpected desires.  Draco could read it all there, plain as the note demanding the Founder's artefact.
Harry decided rather than flame this ego any larger than it already was, to just move on.  "So, the key’s a book?  Where did yours go?"
"You okay in there?"
" Harry moaned out.  "I've been… hmm, Severus… been thinking about it…
"No.  I'm worried about Macnair.  He continues to presume he can make moves on my possessions, and I'm afraid he might try to overstep his bounds and make a play for you."  Severus gazed at Draco, giving him a very significant look that needed no interpretation, not that much needed interpreting between the two wizards anymore.  They had been together as Master and Toy for years, ever since they fled Hogwarts, ever since Severus had killed Dumbledore when Draco had failed.  And Severus praised that day, praised the event as a day where Draco hadn't become a killer, foul and cold and living without a heart.  As it was, Draco was the only thing left that kept Severus sane.  Everyone believed Draco was his young lover.  In fact, Draco was given to him as his toy, his
"Draco!" Harry called. "Hurry, I gotta brush my teeth and use the loo."
"Umm, yeah… Thanks."  Kiss along the shoulder.  Kiss on his pectoral.
"Hello, Mr. Malfoy," she said with her typical exuberance.  "Delivery for you."  Draco watched as she tipped her coral cap and curtsied.
"Beer's good."  Potter licked his upper lip.
"Yeah, and now he's explosive and I'm the one housing the freak," Draco growled.
Harry nodded.
Draco stood from his chair and began pacing behind his desk. "So what now?"
But he hadn't figured out Harry was gay.
Damn, Harry
"Lily?" Draco questioned… were there really two people here?
"Stellas, boys?" Margie asked, and both men nodded.
wearing a cape!"  She laughed, apparently delighted by this new fact.
He'd never even topped before.  Would he be typecast now, never to break out of this role he'd somehow trapped himself in?
In a daze, Harry nodded, thinking of what Draco had said. "Yeah, sure. Here?"
Tufts thought with awe.
Millicent slides a bowl across the smooth surface of the dining table, cramped with officers and guests.  It bumps into a glass of pumpkin juice, almost knocking it over, but Draco stalls the tilt with one finger.  Millicent grins at him, her mouth full of yellow mush, and he shakes his head at her.
"Well, is it public knowledge?"  Obviously, Malfoy was angry too, and the two Slytherins faced each other.  Teddy, Neville and Luna remained huddled together for protection in case anything came flying their way.
And whether it was a lucky break or not, Ginny offered to go with him.
When the moonstone glowed and the snake began to sardonically berate them for bothering him in his well-earned retirement, Harry realized why the cadence of the words, the tone, the pacing—the voice for lack of a better description—sounded so familiar.
"Yes, yes, but I'm calling for your friend."  Draco grumbled, he didn't really want to be surrounded by Aurors, but he certainly didn't want to get cursed by the likes of Schooner.  He pulled out the mirror, enlarged it and pushed his magic through the handle.
"Draco, we need to hurry," he groaned out, desperately attempting to occlude his mind, cut off any pathway that the orb might be forging to control him. It tickled his brain and dug in, with claws, with teeth, with barbed hooks. Harry felt each cut, each pierce. "Draco!" As panic snuffed all sense, the air zinged with magical energy. Small items rose into the air, candle chandeliers began to sway in a non-existent breeze.
"I have no idea how to get us back.  You stumbled here, and I tore open a one way portal.  We need to find the Fae and get them to tell us how to return."  Harry nodded, then stifled a yawn.  "And Harry," Draco sounded put out, "you need to strengthen your Occlumency to counteract the Fae Charms of this place.  You'll end up sleeping your life away if you succumb to their power."
"Anything for you, my Princess, anything for you."
The nutcracker's eye glittered in the dim light.
“I can talk to him, and—” Harry pointed at the locket and brilliant stone, bright as a miniature star, resting among the acorns and pine cones, "—I think that makes it fairly obvious.”
"Harry, it's two bloody o'clock in the morning.  What the fuck do you want?"  Ron's hair clung to the side of his head like a frightened bird, and he was blinking the sleep from his eyes.
"Would that be possible?" she asked.
"Because when I change, I can't take anything with me… not even my wand," he said with resignation.
"No.  I gave you truth."
Harry smiled up at him, trying to calm himself as well as Draco.  "Yes, Draco.  I want to do this."  He nodded his head and then let it fall back, exposing his throat.
"What, need out?"
And then an overwhelming surge of sorrow and loss and unfulfilled desire practically knocked Draco to the floor.
"You like this, yes?" Snape asked, and Harry nodded, then realized he was asking Draco.
"Here." Snape handed Harry his robe.  Gratefully, Harry grabbed for it and wrapped it around himself and Draco.  Then he held out Greyback's wand.  Harry took it.  "Now, you miscreants, follow me."
Harry broke out into another barrage of weeping as Hermione continued to pat his back.
"I can inform him you are busy, sir."
"This vine.  It won't let me go," he said.  "Nice blow job, by the way."  His eyes grew wide, and then he just inhaled and shrugged.  "I've wanted your mouth on me for forever, Harry," he said, as if resigned to the admission.
"Yep."
"Harry, are you unsure of what happened, or are you just having problems putting it to words?" Remus intervened.
"Potter?" Plincher asked, stepping in front of him. "What happened here?" The Auror glanced around at the piles of debris and then the body of Kogelmann. He returned his gaze to Harry, obviously expecting some detailed report on how the room had met its end.
"I'm done."  Standing, he ignores the looks and walks out onto the deck.
"How did you find us?"
.  I'm so antsy!"  Harry wiggled in the bed to stress his point.  Remus entered the room chuckling, and then without further fuss, cancelled the stasis.
"Happy New Year," he said.
"And brilliant," Draco added with mock sincerity.
"What the hell? Harry!" Harry looked over at the door to the core and there stood Ron, panting heavily with Plincher by his side, who watched on in wonder, mixed with something that fought to either be relief or horror.
"I would suggest something flattering, maybe God Save the Queen," Harry suggested.
Draco smiled, accidentally showing some fang.  He looked away with a blush, working to retract his teeth.
Harry blushed, looking away.  Krum had been easy on the eyes, now that Harry thought back to their school days.  But it was Draco he preferred.
"Always knew you would make it."
As he prepared for the ritual, one which survival was not guaranteed, Harry mulled over his secrets and deepest desires, dwelled on his losses and cherished the happy moments: truly happy moments which were far too few for someone with such a willing heart.  But even as he tried to focus on the good things, his flight on Buckbeak, meeting Sirius for the first time, beating Malfoy at Quidditch, his first kiss with Ginny, his mind kept returning to those losses, of missed chances and dead friends.  He wished Dumbledore was here to help them.  He wished for Sirius to be standing by his side.  He wished he could only remember one loving kiss from his mother, instead of her dying screams.  None of his wishes seemed to ever come true; his wasn't a life of "happily ever after" after all.
In Pansy's austere office, they stood facing each other in silent contemplation.  He watched as her face transformed from outraged to irritated to finally resigned.  "What do you want?" she eventually asked.
.  Luna saw it as a jumping off place—to get some experience at a lesser paper before returning to
"Can you what?" Harry asked, alarmed at the pitch of his own voice.
He leaned forward, unable to stare into that well of emotion any longer and nibbled along Draco's shoulder, where collarbone met neck, and Draco moaned and arched into him, pressing his firm erection into Harry's own.
"Yes, thanks," Harry said as he piled his plate up with food.  Draco did the same.
Remus handed him a jar of pickled quail eggs, and Harry placed it on a high shelf next to other preserved bird bits.  Next was a tube of some funky paste with a little picture of a fern-like plant on the label.  Following that was a large container full of what looked like holey rocks, covered in a viscous, clear liquid.  The label read "Moriarty's Fairy Lava," and Harry stuck that next to a bucket of coal and a small packet of amethyst and jade powder.
"Malfoy is
The cat shook his head roughly, growling low, a promise of destruction.
Watching the tableau, Draco felt stupidly guilty at not having cured the man.  "When will Daddy be Daddy again?" she asked.  Tufts licked her, and she giggled.
Then with a sharp thrust of his hips, Harry caused Draco to shift to the right, their erections aligned, and then he did just what Harry had suggested, he stopped thinking.
Eyes brimming, Sirius nodded.
Months passed and the Knei Weed grew from a twig to an appreciably sized plant, Draco's concoctions failed at every turn and Harry always slept with him at night.  Every night, just as he was drifting off, Harry would wrap his arm around him and every morning, Draco would wake up with Harry half crawled on top, snoring away.  Part of him was glad he was finally sleeping, but the other part of him, the part that twitched at the contact, cursed him.
Hermione's eyes lit up. "Oh, sounds interesting," and she left through the back door calling, "Harry, Draco, I'm coming through." Soon after there was a loud crash and Harry yelled, "Draco, you okay?"
Harry stared at Draco.  "Curry shop?"
"And," Ginny began with a wry smile.  "I find it my duty to tell you," she looked sharply down at her husband, who licked at Draco's leg, "that Harry has fancied you since sixth year."
Draco's long lashes lifted as he opened his eyes.  "Severus?" he asked.  He looked down to Snape's crotch.  Snape looked down, too.  "Oh!" Draco said.
"Luna is indefatigable in the fight, Draco.  If you trust me, then trust Luna.  She is a bit batty, but you don't become the apprentice to the premier wand maker in Britain if you can't work out a problem or two."
"Oh," George said, "Follow me, then."  He did a flourishing bow, and gestured for Draco and Harry to enter the back room.
Impatiently, Harry waited in the stiff, wooden chair.  The terrible chairs of the Auror Division were one thing he definitely didn't miss.  He tapped his wand against his palm, mind combing the mental images of the other scrolls that also held a small algebraic equation in the lower, right corner of the page.
"Yes.  I am," Harry said softly, watching the emotions flutter across his friend's face, his eyes almost watery at the hope sitting there.  "I'm gunna go call Remus, he'll wanna know.  And watch out for Crookshanks."  He chuckled as he left, hearing Ron exclaim as he finally noticed the cat.
"About time, Potter," Draco spat.  The waitress had already asked him for his order three times, and he didn’t want to remain in the terribly Muggle restaurant any longer, touching Muggle things, breathing Muggle air.
Luna remembers those last moments before everything flipped arse up and Lord Voldemort took over.  She and Pansy worked together for
"Yes!  Can you imagine?  Was that…"  The whispering got too low so Draco couldn't hear the words, but something in his gut told him they had to be talking about Crazy Man Potter.
Kingsley set the file down on the desk and opened it.  He pulled out a piece of paper and slid it across the table towards Harry.
Sirius would have blown up with indignation for him, he knew.  He tried to do his best to watch out for Remus, even leaving him everything in the will.  But Remus' status as a werewolf disallowed him the honour of inheriting the Black holdings, so they went to Harry.  Harry did what he could to look after Remus too, but the last thing he wanted was to be taken care of by his inherited godson.  Remus could take care of himself.  He always had.
Fifteen of his most powerful servants stood outside of the large building buried under feet of snow. The sky was cloudy and dark, a starless abyss above, and the wind lashed across the open fields of white.
A pulse of heat and light and magic began to surge off Harry in waves.  With skin almost the same green as his terrible polyester suit, Harry looked ready to vomit over everything.  Then the magic began crawling over Draco's skin, digging into his pores, pressing into his eyeballs and with a frantic urge to conserve himself, Draco pushed hard on Harry, sending him stumbling away into a pile of peat pellets that rained down but never even touched his body, instead glancing off the tangible aura around him.
"This it?" he asked as he held out the comic, rubbing his itchy nose.  Draco nodded and reverently took it from him, setting it on the table and then gently turning the pages one at a time.
"Oh, so you do know of his immortality."  Harry doesn't seem surprised.  "Yes, I am…"  Then suddenly, Harry faces Draco again.  "But we've got something planned.  All the others are destroyed…. And mine…" he touches the leather, "well, let's just say that with Hermione on our side, we've figured it all out.  My Soul Patch,” he taps the eye patch, “keeps the power of the soul in check.  It sucks the energy from it, constantly gaining intensity as Voldemort's soul feeds it.  All that's left now is a small shard in my eye, a weak thing.  If we put Voldemort and the patch in contact, it'll activate, smothering both souls."
"Well, what will you do?"
Harry had to sit between Hermione and her annoying left hand, and McGonagall, who seemed to be the only two…three people he didn't cause to sneeze.  As he sat, adjusting his tail to slip through the ribs of the chair, Harry sneezed, apparently trying to make up for the lack from Hermione and McGonagall, Hogwarts' plaid wonder. Ginny waved a hanky at him from across the room.  Harry dismissed it with a shake of his head and forced smile.
Malfoy had his back turned, facing the corner.
The End
"Might have to get you a bowl," Draco said with a warm smile.  Something about Potter as a cat made him less intimidating, less of some unattainable level to live up to and be compared with.  Tufts pulled his muzzle out of the cup—it tilted dangerously to the side—and licked at his lips, eyes trained on Draco.
to ask.  He'd intended to say something distracting, something miles away from things like 'hair' and 'lips' and especially
"Oh, nonsense, my dear.  And please, call me Narcissa."
"Well, I will be the first to admit, I'm impressed."  Draco turned away and Banished the evidence of the bouquet's existence.  Even the faint scent of roses was gone.
The potion had been delivered, under the guise of a magically-enhancing tincture to make the Dark Lord even more powerful.  Severus knew how to play to the man's weaknesses and desires.  Now, all they had to do was wait.  Wait for the potion to subtly work its way into the Dark Lord's system and cut off his magic from that intimately corrupted soul, slowly causing that soul to disintegrate.  To be no more.  All they had to do was wait until that potion destroyed the shards of the Dark Lord, those residing within the Horcruxes, those residing within them, taking them along for the ride.  All they could do was wait for their final breaths to exhaust away.
He hoped Harry didn't file him away as a hopeless romantic.  To Draco himself, he hadn't been aware of these hidden depths, how much his heart could hold.
Harry stalled his odd march and looked up at Draco.  His face was pale and he nibbled his lip.  Draco's heart twitched.  "Well?" Draco asked.
Soon, Severus emerged from the washroom fully dressed.  It was a marvel that in such humid weather he could still look fresh and comfortable.
His throat.  His throat was on fire.
"Listen, Malfoy," Teddy burst in.  He couldn't take it anymore.  It wasn't Harry's fault.  "If you don't want him, just send him to me.  I'll watch out for him.  I've got nowhere to take him, and I can't cure him, but I'll fucking treat him with more dignity and kindness than you ever could."  He'd known The Dissident was a rebel, was a loner, but now he really understood why.  Nobody could ever be as good as Draco Pure-Blood Malfoy.  Nobody could ever touch him, be worthy, offer him aid or request it.  The man was as full of himself as a runway model, and Teddy was sick of his narcissism and over
There was something right about killing the man who cursed him with a blade, without magic. He didn't deserve magic.
He walked around the apartment, sticking his head into each room, not wanting to be too obtrusive without her permission. "You here?"
"Malfoy!"  A harsh whisper.  "What are you doing here?"
He held himself stiff, his shoulders drawn back and chin lifted, a stance of a prince, proud and not at all his usual pose of simmering resentment.  His eyes ran over the mushrooms in her hand, large specimens with spots and he had to swallow to keep a smile from his face.  As his eyes met Ida's, he simply nodded, and the woman's answering grin was so brilliant, he almost flinched at causing someone so much joy.
His wand held firm.
"Heh. Weakling wizards." The laughter and slurred words were casually tossed at the men as a walking corpse once known as Scrimgeour stumbled towards the artefact. Harry spared him a glance and icy horror swept over him at the monster the Minister had become.
birthday. The day he took the Mark.
"I'm sorry," Harry offered, though he knew it was weak and did nothing to help their situation. In all honesty, his frustration rivaled Ron's. This was his team. The team he had put together, with Ron's help, and the roster had only shifted slightly since Ron became the head. They were his buddies as well, and the idea of being betrayed by them left him feeling helpless and empty.
Swallow.
He stared at the blossom.  It was more pink than purple and the blue was so deep it looked black.  There were five petals, a magical number, and in the middle were five stamens with their anthers perched on the ends and the swollen pistil in the centre.
"Harry!" Teddy jumped to his feet and pulled Harry down from the chair.  Everyone in the restaurant was watching them with suspicious interest.  The waitress took a tentative step towards them, but Teddy waved her off as he hustled Harry towards the street.  Luna and Neville were right behind them.
Soon kissing became his favorite thing to do.
"What is it?" Harry asked.
"I'll make some coffee."
"You probably want to freshen up a bit," she says, then gestures for him to follow her and leaves the interrogation cave.
"When you fled with Snape—"
"Well, ready?" Harry asked, a little more subdued. His face looked red to Draco, perhaps due to too much time spent in the sun, but he was sure Harry hadn't seemed that pink just a few moments ago.
"But…."  These people consider themselves soldiers in a war, how could they just get drunk out here on the open sea?  "What if somebody attacks them during the night?"
"So, that wasn't the key?" Harry said, still staring at the man. Remus was the only one who watched the little ball roll away until it finally came to a halt, smiley face partially visible at the angle it came to rest. With concern, he looked down at his hand as a tingling seemed to smolder along his skin, but when it slowly faded away, he pushed it from his mind.
With each article of clothing discarded to the floor, Severus' eyes grew darker and darker; his lips parted and the rise and fall of his chest sped up.  Slowly, his hand slipped past his waistband and when Harry dropped his pants, Severus' eyes jerked towards Harry's raging erection.
He looked over at his shoulder, certain he would see something terrible and disgusting but saw nothing but the same raw flesh, only a little redder than before.  Harry cringed at this newly discovered temperature sensitivity of the wound.  Add that to his list of new annoyances.
Casting a lubrication spell, Draco coated his fingers and Lily's hole, taking his time as he massaged the tight circle of muscles even more than his tongue had.
"Why don't you use any spells?" Harry asked, trying to add steel to his voice, but it cracked nonetheless.
"Ah Remus, I never knew you and Sirius…" Harry half joked with him, but stumbled over his words as soon as he noticed someone approaching the shrine. A short Mexican man walked up to the bubbling basin, crossed himself and took the little box. The exchange was performed before two undercover wizards not on Ron's Auror team. The repercussions were obvious.
Draco didn't know how, but his father recognised him, even through the Polyjuiced disguise.  It wasn't a problem with the potion, Draco was an expert at such trivial things, it was something else that went beyond appearance and the mental arts; it had to do with blood.
is all history, you know.  My eye, the patch, pirates, you being on the ship.  This war."
"I think you need to do exactly as I said," Draco said with all the bravado he could muster.  He struggled to right himself, gain his feet, but Schooner brought his heel down sharply on Draco's collar bone and he fell prone onto his back, completely vulnerable.
"What do you want, Lovegood?" Pansy asked, all of the annoyance she could muster flavoured her question.
"Oh Merlin, thank you Kingsley."  Harry let out a breath, relieved to have Kingsley on one side of him and Ron on the other like a protective vanguard.
Harry's words came as no surprise but Draco's eyes still sparkled at their implication.
"What the fuck?" Draco screamed, hoping that a sudden spark of inspiration would tell him what needed to be done, what exactly was going on with Harry.
Slowly, he rose to his feet, rubbing at his back where he knew a bruise would be developing in no time.  He spelled the water colder, much colder, and stepped in again.  Goosebumps flared up all over his skin, but his shoulder didn't protest, and slowly he increased the heat to make every part of his body happy.
"He's never been in Animagus form this long," she explained and Draco nodded.  He understood.  When wizards or witches were in the form of their animal shape for too long, their minds and actions began to show more and more of the animal's natural tendencies.
So, behind Lord Voldemort's lines, wrapped tight in his father's iron fist, Draco finally started to view the world with his own set of scales and realised not only were they deficient on common sense, but also sanity.  The purebloods, feeling abandoned by the wizarding world, were blindly following this half-blood, insane megalomaniac to their own destruction.
"My art.  My empire of precious things."
Snape said, though he had little animosity to his tone, which Harry found unexpected.  Snape had been gliding over the littered earth towards Harry's feet again.  Harry began to wonder if his old professor didn't have a foot fetish.
Draco, seeing that the Gryffindor was heading into a long stream of babbled truths, stepped in to redirect the conversation. The last thing he wanted was a recap of his betrayed privacy to this stranger. Though oddly enough, he didn't feel too indignant about it.
Finally, his worn body went limp, soft pants rippling through his chest, and as the seconds ticked past slow realization hit him.  Draco no longer sucked at his neck, and he'd just come all over his friend's hand.
Harry couldn't meet his eyes.  Draco began plucking at a finger nail.
At this, Draco almost trips on the pavement where they are walking along the waterfront, but covers his surprise by leaning over and picking up a ball of paper to toss into a trash can.  Harry watches him and that grin goes up three notches when he sees what Draco has done.
Public?  It seemed they were the only two people in existence in this tucked-away world.  "Public?" Harry repeated aloud with a snort.  "Who is going to see you, but me?"
"Fine," Harry said with mock annoyance and left for the backroom again. Draco looked around at the crowd and shrugged. Remus laughed, it was all so very normal.
"Draco?" Harry asked, questioning as he ran his fingers in a figure eight over his soft skin, coating them with the oil.  He drew the eight wider and wide, encompassing each half of his arse.  "This okay?"
