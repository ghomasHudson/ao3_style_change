"If you knew why didn't you tell us?" Snape asked, his voice was even, but it was obvious by the way that he was shaking that he was more than a little upset.
“Narcissa,” the woman gently corrected and Neville flushed, no doubt uncomfortable with such informalities, if his unease in using Severus’ given name was any indication.
“You’re going to have to elaborate, love.” Draco signed and propped himself up with the arm that was not steadily pulling Harry closer. “I’m worried too, about a lot of things, but what’s keep you up now?”
“When you say vaults, you mean Gringotts?” Ginny asked, clearly knowing the answer but wishing she were wrong.
"You know he didn't mean that, right?" Draco whispered and looked to his godfather before focusing on his boyfriend again. Harry sighed, pulling the blond into his arms for a quick, tight hug.
“No, but I don’t get it, he said it was just a dream.” Draco did his best to keep the panic from his voice, but from the looks his friends gave him he was doing a terrible job.
"Be careful, Harry Potter." He felt her shift and her hand was in his robe pocket. She pulled back just as fast and when Harry whipped around, she was gone. Carefully he fished into his pocket only to pull out a parchment. Confused, he flipped it over twice before giving up and putting it back into his pocket. There was nothing on it as far as he could tell, but the hallway wasn't the place to look for secret meanings on a suspicious parchment.
"It's getting late, love. We ought to head back." As much as Harry wanted to just sit there and talk more with the younger girl, he knew that they'd better head back or they would fall asleep there and that would be interesting to have to explain in the morning, especially to Ron who still wasn't all that happy with him.
“Why will I need to keep my strength up?” He put his plate down and swallowed the last bite still in his mouth. Draco and Hermione would have been horrified at his manners.
Something was terribly wrong and Severus knew that Nott openly goading him like that shouldn't have caused such a reaction in him, but he had been on edge since the start of term. Despite his best efforts, the Dark Lord was starting to doubt him and with how long he'd been under cover Severus could not bare to have his cover blown now. He would have to talk to Albus about this knew piece of information before McGonnagal returned. It wasn't that he didn't trust the woman, it was quite the contrary actually. He really wished that he could talk to her, she had always been like a mother figure for him especially since his own mother died when he was so young, but Albus had been very adamant that no one could know the true extent of his sacrifices for the Light. The fewer people who knew the fewer people who could get tortured and accidentally give him away. With a great, weighted sigh, Severus pushed open the door to Albus' office, not bothering to knock.
"Honestly? Not sure, I sort of just did." Harry shrug and Snape snorted.
“We don’t care, we want a name.” Fred poked him harder and the slimy man shrunk away from him and his wand.
"To London, there is something I need to take care of and I need your help." Harry pocketed the letter without another word. "Dress warmly, we're leaving in an hour."
Conversation shifted to quidditch from there and then again to various classes and whatever other random topics that came to mind. Ron and Hermione joined them not long after Harry arrived and the Gryffindors and two Slytherins enjoyed a cheerful breakfast before their first period class, sixth year double Defense with Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.
"No, he's doing something for Dumbledore, I think, but he did come by with a message." Hermione pulled a folded piece of parchment from her pocket and handed it to Harry. "He said it was important and that you should read it as soon as you got back."
"Do you?" Harry asked. They where coming up to the hall where their rooms where, so Harry stopped them, pulling Draco to the side, into his arms.
"Of course you were! Always with the reasons and the fancy words. What's to say you're not really Dumbledore's man? How are we to know that you aren't feeding everything we say here to the old coot!" The room suddenly to roar to life. Everyone had something to say and from what he could hear, it was all against him.
"Was facing Voldemort scary?" One of the younger Gryffindors, a third year asked timidly and Harry couldn't help, but smile.
“Not now, Harry’s upset and he asked for Hermione and Sev.” All eyes of the core traveled to the Head Table. Severus was noticeably not in attendance. “Where is everyone today?”
The small group of students under Severus' watchful gaze moved wearily to pick up the ingredients, all too used to the potion master's sharp tongue. They made quick work of preparing their ingredients with little noise, the shouts and laughter from the other side of the room was a stark contrast.
“A dream, just a nightmare.” Harry knew that he was saying it for his own benefit, not Draco’s. If he could convince himself that it was only a dream then maybe it would be true. Though that had never been the case in the past. “Get Hermione for me, please. And Severus.”
“Don’t you think that would have been something useful to share?” Harry did his best to remain outwardly calm, but he knew that the old man would see right through him. He would know just how mad he was making him, but Harry couldn’t help it. Dumbledore was once again withholding information and it was going to get them both killed. He had remarkable control over his magic and his emotions, but he was only sixteen and everyone had a breaking point.
Hermione and Neville stood above them, their faces tight with worry.
"Are you really telling
unharmed. Harry didn't put it past the people searching his house to destroy the place. The problem with the auror department since the end of the war was that many of those with actual experience had retired. Many of those still in the field were young and held grudges against anyone connected to the death eaters even if they had been cleared by Harry Potter himself as Draco had been very publicly right after the war. Harry knew that the men meant well, but they still didn't have the field experience to understand that not everyone who had ties to the dark arts was necessarily a threat, nor did they deserve the way many of the young aurors, Ron included, treated them.
“How is she really doing, did you find anything troubling in your diagnostics?”
The sun shown down on the grounds of Hogwarts bathing it in a warmth which didn't seem to reach its occupants. The war was raging on with no end in sight. There didn't seem to be much reason for good cheer, which left sixteen year old Harry Potter sitting alone by the lake pondering his life and what was expected of him in the coming months.
"Master?" Harry asked amused.
“Well that’s the match, let’s hear it for Draco and Ginny.” It was as if Harry had lifted a spell off of the room. Suddenly they where all clapping and cheering. Dean lifted the sticking charm keeping Harry in place and the boy, along with Blaise, walked down to the platform to check on their respective partners. Draco and Ginny where sitting on the edge of the platform, the Gryffindor leaning on the Slytherin’s shoulder. Hermione and Ron joined them moments later.
Severus swore under his breath and Draco looked equally relieved and annoyed.
“I love you so much.” Harry managed through shaky breaths. While he was sure he didn’t say it in quite the way he meant to, Draco understood all the same.
"I'm fine, just thinking." Draco said shakily, though he didn't miss the look that Blaise and Harry shared over his head.
“Yes.”
With a curt nod, Harry turned to face the house once more. Had he not been able to sense the dense, dark magic surrounding it, he thought it would hardly seem foreboding. It was a small, brick building with a thatched roof that stood a short, single story. The front garden had obviously been neglected for years, possibly for the past decade or more, and the fence that surrounded it was surely only still standing by assistance of magic.
"We finished all of ours yesterday." Harry cut in and Hermione looked at him with pride in her eyes while Ron seemed to look at his best friend as if he had never seen him before. "What? I barely had any to do anyways, I finished the potions essay the day after he assigned it."
. So with that settled that just meant one thing, Harry had to be his soul mate. And maybe that was why he felt so connected to the messy haired, bespectacled boy. Maybe, just maybe that was why, if he concentrated very hard, he could almost
"No, not quite." Harry grinned back. "As much as I would love you to convince me more, it's nearing two in the morning. That and if you do all your convincing now, what fun are we going to have later?"
“That’s what we built the Junior Order and core for.” Harry said, ending the conversation with a quick look. They found the others and filled them in on their plan before sending a quick patronus to the twins.
"Of course, I need my most trusted man working the school for me. It is getting late and I wish to retire for the night. Make sure you keep me updated."
“Do you even know how dangerous that is?” Blaise asked, though he looked less mad and more impressed.
"Honestly, love, you're not really that oblivious I hope." Ginny rolled her eyes. "He didn't move, didn't stop you, not once and I could almost see the tension between the both of you all day. Obviously he wants you."
"Can we just stay a bit more, I want to check on Ginny?" Harry asked from the bed, Draco was already sitting in his lap, Ron and Hermione mirroring them from the other side of the bed, and Blaise was sitting by Ginny's feet, his hand holding hers.
Dumbledore didn’t respond and instead reached out to touch the nearest chest. It opened with a soft hiss and a click. Sure enough there was a single phial with a clear liquid nestled in the center of the chest. He took the phial with his bad hand and uncorked it before drinking it down. Harry watched him carefully it seemed the effects were already taking hold as Dumbledore fell to the ground, moaning in pain.
"I still say that you should have held your tongue. If Snape finds out what we're doing before we've gotten control of the school this will all go under and
“Is there anything else you noticed?” Draco asked. He looked worried still, but less so at Neville’s mostly positive diagnoses.
“Well we’re building a house, but no one has given anything thought to the furniture. We have a general blueprint, but nothing more than words on parchment. If this is going to be the home for the core Order, our home, then we’re going to need to outfit it.”
Before Vipera could react, Jaculus turned and slid up the trail until he was sitting in the perfect spot for Harry to open the door. With a silent flick of his wand the door began to unlock and a pained hiss filled the cavern.
The hallway with Mrs. Black's painting and the heads of the house elves had proved to be the easiest to deal with which had surprised Harry greatly. After the war, Mrs. Black had given up the war against the ears of the members of her house. As if she sensed the defeat of Voldemort, she left her portrait, breaking the magic that had bound it to the wall. When Harry had entered his home again for the first time after the end of the war he had found the massive, empty portrait fallen to the ground leaving a lot of damage to the floor and wall. The heads were even easier to move. Kreacher insisted that they be displayed in the house elf quarters and Harry quickly agreed. It not only made his rather grouchy house elf happy, Hermione also accepted the idea without a fight.

"No, too much on my mind." The silence in the room was thick, threatening to overwhelm them. Harry didn't know if he should question further. He didn't know if he wanted to. Sure the war was over and Malfoy was certainly not his enemy any more, Harry had let him into his own home after all, but they weren't exactly friendly either. It just seemed in his nature to help people and when Draco had been at his doorstep earlier that morning, Harry hadn't thought twice about letting him into his home. Just before Harry was able to breach the uncomfortable silence, Draco had a plate of pancakes levitating to him. "Butter or jam?"
"And Salazar, you two are menaces together." Blaise rolled his eyes and the portrait laughed.
“Maybe we should all have some of our things in there, like a change of clothes, just in case,” Dean suggested.
"Good night, Harry." Draco smiled, snuggling closer to him.
"I'm not sure, it hurt at first, but then I just focused and made it stop." Before Harry could press for more information, Snape came bounding into the room.
When the shield charm slowly began to fade, Astoria took the first move, shouting a rather nasty jinx in Ginny's direction and Draco had only a moment to spare to make sure that she could hold her own before having to turn and cast his own shield in response to Nott's slightly less powerful jinx. The two boys carried in the same fashion for what seemed like hours. Nott kept up his string of less than stellar hexes while Draco bided his time, waiting for the perfect opening to strike. If the shouts he was hearing from behind were any indication then Ginny was more than holding her own and might even have the upper hand, though the blond had no time to turn and check. Finally when Nott seemed to be worn down enough to slow, leaving gaps in his defense, Draco took the only opportunity he was likely to get.
"Our advantage?"
Draco met Harry’s eyes over Ginny’s head. “Sounds like a good plan to me.”
Draco knew the aurors wouldn't find anything, though he also knew that they would do their best to destroy as much of his property as possible in the process. With a great, dramatic sigh, Draco stood and left his room, wandering around the grand home again. He wanted to do something for Harry to thank him, he was never really good with words and even less so with affectionate actions, but something about Harry and his kindness made Draco want to at least try.
"Of course. I was in the library earlier, doing a bit of extra reading in the Defense section, when I came across something, rather interesting. I was looking in an old tome, I forget the name of it, and I came across a strange term. Something called a horcrux." Harry started to make his way closer to the desk. When he got to the last word, he was leaning with his palms on the desk. He was at eye level with the man, thoroughly enjoying watching him pale and twitch. He really ought to have been put in Slytherin, Draco would be so proud.
“She will if you alert Severus first, he should meet us at the tower.” Harry nodded, though he was sure the dying wizard did not see it. He sent a quick patronus to Severus and then a second to Draco. He had to hope that Draco would inform the rest.
"Zabini could move in with you, if he wanted." Harry tried again. He didn't want to have this conversation with someone else there, especially since his and Draco's friendship was still so frail and his own two friends had just abandoned him, but Draco seemed to trust Zabini, so he continued to speak as if the other boy was not there.
"Severus my boy! What seems to be the matter? Oh and Harry too, I hope you two haven't gone and gotten into a fight again." Dumbledore greeted them jovially, making Harry grit his teeth and Snape want to slap the man.
"I'm not sure I would put it in those words exactly." Harry brought his water glass to his lips, he was already feeling parched under Ginny's intense gaze.
"I didn't know you got Transfiguration Monthly Harry, I thought only professionals in the field could subscribe." Hermione pestered. They were walking side-by-side behind the rest of the group.
"Where have you been mate? We were starting to worry." Ron greeted them and Harry instantly felt guilty. In his mad dash out of the castle, he had really only told Draco where he was going, while the others just had to guess.
"Fine." Snape ground his teeth and Draco almost felt bad for his godfather, but he was enjoying himself too much to help him. Neville stood from his chair and with some rearranging, was able to sit on the couch. Seamus moved to the couch arm and Hermione sat on Ron's lap. When everyone was situated and Draco called for tea, because really he was a Malfoy and it was against every fiber of his being to not serve something to guests, Snape began to speak.
He was pulled out of his thoughts when Harry walked through the door covered in dust looking rather pleased with himself.
"I think we have our way in." All eyes feel on Draco as a smirk crossed the blond's face. "You just have to ask him why he's writing about dark objects and nearly revering them under a pen name."
The rest of the day was spent with the three of them spending time together. Draco's things were delivered and they moved him in as well as moving Hermione in with things that Ginny helped fetch for her from her apartment that she’d shared with Ron. Neville hadn't come back until late that night. He had turned Ron in and then gone straight to work on the necessary legal documents to keep them safe. He had been surprised to see the vow that Harry had taken sitting on his desk already. Normally things like that took longer to process, but Kingsley's unmistakable seal shone brightly on the parchment and Neville was glad because that meant one less thing he needed to do. By the time the sun set that night everyone was tired and dinner was a short affair of sandwiches and pumpkin juice before everyone retired for the night.
“I assume you are here about the book,” the hunched old man said, as if this was a normal way of greeting strangers. He looked frail, his thinning white hair only covered small patches of his otherwise bald head. His robes were tattered and looked as if they’d been washed a few too many times.
When the quaffle shot up in the air Ginny dashed after it. Immediately the chasers fell into formation and one of the easier plays began. Harry took his time to scan the crowd, his eyes jumping from member of his team then to the people in the stands. It was too early in the match to consider finding the snitch, it wasn't anywhere to be seen, and his team's safety was always his top priority.
"Please stop watching me. I'm not going to run away." Draco spoke with a harsher edge to his voice than he had meant. He instantly felt guilty when he looked up and saw the hurt clear on Harry's face. "Sorry."
"First I need you to understand that what we are doing is against Dumbledore's orders. Furthermore, it is imperative that only we know about it. There is going to be a point where I am going to have to obliviate you, I know that this is something very serious that I am asking you so I need you to understand exactly what you are getting yourself in to."
He squeezed Draco's hands and watched as Draco processed what he said.
Severus patiently listened to her. "I am glad to know you have more confidence and trust in my godson's abilities than Weasley's. That is quite understandable that you needed time to heal. I assume you did find your parents and were successful in restoring their memories. Hermione, I believe you are too good for someone like Weasley and I am pleased to know you were able to gently free yourself from that relationship. No one really got their feelings hurt. And you two were able to stay friends. That is the best possible outcome." He gave her a sweet smile.
Draco softly chuckled and pulled Harry into a hug and whispered into his ear. "I am certainly comfortable with repeating what we did before." He felt Harry shiver into the hug.
Fondly,
The salesperson chuckled softly. “I think I have the perfect collection that includes those things you said. Just give me a moment while I collect the items.” She walked away.
Lucius sneered at his son and started to rage. “You, perverted deviant! You are no son of mine! I can not even look at you! I am ashamed to know you are of my blood! Get away from me!” He yelled and the guard was about to come for him but Harry held his hand up and the guard stayed put. Draco had tears going down his cheeks due to his father’s words and Harry wiped the tears away.
Potter looked at both Malfoys. "Actually I did think of that Malfoy. Believe it or not. I know what you think of my intelligence. I talked to Hermione about that little fact of allegiance and she found a way to counteract what happened. She found a potion that you have pour onto the wand. It made the wand revert back to its original owner status. It was quite brilliant." He smiled thinking about how Hermione found a way to rectify what he did.
Harry sighed sadly. “I’m so lucky to have you all here. I couldn’t ask for a better crowd of friends. Who would’ve thought I’d be exchanging a Gryffindor for two Slytherins. The sorting hat was right. Slytherin is where you make your real friends. All because of Draco’s behaviour and what Hagrid said to me about Slytherin I basically begged the sorting hat not to put me in Slytherin. In these moments I regret that I was so close-minded about the house of the snake. But at the same time I wouldn’t trade my friendship with Hermione for anything. I don’t think we would’ve been as close if I had been placed into Slytherin. No offence.” He chuckled and smiled at Hermione.
Hermione looked at Harry sadly. "Why does Ron always leave when things get to be too much for him? Wehave been friends since first year. I would have thought he would grow up by now or at the very least accept what either of us do."
Harry held his boyfriend. “Dray? Love, please look at me.” He pleaded as pulled away and wiped the tears from Draco’s cheeks.
Draco stared angrily at Harry. “So what did my mother want?”
Draco looked at his mother. "Is everything okay? Did something happen?" He looked a bit worried.
Hermione squealed with delight. "Oh my Merlin! It is about time you two decided to just be happy and forget what others will think you of together. I am incredibly happy for you both!" She was smiling ear to ear.
A couple of hours later, Potter's owl flew through his bedroom window once again. Draco opened the new letter. A simple phrase of "see you tomorrow" was all it said. He shook his hand and smirked. Once he gave a treat to the owl, she flew off.
Harry blushed lightly. “Believe it or not, I do. I’m going to have Kreacher make Draco’s favourite meal and dessert tonight. I’ll propose after dessert. Does that sound okay?”
When Harry and Draco righted themselves and saw that Severus was there smirking. “Well, Potter still clumsy as ever I see.” Something caught his eye. “I suppose congratulations are in order.” Eyeing the rings on their left hands.
Severus shook his head. “Thank you for letting me know that you owled Molly. Please keep me updated on whether Ron is still among the living or not after she gets her way with him. Anyway, I best be off.” He turned back to Hermione and gave a brief kiss before disappearing into the floo.
Blaise chuckled a bit. “I think that is as good as it will get for you, Potter. I am sure once she gets her head out of her arse and actually gets to know you she will like you. I mean Draco loves you so you can not be all bad now, can you?” He genuinely smiled at Harry.
Severus gently kissed her and pulled back slightly. “Hermione, you deserve the world and more. Ron is a wanker for not seeing you for who you truly are. Though, what is his loss is my gain so I can not complain.” He chuckled a bit.
Hermione smirked. "Good morning you two. As much as I wished that I was not privy to this display of affection, I am happy for you both. Draco, why are you at Harry's? Not that it is not nice to see you again. And Harry, I am sorry to interrupt your morning but I wanted to see how you were doing."
Hermione had tears in her eyes. "Severus, I am sorry you lost Lily twice. Her friendship and her death. It must have been devastating. I can not imagine what you went through and still are going through. Honestly, I do not know what I would do if something were to happen to Harry. He is my best friend and I am just happy to know he is still alive after fighting Voldemort. Thank you for talking to me and sharing. I appreciate it." She smiled softly.
Harry hugged her back. “I actually wanted to talk to Ron. Is he here? There’s something I want to run by him.”
Minnie had heard enough. "Severus, there is no need to be so beastly towards your godson and former students. Though, you do bring up an excellent point." She looked at him sternly. He nodded and finally stopped sneering at Harry, Draco and Hermione. "Your old posts as Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts professor are still open if you are interested in rejoining Hogwarts. It is up to you." She said desperately trying to change the subject.
Draco had tears in his eyes. "Harry, you really mean that? You want to be mine? And you would rather not wait? I enjoy kissing you too. Nothing would make me happier than to be yours. Severus said that I should not have to hide my feelings for you. He was right. We should not have to hide anymore. I want everyone to know that you are with me." He squeezed Harry's hand and brought it to his lips and kissed his hand. He blushed a little bit.
Narcissa watched both boys bantering back and forth. "I am sure Harry thought of that little fact, Draco darling."
Hermione got the hint, he didn't want to talk about Lily, being called a hero or the war any longer. "Well, I have been researching about your resurrection and what the process was to produce the doe figurine. I found some material on the subject and thought I would share my findings with you. Unfortunately in the excitement of wanting to tell you, I did not realise where I would end up landing in the Manor. I am still embarrassed."
"Bye Draco." Harry said as he apparated away.
Harry could not take the tension any longer as he surged forward and kissed Draco passionately. Within seconds Draco responded with just as much passion. Both needed each other more than air itself. They explored each other’s bodies and moaned in pleasure. After stripping each other, Harry pushed Draco down and straddled him. He started to rut against Draco until they were moaning each other’s names.
When Draco and Severus arrived back at Malfoy Manor after flooing into Hogsmeade and apparating to the manor's gate, Severus looked at Draco. "Well, I am pleased to be among the living as Minnie put it. I can finally live a life I had dreamed of." He smiled. "And though I am astonished that you and the Boy Who Lived Twice are together, I am happy for you, Draco." He hugged his godson.
Winky finally ceased the jumping and said "Master Draco, it's quite late and you should be getting ready. You slept in. I'll make you your favourite breakfast."
Draco looked stunned. “Harry, really? She gave her blessing? Though I am not surprised in the least. She is quite fond of you. I would be honoured to take your last name. Oh Merlin! The Prophet would go mad with the news of their Saviour taking the Malfoy name. And my mother has spoken quite a lot about you over the years. Though, in the more recent years, she has nothing but lovely things to say and she can be quite tender. I am happy she thinks of you as a son. I know how rough your childhood was. You can not have too many mothers especially if they are like Molly and my mother.” He smiled sweetly at Harry.
Harry looked at her. “I’m not sure your reaction was why he broke down. Lucius said some pretty beastly things to both of us. I do agree with you, Narcissa. I didn’t think it was the best idea to visit either but I supported Dray’s decision to confront his father and I didn’t want him to be alone when he did.” He gave her a sad smile.
Draco went to Harry and took him by the hand. He lead them to a sofa where he held Harry close as he cried softly. Draco gently rubbed his back and whispered sweet nothings into his ear, to help calm him. They silently sat there for what seemed like hours.
Hermione laughed lightly. “Way to ruin the lovely, romantic moment, you soppy git!” She teased. “I quite like the softer side of prickly Professor Severus Snape.” She smirked.
Draco turned around and scooted as close to Harry as humanly possible. Once he was settled, Harry wrapped one arm around him and caressed Draco’s stomach gently. “I never thought I would be this happy. I thought I was destined to remain cursed with my father’s legacy. You make my once black and white world transform into a brilliant spectrum of colours. I love you with all my heart, Harry.” He placed a hand on Harry’s and squeezed it.
Hermione smiled at Ron. “Oh Ron! I am happy to see that you got your stubborn head out of your arse finally.” All three laughed. “So where do you want to start shopping? Muggle or wizarding shops?”
Hermione playfully smacked him and laughed. "Very true. You two are quite the pair. I hope he comes to his senses. Losing your friendship all because of his opinion on the Malfoy family is pretty idiotic. I will talk to Molly and hopefully he will get an ear full from her and starts to see the errors of his ways. Either way, I think you will get support from most of the Weasley family. Knowing George and Ginny, they will have a running bet on how long it will take you and Draco to get together officially after hearing about your friendship."
Harry slowly pushed himself inside of Draco until he bottomed out. Both needed a moment to catch their breaths before continuing. Draco nodded and Harry pulled out and pushed in a bit faster. Once Draco was acclimated to Harry’s size completely, Harry started to stroke Draco’s erection again. Draco begged him to go faster and so he did. Both were chanting each other’s names.
Hermione pulled back. “Sev, I do not see how anyone would not fall in love with you once they got to know you. You may be one of the most prickly people I know but behind all your armour is a brilliant soul. You deserve all the happiness and love in the world and I am beyond delighted that I am the one who has the chance to love you. I am quite pleased that Dumbledore had enough sense to save you. No one deserves another chance more than you, Sev.” She smiled softly at him and continued. “After Ron I did not think I would find love again, not to mention I was not entirely ready either, but that all changed once I saw you materialise at Hogwarts. I just felt it in my bones that we were destined for one another.” She smiled shyly at him.
Draco finally spoke. "The Latin incantation "semper fidelis. Te mihi revelare" roughly translates to "always loyal or faithful. Reveal yourself to me" in English. Dumbledore said to say those words carefully which makes me think you only get one try." He looked a little worried.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and leaned forward until their noses touched. He tentatively began to kiss Harry. Slowly their kiss grew passionate as they were moaning and explored each other. As breathing became an issue, they pulled back panting. Both looked at one another with love in their eyes. Draco nuzzled Harry’s neck and sighed contentedly.
Draco nodded. "Let us get this over with. I hope you know what you are doing."
Harry pulled away. “I love you too Draco.” He leaned towards the bedside table to get his wand and that is when Draco stopped him. Harry looked at him confused.
Harry yawned and Narcissa noticed. “It has been a tiring day. You should head home, Harry darling. We could all use a good rest.”
Severus blushed and looked so embarrassed. "I do not realise that Harry did that for me. Thank you for letting me know. Um, I forgot to ask, what brought you to the manor?"
Draco turned around to face Harry. "Good morning, Harry." He smiled.
Sirius spoke up. “Snape. I mean Severus.” He looked at the floor. “Umm, I understand your ire but I do not think you should attack Narcissa for what she did. She wanted to help Harry and show him how much she loves him. I believe this was her way of telling him, bringing us all back for him.”
Hermione was still kind of staring at Severus. And he looked at her curiously which caused her to blush ferociously once again. She looked away from him and tried to concentrate on Harry and Draco. If anyone had noticed the exchange, no one said anything about it.
After a moment, Harry pushed Draco to sit on the sofa. He pushed him down until Draco was laying down. He laid on top of him and kissed him lovingly. They eventually stopped kissing and smiled at each other. Harry laid his head on Draco’s chest. He listened to his heartbeat and cuddled even closer. Draco wrapped one arm around Harry’s torso while the other softly caressed his face and played with his hair. Both had never been this content before. At peace in their happy silence.
"For the love of— Ron, get him to bed before he hurts himself." She was about to turn away when she hesitated. "Harry, just, please try to actually get some sleep tonight. I'll bring you some Hangover Cure in the morning."
Draco smirked. "You are anything but normal."
Harry must have drank more than he thought, because he'd reached the giggly stage of drunkenness; the point where everyone and everything is utterly hilarious. He tittered at Ron, looking at him fondly. "'Kay, Ronny."
"God, Ron, when'd you get so sentimental?" Harry grumbled, going back to his breakfast.
Harry shrugged. “Six? Maybe seven?”
Draco easily caught up to Harry (curse his long legs yet again). "Why would it? You're Harry Bloody Potter."
"You can't take that from the shelf."
"I'm just saying," The subject's eyes smiled behind his half-moon spectacles, "I only ever see you in between the hours of ten and three. When do you sleep?"
Harry tried to smile at Ron, but it came out more as a grimace than anything else. His mind was still stuck on how the air seemed to still between him and Malfoy, the way his robes whipped in the draft of the train station, the weight of the magic that surrounded him. He couldn't decide whether it was horrid or intoxicating.
Harry nodded, walking behind him down the narrow staircase. “Good afternoon. Have you gotten settled?”
in the pit of his stomach-- maybe everything would be alright. At least until holiday break. And besides, Draco had a responsibility here. He owed it to his family and to the Black name to make sure the house was cared for; he may not have been the heir of the home, but from recent events, it was obvious the true heir needed some guidance, whether he would admit it or not.
Malfoy's voice was low, low enough for only Harry to hear it. They smirked at each other as they slapped palms, fingers wrapping around each other's hands easier than ever before. Harry shook his with great vigor. "How could I forget?"
Harry’s mumbling had almost been drowned out by the bubbling and simmering of the chicken and red wine. Draco considered him for a moment before saying, “Who took care of you for all those years? Before you came to Hogwarts?”
He then realised he hadn't listened to the second half of what Pansy said. "Sorry?" He half-said-half-shouted over the loud music.
Draco quickly downed the rest of his tea, leaving his now empty cup on the coffee table in front of Potter. "Thank you again for the tea."
Harry smirked at the way Malfoy spit it out. "And he knows that Harry Bloody Potter has a good judge of character."
They spent most of the tour in the library. Kreacher rambled on about the Black’s value of knowledge and how Great Uncle Black had been quite the bookworm. The shelves that lined the large room went up all the way to the ceiling, and there was even a pair of sliding ladders attached to the shelves, their silver hardware shining proudly amidst the dark mahogany shelves. Draco’s slender hands grazed spine after spine, almost tenderly. “I bet Granger had a field day in here…”
After ten minutes or so, Harry began actively looking for the snitch. It was bound to be back to the pitch by now, and so far, the score was pretty even: Slytherin was in the lead with twenty points, and Gryffindor was close behind with ten. Harry rarely paid attention to the score, because as long as no one had gotten up into the triple digits, it was really either team's game. So long as Malfoy didn't find the snitch before him, Gryffindor still had a chance to win.
"And you like a mouse. Someone's gotta make up for it." That earned Ron a slap on the shoulder and a cheeky smirk.
Ron cracked his knuckles. "Time to head to the pitch?" Harry nodded, spelling his work away and grabbing his duffel bag next to him.
Harry smiled back, raising his own glass. “To healing the wards.”
TL;DR: A family emergency has arose, so there will be no new chapters for a while. I'm sorry, gang, I really am :/
The air between them was still for a moment as the boys did their work. There was something so peaceful about working together in the light of day. It was a different kind of peace than the one they found in the early hours of dawn in front of the common room fireplace.
Draco sighed, resting his writing hand on the table. ("Sinister!" his grandmother would always remind him as she forced him to write with his right; although he was ambidextrous, he began to solely use his left out of spite.) His hand left ink smudges on the woodgrain, masking its rich chestnut stain. "No."
"That is none of your concern."
Hermione set her spoon down, grapefruit momentarily forgotten. "Well, you see, Harry, you tend to feel... a certain way about the Slytherins. A-and I'm not saying that's a bad thing! I'm just saying it's a, um, very strong feeling, and sometimes you can get a little--"
So, Harry applied microscopic pressure to his breaks, making the distance between his and Malfoy's fingertips just slightly greater. But that miniscule difference in reach made all the difference, because just before Harry was able to, Malfoy scooped up the snitch, enclosing its wings in his grasp. The crowd went wild as Harry slowed down and Malfoy soared, higher than Harry's ever seen him. He whooped and hollered, flying over to his teammates and presenting them with the captured snitch. It was the first match of the season, and Harry didn't have the heart to crush Malfoy's beaming smile, so he flew over to his team to console them for the loss.
"N-No, Professor," Ron mumbled, smirk melting off his face as he looked back to his parchment.
Potter quirked a brow as he dipped his now dry quill in its ink pot. "What?"
He could hear her chuckle as he walked away and into the sea of drunk teenagers. Britney Spears changed to Janet Jackson, and Harry may or may not have lost his shit. He found Ron in the crowd, along with Dean and Seamus, and they all may or may not have danced completely inappropriately. "Woo"s and "Daaaaamn"s were shouted out by surrounding students when Seamus suddenly turned to Dean and smashed their lips together, quite messily if Harry was being honest. He felt himself smile while Ron hollered, "Get it, Seamus!" over the smooth vocals of "You Want This."
Hermione nodded. "Indeed a lot has changed since first year. You can tell me if you do not mind sharing." She gave him a small smile of encouragement.
Both ate their dessert but Draco kept eyeing Harry curiously. When they finished, Kreacher cleared the table once again.
Draco glared at Potter. "Thank you, Chosen One. I so appreciate such a grand gesture." He said sarcastically.
Narcissa looked at both boys and smiled. "Who is ready for some tea? I certainly am. Winky, bring us some tea and sandwiches please."
Draco looked at Harry intently. “I am sure they get their heads out of their arses for your sake. And if they do not, we can have Molly sort them out. She is a very scary person when you get on her bad side. I know she would be happy to help you if there is an issue.” He smiled at Harry.
Ron finally piped in. “He’s going to go crazy for the rings, mate. I’d say get them.”
Lucius ate some more chocolate. “That traitor is dead! You can not get approval from a bloody portrait, you plonker!” He yelled.
Narcissa came forward. "Hello Harry. It is lovely to see you again. I wish it were under different circumstances. Draco is resting at the moment. Before sending for him, I was hoping to talk with you first. I was wondering if we would be possible if Draco could stay with you for awhile. I think he desperately needs a break from the manor. I would understand if that would be too much but you are the only person aside from Severus I trust with the care of my son. I know how much he means to you and I feel you would take great care of him." She smiled warmly at him.
Draco turned over to face Harry. “I am ready. Take me, Potter.” Harry lifted Draco’s arse a bit and wrapped his fingers around Draco’s erection and started to stroke him. When Draco started leaking Harry slathered himself with his juices and moved Draco’s legs to his shoulders. He positioned himself right up against Draco’s puckered hole. “Do it already, Potter.” He said impatiently.
Harry nervously chuckled and stared into Draco’s eyes. “I never felt like I belonged anywhere until I found out that I was a wizard. My relatives were abhorrent people and their house never felt like home. The moment I entered Hogwarts, I knew I was home. It’s funny how you think nothing would feel right especially since you live with people who hate you with every fibre of their beings. But after meeting Hermione and Ron, I finally felt like myself and didn’t feel like a freak. Then I met Ron’s family and they took me like I was their own. I had a family and people who loved me and not for my fame.” He paused for a moment and took Draco’s hands in his own. “I always thought home was a place but it can also be people. The Weasleys are my family. Hogwarts is still my home but I now have another home and it’s not a place. It’s a person. It’s you, Dray.” He smiled. “When I first met you, you were such a prat and I just couldn’t stand you. As the years went by our rivalry just escalated and we were always competing and keeping score. Then eventually we became enemies. By some miracle we both survived the war and the day I visited you was the beginning of everything.” Harry got up and pulled Draco up with him. He knelt down on one knee and looked into Draco’s glassy eyes. “It hasn’t been easy for either of us. Before and after getting together. But I wouldn’t change a second of what has happened. Everything that happened was always supposed to bring us to this very moment.” He kissed the top of Draco’s hand. “I never thought our tug of war with each other would become this but I couldn’t be happier that it did. After Ginny, I didn’t know I had it in me to love so fiercely but I’m so in love with you Draco it almost hurts. I can’t imagine a future without you in it. I want to spend the rest of my days with you, Draco.” He pulled out the ring box and opened it. “Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you do me the honour of one day becoming my husband?”
you can't keep shutting us out like this." Hermione tried again, taking hold of his arm to keep him from turning away. Harry sighed. looking into her sad eyes with his own tired ones. She was right, she almost always was.
Harry left, shutting the door behind himself. He hadn't noticed that he had been holding his breath until he let it out, his back sagging against the closed door. He had been so nervous, so afraid that Draco wouldn't have liked the room.
“I'll be fine by tomorrow, I still want to do it." Ginny said firmly, cutting Ron off before he could protest. "Who will I be dueling?"
“I don’t know. I’m sure you could find people who thought they were. I’m sure Luna does. Why?”
The bogart turned to face Harry and forgot the old wizard as it seamlessly turned into Draco once more. It moved closer to Harry, his eyes just as cold as they had been before. “You will never be enough. You are a freak, just like your relatives thought. You won’t defeat the Dark Lord and you will never keep my heart.”

Sirius sighed, looking sad before replying. “He is old, and I believe the pressures of the war and of the many things he has survived has caused him to forgot that not every problem needs to be handled by meeting it head-on with force. He was once a good man, Harry. It is easy to forget in these moments, especially in the light of what has happened to you and your friends, but he was once a good man, not just a great one.”
"I'm sure." Draco nodded, needing to prove that he was strong. He could do this, even if he didn't feel that confidant.
questions-" She began, but Harry swiftly cut her off because she could go into a full lecture.
"You mean he's coming into his magic?" Severus diverted the conversation that he never wanted to have with a question to distract him.
"I know you are." Draco sighed, moving so that he could lean into Harry. He wasn't mad anymore, not after everything he had just learned. Suddenly everything made more sense, and while he certainly wasn't happy with the boy, he could no longer hold this oversight against him. Every bad thought he'd had that day seemed to become less significant and soon he was just glad that Harry was the boy that he was. He wondered if he'd have been as well rounded and caring as Harry was if he'd been treated the same way since birth. He knew then that Harry was hurting so much more than he would ever let on and it became partially his responsibility to get the boy to open up more. "Come on, let's go back in." Draco said finally, standing up and pulling Harry up with him. "We should probably be helping the girls research, or we're never going to hear the end of it." The two made their way from the lake into the castle, holding hands. Both felt significantly better and a small smile graced their faces.
Draco and Ginny met in the middle of the raised platform and bowed as was customary to in a proper duel. They parted after exchanging pleasantries. Draco stood at one end, wand raised above his head in a duel stance. Ginny stood on the other side, her wand pointed straight in front of herself, her other arm behind her back. They stared each other down waiting for Harry to give the signal.
"Is there a problem, Mr. Potter?" Professor Snape asked, his brow lifted as he looked down at the green-eyed boy from the side of his desk. Before Harry had time to respond, Neville chose that exact moment to put too much lavender in his cauldron and his sleeping drought turned a sickly shade of green before exploding spectacularly in the poor boy's face. "Honestly Mr. Longbottom, how you managed to sneak your way into this class… fifty points from Gryffindor." Snape growled, moving to take care of the mess.
Headmistress McGonagall whispered the chant to open the gate. Both Harry and Draco stepped through the threshold of Hogwarts. McGonagall smiled at them both. "Welcome back, boys. Please call me Minnie since you are no longer students. What is your business here at Hogwarts?" She looked at them curiously.
"I, er... just wanted to know what you were drinking. Out of the flask, I mean. I could smell it earlier and it sure didn't smell like firewhiskey." He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.
"Crêpe paper?" Harry asked, eyebrow raised.
He scuttled over to Draco, bowing so deep his long, crooked nose touched the floor. Potter looked at the pair with a raised brow. Draco disregarded him entirely. "Hello, Kreacher. What has Potter summoned you for at this ungodly hour?"
Harry snickered at that and sat forward, leaning his elbows on the table. “You can say that again.”
Hello everyone, before we get into this chapter, let's talk about trigger warnings in this fic. I am not going to be labeling every single little triggering moment in the fic because that would just be too much. I'm going to be blunt with y'all:
Harry chuckled as the group finally made it through the mess of teenagers and to the Grand Hall, where breakfast and the Winter Farewell Assembly took place. They checked their luggage with Filch and Hagrid, who gave the group his own farewell.
He cleared his throat and turned back to his parchment, a meek attempt at distracting them both from the awkward quiet that followed his declaration. Desperatley needing a change of subject, Draco blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "So. How is everything with the Black estate going?"
Draco didn't look at him-- couldn't possibly. "What."
“Kreacher. Enough.”
He was referencing the bet they had made late at night, both drunk with tiredness, a few days prior: whoever's team lost the game had to do the other's homework from a class of their choosing for a week. If Harry won, he'd make Malfoy complete his Runes work (his grade could really use the boost), and if Malfoy won, Harry would have to do his Defence work-- which wasn't too bad, but it's not like Harry was going to end up doing it anyway, because Malfoy was going
Potter's look of confusion had melted by then and was turned into one of wonderment. "When Sirius Black died, a part of the house died with him, as he was the last blood heir," Draco continued. "And if you don't set your wards in place soon, the house could lose all it's magic."
or whatever, was Draco. He may not have been as much of a bigot as he once was, but he was still a tosser to Harry. It made him feel more human, the teasing and pestering, and, somehow, he liked the strange friendship they've formed. It was familiar to Harry in this new and surprisingly ordinary reality he's been thrown into. Which was ironic, since Harry hated being thrown into the whole saving-the-world gig in the first place, but now... he sort of missed it.
Draco cleared his throat, making eye contact with Potter.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. "Of course I have, dullard. He was the house elf of my Great Aunts' estate."
It wasn't a question. Harry turned to him, nodding. "Of course, it's just a precautionary thing Kingsley needs to enforce..." He finally looked at Draco's face. It was blank, and carefully so. Harry could see something there, in the way his eyebrows were just slightly furrowed, how his shoulders were just a little too far forward. "You know," he tried, continuing down the narrow corridor, "It didn't take much convincing for Kingsley to let you help me."
Harry did as he was told. Malfoy weaved his way through his other team members, eyes finding Harry's.
Draco couldn't read him; he just seemed nervous and tired. He decided to be honest with the git, because what's the point in lying to him? "Wideye potion, diluted in a bit of cider."
"I'm going to stop you before the compliments you paid me are outweighed by the following insults." Draco shoved one bundle of the paperwork he was carrying into Harry's arms and then quickly bowed to the mirror, his voice sounding tight and a little higher pitched than normal. But when he passed Harry into the short corridor that led to the common room, he could see a light blush dusting the backs of the pale man's neck and ears. "I trust you too," is all he said before the mirror closed behind him. Harry didn't have time to squeeze through after he finally came to his senses.
“You know, the more I hear about Granger,” Draco turns to face Harry, a small smirk gracing his features, “The more I realise how alike we are.”
She shrugged him off of her. "Ronald. I am going to—"
No matter how many different thoughts were floating around in Draco's head, the ones about Potter always seemed to be the most intriguing.
The person before Harry was lacking in colour, face and hair a creamy white and traveling cloak a stark black against the dozen greys of the platform and station. His eyes were skittish, dancing about, and steely grey. They were less guarded than Harry remembered. But what truly shocked him was the person's hair: still blond and shiny, looking as soft and perfect as it always did– but it was a different kind of perfect. What once was slicked back and simply lacking in imperfections was now a messy undercut, but messy in the most purposeful way.
Ron laughed heartily, loud enough for anyone to hear over the music blaring through the charmed speakers. He wrapped an arm around her, speaking into the crook of her neck with a grin on his face. He looked like he was about to kiss her, like he wanted to do more than just kiss her. "You need to let loose, Hermione. Have some fun, live a little, et cetera, et cetera."
Harry’s jaw clenched involuntarily.  “Kreacher, what did we say—”
He drank to Harry, welcoming him into his home and breaking bread with him. To welcoming him into more than just his home. To walking him to class. To helping him with his Defence work. Knowing how he takes his tea. Sitting with him in the glow of the fire in the early hours of dawn. Asking him for advice and sharing the intimate details of his life with his formerly sworn enemy.
"To getting wasted!" Harry toasted and downed the shot. This time, his laugh was bigger, harder to contain. Pansy's cackle and his belly laugh fillined the air around them, drawing attention to their corner of the room. The onlookers smiled at them, some expressions filled with confusion, others too drunk to question why the Gryffindor "godsend" was laughing with Pansy Parkinson.
Harry nodded. “I know. It’s okay, Draco.” He shrugged off the look of resentment, but it left behind this deep rooted exhaustion in Harry’s eyes. “Well, if anything good is to come of it, it’s that I can make a mean dish.”
The elf not-so-subtly rolled his eyes. “Yes, Kreacher is to refer to him by his name, but Kreacher still thinks—”
She rolled her eyes (again... Harry began to think that she may do that a lot) as she grabbed the bottle and another shot glass. "Are you trying to get blackout drunk?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"May I ask you, Draco, why it is that you don't want to sleep?"
Draco smiled, just a little.
He decided to get some studying done. If he wasn't going to sleep, he might as well use the extra time to be productive. He accioed his NEWT level Ancient Runes textbook from his bag in the corner and began to read. Making something of himself was going to be a hell of a lot of work, especially with the angry mark that stained his arm and the blood that stained is hands.
“Hullo, Harry,” Luna bowed her head slightly in greeting. Her short, curly hair bounced with the action. She’d cut it into a pixie cut at the beginning of summer, and it was now down to her chin. “Happy Christmas.”
He shrugged. "Too late." She shook her head with a smile, and Harry grinned back. "I'm gonna go dance. Wanna come?"
"Hermione, I was not
Harry stepped away with a grin. As Ron and Hermione said their goodbyes, Harry felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned only to find a pale face with wide blue eyes smiling wistfully at him.
Harry chuckled. “Let’s keep the tour going, Kreacher.”
Harry shrugged, leading them down the dimly lit staircase. Torches adorned either side of the tunnel, lit indefinitely with a preservation charm, Harry supposed. "I owled him about our situation and he said he was making way with a movement to allow you to assist me with Grimmauld Place."
"Yes, Kreacher must be getting back. Masters should sleep now." With a telltale crack, Kreacher had apparated home, the tea set disappearing along with him.
________
“Well, he better become the type, and quick. Mum’ll have his head if he doesn’t.”
Harry set down his toast, confusion washing over him like waves on a shore. "What do you mean?"
, Harry thought. "Did I cover all the bases, 'Mione?"
"What about me?" Ron called to her as he half-guided, half-carried Harry away from the bar. Hermione turned on her heel to face him, hair bouncing along with her. The look of pure exasperation on her face made Harry giggle.
"Potter, she either is or isn't, there is no in-between."
"Yes, yes, he was plotting, scheming, conniving..." Ron takes a sip of his coffee.
. But what was somehow even worse was the smiling faces and the healthy relationships of those around him, expecting him to just become this normal person who could do... normal things. What "normal" entailed, Harry didn't even know. But regardless of what it was supposed to be, Harry hated it. Because normal meant quiet, and quiet had this nasty habit of being the perfect breeding ground of darkness and self-loathing that made Harry just so tired all of the time...
Draco’s hand falls from the shelf. “Impressive.”
"Ah, thank you," Ron said, smiling at her. When he turned back to Harry, his mouth turned into a worried frown. "You gotta let it go, mate. The war is over, it's done. No one is planning your downfall--" When Harry started to interject, Ron gave him a severe look, "--nor anyone else's for that matter. They're just kids."
Kreacher. To be honest, Harry didn’t blame Kreacher entirely for his rude behavior. Living in a house with sixteen generations of pureblood wizard bigotry must have taken a toll on one’s mind, and Harry himself knew just how difficult it was to deal with Sirius’ rebellious nature. But the elf could have some goddamn respect for him, especially now that he was dead.
Harry continued walking to the kitchen, leaving Draco on the third floor. He felt rude for leaving Draco to his own devices, and Circe knows what Molly Weasley would say about Harry’s hosting. But he needed a moment to himself. Being in that house, with all the memories and all the wounds that still haven’t healed… it was always a shock for the first day or so. And Harry couldn’t tell if it was better or worse with Draco Malfoy there with him.
He said the words with so much conviction that Potter finally abandoned his horrid posture for something a little more respectable. "...You'll do what, exactly?"
Draco worked, making small talk. He knew very little of the inner workings of a magical piece of art, but he'd been reading up on it for his History of Magic summer work, and he figured talking with one would be beneficent to his understanding of them. Plus, what else was he supposed to do from dusk till dawn? Do his homework in moody silence?
"Fine, I suppose. Or as well as can be expected."
Harry shrugged, setting aside the prepared tea infuser. He turned his back to Draco and leaned against the table, staring at the kettle. If he focused, he could feel a sort of tickling at his back, as though someone was grazing their fingers over his spine. “Why does it want our magic?”
Draco sat down at the table stiffly, watching Harry as he busied himself with preparing the leaves. “I can feel the house, pulling at me. It is attracted to our magical auras.” He looked at Harry with narrowed eyes, his pale face scrunched up. He looked a little like Hermione in that moment. “I’m surprised you cannot feel it.”
The elf nodded eagerly and practically skipped out the door.
Annoyed and presumably tired, The Boy Who Lived huffed and set his work out on the coffee table in front of him, bringing Draco out of his slight daze. Potter leaned back on his elbows, groaning and scrunching his face up into a pout.
It drove him mad. And well so, he thought. No one else in the hall sat any table but their house's. Well, besides, Neville. But this morning Neville was sitting at his assigned table, chatting Seamus and Dean up about Circe knows what. But Malfoy was sitting with Luna once more. Harry wondered why he hadn't brought it up last night-- perhaps it was because Malfoy was actually tolerable in their discussion of wards and wizarding homes. He seemed quite knowledgeable about the subject, too. Maybe even more so than Hermione. Which reminded Harry that he needed to discuss such things with his best friend.
He trailed off as Draco pointedly looked at his stack of books. He shrugged. “It was a close game.” Though in all honesty, he just felt a little bad for making Harry do extra work— even if it was a bet.
"Bloody Hell, c'mon. We're gonna end up crashing another car into the Whomping Willow if we don't hurry," he joked.
"Wait," Potter shook his head, looking over to Draco. "What do you mean stay at Grimmauld Place?"
Draco drank to more than just that, however.
"He seemed to like you," Potter said after a moment's silence.
Part of him told him not to dwell on it, not to give in to what Hermione and Ron had been saying for the past day (the past year, if he was being honest). But Draco Malfoy was an enigma, always had been, and Harry still has yet to figure him out. It's been eight years, and Harry still isn't any closer to understanding the prat, but he'd be damned if he gave up now.
Ron, who was buzzed, but not nearly as drunk as Harry, grabbed the glass out of Harry's hand and downed the rest in a quick gulp. "Not true; he just can't hold his liquor."
Harry set down the spatula and leaned against the counter, facing Draco, as he let the meal cook. “On paper? My aunt and uncle. But in truth, I took care of myself.”
Ron scoffed. "Sweet Lady George, you're drunk."
"Shuuuush," Harry grumpily quieted Ron as he tried to drink out of the glass. When no drink came forth, he frowned and look to Theodore Nott, who was obviously listening in on the conversation. "Another round, Nott!"
So instead of allowing the nightmares to come, he drank Wideye potion constantly-- kept it in a flask on his hip. The effects have been mild since he started drinking it about two months ago. If he went too long without it, Draco got shaky and light headed, but it was nothing he couldn't handle. Draco's biggest issue was that he'd been building up a tolerance to it-- slow, but enough to where he's had to brew a stronger potion. Draco had heard of this sort of thing, read about the condition in some healer textbook in the Malfoy library. Potion Abuse, they called it. Draco knew that it could get bad, that he was slowly approaching the Point of No Return. But it was fine. He was fine. Draco could handle it for a little longer, a few more weeks and he'll have gone so long without having the nightmares that they'll just... disappear.
Harry rolls his eyes, ignoring them but also not. Ron swallowed, looking at the Slytherin table again. "Speaking of the ferret, where is Draco?"
Harry threw his arms up in the air, sloshing some of his drink onto the stone floor. "'Mione! Ron! 'S wonderful to see yuh!"
Thank you all so much! It really made my afternoon to see all of you checking up on my little ol' fic :') Hope you all have a splendid evening, and without further ado, please enjoy this long awaited chapter!
Ginny nudged him with her elbow. The normalcy of the interaction made Harry grin. “So. You excited for Christmas this year?”
“Surprisingly, not.” Harry frowned and turned back to Draco’s defence work. “Every time he talks about Hermione to me, it’s like he’s talking about being in love with my sister, you know? It’s just a little strange, is all. I don’t think I’ve gotten used to them dating yet, even though we lived together over the majority of the summer.”
Harry smiled widely back at Draco. “Does this mean you forgive me, future husband?” He blushed at the word husband.
Draco held onto Harry's hands just tightly. "Boy Potter you are a soppy sod! Even if I feel the same as you do. I think I have reached my capacity for the sharing and caring portion of this conversation. I know that sounds quite Slytherin to you I am sure."
Draco pulled Harry close. “How are you holding up, love? I know having your parents, Sirius and Remus back must be a lot to take in.”
Pansy scuffed at the exchange. “Sucking up to our Golden Boy already, Blaise? Is that really necessary?” She sneered at Harry.
Narcissa pricked her finger and let the book absorb her blood. She started chanting. “Peto converteret amissorum, peto converteret amissorum, peto converteret amissorum. Hostias et pariet Sirius Black et Remus Lupin. Hostias et pariet James et Lily Potter.” She shouted and everything went black.
Draco ate a sandwich and drank some tea while waiting for Potter's reply. He smirked smugly because Potter was still trying to figure out what he'd say back.
Hermione smiled softly. “Surprisingly it sounds perfect. You really did think about what to do. By the way you better owl me about how it goes, Harry.”
"I am also pleased to know my mother has no problem with me being gay. I am just happy I am no longer under my father's thrall. I enjoy being free of him actually. And have you not heard of the boy pulling a girl's pigtails because he likes her? Plus I did not want to like you that way and it is embarrassing to admit you like your supposed enemy. I could never tell anyone. It is almost a relief to tell someone even if it is the object of my affection." Draco looked down at the ground embarrassed.
Harry reluctantly got off the sofa. “Let’s freshen up.” He slowly walked out of the room and Draco followed.
Harry hugged back. “Thank you for coming with me. Both of you. It meant the world to me to share this with you.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I’ll go to the Burrow really quick. You stay here. I’ll be right back.” He walked to the Floo and vanished as he said “the Burrow”.
Harry looked at Ron and Hermione. “That was quicker than I had expected it to be. Thank Merlin for Hermione. I would’ve been agonising over what rings to get. And now I don’t need to search for wedding bands. I’m all set.” He smiled thoughtfully.
Hermione smirked. “I am glad I was there to help. Oh, I know how helpless you would be without me.” She teased. “So do you have a plan for the proposal?” Kreacher popped back in with the tea and left a moment later.
Hermione blushed. “Sev, are you asking me to live with you?” She teased. “I mean I am sure my books would appreciate the change of venue.” She smirked. “And I would not mind it either.”
Draco gulped and eyed the front door. "Our floo was disconnected after the war. The only way I can leave is by going out the door unfortunately. I knew this was going to happen. I do not want you to get into trouble with the press because of me. It was silly of me to come here and put you in danger." Draco was panicking.
Harry stepped forward. "Headmistress, it's lovely to see you again. Thank you for letting us come today. We both appreciate it." He smiled at her.
Harry finally spoke. "I think we should go to sleep. Turn around and you can be the little spoon." Draco gave him a nod and turned around. Harry wrapped his arm around him and pulled him closer. "Good night, Dray." He kissed his shoulder affectionately.
Severus spurted a bit before responding. “I will have you know it is none of your business, Narcissa.” He blushed.
Hermione smirked. “It is simple. Magic.” She said cheekily. “And as for when I would like to move in with you, anytime would be good. I would have to discuss it with my parents but I know they will support my decision.”
Draco pulled away slightly. “Bloody hell, Potter! You really are something else.” He chuckled. “I am so in love with you it almost hurts too.” He kissed Harry once again.
Narcissa noticed them come into the room and stood up to greet them. “Hello darlings. What a pleasant surprise! What is the special occasion? Did I forget that you were coming by?” She smiled sweetly.
Severus smirked at the witch. "Of course you were researching. I am hardly surprised. What did you find?"
Harry closed the gap by kissing Draco softly. After a few seconds, their kiss got more intense. Without breaking the kiss, he backed up until the back of his knees hit the loveseat. As he sat down, he pulled Draco down with him until he had Draco sitting on his lap. They continued to kiss for quite some time until air became an issue.
Harry holds Draco tightly. “I will be there with you while you tell him and if he acts up I will lay him out on his arse for being a racist arse. I promise you will not have to do this on your own, Dray.” He kissed him on his cheek.
Remus stared in surprise and slowly stepped closer to Sirius. “Please everyone calm down! Siri, let us listen to Harry and the Malfoy heir.”
Harry chuckled. “Dray, I swear if I didn’t know any better I’d think you were a cat.” Draco laughed. “But yes I’ll join you. Anywhere you go, I go.” He kissed Draco ghostly soft and stood up. He helped Draco up and pulled him out of the room and up the stairs into their bedroom. After removing their clothes aside from their shirts and underwear.
Hermione smiled. “Wonderful. I am glad I came to visit. Otherwise, I probably would have had to visit most of you in St. Mungo’s. You men can be such stubborn arses! Again, I had to save the day. Sheesh! Harry and Ron wouldn’t survived at Hogwarts without me and now this. I should get a bloody award for dealing with idiots like you. It’s a wonder that the human race- magical or not- is still going strong with you idiotic men.” She huffed.
An exhausted Narcissa walked into the room slowly. “I am the one who summoned you actually.” Everyone looked at her curiously. “There is a blood magic spell that the Malfoy family created long ago. Earlier today when Harry came by, I saw how sad he was. He missed you all so much. I took it upon myself to cast the spell. I have never used it before so I did not know if it would work or not but I had to try for Harry. He has done so much for my family and I wanted to give his back. Unfortunately, I passed out before I could explain. I am pleased to see no one has ripped my son apart. I appreciate that.” She smirked.
That's when Severus decided to get closer to Hermione. "Miss Granger? May I help you to another room?" There was no response as he continued to get closer to her. "Miss Granger? I mean, Hermione? May I help you?" He smiled softly.
Narcissa hugged Harry once more. “Harry, I know it is a difficult time for you but you have many people who care for you and want the best for you. Myself included. I know Arthur, Molly and I can not replace your parents. And Severus certainly never replace Sirus or Remus.” She chuckled lightly. “We are always here for you no matter what.” For a moment Narcissa was lost in thought. Suddenly she released Harry. “Excuse me for a bit. I need to attend to something.” She quickly left the room.
Severus sputtered to answer at first. “You really are a cheeky one, Miss Granger.” He chuckled lightly and nervously bit his lip. “Well, um, I do not want you to think we are moving too swiftly but I suppose I am asking you to live with me at Spinner’s End.”
Ron stopped when he got close enough and cleared his throat nervously. “I, uh, wanted to apologise to you all for my behaviour. I shouldn’t’ve judged you for who fell in love with. Harry, after everything you’ve been through you deserve brilliant things. Draco, I let my prejudices against your family cloud my better judgment. Hermione, I always thought we would be together for life and seeing you with Snape was a shock but I still never should’ve said those horrid things to you. Snape, after all you have done for our world I should’ve been more respectful. I’m so sorry for everything I said and done. I hope you all can forgive me someday.” He looked at them sheepishly.
When Hermione heard her first name, her eyes flitted to Severus and she nodded. He went over to her and she leaned most of her weight onto him as he wrapped his arm around her. Severus guided her out of the room that held such terrible memories for the witch. They entered a room lined with bookshelves. Severus placed Hermione gently onto the love seat. "As you can observe this room is the library. I thought it might calm you if you were near something that you hold close to your heart. Books." She gave him a small smile. "Also, I summoned a modified calming draught. It will not make you fall asleep. It just takes the edge off of your panic attack symptoms." He handed her the vial and she gulps it down without question. He saw her visibly relax and she sighed in relief.
Harry places two tea cups onto the kitchen table and got milk and sugar. He gestured Draco to sit. He poured the tea for them both and sat down next to Draco.
"I was just teasing you, Draco. As you know I was with Ginny." Harry informed his new friend.
Ginny smiled at her girlfriend. “Luna, you are my angel.” She kissed her on the cheek. “Draco, my mum is right. The past should stay in the past. Welcome to the family.”
Harry tiptoed his way down the stairs once again. He checked the time once more. Surprisingly he was a bit early but he knew Narcissa would not mind. He apparated out of Grimmauld Place hoping Draco would not be cross with him for leaving without saying goodbye. If he was, he would make it up to Draco somehow. When he apparated into the Manor, he stumbled like he always did.
Harry yawned and smiled at Hermione. "I believe you're right. Life can only get better from here if everyone works together. And I hope the wizarding world will truly heal from this war. I don't want to live in the past and would love if our people can move forward. Sirius was right. If only others could have had his line of thinking, it would make healing the world a bit easier. I still really miss him, Hermione. I wanted to live with him and be a family. I also wanted to hear all the crazy stories about the Marauders especially about my father and Remus. All those memories are lost because everyone is gone. It's quite a shame." He sighed.
"I mean you do not have to stay if you rather not. I just thought we could get to know each other more. I mean we are trying to be friends. I thought it would make sense if you stayed awhile longer. I am sorry it was a silly idea. Forgive my forwardness." Draco rambled nervously.
Severus was the first to move away and he motioned for Hermione to follow him. She trailed behind him. Once she caught up, he gently guided her through the Manor avoiding that one particular room that held such menacing memories for her. When they got to the front entrance, Severus held the door for Hermione and after she stepped out of the manor he was right behind her. They continued to walk in silence as they slowly approached the Manor's gate.
In the short while Severus had been back amongst the living, he had slowly fallen in love with the know-it-all muggleborn witch who had once incessantly annoyed him while he taught Potions. Severus felt like he was always destined to end up with a Gryffindor ever since Lily. He was thankful that he had another chance at love and to him Hermione was everything and more. He admired her mind and the way she treated others. He knew that he had found his perfect match intellectually and emotionally. She brought out parts of him that he thought were long dead and challenged him in ways he never thought possible. And today he was planning to tell her that he had fallen in love with her and wanted to know if she felt the same.
Draco hummed in contentment. “I have a better idea.” He smirked mischievously. He scooted closer to Harry until their noses were inches apart.
Severus walked up to Narcissa. "Apparently crafty old Albus had a gift for Draco when he arrived at Hogwarts. He interwoven my essence with a doe figurine and an incantation to be spoken. Miss Granger, I mean, Hermione was the one who activated the doe and brought me back. And Minnie suggested that I stay with Draco rather than returning to Spinners End."
One day, Draco decided to ask his mother about why Harry Potter saved the Malfoy family from certain doom. He just needed to know why he was spared.
Draco yawned. "Dray, I think it's time for sleep. Let's head upstairs. Kreacher will clean up the table." He grabbed Draco's hand and his suitcase and they headed upstairs.
Harry sighed happily. "I actually had a bloody good time. Narcissa and Draco are so much different without the elder Malfoy around. It was refreshing."
Draco finally arrived in the dinning room for breakfast. Winky served him a full plate and he knew he was expected to eat every morsel whether he wanted to or not. He was being watched by his mother and Winky which was very unnerving. He picked up his fork and ate his first bite. Their house elf looked pleased with herself. His mother smiled at him.
Draco’s expression softened slightly. “Potter, you are so bloody frustrating. I want to be furious with you but you start talking and I just can not stay angry.” He sighed. “I am not at all surprised by my father’s actions. At first I did want to see him one last time but as I thought about it I think it best that I never see his face again for as long as I live. I am pleased that my mother got a divorce. She deserves so much more. And I think I will change my last name to Black. I want to shed this toxic Malfoy skin and the only way to do so is to walk away from it. You and my mother are brilliant. I will definitely give his money away to muggleborn charities. Was there anything else you two talked about?”
Once both prepared their tea, they waited for it to cool. "So, Draco what did you want to say to me that you were unable to say in a letter? Was it that complex?" Harry teased.
Harry watched as Draco disappeared through the gate. He apparated back to Muggle London. As he approached his street, he noticed the reporters had left much to his relief. He slipped into his house quickly and quietly. Once inside he prepared his dinner. He leisurely ate once it was ready. As he finished his meal, Hermione popped in.
Harry started walking into the kitchen and put water into a kettle for tea. "I hope you know that I really don't care what the papers say about me. I'm used to good and bad press. I don't have the Daily Prophet delivered anymore because I got tired of hearing about what silly gossip they had written about me. Now, I only read the Lovegood's Quibbler. And I'll always give Luna an interview without a second thought. I trust she won't make anything up or deviate off topic. Any other paper is just a load of bollocks when I'm mentioned."
Ron laughed. “Joke’s on her I suppose. I’ve already made too many mistakes with our friendship. I let my prejudice get in the way. I’m no better than Lucius if I can’t let go of the past. If the ferret makes you happy I suppose I can deal with him being around for the long haul. Bloody hell Harry you’re getting engaged!” He grinned.
Draco slowly moved forward until their lips touched. Harry deepened the kiss and wrapped his arm around him until they were flush against each other. Both moaned softly into the kiss. They continued to kiss until they were unceremoniously interrupted by Errol the owl once again. Harry groaned and muttered as he wrote an answer to the letter.
Draco was finally ready for breakfast, but not ready for Potter. He needed to calm down before tea time or he was going to make a fool of himself. And Malfoys do not make fools of themselves in front of enemies.
Severus observed his godson. "You should not have to hide your relationship or cater to others' sensitivities but I do understand considering he is the Saviour of the Wizarding World you need to proceed with caution. It is a wise decision on both your parts. Your family is not in good standing in our world right now and the press may assume you are trying to redeem your family's name by spending time with their Saviour. Though, no one who matters will think that of you. Let us go inside."
Severus smiled and nodded. “I truly would be interested in seeing that memory at some point.”
Draco kissed Harry on the cheek. “It may not have cheered up me up but it most definitely distracted me from yesterday’s cock-up with my father. Thank you for trying. I love you with all my heart, Potter.” He softly kissed Harry’s lips.
Harry sighed in relief. “I am very pleased you weren’t alone. Anyway, what was said during this meeting and what does it have to do with me?”
He trailed off when Harry kissed him gently. He leaned into the kiss and moaned very softly. He was pulled closer to Harry so he could deepen the kiss. They pulled away to catch their breath. Harry kissed Draco's nose and they both chuckled.
Draco stared at Harry. “I did not know you spoke at my father’s trial. I always wondered why my mother and I were spared but my father was not. It was your words that kept him from freedom. I appreciate your faith in us and thank you for providing true freedom.” He grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed it while he kissed him on the cheek. All the while, Lucius still looked disgusted with the display but did not say anything. The guard was smirking the whole time.
Harry and Draco both stood up and walked Hermione to the floo.
Once they got to the front entrance of Hogwarts, she turned to Harry and Draco. "I think it best if we see Professor Snape first. All the students are currently in class so we can get to my office easily and without any interruptions."
He tried to gather his thoughts. "Why did you wake me up? What is happening?" He said groggily.
Harry and Draco take ahold of each other's hands, they said their goodbyes to Narcissa and Severus. They apparated out of the manor and immediately landed in Grimmauld Place's kitchen.
Molly interrupted the greetings. “I called you four here for a purpose. Ronald, get your arse over here.” She gave her son a tight smile. Ron walked into the room with his head down. “Now do the right thing.” She nodded to him.
Draco smiled a bit too widely at Harry's response. "Harry, would you like to go out and sit by the garden? I know you were only going to stay for afternoon tea but it is pleasant being around you." He blushed a little.
Kreacher woke them telling them they were needed at the Manor. And they straightened themselves out. Holding hands they apparated to the manor.
Severus cleared his throat. “Potter and I were discussing who could bridge the gap between blood status and house sorting. He seems to think he could. Though, he may be right but he will not able to do it alone like he seems to think. It will be a team effort, much like defeating Voldemort if I remember correctly.”
Harry smirked at Lucius. “About that, Severus has been resurrected due to his sacrifice and Dumbledore’s sneakiness. And Severus does accepts us, you bloody git! Without having to be a spy, he is a pretty decent bloke. And he is more of a man than you ever will be, Lucius. You are weak and always will be.” He sneered at Lucius and smiled at Draco.
Both were silent as the grave until Hermione piped in. "Again, thank you for keeping me company and being there for me. I appreciate it, Sev."
Hermione was startled by such a kind gesture from Severus and looked at him curiously. "Why are you being so nice to me? Not to be rude but you have never been one to be kind especially someone like me."
Harry avoided Draco's gaze by sipping at his last bit of tea. He cleared his throat before speaking again. "I need to tell you something and it's a bit personal but it needs to be said. I told Hermione about our kiss and how it made me feel like fireworks went off in my head. I've never had that incredible feeling before. It was so exhilarating and can't wait for a repeat. Honestly, all of my intense feelings have always involved you whether they were negative or positive. I never thought I could feel so much for one individual. Now I know how my parents felt for each other. Sirius told me a bit about their relationship in the early years. I always thought that kind of love would never happen for me but now I realise I may have been wrong. I'm sorry if I'm getting too serious. I don't want to scare you off. I really can't lose you, Draco." He looked at Draco tenderly.
After what seemed like an eternity, Draco observed Harry. "Potter, I mean Harry, does this mean we are friends now?" He asked nervously.
Narcissa waved. "Be sure to say hello to Andromeda for me the next time you see her. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day."
Harry squeezed Draco's hand gently. "My friends trust my judgment. They know I spoke on your behalf during the trials for a reason. And that surprises me to hear about Blaise but he was never nasty to me. And the only people I've lost track of time with were just the Weasleys. Well until today with you. I really enjoyed this afternoon with you and your Mother. I'm glad I sent you an owl last night. It's one of my best decision and as you know there aren't a lot of those. I agree we should get together again soon." He smiled at Draco.
Hermione smacked Ron's arm and gave him a nasty look. "Ron! Do not be so rude! Like you would know if this will work out! You have an emotional range of a bloody teaspoon! We should both be supportive. The war is over and it is time to put everything in the past. If we do not another war will happen in the future which none of us want. If Draco and Harry can move past everything that happened, we owe it to them to give them a chance."
After Narcissa left, she went up to the Malfoy secret library where they kept the family’s blood magic books. When she had heard how sad Harry was, she thought of something that she had long forgotten about. There was a spell that could bring back loved ones. She grabbed the book that had the spell. Narcissa flipped through the pages and finally found the the perfect spell. She looked over the words.
Sirius interrupted the sweet moment by opening his mouth. “So group hug everyone?” Everyone just glared at him. “What? It is a legitimate question. Don’t get all judgy.”
Narcissa looked at her son. "I doubt he would do that. He saved us for a reason and I am sure he would not be that petty."
