But the worry reached a peak. A peak of fear. On Wednesday morning. An owl swooping over the breakfast table on dropped something unfamiliar to Draco. A letter. It seemed normal to the others. But Draco knew better.
A breath was caught in Draco's throat. He could feel tears pricking their way into his eyes, but he quickly blinked them back.
One remark by his father's brother's wife, or something like that, rang through Draco's head.
What if he'd stop at Dumbledore?
"That's the problem, you can't solve it! My father wants me to move to Durmstrang. They- my parents- must've had an agreement, my father wanted me to go to Durmstrang when I was young because they have a finer education system."
"Oh, got lucky Potter," he spat out.
Far below the Gryffindor towers resided a fair-haired boy, who just couldn't sleep. Not with the swirling thoughts of Sirius Black in his head, along with professor Lupin, his father, and just everything.
Draco could almost feel himself pulling heavy walls up, as he cleared his throat and put on the mask. "Disgusting. Lupin loved him, like he always does. Well, I suppose I'm lucky to have just gotten detention with it, I mean, imagine if McGonagall had seen me!"
"Have a biscuit, Remus."
Lupin was calling out his name. The professor waved his hand, inviting Draco to face the boggart. Draco's stomach was clenching and twisting uncomfortably. He felt sick and light headed, and his heartbeat was way too fast. His fingers had gone pale, as he was gripping his wand so hard.
"As it happens, I'm well aware of your situation. You don't surely think your parents wouldn't have consulted me? As for my opinion, I think it would be- ah, beneficial for you to know, your parents wouldn't want you to speak of it to anyone. The decision is still at an early stage, and if not for your father's position in the ministry, would be impossible."
"There's no point, they don't listen to me."
Draco pushed the blade into his skin, and watched as the glimmering blood rose up from his skin. The mess inside was slowly pouring out, as the pain took over, and the warm blood stained his skin. Tears slipped down from his eyes, blurring his vision.
"He was their friend!"
Draco found a paper on the floor, filled with messy notes, and ripped it up, throwing each piece into the burnt-out coal of the fireplace, before slumping onto the sofa. He just couldn't concentrate. Something inside him was threatening to burst out.
But the sudden sound of footsteps drawing nearer, along with the edging dot of professor Lupin made Harry hastily stuff the map back in and break out of thought. Lupin rounded from the corner, and eyes came to focus as he saw Harry.
And with that, Harry hurriedly ran out, stuffing the letter in his pockets, leaving Hermione and Ron looking at each other warily.
"Shut it, Lupin, you're not intruding on anything. Was I intruding when you let me stay in your house when shit got bad?"
And suddenly, words were escaping his mouth, as the sudden emotion turned to rage.
"If you don't want to face the boggart, that's completely okay with me. I'm very sorry, though, Draco, if there's anything I could do to help you, please don't hesitate to come up to me," said Lupin solemnly.
A very weary looking Remus Lupin opened it, and his face lit up in surprise as he saw Draco. He waved his hand, and Draco walked in, eyeing the bottles of a familiarly fiery smelling potion from which rings of smoke were rising from.
"You can't help me," whispered Draco.
friends would
Harry's hands were surprisingly warm. Their fingers intertwined, making butterflies flutter in Draco's stomach. He could hear Harry's slightly heavy breath, thick with emotions, as they walked up to the classroom. But Draco stopped before the door.
Professor Lupin was gazing outside the window, and had a look in his eyes that made him look like he was remembering something. He looked nostalgic, and seemed to be in the midst of reliving a memory. The faint smile disappeared however when he noticed Draco, tear stained and breathing rapidly.
"Harry," pestered Ron. "Wake up! McGonagall's looking at you again."
He slowly got up from the bed, looking at the warm orange slowly colour the sky, though the waves of the lake blurred and rippled through it. Yawning and stretching, he picked up his Arithmancy book, cursing the subject, before trying to distract himself with it.
Draco's hands were travelling through Harry's messy locks of hair, that curled everywhere, as Harry pulled him closer.
A small smile formed on his lips. "You really did achieve your dream, didn't you?"
A certain Slytherin sitting at the astronomy tower pulled his knees closer to his chest. The wind was flowing harshly through his hair. No longer gelled and combed, it was flying messily around his face and catching in his eyes. Draco brushed the hair out of his face and held his head in his cold hands.
The two of them sat behind Harry, who didn't seem to have noticed a thing. Hermione drew the paper from her pocket, and stared sympathetically at Harry, who seemed so lost in his thoughts that he hadn't heard them. But after exchanging a look with Ron, she tapped him on the shoulder, and flinched as he gave a start.
"But back to you," said Lupin, clearing his throat. "Your situation."
Ron's gaze softened, and his words seemed more sensitive as he spoke. "Y'know, you could always tell Dumbledore. Or Lupin, because- I mean- you guys seem close."
The smell of fresh grass was near sickening as Draco slowed down, feeling small drops of morning drizzle land on his skin. He just wanted to run away, be free. The quidditch pitch was right in front of him; the stands towering over, as the coloured stands wrapped around.
"Potter and Malfoy, please follow me," he said in a somewhat tired and exasperated voice, lined with disappointment. Draco had been weirded out by the professor, to say the least, in the past. He'd come up to Draco and asked about his home life more than once now, which was slightly scary.
So he would.
Red and yellow jumper back to back against green and white.
"Go on, let's see if you're really as smart as you think you are," he sneered, in a voice very unlike the one he used with Ron and Hermione. "Let's see if your beloved
"I bet your
There were shelves filled with various objects, as well as a huge bookshelf, filled with different books. A cage with some type of interesting creature was kept towards a wall, next to a locked chest. The walls were faded brown, and the whole room felt really warm and comforting, almost like home.
"Shut up Ron!" Hermione looked and sounded exasperated. "Haven't you seen the way Harry looks at him now?"
The cold ice on the rock had never felt so numb. He didn't even know where he was. As soon as he found out, he ran. He ran far away, hoping he could escape it all. Hoping everything would be normal for once.
"No, he's helped me this year, and I'd understand why he wouldn't want someone like
"Well, I better be off then. Nice meeting you," she said, with a little bow, and skipped off, attracting the stares of several students. The muffled chatter became clear as the doors opened, and professor Sprout spotted Draco, giving him a proud look, which Draco returned with a glare.
"Oh right," Lupin chuckled. "Sirius Black and James Potter- Harry's father- were best friends. They were closer than ever, and knew each other like brothers. Honestly, to me they were brothers, if not by blood, then by love. So when Sirius ran away, it was natural for him to run of to his brother. And the Potters always treated him like their son. Together, they loved him more than his biological family ever did."
His tongue trailed over a sore spot in his mouth- after biting it so many times, he could taste blood.
"Certainly, as soon as I see you perform the
"Well that's Potter for you. Always has to be the worst at everything, but still worshiped by everyone else."
McGonagall was also an option, but she had enough on her plate, as well as Dumbledore, what with Sirius Black out of Azkaban. Remus knew he should tell Dumbledore about the animagus aspect, but couldn't help the dying light in his heart, telling him that Sirius was innocent.
"Thank you, I guess? Um, what are you doing here? No offense."
But even though Draco would rather do anything than face his father again, something inside of him made him want to fight back, and to face the fear in the face. It might've been foolishness, but it made him want to conquer it, and that was supposed to be good.
Draco's forearm was stinging badly, especially with the cold winds brushing streams of undried blood over his pale skin. He held his arm up, staring at the dark blood forming streams over his arm. It was almost poetic, like a canvas being painted over.
"By the way, professor Lupin said he wanted to talk to you, I think. I heard him mention it to professor Snape. He sounded worried," she said, very matter-of-factly.
"You think I haven't tried? Where d'you think I got these from?" Draco pulled up his sleeve, and waved his wand, letting the charms fall. Pale skin was washed away by faded bruises that lay in lines, like each one was carefully imprinted onto his skin.
"None taken," she said, with a smile on her face. "I'm just admiring the venemous tentancula. They're known to be helpful in memory potions, though everyone else believes otherwise."
"I- I can't intrude on your-"
Draco was sent out, as Lupin needed to speak "privately" to Harry, and he left the room, giving a cold glare to Harry. He was filled with cold rage, and a little guilt or sadness.
tw; mentions of child abuse.
"I- I don't think so," said Draco hesitantly, wanting to bite back the words as soon as they'd left his mouth.
He still believed there was something. Which was why, he was holding back tears when he saw two boys, one with dark, messy hair and one with light, combed hair sitting back to back at the perch of the astronomy tower. And he didn't have the heart to tell them it was after hours.
Draco wiped away his tears and walked with Harry, holding his hand. He looked into Harry's eyes. And Merlin, he could drown in them. Deep, forest green, with shades of the different colours in nature. It also sort of reminded him of an Aurora Borealis, like the one he saw on holiday once.
"Harry really likes Malfoy. I really don't know what goes on in that mind of yours, but the reason Harry's been so lost in thought recently is because of him."
Lunch came around, and brought Draco's favourite, shepherd's pie. It was something the house elves would always arrange for to make Draco happy as a child, whenever they spotted him crying. Of course, they'd always know the reason, but would never say a word. Although Dobby was much nicer than the others, by caring just a little more than his parents did.
"Really?" The lawyer asked frantically, hastily pulling her feet off the desk as she stuffed her wand in her pocket. "Send him in then!"
"I- I- yeah, you're right," said Ron, rubbing his cheek sheepishly.
She gave him a smile, took his hand, and gave him a small kiss on the cheek before running off, Remus grinning fondly just behind her.
Remus smiled as her accent started getting thicker- it'd always been a trait he found adorable in her. "Calm down," he chuckled. "I can barely understand you."
"I think you and I both know who I want to talk about. Contrary to usual, it isn't Harry Potter. It's only now that I've taken a special interest in-
They stayed like that, curled up and savouring each other's warmth. It was a lifetime, but also just a small fragment of both their lives. And they stayed like that, because they knew that this moment was a rare one. One that they'd maybe never live in again.
"But one day, he crossed a line. He was kicked out, though he likes to say he ran away. Harry's grandparents took him in. And of course, at first it was difficult. But after a while, he slowly got through it, and slowly healed. Trust me, if he could get through what he'd been through, you can too."
okay yes this coversation was ooc and robotic, but i like luna. hope you liked it.
"It won't keep him- him from trouble... but, it's the right thing to do," trailed off Hermione, sounding more doubtful now. She let go of Crookshanks, who hurried outside, as her eyes flickered over to the crisp, ivory parchment that was lying on the floor, outside the arched entrance of the Great Hall.
"If you, you know, want to talk about it- I mean, I know we're not exactly that close yet, but if you want to talk about it, you can talk to me," Harry said awkwardly.
"Has your bloody brilliant mind thought about how much trouble he'll get in? The bloke was in
"What- he doesn't- what?" Ron's face was so distorted, it was funny. Hermione suppressed a grin, and hit him lightly on the back of his head.
They went on like this, dodging each other's spells, therefore attracting a large crowd of students, blocking the corridors. And it was almost fun, seeing as Draco almost never had time to talk to Harry, as much as he wanted to.
"Good evenin', ma'am. Thir's a sickly man 'ere tae see ye."
He just couldn't.
"Draco, listen," he said softly. "Breathe slowly, come on, with me." He took a deep breath and let it out. Draco tried to mimic it, and after a few breaths, it worked. He squeezed his eyes shut, and tried to calm himself down. And there was something about Harry's mere presence that helped. It almost felt like a warm blanket, and Draco was freezing out in the cold.
"Well, we have to tell Harry about this, don't we?"
The door opened, and he heard those distinctive footsteps, not too fast and moderately heavy, slowly and confidently walk out of the closet. He opened his eyes, and watched as the figure's eyes filled with rage before him. He didn't know what to do.
"Excuse me? I'm being responsible!" Hermione's hair was tasseled, and her voice was frantic, but she remained composed. Crookshanks fiddled with a strand of wool, loose from her jumper, as he laid in her arms.
enjoy this, wouldn't they?" Draco sneered. But something about the remark sounded hollow and defeated. Draco had never shown this side of him to anyone. This was scary.
He suddenly stood up, and stepped over the bench, making sure he was making as much noise as he could. Turning his head, and brushing the hair out of his eyes, he stalked out of the room in anger.
"Maybe- Maybe another day," Draco said quietly. But his voice sounded different this time. Less flat and emotionless, and more honest.
But he knew it was impossible. So, he swallowed hard, looked forward, and with his chest out, he walked outside. He was going to face it that way his father would want him to. Maybe he'd finally be true to his family.
"Ev'n someo'e lik' you should be able to get a f'ckin' job! Hell, a f'cking home! 'S soon as we're done with this, I'mm'a have a word with him."
"It isn't that bad, I mean, he does so much for m-"
But the pictures, they were crowding his mind. Narrow passages suffocating him, a giant, feral dog with bloodied teeth. It was all just too much. He couldn't breathe.
How typical would it be of me to apologise for yet another late chapter?
"Oi Malfoy, you done staring at Harry?"
Ron's face was filled with pity, the sickening type. Harry didn't want Ron's pity. Hermione looked more determined, but her eyes also shone with that sympathy Harry hated.
He really didn't want to go back there and face the boggart. Especially in front of other people. He felt Harry's hand squeeze his own lightly, bringing him back to earth. With a deep breath and a rapidly beating heart, he pushed open the door.
"I tried to," replied Draco, looking down at his feet. "Trust me, I really did. I thought it would go away, but, I mean, it never really did."
"What happened mate?"
Draco looked away from the professor's eyes, and mentally debated with himself.
"Harry, could you do me a favour and tell Draco to meet me during lunch. Next week, same day. You could come too, I suppose, that is, if he's okay with it."
They stormed into the reception, where she handed the tired receptionist a card, and waited for him to dial something, then pass it back.
"So how was detention with
He fumbled for his invisibility cloak, and pulled it over him. He looked from right to left, and spotted Draco's figure marching down the hallways, toward the door. Harry tried to run without making his footsteps too loud, almost tripping over it.
"I hope he finds me," he said in a cold voice. "'Cause when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does,  I'm going to kill him!"
scar.
"No, it's not that," mumbled Harry, breaking off her stare to look at Harry.
Realisation hit him, however, as he realised that his father always got what he wanted. Whether through power and influence, money, magic, or all combined, his father always got his way. Draco knew he'd stop at nothing.
Shit.
Draco followed Lupin, keeping his eyes fixed in a glare towards the back of Harry's head. The laughing and teasing behind him was building up his rage. The professor led them into his office, which was much more exciting than Draco cared to admit.
ever going to need this information later in my life."
Draco walked down to breakfast, still half asleep. He felt professor Lupin's evident stare itch its way into him, as he tried to ignore it, as well as Harry's, though at least Harry was trying to hide it.
Draco felt a cold shiver run down his spine. He'd heard about Sirius through his family, and was altogether very confused about the situation, but Sirius was clearly out for murder, which almost scared Draco. Anyone belonging to the Black family was probably delirious in some way or the other.
"Oh, uh, professor Lupin- wants to meet you- during lunch next week," he stuttered, trying hard not to lick his lips.
An hour or two later, on the other side of the castle, Draco was pacing in Slytherin common room. He'd skipped History of Magic, wanting time to just clear his mind, and rushed up to the common room for some peace and quiet.
Ivy's eyebrows furrowed, and her grey eyes softened. Her eyes met his in an intense gaze. She waved her hand, and a clipboard arrived in front of her. Pulling a pen out of her bun, she bit her lip. "You've been learning occlumency?"
Turning away, he picked out the Marauder's map, and stuffed his other hand in his pockets while turning back to class. It wouldn't hurt to be a little late, so he wandered around, watching Draco's spot lingering near Luna's. Harry tried to put off the twinge of jealousy he felt.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but words were caught at his throat. He didn't want to do this. But he didn't want to keep running as well. "Okay then," he replied in a softer voice than he wanted. "But, uh, Harry?" Harry looked up at him. "Are you going to be there?"
"At first, he said there weren't any positions open, but thankfully he's given me the Defence teacher position this year-"
It was just all too much.
"Don't worry, Draco, you can trust me, I promise, and as for Harry, I'm sure he won't go around blabbering about your boggart, will you Harry?" He cast a glance at Harry, who looked somewhere in between curious and amused."
"Point proven. Unless you think yourself
," he replied, nodding towards Ginny on the Gryffindor table, making Blaise blush and turn away.
Harry's surprisingly warm hands found Draco's cold one's. Their fingers interlocked, making Draco's heart flutter, along with the thousands of butterflies in his stomach. But the best part was the warm feeling that took over his entire body. The light haired boy managed a small smile,
"They did? But isn't that impossible?" Remus looked confused.
"Ivy," Remus breathed.
than me, your majesty-"
The feelings were punched out of him, and suddenly he was numb again. "My taste isn't despicable. Now shove off, or I'll tell Pansy about your crush on
She stood up, and grabbed her bag from behind her chair, putting the pen back in her messy bun. Giving Remus an angry look- though not angry at him- she grabbed his wrist and stormed out of the room with him.
"Just one sec Ron."
"Well, what is it then?" asked a confused Ron. "You've been staring at him the entire breakfast now, mate."
"What the fuck are you doing here?" Draco squinted at the owl's full figure in the almost pitch black. He clumsily grasped for his wand, almost falling off the bed.
"You said you wouldn't tell anyone!"
"I thought you hated me," said Harry, in a soft, low voice.
Tonight was different. Instead of the kind of sadness that twisted his gut and drained him of strength, there was a cold emptiness that settled in his stomach. He couldn't feel. Or, the only thing he could feel was a hollow feeling inside.
"Come on, let's go back," said Harry in a quiet, gentle voice.
"i promise i wont wait so long for the next update, and it'll be a wholesome chapter!!"
"Listen, Hermione, Ron, this- this can't be true. It- it isn't, Draco would've told me! Or- or professor Lupin, right?"
But the words weren't settling properly. They were moving around, swirling in different directions. They weren't stuck in his head, instead pushed away by the growing thoughts that were screaming louder and louder.
But something inside him, deep inside, didn't want it to be like this. Something inside Draco wanted him to run away.
Draco pulled his sleeve up, trying to look away from the growing red stains on his jumper. He felt a warm sort of presence take over as Harry sat down next to him. Butterflies rose in his stomach as Harry's warm hands held Draco's hand, purposefully ignoring the bloodstained sleeve.
"I- I really don't know," Draco said, stuffing his hands into his pockets, as a cold wind blew through the window. "I never really liked herbology."
"Why don't you try and tell me first. I'm sure we can help you, but first, it'd be easier to say it out loud."
Draco muttered "Sacred twenty-eight," before walking in through the heavily sliding doors of the dungeons. He sank onto the sofa, and pulled up his sleeve, looking at the messy array of scars. They all looked slightly faded against his light skin, imperfect in a beautiful way.
"Alright boys, so I thought you two could get some extra practice on the same boggart, since you didn't get to during class," said Lupin, giving Harry a significant look. "Harry, why don't you go first? Remember what you learnt."
Draco heard the laughing of children, and his heart sunk as he looked behind to see a crowd of Slytherins running towards them, ending their conversation, and the solitude. He half wished he could just carry on speaking to her, but pulled himself together.
"Oh- uh- okay, thanks."
"I promise, anything you say will stay within this room if you want, though I'm sure our teachers are more than capable of solving any issues."
(sorry)
"And Lupin's practically obsessed with Harry. Basically did his detention for him, while I had to do it by myself," spat Draco, while unconsciously tugging at the hem of his sleeve.
"Oh, um, okay then. Thanks."
come and save you this time,"
"O- okay professor," startled Harry. With a warm smile, Lupin dashed off in the opposite direction. Harry couldn't help feeling something, maybe nervousness, maybe excitement, at the prospect of meeting Draco again.
Draco looked up, tears burning his eyes, and gave a small but genuine smile. And without thinking, he reached out and hugged Harry. The action surprised him, but as Harry slowly wrapped his hands around Draco, something warm rose up in both of their chests.
He took a deep breath in, and swallowed the urge to throw up, and looking around him, he fell to the bed beneath before brushing a hand through his soaked hair and sweaty forehead. But the rough dent of that scar sickened him.
It suddenly dawned on Draco that professor Lupin had other things to do beside console students, and he was probably intruding. "Sorry, professor, I'll come back later, when you're free."
It was almost a mantra for him now, constantly being repeated in his head. He reached down, under his bed, and grabbed the box. This wooden box was taken out most nights. He reached out for the key under his pillow, and unlocked it. Inside, there were sharp blades. Many that he'd collected over the years.
He actually accidentally caught Harry's eyes at one point, and to his surprise, Harry was staring at him. The thought stayed with him the entire day.
!" she said, a grimace appearing on her face. But there was a little fear in her eyes, that made Draco's heart skip a beat. "Anyways, I have an assignment to finish, so I'll see you in the morning."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Professor, if you don't mind me asking, why did Harry's grandparents take in Sirius Black?"
He could feel his lungs burning again, and his breath becoming more and more rapid, and getting caught in his throat as he tried to speak. His chest was tightening, and he couldn't breathe. This couldn't be happening, not now. The dizziness had started again. From the corner of his blurry vision, he could see Harry staring at him, but he didn't care at the moment.
Ron looked like he'd been punched. He opened his mouth, and closed it again. Then he began stuttering in an almost desperate tone.
"Sorry- I- I didn't hear you two come in."
Harry was sitting, knees drawn to his chest, by the fire. He'd never looked so vulnerable. His eyes were filled with the ghost of fear, and his mouth was slightly parted, as the glassy reflection of flames danced in his iris.
But they both looked back at the demented young man, screaming against chains that were tearing at his skin.
Until everything had become too much. The pictures behind Harry's eyelids made him force them open, as his chest heaved heavily and irregularly. For a second, he didn't know where he was, til the warm colour of the curtains drew him back to the Gryffindor dorms.
Draco felt his heart skip a beat and a cold chill run down his spine, before irritation came over him, and he pulled up the rudest glare he could muster. But he didn't get the satisfaction of an angry professor, but more a look of pity, which further infuriated him.
Fluttering could be heard in the distance, and Draco furrowed his eyebrows, clambering into a sitting position. Stretching over to open the curtain between the bed posters, Draco peered around to find the source of the fluttering noise.
"Did you know Potter's into blokes too?" She asked, as her smirk turned into a grimace. "I mean, his lineage is disgusting in itself, but imagine having to be
want to move?"
So into his bed he sunk, eyes closed with exhaustion, casting the same enchantments he'd been casting since the first night he'd slept here. Looking around the room, he sat up and took out the key and box again.
Draco was taken back by what the girl had said, but couldn't help trusting her. Maybe it was something about her aura, that made him feel comfortable and safe.
Draco felt a knot tie itself up in his chest, as butterflies invaded his stomach. He turned back, touching the warm grasp on his shoulder, and met Harry's deep green eyes. The ones that looked like the dark leaves of the wild.
so my sudden burst of motivation has decided to make this a small, fluffy-ish fic. by the way, who spotted the pansmione?
A ceramic teapot poured warm tea into the teacups in front of both of them. McGonagall placed her wand back in the pockets of her robes, and laid back and twisted a ring on her finger. Her eyes had a knowing glint in them.
"No, but-"
"Fuck, Remus, that's harsh. I'm so sorry, I should've been there for you, not chasing my wild fantasies."
y'know-
And it almost felt like everything would be okay.
Swallowing thickly, Remus turned his eyes to her. She looked the same as before, just a little wilder, and an air of confidence surrounding her. Her black hair was tied up in a messy bun, a green blazer was hanging off her shoulders, and a smart but simple watch on her wrist. Her black shirt clung to her figure, outlining curves that had filled in since he'd last seen her.
so, are we clear? I am not, and never will be, gay.
After I was done dressing, I pondered for a minute, thinking- I couldn’t end it now. It was like a guilty pleasure for him- staring at me, thinking that there would be no consequences… I had to do something.
Now, contrary to what you might believe, this was NOT an ordinary shower. The filthy half-blood starts to masturbate, or- or at least starts doing something very similar, and I have to stand there and bear witness to the moans, the groans… fuck I want to join him in the shower. To be able to look at him! To- to do something- not a blowjob! I don't want to suck anything! Ewww… I don’t want his come on my face- of course not. Why would you think that?? Ughh- gross.
“C-Cum- I-I’m cu-” he stuttered before he came into my hand.
Today, after finishing up with Quidditch training in the morning, I went to take a shower, and lo and behold! Look who was standing there if not mister big arse! I entered the cubicle next to his and saw him staring right at me. I mean… I’m okay with this, he can look at my dick as long as he wants. But he doesn’t even have the common courtesy to ask first!
Draco p.o.v
~~~~~~~
Hey... its been a long time. I'm really sorry for the low upload frequency, and also the short chapters.
“What did you say, bitch?” I raised an eyebrow.
So I tear my gaze away from him and stare at the mirror instead. After several minutes, his lower half, especially one very important organ- is finally covered. He walks towards the exit, but stops abruptly in front of the lockers. Specifically, my Quidditch locker.
So hmm.. I was thinking about all this while drying out the front section of my hair. Not the best idea -I should have just given it a quick dry- when trying to make a speedy escape. Hah. I know. And then- then! The unthinkable happens. He steps out of the shower.
Draco hung his head, and followed. His fists were so tightly nails were piercing into his palm. He strode calmly, watching the wild strands of grass sway in the wind. Something inside him wanted to find that piece of paper, scrunch it up, and burn it. The thought terrified him, but adrenalised him all the same.
"Oh, I'm free now, it's okay. Why don't you have a seat?"
Professor Lupin's voice broke at the end, and he swallowed heavily. Draco picked up on it, and instantly felt guilty for pushing the professor who'd only been kind to him.
Draco looked back up at Harry, who gave him a small, assuring smile. And he turned around to walk away. He could feel Harry's eyes on him, and shrugged his cloak back on. As he left through the large, wooden door, he felt a warm, familiar hand grip his shoulder in the dim light.
Draco hadn't realised the cold sweat that covered his body, the shaking that had taken over him, and the tsunami of tears he was releasing. He violently wiped his cheeks, and waited for his breathing to return to normal.
"Professor, was this friend, by any chance, Sirius Black?"
Then he ran. He ran as fast as he could, so the other two in the room couldn't follow him. He ran into the boy's bathrooms on the third floor. There, he ran toward the mirror, and quickly splashed water on his face, begging himself not to break down. Not here, not now.
"Harry, what happened?"
"But- I- this can't be true! He- he can't go to Durmstrang, not now! Drac- Malfoy, he needs us," Harry was saying frantically, more to himself. "I- he can't leave!"
"I'm honestly so proud," said Remus, sitting down on the chair in front of her desk, and pushing his briefcase aside. "But as much as I'd like to catch up, I need your help."
"He's bloody useless, isn'he?"
Haunted, empty eyes and a sunken face. Sirius's delirious laughter kept flitting in and out of Harry's dreams, which were more gruesome than anything he'd seen alive. He held his pillow tight, and shut his eyes as cold sweat traveled down his cheek.
But his hopes of being alone for a while were shattered as he saw a girl admiring the swirling tentacle of a plant. The top half of her long, wavy, blonde hair was tied into a messy bun, and Draco could see the edge of her tie, which was faded and blue. Her skin was light, almost ethereal and her clothes were slightly loose, hanging off of her body.
Love you so much and please comment.
I mean- no. This is the last time I will see anything of the sort because- because I hate this. If he keeps going- no! I won't let him. I will make a complaint about sexual harassment! What does he think- I’m straighter than a flag pole!
~~~~~~~~~
So- so… I end up sneaking out carefully, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but- ahhh I can't! I dry my hair with a spell, OK? I’m sure you're happy now. I dry one of the eight wonders of the world- with a- with a freaking- s-s-sp-spell. I am forced to dry my hair! With this! Because of Potter and his atrocious actions! I truly hate him now. I won't tell him (although I long to), ‘cause I have to disappear before the twat finishes showering, but if I could- it would totally happen. You are so dead Potter. Sooo dead. ‘Cause if you caused any permanent damage to my hair, I’ll kill you.
Everyone knows that after a run you have to take a shower, right? We also agreed that my beautiful hair won’t survive the twenty minute walk to the cellars of the Slytherin dorm, and the additional number of years that it would take Blaise and his whore to exit the showers. To make matters worse, the Prefects' Bathroom closes at nine, probably because Hogwarts- for now, with its subpar management- is broke. There isn’t any money- they say there is no money! If they wanted to, they surely could find some for the basic day-to-day necessities of the students. Hmm, I seem to have gone off topic again… where were we? Oh. I was explaining the reason why I had to freshen up in the Quidditch showers that positively stink of Potter.
gaygaygaygay.
I love Jean. I love him with all my heart and hair. touch me, Jean. do me as you wish. I am all yours.
I will never be faggot, you know? I'm Malfoy, for god sake. How can anyone, especially those two, can even think about it?
Harry acting like garbage, Draco is amazing.
Draco whined beneath me. “Is that- have we finished?” He squeaked out.
hmm... first of all, its not my nativ language, and I wont ruin your eyes in the actual chapters. so after all the houers its takes me to translate, I ask help from someone with life, and the edit takes time too.
I listen to the metal rattling, not daring to move a muscle, and when the door finally closes behind him- well, then I run.
It worked, kind of. He shrank into himself upon hearing my tone, hastily stood up and started getting dressed as fast as he could move. He didn’t dare talk or even breathe too loudly. After he finished, he tried speaking again. “S-sir?” I think I was calm despite everything you did to me. I was put through a lot of new things today, and yet I still managed to maintain my poise.
He gasped, and his voice shook when he answered me, “Y-Yes sir… it's so- so good, I l-like it” he cried out. I could tell that he wanted more still, but I wasn't here to please this snarky bottom. Absolutely not. I moved my fingers inside him with a punishing pace and pushed them deeper as I heard his continuous moans. “Ahhh… ohhh…” his groans echoed throughout the empty bathroom.
I hate Potter. The idiot, half blooded, sexy, Beautif- Nutella! Nutella with Ferrero, Nutella in a spoon, Nutella! I love Nutella, not Potter.
It was whether Harry was safe. Whether Harry knew. Surely Dumbledore must've told him. Maybe Lupin did. He didn't know, but he sure did hope. Draco also mentally debated whether to tell Harry himself, but in the end, decided that Harry wouldn't want to hear this, especially not coming from him.
"Good."
And the sadness was taking over in waves. Pushing him in and out, not allowing him to breathe. He wanted to push just a little harder, so it could all end. So he didn't have to think about the day, about his father, about how everything would turn out.
He still felt the last fibers of their relationship holding them together.
Draco was walking down the corridors, straight to professor Lupin's office, though every inch of his body was begging him not to do it. His heavy steps echoed along the corridors, blurring out the quieter steps of a certain Gryffindor who was walking straight toward him.
The moment seemed stretched out. Like every second was a million years. And in the moment, Draco and Harry lived for each second. Draco leaned against Harry's back, and pulled his knees close to his chest.
"Yeah."
The noise in his head was too much. He wanted to scream, to cry, to shout, but at the same, just wanted it all to stop. He squeezed his eyes shut, and walked towards the doors, feeling the cold rush of wind blowing his hair back and screaming in his ears.
?" she asked, almost spitting out the name.
He threw away the book and sighed in frustration. Taking a deep breath in, he closed his eyes and let himself fall. Fall deeper and deeper into the ocean of thoughts threatening to drown him.
Draco chewed at the inside of his mouth, as thoughts devoured his mind.
"Wicked," he exclaimed. "Dragon tooth parchment. Dad says it's bloody expensive, almost seventy galleons a foot. Charlie reckons it should be banned. But then again, he wants the law on trading dragons to be lifted."
Harry tried to hold Draco's left hand, but he flinched away, stuffing it in the pocket of his cloak. The fuzzy, high balloon inside of him burst, and reality came rushing back at him as harshly as the strong winds blowing the hair into his stinging eyes.
Draco suddenly sat up in his bed, his heart in his throat beating rapidly. It was another nightmare, thank Merlin, he was still at Hogwarts, far away from his father. He violently wiped away the tears on his face, feeling guilty at being so weak.
Draco Malfoy could say that the warm feeling in his heart never really disappeared after that night. It was a night he didn't forget.
As they finally broke apart from the embrace, Draco's heart melted just a little at the sight of tears in Harry's eyes. Harry quickly wiped his eyes, and Draco could tell he was avoiding the his gaze.
"Whatever you say," he said, turning to get more bread.
He adjusted his tie, and took a deep breath, before making his way to breakfast, only to firmly avoid Harry's gaze.
Draco pushed past the usual group of Slytherins, who were huddling over a newspaper, and squeezed his way to the middle of the group. He almost jerked back at the sight of the man in the picture. Something about him was recognisable, maybe his sunken eyes which were screaming as much as he was. It hit him, Sirius Black, spotted near Hogsmeade.
Halfway through dressing, he turns his head and looks. Looks straight at me with those piercing green eyes! I glare right back at him, unexpectedly frozen in the moment! What else could I do? What do people do when an insolent arsehole like Potter looks at them like this? Look away! Yes, I will look away. That is exactly what normal people would do. Look. Away.
“You seem well bred…” I smirked, looking down at him, seeing a blush spread across his face. “Turn around, loser.” I ordered after some time. He turned around on all fours and lifted his ass, putting on a show for me just like in a porno. “You know just what to do, my good boy.” I muttered to myself, staring longingly at his round, plump arse. So, I ended up slapping his right cheek. Hard. The color red bloomed across his skin for a split second before it turned back to its regular pale tone, with only a hint of pink left behind. That was when I decided to mark all of him up, so that his arse would be a beautiful shade of red when I was done with him. He will be owned, he will be mine.
“Now, there are two rules that I expect you to remember by heart. One, you must call me sir at all times.” I’m aware that it's not the best word, but… he needs to know that he is now owned. That he is completely and totally mine. “And secondly, if you ever need to stop, your safe word will be… Snape.” Yeah, Snape will totally… snap me out of my reverie. Just thinking about him- ugh no! I’m stopping now! Gross. Fuck. Where was I? “Don't say it unless you absolutely can't take it anymore,” I added. “That’s all, understand bitch??” I affirmed after a long pause, causing him to jump up in panic.
Hmm…. I was pondering on what to write across his locker. Malfoy is a big bottom. Or should I use whore instead? What should I write, what should I write..? Finally, I settled on this- “Malfoy is a horny bottom”. That was good… and he probably doesn't know how to clean his locker considering the fact that he’s spent his whole life leaving people to clean up after himself, so maybe more people will get to see this. I really like making him suffer.
-hmm… Blaze? and Pansy? and my- is that my diary?? what are you doing with my diary??
“Get out.” I said quietly.
I became more and more aggressive, until I was thrusting as fast as I could. He moaned and whimpered under me, so delicate- so needy. I reached around and grabbed ahold of his dick as I started pumping it to the speed of my thrusts. I could feel his dick pulsing and heard his heart beating loudly as I felt the pre-cum flowing through my fingers. In that moment, I knew he was mine.
“I’ll talk to you, and I will use you in the future, but right this very minute, you have to leave.” I didn’t look at him, scared that I would feel the turbulence of emotions currently storming my gut. I just stared at the tiled bathroom floor while I waited for him to exit. Seconds later, I noticed out of the corner of my eyes that his usual slow, choppy movements had suddenly turned faster. He started taking in quick, shallow breaths, like he was on the verge of having a panic attack, and when he finally pulled open the bathroom door, I could tell that he was actually crying.
Usually I’m able to stay relatively calm. I really am! But today “His Majesty” decided to unceremoniously drop his towel. In front of me. Hmm… what should I call it? The shriveled cucumber? The wobbly sausage? The disastrous dick! His huge dick was revealed to me, and all I wanted was- I wanted nothing. I want nothing. You think you know, but this is all just a big misunderstanding. I don't want to suck it at all, nor to be plowed from behind with it, and I certainly won’t remember this moment while I secretly masturbate to its image in my head-
I started to dress up really slowly. I didn't actually put on any underwear until much later. His eyes immediately dropped to my big dick, staring at it for a long time... After a couple more minutes, I looked him dead in the eye and held his gaze for almost… ten seconds, until he lifted his head to look back at me with terrified eyes... A few seconds later, he completely turned away, like the scared chicken he was, pffftt.
A figure- professor Lupin- had appeared in front of him, and Draco saw the creature violently shapeshifting, and saw a giant, glowing orb, which resembled the full moon, before it was hurled back into the closet.
"None of your business," muttered Draco darkly.
Draco looked around. The room was empty, and he really had nothing to lose. "Yeah, who are you?" His voice sounded less harsh than normal.
For just a split second, time stilled. All his fears dropped dead.
Harry's voice was fiercer than ever, and his eyes were filled with hatred and rage. Ron took a step back, as the silence took over again. The cold air stood still, freezing the moment. Harry was going to kill him.
But the tears eventually made a show. The
lawyer-"
And despite himself, Draco found himself shaking his head.
(i hate the fact that drafts aren't automatically saved 'cause i'm a failure at responsibility)
Professor Lupin's calm demeanor dropped, and a shocked face appeared. No, less shocked, more... stern? Draco couldn't place it, and that worried him.
Lupin waved his wand, bringing two chairs in front of his desk, where Draco and Harry slowly sat down. Harry's looked towards the professor, while Draco kept his eyes fixed on the table.
"Yes, really. They were a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, so you'd know how horrible they were. He'd come back from the Holidays with scars left by dark magic."
And Draco didn't know how long he stayed there looking at the stars, watching them sparkle in the deep sky. He didn't know how long he stayed there, because it was all a blur before the wake of dawn was rising. Til the stars drowned in the rising sun.
"I got bitten by one, so I'm not a big fan of them."
"Professor Flitwick? Could I use the bathroom?"
sorry sorry i've been travelling... agh and sorry for the crappy short chapter things'll start moving along in later chapters.
The owl stared at Draco dumbly, tilting its head. Draco's eyes caught onto the letter.
"I had a friend in a very similar situation," Lupin said, and a faint smile appeared with the memory. "He was- um- not their perfect son, shall we say. His parents tried to force their traditions and bigotry on him. He was kind of, let's say, the Black sheep of the family," said Lupin with a little chuckle.
Dark circles became more prominent, not that they weren't always, and his frayed sleeves remained lower than ever. And though Remus knew he should report this to Snape, he had a feeling that would only mess things up further.
"Stupid, weak, queer. A pathetic son, you are," The boggart-Lucius's hand got a tight hold grip on Draco's pale arms. Uncovering Draco's sleeve, revealing the many scars, shining brightly against the pale skin. The boggart yelled "What are these? Why can't you pull yourself together? Disgraceful. I will not have my son-"
"Malfoy? I'd have assumed you weren't the type to impulsively run away," droned Snape, dragging his words out. "As it is," he paused "I am the head of your house. Any of your concerns are to be handled by
He wasn't okay. He wasn't. He found out way too much, and wished he could forget everything he'd heard. It was too much, he didn't want to know.
"Aren't you Draco Malfoy?" she asked, walking towards him.
may accept such views, but here in Hogwarts, we don't," he finished.

The hours turned into days, as the lessons moved in a blur, each barely blurring off into the next one. As the week passed, Draco's thoughts sunk further and further to places they shouldn't, and a certain professor couldn't help noticing the growing changes in the Slytherin boy.
And then, the new professor of Defense against the Dark arts, professor Lupin, ran in, obviously surprised at all the commotion. His face fell when he saw Harry and Draco fighting.
"Yes, well, I generally find you to be very distracting," said Draco in a flat voice. He didn't remember allowing those words to escape from his mouth, but it was worth seeing Harry blush.
He wanted so badly to tell professor Lupin, but he knew it'd be impossible. On the other hand, a fresh start at a new school could be just what he needed to get his mind straightened out.
"Really 'mione, if this is just-"
Lupin looked up at Draco with a shocked, almost worried face. His eyes gave everything away, but he stuttered a small "I-n- no- no."
"Professor, I know what it looks like, but I- I was provoked," Harry started. "Malfoy made a really rude-" but Harry was cut off by Lupin, who said in a now much calmer voice "I understand that the circumstances were unfair to you Harry, but nothing could justify having a fully blown duel in the corridors,"
Remus pushed open the door, and embraced the warmth of the cosy office. The books were all lined up messily in shelves, Remus recognised them, having borrowed most of them from her. The warm brown walls complemented the leather seat she was sitting in.
"What happened? I've noticed that you were upset the past few days, and I hoped I could, maybe, help you," said Lupin.
"You di'n't ask old Dumbledore for a job 'r something?"
The boggart drifted in and out of his dreams, as he could picture it happening in front of everyone. Until it was too much, and he'd woken up at early morning in cold sweats. He started charming his forearms, so they were no longer littered with ragged tears, hoping that yesterday's detention would be forgotten.
Draco bit his lip. He sounded wary and sceptical. "Are you sure you can help?"
Draco looked up in surprise, and smiled a little to himself.
Images of family reunions, filled with foreign faces, his father, that carved cane, with the patterns. He shook his head, hoping the memories would fall from his mind's gallery. Draco Malfoy, firstborn and only child of the Malfoys. He couldn't live up to it.
But something didn't feel right, and he realised what it was when he looked behind him.
thing to do. And Harry's words, egging him on.
Harry was standing at the door entrance looking confused. The sentiment in his voice touched Draco, but the panic as Harry slowly neared made him sick, and twisted his gut with something similar to guilt.
Draco waved his wand, and muttered the phrase, and watched as small birds appeared from his wand, and travelled around professor Flitwick. He gave a small chuckle, and waved his hand, motioning for Draco to leave.
Peeling open the letter, Draco took a deep breath. His wand was on the bed, and the light was shining in front of him. Illuminated words were scrawled messily on the parchment, which was a little torn.
"However," he added, looking at Draco, whose angry gaze was still fixed on the table, "I cannot tolerate any form of crude language or remarks, Draco. I understand, that your
"Speaking of friends, have you seen that Granger girl? Seems to think she's amazing, always with that bushy hair of hers, buttons all done up, always trimmed nails..." she trailed off as she realised Draco was looking at her suspiciously.
This was his secret. This was how he was able to live with being the horrible person he was. This was how he was able to live with all the secrets and memories. This was his coping method, the only thing that kept him alive. And thank Merlin, no one knew about it. At least, not yet.
"No, it really wasn't. Everyone knew about our friendship. It just- some days I just can't believe what he did."
He'd go meet professor Lupin. Show him that there was nothing to be scared of. Perhaps get his father to interfere. And it'd all be over.
And for a second he forgot everything. For a second it was fine. Until it wasn't.
But as Remus turned through the newspapers, watching Sirius's dead eyes staring menacingly back at him, he could barely recognise the man who soothed him after his nightmares, and bought hot chocolate after the full moons.
?" he asked, slightly desperate. "I swear, I'll do anything else, just not this, not in front of you and him,"
He slowly picked the letter, nervousness buzzing inside of him. He couldn't help thinking that the owl must've gotten lost, though there was no way any owl as smart as this one wouldn't have recognised the glaringly Slytherin dorms.
As they reached the top, both of them felt very out of breath. The cold air was rushing against their faces, and Harry's hair was flying wildly, but in the perfect way. The moonlight let a certain glow cover them, making the night truly difficult.
"Well, at least we won't see Malfoy anymore. Phew," said Ron in a relieved voice.
The only packages he'd ever gotten was for money and birthday gifts. Apparently, his father was too busy to write letters, as was his mother. Which was why he always felt a pang of jealousy as he'd unconsciously turn around to look at Harry receiving letters, all three of them laughing and smiling over what they'd gotten.
She was beautiful, but not in a conventional way. Something about her features were mysterious, almost hypnotic. Intense eyes, sharp, small lips that were almost pale, and cheekbones that Remus remembered used to be too prominent due to hunger.
He knew what he was going to do. He knew now. There was no going back. He bit his lip harshly, til he tasted blood and tears pricked at his eyes. It was too painful. He was going to kill the man who'd killed all happiness for his family.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He- hey, hey where're you taking me?"
Draco's eyes were tired and sore after being rubbed so harshly so many times. The flickering fire in the torches may have warmed him up just a little, but he still shivered at the thoughts raging inside his mind.
Harry's eyes grew wide in shock as Hermione's words sunk in. The letter was shaking with his hands, and a cold wind seemed to travel down his spine, despite the crackling fire and closed windows.
my dishonest ass. but hey, long-ish chapter:)
"If you say so," muttered Draco, more interested in the symbols on the girl's earrings.
He was confused. “S-sir?”
Instead, I pulled the shower curtain around me and started showering, with him still in the cubicle on my right. I couldn't resist teasing him and started moaning, and occasionally sighing, letting the idiot’s imagination run wild with the dirty things that I could possibly be doing. I heard his sharp intake of breath and a nasty grin crept onto my face at the thought of getting under his skin. What a bratty bottom. I continued my mundane shower until- shit. My dick started getting hard. Because of him! The nasty loser… so what option did I have? To actually masturbate - next to him - I couldn't do it. I'm straight, which straight would even think of masturbating to thoughts of that filthy Malfoy? But- in this situation- thinking of his big, fat, round arse- I just decided to go ahead and do it. So I ended up masturbating. To depraved thoughts of Malfoy, in a doggystyle position, all spread out for me to use like the freaking bitch he is.
He couldn't wrap his head around it. Harry wanted to rip up the paper, wanted to throw it into the fire. Really, he just wanted it destroyed, he wanted the fact to cease from existing. Because no matter how many times he read the letter, the news wouldn't sink in.
"What even- keep your hair on. Seriously, what'd you do?" asked Blaise, who had joined in the conversation, much to Draco's displeasure.
"Sorry- I just- we have to tell professor Dumbledore, or at least professor McGonagall," said Lupin.
"Don't you like magical plants? They can be really fascinating. Like the mandrake pants, that helped everyone when I was in first year."
The next few days passed by in a blur. Draco could hardly recall when he was supposed to meet Lupin, but at this point, he didn't care. The only thing he could focus on was Harry. Only Harry was on his mind.
And Merlin, he was terrified.
thing to do would be-"
"I know, it get's annoying," she replied, her face relaxing.
"So how was detention? What'd you have to do?" asked Crabbe, slightly in admiration.
Huddling students were grouped up everywhere, and the Gryffindor table was in frenzy, with everyone talking rapidly among themselves. All the noise and muttering was much louder than usual, and even the teachers were mostly absent, Filch trying to keep order.
The paper slipped from his cold shaky fingers. Every breath he took in wasn't enough, and was freezing his lungs. Thoughts were rushing through his mind, piercing through his brain at lightning speed. He couldn't take it. Words were flashing through his mind, blinding him.
with him. But he could hear his father's words in his head, telling him that it was a
"Do you want to talk about it?" asked Harry. His voice was soft and deep, yet there was something about it that felt like a shoulder to lean on.
The charms were cast over Draco again, just like his father taught him to. He had to look perfect; no dark circles, no bruises, no scars, not even a scratch. He looked at his reflection in the mirror. It was so... perfect, yet, it still seemed repulsive. Like something not to be touched. Something fragile inside, but made of stone.
No amount of pain could erase this feeling away. He wanted to scream, cry, shout, but he couldn't. It felt like something was holding him back, pulling him hard to keep him from escaping, well, whatever this was.
"S- Sorry. You seemed angry," he replied in a flat voice, looking down.
"Harry," snapped Hermione. "Are you even listening to me?!"
He was shaking, and feelings were hitting him harsher than any cane could. And every inch of him was screaming for escape from this torture. As his mind became fuzzier, he eventually drifted off into fitful sleep.
"Harry- Harry's not- he's not- like
But the euphoria was shattered by a deep voice calling his name, and as Draco jerked his head to see, a dark figure in long robes slowly approached him.
Harry smirked. "Yes. Unless, of course, my presence bothers you."
But what if this was his chance to escape from the Sacred 28's traditions? The whole marrying and producing able children, following the dark lord, securing a tight spot in the ministry? Honestly, Draco didn't know if he wanted to escape it.
"Talking of him, he's staring at you right now," said Blaise, sounding confused, turning towards the teacher's table.
"Not much of a surprise," muttered Hermione darkly. She showed letter to Ron, and pointed her finger at the elaborate signature of Lucius Malfoy, with the Malfoy emblem seal stamped right below.
he thought to himself.
"Well get lost then. I'm not your entertainment system, am I?!"
He felt the blade carve down deeper and deeper, until the pain had completely taken over, and he could nothing else. The cuts stung, and it felt like a cold wind was blowing over him, as he was shaking with sobs, and felt so, so exposed.
For just a split second, he felt free.
i have no words.
want to move?"
She picked up the paper carefully, almost like she was scared it'd tear with her touch, and her eyes scanned the letter and lit up in shock. Ron look curious, his hands darting to the sharp edge of the parchment.
"He was their friend, and he betrayed them," he mumbled, more to himself. But he screamed to the forest, to the still air around.
The anger had spiked up again, and he took a deep, cold breath, before getting to the greenhouses for herbology. It wasn't a long walk, but his muscles were nevertheless burning when he'd reached, and he just wanted to go back to bed.
Harry was broken out of his stream of thoughts, and turned to an angry Hermione, with a glint of concern in her eyes. He couldn't stop thinking about Draco, and watching the Slytherin seemed to assure him.
Draco had no idea why this memory had struck him now. But it terrified him. His family knew about it. Sirius Black, heir to the Noble and Most Ancient house of Black. There was no way Harry was going to survive. Not if the secrets Draco heard about the family's involvement in dark magic and illegal curses were true.
He eyed the letter in her hand, and turned his body to face the two. Hermione looked worried, while Ron looked out of place, eyes darting between Hermione and Harry. His hand reached for it, and took it away from Hermione's tight grasp.
"What?!"
So as the blur of days passed, Draco found himself growing more and more worried. And more and more guilty. Because he knew this piece of information. Dumbledore must've known, and he definitely wasn't the only one.
"What else could I do?" Remus shrugged. "They're always out to torture people- well, you know, werewolves, aren't they? Especially with my memories."
finally! it took me time...
have a good night, or morning, or something between, and I love you. please comment.
prolog
smut. only smut.
“Are you ready?” I demanded, and saw him nod quickly. I held my dick in my hand and lubricated it from the excess spit on my hand before slowly pushing it in Malfoy’s arse. He moaned and gasped at the sensation of my cock splitting him open. I didn’t want to hear his petty whines so I told him to shut up, which he did. I was thinking of trying this with other people, but in a flash I realized that it would be a waste of orgasm. Only Malfoy’s body- I am almost sure of- is the best.
I packed my books and pencil case along with my quill as fast as I could, slung my bag over my shoulder and ran at top speed to the showers. Now, where was this fool, I thought to myself as I glanced around the sinks. Aha, there he was. With his hands buried in the front of his pants, I could tell that his body language was blatantly mortified, but equally excited at the same time.
I stay a couple more moments under the water, thinking about what he might be doing now… the clothes that he must be taking off (Full Disclosure- He doesn’t bother to wear a shirt- I mean… during training. He just- flies. Bare-chested. In the crispy, possibly freezing, night sky. Without a shirt. Just out there revealing his body. His honey gold, tan, chiseled body. And I like it. Because of its colour. Purely because of the honey gold.)
So I left him there, with my first… “gift” for today. I exited the locker room, smirking to myself, and continued on with the rest of my day. On to my first class of the day, which so happened to be Defense Against the Dark Arts- pshhh like I even need to learn this, come on! DADA? Seriously? Like... didn't I save the magical world 3 times ALREADY? And judging by the way things are going, I’ll probably save it again before the school year ends. Oh joy, and then there was Potions. A lesson just brimming with fun and enjoyment! Yay me. Another class with filthy Malfoy, no doubt. But no, today will be fun. Because today is the day where I absolutely freak Malfoy out.
When most of the players arrive after practice, I'm already halfway through washing my hair, and because their sanitary is practically non-existent, they only change to a…. set of cleaner robes before disappearing. Another 7 minutes and 34 seconds pass by before... Finally! Their Captain, the most Gryffindor embodiment of them all, the outstanding athlete, the sex- NUTELLA NUTELLA NUTELLA!! POTAHH! This boy casually strolls in, after making sure that all the equipment is safely stored away.
The lesson began with a roll call. Snape, as usual, made a snide remark at me and praised the great bottom, all in one breath. How fun. Then, this shithole in the disguise of a man started writing down instructions on how to concoct a Swelling Solution on the board, but no. Instead of putting up with this mundane nonsense, I tore a piece of parchment and hastily scribbled down a note to my bitch that said- 'After class. Gryffindor's bathroom. Come alone.’ and slyly turned around, dropping it on his desk while making sure that no one else noticed. I grinned mischievously at him before turning back, knowing that this was gonna be great.
