Merlin, she still hated that creep. And obviously, with good reason, it's November, who leaves a child outside in November, especially one that's mobile. Honestly. It's not like we're in England and he spends most of his time in Scottish mountain ranges or anything.
Harry and Ron say it’s just what happens after saving the day, and it’s best not to question it. Harry and I don’t talk about the barriers put on him by Dumbledore, nor that they were broken by the currently comatose Severus Snape, nor do we bring up my father locking away my creature instincts this summer.
Lily is standing fierce and tall, too magically drained after putting up the blood wards to keep her sister and her sister's family safe to apparate on her own, she is luckily caught by a stunner shot through her window as Severus watches the Dark Lord point his wand towards a crib, Severus shoots a curse through the window towards that same spot, a curse that even in death Tom Marvolo Riddle Junior cannot possibly escape.
He can tell The Dark Lord of where he found Regulus, or he can let James and Lily and his barely two-year-old baby girl die.
Also also, I'm considering writing out the full background for Severus having been friends with the mauraders and Lily, but IDK yet, maybe, it's hinted at here though, and technically I've already started it.
Well, Aria seems well informed. Then again Regulus is quite certain the Stars are some sort of time reader, though how she knew about the transfiguration books is beyond him.
"Sorry, I'm late twins, I'd gotten held up at the office." That was a lie, Jared had been by three hours earlier, only to discover he was fifteen minutes late, and the twins weren't here. It's not that he didn't realize he was late, it's just that time was weird for him most often.
Harry’s tongue plunged further inside, brushing and playing at the edge of Draco’s internal pleasure center, and the blond had no choice but to give in.
He glanced down at her hand for a moment, then back up at her face, his eyes glinting a little in a way that made her stomach somersault. “I’ll have another summer ale. Thanks.”
The applause ended, finally, and people were invited to come take a closer look at the memorial. Harry made his way over to his friends, the adrenalin from giving the speech having subsided. Hermione immediately gave him a hug and whispered, “Great job, Harry.” All of the Weasley brothers gave him praise and claps on the back. But it wasn’t until Draco embraced him that he finally let himself relax.
“And I’d want to dig into her social life. Not the superficial, housewife stuff the Aurors had already looked at. I’d look into old connections, anything seedy. I’d check her datebook, see if there were any times where she wasn’t where she claimed to be. If she did have a lover I’d want to find out where they met up and how often, and what excuses she made to keep it from her husband.”
“You can play with my cock you know,” the brunet said with a lazy smile. “Hands, mouth, whatever you like. Do it as you breach me. It will help me relax.”
Harry needed no further prompting, working on the belt with shaking hands and making quick work of the zipper. He plunged his hand past Malfoy’s underwear without preamble, thrilled at the sizeable erection he found waiting there. His fingers wrapped around it gently and Malfoy – Draco – whimpered seductively.
“I have to believe it,” said Draco fiercely. “If I don’t, then I can’t be brave enough to love you as completely and inexorably as I do. I have to believe that we are stronger than anything, and that no one that enters our lives can ever replace me in your heart. Because otherwise I will run for my life and never let myself feel anything ever again.”
Meanwhile, Harrison James Potter was in the bathroom, changing into an outfit hidden in a plastic zipper bag on the back of the toilet for him by Piers' fourteen-year-old brother, who had lost a bet about how far Hylo could throw. He would miss games of tag with Dudley's gang, being able to use his and Hylo's cunning and intelligence on them. It was quite fun most days as no-one had been able to catch them for very long yet.
. Comes in handy when your uncle tries to sneak in a strapping young man's rooms too," Blaise said as he pulled Theo in close as he drank and spoke, "Mother gave me this to share with my closest friends so that I can have blackmail on them if necessary, and yet I am telling them that I was created with a ritual between her and my other mother. Irony."
In other news, he also invented a potion that day. And the towers were shooting the bad luck concoction on all the unsuspecting Death Eaters. Fred and George are brilliant.
He climbs the stairs and stares at the cursed wraith form as he reneverates Lily, maintains eye contact as he hands her a potion to feed to the child, and finally when The Dark Lords mind is so brutally wrecked he banishes him to frigid Albanian mountains where he knows Voldemort will suffer, greatly, and for an extended amount of time.
Upon waking Harry quickly got dressed and made breakfast for three, pulling the tea kettle off the stove just as Hydrangea and Hermione stumbled down the stairs and into the trunk, breakfast was quickly had and Hermione called her parents to tell them she wanted to go back to the library while Hydrangea showered.
It wasn't until the twins were about five that things started taking turn for the worst, she'd finally found a way to apply for the twins legal guardian, but when Vernon, her
"Please stand back Heir Malfoy." Draco was shocked out of his staring contest and when he looked back Harry's eyes were closed, so he stood back, near the edges of the room as the goblin began the ritual. 'Please let this work.'
"Alright, but be careful! This isn't Surrey Hydrangea!" She walked away saying "I know I know," under her breath but Harry knew his twin fairly well enough.
Harry and Hylo are finally safe,  sound, and asleep in their beds at hotel Blue Megaro, fun fact it's a real place,  as are all the places mentioned! I  just thought that'd be cool.
You have no idea how mad I was three months ago when I completely fucking erased this goddamned chapter, but it's okay because after a lot of painstaking effort I finally got this thing updated, and boy am I proud of this one, though I do wish to point out that I know it's unrealistic, but trust me I have a good plotty reason for why the twins had such ease getting jobs, and hotels, and whatnot, don't worry we'll get there soon.
Still, a part of her wonders if it'll be enough, for all that she hadn't meant to hurt them, she feels responsible for keeping Ver-That Man around. She hopes Lily forgives her, hopes the twins never do, she didn't mean to do this to them, but she did, so, consequences and all that.
She nodded, "You were just trying to help. I'm Hermione by the way." Then after barely a moment "So, how does that trunk work?"
"I don't want to be on this side of the war," Draco said as he passed the bottle to Pansy. "We're losing, and it's stupid anyway."
"I don't know, you never really felt malicious. Except for that one time, when 'Mione punched you, that was an odd day all around. Besides, I'm well aware he summoned Sirius from the mirror Malfoy, and it wasn't one of us." Draco nodded at the answer, he remembered that day, he'd brewed a potion the exact opposite of Liquid Luck with Severus that morning.
He also knew that these two would prefer the freedom they'd been given by their aunt to anything else. Most of those sorts of kids did. It was simply easier to grant them the allusions of freedom then to let them see what true freedom actually is. The twins thought about it, looking into each other's eyes and having a conversation via
'I know just the one, and I'll leave him a lolly for helping us too, I'll hide it under his pillow.' Dudley had been helping them for years now, ever since they started school, and Dudley got picked on for being overweight, whilst they were, thankfully, quite invisible.
"Kurama, I think it's yours. I read it in a book." Hydrangea nods after she says as much. Well, who can argue with that logic the man thinks to himself sardonically, yet he keeps watching. The Potter twins are something worth watching if these are the familiars they choose.
. For when we don't leave for extended periods of time." His sister only nodded and continued eating.
Petunia had been so happy and hopeful when she'd pocketed the card she was beaming when she got home, but upon seeing the twins putting dinner on the table whatever semblance of happiness she'd felt quickly faded away.
Honestly, they'd only put them there to keep away strangers, but they'd have moved them if necessary, they're not that cruel.
, yelled at Harry. Personally, Harry thought the insult could use a little work seeing as it wasn't 1956 and Dudley could've done better. And had done better come to think of it.
When Harry stopped under the waterfall he felt tired, so bone tired, it was like the adrenaline that had been ushing him before had drained from him.
He did have to agree, the last two certainly looked best. "They're both okay really, but I think we should go with the apartment one, it'll make more sense if we stay there at the
In the end, this would, perhaps, be the biggest mistake Voldemort made, not that he'd realize it any time soon of course.
He, Peter, has a theory, though no proof, that the reason Lily and Severus truly weren't friends is because old men are far too meddlesome. He's quite certain Severus, at least, should've been in Ravenclaw.
It does surprise him though, that he’s being given a choice, to be given a chance to do what he, in proper hindsight, really should have done ages ago.
For the past four years, Petunia has searched high and low for what she calls chameleon gifts around the twin's birthday when they were six she bought two books of fairy tales and pretended she'd got them for Dudley, who had always been wonderful about sharing. When they were seven she took them each to choose a tea mix from a specialty shop, at eight she bought them bubble bath that smelled like carrot cake and gingerbread respectively and matching bath bombs, last year she bought them an art set that's hidden in the attic unless Vernon is gone. It is the first time since they were five that she'd bought them something different from the other more easily explained gifts.
"Harry hurry up! I'm going to go down the alley and see if I can find anything." The twins had long since learned treasure could be found in the right alleyway, one only had to Look.
"Hey, weren't you looking for that girl with the bushy hair? Cause she just ran in that antique shop." Harry said as the other boy barreled past him knocking him down, Hylo helped him up and silently glared at the boy and if he has a rather unlucky day for the rest of the day, well, it's not like Hydrangea or Harry could've done it, don't be preposterous!
Lily Potter may be crying watching this. James Potter certainly is. Bittersweet sweet happenings and all. They did hope the twins would have an easier time of it, but these moments are always nice to see, even if it'd be better with Tunie with them.
It took another thirty minutes, and more incriminating evidence, before she decided she'd had enough.
Twenty minutes later the twins are sleeping on a train to London with their trunks loaded up by Terry, who hadn't necessarily been the smartest of people growing up, and, though they did not yet know it, all would be well soon enough.
At least, until one day, the Head of The Surrey Wives Committee brought her son, Jared, and introduced him to Tuney, who told her about his latest updates in his Runaway Charity Organisation, ROCKET, a place to subtly look after runaway children who were safer away from their families, he'd introduced it recently and so far people were pretty confident that it could help the runaway children, as well as the foster children.
When they arrived in the Room it was nearly empty, and there was a waterfall. "Come on Harry this way." Malfoy pulled the shocked Harry to the waterfall careful not to get wet.
Lily Jasmine Evans 'nee Potter has gotten and subsequently been putting her masters in Charms to use, some say she's been seen with the unspeakables but seeing as we have enchantments in their cloaks to keep you from ever ascertainging their identities this author highly doubts the credentials of those informants. (Seen pictured a tall woman with straw blonde hair, a long neck, and too narrow face)
After an hour or two of staring through the TV screen he stumbles up to bed, again tripping on that damned board, and into bed. A moment later his door opens and two little bodies climb into his bed on either side and curl against him, they fall asleep rather instantly, the way children tend to, and their softness lures him to sleep as well.
As always I will list any triggers present at the beginning of the chapter, and warn you where they are as well. You can find a basic description of what happened in the endnotes.
10. The first time Draco uses Harry’s wand without thinking about it they don’t notice until he’s giving Harry his wand back. (And isn’t that familiar.)
21. “Potter! That’s why we can use each other's wands!! Because our magic is nearly the same!” Draco exclaimed, happy to finally put that mystery at ease.
Petunia stopped listening and thought of the renovations she'd had done to the house while they'd all been gone. Pregnancy it seemed was a great way to inspire her spiteful side. She hoped they'd finished and changed the locks as she'd asked. She idly signaled for more pomegranate cider, it was really good, and the waiter brought it as well as a basket of bread and their signature sauce dish which included a lovely cheese sauce, a chocolate sauce, a tomato sauce, a spinach dip, and ranch. They each tasted rather amazing and she idly wondered if her David would be making stuff like this in his future. She hoped so, it was rather good.
Hydrangea quickly flipped through the recipe book looking for something easy, and yummy. Harry pointed out the coconut chicken curry sounded fine in the curry section of the cookbook they'd been lucky to find and decided on making, but Hylo kept going looking for what felt right.
Perhaps though this is what will surprise you, his mother, Narcissa Malfoy has broken a vow, and unless that creature that is… ‘Still ranting oh Morgana and Merlin dangling their bits in the mid-fall rain!’ unless
"Hello Jared, please come in," Hydrangea said as Harry was finishing putting away the shoes Hermione had left.
"Dinners on the table, go wash up Davey darling, I'm serving it up just now." She said with her plastic smile so to speak in place, Petunia had long since learned that smiling was the best option when conversing with Vernon.
If Petunia noticed the rather, unsubtle, children and found a suspicious amount of money hidden inside? Well, that is between her and the ladybugs flying about. And if she decides to start teaching her sister's twins the food of their assumed culture so that they may know at least a small part of themselves, well. It's not as though her husband was intelligent enough to figure it out.
15. Most purebloods have ancestral magic, while most Muggleborns have new magic. No one thought to test half-bloods before.
22. “That explains so much honestly. Do you think it means anything though?” Harry asked, seemingly not caring much about it
4. I also believe that after the war there would be PLENTY of attacks in the eighth year, and not just on the golden, and silver trios either.
Hydrangea nodded as she had to admit, it was a bit heavy and went into the store while her brother put the stuff in the trunk they'd shrunk and brought with them. Harry was quickly dropping the things in front of the stairs, and putting the freezer and dairy products away.
Besides, it's not like she destitute or anything, she can afford all this what with That Man's, extracurricular activities and the admittedly high profits they had.
Ms. Morell, a curvy blonde woman is very aware of what happens at the Dursley-Potter residence and has decided, after trying several times, to say screw the system I'll teach these two a few tricks to get past the world of adults, and bureaucrats. Subtly of course.
I have Zero (0) idea where this was going, but I've edited it (a little) and am presenting you with the stuff that's a step above garbage in my forgotten folders
"Mister Snape finally acknowledged our summons I see." The goblin across from him says, his name is Roknarolde, and he's as angry as the rest of them, perhaps more so.
Harry isn’t as surprised as he should be when he notices Draco, as a matter of fact when Draco shouts his name it seems he already knows the plan.
As the twins and him, eat the healer who had brought the food casts some spells and tells him he'll be clear to leave tomorrow, and that they've contacted his grandmother.
After another Twin-Telepathy conversation, Harry spoke up. "No tricks?" The man was shocked, though, as a Slytherin, he mostly didn't show it, they had the money; though he didn't mind, he really does not like this place. Besides they'd probably use it as a play-house when they got home anyway 'Rich kids probably. If their clothes are anything to go by' "Not a one, though I'll need you to hover your hand over the lock when we go out."
"Hey there, are you okay?" The girl asks, the boy sits and pulls his sister down with him when the fox growls and the fox seems, shocked, wary, which is unsurprising given the species, the observer thinks, but still.
Lol, heeeyyy BAH readers... How y'all been? So like, lol, hypothetically, remember when I said I was rewriting BAH? I am still doing that but uhhhh I might've slightly just a lil teeny tiny bit... lost the entire chapter somewhere in my computer.... lmfao it'll be up soon I promise!!
Harry may not have always had warm blankets, but whenever Vernon wasn't in town, and Petunia was feeling a little safer, she would let the twins use the extra blankets, and even, if they were clean of course, the guest room. Enough of that though. We'll come along to that mindset soon enough.
The factory is dark, that much they can tell from the windows so the twins sneak in through what seems to have been an office window and sneak around to a different door, slamming it open and watching as the teens all quickly decided to run away, lest they get arrested.
Harry responded "Hello Aslan, no worries we're here for The Potters reservation, I believe Jared expects us?" his face determined and calm while Hydrangea casually glanced around. The bar was lovely, filled with warm woods, and stained glass windows, with lights that gave the place a warm sort of feeling and comfy but nice looking furniture spread throughout. Hydrangea idly wondered what a tea shop would look like if she ever really did open one.
Too heavy a burden to ask children to shoulder he has long-since figured out the hard way, but perhaps, together, they will overcome it.
Apparently Maria Stark herself had helped him think of it when they'd met because he'd run away from his father many years ago, Adeline listened happily as her son boasted, and brought up that her second husband was still helping him out with the math because he wasn't the best with numbers thanks to dyscalculia, however, he was about to retire so Adeline had brought him along to introduce him to Petunia, who had a degree in mathematics and engineering.
Once Hydrangea waved the snake goodbye, Petunia was quite faint until it was completely out of sight Petunia bent down to pick up her niece and nephew. Quickly bringing both the twins inside she read over the rather short, note for lack of a better word, that had apparently been left by Albus Dumbledore.
"Yeah alright, let's get stuff for another recipe too, we can have this for dinner tonight." Harry, ever the quiet one said. Harry was often found daydreaming as they grew up, picturing worlds that few could imagine, Hydrangea was often just as good with her own imagination but better at managing when to Look and when not to. Though I suppose most children are.
Severus doesn't care either way, he merely wants to know the effects and affects of one of his earlier potions after extended periods of time. It takes only a week after the cure is administered for Severus to conclude that nothing, other than an aversion to murky waters and the occasional nightmare,
As Lily walks into the kitchen to pour herself a cup of coffee into the mug with a packet of muggle hot chocolate, and far too much sugar and a good amount of heavy cream, she bends down to kiss his head leaving him red-faced as he lifts the paper higher and she snickers into the mug as it finishes preparing itself.
She went to wake up her brother who seemed to have been replaced with a caterpillar if the cocoon of blankets was anything to go by.
The fox seems to consider while the cat, who had been idly watching the trio from behind him up to now, walks calmly to the boy and says, in a deep feminine voice "I accept."
A few years passed, Harry and I were enjoying our jobs, but we’d come to embrace our summer break with love.
She can't imagine not wanting to see the twins, they're the sweetest most oblivious kids she'd ever seen, and she grew up with Lily "I befriend the weird boy at the end of the street, and even though I'm a literal genius I never recognize that he has a crush on me" Evans so that's saying something.
"My father is hitting my mum again. I wish he would just, stop breathing sometimes ya'know? Or maybe not, I don't know." Theo drank from the bottle he'd been handed and passed it to Blaise.
"Why don't I swipe one of Dudley's dress shirts, and we can try that thing Ms. Morell showed us in class last week?"
The fox huffs and walks to the girl and stands before her, making eye contact before saying "I accept."
When Harry rolled off the bed in an effort towards escape of his sisters prodding Hydrangea could only laugh louder, peaking over the edge of the bed she noticed he wasn't there anymore, just in time to have her sides tickled from behind.
The Slytherins had heard about the Horcruxes from their parents and found that destroying them was moderately easy depending on how desperate, or talented one was.
“The wards,” a breathless, naked Draco said as Harry tried to shove him onto the bed. “Don’t forget the wards.”
“Sorry, you’re right,” the man said, sitting up and looking a bit more alive. “What’s left to do then?”
He went into his bedroom, where the black velvet box was sitting on top of his wardrobe, where he had left it the last time he had decided to take the cufflinks out and look at them.
“I know you will. But I have to admit I feel a little guilty. Seems to me I didn’t pick the most convenient time to get married. But this is important to both Draco and me, so we’re making it work.”
public speaking.” He had been roped into it by McGonagall earlier in the week, not feeling like he could say “no” to something so important.
Clint had belonged squarely in that category, at least in Kyle’s mind, for so long that it required a lot of reorientation for him to think about it any other way. But, as the morning gave way to the afternoon and Kyle found himself back in the lab with Clint, Kyle did try to think about it, and think about it seriously.
Things perked up a bit with the arrival of Andromeda and Teddy, loaded down with Christmas packages, the baby sporting an adorable little wool hat and matching mittens. Harry scooped him up from Andromeda immediately, giving kisses all over his face and making him giggle.
“Are you both ready, then?” Molly asked. “The rest of the party is in position. They’re waiting for us.”
“It’s just how we show our love,” said Harry, giving Draco a kiss on the temple. “You’ll get used to it.”
“You could start selling tickets. ‘Watch Harry Potter take it up the arse!’ Twenty galleons a pop. You’d make a fortune.”
Unfortunately, the tiny winged ball had been quite elusive so far. Harry had spotted it once about half an hour in, but had been successfully distracted by two Bludgers aimed at him at once, ruining the trajectory of his dive and drawing his focus long enough for the Snitch to disappear again.
Draco deliberately left his quarters only a little before nine, guaranteeing that he would be at least ten minutes late to the pub. It was mainly to make sure that he and Potter didn’t run into each other in the entrance hall, and therefore have to find a way to make conversation all the way to Hogsmeade, but it also had the added bonus of making Potter sweat.
“So a Muggleborn is just supposed to leave their heritage behind when they enter Hogwarts?” Harry countered.
She stepped passed him, towards her front door, glad her key was right there in her pocket and she could unlock and open the door quickly. She spared him one more glance. “Go home.” She meant the words to sound firm, but they only came out resigned.
Goddard bowed his head sympathetically. “That is hard to say. May is eight months away, which gives us a good deal of time, more than my estimate for what's needed. Your mother could very well be completely recovered by then, and your father may be recovered enough, at least, to be there for you at your wedding. There is certainly hope, and realistic hope at that. However, as you know, I can't give you any guarantees.”
They prepared the table in silence, Draco pouring each of them glasses of juice and laying out napkins and silverware, while Harry scooped generous helpings of rice and stew into two bowls and brought them to the kitchen table. Draco thanked Harry quietly as his bowl was set in front of him, and took the time to enjoy a couple of bites before he looked up at Harry, who he knew was watching him intently.
A continued thanks to those who have been reaching out and giving me your thoughts in the comments!!! It means a lot to me, even when I know there are elements of this story that are challenging.
Draco rolled over and lifted himself into position. He was facing the headboard now, away from Harry, and he was suddenly acutely aware of the way the brunet was kneeling behind him, as naked as he was. He grabbed the headboard for support as one of Harry’s hands ran lovingly down his back and over his arse, gripping and massaging the soft, pale flesh.
He did eventually drift off, but morning came all too soon. Harry dragged his way through it, trying to muster the energy that he knew would be required for the chaos of a week-long stay at the Burrow. He hadn’t always felt that way about visiting the Weasleys, and he felt a bit guilty for feeling it now. But he couldn’t do anything about it. It was just one of the many things that had changed in the past few months.
“Well, the study’s too small to be a proper guest room,” said Pansy. “Though it is a shame, because Harry lost those extra bedrooms on the third floor when he cleared it out.”
Malfoy took a deep breath, then released it. “One cannot deny that there are things that the Muggles simply do better than wizards. Clothing is one of those things. Art, literature, and music are also superior, in my opinion.” Harry stared at him, caught somewhere between grinning and gaping in disbelief. “I have no qualms about wearing Muggle clothing, or listening to Muggle music. But I don’t want the only thing to distinguish us from Muggles to be that we happen to be able to do magic. There is more to us than that, there is more to our culture than that.”
“It would be best if he didn’t do this again, though,” Draco said drily. “I think he’s used up all his luck on this one.”
Teddy found Draco in his study at half past five. Draco looked up and smiled at the little person lingering in the doorway, holding a big puzzle box in his arms.
Malfoy’s hand ran up Harry’s stomach and over his chest, and Harry was sure that the blond would be able to feel the unrelenting pounding of his heart. But he didn’t care, because he was flush against Malfoy now, pressed groin to groin, and it was
her child, by the way, in every way that matters – or ask me. Floo me, or owl me, or send me a Patronus, and I will come running.”
Draco snorted, then pursed his lips, then really considered what Harry had just said. “Perhaps you’re right. But there’s no telling him that.”
The written exam for Herbology was the last of it for Harry, and when the examiner had called time and magically collected their parchments, Harry sagged back in his chair, finding it hard to believe that he was actually finished. No more school. No more studying, no more essays. Joy bubbled up inside him, and he turned to look a Draco with a grin. Draco smiled back, though it was not nearly as unrestrained. It was then that Harry remembered that Draco was not yet finished, still having a challenging Arithmancy exam to complete that afternoon, the one test that Draco had been most stressed about.
Draco chuckled beside him. “Luckily that is something that is easily remedied. It’s nearly time for lunch anyway.”
But most of the people in the room didn’t hear her, as they were already starting another argument about where the assignment should start.
“Yes, but I want to know the details. What happened in them? What was I doing? What were you doing?”
Harry’s eyes flitted to Draco for a moment, unsure, but then he decided to take a chance. Narcissa had brought up the subject, after all. “I think she’s looking to reconnect with the family she still has,” he said. “She’s lost so much already, like we all have. I think she would welcome a correspondence with you, if you… were so inclined.”
Her eyes crinkled in concern. “They’ll be back at Christmas. And for the summer. And you have mutual friends. Your paths might cross every now and then.”
“Because by the time you’ve spent a month wearing what I’ve picked out for you, you won’t want to wear anything else. Trust me.”
“That’s what most fantasies are. The best fantasies, anyway. You build them around something or someone unattainable, so that when the fantasy never comes true, you’re not disappointed. Anything too attainable, then you almost start to expect it. Or, even worse, you do get it, and it doesn’t nearly live up to what you had built up in your head.”
Draco smirked down at him. “Or,” he said, “we kill two pixies with one spell and just shower here, together.”
Draco gave a self-satisfied nod. “As I said, there is a two year age difference and teenage boys, well… suffice to say I know because I used to be one, aren’t always… thinking with their brains. So if he is pressuring you-“
The look Harry gave him was so full of warmth and love that it was hard not to leap across the table to give him a thorough snog. But it was hardly the time for that, given everything.
Thankfully, Teddy appeared to be in much better spirits, much more like his usual self, when Harry spotted him on the playground in front of the school. He was running around with a dark-haired boy Harry didn’t recognize, and they appeared to be having quite a good time. Teddy had made his hair dark as well, a good sign that they were getting along.
“It would be most effective if you were here frequently,” she said. “But I can create some surrogate artifacts to exist in your place until you finish school. They will channel your energy wherever you are and release it into the house. It shouldn’t be too much of a drain on your magic.”
“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “But I’ll be a little later getting home, so you’ll be tasked with keeping Teddy company while I prepare dinner.”
. Just… to be with you. And only with you. To be with you as long as you’ll have me. Beyond that… I honestly don’t know what it should look like or how we should do this. It’s all new to me.”
Harry knew how he had longed to hear those words come out of Draco’s mouth, how much Harry had longed himself to say them. But that longing was nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to the feeling of actually hearing them. He swallowed thickly, unable to speak.
“Of course,” she said. “I’m sure it’s especially hard to fit family time in, with the end of the school year approaching so quickly.”
“Do you have to go to France for the entire holiday?” Harry asked him, interrupting his wandering thoughts.
Harry resolved to owl him that very day. With any luck he’d have something scheduled for as early as next weekend. And then his problem would be solved.
The strange thing was, he could actually see how that was possible. There was something very natural and unguarded about the three of them together that Draco found to be a rare experience in his own life. But he quite liked it. It was the same thing he had managed to achieve with Pansy, at least during the times in their friendship when they were closest and at their most honest. And it was what he had with Harry now.
Pansy smirked. “Are you telling me you don’t remember his exact words? Because that doesn’t really seem like you.”
“I don’t know,” Draco said honestly. “I hope not. If he did, I think… I don’t really think it’s possible he actually
him. They were connected by the most intimate parts of themselves. It had never struck him this way before. But now…
“And we can always spend the occasional weekend at Grimmauld, if we want to get away. I can live with that. I can-“
“I’m not out, you know,” Draco said suddenly. He saw Kyle turn to him sharply out of the corner of his eye. “To the world, I mean. I’m out to some of my friends. But no one here, not at this party.”
Granted, he’d been sleeping exclusively with Muggle men he’d picked up at various bars and clubs all over London, so it was never going to be serious. The sex wasn’t completely devoid of connection. He was a graduate of the Harry Potter School of Pleasing a Lover, after all, so he did make the most out of it. No one he had slept with so far went away unsatisfied or unhappier for having been with him. Draco made sure of that. But it was unlikely he was going to find someone in that world that he wanted an actual relationship with.
Harry was really tired of being right. Quidditch practice that night was the worst they had had all term. Ron was his usually silent self, but Ginny’s mood was outright foul. She was belligerent and uncooperative, and most of practice was wasted on trying to get all three Chasers to successfully execute the plays that had been practicing for weeks. A week ago, they had it down perfectly, and a victory against Ravenclaw was all but guaranteed. Now, though, Harry was genuinely nervous. The first match of the season was inching ever closer, and if Ginny didn’t snap out of this soon, they were in serious trouble.
And his voice really did sound like he had been waiting, so desperate for him, that Draco thought it possible he would come in his pants merely from the sound of Harry’s voice alone. But he wanted his hands on Harry, and Harry’s hands on him, so he undid the button of Harry’s jeans, and the button of his own, and Harry whispered, “Yes,
“So Draco’s tux would be that color?” He could picture that nicely, actually. Draco always looked handsome in gray.
Hannah burst into laughter. “Now that I’d like to see. Of course, it would be just your luck for there to be a photographer in here to catch you in the act. Can you imagine the headlines? ‘Harry Potter’s lover, a closet exhibitionist!’ People would be beside themselves.”
The opponent materialized and took only a second before firing what Harry thought might be a nasty Flamethrower Jinx. Harry dodged, keeping his footing, and retaliated with an Ice-bullet Jinx, which was blocked. Back and forth they went, and Harry could hear Kemp yelling instructions at him, reminding him he needed to have multiple spells ready to go if he wanted to land anything. He aimed a Stunner high, making the opponent duck, before hitting him immediately with a low Leg-locker Curse that had the opponent hitting the ground immediately.
“Teddy…” Harry went on as the boy closed his eyes. “Draco and I have some things we need to talk to you about.”
that had been delivered that morning. Bypassing the political and sports sections (always boring), he went straight to the gossip pages, where all the juicy stuff could be found.
Malfoy was close. He was beginning his ascent, upwards, towards the crest of the wave, and he was chanting.
“If I’m going to stay the night,” Draco had said impatiently, “then I have to leave early, so no one sees. You know that.”
to. It had to mean that they had something, a connection that neither shared with any other. Whether that connection was romantic was another matter, but Draco wondered if that was really all that important.
And now he was here, and it was surreal. Mostly because he realized he actually didn’t know Hermione or Ron really at all. Essentially all of his assumptions about them appeared to be false. Hermione was warm and inclusive, intellectual but not overbearingly so; Ron was sharp and sure of himself, with a dry wit that helped Draco understand why he appealed to both Harry and Hermione.
And there, just below: Harry’s arse. That fine arse, even better than Draco remembered. Because it was
Draco stared at the ceiling of his bedroom, watching the light of the dawn slowly encroach through the window.
“No,” she said, looking at him knowingly. “He is incredibly generous. I noticed that from the beginning.”
“I honestly don’t care all that much about where we get married, or what kind of decorations there are, or any of that. All I care about is that we keep it small, only people we really want to be there, and that I can wear a tuxedo and not dress robes.”
“Here, have a whiskey,” Dean said, shoving a glass in Ron’s hand. “A peace offering, and a promise that I am not currently shagging your sister.”
“I know you feel strongly about this,” Bulstrode interrupted. “And I understand why. But there are rules in place for a reason. Aurors and Healers are bound in many of the same ways, and for us to have a strong cooperative relationship, which is often required between the two groups, we must both respect the others' requirements and protocols. We have no justifiable reason to invade the privacy of the wizard who performed the magic, not when we have no way of knowing if understanding more about the magic or the person who performed it would help us more effectively heal your parents. Therefore it would be pointless to ask.”
other options. But I chose the one that would spare them the pain of losing me if I died. I knew what I was risking in the war, what was possible. I knew I could die and I wanted to spare them that.”
That was all that needed to be said. They were halfway out of their clothes already but Draco finished the job with a wave of his wand, leaving both of them exposed and panting. Draco practically tackled Harry onto the guest bed, but Harry came along willingly, reveling in the feeling of skin on skin. They released a collective moan as Draco ground into Harry and Harry bucked lustfully in response, increasing the friction.
Draco stood. “No time like the present.” He felt giddy and daring, and he wasn’t sure entirely where it came from. He supposed he was just tired of all the subterfuge and talking around the issue with her.
“My father wouldn’t have it,” she said. “I was only seventeen when Daphne ran off with Luc. Blaise and I were already seeing each other by that point, but it was early, and we weren’t ready to talk about marriage yet, which is why we kept it a secret. My father told me that the best way to repair the contract with your parents was for you to marry me instead. But he wanted to wait until I was a little bit older. He thought seventeen was too young, and he was right, in that regard. I hoped when I told him about Blaise he would change his mind, but it only made him angry. He told me to end it with Blaise, saying that I had to wait in case you were still single in a couple of years. Then he would reopen negotiations with the Malfoys.”
Clint chuckled at his eagerness. “I have to get you ready first. And I plan on being very thorough.”
Ron nodded his agreement. “We’ll just do something with them a little later on, yeah, once they’re better?”
She glanced at her friend, wondering if she wanted to get into this. But Harry wouldn’t judge. He would be honest, sure, but he wouldn’t tell her what to do.
Harry tapped his razor on the side of the sink and began working on his left cheek. “Never really got the hang of shaving charms. They make me nervous.”
He would always miss Albus Dumbledore. He would always have the highest respect for the man. But he had to acknowledge that it was much more pleasant to enter this office knowing the only thing he had to concern himself with was whether or not he would be getting some treacle tart with his tea.
Kyle shook his head. “No thanks,” he said. “I’m really not up for it.” He swallowed, knowing what else he needed to say. “Look, you’re great. I like spending time with you and I really like you. But this just… isn’t working for me.”
Harry snorted derisively. "Not everything is about you, you know," he said, and that stung more than Draco cared to admit. “This has nothing to do with you. This,” he imitated Draco's gesture, “is the result of me foolishly letting Teddy have a friend over after school. He was an absolute nightmare of a child and he made a complete mess of everything, wearing out both me
“There it is,” Draco said as the rhythmic, otherworldly sound filled the room, magnified by the charm. “That’s your baby’s heart beating.”
“My friend David’s throwing a birthday party at his place for his boyfriend in a couple of weeks. I’ve been invited, and I thought… Well…” Harry paused in his shaving, his chin only half finished. “I know we agreed that we wouldn’t… go out. I mean, be seen out together. But, you know, it’s a Muggle party. I mean it will all be Muggles. None of the guests will be anyone we know, from the wizarding world. And it will be at David’s apartment, not a public place, so there’s really no risk.”
Vesper gave the student a small but knowing smile. “Always the charmer, aren’t you?” Jaime grinned wider. “Welcome back. Mr. Kemp will be out shortly, but he wanted me to introduce you to Mr. Potter. He’s an apprentice here and he’s going to be leading your session today.”
The book arrived one morning at the end of the following week. It was a heavy thing, and it had been expensive, but Harry didn’t see any other way. He had scoured the library top to bottom for what he needed, to no avail. He had even approached the acerbic Madam Pince, the school librarian, about the issue. She was surprisingly helpful, in the end; she knew the exact book he needed. But Hogwarts didn’t have it, so he had to order it himself.
Vesper and Declan were able to resume their conversation at the end of training, Declan clearly eager to hear the details of what Ron had said to both her and Dempsey. As they made their way to the locker room, Vesper filled him in.
He is only technically right, and regardless he will not know for a few years yet. Not until for some reason or another two mysterious stowaways are found in cloak when he goes for the yearly visit to Azkaban. Luckily this is a few years off though.
"I won't be able to tonight, BUT I'm sure Aslan up there wouldn't mind,  she quite lovely you know? So kind. Beautiful too. Honestly, she's the best damn waitress I've hired so far, now Mike, on the other hand, that guy's a di- you know what I have rambled about you-know-who long enough, you two head upstairs and get in your hotel yeah? Goodnight twins, I'll be by in exactly twelve hours to talk about school." Jared, the odd man he is, was sort of,  hopping into his office. No, skipping,  he is skipping into his office.
But what if Harry was trying to present them as more? What if Harry made it seem like they were… a couple? How would Draco feel about that?
years feeling the worst of it as OWLs and NEWTs were now on the horizon. Draco found himself swamped with work as well, as he still had regular marking to do, plus final exams to write and a few research theses to read and notate from the 7
Teddy nodded vigorously. “When we get married he can come live in my room with me. And then I’ll be with him all the time.”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t care about that, Harry. Other people can rant and rave and send me Howlers. It doesn’t matter. I learned a long time ago that most people are stupid, and their opinions are meaningless.”
himself, watching her. She could feel it, hear it, and it made her clit sing with need. She pinched her nipple and whimpered, rubbing herself faster. But she wanted more; she wanted to
Of course, it was all a moot point until he knew what Draco wanted. If he didn’t want a repeat, or wanted something open and casual, then the answer was simple. If he wanted a relationship with Harry, then Harry would have to decide if he felt the same way, and they would go from there. And if Draco was unsure… well… they’d just have to figure it out together.
When she arrived at the classroom she saw that Ron was already there, not a good sign, but at least he hadn’t started the lesson yet. She snuck in quietly, happy to find a desk next to Declan free.
Then Clint was kissing around his hips, and Kyle felt his hardness bumping up against the man’s neck.
, Draco found himself thinking. He hadn’t realized it before now. Kyle was lanky, one might even say gangly, and he was wearing a plaid button-down shirt and sported messy dark hair that both made him seem younger than he probably was. But looking at him more closely Draco could see high, handsome cheek bones, deep blue eyes, and long, agile fingers that seemed perpetually fidgety. Plus his shy, embarrassed smile made Draco’s heart squeeze in a strange way.
Harry chuckled some more. He wondered if Blaise and Theo would bother putting up a fight at all, or if they would just accept the inevitable. They
Draco smiled, finding his anger effectively driven out by curiosity and a general feeling of warmth rising up in him. His eyes lingered a few moments longer over Harry’s words, enjoying his subtle hints at their sexual escapades, before curiosity won out, and he reached for the package to open it.
. What a pretentious little prick Mr. Fawley was. Not to mention a vocal and shameless blood supremacist. Harry couldn’t stand him. And now he actually had to sit down with the solicitor and have a conversation the following day, one he was really not looking forward to. But it had to be done. There was nothing for it.
Teddy heaved a sigh and Draco grinned into his pillow. He rolled over, blinking until he could fully make out Teddy’s bright face.
“It was a disaster. It was actually really…” Harry scratched his chest back and forth with blunt fingernails for a moment. “It was pretty humiliating, at least at the time.”
“I deliberately went and got me some Muggle money, just for this reason,” Clint continued to argue, holding up a couple of five pound notes. “What else am I going to do with them?”
Draco watched the letter burn to ash, mouth resting solemnly against shaky hands. Well, he had been expecting it. He had known it would come. He had always known.
“You wouldn’t understand,” Vesper said, aware that her voice had gone shaky. “You don’t know what it
She came spinning out of the hearth gracefully not a minute later, dusting non-existent soot off of her person before turning to him, her head cocked and a small smile on her face.
, even right after hearing such upsetting news. He wanted to reply, but he found his throat suddenly tight.
“There is more training,” Vesper said. “We can’t expect to learn everything there is to learn in just nine weeks. But it’s all on the job, and specific to what department you’re assigned. I’m only a Junior Auror, which means I’ve got at least a couple of years where I’m essentially shadowing my partner and learning from him or her. I get to work cases, of course, but they likely won’t be very hard ones, and all of my work is directly supervised. The longer I stick with it the less that’s true, as I understand it, until eventually I get promoted to Senior Auror and I am more in charge of my case load and the lines of inquiry, that sort of thing.”
that existed in the world was him. Everyone else was merely a help or a hindrance to the thing he wanted most: to control everything and everyone. To me, that was what made Voldemort so dangerous. Because if he never saw other people as people, then he could not feel love or compassion towards them, not feel remorse for killing them. I’m not sure he felt much of anything really. He certainly never felt anything for anyone other than himself. And isn’t that so much more terrifying than even anger or hate? Indifferent to others is the coldest, cruelest thing we can be.”
Draco let out a small breath, and a smile flitted across his lips for just a moment. “Harry,” he said, and with one swift tug pulled the Gryffindor to him.
“Mmmm.” Harry nibbled on Draco’s earlobe a bit. “So only two nights without you in my bed. I suppose I can live with that.”
“We’ll be careful,” Draco said, his eyes fixed on Harry’s mouth. “Just… don’t move.” He touched his lips to Harry’s again, cradling his chin gently, and Harry gave in, returning the pressure.
Evan knew it though. He was so angry, when Kyle first mentioned wanting to leave his job, maybe move out of Toronto in search of other opportunities. Though Kyle had told Evan to come along, or offered long-distance as a temporary option, he could see now that those offers were made half-heartedly at best. Deep down, he’d been trying to find a way to leave, and Evan saw through the pretense. That was why Evan was so upset, why he had acted the way he did in those final months.
“You’re looking for a casual fuck,” Harry said, his disbelief still evident in his voice. “With a man.”
Harry sighed and looked at him some more. He didn’t know what to make of it. The only thing he could think was that Teddy wanted the distractions that school could bring. He wanted his friends.
They arrived at the Apparition point, and Declan turned to her, giving her a soft smile. “I had fun tonight,” he said.
He only sat there, not looking at her or saying anything. The silence stretched on, and Vesper wondered what she
Of course he had. Blaise’s business connections were legendary by this point, and he seemed to know most restaurateurs and club owners in wizarding London well enough to get a table anywhere on short notice. Draco had never had much need to take advantage of this, seeing as he was the well-known partner of the Savior of the wizarding world, but it was nice to ride coattails other than Harry’s every now and then, if only for the change of scenery.
If anyone is surprised Salazar created several hidden rooms, some that you don’t even need parseltongue for, then they’re not that intelligent. We’ve all been laying around in a bed roughly the size of a dormitory for days on end, exhausted, though I tend to wonder why I’m so tired, I barely did anything I’m sure of it.
Regulus pays his debt in full and Cassandra is happily laughing his lap when Severus stumbles in angry and in pain, he is seething and Reggie knows better than to let laughter worsen an angry mans headache, and so he puts the tiny black haired child, darker even than his brother's hair, to bed in the mattress Peter had been using. Peter is depressingly unaware.
"Hylo, why are you guys discussing schools like that?" Hermione asked while she helped whisk, Hylo loved cooking, as did Harry, Petunia had tried to help them enjoy themselves through their chores as well as she could.
He was still in mild shock at bring hugged by The Moldy Egg, could you blame him? It was then however that he would find out that life doesn’t wait for the shock factor to fade, she doesn’t give a singular flying fuck in any honest observation.
Lily laughs outright at his face then and Regulus considers it unfair, and thus casts a tickle charm at her once she's finished her coffee and stretching, totally didn't wait for the stretching to finish so he can stare at her impossibly long dark red hair tumbling haphazardly down her back in curls lit by the sun like the angel she would hex him for even thinking she might just be, but still revenge is necessary so he shoots it off and apparates out of the house before she can do anything, he's in charge of dinner today and he wants beef stew.
Petunia Evans was once a happy woman, she had an older boyfriend who understood that she wanted to finish her degree, she had a baby sister that seemed to think she'd hung the moon, she had a lovely house in a beautiful neighborhood, and all was well.
And so, this is how we find them, nearly two years later on a very specific Saturday night sneaking things to take with them. They've got one hundred thousand pounds they've been swiping from Vernon, gambling, working to gather for the past two years, and doing "tricks" for that's hidden in the front garden in Petunia's old luggage set that she'd gotten from Lily as a wedding gift since Lily knew how much she wanted to travel.
Idly he wonders if the Potters ever did anything with the Prince family, the only way to be a natural at mind arts is to inherit it, as far as he knows he's the only one in all of Britain with his families legacy.
Also, if/when I tag MCD in a future book I will tell you in the tags who die. If it's Umbitch I won't tag MCD But if it's, Petunia, it'll be mentioned the moment it's written, I promise.
They are, after all, the future, and at this point, the only ones who can truly do anything to save it.
But it matters not as the fox, for all that he is in the shape of a man, is still only a shifter, like his grandmother and him, like a lot of the pureblood families, most of them are to be fair, only technically pure. Even the Malfoys.
"Yes, guns, drugs, people, what does it matter, you're not involved in this Petunia, I made sure of it," Petunia raised her hand before he could continue.
As he sat in front of the tv he wondered what he could do now, wondered when, or if, his wife would come back. A small part of him hoped not if he were honest. Not if she could treat her son like that. Not if she could treat any child, or even any person like that.
But then again, neither man thought too far ahead, one had just accepted his death only minutes ago, and the other knew he would die sooner or later.
" for Vernon to take them on vacation to L.A. after a particularly interesting diary entry from Lily.
Grabbing the shirt he hated most because of the color she turned away from the closet, hid the lollipop, undressed, then put the dress shirt on, buttoning it fully. A quick look in the mirror confirmed all the buttons were done, and she ran downstairs to the small bathroom immediately afterward. Harry was already there with their drinks, and cheesecake slices.
When Harry and Hydrangea were seven they had decided to run away; and with good reason too, as all the various forms of, what they, and Aunt Petunia, now know thanks to various rants from a student of psychology ranting, and accidentally explaining many things in sordid detail as abuse, weren't worth it. After all, who wants to be beaten, treated like a slave, and starved just because they exist?
Peter is summoned and given a choice later that night. His daughter's life, or his friends. He figures he has time, and he knows his daughter will die if he hesitates more than a minute. He's seen as much from Bellatrix's torture.
After all, children often help with the shopping, there's even a special about it in Japan that Emily had watched once called My First Errand. It was truly adorable and sweet that they were helping.
To be fair, Harry's quite certain it was more the place they were buying from, and the eggshell they chewed but, still.
“Fair enough, do you know any hiding spots Remus won’t find us in, I think the four of us should have a nice, long nap. And you’re still unnaturally comfortable for such a pointy git. Hey where’s Pansy, I heard she actually used her acting for good.” Although I'm sure his eyebrows are wiggling, because he's a loser like that, I don't look to confirm. Pus just came out of the moldy dead guy's nostril, it's gross and I can't look away so I point to the girl who is leaning into a Luna, Ginny, and Neville pile on like she’s passed out.
I don't know if anyone remembers, but originally The Twins were mentioned as having been molested by their uncle. Although I've cut that out, it was there, and I've decided to go a different route with it so I can have something to do with one of the Books' that's about to get derailed (Anyone who guesses correctly before I publish gets a shoutout!!), Also, I really want to deal with the trauma a little bit, and I know I could keep this sort of thing to the Teen Wolf universe, but I've realized that Derek went through a very different type of assault, and as much as I want to be honest about it, I can't portray Derek (Hale btw, I'm talking about Derek Hale) and his experiences the way I want to portray the twins. Because Derek was willing and knew what was happening, maybe he was talked into things, maybe not, I don't know yet, but The Twins? They were little. They were young. They didn't know anything about the world and the horrors she is forced to hold, Petunia hadn't even explained it to them yet. And when she finds out, that's going to be a very eventful time. I don't know which book it'll be for certain, but one of them will deal with it.
“You don’t have to like him,” Harry said. “But you have to accept that I do. That I love him, like a brother. He’s part of my family, Draco, just like Hermione is. I have to be there for him.”
“Yes, that’s very much how it is with Draco,” Harry said. “He even wears Muggle clothing, most of the time, when he’s not required to wear robes. And I don’t blame him. Robes are awful. Jeans and jumpers are far superior.”
Unfortunately, he couldn’t sit there all day thinking about it. He had to head to the floo, and Harry was most likely going to hop in the shower and begin his own day. So with a final kiss and a murmured goodbye Draco stood, already mentally preparing himself for the thirty-six hours ahead of him.
Harry himself was grateful that he had ended the evening with his wits about him, considering what had happened with Ginny. He shuddered to think how things would have unfolded if he had been out of his skull on elven wine. He didn’t think even under the influence of alcohol he would have had a desire to be with her, but he wouldn’t have been able to fend off her advances or help her to see reason so easily, in all likelihood. His stomach twisted at the thought of what could have been.
Thank you so much for your comments as always! I have been working diligently on this story trying to finish it (after a bit of a stretch where I was super busy and not particularly inspired and therefore barely writing at all) and your feedback is helping a ton with getting me back on track!
But Eloise didn’t take obediently to that, just as Eamon had mentioned in his account. She grabbed her own wand off her bedside table and followed him out. Vesper and Declan followed as well.
“That you’re not my dad.” Draco opened his mouth to answer, not sure exactly what he was going to say, but Teddy kept talking. “I
It had been, by any measure, a successful date. Callum was pleasant company; smart, cheeky, a good conversationalist. He didn’t take most things all that seriously, and Harry liked that in a casual partner. It had been a little nerve-racking sneaking him into Hogwarts. It wasn’t his usual practice, but Callum was in the midst of moving flats and didn’t have anywhere to take Harry home to.
his arousal, his desperate need for her. So she opened her eyes and met his, taking in his dilated pupils, his glistening, parted lips, his desperate panting.
He smiled to himself, and when she was well gone he organized the papers on his desk in earnest, stood, and decided he would return to Francesca’s and see if his two friends were still enjoying themselves, and if he would be welcome to join them.
Harry, on the other hand, had always been good at mornings. In the first year of their living together, when Draco was still completing his Potions mastery and didn’t usually have to be up first thing in the morning, Harry always beat him out of bed, and there was usually a nice hot plate of breakfast and a pot of tea waiting for Draco when he finally made his way downstairs.
“You thought maybe she’d figured it out already or something? That’s how my sister was, when I came out to her. She basically told I didn’t need to bother because, ‘Umm…
If he had already walked away by now, if she opened the door and he was already gone, then it was for the best, really.
Kyle was left with the distinct impression that he had been expertly manipulated, and he had no idea how he was supposed to feel about that.
that spending more time with Declan might make me stop thinking about Blaise. Because I like Declan a lot. I could actually see something happening with him. But then I think about Blaise and about how I’m not really over him yet and I feel guilty. I don’t want to use Declan or anything.”
years had applied to apprentice under him specifically as well, and so Draco also had to review those applications and choose one or two students to take on for next year. And for those he would reject he also felt obligated to write recommendation letters, so that they could find apprenticeships elsewhere, with other Potions masters.
"Honestly, I'd love to, but we have the meeting with Jared tomorrow so after that we can eat in alright?" Harry said,  Hydrangea turned the lights off,  and opened the curtains just enough to leave a light shining in from the streets.
"Thank you Yami-chan." He says in a significantly less growly voice, before curling into her lap, and resting his head on her knee and looking directly at the hidden man, if he had eyebrows, the man thinks, he'd have one raised.
Harry quickly put away the rest of clothes they'd picked up, and Hydrangea went to open the door, making it sound like she was having trouble unlocking it, while Hermione hid in the trunk with her books.
It is a rather normal morning that Regulus, for some ungodly reason, namely Cassandra, who is excited to play with Harry who is happily toddling around after the glowing dragon toy he had found in Arcturus' things, after checking it for curses he realized it's a traditional dragon toy given to babies around the Chinese New Years. They'd never really gotten to learn much of their culture in their homeland unless that culture was something about Being A Pureblood, or their grandfather was having a good day.
The man, who had introduced himself as Terry to the children finally, had then shown them how to lock the door (after taking a small drop of blood the twins weren't much worried about anyways, more curious how that "wand" works really.), he explained that until they turned eleven he would still be able to unlock it, but that if he saw them again, he'd knock first (he was joking, but Fenrir Terrence Greyback is a very peculiar man and wolf. Usually a good one, however, when quite literally forced, he's quite terrifying. For a moment Terry would entertain the idea of these being the children that took off his leash so to speak when The Moldy Egg™ died. The twins, however, were completely serious, and as they did not yet know Sirius, though I'm sure they soon will, they can not laugh at that amazing pun).
Harry nodded, "You're right, we can walk her home tomorrow morning or something, I'm sure we can spare some dinner and pajamas," Quickly closing the trunk, not shrinking it because this trunk didn't have that ability "Let's head back."
His little helions would be the first Foxes since his many times over great-grandfather Reynard. Idly, he hopes they do not shift until he can officially kick them out with the excuse that they need to see the world. He is well aware this will not happen.
Abruptly Severus remembers to put his shields back up, but he answers regardless, "I didn't think I deserved to, and then I didn't have the chance anymore." The twins nod, whether they truly understood the ramifications or not, Severus didn't feel the need to ask.
They are here for family, though, to be fair, one due to pressure to be a perfect replacement, and the other, the other is here to keep his alive.
Of course then when James comes in, chipper as can be, pours three orange juices, smacks a loud kiss on his cheek, hands the spill safe cup over to the children, and kisses Lily the same, only to walk immediately to his office where he, and sometimes Sirius, can curse his shitty handwriting without being overheard by the children.
Still setting up the twins lives, after all to nine year olds who are slightly tall for their age, and very "mature" (I can go on a ten thousand page rant on how "mature" victims of childhood abuse are.) for their age can't just live on the streets (far too "pretty" for that, let alone young)
In one particular article, written by Aria Star, a Slytherin he'd remembered breaking Nott Seniors nose when he insinuated her mother was a mistress, the muggle way. Sirius had clapped, and no one, not Slytherin, nor Gryffindor, nor even a pitying Hufflepuff, or an absent-minded Ravenclaw, had spoken to him until he'd apologized. One doesn't get away with insulting an Ancient Family without reason after all.
Vernon was more than a little confused by the tail end of Dudley's lecture, "-and never use that horrible unnatural disgusting magic for so long as you are my son!" He was shocked, but it made sense that Petunia would give birth to a magical being as she was the sister of what he was constantly told was a rather powerful one, still, he'd been more worried about Harry having magic, and having to explain that to the little ones then he was Dudley.
? Yeah, that could work. Let's do it, you pick the shirt and meet me in the bathroom, yeah?" Hydrangea nods and walks up the stairs, the Dursley's shouldn't be home for a while yet, but it's better safe than sorry they've learned, so the bags are hidden in the shed for when they go.
"Bad news," Groans erupted all around, and Draco smirked a little. "We're still behind in the Harry trap-" Pansy cut him off. "It's not a trap if it helps him Draak." Draco rolled his eyes. "It is if it traps him, now hush. Has anyone got anything new to add on that front?"
Hydrangea pulled out several hotel brochures she'd found. "Which one? I like the last two best but you should look too." She started eating her chicken taco salad and stealing bites of Harry's beef taco salad. He stole bites of her's too while looking through.
"Thanks, Potter. Think you could hiss this open? We lost our recording." Remembering that Malfoy had saved his life not long ago he nodded and hissed
Cassandra is a kind, intelligent child. Almost unnervingly so, and if Regulus hadn't been a Black, and a friend to each of The Mauraders, and even Severus Snape himself, the odd man that he is, he'd probably be at least slightly more worried than he is.
He pours a potion down James' throat from were he was bleeding out, and casts a stasis charm on him, he didn't like him much, but after fifth year when he and Sirius' heads were so far up their own asses they were finding it hard to breathe and had gotten to the point where they started using more, lethal, spells and charms, had it not been for the intervention of Remus, Lily, James, and even Peter, he's quite sure he and Sirius would've killed each other at some point. Only a small
There is a mention of past abuse but it's none descriptive, and merely a passing mention, only mentioned in passing. If you still think you can't handle the mention that's alright, you can read something else, no judgment I've done the same, take care of yourself.
"Vernon, I found your itinerary yesterday. I saw the notes. Gunning is smuggling illegal weapons aren't they?" She asked as the waiter went to get her a sparkling pomegranate juice.
So he pulled his cloak tight and left the Slytherins to sort themselves for once. Though before he left the room he noted that they looked almost like a particularly dangerous pit of snakes infuriated by their masters and preparing to strike, idly he wondered if these children would be the ones to attack.
These children, because that's what they were, should probably be woken up, and sent to their rooms, but Severus too was tired, tired of this war, of bad decisions, and wrong-sides, and dark lords, and genocide.
14. The device was gifted to Neville by his grandmother for some reason or another, no one really remembers. Except for Pansy and Luna. They always remember... It, the device, flows with the power of the wizard until it can contain it, and then it glows until it reaches the appropriate power level.
And thus he has built his own damnation. Though I suppose that is the theme for some of the people in this story isn't it.
Harry, of course, was already excited, Aunt Petunia had made curry a few times over for them when Vernon wouldn't be home for a few days as a way to show them where they came from, she'd told Harry once, though she wasn't entirely certain where that was she did remember James going on about his mums kebobs and rice and how he never could match up whenever he cooked. Lily later explained that is was the only meal his mum had taught him to cook.
In the end Vesper was glad she and Declan had joined them. It was clear she and Dempsey were never going to be friendly, the way he kept sneering at her all night, but she didn’t care. She’d connected with most of the others, and they were treating her more like a colleague than they had that first week. All in all, it was progress.
Draco stood from his desk chair abruptly and rushed to the floo as it chimed again. He pulled the lever to answer it, his heart frantic.
But what now? Was this the beginning of something, or simply a way for two men with a mutual attraction to relieve some tension? He had never done anything like that before, quick and dirty in an empty classroom, and he had never thought himself the type to look for sexual gratification without an emotional foundation to underlie it.
That was what it came down to, and he knew it. If Emilia had wanted to invite one of the other Slytherin girls along, even the ones Scorpius found a bit annoying, he wouldn’t have been upset. Hell, he probably wouldn’t have minded having another boy along, if it was someone he knew was only a friend and had no agenda beyond that.
When they reached Ron’s room and stepped inside, Ron's demeanor changed. His shoulders slumped and he put his head in his hands, mumbling something.
to heal. I’ve begun the process of reconstruction, but now that it’s going that process can continue even when I am not actively helping. I’ve already seen that with your mother, and that is a very good sign. Her mind wants to be reconstructed, and will therefore do much of the work on its own.”
Finally spent, Draco collapsed on top of Harry, the sticky layer of their combined cum gluing their abdomens together. Harry, too busy trying to catch his breath, couldn't find it in him to care.
Draco nodded. “Not all purebloods, either. Just traditionally dark families. They must be, otherwise, what would be the point? The Ministry doesn’t give a lick what sort of heirlooms old wizarding families own, even magical ones. They just want probable cause to go through our possessions in the hopes of finding something illegal.”
Draco followed the advice, continuing to breathe deeply and evenly as he went lower and lower, as he became fuller and fuller, until he had finally taken in all he could and his arse was nestled against Harry’s pelvis.
“I know you’re not,” said Draco, kissing him again, deeper this time. Harry moaned and licked his tongue along Draco’s bottom lip, eliciting a sigh from the Slytherin. “But,” he continued, pulling away, “we’ve just got Teddy off to bed and I think we should wait a couple of hours to be sure he’s fully asleep.”
“You were nervous,” Harry said. “When you’re nervous you keep tension in your shoulders, and you’re not as grounded as you need to be. But you self-corrected.”
“I was planning on having all of my wits about me tonight,” Harry assured him, stepping closer. “This is about you and me, after all.”
it.” He took a deep breath, calming himself. “Anyway, I was already pretty frustrated by that point. That was just one more nail in the coffin. I applied for a patent on my own, and the Canadian government was very interested in subsidizing for use in hospitals as a part of physical therapy. And then they offered me a job in development. I thought maybe it was time I looked into government work. Your Ministry ended up being the one who made the better offer, and I thought, ‘What the hell? I’ve never lived outside Canada before. Could be an adventure.’ And here I am.”
“I understand, of course, why you would want to do that,” Guensler replied, just as the kettle began to whistle from the kitchen. “That’s the water for the tea,” he said. “Do you like cream or sugar?”
Harry enjoyed the feeling of Draco slowly opening up for him. He fingered Draco frequently, and they had been working on stretching him over the past few weeks, having gotten as far as three fingers. Still, Harry knew that a cock was larger than three fingers, and that Draco would need plenty of preparation and to take things slow.
He immediately took her in his arms and started swaying her to the beat, and she was happy to follow along.
“Maybe a bit,” Aria said, shrugging. “Though the house divisions are a bit simplistic, aren’t they? I mean, you’re well smart enough to be in Ravenclaw, and nice enough to be in Hufflepuff. What difference does it make, really?”
Instead of answering, Draco found Harry’s mouth and snogged the living daylights out of him, until their lips were raw and their breaths ragged.
They stood there a moment, Harry near the foot of his bed and Draco only a few steps through the door, watching each other, before Harry raised an eyebrow and said, “Well?”
He felt a set of arms wrap around his waist and looked up to stare into a pair of dark eyes. They belonged to a face with shapely cheekbones and a pointed chin, but Draco hardly had time to take that in before they were pressed close, and all he could see was the man’s thin mouth. Their hips rolled together as slim fingers explored Draco, trailing up his back, tickling his neck. Another hand was sneaking up Draco’s chest, to the sliver of skin revealed at the opening of his shirt.
Harry blinked slowly, thinking. “Someone who has permission to come through my wards, but who doesn’t have the means to use the floo,” he said finally, a grave realization in his voice.
“I think he would have done that anyway,” Scorpius pointed out to her. “But sure, you do what you think is best.”
That was no way to live a life. That was no way to be in a relationship. It wasn’t a relationship at all, not when it was so full of
“I would never accuse you of being homophobic, you know. Not in a million years. It was just… the thought of you…“ He giggled. “And Ron…” He snorted. “And you were being serious. You honestly thought I would…” He got control of his laughter again. “I would never do that to you, Blaise, making you walk down the aisle with Ron Weasley of all people. We’ll sort something out. We haven’t even decided on the procession yet but I’ll make sure you don’t have to…” He started laughing again. “Sorry. Sorry. I just can’t get the image out of my head now you’ve put it there.”
They had a few minutes alone together afterward, back in the little parlor off of the ballroom, so they could catch their breath and be ready to properly greet their guests as a married couple. A good portion of it was used up admiring their rings and gushing over each other’s vows.
“I am,” he replied, just as quietly, and Harry smiled to himself. “Come into the yard with us and sit down,” Draco said more loudly. “It’s lovely out.”
Draco thought about that. It was true that while Draco had never felt the need to ask permission to go out back when it was just the two of them (he hardly wanted to set
“No,” Hannah said, suddenly sounding a bit sleepy. She lay her head on Angelina’s shoulder and nuzzled, though the angle was awkward.
He’d thought he could do it the way Harry did: dating around, having a few lovers whose company he enjoyed every now and then. But it never worked out that way. All the men turned out to be one-offs, mostly because after the sex, Draco could never see the point in it continuing if it was never going to go anywhere.
Vesper took him by the wrist and led him through the door and into the main hallway. For a moment Harry thought they were going to be bursting in on Kemp with his student after all, but instead she led him through another doorway to the left that took them into a part of the house Harry had never seen. They entered a large open foyer and Harry barely had a chance to take in the high ceilings and the crystal chandelier before Vesper was dragging him towards a curving white staircase that led upwards.
Harry wanted to find some way to keep teasing him, to try and convince him to stay, but he knew Draco didn’t like keeping his mother waiting, and also how much Narcissa hated to wait.
Harry laughed against him. “I did write that, didn’t I? Well, it’s true, I suppose. It’s just that he wants to be outside all the time. But when he is, he’s plenty good at entertaining himself. Hugo, on the other hand, is one of those children who requires a lot of attention. He always needs someone to play with.”
Harry crossed his arms. “Hmph.” He directed his knight to attack Draco’s last remaining bishop, which, of course, Draco saw coming. He moved his castle into position to take Harry’s queen two moves from now, then waited for Harry to take his turn. “I’m just not sure I see the point in playing,” Harry said, his eyes skimming the board, “if you can predict every move I’m going to make and then counteract that move. I’ll never win, because I’m not as good at predicting those things as you are.”
“I know it’s a lot to ask, Professor,” she said, her voice meek and pleading. “But I’d still really like to work, if that’s all right with you.”
It was hard to swallow the bitterness in his mouth when she shared that. It was hard for him not to comment on what a quick turn-around that was, and how Harry was clearly the type not to waste any time, and how did he even have the time or energy for such activities in the first place, what with all the teachers were carrying on their shoulders at the moment. But he didn’t say any of that, mostly because he knew he had no leg to stand on. He had told Harry to go back to his other lovers. He had been the one to end it, to drive him away. And he could hardly blame Harry for wanting to do something fun, something that would help alleviate the stress a bit.
Scorpius couldn’t be sure if his sister’s silence was surprised, thoughtful, or a bit of both. But he walked next to her until they arrived at the entrance to the Ravenclaw dorms.
“I developed a set of charmed shoes that allow any witch or wizard with a disability that affects their ability to walk to be able to walk and run, and to pretty much so anything else, without any trouble or pain.”
In a chair by the bedside sat a tall, bony woman with graying hair. She craned her long neck in their direction as the two men entered the room, her severe face drawn and wary.
And she was also remembering her own secrets, and the impossible, painful hurdle that had to be cleared even just to tell one person. And she knew she could hardly blame Vesper for holding back.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Esme?” said Theo, taking the girl from his wife’s arms. “I’ll take her over, then I’ll track down your man, eh?”
“Mm,” Vesper agreed vaguely. She knew a little something about having an opinionated mother-in-law. Well, not quite mother-
Harry was silent a moment. “I suppose it was some of that, but... The situation... So I was seeing these two wizards, Caleb and Daniel. One was a Ravenclaw our year and one was…” He stopped to think. “I think Daniel was two years above me in Gryffindor. We never knew each other in our school days, and the two of them didn’t know each other. But then, for my twenty-second birthday, Hermione and Ron threw this party for me and invited both of them. So they met and hit it off, then figured out they were both dating me. So it became this sort of… polyamorous situation, you could say, where we were all involved with each other. So naturally the topic came up of all three of us sleeping together at the same time.”
She did look at him, finally, and cleared her throat. “You’ve been acting strange all week, you know. I think you…” She bit her lip and stared at the flame in the lamp on the far wall. “I think you’re scared to face the next step in your life, what you know you need to do. I understand it,” she continued, talking over Harry as he made a move to protest. “What we went through, and losing Fred…” Tears were falling down her cheeks in earnest now, and she wiped at them with the back of her hand. “We’ve all suffered, Harry. And it’s natural to want to pull away from that, to want to escape. But I just… don’t want you to make a choice, and then regret it, because in the moment you convinced yourself that you could be someone you’re not.”
Evan’s eyes widened in shock and confusion, and Kyle wondered for a moment if he really didn’t get it, if he really was that incapable of seeing outside of himself.
“Sure, send me an owl. I’m not sure how much time I will have in the next few weeks, with my NEWTs coming up, but if I can find the time, I will happily meet with you.”
“An annoying byproduct,” she said. “The foam has to be skimmed off repeatedly during this next phase of brewing, so the potion can oxygenate. But we’ll wait until it gets a little thicker.”
As Harry came back into consciousness, the fuzzy residuals of his dream slipping away and awareness of the morning light growing, he noted that something felt a little off. Or perhaps not
He knew she was staring at him, but he was looking down at his curry, and he picked up his fork to take another bite.
“I’ve been trying to help, you know?” she told him. “I’ve been researching, trying to learn about accidental magic and what kind could have caused this, trying to find some clue that might point in the direction of an effective treatment but… I haven’t learned anything useful.” To her dismay, the tears were back, and she couldn’t stop them from falling freely. “Nothing I’ve done has mattered at all. It was just a waste.”
Clint leaned in and kissed Kyle under his ear, and it reminding Kyle where they were supposed to be going, and what they would probably do when they got there.
When she sat down Moreau gave her a friendly nod and Dempsey the smallest of sneers, what he could get away with in this crowded room. She was sure he was reserving his bigger sneer and snarky comments for when no one was watching.
Maybe, he realized, as he took Draco into his mouth and felt the blond do everything in his power not to writhe underneath him, he
“Mostly you just need to make sure you have the necessary suit and tie and keep me from going insane on the actual day.”
“All right there, cuz?” he asked, his hand becoming a fist that Scorpius bumped gently with his own before answering.
Strangely, Draco found himself cautious in that regard. He didn’t want to jump right into bed with Harry again, when he really thought about it. That would feel too much liking picking up right where they left off, and that wasn’t what he wanted. He really did want to start over with Harry, even see where this could go
“Why doesn’t he like Dad? He acts like he isn’t even part of the family. Marissa too. He acts really weird around Marissa. He and Grandmother both do.”
Harry considered that. “It must be… difficult to want to do something that your spouse absolutely does not want you to do. She’s pulled in two directions. I’m not saying it’s
Draco’s smile turned sheepish. “Yes, as a matter of fact I do. If I had all day to spend here, I would, you know.”
Harry felt happier, better-rested, and more loved than he had since Teddy had moved in. And this weekend was the icing on the cake.
When she arrived at home she stepped out of the floo and took a few seconds to gather herself. Now, away from the hospital, from her parents, from the Healers, she could start to forget, if she let herself. She could set it aside and be her normally good-natured self. And that was important today.
to do with this wedding, and she appeared to be seeing to every possible detail and, of course, sparing no expense. The fabric for Hermione and Vesper’s gowns, for example, was a special textile of acromantula silk dyed silver-gray and charmed to sparkle like the evening sky. The fabric was called Starlight and was, by Hermione’s estimate, over one hundred galleons a meter. Hermione didn’t know exactly how many meters of fabric were required to make the dress, but whatever the amount, this garment was likely the most expensive thing she would ever wear - second only, perhaps, to her own wedding dress.
Potter’s face registered some confusion of his own, before it dissolved into amusement. “I’m gay,” he said.
.” She dragged the last word out, with almost a mocking edge. “When it comes to relationships he thinks love can heal all things and I should just be honest because that’s what people who love each other do. If we love each other, then we can survive everything.”
“So close,” Draco told his lover. “So close, just a little… just something…” He was reaching and reaching, but couldn’t quite get there. But then a hand found his cock, giving it one gentle stroke, and suddenly he was consumed, pure sensation as his cock pulsed between their two bodies.
He suddenly stiffened, his head thrown back and his eyes shut tight. Draco froze, panicked that he’d done something wrong and not wanting to move again, afraid he’d hurt Harry even more by pulling out.
“It makes me want you again, and we don’t have time for that,” Draco said, licking his lips unconsciously.
He had to do something to keep himself awake. And chatting with Potter, he supposed, was as good an option as any.
“I found them!” called Teddy from the stairs, making the two men separate far too early for Harry’s liking. Still, though Teddy knew there were romantic feelings between them, Harry wasn’t sure how Teddy would react to catching them snogging. It was probably best for Teddy to get used to the idea of them together first.
Babies were certainly good and exciting, but they had plenty of excitement in their lives at the moment. If only they could somehow convince Teddy of that.
“Go!” she cried, and actually made a shooing motion with her hand. “We’ve been through this all before. We’ll check out at the MediStation as usual, and we’ll owl you if we have any questions.”
“Except when the pain reminds you to be better,” he answered. She furrowed her brow. “Like how I treated you, for example, when we were younger. How can I not feel pain, guilt, shame, over that? I hope to never treat someone that way ever again, even accidentally. And I hope you know…” He swallowed, realizing, suddenly, what an important moment this was. He wasn’t sure if he would get the chance this night, to say these things. But it seemed like the right time, with it being just the two of them. So he took a deep breath and continued on. “I hope you know how sorry I am, for all that I said and did. I’m afraid it’s too much to be able to name it all, but especially for the name-calling, the bullying, anything I did that made you feel like you didn’t belong at Hogwarts or in our world. Thankfully you proved me wrong at every turn. You proved a hundred times over what a brilliant witch you are, and I’m glad for that, that my stupid actions and words didn’t hold you back. You were always much stronger than I, in that way.”
“Liam?” Harry asked. “I really did say ‘nightmare child,’ didn’t I?” He sighed. “Perhaps that’s a bit mean. But he was quite… difficult. I imagine because he doesn’t get enough attention at home.”
He checked his watch. He was due back at the staff room to meet Sinistra, and he hurried himself along.
He felt simultaneously like he could stay this way forever, like this could be enough, on its own, and yet also like he was craving more. More touch, more closeness, enough that they just blended together into one being.
Jim/John was like a shadow of Draco’s former lover. Granted, it was a quite buff, arguably prettier version, but he was still a shadow. Yes, his skin was flawless, his face symmetrical, and his body fat percentage some obscenely low number. But he didn’t have Harry’s piercing, knowing eyes or his warm laugh. He didn’t hum with energy the way Harry did. He wasn’t constantly moving, fidgeting, perpetually restless. He didn’t have Harry’s scars or his wisdom. He didn’t have Harry’s brain, and he definitely didn’t have Harry’s heart.
Harry couldn’t help a small smile. “Good,” he said. “I want to get on her good side early. She’ll be my family too, one day, after all.”
Harry stared out over the lake as well, thinking about that. Yes, he had a similar experience of Vesper, but it was in much less romantic terms. But perhaps that was because his heart already belonged to Draco. Or maybe Blaise was more affected by it, because it was something he needed, and was lacking. Now, more than ever, Harry could see where Draco was coming from. He could see how Blaise and Vesper might be good together.
Harry frowned. “Ron’s an overthinker, too, actually. It doesn’t always seem like it because he reacts very emotionally to things, but he also overthinks stuff like this.”
any cases to work on, Ron could get quite snappy and difficult to care for. He would always apologize afterward, when he’d gotten control of himself again. But it was certainly easier when he was willing to accept help the first time around.
things. She liked to move. She’d heard Auror training was physically demanding, and that’s what she was really looking for. If only the morning would go by just a little faster so she could get to that part.
He tucked his diploma under his arm so he could clap for Dean, Ginny and Ron as each of their names were called. They all joined the group with face-splitting grins. Then, finally, Blaise, the last of the bunch, as usual, received his diploma, and McGonagall was silent again, looking out over the crowd. She then threw a proud look at the graduates and said, her magnified voice popping with satisfaction, “Ladies and Gentleman, may I present to you the Hogwarts graduating glass of 1999.”
“Your form is off today. You look sluggish. Perhaps the opponent was just not fast enough for you, hm? Let’s turn it up a level and make you actually work for it.”
“I like topping,” said Harry. “It’s a lot of fun. But I am… curious, about what bottoming feels like.”
Scorpius let out a little surprised noise at that, unable to help it. This was more than he had already known. Draco opened his eyes and looked at his son for a moment, before tilting his head. “Even when we were apart, even when I tried everything in my power to
, Draco, but it does limit you. It’s stopping you from having something really great with Harry, isn’t it, that line of thinking?”
Draco removed the rod, spelled it clean with his wand, and set it down before turning to Harry. His smile was a bit sheepish.
Vesper looked at him some more, and decided it really did seem like he understood. She nodded, then checked her watch. “I have to go to work.”
“Yeah.” Kyle nodded. “For almost three years. Well, we didn’t live together all that time. We were only living together about six months before I moved here.”
“I wish Ginny could be here tonight,” Dean added somewhat wistfully. “It’s absolute rubbish they let us go out whenever we want, but not the 7
When David was in bed that night he heard his mom and dad start to argue and then screaming, and finally just before a door was slammed, crying, or maybe sobbing is the better word.
"Hylo? Which shampoo should we buy?" A young voice asked, so of course, Emily couldn't help but look up, when she saw two children looking for all the world like they haven't a clue what they were doing, she decided she could help. She'd been there after all.
Go big or go home that one psychology student from America had said the afternoon before her final exam. she'd poured a five-hour energy drink and a monster into a travel mug of coffee, shook it up, and proceeded to, quite possibly travel to another realm seeing as she ended staring at nothing for the entire school day, and when they saw her the next morning she said she passed with honors.
I've decided Petunia isn't "horse-faced, and ugly". Because she's one, she's fucking not, her actress looked perfectly lovely, two, and this is just me being Petty @ the fucking casting shithead (WHO KINDA SUCKED SINCE EVERYONE SHOULD BE TEN TO TWENTY FUCKING YEARS YOUNGER ESPECIALLY THE POTTERS WHAT THE FUCK), Petunia is younger than "late forties" in this fic, she is currently in her mid-thirties though because it makes more sense that she's closer given that in the movie the little girl who plays Petunia looks to be really close to Lily' age, so while I've decided to make her look like her actress but younger sure, it's never mentioned, it's unimportant to the story, it doesn't matter really but, I really hate how they aged everyone up, I think the movies would've been so much better had they kept to the actual age of the actors and actresses, not to say they didn't do a damn good performance for the, script, they were given. But still.
