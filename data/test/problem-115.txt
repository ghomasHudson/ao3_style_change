They agreed with him and started talking about something else. Without asking Draco to leave! Oh, he was so gonna yell ‘ah! You see!’ to the hat tonight! That will teach him to believe in the students more!
Draco sat down on the stool, ready for it to be done. But this time the hat actually fell on him. Uh?
"I know… our families have a history." he started, and Weasley’s glare came back "But it doesn’t mean we have to continue it."
They waited with him at the station. Because Draco hadn’t been able to eat anything in the end, his mother asked an house-elf to prepare him a bigger packed lunch for later in the day.
He felt like a champion! Nothing could ruin his mood! Draco fell to his usual place between his best friends. He wanted to hug the world. If that was even possible! Instead he hugged both Greg and Vince’s arms.
The train was too loud for him to relax. He wasn’t sure anymore why he came here. All this just to get messy hair… great.
The pauses were for effect, and his friends were good public. Potter too. Weasley less so, rolling his eyes at the dramatics.
Potter was now looking out the window. So. Unless he impress him with knowledge of the ‘future’ he couldn’t get a reaction out of him, uh.
Once that was done, he left them behind and walked back to Weasley and Potter’s door. Knocked first. To be polite. But didn’t wait for an invitation to enter. Let’s not exaggerate.
He sighed. Looking around was the same scene. He remembered the families, where they were, the easy to guess dynamics, some of the conversations he overheard. It was so boring. Unless he did something, nothing will change then?
Draco sat down with his friends after hugging his parents goodbye. They went on to talk about the same things again. He sighed.
"Guessing you don’t like stars then, Weasley?" asked Draco, but without giving him time to answer, turned to Potter "You?"
Same breakfast. Draco didn’t feel hungry. Pushing his food around on the plate instead of eating it.
Draco heard her scoff as he turned his back to them, but it didn’t matter anymore. His first mission was done! Now, to the much tougher one to beat… actually, he was the one who needed all the luck in this moment!
His mother turned his way "It’s fine even if the hat place you in red." she smiled, but it was clearly forced.
His friends thought he was joking when he told them he had a toad to rescue and a difficult wizard or two to charm.
Couldn’t even be annoyed when Hermione explained how the ceiling works. Almost danced to his way to the hat. Wow, he didn’t even want to go to sleep later!
Weren’t they the same age? Why did she care so much to act like a mother figure to everyone? Weirdo!
He could… tell them again. But was there a point to it? They’d react the same way, and it’ll be boring, and probably nothing will be added. So, yes, it felt weird not to share, specially after it had been so fun yesterday, but Draco really didn’t feel like repeating too much. Instead he let himself slouch over Vince, his favorite pillow. Far more comfortable than Greg.
"What’s with you?" asked Vince next to him with a curious tone. No trace of annoyance or real concern. He liked that about Vince.
This couldn’t keep going on like this. A strong flow of embarrassment took Draco by surprise. He felt like he was about to cry, so he got up and left.
Potter wasn’t hostile to him anymore, which was a good thing. But still talked very little, which wasn’t as good. What would it take to befriend this boy! Weasley seemed to have done it easily, which made it all the more infuriating!
When he looked around him again, the other boys had indeed been talking. Happy to ignore Draco’s presence.
"Alright…" Granger said slowly, looking at them all suspiciously "Whatever is going on here, just keep an eye for the toad, yes? And bring it back to Neville if you find it!"
He waved them goodbye and almost ran all the way to his friends. To tell them he would leave for a while once the train start, but he’d come back to spend some of the ride with them. Pansy pretended to be offended he had things to do. ‘What, we’re not good enough for you anymore? Hmph!’ she said with her arms crossed, looking away from him. Vince, more practical, asked where he was going.
Why did the day need to go on till night, he couldn’t comprehend. Again, Draco found his way to the dorm room. Again the same excited whispers.
"Who’s feeling that?" asked Pansy this time. She had been talking to Blaise until then, so, not paying attention to the rest of the group.
"This is gonna be our room for the next seven years." simply said Draco. As a fact. But also as a revelation.
Draco slid under his sheets. Whispers around him. Dark room. He sighed, almost scared to fall asleep. But it would be fine this time. Had to. This had lasted long enough and he wasn’t really upset anymore? Actually, he had quite a good day, all things considered! So he closed his eyes.
Draco smiled "And I wasn’t really asking you." before turning to Potter "So, tell me! What house do you think you’ll be sorted into?"
Draco went back inside, patting his hair down, but stayed by the door. He didn’t feel like going back to his friends. They’re the best, he loves them, but… how boring!
The two boys inside turned to the newcomers with surprised expressions. One of them worst than the other.
Before anyone had time to say anything, Draco spoke "Later, Granger will come in there asking us if we’ve seen a toad."
It was Draco’s turn to frown. Why was Potter being so difficult to befriend? Draco was making an effort there!
And so he tried. Since houses weren’t a safe subject, they moved to Quidditch. But Weasley had terrible tastes for teams so the two of them started bickering about it, leaving Potter confused as he had never watched a match before. The mood was getting worse.
Well. Draco hadn’t given too good a first impression. In fact, it took him so many tries to get one impression right! Oof!
The novelty wore off in the train, though. Draco didn’t feel like talking about all the same topics with his friends again. But did he even have to? It was a dream after all, so he could do just about anything!
He hoped that had been the only part that had bothered him, because he couldn’t remember every details of that day. But the look Harry had given him then? He’ll never forget it.
Waking up to see his mother face didn’t bother him any longer. In fact, he was glad to be greeted by her smile! She was pretty. And he wasn’t thinking that way only because he was her son. Narcissa Malfoy was graceful in everything she did, like it came naturally to her. Her husband equally proper, making them a fine couple indeed! Draco was very grateful of the genes he received. In a few years, he’ll be splendid! And Potter would be embarrassed to remember there was a time he didn’t like him too much.
If only Potter hadn’t rejected him. And for a Weasley, too! That was way too embarrassing, the memory of it made him squeeze his eyes shut and turn around in his bed like the pain he felt was physical. His muscles itched, heartbeat too fast, and bones shaking. Draco thought he would need to  crawl out of his body to be able to calm down. Which was a disturbing image.
His father looked at her in shock. Draco was conflicted. On one hand, he was glad they didn’t repeat the same boring conversation, and it was nice of his mother to reassure him even if she wasn’t aware of the real problem, but on the other hand… he had to side with his father repulsion on that one. No way he’s accept to be red! Yuck!
Weasley, of course. It was nice to know that at least once Draco wasn’t the reason. He’d like that to happen again.
Vince and Greg slided on the seat to offer him a space. Draco happily fell there. Then, he decided he deserved to be as comfortable as possible. His back leaning on Vince’s arm, and his legs covering Greg’s laps. They didn’t say anything, but he noticed Greg smiling, using Draco’s legs as armrests. It was nice. Yes, he had really needed that.
That seemed to shut him up. Good. Draco was getting really tired of the Weasley shaped problem. If he wasn’t there this would be so much easier… actually!
He could tell they all had a multitude of questions and would probably talk over each other, but it was at this moment that Granger opened the door. The timing this girl had!
Granger started explaining the ceiling and he tuned her out. Then his name was called and he rushed to sit on the stool.
In the great hall Granger explained the deal with the ceiling, and Draco found himself looking up again. Not as pretty as the real thing. But nice enough.
But here was the thing: he really didn’t want to write a letter right now. Or ealier. Most probably not tomorrow either. Which was a problem, because his parents were expecting good news. As soon as possible, they’d asked this morning!
"We know!" Pansy rolled her eyes jokingly "You SO love being right, you found a way to start the day over just to know everything in advance and flaunt!"
Potter hummed while playing with his hands. First difficulty was to make himself so interesting Potter would forget to be awkward. Even just for five minutes!
Luckily, Potter stopped them before it went too far. Silence reigned for a moment, giving them time to calm down.
He had never met a person like Potter before either. His childhood friends all came from families like his own. Their parents were friends, and that’s how they met often enough to grow closer. They all had lots of things in common. The way they lived, the things they ate, the places they would go on holidays.
Draco simply nodded. However that happened wasn’t important right now. Since friendship was secured, he didn’t need to rush anymore. They could grow closer naturally. He wasn’t sure how much time they could spend together, as they wouldn’t go to the same house, but. They’ll make time. If Harry wanted. Him and Ron.
When Harry’s name was called, the room got silent, and the poor boy looked so scared by the reaction. He walked to the stool like he was about to be punished. Draco held his breath for a moment. Would the hat place him somewhere else? Since Harry had the possibilty of being green…
"… Me too." Draco murmured. It felt bad to not honestly feel the same way as his mother. But he hadn’t been given time to miss them yet! It wasn’t his fault!
Draco stayed with the two of them for a while more, almost scared that leaving would bring them back to case one. But it couldn’t, right? So, eventually, he excused himself to join his main group. Last quick promises to talk more at school and he left the compartment.
But was it really sad? He wouldn’t call himself a fan of the predicament he was currently in. Draco really hoped that was the last do-over. Knowing everything that was about to happen, and everything people would say, really wasn’t as fun as some seemed to believe!
Good son he was, Draco did as he was told. Wondering what was happening while taking off his pajama. Maybe it was just dreaming, but it was weird for it to be such a precise memory. Starting to dress up now. Yes but it was a recent memory, so that’s just, um… him processing the previous day? He vaguely remembered a conversation about dreams they once had with his godfather. About how they’re more than just short scenarios to help you pass the night, but in fact had a very precise use. Most of it escaped him. Looking at the mirror now to brush his hair.
"Whatever I say this one feel the need to mock." he said pointing to the other "And I’d like to know you better."
‘This one’ was Weasley, easy enough to guess, but Pansy still felt the need to point him out with her thumb.
Draco crossed his arms and closed his eyes with a ‘hmph!’ in mock anger. He wasn’t mad at his friend for being honest, since he was the one who asked it. But Pansy made him think.
In bed Draco wondered how he could go about it. To win Potter over. The hat had acted like that was the problem in need of fixing for the loop to be over. Which was weird, but ok. A time loop couldn’t possibly be created out of something like that, right? Something so… inconsequential. Sure, that mattered for him. A little. But if others, even if it was just a hat, were aware of the loop, and felt trapped inside of it… well, that really sucked!
"You don’t mind if I sit there of course?" Draco found his way to Potter without waiting for an answer.
"Yes!" said Longbottom with a big smile on his face. As he moved from behind the girl, Draco noticed the animal in his hands "That’s Trevor." he added, voice soft.
And his friends did. He could hear Pansy excited laugh, and Blaise trying to shush her with a smile in his voice that betrayed how close he was to start laughing too. Vince and Greg were silent, walking as close to Draco without getting in his way. Soon they arrived at destination, and Draco opened the door with confidence.
To change the mood, Draco said "Just so you know: I’m so gonna brag to everyone that we’re friends!"
His mother voice woke him the next morning. She had to call a few times until he finally opened his eyes and stretched in bed. Something felt strange, and it took Draco a moment of looking around his room to figure out what the problem was.
The sorting went on exactly the same way. Draco was still disappointed to see Potter go to red. But there was nothing he could have done about this, after all. A shame, really.
But Draco was determined. So when Granger’s hair passed by the door’s window, he got up swiftly and rushed to her and Longbottom.
"Well, I’m bored." Draco decided to be honest "Also, Potter, we already met before! Was the ice cream good?"
A while later, Draco decided to stretch his legs. Further down the passageway he saw Granger and Longbottom opening a compartment door. Did they really bother asking everyone? And why was Granger involved in that? It wasn’t even her toad. Eh, whatever.
Both his parents looked at him strangely, and he took advantage of their confused stiffness to leave his mother’s arms to hug his father just as hard.
"This loop. Sorting the same kids in the same place. Do you still care for green? I could put you somewhere else for a change!"
And with that, he left them to join his friends again. Somehow, he actually was glad they had found the toad. Trevor. Longbottom happiness wasn’t what interested him here. But after a couple of days of them searching, Draco’s could finally put this thrilling mystery behind him.
Technically, today hadn’t been all that bad. He had fun with Vince, Greg, Pansy and Blaise in the train. And then was sorted in green, which wasn’t a surprise. But Draco was proud that the hat had not even needed to be put on his blond head before making a decision! That, he will brag about to his parents for sure.
Draco spent the time on the lake staring at the stars. Which actually ended up giving him an idea! Small one, but at this point he would take all that he could.
It took a moment for Weasley to reply, where he just made more hilarious faces and gesticulated furiously "See what I mean?!" he threw Potter’s way.
The mood got sour so fast. This time, though, Draco didn’t find it in him to blame Weasley for it. Because he was right. Ugh, it did pain him to acknowledge it! But not many had what his parents got for him. And even those who did couldn’t always use it right. So yes, Draco was lucky.
But it paid off, because Harry patted his back just then. Probably for comfort. The way he went about it was a bit weird, though, like he wasn’t sure how it was done. Odd, but Draco didn’t mind.
"Are you alright?" asked his mother before placing an hand on his forehead, checking his temperature.
Granger and Longbottom both jumped at that. Confusion was written on their faces as they noticed the look of shock or amusement of everyone in this compartment.
With that she pushed Longbottom out of the way as he had came closer in hope of figuring out what was going on, and closed the door behind her.
"I just… didn’t like how things went last time." and he meant all the previous times, really "And it kept bugging me so much that… it kinda became an obsession? Like. I was so upset!"
At the train station, Draco looked around. Never before had he noticed Potter or any of the Weasleys in the mess of people. And the Weasleys really stood out with that hair. Maybe they arrived late. That wouldn’t surprise him.
Feeling cheeky, he told them without stopping "I’m the one who kidnapped Trevor. Follow me if you want to see him alive."
Draco thought for a moment. Would it be smart to reveal everything? He already gave a lot away… and Potter was finally interested in him… might as well!
Draco had meant it as a favor. Really! He was trying to be nice here! Sure, he didn’t like the red head, but… since he was Potter’s friend, he had to make an effort.
They brainstormed for a bit longer until they grew bored with it and changed the subject. Draco was glad for it because his head was starting to hurt. His friends had given many good ideas but the problem now was that he didn’t know how to use them in practice. He didn’t know Potter well enough to only talk about his favorite things, nor had he enough time for him to naturally discover Draco wasn’t that bad. What a migraine!
Anger tainted Weasley’s face red. Draco didn’t find it funny anymore. Instead, he felt bad. Why was this part always going wrong!
"Get ready, it’s your big day! I’ll wait for you downstair, don’t take too long." his mother said while pushing part of his hair back.
"Oh, I was serious about the study offer, by the way. Didn’t meant it to brag or anything. So, really, if you need help, I’m here! We could have a study group, with my other friends!"
He sounded so much like a teacher’s pet right now that it was disgusting. Draco was sure he’ll be a good student, polite and studious. No adult will have anything to reproach him. He wasn’t even against pretending to be sweeter than he really was, and compliment his future teachers to be seen favorably… but that was a green thing, not a teacher’s pet thing. Nuance.
"Hmm, yes. Not on the first day of school, though. At first I thought it was fun it went on today! Hoped to sort kids different places. Alas, I was forgetting how stubborn eleven years old kids are."
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at that. He had meant to tell him before, but thought of keeping that ammunition in case Weasley was getting more annoying later. Yet he couldn’t blame Granger of stealing his line, because the blush growing on Weasley’s face as he scrubbed his nose with his sleeve was a hoot. What a tragedy for a red head to grow the same shade as their hair!
Boy and toad were reunited once again. Longbottom actually cried happy tears this time. Maybe Draco shouldn’t have made that joke… oh, well! It had been fun. To him. Granger clearly didn’t feel the same, as she was glaring at him, hands on her hips.
"Jealous? Want the attention all to yourself then?" talking in this position felt weird, as Draco’s chin moved in his hand.
"No, you were making fun of me. Which is rich coming from you. Don’t you also want to be in red because everyone in your family went there before you?"
… He had meant to play the role at school, yes. Since he was so good at it, what a waste not to! Plus, greens had a reputation to hold unto. But that had to be his main problem with Potter. Clearly, the boy didn’t like the mean type. What a pickle!
"Get ready, it’s your big day!" she said happily, and would have continued with the instruction to meet them downstair for breakfast if Draco hadn’t growled. "Well, someone’s in a bad mood!"
The boy sighed. "Nothing really. I just… want the sorting to be behind me and get to class already."
The red head talked about candy and Potter’s face illuminated. A smile growing on his face as his friend listed his favorite sweets and what they were made of.
"Ugh!" Draco paused, remembering how upsetting it all was "He’s befriending the last Weasley as we speak."
Draco crossed his legs and put his chin up. He wasnt about to let Weasley talk to him like that! But Potter hadn’t liked what he said last time, so he’ll have to be more… subtle.
Ah, well. He did change enough things so it wouldn’t be too boring, at least. So could he complain, really…
He tried a bit longer, but Potter just wasn’t receptive. It wasn’t giving up. Absolutly not! But Draco was loosing patience, and it wouldn’t help if he sounded annoyed. So he left the compartment. Hearing Weasley shoot "Finally!" as he closed the door behind him.
Pansy frowned "Since you like to pretend Greg and Vince are your lackeys, ready to beat up anyone who look at you wrong, I’d say yes."
He sat down next to the boy once more. Very close, so there would be space left for his friends. Vince and Greg didn’t wait for an invitation to sit next to him. Weasley was opening and closing his mouth like a fish when Blaise helped Pansy sit by his side. Really, what a fun group!
Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Not just one, but the two of them! Didn’t he struggle so much to get there? Did it matter? No! Because there it was!
"I think I know where he is." Draco said while walking away, an hand wave to invite them to follow him.
Ah, yes. He had be warned this would happen if he failed. Now, a red future didn’t sound like a joke anymore. Draco really had to end it.
When Draco had realized who the boy was, and how lucky that they had met once before, he of course proposed to be friends. You couldn’t go wrong befriending the-boy-who-lived! He was for sure going to get an approving smile from his father for his practical thinking!
"Guess who…" he started by taking a step in the compartment, and giving his audience a twirl "just befriended Harry Potter."
"Get ready, it’s your big day! I’ll wait for you downstair, don’t take too long." his mother said as he sat on his bed.
Draco laughed. While he hadn’t meant for this all to happen… she knew him well. A Malfoy never gave up the opportunity to flaunt.
"Nothing, really. I just hope to have lots of interesting things to write you both. I want to make new friends. And learn new things. And get homesick!"
He was in his father’s arms then. It didn’t last as long. But when he straightened, it was to look at his son in the eyes.
Later, when they were placed four by boats, Draco looked at the stars. He hadn’t paid much attention to them the previous times. They were more interesting than the lake, or the castle growing closer. Shiny pearls in the sky.
The best didn’t happen, because his mother was here to wake him. Well. She was the best mom. So close enough.
Really? He’ll have to win Weasley before going anywhere with Potter? How tiring… Draco slid his hands under his thighs. This gesture helped him feel more comfortable. And he really needed that right now.
Curious, he walked over there, but slowly enough to give them an advance so they didn’t think he was following them or anything like that.
When Draco arrives via Portkey on an early Sunday morning in Scotland, he almost slips in front of Neville’s flower shop. The frosty wind, laced with snowflakes, blows directly in his face.
Over the rim of his glass, he can see Harry looking at him. Wide smile and soft eyes so full of love that it’s almost too much. How is it possible to love someone so much that you’re practically bursting with love and spilling over with happiness? And how is it possible that this is directed at Draco?
“All right. I still need to get dittany from the apothecary to speed up the healing process. I can’t wait to show my lovely wife.”
He tries to recall what his mother told him, humming the song under his breath. The Blacks had made it into a rhyme:
“You don’t send dick pics if you want to say thank you?” Ginny asks at the same time as Pansy says, “Must’ve been quite a shag.”
Since Draco is in dire need of a shower, he goes into the bathroom. He quickly undresses and steps into the tub, pulling the curtain shut.
“Here, get yourself settled, love-ly.” Draco can feel himself blushing at the accidental slip of the tongue. He turns away to grab a couple of pillows off the sofa and hands them to Harry; helps Harry arrange them underneath him before he reaches for the bottle of lube with his free hand. Wiping his hand clean, he opens the bottle again, generously coating his cock with the transparent liquid before he settles himself between Harry’s legs. He guides his cock to Harry’s hole, already dripping wet, and pushes in slowly as he leans forward to kiss Harry. It’s a slow, long kiss, and Harry’s moaning into his mouth as Draco spreads him open; fills him up.
The playful smirk of Potter’s mouth makes the entire situation more embarrassing. He feels caught. Heat rushes into Draco’s cheeks, adding a nice touch of pink to his otherwise pale complexion.
After swallowing the contents of his mouth, Draco inquires, “Why exactly are you so invested in my sex life, Weasley? Isn’t Pansy giving you enough attention?” As soon as the words leaves his bloody mouth, Draco knows they were a mistake.
“Here,” Harry says softly. Draco opens his eyes to find Harry standing right in front of him, a dark figure in outline as he blocks the light from the fire. Harry holds out a glass, half-filled with red wine. There’s another half-filled glass in his other hand. When Draco looks questioningly up at him, Harry adds, “Came back to find a second glass next to mine, together with a second bottle. So please, take it. Since the house is being so accommodating.”
Coaxing the mimosas back to health will be a laborious task, especially since they’re supposed to go out in two days. They’ve soaked up so much of Harry’s negative energy, that a Patronus would be the only way to bring them back to health, spraying them with as much hope and goodness as he can muster. Draco isn’t sure he can perform one right now, though. He’s never excelled at that particular spell.
Potter makes a small, pleased sound, and Draco opens his eyes to see Potter smirking up at him. His gaze is intense, and Potter runs his tongue slowly across his lips until they glisten with saliva. Draco bites his lower lip almost unwillingly at the sight. Apparently, that’s exactly what Potter wanted to see—him, almost completely gone—because Potter, finally, moves in.
“Oh fuck. I hadn’t realised… fuck. This is bad. This is so very bad. Can someone please throw me to the bottom of the Black Lake?” Draco’s hands bury themselves inside his hair.
A gentle knock on the greenhouse door causes Draco to glance up from his kneeling position before returning his attention back to the plants.
“Potter, stop,” Draco interrupts, practically running towards him and batting his hands away. “What in Salazar’s name are you doing to your new shirt?” He casts a quick Ironing Spell to get the worst wrinkles out.
He can’t get out of a sodding room, much less the house. They’ve tried almost everything, and their every attempt has been pointless. He eyes the door balefully, then tells Potter, “step back and take cover.”
Folding his hands around the mug, Draco picks it up to take a sip, trying his best to hide the embarrassment of what can surely be counted as the worst first impression ever.
— in the wrong language. Draco blushes, and it’s impossible for Harry to not have noticed. “Of course,” Draco says again, in English this time.
Potter slides closer, pushing him up against the wall and pressing his very evident erection against Draco, whose own is straining hard against the pants of his grey suit. Potter’s hands slide up over the fabric of his waistcoat; Draco doesn’t even notice that his jacket has come undone. Potter moves back, putting a little space between them so that one of his hands can slide down between them. It brushes gently against Draco’s confined cock. Simultaneously, Potter kisses his way up from Draco’s throat back to his mouth.
He bends down to pick it up, and once he’s standing up again, book safely in his right hand, Draco immediately looks at the door, gauging its distance. He’s about three large steps away. He’s so close; he can almost feel the cool air of the dark passage on his overheated face.
Returning with a stack of boxes, Potter opens the first one and hands the wand to Draco. He puts it down immediately. It feels like the first bit of food touching your tongue and you just want to spit it out. Instant repulsion.
be happening, and Draco absolutely believes Potter when he tells him that he’s not sure why it’s not working, puzzlement etched all over his face. They try to Apparate out next, but get slammed back into the room the minute they do, stunned and dizzy.
“I’m just giving you a dose of your own medicine,” Draco says, a cheeky smile spreading across his face, and when Harry tries to spur him on, he moves up again to capture Harry’s mouth in a quick kiss before saying, “be patient, I’ll make it good for you, I promise.”
“I… I didn’t think of that. I’m really nervous, Draco. I’ve showered three times, but I still feel sweaty and sticky.” Harry slumps down on the edge of his bed.
Potter in nothing but a waist apron. He’s sitting on a sofa, legs slightly spread, and in his right hand, he holds a wand. Probably one he’s made himself.
“What the… Potter—!” Draco yelps, and Potter looks up from the book open in front of him and raises an eyebrow at Draco.
The moment Draco hears the unmistakable sound of wood snapping, he wants to cry. It’s not the first time it happened since he started at St Mungo’s a few years ago, but getting used to a new wand is a tiring procedure.
“You care about me? That’s heartwarming, really.” Draco’s bitter. Not about the fact that Potter’s uncovered his secret, but that Potter’s still pretending to be interested in him.
He’s opening his mouth to speak when you feel a bullet right past your cheek before it enters his skull, splashing blood on your face. Your hands let go of him and you duck for cover.
“I just…” With his free hand, Harry ruffles his hair again. “I just wanted to tell you that, while I don’t usually do things like that, I’m not sorry it happened. And I know you’re leaving, and that we barely know each other, but we only live one Portkey apart and I was wondering if, perhaps, you’d like to have dinner with me on the fifteenth? I’ll be too busy on Valentine’s day.”
“Now you’re lying, darling.” Pansy moves over to Ginny, perching herself upon the armrest of the chair and looking over her wife’s shoulder. “Because we look stunning. I mean, look at this.” She picks up a picture and holds it out to Draco.
As if he has all the time in the world, Harry pushes Draco’s shirt up, mapping the newly revealed skin with delicate touches. Every past encounter pales against what Draco is experiencing now. Each touch — of tongue, of lips, of hands — unravels him, exposing him to Harry. The notion of time and space are completely lost on Draco, who switches between swearing and moaning.
Then, Potter stops touching him. Draco watches as Potter’s left hand moves from his cock to his hips, joining his right hand to hold him in place as the bastard takes his time to slowly run his lips lightly over Draco’s cock, until Draco’s head falls back against the window pane with a resounding thump. Potter’s hands are keeping him from thrusting forward, so he has no chance to get the friction he needs. Draco pants, too lost to be able to form any kind of coherent thought. He can feel sweat forming on his forehead and his neck, and his entire body is on fire.
“You know that wouldn’t work. They’d probably drag me out of here, have a house-elf fix me and my clothes, and throw me back in like prey to a hoard of hungry lions.”
Draco never ever thought he’d be this grateful for having a proper shower. For a couple of minutes, he just stands under the spray, enjoying the warmth, before soaping himself up and rinsing off all the dirt and tension from what has been an excruciatingly long day.
In the flames, he sees a way-too-giddy-and-eager Ginny, and he releases an audible exhale. Relief and annoyance.
Harry smiles, whispers back, “I love you too,” and their lips meet again in a kiss. It’s long, slow, and sweet.
Speaking of which, when Hermione asks him what he’s been up to lately, everybody suddenly falls silent.
Draco would protest if Pansy wouldn’t, in turn, tell him about every time he’s been whining about Potter. So he just smiles.
When that search doesn’t yield anything, Potter folds the left sleeve of his bathrobe up to his elbow, before flicking his wand over his forearm in a sharp gesture. To Draco’s shock, a small cut appears on Potter’s arm, which he then presses against a dirty, cobwebbed stone.
The tension in Potter’s body is obvious, but there’s also something else. If Draco hadn’t known Potter any better, he would have said that Potter was shy, was out of his depth. But that’s so unlike him. The Potter he’s come to know is casual and flirty, has flings with ex-Death Eaters, and lounges around in his bathrobe on a rug.
Truth be told, it’s still a mystery to Draco why she’s so excited about the prospect of her ex dating him. If he were in her shoes, he wouldn’t want to hear anything about that. Sure, Potter has since then figured out that he’s gay, but shouldn’t it still be weird? Ginny has been nothing but supportive on the matter.
It’s not that he sees Harry as any less of a man because he enjoys being fucked by him. It doesn’t make him “the woman in the relationship” or any such nonsense; that’s some heteronormative bullshit, and Draco knows it. Despite that, applying the same notions to himself doesn’t work, although it makes no bloody sense.
“That woman is insane. She asked me yesterday if we can dip the carnations in Amortentia and decorate the church with them. Also, who wants yellow carnations at their wedding?”
Draco tries his best — and fails — at holding back, not wanting it to end so soon. However, Harry’s skilled hand has them both spilling in what feels like the blink of an eye.
Draco holds up a hand to cut him off. “Stop right there. You’re just saying these things because of the situation we’re in right now. You're stressed, and you're not yourself. You wouldn’t say this under normal circumstances.” Draco’s firm, almost fierce as he says it. He can’t allow his heart to cling to even the smallest spark of hope, or he’ll just be crushed again.
Draco thinks about it, but he’s embarrassed himself in front of Harry more than once already, and since dinner tonight will undoubtedly give Draco plenty of chances to add to this tally, he won’t go anywhere near the man until then.
The sound of their footsteps echo off the stone walls as they walk further down the passageway. Draco proceeds down the narrow path first, turning back occasionally to check on Potter’s progress. He doesn’t want to leave Potter behind, but he doesn’t want to allow Potter to get too close either. This past year has taught him as much: even in the most infuriating of circumstances, Potter has always managed to sweet-talk his way into Draco’s pants. Potter’s face may look innocent—all soft edges compared to his own—but Potter’s mouth is another story...
Potter hastily heads back over to the rug to put on his new bedroom slippers—golden, with a fluffy red lion’s head attached to the front of each. They’re ghastly, but for some reason they remind him of Luna and the Lion-topped hat she used to wear whenever Gryffindor played a Quidditch match.
He opens his mouth but then realises that he doesn’t know what to say. Draco has thought about it more than once, but there’s this voice inside of him. It never shuts up, not really. Sometimes, it’s quieter, sometimes it screams at him, but it’s always in the background. Haunting him.
Pansy’s words are totally lost on him. Draco stands in the doorway for two seconds, glancing back to the folder on the table before pulling the door shut.
Maybe he should make an attempt and get it out of his system. It might end Draco’s current obsession… or… or it could spread like a virus in his body and ruin their newly found friendship. Anyhow, that’s not even an option. Despite what his reputation proclaims, Draco isn’t one for casual sex or one-night stands. Except for the night in the club.
Three steps later, he feels Potter’s fingers brushing against his own in a silent question. Draco pauses, and in that brief moment, Potter seizes the opportunity to interlace his fingers with Draco’s. Draco looks down at their joined hands, then up at Potter. There’s a small smile on Potter’s face, and he only tightens his grip when Draco tries to shake his hand out of Potter’s. They engage in this silent war for a few furious seconds, until Draco gives it up as a lost cause.
The surrounding air is buzzing. Draco knows he has to diffuse the situation because they’re standing next to the batch of magical mimosas for St Mungo’s. “Harry, please calm down.”
either, but he can feel himself getting swept away and not just because of the rhythm of the music. He can’t seem to look away from Potter, those magnetic green eyes, the seemingly soft skin of his cheeks, his lips.
Draco bites his tongue to prevent himself from voicing his comment and says something else instead. “It was a patient. They sneezed so hard they flew across the room and into my wand. But I promise I’ll take better care of this one.”
Draco can’t resist. He spreads his fingers slightly, looking between them to make sure that—yup, it’s still on display. “For fucks sake, Potter. Adjust your robe.” He looks down at the floor, feeling his cheeks light up,
whatever it is that you want to tell me. When you're finished, we should try to open the door again. I have better things to do than spend my evening stuck in here with you.”
Draco downs the rest of his whiskey and taps the empty glass before levitating the bottle over for a refill. It’s not like he’s ever been good at talking about feelings; actually gloating about his conquests is more his style. Or at least that’s what he usually lets people believe. A carefully built façade.
Draco puts the bowl down on the coffee table. He looks over to Pansy, and she reads what’s on his mind as if she’s cast Legilimens. They always had this talent to communicate without words.
With every thrust into you, your hate reaches new heights. It’s a firestorm. The flames flaring higher until he stops for a second. You’d swear if you could. If you wouldn't crave it when he's not there.
“Don’t tell me what to do when you can’t even manage to bring a bunch of blossoms to the bakery on time, which is literally next door. Instead, I have to come over here, forcing me to close my shop because Lavender is sick and nobody could help out. I have three wedding cakes to make, and one of the brides changes her opinion on the style and flavour in between owls. I. Need. Those. Fucking. Blossoms!”
The wide smile on Potter’s face bodes nothing good. “I have a special task, just for you,” he says and puts a green bag next to Draco.
Draco really could’ve lived without the images invading his brain. After quickly glancing at Ginny’s thigh again and seeing there’s only a faint red mark left, he gets up and takes a seat next to her. Pansy has occupied the armchair across from them and poured herself a huge glass of red.
As it turns out, he can’t do this. Two hours later, he wraps himself in a blanket and makes his way to Harry’s flat, which is conveniently located above the bakery.
Draco’s eyes drop to the floor, hoping Potter will take this as a sign to leave, but there’s a pair of lace knickers on the dark wood.
After Flooing to Hogwarts post-Malfoy family Christmas dinner, Draco needed some fresh air. On his way outside, he’d literally bumped into Potter as he was checking the corridors.
Coming clean about his alcohol-induced memory loss didn’t cause the anticipated break-up. Quite the opposite.
They resume their walk back to the library. Potter breaks the silence first. “So, you said this was because of the house? What’s up with it?”
They try the windows next—the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows that take up one entire wall of the library, with a cosy window bay piled high with a mishmash of colourful cushions. It is—it
“All right,” Draco sighs, resigning himself to his fate. “What can I do to get you out of here as quickly as possible?”
Any protest is cut short by the sound of a ringing bell when Neville opens the door. After exhaling audibly, Draco resigns and follows suit. Upon entering, he glances at the door.
They try a few others, and with every single one, Draco’s faith in Potter’s abilities sinks. Ollivander has years of experience under his belt by the time Draco bought his first wand, but he’s always had the right instinct.
"A pureblood witch, I presume?" Severus asks with a little smile, but Draco frowns. Was he supposed to like a girl? He wrinkled his nose. That didn't sound very pleasing. Girls were loud and...
The god of sadness leaves after that. He has to visit subjects as well and the god of happiness hopes, that he has one day more work to do than his brother. For now, he resigns himself to his task. The subject is sleeping soundly and the other human watches him. The god inclines his head in confusion. There is no danger the human would have to fear, as the subject is asleep, so he wouldn't have to watch him dream. But Harry Potter, the god decides to call him now, is looking at the subject with an unusual expression. It's not quite a smile, but it's also no frown. It's no suspicion. Maybe resignment? Content? The god isn't quite sure, but he sees potential in this human.
"It's a boy," he says then and looks hesitantly at Draco. He considers Harry carefully but lets a small smile grace his lips.
He fought in the war at Potter's side. He never knew him personally, but he was proud to call him a comrade. They even shook hands occasionally on different events, but now he regretted even looking at the man.
was pretty good for your age. In the end, your mother insisted and you finished school in America. But Hogwarts was still your home and the castle stood magnificent, housing hundreds of children, once again heaven of safety.
Healing the slash took a lot of time. For the first five months, Draco was utterly useless. The sixth month was littered in screaming matches with his friends and distructive behavior. He thanked God for his house elves or he would have no dishes to eat of. After he got over his self pity and anger, he was just sad. Wondered, why he wasn't good enough, what prompted Harry to leave, if it was something that he did. Pansy advised him a mind healer. Draco thought, it was bullshit.
"Can... can you show m-me?" Draco whispers and Blaise nods. So he gets up to get the Pensieve he snatched from his father and when he comes back, Blaise already has the memory in a vial. He opens Draco's hand and lays it inside.
"Just sit down, Malfoy," she said and she sounded tired. Draco shrugged again and secured the wand holster on his arm. Granger was fast with her wand, he remembered, and he didn't want to be on the receiving end of the Bad-Bogey-hex the Weaslette taught every student in the DA. If Granger noticed, she didn't comment.
You turn back to Longbottom, finding him staring at you instead. You flinch unintentionally, but he shrugs it off.
"It's a new beginning. We should celebrate," she announces one day at supper and the students begin to whisper and plan.
"Do you think, it's dangerous?" she asks and Harry hands it to her. She takes her wand out to perform a few examination spells. Draco watches her with distaste. His letter isn't dangerous! It's a bloody love letter! Harry gets thousands every month! After Hermione cast every charm she knew, she put her wand away satisfied.
The god of happiness laughed. His brother was indeed the root of his problems with his subjects most of the time, but he knew better than to resent him for that. It was his brother's job and even if he could express resent, he didn't want to.
," he spats her name like a curse, "but I didn't know, how to help you. I guess I was just a coward. Still am, probably. Still, I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. Terribly sorry." he ends and squeezes Potter's hands. He can't bring himself to look him in the eyes anymore, afraid to find disgust or worse
"But why not?" you ask pouting. And Potter takes Malfoy's hand and stands up. He looks down at you and the sneer on his face put's Malfoy's almost to shame.
but he refuses to let Harry see that. Harry shifts his legs so they're across each other and tugs Draco's hand into his lap. He plays a little bit with his fingers until he has found some courage to talk again.
"Ah yes, young love, wonderful," Severus tries to soothe him and cover his mishap, but Draco glares at him. Why was everyone set on making him believe, that his feelings weren't valid? His friends teased and made fun of him and even his godfather didn't take him seriously. How was he going to get Harry to notice him if the approval of his social circle was all Draco could think of?
"That was so much fun!" Draco said and clapped his hands. He was still feeling giddy with pleasure and Harry smiled, pleased.
"Now let's see, how he takes Judas," Potter said and that was the point he wished, he died in the war instead.
"He'll notice, if I give you more, sorry," Malfoy whispered and he followed the line of his wand. His hand was shaking. Then there was a muffled sound from above and Malfoy stiffed.
"You really have to call me Harry," he says then and mischief blinks through his glasses. Draco chuckles.
"I have water, but I can't give you much," Malfoy continued, looking over his shoulder, listening to any sounds. Seemingly satisfied, he turned back and cast an
Mother was looking at him impatiently and gripped his arm a little tighter than necessary, but he endured it with an easy smile.
"Who is your partner then?" you ask and you sound a tad desperate. Potter doesn't seem to pick up on that. Small miracles.
"Yeah, you better be scared! I warned you, I fucking warned you, didn't I?!" she sneered, "I warned you, what would happen if you ever dared to hurt him." A sinister smile crept on her face. "I will enjoy it, I assure you."
"It's fine," he croaked and Malfoy attempted a weak smile, that died the instant the dull sound came again from above.
"May his Highness Prince Harold find a partner for the dance," a page said and Draco glanced up, observing Harold standing up swiftly, walking through the masses, which parted as if he was Moses and couldn't quite stop gaping as the Prince came to stand before him.
"And your mother?" Draco asked weakly, stripped off all his defenses. But Harry always had that effect on him.
"Ah yes, of course. You can still call me Alex," you assure him, but he doesn't seem to listen. His attention is on a man, who strutting down the stairs as he owns them, looking as haughty and pureblood as they come. You can't shake off the feeling, that you know him from somewhere. Potter seems ecstatic to see him though.
. He counts it out in his head as his eyes travel across the books, before landing on a thick volume of astronomy. Draco rolls his eyes again. The Blacks couldn’t have been  more obvious if they tried.
Two years ago, they’d done it for the first time when Harry visited Draco in rehab after Draco had sent him letters. Harry remembered the black piano in the common room and the hours they spent behind it. Not just singing but confiding in each other.
Potter wraps both hands around the handle and pulls back with all his might, straining. He might as well have been tugging on Excalibur embedded in solid stone for all that does. He jiggles the handle again, his face creased in a frown, and kicks the door hard in frustration. The door shudders against the force of the blow, but remains stubbornly closed. Potter curses, rubbing his foot, and turns.
He manages to shut the door as you’re taking the last steps. You hold your breath and wait. One. Two. Three. Four. Then you kick the door open for dramatic effect. Nothing gets their focus back to you like the sound of a metal door banging against the nearest object.
Draco risks a glance into the mirror, but besides his slightly green complexion, his body is free of marks. No hint of what happened last night. He should be happy about this. In the past, he’s always cursed the bastards forcing him to heal bruises they left behind. And if there are no marks, he can push all the memories aside and not think about it again. However, instead of relief and happiness, sadness claws on his insides.
“I’m not doing anything to the door, Draco.” Potter reaches past him to jiggle the handle. The door doesn’t budge, and Potter’s eyebrows lift in surprise. “What the—”
Draco furiously waves his wand in an attempt to finally succeed and be out of here. He doesn’t want to hear Harry saying thank you for last night, followed by a goodbye. Draco knows it’s pathetic, but he has no idea how to deal with emotions like these.
“Or else?” Potter raises an inquisitive eyebrow. “Are you threatening me?” His tone is playful, but there’s a challenging look in his eyes.
“Okay okay,” Draco chuckles, raising his hands in defeat, “you win. Now take your hands off poor Ginny here, you horrible woman.”
Ginny huffs out a laugh. “You have to be a bit more specific. The plant lover, the Hufflepuff, or the gay one?”
anyone to dance. Draco resolves to stay in his corner until he is literally dragged onto the dance floor.
Draco furrows his brows in confusion, but then, suddenly, it hits him. The man who’s just brought him a hot chocolate,
Ginny was still alive, surviving the surgery against all odds. But they all had lost someone that night. A friend, best friend, or girlfriend.
Heavy footsteps make their way over to him, and with every single one of them, Draco’s heart beats just that little bit faster in his chest. It’s just the nerves after what happened earlier, nothing else.
“I’m not." Potter looks a little angry, and a little sad. Then he does something completely unexpected. He squeezes himself into the small space between Draco and the windows, and laces his fingers with Draco’s again. He turns towards Draco, leaning forward until there’s barely an inch separating them. In a soft, tender voice, Potter speaks the words. The words that Draco had spent countless hours in his bed at night obsessing over, trying not to think about, because the idea that Potter might feel the same had seemed preposterous.
Draco’s heart is beating so hard, he’s scared it’ll leap out of his chest. Strands of hair are sticking to his forehead, and there’s still a chance Potter will bail on him. There’s honestly no reason why he wouldn’t. Potter agreed to help him weeks ago and has never spoken of it since then.
Potter licks the first drop of precome from Draco’s cock, his tongue flicking across the head, before he places his lips around the tip and takes Draco’s cock into his mouth. He begins to suck slowly, lightly; his hand loosely gripping the base of Draco’s cock as he does.
“Draco, can we talk? Please?” Potter places one hand tentatively on Draco’s back, which he shrugs off in an impatient gesture.
Draco presses a kiss to Harry’s damp forehead. “It’ll be all right. And maybe afterwards, I finally get to see you naked. You have no idea how much I wanted to jump you in Madam Malkin’s when you tried these robes on.”
Draco’s head is spinning when he goes in for another, and another, because the feeling of those incredibly soft lips on his is terribly addictive. So addictive that the need for oxygen becomes an afterthought. He can’t remember the last time anyone kissed him like this, or if anyone ever has.
He sucks in an involuntary breath as he feels Potter’s lips descend upon his neck. A second later, Potter ups the ante with his hands—his big, strong hands, which have started massaging Draco’s shoulders. A slow shiver begins to make its way down Draco’s neck and over his entire body. As always, Potter knows just exactly what to do to get him all worked up; knows exactly which of Draco’s buttons to push to have him helpless and at the mercy of his marvellous, magical hands.
Draco first ran into Neville at a Healer symposia a few years back. His speeches on herbal and plant-based remedies caught Draco’s attention, and since then, they’ve shared many conversations over lunches and dinners during similar events. For hours, Neville has spoken about the plants — some truly rare — in his greenhouses. While Draco is familiar with most of them because his mother tended to them at Rosier Villa, he’s been itching for so long to see Neville’s collection. Now, he finally gets to see them with his own eyes.
Harry’s green eyes widen in shock, which is when Draco realises that this is the first time that he’s called Potter by his first name. Harry stays there, smiling at him happily.
If Lucius could see him like this, he’d be ashamed. This, after all, is not how the heir of the Malfoy family should behave. Draco has been raised to be in charge of every situation, to hide his emotions behind a mask of indifference, but around Harry, Draco simply forgets to put it up.
The back door, when he tries it, is unlocked. It swings open to reveal a long corridor shrouded in shadow, and Draco blows out his breath in an exasperated sigh when he throws a small twig he’s just picked up over the threshold—and it isn’t instantly blasted to bits.
The moment Finnigan gets up and clears his throat, Draco really wishes Harry had brought the Invisibility Cloak.
They share a mousse au chocolat and even feed each other. It’s disgustingly sweet, and Draco cannot stop grinning. They’re done hiding. The whole wizarding world knows that he’s the one who won Harry Potter’s heart, and if anyone has a problem with that, they can go fuck themselves.
Draco looks out of the window to the night sky beyond the cold panes of glass: an endless expanse of dark blue, dotted with faint glowing specks that represent the few stars that still remain visible despite the light pollution of the city. He shifts into a more comfortable posture and lets his head fall back gently against the wall, his eyes slowly drifting closed. Draco sighes, a long, weary sigh. He’s drained, and his body is stiff from all the spells that he had just cast.
Draco’s manager was against it; Blaise supported his best friend, but even he had doubts about the whole thing. It was too soon. Ron and Hermione were currently in the hospital, waiting for Ginny to wake up. Harry had no idea how to fill her in on what happened, how she would react when she heard the news. Her state remained critical, still in a medically induced coma.
When Harry is done yelling, the leaves of the mimosas have shrivelled and turned a dismal shade of brown.
Draco takes a sip from his beer, hoping Harry will take the hint. Naturally, he doesn’t, forcing Draco to eventually break etiquette. He picks up a slice of pizza and takes a small bite.
"Wai— Oh fuck. Wait, Draco," Harry pants. Of course, Draco stops. Harry pulls Draco’s hand out of his joggers before gently beckoning Draco to turn to lie on his back. “Let me,” he whispers, his lips hovering close to Draco’s but not kissing.
The entire time, Harry’s face was trained on Draco. He might still go off the stage, and Harry knew he would follow him. No matter what people would think or how much their publicists might hate them. But, of course, his incredibly strong boyfriend only released a few shaky breaths before looking at him and giving him the signal to start.
Draco can feel himself blushing, two guilty spots of colour rising on his cheeks. It’s almost unbearably hot with the fire heating up the room and him still wearing his heavy cloak. Taking it off, however, would send the wrong signal; would give Potter entirely the wrong idea about why he’s here.
to help her. There's this overwhelming guilt hanging over him, the notion that her poor condition is ultimately his fault. It follows him like a shadow everywhere he goes.
A sudden sharp turn thankfully breaks Draco’s train of thought. More torches burst into light in front of them, revealing a short flight of narrow stairs. They walk carefully down the staircase and, after taking another turn, find themselves standing in front of a stone wall. Potter frowns and steps past Draco to stand in front of the wall, his hands moving across the cold stones in search of something.
He and Draco had worked on this song the night it happened. Waiting quietly on a chair while their friends were in surgery hadn’t been for them, so Harry had made use of his celebrity status and gotten them a room in the hospital where they could play some music together. This song just came to them as they’d messed around with Harry’s guitar.
“Sorry mate, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Neville apologises, the hint of an amused smile on his face. Neville lets go of Draco as soon as he can stand upright. “Shall I introduce you?” he asks, nodding in the direction of the baker.
As the finale crests, Potter steps forward, bending Draco over in a theatrical dip, and Draco takes the opportunity to tilt his chin upwards, clearly indicating a kiss. Potter’s eyes widen, his pupils getting big and dark, and he leans down to meet Draco halfway.
“Dressing, for fuck’s sake. It’s impossible to get these tiny fuckers through the holes. I can’t believe you convinced me to buy it. It has more buttons than Snape’s sleeves.” Harry moves his hands to his shirt again, but Draco is quicker, using a wordless spell to close them.
Harry had also told Draco about his mother and father brutally murdered in their own home after an invasion. The picture of her dead in front of his crib had been in the news for ages.
He lets the glass sway gently in his hand, watching the wine swish around in the inside of the glass like a mini vortex. From the corner of his eye, he spots Potter setting his glass down on the wooden floor with a soft
He finishes running through the list of new Unspeakable spells, all of which light up the door in a variety of different colours as they sink into the wood. He tries the handle again, jiggling it impatiently, but the door stays firmly shut and, very annoyingly, remains impervious to both the spells and Draco’s glare. He taps a finger against his chin as he thinks.
The memory of it is distant, foggy. His finger traces the lines absentmindedly, the simple outline. He can still feel the ghost of the raised lines on olive skin, the dark, unruly hair slipping through his fingers. Can almost taste the beer and whiskey on his tongue. Draco remembers how the loud music faded into nothingness, replaced by the sound of their combined moans. The way they moved together. How
Harry exhales. “Okay. You get in, and I’ll check it out.” Harry steps aside and lets Draco into his flat. “Bathroom’s to the left; feel free to take a shower. Towels are on the shelves.” Draco watches Harry grab a shirt from the floor, slip it on, and then he’s out the door, leaving Draco all by himself in a foreign flat.
“No.” He laughs. “That wasn’t my original plan at all. I had just gotten out of the shower when the wards chimed and informed me that you had entered the house.”
Humming appreciatively, Harry beckons him to lie on his side. His hand slides over Draco’s skin, carefully finding his way between Draco's thighs. Draco doesn't know when he cast a Lubrication spell, but Harry slicks up the inside of Draco’s thighs, then slides his cock between them.
And if that won’t take the nighttime fantasies Draco has had since their crafty day to a whole new level…
And now Draco experiences it first-hand. Hands, lips, and tongue elicit the most unflattering sounds from him. He mentally claps himself on the shoulder for casting a wandless Silencing Charm the minute the door was locked.
“You're so beautiful,” he murmurs, more to himself, but Potter hears him nonetheless and smiles. He steps closer, placing one hand on the small of Potter’s back as he pulls their bodies together. He can feel Potter’s hard erection brushing occasionally against his own. His other hand moves to Potter’s lips, his thumb brushing over them before he slides his hand to the nape of Potter’s neck. He leans in to kiss Potter. Potter parts his lips, and Draco mirrors him, welcoming Potter’s tongue inside his mouth with a quiet, pleased moan.
"I came to tell you that Dudley is currently fixing the boiler. He'll be done before Neville is back tonight."
Ginny sighs. “We thought you knew. Harry has always been obsessed with you, and you have always been focused on him. You spent a night making hundreds of buttons to get his attention, for crying out loud. It seemed only natural that something would happen at some point, you know?” After Draco nods, she continues, “We only realised that you didn’t remember it when you were shocked about Harry being gay. Harry has told me about the night at the club, and Pansy overheard it when she’d come home. What were we supposed to do?”
The entire situation is bizarre. Draco tries to wrap his brain around what’s happened over the last forty-eight hours. He went from being a Healer in France to standing in Harry Potter’s flat, getting dressed for their dinner tonight. From an outsider’s point of view, this would probably sound very much like he’s going on a date with Harry.
Her eyes go wide when she opens the upper one and takes a good look at the first picture. “Merlin and Morgana. You look fucking delicious, Draco. I want to take a bite out of you.”
Draco feels heat crawling up his neck and he’s glad he can blame it on the warmth in the greenhouse.
Reaching for your wand, you apparate straight to the rooftop of the other building. Malfoy is all that remains; no other leads. He’s been hired either by the man’s boss to monitor him or by their rival.
“Harry just came by and told me to give you this,” she says by way of greeting, handing him a steaming mug of heaven-sent coffee. “He also warned me, because Amanda Keane owled him again.”
The fire is still warm, but it’s not as blazingly hot as before. The flames are smaller, painting the room in a darker shade of orange, shadows flickering on the wall. He scans the room carefully, and realises that more pillows and blankets have appeared—heaped on the sofa in a small mountain.
Since he started at Hogwarts four years ago, there’d been no time or people to date. Then Potter came last year after quitting the Aurors, and Draco found himself eyeing his new colleague very closely, discovering in the process that the man was sex on legs.
Before Draco can even process the meaning behind her words, Ginny steps through the flames, grabs his hand, and drags Draco to her house.
Draco’s prepared for this. He’s had the cover story set in his mind for years now, ever since he started training to be an Unspeakable. He opens his mouth to agree—and is surprised by the next words that come out of his mouth. “Come on Potter, do you think the Ministry would officially buy Potions from a convicted Death Eater? Are you really so naive?”
“Alright, let’s cut the bullshit Draco. I’ve had four days to study your book. At first glance, they look a lot like a Potions Master’s notes, I’ll give you that.” He takes another sip before he sets the glass down again on the floor, and slides down the long cushioned bench of the bay window towards Draco’s direction. “But I’ve watched you today. You’ve cast intricate spellwork, unfamiliar charms, and offensive spells. And then there are the coded notes in that little book of yours.”
There is, of course, no one around to hear him, much less reply to his grumbling, which is lost to the quiet shadows that loom down the garden path leading to the back door of Grimmauld Place. As he makes his way over, he notes absently that the forsythia bushes that they planted by the back door are just coming into bloom. The flowers are almost unearthly white, shining bright in the last bit of daylight. Draco lingers for a quick second to breathe in the mild, honey scent that fills the evening air. It’s a sad reminder of happier times, before Draco wanted more than Harry could give.
The moment after Apparating, when your head is still spinning, while your body is standing on solid ground, has always been your Achilles’ heel. Malfoy slides out of your grip and pins you face-first to the wall. Your attempt at regaining the upper hand comes to an abrupt halt when you feel a cool metal blade on your cheek, near the existing scar.
Draco turns to his side, pulling the blanket over his face. He's not at all ready to come to terms with being in the bed of another man with whom he’s cuddled. The consistent ticking of the clock makes him check the time. Six fifty-one. He should get up and eat. There are many deliveries to send out.
It’s also possible that Draco just likes the way Harry solely focuses on him when he speaks. Maybe he likes it a tad more than he should.
He feels like an intruder, and technically he is one. Potter hasn’t invited him over, and from the looks of things, Potter isn’t home. He usually spends Friday evenings at Granger and Weasley’s place. This makes it easy for him to grab what he’d accidentally left behind in the library the last time he was here and leave quietly. It’s a simple, clear plan, and the hardest obstacle—getting into the house—is already behind him.
“Hey.” Harry put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. He felt thinner, even bonier than usual. Harry knew Draco had barely eaten anything since
Harry arches off the rug in a long moan and pants hard when Draco finally brushes his fingers over that sweet spot. His voice is hoarse, his legs trembling as they dangle over Draco’s shoulders.
On the foot of the bed, Harry perches, keeping her eyes shut the entire time. She can feel every touch of Gemini's fingers going dusting her face. The blond girl's warm breath brushes across her face and Harry tries her best not to fidget.
"Three days or so," he tells her. He glances over pointedly at Gemini, clearly curious. "She's been coming in and out since you got here. Sometimes she just lies there and cries until she falls asleep."
Yet right now she's simply glad she's alive, so she twists herself to fit her head in the crook of Gemini's neck, staying there and continuing to feel safe, and to continue to
Harry is stunned. The Slytherin guides her away, gliding her into another crowd and away from Macmillian before she can catch a second to breathe.
She writes to Dumbledore about breaking the statute of secrecy to tell her aunt about magic. Since she's technically a sort of guardian, he agrees. Aunt Lorraine suggests using magic to clean up the whole place but when Harry says she can't she just takes it upon herself to clean the whole flat.
Confused, she brings a hand up to her eyes and pulls it back to see it wet. “Oh. I’m crying,” she mumbles to herself, crumpling the letter up in her hand. Damn. She’s going to do this now? Today? Wasn’t a Malfoy supposed to be rude and stuck-up? Why was Gemini thinking so lowly of herself?
It's only when she returns to her dorm she dares to rest a fist upon her chest to check her heartbeat. It's still going at an erratic pace as if it's trying to associate this feeling with Gemini forever.
And yet her face was smaller: a greater deal more delicate, features rounded and softened and feminine. Harry drew back to examine her face. All in the same, but
"Don't follow me, 'Mione. If Ron cared so much he'd be the one following after me," she mumbles, quickly walking away so Hermione can't get a word in.
"I could kiss you right now," she says, smiling innocently. Harry feels her insides melt in one fell swoop.
"If you can make yourself look more like a woman, can you find a way to not have my voice break? The other boys in my year already have theirs starting to deepen and I don't want that. It terrifies me," Harry went on, embarrassed. "I really don't want it."
"That's right." She leans against the door frame, glancing nervously at Harry, as if she was waiting for her to go on, waiting for something crude or judgmental to slip out.
"Hermione is Krum's date, so we need to wait outside by the door for everyone else to go in first. It's for the champions' entrance," she tells him as they saunter down the hall.
She manages to clean her tears away just in time to go down for breakfast without looking like a wreck. She doesn’t feel too terrible yet. The terrible feeling will come later, probably, and in full force. But she needs to celebrate her first good birthday, so she puts on her favourite dress and goes out the door. It slams shut with a bang from the unnecessary strength.
Like a stunned goldfish, all Harry could do was to gape dumbly at him, the boy in front of her uncharacteristically silent. A whole bunch of retorts begin formulating in her head. ‘Are you a sissy, Malfoy?’ or a damning ‘Crossdresser much?’  Maybe even a ‘Did you steal this from a girl, you pervert?’
Harry is prepared for this, so she pulls the letter from her pocket, passing it to Malfoy. The girl reads through the letter quickly. "I'm afraid my mother won't have an answer for that. She told me that since Malfoys always have sons as firstborns, she didn't think of any other names, really. There's not a lot of constellations in the sky, you know. So she just picked a name she liked from the beginning and stuck to it."
She's dutifully kept the book unopened until now, so she cracks it open to take a look. If it's possible she could find herself a nice name. She's pretty certain she hasn't known a single person except for Aunt Lorraine whose name is the way it is because they chose it.
Her makeup is simple except for a bold red lip colour. Parvati manages to tame her hair into something much less frizzy, using a series of charms that will only last a few hours. Again she's plaited it in low braids, this time with green ribbon. It's a look she's been sporting every challenge since the Triwizard tournament. It would be illogical for it to stop at the ball.
"You're strange," Malfoy says, evidently puzzled. "Even stranger than I thought you were. Also, if you know you’re a transgender girl, why haven't you told everyone yet?"
There is silence for roughly ten seconds– she starts counting after the third second– Merlin, this classroom is awfully dark, isn't it? She wishes she could see the expression on his face. All she can do is claw at her hair and she wishes she had grown it out, even if it wouldn't be smooth and silky and straight like Malfoy's just so she'd have something more substantial to tug on.
Before Aquarius leaves, she smooths his ruffled feathers, leaning forward to give it’s head a kiss. "Take this to Malfoy for me," she whispers, and the owl coos.
Professor McGonagall tasks her with delivering a scroll to the Slytherin Head of House. Apparently the house elves would be indisposed because they had to prepare for the stupid ball. Harry just about had it with it at this point. And she had to go straight into the lions' den where the Slytherins were. Snape also counted as one of those slimy lions, by the way.
"A secret?" Ron wrinkles his nose, the freckles scattered on his face crinkling together. "You and that ferret aren't friends now, are you?"
Harry's gaze drifts to the floor, then to Gemini. Technically it should be impossible for her to see Gemini, but she does it anyway. “I’m glad you’re here. I…” She licks her pink lips, distracted, as if there’s a whole bunch of things she wants to say, but yet no other words come out.
She finds out that by writing whatever she wants to say to Gemini in a book, it alleviates whatever horrible sickness that she has. If you could consider missing someone a sickness. But there is homesickness, so Harry presumes this must be the person equivalent.
Hm. It's not a very inspirational revelation, and it sort of disappoints her that unconsciously, she feels this way. Her self-esteem isn't that fucked up, surely? But she can live with it.
Harry's dancing with the loveliest girl in the whole world like it's second nature to them. Learning how to lead just so she could dance with Gemini. Everything feels slick over with a mesmerising, dreamlike haze; she wants to submerge herself in it. The world falls away with scary ease and she revels in what is left behind.
Immediately a pair of lithe arms are thrown over her, pulling her into a tight, crushing hug. Harry returns the hug with just as much intensity, burying her face into Gemini's shoulder and taking a deep hiss of breath. Gemini seems to deflate underneath her, but her hold is still unyielding.
Malfoy sits down next to Harry and it takes all of the self-discipline in her spirit to try and not stare in her direction. They're squeezed close together in this small corner. It's as if her brain is transfigured into a pool of goo. Up this close, she can smell Malfoy's body wash and it smells a lot like cotton candy. It's becoming increasingly difficult for Harry not to drown in it. Leaning over to run a finger down a page of names, Malfoy grows ever closer, impossibly so. She's been casting cosmetic charms whenever she spends time with Harry, so her eyes are thinly lined over with black. It makes her eyes look huge like they're going to pop but not in a bad way. She looks pretty. Well, she's always been pretty. It's only until now that Harry's chosen to acknowledge it.
"'M sorry, Harry. 'M really sorry," she sobs quietly, words muffled. "I didn't know they were going to be there, I swear. I didn't know. I wouldn't have forgiven myself if you had died."
Suddenly everything slips into place. The uncomfortable wash of wrongness that comes with being called a boy makes sense now. It's been like this for years. She tries her best not to let her emotions overwhelm her expression.
She lays out her dress robes. It's a lovely shimmering thing in a muted coral hue, sleeveless, clinching at the waist with a wide skirt. The translucent overlays of the skirt make the skirt appear even wider. She's certain it'll be out of place among the rest of the dress robes with its iconic 50s look.
Malfoy arches a perfectly plucked eyebrow, nose buried in her potions textbook. Ever since she's chosen the name Gemini Malfoy she's gone down to a spa for regular treatments every week. The estrogen pills have been making Harry have horrible breakouts across places on her body where she didn't even know acne could fester, but Malfoy's skin has cleared up considerably. It looks incredibly soft and it's starting to drive Harry up the wall a little.
She explains her situation to Professor McGonagall (that’s why she came early). Her Head of House gladly accommodates her, but she promises to not out Harry when she isn't ready. It is a recent discovery, after all, some more time would be necessary for her to become mentally prepared. Thinking about coming out to the entire school population makes her eye twitch oddly. She doesn't think she can stomach any schoolmates approaching her and asking all kinds of nosy questions. Or any questions, for that matter.
"Not friends, no way," she replies quickly. "It's just that I happen to know something about them that I can't tell you. I promise if this changes I'll tell you at once. It's kind of burning at me inside as well."
More tears pour out and mix with her running snot. After five minutes of rubbing feebly at her sore eyes, she sighs, rolling herself back out into an inelegant sprawl across her bed again. Gemini could do whatever she wanted. Whatever. They hated each other in the past. Maybe they could do it again, she thinks. Even if it meant ignoring an entire companionship they had formed in the process.
As much as that bothers her that he could be like her, it comforts her inexplicably to know that maybe, someone her age went through the same struggles, not like Aunt Lorraine, who had settled into adulthood and begun from there.
In what appears to be the worst form of emotional constipation, Gemini clutches her skirt tightly. "Don't end up dead or fatally injured, okay?"
July 31st dawns. Under the wisp of a cold morning, she curls up in bed, going through her presents idly.
At first, Gemini starts with protests, but her tone evens out at the end. "For the last time, Pans, I'm not going to the ball with him. Or any boy, for that matter. It's alright."
"Ron will get worried. I've been out here too long," she says. Malfoy steps out first into the quiet hallway. Harry shuts the door behind them. "I have a book that my Aunt Lorriane gave for these kinds of things. I'll owl you later."
"Is that so?" she replies, voice a little wet. "Well, I'm transgender too, I suppose. I think. Didn't know it was a thing until like five seconds ago." Lorraine chuckles at that.
Tucked under Malfoy's arm, she notices immediately that its spine has cracked. It wasn't like that before. She gives it a once over to make sure nothing else has been damaged. "You must have read it thoroughly."
"I'll overlook the insults for now, but the pronouns… they were very nice. Made me feel happy. I would like you to continue using those," she says in the smallest voice. Something warm and wiggly dances in Harry's chest.
"Not helping, Pans." She slumps against the wall like a rag doll, confronted by the possibility that Harry could get a horrible injury and die while still distancing herself from Gemini. They still had so much to learn about each other. Great! Fantastic! Life is terrible as always.
"We’ll be dancing the waltz, right? I heard. I’ve learnt how to lead when I was younger, but leading is one of those random matters that make me feel rather dysphoric. Unfortunate, really..”
She hurriedly ties up her hair into a ponytail, planting herself closer to Milicent. "Sorry Millie, could you repeat that?"
So her parents are alright with her being transgender and supporting Tom Riddle? Huh. Go figure. Blood purity must be like LGBT+ rights in the wizarding world. (That is very unlikely but it makes better sense when she says it in her head.)
The cover is dusty, hardcover beginning to rot into a dull brown colour. It takes a bit of a strength to open it as all the pages are stuck together. It furls open to reveal an assortment of names in severe fonts.
Harry ends up securing a date in Fred, probably a new second most favourite person in the world. He's a ball of fun when he wants to be and it's simply very likeable. Since she has a date and a dress, she thinks she's set for the ball.
"I gave some thought to it."  She smoothes a yellow page to the start of the L section. "I thought about naming myself Lily, after my mother, but I don't know if I should. It doesn't feel right. Then I thought about calling myself after a flower, cause it's a family tradition on my mom's side, but I don't know many flowers."
The windows are all shut, but the air inside the dorm makes her shiver under the blankets. She casts a glance over to Hermione's bed, where the girl is sitting by herself, eyes bright and wide awake. In the absence of everyone else, there is a trove of red-and-green decorations scattered about the place, a task the girls had taken on themselves the night before.
The other girl snorts, leaning over to brush her hand over Harry's forehead. "Sorry, Potter. I don't think I can bear to let you go again." She feels her heart do a weird somersault.
Snow falls outside in heaps, sleets of fine white trickling from the sky. Professor McGonagall had transfigured their common room carpet to a tiny Christmas tree. Their presents had been owl delivered at night.
"I'm not dead, Gem. It's okay, you didn't know. There was nothing you could have done." Harry runs a soothing hand up and down Gemini's back.
Harry snorts. "Yes, I'll be sure to do that, but there's no guarantee. You know I have a bounty on my head."
“Hermione, don’t move,” Parvati instructs, eyeliner in one hand, hovering over her best friend’s face.
"Recently I sat for an interview with The Prophet, Harry," she starts. "The next morning, the headline will say something along the lines of Actually, It's GEMINI NARCISSA MALFOY NOW. I have to admit, I'm quite excited."
First she squints indignantly at Cho Chang from Ravenclaw. Then Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff. The list goes on. Hermione has to elbow her in the ribs to keep her from  staring for too long.
As promised, her and Fred don't sway as well as the others during the opening dance, but they go through it with wide grins on their face. At first, Harry is nervous, stumbling over a heel. Fred squeezes her arm slightly to reassure her, and they try their best to pretend to know what they're doing. It's fun.
"You're going to have to try harder than that, Potter," she grumbles. "Oh." Her gaze flickers over Harry's outfit, then to her lips, probably noticing the cosmetics. "You look different."
The doors to the ballroom open with a creak. Students, having parted for them like the red sea, applaud as they enter pair by pair. Faux snow drizzles from the ceiling, painting the image of the Yule Ball of an unforgettable wintry white.
Absently she grabs at a plait, still in perfect shape even after dealing with both the dark lord and three days of unconsciousness. She ought to thank Parvati for that. The end of a ribbon looks like it's been fried.
Practised from the numerous times she had explained it patiently to her friends, she says, "Being transgender means that your physical body and your gender don't align. Some people take steps to change their appearance to suit what they truly are. Like me." She sucks in a breath in a moment of vulnerability. "I still have like, a dick, but I'm still a girl. You got that?"
Harry walks towards the doors to leave, Malfoy behind her. It's so weird. She's probably never had a civilised conversation with the Slytherin up until this point. But even if Malfoy is just like her, she is still a person who called Hermione those horrible names. Plus she has a Death Eater father who wants Harry's head on a plate. Yet she can't feel any semblance of hate or dislike in knowing that Malfoy found the truth behind her dysphoria tonight. It's disassociating, almost.
"Then we can find clothes that fit on you." Harry sweeps an eye over the skirt, glancing away quickly when she realises she's been looking for far too long than is normal. "If it makes you feel any better, that skirt makes your legs look fantastic, Malfoy."
"How did you do that?" asks Harry, peering at it. It's full of words he's never seen in his life. Probably some kind of history book for names. The names aren't even sorted by alphabet. Some look like they'd sound rather queer when read aloud.
She lengthens her eyelashes, magicks a dark line against the waterline, makes her lips a flattering pink colour and tucks a flower behind her ear. She changes out her pants for a ruffled skirt that is vaguely uncomfortable as a tag still hangs by the waistline, but by the time she's done dolling up she feels like she could run laps around the castle.
If Harry had a face like Draco's she bet she'd have far less difficulty looking like a girl than Harry did with her own, and Harry envies him for it.
"It was from the Slytherin towers, probably," she says offhandedly, trying to warm up her freezing toes under her red blanket. "I went to see Malfoy today."
Hm. Right now she's just glad she's alive. It seems like Gemini had been sleeping for a long time, so Harry gently rubs her shoulder to stir her. "Gem. Gemini. Wake up."
The bird is the closest to her bed. How did Malfoy owl her so fast? She admires the beautiful owl, stroking its head, delighted when it reciprocates with a purring coo.
Today is a good day. Since it's Hogsmeade Saturday, the school grounds are nearly barren. So Harry sleeps in, waiting for everyone to leave, knowing they won't be back for a few hours.
. At least she manages to get in a playing field that is comfortable to her. As she zips up and down, her plaits go flying in the air. The ribbons in her braids are a bright Gryffindor red, prominent against the white sky. She disappears for a while, returning with a golden egg cradled in her arms and numerous cuts dotting her arms and face. There’s a sort of half-reluctant cheer, especially from the Hufflepuffs. Gemini grits her teeth but doesn’t open her mouth.
It's become like a place for her to rest. She comes here every time prior to a challenge, often to wind down. It doesn't work because right before a challenge she gets panicky again. It clears her mind out regardless.
The past few weeks had been a blur. Ever since she had discovered her gender identity, Malfoy became more and more eager to begin a transition. It appeared that she had been struggling with dysphoria all her life, and now that she had finally found an answer to it, she wanted to resolve it right away. They ended up meeting even more frequently as time went by.
She looks down at her feet to notice a slight swell of her chest at the bottom of her vision. She gasps, a hand flying to rest upon one, gaping at the feel of it. A burst of happiness at the sight tingles like pins and needles. What? When did this happen? Why hadn't she noticed this before?
In the morning, she had gone to Professor McGonagall’s office, telling her about her request to be transferred to the girls' dorms. The older woman had also said that the professors would be referring to her as Miss Potter from now on. Harry definitely would welcome the change, but now everyone would know. Even more, eyes would be brought upon her. Funnily enough, this time, it would be of her own volition.
The girls' tower is only a small walk away, facing adjacent. She lets Hermione go first. The first step of the staircase, is, well… staring at her, waiting for her to start moving. Suddenly Harry feels her throat run dry. Sure. She's a girl, but biologically, she's a boy. What if Hogwarts doesn't recognise that? A looming fear swallows her train of thought.
"I don't think I like any of these names. Narissa is a perfectly fine name though, and I like it solely because it reminds me of Mother," she sniffs, disdainful.
"So you're telling me that I could call myself a Sweater and everybody could deal with that. Seriously?"
All her belongings have been packed into the trunk already. Her bed is neatly made, which is an anomaly in itself. Hopefully, the girls' dorm will be neater than the boys', she thinks. She quickly swallows the pills with a gulp of water, getting up. She ought to see where her new bed will look like.
When she turns over to let Harry see she lets the shorter girl cast an assortment of cosmetic spells. They don't work as well as actual makeup, she bemoans, but they do the job as well.
"Harry Potter I have not seen you in years but I promise you I will help you with this," Lorraine says quickly. "I'll bring you to my doctor and we can get some hormone blockers for you, okay? It helps stop puberty– oh, don't cry, sweetheart! Us girls need to help each other."
"Admittedly so," Gemini replies with a small grin. It does feel odd to see her not sneering at Harry. The expression is so genuine that Harry finds herself struck by dumbfoundedness once again, it's ridiculous.
When Hermione descends from the stairs, it's like in slow motion. Krum, startled by her beauty, comes up to take her hand and kisses it. (He'd better be the perfect date or Harry will hand his ass to him the next challenge!)
"Blaise?" he whispers and Blaise nods, "Yes." Draco acknowledges him and then went back to staring out of the window. Blaise, a little bit unsure, what to do, sits down beside him and musters his friend. He looks... detached. Like he wasn't there at all. All of a sudden Blaise got angry at Harry again. Draco had tried so hard to get Harry to notice him. Sure, sometimes he was just over the place, but then the other times he would do something thoughtful and Blaise knows, Draco would do it all over again. That's how far he's gone for Potter. Tentatively, he lifts his hand and sets it on Draco's arm. Grey eyes flicker to set on his face. They're a little bit red around the edges and Blaise knows, Draco has been crying again.
"Yes, how can I help you?" Pince asks the Ravenclaw and he stutters a little bit embarrassed, before signing accusingly to Draco. The latter just keeps reading.
"What will happen, if it never gets easier?" he asks quietly as if he is afraid of the answer. Draco takes his hand again. It's a habit now. They grab each other's hands anytime they want their attention. And they never fail to deliver. Sometimes Draco wonders, what will happen if he cannot grab Harry's hand like it's his own. He never wants that day to come. He prays, that that day will never come.
But, oh, was he afraid to even ask! He was confident to ask a girl because that's what his father prepared him for. Marriage was something he never could escape. His father made deals with other pureblood families, trading their daughters for something else. But a man? How could one possibly woo a man and in addition to that, Harry Potter? He was asked every day, since the announcement, but Harry declined every time.
The god of friendship says and his anger affects the other god because now they're both holding each other at their clothes. The god of happiness has to stop this.
Draco willed his tension down, muted all thoughts screaming that this was a bad idea and bravely looked into Princr Harold's eyes just to promptly regretted it. They were such a vivid green, sparkly, just like the Queen's. He had the feeling, he knew them from somewhere, but he couldn't quite place it. They were so beautiful, that Draco almost missed his cue. Harold seemed amused by his antics.
"Pansy!" Harry begged, "I just want to apologize. I know, I hurt him. I could slap myself for doing that."
Draco looked up and stared at him resolutely. "We are done, Harry," he said and closed the door in Harry's face.
"Watch it in our room. I'll keep Theo outside," Blaise promises and Draco tightly nods, walking upstairs and locking himself into their bedroom. He briefly debates sitting on the bed or the ground but decides to take the ground. He places the Pensieve in front of him and pours Blaise's memory inside. He takes a deep breath and dives in.
Harry paled a bit. Pansy's threats at the beginning of Draco's and his relationship were by far the most creative ones. Blaise had threatened to cut his dick off and Harry had heard that line before, so he wasn't particularly scared of that, but Pansy had some really scary imagination.
Sometime after the first drumming of the day stopped, the door to the basement opened. He watched, anxious and wishing it was Potter- he couldn't feel his fingers and his throat was sore and dry. He pissed himself some time ago, but couldn't find himself to care. The smell was agonizing, but it kept him sane. Somewhat.
"Of course, love," Draco said softly and the squeeze on his throat was the promise of his reward in the evening.
Because just two months later, Granger started to avoid him, answering curtly and almost rude until it was uncomfortable to speak with her. Ron also obviously changed his ways and canceled every chess match for the next four months. Work, he called it. Draco preferred
He had to swollow a sob. Because he knew it would happen. He knew, he would leave eventually, find a new flame to watch, a new person to fuck. Draco doesn't feel like he's been anything but a person Harry met out of convenience, someone he used to feel better about himself. He feels dirty, uncomfortable with his own skin.
"You won't regret it, Pansy, I fucking swear," Harry said hastily, overwhelmed that he had come so far.
"Then did you mean what you said about the second dance?" Draco asked, a little breathless. Everything was crashing into him, but somehow, the answer to that question mattered to him very much.
"Were you ever in love, Severus?" Draco asks back and the potion master looks stunned. He clears his throat and takes a tentative sip.
