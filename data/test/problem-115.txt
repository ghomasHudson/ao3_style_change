"Oh? Is that what you think?"
"Who do you think you are," she snarled, "to demand a Quiche Lorraine?"
"I'm a Slytherin!" He announced, and stood.
It was midnight, and the weather was chilling he wouldn't have thought of anyone in the skies. But there they were, the pranksters of Hogwarts, overhearing his every word. Or, rather late to realise, having overheard every word. Draco clutched his broom tighter, and carefully held back his urge, of his wand at his disposal. The first wand he had gained on British soil.
"Can't you sense anything? Nothing at all?"
They ambled past Bartemius Crouch's house, which was empty. But they turned past the house next to his, into the corner alley where the block ended. Spelling their hands clean Draco flicked out the disillusionment and silencing charms with a grunt.
"Is Susan awake at this hour?" Hermione asked Cedric.
"I wouldn't recommend that, Matthew." Draco spoke with a strained smile, "she has another visitor."
of your eyes."
"What, have you done." She demanded.
Draco
"Besides, considering what Uncle Jason said, I might have been, like you said, lazy. Unwilling. I never thought myself so, but he sounded so disappointed I didn't think further, and, Luna, I should have. I would have had I been in Durmstrang-"
"No, well, last month?"
"Don't be too disappointed, Chartres. You know as well as I that you are not suited for the position of Head. Catherine would not have allowed it."
"So," Fred said slowly, "Dumbledore wants to be the legal guardian of Harry Potter because he wants power? And Sirius Black will have to fight for it?"
"That's why you brought them instead of Hermione?" Pansy yawned as she whispered the password, "she wouldn't have been asking politics."
"I am lesser than Grindelwald, at least, because I did not cause this entire ordeal and simply watched it happen."
While his previous attempts at communications regarding his future was filled with narcissistic tones of self-portrayal, he was currently talking, quite calmly, to Susan Bones regarding the recent proposals on the malleable limitations of professional business licenses. Fred and George Weasley stood to the side in party hats, congratulatory, but stunned.
"Oh? I'd supposed but not been certain. It was supposed to be my eighth question. Regardless, out of my good heart, madam. One more galleon."
Draco laughed again. The night was cold and the wind harsh, but against the moonlight and cold air running through his hair, hundreds of meters off ground, it was the only place he could laugh at will. The only place he could release his frustrations. He swayed on his broom, before curling back up and lying down, his back against one thin, polished wood.
"That's politics?" George asked in a twisted frown.
"What I do not understand, then, is how the rat managed to survive."
"Thanks for the new nickname, mate. Not as if we needed it." 3&3 chorused.
His appearance explained everything to Draco, including his father's disdain. Durmstrang of learning, Beauxbatons of the rich, Hogwarts of prestige.
"Yes. He slept a lot, apparently, in order to be left alone."
"Office of Auror Reports and Operations!" Flitwick shouted.
Vivian finally fixed a glare at Catherine.
"My mother told me otherwise. She spoke highly of your kindness, but foolish actions. You were kind to those younger than you, but deemed those representative of your family's traditions lower. Biased against the darker side of society, but favorable to those who were of better conditions."
"The closest example I can give would be the hand-to-hand combat of the French military's named individuals. Sometimes they surprise me with a new technique, once every blue moon, but none can live up to their name in full."
"I can kill you." He said.
Kreacher didn't reply.
Luna was silent on the other end for some time.
"This place isn't for kids," she smiled as she leaned over the booth towards them. They'd seated themselves on the stool.
He was unable to speak of anything he had heard of. Were they from the future, or was it simply told? Were they as old as they claimed to be, or were they talking of the years of experiences transferred to their minds? Who could he talk to? Where could there be possible advice? His occlumency walls were well-built although his legilimency was rather weak, a rather contrary effect of having many legilimens around him, and it slammed into the forefront of his mind in full force in his own fear of allowing his tongue to slip. His eye turned dazed as an escaping sob was startled into silence.
"Agreed." Draco said immediately, "I don't know how I missed this." He whispered in a smaller voice, "we will be staying at-"
He could assume, for one, the portraits in the hall were meant to act as something resembling the wards which covered nothing of Hogwarts. That, was similar to Durmstrang's open facilities, but to find there had been no guard against outsiders for the personal spaces of one's own was not as pleasing to find. They were made to wait before his desk, seated.
"We've been following you since the Owl Post." Blaise sighed tiredly from the shadows.
"I'm fine, I'm fine. Thanks for asking."
"Yes. I think, you're very nice, Draco-of-now. You're certainly better at expressing your opinions than the Draco-of-then would have said. Less repetitions, more thoughts." She lifted a necklace off her neck.
Aunt Vivian exchanged glances with Uncle Jason, who simply raised his brow.
"I've met this unconscious man for the second time. Two meetings are enough to acquaint ourselves, don't you think? I was barely a teenager then this man was first elected to become a delegate, so imagine how fond he could have been of me."
"Can I keep this?"
"Yes, Cedric, that's what we've been talking about this noon."
"How dare you." Draco drawled.
"...aurors."
"I don't care for their thanks," Draco said as he stepped back and took Hermione in. "You look a fright, but happy. Have you made up with them?"
"You've convinced her too?"
"Are you fine, Granger?"
This is fiction. Fiction, where magic, the impossible, and fantasy abounds, shouldn't be described as "vulgar and explicit content". I'm not saying shipping is bad, but I think there are lines we shouldn't cross. They are indefinite lines, but lines which our moral dictates.
"You've been to the muggles'?"
"Ask."
"Then why don't we all head down this evening, a sneak down to Hogsmeade. You've said the last traces of Sirius Black's magic ended in that direction, so in order to prove your claims wrong, Draco, a nice, brief outing would do." Pansy dared with a satisfied sniff.
"There's one connection," he spoke out loud, "but between believing those were intended examinations against an eleven-years old rather than the faulty protection of Hogwarts, the latter is more comforting. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Eleven, orphaned, presumed to be raised in the muggle world in less than savoury conditions. Albus Dumbledore, the wizard of his age."
"Well," he said twisting his watch, "as long as it saves me time."
"With Uncle Jason? Whatever for? I've never seen you two fight." He threw a glance at his Uncle, who was clearly distracted by the curtains.
"This is the department of Disciplinary Hearings and Cases. Her office is across the Wizengamot council hall, but she works here going through cases most of the time. You need to be silent."
"We aren't incompetent, darling. We've accosted Blaise since you started disappearing for hours in the evening after the Fat Lady got scratched. Your mother's a Black, you see, and Sirius Black is a Black." Pansy said slowly, as though Draco was a child.
"But-"
"Oh, yes, George. Not a smile at all."
"One. This May."
The Shrieking Shack had no entry from the path in Hogsmeade. That wasn't to say there had been none, as it was abandoned for a purpose and reason suitable to the past owner's cause. The Shack had once been a home to some and shelter to another, before it was abandoned, then accused of being haunted. The accusations however, were strictly from 'muggles' who believed in evil, intrusive ghosts, forgoing their past witnessing of Nearly-Headless Nick. To the purebloods of the British Wizarding World the rumours were so purely muggle, but to discredit those rumours were an effort none was willing to take.
"He smelled of a warm humid air," Draco agreed.
"I'm not sure. My aunt, she simply recommended to watch, I'd have to ask." Draco said.
There were times when Erlnier wondered if Regulus Black the First was initially noted as Head of the House of Fawley simply because he was a Black, a prestigious name in society. Fortunately he was talented, grown by firm hands since youth much like himself, but there was always room for doubt considering what he had seen of the Blacks until now.
"Supposedly." Blaise returns.
"I don't need you to tell me about Harry." Sirius Black said. "But teach me how the laws have changed, and I'll give you access to the Black's house. Regulus' room is under preservation, so you'd learn more about him there, than anywhere else. I don't have much information on what he had been doing before he went missing, unfortunately, but what you've said is true. He did say he would bring about Voldemort's downfall."
Luna tugged her bag forward as she marched towards Professor Flitwick's classroom. The classroom was the only place Draco felt more relieved in, as no-one dared to disrespect Professor Flitwick, who was firmly on Luna's side after witnessing her being bullied in her first year.
"No, brother, he's a mindless soul."
So he stood on his broom, the same which his father had gifted, and trailed across the night sky bundled in Aunt Vivian's blue-knit cardigan he had stolen. He had surfed on the coast of Australia when his mother had first introduced him to the concept of summer pensions, and it had served him well.
Draco had not cried, he could insist that he had not and find no evidence of doing so, but he could finally feel the sheen of wetness lining his eyes retreat.
"That complicated speech is something Malfoy's taught you, isn't it?"
"Now that he has begun, albeit not in the best of ways, I am stalling to give Erlnier some time to accept what situations he may face in the near future."
Vivian's thoughts rampaged before it settled, and the duration of silence which ensued was as unsettling. It was a soulful fight between what she believed must happen and what could possibly change. She had done so before, although the altered fates were fortunately minimal in number. Vivian stared at him, a small boy who barely reached the middle of her thighs, and patted his head absently.
Vivian turned back to Draco with a displeased frown, as she would have preferred him to deny any espionage as was their basic rule. Jason rolled a shoulder, a careless yet much orderly shrug.
"Young Mister Malfoy." Tea spoke, and crossed her feet into a perfect bow.
"Ever since Aunt Vivian lost contact with her friends in Russia, Owen had to permanently remain there. Apparently the attack on Russia's diplomatic headquarters, no matter how spread apart they were, were done by those who claim to be Death Eaters, and not You-Know-Who. They wanted You-Know-Who to leave England, and establish a solid support outside of England in other European countries with less guard against him. But he refused. He wasn't sighted outside of England, nor was he tracked in England back then until three years ago, near Hogwarts."
"Ooh, George, that's a brilliant idea. But there has to be something more to raise there dour, evil little spirits."
But a finger brushed against his temple, and with a heavy heart and mind, he drifted rapidly into sleep.
Draco turned a sharp glance at her.
"Seventh question. Who left the bar first?"
Pot dug its nails through the envelopes, and tapped its beak on his hand. It was still quiet.
"Bluckbert's. We'll write."
It made sense.
"We'll follow this disgusting imagination against my skin, then." Pansy concluded, and her words held more weight than most.
Draco's face altered between disgust and mock horror before he, too, turned to check who was approaching them.
Susan cleared her voice.
Draco, in bare reach of her toes, kicked it. She sent him a
"You've a suppressed post-traumatic stress disorder. Not a disorder well known, mind, the war's only just recovered. You have no sessions today, but to remain with me. Let us talk over breakfast, we have much to go over."
"You need the law on your side to free yourself. With Umbridge at the forefront of legislation on anti-animagus and anti-were policies, you'll find it hard to do so. But yes, I'll grant you the portion of political connections." Draco said with his eyes closed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eyes trained on Blaise, he moved up the stairs. They didn't pass a greeting but a cursory overview of each other, a slight lift of an inquiring eyebrow and assurance that neither looked damaged visibly. They trailed in, a well-decorated hall greeting the flock of student by their right, before a shrill voice called out to them.
Draco groaned, and rubbed his forehead.
His mother was sipping her tea continuously in their little tryst.
Truly, only 17 hours had passed since they destroyed Professor Flitwick's wall last evening.
Jason gave him a glass object he took instinctively, as it was thrown, and before he could object to the harsh pull of his magic the port-key ripped him through the wards of his Manor.
She smiled, a red smile on white skin, and it was made fiercer by the hair pulled tightly together.
The dementor hovered, there was another which passed his cabin uncaring of him or the dementor which remained. It was moving with purpose, Draco realised, because its trails which was the length of two cabins combined refused to stop. The first which had paused before his door reigned back its hand, a sharp wisp of cold frosting his glass, and it pulled away as sudden as it came.
Taysa looked confused, but answered dutifully.
The eagle immediately took up a third of the table, knocking over other teacups and dishes and screeching into Blaise's ears in greeting. There was a spoonful of tomato soup which immediately carried over towards the nearest table, a piece of cheese flying overhead professor Snape's head, and the furthest plate shattering on the floor due to the momentum.
"You are very different from your English version, Draco." She continued.
Her dark green eyes gleamed underneath the low-hanging candle-light.
"Where?"
The last they had met, it was the day Jason had visited the registrar with Vivian at he International Department of French Ministry in naming his the following Head of the House of Fawley. In the process of doing so with Chartres on their tail, they had agreed to resolve the dungeons' cursed rooms based on their reputations, and had recommended Chartres who had just arrived in protest of naming Vivian the Head.
Blaise turned in his chair and took a searching glance at the painting Draco pointed towards.
"My, have you been listening in our conversations?" She asked absently.
"Wow," George commented snidely from the side, "what a momentous day of Hogwarts unity."
The twins looked at each other. Erlnier, for a moment, wondered whether they were going to shrug it off, like many others he had witnessed do in Hogwarts. Aside from the handful in Slytherin who were well attuned, and another which could grasp vague shifts in magic, there were none which seemed to care about the castle's moans against every student harmed, nor its protectiveness over children of all ages. But they turned to him once more with curiosity in their eyes, as one pulled out a piece of weathered parchment.
Draco looked at the twins across his bed with a lack of words. They weren't unwelcome, per se, but they were more than eager to explore the Slytherin's rooms so late at night when the lake made everything darker save the strand of filtered moonlight. And they were deserving of it when they've carried Blaise and Pansy to their rooms, Pansy shaken awake before the girl's common room, but seeing two ginger, distinctly tall teenagers hanging over the ends of his bed was awkward.
"Whatever you do," Luna's voice drifted over, "remember we don't have to. We have a choice."
"You guys were the ones who said Slytherins are ever so evil, Fred, stop talking over me!"
She would have, both women, found the entire matter more delicate to breach if the child was settled. For example, had Narcissa not birthed him with worries already clouding her mind, torn between family, ideals, and future, Vivian wouldn't have found a place to reach out to her at all, not matter the cause or reason. She would have, instead, targeted the orphan who lived under the stairs and hoped for the better, but when had she taken the easier route?
They had an unspoken truce, as observant as Blaise was, for Draco to hold his silence yet reveal as what would be minimal to a cause, and for Blaise to not question the source of Draco's knowledge. Although it was highly probably that Blaise had gleaned much more from Draco's constant disappearances, simply 'erased from existence' at times, he didn't confirm, and Blaise had not asked.
Vivian swivelled on her stool to face them even as her hand reached back for the next paper atop the nearest pile, a common sight within the rooms of their manor in every nook and cranny.
"Thunder." Draco concluded.
What Draco had learned, in his few interactions with his mother and various conversations with the wizarding world at large, was that the people within the House of Fawley was in no manner conservative in their opinions contrary to the current society, or reserved in their speech behind closed doors. To those they considered an ally, they spoke without reservation, whether it be Sir Owen, or Miss Catherine. They had a common trait of holding their tongue outside, but made it known sooner or later of their own, surprisingly little, opinions.
"Oh, I think you can starve a little." Hermione elbowed him in jest as they began to walk back towards the castle.
"Thank you?" Draco repeated in shock.
"Erlnier. We've a conversation to do." She turned from her tea with a green twinge and tilted her head.
"Your map only reflects Hogwarts' grounds?" He asked the twins.
"Oh?" Narcissa intoned.
"We're going to be late."
Draco dusted his robes off, glanced at Hagrid's empty window, and strode away.
He ran through the facts, and the rumours, beginning with a troll and Nicholas Flamel, a basilik and the Chamber of Secrets. He hadn't managed to read further into the Chamber of Secrets, but could dig further into Nicholas Flamel and the supposed intentions of bringing a Philosopher's Stone into Hogwarts. Especially when, last he read Luna's letter, the entire Slytherin House had feared taking a step into the Forbidden Forest.
"I'll get it. You and Luna should move outside, towards the Quidditch fields. You're less likely to be caught by the stands."
Luna sent out a silent hum of agreement.
Draco grimaced. The papers he finished rifling through this morning had indicated Bertha Jorkins was on leave for holiday, moreover, towards Albania.
Draco fell silent.
"Zabini!"
At the turn of conversation, Draco honed his magic to a concentrated point, and heard the rolling thunder in his ears once more. Magic had always settled around those who knew like nature, but to pinpoint one was like narrowing past the sound of rustling leaves and humming bees, until the necessary sound was heard most out of place. To him, it was the low rumble of thunder.
"Sixth. What did they order?"
"With such a melancholic air we'd never imagined," Fred continued.
"Her opinion on Harry Potter was rather mild." Narcissa glanced at the newspaper which cracked against her husband's grasp.
"Do you think our parents are going overboard with such semantics, or is it the dramatics of the other wailing children?"
I think I'll keep writing, to finish this once I get through the writer's block. It'll probably be on Blogger under Sivjulicat too.
The spell recasted, albeit weakly, Luna moved to stand next to Draco to see what he was pointing at, and there, right after the shadow of Peter Pettigrew barely dissipated, was a brief flicker of Millicent Bagnold.
"You mean, it has a foam, and is smooth to drink, but is not a beer?" Draco voiced his interpretation (he noted that she had steered the conversation away, and was delighted to know he had met someone much manipulative than himself).
"Vivian Fall, the Fall a derivative of Fawley, one which ran to the guide of Grindelwald long before the jester entered court. By all means call me a Fawley, save I have created my own name as by tradition. His accomplishments are so minute compared to the accomplishments of Grindelwald I wish myself under a rock."
Upon receiving it Draco was grateful, yet knew such 'influence' his mother had passed on in her message was not something he wished to gain through the means of a sport. He had the Pavilion, and several older students he remained friendly with. Besides, Aerodynamics included more information handling of calculating a body's synchronisation with magic, a lesson on positions and strategies on the broom at a lower height for the first few weeks, that he felt it rather unnecessary.
"Here." Luna whispered into the silence.
Zaxter Zimman's back straightened, his eyes grew focused, and he pushed his white hair back.
. Anyone who is found to be talented enough in a variety of fields, or deadly within a specialised one, is named differently with a nickname which indicates their strength. For instance, I was given the name of Paladin for the handling of metal knives and swords which are rarely seen in today’s battlefield. I suppose it doesn't surprise you?"
"I'm no legilimens," Matthew snarled, "drop that. What a nasty habit you've got there. Olphey, bring some truffles please."
"Just for one game." Draco conceded, seeing no ways out.
Kreacher looked at him for a time he couldn't describe.
"And the only important missing person on our list which had such minimal magic is Peter Pettigrew. I see."
"Our family had that rat for ages, Malfoy. For a decade."
"It means, Weasleys, that your family still has a responsibility towards guarding the tear between wards."
"Oh, excuse me," Draco mustered his exceeding politeness for the second time that morning, "are you alright?"
Draco took another look around the room registering a few spells, Aunt Vivian's torn jacket abandoned well across the window-sill, and a lock of her hair on the ground before realising they must have discussed a matter quite thoroughly indeed.
"You've been asking the Grey Lady about enchantments?" Hermione asked in surprise.
"Know what?"
"None."
"Going somewhere?" The bartender asked.
"Perhaps," Blaise began, "she seeks no gingers."
"So tell me all you know of Regulus Black, because I have been told he went missing upon fleeing from Voldemort and was last seen in confidence of Voldemort's fall. I need what he had, because if my family comes to ruins, and His wand is pointed in my mother's face, I would be the last to stand between the Boy-Who-Lived, the Ministry, and Voldemort, should it mean my own death!"
"There's not much I can do for him."
"My mother," Draco sniffed, "can slap my Aunt."
"When did you decide to come?"
Draco looked out of the window, and saw that they had already come to a stop. The castle's oak doors were flung open, and he could see the light spilling on the stairs from where he sat. The name 'Hogwarts', however, had already begun to sound like an uttered curse to his ears. He leant out as he unlocked the latch, and sighed once more at the flood of disorganised students. Thinking of asking Luna her opinion, he turned, but she had already moved to brush past him.
The heading of the English newspaper he received from Luna was carefully printed in bold letters of how the Boy-Who-Lived had attended Hogwarts. There was a picture of the very boy printed clearly beneath. Harry Potter looked rather frail for someone of his age, smaller physically and unstable mentally as by his roaming eyes and shuffling feet. The photo was taken presumably within a busy street.
A stilted answer replied equally, Sirius Black tilted his head.
"See? Ron says yes."
"We've tracked down Volley to the Forbidden Forest around Hogwarts," Jason began his greeting as soon as he landed in his apparition, "but he is weak. He feeds off unicorn blood, drifts like a ghost. No-one but Dumbledore had noticed his presence but even with the students flooding his gates, he refuses to act upon him. In my opinion, for the sake of measuring his hero's potential, no matter the risk of others."
She could shred Lucius, the child's father, to pieces on temporary guardianship considering how far she had buried her bones down in the law school around her seventeenth life.
"Here, have a butter-beer." Her voice was distant, and airy.
Vivian felt a pointed look and turned to find Narcissa staring complacently at her. Profanities welled in her mind, because she had seen the look on desperate people who were, perhaps, before a decision that was not of their own choosing but for their beloved ones. And those decision were mostly ill placed for those on the receiving end.
"Ooh," a first-grade Slytherin sang, "look, Pansy, it's Cedric."
That kid would never realise, she thought, how humane he treated them. How the politeness they experienced in that brief interaction of a tension-filled half an hour was the only contact they had with someone outside of Knockturn that year. Taysa looked down at the coins. He wasn't bound by stereotypes, she realised as she counted eleven into her purse, he assumed they were moralistic enough not to fight over money. He assumed they were kind enough to not attack him, a young one.
"You piece of golden shite," Draco mumbled, "I fucking hate you. Fuck Marcus, fuck Quidditch, I'm never playing again."
"One galleon added, but if the following answer's a lie, five galleons removed."
"It is a matter of importance."
As for the intruder, Erlnier sighed, carefully moving his levitation off Crouch's grounds, that was something he had to think on.
"Vivian. There has been a guest knocking at my door for the past half of the hour and I swore I would have had him removed. The only thing which bound him to the seat before my desk is his insistence on your acquaintance, as he claims he is the liaison, of all things, between the French government and French ministry, you know the difference."
"I feel old," Zaxter groaned as his bones cracked. He stood precariously hunched, "I look old. I am old."
"Well
"Miss Narcissa is Mrs. Malfoy now," the elf said in disdain, "she is proper, most well done in hand. But you are no Black. You are no Malfoy. You are intruder, mixed thing which should not grace this house!"
"Yeah, I guess. I should."
"I'll be teaching you the physical aspect. Vivian will be teaching magic duelling, once you've finished learning your stances with me. Both of you. Luna, you’ll have to learn the basic stances and modify them as you wish after adjustment. A woman's body is different from a man's in structure."
"Excuse my judgement to save you all from the hound before we were all disabled. Anyone would have left you there, with a rabid, mad creature, in the dark. An error of conscience."
Draco took back both galleons, held one between his fingers, and shook it as he leaned forward. "First question: June second of this month, what time did the two visit?"
"You've had the map for long, and didn't realise it was of Sirius Black's?" Pansy asked incredulously.
His voice went, again, unheard between furious whispering.
Erlnier blinked once at the room, before finding Aunt Vivian prim against the chair.
At Pansy's excited whisper the entire table fell into a hush, which blatantly grabbed the attention of Gryffindors, then Ravenclaws, then Hufflepuffs in turn. Draco glared at Pansy who meekly shrugged, but continued to read down the letter.
"I'll stay back," Blaise volunteered.
Erlnier moved rapidly around the house, towards the side where there wasn't grass, minding his feet and stepping on the smallest pebbles, before landing right underneath a tree. There, he casted a levitation spell on himself to keep his feet or body imprint off the ground, and spelled the invisibility cloak into a durable stiffness. A double concealment charm on himself within the cloak with several whispers, and he floated there securely, unseen.
Draco looked at him with marginally surprised eyes, but they both knew Hermione had mentioned Harry Potter and Ron Weasley's potential visit several times, with a heavier emphasis on visit than potential.
"Susan," Amelia Bones turned to her niece, "I will have a word with you later. Take your friends back to Hogwarts."
Draco glanced at Blaise, only to find him crafting a similar vibe of sly curiosity.
Matthew stared at him.
"I've been raised very independently, Draco," Blaise whispered in a means of an apology, "the only reason my mother took interest was your mother's intervention."
"Why one?" Taysa snapped.
"Are you invested?" Blaise asked.
Silence passed between the trio as they passed the first sights of Hogwart's walls, far to the left they could only see the glimpses of its grey.
"Besides, Blaise Zabini would not have been here had it not been for your mother's persuasive display."
"Draco," Hermione Granger said as she tugged a boy with round glasses and a taller one with a mop of red hair forward, "what happened."
Every single pair of eyes in the bar swung to her.
She frowned, but agreed.
"This is a horrible place to parkour." Draco noted as he stared down the rather pristine, flat building before him.
Vivian felt something approach. She flung her own soul against it and frowned at the fact that, had it been anyone else but her, they wouldn't have felt the approach of such magic itself. Monsieur Chartres' face had turned red, his beard quivering against his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Considering the fact that your family gave up such a lineage some generations ago, it's surprising to see your reactions against sentient magic, when all you should be feeling is its purpose. Do you understand how rare a case you might be, when your existences are already so rare within the magical community as twins?"
Far across the Gryffindor table, Harry looked up in surprise at Hermione's compliance. She'd sat as soon as he managed to grab her sleeve, half scared of the following scolding to come. Instead, she was sitting with her mouth open, ready to discuss injustice.
Keep your enemies close, Draco reminded himself, something Aunt Vivian fondly mentioned with a mocking smile.
"Good morning." A voice said politely, breaking him out of his morning ruminations.
Catherine paled before turning to snatch up Vivian's tea, and Vivian teasingly suppressed a smile at her friend of fourteen years once more.
Draco took another look at the picture.
"The Educational Office's purpose is observation, tactful intervention for international gatherings, maintaining the Statue of Secrecy, and delegating outsiders to the right places. The ROEUI
We shouldn't be bringing more harm to others though words. Words are precious things which can change a person's life with one encouragement, and one acknowledgement.
"Really? But why are you talking to Draco, here?" George shook Draco's shoulders back and forth.
"Not something as precious to be called hereditary, but something valuable nonetheless because there isn't another pair of these two in the world. Magic is powerful but not indefinite. There are limits of an individual that cannot be crossed, which is why most devolve to rehearsed body fights. What makes everything better, is a weapon." Jason tapped the edge of Draco's blade.
"Second, what happens in the school, remains in the school. If you'd prefer to keep your peers silent about the fact you've once exploded a building, then keep their wrongs silent as well.
"The centuries of war?"
Pansy paled. "She's not a neutral party."
Draco wrote and sat back on his chair. He stuffed the parchment under a book, and started anew. Something raw pushed against his occlumency walls, straightening his posture.
Her cheeks were muddled flush, eyes clear with tears.
Erlnier didn't know why the elf looked so reverent at the name of his House's library, but he nonetheless broke into a smile, and held his hand forward.
"They know such things?"
Vivian controlled her amused gaze before nodding, and twirling her index finger, pulled out a blue thread near her head.
"Must you?"
The professor clapped. Draco pulled his messenger bag to his shoulder, and took another look at the amusing sight of the girl's hanging mouth coupled with her frazzled hair. Unable to stop a smile he did as his instinct dictated, a fond smile splitting across his face, because he could imagine Miss Catherine scoffing right behind her at his lacking explanation, snorting at his pretence of knowing time magic, ridiculing him, but smiling with a proud glint to her eyes.
"Shut up."
"No, Pansy."
They were lost in the decorations lining the sky before the girl seemed to gather her belongings.
"So this was entirely Bartemius Crouch's anger issue?"
"Do you truly plan to sleep here?" He asked.
Vivian nearly breathed in her tea.
The hat settled across his head, a movement rather unlikely but with the aid of magic, and the hat's snide expression fell passive.
"As with some overturned decisions days ago, we've come to the realisation that we've unintentionally nurtured a level of observation within you that would not be taken delightfully by others. You've noticed that we've monitored, or at the very least, led you to certain actions and decisions, therefore constricting you in some ways."
"Enjoy your night for today," Uncle Jason said as he placed the book back down, "and I've stabilised your dimension-space magic. Use it freely."
"This is not about him," Narcissa's sharp voice rang, "it is about my son."
"Well," she spat, "good riddance."
"She won't be reporting to Dumbledore unless asked, that's the important factor. Unless he sends her a letter, and I highly doubt she can reply as of the moment, she won't be tripping over herself. A steadfast, capable person is better than none at all. Besides, we were able to convince her in record time because she was
"They still can't get over the fact I've been expanding my social circle. We've been rather close, but I've started to understand there's more people out there who's willing to be my friend. People who don't judge at first sight. People like you. So they're struggling to... Accept, let's say, that I'm capable of functioning without them."
"We will send word back to the Minister," the French delegate spoke in a heavy accent, "and the Ministers shall decide."
Harry Potter wasn't talking.
A Gryffindor was tangled in his robes, face wrapped in robes and closed off with a tie. He looked like a present; Draco's mouth twitched trying to hold back his laughter. He held him by both hands and pulled him up, loosening the tie wrapped around his head.
"You know better than that," he hissed.
Narcissa, however.
"Didn't Sirius Black visit you?"
"Which is why I sent Pot to disturb Narcissa as much this week. I believe he broke at least three of her tea sets by the china in his talons."
The ministry was going to be disappointed, she thought, once the war is over.
Draco flicked the blade, and was delighted to hear nothing.
Vivian closed her eyes in resignation.
"I thought you would have taken care of the house, as you quite practically enter this place whenever you wish." Vivian slid her eyes towards her.
"Apothecary."
"Well, we would like to talk to him. Draco, here, has brought us to think he's innocent. A crime made to be his, not committed. He obviously thought of going after Black alone," Pansy glanced at him in mock, "but I have managed to bring all to otherwise. If I had known he thought of bringing you two, I would have left him be."
Several eyes swung, Blaise hissed. Their transition, which had been promised to be kept unassuming for an integration that would not be announced, had been ruined with that simple call. He leaned into Draco's side, and whispered unmoving.
"Deal. Repeat after me: I swear on the my magic, the dissolution of my core, to never repeat a work heard or spoken, through any retelling, implications, or variations to others, aside from myself, and two others who are similarly bound to this oath. So mote it be."
"What is it?" Draco bit out before yawning.
"Draco?"
They turned to stare at Susan Bones, who huffed and rolled her eyes. Her bluntness was what reminded him of Felis, her sharp tongue of Joheim. For the first time in his Hogwarts experience, Draco was genuinely paying attention to a peer's opinion.
"You know as well as I do that the reputation of Durmstrang precedes the actual institution itself. The institute is well-known for the education of Dark Arts as a subject, not the usage. The walls of Durmstrang would agree with me." Vivian explained.
"Of course, Aunt Vivian."
"I'm asking," Professor Flitwick spat as he flicked the book back into place, "why!"
Draco and Blaise turned to Pansy, as she had been the one to propose such an adventure, and by no means had Draco roused her interest in hindsight besides speaking an assumption.
"Marcus," Draco elongated his name, "you told me there were many available positions."
Startled, Erlnier stumbled. House elves weren't of hereditary magic, but the few which had been in service for centuries, like Tea, had no distinct magic of ownership but became one with the hereditary magic they've been in most contact with. So the elf, younger than Tea but older than most, had been unrecognisable to Erlnier's ears, less his magic, when surrounded by the Blacks' magic in the Black's house. Much like being stranded in Hogwarts, Erlnier thought negatively of the entire situation.
Jason was often left to deal with the presence of Malfoy manor when Narcissa couldn't find it within herself to settle in their Kettle manor, where Tea often found herself lacking in help. It was on such instance, Vivian occupied with the fresh wave of students, that he went.
She didn't sit, nor offer Narcissa a reprise from their adventure down the goblin-made tunnels, and stood stoically as she spoke.
Sirius Black laughed.
"Do you know Mr. Crouch, mister?"
"Well," the bartender placed his hands on his hip, "he may take his tea at his office, but I assure you, his daily dose is always taken care of here. Every morning, I tell you. But since last month's end and this, he's been busy to the point he asks for owl deliveries. Of my coffee! Last I asked, he told me too many people need his help for the...Quidditch! Quidditch Finals that's coming up."
She paused, closed her mouth, and looked at Harry with an apologetic face.
"I don't have such a strong grip on Hogwarts, you know the reason. But Beauxbaton... I wonder, sometimes. Perhaps, or perhaps not. It won't be wrong to have more ties. The war is contained in the European continent, as far as I can recall, but there should have been impacts worldwide. If I can conduct the traffic in and out of this country, Draco may be able to find it easier to move when he takes over."
"Ninth question. Which part of the frenchman did he ruin first? His eyes, or his ears?"
"That reaction of yours is three years too early, but I'm glad to see it anyways."
Draco was not the first to be attacked.
Draco watched his father lean back into his chair, his posture unmoved from the sudden support lining his back. They stared at one another, Draco wishing for an indication of his future.
They did not know where they were and several had turned towards the fog in increasing adoration, as the sight which had carried them here between the hidden mountain paths was as impressive as the fortress before them. There were some towers, raised to the point where its yellow light flickered like fireflies in the mist, and the roofs of buildings which peaked over the fortress’ walls but smoked its chimneys nonetheless. A steady stream of water could be heard, somewhere, alongside the rustle of a forest. Durmstrang was an intimidating place in impression, and a mystical fortress in reality.
"Luna?" He whispered into his ring.
"It's Ronnikin'." They chorused back as though it answered all questions.
"Anger's mostly a foremost reaction," Blaise agreed, "for all the wrong purposes, mind."
"I'll talk to him about it, then." Hermione smiled in satisfaction.
"As for the upcoming Triwizard Tournament. I've been asked by our Minister to request Durmstrang's participation."
Draco shook off the needles on his foot from leaning on it for too long. The chair beneath his arm creaked as he moved away.
"Reassuringly?" He managed to ask.
"Sirius doesn't know much of Regulus Black, does he?" Erlnier asked back, "he doesn't care, whether he'd been against or with Voldemort, to him it's all the same. Those who were once threats of Harry Potter, remains a threat of Harry Potter. I suppose that's why he granted me access. To an ancestral home, no less. I thought it was due to his insanity, but our conversation had been insane, not his reason."
The woman looked infuriatingly calm, considering how many confusions she had caused both her husband and Vivian.
"Oh." Luna breathed out.
Draco hummed, and placed a galleon back down on the bar.
"I'll head back to France for now," Owen said, "I'll keep you informed."
Draco realised Marcus had leant Hermione his potions notes specifically for the purpose of bribing her. Draco glared at Hermione's head, and she sniffed, to but prop the book up further to cover her face.
"Does this ministry run on assumptions, or is it the gossip column which overruns the ministry?"
There was silence, before professor Flitwick answered.
"Ah, I know that," an old woman by the window rasped, "Crouch left first."
The students gasped, and there was a ripple of murmur before a voice sliced through the heated shouts.
"When can that title be redistributed?" Draco asked.
The magic tricked carefully into the window, away from the elf, away from the first floor.
When Ron opened his mouth, Hermione lifted her foot, and slammed it down. Ron's shout was muffled behind the bread she already had prepared to shove in his mouth, and did in the guise of offering novelty.
Luna leaned forward and closed her hands around his own.
"I think I get it," George said, "you're trying to say magic's more familiar with pure-bloods, aren't you? That's why your family, and all of them others, are saying stuff like mud-bloods."
"Luna and Blaise won't say a word, professor. Will you?"
"Yes. Blood, a safe to open, Ron's hair to disguise himself. Whatever it is, it can't be Ron."
"There's no respect for the elderly these days."
"Assuming we win the match against the Ravenclaws next week?"
Erlnier stepped back.
"You're smarter than the few I've seen here, Durmstrang would have been a fitting school had you been born with access to both sides of the world. The project is to be turned on the morrow, and mistakes would be unbearable. Sort your time, Granger, in the little hour I've spared."
Aunt Vivian had stopped her attempt entirely, and was staring at him in contemplation.
They sat in silence, then, watching the rain wash over France's greater landmark.
"Wait." Draco help up his hand, and shoved Luna down with his other.
Everyone had brought pillows and several blankets into the empty potions storage room. Draco had been suspect Snape knew they'd been hiding out since classes were closed, but hadn't bothered to say a thing. Draco similarly feared for the following week.
His words were ignored.
Draco latched onto Blaise's arm, and tugged him forward without considering Blaise's dislike for sudden physical contact. And for once, Blaise didn't complain of how hurried Draco had been, how fast they crossed the breadth of the room, because it was only so that they could escape further questioning on Blaise's part.
"So tell me," Pansy said as she lifted her nails to examine the pink stripes, "why were you fixated on Blaise's observance of a dog?"
"What the fuck?"
The lack of his parenting, the regrets and guilt of what could have been.
"Pardon?"
"Harry," she began, "Pansy, Luna, Susan and I are having a girls' night today, and apparently Blaise and Draco are holding a party in the abandoned potion's classroom on the third floor." Hermione increased the pressure on Ron's foot. "So why don't you and Ron take this opportunity to thank him, personally, for pulling Sirius out of Azkaban? It's a good topic of conversation to begin with."
"From Viktor Krum? Draco, do you know Viktor Krum?"
"He has a wife. He's alive, most importantly. If he knows anything, did anything, the people around him should know too. Combing through his tracks shouldn't be hard."
When Draco entered the room, it was to Luna hanging from the ceiling, by her neck, and swaying like the dead. The tray floating behind him dropped a foot before he recasted the spell in time. Nothing shattered, he turned back to her swaying hair and rubbed his temple.
...This was meant to be a boring story, with politics and stuff.
In his opinion, Luna had more happiness than himself. Luna didn't nod or voice an agreement but stumbled into the suitcase at the shadow of its presence, causing Draco to regret sitting at the forefront of the train even as he closed the lid.
"Harry?"
Professor Flitwick gestured for them all to enter his office as he waddled down a pile of textbooks. There wasn't much in his office but a bed, a messy table, and an even messier bookshelf, but the fireplace was ready and seemed frequently used.
"Why couldn't you have gone to Mr. Crouch? Percy sings praises of him." George chimed in.
"We are to figure out a way to break it to him, then. I seem to orbit around that child, my duties and jobs are all falling out of place." Vivian sighed into her hands, "so it has to be Narcissa."
Blaise agreed. Noticing the thin number of students with most having left for their exploration, he turned his worried gaze on Joheim.
"The and-stuff is what got Mr. Zaxter in," Draco said, sitting up to reach for a small portion regardless, "Mr. Zaxter's been a researcher of 'light' magic. He can't get more 'pure' than that, in their standards. Single, from what the papers indicate, no friends, no family, no neighbours. Except for the security part they failed to indulge, he fulfilled all the conditions of what 'solo' requirements they had. Besides, he's seventy. Just old enough to get in, and young enough for them to accept his passion."
"If you're thinking of them, you should know they're fine. You saw them with your own eyes, brother. You should stop associating young boys to your son, the sight of your gaze makes me consider another approach to your personality. A paedophile, was it called?"
He wasn't bound to secrecy in all but the unbreakable vows which sealed his tongue and mind. He didn't know who 'she' was, or 'we' referred to, and would not be able to piece together the purpose of their interests. Partly, due to their careful conversations, but mostly, because Vivian had long decided to alter the memories of his stay in both Azkaban and his confinements in detail, where all but his probable normal life retained on the day of his release.
"Yes."
"Yes. The very one. He was quite popular for being able to do a flip on his broom in his aerodynamics class last year. He was scouted into an actual Quidditch team, and the training has made a masterpiece out of him. Just
"Don't fall asleep." Hermione chided.
"Breathe, Karkaroff."
It was a sigh of boredom to its utmost. Vivian felt her fingers twitch. Narcissa had seen her for the past three months they were past acquaintances, and reigning in her body language was becoming harder the more fonder Vivian saw Narcissa's stone face to be. Although fond may not be the most adept description.
The man crawled, rushed towards the nearest corner he could find, and cowered.
"The House of Fawley does leave evidence of our existence. A student with the name of Fawley, a minister with the name of Fawley, houses, books, records. We've never disappeared from the public eye as a part of the sacred twenty-eight, but we've similarly never revealed the depths of our influence. The ones we leave in the public are ostracised, they live unknown to us and us unknown to them."
Draco glanced at the dementors which still presided over their lower banks.
Erlnier slowly struggled to grasp his words as Catherine turned to him with her blue eyes ablaze. Even when he had been first introduced to her against the fireplace, her golden hair had seemed streaked with fire.
A month of integration, another two months of social establishment, and the prior month of investigation had led him to this. This gaudy-looking, sorely traditional house reeking of hereditary magic that had turned stagnant, unused and simply gathered, like coins sitting for centuries underground until it turned to rust. The problem with hereditary magic was that it had to be used, to thrum between one's will and left to circulate like air, else it turned to this soiled, disfigured thing which was unusable.
"Take the floo next time," his father said with elongated words, "I see you're too weak to take any port-keys yet."
"Perhaps this conversation should continue later," Blaise interceded, "to get that map to work."
"And I would have expected better from an elf of the House of Black to greet someone of mine House's and own." Erlnier hissed.
"We were wrong," she spoke gently, "Coq au Vin."
"So, muggles. They weaken the wards?" George asked, unwilling to hear Draco's disappointment.
"Giving permission?"
Professor Flitwick's eyes hovered over Draco's fists, then the identical ring on Luna's hand.
Cedric looked as though he didn't want to be there at all, but he was, mostly out of responsibility for the company he deemed too young. Draco wondered if he felt sympathetic to the Weasley family. The fireplace crackled right beside him, and in the cozy armchair, Draco's mind wandered to the newspaper he'd seen when he first arrived at Hogwarts, trampled by many small feet, to at least re-read the publication on Sirius Black's escape. His body detested the idea of moving, however, so he remained settled in his armchair sending silent stares to Luna, who was lying down on the floor with her arms and legs stretched towards the ceiling.
"I didn't see anything." Luna affirmed.
"Please, enter." She said.
Draco and Blaise headed towards the library soon after classes ended, although Blaise had suggested more than once to turn their way in mild humour. Such humour could be considered passable to some they saw an acquaintance, Draco had persuaded, but clearly they were on a sensitive topic called fan-man-ship.
"What kind of question is that," Taysa snapped, "what two?"
She watched her friend's face turn red and smiled, mostly in endearment.
Cedric Diggory was a proud, yet eager-to-help Hufflepuff who took to his duties as both prefect and team captain with the same amount of responsibility given in turn and therefore, popular amongst all girls. He hadn't spared a glance at Draco the entire year, although it was yet to be known whether it was out of prejudice.
바이바이. 잘 있어.
"Of course, Draco Malfoy." She returned.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the memory of Felis scrambling to steal one of his chocolates his mother had sent, made from a delicacy speciality store in Belgium. He maintained that Felis had deserved to turn into a mouse for that hour, no matter how crude he was in his spell work.
"Don't involve Quidditch he says," Nartus whispers furiously, "anything but Quidditch. You'd have thought we were famous for our classes, but no, it's Quidditch!"
Luna patted his head as she thumbed through an accounting book.
They sat, and a few startled at the magic which tingled their senses the moment their skin touched the chair. Draco was one of the few, Blaise reacting a moment slower.
His voice was grating on their nerves, a deep voice with the lisp of an old woman's boredom.
"I believe I told you the House of Fawley keeps its records in a hereditary manner."
Considering Pansy was by his side, Draco understood Blaise's constant inclusion of Pansy Parkinson as a way of offering a new friendship between himself and the girl. Blaise was attached to his childhood friend, and merging one friend to another seemed to be his purpose of Pansy Parkinson's continuous presence.
Matthew hummed. He stared at the ceiling, then at his hand, then noticed the time which ticked on his wrist.
"How did you know where the kitchens were?" The twins asked.
"Aren't you going to talk to him before he leaves? Today's the last day."
Draco smiled, and this time, it was disarming enough for George to lean into Fred's body, and Fred to lean forward into George's back. The thick magic around them lifted, and briefly, they wondered about the darkness which had descended on them since Malfoy was provoked. It was his magic which dried their endless cheer and nonsensical words. Suffocating, they had obliged, but now the moonlight shone.
The woman seemed less than pleased to greet her, despite breaking her from her thoughts.
Well, Vivian leaned back with a startling realisation that she had shared a brief moment with Lucius, this also bode well. With Narcissa, with a court, with herself, something was bound to change in the most twisted manner she wouldn't have been able to place herself.
She was glaring at the twins, then specifically fixed her eyes on Blaise. Pansy threw the newspaper on the floor and raised her hands in mock-surrender.
"You're no transfer student, no-one even remembers you're from Durmstrang. Now. Be a seeker. And catch the snitch."
Chartres de Barr took a moment to understand before his face warped into a sneer and glare, the definition of a man who had found his displeasure. He himself had been one of the minor actors on Grindelwald's stage. Nothing but a passing supporter, who had escaped from Voldemort's reach in his quest to solidify his presence within the previous ideologists, until he was being asked to establish his reputation once more. A disgusted growl left his throat.
"Sirius must have transferred his Wrackspurts to you, Draco," Luna yawned once more, "it's a bit foggy over there, but the sun's coming."
"Like the dream I had of flying."
Zaxter Zimmer's eyes widened fractionally, but he ruled over his expression.
"Very well."
"So we will begin shaping your opinions today." Aunt Vivian finished.
"That's what you said," Erlnier protested, "and there the future's too vague. Preparation never hurts, something learnt far beyond my age, there is no reason for you to protest, you must have something to share, to protect."
"To summarise. Bartemius Crouch is the person at hand, here, as she mentioned Bertha Jorkins who's an auror under Ludo Bagman. He's the only government personnel who could possible walk in there and back out alive. There was a mention of memory charms, which, considering the mention of Bertha Jorkins, she is the subject of in either a positive or negative effect. Bartemius Crouch killed Monsieur Chartres who decided not to help him out, considering the teasing we know as mocking Miss Taysa saw. We should presume, then, Bertha Jorkins is a crucial part of this interaction."
"You get trained individually by her, do you not?"
There was a gaggle of protests from the aforementioned children. A ginger-haired boy with glaring eyes, Draco assumed he was a Weasley considering Fred and George's immediate reaction to pin him in his place by his shoulders, opened his mouth to shout.
"You fear him." Narcissa said, understanding the 'jester' for who she indicated.
Amelia Bones' eyes, sharper than what children could manage but nonetheless soft, flickered over their flushed faces, until it landed on Professor Flitwick's rasping voice behind them as he wiped his sweat with a handkerchief.
The room was freshly stale, entering the beginning stages of stuffiness where a wave of hands could possible clear room for breath, and steer the scent of pungent dampness across the room. Vivian stepped within as though her presence would clear away such a cadence. Across her the white-nested beard nestled against an old man's chin.
"Fuck." Blaise slumped against the nearest wall, and rolled his shoulders.
"Rose?" Draco repeated as he frowned at the note. "Who is a rose?"
Chartres was still creating a hostile atmosphere, so she invited herself to step over the remnants of china and sit before him on the armchair. She tapped the armrest in a desperate need for air, and the house windows flung itself open in joy that someone had finally allowed itself to breathe. Ignoring the glare Chartres was shooting in her direction, she willed for the books littered across the ground to be similarly organised.
"But you're using raw magic," Sirius Black narrowed his eyes, "of someone else's then? I would have never thought of Lucius Malfoy allowing his only child to be another's property."
Draco approached with a smile. While the change wasn't something he had to take pride in, he did.
"The Blue Wing's flying classes also deals with the actual theoretical applications of brooms and how they're handled, to the magical duration of flying. A very solid foundation, if you'd take up Quidditch in your second year. I hope to see you then." The girl said to them one last time, nodded her farewell, and moved away.
"How," Draco asked with a scrunched nose, "does that help your hair shine."
"I suppose, in muggle terms, this was the point where everything was dark. But when the two worlds were separated and the remains of wizards and witches licked their wounds in peace, the first imposer of the Statue of Secrecy, Josiah Jackson, appeared as the leader of MACUSA on American soil. Then, came the British with the Law Enforcement Acts, the French with International Relations, and so on. You should note, if you are ever in need out of trouble, that Gondulphus Grave's real name happens to be Nojan Fawley."
, the only trace left is the picked lock, he is a
"And to emphasise,"Vivian added airily, "only nine living people, including you, know of me as Livinnis Vivian Fawley. All others have only heard of our reputation, and I promise you, it can be utilised to the greatest effects."
The vivid green light shone in his face despite the curtains he'd drawn. He glanced at the time, half to six, and bemoaned his continuous lack of sleep as he turned back to the hand-mirror.
Jason nearly dozed as the meeting drew to a close.
"Choose wisely." She said.
Draco bit back his tongue.
"Are you referring to yourself?" Draco asked.
"Professor McGonagall, of Transfiguration. Head of Gryffindor House. Second to the Headmaster."
There was so much to discuss with Jason.
"There is always time. People think they have a limited amount of time to think, no-one realises how thoughts can outrun a single second of hesitation or conclusion. You're not writing, Draco. You are thinking. That takes less then the effort to move your hands, I assure you, you have time."
"Now, let me tell you a secret. It is a perceived notion in the magical society to use such fragments of memory in a special container, like Pensieves. Catherine uses the same theory in application, but rather drags the person in the replicate dimension of her own memories seemingly within herself. If it is not by her will, a person may remained trapped in Catherine's memories for the rest of their lives. That's the power of a replicated memory. But it's rawest form comes from the memory itself, which is what I hold, here. And placing this in another person's head-"
Catherine pulled off her brown boots, placed another cleaning charm across her clothes and hair, and gathered her hair. She had turned to Vivian as she had done so, extending a warming charm over.
"Regulus Black is dead, Kreacher."
The children were led out of the castle in rows.
"I don't," Draco cried out, "I don't know!"
"...Well, your son's not dead yet, is he?"
"Welcome. I hope you were settled to your satisfaction. I am Matthew."
"I'm 'fraid we only carry one 'ere. Ch'ken fricasse."
"...Will you?"
There were parents and children gathered across the front yard, a looming fort beyond their sight. The fort, in a word, was 'large', but there were other aspects which streaked starkly against the surrounding forestry such as the monstrosity of a gate if it could be called as such, the windows which were, not barred, but simple in design. Overall, it was a fortress made for war and of war, if the new renovations weren’t taken into consideration.
"You're not old! You're 73."
"No."
She turned down the halls, as his office was in the leftmost wing. There were tapestries covering the wood walls and floors, hovering lights which lighted the passageways passed and dimmed when no presence was in sight. But what Vivian found the most amusing, was the space and time ripped dimensions. She turned to the nearest wall which was without the most deliberate hint of difference and stepped through, only to appear on the third floor's corridor of mirrors, falling out of the rectangular mirror on the ceiling.
"Morgana," Luna laughed in exhaustion, "where are you?"
Surprisingly, Matthew's voice didn't grate on Draco's nerves as much. His thin, pale frame looked more fragile than threatening, his light brown eyes closer to yellow than brown, and Draco noted that his hair was more silver than grey.
He landed in his father's office with a glass paper weight in hand.
"The business with Sirius Black is of my own. Besides, the relationship between my mother and Sirius Black is a common misunderstanding. If anyone finds such little information a tedious task to find, perhaps returning a grade would be a better fit than society."
"Are you bound?" Erlnier asked.
"Oh!" She screamed, "I knew it! You are a Malfoy! I couldn't have missed that shade of blond anywhere."
Draco flinched at Luna's whisper against his ear.
Draco pulled up his socks.
Draco took a while to digest that, and was both horrified and awed at once. He could take this at face value, disregarding her perception towards his other identity. He didn't, as awed as he was.
The entire hall broke out in chatters. Jason, blinking the sleep which chased his eyes, roamed his closing gaze over Albus Dumbledore's face. The man looked as though he expected his speech to be interrupted instead of questioning how the representative knew, his wrinkles creasing into satisfaction of being right more than regret to the interruption which came to his mention of war, and as always, Jason wondered when he stopped trying.
