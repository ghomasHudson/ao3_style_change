“We could have taken them!” Harry protested once the charms were in place. “They had no idea we were here.”
It had almost been the perfect first date, if only they had actually been on a date and not on a meal out as colleagues. Draco’s heart ached with desire every time he saw Harry’s lips curl into a soft smile, and every time his vibrant emerald eyes landed on Draco.
“Yes, I’d like that,” Harry said instead, because nothing else mattered.
“Ah, we’re nearly to the village,” Draco said. “Allow me to buy your cousin his sweets, and put the money your aunt gave you towards your moving out fund. I’ll give you a little extra, too, so you can buy yourself some limoncello. It’s a traditional drink here in Italy. I trust you know your way back if I leave you now?”
“So there’s no problem with us sharing a bed.”
McGonagall nodded. "Excellent. I trust the two of you will be able to put your differences aside given the situation?"
“Who’s dead?” Harry asked. “You? Or is that a threat to us? Do you want us dead?”
Draco’s mouth went dry at Pansy’s comments, his stomach twisting violently. He didn’t know why it hurt to hear that he was worthy of happiness.
Harry’s gaze snapped to Draco, who shook his head silently as the planchette started to move in a figure eight over the centre of the board.
“Those laws don’t count against your friends,” Pansy retorted.
Draco had only added to Harry’s happiness, and every time he thought about returning home a horrid jolt would shoot through his stomach. Despite Ginny’s insistence that Draco was definitely interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with Harry, he still held fear that once he got back to England he’d simply slide back into his lonely life of depression once more.
Draco was still for a moment, before he sighed and shook his head. “I’ve never been turned on by a speech where I was called an arrogant prat, but I guess there’s a first time for everything. You’re a spitfire, Harry, but I’ll still be careful with you. You can beg me to go faster or harder as much as you like, but I’ll only do that when I think you’re ready. I have very strong willpower, you see, although you’re welcome to try your best to tempt me as I’ll quite enjoy that.”
"Why don't you just play Ron yourself if I'm so bad at chess?" Harry retorted, giving Draco a pointed look.
Potter frowned. “That sounds like a miserable way to live.”
Lucius and Narcissa weren’t bothering to hide their delight, and were smiled on at Harry encouragingly as he played. Vernon, on the other hand, was thrilled for different reasons. Usually he yelled at Harry to ‘stop that racket’, but now it was impressing the people

-In a little less than two weeks,-Draco said, looking into the direction Potter was starring at. Harry may have been talking to Draco, but his eyes didn’t come off Ron.
-And what did you choose?
-We are going in circles here, Malfoy,-Harry said. He wasn’t going to drop this. Draco was only about to find out that Potter’s stubbornness doesn’t know any limit.
-Lucy, I’m sorry!-Draco cried as Analise took her away. His eyes were red too, lips trembling. He held himself back from running after her, holding her close and just taking her away, no matter circumstances.
-Hogsmeade, obviously,-Zabini said and continued giving out the drinks. Hermione kept torturing him until he gave up and admitted that they bought the drinks in Hogsmeade and transfigurated them into books to get them into the school. Filch didn’t suspect a thing.
The kiss ended so quickly that Draco didn’t even get to react. In a second, he was cold again and Harry was starring at him with pure terror in his eyes. Draco could only imagine how much fear was in his own eyes. He completely forgot about his mother, about Hogsmeade and France. It wasn’t like anything he had felt before.
-You know, when I had nowhere to go and would rather die on the streets than go back to my aunt and uncle’s, Ron’s family let me stay with them,-Harry said, ignoring Draco’s question.
-Testified for Malfoy in court?-Hermione expressed his thoughts and smirked seeing shock on Harry’s face.
-I didn’t know about that…but I assure you, even Mister Potter wouldn’t have enough power to affect minister’s decision if you were truly guilty,-she said,-If Potter really helped you, it’s great. But it doesn’t mean that you “cheated” or that you don’t deserve your freedom. You do.
-How dare you speak my name, filthy mudblood!-she exclaimed right away and looked at Draco,-Hm…introduce yourself, young man!-she ordered.
-And you allowed it?
-Promise?
-I didn’t let him win, I’ve told you already,-Harry said,-It was a fair game,-friends were already approaching the common room. Harry mumbled the new password “Amaryllis” and the door opened.
-Come on, Potter, your head can’t handle that many thoughts at a time.
-What?
-Not me,-he replied to Weasley’s question and it took Ron a second to remember what was it he had asked.
-I volunteer at…..,-once again, the last part of the sentence remined unclear.
-I…ugh, I don’t know. I probably have something,-Harry mumbled.
He found Draco in the first place he had checked. Their dorm. Malfoy was standing by the window, squeezing a piece of paper in his hands. Harry carefully closed the door behind him, but it still made noise that Draco heard.
Harry ran through empty halls, looking out of every window he came across. Ron was still up in the air, but Harry had no idea how well he was doing. He knew that he was supposed to be there and his conscious was screaming inside of him. Harry was supposed to be cheering for Ron, yelling “Ron Weasley is our king”, being a proper damn friend. But no, he’s running across the entire Hogwarts, to check on a guy who couldn’t give less of a shit about him.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Be careful, Draco,-it was the first time Harry called him by his first name.
-Neither do I! So? You’re in?-it was the most insane thing Draco could do. He wasn’t even planning to go to that Ball, and now he actually considered showing up hand in hand with Harry damn Potter.
-I want a black one too.
-Tell him I got nervous and had to throw up. And don’t let Professor Hooch just hand me this position,-Harry said and ran towards the castle. He didn’t turn around once, too afraid to see Ron’s disappointed eyes on him.
-Morning, guys,-Harry said, seeing Ron and Hermione in their usual spot in the Great Hall and one thought immediately struck him. He still struggled with weight of yet another secret upon his shoulders. He truly wanted to come clean to Ron and tell him about his visit to the Ministry that summer, but their relationship was getting better with every day, and Harry feared that telling him would ruin it all over again. He told himself (and Hermione) that he was waiting for a perfect moment, but to be honest, hardly any moment could be perfect to tell your best friend that you had defended a man they both hated at a time in court and then lied about it for months.
-It’s pizza and you know what it is,-Harry put a plate in front of Draco and poured him a glass of coke.
-Since I found someone to impress?-Ron said, shyly. For a second Harry froze. It sounded so…not like him. But at the same time, very like him. Harry’s thoughts got messed up and irrational fear occupied half of them. Fear of Merlin knows what; of time that runs so fast that even his irresponsible friend Ron is ready to settle down, of still desperately unclear future, of the ball itself that is a week away and realization of who he was going there with still paralyzed him from time to time. And that “who” was actually the scariest part of all terrifying scenarios Harry had in his head.
And while Ron was enthusiastically listing all the pros of being an auror, Harry tried to find a way to express all his feelings in words and deliver them to his best friend. He will understand, eventually, but Harry couldn’t - didn’t want to -  see that look of disappointment, even if it will only be there for a second. Instead, he kept nodding and agreeing, hating himself for his cowardice. Defeat Voldemort? Sure. Crash your friend’s dreams to study together again? Ugh…
-You don’t have to take me with you! I could start working on saving the Manor
-Go where? Let go of me!
-If not now, then later,-Draco sat down again,-If she sells it, I won’t have anywhere to go. My home will be gone and I’ll have to go with her. No matter what I want,-Draco looked down and Harry sat next to him.
-Is it? I don’t want to go back there,-for a few seconds Draco remained silent. Harry just stood there, with no idea what to do. He had already forgotten about Ron, or Quidditch, or why he was there in the first place. He waited for Draco to say something, and accidentally touched the doorknob, that inevitably made a sound that Malfoy couldn’t help but notice. During that fraction of a second, Harry already cursed whoever had built and rebuilt Hogwarts. Why would there even be any doorknobs when the doors are opened by passwords?
-You got this,-he said, putting a hand on his shoulder,-Break a leg.
-Thank you, Albus. Now could you give us some privacy?-McGonagall asked. Dumbledore gladly nodded and disappeared from his portrait,-Now, do you believe me, Draco? -he nodded, not too confident though,- Your past doesn’t define you. You are not your mistakes,-Draco nodded again, a little more firmly,-And are you finally ready to take a look at your grades?-she smiled. Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
-I gotta go,-Harry jumped up,-Don’t you dare not show up tomorrow!-he said to Malfoy on his way out, preparing for one of the most uncomfortable conversations in his life.
-Shut up,-he said, but not in his usual playful tone
-Ginny?-the world in which Ginny Weasley shares the details of her love life with Draco Malfoy just couldn’t exist in Harry’s brain.
-Yes, you are,-Harry said.
Hope you enjoyed :)
-Are you okay, mate? You look…freaked out…,-Harry considered telling his friends about what just happened a very, very bad idea. Especially to Ron. Ron who didn’t talk to him for weeks because Malfoy was the first to find out about Harry’s plans for future. Ron who still didn’t know that Harry went out of his way to set Malfoy free that summer. Ron who still hated Draco and probably had a reason to. There was no way he would approve of what Harry had done. There was no way anyone would. What was he even thinking?
-Oh, yes, Ron told me all about it,-she smiled,-That Malfoy kid turned out to be not so bad, didn’t he?-Molly looked at Harry and he was paralyzed by the fear of what exactly Ron could have told her.
-Yeah…Yes, yes, of course!-Harry sat up and said,-We are together…going together, I mean!-he corrected himself,-It’s true, yes.
-Okay, Okay!-he hugged her again,-I’ll always be your friend. Even if you have a thousand other friends, okay?
-Give me a second!-Harry did his best to clear his mind. It worked. With a loud clap they disappeared and when Draco and Harry opened their eyes, they were already standing in front of the number 12 Grimmauld Place. Muggles’ houses moved sideways, revealing Harry’s. Draco gasped.
After a thousand more thanks, a hundred hugs and a few tears, Harry and Draco finally walked out of the orphanage. The sun had already disappeared, but the stars lighted their way just as beautifully. Harry breathed the fresh air and didn’t really feel like going anywhere in particular. Just walking around, maybe till the very sunrise, would be great.
-Then I'll see you soon,-Harry kissed him once again and once he let go of him, he saw a familiar figure approaching them from behind. Draco saw her too.
-I’m sorry, Ginny. I just…I don’t think I’m ready for it now,-Harry sighed. How much he wanted Ginny to believe him now. How much he feared she’d think of his words just as a lame excuse,-But I still want you in my life. I really want you to be my friend.
-I know, but you’re all that I have, so start thinking.
The snitch gleamed near Hufflepuff’s goal hoops and Malfoy noticed it. Draco was way closer to the snitch than Dora, but he didn’t rush to it using his full speed, instead he started moving pretty carefully, not gaining much attention from Hufflepuff’s captain. He was halfway across the pitch when she, fast as the lightning bold flew to get the snitch first.
-Did you play along?!-Draco looked at Harry,-Be honest, Potter!
-I pity the poor soul who will have to live with you,-he mumbled and headed to the bathroom.
The day ended surprisingly quickly, but was so bright and full of events that neither Harry nor Draco even noticed how children’s bed time approached. They played with kids all day, helped feed them, tried teaching them some basic skills like reading or elementary math, but that didn’t go well. (Draco also found out how ridiculously bad Harry was at math and definitely didn’t let that go unnoticed). Lucy hadn’t let go of Draco since the moment she woke up. The kids who weren’t as welcoming to Draco just ignored him and gave all their attention to Harry. He really was the star of the day. No one could believe The Harry Potter had come to their orphanage. Harry tried to answer to their questions, but they were truly endless. Some children didn’t ask anything though. They looked at Potter with something close to fear in their eyes. And it was absolutely heart-breaking for Harry to see it, the whole day was rather sad, but some of the parents of these kids died fighting, trying to help Harry. Which made him feel responsible for their deaths.
-Yes, and Quidditch always used to cheer you up,-Harry said, as if he knew the first thing about what cheers up Draco Malfoy,-Come on, don’t let me win without a fight.
After two hours players were basically falling down from the broomsticks. The audience, too, lost a fair share of its enthusiasm and now just wanted the game to be over. But the score was 80 : 40, and Ron was very, very unsatisfied by that.
-Okay,-Draco let go of him.
-Who were you talking to?-Harry asked, carefully approaching him. Draco was so obviously holding back tears that Harry’s conscious was eating him up alive for even being there.
That wasn’t even a lie, technically. Harry had already discovered that he couldn’t follow Malfoy to wherever he was going. Last Saturday, Draco left the castle at 6 am, walked to Hogsmeade and apparated. Harry stood there in his pajamas and invisibility cloak for about an hour and then went back to have breakfast.
-She went to find Blaise. What are you doing?
-Our? We will all live together?-a girl from Hufflepuff asked.
-Do you mind?-Goldstein asked Harry, about to enter the room.
And secondly, his date. Looking back, Weasley couldn’t believe he used to be THAT blind and stupid not to invite Hermione right away and to later give her a hard time because of his own mistake. Ron decided to make up for that too.
-Master Potter must be confused…,-he mumbled.
-Fine,-for what seemed like a thousandth time in an hour, Pansy hugged Draco and together with Harry they left the Great Hall. Harry was more of a tag-along - he waked behind them and didn’t participate in any conversations. He wasn’t even sure why he went with them.
-I’m not.
-Oh, you brought a friend again, how swell!-she said. Her glasses were hanging on the chain around her neck and once she took them on to see who Draco’s plus-one was, her hand shot up to her chest and the glasses fell back off,-Oh dear…Harry Potter!
-Leave him alone
-And what do they do when they see you?
-Mister Malfoy, please take a seat. How are you feeling?-Draco mumbled something remotely similar to “fine” and sat down. McGonagall opened a new binder that was in front of her. Relatively smaller than Harry’s.
-Malfoy, yes. I’ll get us dinner, you stay here and…don’t be too polite to the portraits. They’ll get used to it,-Harry said and walked out, before Draco could stop him.
-That sucks, really. But we still have to go to the dungeons. I have something down there.
-It could be. Or not. Depends on what you choose to do,-Draco clenched his fists,-Every single trait a person has can be both good and bad. It can be used as a tool to create something wonderful, to help you on a journey to the happiest life, or it can absolutely destroy it. You make the difference. You draw the line,-as fascinating and inspiring the speech was, Draco’s doubts didn’t disappear. How could they? If he is the one to make the choice, to draw the line, what happens if he makes the wrong choice again? How can he trust himself now, when two years ago people had suffered, nearly died because of him? And is it really about whether it’s worth it or not to make an effort? Does Draco even deserve a second chance, a redemption of a kind? Maybe he actually is free now solely because of Potter’s efforts and if it wasn’t for him and his connections in the ministry, Draco would be where he truly belongs. In the Azkaban, where all the death eaters are, all those who hurt and tortured innocent people, those who started the war who took away so many lives.
-What?-Harry looked out and saw Ron and Hermione starring at them through the glass. Neither of them could tell for how long they were there, but judging by Ron’s red shocked face, it’s been long enough.
-Malfoy!-his heart dropped when he heard a loud voice somewhere far behind himself,-Leaving without a goodbye?-Harry quickly reached Draco, still just in a shirt.
-I’m sorry,-he approached the desk,-Can I…can I have one?-Harry pointed at the brochures.
-Before the Ball,-she repeated firmly. Harry groaned and nodded,-What did you want to ask?
Ron Weasley wasn’t as oblivious and blind as people thought he was. Sometimes he just chose not to notice certain things, either for his own comfort, or for comfort of other people. Sometimes he noticed everything, but didn’t act on it. Sometimes he noticed more than anyone else did. And when Harry casually mentioned to him and Hermione who his date for the ball was – casually, but with terror in his eyes – Ron reacted the way Harry would expect him too; shock, a bit of disgust, a lot of mistrust. But inside, he admitted that it was a perfectly expectable turn of events.
Yes. I’m kinda bored. I’ve got the office all packed up and Grayson is off with his parents.
The new space will become an exhibition space or, gallery of sorts. Continually changing but with a core exhibit.
“The plans are in the library and there are photographs. I will show you before I go.”
“JUST USE PLACEMATS. THERE’S SOME PRETTY ONES WITH ROOSTERS ON THEM IN THE SIDEBOARD.”
“I can do the jewelry charm by myself too!”
“Yes?”
So now my short note has turned into a novel again. Sorry. Anyhow that’s what’s going on and I wanted you to know. Don’t worry!
You need a production facility, employees. You obviously don’t need a distribution deal because the customers are coming to you. We’ll draw up a contract and it won’t be just us throwing money at you to solve the problem. After the expenses we take a cut.
Yeah it’s a little late, Never mind. I’m getting ahead of myself again.
I can’t by law give the Minister seats.

“I know I’m not so good at it.”
“No, just carefully cleaned it. Louis was originally going to just have the Firebolt floating above it, but I like it better inside the case with the uniforms.”
“I’ll come up with a list of what I think is reasonable for a wardrobe and we’ll work from that. I’ll email it to you.”
NO. Still, no.

“Mr. Chen was very happy to see me.”
I would be happy to do that. You don’t have to hire me. I volunteer. It’s really just a simple tweak to the process.
Right.
Now what?

“Okay let’s do it!”
“UGH!”

You did?
“Shall we?”
Hold on.
Rita, dude I thought your animagus license expired. Get back in your jar.
The MHS Historians will plot and document the building. I’ve been told it should be swift. Mr. Bill Weasley will do a cursory sweep of the property for obvious dangers. Once the MHS documentation has been accomplished I will tour the home with my Family including Mr. Kreacher and the Black Family representatives.
“You two have been conspiring and plotting in the kitchen haven’t you?!”
“He’ll want to remember this and I had an idea. We can go with it if you’d like. . . . . We ask everyone to put a memory in a vial and store it for another celebration. Keep them in your vault. Maybe his twenty fifth birthday? Twenty years? I’ve brought vials from the lab at home.”
You CAN’T.
He’s resting.
“Baking powder and salt.”
In doing so and sharing the images of previously unknown works that Teddy has done over the years for our private collections, it was concluded that the works of Edward Lupin-Potter have been highly undervalued. People who own his works have seen the return on their investment increased considerably today.
Mother, I’m not sure I can take any more today. Can it wait?
About time Harry!
Oh great?

“What is that on his neck? That’s not an ascot.”
Just bring yourselves and whatever you want for the beach. Towels or whatever. Everything else has been taken care of.
Sounds good?
OH. That should be interesting.
“You want something simpler?”
You have no idea!
Mr. Harry J. Potter
Alright, let’s do that.
“Hello to you too Draco.”
“I have 6 bedrooms available between those townhouses and we’re going to use them. The top floor bedrooms are pretty much their own flats. We put one of the couples on either side. Put Mr. Elliot in #14 with the Bricks. Miss Zippy and Mr. Patt with Ms. Cibly and Ms. Keeley in #10? I assume they live together?”
“You never know what it’s like inside either, it might be too much work.”
Lucky guess?
So the family meeting is really going to end up being more of a party.
“Is Grayson back yet?”
“And his wife. . . .Ginny and I threw a huge party together to celebrate our divorce too. . . .it’s not weird for us. I’ll never stop loving Ginny. We just weren’t meant to be with each other. Scorp’s mum was very ill on that vacation. . . She basically told us not to fuck it up and there was no turning back.”
Not in the sense that we consider it. For instance, a wand would serve no purpose whatsoever. But he does carry the link that passed it directly to Lucy. So technically you could all him a TYPE of wizard because you do have an actual magical core, Mr. Evans. That’s marvelous.”
“Want Chinese food?”
LOL, I’ll bring Draco.
The boys love going to Grimmauld. They're over there a couple times a week after school. We’ve never really been to your place before to hang out.
But it’s pretty amazing. They are all dumbstruck. I heard a couple of them speculating that they may have been slipped a hallucinatory potion or something!
Because they asked me if I wanted the editor position first and I turned it down.
“We’ll leave the TV in the dining room for now, but we need to find another place for it.”
We’ve hired a great editor and she’s doing a clean sweep of the entire writing and photography staffs and no, Rose turned us down but we gave her first opportunity.
I’ll take care of that. We’ll have them cleaned up and remove the numbers as well.
“That works. Nothing has to be permanent. We can always come back. Do you like this Degas? It’s larger.”
“I do have to say it’s fun. I love doing it. Such chaos! “Harry we’re going to need more fish!” All day today.”
I haven’t been down yet but I’ve heard!
“Tea.”
“What do you like to be called?”
Minister Of Magic
“My Husband works in retail. We both work with Wolf & Badger. . . . we did meet you briefly at the lemonade stand but you were busy with a baby.”
“I told you I’d check in. Looks like you’ve got everything under control.”

YES PLEASE! All of the ugly furniture is in storage now! And we need to arrange the portrait transfer too?
Okay.
HEY! YOU LIKE MY SOCKS!
“Don’t be bitter just because your divorce was messy.”
Nothing to be embarrassed about. When you’re a parent you take the opportunity when you can.
“You are the Koala.”
You know I’m not going to take no for an answer don’t you? I WILL break you Nev! You are taking your beautiful wife on a vacation to Peru. REPEAT AFTER ME: I am taking my beautiful wife on a three week vacation to Peru. . . .

“I’ve always dreamed of doing something like this. When Uncle Harry asked and we came up with the original idea, I just expanded on it a little. We worked together on it.”
They made a blanket fort and spent most of the day watching tv. We’re in the fort now with the laptops and popcorn.
“Yes. It holds up well in this heat and I’ve purchased ice cream that’s under stasis to go with it. Fortescue’s vanilla supreme.”
“I’ll allow a fork.”
You’re joking. Come on Harry you are derailing my professional interview!
“FUCK YOU!! AND THIS WINDOW IS A GODDAMNED WALL. ROLLS UP INTO THE CEILING!”
“At least we know they’ll be in school starting next week. I thought Jon was going to cry when he heard about that. He’s going to love it. I think Davey thinks Luna’s going to teach him magic.”
“YES!”
Charles Demuth - Artist
“Merlin, yes.”
“I think we’ve both just let go of a lot of stress lately.”

I’m going to bring Draco and Mum in here and settle this once and for all. This is ridiculous.
“Talk to it?”
A traditional robe should be worn to the opening feast and house sorting. Purchase of robes is not required. Many former students have passed on perfectly new and useable sets and they are available. If you would like this option please just choose something from the robes closet upon arrival. MANY student’s regardless of economic status use this option as a convenience.
“You’re always such a flatterer.”
Let’s do that! 1/2 hour? Meet me in front of the carriage house. I’ll get Harry’s notes to him then change and check in with the Brick’s.
You're going to love it.
But it’s even better because it’s Auntie Luna and Dad just talking.
SPECIAL NOTE:
I’m really not joking. This is fantastic. They’ve taken over the whole house. Spoiling Mione and Rose.
Nothing.
“Okay then. Well. . . .Stop that you’ll leave a mark. What are you 15?!”
You have to at least get your Mum and Draco too.

One MASSIVE cushioning charm!
“Do NOT leave your flat. I’m going to ask you some quick questions and you have to promise to be honest with me.”
“It’s so cute.”
“Yes that should be good.”
“I see. And what is this beautiful fob?”
“Those rooms will be ready next week. Draco and I are moving to that level with Trandy while they do the construction on our wing upstairs. OH! We need another painting! Something for the smoking room so Decram can watch game shows with Trandy!”
Most Sincerely,
“Another thing to remember is that it’s only one way and that’s down. The pool is big. You can’t go wonky sideways and hit anything and the pool is so deep you’d have to weigh ten times your weight before you got close to touching the floor of the pool.”
I’m in for Malkin’s of course.
Oh merlin, you should have seen the look on her face when I pulled out that tiara.
“Is Robert okay with you announcing it like that?”

“Merlin.”
“Oh my god. That’s DANIKA with a black FRINGE!”
It’s my own invention! . . . . . . Come dance with me so I can kiss you like I wanted to at the ball.”
"I don't know your name yet!" Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air.
"Yeah, why?" Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Why?"
"Seriously, I've been standing here for the past five minutes, and all you say is why! Oh my Salazar, maybe I'm just sick of this stupid fighting, did you ever think of that? No, I'm sure you didn't, because I'm a Slytherin, and we just love fighting, right? Merlin, you Gryffindors sure are thick, you know that. Always going on and on about how awful Slytherins are when you don't even know any!"
Slowly, the castle came into view. Images came flooding into Harry's brain.
When it ended, both boys were struggling to keep their eyes open. "How'd you like it?" Ron yawned. Blaise didn't answer, merely dropped his head on the other's shoulder, and dozed off. Ron stared at Blaise in shock, before falling asleep himself, head casually resting on the Slytherin's.
"I am. My name's Harry." Pretzel's eyes lit up, and Draco cursed under his breath.
Harry figured Christmas with the Malfoy's might not be so bad...
"Come on Blaise, we have to go back to the castle now," Pansy said, her voice sweet and soft. He nodded, and Pansy pulled out her wand. She cast a spell to make Ron's body lighter, then cast another one to lift him up. Hermione did the same, and the three set off.
"Hermione, where are we even going?"
Slowly, Harry lifted his head up to look at everyone. Bad idea, because he could very clearly see the state they were all in. Harry choked on a sob, knowing he'd done this to them all. It would have been a thousand times easier for everyone, if he'd taken the curse like he was supposed to.
"Shut up, Pansy." She rolled her eyes at him.
"What's wrong, Harry?" a voice asked him. Draco's voice. All Harry could do was hold up the hand that was still holding onto the letter, and the blond carefully removed it, then read it.
"Oh, and he wants to talk to you, I suppose?" Ron stared to argue, but Hermione sighed, and pulled him out of the wing.
"Poor Harry," Ron whispered to Hermione, who was his partner. It had been a bit awkward at first, but things slowly shifted back to the way they had been before. Hermione laughed and shook her head. "What's so funny?"
He dumped the water all over Harry, who sat up abruptly, shouting, "I'm up! Hey...why am I all wet?" He glared at Draco, who was too busy laughing with Pretzel to notice.
Ron was waiting for them when they got back.
Hermione looked up at her friend, and turned to sob in her shoulder. Pansy whispered words of comfort, while she led Hermione to the couch. They sat down, and Pansy let Hermione cry, soaking the sleeve of her shirt, though she didn't mind. After five minutes, her crying slowed down, and she rested her head on Pansy's shoulder. Eventually the tears stop, her breathing slowed, and she fell asleep on the Slytherin's shoulder.
"I have my ways. Who won, by the way?"
"The world doesn't care about me. They care about Harry Potter, savior of the Wizarding World. Give it a week and they'd move on."
"No, I can't. I don't want to see it again. I have to watch it every single time." Harry swallowed, his throat tight.
"Just last week, when I took Teddy with me to the supermarket."
"You missed Hermione, by the way. She left about a half an hour ago," the blond muttered as they walked down the hall. Harry was silent, and he couldn't tell if he was upset, or if it was because they were getting closer to other people.
"He's always like that," Pansy responded. Harry snorted.
"What? You smell books? That's a scent?"
"What do you think?" he said, throwing the cloak over his body, seemingly vanishing. "If I just walk out of here after weeks, it'd be hours before we even left the common room." Draco nodded in agreement, and then opened the door to leave. Once he was sure Harry had followed, he softly closed it behind him.
"What, no! I'm going to the hospital wing!" Seamus rolled his eyes.
"Draco!" his mother cried, causing the two to pull away from one another, Draco with a devilish grin and Harry with an innocent smile.
Draco looked at him now, his mouth open, but no words came out. There was a faint pink on his cheeks, though Harry didn't even notice. Finally, he said, "Wh-what?"
"Who was the lucky bloke that made you realize you were bisexual?" Harry felt his face heat up.
"Who in particular do you want notified?" This time it was Hermione who spoke up, in a small, broken voice.
"Well, are you coming in?" Draco's head turned towards the soft voice, and a smile was quickly forming on his face. He walked in, and shut the door behind him.
"I do, but he's not there either. Come, on, I'll take you." She started walking and Harry jogged a bit to catch up with her. "So tell me, golden boy, why would you be looking for him?"
"I don't think so. The sparks are already there, they just have to realize it. Besides, after our plan, they'll be together within the week." Dean responded, laughing slightly.
"I don't need your help Hermione! I'm 18 for Merlin's sake!" They rode the rest of the way in silence.
"Because Harry bloody Potter fancies you too, but he's a very destructive person."
"No, Harry I didn't mean it like that."
"Before you all get excited, I will be choosing the groupings." The smiles dropped from the Golden Trio's faces. "Now, Miss Granger, why don't you work with Bulstrode and Zabini." Sighing, Hermione walked over to Millicent and dropped her books down on the table, Blaise joining the two.
"Making sure you didn't do anything stupid. Besides, figured you could use the company." Harry rolled his eyes, but smiled all the same.
Wormtail walked in, and Harry and Ron threw themselves on him. Wormtail began to choke Harry. But a split second of hesitation cost him his life. Another death. They rushed up the stairs. Bellatrix put a knife to Hermione's throat. Dobby dropped the chandelier, and they all barely escaped. But not before Bellatrix could throw the dagger, which found its way to Dobby's chest. Another death.
It was a relief when he got the letter from Teddy's grandmother. It was a relief when Draco invited him to stay for the holidays. Between the two, it would take up nearly the entire holiday, and he wouldn't need to come up with a dumb excuse for why he couldn't stay with the Weasley's.
--------------------------
"Are you sure?" Harry shook his head.
Harry's whole body shook, and he stared down at his plate, not saying a word.
"Yeah?" Harry followed Hermione's gaze all the way down to his arm, and he quickly tried to hide it, though the damage had been done.
"Master Harry, what can Kreacher do for you?"
"Hello, Lily. I assume you're here for Harry."
better," Draco said sarcastically, rolling his eyes as he lowered Harry back onto the couch. "Now tell me what's going on."
"So, Harry. Who was it?" Dean asked.
"Yes, I suppose she did. Have you eaten today?" Despite everything that had been going on, Harry had continued eating, and could eat a lot more now. It was still considerably less than what would be considered an average meal, but he was getting better.
"You still haven't told him?"
Draco grinned at Harry's expression, and nudged his shoulder with his own. Harry turned to him, seeming to come out of his daze. "Want a tour?" Harry nodded, and Draco grabbed the boy's hand, leading him up the stone pathway to the doors.
Harry couldn't take it anymore. He stood up, and just started throwing things. It was similar to what he'd done after Sirius's death, in Dumbledore's office. Draco watched as Harry made a mess of his room, not stopping him. He ducked as a book can his way, then cast a small shield around him. After a little while, when Harry was worn out and his room was a mess, Draco took the shield down. He placed Harry into his bed, then went around picking things up and repairing things that had broken. He was exhausted too, and still in a bit of pain from earlier, but he wasn't just going to steal Neville's bed. He considered leaving, but quickly shut that thought down. So he walked over to the couch, and fell asleep almost instantly.
"Sorry bud, but your mom and I have to go to work. I'm sure you'll make tons of friends, and then when you come home we can celebrate with ice cream with Moony and Padfoot. That sound alright?" James questioned, ruffling the boy's hair, causing him to scramble away from where he was glued to his dad, and send a glare his way. As intimidating as Harry tried to be, his parents only laughed, causing the little boy to pout and cross his arms.
"Now, go on, dear. We'll be back before you know it, alright? I love you," Lily said, pulling her child close and giving him a kiss on the forehead.
"Well we've been friends for a few months, and it was kinda a secret, but now Hermione, Ron, Dean, and Seamus all know, as well as you."
"This," Draco said, leaning forward and kissing Harry softly.
She told him just that when they were getting in the car. Harry groaned. "Don't even start Hermione, I don't need your pity. I was handling it all just fine, not that I knew what "it" was, while you were off snogging Ron." Hermione turned a deep red.
"Right, let's get Finnigan with Nott and Weasley, and Thomas with Goyle and Longbottom. Harry, why don't you work with Malfoy and Parkinson?" Harry couldn't help but feel this was all going to turn out horribly somehow. Things got even worse when he realized just what they were brewing that day. Veritaserum.
"I meant to the hospital wing, you prat." The four rushed back up to where Ron was, and he paused to look at Malfoy.
"You don't, you really don't. If you knew what he needed, he wouldn't be alone right now."
"Black, what are you doing here?" James started coldly, glaring at the old Slytherin. They had never gotten along, for Narcissa thought James was still a bit arrogant, even if his big head had deflated some. Oh, and there was the matter of the bullying. When Snape had told her about it, she marched off and gave the Gryffindor a good telling off, with maybe one or two well-deserved slaps to the face.
The next day, Draco didn't see Harry at breakfast at all, or in Charms. After class he walked over to Hermione. "Where's Harry?" he asked quiet enough so that no one else could hear. She turned to him, and sighed.
"Then why would she say that?"
"Merry Christmas, Pretzel. Could you fetch me a glass of cold water?" She  snapped her fingers, and a glass of ice cold water appeared.
"I'm sorry." Harry lifted his head up, and turned to look at the blond.
"Where exactly are we apparating to?"
"I'm breaking up with you." Ron's eyes shot open, and he sat up straight.
your company, and you're rather good for him. And do call me Luna." He nodded, and she left, leaving Draco standing in the door frame, unsure of what to do.
"You know, Draco talks about you quite often in his letters to us." Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco as the blond sunk a bit lower in his seat, face burning.
"Well I don't, so just leave it be, will you? Anyway, I told you mine, so go on."
" Harry, it's your birthday. You are not spending it in your bed sleeping all day." Hermione insisted. "Now get up, Mrs. Weasley's downstairs making breakfast for us all."
"Preferable? Who else are you considering?" At this, her face formed something of a scowl, though it was hard to tell.
"Where's Luna?" Hermione asked, scanning the common room for the familiar blonde who had been present just twenty minutes ago when Hermione had first left to pack.
"I figured it out about a week ago in the library while were doing homework together." Hermione nodded.
---------------------------------
"WHAT!" Nearly everyone in the room turned to stare at Ron, and he flushed out of embarrassment, now trying to seemingly hide, sinking in his chair.
"Oh my Merlin, did you just apologize? Wait, why are you apologizing for saying my name? It's not like you did anything bad." Why had Draco apologized? God, what was Potter doing to him?
'Lucius, he's not even staying here. Look at our son, he's happy. Don't ruin everything by bringing up all this Dark Lord nonsense, especially around Draco." The man gave a stiff nod, before the two began the walk to the doors.
"Great, how about we head down to the library before class? I was about to read up on soulmates if you'd like to help me with that. Speaking of, do you know if there's a way to change or get rid of your soulmate?"
"Actually Dray, it's Harry. He absolutely hates his last name, so you are now forbidden to call him that ever again. Any disagreements and I'm afraid while have to work this out the hard way." She smiled innocently up at her blond housemate as if she hadn't just threatened him. Harry stared at her strangely, before turning his gaze to the floor.
Meet us in the RoR after breakfast. We need your help with something.
"Yeah Rose, you're not the boss of me," Teddy said, sticking his tongue. Rose returned the action, and Harry set Teddy back down on the ground. The two proceeded to run around the house, screaming and chasing each other.
The sight he was greeted with when he approached the ferret's room was...surprising, to say the least. And yeah, he knew Malfoy had his hoodie, but he didn't think it would be
Harry had also spoken at Narcissa's trial. She was on house arrest for a little while, but at least it wasn't Azkaban.
"Why was he so weird?" Harry asked once Malfoy had disappeared.
"I came out to my father as gay before school began again, but he's still convinced this is all a phase. I'm hoping that if I have a boyfriend with me, it'll change things." Harry stared at him for a long time, making Draco's cheeks heat up slightly.
"Nothing Ron."
"I don't know, but this certainly makes things interesting."
The couple then went knocking on doors, taking note of everyone. Some were quite annoyed with them, but they felt that this mystery was far more important.
"Yes, get the ingredients, would you Pot-Harry?" Harry nodded, and practically ran away from the two, taking his sweet time in gathering the different elements for the concoction. He slowly made his way back to the two and dropped the many ingredients onto the table.
"No, I'm sure he's fine. Sometimes, especially during sixth year, he would leave and just spend all night wandering the castle. He's most likely up in the astronomy tower right now." Ron only nodded, and the two started the movie.
Harry looked up at Draco innocently as the blond held the stuffed ferret between two fingers, holding it out away from him. Harry burst into laughter, along with Narcissa and Lucius.
"Hello, Harry. My name's Narcissa, and I'm going to be taking care of you until your mommy and daddy come back. Does that sound alright?" The lady seemed nice enough, and Harry nodded timidly. The nice lady's smile grew.
"So I did imagine it then?"
"Dude, chill. Can I borrow your Wizard Chess set? Draco and I were gonna go for a quick game or two."
"What did I do?"
---------------------------------
"Is this blackmail?"
"Harry, I don't think you like Hermione," she repeated.
"Don't lie to me. Now, take them off." With a side glance at Hermione, he sighed, grabbing his wand. Hermione held her breath while Harry took the spell off. "Now take your shirt off."
Harry spent his nights doing homework, or lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He spent the days going from class to class, unable to pay attention from the lack of sleep. His grades were dropping, he distanced himself from his friends, he skipped every meal.
"Shut up Pansy," he muttered before taking a bite of the apple.
, of all the places Draco."
"Thank you Gin."
Harry nodded. "It's fine Hermione. Just please stop crying, I didn't mean to make you cry. Please stop, I'm sorry," Harry whispered, pulling her into a hug.
"I know, b-but I really m-messed up." Pansy sighed, and looked over to Blaise for help.
"Did you have something to tell me, Pretzel?"
"Yes, well I believe it was rightfully justified, seeing as what you did to him was much worse," Draco replied, pointing at Harry. It was strange to think that they had been getting along so well just a few hours prior, while their eyes now showed so much hate towards one another.
"I don't know," he replied honestly. Pansy looked at him awhile, before going back to asking the questions.
"He was curious," Ginny shrugged. "How am I gonna tell Ron, Hermione?"
"Oh really, how interesting. It makes sense though. You know, last year he climbed a tree just to get my attention."
"Yes, as long as you don't tell anyone as well."
"This might be harder than we thought, D." Seamus said as the walked into the common room after Harry and the Slytherin's little dispute.
"What are you, five? And I'm pretty sure it would be a potato man, since he's not made of snow."
"Well, first off, I was looking for you to make sure you were okay. Second, did you and Malfoy just hug? And third," he turned to face Malfoy, "you called him Harry."
"I can't, I can't forgive myself for any of this. The world would be better off if I just died."
They crept up to the crib, as silent as they could, and Harry peered over the edge. Teddy was still, eyes closed, thumb in his mouth. Harry was about to look away when Teddy's eyes opened, revealing purple irises.
"Let me grab my cloak," he said, turning to rummage through his trunk.
When he only managed to skim the fingertips, Harry flew lower, setting the broom slightly on fire. Gulping, Harry reached for Draco once more and pulled him up onto the broom.
"About five minutes, not too long," Draco answered. Harry nodded.
Avoiding the blond became evidently impossible, because Professor Slughorn partnered the two together for Potions. Harry walked over to the table where Draco was seated. "Malfoy," he said with as much malice in his voice he could muster.
Harry stuffed the note into his pockets, and went to his room to draw, before he heard Teddy crying. He stood, and practically ran to the boy's room. Taking Teddy into his arms, he held the child to his chest, rubbing his back until he fell asleep again. Carefully, so not to wake the child again, he set Teddy back into his crib, before turning to walk out. He almost screamed when he saw Andromeda there, a smile on her face.
"No it doesn't, and mind your own business," she said, playing along. Pansy sighed, wishing the two got along better. "Now, as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted," she glared at Draco, "is that alright?"
They ran up the stairs, which creaked and wobbled a bit, then into the only closed door, where the sounds were coming from. There was Draco, chained and gagged, screaming into the cloth as he got his with spell after spell. Harry ran forward and removed the gag, allowing the other boy to speak.
"Didn't you guys play chess just the other day?" he said, a smirk playing on his lips. Blaise cursed the other under his breath, and Hermione, Pansy, and Draco all turned to look at him in shock, then at Ron a few tables away.
"We know, we aren't looking. Did Harry tell Neville who he was meeting, by chance?"
Harry, who had gotten used to lying in situations like this, easily responded with, "Well Neville, obviously. You do know we're roommates, right? Now, what are you doing here? I don't really want to talk to you."
"Kreacher!" And then there was a house-elf in front of them.
"Deep breaths, Harry. Can you stand?" Harry tried standing. His legs felt like jelly, and he was lightheaded, but he still stood. "Good, now walk with us." Harry followed the two bodies, which he vaguely remembered to be Pansy and Draco. He started walking, though he wasn't sure where.
"Hermione, he's still not talking to us. It's been a week," Ron exclaimed as he flopped himself onto his bed.
Moments later, they had set off towards the shack. When they reached the Whomping Willow, they stopped.
Again, he pushed it down. It was then that he became aware he was on the ground, two bodies hovering over him. He felt nauseous, and his hands were trembling slightly.
"Do you think he's alright? What if he's hurt? Oh, Merlin, what if he's dead? Are we positive Theo took him?"
She scanned the Great Hall, looking for a certain Slytherin, standing up when she found the girl. Hermione made her way over to Pansy, smiling as she watched her girlfriend talking with her friends, loving the smile across the Slytherin's face. Pansy noticed the girl as she got closer, and instead turned her attention over to her.
Draco had no idea what the Gryffindor could be dealing with that Pansy needed to help him with. He seemed to have the idea that the boy's life was sunshine and rainbows, where everything was perfect. Apparently, he'd either been wrong, or Harry was overreacting about something stupid. Of course, that didn't sound like him at all. So, as much as Draco hated to, he accepted he must have been wrong about something.
"Who?"
"Of course he doesn't hate you. You guys have been friends for years, Hermione."
"Haven't you been listening! I need your help with something!"
Draco would admit he hadn't grown up in the best environment. His parents, more specifically his father, had taught him to believe in things he now knew to be false. But despite all that, he really did love his parents. He did feel that his father deserved Azkaban though. A man can make his own choices, and suffer the consequences to follow. His father had made his choices, and these were the consequences.
Draco threw open the door to his room, to find Theo there, looking like nothing had happened at all. Draco slammed the door shut, his hand grabbing for his wand. Theo looked up at the sudden noise.
"Anytime loser."
Harry and Draco walked in peace for a few moments, before Harry abruptly pulled his hand away. He started pacing, pressing the palms of his hands to his eyes, muttering meaningless words. "...so stupid...never work out...be dead by tomorrow...right after Ron...bloody selfish..."
"Y-yes," Harry replied, mentally cursing himself for stuttering.
Ignoring them all best she could, Hermione strolled over to the Gryffindor table. Oddly, Dean, Seamus, and Neville were all missing. Never mind that, she'd check the dorms later. She walked up to Ginny, and, keeping her voice as steady as she could manage, said, "Get Luna and bring her up to the Hospital Wing with you. Wait outside the doors, and do not enter until I'm back."
"Finally together I see," he said to the two.
" Happy birthday Harry!" Neville said, a huge smile across his face.
"Ok, so I kinda kissed Hermione, and she probably hates me now. I'm like, ninety percent sure she's straight, and she has a boyfriend. I probably ruined their relationship, and I just...what do I do?" She rushed everything she said, so it was almost impossible to understand her.
"No hugs!" he said quickly.
"Who would try to attack you?"
Dean, Seamus, and Hermione left because, unlike Harry, they actually could. Ron and Draco stayed back, though Harry hadn't really expected the ferret to leave. Ron looked nervous, and he stood up. "Listen Malfoy, about what I said-"
"Yeah, I mean, I want to, but Teddy-"
"Defense Against the Dark Arts, I presume." Harry nodded. "Are you going to take it?"
"WHAT!" everyone besides the three said, turning to look at the two.
"Merlin, were you always this stubborn? I can't tell you Granger. Figure it out for yourself."
Dean and Seamus sat down on the couch, Seamus's head resting in Dean's lap. Seamus closed his eyes, while Dean played with his hair.
"Mr. McLaggen applied, as well as Romilda Vane, but I'd rather not give the position to either of them." Harry thought it over.
Draco felt he wasn't allowed to be upset, since he'd hardly known the redhead. For years he'd made fun of the Gryffindor, all because he was poor, and didn't have everything he had. He'd called him names, ridiculed him countless times, and after all that Ron had still found it in himself to forgive the other. Draco really hadn't deserved the friendship, or anyone's for that matter. Because when had he ever been pleasant to be around? He'd tried to change, tried to fix his mistakes, but who was he kidding? People can't change that much, and Draco was no exception. Here he was right now, making everything about himself like always.
"Of course that's what I'm implying! I'm not blind, Harry." The raven-haired boy snorted at that, for he had seemed pretty blind last week in the corridor with Draco. "I see the way you look at her..." The last part was barely even a whisper.
He missed Lavender, and how she really was a sweet girl, despite the whole mess with Ron in sixth year. He missed Snape, though he really didn't know why, he just kinda missed him. He missed Tonks, and her clumsiness. Harry missed Dumbledore, because Hogwarts just wasn't the same anymore. Harry missed Hedwig, who had kept him company at the Dursley's during his summers there. Harry even missed Voldemort, because he'd become kind of a constant in the boy's life.
"He paid me quite a few visits in second year. Kept trying to kill me, he did. Unintentionally, of course. But I told him to stop, he didn't listen. He kept saving me, and then he..." A conversation that had started out lighthearted was rapidly escalating, and the lump in Harry's throat burned, the tears in his eyes threatening to spill over.
Harry scrambled away, running out of that damn house as fast as he could, Ginny following. They apparated away, and Harry thanked Merlin it went better than he thought it ever would. He was free.
"I really don't know." Harry laughed, Ginny joining in. "So, do you know yet?" Harry shook his head.
"Sandwiches it is then," he said laughing as they walked into the kitchen. The two came back out a few minutes later with a plate of sandwiches. Harry eyed them hungrily, but stopped when he saw Teddy.
Harry didn't know what was happening to him. He felt so many of those stupid feelings that only ruined lives. And they were all jumbled up, so he couldn't tell one emotion from the other. He was just one big, emotional mess.
"Who was what?"
"Out," he grunted to Neville, who left without another word.
"Hey Teddy! How is my favorite godson?" Harry said, tickling the boy's stomach. Andromeda watched the two, a sweet smile on her face.
"Whatever, let's grab Harry and go," James said, putting a hand on his wife's shoulder.
"Is he alright, dear?" Draco looked from the sleeping Harry in his arms to his mother.
"I don't know, I just threw some in there. Keep looking." Draco moved some of the chocolate around, until his hand hit something hard. He pulled it out, seeing it was a book. A potions book. "There's one more thing in there." Draco nodded, and kept looking. When he couldn't find anything after a while, he gave up, and dumped the entire box's contents on the ground. His eyes landed on a slim rectangular thing.
Pansy, Hermione, Ron and Harry all skipped breakfast that morning. Ron was still pacing the room like a mad-man. Harry was curled up on his bed feeling numb. Hermione was still crying, though not as hard, and telling Pansy what had happened. Pansy, was comforting her crush. Funny how so much can change with one touch, one word, one sound, one emotion, one person. In a matter of seconds, your life can change completely.
"I have no idea what your talking about," Draco smirked, shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth.
"Something wrong?" she asked, with a bit of humor in her voice.
Madame Pomfey snorted. "Maybe tonight, if I deem it fit."
"Teddy!" the girl shrieked, hopping off the couch. "Hey, come down here and play with me!"
"That sounds lovely, Mrs. Malfoy."
------------------------------
"Too late. Here goes nothing. Just so you know, you are officially the first person to know besides my soulmate herself, of course. Congrats!"
At Hogwarts, there are plenty of places connected with bad memories. Hermione wasn't sure Harry could handle it all. But Harry insisted he go, to finish his education. He had been offered a job as an auror a little while back, but turned it down. He had lost all interest in becoming one. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do, but he'd find something.
---------------------------------
"Who said I was."
He took a deep breath, and opened the door. Zabini was already there, laying on top of his bed, reading a book. Ron muttered under his breath as he made his was to his bed. Zabini looked up at him, scoffed, and went back to his book. Ron ignored him, and left their dorm to go find Harry and Neville.
*TW-Mild mention of self harm, I'll tell you when your good*
"Are you trying to be awkward?"
"So, Miss Weasley, how are you enjoying your schooling? Seventh year, if I'm correct."
"Wanna go to Hogsmeade sometime?"
Hermione waited for Harry in the common room, reading a book on one of the couches in the room. After a few minutes, he came down the hallway, and Hermione handed him his potion. He drank it, his nose crinkling at the taste. It tasted like old socks, and he should know, having plenty of gross socks shoved in his face before.
"No, I'm sure he's-"
After a few more minutes, Harry had calmed down enough. He told the others to go back to bed, and he went outside to sit in the grass, the slightest noise making him jump.
"Now we're married," he said, grabbing Harry's hand with his and intertwining them together.
Ron gave a small, yet sad, smile. "Tell that that to Harry. You know him, the guilt is probably killing him. When will he realize that none of this is him fault?" He buried his face in Hermione's shoulder. "I'm worried about him 'Mione."
"No, this is what he wants, not what he needs. One day you'll realize the immense difference between the two. Now let me go!"
He pulled back, keeping his hands on Harry's shoulders, studying the boys face carefully. "What do you mean you like me? Expand on that, please." Harry gulped.
"Thanks." Theo walked over to the set. "You know, he'll be fine."
When Harry first saw Draco walk into the library, his eyes immediately went to Draco's chest, where the scars were. Draco noticed, so he just blurted out, "Will you stop staring at the scars?" It sounded a bit angry, but needed to be said regardless. In a nicer voice, he said, "I've already forgiven you, and it's time you do the same."
"That's why Malfoy had to find you, isn't it? So you didn't do it again?" Harry nodded slowly, looking away in shame. He hated himself so much right now, for causing his friends to worry, for doing it, for enjoying it. Draco quickly tried to help the distressed boy, coming to his defenses.
"Yes, Hermione, that is what all this is about. It's my favorite one," he pouted, causing Hermione to roll her eyes.
"I-" he paused, not really sure. "I don't know, I just care alright.
"Headmaster, I think you may have made a mistake. I should have had to free Ron or something, not...Malfoy." The man smiled down at him, giving him a knowing look that Harry loathed.
Draco woke with a start, almost falling out of his chair. He looked around, and his eyes landed on Harry, screaming and thrashing around in the bed. The blond's eyes widen, and he tried to wake the smaller boy up. Harry gave a blood-curdling scream that made the hairs on the back of Draco's neck stand. Finally, after a few more screams, and a couple kicks to the face, Harry arose, his eyes filled with fear. He hugged his pillow, rocking back and forth on the bed. Silent tears leaked from his eyes, and he mumbled words under his breath.
to be selfish every once in a while. What do
Dean and Seamus were ecstatic all throughout the next morning, but no one seemed to know why. Truth is, they were up late last night, working on Operation Drarry, which is what they decided to call their plan to get Malfoy and Harry together. The plan had been going slow before, and they still hadn't really known what they were going to do. But then they saw the blond with Harry and Hermione yesterday, changing everything.
"Wha-that was not why I was in that tree!" Draco protested.
"Sixth year. You've liked her since sixth year, and you didn't tell me?"
"Draco," Harry whispered, ignoring the weird feeling in his chest, "Ron's right behind us." Draco quickly let go, clearing his throat a bit. "I'm fine," he said, then looked at Ron, scowling. "What are you doing here?"
"Yep," Harry replied, standing up. He walked over to the two lovers, and they apparated to Platform 9 3/4.
"I thought we were done pretending," Harry mumbled against Draco's lips.
"How do you know?"
"It's Malfoy," Harry whispered, so quietly he didn't even know if he himself heard it. By some miracle, his friends heard him, and Ron dropped his fork.
"That's me."
"Nightmare," Andromeda said under her breath, though Draco heard. He sighed, and shook Harry's shoulders lightly until he woke. Harry stared blankly at the wall ahead, as the moments passed. Draco didn't have to ask to know Harry had been dreaming about Ron again. Ron
The gillyweed was flavorless, though the texture made him want to vomit. It was smooth, but course, almost like a tongue. The sliminess was especially off-putting, and Harry may or may not have gagged slightly. He could hear mocks and catcalls from the stands, most likely directed at him. He knew he probably looked stupid.
"What happened to you?" he asked.
"Ok then Pansy," Pansy grinned at the sound of her name.
"Have you seen Draco at all today?"
"Ron, I'm not asking for us to suddenly become all buddy-buddy. Just being civil to each other for once." He thought again, and gave a quick nod. Hermione removed the charm, and turned around, so that they were all facing the blond.
"You can drop this stupid act right now Malfoy, Hermione's already told us everything. And you called him Harry, which was a dead giveaway."
"Harry, how could you not know? They're the smells you like so much. Surely you'd know what they were."
"How exactly?"
"You'll see Harry. Just...don't freak out, ok?"
"He ha-"
"Don't call me that!"
Harry's cheeks reddened, and he avoided eye contact with his supposed soulmate. He cursed his heart which was now beating considerably faster and blamed it on a sudden adrenaline rush. Pansy smirked at her new friend, before turning her head to look up at Draco.
"But they do," Harry whispered. "They always do." Andromeda squeezed his hand, and he took it she heard him, much to his dismay.
"What Potter. I need a reason to spend time with you now?"
"I'm telling you 'Mione, Harry's got a secret girlfriend or something!" Ron stated. The two had noticed Harry's frequent disappearances. And he was happier than before. Not quite happy yet, but happier.
"I get that. Come on, we better get to our classes before we're late." Ginny stood up, and held out a hand, which Harry took. She pulled him up, and he dusted off his robes, even though there probably wasn't anything on them. Another hug, and the two went their separate ways, Ginny to the greenhouses, and Harry back towards the castle.
"Then I guess I'll be back in the hospital wing. Not like it's unusual for me to be here anyway."
"I-I...let's just go eat." Harry shrugged, and called for a house-elf.
Harry also decided that he should be more concerned with everyone else. They were all worried about him, but he could see no reason why. He was fine. they needed help. They needed Harry to be the comforting friend they were used to. So he put on his old, happy, face, and he went down to breakfast.
"She's with Harry right now." Hermione raised an eyebrow, but said nothing else. She was about to ask Pansy if she wanted to head off to the library before she left, when the portrait door swung open, Draco rushing through it carrying a newspaper in his hands. He didn't normally read the Daily Prophet, since it was usually full of rubbish. But when he'd seen the headline, he'd quickly snatched the paper out of the hands of a second year, promising to return it as he ran off.
"Oh, well...alright then." Harry sat up, a bit too quickly, earning a headache in return. He slowly got back onto the couch, Narcissa eyeing him.
“Let me grab something to sit on, this floo is a pain on my knees. Should I get your mum?”
“Did you think for a second that would be an issue with us?!”
“I think it’s relief on her part.”
“I don’t? You said we needed a specialist!”
“I suppose so. . . It’s just so unnerving.”

“Fine. Open them up for those too. So then we move on to the guest floor.”
Who’s bringing what? I might show up late, I’m testing the painting on Saturday.
Probably.
Would the headmistress allow you to bring the portrait to Grimmauld for a while? It’s pretty big, but we could set it on an easel temporarily and be able to consult easier.
I’ll have it to you tonight. I’ll get Jenny on it with my instructions. She’s the best I have. We have all of the measurements we need. Expect an owl delivery before 21:00.
Okay. I’ll come home without the chicken feet.
Average or extra overboard?!
“You guessed it!”
See was that so hard? DONE!
Well, I actually signed off on it yesterday. At least no one can accuse me of accepting a bribe or insider trading. Right? Do I need a lawyer?
——————————————————————————
“What do you think Jon? Lunchtime?”
Well I suppose since I’m airing my laundry for everyone they may as well hear it. Yes. Mum was MAD with me. MERLIN. But “WAS” is the term I’m going to use because it’s better now.
Scorpius-soon-to-be-Malfoy-Potter don’t you even JOKE about it! You are not leaving your pregnant fiancé for a younger man!
Not what I meant. The Goblins in Iceland can do the hiring for you. They are already working for you. I’ll bet they have it already in place just waiting for the word. Probably a whole team ready to go. Just tell Liogell you want it done.
How would you feel about writing something on the line of
“Harry said you’d like a pendant. I can make it more decorative. I was thinking the shape of an owl like your Snabb. Would you like that?”
I swear I have no idea what this is about.
“Why, thank you Mr. Lupin-Potter, yes you may.”
You should see my parents. They are serious. I think my Dad has toys lined up for 10 more kids!
“Do I still have to go fishing? I’m still not so sure about that. Scorp said it was fun but I’m not sure.”
“She’s actually got Scorp’s nose, I think. Hard to say.”
At this time it is traditional for the escort to hand the betrothed to the surrogates. Both Mr. Trandy and Ms. Zebb held both Albus and Scorpius back for a heartfelt embrace and kind personal words before letting the wedding continue.
“Are you kidding? I’d love that.”
“I’m talking about the fish. The last thing that Harry said he needs to finish the conservatory. That’s the last element of your marriage goal. A million Muggle pounds well spent I think.”
If they get to be too much just tell them that you’ve got to get to bed or something. And fair warning. Family is FULL of art nerds so if they start going on about it you’re free to say good night.
“Don’t just say yes to everything. . . . . Raymond Duchamp-Villon.”
GAWD. You need a favor? I’m at Graysons.
I hate movie theatres any more. People are too rude. Talk through the whole thing.
Edit: as I find the errors.
First I need someone to research what Dud is paying for that flat. In Muggle pounds. Then tell me the difference. At least what the market rate is for that flat. If he wants the townhouse I want it to be affordable for him.
Owl Post to:
“We just came home from the Children’s Society. It was an emergency. Two boys. Five and nine years old. We’re home with them right now.”
“Uncle Harry, you’re crazy.”
Owl Post to:
Don’t be silly, it’s fine. We’re all very curious and excited, but I don’t want to be pressured into anything like that. I need to develop a certain level of trust with Albus and this is a good opportunity for that. I don’t want him going into the marriage feeling like I will try to manipulate him.
“Apparently now we do.”
“Harry, look at the carpet runner up these stairs.”
Replace roofing with standing seam black metal to match main house.
More than ever.
LOLOLOL.
Location: Harpies Quidditch Field - Spring (following quidditch season).
“It’s not that, Davey.”
“This is quite a spread. Is that Zebb’s roast beef? Oh yes, start carving that splendid creation right now.”
Hey Grayson. Things going okay?
“I don’t have a trunk, just my backpack and the bag from Lily and Rose . . . . . I’ll finish packing tomorrow.”
“It’s like walking with wind!”
“Underneath the black mold it might be quite nice? Try a cleaning spell on a spot.”
Edit: Typos ;)
It was such fun to have you back at the school for our interview.
“Foundry in Cornwall. They’re on standby, I’ll get them started.”
WOAH! Awesome job Sean!
I think that pretty much covers everything we need to go over today? Unless there are other questions?
“That’s genius!”
The sassy portrait delivers a surprise of his own.
“Sweet! All ready to go!”
“YES!”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Congratulations to Lucy! You’re going to get your things?”
“Awesome.”
“Wow this door is heavy!”
“You registered your ward as “Voscantvidere”.
TEDDY! I WILL!
LOL Harry.
You forgot one.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!”
“Hazelnut. Have you even tried it?”
“Stone?”
“What is it?”
“Fuck. Potter, what was that!”
Sad doesn’t begin to explain it.
When a young person comes into a magical education with no knowledge of our traditions they must rely on hearsay. For many, many years our history of magic department was run by a dead man for Merlins sake. Why? I would loathe to say that it was because the Wizengamot enjoyed an entire department headed by an entity that didn’t require compensation. Today we have a brilliant history department headed by a competent professor, but he has been given limitations on content. With your actions earlier today I can now promote his assistant to a professorship and not just leave him languishing in limbo of perpetual consultant. With the Referendums on the table we may also be allowed a more balanced program.
Wear silk undergarments that will help. A BIT.
Guess who what?
Not a problem.
She can have her fucking tea cup. I’ll deliver that and the termination papers to her personally.
Yes! Send it to Grimmauld? I’ll be there this afternoon.
“He would never disclose the location.”
Grimmauld Place?
Yeah, we really like our mornings. She’s teaching me how to make better breakfast foods too! Mr. Brick likes poached eggs.
“Yes. Grayson, shrink that water tank.”
. . . . . . . . . .

“Where’s my Davey?”
“Louis is a fucking genius.”
I already told you the only thing I can think of are those dishes, but I can come over and have a look one last time before we get started. I’ll bring Jerry and he can have another look at the front.
“Someone clearly loved it because it’s spotless. Oh, I’ve put that stout you like in this cooling cabinet for later.”
I like the original knobs and stuff. Just clean it up? And get rid of that monster butcher block. I hate that.
Okay. TTYL
“It’s a plan at least.”
The owl seemed to enjoy.
“Said he went to look for you guys?”
This Grimmauld project is intricate. It’s not like at the Centre elaborate but it’s still a big undertaking. And we’re doing it with a super small crew because we want to keep the disruption to a minimum. But that means we don’t have someone on hand to answer a THOUSAND QUESTIONS!
I’ll give tours of my train room and help out Bee if he needs it. I’m actually interested in how it’s going to go. And it really is a rehearsal for the potion convention. We’ll want to see how it works. We can always at least go up to our level if we need to get away from the crowd?
Broom shed. Let’s do that first instead.
“I’m exhausted but not tired yet. I need one of Trandy’s pepperups.”
“Like this?”
Not just that. Being out with him in Diagon holding hands?
Didn’t think that far ahead??????
. . . . . . . . . .
Yeah, as long as I’m not just asking for a handout I’m okay with it.
We promise not to gang up on him.
“So much better!”
“Disco Inferno for your Uncle George?”
So proud of you Ginny, I am speechless.
Don’t know yet? What’s up?
"You should be. You have to take this very seriously."
“We gave up on that a LONG time ago Mione. I think Draco lost the stone face back on round two!
Unless you decide on some major changes,Yes.
They’re coming all the way from Japan! I had to use the Muggle credit card. The one without a limit. That INCLUDES the transport. AND Mr. Maeda is going to personally place them in the ponds. He’s even throwing in some FROGS! They’ll be here on Thursday. It’s the last thing to finish in the conservatory and then it will be ready for Saturday.
“Here.”
“Buttercream I suppose? It’s for a wedding.”
We’ll have everyone over and plan something larger for after the wedding. It will be especially fun when the weather’s more predictable. The back patio is AWESOME.
We just share a lot of the same interests!
“I helped your mother reverse a memory charm but this one is very different.”
Lemons and mint? I’ve got plenty of sparkling water & sugar. Lucy has mastered making ice. Please ask Mr. Trandy if he has more lemons?
“A little better? I know there were tears. I’m sorry about that.”
Oops. I should pay more attention.
“Where’s that?”
Sorry about the cologne. You guessed right, Ron doused the letter with “Old Spice” (muggle gift from his Dad) because . . .well Ron reasons. He saw the reference to your scented parchment and then . .well . .Ron.
“Ha!”
“Yes, but very rudimentary. It’s a practice space. Not meant for actual brewing. Just learning techniques and theory.”
I knew he was interviewing staff at Gringotts, but that was just yesterday afternoon.
“On the count of three. One, Two, Three.”
“I like your honesty. And I also know you’ve had quite a busy weekend!
Yeah they’re evasive. Don't read too much into it. It’s their job.
We’ve been told that the weather is too nice to use the dining hall. Then suddenly there’s a full freaking outdoor kitchen and a whole beverage bar set up on the patios. Miss Parks and the whole staff seem to be having a blast.
“What needed thinking through?”
. . . . . . . . . .
“I like my birthday just fine. I just do it different. When I was little I didn’t have birthdays. Mister Hagrid and I spend that day together. I’ll explain better someday, but I like my birthdays.”
“This smells like the one you made for me in school.”
“What do you mean unfou. . . . . .oh.”
The library is okay except for the upper atrium level?
“No, I can’t do that, but you’re going to take advantage of your Harpies contract for at least a few weeks until you’re more comfortable.”

“I guess you can now? At least Mother can?”
Cans of muggle beer would be appropriate. I’ll run to the Tesco!
“And you are just the same for him. BLIND!”
Please explain.
“Alright you two. You can stop now. Does this mean I have to speak to it every time I want through?”
“Not just a throw away comment, Dudley.”
Sorry, I don’t date married men.
Ignore them! Eric how do you do that?
“Did they ever?”
“How did it work?”
Ugh. Okay you don’t know that we’ve already had both of the townhouses all fitted out. Trandy and Zebb put in all new linens and towels. Cleaned them top to bottom. Pillows, Comforters etc. Zebb stocked the pantries. We have pilfered some of the war china and utensils from #12. I’ve have had televisions installed in the front rooms and stocked the bedrooms with a few extras like toiletries. Even some of Scorp's soaps and shampoos, cozy bathrobes and muggle radios.
-Out of all people, you shouldn’t be the one to say that to me,-Harry said
Lucy had asked that question before. Only once. Draco tried to distract her then and didn’t answer it. Of course, he didn’t want her to grow up in this place, but her chances for adoption were rather small – people tend to go for younger children – and Draco himself had so many problems to go through, not to mention his reputation. There was only so much he could do to help her and chances are, nothing wasn’t going to change. And now, she asked him again and he still didn’t have an answer she wanted.
-Okay.
-Morning.
-Yes, you’ve never actually rejected me, but come on. You knew I liked you since the day we met. But you only started noticing me when I’ve moved on,-Ginny said. Harry had nothing to resist with. She was right.
-Shut up,-he said.
-I want…I want to help more people than I’ve harmed. Make up for what I did,-he quickly mumbled with his eyes still closed. It was easier this way. For a few moment Headmistress office was absolutely silent. Minerva wanted to go back to that conversation and reassure Draco that he didn’t actually have much to make up for, but at the same time…if it truly was what he wanted…
-I…I…,-he took a deep breath. Right. He was supposed to be the brave one,-Right here. Ready?-he asked, looking up at Malfoy.
Even if Harry did plan to do that, he really wanted to eat first. Potter did his best to lay the table, but if Sirius’s mother saw what was brought to her old table, in her old kitchen, she would have a heart attack.
-Okay, I’m bored,-Pansy said after at least 30 minutes of discussing everything she had missed about Hogwarts. Draco did omit some details, but still was particularly open with her,-Let’s go to the common room,-she asked Draco.
Heyyy
-I…I’m gonna check on Hermione…in the library,-Ron mumbled and took off. Harry saw him out with eyes filled with jealousy.
-Why do you even need to ask her?-Harry wondered, going through endless shirts and trousers offered at the stores. They declined the help of the saleswoman and decided to find everything themselves,-If you’re already dating. She wouldn’t go with anyone else, would she?
-Yes,-Draco said. He wasn’t. And Harry didn’t know how to comfort him,-I…I’ll see you in school,-he said and disappeared – apparated. One second he was there, and another he wasn’t. Harry followed his example in a moment, but Draco was already on his way to Hogwarts when Harry appeared in Hogsmeade. They walked into the castle almost at the same time; Draco wasn’t crying anymore, but he didn’t look like he was eager to talk too.
-Are we just going to stand here like this?-Draco asked, nodding at their touching hands.
But still, Malfoy remained as untouchable as ever. Harry’s rare signs of attention were completely ignored and often glances during classes were never returned. Draco acted cold, colder than ever. And that just sharpened Harry’s interest.
-Are we accusing Draco of not stopping Lucius Malfoy, one of Voldemort’s closest and most powerful allies?-Harry was getting mad,-He is not his father,-Harry added in a much calmer voice and Draco looked up at him again. Potter never took a seat that was offered to him before, and was standing tall beside Draco,-And accusing him of his father’s crimes is not fair.
-I came with Draco. To help,-Harry said, feeling exceptionally stupid and out-of-place,-And please call me Harry.
-Morning, Malfoy,-Harry stood upon him. Draco looked up at him with a bored, lazy glance.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Oh,-the girl already calmed down, more or less, and now was lying in Draco’s arms as he stroked her back and whispered apologies.
-How do you know?-asked Harry.
-Likewise, Mr. Potter. Ready to start?
-I mean here. Are you still not talking to Weasley?-Draco seemed genuinely surprised by that thought. In his mind, a conflict like that would be resolved in a minute, especially between two best friends.
The Saturday before Quidditch auditions that ex-Gryffindor trio decided to spend in Hogsmeade promised to be bright. There was a lot to discuss, even except for Ron’s favorite topic, Quidditch. Headmistress just announced that there would be a Ball right before Christmas break. A Ball. Again. Harry could have sworn that he heard the whole school groan once McGonagall told them about it. She said it would be useful for students to have a little fun, a little celebration after the war. Harry thought it was an unnecessary reminder of two things. First, the said war. Second, Harry has no one to invite.
-I told you, everything is okay.
-When?-Draco shrugged,-Library, tonight. You’ll help me with the potions assignment,-Harry said, as if he had a right to demand anything from Draco. Malfoy sighed and mumbled “Fine”.
-Yeah and who’s fault is that?-Draco mumbled “whatever” and sat down on one of the chairs. Harry was standing beside the fridge. A still empty fridge.
Choosing uniform was a whole issue for the team. The players obviously had to look different from the others and their old uniforms didn’t serve that purpose anymore. Ron did his best to arrange a proper meeting and discuss what kind of uniform everyone wanted. Most of them just shrugged and said “whatever you want”. Draco didn’t even show up on the meeting. One of the few girls on the team offered to make a compromise and combine all 4 main colors of Hogwarts houses in the design, using black as the base. Ron didn’t come up with anything better. He tried to please everyone, and in the end, they all hated the result.
-Goodbye then, Harry Potter,-Draco offered him his hand,-I want you to know that I do wish things were different,-If even a year ago someone had told Draco he would say those words to Harry, he'd laugh at their faces. But now their fake hatred didn't matter. After the war past enemies didn't seem like enemies anymore.
-Why are you sitting here?
-It was amazing, oh my God,-he kept laughing, already gaining strict glances from Madam Pince,-You just saved my life, Malfoy.
-Okay, where did that come from?-Hermione asked, pointing at the table. The whole 8th year class gathered in their common room, accompanied by a few friends; Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, Astoria Greengrass and some other younger Slytherin girls Blaise invited. Blaise himself was behind the table, chuckling at Hermione’s question. He looked at her with a sly smirk and started opening many bottles of firewhiskey standing on that table.
“Yes, but Ron and Hermione did just as much”
-Me making any decisions. Is it even…worth trying?
-I had no idea you were this good with children,-Harry whispered to Draco. Lucy was already sleeping, her head on Malfoy’s lap. He was carefully stroking her hair.
-No time! 15 minutes till the portal closes! Let’s go!-Draco fought for another minute, at least trying to buy himself some time until Harry returns. But he didn’t, and Draco had no choice but to follow Filch. On his way out he tried calling for Ron or Hermione, to warn them, to ask them to warn Harry too, but they didn’t hear him. Draco couldn’t believe he had to leave like that. Just for the holidays, but still.
-I don’t know,-he sighed,-I just…want something different.
-You are a horrible liar, Potter,-Draco said, smiling too. His cheeks were slightly pink, while Harry’s face was bright red.
-See you soon,-Harry smiled. His cheeks blushed, his lips were brighter and more red than usual, his hair was even messier, if that's possible. But he looked so happy. So did Draco.
Harry stopped in front of the pub and looked inside through the window. Yes, that’s what he thought. Malfoy was sitting all alone at the table in the corner of the room. He had a glass of butterbeer in front of him and was staring outside through the glass, thankfully not noticing Harry.
-If you saw it, why are you asking me?
-Do you think I could…?-Harry didn’t dare to finish that sentence.
-I…,-Harry closed his eyes and teleported back into that moment. He quietly sighed,-I kissed him
-Oh, Ron. I didn’t notice you,-Ron had that look he always had before starting a fight. Cheeks a little red, eyes slightly narrowed down, jaws clenched.
I think I'll update this series every other day, but more comments and kudos may make me reconsider and post every day!
Even from the tribunes Harry could see Ron blushing. He chuckled at his friend, but his happiness didn’t last as Kadi Bush scored first 10 points for Hufflepuff within the first 5 minutes of the match.
Malfoy himself was always good at acting as if bad stuff hadn’t happened at all, when he needed to. In the morning he didn’t even look at Harry, walked out of the common room, ignoring Potter’s “Good morning”. However, it did attract the attention of everyone else in the room, including Ron, who looked at Harry as if he had just blown a kiss to Voldemort himself.
-What do you mean?
-No, and I don’t need to, to know that it is disgusting.
Harry nodded, but inside, he didn’t like it at all. Draco seemed pretty into the idea of challenging Harry yesterday, and despite everything that was still going on with him, Harry believed Malfoy wouldn’t miss that opportunity. But time passed, Chasers and Beaters were found. A couple people wanted to try out for a Keeper’s position, which would take approximately half an hour. Then it’s seeker’s turn.
-Sure,-Draco felt a little warmer, just going beside someone, just going beside Harry. He hadn’t seen his mother in a long time and she wasn’t exactly happy when Draco refused to move to France with her and only agreed to spend holidays there. But Potter’s presence distracted him from nerves and anxious thoughts.
Harry and Hermione ran towards the pitch. They were both out of breath from all the screaming, but the feeling of complete rapture took over them both. Hermione immediately jumped into Ron’s arms. She kissed him and he kept laughing and smiling, holding her in his arms. Harry watched them with one eye as he finally found Malfoy in the crowd that filled the Quidditch pitch. He pulled him towards himself.
-It’s breakfast,-Draco put a piece of an apple pie on his plate, ignoring Harry who still was standing right beside him, now gaining a lot of attention from other students.
-I don’t want to go back to school now.
-He’ll catch it,-Harry said,-He’ll catch it.
-And she’s not even sorry about it. “I’m sorry if you’re upset”, of course I am upset!-Malfoy was getting angrier with every second. He got up and started walking around the room, throwing hands and almost yelling,-Isn’t it just awfully selfish? Selling the manor, pretending nothing ever happened? What will father thing when he finds out? He’ll call me a traitor!
-Yes,-Draco sighed.
-I would have remembered that.
-Has it been like this before? In Gryffindor?-Anthony Goldstein, a Ravenclaw student, who Harry knew back in DA days asked. Harry shook his head. Ron shrugged and tried to walk into the same dorm, but it seemed like some invisible obstacle didn’t let him do it.
-Listen, I don’t want to pressure you into anything you don’t want. I just want things to be clear between us, okay?-she asked, not a single sad note in her voice.
-Well, that’s not really what happened. But you are unbelievably dumb. Do you not know any other girls?
-Soon,-he smiled and watched Harry walk away with calm heart. Harry turned back to him every 3 seconds, making sure it was all real. Something he wanted since his 4th (or third?) year in Hogwarts just happened. Obviously they will meet again.
Harry watched him from his seat, surprisingly all alone. Draco, who always found a way to show up in the Great Hall before Potter did, was now very, very late. Harry looked at the clock every 3 minutes and waited for Draco upon his now empty plate, and when by the end of the breakfast Malfoy still hadn’t showed up, Harry had no choice but to leave without him. Until…
-Because then it will be your win. Not his,-he nodded at unbothered laughing Ron. Harry rolled his eyes, got up and disappeared outside the Great Hall.
-Is Master Potter sure?-Kreacher made one last attempt to hold on to his home.
The confession was met with complete silence. Harry still had his eyes closed and couldn’t see the faces of his friends, but was sure that they definitely looked straight at each other and Ron probably had to resist an urge to throw up.
But that didn’t mean Draco would welcome Potter into his almost non-existent inner circle with open arms. If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d assume Malfoy was onto something again, that’s how suspiciously quiet he was, and every time these thoughts kept coming back, Harry had to wake himself up, remind himself that the time when he could easily be betrayed by anyone and no one could be trusted was gone. Sometimes it was hard to realize and keep in mind that he was safe. Sometimes even a simple headache from studying too long gave him huge panic attacks; Harry couldn’t tell if it was the scar that ached or not.
-So?-Draco repeated, pulling his textbooks out of the bag,-Oh, right. Potions.
-Do you want something? I’ll get us drinks,-Harry asked after another long laughing session. Though it was the end of December and even magic couldn’t get rid of the cold, with all the dancing and laughing Harry’s hair got wet from the sweat, his bow-tie got loose and his jackets was now on one of the chairs – where he’ll definitely forget it. Draco too didn’t look that flawlessly anymore. His hair started curling up and it just amazed Harry.
-Because first of all, it’s not like there is much going on in your life. Or in mine,-Draco looked down for a second,-And second of all, I don’t believe you can just hand this position to me. Not when we both now you’re equally as good, if not better,-Harry offered Malfoy his hand,-So? Are you in?
-He didn’t kill Fred,-Harry said.
-Don’t you understand? I’m not actually free and probably will never be. I’ll always be one fight away from an Azkaban cell,-Draco got up too,-One conflict, one complain about me, and all your efforts will be a waste! That’s why I can’t fight back! That’s why I let Harris and his idiots do whatever they want to me! That’s why I want to leave this damn place more than anything!-by the time Draco finished, he already regretting saying so much. And Harry was starring at him in shock. He never even thought of it all this way.
-You can approach Professor Hooch. She will form your team,-Harry gave McGonagall a warm, thanking smile, but she acted as if nothing happened,-If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me,-everyone was so excited to see the new common room that even if they did have questions, they weren’t as important.
-Can I?
-Nothing!-Draco looked around to make sure no one had heard the nonsense out of Potter’s lips,-I already told you!
-I thought I heard you,-she said and wrapped her small arms around his neck. Draco hugged her back and smiled,-You promised to come sooner.
-You guys okay?-Ron asked. All three were looking at Malfoy, who nodded at the question.
-He already told you everything, didn’t he?-Hermione nodded,-And? What do you think?
-Some do,-he answered and Harry could tell it wasn’t a pleasant topic for him.
Apparently, Hogsmeade is even more beautiful in early morning. Calmness and indifference of empty bars and stores attracted, the birds singing for no one but them created intimate but not awkward atmosphere. Harry breathed in cold morning air and smiled. The view and this feeling were worth being a little sleep-deprived.
year he assumed. But neither her name, nor her last name appeared in his head.
Harry couldn’t think of anything better than waking up earlier and going up to Ravenclaw’s common room. Trying to be as quiet as possible and not wake up his sleeping dormmates, Harry walked out of his common room and headed to Ravenclaw’s. He wasn’t worrying about sounding insane to Luna. Of all people, she’d understand.
-Maybe it’s just your hair,-Draco opened his eyes in shock and Harry chuckled.
The court room was so huge that the light from open windows hardly was enough, even during mornings. It was almost deadly hot, but as the room started filling with people, and each and every single one of them starred at Draco, he started feeling goosebumps and uncomfortable cold on his skin. It seemed like half a Ministry was there, all abandoned their jobs just to decide whether or not Draco Malfoy deserves to have a future. Draco knew that his chances were basically equal to zero. Yet, he hoped. For a miracle, since it was the only thing that could help him.
-No, they are not.
For some unknown to him reason Harry expected to see Draco crying. He assumed it was a bad news type of letter, maybe even from Azkaban. But his eyes were neither red nor teary. Malfoy looked…lost. Disoriented
-Even us? Really?
Now, an hour before the Ball was supposed to start, Harry looked back at the moment with a smile. He was standing in front of the mirror in the common room, while Hermione was trying to get a hold of his hair. Ron was half-asleep on the couch, already dressed and ready.
-Did you go to Ms. Pomfrey’s at least? She should be able to heal bruises,-Harry said, sitting on one of the beds.
-How are you doing?-she asked. And Harry realized that they hadn’t even talked properly since the beginning of the year. He definitely had been avoiding her,-I heard you didn’t make it to a Quidditch team.
-Draco! Harry!-they heard a voice behind them. Both boys turned around and saw Luna Lovegood running towards them. She stopped to catch a breath and smiled,-Look at you! You both look great!
-Where’s your date?-Hermione asked Harry as they walked out of the common room and headed towards the Great Hall. Dozens of teenagers in robes and shiny dresses passed them.
-Yes,-Draco blushed as McGonagall opened the binder and happily gasped. He knew his grades were good. Even better than good.
-Hey,-Harry replied but felt a strong urge to leave. These two had a lot to discuss – which they started already – and Harry didn’t want to disturb. He stayed though. And even during their conversation with Draco, Pansy kept throwing glances at Harry. Ones he couldn’t really understand.
-He noticed you left right away,-she said,-I lied, he didn’t believe it.
-So these are children’s rooms,-Draco said, closing the door after himself and pointing at a few others,-There are 10 of them, 6 children in each room. That’s the kitchen and the canteen,-he pointed at the room Madam  Polkinghorne disappeared in,-And that’s the play room,-he nodded at the only door left. The orphanage was painfully small, obviously lacked the founding, but it was clean, and it seemed like the owner really loved these children.
-You have somewhere to go. Even if the Manor is gone,-Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, searching for an answer there, but Potter just kept his sly smile and waited for Malfoy to get it himself.
Speaking of Ron! He did come up with the most amazing, romantic and loving way to invite Hermione to the Ball. He worked on it for so long and found something flawless. If he used it back in 4
-My mom,-Ron replied without a sight of a smile,-She says hi.
The boys didn’t have any time to admire the beauty of the beginning of winter and with a clap, apparated to another side of London. Draco was visibly nervous being this late, but when they heard a loud, desperate cry coming from the orphanage, Harry shared his concern.

-Thank you. You know, I heard today was a special day,-she said. Draco smiled and nodded. Of course it was,-It’s a day of true love!
-Uhm, okay,-the girl clearly hoped for some privacy and threw an unsatisfied glance at Draco,-I was wondering if you…wanted to go to the Ball with me?
-Yeah, he wouldn’t,-Harry said, unconvinced. Where could Malfoy even be now, 40 minutes before the ball? - It just came to me…,-Harry started, hoping to be cut off because the end of that thought was rather terrifying.
-No. But you were supposed to get closer to that. And you did, I saw the brochure,-Draco’s heart skipped a beat, but he played it cool.
-My mother,-Draco answered. Harry took a seat on the chair opposite to Draco.
-What is that supposed to mean?
-But can you? You are rather impatient, young lady,-Draco tried to make a joke, but it didn’t work.
-A couple times when I was younger,-Draco was rather excited to go in, see what had changed since the last time he had been there. It’s been more than 10 years, back then Blacks and Malfoys were one big, dysfunctional family.
-What happened to your face?-Harry asked, resisting a strong urge to touch his cheek. Especially, the dark purplish-green spot right under his eye.
Hope you're enjoying, please tell me if you are.
-Why?-he started going through his memories of the second year and scoffed when he realized the reason 12 year old Potter had,-You thought I opened the Chamber of secrets,-Draco made a step away from Harry.
-I…I’ll wait here,-Harry asked and internally begged Ron to just leave already.
-You’ll come back, right? You won’t stay there? Even if Beauxbatons is better?
It took them a lot of time and ambition to find a free compartment, but once Harry, Ron and Hermione had settled for one, the usual 1st of September talk started. Ron and Hermione were now officially together, which was great, but Harry couldn’t help but think that the time when the three of them did everything together and had their legendary adventures was behind them and a constant role of the third wheel was now expecting for Potter. Not that he wanted to do anything legendary this year. Not at all. Harry hoped for a calm year, for tons of homework that will distract him from memories and flashbacks. He hoped for a good opportunity to move on and start over. He hoped to discover himself all over again and find out what he truly wanted from life, now that his life had finally started. He really hoped for a very boring 8th year. Boring, according to Hogwarts’s standards.
-Where’s that Gryffindor courage, Potter?-Draco asked as if he had read Harry’s mind. Neither of them rushed to get in, but neither of them wanted to make the other think as if they changed their mind.
-Do you want me to be honest?
-He’s going with me,-Draco said confidently to Hazel,-We agreed not to tell anyone now, but you deserve to know the truth. Right?-Draco looked at Harry.
-Your mother is here to take you! The portal closes in 15 minutes! Come quick!
All Draco’s attempts to save himself were small and pathetic. He tried to make them understand why he did what he did, told them all about the threats and dangers that Voldemort promised, told them about tortures and everything that went down in Malfoy Manor over that summer. He really tried to make one himself heard, to make one thought realized by everyone present. He didn’t have a choice. Not really, not ever. But faces of people who were about to decide Draco’s entire life remained indifferent, with a splash of disgust.
They moved farther into the hall and through the party had already started, neither of them knew what they were supposed to do now. The music was too loud, the only table with alcohol (for 7
-Wait! Malfoy!-Harry followed him. Thankfully the common room was empty too,-Draco!
-He’s just too proud. I’ll be right back,-Harry got up and headed to Draco, not noticing how Ron and Hermione shared a glance, full of something Harry wouldn’t understand anyway.
-This is not friendship. I owe you,-Draco said.
-Still, it is important,-Hermione said and started listing all the reasons why without Hogwarts diploma their lives would fall apart and in what ways. Harry wasn’t really listening, instead he studied his window view. Ron just liked hearing his girlfriend talk about something she was passionate about.
-We can’t just give up on it. It’s our home!
-Ginny.
-What?-Draco looked shocked enough for Harry to start doubting his theory, but not enough for him to drop it.
year. Draco had to lie that he already had a date and we went together,-Harry remembered the day he and Draco decided to go together. That explained Malfoy’s quick lie.
-Just shut up,-he said,-You don’t mean it.
-I just wonder where he goes. His mother is in France, his house is…basically ruined,-Harry said.
-If that only meant anything,-Hermione said but Harry was already on his way to the dorm and didn’t hear her.
-Nothing,-Harry said and raised another glass, though he didn’t want one anymore.
-I’m not. You are much more needed here,-Kreacher looked around. Merlin, there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do to go back home.
-Then what were you doing yesterday? And almost every weekend before that?-Draco hesitated to answer. Harry nodded and turned to his book. He still felt angry from being lied to, but now he was much sadder.
-It’s not exactly a secret,-Harry started, trying to speed up,-I mean, it’s not only my secret. That’s why I couldn’t tell anyone.
-That’s not…,-Harry groaned,-They wouldn’t beat you up, if you told them!
Two figures flew up with impressive speed. Old school broomsticks were annoying, but Harry quickly made his peace with it. He saw Draco on the opposite side of the field. Their eyes were hectically searching for a small golden dot in the sky, but it moved too fast. Harry heard someone screaming his name from the tribunes, but it only distracted him. He almost met eyes with Draco when Malfoy suddenly flew to his right. He was like a bullet, eyes concentrated on his goal. Harry immediately followed him. His instincts took over, instincts of a pretty damn good seeker. He saw a snitch. Draco was closer, but nothing was over yet. Harry could already feel a small sphere in his hand, his heart was beating out of his chest. And when Potter finally overtook Draco, snitch made a sharp turn to the left. And Draco was the first one to react.
-I don’t think he goes there. And Harry, whatever you do, just don’t follow him, okay? Try asking him first.
Headmistress McGonagall volunteered to host the sessions for most of the 8th graders, especially those she taught herself during their last years in Hogwarts. Every student had been given their own time to approach her office, each session was supposed to take less than half an hour and students were advised to at least try to prepare some ideas and plans for their future, just something to start with. Harry had no idea what he was going to talk about.
And of course, Ron and Harry were already expected in the Auror Academy. Weasley was very excited to spend another three years shoulder to shoulder with Harry, graduate to fight for peace, stop the evil and do the right thing. It was what they’d wanted for 4 years now. What they talked and daydreamed about. Except…
-You think so? Death Eater?-Malfoy rolled his eyes.
-It’s so different from ours. From all other common rooms,-Harry said using the opportunity to talk to Draco. Malfoy nodded, now looking very nostalgic and glad.
-Yes, but do you want it? With me?
-See? Manners pay off sometimes,-Harry rolled his eyes and headed to the kitchen. With all the work that had to get done in the orphanage that day, both of them completely forgot about eating. Harry hadn’t eaten anything since yesterday’s dinner and his stomach started reminding him about it.
-What do you mean?-Harry asked.
-Nothing,-Harry mumbled. Ron and Hermione were sitting right before them, the whole class was silent, but one question was boiling inside of Harry, threatening to come out any time.
-I’m not an idiot,-she said,-What if they just end the game now?-Terry Boot, the chaser of the 8th year was so annoyingly close to scoring, but still failed that Ron’s groan was heard on the entire pitch,-And what the hell is Malfoy doing?
-What’s that?-Draco asked as Harry slammed the fridge door shut.
-That’s sweet. You actually think any kind of rules still apply to you!
-But don't forget, because...,-he couldn't finish his sentence. Malfoy lowered his face and carefully touched Harry's lips with his. His fingers ran through Potter's brown hair. Oh if his father could only see him now. Harry replied to the kiss and took Draco's other hand into his.
-I’ve had pleasure to work with many great Slytherins during my life. Great in completely different ways. But what they all had in common, is that none of them could ever be stopped by a closed door or a simple no. I don’t believe that you can be too, Mister Malfoy.
When the match was a couple days away, Ron almost lost sleep. Having gone through the war, you’d think it would take more than a school sports game to scare him. But it was a pleasant kind of fear. It felt so weirdly normal to be afraid of losing a Quidditch cup again, not starving to death in the middle of nowhere.
Eventually, some lady approached Draco, gave him his wand and asked if he needed help. Draco said no and finally got to his feet. He walked out of the court room with a weird feeling that his body wasn’t even his, and the reality he was in right now, wasn’t the real one. He saw Harry talking to Kingsley, and before he could tell himself not to, he hid around the corner where he could hear every word they said.
-When are you planning to tell Ron about Malfoy?-Harry sighed,-You know that technically you are making me lie to him too?
-What would you do in it? What would you dedicate your life to?-McGonagall asked,-It doesn’t have to be a profession. Could be a hobby, or even some abstract concept,-an answer appeared in his head almost right away. Draco just desperately didn’t want to say it out loud.
-Just stop lying to him. He already forgave you, just don’t let it happen again,-Hermione said. And Harry wished he could say that there were no lies between them anymore, that their fight could be forgotten and they could trust each other again. But…,-What?
-So…how was your weekend?-he asked.
-Promise,-Draco promised gladly because the feeling of someone waiting for you was one of the most amazing things he had ever felt. The whole night was full of the most amazing things he had ever felt. He really wished he could stay, but there were minutes left and he didn’t have a choice,-Goodbye, Potter. It’s been nice.
Malfoy neglected their usual spot. He sat a little closer to the teacher, next to an ex-Hufflepuff student, probably assuming she’d be too nice to kick him out or start asking questions. Harry spent the whole lesson sitting all alone and starring into Draco’s back, not honoring the new DADA Professor with even a small share of his attention. In his head, he scrolled through the list of potential suspects who could have wanted to hurt Malfoy and it was painfully long. Michael Harris and his friends weren’t the only ones wishing ill to Draco. Half of the school had lost either a friend or a family member during the war, and though all of them knew perfectly well that he was acquitted of all charges, it didn’t mean anything to them. Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater.
-Of course it’s true,-Ron groaned but quickly calmed down once he saw Draco walking by,-I can’t even handle this stupid ferret!-he whispered once Draco was far enough. Harry smiled.
-In your dreams, Potter,-they cheered, and this time even Draco couldn’t hold back a smile. Harry started laughing and Draco almost did too, but he accidentally looked into the window and froze.
-I…I wanted to walk you to the Great Hall,-he said, blushing from his lies.
-Harry! Of course, Harry! What a kind soul! What a kind soul!-Madam Polkinghorne exclaimed again and again,-The children will wake up any minute now. I need to make sure the breakfast is ready,-she looked at the clock. Harry could tell the woman had a billion worries and responsibilities here,-Draco will show you around, right?-Malfoy nodded. Analise smiled to them, tears in her eyes and ran to the kitchen.
-Just try it!-Harry exclaimed,-I’m not trying to poison you, I’ve had every chance to kill you today.
-It’s okay,-Draco hugged her and closed his eyes,-See you next Saturday, right?
-Ms. Lovegood, the game, please!-Slughorn did his best to help her focus,-Malfoy and Williams are both chasing the snitch.
-He will notice. And he will kill you,-Hermione answered in a calm voice, not asking Harry where and why he was going.
-I’m sorry.
-But…my stuff…,-Draco mumbled, not caring about his stuff at all.
They reached Hogsmeade almost without talking. A couple times Draco asked if Harry actually wanted to do it, warned him that not all kids are welcoming and that he really didn’t have to go with him. Harry listened and nodded at Draco, not even doubting his decision to go. Yes, he was nervous. Very nervous. But there was a number of reasons why Harry wanted to visit that orphanage and they outweighed his nerves and fear.
-Shut up,-Harry smiled,-Write to your mother now. Tell her you’ll stay and you’ll figure everything out.
-Are you aware how that trail went down, Professor?-Draco asked. Potter’s presence was a secret, but something told him that Headmistress knew how to keep one,-Harry Potter testified for me. He convinced the minister to let me go. I haven’t been proven innocent, Potter bailed me out,-he sighed, as if admitting his weakness. Draco still wasn’t sure what he felt about Harry’s actions in court. He was obviously very relieved and grateful, he valued his freedom a lot. But at the same time, Draco now owed that said freedom to someone else, owed his whole life basically, because in his case, going to Azkaban equaled to death. And his pride absolutely hated the fact that Harry Potter had saved his life, without ever asking for anything in return.
-Interesting. Yours?
So here's the new part, really hope you like it because i've been brainstorming it for months. probably.
-Would you want it?
-What are you doing here?-Draco looked as if he couldn’t believe his eyes.
-This is stupid, Ron,-he mumbled. Draco was listening to everything and Harry really wanted this conversation to stop,-Honestly, why does it even matter?
-They’re all stupid.
-This is none of your business, hero,-he said with a smirk,-I’m doing your work, actually.
-Yes, but…I want to,-Ron said, blushing so hard that his freckles disappeared,-I want it to be sweet and romantic and all.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Draco!-Harry called for his attention.
-We never talked about the ball. I mean, except for that one time,-saying it out loud made Harry realize that maybe they should have talked. Or Harry should have just mentioned it once, just to make sure. But it was an awkward thing to talk about and with all the classes Harry never found time…
-Draco,- Madam Polkinghorne was standing at the doors to the children’s room while Draco and Harry were reading a bedtime story for Lucy,-It’s late,-she whispered. And it was, 10.30 pm, at least, and they still had homework due tomorrow morning. Draco looked at Lucy, who’s eyes started filling up with tears already,-Lucy, you can see our guests out if you promise not to cry afterwards,-Analise said, fully aware that she will cry anyway. But Lucy nodded and jumped off the bed. Holding her little hand, Draco walked down the hall towards the exit, Harry went right behind them.
-No, Luna.
-Mr. Potter,-Kingsley called, with an intention to finally end everything,-I want to ask you something. Do you truly, genuinely think that Draco Malfoy is innocent? That he had been pulled into the war involuntarily? That his and Voldemort’s views and intentions didn’t match?
-Why? Why do you care?
-Now that’s the Draco I know and love!-Pansy said when Astoria was far enough,-Did you get it?
-I’m not asking anything,-he repeated,-But Ron always says how lonely you are and he hates it. I do too,-he blushed, but didn’t allow himself to stop now,-Lucy needs a home and when I was thinking of who could accept someone else’s child, give them home and love them as her own, I could only think of you,-Harry saw tears on Molly’s eyes. He was on verge of crying too,-I am…I am so grateful for everything you gave me. And I’ll never be able to pay you back, but…,-a few tears fell down Harry’s eyes and Molly rushed to hug him.
-Good morning, Madam,-Harry said, trying to force a smile. Such reactions never flattered him. And Draco smirking behind the back of the woman didn’t help too.
-Everything,-knot in his stomach ached. He wanted to see Harry's face as he told him those words, but couldn't force himself to look up. His pale cheeks slowly turned light pink and then red,-Everything we could have been,-he whispered. Harry looked at him, trying to understand what Draco meant. His face didn't express anything but embarrassment and regret. Harry couldn't find the right words. Not now, not ever before.
-We’ll wait for someone,-Pansy said.
-Not them, you idiot,-Harry said. Draco still didn’t get it. Or pretended not to,-You saw that my house is too big for me alone…
-Oh really? Maybe if you had done any work during the war, we’d win faster,-Harry approached Draco and grabbed his hand. No one dared to keep holding him back,-Say hello to McGonagall for me, you all will see her very soon,-without looking at anyone in the room, even Draco, he rushed out of the room, still hand in hand with him. Malfoy was still too shocked to react, but once they reached dormitories, he woke up and pushed Harry away.
-Orphanage?-Harry asked. Draco nodded quickly, still not meeting eyes with him,-That’s where you’ve been going every weekend?-another nod. Harry didn’t know how to react, but he had a thousand questions in his head.
Once they returned to the Great Hall, Harry left them alone. He stopped following Draco and instead went straight towards alcohol-table. Drinks turned into water if a minor touched them and Harry was damn glad he wasn’t one. He poured himself a drink and dried the glass in one try that burned his throat. And then another. He looked up at Draco still talking to Pansy and not even noticing that he was gone and poured another. Harry felt so much, but all his feelings were so utterly negative that they just blended into one desire to distract himself, to stop thinking. And even among the wizards, getting drunk was a way to do it.
-It’s absolutely okay. You know, when I heard that you all were offered an opportunity to come back to Hogwarts and graduate, I particularly hoped that you would take this offer, Harry.
-What? Is it time already?-he asked, jumping off the couch.
-I wanted to ask you,-Hermione said to Harry. They were watching their Quidditch team training for the next match. Ron gave them a week of vacation, but now made them work harder than ever before.
Anyway, hope you enjoyed, I won't promise to post soon, but I'll definitely try to and thank you so much for reading! Also thank you for your kind words under previous chapters! Nothing motivates me to write more than your comments.
-I wouldn’t be so sure. He was a Death Eater, he almost killed…Dumbledore,-even after more than a year, it was hard to talk about that loss. It will always be.
-What?-it was probably his first name that made Malfoy stop and turn around.
-Luna, yesterday I saw you coming back to the castle with D…Malfoy. Were you together?-he asked. His question didn’t surprise Luna at all.
-No, of course I should have told you…And I will tell Ron, just…let me do it myself, okay?
(See the end of the chapter for
The dinner ended quickly and Harry volunteered to help Molly around the kitchen. He hoped to get a moment alone with her and she seemed to have understood his intention as she immediately sent away all other help and started washing dishes in a muggle way, handing clean plates to Harry to dry.
-Mr. Malfoy, I am afraid there is no choice here,-the knight from the painting reminded him.
-Just…just wait here,-she sighed and walked in the girls’ dorm.
-On the next game,-Harry said when Luna finished. He already started stumbling on words and forgetting what he was saying, but this topic seemed to have been so important to him, that his voice was firm again,-We have to make sure everyone uses the same brooms.
-Yeah…but not after the classes,-another wave of anxiety covered Harry,-You don’t think he could…?
-Hey, Harry,-Hermione carefully called him out,-Are you okay?
-Oh, God,-Draco entered the Great Hall, hiding his face. His hair, now longer than ever, was combed in a way to cover the left part of his face, Draco was looking down and didn’t notice Harry who basically ran into him.
Harry stopped to catch a breath before entering the common room when he heard voices coming out from the closed door. There were two people talking, one of them was Malfoy, the other was some woman Harry couldn’t yet recognize.
-Yes!-he looked at Draco's face,-I would.
Harry, who had to stay and be the victim of Ron’s entire verbal diarrhea, only half-listened to him. He was looking around every five seconds, starring into the entrance of The Great Hall. From time to time he smiled and nodded to Ron, but his attention was actually occupied by something else. Someone else, actually.
Heeey!
-Why do you even care so much?-Draco asked,-Voldemort is dead, I’m not doing anything illegal
-What?
-Thank you, guys,-Harry decided to keep his thoughts to himself and smiled to his friends. They smiled back to him and everything seemed settled. Except…,-There’s something else I need to say though.
-We really could see each other again,-Harry said. Carefully, but confidentially.
-Not everyone! Someone has to be too cool for lame school dances,-she said,-Come on…HA!-the door opened and a girl walked out,-Oh my god, that’s Astoria! We’re so lucky!-she looked at Draco who started shaking his head.
-I mean...no one would hire me anyway,-he said, for now only opening up about the least of his concerns.
-You see, even Malfoy understands how important it is to…,-Hermione started, but Ron shook his head cutting her off.
-You don’t need to pay me back, Harry,-she said, tears in her voice,-I love you like a son. You are my son,-she said, now cupping Harry’s face. She looked so serious, but so amazingly loving, Harry couldn’t understand how that much love could fit in one person. How can a person be so damn strong, go through so much pain and walk out of it gracefully, still capable of smiling, loving and being happy,-I need to talk to Arthur first. But…next time you visit her, let me know,-she said and the ray of hope Harry had turned into a whole sun.
-Well, yes, “straight” is not a word to use here,-Ron laughed at his own joke and even Hermione couldn’t hold in a chuckle. While Harry was bright red from anger now,-Mate, it’s fine, really. It happens,-Ron shrugged.
-Don’t touch it!-Harry was too late, the cloth went on the floor and the portrait of Walburga Black, Sirius’s mother, was revealed. Harry groaned as she opened her eyes and looked around with the same arrogance in her eyes as usual,-That’s Sirius’s mom, Walburga Black.
-Don’t worry about him. Even if he dares to try, you will defeat him. You’ve done it before,-Harry’s eyes automatically moved to the edge of the table. Draco was sitting all alone, piercing his food with a fork, looking down. Even exceptionally hot September couldn’t force Malfoy into losing the long sleeves and Harry knew why. He sighed and looked back at Ron and Hermione, who were already having their own conversation. Ron made her laugh and Hermione gently touched his hand, smiling and shining with happiness. Harry was happy for them. Of course he was.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Oh, here’s the brush,-Ron handed it to Harry. Hermione looked at him with disbelief and probably some doubts regrading the reason why she started dating him,-What?
Harry couldn’t tell if his face was sad or just peaceful. Still, he had an impossible urge to go up to him. Turns out he wasn’t the only one. Michael Harris and his little company slowly walked towards Draco, whispering something to one another. Once Harry saw those sly smirks and evil stares, he flew into the pub, pushing his way through the crowd full of bored teenagers and overtook the Ravenclaws. Potter basically fell into the seat opposite to Draco’s in the least graceful way possible, making Draco jump.
Harry looked at Ron. Not hiding it, not even trying to make it subtle. Watched him laugh and smile, and frustrations grew inside of him. It was like a tradition of its kind, every year something just HAD TO happen to drive the trio apart. Any little thing could grow into a huge drama that would last for weeks. Weeks of complete avoidance, of angry glances, of heartache.
-It’s not. Look!-Hermione nodded at Harry. Ron wasn’t sure what exactly he was expected to do,-His hair!
-A muggle drink. Come on, just try it,-Draco still looked skeptical, but when Harry took a bite of his food and a sip of his drink and didn’t drop dead, he had a bit of hope,-So, tell me about the time you were here before,-Harry asked, hoping to distract Draco with a conversation.
-In 5 years she’ll go to Hogwarts and…
-You know, if he doesn’t show up, we can still have fun together,-Ron said.
-Ministry couldn’t care less about me! Or any of us! They wanted me out of their hair, locking me up in this school was just another way!
-Piss off, Potter, I’m coming!-Malfoy opened the door, almost hitting Harry with it. In Potter’s humble opinion, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way Draco looked, but Malfoy didn’t agree,-This uniform looks ridiculous,-he complained and, to be honest, had his reasons.
-That’s…not very like him,-Harry knew it was just Hermione’s way to say “You are insanely wrong”, but still, something made him think he wasn’t. The way Draco constantly looked at Ron, the way he stopped himself from flying after the snitch, and misdirected Dora Williams, Hufflepuff’s seeker, instead.
This one feels kinda random, but I'm doing my best to express all my favorite headcanons and thoughts about post-war Harry, who is - in my opinion - very lost, very confused and just has no idea what he is doing.
-Harry, sit down!-Hermione pulled him down by his robes,-It’s too late now!
All Draco’s advantage disappeared; Dora reached him surprisingly quickly. Now they flew shoulder to shoulder. Williams had her arm stretched out to grab the snitch as soon as she gets a chance to. Draco tried to overtake her, but his broom really was a lot older and slower.
-Quit torturing yourself, child,-knight on the wall, right next to the door told Ron,-One ex-Gryffindor had already walked through this door, no other shall.
