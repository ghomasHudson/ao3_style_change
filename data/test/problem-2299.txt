Ron laughed and looked at Harry. "So You-Know-Who's new parents are you, Scabbers, and his actual dead father?"
Harry barely restrained himself from snarling. How dare Hermione -- no, Eugene -- wait, Malfoy.... Hell. He didn't even know what they were
"Oh, don't worry about it," he said casually. "Draco was around for my first experiments with Muggle alarm systems." He grinned at Draco. "After all, I couldn't let him get in trouble."
"'Yet here they were, dipping bread in the same skillet of sizzling garlic oil, heads close together, now giggling, now serious, keeping their words locked behind a powerful privacy charm -- possibly blood-linked. Have they been clandestinely in contact all these years? Or has sororal affection, long constrained by fear, been freed to bloom now that two violent Death Eaters are out of Narcissa's life?"
"They are still –" Draco stopped, his face scrunching up. "Sorry, but their relationship confuses me. She is not formally promised to him, correct?"
Harry wondered if he wanted to know. It might be better not to. "They confessed to Dumbledore later. They regretted it before I was born, apparently. Remus has actually used this to caution me against being too clever with my plots."
He gave his reasons, and she nodded slowly -- another thing he had missed, probably because of Pansy's arrival. He had forgotten that Mill hadn't taken the bottle until Pansy objected. Had the contrast to someone she didn't trust at all made him look more appealing as an ally?
Indignation proved to be the only excitement of the morning. Percy had sat, and Special Inquisitor Cabot stood, bowed to the people on either side of him, and then to the assembled members of the Wizengamot, and then sat again. He gestured to another clerk, who called the defendants, one at a time, out to the chairs. Once all were seated and chained, he read out the names of their accusers. Draco was not included in the latter category. Harry wondered if that was because he had not been of age at the time of the attack, or if it was some sort of tactical maneuver. Dumbledore was included, and stood in acknowledgement, but did not need to leave the box. After him came a member of the Board of Governors of Hogwarts, and then another, and then Professor Sprout, and then Mr. Yallapragada, who turned out to be another member of the Board of Governors. When he sat, Cabot stood again and made a long statement about justice being the solemn duty of the Wizengamot, and how no one should
Shaking her head, she turned away. "I'm not sure there's any point. If he hasn't learned by now that when he invites someone out, he should compliment them at least once, he's not going to, is he?"
He took the head of Draco's cock in his mouth, and Draco's words ended in a soft wail. Pleased, Harry ran his tongue around the edge of the soft-skinned tip, and felt a surge of satisfaction when Draco grabbed at his hair.
"I..." Harry felt a trembling start deep in his gut, and tried to keep the surface of his body still. He could remember the details all too well: how tightly he was bound, the flat headstone unyielding against his back.
"Thank you, Harry," he said placidly. "I will bring her to a Muggle hospital, and we will mount a proper guard. We have your uncle and cousin already."
"I have too many important secrets. If it was just sneaking off with Draco for fun, that wouldn't be worth this, but there's the divination, and if she caught me with some of the dodgier potion ingredients...."
They worked in silence. Thornton was better at this than Draco had expected. After each garment was finished, Draco levitated it carefully to the floor. The house elf he summoned attached everything in seconds. Well satisfied, Draco rose to his feet.
"And if I was, what of it?" Harry returned. "That would just be ventures into sex. I have the impression you started that earlier than I did."
? Could he press enough to get that? Didn't Draco know he would be tempted? "She wouldn't really kill you."
Snape and Harry shared a look as Draco cast ash-repelling charms on Harry and himself. Snape's face was impassive, but Harry suspected that he used the same dress robes for everything that required them.
"I think so," Draco said. Delicately, he cleared his throat.  "Were you considering, hm, making your own?"
Hermione rubbed her forehead. "Ron?" she asked.  People were starting to emerge from the Great Hall now.
"And that's certainly mutual," Draco declared. "But we probably wouldn't have started here and now."
selected a wand for me, a hawthorn one, with a unicorn hair core. I thought unicorns were rather too girly, and something else would certainly suit me better. She was right about that part, though, and Flitwick was right that I needed to choose. I ended up with a hazel wand, still with a unicorn tail hair core, but a bit more whippy and half an inch longer than the one she chose -- and it felt much better, in use."
Harry froze. The heat drained from his anger, leaving it hard. "Then you won't have it," he said. He gave the statement a moment to hit home. When dismay began to spread across her face, he turned and strode away.
Just as they opened the door to one of the carriages, Millicent Bulstrode stepped up to intercept them. "Room for one more?"  she asked companionably.
His response was everything Harry had hoped for, and after he climaxed, Draco wasted no time in rolling Harry over to return the favor. At this rate, Harry thought, he might start liking mornings.
She wrinkled her nose, but it seemed to be over the correspondence, rather than the House Elf who appeared and snapped scones onto their plates, and a mix of fruits into the crystal dishes beside them.
"Hm?" Harry felt like he'd passed out. He was still standing, but Severus was shivering, and the wet mess in his jeans was spreading through the rough weave. "God, yeah. I came in my pants. Bath? He should be someplace warm."
Sitting up, he told himself not to panic. Yes, he was wandless and trapped, but Tonks had promised someone trusted by Dumbledore would stay near all night. Of course, Snape had said that Hogwarts was the safest place to be if there were Death Eaters after you, which implied a MLE holding area was less safe. What if Voldemort knew and mounted a raid? But Dumbledore must know that was a risk, and he had approved this maneuver. He wouldn't allow Harry to be harmed, right?
"I don't know what you'll do!" He stopped, struck by the truth of that. "I don't," he repeated more plaintively.  "I ... I've lost it, somehow. Or I can't quite calculate how you've changed. Being out of touch all summer maybe." He turned away, unable to quell the bitter thought that
He gave her a devilish smile worthy of his predecessor.  "Of course. The Hermione in my world does." Smirking, he dropped down onto the comfortable chair and lounged there, one leg tossed carelessly over an arm of it. "In return for my public favor."
against him?" Susan objected. "Then the curses may not hurt him at all. If his father wanted to keep the Ministry from any gain for a confiscation, but considered it unlikely, he might have incorporated a blood exemption, rather than having to lift the curses to use the device himself."
Snape steepled his hands, staring down at them. The first two fingers on his left hand were stained a bluish purple that contrasted with yellow on the tips of the right. Harry wondered what he had been brewing.
Harry couldn't keep from thinking of the way Snape sometimes seemed to like him -- a cool, almost mocking approval, with just a touch of connection. Draco, also, had his father's shifts to remember. Harry wondered suddenly if Draco was afraid of losing him that way.
Surprised, he looked back, and when their eyes met, she giggled. Despite himself, he smiled. It was ridiculous, really.
Delicately, Narcissa hesitated. "I cannot claim to trust either," she answered finally. "Severus Snape, I find, has deceived us for years about his loyalties, so I can hardly expect honesty from him. However, I know that Lucius took Draco to that meeting to be Marked for service to the Dark Lord, and that he had planned for that event with pride, so his testimony starts with a lie. No, in all of this, the one I believe is Draco, my son." Her eyes sought out her son in the crowd and she gazed at him lovingly. Then, to Harry's surprise, her attention moved to him, her look growing more speculative. "And, though I would never have thought to say it, Mr. Potter, who seems a more thoughtful young man than certain people would have us believe."
The small object turned out to be an oilcloth pouch. Malfoy squeezed something out of it and rubbed it along Harry's crack. Whatever it was, it was slick and warm, and Malfoy stroked it forward and back with her fingers before teasing the tip of one into Harry's hole.
That wasn't what Harry was expecting. Prepared to fight soothing words, he instead stayed silent, letting Draco continue.
"Couldn't you marry a girl?" The look she sent him was so withering that he had to qualify. "As a man, I mean."
For answer, Harry grabbed his wand from the shelf by the bath and Summoned Padma's toiletries. "Here."
Draco frowned. He straightened, standing as if he were presenting something in a lesson. "C-H-A-R-M," he said, and then his mouth opened again. His lips twitched and twisted, and he grabbed on to Harry's arm. "NO!" he shouted, then shuddered, and then relaxed. "I think...." He paused, waiting, his breath coming hard. "I think that did it."
Curious, Harry reached for the article, but Draco held his hand back. "Wait. One more thing. Top right-hand drawer, now -- the password is 'mastery', but you have to say it."
"You are not supposed to be here, Potter," came a harsh voice. Nott. Harry pretended to be unconcerned.
They were trying to be quiet, so as not to give warning. Harry was bent over, both hands clutching a wall sconce above, forehead leaned into his elbows, and both slick with sweat. Draco, behind him, was holding his cock tight to get the head in. At the clack of the door and Snape's gasp, Harry twisted his head to look. The man was twisted away, yanking furiously at the persistently open door.
The Slytherin at the next table reached a hand across the surface and rapped on it. "Excuse me," he said coolly, "but are you saying that you believe Sirius Black is innocent because he
Perhaps he should go down to Slytherin after dinner and see what happened. He had planned to wait until further into the term, but now that plan reminded him unpleasantly of Dumbledore's delay on his promises. Tonight, he decided. He didn't need the Slytherins settled. He didn't
He walked down to Slytherin openly, no cloak, no subterfuge -- not that there was anyone to see, for most of the way. In the last stretch, he heard light footsteps racing behind him, and turned to see two small children whip around the corner. He recognized one as the first-year girl that the Hat had taken so long to sort. They clattered to a stop beside him.
On Wednesday morning, Harry woke up feeling tired and discouraged, and might have skipped breakfast if Ron hadn't thrown a pillow at him and told him to get up. Hermione caught up with them just outside the portrait hole.
Mrs. Malfoy's script, while not as extravagantly looped as that on the invitation, had apparently been too fine to read over his shoulder. Harry quickly folded the letter and stuffed it in his bag.
Hermione laughed and took a bead, copying Sophia's intensified Ravenclaw color scheme of cobalt blue with a swirl of bronze. The other Ravenclaws followed, along with Gilbert, Parvati, and -- after a moment's hesitation -- Blaise.
She went crashing into the table and down, while her wand flew above it and bounced off the barrier that defined her room. She had a split second to think that he was even more powerful than
-- that if he reached down, and trailed his fingers up Draco's neck and through his hair, until he was tugging gently at the locks of the crown, that Draco would whine with lust, and he wanted to hear that sound.
"So I need something to wear," Harry went on. "Something a bit more wizardly -- and a lot nicer -- than most of my clothes."
"Oh, very well." Behind the man's back, Draco sent him a sharp look, but Harry just smiled. Accepting a promise was trust, after all, and he did not need to turn Severus this moon.
"Not quite. I had him add Draco, as well. Mr. Nott, he had thought of on his own. Altogether, there are perhaps a half-dozen students."
"I love the way your skin moves when I do that." Draco dipped two fingers in and swirled them around the head. "Of course, you might like this more if you'd remembered a warming charm."
"Too late now," Harry said, and pushed into a kiss. They kissed fiercely until a voice outside the door began to count.
Draco's body twitched against him as he held back a laugh. "Got it. I can take a little more, I think. I mean, it doesn't
Everyone was watching as Blaise hurried over. Behind him, Draco got to his feet, but Blaise stopped more than an arm's length away.
"Mm." Draco kissed lower, first next to Harry's cock, and then on it. "No," he said lightly. "I want to be right here."
"I've never understood what Slytherins consider insults." Harry sat up as people started reaching for beads. "No, wait! That wasn't my turn. I was just
"Oh! My Harry." He reclined next to Harry and pushed him gently back to the mattress. "Lie down. I want to undress you."
They said the same things, some nights, and sometimes new ones, but never much. After six years, there were still things left unsaid.
"You want what?" Hermione said dumbly. Blinking, she looked to the side. "Harry! It's two in the morning!"
"This is far longer than the effect was supposed to last," Draco muttered, turning towards Harry. "The sooner he's--" He stopped, his eyes widening as Ron's had done. With a shiver of dread, Harry turned.
"Oh, the ball! We always have little presents, here and there, for the younger guests to find. It keeps them happy through hours of dancing and music and other adult entertainments. I've been helping hide them since I got too old for them myself, and have helped create them for the last three years. It's lots of fun."
"Pansy Parkinson put something in your bag. I saw her do it while you were brushing Bowtruckle dust off your scales." With a soft nudge for the Quiri in her lap, she got to her feet, the straps of his bag held in both hands. "We should take it someplace safe and upend it with magic."
"So." Professor Hecksban leaned back his desk.  "Is this class work, or something more complicated? You're both doing well, if you're wondering."
"On the Wolfsbane potion, meaning within the scope of its use.  Attempting to alter your personality is not part of that."
Tilting his head, Draco gave him a coy smile. "Perhaps," he said.  "At least have sex where he can't help but see. And you should refuse to touch him."
power because your parents and their friends gave you their vengeance-rights before you were born, and the spell was something they created -- why can he teach it?"
Rolling his eyes, Harry turned away, shed his robes, and started unpacking his bag. Deliberately, he took the string of beads off the strap and hung it from a belt loop of his jeans.
"Zabini. He's been friendly since last spring."  Harry decided to push ahead. "You know, since the House Cup."
"If you loose by more than two votes," he amended.  That would require more than a split along house lines. Draco gave him an approving nod.
He immediately left off his pretense of reading, and followed her into her room, where she was once again facing away from him. When he touched her arm, she shook him off.
"Yeah. On that sort of hard road they have, but up against a wall, and everything covered with old grease."
“Exactly. But now that I know what the curse is, I should be able to lift it cleanly. I did some research this weekend, and found three counter-curses that may work.”
"Oh, you know how Voldemort is. He couldn't just curse me; he wanted drama. What good is a basilisk if you don't use it?"
"Would it be too much trouble to bring us some here," Harry asked, "or should we go to the Great Hall?"
The Calming Potion was strange. To Harry's relief, it was milder than others he had been given, but he still knew that that the world was less real than it should be.
"Hi, Granger," she said with a nod, and, beside her, Cornelia waved on to Caradog, who gave his name, house, and Quidditch position, and then stopped, blushing.
"Oh." Slowly, Harry absorbed that. He wondered if Snape was discounting Remus or didn't know he had been involved. "Well, that's okay. Simpler -- though I'd like to know who else knows."
"Well, it's what he says now." Harry stuck his tongue out at George. "Which gives us a few better things to do when we hide out together."
"Narcissa asked my advice on protections against her husband's associates -- indeed, I insisted on it if Draco was ever to visit again. I would have been remiss not to warn her that there was an animagus among the Death Eaters."
Harry didn't think he would have made any sense of that if Draco hadn't emphasized the last word with a tilt and press of his arse. Harry locked his mouth on the back of Draco's neck, both intensely turned on and struggling not to laugh.
"Really?" Harry stepped into the space left by the headmaster's retreat. "You have not dealt in good faith with me.  You've tricked me, and
Lavender rolled her eyes. "Well, they have to start somewhere, don't they? Muggles don't just think these things up! But if you
There were four doors off Nimue Close, two with hanging signs. Blaise immediately set to casting charms at one, and then to working at it with two devices from his pocket. When he got it open, Harry slipped in ahead of him and looked around. He was in the front of a large room, with carpet at the edges and a smell of long-stale beer. The furniture looked solid and hard to move. On the other side of the dance floor stood a bar, bottles of liquor arrayed behind it. From a shimmer in the air before it, Harry judged it to have stronger protections than the door. He cast a quick charm to detect living mammals, and it picked up nothing other than himself and Zabini, and a few little speckles of mice.
"You could now," Draco pointed out, which Harry couldn't argue with. He didn't like using things he didn't know the feel of, really. He snapped the tongs against his thigh.
"No sex!" Draco chided, but cheerily. "At least no buggery, until we get the book, although I gather I was exceptionally unlucky, or you were more ill than you let on."
“What sort of stealing?” Seamus asked. “Biscuits? Kisses? My brother’s broom for an afternoon? A little toy, but permanently?”
"Don't know why you're fretting," Ron said sulkily, when Harry finally dug the Marauder's Map out of his trunk. "She wants to be a bloke; she can take care of herself."
. I remember that from before I left for school -- but, of course, we used to play, when I was little."
"You could look a long time," he said. "Sphinxes are rare enough. Winged ones?" He spat on the floor. "Vicious besides."
Jonathan arrived next, set out his things, and began to sketch, as before. Susan slipped in soon after, but alone, making Harry wonder if Justin would come. As Draco was busy, he went and sat down next to her in the middle of the arc of chairs.
"I have a focus for you. Not the real thing, but ..." He encased the ersatz rat in a globular shield spell.  "Look."
She nodded sleepily. "All right. Though I'm not likely to get anywhere until Monday -- I know the MLE never sleeps, but Records in my division is open standard office hours."
Draco raised his chin haughtily, and Harry intervened. "I don't think the table is art. Show her, Draco."
He leaned in to kiss the side of Draco's mouth. Draco remained stubbornly still as Harry brushed his lips as far forward as he could reach. Slowly, Draco's mouth opened, but not to turn and kiss back.
Neville's eyebrows went up, and Draco's mouth curled in amusement, but they compliantly shook hands.
Harry shoved hard against him.  "Don't you want to come for me? Don't you want to come down his throat? Gotta watch him milk you with his tongue, like he does--"
Harry didn't know when he'd lost control, but he wasn't going to argue. He wasn't entirely sure he could speak. He lay back and let Draco unbutton his shirt and cuffs, and kiss at the skin underneath, resisting only long enough to push Draco's shirt off, so he could touch Draco's pale skin with whatever hand he had free.
Harry was halfway back to his office before realizing he had left Diagon Alley without buying a new hat for the Robing ceremony. He had spent the whole damn time wondering about Malfoy. He had seen him in Slug & Jiggers, looking off into the distance, and then he had seen that change -- the lost-to-scornful transition of the young man with Octavius. Still incredulous when Malfoy had focused on him, he had gone with his instincts and asked outright if he knew Octavius. It was an interrogation move that you could only use once, but often it bore fruit. Indeed, Malfoy's response was telling. He hadn't looked puzzled, or asked "Octavius who?" or said, "Good morning to you too, Potter." He had refused to answer, and he had acted as if the question itself was an accusation. He was so tense that Harry had checked his wand hand, only to find Malfoy's knuckles white from gripping his robes, instead.
Harry laughed. "Look, just ... after I go back to Hogwarts, I may need some things. Would you be willing to buy me potions ingredients and owl them to me?"
He was rescued from potentially impolitic speculations by the arrival of dinner. Two House Elves popped into the room, a table between them. As soon as its feet touched the ground, three place settings and a number of serving platters and bowls appeared on its surface. The elves vanished, returned with chairs, bowed to Professor Snape, and vanished again, all with bewildering speed.
"Hermione!" Draco exclaimed. "Do come in. And I recommend the tarts. The berries are a moment's taste of summer." As he was speaking, he made his way over to the couple, stopping with a half-second of awkward flutter in front of them. Harry suspected that he was fighting against offering Hermione his arm. He settled for nodding graciously at Ron. "Thank you for bringing her. I expect she needed the encouragement."
"Potter." The name puffed against his ear.  "Harry." Unexpected and softer. "I know how we can do it."
"Sort of." Harry sent Hermione a quick smile. "Snape's been teaching me wandless magic, you know. The lessons came in handy." He hesitated. "Though if I hadn't managed, Snape still would have been in time to save me. His curse went right over Mr. Parkinson while he was falling from mine."
, Draco confirmed, and Harry touched the wall. Draco was right here. The chute could be right here. Or, he realized, the chute could be to one side or the other of the cupboard, in the corner made by the cupboard and
Hermione knew she should be enraged, but her anger was trapped behind shock, like a shark under ice.
"Everything." Draco probed his ribs gingerly before pulling his hands back to his sides. "But mostly my ankle. Damn cobblestones."
"Dropped off for a minute and then woke up again," he said. He scraped his tongue against his teeth. "And there's this taste in my mouth like the fire backed up."
They were both silent as the echoes died away. Some dust drifted down from the space above, but nothing more fell. Harry cleared his throat. "Maybe we should, um, stabilize the fall first?"
He moved on to look at the second and third sheets.  Because exact schedules for his year were not set until the first day of school, it listed the supplies for all the lessons he might take, with a reminder that most would be available by owl order once at school. Of course, this also gave him a way to get a better sense of what the options might be like. He should go to Flourish & Blotts and look over the required and suggested texts.
Draco looked uncertain when he stopped at the end of the hallway. Harry had left him an assortment of clothing, expecting he would choose the robes. Instead, he was wearing too-short sweatpants and a blue oxford shirt with the tails untucked and the top button undone. His hair was clean from the shower, but ragged from lack of care. It fell in his face when he glanced down, and he had to shake it back a little when he caught himself and raised his chin again. Altogether, he looked stunning, and only half familiar.
guilty made everything worse. Gryffindor might forgive him if he carried on normally, but the lions would snap like hyenas if he skulked about trying to avoid them.
For a moment, Snape just pinched the bridge of his nose. "Very well," he said finally. "Come inside. Sit on the sofa, and do
While Harry tried to bite his smile into something less revealing, Draco yawned behind a politely upraised hand. If the point was to distract attention from Harry, it worked well.  Snape's head pivoted to him like a hawk sighting prey. Harry found himself wondering what was up. Snape had been on edge since they entered.
Harry stumbled awkwardly across the room and to the floor at Malfoy's feet. He found himself pulling down those skirts just for the pleasure of sliding his hands up under them, touching where he could not see. That was all very well, but in a minute, they were up even further, piled behind Malfoy's hard cock.
"Why would he expect that?" he asked innocently. "I'm a Gryffindor." People were still staring, but less as if they were waiting for him to die on the spot.
"I'm afraid Madam Pomfrey will be busy for several minutes," he remarked. "Fortunately, your case has progressed as expected, and we discussed it over tea, mere hours ago. In the matter of your discharge, she has approved me as her proxy."
Hugh came half out of his seat, but then -- slowly -- sat back down. Pansy was glaring at Blaise. Harry thought no one quite wanted to call Blaise out on the implied characterization of Voldemort, because that would make it explicit.
"Good enough." She drained her wine and stood, holding out her hand. "A pleasure doing business with you, Potter."
Harry was already sitting up. Ron had set the blooded potion to lips and mouth without being reminded. Harry tried to ignore the macabre sight and asked the question he and Draco had settled on.
"Millicent isn't a usual companion for her, though.  That's why it was significant that they approached me together. She spends much more time with Daphne and Cassandra."
Julian winced, as if expecting an explosion, which she ignored, crossing the room at a dignified pace. It couldn't be too urgent, Harry decided. Neither his notebook nor his beads had heated. Possibly, Draco was just giving her an excuse to come here without betraying interest -- and to show off that she could use his first name, if he'd read Julian's reaction right. When she reached him, he nodded at her, and -- deliberately starting with his wand to the side -- cast a quick spell.
"He'd never heard of the company before, much less applied there. A beautiful saleswitch hop-apparated down from their 'volcano' laboratory with a generous offer for him to do fascinating research in weather work."
"The two of you shouldn't be hitting each other at all," Hermione scolded, moving between them to take an arm of each. "Or anyone else. Good to have you back, Harry. Is Susara recovered as well?"
As promised, Tonks escorted them back to the Cauldron, fending off a few intrepid reporters who had staked out the back corridor, and with an admonition to Draco that he was on his own until she came to walk him to breakfast, left both of them at Draco's room. Draco dropped into the room's only chair.
"Yessir!" Dennis said eagerly, and dashed off. Shaking his head, Harry started back up the stairs. He was sure he hadn't been half that bouncy about running errands for Oliver.
"I still think you're making it all up," Daphne said, but lightly. "It's quite a good story, though."
Thornton huffed in an almost Thornton manner, and Draco smiled. His boy's features began to distort, and his body to grow. The magical bonds adjusted, pulling higher to keep the captive's chest raised and abdomen taut.  Draco turned fully and his gaze swept the man head to foot.
. Good. Now swoop the wand in loose loops, like an infinity symbol, and let it trail light, until you can see the whole symbol at once."
"Then don't give advice!  What do you know? You're with that oily, ferret-faced Slytherin, getting fucked before you get left."
They made it to Gryffindor tower unnoticed, if not unseen. Ron would occasionally stagger or veer to the side, but the Hufflepuffs in the library corridor had been heading down, away from them, and all their way up the stairs, no one else had been within a flight of their path. Harry pulled Ron away from a painting at the fourth floor landing when he stopped to tell a laughing tavern girl that he'd always thought she was pretty.
They didn't ask him any more questions about his relationship with Draco -- Harry suspected that the boys were too young to understand, and it was clear that Yolanda had the idea only in a vague gossip-column sort of way. He got them talking about their first classes instead. They had had Herbology, which Sammy said didn't seem so magical. He was delighted with Charms. Potions had terrified all of them.
"Oh! Yeah. I mean, Draco only introduced us this year, really, but we get along. Gilbert has a little sister in Hufflepuff too -- Gloria -- so he's in the mixed-house space with her a couple of days a week."
"You need to take my hand." Draco's voice dropped almost to a whisper. "Only a Malfoy can enter here unaccompanied."
She expected ranting, but he smiled even more easily than the last Harry. "Very good. And you? Still a Gryffindor?"
Harry grinned back at him. Remembering Draco's advice from earlier, he tapped the table beside him, beckoning Ron to join them. To his surprise, Ron did.
Draco sniggered. "He wasn't too upset, if that was the worst of it. I suspect he just overreacted because of your cheek; I told you not to wear Susara like that, and so soon after what you did to Theo--"
“It feels like that,” Harry said. His stomach twisted, but he couldn’t look away. “Felt. Would feel.”
Sirius leaned back against the low wall, his arms crossing, his smile wide. "And here I was afraid you'd been attacked."
mastering the Cruciatus curse, and I protested the tutelage, he demonstrated it on --" She looked down, and her shoulders bent. "On both of us."
Another, longer look passed between the twins, but they agreed. Draco set about preparing the contract.
"Thank you," Harry said, passing a second warmed bottle to Draco before opening one for himself. "I appreciate it."
"Yeah, I think I've learned that," Harry said, getting a chuckle from the old man. "And other Professors? I thought Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick might be involved as well."
A fist-sized missile hurtled past his head and caught the man in the chest. He fell back, the curse unfinished, and Draco grabbed Harry's arm and pointed to his own throat. Footsteps pounded from Diagon Alley as Harry undid the Muting hex on Draco. Immediately, Draco pointed his wand over Harry's shoulder and Harry whipped around to defend them, only to find that they now had two attackers to deal with.
"I take it you don't hate me, then?" Harry said hopefully, as Remus pulled into a parking space alongside a high wall.
"You will excuse me if I don't take your word for it." Snape turned, sneering, to Harry. "Have you any identifying marks?"
," he interrupted. "And if you had forsworn your birth family and become the witch you ought to be, that would be acceptable.
"But if we rotate people into the Keeper's slot during practice," Ginny objected, "they'd just be learning about us."
"Yeah. Alarmed, almost." Harry didn't think he could quite explain how Mrs. Malfoy had reacted. There had been more there than he could quite see. Beside him, Linnet sighed loudly.
"Well, only for sport, until the last world, but I'm good enough." He cocked his head to the side. "What do you do for
"No!" Harry knew he must look wild with fear. "No.  I mean, that would make it worse. More like-- I'll stay still."
"Malfoy? Well, I suppose he's hot, if you don't mind that evil sort of grace. I try not to think about him, though."
Harry winced and nodded. "A shop's come available in Diagon Alley, but they don't have the reserves." Draco eyed him sternly, and he sighed. "Look, I'll turn them down, if you want me to. The problem is that they don't respect anyone -- or nearly -- so expecting them to respect you--"
"I think my questioning was different," Luna said quietly. "Instead of asking about particular beads, Professor Flitwick asked what could I tell him."
"Wormtail," Harry explained. "I think I told you -- Sirius and Remus were ready to kill him, that night, and I intervened." He raked a hand through his hair. "I probably should have let them."
"You should organize some games," Harry encouraged, looking between them. "You could use the pitch -- we certainly don't care if the grass is kicked up."
, and any disciplinary action to which he may have been subject is therefore not admissible at a public hearing."
Harry nodded. "Agreed. Though he might not care about that either. Snape is his godf-- spellfather, and their relationship is a bit odd, really."
"Hm." Her cheeks dimpled at the challenge. "Well.  If you haven't been lying to me about a project with our head of house, it would have to be Friday or Saturday evening."
"Right, but most of us didn't choose it, did we?  This is just what we have to do to get on to the real stuff."
Harry wanted to wait for them to emerge, but it was cold to be out walking, and he was afraid he would be too conspicuous loitering by the greenhouse. Reluctantly, he returned to Gryffindor, reasoning that Hermione would look for him there.
It was the muting of conversations that made Harry look up. A number of people had arrived without any change in atmosphere, and he hadn't paid much attention to the latest clack of the door. Now, though, people were speaking more quietly and moving more carefully. At the end of the corridor stood Ron, his hand holding tightly to Hermione's.
It was clear that the tide of the trial had turned. When people whispered, their eyes went to Lucius more than to Harry. While Harry was talking about waiting for their arranged signal, he saw a note flutter down to the prosecution's box. Dumbledore caught it, and when Harry's testimony was over, he beckoned McGonagall over, and stood to take her place.
He looked up into Hermione's frown, but her eyes were on the papers spread out in front of him "Malfoy?" she asked. "Is he in trouble?"
"More, I think," Draco muttered, and the area was wetter, slicker. His touch soothed away the sharp feeling, and the push came slowly wider and deeper.
"Um...." Harry looked doubtfully at the little bundle. He'd never seen anything like it at Hogwarts. "Is this real? I mean, not some Muggle superstition?"
"Yet you testified at the trial -- perhaps not as forgotten as we had hoped. Or Harry's presence at Malfoy Manor reminded them of that betrayal."
"Well, you said that -- with Millicent -- that you hadn't broken any rules that I hadn't." She twirled a finger in her hair, giving him a moment to recover from his relief. "But the more I think about it, the less reassuring that is. After all, there are a number of things that I have done in the past that I'm not sure I'd approve of now." She looked up at him. "I'd like you to be more specific."
Harry joined him at the rail. "No offense intended. Just ... is there someone who usually lies to you?"
"Yeah?" Harry leaned into it -- just a little, pushing, but not forcing. "Like this? In slowly, letting you open for me?"
Emboldened, Harry opened his fingers for a longer touch, enjoying the smooth warmth of skin under his fingertips. He traced down Malfoy's sides, and then his spine, lifting his thumbs before they met the top of the cleft between his buttocks. He swallowed and stroked down Malfoy's sides again, skirting his buttocks to continue down his legs. Malfoy had nice muscles there that felt good against Harry's palm. Harry backed up and stroked down again, this time over the firm curves of Malfoy's arse. He bit off a moan.
"Fuck." Draco's eyes closed again, and his neck lengthened as he stretched his head back. "Just.... More. A little more."
"Shall I have him tell Snuffles you say hi?" he tried. From the way her eyes widened, he could tell she had just understood his meaning.
George leaned against the wall, his arms crossing over his chest. "So, Harrykins, why are you buying
"Bed," Draco growled, squeezing in emphasis, and then letting go. "Now. I may be desperate, but I refuse to be ridiculous.  We
"I do know her well."  Snape's face twisted. "Or as well as it is possible. You must realize, Harry, that she scarcely regards you as human."
"And?" Harry demanded furiously. "If you were a boy, I'd--" He stopped. "Look," he said, more moderately, "how would
"I will start with my clothes off," Malfoy said thoughtfully. "You should take your robe and shirt off -- and shoes, of course -- but you can leave your trousers on, for now." That decided, he began to undress. Harry both admired and resented Malfoy's blasé grace as he fumbled with his own clothing. He managed not to look too closely when Malfoy dropped his trousers, but he caught a glimpse of a pale, quiescent prick draped down over moderate bollocks. When Malfoy turned away, Harry dared a longer look, and caught himself studying a neat, muscled arse. He swallowed. Malfoy lay down on his stomach with his legs almost together.
Harry panted and said things -- he wasn't sure what and it probably didn't matter, but he thought Draco was calling him beautiful, which was pretty nonsensical too, and the magic swirled and thickened until he thought they could swim in it, and Draco came screaming, which was possible the best thing he'd ever heard.
"Hm." Draco looked thoughtful. "I have an idea. Let's have her and the Weasleys here for a short visit tomorrow evening, to see how it works. We'll invite Millicent too. It will be an odd group, but all Quidditch players, which gives us a natural topic of conversation. Then on Wednesday, we can bring Linnet and Gilbert, and anyone else we want to add, so by Friday we should know if we've made an error in judgment."
At first, things seemed to be going well enough. Snape greeted him warmly -- that was disturbing -- and gestured them to seats by the fire.
Shrugging, Harry inclined his head to acknowledge the truth of that. "If I get any time alone with Tonks at the Veritaserum interview, I'll ask."
"Nothing that I've heard. They're studying it."  Her hand pressed his to the point of pain. "If they can't do anything, I wait seven years. Understood?"
With hesitant steps, Ron came into the chamber. He looked miserable. "I really am sorry, Harry. I hadn't meant--"
. "I'm studying with him," he said quickly, "but not like before." Professor Dumbledore leaned unnervingly close, making Harry wish he could move back. "Nothing Dark, I mean. I think it's just that my boyfriend is his spellson, and she knows it had something to do with Draco."
"Do you know about imitative construction in glamours?" Hermione asked him eagerly. "I had the idea that one should start first with a subtle element, but Harry says you should start with the basic changes."
by being a spy." He let out a breath, and tried to let some of the old anger go with it. "Really, Severus -- that's what you're best at -- potions. And I do think you helped us more than you did Voldemort, though more important people may not be convinced. Now come back under the blankets; you're shivering."
"Okay. Would you transfigure the table into a bed, then? You did such a beautiful job with it before."
Millicent scowled, in a way that Harry would have found distinctly hostile a year ago. Now he was fairly sure that it just meant she was thinking hard.
"Letter?" Harry widened his eyes innocently, but then ruined the effect by grinning. "I am so bad at that! Yes, I heard there was a letter." He laughed. It felt good to be here. "You should be flattered, you know. Draco described you as 'trustworthy.'"
Behind them, Fang began to bay again, and they looked back at the hut. The door opened, and for a moment, Harry saw his godfather standing in the opening. Then he was gone, and a black dog coursing towards them, with Fang in delighted pursuit. Draco screamed but managed to cut it short, holding painfully to Harry’s hand. Remus Lupin was sauntering out of the door now, with Hagrid waving behind him. The dog had reached them. It nuzzled at Harry’s hand before bouncing back and changing again.
Breathless with lust, he reached out to seize her hips.  "Fine with me." If his view of her face had been better, he might have said something about taking it like a bitch, but he didn't feel like risking it, considering. He bumped up against her for a few seconds, enjoying the heat, before trying to go in. It was a bit more difficult from this angle, and Malfoy confused the issue by whining with equal fervor whether he was prodding her pussy or her arse. He finally gave up and found her cunt with his fingers and guided himself in by hand. Her answering cry had a touch of alarm in it, and he forced himself to stop at the top of the thrust.
At Cabot's "Sit," he practically fell into the waiting chair. Cabot had him keep his tongue out while he floated the first drop onto it. Harry didn't feel the impact of the liquid itself, but his tongue immediately grew heavier. The second drop spread lethargy down his throat and into his limbs. He couldn't tell if his mouth was still dry.
Harry tilted back his head, but didn't quite laugh out loud. "Oh, you don't understand Slytherins, Cornelia. Most of them don't think we can hide anything. Draco knows
witch would know that. It's the right sort of curse, though, isn't it? I mean, if you remember some of your lessons, and less about your usual companion, and nothing at all about sex?"
Still, what was the point in Draco trying to pretend there was nothing between them? Harry bit his lip. Perhaps Draco had agreed to break up with him in return for some favor from an ally? Or in his absence -- and Snape's presence -- he had become more dissatisfied that Harry wasn't a pureblood? Perhaps he was inviting him to his room only to tell him that he was ending it.
In the Great Hall, Seamus shoved Harry into a spot next to Hermione. That was the last place Harry wanted to be, but couldn't very well say so. He needed a moment or two to steel himself to try a sip of pumpkin juice, and twice as long to bring himself to nibble on a bun. By the time he looked up and noticed that Seamus hadn't sat down himself, Seamus was all the way over to the Slytherin table.
She looked down, but Harry could see her cheeks rounding with a not-quite-hidden smile. "Well, thank you, then. But--"
"Are you mental?" Harry asked. "Plenty, thanks -- but all of it before that from people who wanted to
Gently, he licked up. The question was not if Draco would wake, but when. Would it be now, when he spread out his tongue and pressed up Draco's hardening shaft? Now, when he took the tip in his mouth, still needing to lift, but not so much?
Sunday started badly, with the Daily Prophet reporting two separate attacks on mixed families -- two orphans, one widow, six dead, Harry noted. He forced himself to read through the article, noticing only when he came to the details of the first one, in West Sussex, that he had previously skimmed to the totals. The realization flooded him with guilt, although he could not say why. In Yorkshire, one of the attackers had been killed and subsequently identified as a 'well-respected' local politician. Harry stomach churned over quote after quote about how the man had been a 'traditionalist,' but it was unbelievable that he would participate in criminal activity. He ate almost nothing, and in their morning practical session with Professor McGonagall, he twice cracked the wood of the door Draco was working while trying to transfigure wooden hinges to bronze. McGonagall, herself subdued, gently counseled him to rein in his temper, and set them to repeating earlier exercises on scrap,until sheer tedium had Harry's magic under control. They got to lunch just in time for Harry to gulp down some watery swedes and potatoes -- he couldn't contemplate the meat -- and then he and Draco were on their way to Snape's rooms.
When Harry got back to the shop, the twins were waiting for him. They had apparently stopped working, unless they were doing the planning sort of working; he found them at the table in the back room, with two mostly empty pint glasses of dark beer. Whatever they were saying was cut short by his arrival.
“Which is quite enough information,” Draco interrupted. “We don’t need to say what or how and give others ideas.”
“Perhaps a witch?” Susan suggested. Hecksban approved of the thought, but she had no better results. No one else considered an attempt worthwhile.
They had settled on the blue sofa -- exchanging light touches, but not yet kissing -- when they heard the door open. Padma, Harry reflected, sounded like Parvati on a Calming Draught -- the intonation just a little too regular to fade into the background of everyday voices. He heard Sophia answer her, but Luna drifted in before them.
There was silence. Neville cleared his throat. The door opened again, closing as footsteps approached.  Parvati entered, with Cornelia behind her.
By unspoken agreement, they kept their conversation at light as possible, given the circumstances, although weightier matters crept in from time to time. Draco gossiped about the staff at Hogwarts and about various of his relatives, but he also related that he had exchanged several tense letters with Pansy. Harry couldn't fully appreciate the food without remarking how good it was not be given the worst pieces of everything, and he admitted that he and Ron had not been in communication at all. For all the unpleasant elements, Harry felt his anxiety melting away. Spring hadn't been some sort of hopeless fantasy; being with Draco was really that good.
"If you need special assistance, Potter, come to my office during my scheduled hours, as other students do.
"The one I taught you should be safe, Potter. The headmaster knows about it already, so no one can bear damaging tales."
It was perhaps not fair, in that Snape may not have understood that he was allowed to refuse, but Harry doubted that he really
While the Hogwarts Express was pulling into the station, Harry watched out the window to see the platform move into view. Hagrid's great bulk was obvious as he waited for the first-years, but beyond him, Harry saw the glimmer of blond hair over black student robes.
Ron looked over at Harry, clearly expecting a rebuttal.  Deliberately, Harry nodded. "Yeah. It's not just bravery and guile, either. It's the different motivations each finds familiar. Though some of that is crap, of course. I told you about that barking motivational consultant who seemed to think that I needed to be told every damn assignment was hideously dangerous."
it did. The problem was, that he couldn't help thinking of them as sort of people-like -- too much so to use parts from. Were they really, though, or were they just people-
"I only submit to this humiliation once per day," Harry responded with a smile. "Besides, I'm meeting Draco."
Draco pressed, and Harry did his best to relax for the intrusion. He felt that he was stretching open, and thought Draco might have actually got in, but when Draco finally started to move again, realized it must have been nothing -- a fraction of an inch, at most. Draco went back to rubbing against him. They cycled through that, time and time again.
The next day wasn't a brewing Sunday, but Harry met Millicent in the Uncommon Room for a lesson on glamours. She was getting better. She could keep the visual glamour on her shoes when she walked, now, although they didn't clonk in the right way. He had her try her robes, which were harder, because of the way the fabric moved. When she paced back and forth, he saw occasional flashes of the true cloth.
That hit a nerve. Potter bristled. "I can understand if you distrust Aurors in general," he said indignantly. "But the last time we were at Hogwarts together, I saved your life. And I helped keep you and your mother out of Azkaban. You can't think I'm out to get you!"
Harry slipped into the seat beside Draco in Cursebreaking on Monday. Professor Hecksban was still arranging a few items at up at the front of the class. "I can't stay after," he whispered.
He frowned. He couldn't actually blame her for not wanting one of the twins to change her appearance. "Well, is there anyone you would trust?"
Harry rolled Malfoy over to lie on top of her. Malfoy's leg was still tight around his, but he came up on his arms, letting his hips push forward, and smiling at Malfoy's responsive moan. "Oh, I think I'd notice."
Harry winced. "More like ... losing a bet? It's just a parlor game, really." He picked up his older strand, festooned with copious green, among pink, blue, white, red, brown and other beads. "I lose to Slytherins a lot."
"Look, I worked it out, then, okay? Why I'm so important. And I talked to Dumbledore about it, and he told me what my parents had done...." Harry trailed off, unable to continue. Remus looked stricken.
"True," Draco said. "Fortunately." He stared moodily into the fire. "How was your day? Otherwise, I mean."
“Stuck in the hallway,” Ron said. “With you thrashing on the floor, and your legs flopping, rather than kicking. Until Hermione was brilliant, of course.”
"Great. Dennis is already feeling overworked, and here I'm going to send him right out again." Considering the matter, he decided to go upstairs and look for a teammate -- preferably a younger one, whose assistant would have a lighter academic workload.
"But they're worse." Harry looked at Ron's incredulous expression and sighed. "She said she might be able to get something using the body of someone just murdered by him, or with unicorn's blood. I
," he said finally. "Of course, neither is apparating out of someone's house, but I didn't want both of us to have our backs to her."
"A well-meaning one though, I believe," Draco added. "And Gilbert's little sister is clever and observant, despite her optimism."
"Not be seen...!" Harry had imagined a warmer reception than that. He frowned. "Oh, fine! Tell him I accept."
Sirius coughed. "So, the Malfoys are down a House Elf, are they?" he said casually. "Do they have any left?"
After lunch, they had Defense Against the Dark Arts, which wasn't too bad. Harry didn't know the professor, of course, but he was perfectly comfortable with the sort of battle hexes under discussion. Better yet, no one seemed to find his proficiency worthy of comment. Charms was a little more difficult, but not as incomprehensible as Transfiguration.
not too deep. No, you use me when you need numbers work -- one of the many things that makes me indispensable to you. Here! I have an idea."
"Let me...." Draco's trousers were apparently held closed with hooks, which he undid with two practiced pinches of fabric.  Harry immediately pulled them down to Draco's knees. He was distracted by the sight of Draco's hard cock and traced his finger up it, feeling his heart speed up as it twitched under his touch. An uneven pitching of Draco's hips turned out to be Draco kicking trousers and pants off the rest of the way.
"Well, if it was a weekday, I'd have you try the mixed-house space," Harry said. "But it's closed now. Just the library."
"Something like that, I suppose," Harry said, ignoring Sophia's sarcasm, "but maybe less simple." He thought glumly of Parcheesi. "I have a set of glass balls with horses."
"Professor Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley both asked to be informed when you arrived. Do you wish to see them as well?"
Draco shook his head. "Don't worry. They will be."  He sat down on the bed. "Was that all? I'd like to tell you some about my consultation."
"Right. Of course." Draco straightened.  "So, when I wished to use the pensieve, I sent some basic diagnostic spells at it, like so." He cast two spells that they had learned in October at the empty pensieve. The first sparked orange from the center of the bowl, and the second crackled at the edges with indigo lines. "Guarded by some means, and you can clearly see the spikes of Dark Arts, but only at the edge, which was what first led me to suspect layering. I had already tested other items in the room, to determine which Harry should avoid, and several could just go to the attic -- or into the fire. However, I did not want to relinquish use of the Pensieve."
"Finally," Malfoy looked up, eyes gleaming in the flickering light. "That's rough on the jaw, you know."
"Blaise is quite right about it being conversation compressed, of course," Draco said cheerfully, sending a quick smile in Blaise's direction. "You can even lie, if you feel the need, although I never have."
"He feels like you are." Harry bit his lip. "You have to be careful with Slytherins.  Sometimes they're too subtle -- too used to subtle. They interpret things."
"Not bad. I'm in the accelerated class, which meets all day tomorrow, and then all day next Sunday.  I think they switch us back to the regular one if we can't pass at the end of that."
"I'd try 'Do you have room for another?' but if you're not comfortable, you don't have to. Gloria likes them, though -- Gloria Clarke, I mean."
Harry sighed in relief. "Well, that's something. The last world kept making me cringe. So, we're actually friends?"
Draco straightened, quietly attracting attention. "She is non-negotiable. Harry and I are certain that she will be much less of a danger if she is invited, rather than finding out."
"I expect you recall how she came in from the reserves last spring to substitute for Goyle -- just as tough, nearly as tall, and a good deal cannier. I sent her parents a note of congratulations on their daughter's fine first match -- only to get a Howler in reply. Miss Bulstrode, in the
Hermione, however, seemed to want to make the session as social as possible. She engaged him in a discussion of glamours, and to his complete horror, seemed willing to replace her concept of how imitative construction worked with his, which he was sure wasn't as accurate. He had to quickly backtrack, emphasizing that he wasn't at all sure he understood it and thought she might have it right. While she pored back over her notes in undeserved confusion, he steadied his breath and wondered if he could possibly have miscast the spell. Maybe it was Snape he should talk to, not Draco. The way that Hermione was behaving went well beyond the description of the curse in Snape's book. According to that, he would need to be persuasive, even with the spell in place, and what she would believe was limited. In practice, he thought he could probably tell her the sky was green and she would conclude that she had a previously unnoticed problem distinguishing among colors.
"Only because he feels she has few other options.  But yes. And they argued far less, this visit." With a sigh, Draco slid back off the bed to stand. "We should take a quick shower and dress.  Perhaps she's sent a message -- she must be finished at the MLE by now -- or if she isn't, something is wrong."
"I do hope I'm not interrupting," Gilbert drawled. He set himself down on the newest sofa, one in Slytherin green velvet, and smirked. "Or at least that you can't admit I am."
"Draco. And Mr. Potter. How unexpected." He stepped back, ushering them in with a mockery of graciousness. "Is the emergency of a critical nature, or shall I call for tea?"
Sammy's head whipped around, and after a second, he gave Harry a tentative smile. "Was it like this for you?"
"Look," Draco said. "You can still use Dark Arts without him finding out, if we arrange things correctly."
Harry walked very close to her in the hallways, and sat beside her in the classroom. To his great relief, she stayed.
He had possibly, Harry thought, cast it. It could have been on last year's list. It was that sort of thing.
“Harry James Potter,” Harry said. He’d been considering mentioning Sirius, but perhaps that had better wait. “I’ve never been homesick … unless you count missing Hogwarts over the summer.”
When Harry came back from breakfast the next morning, Seamus and Dean and Neville were just leaving the dormitory, and Ron was just waking up. Harry waited for him to stretch and rub the sleep out of his eyes before showing him the snipping of plant he still had in his coat pocket.
"Hi," Harry answered. "Look, I wanted to apologize to Hermione.  Snape messed around with the formula again, and it had some after-effects."
The Gryffindors didn't have as many classes with Hufflepuffs as with Slytherins, but Harry knew who Susan Bones was. She had never struck him as particularly upper-class, but considering her aunt -- whose language and manner screamed "earthy country aristocracy" -- he supposed she probably was.
"Mm." Draco leaned into Harry's arm. "You're incorrigible. We would have taught you so much in Slytherin."
The boy Hermione thought of as 'Sirius's Harry' went into his room in the tent, but Hermione had no sooner sat down with her maps and her notes than he emerged again.
“I still think we could go to Wizenlea House in the back room,” Sirius grumbled. “Kingsley even said it was secure enough.”
Without preliminaries, he dropped to his knees and rubbed his face against Harry's bare cock, streaking his cheek with glistening liquid.
Harry tensed, and he could feel Draco, beside him, do the same. Whispers spread through the Wizengamot. Dumbledore's voice cut through them.
"Wha--?"  Harry's jaw dropped. He looked over at Sirius who was changing from rolling his eyes to laughing.
"Harry," Remus said wearily, "there is nothing about being from an old pureblood family that should interest you."
His laugh was low and soft. "So forthright, Harry. It's delightful, now that I've noticed." His hand curved over one cheek of Harry's arse. "I should have had you take those trousers off when you put on the robes. Let me get them now."
Harry's mind immediately filled with vague images of anything Eugene might have ordered under his old name. Was he going to handcuff Malfoy? Malfoy probably would look lovely chained to a bed, and preferably gagged, or maybe with his mouth full by other means.
"Mr. Potter!" the headmaster exclaimed, turning from Fawkes, who trilled a welcome. "How good to see you." He looked keenly over his half-moon glasses. "I must admit, I had been expecting you yesterday."
Harry sighed. "No. Well, I'll get some things from him, but no, I wouldn't risk anything of yours, and most of mine can't be through him, because Dumbledore might find out, and curiously, I no longer want Snape fired.
He was in total darkness, and certain, somehow, that he was inside a real building. Warm blankets covered him, and a weight rested on part of his hip. He reached up, felt flesh, and, gasping, jerked away.
"How dare you!" Pansy shrieked, but this time he heard Julian's "What?" and Blaise's soft "Ha!" He watched himself swallow as he stared at the glowing words.
"That was Draco's feeling. That since we'd been out of contact, and then I was Head Girl, I'd moved into that sphere of distrust that you reserve for anyone who might claim authority over you."
"That she was blackmailing you, or you were using her as an envoy, or something...." She shrugged. "Something you might need Gryffindor friends to know about."
"Oh, it's that interhouse common space issue," Parvati said, stretching back. They kissed, long and deep, making two nearby fifth-years giggle. Harry wondered if he should leave, but when they finally finished, and Seamus had sat at the other side of Parvati, he looked at Harry. "That still on?" he asked.
For the sake of efficiency, Harry left the room under his invisibility cloak, but the sight of Nott, fast asleep in his bed, made him slow, and then stop. He saw Draco open the door to the darkened passage to the Common Room and pause with it ajar, but he was still standing by Nott's bed when the door closed behind his lover. He didn't want a fight -- not now -- but he needed Voldemort's young servant to know that he had been here, while Nott was helpless in sleep. After a second's thought, he cast the writing spell that he and Draco had used in the Chamber of Secrets -- almost a full year ago, now -- and drew a lightning bolt on the wall behind Nott's sleeping form. It didn't look quite right, but he thought the message was clear.
"She's been crying! Look how her eyes are blue underneath -- she's overusing spells to keep them from being puffy. Will she talk to you at all?"
He shook his head. "I expect Professor Dumbledore is keeping an eye on it now. Send me an owl, and Draco or I will floo out."
, gone too quickly to identify, crossed Snape's face, and a moment later, he stepped out of the flames.
She frowned. "If you swear him to secrecy.... Oh, give me a while to think about it. I'll tell you during September."
When they told Auror Tonks that they wanted an escort down to Fred and George's flat, and then privacy once they were there, she cheerfully shook her head. "I can stay out of earshot," she said, "but I need to have you in sight."
"Our private lab," he said, opening a narrow door and waving them in with a flourish. "Step inside."
"Hm. I wonder if it's true, after all, that Muggle blood adds size." He licked his lips. "I hope you're satisfied with receiving, because I doubt that would fit."
He didn't seek Ron out -- as far as he was concerned, that was Ron's job, this time, but he went where he would usually go, after breakfast -- to the lower Gryffindor laboratory, where the Quidditch team had a private section for their project. Ron was coming down the spiral stairs from the Common Room before Harry had the folding grill compressed enough to slip past. In the brief glance it took to identify him, Harry found he was still a little bit angry and even a little bit hurt. He stood still, staring at the elongated brass diamonds that separated the team's reserved space from the main room.
Draco, no doubt listening from the bedroom, chose that moment to stroll out, Harry's longest shirt open over sleek grey trousers.
Draco left while Harry was still waiting impatiently for Hermione to finish her porridge. When they left together, she would have started directly for the dungeons, but Harry led her up one flight, and then brought her down the second-floor corridor to the back stairs.
the sort of fit you're throwing now. I understand, and we'll tell you when, and arrange a place to meet."
. I've mended the rupture, but it's fragile yet, and you need something to counter the toxins." She bustled away, moving out of Harry's line of sight, but he could hear the clink of glass bottles close behind his head.
"Good," Harry soothed and fastened the first cuff, pulling the strap through the buckle until the fleece was snug against Snape's wrist. Snape let out a desperate little sound and took a quick breath.
Hecksban cleared his throat, and sat in his typical place -- the front of the desk -- safely to the side of the cursed Pensieve. "So," he declared. "We have half an hour left of our allotted two. Let's use that to discuss what we've learned, and how it affects our next move. Any thoughts?"
Crossing his arms over his chest, Harry leaned back against the hard wall. "So you'll stop taking it all the time?"
Snape lifted his eyebrows. "The point is preserving your life, Potter, not muddling your Quidditch skills."
People noticed when he stepped through the portrait hole, with conversations slowing or stuttering as it closed behind him. His first thought was that they could
Giving up on distractions, Harry rose high, as Seekers did by default.  Malfoy was there, smugly surveying the pitch without distractions. Harry, dragon in pursuit, headed towards him. Malfoy, secure in the knowledge of the dragon's targeting, ignored him.
"What?" As he turned, Draco hissed, and brought his wrist to his mouth. "Ouch. No, I'm afraid the Bulstrodes are not in our circles."
Dumbledore coughed. Shacklebolt folded his arms over his chest. Harry did the same. After a moment, the Auror nodded. "Point taken, Mr. Potter. I will speak to her. I expect Headmaster Dumbledore will not object to my further use of his office?
Snape reached forward and took one of Harry's green beads between thumb and forefinger, giving in a little spin. "These. They are worn by two Ravenclaws, as well."
"Oh, it's just a toy," Cornelia said. "For pretending to be ... not like a tiny real Fairy, you know, but a human-sized, powerful, beautiful one, with a gauzy dress and something between a wand and a sceptre...."
"But--" She smiled slightly and lifted her chin. "If this was the shared secret you told me about before, I think I already know who is involved."
"Gryffindor," Malfoy sniffed. "Straight to the point, I see." He leaned over and took one of Harry's nipples between tight-held lips, making Harry yelp in surprise.
She broke into a cheery smile.  "Good! Up on the bed, now, and let me examine you. If nothing is wrong, you'll be able to have dinner in the Great Hall."
Trembling, Harry sat on the edge of the bed. Malfoy's body was stretched out before him in clean lines of fair skin -- skin that looked frighteningly perfect. Tentatively, Harry reached out one hand and stroked the fingers from Malfoy's shoulder to the small of his back.
"It's-- I feel like I'm trying to be two different people at once. She's going to interrogate me about Hermione, I'm sure."
"I'm willing to bet that a lot of people in the Ministry never wanted to figure it out, and it's certainly no one's priority.  I'm in Magical Law Enforcement, you're in Experimental Charms, and Ron's in Games and Sports -- we can all collect information. If we narrow down the time period it might have been cast, we can look for people who were killed then."
Harry wondered if he dared take another bite of the quail. It would be frighteningly obvious in the stillness. Professor Snape touched his goblet of water, but did not lift it.
Draco shrugged. "I expect so. He has a vested interest in cooperating." He smirked sidelong at Harry. "And he
"Right." They'd talked about that on Sunday.  Millicent hauled up an ottoman in front of the couch and plopped down on it. In other parts of the room, people had begun to talk quietly. Padma was pulling things out of her school bag. "Well, that's crap," she said sympathetically. "The headmaster came down to tell you?"
"No. Just that he'd seen the rat with Ron in a picture in the paper, and he'd known that he had to get to Hogwarts, because Pettigrew was set up where he could kill me if Voldemort came back, and Sirius wanted to protect me."
Harry wasn't quite sure what Draco intended, but he decided to play along. "Control Spirit," he answered. "It allows you to give one command to a ghost. I used it to ensure Moaning Myrtle wouldn't tell about something she'd seen me and Draco do."
Harry crossed his arms over his chest and looked away. The envelope was still on his lap. Draco reached out for it.
Snape's cock gave an interested twitch, Harry noticed. He wondered what the man was thinking. Snape lay down compliantly, and Harry straddled one of his legs. He licked along several of the marks on his back, and then bit at one on his arse. Severus moaned.
"Here," he said, passing down a glass. "Look, I'm sorry I didn't know you were in prison. I've been busy with my godson, and Kingsley's campaign, and more funerals than anyone should need to attend in a lifetime."
"This has more of an audience than most chat, though," Seamus argued, getting a pout from Parvati. She was staying quiet, but the decision clearly mattered to her. Her hands were clasped tightly in her lap and she was sitting so still that her earrings didn't even shimmer.
Returning his attention to his lover, Harry turned the flogger in a quick motion of his wrist, landing a set of light strokes, shoulders to arse, laying a base of sensation. For a moment, he stopped, stroking his hand down the warmed skin.
"Okay there, mate?" he asked, cautiously setting a hand on Ron's back. Ron gasped and coughed again.
He had been thinking he might dance, earlier, but during the time he was gone, many of the older students had paired off for walks, or settled in groups to chat, and the dancers were mostly younger, now. Harry leaned against a rock and watched, wondering if it was worth joining in anyway. Maybe if he went and talked to Ron and Hermione, they would follow him back in at the next tune?  While he was considering that, someone began to approach from his right. Harry glanced over. Malfoy, he realized, and pretended not to notice, while he inwardly prepared for a fight. Indeed, Malfoy stopped a step in front of him.
"So you believe this all weakness on her part?"  Draco mocked. "Hermione Granger is insecure in her research conclusions?"
"That's what he was called then. Voldemort was an ana-- al-- whatever you call those things where you rearrange the letters."
Luna, who was next to Sophia, stood. "I need to move further down, I think." She walked behind the next sofa, and, going around it, studied the narrow space between Harry and Ron. Harry shifted a little closer to Draco to create more space, but Ron moved over into it. With a shrug, Luna sat on the arm of the sofa.
"I believe much of it is holiday stress. Many students get this way when it is time to go home for Christmas. You are friends with Miss Bulstrode, I believe?"
He wondered about the emotions, and the history behind them.  This was a man who armored himself with scorn, but was vulnerable without it.  Harry imagined his life must have been hard -- perhaps he had also been unwanted at home, or derided at primary school, and had not found friends to open his heart, as Harry had.
anyone, while the sounds of music and cheerful chatter grew closer. Just past the turn at the low pines he finally saw the colors of the maypole and the crowd. It was a little dizzying after a long day indoors. The afternoon sun was just breaking through the clouds and shone off ribbons of many colors, none of them in precisely house hues. The dancers -- and there was an outer arc curving around the circle at the maypole -- had all taken off their black student coats and were displaying the riotous clothes that Hermione had once classified as "Victorian
"Apparently, I --- or, he, that is, Harry One -- was your father's protégé. He was Minister for Magic, there, by the way -- that Lucius Malfoy -- but he often advanced legislation written by Harry. That gave them both more clout, I think."
"Good." Draco cleared his throat. "That's settled, then, and you can let him know that I spoke to you. Are you well enough to brew for this afternoon?"
Ron moved suddenly, rolling onto his side. Harry readied for more vomiting, but Ron just took a sip of water.
"Boys!" Mrs. Weasley reproved. She smiled at Harry, and patted his hand. "Harry is right. Fair play is more important than winning a silly award."
She shook her head as he drew his wand. "Zabini, don't you dare duplicate my fruit! You know it dilutes the flavor."
They had no sooner stepped in and closed the door than Myrtle shot up out of the floor drain. "Oh good!" she said. "I thought you weren't going to show, and I'd have to hunt through the toilets to get back at you."
Thoughtfully, Draco nodded. "For you to use Slytherin, though ... That would be a benefit to us in itself, in some ways."
Again, as if the hex shouldn't split the bowl, he separated the swirls of blood into two regions with
The ooze had more of a greenish tinge to it, that day, or perhaps Harry's vision was better, but it still tasted like spoiled meat. Fortunately, it knocked him out before he could think about it too much.
Draco's reply was drowned out by competing incantations.  Fred went crashing into the door, and Harry felt a stinging lash across his chest. He pressed forward anyway, standing over Fred. Footsteps clattered inside the room, and George hastily ended his charm.
Harry thought. "Some of them," he answered slowly. "Seamus Finnigan will," he said. "Ron Weasley, maybe? Millicent Bulstrode...."
With that, he jogged off, and Shacklebolt gestured Harry toward a path of rumpled fabric that crossed over snow and mud through the open gate. "Walk on the silk only," he said, "and don't touch your wand. We're trying to preserve as much spell trace as possible."
"Not as something he did," Seamus said, reaching for the porridge, "but he should know by now that you need more care."
Ten seconds later, they were in the Uncommon room, with the password changed, clinging to each other on the squashiest sofa.
There was a moment of silence as they digested this, or possibly as Mason did, and Tonks pretended to.
"It was a Death Curse. It was a little like him leaving again." Draco seized a handkerchief from the side table, blew his nose, and then waved it with incongruous grace while he gave Harry a lopsided smile.  "It's all right. It was long ago. I just have this leftover bit to get over."
"Because we're both right. That wasn't enough for our last time flying against each other, but we need to be just
Blaise grinned. "Well, as I'm currently lacking a gorgeous lover, yes. Hm." He leaned forward, his feet coming to the ground. "Why? If I may ask."
Draco yanked the coarse parchment, a cutting from the Daily Prophet, from Parvati's grasp. Only her willingness to let go kept it from being ripped. Harry watched his eyes flick back and forth as he scanned it, and then rise again to read it more slowly.  His breathing was beginning to steady, but when Harry moved a hand under his, he grasped it tightly.
"That's not bad, right? I mean, I already know a bunch of things you can do with Fairy silk, and I haven't even started my O.W.L year."
"Not until last year?" Frowning, Snape cocked his head. "I would have expected you to be informed after the debacle of your fourth year."
After a few tense minutes, during which the Slytherin tarp stayed still, Archibald got the Quaffle and made a play for the Slytherin goals. In a sudden dive, Harry headed for the Gryffindor end of the pitch, and Malfoy, as he had hoped, followed. When they were near the tarp, Harry signaled Creevy, who released the cover. The freed Bludger, predictably, went straight for Malfoy, who swerved to the side.
"Wait," Harry said. Draco huffed, but sat without complaint.  Sirius looked nervously at him and then back at Harry. He licked his lips.
not true." He leaned over awkwardly to give Harry an encouraging punch in the shoulder. "Don't let it get to you."
"We should come here some time," he whispered, his hand inching closer to Draco. "Really late at night."
"How are things going with Hermione?" Draco asked on Saturday morning. They had met in the Uncommon room to clean up from the night before, as they often did. Draco thought they should have Dobby do it, but Harry didn't want to strain his loyalties that greatly.
Harry took a breath. "His father used it. Often. For bribery. That's why he knew it's more effective if the subject wants to believe you."
The game lasted until dinner, and they all went down together. Descending the staircase, they speculated as to whether the board would last the week or need to be remade. In the Great Hall, they settled at the large, oval table that replaced all the others. Harry counted twenty seats, but many were empty. Professor Sprout was the only faculty member present. Harry nodded to Seymour and Ruthven from Slytherin, and waved at Callie Somers, a Hufflepuff third-year who had come to the Mixed-House space with Gloria a few times. Sophia hurried in at the last moment with Jeremy Goldsmith, a seventh-year Ravenclaw boy, and two younger Ravenclaws. All of them had at least one book. Hagrid entered at the heels of Professor Snape, who seemed to be trying to ignore him.
By Tuesday evening, Harry felt he was better, but Madame Pomfrey wouldn't let him out of bed, and Draco was still being kind to him, so he supposed he wasn't. Hermione and Draco brought him his assignments, and Madam Pomfrey provided a lap desk so he could read and write more easily. Knowing he should be grateful didn't make that any less irritating. Ron was stuck in detention, Hermione informed him, and banned from visiting anyway. A card by his bed showed that Mill had stopped by while he was asleep. The front displayed a short loop of the famous Burdeski/Garcia crash of the '80 World Cup, and inside, a wobbling cartoon of Garcia sat splay-legged on the pitch, with Snidgets flitting around his head. The inscription inside was "Best Wishes for your Latest Recovery." It made him laugh.
"Certainly nothing would be finalized until after school -- for quite some time after. I don't expect anything that would require me to avoid admitting to our relationship until at least September."
After Blaise, the Hexacles went to Draco, whose lip curled as he twisted the rings. The professor used them last, moving the wavy Means ring back and forth more than Harry expected. It was physical; what else was there to see?
Draco sighed and levered himself out of the chair. "Give us a few minutes, Harry? I'll come to your room when I'm done."
"No, um ... that was good." He laughed slightly.  "Weird, but good." Still, he wished she'd come and kiss him for a moment. He felt very on display, especially under the intensity of her scrutiny. Given that, he had no cause to be disappointed when she withdrew the finger, but he was.
There was a huge crackling of twigs to one side of the path behind them. Harry whirled to see Draco emerging through the fiery branches.
"May I...?" Harry pleaded, sitting up as much as the chain would allow and stretching his tongue suggestively out.
"Seven points to Gryffindor," Snape's voice dropped, "for delicate handling of a volatile material."
he thought furiously. He felt ridiculous. When he spoke the incantation, the feather didn't so much as quiver.
"Are we done talking?" Harry crossed his foot over one of Draco's, rubbing their ankles together with a subtle motion. "Shall we find some place a little more visually private?"
In a flash, Harry was on the ground, his Firebolt still between his legs, and his wand at Malfoy's throat. "Who's waiting?"
"Remus had a difficult moon," Sirius said. Anxiety raised the pitch of his voice. Harry held back sympathy and anger both and took a sip of his tea.
Harry nodded. "Okay. We can talk to him Monday. I'm also planning on asking Dumbledore tomorrow -- I saw he was back, this evening, but thought it might as well wait until after the divination, in case something else comes up."
After that, it was back to the clerk, who read one name: Dennis Avery. He followed that with a long list of charges brought against the man. Harry wasn't terribly surprised when Avery stood and declared that he was innocent. He had escaped, after all, and it was only Snape who could say that he had been among the six who had pursued Draco. Lucius Malfoy came next, and the clerk read out his name and a similar, if slightly longer, list of charges.  He also, declared that he was innocent, causing Harry to twitch forward. Draco, at his side, sat ramrod straight and silent. The next defendant was Nott, who in contrast, stood and ranted for five minutes about how he had pursued the ungrateful brat, blood traitor that he was, and would do it again in a heartbeat. He eventually wound down, and Cabot cleared his throat.
This was bad. Harry suddenly thought of all the things that Ron might be upset about. He reined in a surge of panic. "Ron, look. I'm not queer or anything. I mean I know it's -- He was a
"You can't imagine." Harry was surprised at how rough his voice sounded. Draco, rather than tensing, relaxed. Harry could feel it in the grip around his fingers. "You're so gorgeous," he dared, adding more lube. He wasn't sure if it was to ease his hand out or just to move it more. "I want so much be in you. I'm afraid of going too fast when I start."
"But they bear reflection," Draco interjected. "You said that he is constrained by pride and blinded by hate."
Harry was sorry he'd said anything. He certainly didn't want to talk about Draco and Esmée with this serious senior Auror. "Don't worry about it," he said. "I don't really want to press charges."
The twins looked at each other, and it was George who spoke. "Sorry, Harry. You're right. Let Fred up, now, will you?"
are in charge of his parole, remember? Call Shacklebolt, tell him that you are concerned about Snape's recent behavior, and that you require the man to stay under your direct supervision for a month." Sighing, he leaned into his palm.  "Bully, my arse! You're inept at using advantages that are fully your right!"
"Don't worry about it," Zabini answered. "He was fun, but he doesn't matter to me much, in that way. I wish it had ended better, but not that it didn't end."
By the time he had read through his Transfiguration chapter, he wasn't sure Millicent would show up, but she rushed in the door just as he was packing up to move to the mixed-house room.
Harry didn't get an immediate answer from Ron, but when he related the conversation to Draco, they decided to start the base potion for divination. Harry thought wryly that between this and Millicent, he was going to spend all weekend brewing.
"Harry." She was holding the paper to her chest, as if trying to hide it from him. "I think you need to see this."
"Look," Harry said, moving in, "it was between us, we talked it out, and you can all drop it now, okay?" He turned to Dean. "I can't invite you to this particular conference, because of other people involved, but you can absolutely know what it was about. Catch me in the dormitory before dinner, and I'll explain."
"Oh, there you are," Potter said. "Run down to the school stores and get me some Fairy cocoon silk, will you? We don't have nearly enough."
Draco led Pansy's group out the second-floor door, and the others followed. In the corridor, they parted, Harry, Hermione, and Gilbert heading north to tell their backup team that they were safe, and Pansy's group -- with Draco -- moving south towards the stairs.
"Lovely." Her teasing smile gave her a momentary resemblance to her unacknowledged niece. "As I understand matters, formality would be
he was protecting me, and looking back on it, considering what he knew, what he did was very brave." He was admitting that to himself, for the first time, as much as to them. Snape had known he was facing an unmedicated werewolf and a man who had carelessly nearly killed him as a boy, and he had thought he was facing a mass murderer. That wasn't just vainglory, or hatred of Sirius -- he must initially have been moved as much by the need to protect three students from what he feared himself. "It's just that he wouldn't
“Until you are moving normally, young man. I don’t want to see you back here with injuries from an avoidable fall.” She handed him a glass of water. “Drink half of this, and wait,” she said, bustling away.
Snape snorted. "I am perfectly capable of carrying a bag of berries, Potter. You need not bear the load beyond the Entrance Hall."
"They might improve," Harry offered. "They've been more open about attacks since they admitted Nott escaped."
Harry sucked at his lower lip. Eugene moved behind him, settling hands on his hips. "Tell him how beautiful he is."
"For kissing a man?" Draco demanded sharply. He was surprised to find himself indignant. It was an unsuitable reaction, but he could not contain it. Although they had never discussed the matter, he had always imagined that Snape's tastes ran along similar lines.
"No." She leaned back against the buffet shelf.  "Something about you having 'five times the chance' to kill Tom Riddle that Sirius would?"
"Actually, I was the one with a question, sir," Harry ventured. Snape's eyes flicked back to Draco, and then narrowed. Draco gazed over at the bookshelves, as if he hadn't noticed. Awkwardly, Harry pressed on, pulling the bottle of potion from his bag.
"Shh!" Draco's hand covered Harry's mouth, and Harry realized he must have heard something. That was disappointing; there were better reasons, Harry thought, to be in this position. After several seconds of nothing happening, Draco began to relax. Harry stretched his tongue out and dragged the tip of it against Draco's palm. With a strangled sound, Draco stepped back.  "My mistake," he said coolly, his expression haughty. Harry, who could recognize that as discomfiture, tried to repress a smile.
"Er, yes," Harry said, suddenly wishing he had done this somewhere else than their secret gathering room. "But before that, I wanted to know -- if I have you do something for me, can you not tell Dumbledore about it? I mean, would you be willing not to, and not have to punish yourself?"
"Hi, Neville! Come in." Harry shifted over in invitation, and Neville came in and sat beside him. Harry tried to pretend he wasn't flushed. "Have a good summer?"
"What!" Harry yelped.  His face was burning again. "Are you punishing me for something you say I didn't do?" he asked shakily.
"So, Harry," he began. His voice was carefully neutral, and Harry tensed, expecting an attack about Draco. "One of the Slytherins came by our carriage, can you believe that? Didn't even try to pick a fight. He was asking about you."
Draco dared an outward glance to Harry, which might have been good, had the mouse’s entrails not begun to curl along the stone floor. Jonathan ran from the room, his near silent footsteps changed to a clatter as he reached the door. In the unnatural silence around them, everyone could hear him retching in the corridor. More innards than Harry would think could fit in a mouse were now twisting and breaking into words.
Quite suddenly, she was crying, and after a moment of ineffectively fluttering his hands near her hair, Harry steeled himself to set his arms around her. It didn't stop the tears, but she laid her head against his shoulder, and if his shirt was getting wet, that at least meant she still felt safe with him this way.
Unfortunately, that made it Ron's turn, and he was still glowering. Twice, he looked deliberately between Parvati and Harry, and then his chin lowered in a way that Harry was far too familiar with.
He closed his eyes for a moment as she stepped away, then swallowed and focused on her. The band in the gallery was just finished up a tune, with a wild sweep of strings. "Miss Hanley," he said politely, extending his hand for hers as he bowed. "May I have this dance?"
"I...." Harry didn't like the idea. "No," he said. "I don't want to be carrying it in the halls, and I brought it for here, anyway. Let's stop at the kitchens for butterbeer and cakes."
"Yeah, well, Snape got tired of me." Harry crossed to the case of wine and pulled out a bottle. "Which of these do you think I'd like better?"
By now, Harry would usually have turned to directly face Cornelia, ignoring the lower-years. Instead, he watched Sajid roll his eyes.
Scowling, Harry kicked the leg of the sofa. It hurt his toe. "Let's talk about something else," he said, plopping down on the cushions. "How are your glamours doing? You don't have one, at the moment."
"That's enough!" Harry exclaimed, stepping between them. Draco, still on the sofa, had sprawled his legs out while crossing his arms over his chest. Snape had drawn up into a narrow tower of black. "Professor, you're supposed to be mature," Harry snapped out, before turning his glower on Draco. "And
"Oh, I'm quite aware of that," Draco said, smiling at Harry. "Still, I can hardly help it if some of your attitudes continue to amuse me."
Late that night, Harry got to the Chamber of Secrets and found it empty. That wasn't unexpected -- Draco often had to stay up later than Harry to duck out unseen -- but it was unwelcome. After pacing the length of the cavern several times, he finally settled down on the furry sofa, choosing the green end for a change. While waiting there, he wrote a reply to Remus. It took him half a dozen tries, but he thought the final version was clear.
"I see." She studied him for a moment, and then, tapping the letters into a neat stack, put them aside.  "So, tell me about this mixed-house experiment. Has it enhanced your education in any way?"
He and Ron both sniggered and Harry made his voice go girlish. "But my robes were splashed in Herbology! You can't expect me to attend class in
He could tell from her ragged laugh that he'd said something absurd. She caught it quickly, covering with the same polite smile she had used when explaining to Draco that you could call someone you hadn't previously met on a telephone, so they were more like grates on the Floo network than like message charms. "A Muggle your age would know I was talking about a--" she paused. "A latex covering for your -- well, his -- penis."
Snape hesitated. He hadn't known, perhaps. He recovered, pursing his lips before speaking. "You were arrogant enough to believe him."
“Good morning,” Draco said blandly, as Harry caught up to him, as if they had not walked up from the dungeon together half an hour earlier.
Snape's eyes narrowed. "I did not say your decision was incorrect, nor indicate that I might attempt to override it. I said that I
"He really will do his best, Harry," Hermione said, dabbing at his face. He was crying. He hadn't known. "Can you stand?"
"Did you?"  Dumbledore's mouth quirked in a brief smile. "I must say, I'm somewhat surprised. Perhaps you are gaining some control over your impetuous nature, at last." He sat forward, and poured Harry a cup of tea. "Very well. If I hear no complaints as to your behavior, I will not interfere. But I do
"I was doing something with Godric Gryffindor's sword, and I swung it at a tree and wished I'd never heard of Horcruxes. And this nymph or something came out of the tree, and she didn't make me forget them, but I think she sent me into the life of someone who didn't know about them."
"I was telling a story!" Harry protested. "I mean, yes, I got carried away -- I realized as soon as a saw it there -- but it was something that happened! They need to know what he's like!"
Several people laughed at that, with tones ranging from derision to sympathy. Harry shrugged. "Anyway, I didn't know what it was until later, and I didn't see it until Ron and I went after Ginny, and we managed to -- well, I managed to -- find the Chamber of Secrets. The person who'd opened the Chamber was down there, and he set the basilisk on me."
"Well, I suppose it's my turn," she said brightly, already reaching for the beads. "So -- I've never wanted to submit my research for publication."
"Yes, you were upset from the game, yes, you hadn't eaten, yes, you'd been drinking -- not that that's in any way an excuse -- but no, you
Draco stopped short, and looked back at their group. "This," he said, "is ridiculous. Eight people?"
Millicent grabbed his arm, panic widening her eyes. Belatedly, he processed the sound from a second earlier -- the scrape of someone opening the trapdoor without raising it far enough.
." Each school split, clashed, and merged again, and Ron laughed and flashed a two-fingered salute at Draco. "Harry's right. Pure doesn't matter; fresh does." He snarled at the bowl. "So his Dad and Mum can rest in peace, you arse."
"I suppose you cannot drink the brew, either?"  Snape said sourly, suspiciously raising the knitted tea cozy to peer at the teapot underneath. From the rest of the decor, Harry expected English porcelain, but instead, it was a beautiful Chinese pot, ornamented with a coiled dragon. Ignoring Snape's disapproval, he lifted it and poured for both of them. As if this ended introductions, the witch turned her chair towards the table, and the grey cat leapt into the remaining chair and sat there, looking curiously at Harry.
In another context, that could have been flirtatious, he realized belatedly, as Millicent smirked, but did not laugh.
with breasts and no hint of a cock beneath small knickers. Correcting that part didn't help. His blood boiled every time he imagined those familiar hands undoing the buttons at Malfoy's collar.
"Seventeen," Ron corrected, missing the insult.  "They look soft. And those dark curls." He whipped around to Harry, suddenly alarmed. "It's still winter, right?"
"Oh, god, yes," Harry sighed, leaning his head back to let him at it. Every mark Draco left was a tacit forgiveness. If he still wanted Harry enough to claim him this way, then surely they would be all right. He squirmed back, pulling Draco down on top of him. To his relief and excitement, Draco began immediately to rut against him.
The words spilled out of him before he could edit. The Veritaserum didn't just keep him from lying -- it was more like each question caused an itch that only eased when he provided information.
"I suppose." Harry couldn't help thinking that was yet another Parselmouth trick. He might be able to sway a basilisk now. "I suspect he just didn't know much yet. He was only sixteen."
"Hi," he said uncertainly, to none of them in particular. Immediately, Ron came to his feet and turned his back on him. As Ron was heading up the stairs, and Seamus lifting his arms in a helpless shrug, Hermione thumped her book down on a pile of larger books and stalked towards him.
Harry plopped down next to her, making the mattress bounce. "I think both of you should ignore your mothers."
Draco stepped aside. He hoped his cheeks weren't as red as they felt. Of course Potter was here as a customer.
Draco looked absently past him, at the light of the window. "I know you were under a lot of pressure from your friends not to."
Hermione sighed. "If this is telling you anything -- and I have my doubts about that -- if it is, I still think you are asking the wrong question."
"Potter?" Despite the alarm in his first response, his voice rose with guarded hope, and he stumbled to his feet, still holding his blanket tightly around his shoulders.
"It needs to be considered," Gilbert said boldly. "But it was clearly a bad idea." Blaise nodded at him.
"Yes. In its purest form. You focus Dark energies into a physical push. The end result, reputedly, is that of a particularly violent Disarming hex."
Although Draco conversed naturally with Hermione, he studied her while she was looking at her book, and Harry imagined he could feel those eyes on him, as well, whenever he turned away. He pulled the white notebook out of his bag and opened it to the first blank page.
"Which are still," Harry persisted, moving the subject back to safer quarters, "a quarter the weight of a cow, I'd estimate."
"Thought we'd tag along," Blaise said coolly, falling into step with the group. "Just in case you had something suicidal in mind."
Her eyes narrowed, but that was better than her previous wide-eyed distress. "But a Disarmament charm should have--"
Draco pulled the bowl closer. He stroked it almost lovingly, and Harry saw Ron roll his eyes. Ron's derision changed to amazement as Draco drew his wand and repeated the strokes, coaxing the base to spread out toward his touch. As he started to turn it, Ron reached a hand.
"I have given some thought," he said over his shoulder, as he moved swiftly down a narrow path, "to guarding your safety during the event."
"Of course it does!" Malfoy said indignantly. "I'm just ... not sure it will listen if the command comes from the cave. I didn't actually implement that part...."
He turned and looked. Her eyes were starting to fill, tears pooling on the rim of the lids. He leaned forward and kissed at the edge of one eye, getting a mild shove in the chest for his trouble, just as he tasted salt.
Draco smiled. Harry knew this one was spontaneous, although he was not sure how. Something about the rest of Draco's face, or the angle of his head. "They can take care of themselves, for the most part. I see that they don't get too lonely or bored -- or I try to. They've been here longer than they should be, really."
He stopped, his arms crossed over his chest, waiting. Reluctantly, Harry considered this. "You think she wants to believe me?"
"The monster," Harry explained. "When those people were paralyzed and Ginny Weasley was kidnapped? It was a basilisk that Salazar Slytherin had hidden deep in the school. Someone let it out, and it traveled through the walls next to the plumbing. I could hear it hissing
"She wanted to skip out," Cornelia announced, plopping down in the chair nearest Ginny. "I told her no chance."
Susara moved slightly, reminding him that the snake might disturb his godfather, and with a soft hiss, he greeted her. As one, the twins stiffened, causing the charmed shelf they were lifting up along the wall to attach itself at the wrong height.
He took Draco across a narrow gap of bare floor, and then to another carpet, and from there around the sofa in front of the small side-hearth. There, he knelt in front of Draco and released the belt, enlarging the loop and pulling it off him. He stroked a hand up Draco's chest, guiding him up, and then kissed him, lingering over the warmth of his mouth and reminding him who they were.  Finally, he pulled away, and stood.
"Well, first...."  Sirius looked rather lost. "Er, you thought I might be upset that you kissed a boy?"
The thought of losing Ron for another week or more was hardly to be borne. With each step, Harry felt more weighed down by the thought. Was Ron still upset with him about the game? Even Draco felt he had the right to be, Harry recalled. What had he said?
"True," Harry allowed, watching Ron's animated explanation to his sister, over by the windows, "but he wasn't, really."
"What's wrong with what I have on?" Harry thought his robes from the trial would do for any good restaurant, but Draco shook his head.
"Thank you, sir!" Creevy said brightly. He held out an open book to Harry. "Second entry, left page."
"It's not much," Harry said. "But there haven't been any problems, and we're hoping he'll expand it."
"Actually, that might be a problem in class, too. I think I'm going to make you an inch taller this week, okay?"
"What is it?" Harry asked. He hadn't yet had a chance to talk to Draco about how last night's visit with Snape had gone.
"What, that the majority of my ancestors would consider me a traitor to my line, for my current associations and alliances? I rather do, yes. However, I do not believe they would be
A group of passing Hufflepuffs shot them surreptitious glances as Draco rolled his eyes. "Harry! I am taking care of creatures that
Christmas present for someone I know," he said smugly. Slowly, he stroked his wand down the front of his gloved fingers, watching Harry like a hawk. Furious, Harry stood, fists clenched at his sides. Was Snape petrified like Draco, somewhere in maze of garden paths? Or creeping closer, lining up a shot? Or had he missed them leaving?
Millicent looked at herself in the mirror, stuck out her tongue at her reflection, and then turned her back on it. "Fine," she said. "Let's go."
Harry looked at Draco and found his face set in haughty blankness, which was never a good sign. "Not something I want to talk about," he answered, but Draco sighed and rolled his eyes.
Ron glanced at Hermione and didn't ask again. Harry decided they could talk on Sunday, when they had another divination attempt scheduled.
"Yes. My grate has unusual protections. However, this is not the time to discuss them. I am afraid our effort to guard your aunt has failed, at least temporarily."
you've learned." She picked up her own notes -- parchment cut to different lengths -- and tapped them even at the bottom, but did not look at them.
In front of him, Remus stopped. Harry craned his neck to peer over the man's shoulder, until Remus turned, giving him a chance to see. Figures in Auror robes -- at least five of them -- clustered around the gate, which had something stuck on top of one of the spikes. Another Auror stood to one side, wand out.
For a moment, the only response was silent stares. Damian recovered first. "So what is first?" he asked. "Malfoy?"
“A hospital cot? With wheels?” Harry couldn’t image transfiguring anything that complicated, certainly not on the spur of the moment.
"Of course I would!" Draco's chair lurched forward as he tried to stand, and then teetered dangerously. "Let me go!"
He didn't get to finish the sentence. If regular Apparation was like being squeezed through a hose, House Elf Apparation was like becoming part of a waterfall. After a moment's glorious arc, he found himself standing outside the doors of the Great Hall, with Dobby just letting go of his wrist. Before he could open his mouth, Dobby was gone again. He returned a moment later with Hermione and Draco.
Harry wondered briefly if Eugene still liked boys. How did that work, exactly? He shrugged the thought off. "Maybe not. I mean, she -- he --
"There's always extra," he assured her. "Draco is too trained a host to let the food run out. And I expect
"Much better," Harry stated, and he stroked his hand gently over Draco's arse. A quick lift for lube and he did it again, this time drawing his slicked thumb down Draco's crack.
Oh. That had been mostly on Pansy's behalf. Harry felt his face heat. "Er, yeah. I wasn't expecting the response in person, though."
"My Muggle relatives. They were very insistent that I believe that magic doesn't exist. It made a lot of things far more confusing than they needed to be. But when it wasn't accidental -- I knew it when I saw it."
"What Harry means, sir," Draco said crisply, "is that we require your expertise to evaluate the risk posed by an attack."
"What do you need to know?" Snape countered. "There are thousands of spells that will never be mentioned to you at school. The Praetermissius Charm is one you would find useful. You cast it on yourself to go unnoticed. It does not make you invisible, and will not guard you against people who are seeking you, specifically, but someone who sees you pass will not notice you are Harry Potter. It is good for hiding in crowds."
Harry tried to pull information out of that sideways expression of something. Had Mrs. Weasley not wanted to stay with Ron's dad? A sudden idea made him wince. "Did she, er, have to marry Mr. Weasley?"
Draco nodded, but didn't say anything. Harry sighed. "You're more social than I am. I wouldn't mind as much."
"So it was like the Imperius curse imbedded in a book?" Gilbert asked. "I didn't think you could do that."
"I mean --" Julian finally stepped fully into the chamber. He turned slowly in a full circle, looking at the walls, with their banners and riotous cascades of ivy. "This is stunning."
there, right? You and I--" Harry gestured to make it clear that he meant the two of them, specifically, "-- the ones sitting right here -- we must have something to offer each other."
"Excellent," Dumbledore replied, as if everyone had been cheerful about the arrangements. In the hallway, he briefly laid a hand on Harry's shoulder. "I appreciate your maturity and cooperation, Harry. I know that your Aunt's house is not your first choice of dwelling place."
be seen; fifteen was too young for true subtlety -- and then polyjuice into Thornton to follow Potter himself, while Thornton tailed Creevy. It was terribly clever. Draco sighed. Most likely, the entire exercise would be wasted on the Gryffindors. They had all the subtlety of a bludger. And there was unlikely to be any point to tailing Potter, as Thornton had so irritatingly noted.
Remus shifted his teacup and cleared his throat slightly. When Harry looked at him, he raised his eyebrows and smiled mischievously at him. "I gather we haven't been
"Hardly," Draco said dryly. "She scolded me for unilateral possessiveness and lack of manners and subtlety, and said I absolutely wouldn't do for marriage. I told her the last judgment was mutual."
"How comfortable the two of you are with each other. You started out so much further apart than Ron and I did. How do you manage it?"
While Harry hung the banners at quarter points on the wall of the round chamber, Draco coaxed little shelves out of it in places.  They emerged from the walls in a small curve at the level of his waist, growing up at an angle out to take the form of thick, shallow half-bowls at chest height. Finishing with the Hufflepuff banner, Harry turned to watch as Draco filled the depression in his last one with water, set two ivy cuttings in it, and charmed them to grow until they cascaded down the wall in a fall of green.
Auror Tonks hesitated, but then gave a brief nod. "Under the circumstances, I could wait in the next room."
"Technically," Harry answered, speaking evenly to not jar his head, "faking out your opponent is not cheating. Seekers do false dives all the time. I have."
"What would you care?" Draco asked, sitting up more properly. "Mother says too much courtesy makes you uncomfortable, anyway, as --" he stopped with awkward suddenness.
Or he tried to. He felt the warning tingle of magic -- through his hand from the chair's arm -- an instant too late, when his weight was already back off his heels. The seat of the chair met his descent, and pushed him forward and down. He twisted enough to narrowly avoid the table, and set out his hand to protect Susara, who was tightening around his arm. His hand and hip, and then elbow, hit the inlayed wood of the floor hard, but he could feel his pet, alarmed but safe, tighten around his triceps.
He straightened. “I must talk to the headmaster. I would like one of you to stay with him, but the others should go back to lessons.”
The professor looked startled by the suggestion. He considered it. "That would be a large amount of time to give to a single student."
About to argue, Harry realized that he was commenting on the narrow windows. "Yeah," he said. "These look like arrow slits that someone stuck glass in."
"All right!" Harry said quickly. "Enough of that." He opened a butterbeer and cast a quick warming charm on it. "Ron?"
Harry shrugged. "He went into Fiona's Fripperies to look for something for his cousins." He didn't mention that Draco had ducked into the shop once they had spotted Blaise alone. "Actually, I'm glad I ran into you. Can we talk for a minute?"
"Not what I had in mind, Miss Granger," Blaise said, and with that, deftly levitated the fruit from two more tarts onto her plate.
Harry hadn't expected that. Shouldn't the dragon take him to the ground?  But the Contrivance was definitely ascending, and heading off the pitch, its speed increasing with each flap of its wings. Malfoy had changed his uniform back to green, but that made no difference to it now.
"That is," Seamus added, shrugging, "not more money than it took to buy a sackful of sweets to share, but what else would we have bought at that age?"
"All right," Cornelia interrupted. "Here's mine: I've never wanted to ask a Quidditch opponent for pointers."
"No, not yet. Want a mirror?" As in London, he cast a reflection charm so she could see herself. While she studied that, he studied her.
," he said finally, his hands lifting almost to his shoulders. "Yes, I know that's a stupid answer; give me a moment." He took a breath, his chest visibly swelling and falling. Above them, the musicians were tuning strings and tooting on things Harry couldn't name. "Disparagement of one should not be requisite to respect for the other," he murmured, as formally as a barrister, but very softly. "Yes. An effective angle. Thank you, Harry."
Sighing, Draco rested his forehead on his fingers. "How 'on' our dear friend was for this morning's tests?"
Malfoy responded with another moan. While Harry wondered if this was actually favorable, or perhaps despairing, Malfoy began to push at his shoulders.
"Mm." Remus folded his hands on the tabletop in front of him. "And what if something happens to you? Will anyone know to raise the alarm?"
"Since a few days after the portkey attempt."  Snape scowled. "Do not feel you are being persecuted, Potter. The headmaster is more concerned with the potential for kidnapping than rulebreaking."
Up in the eighth-year boys' dormitory, Harry sank down onto the chair from his desk, and Creevy perched tailor-style on the end of Ron's bed.
Harry laughed. "That's why I liked Muggle London. I got to be nobody, and just kick around. Then I could come back."
, actually. But I hoped that Draco would know where he was." She advanced on Harry. "Auror Shacklebolt spoke to me
The Gryffindors, despite the warning, had a harder time tracking a team in all different colors, and the Slytherins quickly racked up forty points. When Gryffindor adjusted and started to score again, Malfoy raised his arm and shouted. On the ground, Pansy Parkinson released the tarp.
, just not what was damaged. I just woke up a few minutes ago, and the bit when I got here is fuzzy. Madam Pomfrey said something about organs, I think."
After a long sigh, Remus nodded. "True. Though he is starting to recover emotionally. If he could be cleared--"
Malfoy leaned back against the wall, evaluating Harry.  "Voldemort? Oh, this would be that Quibbler interview?"
Draco lowered his chin in a curt nod. "A matter I understand far better than your Irish friend, I believe.
Draco's mouth twitched, but his voice, when he spoke, was hard. "The Ministry took from us, Auror Potter. Dignity, a home, a livelihood, a life. What do you give?"
"Weasley is such a vulgar excuse for a wizard," Malfoy drawled. He nudged Harry. "Though I admit it is rather darling the way he protects the Mudblood -- like a six-year-old with a pet beetle."
Their eyes met. If it had just occurred to her, as to him, that his participation here might be even more inadvisable than venturing outside, she didn’t say so, just coughed slightly and smiled. “But I’m sure we can handle it with Professor Hecksban here.”
His restraint seemed to have accomplished something, however. When he said goodnight, several of the Slytherins nodded at him in a possibly friendly manner.
"Better," Snape allowed. He ran a finger along the spine of the book. "And do you wish to learn it?"
Neville, indeed, seemed to be racking his brains for something innocuous. "I've never pretended to be sick to stay home from a party," he said, and promptly took a bead, turning it bright pink, with a white spiral.
Harry wandered within those walls, too shaken to choose a destination. He wanted Draco to hold him, or Hermione to be comforting, or Ron to make a joke ... maybe not that one. Eventually, he found himself outside a familiar door. He could visit the Quiris -- if what he had done with the curse on the chair had not contaminated him. He didn't think it had.
“Oh no.” Harry pulled Draco close, holding him while he shook, and feeling the slow spread of tears on his shoulder. “You’re safe,” he said, although he knew that wasn’t true. “Safe from him.” That was.
"Okay." Harry shifted uneasily. "Er, last spring, Draco and I discussed something with the headmaster."
"Very good." With a whispered charm, Harry Summoned a pair of cuffs down to the middle of the bar. He took one and stroked the thick lamb's fleece that lined it against the inside of Snape's wrist. "Soft, isn't it?" he murmured against Snape's ear -- God, why couldn't the man wash adequately? -- but then stepped back. "Remove your robes and shirt."
With a contemptuous flick of her tail, Susara went up his arm, this time setting possessively around the back of his neck. Harry stroked her and chuckled at the sight of Dean similarly soothing his rat.
"The one more likely to be harmed, of course," Severus replied coldly. "Don't you think I've considered the possibility of an attack for distraction? Harry has done quite well in Apparation, and --"
The Uncommon Room filled up early on Friday. All the Hufflepuffs and half the Gryffindors had arrived before Draco had finished arranging the food. Harry thought everyone must be eager to talk about their holidays -- or eager to be back with friends.
Harry shrugged. "At the time, I wasn't sure. But there were two things." He and Draco had discussed this afterwards.  "First, he sent
"Nearly a disaster, actually," Harry replied cheerfully. "Inquisitor Cabot gave me stronger Veritaserum than what Tonks had planned on, and her idiot partner started asking me unauthorized questions, so she stunned me, and then she and Kingsley -- her boss, I think; he was at the trial -- kept me until I was in control of my mouth again. That's why it took so long."
The crackle of tension eased at that. Draco rummaged in his bag. Hermione conjured some water for Ron, who had quieted, before darting back to Draco's promised notes. After a few sips, Ron rolled onto his back, and Harry sat down, still in reach.
"Especially ones with a fifteen Galleon price tag, offered for free," Fred agreed. He summoned three mismatched glasses from the kitchen. With a snort, Harry turned them into snifters.
The big black dog had set its feet stubbornly wide, to be hard to shift. Harry bent down to his ear.
"Oh!" Draco smiled, one of those rare, open smiles that made Harry's heart spin. "Hoping to make good on your little lie?" he teased.
While the new defendant spoke, there was nothing to do but listen. Harry had no personal knowledge of Talbot, so he didn't even have indignation to bring him energy. The man insisted that he had been coerced through threats against his family, and Harry found himself wondering if that was true, at least in part. Certainly Voldemort would do such a thing, but would anyone who needed that level of coercion be summoned by him directly, to something like an initiation? Harry remembered Draco, when they first spotted Bellatrix, referring to the Death Eaters as an 'inner circle'. Talbot talked about Lucius casting the portkey trace -- they certainly had no compunction about throwing him to the wolves now -- and Harry mentally placed the question of Death Eater status on his list of things to ask Snape about in September.
"Oi!" called out a voice, as he set his foot on the train steps. "You sir! Students only!"  Bustling into conversational range, Ernie Macmillan returned to his usual self-important tone. "Regulations, my good man, you understand -- for the children's safety."
was interesting. It wasn't at all the sort of information Draco had hoped for, but if that was all he got, the ruse was still worthwhile. Potter had actually meant all those odd smiles as friendly?
Ron, who had pulled his lip tight under his teeth at the mention of drawing blood, slowly relaxed and nodded.
Shacklebolt shrugged. "I happened to be here on other business. A direct meeting seemed easiest, considering your second request."
"More lube." He wasn't sure how long they had been at this. Draco was near to growling with frustration.
"No, in Diagon Alley, both doing our first Hogwarts shopping. I was in Madam Malkin's when Professor Flitwick -- he was escorting you -- brought you in. You clearly weren't his child, so I said hello, and introduced myself. When I heard your name, I was terribly excited, as you might imagine. I said I hadn't been sure you'd be at Hogwarts, and you said you hadn't heard of it until that morning. I was shocked, of course! I mean, I knew your parents had been a witch and a wizard, and then you explained about your aunt and uncle." Draco, who had been leaning forward, his face alight with remembered excitement, sat back.
"Oh, sure." Belatedly, Harry thought to look at Draco, who appeared alarmed at the idea. "Um, you know he's my, um, boyfriend, right?"
Seamus nodded. "One where a couple of seventh years heartily agreed, I think. No explanations needed. Grief is a tricky bog."
Snape, Harry thought, had a lot of gall to give him that advice -- but then, perhaps it came from mistakes made. "I'll try," he said, managing not to sigh. "Do we have time to talk about Death Eaters?"
"The question focused her divination," Draco said clearly. "From there, her answer could extend, if the nature of the question showed her paths."
They hadn't seen any empty compartments by the time they reached one that Harry considered to be as good -- the sole occupant was Millicent Bulstrode. He caught Zabini's arm. "Bulstrode okay with you?"  he asked.
"Um, wha--" With a visible shake, Ron looked away. Without comment, Draco lowered the vial so it was obscured by the shadows from the folds of his robes. "Um, yeah," Ron said. "Go on."
Ron's hair may have been hard to spot, but somehow Harry noticed Malfoy's immediately. Maybe it was the walk, he thought. Malfoy usually moved with a cocky saunter, but right now, he was moving in an even glide, like Snape trying to sneak up on someone, in the shadow of the outer hedge. Making a quick decision, Harry swerved off the path and behind a bush, and donned his invisibility cloak.
As he walked back into the boys' dormitories, Millicent moved forward, shielding Harry from Nott as if by accident. He suspected otherwise. As a Beater, she knew all about interference.
Whilst Harry was still dizzy with that, Professor Dumbledore poured tea -- first for Harry, then for himself -- and set a quilted cozy over the pot. "You will recall," he said, adding two cubes of sugar to his own cup, "our previous discussion, the last time we sat in this spot?"
Harry had ended it there. Again, the scene shifted, bent, and swept past in fragments, and then they were later in the same evening. He hadn't gone all the way back to Blaise's knowing taunt. It was Seymour the Not-Frog who leaned forward.
"Just in case." He held to the cup carefully to the side while they leaned together. Harry's lips were soft, and his cheek slightly rough. His tongue played along Draco's, promising more. When they parted, they were breathless.
It took some time for the tense atmosphere in the room to fade, but by the time dinner was over, the three of them were talking comfortably. Snape mentioned a recent visit with Narcissa -- in the neutral territory of a London restaurant -- and said that she claimed to be making progress in securing the grounds, and Draco replied that he would like to go home for a few days of the Christmas holiday, but let Snape sidestep the issue.  They had a second, smaller glass of wine apiece, finishing the carafe, and Harry left the two of them talking about Malfoy Manor, and arrived at Gryffindor feeling content with their plans.
Again, Harry kissed the back of his neck, but gently this time. "You can be so vulgar when you're being cruel. You need to learn to do it when you're nice."
“Understandable.” Draco had stepped over towards them, and Blaise was watching across his parchment, as if this was fascinating. “However, one can take the N.E.W.T. without the class, with the support of a faculty sponsor. I intend to do.”
!  I mean, he seems to actually trust her now, and there aren't a lot of people he trusts, I'm sure."
"Of course," Draco said promptly. "The headmaster has forbidden me to have them out in public, but they are not a secret."
His voice trailed off, dismay spreading across his face.  His shoulders hunched. From what Harry had seen of Voldemort's means of amusement, he expected that Ron was unprepared for whatever he was seeing.
"Or I will. Yes." Draco frowned. "Perhaps Hermione could help, if she didn't have to touch anything."
"Sorry," Harry said to his listeners. "I hadn't meant to lapse into Parseltongue, and I rather scared her, I think.  Anyway, I'd hear this voice in the wall saying --" he concentrated on forming the words in English -- "'kill' and 'blood' and things about how hungry it was, and a couple of times I followed it, and ended up somewhere right after an attack--"
"This was my father's pensieve," he said.  "It always had some protections on it, as did other items that I was not to use unsupervised. However, sometime after my... defection, and before his trial, he appears to have set much stronger and more aggressive protections -- true curses -- on a few things of value. I believe he anticipated that these items might be confiscated by the Ministry." Draco hesitated. "However, it is also possible that he considered the prospect of a conviction, and, in that unlikely event, that I might inherit that which he felt I did not deserve."
"Oh, we found lots!" Behind the exclamation, Harry was already deciding to get the names and formulas of the potions Snape had chosen and look them up before taking them. He might get along with the Potions master now, but he certainly didn't want any sort of lasting bond with the man.
Harry was too disturbed at the thought of channeling Voldemort's power to speculate. Numbly, he shook his head.
"All right." Draco curled to kiss his forehead.  "I'll trust that you know your own. Now, which would you rather -- supper, or me in bed?'
"What? If you saw him gathering henbane on the first of May? He's got to be! And he'd hate it if the whole school --"
Zabini walked directly to Nimue Close. He opened the wrought iron gate at the front and stepped inside. Harry had to move quickly to get inside with him, and he was pulling in his breath to fit past Zabini in the narrow way.
"Thank you." Harry hesitated. "The odd thing is -- she never collected. It wasn't until you sent her with a message for me that I reminded her that I owed her some tutoring."
Harry had been on the receiving end of this often enough to know what helped, and he'd a couple of fingers up Draco's arse more than once, so they weren't starting from nothing. Still, considering how long as Draco had put this off, he was resolved to make his first time brilliant. He wasn't sure why Draco wanted this now, but he
They apparated to a windswept field that overlooked the ocean far below. Curls of white speckled the grey water, and Harry's robes whipped about his calves. He felt a spiral slide up his arm as Susara moved further from the draught of his jacket cuff.
"I know. Everyone knows." Finch-Fletchley glared at Harry. "But you're not the only Slytherin I see him with."
They found Draco sitting with his feet up on the table next to the bottle of cognac, and his arms crossed over his chest.
"Oh, I doubt many of them will show up. Anyone attending will need to give up their evening as well."
"True. So where do I come into this? Do you have specific questions about identifying these curses?"
Draco sighed. “If you will recall, Professor Hecksban said that if they had a potion and curse that could extend the physical damage they are causing to your aunt, it would start within the first hour. Your legs are still unmarked, so they are currently conveying only the pain.”
"Oh, right! You split up with some girl you were engaged to for that Quidditch player you'd been protecting, didn't you?"
"It depends on the snake," Harry said. "Susara -- my torclinde -- is sweet. A python I met in London Zoo was funny. Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk was
Harry's past self looked more unsettled than had he expected as he checked Draco's response and wasn't able to read it. "Not something I want to talk about," he answered. This time around, Draco's theatrical sigh reminded him of Narcissa.
going to regret it. That imperative held against the mounting urgency of more physical desire as Draco -- his face pink, and his eyes closed more often then not -- rocked into his hand. Harry was standing by the bed now, and had three fingers in, but they were squeezed almost painfully tight together by that hard ring of muscle.
The front bedroom in Stag's Run Lodge had always been their guest room, so there was little to do to prepare it for Snape. Draco added a few books to the shelf above the bed, cast a freshening charm on the unused bedclothes, and declared it ready. He ignored Harry's suggestion that they darken the window glass and turn the curtains and duvet black.
"Mm." Draco stretched his arms. "But again, there's that tan, in March. Do you know that in some states the time limit for prosecution for an attack on a human is shorter than that for an attack on livestock?"
"Voldemort is such a bastard," Harry said viciously. "He left the head here, with a letter for me, saying it was a
Harry did not quite run -- at least, not until he was out of sight around the first curve of the dungeon staircase. Then, he practically flew, using a hold on the inner rail to take great leaps down, whipping around the curves and touching one in every three or four steps. He nearly crashed at the first landing, which broke his rhythm and twisted his body over foot and ankle, causing a burst of pain. On the first dungeon level, he lurched down the hallway in a triple-speed limp. Grabbing the open door jamb, he swung himself around and into the office.
"Yes. She escaped." Draco shifted, settling an arm over Harry's chest. "And terrifying as that was, having you lying around like a doormat all night was no better. You let me beat you in a fight, you know. And you wouldn't mount me."
"More in the social sense than in academics," he said. "But yes. I mean, learning about people.  That's education too, right?"
"Good. Here it is, then," Harry said. "Much more than all this extra money, I would like a secure and secret place to stay from a few days before my birthday until school opens in September. This would be perfect. I'm willing to strike this item altogether in return for living -- unofficially -- in the shop during that time, with the two of you bringing me food when needed and keeping my location absolutely secret -- including from Dumbledore and members of your family, no matter how worried they might be."
Ginny giggled. "We're getting sidetracked," she said. "I don't mind if she's your friend; I just worried it might be something else."
Draco did not back down.  "Nature prepared their ancestors for narrow holds at height," he said. "Wizards and witches are a hazard of but a few generations. Mr.  Lupin -- your pardon, sir," he added with a nod -- "is a difficult case, even there -- not prone to
Draco hesitated. "Blindfold?" he said, not quite a request so much as a reminder of factors involved.
“Just … I was turning to talk to you, and suddenly it felt like something was slicing my legs into ribbons. They gave way, and I fell down the stairs, and people were shouting. I don’t remember any words; it was mostly just
Draco nodded, and then sighed. "Being friends with you holds more dangers than I ever thought I'd face."
Harry glanced at Draco before looking back at her. "We need to talk privately," he said. "My room. After that, I think we'll want an escort in Diagon Alley."
Snape nodded a polite acknowledge. "Just remember, Draco -- your ego is not well served by undermining the success of your house."
The words hit like a punch, and it took Harry a moment to catch his breath. "Gemma wasn't killed by anyone here," he said finally, keeping his voice even. "And we were
"He can't send too much against you," Ron commented. "That would take his wall. Don't think he knows what a bad idea this is. He thinks he weakened you, not himself." Ron sounded deeply satisfied. He was looking straight down into the bowl, his weight on his hands as if he would crawl over it. "Thinks he knows your weapons too. You're like your snake, though."
"So talk, Potter," she said, covering his whispered incantations as he renewed her glamours. "What did you so badly need to say?"
"Merlin!" Malfoy exclaimed. "We should talk to your father-- No, wait." For a moment, he just stood, bending back his fingers as he thought, while Harry wondered frantically who Malfoy meant.
Draco's nose wrinkled. "Why on earth would she blame you? But yes, Auror Shacklebolt said there will be a heavy Auror presence, considering. Mother would not hear of not attending." He looked idly out over the space below them. "I might send an owl to Tonks, on my own. She--" He tensed, his hand going to his wand. "Someone's -- Oh. It's McGonagall."
Ron's eyebrows scrunched down. "And you had a worse one? Mate, doesn't that strike you as a bit suspicious?"
After a moment's stiffness, Draco pressed close. "You licked me," he said, returning to things said before. "I remember wondering when you -- this wolf -- would bite."
At lunch time on May Day -- not the bank holiday, but the actually first of May -- Lavender was passing out little bags made of what appeared to be cheesecloth charmed green. They were filled with flower petals.
"It's always summer here," Draco said, his grip tight. Harry suspected it would be dangerous to let go. "You were wondering about family curses -- why they don't affect my mother.
"He was impersonating Thornton," Draco said quickly, trying to recapture some indignation. "With Polyjuice."
"It's Thorny Hedge," Draco said. "Wizards hide things in it. This one's been growing since my parents wed."
"Now, this is our protected hallway," Tom told him. "Dumbledore requested it for you, but I would have known, I wager, the times being what they are! Remember to carry your key, or you'll run afoul of the Confundus hex on the stairway. If you want anything brought up, the slate on the door copies to the kitchen, but I don't have extra servers, so you may need to wait." He nodded formally. "Will you be needing anything else, Mr. Potter?"
"This one," Draco said, "is the least Dark. The base potion is not Dark at all, and the components were fairly easy to procure. As the diviner, however, you would need to draw Harry's blood -- not much; a prick of the third finger should do -- and drip it into the base potion for the scrying."
Frowning, Dumbledore faced him squarely. "Did you threaten them? If so, I want it clear that I would not permit that because they are Slytherins."
Snape nodded. "Good. Now...." His cold look promised nothing good. "As to the tableau that greeted my arrival...."
“Not even to send you to St. Mungo’s, I’d think,” Ron put in. “Draco’s right; this is powerful. Nothing you showed us in lessons went above the two-thirds mark on intensity, and that was the one that for full-body boils.”
He looked utterly bewildered. Harry wondered if his counterpart was always up for it, or if, conversely, this was an unusual offer from Malfoy and one he was expected to jump at. For that matter, which end of the stick, as it were, was he expected to be on? A half-second's thought was enough to convince him that it didn't matter; he didn't want to attempt either with someone who didn't know it was his first time.
Harry shrugged. "It makes sense, if you're Muggle-raised. After all, if transfiguration was permanent, wizards and witches would have everything they wanted, right?"
"Yeah." Harry drew out a fraction of an inch and added more lube. "Take a long breath in. When you let it out, think of breathing out tension, so all your muscles relax as the air leaves you. It helps, really."  He watched Draco try that once. "Good. Now again." This time, as Draco exhaled, Harry pushed slowly forward, getting further in.
He led Draco into the living room, and Draco gave a little sigh of relief when he crossed onto the first carpet. Harry made a note to himself to check Draco's knees when they were done with this.
Harry grinned. "More or less what I was thinking," he admitted as he opened the door to the mirror. The low murmur of voices behind them vanished as Cornelia, the last through, shut it again.
"You damn well should be!"  Sirius exclaimed. "There'll be no more of that, now, understand me? Your dad would be horrified -- his own son using Unforgiveables!"
"Here," Harry said, "let me help." He stacked the books, heaviest and largest on the bottom, and then lifted off a manageable load, which was everything except one extra-wide atlas. She used that as a table for the parchment and quills, moving her inks to her school bag.
Eugene shrugged, but one of his hands hovered hesitantly before descending to comb once through Malfoy's sun-gold hair. "I think I might. I'm not sure it has anything to do with
Still sneering, Severus inclined his head. "Indeed. Perhaps her continued health indicates that our efforts to secure the property were successful. However, you must also consider that she may have been left unharmed to lure you in."
Draco kissed him then, desperately, and Harry concentrated on enjoying it. Their time as rivals was over, however unsatisfactorily it had ended. They let up when Millicent started to count out loud and Blaise to offer odds on when they'd stop, but they still stayed leaned close together, the edge of Harry's nose touching Draco's cheek.
Harry turned his head away. "Not really." He wasn't sure when that had changed. He didn't have a real plan yet.
"Well, Draco won't have been out, so it's for two."  Harry tried not to look embarrassed. "Okay. Maybe. But I need bribes too."
“Life to life is always easier,” he said, and began a complex incantation of transfiguration. The branch shorted and rounded before taking the form of a brown rabbit. The new creature barely had time to lift its head before Hecksban stunned it. Hermione gasped and Dumbledore sighed, running his hand once down the thick fur.
Draco hesitated. "If the person expects it ... well it would be bad for business to not pretend to want to as well. But mostly they don't."
Hiding stung in the aftermath of what Draco had said, but Harry saw the sense of it. He told himself he would leave without it, whatever Draco said then, and he pulled his cloak out of his school bag and swung it on.  Draco winced as he vanished.
"Good afternoon, Severus. Harry--" a glare at Harry accompanied the name -- "invited me to join him here."
"The eggs, though...." Blaise made a face. "There was a wave of food poisoning among children when I was eight that was traced to a doxy infestation in a candy kitchen. When the eggs get in food, they cause horrible vomiting. I didn't get it, but my brother did, and came home from Hogwarts for a few days, because the hospital wing was out of beds."
was fine, so I think we were sensible enough to be careful, but we did it when I had, you know, a bit of a stomach problem, and that apparently gave him an infection."
"Okay. I'll try to be more precise. But anyway, I don't really understand why you did it. I mean, wouldn't that be too long to wait? It turns out not to have been, I suppose, but I can't imagine putting that much effort to something that would kill him fifteen to twenty years from now. Isn't that like saying you'll live with it until then?"
Bulstrode walked silently down the street, her wrapped purchases clutched to her wide chest. She didn't say anything as she entered the Leaky Cauldron, and he whispered for her to wait while he spoke to Tom.  When they were in the back salon, and Harry slipped his cloak off, she remained silent, staring straight ahead like a soldier on review. Harry was still wondering how to begin when Tom appeared with a platter of cheeses, breads, sausage, and apples, and a pitcher of ale. Harry nodded, thanked him, and threw in an extra five galleons with his payment, hoping that was enough to keep the man silent, at least for the hour. Tom tugged respectfully at his cap and closed the door behind him when he left. Harry cast his own privacy charm at it.
Harry waved that off. "Another tale for another night, I think. Anyway, it was all rather horrible. At one point, I was holding the sword -- I'd just used it to destroy something -- and Hermione said something about Ron, and we understood, by then, why he'd left us, but knowing what had happened didn't fix anything, and I was
about Hufflepuff?" she challenged. "Don't you know? Let me guess -- this inter-house group is just Slytherins and Gryffindors."
"I wanted to ask him about the Uncommon Room -- about what Dumbledore had told the staff." It wasn't a lie; that was something he wanted to ask.
"Wait! Don't, um-- not completely round. Make the other side...." Ron motioned, curving the fingers of each hand in and bringing them together.
Harry grinned at the precise handwriting on the envelope.  "Remus," he said happily, thinking just as much of Sirius.
"Well, some of it could be." They started moving again, trying to stay ahead of the nearest cluster. "Everything but the security arrangements, almost."
"The only non-Slytherin of his line in over a century," Draco broke in. "Though, I should say 'first,' not only. My Aunt Andromeda's daughter was apparently a Hufflepuff, although as her mother had been disowned before she was born, one might say it doesn't count."
The thought reminded Harry of the ribbon tied around the handle of his flask. "Do you think Snape tried to poison me?"
"Hear, hear!" Seamus said heartily, and there was a chorus of agreement, while Susan, a finger against her chin, made a show of thinking.
Harry shrugged, trying not to look too eager as he reached for the thick envelope. "A couple of times a week, usually," he answered, and ignored their sniggers in favor of extracting the thick parchment.
Draco sounded a little surprised. He would ask later, Harry decided -- for now, he needed to move. He kept the first push slow, Draco's tight grip a torturous delight.
"Certainly," Draco said with a nod. He addressed the class. "As I explained, significant things in my father's office were routinely
"He would like you to believe those limitations, would he not?" Snape returned smugly. "But no. An attack would give you the
Harry looked up from his papers as Draco walked by, heading for the cellar stairs, and watched as Draco called down a dinner warning. Draco turned and caught his look.
"I had an invention of the twins'," Ginny explained. "A secret one that George gave me. There was no reason for Hermione and Ron to think that I could hear them. They had a silencing charm on the door; I slipped something under it, past the charm."
Harry grinned.  "Very," he said, answering the question intended. Then he thought about the previous year. "Not as much flying around as last time -- no Muggle shops -- but we kept ourselves entertained."
Harry moaned and started sucking on Draco's neck, which he supposed was response enough. Draco had a sexy voice, when he was in that mode.
Draco looked back and forth, and finally pointed to the bed. "Behind that," he said. "It would be the most convenient, anyway."
"Did I not tell you to SHUT IT?" Harry roared. Draco went flat on the mattress. Harry could tell he was chortling into his pillow, but from Severus's distance he must have looked alarmed. "Severus. You have an hour off. Go and sort exotic toenails or something. At the end of that, meet us in the kitchen. You may bring a cauldron to leave there."
come here on Midwinter Day, to see summer. I'm sorry. I didn't think of how it would sound until I was explaining." He took a quick breath and let it out slowly. "I can't."
"Our independent study," Harry answered. He glanced over at Draco. "Well, Draco did some shaping before that."
"What changed your mind?" Millicent demanded.  Harry could see, now, that she had been asking why she should trust him again.
"But that's no fun either!" Parvati objected. "Now I know that Harry's fallen asleep in the library, maybe I want to tease him about it. Isn't the point to be become better friends?"
"No. This is weird." Still, his eyes closed as Draco's long fingers stroked up and down his erection.
"Hm. She will want someplace private, but it needn't be secret. We'll find something. Perhaps it could be in Snape's office during your 'detention.'"
Harry blew out a breath as if they were truly running. "Yeah.  Well, at least I'll be showing up sober."
Harry wondered if that Sorting had anything to do with Gilbert's change of tune on Muggleborns. There were certainly a lot of those in Hufflepuff. "Hello, Gloria," he said, offering his hand to her as well. "Pleased to meet you."
"I don't think he's involved, okay? He's just connected to more people than he should be." Ignoring Hermione's doubtful look, Harry gathered the papers into a neat stack and locked it in a drawer of his desk. He might not be after Malfoy himself, but it wouldn't do to leave those out, not with the number of enemies the man had. "Let's go. I need to leave early enough to see Miranda before visiting hours are over."
Lunch with Weasleys was somewhat embarrassing. Harry could tell it was worse for Draco, who wasn't used to considering the twins' jibes in a friendly light. Fred and George had to rush back to work after a little while, however, and Harry, at least, belatedly appreciated how they had filled every awkward silence.
"Silly, literal Gryffindor," Draco answered. "All right. I didn't mean to bring you down, you know."
The move left them facing Narcissa. She was standing and watching them, wand down by her side, frost flowers abandoned behind her. Draco stumbled. Harry caught him. Quickly, Harry turned him back into a standard face to face hold and unembellished progressive steps. Draco could apparently do those backwards with his eyes squeezed shut.
"Krups?" Now it was Draco's turn to be confused.  "In a two-room flat?" His brain caught up, and flooded with relief.  He had been misreading everything. "Oh, is this some new gambling scandal?  I have no idea, Potter. He doesn't talk business with me."
During the walk, Harry began to feel slightly embarrassed about his response. It hadn't been wrong, exactly, but it had been out of proportion. While Dumbledore was opening the door to his office, he decided to say something.
"I'm sorry." Harry glanced over at Severus, who was watching tight-lipped -- but still watching. "Am I boring you, love?"
"Well, that gives us a place to start," Tonks stated. "What about ones you've had some interaction with?"
said in court, you idiot!! Kingsley!"  she shouted towards the door, before glaring back down at Mason. "What did--?"
"No, I mean ... sometimes Muggle-born wizards -- I mean, you're not Muggle-born, but being raised that way might be sort of the same -- sometimes they just leave, and go back to living as Muggles."
Harry spun around. Mr. Parkinson hadn't bothered to hide his features, or his distinctive holiday robes, where he stood in the smooth path. Draco stood petrified between them, his wand half out of his gathered sleeve. Esmée was breathing in harsh gasps, but made no other sound.
"I--" Harry thought he should be doing something equally inventive, but he couldn't, for the life of him, think what.
"Oh, Harry." Molly started to reach a hand out to him, and then changed her mind. She clicked her tongue nervously. "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I didn't even know that I had."
"Nothing. A particular green bead...." He lifted his hands. The secrecy pact kept deflecting him. "The person who makes you take a bead gets to choose its color."
Her hair was woven elaborately over her head, with only small curls left free by her ears, and her gown was a soft lavender, with matching gloves, just like in the picture. Her eyes -- the edges darkened with cosmetics or a charm -- widened as much as he thought his had, and they had to stumble into position and pick up the waltz on the second bar.
"About the same as usual." Seamus raised his eyebrows, but his voice dropped. "And I'd have said you woke up late."
Tom looked taken aback, and Harry tried sound calmer. "Look, remember the last time I'd stayed here? After I'd blown up my aunt? I have better control of my magic now, but we don't
"True," Susan said, "but I think it would be good to stay together for a while. We could study, or talk, or play quiet games."
She studied him for a moment. "Oh. Well, sorry, then." Uncomfortably, she looked around the space. "So we should pick up the rocks?"
"What do you think this is about?" Ron asked anxiously. "Do you think he found out about the divination? Or all this?"  Ron indicated the room with a broad sweep of his arm. Draco straightened and lightened his voice.
"In case Death Eaters catch her and cast a family curse of clumsiness or bad luck or something like that -- there's less that can happen if I'm in here." He grimaced. "In theory." He couldn't help but recall that the basilisk, Barty Crouch, and Quirrell had all been within these walls.
"I thought it was its own punishment, really." Harry sighed. "But ... yeah. We should all talk.  Let's meet in our place, right after dinner. Spread the word, okay?"
He wasn't sure he would have laughed without Tuktuk swinging off her arm, but his relief had to go somewhere.
Draco's face was hard, now, defiance in the set of his jaw. "I consider Tonks a cousin," he clipped out. "She's intelligent and fun, and we have agreed not to continue old feuds."
Dobby, meanwhile, had made up his mind. With his ears back in their normal positions, he nodded. "Dobby will get beer," he affirmed. "Dobby has a friend at the Three Broomsticks. Dobby will ask his friend which beers will please, and be getting six bottles of each."
She settled on the newest addition, a cream colored sofa, and Seamus joined her. Since they were meeting after dinner, Harry and Draco had decided on cheese and sweeter afters for food; Draco had arranged for the cakes and tarts to be bite-sized, and added a scattering of grapes and gooseberries to each platter. There was one of each type of platter on the coffee table, in reach of both sofas and one of the chairs, and smaller plates on the little round table, which was now set between two of the other chairs.
Another shared look, and Remus and Sirius both smiled. "I'm glad that you asked," Remus said. "You're a good boy, Harry."
He remembered, afterwards, that he was not supposed to use the name, but that hardly seemed possible to avoid in this context, and indeed, even the cat did not chide him.
Harry and Draco looked at each other, shrugged, and reached for the bowl. So did Ginny, Cornelia, Millicent, Parvati, and Padma.
"Justin and Ernie want to know where I go," Hannah said. "I'm not suggesting them for membership, but could we have some sort of gathering, somewhere, and invite other people, so they can see us together?
Harry was briefly disappointed when Draco drew his wand. However, rather than casting a warming charm around them, he cast one on his left hand, and then slid it around the back of Harry's neck.
Parvati swung her ponytail back, so high that it narrowly missed Seamus's face. "Perhaps you should."
Harry had only been back at the Dursley's for four days, and he was already sick of it. Dudley seemed to become stupider and more belligerent every summer. This year, school had managed to take a bit of weight off him, but that only made him a slightly more dangerous fighter, because it now took him a minute or two to run out of breath. He was still wide enough to trap Harry in the hall. Harry avoided him as much as possible, dodged when necessary, and reminded himself that he would be able to use magic at the end of the month.
Even with the bright sunshine outside, the room was dark, but Sirius, with a flick of his wand, set a cheery fire burning in the grate, and hung a kettle over the flames. With a little more concentration, he removed their disguises. "Welcome to The Den -- Darkmoon Den, if you ever need to Floo call. It's an old croft from before the Clearances, but we've expanded on it a bit -- mostly underground, where it doesn't show. Three rooms, and the outhouse is quite cushy. Would you like some milk? Only hours from the cow!"
"Oh." That threw all his suppositions in turmoil. "No. Frieda Horsyr. She taught Defense Against the Dark Arts last year." He shrugged. "Anyway, since you're here, and I have half an hour, do you want those introductions now? You might as well meet people."
Harry's thoughts raced. If the former professor was Remus, then it was more likely the news was about Sirius. But if it was bad, Draco would have come himself, regardless. "Was it a man in worn clothes?"  he asked.
"Yes, but that's always true, isn't it?" Blaise objected. "I mean, that's another aspect of it being conversation compressed."
tended towards boasts of holiday adventures more than things aimed at others. Ron scowled when Harry and Draco -- and two others -- took beads for Sophia's "stayed all night with a lover," but the mood, overall, remained light. Harry thought this term might be even better than the last.
Draco considered. "After breakfast tomorrow? We have time before our meeting with Professor McGonagall."
"But it could be." Harry stroked him idly while Draco levitated the suds and grime from the bath water to the sink. "If I was your alpha."
Her wand tip lifted -- finally -- spiraling around her in a Privacy charm, cast high enough to include the three of them. Draco relaxed back into the cushions.
"Let's get both of you back to your tower," he said, standing and offering Harry a hand up. "If you're late, Hermione will have questions, I'm sure."
, he remembered, looking at the paler Quiri. He desperately wanted to stroke his soft fur, as Hermione was currently doing. "Why is there sunlight?" he asked, working at focusing on something else.
"Not really," Harry answered, pushing a lock of hair back behind his ear. "Just keep the location and other members secret." Neville, however, was staring at his hand. Harry looked down at it and realized his bracelet was showing.
?" Draco's suggestion hauled Harry back to the present. "Severus Snape, moody, domineering bastard, won't wash?"
"No." Harry let out a harsh huff of a laugh. "No, that was all the day I got caught. I didn't go back there until the row about the House Cup, and that was alone."
"That will do, for now," Draco answered, instantly shifting into an imperious manner. "We may want dessert or drinks later. Check back in an hour."
, Harry. He won't harm you, even if he does find out." As Harry tried to reply, Draco held up a hand. "As a second step, you bring me along. Ask him first, of course, but he's bound to say yes. I often have dinner with the two of you.  I'll try to provide you with enough cues to keep abreast of the conversation."
On the floor, Narcissa straightened. "A gentleman does not so heinously mistreat his heir or his well-born wife. I can no longer trust his judgment. That in one of his rages he would be mad enough to pursue Draco to Hogwarts Castle itself, I do not doubt."
"Beloved," he read at a whisper, "my visits to your encampment, which I should dread for their danger, I await with longing for the sight of your smile, for the sound of your voice, for the touch of your skin." He rolled on to his side, trying to imagine Draco was there, whispering to him with this hidden sweetness. "I think I must be mad--"
"Sort of. Professor Dumbledore thinks that I lived because of my mother's sacrifice. But that V- Tom was left helpless -- that was probably a frightened toddler shoving his energy back at him."
"I hope you're right." Harry stood up and clapped her on the shoulder. "Just take care this week, okay? And call me if you need any help, because I want you in this department."
.  She felt this made her look more logically at what was known and what was alleged of her father's death, including some new information she inferred during the investigation." Draco looked sidelong at Harry. "She seems to believe you were present; I'm not sure why. She expressed frustration at how few details she had and asked if I would prevail upon you to speak to her."
She grinned and tapped it "Most likely. My mum's cousin is also a breeder, and was delighted to spend all evening giving me dirt on a rival."
"Right. I think it happens to a lot of kids with Muggle families." Harry shook off the thought and the memories that came with it. The Dursleys had hated him before any of that. "Anyway, you can all watch from here for as long as you like, and you can go back to the castle when you're bored. No going into the changing rooms, though, and no stepping out onto the pitch, got it?"
"He could just be guessing. I mean, it's not as if he's tried to explain it at all. He just tells me to try."
falling,” she said. “I thought it was the Cruciatus Curse. Since we knew you were in danger, I’ve been studying first aid spells. I used one intended to prevent auxiliary damage from convulsions.”
"Even if you are a git," Harry said, and that seemed to be the right tack. Ron rolled his eyes, but he was smiling, now.
"Fanged Frisbee out of nowhere, wasn't it?" Mill commented, her voice low. "They were blaming it on Peeves."
Slowly, Draco nodded.  "Yes. I can see where a union of choice could be more complex in that way.  My parents negotiated domestic spaces, more than activities." He looked off at into the ivy. "And while my life has held more expansive vistas than yours -- I have traveled to at least a dozen countries -- it was tightly constrained in other aspects. Still, we did well in this space, did we not?"  He looked back. "And you enjoyed the manor, I believe. We are both capable of some flexibility."
The room was empty. Harry dropped into a comfortable chair, but Ron remained standing, crossing his arms over his chest.
At lunch, Harry was quite hungry. He supposed it was due to the lack of food at breakfast. He ate slowly, as there was nothing else to do, and tried to enjoy the Christmas decorations. Unfortunately, that meant trying not to wonder if the Parkinsons had taken theirs down.
Harry stopped. "No. I mean, she is less reasonable about you than about Draco, but the real problem is that I don't have explanations for the time I spend with you. I can't even tell her that it's with you, or she'll look into it more. That means she asks more questions about other things that she'd normally let slide. If Draco is willing to say I was with him, every other Sunday afternoon, that should help a lot."
Harry wondered if girls' dormitories were full of helpful tips like this. Nodding, he tried again. In addition to Malfoy's fingers in his hair, he felt another touch lower, fumbling at the fastenings to his trousers, then working under the elastic on his pants. He heard a pant from Eugene as he finally reached his cock, and his own breath moaned out around Malfoy's. Malfoy was beginning to thrust up when he suddenly tugged at Harry's hair and stopped, squirming back and pushing his head away as if repulsed.
"Cast it before you leave," Millicent suggested. Her voice was tight, but she voiced no objection to being left with Hermione. After meeting her eyes for a moment, Harry nodded, and he cast the charm.
"I supplied the money to buy the place, partially in exchange for the right to stay there. We drew up a contract and everything.  Draco insisted on that, so he could put in a secrecy clause that would keep them from telling anyone."
She snorted. "I'm not going to tell you." At his incredulous look, she relented. "From what I know of you, you'd try to be nice, and work on thinking of me that way. And then you might mess up."
"Mm." A spot of warmth blossomed on his neck as lips moved softly over it. "Circe, you smell good, Potter."
"Yeah. Here...." He pulled slowly back, and then, when she seemed to be relaxing, pushed slowly in again.
"We haven't started yet," Harry protested, with what little control he had left. He wasn't sure if Malfoy -- Draco -- was taking this seriously.
"I see the point," Harry interrupted, unwilling to have them fight. Draco's subsequent guilt would not be worth his own moments of pleasure.  "Draco, he's just being rude. Ignore it." He looked steadily into Snape's visible rage. "It seems to have worked, to some extent."
He thought, as he turned back to where Sajid, with mock care, was picking himself up off the floor, that he should take Snape up on his offer. If Hermione set McGonagall on him, that could jeopardize all of Millicent's plans. Also, if the twins were connected to the scheme, he might be unable to obtain substances that he and Draco needed for the next divination.
"Really?" Remus's brow creased as his eyebrows rose. "Well. I'll be happy when the feeling is mutual."
"And it isn't as if my family didn't support the Dark Lord until fairly recently," Gilbert said. "My father simply wasn't willing to risk life, freedom, and fortune in that support." His mouth twisted up on one side. "And then there were last year's massacres, and Mother decided he -- You-Know-Who -- was an embarrassment to pureblood Britain."
"Really, Ron. Everything you predicted for me last spring was right. I think you do, and I think that if the professor wasn't a complete fraud, you'd know it, rather than joking around and doing it by accident."
"Very good, Draco. Yes." He straightened.  "Willingly given, I might add, by the Far Friar, so if he looks a bit thinner this week -- thinner in the sense of a soup, that is -- refrain from comment."
"Well, yeah. I mean, I didn't think of it like that, but I could see that she couldn't just do what I said, when some of the other kids considered me an enemy."
"Professor Snape was far more methodical," Linnet said, once the hilarity at Susan's tale had died down. "He asked me and Gilbert both about the bronze bead -- for full marks on something I thought was incomplete -- and the red and gold bead that was for using a house affiliation as an insult."
. Milder things -- hair, nail clippings -- can focus a minor hex on the single person that they came from. Dead matter --" He flicked his hand to the side. "It could be used against you Potter, but not to kill or maim. To hurt, perhaps. Do not consider yourself safe, but if another foray succeeds, you are not doomed. Do not let them draw you out. That, most probably, is the true goal." He scowled. "To horrify, to demoralize, and to engender reckless action."
Harry fumed silently beside Draco as they walked down the torch-lit dungeon corridor. Snape's actions, while helpful, were still humiliating, but that was just a shadow under his anger at Hermione. Did she imagine he would refuse? Did she think that she needed to steal his books to get him to keep his word? He arrived at the Quiris' room ready to lay into her with full righteous indignation. He had imagined her waiting by the door, ready to speak, but when he threw it open, she wasn't there. He had to look to the side to find her, through the tangle of climbing frames that Draco had been slowly growing for the Quiris to play on.  She was settled in the window seat, with Tuktuk in her lap and Cheefi grooming her hair, and she beamed at him as their eyes met. Cheefi jumped down with a little chirrup and ran to Draco to swing up onto his shoulder.
"Why not bring it to Professor Hecksban?" Ron asked. "I mean, I know I said that about blood curses too, but he's here, and he's good at it -- Bill even says so -- and this is something you own, and it's okay to have."
Leaning against the bed, Harry took the bottle from Fred.  "Because my introduction to drinking was from the Malfoy heir? Why, would you suggest something else?"
Hi all! Sorry it's been so long. I'm going to try to post regularly while all my usual activities are cancelled.
"Well ... I really need some time away from Gryffindor. I'm not going to be around this evening, and I thought you might like to know in advance."
He smiled, hoping the girl was telling the truth. By the way her friend was glaring at her, she might be. If Millicent had gone outside, she was likely to be in sight of the door for at least another minute.
"Take it off?" Cornelia asked, as if the concept was absurd. "Oh, you can't do that! It's permanent."
Hugh Cecilius -- the younger student who hadn't believed Harry about Voldemort last spring -- next to Daphne. There was a sofa full of people Harry recognized but didn't know the names of -- two sixth year students and one fifth-year, he thought -- and then another girl of that sort on the next, but she was sitting next to Gilbert, who was next to Linnet, who was nearest to Draco on the other side. Harry glanced over at her and she winked and shook her bracelet back, making him smile.
Snape hissed in surprise. "Oh yes." His eyes gleamed. "That would do indeed! But then the Seer can find your weaknesses, as well."
Her eyes widened. She looked away, blinked, and then turned back with her features schooled to casual interest. "Oh. I wasn't sure how to arrange it."
" Harry said carefully "-- I mean, I'm sure there are others, but the one affecting my life -- was a
Setting aside his book, Dumbledore stood. "No need.  I will see to the invitation, Harry. If you leave right now, you may have time to say farewell to the Quiris."
the things I have to offer, as I will not be a romantic match. I may suggest Mother look at some poorer girls. They should be more biddable."
"It certainly should be," he retorted mildly. "In any case, Weasley, that is the first option. The second is similar, but adds a focus-enhancing potion taken before that. It would not add any potentially Dark elements, but would be a little more dangerous.
"And then I released Draco, who was Petrified -- in the attack, that is -- and went back to fighting with him." He'd totally ignored Esmée, Harry realized. She'd still been stuck in the dogwood. Snape would have released her by now, of course, if she couldn't get to her own wand, but she probably thought he was a complete lout.
"You could probably learn to turn into something, with proper effort. You're a talented pupil, as I recall."
"The book said this course was 'like puberty,' but it didn't go into details -- except for an example of growing hair. And saying the timeline was compressed."
"Draco!" Pansy shouted. "I need--" She stopped, staring at the three of them. "Oh -- Potter." She swallowed, and nodded curtly. "Professor."
“Now,” Hecksban said. “It will be at least ten minutes yet, and while I expect that none of us want to discuss the particulars of that curse, it is better to get the thoughts out than to sleep with them. What were our warnings? What could we have done better?”
"That's what she said. But Barty Crouch Jr. kidnapped me at the end of fourth year, and Wormtail -- Peter Pettigrew -- made Voldemort a new body from my blood and some other disgusting things."
"Oh." Brow wrinkling, she stared past his shoulder for a moment, until he almost began to wonder if there was something behind him. "That makes sense," she said finally, resuming their walk. "It is a long time. Some of my housemates are noticing too."
Pansy's scream ended with a choked sob that struck Harry harder than the threats. He shook his head.
"Then you skipped a reading in fourth year. I should go back and make sure you didn't get credit for it."
The moment after orgasm was often like rising from a dive, but Harry didn't think he'd ever been that
Relieved, Harry nodded. Glancing up, he saw that Malfoy had his trousers on already, and was pulling robes over his bare chest. "Yeah. That was good." He tried to push down the thought of being a girl for Malfoy later. It was really only fair. "What did you have in mind? For now, I mean?"
"Very good." He climbed onto the bed and edged forward, his knees close to either side of Harry's legs, so they were held together. It was another kind of restraint, and Harry tensed under it, but he wasn't actually afraid. He really didn't have the focus for it, not with the way Draco was idly fondling his own hardening cock a mere foot away.
, Harry wanted to protest, but he could see that this wasn't the time to try to convince everyone. "All right then. It's just residue of his spirit in my scar, but something triggered it."
"So you let him give you dares, do you?" Seamus challenged. Several people were frowning at Harry. Cornelia was the only other person to take a bead, and Harry was fairly sure she had been raised among Muggles. Draco turned the beads a lurid green, and it was Harry's turn.
After a second of silence, the air before them puffed out and Dobby appeared. "Harry Potter, sir!"  He nodded to both of the others, but then crossed his arms over his narrow chest. "You is all supposed to be at lunch! The kitchen Elves have made Scotch broth and crusty rolls and glazed carrots and Maryland chicken. They be sad if not enough is eaten."
