"I was about to ask you the same question, savior of the wizarding world." Draco remarked. "They all said you crashed at the Weasley's before you up and disappeared without another word."
Draco remained in his place at the divan, but Harry could see the flicker of surprise and hurt flash through his eyes. Harry tensed, remorse at the ready, but he pushed it back. He had nothing to regret. Malfoy was trying to trick him into spilling his secrets, that was probably the reason he'd invited Harry in to begin with.
Draco sighed. "It won't be long, Potter. Just a way to come to a compromise regarding this piano problem. You have my offer, take it or leave it." He extended a shaky hand, just like he'd done that first day at Hogwarts. Draco didn't know why, but he really, really wanted Harry to accept his offer, the desire ascending beyond the piano matter. Draco hadn't seen Harry since he left Hogwarts two years ago and left everything behind, and certainly hadn't realized he was living next door to him for the past two months. Draco was starting to consider the option that he missed Harry, or at least the amusement their banters provided.
Harry then ripped his hand away from Draco's. Draco sensed that he hadn't meant to hold it for that long.
Smirking, Draco swept the door all the way open, welcoming Harry inside with his natural pure-blood manners.
"This- this is a trick," Harry scoffed. "We were essentially rivals all through our days at Hogwarts and now you're inviting me in for a housewarming cocktail?"
As for Harry, a similar war was also waging inside his head. This was when he should've laughed in Draco's face, turned around, and headed back inside his flat. But there was an unreal sincerity in Draco's tone, a certain glimmer in his eyes, some damn unknown thing tugging at Harry's heart. Harry didn't know what it was, but it made him lace his fingers through Draco's before his head could catch up with his heart.
"Well, I've always known how to play, but up until moving here I wasn't very interested in playing." Draco admitted, remembering how he would count down the minutes until his piano lessons were over as a boy.
But even if the storm would come back the second after the music ended, Draco would finish strong, as all artists do.
Harry stood, removing his coat from the cushioned chair as he did so and wrapping it around him. He stormed towards the door.
"Easy, Potter. I let you come inside, that doesn't mean I'm gonna fluff your pillows and serve you bon-bons on a silver platter."
Harry was no longer in the pool of his apartment. He was in the murky water of the lake, running out of time, desperate for oxygen. Turning a corner and shoving his way through seaweed, he saw the person he had been looking for, their body sinking, drifting to the bottom of the ocean, losing consciousness. Harry couldn't save them, not if he wanted to come out of this alive. Christmas colors began to decorate his vision, and Harry pushed himself up to the surface, saving himself but abandoning another.
"Yes, it is, Potter. When I moved here, I had no other option. But you? You have people back at Hogwarts, back home. People who care about you. Ron and Hermione." The words felt strange and unfamiliar on his tongue, as Draco had gotten used to addressing the two as "weaselhead" and "mudblood" after years of doing so at Hogwarts.
For a fraction of a second, Draco recognized something in Potter's beautiful- cough, cough, simple green eyes. Desperation. Desperation for a clean slate, a fresh start, an old life he wanted to leave behind and a new life ahead of him he wanted to untap. Before two months ago, Draco never would've guessed that he could relate to this feeling. But now, he understood it more than ever. Before he could think better of it, Draco played nice.
"Wait, what am I thinking?" Harry admonished his mind for betraying him and came to a halt in his pacing. The pool was relatively secluded, but there were a few muggles hanging out on the side giving him a strange look, probably inquiring after his pacing and muttering.
Draco didn't respond. Because, truth be told, Draco wasn't entirely sure why he cared. Maybe it was envy. Maybe it was something else. He didn't know.
Shit. Draco hadn't meant to say that. He bit his lip, a habit he'd picked up over the years. "Something like that."
"Well, if you weren't planning on filing a police report and throwing the piano in the nearest dumpster, you could've at least gone to the front desk and asked for the previous owner's name. So you could figure out who sent it to you."
A part of himself that Harry couldn't identify was strangely disappointed with this. Harry didn't want to admit that a part of him hoped that Malfoy really did care. For whatever damn reason, a part of Harry had wanted to believe that the concern in Malfoy's blue eyes was real, that Malfoy would listen to him if he ever worked up the courage to revisit the past he wanted to forget.
Harry discovers who his 'mystery' neighbor is- and that they may have more in common than he thought.
Harry didn't recognize his movements through his anger. One moment he was standing in Draco's apartment, the next he was back in his. Then he was pulling off his shirt and putting on his swim-trunks. Now he's storming outside. In the event that Draco broke his promise to tone it down with the piano (which he probably-definitely would) Harry wasn't going to listen to him play while seething. No, he couldn't listen to him play at all.
"Fuck off. Stop acting like you don't remember." Harry chugged down some of his tea, so he wouldn't have to waste any more words regarding this particular topic.
Harry clenched his fists. Typical pretentious Malfoy behavior. He couldn't deal with this right not, anyway. He had come here to escape the past, not relive it. "Whatever," He said. "I came here to get away from all that. And with your distracting, excruciatingly loud piano-playing, you're making that very difficult to do."
"Back to the piano-can we come to an agreement? You won't play your death machine for five bloody hours?"
Draco was unable to restrain another laugh. "Is this your very eloquent way of asking me why I like to play piano?"
Since Harry had laid eyes on Draco his first day at Hogwarts, Draco had been a smug pain in the ass. He was still acting like one moments ago. But then he starting acting so unrealistically sincere, implying that he regretted his racism and that he'd had time to reflect and was now prying about Harry's past. Why would Draco Malfoy, out of all people, care about Harry Potter's wellbeing after years of rivalry? To Harry, there was only one answer that was obvious to him now: He didn't. Inviting Harry into his flat, promising to tone down his obnoxiously loud piano playing, now prying about the incident two years ago... all of it was a trick so Harry would let his guard down. He should've known. He should've figured it out before.
Harry's neighbor, whoever the hell he was, needed to shut the fuck up. Classical music, while beautiful, grew very strenuous after five. straight. hours.
Harry leaves Draco's apartment with a lot to think about, and a swimming session goes horribly, horribly wrong.
Despite his grogginess and the thick surface of the water, Harry managed to hear someone shout "He's drowning!" before everything went black.
"Fine, fine. As I said earlier, my intention wasn't to interrupt your solidarity Gryffindor man brooding time. I'll tone it down with the piano... a bit. Maybe take off an hour or so so you only have to endure four hours of my Pureblood cult practices." Draco tried to sound as smooth and unbothered as possible, but deep down, he was hesitant. Every moment he spent with his piano was sacred. Every second of every song lifted a weight off of his shoulders and eased all his troubles, whether old or new. If Draco hadn't grown into less of a jackass over the past two months, if he didn't empathize with Potter's need for peace, he probably wouldn't be making this agreement.
"You're in love with Harry, you have Hanahaki Disease!" Hermione declared in shock, seeing the petals that had been coughed out reminded her so much of Harry.
"Yeah! I mean, you bullied us- him for years! And now you suddenly claim you love him!?" Ginny hissed. Arthur was about to get onto her when Draco held his hand up as a way of saying 'it's okay.'
When Draco finally got out of bed, about ten minutes later; he dragged his un-stretched limbs over to his wardrobe where he pulled out clothes for the day, but as he was looking through them he stopped on a certain jacket. To be specific, a Gryffindor jacket, along with a few other things. Those few clothes had been Harry's despite the fact they didn't fit him at all. He remembered the day he was assigned to go check on the last of his family to give them the news, seeing them looking a bit pleased had pissed him off. Draco thought he was about to kill the three of them right there, yet he was rather good at reading emotions and saw that Dudley looked a bit distraught.
"I would've brought Harriet. You might've enjoyed seeing her. She's a pretty playful dog, golden retriever to be exact." Draco looked down at the roses, a small smile. "Mum would have loved to come, but I ran away to come here. Not like me, I know." His dull silver eyes that had a tinge of greenish blue on the very edges, began to water. "I wish I could've said this directly to you.
Narcissa was worried, after Molly had comforted her, she went back home along with Draco. But right now, she was tired and just wanted to be in bed, sadly, her nerves were off the charts as she paced through the halls and rooms looking for her son. Lucius, her crappy husband, was surprisingly looking around as well.
He looked down at it before looking up at the sky. "No matter how hard I had tried to hate you.... it still hurts. The flowers you love so much, tightening around my lungs and now my heart." He leaned his head against the gravestone, feeling weak as he coughed up petals. "I truly, do love you... and apologize for everything, Harry."
Draco turned around and looked at him, tears in his eyes as well as Harry's. "Yes.... indeed it is, Potter."
It went silent for a bit and Dudley tried even harder to not burst into tears. He had lost his old friends right after Harry's death. They said it was stupid for him to mourn over him.
Draco looked around, the castle looked almost the same. A few things were changed, like it seemed way more protected. Hagrid had gotten more things, such as a place to have all the creatures he has to have a home. And his hut looked to be upgraded, with Fluffy laying outside sleeping, but he was also chained to a spot next to Hagrid's door. There were a few more creatures lying about freely in the huge area they were given now, but they weren't entirely dangerous unless approached wrong, or they feel ill intent coming from someone.
The only noise was the sound of utensils against plates, cups lightly hitting the table, chewing, and Harriet on the floor under Draco's feet biting down on a pretty large turkey leg.
The victim that has this disease usually dies within two or maybe three weeks. People are lucky to live a month. Draco had been beyond that, and he was shocked he hadn't died yet. All the doctors at the muggle hospital always try to convince him to get surgery but every time Draco declines and walks out.
"You two can just leave them there, I will think of something!" Molly said to them and they nodded. Draco quickly finished his apple and tossed it in the trash, before grabbing another and a knife, then sitting down next to his mother.
He looked down at his lap, where his hands rested clutched together. His platinum blonde hair falling down in front of his eyes that began to leak those salty tears. "You're probably thinking who drank a Polly Juice Potion, huh? Well, tough luck I guess. I am indeed the bratty self-centered prat you know, or knew. In fact, my therapist said everyone had about two personalities; the one they act as, a persona given. And then their true personality, on the inside that they hide out of fear." Draco lifted his head and leaned it onto the grave.
"Perfect." Draco said sarcastically. "First, I'm awaken from a wonderful dream. Next, my father just had come along with us when it's my therapy, that Mum takes me to. So that bloody git has to ruin it." Draco rolled his eyes and Dudley smiled hearing he had a good dream. The two known each other for five years so they were a bit close. "What was your wonderful dream about?"
"Well at least it's healthy for him! And... are you sure it's fine for him to be here? Right after I helped him he went right outside with George." Molly asked, she was really concerned for him.
Dudley froze, he was correct. He knew it was going to happen, and was grateful to the potions as well as magic that kept him alive this long, he estimated about seven to eight years based off what he told him. He knew Draco was dying, and he knew that Narcissa who he loved as if she was his second mother, was the one making the potions and casting spells on Draco to stun the growth of the disease.
Mum, I am very sorry to say that I will no longer be around to help you with the garden, or around the manor. I do wish that Harriet will be an amazing companion for you, and will help take care of you better than Father will. I truly do apologize to Harry's friends, I still feel guilty even if I did change. Luna and Neville, you two were probably the only ones who definitely saw me as a different person when I first apologized, thank you both for becoming my friends. Pansy, you knew I wasn't straight after a few years of obsessing over me. The day you did learn that was the same I figured out I had the Hanahaki Disease. "Bloody Potter." Was the first thing you said before helping me, it was rather funny. Blaise, take care of Pansy. You were really close to her as was I, but knowing her, she would probably be screaming at my dead body by now, and then move onto blaming Harry. Which Harry is not to blame! Thank you for helping me through the panic attacks and keeping me on track during the war, no matter how many times we argued with each other and how many times I pushed you away, along with others, you still stayed acting as if nothing happened but you were clearly worried for me. Weasley Family, I thank you as well. You all helped me through the pain, as well as Mum. George, you were a great friend and I'm sorry for leaving, I don't mean to. Ginny, I apologize for being the way I am, but I couldn't exactly control the persona pushed onto me since birth. Molly, I will miss your meals while eating with Arthur who talked about the good things at the ministry. Both of you please keep an eye on my Mum, would you? Hermione I already spoke to you, and don't exactly have anything to say to Ronald. Dudley, I've already spoken to you back at the cafe. Currently, I'm probably apologizing to Harry, and apologizing on your part as well. After all, you may not even be in the manor. Father might have tossed you out already, unless he is up in his study scowling and being negative and cold as always. Do visit Mum for tea, she would love you! Father, I'm sure you snatched this from Mum to rip it up. Screw you. You are absolutely terrible, I could probably give at least five scrolls of parchment about how terrible you are, and about another seven of what you did wrong or how you could have changed that. Still, as a little kid I did look up to you, so please, for the better, watch over Mum and help her around. I will give an actual reason I did not want the surgery to get rid of the disease. This may sound crazy, but I thought I deserved the pain. For everything I have done, but that isn't the only reason. I never wanted to forget Harry, he was a big part of my life in all honesty. It would be weird having so many gaps in my memory, but who would want to forget the person they love? In my opinion I think it is absolutely mental that people would do that. But think of it this way, I will die in peace. Who knows, maybe I'll see Harry again, and if I do, I will gladly say hi for all of you! Again, thank you.
Dudley tapped his foot as he waited for Draco to arrive, he was sitting here for thirty-seven minutes and was debating on whether to leave, or don't.
"Ah! Draco, glad to see you're here!" Arthur came from downstairs and greeted the pale blonde. "And Narcissa, how're you both?"
Molly had just finished helping Draco get all the petals off his face, it's painful but she knows Draco hates them on his face or in his hair. After she did that Draco went outside with George to do whatever they do.
Draco looked up at him shocked and leaned forward. "Let me guess, he talked about how much of a bully I was?"
Sobs were heard, but a white noise was the only thing Narcissa heard as she screamed in hysterics. McGonagall ran out to see what was going on, and also cried seeing Draco was that way.
"That isn't why I'm here though..." Draco sighed and builder up enough courage to continue to speak. "I-I came to uhh, apologize."
Narcissa had gathered everyone that had known Draco closer than others. This was because it had rules on the front of the envelope, and the people needed.
The larger man's eyes widened seeing Draco tearing up, he was honestly terrified. "Mum would be bedridden, she's sick so my death would probably do it for her. Father would make everything worse. I'm sure no one would show at my funeral! Harry may be in his grave dancing that his bully finally died, his friends would be throwing a party."
Harriet was worried for her owner, she had this feeling that Draco wasn't going to be around long. He smelled like his soul was leaving, and she heard him coughing which wasn't always good. Harriet hopped off and tugged on the collar of his shirt gently to help him up. She was glad to see there wasn't any petals or blood coming from his mouth, and that it was only the air being knocked out of him. She licked his cheek and whined, showing she was apologizing in a way.
"I had followed that Malfoy persona since I was born. Except those few times Mum played with me with muggle toys! My favorite was the golden retriever, I named the plushie Maddy. You're probably thinking why I didn't name my dog that, truth is, I named her after you, my therapist told Mum that was just a way of coping." Draco smiled a bit. "Your persona however, was 'The Boy Who Lived' you followed that persona since you were eleven. Hermione told me about your childhood. Severus never hated you by the way, I'm sure you learned that the day he died. His memories as well. He did everything he could to protect you, no matter how cold he had to be. Sev told me that he used you looking like your father as an excuse to be cold, but you were just like your mother apparently just with James's anger."
Hermione smiled to both of them. "That's great! Im glad to know people have been there for you. How have you been, Misses Malfoy?"
This was everything he needed. He felt... whole? He couldn't describe it, even if they didn't know each other by conversing and no arguing, they definitely were in love.
Narcissa stood up immediately and walked outside so she could cry. Molly was already in tears as well as Arthur. While Arthur stayed inside, his wife went outside to be with Narcissa and comfort her even while crying.
Draco walked out onto the battlefield. Well, the old battlefield where the war ended. There was Harry's grave, exactly where he died. Red roses were growing around it, a few were growing up the sides, but it still looked beautiful than before yet still brought pain.
"Why the hell would you be in love with Harry!? After all the sh*t you've done!?" Ron exclaimed, breaking the silence as tension began to rise.
Narcissa placed her hand on his and Draco gripped it, not tight but he was looking for a bit of comfort to calm down his nerves which skyrocketed when he saw the man he feared. The man that caused some of his problems, and used him. And now he was with them, to take Draco to therapy. "For Merlin's sake I believe therapy is useless." Lucius grumbled before apparting everyone, including the dog.
"How would you like to spend your last few days?" Dudley asked as he teared up, the blonde across from him seemed relieved to die.
The war before the dark and light had recently ended. Or, that's how it still feels. To Draco it felt like it has been a day, but that wasn't true. It has been five years.
Lunch was silent; Ginny came down from her room to join them, but kept sending glared at Draco. Ron was still thinking, he still didn't believe Draco was in love with his best friend! Hermione was silent since everyone was silent, she didn't know how to break the silence without interrogating the young Malfoy, after all, Harry did tell her that she has a habit of interrogating and not nicely asking. The three parents, silent as well, barely getting over a whisper to ask for something that was further away from them. George was silent, which was odd, but it is understandable. He has been eating in silence ever since Fred died, he used to make jokes with him at the table but he just couldn't anymore. Sure, George will tease but he stopped with all the pranks and silly yet hilarious jokes only Fred would laugh at, he did crack a few with Draco before and he laughed, but to him, it sounded like his brother was laughing as well.
Arthur looked at him worriedly when Harriet had begun to whine a bit, anytime that dog had whined it was either about Draco or the fact she was being teased, and even when she is being teased it sounds slightly different. "Maybe because the disease is latching onto any store magic, or Harry's spirit is still alive."
Others had mourned over the deaths of friends, family and especially Harry Potter. Draco had heard the funeral for Potter was huge, and then now every year there is an anniversary thing that wizards and witches do.
Draco took a quick glance at his father, but once he saw that he was looking at him, he looked towards the ground and walked up next to his mother.
George and Draco quickly set the baskets of apples down before Draco opened the door again. Right as he was about to yell out his dog's name, she had jumped on him making him fall over.
"You're free, my son." Lucius spoke, letting his own tears roll down. Narcissa nodded, agreeing with him.
Lastly, is the heart. The heart is pretty rare to see, and very few have had flowers grow around it. Yes, around it. While the flowers grow within the stomach and lungs, the flowers grow around the heart, tightening around it until it bursts, killing the victim instantly.
The roses that were still on Draco's spirit began to wilt, falling off and fading away. "You're free now. Just like they said." Harry smiled. "No more death eater, no more Malfoy persona. You get to be yourself. Free!" Draco began to cry while laughing, and soon it came to just crying. Harry was correct, he was free. The warmth that Harry gave him in an embrace was meaningful. He felt loved, but not in pain anymore.
Harry chuckled and put his hand back in his pocket. "I heard what you said, at my grave. Is it all true?"
George let go when Harriet barked. Draco looked down at her since she was halfway up in his lap, he began to pet her. "I'm sorry." He apologized to the dog who whined, then went back to laying underneath his feet like she usually does, but she put her paw over her nose and huffed.
Just as he made the decision to leave, the door opened and in walked the familiar blonde who's eyes were red and puffy. It worried him, he knew he had therapy every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Today was Friday, and usually Draco was doing better and was able to make it through the weekend. But the way his eyes were, he must've had it roughtoday.
Harriet looked up at Draco, as if begging to be apologized to and given pets. The young Malfoy sighed before petting her, and then combing his hands through the dog's long golden fur.
"Ronald Weasley!" Molly looked at her son in anger, she didn't need Draco's flowers to sprout even more, she still needs to ask how the last scanning was.
The blonde looked up at her, before noticing her hand along with Ron's. He smiled. "Congratulations!" He smiled and hermione got flustered but still had that look she had when she wants to know something.
She wished she could have lied about Harry Potter being dead. She wished he could be with her son, after all, Hermione did tell her that Harry talked about Draco a lot, how fascinating he was. Yet, he was too scared to go up to Draco and treat him like a friend. Scared that if Draco said something, and his anger flared, he wouldn't be able to control his next action considering his anger issues had gotten bad during the war, and Malfoy just tinkered with it. Hermione told her that she understood Harry, and why he said that. Considering she had been told about Harry's childhood as well, that was probably the reason for his anger issues and the war added onto his stress and fear which for him, turned into anger that was waiting to spill out.
Everyone looked towards Draco, except Ginny and Ron. "I'm going to say in a few days." He said as if it was a common thing he said.
Draco took the apple out of his mouth, quickly swallowing the part he bit off and greeted him as well. "Arthur, good morning! You missed breakfast, as you can tell." He motioned towards the kitchen where Molly had magic working to wash.
"That's alright, just toss me an apple!" Arthur said as he sat down next to his son. Draco did as requested and tossed him a perfectly ripe apple.
"We're doing great! Draco, I think you accidentally left Harriet outside." Narcissa answered Arthur's question and looked at her son since she didn't see the hyperactive dog.
Ron was about to whisper something in Hermione's ear about her, but she smacked him before he could. "Bloody hell woman." He muttered. "I didn't even say a thing!"
They all followed Harriet who began sprinting, she smelled Narcissa's scent along with Draco's. But they were all horrified at what they found.
Draco looked at her worriedly before Hermione spoke. "Is there anything you would like to do, on your last days?"
McGonagall chuckled. "Shall we get going?" She asked kindly. The other two nodded and separated, following her into the castle.
"Why?" Draco asked. "Why, are you treating me like this?" Harry rolled his eyes and rubbed his temples. "You seriously do not listen to Dudley, do ya?"
Draco rolled up his sleeve, he was in the same clothes he died in; a button up shirt and jeans. Simple outfit for him, despite his expensive wardrobe of fashionable clothing. "I never expected you to come here. Or even be in spirit."
The doctors that do scanning for the disease were really shocked he has been alive this long, though, since they're muggles they don't know of magic and it's wonders. But, the death of the one Draco loves did slow it down.
"Malfoy is here!?" Ron hissed out, but before the two mothers could explain, George and Draco came back in. Both the boy were holding a basket full of freshly picked apples from the few apple trees. Draco had one in his mouth as George laughed. Draco was trying his hardest not to with the apple in his mouth.
Narcissa hated this, she hated how her son was treated and how she didn't have a say in anything, nor was she able to speak to the Dark Lord without being hurt, she knew that, but luckily he was gone, yet the amount of trauma he left behind was terrifying.
Did you enjoy it? I really hope you did! Any questions will be answered if you have any. Either in a tik tok, or a Q&A. You may ask questions about the story or myself, and I will give my best answer possible! This is indeed short, but the amount of time I've spent either crying coming up with endless possibilities of finishing the story, or writing was A LOT! It may have been a few days but I swear this is all I've really done, is write this. My cat cuddled with me, so it made me happy and prevented most tears. Did you cry?
This definitely was not was he expected at the moment. A passionate kiss, in spirit, after he watched his own funeral.
"We have three baskets of apples... for what?" George looked at the blonde that shrugged and grabbed the apple he had been eating before, to continue eating it.
"No, no!" Dudley chuckled. "He was really in love with you. He spoke with so much passion, talking about how he was jealous and admired you." He grabbed his phone off the table.
Narcissa snapped. "How do you know!? He isn't anywhere in the manor, even Harriet can't find him! You've never cared for Draco, even when you forced him to become a Death Eater. You have never cared about him as he was being tortured in the chambers by the Dark Lord! You've never cared about anything! You've never cared about this family, about me or your son. You are a selfish prick who only cares about yourself, and your bloody reputation! God damnit!" Narcissa shoved him away and Lucius, his the fact that her words hurt, even if he was angry about what she said.
was slightly ajar. Rationalising, Harry took it as a sign he was supposed to follow Draco. He slid the door open a bit more and slid through the opening, pulling the door closed behind him. It took a minute for his eyes to adjust to the dim lighting inside, then he crept forward, listening for voices, preparing to slip between the black velvet curtains that hung along the side of the stage if he needed to.
"That's not what I meant, Pans, and you know it. For the most part Muggles have never experienced magic and all the amazing things it allows you to do. Now, here I am being forced to act like I don't know what magic is or that I've ever had access to it." His voice was harder than he meant it to be. "Do you really think I'm finding this a lark? That I
It was nearly five hours before a Healer in a pale green robe appeared, stopping in the doorway and looking surprised by the crowd.
Draco thought the man must be mad, and he was afraid his expression must convey that. He held his ground, staring at Ludo, waiting. Finally, Ludo sighed.
"But… wait," Draco stammered. He felt as if he'd taken a Bludger to the chest. "She was fine this morning. We had tea. I made us toast with marmalade." Draco lifted his chin but was unable to stop the tears from filling his eyes. "She was so alert; I didn't know she didn't feel well. If I had, I wouldn't have left her."
"So every bastard and his brother seems to think." Harry rolled his eyes. "Fuck. It wasn't even that close. I should know, I was right there."
Once the teams had formed on the pitch and kicked off into the air, all thoughts of Draco and how upset he'd be left Harry's mind. The exhilaration of flying and playing Seeker was worth whatever Draco would use against him in retaliation later. Harry only hoped he wouldn't withhold sex.
Harry wanted to argue with her, but knew she was right. "Okay, point. But still, those two numpties should have had a copy of it in their file. I've been through what they consider a case file at least five times and there's not a damn thing that resembles an arrest order."
Harry looked puzzled. "I think it's fairly obvious. I'm going to take my bag to the room I used before and get settled."
"Draco Malfoy, you have been accused of several crimes. Testimony has been heard in your defence from Harry Potter, and this body has taken it into serious consideration in outlining the parameters of your punishment. Please stand for your sentencing."
"You know what I mean," he growled flatly. "I love you, but you do recall the one time we tried to fuck, do you not?"
To add insult to injury, Bryant was in the Level II class with all his cohorts. The bullshite started the first day, with Bryant making comments under his breath, then looking completely innocent if Harry tried to call him on it.
Draco knew the punch was coming, but when it hit him right in the gut and not in the face as he'd expected, he retched. Given that his stomach was empty, he simply heaved for several moments before stopping. His breath was ragged and he panted for air.
Pansy wiggled her brows. "Good for me. And there's no point in you being surly just because you'd rather have your face buried between Potter's arse cheeks."
"Oh, yes you are." Draco propped his hands against Harry's pectoral muscles, curling his long fingers in the chest hair that swirled in a beautiful pattern from his neck, out around his nipples, not so thick he looked like a Yeti, but abundant enough to matter. It tapered in to a narrower path as it trailed down his hard stomach, until only a slender line of black hair curled around his navel and then down into his joggers. Draco was obsessed with Harry's body hair, having so little of his own, and his fingers stroked slowly down his hard belly.
"You… you…" Her lips began to tremble. "Just when I think I know how you're going to react, you go and say something like that. You are so…Draco!" She sighed and shook her head. "Which is probably why I love you so." She leaned back in her chair and crossed one perfectly toned leg over the other.
He wasn't going to be one of those people who sat around feeling sorry for themselves. He'd stopped enjoying playing Quidditch as it was. Maybe it was time to figure out what he
They wandered down the streets, looking into shop window and occasionally stopping to go inside a store and check it out. Harry picked up a few gifts for Hermione and Teddy along the way.
Silence descended, and Draco stared at him for so long Harry thought perhaps he ought to run back to Charlie and Deon's cabin and Floo back to England. He forgot how to breathe until, very slowly, the corner of Draco's lips began to quirk up in a smile. "Only you, Potter. Only you." He shook his head, then opened the door wider. "I suppose you should come in, then," he said. "Unless you're enjoying the chill to your bollocks."
"Oh, come on," she complained, pulling from his grip. "You've always told me how your fucks were hung. I could basically go back in there and do a measurement with my fingers."
Harry blinked, and his expression changed. It was only because Draco knew Harry so well that he saw Harry immediately put on what Draco thought of as his husband's 'Harry Potter' face. It was the face he used to hide anxiety, the face he wore for the media or for Molly when she complained that he didn't eat enough. It was the expression that hid worry, and fear. Harry pushed back his chair to stand, and met his daughter's slightly anxious gaze. Draco stood more slowly, eyes fixed to Harry. When Harry opened his arms and their daughter flew into them, Draco breathed a silent sigh of relief.
"We'll discuss this later," Draco said as evenly as he could. He knew he'd need to at least appear interested in this child. "How are you feeling?"
"Yeah, and you almost became part of the stands." Now that he was looking, Harry saw that Darian was unnaturally pale. Harry grabbed his jacket near the shoulders, giving Darian a light shake.
Harry followed him out the door, and Darian closed it emphatically behind them. Harry locked it with his wand, resetting the wards. "I know a good bar," Darian said. "Shall I Apparate us directly there?"
"Playing stupid won't save you this time," the man spat out with an evil smirk. "Now eat your food. I'll be back in five minutes to take you to piss and wash your face. Maybe we'll even give you time to do your hair." He walked away laughing like he thought he was hilarious.
“Just ask Draco,” she’d said in exasperation. “You know you want to. If you ask Deylon, you’re going to spend the whole evening reassuring him that yes, he is attractive, and yes, you really want to be with him. Which isn’t fair to you, but more to the point isn’t fair to
"I'm dying, but she'll never know it." He sighed. "Honestly, Pans. How did this happen? She was four just the day before yesterday."
Today when Draco arrived home after a late meeting, Ava was with Camélia at the table, nearly finished eating.
The man glanced around quickly to ensure that Harry was the only customer in the shop, and then lowered his voice anyway.
It took a moment for the home crowd to spot him, but when they did cheers began and led quickly to a roar. He'd never admit it aloud, but Merlin, he had missed that sound.
"If my magic gets that wild, I'm handing in my membership card. I may take your dick up my arse, but I'm not pushing a baby out of it."
Harry shot her an incredulous look. "I'm not a complete moron. Honestly, I'm about two seconds from taking this home to read in peace."
"I'm fine, Molly," he promised. "Really. I was ready to be done years before that Bludger ever hit me."
Pansy's head tilted and her eyes narrowed, but she didn't say anything. Draco was about to go into another tirade when the very tall, lightly muscled man with wavy light brown hair stepped down from the van.
Harry stood outside Draco's cabin, suddenly quite nervous about what he was going to say. He closed his eyes, exhaled and knocked. What felt like hours passed, although it was probably less than a minute. He was about to knock again when he heard steps on the other side of the door.
"I've got upstairs," one called out. Another shouted, "Heading down." And a third called over them all with, "On this level."
"Yes, poppet. Just like the book. Now you close those eyes and dream about how much I love you." He pulled the covers up under Camélia's chin, kissed her cheek and went to the door. He eased it almost closed, watching as her long lashes drifted down onto her smooth cheeks as she rolled to her side, nuzzling the pillow. Once he was sure she was asleep, he eased the door the last two inches and closed it silently.
Harry's mood soared back in the other direction, and he felt a wave of dizziness. He put his head back and closed his eyes. A hand came to rest on his thigh, and Harry felt it. He felt it, and he gasped. Looking down, he saw Darian leaning forward.
Harry wasn't sure exactly what he'd expected from life as a professional Quidditch player. It was a blast at first, but after playing as first-string Seeker for close to a year, he was ready to say it was aging him. Fast.
"I'm going to go take my husband to lunch," Draco announced to his assistant, Marcella. She looked up at him, face impassive. It was one of the things he liked best about her; her ability to look at people completely devoid of expression.
Harry nodded. "I guess. I just feel like Molly still looks at me like I let everyone down because I didn't get back with Gin after the war."
Ron leaned over and hugged him, showing more caution than Harry could ever remember. After him, Hermione leaned over, her eyes overly bright as she too hugged him gently.
Harry swung his feet so he was sitting and pulled Draco down to sit by his side. "Well it's a bit of a funny story really." He rubbed the back of his neck. "Well you see, it's like this…"
"You never talk to your daughter when you get home," he stated. "She sits at the table and looks at you, waiting for some sort of recognition from you. Do you even notice or are you that wrapped up in yourself that you've forgotten you have a daughter?"
Hermione smiled at Draco, and then Harry. "I see the Kneazle's out of the bag. But yes, I do have information. I was able to sort through a ridiculous amount of unfiled Auror reports." She turned and put her hands on her hips. "Really, Harry, you ought to do something about how far behind your department is in sending their X-9746 forms to filing. You'd think a group of grown men would be more responsible…"
As he ate—Molly's leftovers from lunch—Harry read back over their twenty questions game. The vague feeling of familiarity returned and Harry decided he had to find out who this
Draco struggled not to laugh, even though it really was funny. "You're terrible," he replied. He stared at the toe of her pump, bouncing slightly, and hope sparked dimly in his chest. Maybe it could work, as long as she didn't expect too much. Like a willing partner in bed.
In the final analysis, after hours of discussion and a viewing of Darian's memory in a Pensieve, Harry kept his job. It was thanks entirely to Darian and his memory, and his concise and eloquent description of what happened when Skeeter and her photographer cornered Harry behind a pool table. But it was a near thing, and Harry didn't fool himself. It really could have gone either way.
For a moment darkness filled Malfoy's expressive eyes and Harry had the uncomfortable feeling he might have offended the man, perhaps even hurt his feelings. He didn't like the sensation of regret at all. After several long seconds, and with what looked to be herculean force of will, Malfoy's expression cleared. "I doubt you could pronounce the name even if you tried."
Draco knew he should answer him, but he didn't. He leaned his elbow on the arm of the couch and rested his chin on his hand with another sigh. He heard the sound of Harry coming up the stairs, his boots loud on the wooden treads. He started to enter the sitting room, but stopped just inside the door.
Harry's eyes grew wide and he shuddered. "Thanks for that image. I could have gone the rest of my life without knowing people ate that. Tosser."
He could feel her rolling her eyes at his back. "Is that it? What's the matter with you Draco?" Pansy questioned, sipping her coffee. "I show you a picture of a gorgeous man with thick thighs wearing short shorts, and the best you can manage is a disinterested hum."
The Snitch shot away from the rings and dodged and danced over the heads of the Portree fans, who screamed and booed him as he shot past, but Harry never lost sight of it. He chased it down around the Arrows rings, then straight up until he nearly lost the feeling in his lips. He tightened his legs, locking his ankles so that when the Snitch turned and went into a dive straight down he didn't lose contact with his broom. He sensed the Portree Seeker just behind him, could hear him gasping in harsh, staccato breaths. No question, he was tired and doing everything he could to keep up. The ground was coming up at them fast, and the damned Snitch wasn't pulling out of its dive. Harry concentrated on the Snitch, trying to ignore the green grass that was getting closer and closer.
Draco remembered that. It was their last holiday party, and that vignette on the landing had been carefully planned. They came out and stood together, and Father did his 'hail fellow, well met' speech. It had bored Draco to tears.
Draco didn't doubt it for a minute. He felt far more than two years her senior. More like two dozen.
The tall, thin man with terrible posture and an unidentifiable stain on the front of his robes stepped into the door way, his face flushed. "Yes, Auror Malfoy, sir."
"No," she answered emphatically. "I hate it. One of the reasons I so badly wanted our marriage was to get away from that, and even so…"
"What a positively lovely baby. Okay, mummy," Ava smiled. "Let's get you and this little princess inside. You need to change into something comfortable and then I will bring you some tea."
"We can deal with those calls later. Honestly, I didn't expect to find anything in one piece," he said as they headed upstairs.
"You've done all of this by hand," she said in amazement. "I'm so impressed, Draco. Truly. I'm afraid I'll simply never live up to this."
"And thank you both," Draco said as he poured their drinks, "for protecting me. I really don't think they're evil, but they are utterly clueless."
Draco shook his head quickly, as if to erase the memories and his maudlin mood. He knew he was stalling. He needed to go tell Pansy the whole story, but even now after getting some sleep he didn't have a fucking clue what was going on or why he'd been dragged to the Ministry.
Harry Potter. I will say, at least in the classroom they weren't trying to kill me, but it was there all the same."
the side of Draco that lived in the same house with a madman for a year. He was not going to lose this battle.
She pushed gently and took him through the large sliding doors that led to the sitting room. It was a creepy and dark room, and aside from the time during the war when he and Ron and Hermione had slept in there, he avoided it.
"Well, Mr Clute, from here on out I intend to call you Rob. Now, don't you think it would look extremely odd if I called you Rob, and you went about calling me Mr Potter?" Clute looked a bit gobsmacked. "Really, my Potions professor at Hogwarts put me off being called Mr Potter forever. I can still hear it in his voice." Harry shuddered; it wasn't a lie. Thinking of Snape's voice simply pulled him back to that night in the boathouse, and he just couldn't...
Memories of being brought to a dark, dreary manor in the middle of the war, of Draco Malfoy watching him with mute dread before saying he wasn't sure that was Harry Potter, flashed into Harry's mind. He shook his head to clear it, certain Draco Malfoy would never deem the Knight Bus acceptable transportation.
Harry stared at her for a long time. He was going to argue with her, he really was, but he was so tired of pretending.  He shrugged. "Yeah," he finally admitted softly. "I think I figured myself out because I was fixated on his arse."
Once they were on his nose, and he could see himself clearly, Harry was still, staring. As it turned out, Darian was in fact a miracle worker with a pair of stylist's shears and a straight-edge razor. Harry's mop had gone from too long and too unruly, one cowlick on top of another to something suitable for the pages of a magazine. He didn't know the man looking back at him. He was sleek and stylish, handsome in a way Harry had never thought of himself. He blinked.
"Yeah, I guess. Although…" Harry walked up behind him, noticing changes on the tapestry that hadn't been there before. "Oh, it has changed. Huh."
The next day after classes ended, Draco wandered through the lovely old house and picked up his bits and bobs; all the things he had left scattered about. He paused at Zia Sophia's rooms and hesitated for several seconds before opening the door. The soft floral scent of jasmine that always followed her lingered in the room and made his eyes sting. She had become such a constant in his life over the last three years. He adored his mother, but Sophia had been the quintessential grandmother figure to him. He looked around and wondered if Emilio would allow him to take a small memento of hers with him when he left.
"Mummy doesn't like me," Camélia said. Her voice was so matter of fact and sounded so much older than her few years.
"Since you've brought it up, I'd guess he thought it was at least an okay idea." He paused for a moment. "How's he doing?"
Malfoy looked utterly gobsmacked and Harry had to bite his lip hard to keep the laugh filling his chest from erupting from his mouth. "I do beg your pardon," he finally muttered.
Harry could feel his face heat. "Dunno," he mumbled. "Just startled me, is all." He felt his mouth shifting to a pout and refused to let that happen. "You don't just pull your wand on a bloke who's defenceless and lying in bed."
Draco nodded. "She's always had my best interest at heart, even when I thought I didn't want or need her help. So Flimsey spent some time teaching me a bit about cooking and cleaning up. But after a couple of weeks, I sent her back to mother."
"Clare is asleep. I left the monitor on the tea table in the sitting room. On my way past, my nose led me to the mess on the sofa. I gather that was the reason for the charming pants you were wearing on my arrival." Harry blushed a charming bright red, and out of kindness, Narcissa ignored it. "At any rate, I have a very good upholstery cleaning spell, and I'm quite a dab hand at it if I do say so myself. Your sofa is now spotless, and smells much better."
"You dare call me names, you half-blood monstrosity??!!" The shriek echoed down the long central hallway.
Harry felt colour rise in his cheeks. "I can't have dinner with my best friend, while her husband is gone for a few days? Maybe I just wanted to see how you were faring all alone."
Pansy nearly shrieked and pulled out her compact, whipping it open and checking her face. "You absolute bastard. That was not funny."
Potter looked inquisitive, his deep green eyes darting between Draco and Pansy. "I'm supposed to be meeting someone, but it looks like they're running late." He gave a negligent shrug and looked at his mug. "At least the coffee's decent."
"Sorry," Darian said, although he truly didn't sound it. Harry caught his eyes and held them in their reflections in the mirror.
"Hermione, I'm responsible for them. For what they do. I'm responsible for making sure they understand procedure and protocol."
They settled into the back of the queue, standing shoulder to shoulder. They were several back in line, so Harry knew it would take a bit. Everywhere he looked, it seemed the pub was full of large parties. He supposed he should have expected that for the Appleby vs. Hollyhead match. It was certainly good for the Appleby economy. He studied his watch; he had roughly two and a half hours before he had to be in the team meeting room for their pre-match briefing and checks. He really hoped Miranda had help behind the bar.
Harry stood at the bottom of the stairs, rocking slightly and cooing to the baby in his arms. "Why yes, Dumpling, Papa is going to be very late for his lunch with Auntie Pansy." He heard Draco coming down the stairs, but ignored him in favour of continuing. "What was that?" He leaned closer to the baby as if she was actually speaking to him. "Oh I'm not sure I should be the one to tell him Auntie Pansy has already Floo-called three times looking for him." Harry lifted the bundle to his shoulder. "Yes, Dumpling, she certainly was more and more strident with each call."
They'd also produced a beautiful catalogue full of large colour photographs of each sculpture, Draco spent his lunch hour poring over each one, making himself hold off in suspense to get to Lot 121, "Blue Dragon Mother with White Baby". He turned the page, and nearly wept when he saw
Draco frowned, putting real effort into looking cross. "The wizarding world is my past, Pans, I need to learn to live in the present… as a Muggle. Okay?"
The thought terrified him, and Draco rubbed his forehead, nearly hyperventilating in alarm. "What the hell is she playing at?" Draco muttered aloud. "I can't afford to take the little twit to a place like that and there's no way I'd allow her to pay." He made a decent wage, but there wasn't enough left over to afford tea at The Goring. At least his position required him to wear a suit and he managed to keep the two he had looking decent. Maybe he could splurge on a new tie, he thought and then immediately wanted to slap himself for even caring a tiny bit how he might look.
Harry scowled, "Of course I remember, you never let me forget." He sighed. "I was upset because there was no milk."
Harry laughed. Damn but Draco loved the sound of his laughter. He laughed more now than he had when they were younger, and Draco often thought he'd earned every one of the moments of levity the hard way. He ran his hands up Harry's strong back, fingers sinking into the muscles on either side of his spine.
were capable of performing Legilimency, let alone spelling it, but he strengthened his Occlumency shields to be on the safe side.
Harry’s head jerked up, and standing just behind Twilford Mordach was the elegant and so much taller Draco Malfoy. He was wearing beautiful silvery crepe robes that matched his eyes and clung to all of his wonderful hills and valleys, and standing there he looked like a royal, peering down at all of his minions. Gods, Harry wanted to be a minion, on his knees, right there in front of Draco with his head… His cock twitched and Harry hoped the tailored slacks that showed off his arse to such nice advantage weren’t showing off his half hard cock.
"You should know by now there's not much on this earth I wouldn't do to make you happy, Draco. But maybe this shows you." Harry's voice was tender and filled with love.
Draco sighed and crossed his arms. He scowled. "I really hate it when you're practical and reasonable. I'd much prefer you to simply be on my side in this and go tell my mother she's gone 'round the twist!"
and had just moved on with his life, never to be seen again, and without even giving him a chance to help him.
"Of course," she said with a sudden grin. "But be advised I will throw it out there when I can. It's a bit fun to know even you, who was raised by the manners czar, is capable of an etiquette blunder." She continued over his protest. "However, putting that aside, it's well and good that Saint Potter is
She sputtered, but Harry put his hand on her arm and shook his head. "I'm fine," he forced himself to tell Ron stoutly. "Honestly, why should I care?"
The afternoon turned out to be particularly frustrating and busy. The kind of frustrating and busy that could only happen on a Friday afternoon when all Draco wanted to do was go home.
Draco gave her a derisive look. She knew Pansy wasn't his wife; Philippe had got coffee with them more than once. "You're hilarious."
"Oh, that was attractive," she teased, even as she began to laugh herself. "I'm totally sure he wants to jump a man who makes that noise."
Harry knew what he was talking about before his eyes found the portrait near the footboard. It had changed, like many of the other things on the tapestry.
Draco had apparently got on with his life. He'd become a grown-up while Harry had been dashing around on a broom, playing a game. All of Hermione's lectures ran through his head. Like it or not, he was a grown-up adolescent, stuck in time while his friends got on with becoming adults.
"That's a load of Hippogriff shit and you know it," Draco replied, with a bored glance out the door. "I despair for the future of the Auror department. And as much fun as
The more he'd talked to Holden and Beecham, the less he felt he knew. They hadn't told him dick except they were given an order to bring Draco Malfoy into holding and to question him about his job. The annoying part was they couldn't, or wouldn't, tell Harry who had given the order. Harry was the bloody Deputy Head Auror; there were only two people above him; Gawain Robards, the Head Auror, and Kingsley, Minister for Magic. And he'd bet every Galleon he had neither one of them had given that order.
Draco snorted. “It’s a pitch, Weasley. The field is cricket.” He paused, staring blearily into the near distance, then shaking his head. “I think. I actually have no fucking idea.” He put a hand to his head, “and shaking my head is a terrible decision.”
He looked at the double framed photograph on his desk. One side was he and Harry on their bonding day. The other was the three of them, Harry, Lily, and himself right before she boarded the train to Hogwarts for the first time. Their beautiful ray of sunshine, who was practically Lily Potter in her looks with her stunning auburn hair and brilliant green eyes. If not for her long slender hands and her penchant for sarcasm, Draco might have wondered if he actually did have anything to do with her creation.
Darian laughed when he came back, a can of Coke in one hand, a small vial in the other, and the bag of chips hanging from a corner between his teeth. He handed Harry the vial and then tossed the crisps into his lap.
"Young man, you're going to be old before your time," the sweet old woman said to Malfoy as she came even with him in the aisle. "Here. Live a little." She handed him a cardboard coffee cup Harry hadn't even noticed her carrying, he'd been so busy reminding himself that being attracted to Malfoy was a 'very, very bad idea'. Malfoy looked up at her in what almost appeared to be alarm, then reached out gingerly and took the cup from her hand.
"Yes!" She all but shouted in his ear. "This is the best news ever!! I was hoping Wood would pull his head out of his arse and talk to Preston about you! "
She laughed. "Very clearly. It was a mess. Fortunately, we were behind silenced bed curtains so no one in the dorms could hear us laughing hysterically."
Harry shrugged. "I told them if they didn't clear out and come back tomorrow in small groups, you'd tell the staff Lily wasn't allowed visitors."
"Enough!" he snapped, after the third request for a drink. "It's well past your bedtime, so you can just close your eyes and go to sleep."
"Good morning, love." She reached out with a gnarled, arthritic hand and patted his cheek. He caught the hand in his and pressed a soft kiss to her knuckles, and she beamed at him.
He swallowed, his throat painfully dry, and nodded which hurt like a bitch. “Yes.” Speaking was easier, but not by much.
'Harry,' he wrote, 'Please pick up my work robes from McMillian's this afternoon. I'm working a mid-shift and then have a meeting with department heads at four, and need to have them in time for our annual inspection tomorrow.  The address is right here on the front page in the advert in the lower right-hand corner, next to the article about the crystal dragons.
Beecham looked like all his holiday wishes had been granted. He stood and walked over to Draco. "Open your mouth."
the argument coming. "And before you say one damn word about how you're not a charity case or a wizard, just shut up and let me do this for you. You've protected me my whole life and now it's my turn to do something for you!"
He was about to refill his glass, when a noise that sounded like a door closing made him stop. Setting the bottle carefully on the table next to his glass, Draco rose. He looked around the room for a weapon, but decided that was stupid. If another wizard was coming for him, they'd AK him before Draco could blink an eye. Instead, he moved close to the doorway and listened, positive he could hear the quick clip of stiletto heels on the marble floor. It was a sound as familiar to him as breathing and his heart lifted even though he couldn't believe it could be true. A moment later a voice rang out.
Pansy stormed into the back office, throwing a bag of croissants on the desk. Just who the fuck did that numpty Alastor Oppenbottom think he was! "Really, Draco," she mocked his gratingly nasal tone at a mannequin wearing a Holyhead Harpies jacket, "'if you're going to have help could you at least have someone who knows the products? Big tits alone won't bring you more sales.'"
Bugger, Draco thought to himself. He had intended to get around to that question, but now would have to wait for a few questions to pass before he could inquire.
Charlie set the bottle on the table. "He's holding his own. This isn't the first serious burn case we've had, and he knows his way around this type of injury. He'll monitor the kid pretty much twenty-four – seven for the next few days. Draco won't trust any of his assistants with this. It's the way he is."
"I bet you just hate all the attention," Draco retorted, his voice coming out more smug than he intended.
Out of sympathy for poor, blushing Potter, Draco's chuckles eventually slowed. "Let me get you some tea, Potty."
Draco did know. Most people at Hogwarts knew the main story, the gist of what had happened. But even though there was plenty of speculation, distaste and controversy regarding Harry Potter after the incident, not everyone had turned on him. He had overheard countless students (particularly Gryffindors) bitch and moan about how they missed the presence of Potter, about how the incident wasn't entirely his fault. He had observed the defense some students would jump to whenever someone spoke ill of Potter's name. Even some of the newspaper articles outlining the scandal would give Potter the benefit of the doubt, with the exception of Rita Skeeter's articles. She milked the incident for all it was worth. Bottom line: Not all the attention Harry had gotten from the incident was negative, and something about that both relieved and bothered Draco.
, her feet resting on a pile of catalogues on Draco's desk and a cup of black coffee levitating by her side. The latest copy of
Make a scene? Harry looked between them, saw the dangerous gleam in little Twilford’s eyes. Ah, apparently the short man had approached them with that thought in mind. Harry managed to swallow a sigh.  He’d brought this on himself, and apparently his plan had worked. He’d just made the wrong man jealous, and now he had to figure out a way to deal with it.
Draco blinked. "Well, I hadn't," he finally said. "And, I want to. So, I uhm, I'm going to go do that, right now, in the bedroom."
Draco sighed. "You do if you're the Healer on staff and you're trying to run a diagnostic on your patient."
"So coarse," he grumbled. "Custis is a wonderful cook, mind you. I just wish Ms Bergstom's sensibilities were a bit more refined. Now, allow me to show you my supply of queen-sized mattresses." He gave Harry a secretive look. "And I give players a twenty percent discount."
"I don't know, Miss Camélia," Ava said, watching Draco, her own eyes suspiciously bright. "It's a bit late for dessert…"
Draco rolled his eyes. "We got together a few times. Satisfied? Or do you need all the sordid details? Whose prick is bigger? Does he like a little teeth when I blow him?"
Draco slipped his hand down, linking their fingers. "You take a deep breath, and you decide that it's his flaw, not yours."
Just over two hours into the match, Appleby was ahead and Harry had just spotted the Snitch. If he could grab the little winged bastard he could end the match and snatch the win, sending Wimbourne home and ending their season. He lay flat along the line of his broom, speeding toward the base of the rings at Appleby's end of the pitch. The little ball caught the golden sunlight in its descent, and Harry reached out with his right hand, clutching his broom with his left. Sweat blew back off his face and into his hair, and his broom shuddered as he urged it ever faster. He was mere feet off the ground when the Snitch shot straight up and Harry tore after it, his hand extended, the wings on the little ball beating against his fingers. He made the grab and the Snitch struggled in his grasp as he shot his fist triumphantly into the air. Appleby's crowd roared as Harry went into a showy barrel roll, doing a pass over the stands with the golden ball in his hand.
Something calculating entered Darian's expression. "I'll pay you if you help me get her in my chair."
Harry nodded. "And Ludo Bagman, for all of his faults, still has a pretty good inside track with the professional Quidditch leagues."
If possible, Barnes' cheeks became redder. "Well you see, Auror Malfoy, the guys thought it would be funny to hide my wand and I'm trying to get them to tell me where it is. Sir."
"Can't bringing Quidditch fans enjoyment be meaningful? And do you have any idea why Ron didn't Floo me this morning?"
Draco laughed. "Good thing Mother wasn't out there. She'd have marched right down here, rules be damned. She's taking a Portkey from Provence in a few days. I think she wants you settled at home before she arrives."
"Interesting," Harry replied, schooling his features. "Did you know Draco Malfoy is the Healer there?" He watched a faint blush rise onto Hermione's cheeks. "You did know," he accused, pointing with his fork.
"I'll tell you later," Harry muttered to Darian, standing up. Darian stood too and grabbed his arm before he could turn away, and Harry stared into his eyes.
Harry knew it was coming; he wasn't even surprised. But as Stewart went on talking about 'avoidable risks' and 'quality of life', he scarcely heard him. All he could think was, 'what the fuck do I do
Pansy gasped and began to cry. "Oh Draco! No! It can't be. They have to be wrong." She pulled Draco close and wept on his shoulder. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What can I do, honey? Who should I call?"  She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, she had to be strong for her dearest friend. She could do this for him.
. Harry'd managed to keep his own relationships, if you wanted to call a blow job in a bar loo a relationship, to Muggles who had no idea who the hell he was. But from the moment Draco appeared next to the bus, he'd irritated the shit out of Harry, and made him want to push him down across the tattered bus seat and muss him up good 'n' proper in equal measure. Which was simply not on.
"What?" She put the bottle back in the cabinet. "Harrods won't miss it. Now, vaults, goblins. I'm waiting with baited breath."
"I'm Healer Edward Stewart," the handsome man said, settling on the stool. He offered his hand with a brilliant smile, and Harry shook it, a bit bemused. A chart flew off the wall and into his hands. "So, you arrived here nearly four weeks ago under a mighty stasis charm with a raft of injuries. Scrapes, bruises, cuts, a couple of broken ribs, suspected concussion, and a dislocated shoulder. Nasty, but relatively easy to manage." He paused momentarily and Harry noticed his smile falter. "Much more concerning was a very serious and forceful trauma to your lower spine, compromising the spinal structure itself."
Draco had honestly been expecting it; they were both young and healthy, and he was fairly certain sexually active, although he didn't dwell on that. Maybe it was a bit sooner than he'd anticipated, but he wasn't completely surprised by the news. When his eyes cut to his husband's, he could see Harry hadn't been expecting it at all, however. He was blindsided.
Scowling, she slapped the magazine onto the desk. "Do not for a moment think that this conversation is over, Draco Malfoy." She stared defiantly at him.
Draco knew it was time to stop Pansy's rant before she built up steam. "Pansy, for the love of Merlin! Let Hermione come in.
"Could you lower your voice a bit?" Harry hissed. "I'm not going to know until I open it and frankly, I'd rather not do that in the middle of the Leaky. Merlin knows, it'll be splashed across the front page of
. Even when they were firing hexes at one another, Harry had made sure he aimed to disarm, not hurt. Well, except for that one time.
"Yes." Her tone could have frozen meat. "If you intend to return to the wizarding world when your sentence is finished, you need take into consideration that you will live the rest of your life as a Malfoy. Unless you've changed your mind and intend to let your rightful place and legacy be stolen from you along with everything else."
"You were in fifth year, which made me a silly little third year, beneath notice. My family had come to your Christmas Eve party, and when we arrived at the Manor you and your parents were standing on the grand landing."
"Pans," Draco implored, "this one was different." He recapped the beginning of the fight. "She told me
Harry's eyes took on a faraway look for a moment. "I'm an extraordinarily lucky man. By rights, they should have dumped my arse. But I am glad they didn't."
Harry tried to glare at him in the mirror, but was fairly certain he failed. "Don't push your luck."
A bell rang in the room and Draco stood. "I need to give my patient his pain potion." Harry could see his hesitation and wondered if Draco would ask him to leave. Instead, Draco bent down and kissed Harry lightly on the mouth. "Will you wait for me? I'll be about twenty minutes."
Harry studied him, eyes wide in surprise. "It's alright. I'd wondered if all that old snark was gone."
"Easy, sweetheart," Darian said, leaning forward, almost as if he could sense the sudden pounding of his heart. Or maybe there was a monitor—Harry attempted to look around, but his neck was too stiff to turn far. He tried to fight it and a rapid beeping grew in volume from somewhere behind him. If that was his heart, surely it was too fast.
Tonight, if Draco wasn't mistaken, it was Rugby, Coventry playing Rosslyn Park. At least the Rugby players were hot, with their thighs like tree trunks and their broad shoulders. It was supposed to rain tonight, too, which meant there would be mud. For some reason, Draco found the players even sexier with their faces streaked with mud. Harry told him that made him a bit of a kink freak, but he liked it.
Deon looked at Charlie, but Harry caught his wink. "See, I told you the man wanted in my pants. And here you are offering me up like the fatted calf."
There were several weighted, silent seconds, and Harry finally looked up into Draco's searching eyes when he didn't immediately move to disembark. "What?"
Draco tried to keep his tongue, the little voice inside his head— that sounded so much like Professor Snape it startled him— told him to keep his tongue, but Draco was tired, hungry and quite fed up with the entire situation.
"Miranda Lowry Bergstrom," she said briskly, "Proprietor of the Iron Lantern, finest pub in Appleby."
"Ask. I know you want to." Hermione gave him a slight smile. "You all but turn yourself inside out every time a blond man walks by; you aren't terribly subtle, Harry." He felt a wave of panic, and he looked quickly towards the men's loo. "Oh, relax, she said, waving a bit expansively with her hands, the only outward indication that she might have had a bit too much to drink, too. "Ron doesn't even think to look for that."
"You could have given me the joggers last night when we got back here," Harry complained, pulling the shapeless pants over his feet.
Harry stood to the side, watching Draco as he worked on Rhet. He'd never seen anyone look so damn sexy waving a wand. Draco cast spell after spell, his wand arm moving in seemingly endless dance of motion.
He stared at her for a long time. "If I agree to this, you have to take the mobile I gave you, and you have to check in with me every night."
"Oh no, Draco Malfoy. I know you and frankly I don't trust you. If there's not something on the line, I don't trust that you'll actually talk to Potter when you discover it really is him." She pursed her lips and hummed. "Let's see. Not money, neither of us needs any. A priceless possession? A 'no questions asked' favour?" She clapped her hands together. "I've got it! I'll come along with you."
"It doesn't matter to me," Draco said firmly. "I don't love her less because she's not shown any signs of magical ability. I've lived as a Muggle for nearly ten years. I have no problem with continuing to live without magic for my daughter." He was glad his face remained neutral and his voice firm. It really didn't make a difference to him if his daughter was a Squib. He would raise her as a Muggle and he would be certain every opportunity was available to her.
"It means you're entitled to not a god-damned thing," Adam, the bartender snarled. "Now move along before I call Old Bill on you."
A dirty chuckle came from the level of Draco's navel. Instead of responding, Harry pushed his tongue into the small indentation, and Draco gasped, tugging sharply on Harry's hair.
"I cannot tell you," Narcissa went on blithely, "the number of gay men I have known who have lived many years in happy marriages with their wives. They may not have the most active sex lives in the world, but they have affection, and companionship, and once the business of getting an heir is out of the way, there is nothing preventing both of you from discreetly taking your pleasure elsewhere." Draco pulled the phone away from his ear and stared at it. Who was he talking to?
Pansy held up her hand to stop him and turned to Philippe. "Draco's about to tell you that if he's family enough to be given this house, then he's family enough for the old rules to apply." She turned to Draco. "Did I get that right?"
Harry sprawled on his ugly old couch wondering if he should get in touch with Gin, but quickly decided against it.
Draco looked down into his daughter's shining, bright blue eyes. She wasn't old enough yet to try to play jaded and 'cool' the way the older kids did, and her excitement showed clearly in her large smile and her pink cheeks.
He slipped into a pair of fitted black jeans and a long-sleeved dark green shirt, and even wore black boots instead of his usual trainers. He imagined Hermione's reaction when he came through the door not only dressed up, but with Draco's doppelganger on his arm. He smirked at his reflection and scooped up his jacket on his way out the door.
"Think about it," Draco said, voice thick. "She's four and a half, and not once has she shown one sign of magic. Nothing."
Harry had to agree. It was a portrait done in embroidery floss, but it was remarkably life-like. And so much would have to change for Draco to have the humour in his eyes that Darian had naturally.
The thrill of his victory faded. He tossed his mobile on the table and went to find something to eat.
Draco felt a bit as if he'd taken a Bludger between the eyes, but he couldn't, wouldn't back down now. "I do," Draco whispered. "I have, for a long time." He cleared his throat. "What are you doing now?"
"Shut up," he muttered, shooting a dark look towards Pansy. She had crossed her long legs and one of her feet was bouncing in its high heel. He knew if he looked at her face she'd be smirking, so he didn't.
"And you're checking with me and not your dad because?" Draco's tone was sceptical. "What aren't you telling me?"
"What are you doing here," Draco repeated, unable to come up with one of the biting, sarcastic comments he might have made years before. He just didn't have it in him any longer. He'd just been caressing the man's scarf, and now here he was standing on his doorstep.
Draco watched Potter's changeable eyes, and there was nothing but sincerity in them.  He huffed softly. "I'll try if you will." He'd been thinking about Potter so much since his injury and subsequent disappearance from wizarding society. Hoping that he wasn't too late and Potter wasn't planning to do something stupid like leave the country entirely.
Ron, who had wandered back to them, pulled Hermione under his arm. "Leave the man alone, Hermione, alright? He's tired, and nothing can be gained from beating this dead horse."
When it came time to leave and Pansy picked up her handbag, idly leaving the paper on the table, Draco leaned across and snatched it, slipping it into an inside pocket of his long overcoat.
Draco shrugged. "Not much more than we already know. Lily is healthy, the baby is progressing nicely. Lily is a bit underweight for being in her fifteenth week, but that could be due to morning sickness," he glared as Harry began to interrupt, "and that abated in her eleventh week. She's even added about 1.6kg. Cho has her coming in every two weeks to monitor her weight."
There were high moments in those dragging days; the day after coffee with Potter, a huge arrangement of flowers arrived at his door. He was pleased by the gesture, blushing furiously when Ava came through, arching her eyebrow with a teasing smile. As he studied the artful arrangement, his little pure-blood heart lifted: he'd been forced to study the meaning of flowers by his mother, and apparently Potter had put some serious thought into what he chose. Red, orange and white roses: red for love, orange for passion—he felt his face heat when Ava touched one with a knowing smile—and white for new beginnings. Mixed in were multi-coloured asters, for patience. Separate from the huge mixed bouquet in a lovely crystal vase was a small white box. When Draco opened it, he found a single white gardenia on mossy dark green leaves. Gardenias symbolised a secret love, and joy.
"Astoria did finally figure it out and offered to begin seeing a Muggle midwife. Her mother had an absolute fit at the idea. I'm afraid if I don't somehow find a way to fix this, my mother will AK Simone on sight."
Harry dropped his head into his palms and shook his head. "Completely barmy, I tell you," he mumbled into his hands. He slowly lifted his head. "Where do you get this, Hermione?"
Oliver slung his arm around Harry's shoulder, turning him towards Appleby's locker room. "I did." He laughed. "Harry Potter the giant killer, yeah? Let's all get cleaned up and go check on Hagenstack."
"I was in her room looking for her slippers, and she was out the door. And apparently into your room."
"On some level I'd like to have the Malfoy name not be looked down upon, but I'm still not convinced that this is the way to achieve that."
Harry's smile faded and he gave his husband an irritated look. "Draco Potter-Malfoy, you promised her."
Harry chuckled wryly, remembering how he'd dreamt up ways to get out of talking to Healer Bernard at all. Evaluations be damned. The first thing he'd considered was switching teams. Surely, another team in the league would pick him up. Darian kiboshed that scheme very quickly, informing him that any team with a decent acquisitions solicitor would require him to undergo an evaluation before agreeing to take him on; particularly after the article in the papers.
"Okay," Harry agreed rather weakly. Facing up to this mess probably would be easier with food in his stomach. Did he eat the night before? He couldn't remember.
When he landed in his living room Harry looked around, a bit surprised to find himself there. He hadn't made the conscious choice to go there, which showed exactly how distracted he was; he knew not to Apparate when he didn't have his wits about him. He was just so damn frustrated!
Harry didn't think he'd ever felt the truth of the phrase, 'the agony of waiting' before like he did that early morning. He rubbed his hand over his jaw, felt the fact he needed a shave, felt the faint tremor in his hand. It was fatigue, he knew it. They all looked completely fagged out, eyes too wide and staring, standing in clumps or pacing.
Hermione glanced over to the corner, taking in the bright orange, green and pink paisley shirt, and couldn't seem to swallow a snort. It appeared Molly and Darian were discussing her hair, and he was standing behind her, sifting his fingers through her grey-streaked mop and talking to her earnestly.
"Sidlenhurst," Darian answered. "The kid filling in for their regular Beater. He was clear across the pitch and I believe him when he says he couldn't see the Snitch in your hand."
Draco rolled his eyes. "How else do you imagine the theatre could be used, Potter? There's a show playing here every other night of the week. Fortunately, the owner is a wizard and offered the use of the place tonight to the organisation."
A rusty stain spread over Draco's cheeks and blotched the smooth skin of his neck. He muttered something, staring down at the wet seat.
"Thank you, Molly." He kissed her, then leaned around to catch Arthur's hand. "Alright, everyone, formal introductions, then." Harry took a step back, standing shoulder to shoulder with Darian. "Weasley's, this is Darian the hair wizard," Darian elbowed him in the side and Harry ducked away from him. "Darian, my family," Harry said proudly. "My mum, Molly, Dad, Arthur, and Ron and Hermione."
"Darling, you can keep your domestic bliss. And as for the regular sex…well you have been out of the loop, haven't you?" She grinned slyly.
She held out her horned, clawed foot, a thick purple envelope with gold script across the front. Draco saw his name, accompanied only by the word 'Official', in smaller lettering beneath it. He took it from the bird, then gave its head one last, lingering stroke. "Thank you," he murmured. With a regal dip of its head as if understanding the situation plainly, the owl turned and flew back out the open window.
Draco covered his face with one hand, laughing weakly. "Not particularly." He reached down into the pocket of his coat, withdrawing the ragged scarf and putting it between them on the table. "You dropped it," he whispered, "the day of my trial. I tried to call you back, but you were already gone." He sighed. "That's not entirely true. You weren't that far off yet—I don't know why I kept it, but…" He rested his hand on it. "It's been a comfort to me, more than once. Obviously." He shrugged sheepishly. "And if you think it's weird…"
Harry made a soft, inarticulate noise and shifted, his big hands curling around Clare's small body before his long thick lashes fluttered, and he blinked his eyes open. He checked to see if the baby was still asleep, then became aware of Draco leaning on the back of the couch, watching him. The delight that filled his green eyes was the most flattering thing Draco had seen in a very long time.
"Draco Malfoy," His mother's patience had clearly reached an end, "This conversation has reached an end. You will marry her."
"Harry, please," Harry responded automatically. People who called him 'Mr Potter' more often than not had a Ministry logo on their robes, and encounters with them weren't high on his list. He thought it was a good thing the only Ministry hacks he'd seen in the last few months were Ron and Hermione and they only counted on the edges.
Narcissa was over by the casket, crying as she placed a hand on his cold cheek. Lucius has come up behind her and awkwardly rubbed her back, trying to sooth her. But what shocked Draco was that Lucius Malfoy, his father who used him as a tool for the Dark Lord, had tears in his eyes. Now that, was the most shocking thing at this funeral.
Petals fell out of his mouth and he got up, Narcissa helping him to the kitchen sink since it was the closest.
"Actually, everyone is doing better. Mum's illness got worse right after the war but she's slowly getting better. Father- Lucius, wasn't put in Azkaban like he deserves, it's where he should rot, in my opinion. But, back to what I said I was here for." Draco's small smile fell down as the flowers inside tightened.
The two froze upon seeing them at the table, Narcissa and Molly smiled while Hermione and Ron glared.
Those words caused the most pain to her husband who pulled her into an embrace. He knew he needed to change, but he was so fixated on being the best Malfoy. Acting like a Malfoy. Being a Malfoy. That was how he was raised, not to show emotion and be cold. He didn't know what a normal childhood was like, he didn't really know the meaning of happiness and have only felt it five times, but they were all very short as he began to lock those memories up.
"I don't know." Draco sighed and continued, "Maybe go visit Harry's grave. Spoil Harriet, bet she'd love that." Draco smiled a bit, he could already see his golden retriever jumping around with her tail wagging at immense speed.
Harry walked forward and grabbed his hand, touching the Death Eater Mark that was still on his forearm. "I'm glad. Cmon! Let's go have fun!" Harry suddenly beamed up at him as he rolled Draco's sleeve back down.
In the living room of the Malfoy Manor was; the Weasley Family, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Pansy, and Blaise.
"Here. I found this under his pillow." Lucius handed her a letter that she took into her hand. She saw names written on the front in her son's elegant signature. Harriet could smell her owner's scent coming from it, and walked over, whining.
"Hey Harry." He said, voice shaky and weak. The blonde gulped down his nerves, he was talking to him, just a slab of stone, yet he needed to get this out and make it feel as if he spoke to him. "Or Potter, should I say." Draco let out a dry chuckle."Pottah, that better?" He joked, listening to the wind and birds, even the trees rustling in the distance, including the students heading to their new class.
"Apologize for all the bullsh*t I did to you and your friends. But before that, Hermione and the Weasley got engaged. Not surprising really. George is doing better, yet when he eats he is silent it's honestly very creepy." A small laugh left his mouth, remembering the first time he had gone to the Weasley's to eat dinner with them. George definitely was silent, it really did creep Draco out since he has grown used to hearing his loud voice while eating back at Hogwarts.
"No, it's Harriet. Don't worry, when Draco named her I had the same reaction!" Narcissa smiled and that made Ron sink back down in his seat, and Hermione grabbing his hand to comfort him.
Draco scoffed, he remembered the time Harry looked so annoyed with fans swarming him. It was obvious he disliked being The Boy Who Lived. Which was true, Harry only wanted a normal childhood where he wasn't always in danger and almost dying every fifteen seconds. No matter how much Harry loved magic, he often wished he was a muggle in a better family than the Dursley's. He always wished he could escape this "nightmare" and have his parents alive. They definitely seemed way better than the Dursley's, even if he had never met them, he was still heartbroken.
Narcissa and a few others had put Draco in therapy. And luckily the Therapist was helping him, slowly, which is good. If it was fast, that would probably be concerning. But his therapist gave a list of many ways that could help! Narcissa had found the list three years ago, and had surprised him with a little golden retriever puppy! She remembers when Draco was a little boy, they would pull out a few muggle toys! Of course that only happened when Lucius was at work, and they could only play with them for a little bit. But his favorite toy was a golden retriever plushie.
"At least this is calmer than my funeral." The spirit of Harry suddenly appeared, a few meters behind him. Draco was even more shocked as well, but as Harry extended out a hand for Draco to come and take, he looked back at his mother, he didn't feel like leaving entirely. But one sentence helped him.
"Right," Harry mumbled, reason catching up to him. "I guess I should've chose a different flat to hide out in."
This didn't sit well with Harry. Because Draco's laugh was oddly sweet, like melted honey, contrasting sharply with his general sour personality. The sound emitting from his mouth didn't at all sound like his crude, hasty laughs back at Hogwarts. It was something new. Draco's laugh was, to Harry's shock and horror, pretty.
Harry took the stairs down to the back, where the pool was located. Harry came to a halt in front of the pool, and proceeded to pace back in forth for awhile, wondering how he would endure living next door to Malfoy of all people. He had already endured it for two months, sure, but at least he hadn't been aware of it. Now, each and every time Harry heard the sound of that piano starting up, he would know that music was being made by Draco Malfoy. He would have the uncanny interaction, the unwelcome conversation they'd shared sealed in his brain like glue.
"Potter, wait. I wasn't going to-" Draco uttered. The sound was weak, pleading, enticing. But Harry couldn't give into it. It was fake, it was a trick to get him to stay. Harry pushed away the part of him with no sense, the part of him that thought Malfoy suddenly cared about him for some reason. The part of him that, disturbingly enough, wanted Malfoy to care.
"It's also unfortunate that Slytherins fail to see that their pureblood cult practices aren't so tasteful after five straight hours."
"It's my way of saying that these past two months have given me some time to reflect. But that's neither here nor there, Potter. Anyway, I didn't buy this piano originally. It had been left behind by the previous owner when I moved in, with an unsigned note saying it was a gift from them to me, that I would need it."
And Draco continued to surprise not only Harry but himself with the next words that tumbled out of his mouth. "And... maybe... maybeyoucouldcomeinforasecond? Just to come to an understanding regarding the piano?"
"Well, I told you that it wasn't my intention to interrupt your Gryffindor man brooding time. But, putting intentions aside, it is unfortunate that Gryffindors seem to have no taste in music."
Harry's eyes widened. Draco couldn't blame him. It was strange, that he had been neighbors with Harry Potter for nearly two months and neither of them had realized until now. On the other hand, Draco didn't leave his apartment much, aside from shifts at work and occasional grocery trips. Leaving his apartment meant leaving his piano, and Draco tried to do that as little as possible. Now that he thought about it, it wasn't too big of a coincidence that he hadn't crossed paths with Harry until now.
"So, this is your fortress of doom," Harry commented, observing the walls, painted over with a thick black. Odd. Long before Harry left Hogwarts for good, he had heard a group of Slytherins complain that Draco filled the walls of the Slytherin dormitory with trophies and Malfoy family heirlooms, leaving little space left. Conceited behavior, as expected from a Malfoy. Why didn't he bring any of that junk here?
Harry wanted to push it, to satisfy his curiosity, but the look in Malfoy's eyes told him it was best to leave it, for now. Not that he cared about Malfoy's feelings. He just didn't want to waste time. He was only here to settle the piano business.
Harry blinked. The chaos was gone. He was back in present time, in the pool, not in that lake. He was okay. Except in all the ways that he wasn't.
Harry knew he was right, that Ron and Hermione had been searching for his address, searching for a way to contact him. But that was none of Draco Malfoy's business. "You don't know. You don't know the details or what really happened sixth year. You don't know shit. And why do you even care?" Harry yelled, the words coming out louder and harsher then he'd intended.
