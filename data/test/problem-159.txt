,” Malfoy paused for a few seconds, and then looked a little bit uncomfortable as he continued, in a low voice, “to tell you the truth, you looked pretty bad, there was quite a lot of blood and you weren’t responding. I merely helped Patrick bring you here, that’s all.”
Was he making a
Malfoy looked up, startled out of his thoughts, and there was a flash of something in his eyes as he took in Harry’s presence: his fitted black jacket and trousers – albeit a tad wrinkled and the topmost button of his jacket open – completed with dragonhide boots, a bit muddy but sturdy. Quickly, whatever emotion had been on Malfoy’s face was extinguished and the corner of his mouth turned into a mocking smile that Harry didn’t much appreciate. “Stylish, I can always count on you looking like you’ve woken up from a ditch somewhere,” Malfoy scoffed and stood up, straightening his trousers.
Then there was Mr Mulpepper's voice, he cleared his throat,
The sun was already high, and it was burning Harry’s back as he walked the now steady street. As he was admiring the houses to his left, he caught a glimpse of the glimmering sea in between the buildings. He hadn’t realized how high he was on the mountain, and couldn’t resist the urge to cross the boulevard and walk in between the houses, just to get a better look of the stunning view that was now unfolding itself in front of him. Harry went down some steps he knew he would have to go up again, and stopped to stand on a platform, not able to take his eyes off the brightly flickering water. The coast curved on his left to form a bay filled with large yachts and ships, the beach shimmering with white sand and dotted with colourful sunshades. It was breathtaking, nothing like he’d ever seen before.
“What’s the matter, Potter? Never seen the Dark Mark before?” Malfoy’s icy voice pierced the warm spring air, making Harry flinch. He had already forgotten about the whole thing, and hadn’t seen Malfoy’s forearm from that far away, but him being upset about the Dark Mark was a better alternative to what actually made him flustered, so he decided to go with that.
, the latter at least would just be a blatant lie. He wanted to think it was because the Dursley’s treated him like shit, so he didn’t want to do that to others – that way maybe he could have found something good out of living with them, but he didn’t think that that was the real reason. He had just always been like that, it was common courtesy for fuck’s sakes, treating others with respect.
Harry was feeling a bit nostalgic, and couldn’t help himself from saying, “You know I just want you to be happy, even with how things ended between us, or because of it.”
Even though he wanted to be by Draco’s side that morning, and through the hearing, Harry had to be at the Ministry early to oversee Lucius’ transfer, and was already leaving, albeit grudgingly, when Draco started to get out of bed. It had been two weeks since Harry had visited Azkaban, and he felt that a lot of things had happened in quite the short amount of time since then. Hell, a lot of things
Hermione shrugged. “I’m good, not feeling sick all the time anymore so that’s a refreshing development, though now I’m just hungry all the time.” Good thing they were going out to eat then. They now stepped onto the chilly street, it wasn’t windy, but the overcast clouds were persistent in their greyness and the ice-cold drizzle that they produced.
“Right then, I’ll be back with the results about this profile, until then I’d recommend you organize this junk pile you call an office.” Before Harry could raise his eyebrows at Evergrey, the man was already off. Patrick Evergrey was an Auror in his thirties, not much older than Harry, with a lovely wife and two young kids, Harry thought that if he was ever in his shoes, he’d seek employment from a more risk-free career. He now turned to the unholy mess that was his office.
The whole of Tuesday Harry spent going through muggle security camera footage, though it took him half a morning to figure out how the blasted apparatus worked, what did they call it? A “DVD” or something, whatever that meant. Harry didn’t find anything from these tapes, and finally gave up. He couldn’t even cast a tracking spell since there was nothing left of the thief in the scene of the crime or the warehouse.
“He agreed,” Harry said immediately, not wanting to keep Draco in suspense for one second longer than necessary.
Suddenly there were many things Harry wanted to say, but apparently his mouth had decided to abandon his brain, and just came out with: “I don’t hate you.” Great, just brilliant. He couldn’t have said something about the inhumanely long shift Malfoy was doing? He just
“Good to know,” Harry nodded, “what’s that you were reading?” he gave a meaningful glance at the huge encyclopaedia lying on the desk.
Narcissa sat down in the armchair Harry had occupied in his previous visit, “What about Draco?” she asked. Harry sat down on the sofa and hoped that she didn’t think he’d come bearing some sort of bad news – surely she had been in touch with her son more than Harry, who had not heard of the man after he had left. He still relived the feeling sometimes. That morning, when he had woken up, he hadn’t remembered it at first, not recalling when he would have slept as soundly as he had. But something in him had remembered, because when he had rolled over in his bed to find it empty, he had had a feeling it shouldn’t be. The sheets hadn’t been warm anymore, but when Harry had all but buried his face into the pillow next to his, he could recognize the fresh smell of pine and citrus: Malfoy. He had wanted to smell the pillowcase all day, maybe forever.
Harry decided to continue. “So, er, as a consequence of this, the production of Veritaserum has been stopped, meaning you’re not going to be interrogated with it,” now that he was sitting in front of Narcissa and hearing himself say the words, he had to cringe internally at what an absolute dickhead he had been for ever requesting it. Narcissa looked visibly relieved and she leaned back in the sofa, letting out a long sigh. “And, I really want to apologize to you, personally, for sanctioning the use of the serum, it was not the right decision to make, and I’m sorry,” Harry said with difficulty, he really felt quite ashamed, he hadn’t even requested it to use on Narcissa, but on their actual suspects that they had in custody. Narcissa was just the unfortunate bystander.
“And it seems that he likes you back,” Hermione was rubbing her chin in thought, without realizing the weight of her statement. She thought he liked Harry back? Right about now the whole thing was turning into a teenage drama.
Evergrey slammed his fist on the table, and the loud sound was magnified in the austere room. “We know about your grandfather, and the Marigold, now tell us…
“If you must,” Malfoy scowled and took a careful sip of his own tea, looking at least as suspicious as a person testing out for poison. His expression looked as if Harry had catered him a cup full of vodka, but for some reason withheld from commenting on it. It was odd to say the least.
perhaps?” he asked. Harry’s eyes widened when he realized what he’d just said. His face went bright red, matching the rose that was now rising on Draco’s cheeks, as he stared at Harry, looking a bit lost despite his sharp remark. An unpleasant, nervous twist made an appearance in Harry’s stomach.
duelled Voldemort?” Malfoy interrupted him with the most bewildered tone Harry had ever heard him use, “At
“Right, ‘course not,” said Harry after a pause, not knowing how to react. Hopefully the self-writing quill managed to compose an appropriate response on the parchment because Harry sure wasn’t able to. He felt like an absolute git for assuming right away that Malfoy was up to something bad – he had been wrong about that before (although, he had also been right about that before).
Kingsley let out a very long sigh, before nodding and turning to Harry. “Fine, you’ve convinced me, but don’t take it as any kind of indication that I am to be manipulated this way in the future,” Kingsley stated very sternly and returned back to sit at his desk.
“Thank you, I’ll help you track down Ridgenorth tomorrow,” Harry said and was just about to start devising a plan to catch the bastard, when he caught a careful glance from Patrick, “what is it now?” He was tired of people not speaking their mind.
“Azkaban is overcrowded, and the public already thinks the Death Eaters should have been neutralized when they were found guilty in their initial trials, it’s a win-win,” Kingsley’s tone had changed into a very stern and official one, his words sounding too rehearsed for Harry to believe that the man could ever have come up with something like this himself. He doubted Kingsley even fully agreed with the plan himself. But the way the Minister said ‘win-win’ made Harry feel like he was going to explode at the spot, taking both of them with him, and half of the floor, too.
“I know what that feels like,” Harry shrugged and looked at Malfoy.
“No, nothing of the sorts,” Harry blurted out, a little too eagerly, “I actually came to tell her that, er, she is no longer a suspect in the case.” Malfoy’s face cleared immediately, and Harry took another deep breath, “but she should stick around, in case we, er, need her as a witness in the case.”
Harry nodded, he was angry. He didn’t know what he had expected, but this was not it. He thought that maybe Malfoy would reject him, make fun of him, and then fuck off. He never imagined that Malfoy would
“Er, thanks,” Harry said and followed on Malfoy’s coattails as he was making his way through the ground floor of the house, first inspecting the living room, and then the kitchen. The man was carefully eyeing all of the rooms and observing all kinds of artefacts in the house, like he was trying to find a clue to why Harry was such an insufferable prat – his words, not Harry’s. A perfect time for him to excuse himself, “Make yourself at home, er, I’m going to go change.”
Now he suddenly woke up with a startle. His chest was damp with sweat, and he threw the blanket aside, the whole room felt hot. Outside the rain was still roaring, and a forceful wave of it made the noise echo throughout the house. Harry was just sitting in his bed for a while, wondering what it was that had woken him up. He cast Lumos and peered at the clock on his wall, it was four in the morning. Way too late to not be sleeping, way too early to be up. Then he heard the sound, his doorbell was ringing. So that’s why he was awake. Harry didn’t even remember having a doorbell.
Finally, Harry had a small window of opportunity, and he wasn’t going to waste it. “I want you to save Lucius Malfoy, I don’t care what you do with him, stick him back to Azkaban for all I care, but don’t kill him,” he demanded steadily. If he could save the life of even one wretched Death Eater, he was going to do it. Frankly, Harry had never thought that he would be in a situation like this, pleading for the life of one of the most deplorable wizards alive, but here he was.
“Oh I know how you feel,” Ginny now rolled her eyes and leaned back in the chair. Harry had forgotten how similar they were.
“I have to say,” Malfoy started after some minutes, “I’ve been waiting to do that for a long time.” His breath was hot in Harry’s neck, and he left some very wet kisses on Harry’s back, before rolling off and reaching for his wand from the side table next to the bed. He cast a soft cleaning charm on both of them.
“Clearly you mean the lovely weather,” Harry chuckled stiffly, inferring to the rain that had taken over London the past few days, and had been prevalent nearly the whole springtime. He tried to divert his attention, in case he had misunderstood Malfoy’s implication.
Easter Sunday at the Weasley’s. The Burrow was as it had always been: full of life. It was exactly how Harry remembered it, packed with people and things. There were pots and pans on the stove stirring themselves, causing the most delicious smells float from the kitchen to the rest of the house. Molly had put up candles everywhere and they created lively shadows dancing behind every object. There was not one thing twice in that house, even all of the dining room chairs were odd. The sun was setting outside, and the Burrow’s cosy warmth and hassle was a welcome contrast to the chilly day Harry had spent alone.
“Fancy a swim?” Malfoy asked, already taking his shoes off, and walking past Harry towards where the sounds of the sea were coming from. Harry shrugged at no one and followed Malfoy, casting Lumos as to not step on anything suspicious, like a sea urchin drifted to the shore. The lights of the promenade illuminated Malfoy’s now naked back. He had already pulled his shirt over his head, and was now unbuttoning his pants. Harry followed suit, and they left their clothes a safe distance away from the water. They were both wading in the waves in their pants, the water still as warm as during the day.
A waiter came to fetch them, and seated the pair near the fireplace, handing them menus. Everything sounded delicious, but Harry knew Hermione was hungry, so he decided to just go for anything she was getting. You can never go wrong with ordering what a hungry pregnant lady was having. Hermione ordered them two portions of fish and chips with side salads and a piece of cake to share, and a hot chocolate for herself. Harry concluded it best not to comment, besides, it all sounded delicious.
back and forth. They then ushered their guests in from the cold, Hermione holding their youngest’s hand while he wobbled inside, large eyes peeking from between his huge coat and his hat, looking around. Ron was carrying a large tote bag filled with presents haphazardly wrapped. “The usual delivery from mum, and from us, of course,” he said as he handed the shipment to Harry.
“Hermione’s right, I can’t tell you,” Harry shrugged and was gaining his appetite back with every bite, “but apparently it’s not anything shady,” he had to add. Truthfully, he hadn’t the faintest clue of what could have possessed Malfoy to make an appearance after all these years.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry nodded, though Malfoy could barely see it. Then there was nothing left to say, and they just sat there again, before lying down, still holding hands, staring at the ceiling. Eventually, and it was impossible to tell to whom of the two it happened first, they fell back asleep.
After that, Harry had been sitting in front of the writing paper on his drawer, staring at the blank page. But no matter how long he tried to compose a letter in his head, it never came out as anything he would dare to owl the man. There was nothing to possibly say to change the situation, and Harry didn’t want to send a letter, leaving himself to wait for a response that might never come. He wasn’t sure whether he should be resigned from the situation, but trying to salvage it seemed like a futile effort, so now he was stuck, dreaming about gold streaked hair and lips so relentless Harry woke up, gasping, with a raging hard on.
Harry grinned, but feigned defeat. “Oh, you’ve persuaded me with your cunning ways, hop on,” he said, and turned his back to Rosie, who climbed aboard expertly.
“Right, right, I can imagine,” Harry just nodded without having a clue what else to say about the subject. Clearly Isabel was a woman of business sense, she seemed very pleasant, and seemed to make George happy, so Harry was happy for him. He didn’t feel jealous of them at all. Not in the slightest.
by Zamira Gulch, that Hermione had gotten him when he moved away from the Burrow. With the book in one hand and his wand in the other, Harry succeeded in performing a much needed deep-cleaning of the house.
“Listen son,” said Hamish MacFarlan Jr., a man in his mid-seventies, and more stubborn than Scot. He was a man of principle, and Harry already knew his head wouldn’t be turned easily. “You better have a hell of a good reason for us to spare that maggot of a wizard, he’s the worst of them all I reckon.” To Harry’s disheartenment, an agreeing murmur swept the room. Why did Lucius have to be such a snake back in the day? It made it all the harder to convince a bunch of politicians to not off him.
court!?” Harry insisted. He’d much rather just wait at home for the demanding knock on his door, although he realized that soon it wouldn’t be a possibility anymore. It was four days until Malfoy’s departure, which meant that Harry would really have to get his shit together.
“Almost?” Harry heard the question escaping his mouth before he could control it. Who was it that didn’t support the proposal?
Maybe he should just see himself straight into the Janus Thickey ward, claim an acute mental disturbance.
they were going to conduct said investigations, but whatever it was, it was bound to be better than sitting in Azkaban, or being dead.
“How foul, go on,” Malfoy had the audacity to say, but his smirk had vanished. Instead, he was furrowing his eyebrows, making him look almost concerned, as if he was capable of being concerned for Harry.
Harry froze, he was sure he had misheard. For some awful reason his heart sped up for a few beats when he heard this. He hated himself for wanting to know more, if he legitimately hated Malfoy, he would have simply claimed he didn’t know what she was talking about and left the scene, never seeing another Malfoy again. But instead, he said, “Er, what do you mean, exactly?”
Malfoy had an amused look on his face that Harry didn’t care for. “Right,” the corner of his mouth turned upwards, “I guess everything can’t always go the way you want it, not even for the Chosen One.”
“Signore Malfoy, you have a visitor!” the man exclaimed and gestured towards Harry, and Harry realized he had never gotten his name, how rude of him. Though right now, little other mattered than the way in which Malfoy’s silvery eyes met Harry’s. Harry’s eyes were locked with his, his palms sweaty and his arm hair risen up in gooseflesh. Even though he had come all this way to see the man, Harry still felt utterly unprepared to actually face him now. Malfoy was carrying a brown grocery bag on his arm, and another, smaller plastic bag in his other hand, but now, he had stopped in his tracks when he had caught sight of Harry.
“Seems that way, yes,” Harry was now pacing around his office, “like I said, keep me updated on the progress with the evidence. Dubois we can prosecute for attacking an Auror, destruction of property, and resisting arrest, for starters. However, all the evidence against Narcissa Malfoy is purely circumstantial for now, so I don’t see a reason to keep her at the Ministry any longer at this point.” Harry wanted to believe that Narcissa was innocent, and it was true that they didn’t have any direct evidence against her. She didn’t seem like a flight risk either, what with her new house and her reunion with dearest Draco.
Harry gave him a very polite smile in return. “Thank you, that was just what I needed to hear,” he turned to his partner, who gave him an impressed nod, “Patrick?”
to tell Harry but was too afraid to? In situations like this Harry wished that he wasn’t an Auror and that he could just turn his speculative thoughts off.
“I know, Hamish,” Harry nodded, and prepared for his first argument, “I hope you’ll still hear me out, and if you don’t mind, I’ll now present my first point of reasoning.” Hamish nodded approvingly, though still seeming to think the whole affair was a waste of his time. Harry cleared his throat nervously, hoping no one noticed the slight tremble in his hands, and then turned his attention to Penelope Jameson, who was sitting closest to him on the left side. She was the Head of the Department of Mysteries, and Harry’s best bet to get his foot in the door. “Penelope,” Harry addressed her, and she looked a tad startled to be talked to directly, “how much does the Department of Mysteries
“All the more reason…” Draco smiled encouragingly, a challenging look in his eyes.
Harry had
Malfoy caught sight of him staring at his face and Harry was sure the git would somehow hex his dick off with his mind, but instead he said quietly “Now, now, Potter, don’t get soppy on me.” Harry was speechless, he had never heard Malfoy so benign, but before he could reply… “Right, let’s do something about this, then.” The man shifted downwards and brushed his palm against Harry’s hard cock, Harry let out a sharp breath.
Harry was left by himself with the vague but unshakable feeling that something within him had fundamentally changed.
It wasn’t long until a waiter returned with two large glasses of red wine, the contents of which would most likely fill any regular glass to the brim, and a bottle of sparkling water, and glasses for each. No later than Harry had tasted the wine, its flavour jumping around in his mouth after the sweetness of their previous drinks, did mister Bianchi arrive with two plates he placed before them. Harry had never seen such pizza before, it was full from the edges, and yellow with cheese from the middle, with only red and green spots here and there, resembling tomatoes and basil leaves, very far from the flat pies they called pizza in England. It was nothing like Harry had tasted, either, the base was crispy, and the flavour of the cheese and the basil filled his mouth with such delight, that Harry almost laughed when he tasted it. His face must have conveyed the expression, because Malfoy gave him a knowing look, and clinked his glass on Harry’s. Now the red wine complemented the flavours wonderfully.
“Do you want to go fly today?” Malfoy asked suddenly. Harry didn't know why it took him by surprise, maybe he hadn’t expected there to be a Quidditch pitch somewhere around here. Was it up in the mountains, away from the muggles? Was it
, Harry thought, he had somehow managed to get himself sent to St Mungo’s. Robards would simply love that – they were understaffed as it was.
“The one,” Hermione replied, “she has agreed to be the defence lawyer for your father in this case, if we ever get that far.” She was still holding a quill in her hand. Ron had finished his slice of tart.
"Do you feel like you need to push?" Harry nodded. "Okay, get on the bed don't lay down. Get on your hands and knees."
He wandered around aimlessly a few hours more, till he couldn’t bare to be away from his children one second more.
The gate squeaked, then shoes positioned themselves outside Harry’s cell.
With a bemused chuckle Harry reluctantly grabbed his plate and headed over to the worn coach that stood in the corner of his tent. With a humph they two sat in comfortable silence as Harry ate. Draco often did this with him, knowing if left on his own he would likely throw out his food.
‘I got you Potter hold on.’
Ron flicked his head back an forth between the two. ‘You fucking barmy Harry! I’m a neutral party. I am not to inter fear in warfare.’ He seethed, turning his back on Harry, and onto Draco. ‘And you! You aren’t actually thinking of going along with this madness.’
"You, haven't pissed yourself. Your waters have broken."
"You, think I wont."
‘Goodbye Harry.’
‘You said we weren’t going to talk about this.’ Harry pleaded.
She gave another self satisfied smirk. "How long did it take him?"
"A what?" Harry stilled.
The two had passed the time catching up on each other’s lives. James showing his dad the new inventions he’d created for the joke shop. Harry knew his son was gifted but to see it channeled into something constructive. Brought him more joy then he could possibly know.
"BLURGH!!!"
Harry wanted to be mad at her, but the truth was. He didn’t have the energy. The fight had left him, when Voldemort had fallen. The houcrox was gone, and so had all that anger that filled him when it still resided there.
"Draco!" He mimicked.
"About, 90 seconds." He gritted through his teeth.
‘Your real!’
Malfoy looked on at Potters hunched form, in concern and confusion. He was taking this rather badly. So, Pansy had neglected to mention to Potter that she was a slut, who got herself pregnant. It was going to hurt he had no doubt about that, but it was like this was the nail in Potter coffin.
Both of them divesting the other of their cloths. Ravenous hands reaching out for each other on the kitchen floor. ‘This is kind of gross’ Harry laughed as he flung a crumb out of her hair.
Classic Mind healer move, letting them waste time till they are ready to speak, so they can rack up the gallons, simply by sitting in silence, before saying their time is up and what a productive session they had, and please do come by next week, that will be a hundred gallons, please see the receptionist on your way out.
"Malfoy-"
Harry had thought of that.
There had been many changes to the city, in the years he had been gone. New shops lined walkways. Old shops had disappeared, strange technology advertised in window displays.
One night. They paid Draco a visit.
He doesn’t feel much like Christmas shopping after that. Deciding to walk home, it not far from where there’s a park nearby that cuts right through to Grimuald.
Looking up at her in disdain. “You won’t get away with this. My friends will figure out what you’ve done.” He stated with conviction.
Shit. Malfoy mind supplied unhelpfully.
The protests became muffled. But that didn't mean they stopped. Then the moans and thrusting started.
Kingsley raised his hands for silence. The crowed simmering down somewhat though still noticeably irritable. "The wizard gamont, though already having come to a verdict, where given a late missive from one Harry Potter. Requesting that the accused be granted amnesty from the death potion." The crowed was signing his impostors praises at this.
Harry turned away and looked at his wall once Malfoy was done.
‘Get some rest Draco. Your in for a rough night.’ He ordered, spelling the area clean, and squgiffing the bloody sheets.
"This isnt right. You and your mother were meant to go free. I. Was going to testify for the both of you. And then that.. That. BITCH! Parkinson. She went and TOOK MY LIFE!" He screamed, slamming his fist into the mattress, plowing a puff of dust into his face.
After that first night it was something the two indulged in after a mission. Though... it had begun to grow to every night, or whenever the mood struck them.
Oh, Draco knew, he stared Harry down nodding.
‘Ah. I thought using parsel tongue might trigger something.’ Harry apologised.
It was dark, and once again Harry found it hard to sleep.He often found himself Sleeping through the day, just to make it go faster. Plus the fatigue that he had been experiencing of late, had thrown his sleeping habits out the barred windows. He often found himself just nodding off while Draco was talking to him. He still hasn't heard the end of that.
"Just answer one question for me." Harry asked. As he watched the apple fall and rise, with a flick of his wrist.
"How. In the name of blast ended skwerts. Would I know? Do I look like I've got them. And that body, was enough to turn me off the female species for good." Malfoys eyes seemed to widen at that. Harry spotting his slip, as his head shot up from touching the two lumps on his chest.
Harry, fell to the floor when he reached his cell. Slamming his fists on the moldy stone, as the cell door clanged shut.
Giving him a beautiful smile.
The truth was, there was only one person he wanted to talk to. One person who knew exactly what he needed.
‘Potter. Take my hand!’ He yelled down the side of the cliff face, where the boy who lived clung onto the rocks for dear life.
"Are you deaf? You've got a visitor. Now, hurry the fuck up, and put your hands on the wall." He boomed. loosing what little temper he had.
Thatch scoffed. "You know I worked in there prison, we never had a single break out. I think I Know how to handle an inmate."
To his credit, Malfoy sat there and listened silently. Not that there was anything else he could do. he was trapped in a cell. Harry couldn't help but laugh at the irony of the situation though. That the person who attempted to make his school years a living hell. Besides Voldemort of course. Was the only one who believed him, not only that but knew that it was him. Then again, Malfoy was probably one of the few people who actually knew him.
"You must be proud though." He said looking at the parchment.
"But-" Harry persisted.
Harry felt as if he was bound to that wall again.
"Parkinson." They ordered.
But they never talked about it. Not once. It was a silent rule between the two. They both wanted, well needed to talk about it, but they also didn’t want to talk about it.
"Don't answer that Thatch. You learn quick here, that inmates are not worthy of answers." Rick the dick sneered. "Especially, this inmate. What do they teach you at M.A.C.U.S.A."
‘Where’d Weasley go?’ Draco questioned, a bottle of Ogden's and three glasses in his hands.
‘This was a strategic hit Ron. They knew where we were. They knew our whole platoon was here, unprepared. It was a saluter, we tried to fight back it was no use, we were outnumbered, outwitted
Dawlish eye twitched ‘I said! That is an order!’ He repeated. Harry continued to stare him down.
‘So, Ginny I’d like to hear from you what seems to be the problem at the moment, look at your partner and tell him what’s been on your mind.’ Dr dollie, said sweetly.
Some times Harry forgot that there was more then just him and Malfoy. Held up in the dank cold cells of Azkaban.
The gift had treated him well in his first war, so Harry had no reason to believe that it wouldn’t serve him well in his second.
But it did. And here he was wallowing in he back yard in the very tent he’d first cheated on his wife. The woman who was meant to be his other half, the second part of his soul.
From his point of view she seemed to be anxious and determined, looking behind her as if to see if she was being followed. Though she also looked like the war hadn’t touched her. Her robes pristine. She had been locked in the dungeons.
And I think he knows it to.’
The guard remained silent. simply moving deeper into the dark heart of Azkaban. Soon coming to a halt, in front of a peeling black door. It opened and he was forcefully pushed in. The door slamming behind him, Harry turning to face the door when he heard the distinct sound of a locking charm being placed.
“What are you doing!” He panicked. Then his world went black. A sensation not unlike a port key making him feel like he was hurdling through time.
Malfoy stood rooted to the spot. watching as Harry had a break down. He had never seen Him like this. he had, had a mental breakdown, yes. But this, this was different. He was crying. Potter didn't cry. Not in front of Draco. Not like this.
Harry looked down at his cell floor, as continues pops! Went down the cell block.  A plate full of slop stared back at him. Harry stomach rolled, at the sight of it.
‘We become what they think we are.’ Summoning a twig, with a flick of wand the twig transfigured into a carbon copy of himself. ‘We become dead.’
The pain becoming sort of numb as the bodies rocked back and forth in a repetitive motion. Grazing his cheek rapid pace as it was trapped between a the wall.
‘Go to sleep Draco. I’m here.’ Harry smiled kissing his forehead.
Draco, and Luna he assumed. She was the only one he could think of who saw things for what they really were. Not what they looked like. That's not what stumped him though.
Harry was more miffed, well he was more than miffed. With the fact that Pug face was there and he wasn't. like so many other moments he should have been apart of.
Harry didn’t know why he made them dinner, maybe for the illusion of normalcy but the two sat at the table staring at nothing as their food sat before them growing cold, Harry found himself rising from the table and heading the the lounge and setting it up for Draco to sleep on. Before making his way to his room and closing the divider.
So he waited. In his cell, trying to keep the nausea at bay, while the wizarding world tried to put it self to rights. Purging any trace of Voldemort and his followers. Unluckily for him. He was now in one of those bodies.
"No. not leverage, insurance she called it. She kept saying that word. I didn't know what she meant until I held that innocent little girl in my arms. She couldn't help the way she was made. I knew then she would come for her. I tried to stay awake. Fuck! I tried to stay awake. Spend as much time as I could with her."
"DON'T TOUCH ME!" Harry growled, flinching away from her touch. Fire in his eyes. The calming potion unfortunately dulled his senses, making him more compliant, and harder to throw her off a second time.
“I think you’ll find they won’t. You see I don’t leave any loose ends. While the battle raged I had the time to plan what I’d do once the heathens descended. And there was no way I was going to Azkaban or getting the kiss. So I made a fail safe while locked in the dungeons. Now I was going to pick a random student. But then who do I find but you.
Entering the Mess tent a sea of wizards and witch’s huddled around tables and lining up at the buffet tables for their food.
‘You don’t have to Harry.’ She whispered against his ear.
Harry finally turned to face him. Draco tried not to gasp at the way he looked. His face gaunt and pale .
No! No! No! Not her. Bile filled his throat, and he heaved all over the dusty floor. One hand on his stomach, the other on the peeling door, for support. The taste of apple and slop, making its way up and out. He couldn't breath. Chocking on vomit, as he hyperventilated.
Life as an A.K was not what either man expected. But It served the war efforts far more effectively than their two years in the platoon. That’s not to say it didn’t have a major influence on their psyche. After all killing has a way of chipping away ones soul.
Resuming his set of sit ups, letting out a puff of air, each time he reached his knees.
Ginny groaning next to him in annoyed understanding.
He was tall, very American and seemed to all the world a good guy.
"Oh darling. My life was always a lie." Grabbing his cheeks she forced his face to look at hers. Lent down, and kissed him.
But later that night, before the fair people pulled it down, Harry apperated the two of them to the highest seat. The both of them laughing as the wind blew them back and forth.
The sound of his voices moans. That he knew all to well from when he indulged in a good wank. That voice. His voice, made it all the worse.
"I need to push!!!"
The first one he would be celebrating with his family in way to long. So Harry had begun shopping in the muggle world. Where he would be free to take his time, without the added annoyance of every witch and wizard gawking and the man who lived.
Crack! Bang!
"Same as last year. New minister. That could mean changes, and... Your mothers in France." He paused to let Malfoy take that in, before continuing. " Has a fashion line, under the Black name. Her ban should be lifted in a month."
He wasn’t prepared for the onslaught of memories that assaulted him from the mere sight that greeted him.
"Ha, Ha. Potter. Very funny." He rolled his eyes sarcastically. Harry almost laughed. Almost. Draco's face fell. "What did she do?" He asked hesitantly.
‘Good.’
He began to scream for help as his underwear was ripped off. “NO! STOP! HELP! HELP HERMIONE! RON! SOMEONE! HELP ME! HELP ME!” Tears of frustration and fear trailed down his face, as his pleas went unanswered.
‘I suspect he has memories that fly in there.’ Luna’s voice piped up again.
Both looked up at each other in shock. Before morphing, Harry mortified that Malfoy had finally made him break his vow of silence. Malfoy looking like the kneazle who got the snidget.
“Looks like it’s time for another trip to medi. Aren’t you lucky.” He sneered. Taking Harry’s arm once they passed the entry gate of their wing of Azkaban. “Saved yourself, what happened last time.” Rick goaded.
With a wandless spell cast Harry’s way, he was stretched and ready for him. A well placed thrust and he was inside the brunet, Draco’s left hand wrapped around his neck as he panted beautifuly with each new thrust.
‘Hear me out. You had an advantage then, you knew your opponent. The Norwegians are different, they aren’t ruled by one, it’s political, not pure bloods against the rest of Wizarding Britain. We offended them and they retaliated.’
He has a purpose. He had a plan.
Malfoy looked at him pityingly, not having the heart to tell him what he knew to be growing under his skin. Not now at least. So he simply said.
Draco had gotten distracted during their mission, and the target had turned her wand on herself after hexing Draco. That happened if the enemy found themselves about to be tutored for questions. They ended it before the enemy could even try.
‘I don’t need reminding of there retaliation. I was there.’
"Harry!"
But this Time Harry wouldn’t let it consume him like before, He knew what Draco was doing, He knew what he had to do.
‘Are you okay?’ He questioned, rubbing at Harry’s back.
His hand slowly stroking her clit as he thrusted.
Harry knew where she was going with this. But he wasn’t ready to deal with it. Not now.
"A month!" Harry shouted incredulously. "Did you even get a trial?" Malfoy shook his head. "That cant be legal!" he exclaimed.
“Kindness! He is nothing more than a....” He never got to finish his sentence, as his face was smashed into the cold unyielding stone. He could feel his nose crack! Upon contact. Blood dripping from his mouth.
“WHAT THE FUCK!” He screamed, crawling backwards away from his double. “Who are you?” He splutterd till he hit the underside of a fallen table.
Ron was a vulture.
The early hours of the morning while the sun still slept, found Harry sitting in a steel tub that resided in his tent.
They ate their meals in silence. Though every now and then, Harry would open his mouth as if to say something, before closing it again. After the thirtieth time he had done this. Malfoy had, had enough.
"It was mine." Harry, whispered. as he twisted the steam of the green apple.
‘When did you become the one who gave speeches.’ He drawled.
"WHAT. THE. FUCK. PARKINSON." Harry snarled.
Harry eyed him angrily, before complying.
‘I was trying to end a war. It’s not like I just pissed off till the mood struck me to come back.’
Draco’s face fell. Harry’s chest constricted.
Harry simply rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Honestly Malfoy I don’t much care, this is a big prison you have no way of knowing he doesn’t have a favourite on every level.”
And without thinking he lunged, pining her/himself to the floor.
"Fuck!" He cried. Rubbing a bloody hand across his face.
"That cell your in wasn't always empty." was Malfoys short answer.
‘From what we have gathered so far, the hits Britain has taken have favours the gamot. We are wining the battles but losing the war. They first took Draco of the gamot and enlisted him, it was a clever move. And from my research he was the only one on the gamot that was forcibly enlisted. Ive also run the numbers, and surely you have seen as your work as a vulture that our platoon has had the highest losses of any squadron.’
After that. When the guards would come in the night. Not every night or even week. Harry would throw the apple. And Malfoy would catch it, And Harry would stay silent, until he was ready to talk.
‘Oh, um well. Ive been helping out at the joke shop while uncle Ron’s been gone. And well, I want to take it over for uncle George he’s ready to retire. Mind, that probably wont happen for years yet. But he knows that Fred II and Rox are more into flying then the shop, so that’s, well that’s my plan.’ He finished, shooting Harry an uncertain smile.
Harry’s throat tightened at the mention of that day. But he would be dame'd if he cried, in front of him. But his current state, meant that he didn’t have a very firm hand on his emotions. He could even feel the slightest twinge of his magic.
He’d just shagged his wife. Who he hasn’t shagged in three years. And the whole time all he could think of was Draco.
"I have a daughter Malfoy." He gasped, looking over to him, then to his right to thank the man who helped him birth her.
With a yawn and a quick once over his uniform, Harry let down his tent with a swish of his wand and placed the now shrunken piece of cloth into the pouch around his neck, the same one Hargrid gifted him those many years ago.
‘STOP AVOIDING THIS HARRY..’ Draco yelled.
A wave of magic washed over Harry as he saw a jug from his peripheral vision.
Harry took that time to cast a quick, wandless and wordless spell to clean his mouth out. Without the muggles catching on as they wondered around them.
The weight of it all, left him feeling weak and out of breath. Leaning heavily against the stone of an unknown corridor. He wanted to cry. But all he felt, was numb.
"You have an eidetic memory! Draco. You know the plan."
Harry smiled, as food flew around her cutting itself and pooping into the pot on the stove. Harry unclasped the wax seal. Reading over the missive with excitement and trepidation.
“Merlin, Evergrey! What have I told you about crowd control? Especially with muggles,” huffed Potter, slipping his wand back into his robes. He looked almost exactly the same as when Draco had last seen him as part of the Wizengamot ten years ago. Potter’s hair was thick and dark, disordered from the Apparition, his glasses were still the same. The only difference was that he was wearing the robes of Head Auror – Draco remembers hearing about it and not being surprised, unbearably lawful Potter, of course he was an Auror that absolute tosser – the robes were decorated discreetly with silver patterns running along the edges and gathering to surround the collar of the robe. His boots were polished. Potter looked very much like himself, just more put together, which really irritated Draco. Why does
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Wow, thanks so much Malfoy, I feel loads better now,” he said, annoyed, dropping his arms from his chest and reaching for the finished report. He shuffled the papers into a neat pile and placed them inside a cardboard folder, scribbling ‘St Mungo’s potions theft report’ onto its cover.
was with Harry right now.
“Malfoy–“ Harry started, his voice so quiet it was practically a whisper. The man looked completely different from what he had back in England, and still so stunning. He was wearing beige slacks and a loose white linen shirt, his skin was sun kissed, only a memory of his pale complexion, and his hair had turned completely golden. His hair was longer, too, ruffled by the salty wind, and he was modelling a short stubble.
Breakfast would have to wait, not that he would have had much of an appetite at the moment. Later he might be dead by Malfoy’s hand and then that problem would be solved too. Harry gave himself one last look in the mirror, made his way to the living room downstairs, and stepped into the fireplace.
After lunch that day, Harry headed for the Carkitt Market just off of Diagon Alley to get groceries, real ones for once, not instant magic meals. The weather was quite beautiful, though rather cold, and the market was full of wizarding folk going about their business. Harry felt refreshed being out and about among the regular people, and not either hunched up in his office or at his house.
“Oh,” Malfoy replied simply, and eyed Harry with an expression that was uncomfortably knowing. Thankfully, he didn’t ask more about it, Harry didn’t really want to get into it at the moment. “So, get into any more near-death accidents lately?” Malfoy crossed his long legs, another detail Harry had noticed, and gave a very Malfoy-ish smirk.
The moment was over too quickly. There was a burst of loud laugher somewhere near them, and Harry reflexively turned to look, which caused Malfoy to turn away his gaze. Harry was disappointed, but glad that they still had a whole night ahead of them, more drinks to have, more places to see, more time to spend with the man he was apparently falling in love with, who did not seem like he was going to throw Harry out of his house. “Right, should we eat something then?” Malfoy asked, and Harry agreed.
On Monday morning Harry arrived to work to find the permission slip on his desk denied. Honestly, he wasn’t sure what he was expecting, Veritaserum was illegal after all. Judging by the lack of other case-related memos on his desk he figured that there hadn’t been a sighting of Dargan yet, he sighed and put down the piece of parchment.
Harry’s limbs felt numb and aching. It felt as if he had slept for a week without changing position once. But if he had been sleeping, why did he feel so bloody exhausted? It was like the bed was trying to slowly but surely swallow him. The bed! He was lying on a bed. But it wasn’t his bed, was it? No, the pillow was too soft, and Harry was quite certain there were more than one. His bed only had one flat pillow, which made his neck and shoulders sore. Come to think of it, his shoulders felt quite relaxed now, and the usual headache that slowly crept up the back of his neck was gone.
“But you thought it,” Harry muttered, “look, I know you don’t like Ron, and frankly, he’s not exactly in love with you either, but the Weasleys are good people, no matter what your dad told you about them, they took me in when I didn’t have anyone.” Suddenly Harry felt that the conversation had become very personal, he would defend Molly and Arthur like they were his own parents. They had practically adopted him from the start with their Christmas gifts and family holidays, not to mention that Ron was his best friend.
After a few moments of silence, Harry had calmed down a bit and another thought dawned on him. “Did your mother say anything else?” he absolutely had to know if Malfoy knew he knew. He didn’t know why it felt so important to him right at that second, but Merlin himself couldn’t stop him from asking a question that would surely open a can of worms that couldn’t be put back.
“That’s it, I’m going in,” Ron huffed, set down his glass and strode over to wrap his arm around Hermione’s waist. Draco’s smile shifted from genuine to more on the polite side, but eyed the pair of them more solemnly than he probably ever had. But when Draco turned his gaze towards Harry, gentle and open, Harry’s heart skipped several beats. That could be them, in no time at all, living in a house together, domestic like Ron and Hermione were.
Seeing Malfoy out of his Healer robes was a somewhat bizarre experience. And he wasn’t dressed in his usual robes either to spare Harry’s peace of mind, no, he was wearing
Harry turned to the doorway where he saw Patrick leaning on the wall, his wand raised. Harry immediately jumped up from the rubble as fast as he could, trying to cast Incarcerous, but while he did, he saw a tiny vial falling from Dargan’s hand and onto the floor. It was empty. Dargan had a befuddled look on his face, while lying on the floor in chains. Harry quickly picked up the wand and pocketed it, before stumbling towards Patrick. The man looked quite terrible, exactly like someone blasted across the room. There was blood on his forehead and in his hair, dust everywhere on his face and his clothes, and his leg was probably broken, along with his arm.
“It would be my pleasure,” Evergrey replied, matching Harry’s tone, while the pair exited the interrogation room.
Patrick half snorted, half sighed. “Thanks mate, but I dunno… I like being in charge, but it was a hell of a battle getting everyone released from their current cases to do this arrest with me,” Patrick huffed. Harry could imagine the paperwork, the pleading, it’s not that the heads of other cases wouldn’t want to help, but sometimes they were just swamped, and there was nothing to be done about it. It was a feat in itself that Patrick had managed to get so many good Aurors together.
Harry let out a dry laugh and shook his head. “You’ve only heard two stories, and I lived with them until I was seventeen, believe me when I tell you that you haven’t heard anything yet,” he gave a Malfoy a bashful glance from the corner of his eye, and saw the man quickly look away from him, as in a reflex. He noticed that Harry had seen the rushed twist of his head, and turned to look at him again. His expression was vexed but curious, like he was fighting an inner battle of wanting to know more, but not wanting to make Harry relive memories that might be painful. Harry appreciated his silence, but was glad to be talking about the Dursley’s with someone, convince himself that he wasn’t crazy thinking that they were horrible.
The pub had a slate floor, and the wood used in the tables and the chairs was lightly coloured. The upholstery was jade green and in the tables there were singular flowers in tiny glass bottles. The place was semi crowded, but not loud, and a gentle chatter filled the space. Harry headed on to the bar and ordered a pint.
” Harry demanded, “What’s that supposed to mean?” The fucking audacity of Malfoy to once again show that he thought everything was about him. How was Harry toying with Malfoy? If anything, Malfoy was toying with Harry, making him doubt himself and his feelings, tripping over himself trying to make out what was happening to him.
Hermione snorted and took a small sip from her glass while rolling her eyes. “You and your family are welcome, but we were only doing what was right,” she said in one of her more righteous tones. Draco sneaked a meaningful glance in Harry’s direction, clearly thinking
Harry heard himself laugh so warmly that it was immediately followed by a sting of longing for something similar of his own: being able to teach his own kid to fly, having them be so excited by it they wouldn’t care to walk anywhere ever again, be a good parent and offer a loving home, something he never had. But right now, he just hugged Rosie again. “Can’t argue with that logic, pumpkin. Now, should we go downstairs to have dinner with mommy and daddy?”
Malfoy shook his head determinedly. “I don’t want to return to that foul place,” he scoffed. That was fair, there were an abundance of unpleasant memories having to do with Hogwarts in Harry’s mind too, but he always first and foremost associated the school with home. The same couldn’t be said for Malfoy.
Harry propped himself up on his left elbow and turned to Draco, “What you said before, I wasn’t going to stop you because…” he paused, in search for words, “because I wanted it too.” Harry was looking at Malfoy, and felt a nearly irresistible urge to caress his hair, he wondered if it was as soft as it looked like, he hadn't really noticed before.
, I feel… confused,” he shook his head and looked away, “I don’t know what I want. I guess I’m here to find out. I didn’t think you’d be stupid enough to actually agree.”
The next morning Harry found himself looking at Malfoy differently, a little less like a puzzle. The previous night he had learnt something about him, something personal, and Harry felt closer to him for it. He noticed he was giving the man soft looks, and a few extra kisses on his cheek. There was not a chance Malfoy didn't notice the change in his manner, but he didn’t voice a complaint. The morning was cloudy but warm, and they decided to go out to fly again. Harry had almost forgotten about his distress of leaving, but just when he had blissfully sat down to have breakfast with Draco, he looked at him, and realized that their days together were numbered. He wanted to forget about it again, and he hoped flying would do that.
though it was impossible to be sure.
A silence fell over them both, as they sipped their teas in thought. “I’m happy for you, I mean, that all sounds incredible,” Harry said suddenly, and his words made Malfoy stop halfway into spreading jam on his scone. He gave a puzzled look towards Harry, but nodded, mumbling something that could have been a
Harry snorted at the wobbly argument the man was offering. “You know what was even more forbidden? The Time-Turner we used to pull it off.” He was still quite impressed with him and Hermione for succeeding in the seemingly impossible task. Now he actually grinned at the stunned expression taking over Malfoy’s face.
a break. From the eventful twelve-hour shifts at the Auror office, with him either sitting in front of his desk writing up a report, shoulders sore, or chasing some criminal through the busy streets of London, a business that usually landed him in the matron’s office.
Before Harry could be sucked deeper into his personal pit of despair, Malfoy returned with a vial. Harry hated how fast his heart was suddenly racing, being startled from his thoughts. The liquid inside the small bottle was light blue and swirled around a little. Malfoy handed it to Harry, who uncorked it and, after a suspicious glance at Malfoy – who looked intrigued like he was observing an exotic zoo animal –, knocked it down in one go.
Despite them both having been extremely busy with work, even Ron and Hermione had noticed that something was wrong. They had only seen a handful of times lately, but some weeks ago, Hermione had appeared in Harry’s office, catching him once again drifting off, staring outside his enchanted window. She had asked what had happened between him and Malfoy, and why Harry was acting so strangely once again. He had reluctantly given a very vague description of the events preceding Malfoy leaving for Italy, and leaving Harry to sleep. Hermione had promptly diagnosed Harry with love sickness, and suggested he’d reach out to Malfoy.
“Oh, I’ll never use them,” Harry huffed and crossed his arms to show how much he resented love potions, though he had to straighten his arms back immediately when he realized that it was impossible to hold them on his stomach without exploding.
Finally, on Wednesday, Harry was lazily leafing through the Ministry’s weekly internal newsletter and saw something. Usually the newsletter was utterly dull, so Harry was almost shocked to actually find something that could be related to his case. There, in the
“What is it?” Harry asked. Suddenly, something in his stomach sank, and not like it had before, but in a much worse way. The way when you just know something bad has happened. Malfoy didn't say anything; his lips were white from how tightly they were pinched shut. The man drew his legs into his lap and wrapped his arms around them, lowering his jaw on his knees. Harry picked up the letter, it was short. It was Narcissa’s handwriting, no doubt about that, but it was faltering, and there were stains in the ink here and there, as though she had been crying. The letter said,
Taking the risk that he would learn a foul detail about a particular Slytherin, Harry couldn’t help his curiosity. “Such as…?”
Harry was silent for a very long time. Malfoy… liked him? That was undeniably the largest bombshell Harry had received in years. He wanted to deny that he might have felt similar feelings towards seeing the git around, and he did. Although, Malfoy had helped him that day to get to St Mungo’s. So, Malfoy
“Because they didn’t accept muggle-borns,” Malfoy said very plainly, “but mother wanted to keep me closer to home,” he added after a short pause. Naturally: Harry had experienced Narcissa’s fierce motherly love himself in the Forbidden Forest all those years ago. It had saved his life.
Harry scurried up the stairs as quickly as he could and raided his tiny wardrobe, only to realize he would have to get some new clothes. For now, he changed into a plain black t-shirt and some blue jeans he found. He quickly performed a tidying up spell in the room with his wand that he’d grabbed from the kitchen, and left before all of his clothes had folded themselves back into his closet.
He walked over to the bed, and sat on its side, gently shaking her shoulder to wake her. “Wakey, wakey, Rosie, sweetheart,” Harry mused quietly, “your mum says dinner’s ready.”
“Potter,” Malfoy replied, not coldly, just, out of habit, it sounded, “I… what are you doing here?” he asked, looking confused to say the least. Harry didn’t know what he had been expecting, but the way Malfoy inquired why he was there, it caught him off guard. He assumed that they would both know why he was there. Malfoy had written about it to his own mother in a letter for Merlin’s sakes. His eyes were now measuring Harry like he couldn’t believe they were standing in the same room together. Truth be told, Harry really couldn’t really believe it either. He wondered what Malfoy saw, was his hair a mess? Did he have something on his face? Were his glasses crooked on his nose? He suddenly felt very self-conscious, and had to suppress the urge to start smoothing out his hair.
Lucius went whiter than he already was, but kept a disdainful expression on his face as he spat out: “The Ministry!? Why on Merlin’s green earth would they send
Harry had chuckled into his delicious mouth and pulled away reluctantly. “I have to go, I’ll see you at the hearing.”
“No, we’ll go alone, it’ll raise less suspicion,” he walked towards Evergrey who looked mildly surprised, but not enough to comment, apparently. “You’ve been there before, right?” Harry asked while firmly grabbing the man’s arm through his robe, he nodded in reply, “Brilliant, take me there, then.” With a loud crack, they were off.
"Um, i-i'm a, a Phoenix"
"No need to be rude about it, mate. It was a simple question" Weasly said, obviously put off with Hayden's answer.
“Hayden Snape and Hermione Granger”
"I just can't bear the thought of you getting seriously injured and the fact that there might be something I could do to prevent that!" Draco tried.
"We all know the only reason that Snape kid is hanging around you so much is because you're constantly getting into his trousers" Weasley sneered at the blonde.
Hayden finished the letter, smiling at how sweet Draco is. He folded the letter back up and set it next to him on the bed before standing and heading over to the bathroom for a shower.
By the time Severus was done he had had a few tears welling in his eyes as well.
"Um, I-I should get re-ready for classes" Hayden stuttered as he rushed around the room to gather his clothes and went to change in the bathroom before continuing his rush out of the room and to the Great Hall.
Meanwhile Hayden had been sleeping in a room he happened across almost completely by accident, but he was never more thankful for it. He had been wandering around the Castle and had come across the room while on the seventh floor. He had no idea how he had got up there, but in the end it was a good chance encounter.
Once again, he did. He felt her hands gently move his shoulder length hair behind his ears and cold metal being slipped on around them.
Hayden smiled as he answered, "Amazing!" Finally, he opened his eyes only to find silver looking lovingly back at him.
"If you must" Hayden relented, not wanting to be rude and tell him sod off.
Hayden left the Slytherin common room excited to see what Draco had planned!
He turned to face the door when he heard a knock on the wood, calling for them to come in.
Hayden was so engrossed in his book that it took him a couple minutes to notice the blonde, but when he did, he just sighed in annoyance.
"The textbook for Care of Magical Creatures" Hayden answered shortly.
Another heartbreaking sob left the ravenette caused Draco to feel an immense amount of grief at making the other cry like this.
He still had his more feminine features, but now he looked a bit more defined than before, high cheekbones and the like. He had to admit, he really liked how he looked now more than ever!
At first he wanted to ignore the call, but the black haired man felt a sudden need to go and see what was wrong with the boy calling out to him.
"Hayden Snape" He said before leaning back against the wall and closing his eyes. Unfortunately the two did not get the hint.
Draco’s face had hardened into a scowl by the time Hayden was done telling him the story.
"You have gone through an early inheritance and because of the creature you are, you have wings" Severus responded.
"Really? All you have to do is stroke the spine of the book. It's not that hard" Hayden answered, full of sarcasm.
"Is there something wrong?" Hayden asked, not expecting to see his mother waiting for him.
"Also I was apparently tricked into being friends with them in the first place" Hayden added, venom creeping into his voice. Tom was angered by this statement and wanted to interject, but waited for his son to finish speaking.
He heard some rustling around before feeling a cold weight being set on his head.
He was starting to get an unfamiliar feeling of anxiousness. He didn't know why or what might've been causing it, it was completely new, but for some reason, he felt the need to go and check on Hayden, but he was in an interview, what could possibly be harming him there?
Hayden nodded at the information. He figured it made sense though, he was also pretty sure that some of this was already happening with how Draco reacted to him being in the Tournament. He stayed silent as he listened to Sev continue.
"No, Draco is not here," Sev reassured.
Harry woke up to a quiet knocking sound at his window. He jolted a little at the noise, not realizing at first what it was, but after facing the window, he saw his snowy white owl patiently waiting to be let into the room.
"So what school are you transferring from?" Granger asked, curious wonder filling her tone.
"Yes" he answered without hesitation, causing Draco to smile softly.
After showing the Goblet of Fire and telling the students that the Tournament had begun, we had all been excused. Some stayed to finish their food, but most left to go back to their dorms, including Hayden and Draco.
A noise from the other side of the room shook him from his musings. Looking over he saw Draco sitting up on his bed.
Carefully he maneuvered himself off the bed, watchful of his sore and still slightly stinging back.
Hayden desperately needed time for just himself, but he just couldn't seem to get that. Hayden made his way back into the common room from the library and immediately started to climb the stairs to the second floor.
Needless to say, he did not go to classes the next, spending it curled up and cozy in his nest in front of the fire.
"No, now it's almost time for dinner. Head on over to the Great Hall before it becomes too crowded" Sev said, standing up from where he sat.
Tom was upset, of course this wasn't directed to Hayden, but to the school. What was going on that they would neglect one of their precious students, even if he was a Slytherin.
"So, who's feeling up to sharing?"
After a minute, Hayden was finally able to calm down, then something caught his attention. The cup in the center of the room had turned red, It must be time. He paid a little more attention to what was going on, wanting to hear the names of the lucky three.
Sorry for the long wait guys! I had to actually look references for this chapter because it wasn't just purely me, so thank you for your patience on this long over due chapter! Thank you!
“Um, Draco?” Hayden hesitantly spoke up, cutting off the blondes excited chatter.
He asked himself. Soon he was crying again, but this time it was from sadness and guilt, not happiness.
“Fine” the boy muttered, not wanting another argument and continuing on his way to the stairs.
But why didn't he mind it? It wasn't like he liked being around Malfoy or anything. He guessed that it wasn't all bad compared to when he was just Harry.
"Now then, there are some things we need to discuss about your new situation"
Hayden stared up at Draco from his bundle of blankets.
"We wait, we can't do anything until the others have done their part. Now come on, someones bound to notice here, we need to leave." the leader responded.
Hayden reluctantly scooted himself to the edge of the nest/bed, one of the blankets wrapped snugly around him. He went to stand on his legs, but as soon as he shifted his weight forward, his legs buckled and collapsed underneath him sending him toppling down to the cold floor.
"The Swedish Short-Snout"
"Are you sure that you want to join my ranks? Are you truly sure this is the direction you want to go?"
Hayden looked at Narcissa, she seemed nice enough. This is really the first time he was meeting her. She definitely looked like she belonged to the Malfoy name.
“Wh-When Draco pulled you out of the water d-during the last task. You had wings, and p-people usually don't have wings un-unless t-they have some sort of cre-creature blood in them. You d-don't h-have to answer if you aren't comfortable with t-telling me, I understand. I'm just curious. Your w-wings were as black as coal when you were dragged onto the platform” the girl uncharacteristically stuttered as she mumbled quickly.
"14" Hayden interrupted again, more sternly this time.
“I’m not entirely sure as it has been a while. I think it might be Devin, possibly Gavin. Nikoli died a couple months ago, but I could very possibly be getting them mixed up…” Voldemort said thoughtfully.
Harry looked at him, confused. The older man went ahead and led him into the bathroom so Harry could see himself in the mirror.
"Thank you, Hayden. You did a good job tonight and have proved to me that you are more than capable of the tasks I give you" Hayden beamed under his father's praise.
Hayden started to do more things for his father and the cause they served. It wasn't long before Hayden was as feared by the followers as the Dark Lord himself.
His wandering thoughts though were answered as he opened the door to the sight of his son looking absolutely wrecked. Tears streamed down from his red puffy eyes in wet trails. His hair was all out of place and he looked like he had just sprinted the length of the castle to get there.
"What do you want?" He said, looking back down at his book.
"As much as I would like to continue, it's late and we need to get back to bed. Especially if you want to be ready and well rested for tomorrow," Draco said, returning to a kneeled spot by the tub.
Hayden arrived at Hogwarts on Friday night. Now he had to figure out how he was going to keep his distance from Draco for the next two days until school officially starts.
"Well, I'm not getting up for you," Severus told him.
At first Harry didn't respond. He wasn't used to that name so he had forgotten that that was him. "Harry", this time he looked up.
He got out of bed and set the egg on the bedside table before making his way to the bathroom.
"Lets wake him up," Hayden said, a dangerous glint shining in his eyes as his plan was finally coming together.
"Should we start with the youngest?" She says as she grabs Hayden. "Lovely"
Hayden spent most of the morning in the library. He had found a secluded little spot that looked comfortable enough, so he took one of his course books and started to read through the material. Better get a head start on his classes.
Draco turned back around to see the most adorable sight. His little mate, wrapped in an over sized fluffy white towel, a slight blush still covering his cheeks.
Draco could tell that Hayden was nervous and he wanted to do something to help ease it. But before he could do anything, Dumbledore started to speak, the hall quieting as he did so.
"SLYTHERIN" The hat called out.
"Hayden" Draco tried again, a little louder this time, while shaking his gently but again, nothing.
Once everyone had arrived and it was time for the lesson to start, she announced that the class was going to be doing partner work and that she was going to pick who worked with who.
Severus quickly jumped awake at the noise, thinking someone else was in the house besides himself and Harry, but calmed down when he saw that Harry had just fallen when trying to stand. He went over to the boy and helped up while asking what he was doing up at this hour.
Hayden giggled into the blondes mouth as he leaned back against the wall of the tub, bringing Draco with him who had to brace himself to keep from falling onto Hayden's still bare body.
He looked around, trying to figure out where to go next.
The next morning, a knock startled Severus out of his musings while nursing a cup of coffee. Out of all the things Muggles had created, both he and Tom had agreed that coffee was something to value.
After what felt like forever, he finally made it to the window to let the poor little brown owl in. He untied the letter around its leg and went to pet the bird on its head gently. A small smile graced his face as the owl nuzzled back into his hand, cooing gently in appreciation.
"Oh, stop pretending that you care. Stop trying to tell me what to do! Stop trying to protect me!" Hayden shot back, tears starting to fall from his eyes.
"Would you be here too, Mother?" Harry asked with a hopeful look in his eyes.
"Mhmhm" Hayden mumbled, not wanting to say it out loud.
"Would it be okay if I tried something?" Draco whispered slowly, almost like he was hesitant to ask. He leaned forward ever so slightly.
He couldn't believe what he was seeing, he didn't want to see it.  He never would have guessed that this was the wizarding world's "Golden Boy" as he looked at the broken boy in front of him.
"Well, Dumbledore had tried to pick you up so he could take you to the infirmary, but when he went to touch you you almost burned his hand off. The only person who you would allow to touch you was Draco, so he carried you back here and I tended to you instead of Madame Pomfrey" Severus explained.
Tom had never been so anxious.
Once they had apperated back they both had made sure that all of Hayden's new things were put away in their right places.
"I'm sure you know how children come about?" Hayden nodded, "well it is much the same for us. Now, both you and I are submissive's, that's how I gave birth to you and someday, you will too. After the mating process, some creatures will go into a rut ot in our case, a heat. As i'm sure you have gathered, Phoenix's are one of the creatures. This time period usually happens once a year and lasts around a week or two and is the time when conception is most likely to happen. Of course there have been reports of conception happening outside of a heat, but it is rare" Severus explained.
Harry was a Phoenix
"Draco, do you know what it means to be rejected by your mate? I don't suppose you do, do you?" Severus thought out loud.
“I bet that Granger was trying to get into your good graces. By bringing up something personal like that. I bet she thought you would confide in her then she would promise to keep your secret” Draco speculated.
Reaching out, he put his hands on Hayden's arms, rubbing them up and down, as you would a child. Hayden laughed as he did so causing Draco to laugh as well.
Once Dumbledore was done, the feast began. Throughout the meal, Malfoy cast glances over at Hayden whenever he thought the other wasn't looking. But of course, Hayden always noticed.
With that she drags Hayden into a side room to start the interview.
Not a moment later and he was being greeted by Lucius Malfoy and guided into the study where the meeting was to take place.
Looking around, he wasn't impressed. It was cramped and everything looked rundown and old and rather messy.
"I'm sorry, did I give you permission to speak?" Hayden said, a hard glare freezing his three classmates in their spots.
He opened his eyes, the bi-colored orbs glaring at the red head.
"Fine" the raven signed, hauling himself off of the couch and to a desk in the Severus' room.
When Harry looked in the mirror he was surprised to see that the wings were not the only things that changed about him!
"Oh" was Hayden's reply. "Wait, did I finish the task?"
"I'm 14" Hayden interrupts.
In the meantime, Hayden had helped out with making the main hall look nice and less intimidating.
When he saw the other bed was empty, he was wide awake, panic starting to take hold of him.
Draco sat down in front of Hayden, admiring the other boy as he read.
"Actually, I am on my way to meet someone in Hogsmead" Hayden said.
"Are you alright? You seemed really upset at dinner." Hayden pointed out, going to sit on his own bed.
"Let me explain. Sometimes when a person, mainly only wizards, is in a life or death situation they can communicate with others. It's a study that has yet to be explained, but I had heard you calling out for help. I only regret it took me so long. I came to see what was wrong and saw you had been beaten, almost to death, so I took you here so you can heal" Snape explained.
Then he remembered the last three years. He had been all but kind to the child who was faced with more danger than a child should ever have to deal with.
"Can I see your wings?"
“It was my pleasure” Victor said before reaching out to gently take one of Hayden’s hands in his own.
"Hey there," Draco said quietly as he knelt down at the edge of the tub, looking into Hayden's tired eyes with poorly disguised concern.
"That Hufflepuff!?" Hayden said in surprise.
They walked into the grand building and up to the front of the bank where Griphook sat and asked to do a test on Harry's inheritances.
He put the potion he was working with down and quickly apperated to Harry's room at #4 Privet Dr.
"Of course I forgive, father! I love you!" Hayden cried as Tom hugged him tighter.
"Other than my arm, I'm just fine," Hayden answered.
"I bet you he doesn't last the first round" Draco laughed, making Hayden laugh as well.
Without noticing the raven, Draco walked over to the wardrobe and started to put his clothes away in a very organized fashion.
Thing that concerned him the most though was the conditional Hayden came home in.
Hayden didn't really pay attention. He looked around the hall, seeing all three schools there and the headmasters for each. There weren't many teachers from Hogwarts there, if any at all. After looking around for a minute more though, he could spot his mother standing in a darkened corner.
"Me, myself, and I want to know! Not to mention my rabid readers!" She chuckles.
As soon as Tom left his son's mind, he was displeased. He knew the three that were apparently conspiring against him.
Harry was a little less confused with the explanation, but he still had questions.
Something just kinda clicked, he guessed, like a warm fuzz covered his heart.
"It's about time! I've been looking for you everywhere!" Pansy said as she turned to face Hayden. "Here, come with me" she grabbed his arm and led him to a private back room.
Severus thought. '
Hayden slumped down the wall as he gasped for breath, but was interrupted with a sneeze.
"No, of course you didn't, huh. Why would you? I bet you've been slipping me Amortentia haven't you? How did you do it, huh? How were you able to mask it so well that I couldn't even detect it?" Draco finally yelled.
"Of course. What do you need?" Sev responded, putting his papers away so he could focus on his son.
"Well, this should make you even happier. Your last letter" Theo said, breaking the hug to give Hayden his letter.
"I can ask if he wants to meet you tomorrow." the black haired man said. Tom looked back up at him and smiled.
"Well, we tend to be very powerful magic users and we are able to manipulate fire and as I am sure you will soon see, we are powerful flyers" Harry's eyes widened at that. "We can do practically anything a Phoenix can do, with only a couple exceptions" Severus explained.
"GET DOWN HERE, FREAK!" his aunt Petunia yelled from the bottom of the stairs.
A knock sounded from the door before Severus popped his head in.
Hayden continued to stare her down for a minute longer before slowly opening his mouth to reply.
Harry braced himself as he felt the belt buckle make sharp contact with the skin on his back.
"Um, one sec" Hayden responded as he slipped his night shirt over his head. "Okay, come in"
Hayden's favorite part of the outfit was the sleeves, he thought it looked regal. He was also really happy that the dress had a back to it. He didn't feel quite comfortable in an outfit that was backless.
He contemplated just taking a seat on the other bench, but decided against. His friends were bound to try and come find if he didn't return soon. After a minute, he managed to pry himself away from the raven, quietly shutting the sliding door so as not to wake Hayden.
"Yes, but I want to be sure"
"I think we are done," He said, getting up and walking to the door. "Good day"
Hayden had a couple tears streaming down his cheeks. He smiled up at his father. He had never heard anything so heartfelt before, and it was for him. He hugged his father one more time before letting go. "I love you dad!"
Draco looked at the raven with wide eyes, finally noticing what he was doing.
"Oh I'm so scared" the boy sassed as he just continued walking.
Why was he lied to about his heritage, why try to force Harry to be friends with people who obviously seemed to not like him?
"Um... Draco, have you noticed that Harry Potter hasn't been here at all this year? He hasn't been in classes and he doesn't come down for meals? He wasn't on the train and all the Gryffindors have been rather down, more than usual anyway?"
Anyway, Happy Belated New Years!
"Draco, wake up" he whispered again a couple minutes later.
Once they were finally in the privacy of their own dorm, Hayden pushed Draco down onto the bed just so he cuddled up close next to the blond.
"Wow, that's amazing! Can I ask, what type are you?" Draco asked boldly. Hayden blushed before answering.
"Hayden tell me truthfully, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?" Severus asked calmly.
Hayden opened his eyes again to see that the other Champions had left and only a select few teachers had barged in to disturb the peace: Mr. Crouch, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and of course Severus (albeit much quieter than the other three).
As it neared the end of the day, Harry was done with all but a few things on the list, but first he needed to make dinner.
Severus led Hayden over to his bedroom so that they could have a more private setting to talk in, just in case someone were to walk through the portrait.
Hayden blushed reading the letter. He folded it and put it with the other letter, shrinking the bad of candy and putting it in his satchel he brought with him.
"You don't have to if-"
“I don’t mean to be rude or anything, but I am really curious, what type of creature are you?” Hermione questioned as they got started on their assignment.
Suddenly, the goblet started to act up, shooting flames everywhere. It glowed red again! Weren't there only supposed to be three Champions?
"Oh, um, no" he said, trying to be polite.
The raven thought frantically.
"What do you mean 'finally'?" Hayden asked while hugging his mother back.
His mate leaned in close to Hayden, smirking, as he brought his lips to Hayden's ear. Hayden felt his heart shatter.
"Why do I have wings?" he asked.
"Well yeah, but I don't see why that has anything to do with you. You're not him so why should I care?" Draco said, his tone becoming irritated. Why wasn't Hayden answering his questions? What was so important about that Potter bastard?
Suspecting it to be just a random person deciding to jog the rest of the way, so he didn't bother looking back behind him. Much to his disappointment, he really should have looked behind him.
"May I ask who it is?"
The two ran off almost immediately, most likely making their way to the Hospital Wing.
Hayden turned to see Viktor Krum looking at him with a compassionate look in his eyes.
"Now that you're here, I have one more question for you"
"So, are you excited for the reception?" Tom asked Hayden, who nodded quickly.
After a minute of them doing stunts and tricks in the aisle, their High Master came in, following the other students, with another walking beside him. When he two walked in, you could hear the Gryffindors freaking out.
Wait! Did he just describe having a crush? ON DRACO!
About a half an hour later, Tom heard a knocking on one of the windows of the study they were in. Looking over he saw an owl sitting on the ledge with an expectant look in its eye and a waiting letter in its beak.
Harry thought – Evergrey was too good of a person to ever let something like this fly. Unfortunately, the decision had been made with the majority siding with the proposition. Still, it was too serious of a decision to be made in such a short time, without a judge present, without a jury. You simply shouldn't be able to decide something like that in one board meeting.
Ron had grown a subtle beard and his hair wasn’t as wild as it once had been. He was wearing black jeans and an unbuttoned blue dress shirt over a white tee, how muggle, Harry thought with a smile. Hermione was still looking exactly the same, except that she had gained control over her frizzy hair and it was now more of a restrained curl. She too was wearing jeans and a light sweater. In the kitchen sink the pots and pans were cleaning themselves, and it reminded Harry of the Burrow the first time he had been there. There was a delicious smell wafting around the house.
Harry just nodded and was simultaneously frustrated and relieved that he couldn’t go along with them. He really wanted to be the person to catch Ridgenorth after he threw Harry out of the window, but at the same time he really didn’t want to be thrown out of a window again. Evergrey left his office and Harry thought of the case for a while, before forcing himself to return back to work. Theseus was giving him icy looks from his portrait, but didn’t say anything.
He felt a surge of happiness flow through him at the thought of finding his mate and at the fact it was Hayden.
After a little while, his father came to get him.
"And what part do you have in all this?" Hayden asked suspiciously.
Later that night while Hayden was preparing for bed, he heard a knock on his door.
"Hayd-?... I'm so-" Draco began but was cut off almost immediately.
I don't even know if there is a plot anymore, I'm just writing whatever fits next it the story! I sincerely hope this story makes sense!
There was a nursery for flowers near the edge of Hogsmeade that he began to make his way toward.
Once there, Severus hurried through the house with Harry in his arms, bringing him to the guest room. Severus laid Harry down and began the long process of healing Harry's wounds and giving him replenishing potions.
Thankfully classes that day were relatively easy, he didn't really think he was up for any complicated thinking. He already had enough of that when it came to what happened last night (this morning?) with Draco and of course he still had yet to figure out the next task.
"Really? What are we doing?" Harry wondered.
Hayden couldn't believe what he was hearing. The fact that Draco loved him, so much so that he wanted to be with him forever. The thought melted his heart into a big happy fluttery mess.
"Do you want to walk down to lunch with me?" Draco inquired.
the boy reasoned.
"Good morning" Hayden murmured sleepily.
Anyway, enjoy the new chapter!
"Now, lets see what we can do about your arm, hmm!" Severus said, standing up.
"Alright, thank you! I really appreciate you taking the time to explain this all to me. I'd be completely lost without it!" the younger said with a small smile, reaching forwards to hug his mother.
"Now," Pansy started again after a minute or two. "We obviously can't have you walking around Hogsmeade with a crown. We don't want you to get mugged or anything do we! So instead, we have a compromise" She said as she took off the crown and placed it in a black velvet box before shrinking it and handing it to Hayden.
"Only if I can see yours"
Hayden looked at him not knowing what to expect. His father reached a hand toward him, ignoring the boys flinch and roughly grabbing him by the neck.
Hayden turned to his left to see Nott talking to him.
"It's perfect, mother thank you!" Hayden excitedly grabbed the dress and went to put it on as after his mother left the room
“I’m tired,” Hayden whined. Draco laughed as he finally got off of Hayden.
When he had finished with the table and the dishes, he looked at the list. He sighed and looked at all the things he was tasked to do that day.
Hayden didn't quite realize just how much he had to do until it hit him all at once. He had to prepare for the next task (in which he was in no way ready), he had to make a plan on what to do with Dumbledore and Harry Potter (although he had a good idea already), and now he was dealing with Draco's rejection. It was all just so emotionally draining, maybe that's why he had such a hard time getting out of bed.
"I thought you already knew," Hayden said as he finally looked at his mother.
He guessed that some of them were okay, like the twins, Luna and Neville. They're cool, but everyone else can just mind their own business.
Draco had the decency to look ashamed before his eyes widened in shock.
"Love ya" Hayden said quickly as he hugged Sev before heading quickly to dinner.
Hayden set the box down carefully and opened his last letter.
"Phoenixes are very protective of their wings and will only show if they are with family or if they feel extremely safe. The only other times they are shown are if they are grave danger. I'm sure that you noticed just how bright his wings were?" Again, Draco nodded.
Hayden sat there frozen in shock. How did his name get in the cup? Who put it there?
He hurried up the stairs to the fourth year's level and gently knocked on their dorm room door.
"Wh-What? W-Why?" Hayden said, his voice hoarse from crying. His mate just looked back down him with a frightening scowl, causing Hayden to whimper in fear. His father walked up to him and knelt down next to him.
"Now", his mother said, standing up, "How about you wear...this" Severus handed a dress to Hayden.
"Calm down, I'll send him in" Severus gave Tom a quick peck on the cheek before turning to the door. He opened it, revealing Hayden.
Once the girls had walked about a fourth of the way down the walkway they started to prance the rest of the way, greeting each side of the room in a sweeping motion.
Apparently he was a big name, but Hayden had no idea who he was, and honestly, he didn't care all that much.
Draco was left outside of the portrait, drowning in his confusion and guilt.
He turned to ask Blaise for help, but when he did, he found that Blaise wasn't behind him.
"Now, how about we deal with this little problem that plagues my ranks?" Tom said, a murderous glint in his eyes.
It was Monday, so most of the other Slytherins, including Draco were in class. Hayden, though, was excused because of the interview with the Daily Prophet, which was where he just came from.
He smirked to himself as he thought of the upcoming year at Hogwarts, hoping he wouldn't have another life threatening situation and that he could finally have a somewhat normal year!
From across the table and a couple seats down, silver eyes glared at the action.
"You might not realize this, but you've managed to sway the hearts of pretty much everyone in our House. Now of course I know that you have something going on with Draco that you're probably wanting to keep secret. Don't worry, I won't tell"
In the room stood Draco Malfoy.
"I would like that" Hayden responded as Draco brought their faces closer to each other.
He put it on, noticing how well it was put together.
"Are you okay, you look worried?" Severus said while giving him a hug.
“Of course” Draco finally responded with, gaining a small smile from Hayden.
"Wait" the blonde called once again. Hayden didn't slow at all, in fact he sped up. He couldn't let Draco catch him, he just couldn't. Hopefully the castle would let him into his room without having to pace around three times for the door.
As he straightened back up, he could tell that most everyone in the room felt at least a bit intimidated by his seemingly silent demeanor.
Severus had helped him pick out the dress he would wear the other day, and he was glad he had his help. He felt overall really comfortable in it, and the back wasn't so revealing either because of the ribbons hanging down. He was smoothing out his dress when he heard a knock on the door.
"Nobody you should concern yourself with" Draco muttered.
"I'm not sure, Sir. I just woke up and decided that I should stand up for a minute or two. I'm not sure why" Harry said quietly.
He shifted uncomfortably in the bed before noticing his wings were out. That must have been what was weighing him down. He relaxed as he calmed down.
"No, I'm not ready, I really want to make a good impression, but I have no idea what to wear!" Hayden cried as rummaged through his wardrobe.
Almost as an afterthought, Draco remembered who the person was, kneeling down quickly.
"If you would like you can go wake him and see just how angry he can get" Draco said in a monotone voice.
Victor Krum had jogged up to him and was now walking beside him.
His uncle hit him again, this time Harry fell to the floor. Vernon kicked him hard in the side over and over again until Harry was sure that he could feel a crack forming in one of his ribs.
Draco turned around to look into the red and gold eyes he had missed so much, but when he looked closely, they looked different. Actually, all of Hayden looked different.
Severus smiled back at him. "You figured it out, now let's get you back to bed. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow"
Draco smiled, happy that Hayden had seemed to have forgiven him. He's going to have to work hard though to make sure he doesn't say the wrong thing in the future and this doesn't happen again.
Once he was done fixing his hair into a short french braid, he waited for his father to bring him down to the meeting.
Draco gave her a strange look before turning around and continuing to leave to go get Hayden.
Harry thought sarcastically to himself.
Hayden quietly walked in, trying not to make a sound as he watched Draco rummage around his truck. Soon he stood his arms filled with clothes.
"So, your Harry Potter?" Hayden just nodded, willing the tears back so he wouldn't cry.
He ran to Harry to try and help in any way he could, then he noticed a subtle change in Harry's smell. Harry was coming into his inheritance. Severus quickly got Harry onto his stomach just in time as a pair of big, beautiful, reddish gold wings that seemed as though they were on fire erupted from Harry's back.
"And now our friends from the north. Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and their high master, Igor Karkarov!"
"Come with me" She led him to where all the other first years were waiting patiently to be sorted. Not many paid too much attention to him when he joined them, other the occasional stare from those he knew would most likely be sorted into Slytherin.
He walked in, searching the small store to see if anyone was here waiting for him and there was.
With that Draco set about breaking the locks Hayden had set on the door.
He can't get his hopes up again, just to be crushed in the end
He looked around, not seeing the dragon he was supposed to go up against.
The ravenette bristled at the Weasley calling him mate, it made him extremely uncomfortable.
Once Vernon was done, he left, slamming the door behind him. Harry was left bleeding and broken, on the verge of slipping unconscious. The last thing he thought to himself was
Lazily looking at the room he wasn't in, he realized that he was in his bedroom in Riddle Manor. Thankfully, whoever put him there (most likely his father) had the good sense to light a fire in the fireplace by his work desk.
"Oh, of course you didn't!" She smirked, winking at the boy like she knows something. "Everyone loves a rebel Hay!" She laughed while Hayden scowled.
He could get the image of Hayden out of his mind, face covered in tears, eyes red and broken. Soon enough the heart broken image turned into one where Hayden almost seemed to be a lifeless cold-hearted ghost.
"He is a very persuasive person, and I doubt that there isn't a person in Slytherin who wouldn't do literally anything for you" Blaise said rather bluntly. Hayden almost choked on his food at the admission.
"Hey," Hayden grabbed Draco's wrist as he turned away, making Draco face him again. "I'll be fine, I promise!" Hayden reassured, giving Draco a comforting smile. Or at least he hoped it was comforting.
“Oh shush!” Tom said as playfully swatted at his son who just laughed at him in return who fell down to the floor in a show of dramatics.
"Thank you" he said and reached up to give Severus a gentle kiss.
Draco looked a bit embarrassed at the answer. Now that he thought about, that did make a bunch of sense.
Hayden watched him go, muttering a quiet good night that he wasn’t sure was heard or not. The only thing he could seem to do was stand there in shock.
"Well, it sounds like you have everything planned out. Do you want to tell me why?" Tom asked, knowing that something was up.
They left the store with a whole new wardrobe for Hayden. Once they had gotten all of Hayden school books and supplies for school, they were on their way to return back home.
"This castle would not only be your home this year, but home to some very special guests as well, you see, Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event" He paused, for dramatic effect, of course.
"Hey girl," Harry greeted as he opened the window and started petting her feathers. "What's that you got in your mouth?"
Hayden then realized a quiet growl could be heard coming from Draco, a harsh glare on his face trained on the Bulgarian.
"T-thanks" Hayden muttered as he blushed slightly from embarrassment. "I guess I was a more tired than I thought"
Draco had really messed up, hadn't he? The thing was, he had no idea what he was supposed to do to fix it.
“Thank you for your concern professor McGonagall, but everything is just fine,” The Phoenix beamed, easing some of the worry that had taken over the older woman’s features.
"Oh, so what, now you're too good for me? Now that you've made sure I've completely fallen for you you're suddenly superior? Well guess what, you're even worse than me. No wonder you got into Slytherin you son of a-" Draco seethed, shutting himself off so he could take a moment to breathe. That moment didn't last very long.
Hayden shot up from his spot laying on the coach, wide eyes staring at his mother. He was not going to look forward to this.
He had accidentally burned the vegetables and didn't have time to try and remake them. At that moment, he swore life was out to get him!
Harry almost flinched away from how loud she was being. He scurried away to the kitchen and got out three glasses. He filled each of them with orange juice and carefully picked all three of them up, walking slowly so as to not spill them.
After a moment, Tom spoke up again. "I would like to introduce you to some of my most trusted Death Eaters"
"Actually, it hasn't been all that hard. There are some difficult moments, like when I am meeting someone who used to hate me as Harry Potter" Hayden looked down. "I get nervous sometimes around those people," he said quietly.
The ravenette walked to the table and took a seat next to the other fourth years. Most of the other Slytherins started at Hayden, they all looked at him with curious gazes, as if trying to figure him out. Others looked at him with skepticism, even jealousy, Hayden had no idea why though.
Hayden missed getting letters, he can't remember the last time he got one that was actually pleasant. That reminds him, he can't forget about the meeting he set up with Dumbledore in about a week.
Finally, Draco seemed to break out of his anger induced haze and looked at Hayden. The shy and sobbing boy in front of him was a sad sight indeed. He almost confesses his love to this boy too.
"Hayden, I think it's time you and I had a talk" Severus finally said.
All three stood up and made their way to another room, deeper into Gringotts.
Usually he gets at least one letter from his friends during the summer, but he guesses they were just too busy for him this summer.
It was nearing the end of July so that left Hayden with plenty of time to come up with a plan on how to proceed. Hayden wasn't too worried though, he suspected the whole thing to be rather easy.
The store was dim, and for a moment, Harry couldn’t see anything, coming from the bright light of day. There were many smallish windows letting in daylight, illuminating the room. The store was modest in size, and it smelled like sage and something else Harry didn't necessarily care to place. The room was cool, apparently the thick stone walls kept the heat at bay, Harry was glad to get away from the heat. When his eyes got used to the dark, Harry could make out the shelves upon shelves of boxes and jars, all neatly arranged on the walls, with names and prices marked clearly. Facing the door, there was a small counter, and two doors, one of which was open.
“I don’t think either of us chose to be in this situation,” Harry pointed out. He hadn’t
“So you’re happy to leave then?” Harry inquired. He hadn't meant to sound like he was interrogating the man, he was just presenting an honest question, to which he wished to receive an honest answer. He started to feel calmer noticing that Malfoy was engaging in conversation, and didn’t have one foot out the door anymore.
“You’re so insufferable, you know that?” Malfoy spat out, still facing away from Harry, “You’re not just pretending to be
With the same throaty voice, under his breath, Lucius spoke: “Bloody Gryffindor scum,” he muttered after Harry.
Fucking, fucking hell. “Right,” was the only thing he could muster. He wanted to say that it had been mutual but… it really, really hadn’t been.
Now the door opened carefully, and Narcissa’s figure appeared in the entryway. Her hair was in a bun, and her face was tight with nervousness, although it seemed to ease a bit upon her seeing that it was Harry who was standing on her yard. “Potter, how unexpected to see you here,” she said politely, but struggled to produce a smile, “are you on official business?” Again, she thought that Harry was there to arrest her, or interrogate her, or some other thing related to police showing up at one’s door.
When he reached the first floor, he turned to scout the apartment where Ridgenorth was allegedly staying at. There were two doors on the other end of the corridor, the right hand one ominously ajar. A streak of light flooding into the dim corridor from the room showed the infinite number of dust particles floating in the air. To Harry’s headache, he realized that that was the apartment with the window where Dargan had been seen. The man could be lurking anywhere, waiting to jump Harry, and he raised his wand once again, starting to make his way towards the door as carefully as he could. The streak of light partially illuminating the corridor was so bright, that it made everything else in Harry’s line of vision exceptionally dark.
The neighbourhood was quiet after the last rays of evening sun had set behind the faraway forest. The semidetached houses along the street were white against the black backdrop of their now dark gardens, though the streetlights were illuminating the leafless bushes surrounding the buildings. The persistent drizzle of the day had finally stopped, but the street was still wet, and water droplets were lazily hanging on every tree branch and decorative fence. There were no signs of spring anywhere, despite the fact that the year was sliding into March.
Harry felt himself redden on the face. “Er… well… he didn't jump up and down from glee, to be honest.” He didn’t know how else to put it, quoting Lucius verbatim about what he’d said about Harry’s ‘freakish ways’ didn’t seem like a good idea at the moment.
“I assume this concludes our business,” Draco asserted and looked the man in the eye. He wanted to get this business over with as swiftly as possible, so that he could get his mother to her new home the next day. After Voldemort had been defeated, the Ministry had determined the Malfoy Manor to be a crime scene, and closed it for use, permanently. They had only allowed Draco to fetch some personal belongings, thoroughly checked for dark magic of course, after declaring that it will never be in private use again. Draco felt ill at the idea of his home being turned into some kind of a war memorial in the future.
