that you do not tell anyone about this. The Ministry is already under enough fire from the public eye at the moment.”
“There was a second owl following the first one with more instructions, but it seems you left before it arrived.”
Draco felt something strange and sickening in his stomach. He wasn’t sure what he had expected - his father had been a Death Eater, of course he was involved - but he had never even heard of these Death Eaters before.
Harry felt his heartbeat speeding up, but he looked at the next letter. The handwriting was even more messy, and the sentences even more incoherent.
“You’re not. I mean, I’m not choosing. I don’t have to. I’m still friends with both of you, and that isn’t going to change. Things might be a bit weird, but we’re still… us. Okay?”
Draco felt something sink in his heart, and he looked away from Ivan, out the car window. “I’m sure… I’m sure you know my father was a Death Eater. We went to Hungary four years ago, on holiday. We stayed near the border to Ukraine. My father disappeared for a few days, for ‘work’. I think… I think he was one of the people who destroyed your village.”
“I can’t believe you swindled me into going out again,” Draco said, raising his voice over the thrum of the music.
Draco lay on his bed, trying to ignore the sliver of light that was coming through the crack in his sloppily closed curtains, because if he acknowledged it, that meant he would have to close it, and he did
Potter swore under his breath. “Malfoy, stay here in case Amyra wakes up,” he said, and walked off, following Bill.
“I’m going to put Teddy to bed, and then we’ll talk. Make yourselves at home.” She bustled off with Teddy, leaving the three of them standing in the living room.
"I saw Sirius being hurt. So I went after him. The vision wasn't real, Voldemort was using it to draw me out. But because I went after him, everyone had to come and rescue me, and Sirius died anyway. Trying to rescue me."
Draco and Pansy were standing by the podium, Pansy in a long, black dress with silver embroidery, and Draco in black dress robes with dark green and silver ruffling on the chest. His hair was styled neatly out of his face.
"I'm sorry," he said, breaking away from the hug. Padfoot barked happily, and started licking Harry's hand.
Harry flopped down on the couch, and sighed. It was a chilly Saturday morning, and he was under strict instructions from Robards (and Hermione) to:
They walked past a cell and the inhabitant ran to the door and started beating their fists against it, screaming, making Harry and Draco jump. The old woman remained unphased.
Malfoy jumped at Harry’s voice, looked at him, and then looked away. He looked pale. After a few seconds, he said, “Why do you think they let me be an auror, Potter?”
Malfoy looked out the train window. “Why would you say I wasn’t… I was a Death Eater, Potter. My parents are in
Harry stared at her. How had Sirius never talked about her, not even once? They must have been incredibly close if she knew about his animagus form. “He never mentioned you to me.”
Then, Quidditch had become like everything else - something he wasn't good enough at, something else for his father to pick at and yell at him for.
Ron was sitting on his bed, curtains closed, face illuminated only by the glow of his phone. Clothes were strewn all over his floor, along with an assortment of dirty crockery. He barely looked up as Harry walked in and sat on the other end of the bed.
“Down the corridor, your last left. They’re in a cardboard box. Have a look and take whatever you want.”
Despite himself, Draco was actually starting to have fun. He and Pansy danced terribly, but he didn’t care.
Just then, a blur of blond hair pushed through the crowd, and Malfoy stopped next to Harry, panting. “Sorry. Got- got caught up… came as soon as I could…”
“Do I really need to spell it out for you?” Robards sighed. “Obviously I don’t have all the details, seeing as I am not the one who committed the crime-”
He waited until Robards had gone into his own office, before undoing his disillusionment charm. Hermione did the same.
Harry smiled, and finally made eye contact with her. "I still don't understand why Sirius never mentioned you to me."
whew this took a long time to write, it is very... wordy and touchy feely lol. anyway, hope you enjoyed :) my update schedule is going to once again be erratic as school has started again so i have very varying levels of motivation :,)
Ginny walked through the kitchen door, and Harry quickly closed the folder. "Don't worry, I'm not coming to have a look at your top secret work. Just want to say goodbye before you go off."
“Just… don’t tell the others yet, okay? I don’t think Mum and Dad want you to think they’re kicking you out or anything.”
By the time Andromeda announced that supper was ready, Draco found that he was actually enjoying spending time with Teddy, despite the fact that (in Pansy’s words) he was as clueless with children as a Muggle with a wand.
They finally reached the large, oak, doors, and Pansy pressed the doorbell. They heard it echoing through the house.
“Draco,” Ivan said, bringing Draco back to reality. Draco smiled at the way Ivan said his name, emphasising the ‘r’. “Would you like to dance with me?”
The taxi ride was also spent in silence, but Harry could almost feel Malfoy’s tension rising. He was staring out the window, chewing his lip again.
Andromeda had made a delicious looking pasta, as well as a large butternut salad. Teddy had his own bowl of pasta with what looked to be ketchup and cheddar cheese on it.
They got to work just before 8, as planned, and the building was pretty much empty - most people arrived from 8.30 to 9. It was strange, without the usual bustle and noise.
The doors swung open, and Blaise stood there in magnificent blue dress robes lined with silver thread.
“I figured Robards wouldn’t just immediately agree that one of the Aurors is working against him. He would be much more likely to suspect someone else, and apart from us, the only other person who knew is, well, Malfoy.”
He was deliberately avoiding looking at Potter, maybe because he wasn’t sure why it was suddenly so easy to tell him everything.
When had they gone to Ukraine? Draco had still been very young - it had probably been his first or second year at Hogwarts. That was almost a decade ago, so it was safe to assume that Draco’s father hadn’t been involved in the destruction of Ivan’s village, and besides, they’d been in central Ukraine, nowhere near the border to Hungary.
“Er,” Draco said, awkwardly standing up (to the dog’s dismay), “it came in through the dog flap and tackled me.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco inserted the key into the door. He wished Potter wasn’t watching him so intently; however hard he tried, he couldn’t stop his hand shaking. He turned the key, slowly,
"Ah. Speak of the devil. You're two minutes late, Draco. It's alright for now, but we need to be on time in future."
He kissed her, and her tears mingling with the kiss suddenly reminded him of a time many years ago when he’d kissed a different girl after she’d been crying.
“Well,” Dean said, “you’re welcome to go knock on his door, but no promises you’ll be let in. Or that he’ll talk to you.”
Harry forced a smile. Ron had always been bad at reading emotions, but he couldn't blame him for thinking Harry's bad mood was due to missing Ginny, rather than seeing her.
“Doesn’t matter.” He looked over at Draco, who nodded. He grabbed his arm and closed his eyes, turning on the spot.
Amyra's smile became pained. "Well, while Sirius and I were good friends, I'm afraid your dad didn't feel the same way."
Draco jumped awake, holding back a scream. He was on Blaise’s couch, and a silvery blue lynx was hovering before him.
“We did it!” Potter said, punching the air. That got them a few strange looks from other people passing through the foyer.
Hermione muttered an incantation, and the peas picked themselves up and decanted into a pot of boiling water.
"My… my husband's a muggle, y'see. He don't know nothin' 'bout magic or anythin', an' I'd quite like it te stay that way, if yer don't mind."
“Er, thank you” Draco said awkwardly after a few seconds, “there’s, um, snacks. And it's an open casket if anyone wants to… yeah.”
Malfoy looked back at Harry. There was something strange in his expression that Harry couldn’t quite pinpoint.
After ten minutes or so, a sigh came from the desk, and he heard Hermione’s voice saying, “Alright, we’d better go before she comes back from her meeting. I don’t think there’s anything-”
“He looks more pissed about it than us,” Ron muttered under his breath. Harry nodded. Despite his usually cheerful demeanor, Robards looked tired. He had dark bags under his eyes, and he seemed skinnier.
The boat stopped against the small jetty that was tacked onto the rock, and they made their way up the winding path to the prison. Harry's stag followed them closely, dancing around them in circles.
“Yeah. Thanks, Dean,” Harry said, smiling. He walked inside, into a living area. Two other people he recognised were sitting on the sofas - Seamus and Neville, both intently focused on a video game. “I got them into Mario Kart,” Dean said to Harry, still grinning, “haven’t been able to get them away since. Hey guys, look who it is!”
“We’ve talked about it a lot, and since the three of you have moved out, we don’t need the space anymore. We’re selling the house.”
A singular carrot lay on the bottom shelf, along with some cheese that was definitely off, and butter.
“People aren’t one hundred percent good or bad, Draco. It’s not like all the good people in the world have never done anything wrong.”
friends - he wasn’t sure if they even counted as friends at all - in fact, the exact nature of his relationship to Draco was very confusing, and it made Harry’s head hurt.
"Stop making excuses for him," Draco said, trembling. He pressed her forehead to hers, closing his eyes.
They both looked at Hermione. “I- I don’t think it’s impossible,” she said, timidly, “I agree that we can’t be one hundred percent sure, but I think it’s worth being cautious.”
“One… two… three!” Draco shot a stunning spell up at the ceiling, and with a deafening crash, the area where he’d hit fell down, leaving a pile of rubble in front of the door.
Draco wrapped his arms around himself, shivering. Somehow, Potter didn’t seem to be that cold. The sea sprayed against Draco’s face, and he scowled.
“I’m impressed,” Lucius said, his face once again broken into a terrible smile. “You’ve learned more than I thought you had.”
"It's quite alright, Potter, just remember we're doing serious work from now on." Robards chuckled fondly at Potter's almost childish innocence. It was something that had been almost completely lost since the battle.
“This was a terrible decision, Pansy,” Draco groaned, twisting around to try and see the back of his dress robes. “I haven’t worn these things since Slughorn’s parties in sixth year.”
Draco turned to look at Potter, still in deep conversation with Robards. He watched as Potter bit his lip in thought, and looked at the way his hair stuck up in every direction, looked at how he was standing, with one of his feet pointing out at a weird angle, and Draco felt his hand subconsciously rising up to touch the silver pendant on his neck.
Granger held on to Robards’ arm, and Goldstein onto Langsley’s, and they disapparated. Draco looked over at Potter. “Well, good luck,” Potter said, and vanished. Draco closed his eyes, pictured the farm in his mind, and turned on the spot.
“Oh, no,” Draco laughed, and then paused. He felt his heartbeat speed up as he took a deep breath. “I’m, uh, I’m gay.”
Draco leaned in to Blaise, and said in his ear, "I think I might be a little bit in love with Harry Potter."
Ron choked on his chocolate frog. "I'm pretty sure that's impossible, mate. He's basically transparent."
“They should get Hermione in here,” Harry muttered, more to himself than anything, “we wouldn’t see her for a week, but the place would be completely organised when she emerged.”
Robards sighed, and shook his head. “Well, there’s no time. As you heard from the patronus message, there’s been a murder. One of us, and one muggle. It’s one of the people we were investigating about the Muggle killings.” Draco felt something cold wash over him. “Rexell and Max Parkinson.”
Hermione had turned back to the mess of papers strewn across the table, scrutinising the one closest to her with an intense glare. Harry sat down opposite her, and sighed. “I’m starting to think that Lucius Malfoy was just messing with us. We’ve been at it for a week, and there’s no mention of a location in any of these records.”
They had always been told that auror training was rigorous. Harry knew it was difficult to get in especially, because of the difficulty he had in Fifth Year to try and convince Umbridge that he could be an auror. He had almost had his dreams crushed after his O.W.Ls, thinking that he needed an O instead of an E in potions. But Slughorn had replaced Snape, and Harry had taken potions.
Harry shrugged. “Pretty much like I expected. He still needs time. Oh, and-” Harry paused, frowning, not sure quite how to tell Hermione that he was going to attend Narcissa Malfoy’s funeral.
a Death Eater, for fuck's sake. If I refuse to go and visit my father, they'll think something's going on."
“Well, you obviously needed outside help to do it. And, as Potter brought to my attention, it is very likely that there is a mole inside the Minsitry - and, well, you are the perfect candidate for that role. Now, this will be a lot easier if we don’t have to resort to Veritaserum, so I ask you once again - please confess to aiding Narcissa Malfoy’s escape from Azkaban.”
She nodded sagely. “I think we all knew that it wasn’t going to last. I mean, how many high-school sweethearts actually stay together?”
A sigh, followed by an explanation. “Because we work here, going into her office alone won’t trigger any spells. All we need is the disillusionment charm so that no one sees us. It’s quite simple, really.”
Draco stood on the end of the row of aurors, separated from the bunch. The majority were Gryffindors - pretty much all of them had chosen to be aurors. There were also a lot of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, but he was alone. Pansy had laughed when he’d suggested she apply to. “Even if was allowed in, I wouldn’t be able to stand it. It would just be Potter and his friends getting all the glory, and us on the sidelines.”
“I found it and came straight here,” Hermione said, once Harry had finished reading it. “I didn’t know exactly what they were planning, but I knew it was likely to be something with Malfoy.”
As he picked up the last loose piece of paper from the draw, Harry saw a glint of silver. He picked up a small, silver key. “Hey, Malfoy,” he called out, holding up the key.
“I think that’s normal,” Potter said, and Draco could feel Potter’s eyes on him. He tried to continue staring resolutely at the sky, but for some reason he felt his eyes being drawn downwards to lock with Potter’s. His face was illuminated by the moon and stars in a silvery glow, almost like a halo, and his signature emerald green eyes seemed to be speckled with gold.
Narcissa moved forwards, but was stopped abruptly by heavy chains that cuffed her hands to the wall. Draco moved to the point where she had stopped.
"Harry!" Mr Weasley said, and Mrs Weasley immediately gave up the chair next to Ginny's bed. George and Percy were also around her bed.
Draco looked at him. “You’ve been there once, Potter. I lived there for the best part of 17 years. I think it’s safer if you just take my arm.”
Draco nodded, and then put his hands on his face, running them back through his hair. “I’m sorry I didn’t text you, Ivan. I really am. The last week has just been-”
“Harry, here,” Amyra said, and scribbled something on a piece of paper. “Er, if you ever want to come over and walk Padfoot with me, I could use the company. It’d be nice to talk to someone about Sirius.”
Draco swallowed, feeling as though something unpleasant was lodged at the back of his throat. He started walking towards the gates.
"I was just trying to find you, but I didn't know what ward you went to." He pushed a strand of hair out of his face. "Anyway, how's Ginny?"
“I don’t know, embarrass yourself in front of one of the richest families in Britain by having your buttons done wrong, I suppose.” She finished redoing his buttons, and stepped away. “There. Perfect.”
Draco and Pansy had been sharing an apartment since the start of the year. Draco could have stayed in his parents' mansion, but it had felt too empty. Too big. And of course, it was haunted by the memories of the Dark Lord-
After her footsteps had retreated, he took a long, shaky breath and splashed cold water on his face.
“Yeah.” Draco sighed again. It was that kind of day. “What have you been up to, apart from narrowly escaping eviction?”
Ivan nodded. “The fact that you did not choose the easy route proves that you are a different person to your father. Despite your past, you still chose to help people, and save people. That is something to be proud of.”
“I think… I thought that I could just ignore everything, and then it would go away. But it actually just made everything worse. And now I can’t think about anything except her.”
Harry couldn’t help feeling like searching Elarena’s office was a bit pointless - even if they could search through all the clutter, what were the chances that she would be keeping something that incriminated her in her office?
“I…” Draco paused, unsure of the reason. It was as if something in his brain was physically blocking every other part of him that was screaming
“No. I’m leaving you alone so that the guy who’s been eyeing you this whole time has a chance.” She winked, and looked over his shoulder. Draco turned around, to see a man with long, blonde hair smirking at him. Draco blushed and gave a small smile back.
For a brief moment, he wondered what his father would say, but something that might have been the tequila made him think, fuck it.
"No," Harry said, "I was across the country, we'd just finished our work at Azkaban. I got an owl from Robards saying Amyra had been hurt."
Robards paused, considering his words carefully and throwing Draco a cautionary glance before speaking. “We, er, received word from Azkaban that, shortly after you finished your interviews, Lucius Malfoy attempted to escape again.”
Draco closed the journal. He waved his wand, and the onions tipped themselves into a pot along with some tomatoes and other ingredients. He ran a hand through his hair, staring at the journal.
They fought so much now, and they hardly got any time to spend just the two of them with Harry working every day. Even weekends were filled with writing report after report that they hadn’t finished during the week, and when Harry and Ron were finally finished it was all they could do not to pass out on their way up the stairs.
Harry turned the key in the apartment door, and stepped inside. “Hey, I’m back,” he called out. No response. Ron and Hermione must not have been dismissed for the day yet.
Hermione. And besides, Neville broke into the Ministry with us before. This time they wouldn’t even be breaking in - just helping us get to the right place.”
sometimes im like. 13 chapters wow that's so much! and other times im like how have i only written 13 chapters it feels like 70
“No, er, it’s okay,” Harry said, awkwardly sitting himself down on the bed next to Draco. He coughed at the small cloud of dust that rose up.
Draco let out his breath in a frustrated sigh, and began the long trek to his office. Everyone who had fought in the Battle of Hogwarts had automatically been given a job as an auror if they wanted one, except of course, those who had fought on the other side.
“Well, that was a complete dead end,” Harry sighed, slumping on the left hand side bed of the shitty motel they had rented. They were investigating a few more people in the area, so Robards had said it was best to stay there. Robards had his own room, while Harry had to share with Malfoy.
“Harry, leave it.” Hermione’s voice was still as exasperated as it had always been whenever Draco got a rise out of Potter.
He watched as the Aurors levitated his mother’s body out of the coffin, onto another table. They poured over her, streams of light from their wands illuminating her now gaunt features.
Harry thought for a moment. He couldn’t believe Malfoy would be involved in anything - he had been a Death Eater, but he had been forced into it…
“Ginny!” Mrs Weasley opened the front door. “Come inside, supper’s almost ready. Harry, take her trunk upstairs. Hermione, will you lay the table?”
They hadn’t seen each other in years - Andromeda had been estranged from the family since he was a child.
Draco glanced guiltily at the kitchen, where his phone had been sitting, face down, for the past three days.
Draco had hoped something might have changed about Potter, made him different, changed the way Draco looked at him. But it was still the same, except their rivalry took place at the Ministry of Magic instead of at Hogwarts.
“Hey, Leo. Hello. Yes, I love you too,” Draco said, laughing as Leo licked his hand excitedly and wagged his tail. “Yeah, I was gone a long time. Sorry. Did you survive with Pansy?”
“I don’t even know why I chose to be an Auror. I’m surrounded by people who hate me, and for good reason. My family killed their families. It would be so much easier to just… become a Healer, like Pansy, or, I don’t know, work at Gringotts.”
The last letter had been dated four months ago, and if they were allowed to send letters every three months…
“I’m sorry,” Draco managed to say, as though the words were a small hiss of air out of an over-filled balloon.
"It's alright." Draco smiled, and took a sip of his tea. Blaise made the best tea out of anyone, and that was a fact.
“Yes, quite - Nollit’s been in our family for decades, though. They can only forcibly free house elves if they want to go, and we’ve always treated her well enough that she wants to stay.”
“Thank Merlin,” Robards said with a sigh, running his hand through his hair, and completely ignoring Draco. “One of our other teams managed to capture one of those bastards, and he wouldn’t talk except to say that there was a ‘nasty surprise’ waiting at Malfoy Manor. It looks like he might have
“The one with the hair that looks like he’s been struck by lightning. The way you looked at him when you were talking-”
Ron rolled his eyes. “Great, I’m really looking forwards to Mum and Percy telling us what a terrible decision we’ve made.”
okay so this chapter took forever to write, partially because school started and i've been ridiculously busy, and partially because i was a bit stuck as to how to get the story moving again without it feeling unnatural. i'm not super proud of how this chapter turned out and it's a bit short but i did it, and i'm proud of myself for that :) anyway, hope you enjoyed, and hopefully the next chapter won't take so long!
He pushed the thought out of his mind. "It doesn't matter. It's not like I have a choice. It's going to look very suspicious if I refuse to go and see him."
his grandmother’s carpet, the hat stand he had almost broken as a child - Merlin, even his mother’s hats were still there - and the ornate lights on the ceiling,
(also, the title of this chapter is a line from funeral blues by w.h. auden. it's a really beautiful poem, i think a lot of people have heard it since it was used in the movie four weddings and a funeral but i would recommend listening to it. fun fact: w.h. auden was gay, but this poem wasn't written for a lover - funeral blues was actually originally written for one of his plays, spoken by the brother of a politician who died, and was meant to be satirical. after that, it was published in a separate anthology and most people interpreted it as a genuine poem about grief and love.)
P.S. - thank you for all the comments! i often don't see them when you guys comment because i get emails on my old email account, which doesn't show notifications on my phone, but i do read all of them (eventually) and i really appreciate the support <3
“He’s taken sick leave. I thought you would have known,” Robards said, frowning. Harry and Hermione exchanged a look. “Anyway, we don’t have time - we’re short-staffed as it is, and there’s a lot of work to be done.” He sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. “Listen up, everyone, continue with the tasks your supervisors have set you. Work quickly. We do not want the Muggle police getting their hands on all this. Granger, Potter, Malfoy - with me.”
“Sorry, I did not mean to sound creepy - I read the Prophet regularly; I know you are an Auror, yes?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “I don’t know why I bother, you’re always so mopey. Let loose a little! Maybe you’ll even start to enjoy yourself.”
"Hey there," Harry said, sitting down. Bill jerked his head outside, and Mr and Mrs Weasley, George and Percy followed him outside.
Andromeda’s house was small, but cozy. They apparated into her living room, which had two sofas and an armchair in front of a fireplace. She pointed her wand at the fireplace, and it came to life.
"Oh," Potter said. "Well, it's a difficult spell. I guess I forgot most people weren't in Dumbledore's Army."
“We’ll cover up our tracks! Please, Pansy. They didn’t have any family members that the dog could go to. He would have just sat in a rescue centre for the rest of his life.”
“No. Of Sirius. You have that same fierce look of wanting to prove yourself. James was much more arrogant- he seemed to think he was already the best at everything, whereas Sirius felt like he was still fighting for it.”
Draco snapped out of his own mind as Robards and Potter began to fly downwards. Potter let out a whoop of joy before plummeting directly downwards, going into a perfect swan dive. Draco followed him at a slightly safer and slower angle.
“Right. We have 12 official aurors, and 23 trainees. Two trainees will be assigned to each senior member, based on your performance in training sessions so far. I’m going to be completely transparent - you all know roughly how well you’re doing - and start reading out lists of names from the pair with the worst performance so far. Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot, you’re with Reginald Illings.” Kingsley continued to rattle off names from his list.
He shuffled some papers on the desk, and glared at Draco. “If you simply admit to helping Narcissa Malfoy escape, and to working with the Purists, then-”
Most of it was what you would expect - paperwork, case files, etcetera. Harry opened the top draw of the desk, and looked around. More of the same - spare quills and ink, parchment paper.
She was lying on the bed, eyes closed. Her body was wrapped up in bandages around her torso and right arm, and there was some kind of drip going into her arm.
Harry took the page. Phone number. It was unusual for witches and wizards of her age, especially purebloods, to use phones, but Harry was incredibly grateful for it. Phone calls were a lot quicker than owls.
“Alright, Ms Collins, I think we’re going to need to take all of these journals, if you don’t mind.” Robards walked back into the room, Draco in tow.
Leo opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Unperturbed, he silently barked again, and then licked Draco’s hand.
His hair, usually so perfectly styled, looked like it hadn’t been brushed. There were dark bags under his eyes, and his shirt was wrinkled, the top button undone.
He wasn’t sure exactly how long he’d been lying there. He had drifted in and out of a restless sleep for a while, and then resorted to a useless attempt to untangle his thoughts.
“Oh,” Harry said. He sat up, turning to face Malfoy. It was strange, the two of them having an amicable conversation, as though almost a decade of hatred and rivalry hadn’t happened.
Malfoy explained everything, and Robards’ eyes widened, and then his face broke into a grin. “Fantastic work, boys! Well, I think the next step is fairly obvious.”
The study was at the end of the left-hand passageway. Draco started to walk towards it, but found that his legs stopped working when he reached the second door.
The two dementors outside Lucius’s cell drifted to the side as Harry and his patronus walked towards the door. He put the key in, and turned it.
“Well, yes,” Robards continued, turning back to Collins. “I’m Robards, and this is Potter and Malfoy.”
An hour of painful eyeliner and painstakingly chosen outfits later, Pansy and Draco headed out into town.
Harry wasn’t really sure why he cared so much whether Draco was on time or not. His feeling of worry didn’t seem to stem from concern of whether or not they would get to Malfoy Manor and make some headway with the case, but rather from concern for Draco himself.
Draco snorted. “It’d just be me, then. Father’s in Azkaban, Bellatrix is dead, I don’t have any grandparents left, and I highly doubt that Andromeda would want to come.”
One of the other Aurors stepped forwards. “Potter, Robards is your superior. This behaviour is unacceptable.” She had long, blonde hair and cold, piercing blue eyes.
Draco sat up. “No.” He squinted at Potter’s face, which was becoming slightly more discernible as his eyes got used to the darkness. “Can’t sleep.”
“Thank you all for being here. I understand that this isn’t the most conventional of funerals, and that it might feel strange for you, but… thank you. I appreciate it.” He paused, and looked around the room, making eye contact with Harry for a second before quickly looking away.
They were only a minute late, but Robards still looked extraordinarily stressed, pacing up and down in front of their desks as they walked in.
Pansy nodded. “At her funeral, the Ministry showed up, and accused Draco of faking his mother’s death to smuggle her out of Azkaban. You know, like how Barty Crouch Jr. did.”
Pansy put her hand over the Mark. "I know, Draco. But things will get easier, even if they don't get altogether better."
"I want to be there. Of course I do. I'll try, Ginny, I really will, but I don't have control over how long this trip is going to be."
Draco looked at the floor. His heart was beating faster and faster, but he couldn’t think of anything to say.
"Don't both of you have work to be doing?" Hermione had walked over to them. Her hair had been trimmed to shoulder length, and was tied back in a neat bun. She looked very professional, unlike Ron and Harry.
“You’re the one who should be apologising, Blaise. But that’s not important right now. Draco’s in trouble.” Pansy glared at him, her gaze seeming to push through his cold and distant mask.
Andromeda deposited Teddy on the floor with the dragons. “I’m nearly with the cooking - won’t you keep Teddy entertained while I finish up?”
"No offence, Harry, but dreams aren't exactly reliable sources of information," she said, standing up as the kettle started to whistle, and pouring some tea.
He looked down at his unwashed shirt and sweatpants, immediately regretting his decision, but deciding it was too late to back out.
"Thank you, Mrs Weasley," he said, smiling and taking her offering of food. Ginny followed close behind.
Harry picked up today’s Daily Prophet, looking to peruse an article on garden gnomes, but unfortunately the front page caught his eye.
“That is a shame. Ukraine is beautiful. Especially the countryside. I come from a small town, Berehove, right near the border to Hungary. I love it there.”
"You didn't come back with Ron and Hermione?" Ginny asked. "They were here when I woke up, but they had to leave pretty quickly for something work-related. I thought you were going to be with them."
"No. I'm not… I'm not…" Harry put his head in his hands. The last time he had felt this kind of anger, this
Andromeda held up her hand, and Harry stopped. “Harry,” she said, “I understand where you’re coming from. Believe me, I do. But even if we manage to get him out, what do you suggest we do with him? Not to mention all of us will be on trial for aiding his escape.”
Draco looked at her, and their eyes met. Suddenly Draco felt overwhelmed - here, sitting at this table, was the only family he had left. Except for his father, but… well. Draco wasn’t counting him.
Potter was staring out into the open sea, his face silhouetted against the grey morning sky. His curly hair was swept back by the wind. Draco watched as he bit his lip and adjusted his glasses.
The person deflected Draco’s spell, and they started to duel. After a couple of seconds, Potter joined in too, but even their combined efforts at flinging spell after spell at this person seemed to do nothing.
“Do you want to come to the funeral?” Draco said, before he could stop himself. He wasn’t sure what had made him say it, and he felt his heart leap into his mouth as Potter turned around, surprise etched across his face.
Harry looked at Malfoy. He noticed the bags under his eyes, how his hair was greasy and unkempt, his clothes scruffy. It was very unlike him.
"Listen, just…" This couldn't happen. Not now. "Hermione offered to do all my work for this weekend so we could spend time together. Please, just let me take her up on that. I'll spend this weekend with you, and then I'll stay on top of my work these holidays so I won't always have extra stuff to do. I can make this work. I… I don’t want to lose you."
“Thanks, you’re a gem. Teddy, this is your Uncle Draco,” she said, kneeling down to Teddy’s height and pointing at Draco.
Hermione shook her head. “He moved in with Dean and a couple of others, in a shared res kind of thing.”
Harry nodded, and turned back to Amyra. He waited for Robards and Malfoy to leave, and then said, “Your dog. It’s called Padfoot.”
Hermione shrugged. “A bit better.” She took a sip of her coffee, and then looked at her watch. “Merlin, Harry, it’s almost 8. We should go.”
with that blood traitor and rivalry nonsense? We’re all on the same side now, and that side is helping Draco. Or have you forgotten everything he did for you in school?”
“Sh!” She hissed at him, and tapped her wand to his head. He felt the sensation of cold trickling over his body, and watched Hermione do the same before she blended in with the wall.
“You don’t have to say anything, but… I love you, and I’m here for you if you want to talk, or if you want to watch a movie and eat ice cream, or if you just want me to sit with you in silence.”
And now, he was going to attend the funeral of Narcissa Malfoy, a woman he couldn’t have spoken to more than a couple of times - although, she had saved his life - a funeral which would also probably be full of ex-Death Eaters and Slytherins.
“Is this… your bedroom?” Potter asked, and Draco nodded, having almost forgotten that Potter was there too.
As if she hadn't noticed him before, Narcissa's eyes roamed over him. "Harry Potter," she said, her voice still weak, "you're the last person I would have expected to come and visit me."
The whole room was framed around the huge, ornate chandelier hanging from the middle of the ceiling. Directly underneath it on the floor was a large circular rug, with runes woven into the patterns.
Draco blushed, looking away. “No, I just… despite everything that just happened, and my- my mother, I don’t actually feel too bad-”
Draco walked over to his closet, and opened it. All his green school robes were still hanging there, along with some of his casual clothes. He reached up to the top shelf - which he could now reach easily, whereas he used to have to stand on tip toes - and pulled down a black box.
Draco kept his eyes on the back of her head as she opened the door. He couldn’t see the person on the other side, but he froze when he heard a familiar voice.
"I… the Dementors kept crowding around us, because Lucius was shouting so much. He was just shouting, shouting, screaming at them, screaming at me… then he went quiet for a few days, and I thought…" Harry noticed a tear trickle down her cheek. "But he was okay. He was just… planning. Then, once the Dementors had stopped paying so much attention to him, he managed to get out of his cell. He woke me up, he opened my door too, and wanted me to escape with him. I said no, it wouldn't work, I was too scared, and then…" She gestured to the bruises on her face as more tears fell.
Blaise had inherited his parents’ house. Similarly to Malfoy Manor, it was a huge, sprawling place on top of an isolated hill.
“Harry, the Prophet is full of shit. Stop reading that nonsense,” Hermione said, snatching the newspaper from his hands.
It was a quite a while before the door swung open, to reveal Andromeda, wearing a green knitted sweatshirt with a white ‘A’ on the chest, clutching Teddy in her arms, who was resolutely chewing on what looked like a toy dragon.
Draco undid and redid the top button on his shirt three times before finally deciding on undone, and ringing the doorbell.
Harry frowned, and opened the next letter. The handwriting was messier than the first, and it was shorter. Some of the ink was blurred, as though it had gotten wet.
“Okay, Granger, Goldstein, Potter and Malfoy - with me and Langsley. We’re going to the scene of the crime to have a closer look and scare off the Muggle authorities. The rest of your report to your superior officers, they’ll tell you what to do.”
Lucius Malfoy’s left eye was closed, swollen and purple. He had a cut on his eyebrow and forehead, and blood still seemed to be trickling out of them.
Andromeda wanted to come to the funeral - not only that, but she wanted him over for dinner to ‘catch up’?
“I’m just saying, Ron, Kingsley shows us exactly how to perform the spells. Just copy him exactly, and-”
“That’s pushing it,” he scowled, and sighed, turning to face her. “I can’t believe you roped me into this.”
As they arrived, Robards pulled a wallet out of his pocket, which contained a piece of blank paper. He held it up as they approached the police standing outside. “MI5, we’re investigating a string of murders similar to this one. We’ll take over from here.”
“Oh, nothing, Potter. I thought for a moment that you’d forgotten how to speak.” The snarky comment was out of his mouth before he even thought to hold back. He regretted it almost instantly. Everyone here already despised him, what was he doing, pissing off their golden boy?
He was trying desperately to make it look more acceptable by staring at the reflection in his tiny phone screen when someone called his name.
“I thought you might need it,” she said, “I thought we both did.” Andromeda sighed, deeply. “I know I haven’t been a part of your life. I stopped talking to my family when you were a toddler. But… after the war, I got a letter from Narcissa. I didn’t read it, at first. Didn’t think she’d have anything to say that I’d be interested in hearing. But my curiosity got the better of me, and I read it eventually.”
He heard Pansy swear under her breath before responding. “Where are you? Go home, I’ll meet you at the apartment. Okay?”
Draco only realised he hadn’t moved when Potter pulled out his wand and said, “Lumos.” Blue light filled the hallway, casting long shadows down its length.
With another groan, Harry turned back over, and moved to a sitting position so that Hermione could sit next to him.
"This way." She walked inside. Harry exchanged a look with Draco before following her. "You're here to see Lucius Malfoy," she said, more as a statement than a question.
They reached the next floor, where the guard was waiting for them. She handed Harry a key, and jerked her head towards the nearest cell. She then left them, walking down the staircase.
Potter looked like he was going to keep talking as the Aurors moved past them, but Draco reached out and grabbed his arm. “Don’t. It’s not worth it.”
“I’ll tell you, Draco, because I’m proud of you. And because I hate those people, anyway. They made me a failure in the Dark Lord’s eyes.”
“Fine. You, being aware of the fiasco with Barty Crouch Jr., decided to join forces with the Purists in order to plan some similar scheme and get your mother out of Azkaban. She managed to get out, with the Purists’ help, but was undiscovered as she was quickly replaced by someone who disguised themselves as her, who then quickly died from some other condition. It would have gone unnoticed, had we not inspected the body and discovered that it was not Narcissa Malfoy, but in fact an unknown Muggle who had been magically enchanted to look like her.”
“Harry,” Hermione began tentatively, “how many times did you think Malfoy was behind all those schemes at Hogwarts? And how many times was he actually not involved at all?”
“He definitely was. At least, at first. He’s mentioned less as time goes on, but from what I can gather, I think the Dark Lord sent him to check up on them. He was kind of a correspondent.”
“Even if we manage to rescue Draco, it’ll be very difficult for us to expose the Ministry without them covering it up, even if we have proof. But I know you have contacts in the Prophet. If we provided evidence, would you be able to convince them to publish an article about how Draco was framed?”
“Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. No visitors are allowed in this ward,” the nurse said again, trying to pull Harry away by his arm.
They closed the door behind them, and the dementor slowly floated back to its post. Harry’s patronus also trotted up next to them, keeping pace as they walked down the corridor and up the stairs.
“Er, no thank you,” Pansy said, “we’d better get going. We still have to… break into the Ministry, I suppose.”
Robards sighed. “Potter, if it eases your mind, I will have someone look into this. But I guarantee you, the other Aurors are innocent.” He ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t suppose you found anything new in the records?”
“Maybe another time. Let’s stay in touch.” He pulled a receipt and a pen out of his pocket, and scribbled his phone number on the back of the receipt, handing it to Draco, who pocketed it. “Goodbye, Draco.”
Amyra sighed, and ran a hand through her hair. "I'm sorry, these probably aren't the anecdotes you want to be hearing about your father."
“I’m sorry. I just… I was at this guy’s house, and I panicked and left, and Pansy probably has someone over right now, I didn’t know who else to go to-”
Harry watched Pansy’s fist clench in frustration. Hermione, sitting next to him, was stiff as a board - the tension in the room seemed to ooze into every crevice.
“I have to go to the Manor,” Draco said, surprising himself and Potter with the determination in his voice.
It had been only a month or so after the battle. Blaise, Pansy and Draco had needed to distract themselves from, well, everything, so they had decided to head out and get completely hammered.
His first instinct was to be cold and distant towards Potter, but that was probably a bad idea - if he closed himself off, it would only make Robards more suspicious. Besides, he had nothing to hide, anyway. The smart thing to do would be to become even closer to Potter, and make sure he knew that Draco wasn’t hiding anything.
“Yes, it has.” She glared at him. “I can’t even begin to fathom why you thought this would work. They can't be trusted.”
The hallway lights flickered, but came on, illuminating the passageway completely, and almost drowning out Potter’s spell.
“And hey, it’s not all bad. Hermione’s been begging me and Ron to move out for ages, because it’s important to be independent or something. At least she’ll get off our backs.”
"Harry. There's nothing we can do right now. Let's regroup, and try to clear our heads. Then we can figure out what to do. Alright?"
Harry nodded. He immediately felt calmer; something about Andromeda made everything seem a lot safer.
"... Anthony's sweet, but he's honestly a bit useless. He just copies whatever other people- Harry?" Hermione stopped her ramble about work when she noticed he had stopped.
Harry’s own heartbeat was considerably faster than he liked it. Panic began to set in. “C’mon. Let’s go get Ron.”
Draco hung up, and leaned his head back against the bathroom door, willing the tears to run back inside his eyes.
“Thanks,” Draco smiled at Luke. It had just dawned on him properly that Luke was a Muggle. He had no idea that magic existed, no idea that Draco was a wizard.
“Oh. Sorry, now probably isn’t the ideal time for a ramble of analysis about high-school relationships and trauma.”
“It is working! Just- just trust me, okay? On three, aim your spell at the ceiling just in front of the door, okay?”
Blaise stirred his cup of tea. "I shouldn't have got so angry at you, Draco. I was just frustrated."
Harry felt increasingly awkward. Hermione and Ginny were chatting like they’d been best friends since childhood. Was Ginny being deliberately cold, or was he imagining things?
It was a large room - larger than Draco’s bedroom, and it wasn’t as if that room had been small. A pair of dusty, maroon curtains were almost drawn, letting a sliver of sunlight divide the room.
She looked up at him again, indignant. “Harry, we’re not even halfway. We can’t just give up now, especially after all you went through to get these.”
Everyone dispersed, looking around the room. Granger pulled out her wand and started muttering spells to reveal anything hidden. Potter began opening drawers at random, ruffling through the papers inside them. Robards and Langsley bent down over the bodies, using their wands to find traces of magic. Goldstein took out a notepad and began writing on it.
A small voice in the back of Draco’s mind said that no, he wanted to resist the spell, he didn’t want to confess, but it was quickly overwhelmed by the feeling that it would be so much easier to do what Robards wanted.
Harry quickly followed him, trying to get out the door with him, and bumped into what must have been Hermione in the process, but managed to squeeze out after Robards without too much trouble.
They stopped before the gates. Potter reached out to try and open them, and Draco grabbed his hand. “Are you
“I would prefer for all three of you to go,” Robards said, looking anxious, “three heads are better than one.” He laughed nervously, looking pointedly at Harry.
okay i promise i won't keep you waiting for the next chapter so long i know this was a terrible place to end but !! i am going to try updating weekly from now on. so we shall see how that goes for me. anyway. draco is babey and id die for him wbu
“Yeah, Potter, no shit!” Draco shouted back, joining back in to the flurry of spells against their opponent. “We can’t apparate inside the house, we need to get outside!”
It was a few moments before he realised what had woken him, the remnants of his dream still fuzzy in his memory - an owl was tapping at the window, a letter clutched in one of its claws.
Draco stumbled over to the bar, brushing his hair out of his face, and ordered another drink, giving the man a sideways glance. He had chin length dark hair, and dark eyes. He was clean shaven, and was wearing a button up with the top few buttons undone. As Draco reached into his pocket to pay for his drink, the man put some money on the counter and slid it towards the bartender.
Potter's hair was swept back, and he had the same blissful expression Draco remembered from school. It was the same way Draco had wanted to feel.
“Merlin. I know- I just want you to know that you’ve got family. If you ever need someone to talk to, or somewhere to crash, I’ve got your back.”
Harry opened the journal. Every page was blank. For a moment, he thought of trying to write in it to see if it responded like Riddle’s had, but realised that it was probably implausible for Malfoy to have died and hidden his memory inside a diary while still having a physical form. It was probably in invisible ink.
He tried to ignore the way his heart was pounding erratically against his chest, and the way he could feel his hands shaking as he put his wand back into his pocket.
“Good, good, come into my office.” Robards gestured at a door, and Harry opened it, Robards following behind him. “Go on, have a seat! You’re not in trouble, don’t worry.” The old man smiled, an endearing expression on his face, which seemed to be more lined with worry than usual.
Harry knocked on the door of the apartment. It was a nice enough place, although it looked smaller than their apartment, and this one was supposed to house four people.
As the wind rushed past his ears, whipping his hair back, Draco grinned. He wasn’t sure why, but something about escaping death at his old house on a broomstick, with one arm clutching a safe full of top secret information and the other around Potter’s waist made him feel elated.
“I’m with Harry,” Ron said, walking back to them with his arms folded, “I don’t really feel like trekking all over London looking at other apartments when this one is perfectly good.”
No. He couldn’t ghost Blaise for months and then just walk into his apartment in the middle of the night.
The guilt was there, but Draco was used to it. He'd had the same feeling in his gut for years, from the first time he'd realised he liked boys and not girls, until he'd first met Potter, and every waking moment since then when his thoughts had drifted from his family duty to the dark haired boy that intrigued him so much.
Pansy laughed. “Yeah, you did. And it stuck with me, because it often feels so much easier just to lock everything away and pretend it’s not happening than to deal with it. But you can’t keep doing that. You’re going to have to deal with it eventually, and the longer you pretend, the worse it gets.”
Ginny's frown enveloped her entire face. "Harry, I understand that you're busy with work. I know how difficult it is for you right now. I was expecting you not to be able to come today, or not come right away… I told myself it would happen, but it was okay."
Before he even had time to react, Draco felt the feeling of relaxation wash over him, and heard Robards speaking in his mind.
They walked up a winding set of dilapidated stone stairs, and into a long passageway lined with cell doors.
Merlin, he didn’t even know if Potter was queer, he’d only dated girls as far as Draco knew - but Potter had just been a childhood crush-
“I think… I think I’ve got something.” He pulled his hands and the book away from Harry’s, and dashed over to the table where all of the journals were.
The door opened once again, and this time Blaise stood behind it. His neutral expression turned almost at once to a look of disgust when he saw Harry, Hermione and Andromeda, and he scowled at Pansy.
Bleary eyed, Draco opened the window, and the owl swooped inside, dropping the letter on his bed before swooping out the window again. Draco shut the window after it, scowling at how early it was - the sun had only just started to rise - and picked up the letter.
With a pop, they landed, at the start of a long, stone walkway leading up to a huge, cast-iron gate.
They heard a scuffle from inside, a dog barking, and a voice yelled, “Coming, one second- down, boy!”
It was with great difficulty that Draco walked into the Glass Onion on that Wednesday morning. Polky had insisted that Draco stay at Yarrow Manor because of the full moon due that evening, but he needed to see his friends.
A moment passed before Draco got their meaning, and blushed in return. “Oh wow, okay. Urm. Have fun, I guess.” He turned around and tried his hardest to quell his awkwardness and find calm in Carole King, but the embarrassment continued to grow until Draco stood to shove his belongings in his satchel and clear the area.
Draco had seen the Dark Lord practice Leglimancy on unsuspecting Death Eaters over the summer, but he never thought for a second that his professors could do it. It was an obscure and forgotten branch of magic, and it sent his mind into overdrive. What would happen if Professor Snape had seen his transformations? The task? His muggle friends? Being silent wasn’t going to be enough, he needed to protect his mind.
What had been a rather good start to the morning had turned into something from a cheap, paperback gothic novel. Dazed, he slowly opened the van door, heaved himself off his seat and went to check on the boy.
Luna seemed confused, “Because you were really struggling, Draco. Of course I would help you. Wouldn’t you help someone in a situation like that?”
Eir waved his matchbox of cigarettes, with an amused look on his face. Draco remained silent, but nodded in agreement. Eir moved out from behind the counter, and guided Draco to the door.
Draco bristled, irritated by his friend’s pity. “Oh fuck it all. I couldn’t care less about what some old fart thinks of me.”
They made their way out of the shop and down the street to Niamh's parlour. Eir asking Draco every couple of metres if he was sure that he wanted to go ahead with it. Draco was certain though, he wanted to go back to Hogwarts with a piece of the summer with him. A pile of muggle clothes wouldn’t go down well.
“Look lad, you can spend time ‘ere if you want. Listen to some music, hell, even work here to keep you out of trouble before school starts again. But you need to go home to your parents and start getting clean. You got a place nearby?”
Draco felt a great sense of relief as he left the shop, a grim smile plastered on his face as he headed up towards the hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley - he’d done it, the plan had been set into motion. As he turned back on to Diagon Alley, Draco was ambushed by a flurry of robes and bags.
Lucius had left shortly after leaving his task to Draco, and was ambushed by Aurors on the way back to the Malfoy Manor. Narcissa hadn’t told Draco, but she would have to before Hogwarts started again. He was going to be carrying a lot on his shoulders this year; she wished he was just a normal boy again. As a wife, she was greatly shaken by Lucius’ arrest but as a mother, she felt relieved. Narcissa was, despite everything, a very good mother.
“You haven’t run away have you? Look I know parents and life can get bad but running away or getting hooked on smack is never the answer.”
Draco wasn’t a killer, he couldn’t do what his father needed. At school he was known for being a bit of a bully - and often hexed people for no good reason - but working for Professor Umbridge and the Dark Lord were two very frightfully different things. He was too exhausted to feel angry, but somewhere in Draco’s mind he thought his father was a coward.
Draco watched as realisation played across his friends’ faces. Blaise stepped forward to place a hand on Draco’s shoulder, their face grave. Pansy shot Draco an odd look from where she stood.
Draco shifted under Blaise’s weight so that his lungs didn’t feel so tight, and Blaise looked up, their chin on Draco’s chest. “You have really bad morning breath.”
This is what his world was now. Was this another Great War? The DA last year suddenly seemed like a brilliant idea.
Draco bent down to get his books out, content to be alone for the rest of the afternoon, and almost jumped out of his skin when he sat back up and to find Potter sitting next to him.
“So, what’s up? Still wanting to go ahead with the new look?” Eir glanced at Draco over his shoulder whilst he locked the front door.
Draco’s neck cracked as his whipped to the side, and his cheek flared up a nasty red. Lucius pointed his wand at his son’s face and stood very still.
It was a generally accepted fact among Hogwarts students that Sunday was the best day of the week. Draco loved the lie-ins till eleven, and the brunch that — for him, at least — consisted of too many hash browns and beans, coffee and tinned peaches. Most students had been to Hogsmeade on the Saturday, so they could lounge around in common rooms or by the lake with their Honeydukes chocolates and sweets until after tea, when there would undoubtedly be a mad rush to finish homework last minute.
As Freddie Mercury’s voice faded and the Muggle radio host read out the news, the trio caught their breath. Eir opened the window and lit the joint. They passed it around as they soaked up the late summer sun.
The breeze was warm against his skin, and Draco let go of the tension in his shoulders as he began to write the letter for his mother. Their letters had never been very heartfelt, and this was no different. Draco tried to keep his reasons behind needing to become an Occlumens vague and related to The Task — to whatever and whoever he may have to deal with. He didn’t mention his panic attack.
“Well thanks, Niamh. Feels great.” Draco grinned at his friends. They hadn’t quite grasped the concept of the wizarding world, but Draco supposed that they never truly could.
Narcissa drew Draco slowly behind her as Lucius stopped his pacing and turned to stare into the ashes of the cold hearth. Draco reached down to squeeze his mother’s hand, and he suddenly felt like he was a small child again.
The two friends were hugging each other, Potter’s impish face buried in Lovegood’s silvery hair. And as Harry pulled away, Luna shifted so that she held his face, whispering comfort to him.
Hours later Draco’s palms were sweating as he stood outside King’s Cross with his mother, the brick building looming over them. He shook himself before heading inside at a brisk pace, his feet moving subconsciously through the station as he fidgeted with a loose thread in his pocket.
enchantments that Wizards across the globe and ages had achieved. Draco was sent to learn how to fix one, a cabinet. It was currently sitting in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts. Draco’s kill-Dumbledore-and-not-expose-yourself task also came with some dandy side quests, including fixing the Vanishing Cabinet. Borgin was somewhat of an expert in fixing wizard furniture, it was a pity he an unsavory character.
With his left ear throbbing and glinting in the sunset, Draco was overcome with a sense of sated happiness as they walked away from the shop.
Eir and Niamh were sitting cross-legged on the floor of the small room, surrounded by piles of vinyls, tapes and CDs. They looked up in surprise when he passed through the fly screen. Draco started to fidget, anxious and aware of the limited time he had. For the first time since he had met Eir, Draco felt distinctly odd standing in his robes in the Glass Onion.
The last month had been a nightmare. The Malfoy’s and Black’s had always been proud, pureblood families with ancestry dating back to the Medieval ages, which administered plenty of pressure for all affiliated. The Dark Lord was the radicalised essence of the drivel that drove many of the pureblood families, and his father. It was this that lead to his father’s punishment. Shame, dishonour, humiliation. Draco was suspicious of muggles, muggle-borns witches and wizards and half-bloods, he was always told they were lesser. But lately muggles had been kinder than his own father. And he was a dark creature, a monster. Not any better than the scum on a muggle’s shoe.
Potter shot Draco an incredulous look, “That’s not true, I’ve just been doing a lot better this year.”
Draco had realised the benefit of having dyed his hair early on— it disguised him somewhat, his natural platinum colour no longer a visible symbol of his lineage. Sometimes, he was not recognised for enough time to pass that he could comfortably single out the main gossip mongers and add them to his list of the untrustworthy. It was dimly amusing to then have to hold friendly conversation with these types in the evenings, when they deemed it safe to talk to him again. His enhanced hearing helped this process greatly.
Goyle angrily grabbed his duvet from the floor and stormed to the bathroom, slamming the door behind himself. Draco smirked at Blaise. These had been their respective roles since first year. Blaise comes in early, Draco then attempts to get Goyle out of bed before Blaise resolutely removes him from it.
They passed through the barrier in silence and Draco took a deep breath as he opened his eyes to platform 9 ¾. The familiar hustle and bustle of farewells, panic of first years and excited reunions brought a smile to Draco’s face — this was something he had missed. He scanned the crowd for familiar faces, his smile turning into a grin as he spotted his fellow Slytherin sixth years.
Draco gave a weak smile as he was handed a massive, chipped mug from some amusement park which was filled with saccharin milky tea. If anyone he knew were to see him now, cradling tea against his chest, no less from a muggle, they would be stupefied. He watched with bewilderment as Eir lifted the needle and changed the record, and sounds from New York city played.
Brutality and violence reminded him of his father, Death Eaters and the war currently raging on in the world he found himself increasingly disconnected to. Oppression was something he found himself slowly coming to terms with. Being a werewolf in the wizarding world would mean that finding any kind of decent job or partner or friends in the future would be infinitely more difficult. Draco had always been secure in his privilege and superiority over his peers, but now he was lower than anyone he knew.
“Everyone, you should all be taking notes from our Harry here. Building bridges and setting aside his differences by choosing to partner up with Mr Malfoy over there.”
Draco muttered his thanks, and swiftly left the room, his lips twitching upwards as he made his way to the kitchen.
As Snape glowered at the incoming students, Draco took a seat at the back of the classroom with Pansy, cackling about the new decor — Snape was really letting his disturbed, emo heart show with the dark, twisted portrayals of torture and death that lined the walls.
There was a pause before Pansy spoke up; “I suppose it’s something to be proud of, actually. I mean, I know my parents would be honoured to host the Dark Lord. And to be there at His side throughout the rest of this war…” She tapered off and Draco saw a strange glint in her eye - a kind of reverence. It disgusted him.
“We all communicate in different ways. You can differentiate between Paul and John, André 3000 and Big Boi or George Micheal and Andrew Ridgeley. And it's like everyone has their own language that speaks from their heart to yours.” Eir touched Draco’s sternum with his forefinger.
Blinking as his eyes adjusted to the brightness of the room, he suddenly felt keenly embarrassed and exposed, and glanced down to see that he was indeed still wearing the fleece he’d been put into earlier that morning. A wave of shame overwhelmed him as he thought of someone seeing him so vulnerable and defenceless.
The musty, barn-like scent of the circular room had become something of a comfort to Draco over his years at Hogwarts, and he felt his simmering anger fade to exhaustion as he found a windowsill to perch on.
Potter shifted to the far edge of his seat. Draco attempted to focus on Professor Slughorn as he spluttered out his instructions for their practical, but he’d lost any sense of respect for the man long ago and instead just willed for the idiot to shut up. This afternoon just c
“I don’t want you to think I am prying where I’m not wanted, but let me tell you this. Life goes on, the present turns into the past and the past fades. Like cars and trends and clothes, shit goes away, you’ll forget it. Instant comfort when you fail or disappoint or someone hurts you is dangerous, it doesn’t fix anything. It’s all shit that goes away eventually. You’ll just make things worse.”
Madam Pince gave a short nod in Draco’s direction as he entered. He actually had been spending a lot more time here compared to usual, wasting away his evenings in the name of ‘Studying For N.E.W.Ts’. In actual fact, Draco had been trying to find a moment of peace in a quiet corner at the back of the vast room — away from any unwanted social interaction.
Eir was sorting a pile of records into a crate. “Fucking weird, that. You’d think it’d be way more developed.”
Eir grabbed Draco’s shoulders and moved him to the only proper chair in the shop. Draco curled up on it and lifted his head to give his friends a weak smile. He cringed at his feebleness.
“Possibly…” Borgin was infuriating to deal with, and Draco was beginning to lose his patience as the pathetic man tried to dance around committing to the task at hand. He couldn’t afford any setbacks and Borgin was the only person he could realistically use.
“Yes. Absolutely gorgeous.” Luna paused a moment. “I used to watch her work at her easel, she always used bright, bold colours. So vibrant and strong.”
He didn’t get it, wasn’t Potter supposed to be all for peace and prosperity for all? Why did he continually have to antagonize Draco just for the hell of it? Of course, it was usually the other way round, so Draco had to admit that it was no surprise that Potter would act like that.
Eir looked at him incredulously. “How can you say that? It’s a fucking classic! It questions the whole idea of existence, the ethics of extreme class divide, our consumerist culture and its effects on the environment, artificial intelligence, cloning ... need I go on?! There’s more, trust me.” The alcohol was causing Eir’s words to slur together slightly, as he waggled a pointed finger in Draco’s direction.
Eir set the needle down, and string instruments sounded. Draco started cheesing as the opening beats played.
Narcissa gasped and froze. This had been her worst fear, while Bella was delighted. Her mirth was clear. Severus moved from his seat to lean against the window frame, he matched his long, black curtains. It transpired that he knew of the plan, the tension in Narcissa’s body was alleviated slightly. He was choosing his words carefully too.
Draco followed her gaze to look out onto the valley, the mountains a harsh silhouette against the blended shades of pinks and oranges. The surface of the lake rippled as a soft breeze sauntered across the landscape. Draco often resented that he was so accustomed to the view, because it genuinely was just so beautiful, and he almost never took a moment to appreciate it.
Eir shot him a sympathetic look and squeezed his shoulder. Draco hadn’t told Eir nearly as much as he had Niamh, but he knew enough to understand what he meant.
Draco couldn’t remember a time at Hogwarts that he and Blaise hadn’t been friends. It had just been the two of them since those horrendous pureblood gatherings as kids. Draco had always liked how Blaise, quiet as they were, had always been so sure of themself. Blaise had an opinion on everything, and ‘compromise’ was not a word they were familiar with.
“Well, I think it could be very beautiful.” Luna wandered over to the windowsill and sat across from Draco. “And what a beautiful sunset, too.”
Draco tried to focus on his breathing, the way his feet moved almost subconsciously towards the dungeons. He’d always loved how Hogwarts was truly a home to all — even those who didn’t deserve it. He certainly didn’t.
Taking deep breaths to calm himself down, he took in his surroundings. Realising he was without his wand he felt vulnerable, exposed and acutely aware of his isolation. The forest was out of the question, too freshly stained with horror, but the scene before him was equally unfamiliar.
His father had become more and more paranoid, short-tempered, manic; the betrayal and hatred burned in Draco’s chest, hot like acid.
Pushing his way past a group of wizards, Draco groaned in embarrassment as he recalled the incident between himself and Potter while getting his new robes. The constant paranoia of the seamstress moving his left sleeve all the time - possibly exposing his Greyback scar - and the presence of the trio had made him particularly aggressive.
Draco shook his head into the pillow and mumbled a “No”. His exhaustion was overwhelming and chess wasn’t going to remedy it. Vince and Greg carried on playing and noisily exchanged sweets and bits of gossip. Thankfully, Draco heard nothing about himself — though they would have told him first.
Harry laughed awkwardly. “Er, sorry. We’re here about something more serious.” He glanced around, and everyone was looking at him expectantly. “It’s about… it’s about Malfoy.”
Draco turned around, and saw Pansy waving at him. He pushed his way through the throng of people to meet her.
“...So, we can’t easily get into those parts of the Ministry without Robards being suspicious. That’s where you come in. If you want to help, I mean.”
“Well, it’s still technically all under my name, because Father’s in Azkaban. But there’s some stuff that specifically belonged to Mother that she had in her will which needs to be distributed, or whatever.”
Ginny rolled over next to him, but didn’t wake up. Harry decided not to wake her, pulled on his slippers and a jersey, and tip-toed out their room.
Draco had decided that the best way to deal with his mother’s death was to try not to think about it, and throw himself into work.
The train came to a stop, and the doors hissed and slid open. Malfoy stood up and got down his luggage, avoiding Harry’s gaze.
After a few hours of flipping through various journals, he began to feel frustrated. There were many more mentions of the Purists, but nothing that led them anywhere - only ramblings about how they were ridding the world of evil, and who they were targeting next. He took note of all the names of victims they mentioned, just in case.
Pansy pulled him into a hug, which he returned half-heartedly. Potter was pacing up and down, his eyebrows pulled downwards in a frown. Andromeda had Teddy hoisted up on her hip, while he played with one of his dragons.
Draco quickly moved away from the door as it opened, and Potter and Granger walked out. They closed the door behind them, and Draco followed as they walked down the hall, talking in low whispers.
Harry watched as Draco sat down on the bed, and opened the box. It was a moment before he realised that Draco was crying.
“Well, I don’t see why not…” Robards shrugged. “Finish investigating the house and then... I suppose you’ll have to apparate with him.”
"Ah." Pansy opened her mouth as if to say something, paused, and then continued tentatively. "Draco, I… I don't know much about what your father was like, but don't you think… it'll be good to confront him?"
Harry tuned out their bickering once again, and found his eyes came to rest on Malfoy. His beanbag, like Harry’s, had disintegrated first try. Malfoy was impressively good at magic - at a higher level than most of Dumbledore’s Army.
“Oh. Right.” They walked over to the fireplace, and each grabbed a handful of floo powder. Harry stepped in before saying, “Ministry of Magic,” and dropping the powder into the fireplace. In an eruption of green flames, Harry was whisked away. At this point he knew to keep his eyes and mouth shut, and his elbows tucked in, but it was still an unpleasant experience.
“Wait here, I’ll be right back,” Potter said, and he ran inside. A few moments later, he sat back down, holding a small jar. “This is Hermione’s signature move,” he grinned, and pulled out his wand, muttering something and tapping the jar. A bright blue flame erupted inside it, and he quickly put the lid on. Draco immediately felt warmth spread throughout his body.
"Whatever gave you that impression?" He said, with a bit more menace in his sarcasm than Hermione deserved.
“Yeah.” Hermione tucked her hair behind her ear. “Sorry, Harry, I came and asked how you were and just started talking about me. How are you doing? With Ginny, and everything?”
"It's alright, kiddo," she said, "thank you for coming to make sure I was okay. I can tell you with full confidence that Sirius would have done the same thing."
They walked into the main room of the small cottage, which was once presumably the living room, but had had its usual furniture removed and replaced with a coffin, a podium, and a small collection of chairs facing the two.
Granger made a noise in the back of her throat as she saw the bodies, which was mimicked by Goldstein, who looked like he was going to throw up. Robards and Langsley looked grimly onwards. Potter had a twisted expression on his face - it was somewhere between intense sadness and rage.
Robards was about to speak, but Parkinson gave him a look, and cut him off. "It's the police, Max. They just have some questions about the robberies that've been going on. Why don't you go finish up with the sheep, an' I'll answer their questions?"
Harry began to follow him, but stopped, realising that Hermione hadn’t moved. She was staring at the gates, her hand clutched over her right forearm.
Eir was counting the register for the day when he heard hushed voices outside the shop. A moment later, Draco - wearing the same clothes as the previous day - came staggering through the door.
Narcissa sucked in her breath and closed her eyes for a moment. Draco knew he had pushed it too far — Father was in prison and he was basically sentenced to death. He didn’t like hurting his Mum.
Blaise put their hands up in surrender. “Okay, okay! I was just worried — it’s okay if you’re not always feeling ‘
“You are a Dark Creature with the Dark Lord’s blessing and curse. The Dark Lord has his reasons for what he did to us, but this is unjustifiable. Go and get changed into something more suitable.”
The moon reached its peak, and Draco fell forward with a gasp of pain as white hot agony blurred his vision. His limbs began to dislocate themselves to then be relocated in a new, unfamiliar formation. Draco squirmed on the ground, his nails scraped against the muddy ground as his mind was turned inside out from the searing pain. The burning sensation of his skin became almost unbearable as his fur broke free until, quite suddenly, he was overcome with relief.
“Well that was fucking weird, care to explain yourself?” Blaise clamped their hand down on Draco’s shoulder, making him jump.
We say this every time, but sorry for the long wait on the upload of this chapter! We're both A-grade procrastinators, and we're both at uni now. So no promises about more regular uploads, but maybe we'll get in more productive moods. We definitely want to carry on with this fic, as we love writing it and we love the characters a lot, so don't worry if you don't hear from us soon :)
He’d always been taught that muggles were lesser than himself, that anyone who’s blood had been tainted by them wasn’t worth his time or respect. That being part of a family in the Sacred Twenty-Eight meant that he was leagues above his non-pure blooded peers. And having been brought up in a sheltered wizarding family, he’d never experienced anything to oppose this ideology. He’d never had the opportunity to spend time in the muggle world, never interacted with a muggle besides the one next to him. And so he’d come to think of muggles as monsters; nasty, foul creatures. But recently, he’d come to the realisation that maybe he was the monster. A dark creature unworthy of honour or praise.
And she meant it. Narcissa vowed then to herself that she would do everything in her power to keep her son safe. It was apparent that no one else was concerned for him. Not even his father.
Narcissa missed the way her son used to be, the way they used to confide in and support each other. Lucius had always given Draco trouble for being closer to her, instead of him. He believed that Draco needed to learn from his father how to be a man. It would do no good spending too much time with his mother - he’d become too soft, her husband would say.
Peering up at John with one eye open, a brief look of confusion took over the boy’s features. After looking at him for another two seconds John added, “Maybe I should lend you a jumper?”. He received a slow nod of the affirmative nature and John went to the van to get his spare fleece.
“Lucius don’t be ridiculous. He wouldn’t have asked Draco to do it. What kind of a man are you? To put our son, our
“My apologies. He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it … you were saying, Narcissa?”
“I hope for your sake we’ll be making headache-clearing Potions today, Draco.” Theo said, clapping Draco on the back and nodding in Potter’s direction. “I’ll leave you to it.”
“So what does that mean, that there’s a whole other world that we know absolutely nothing about?” Eir looked incredulous.
Quickly glancing down, he saw his arm was limp, a crusty gash ran up his forearm to meet his dislocated shoulder.
Lucius stared at him and asked who he thought it was. And the only person other than Harry that entered Draco’s mind, was Dumbledore. But surely not. How could his father kill him? Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard alive - other than the Dark Lord of course. Besides, his father would never be able to get in to Hogwarts.
Draco took a deep breath, and suddenly his heart was beating very fast. Honesty wasn’t something that he was taught as a child, but it was something that Muggles cherished.
Narcissa had gone to get murtlap essence from her supplies, leaving Draco alone in the dining hall. She had hastily assessed his wounds and tutted at the primitive muggle medicine. A few diagnostic and healing spells later, he was feeling immensely better, but had still not said a word. Narcissa didn’t initiate any conversation either.
Eir came out of the stock room and looked between the two of them. He quickly came over and gave Draco a hug. Draco finally felt those hot tears breach the dam and he softly sniffled in to his friend’s shoulder. After a while, they relaxed and stepped away from each other.
Niamh shook her head, her arms making wide, sweeping gestures as she argued. Though she be but little she is fierce, Eir had said to him, and he agreed.
Draco’s eyes darted up to find Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini at her side, weighed down with various bags of school supplies and clutching a melting ice cream in her right hand. They both seemed to be shocked at Draco’s presence.
The tops of trees rustled in the late summer breeze in time with the two—beat of the Thestrals trot. Potter was still staring. Draco turned to him, and instantly regretted his decision.
Polky had packed a combination of Draco’s muggle and wizard clothes into his trunk, along with some of Eir’s ‘special baccy’ and various other wizard things that Draco resented greatly. Who needed a golden cauldron or spellotape when there might not be occasion to use them once the Dark Lord reigns? Just quietly tape up a book spine when Death Eaters cleanse Gloustershire of Muggles and Half Breeds? Draco snorted and relaxed into the bath water.
Bellatrix gasped behind them. Narcissa knew it was considerable ask. The Unbreakable Vow was ancient magic, the basis of the Wizarding world. Severus looked deep into her eyes, blankly.
At the beginning of the Spring Term of their fourth year, Blaise told him that they were genderqueer, a term they’d found in a (Muggle) magazine and said that they wanted to use they/them pronouns.
Draco groaned as he turned to see Potter, having left Weasley and Granger mid-conversation, weaving between desks towards him.
Draco found his owl — a large, tawny eagle owl Narcissa had picked out for him during their trip to Diagon Alley — and attached his letter to her leg. “It would be very helpful if you could make this a quick trip, Nuwanda.” The owl ruffled her feathers, snapping at him until he gave her some treats. “For fucks sake, could you go now please?” She squawked at him one last time before she took off, visibly taking her time about it.
Narcissa straightened herself out and mirrored Severus’ body language. She was here for a reason and no amount of distrust on Bella’s part was going to stop her. Severus seemed to sense Bellatrix’s defeat before looking at Narcissa.
A painful lump formed in his throat. Draco felt completely helpless as he finally reached the entrance to the Slytherin common room. He took a moment to calm himself, managing to stop the tears from falling before he walked in.
Draco raised his eyebrows and gave a small smile "Really?". He looked around the clustered little shop, considering Eir's offer. The walls were covered with film posters, newspapers and magazines as a cheap alternative to wallpaper, and shelves were concave, bursting with records, cassettes and VHS tapes. The counter beside Draco was sticky, plastered with stickers, stained with mug rings and tea splatters. He gestured to the clunky machine with too many buttons, sitting proudly atop the counter and said, "Alright then. But you'll have to show me what to do with that…
Lunch was some rolled ham and mayo sandwiches from the new bakery ‘Routledges’, which Eir adorned with salt and vinegar crisps. Draco was apprehensive about the mixing of flavours and textures but once he tried it, he found the northern delicacy delightful.
“Well maybe I’m not ‘lurking about’, maybe you’re just being a creep and following me around,” Potter raised his eyebrows, "and my common room happens to be at the bottom of the castle, so I spend a lot of time in shadowy corridors?”
They both wandered upstairs, Eir was rolling a joint. Niamh had been preparing all afternoon for the evening’s activities. There were semi burnt biscuits scattered around in bowls, and bags of crisps strewn across all available surfaces. Draco noticed the plastic bag full of the necessary items on the kitchen counter and got excited. Finally, the transformation would be complete in time for school.
Draco frowned. He had never heard of Amyra Collins, nor any Death Eaters with that surname. Her parents must have died before He Who Must Not Be Named returned.
Ivan was silent for a few seconds. Draco turned back to look at him. “You are not your father,” Ivan said, frowning slightly. Draco wasn’t quite sure if it was a statement or a question.
Draco was vaguely conscious of the chains unwrapping, and of his arms being grabbed, and of the terrible cold washing over him as Dementors accompanied him to a small cell.
“Well, I think it’s a wonderful idea,” Percy said, nodding solemnly, inciting a murmur of agreement.
Harry stared at himself in the mirror, and sighed. He knew it was pointless to try, but it was still a bit disappointing that he couldn’t make his hair any neater.
“I still don’t understand why we’re at a Muggle bar,” Draco said, just loud enough that Pansy could hear him over the music.
A second crash behind Draco made him turn around, to see a broken window, and a broomstick floating next to Potter.
He stood up as they approached. “Good, you’re here. Let’s go. I can take you with side-along apparition; it’ll be easiest.”
“Or you would, if you’d buttoned your dress robes up correctly,” Hermione sighed, and moved forwards to fix them.
Draco snorted. “Says the girl who almost failed her OWLs because she fell asleep in the Charms exam.”
"So, this is the first time you've done any field work. This kind of investigative stuff is usually fairly simple - they don't want to talk, and we don't have a warrant, so we're not allowed to force them to. However, it can go south very quickly, especially when we're dealing with offenders like the Parkinsons. Just follow my lead, and don't do anything stupid, and you'll be fine."
He turned around to see Andromeda Tonks, looking as surprised to see him as he was to see her. Teddy was walking beside her, his hair silvery-blond. Teddy spotted Harry, and ran up to him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s legs with a cry of, “Uncle Harry!” Harry realised with a jolt that Teddy’s hair was the same colour as Draco’s.
"Forget about it?" Draco snarled, and yanked up the sleeve of his robe. "How the fuck is anyone going to forget?" The Mark on his arm was still there, although faded. "This will never go away. I will always be different from them."
He had always loved flying. It was something he had been good at, and not only that, it was something his father had encouraged and praised him for.
Harry and Draco stood in silence, for a few moments before the lift dinged and the doors slid open. Harry practically sprinted down the hall, Draco close in tow, before reaching ward E4. He shoved the door open to reveal a large room with a few beds, nurses and doctors milling around in green Healer’s robes.
“Harry, quickly, there’s no time-” She ran forwards to Draco. He looked at her in surprise. “Listen, you have to go. Somewhere safe, where the Ministry won’t find you, they’re going to-”
Draco smiled, but he still couldn’t shake the feeling of guilt. Voldemort had destroyed Ivan’s village, murdered everyone he knew-
“Er, I thought you knew - Ginny woke up from surgery just over an hour ago,” he said, his eyes now drifting warily to Draco.
Harry sat up in bed, shaking, in a cold sweat. He was breathing fast, and it took him a few seconds to realise that it had been a dream.
“I’m not making excuses for him anymore,” Draco said, and his voice was firm. There was a fire behind his eyes as he turned and walked out the room, Harry following.
“We have one major problem,” Hermione said, “the Aurors who took Malfoy know that we’re on his side. If we try and go anywhere near him, I’m sure we’ll be stopped.”
“Yeah! I can’t wait. It sucks that I’ll still have to go through all the original auror tests while you guys got a free pass, though.”
attacks on muggles recently. We can’t disclose too much information, but it seems to the Ministry that there is a possibility that these attacks are being performed by some ex-Death Eaters, or copycats. We’re going round to all known offenders to try and figure out who might be behind them.”
Draco snorted. Robards and Potter looked at him quizzically, and he coughed in a lame attempt to hide his unprofessionalism.
Harry felt tears burning behind his eyes. “I… it’s okay, it was… I get why she did it. I was a pretty shit boyfriend.”
He nodded. “Merlin, my grandparents will be rolling in their graves. I don’t think a Malfoy has ever died without at least fifty people pretending to be sad at their funeral.”
Robards nodded. “Exactly. We need to get those records out of Malfoy Manor as soon as possible, and seeing as you three are the only ones apart from myself who know of their existence…”
Robards knocked on the door. They heard a dog start barking, and then footsteps. The door swung open, to reveal a middle aged man with greying hair, wearing a red flannel shirt and cargo shorts.
Hermione nodded. “I suspected the same thing when both the people we interviewed were attacked. No one could have known that we talked to both of them unless they were told by someone who already knew, and while it is possible that the Purists are getting rid of people that could incriminate them, it’s highly unlikely for them to start in the same order that we have been interviewing people.”
Draco was perched on top of the stool behind the counter, all four long limbs folded like a nervous child being berated. Pale and otherwise sickly looking, one could be forgiven for assuming he is a junkie. Sunken in eyes, fresh scars and exposed splotches of bruises reaffirmed the heroin junkie stereotype.
Draco huffed but didn’t contest it as he recalled the long hours he had spent with Crabbe to ensure him a decent grade. They both knew that he would’ve failed otherwise. Still, Draco couldn’t help his disappointment at being abandoned by Vince to be alone in a classroom full of Gryffindors.
Draco winced, remembering all the times in summer with Eir and Niamh when he had been trying desperately to remove himself from the wizarding world. And in doing so he had forgotten to write to his friends, so deep in depression that he hadn’t even wanted to think about them.
Pansy made a grunt of agreement, and Greg began to recount some incident with Finnigan he’d had earlier that day. Draco’s cringed — it didn’t seem fun to watch others getting bullied anymore. And it was with a certain kind of clarity that Draco realised just how incredibly pathetic it was to laugh at a fellow student getting bullied by a
Draco waited outside the Potions classroom and rolled a cigarette. He hadn’t smoked since he last saw Eir and Niamh and so decided it was finally time to break into his stash of muggle wacky baccy. After class he would go to the owlery and climb on to the roof and smoke. Good plan.
Potter I know you’re there.” No response. “There’s no use in hiding, I knew you were in here as soon as you performed your little acrobatics stunt over an hour ago — you’re really not that subtle.”
“Detention, Saturday night, my office.” said Snape. “I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter … not even
A beat passed. Without looking up from her copy of the Daily Prophet, Narcissa said “You're free for day.”
Eir was always saying things Draco didn’t understand, he had no idea what a ‘penny’ was, so this was no exception. “Huh?”
Blaise was perched on the armchair in the room watching the boys pull on socks, comb hair and straighten robes. Their sharp eyes pierced Goyle’s duvet and they sent a sharp gust of icy wind with a swift flick of their wand.
Sitting on the window sill, Draco looked out into the murky depths of Kielder Water. When he was little, he loved coming to the manor in the summers. Draco had always marveled at the gatehouse and slate steps and magic of the ancient home. He’d spent hours sitting by the window, trying to spot fish or merfolk. The long corridors and vast, empty rooms provided infinite hiding places in which he’d read until dinner.
