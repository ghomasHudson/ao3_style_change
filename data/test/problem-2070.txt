“No, it’s fine,” Harry insisted, smiling. He did mean it. He’d do anything for a good friend. Whether or not Ginny did like him, he wasn’t going to bail on her. He forced himself to calm down and kept moving, a bit quicker this time. They were nearly there.
Harry recalled the alarm on Draco’s face when Harry had realised what he’d said earlier, which he now noticed, mirrored the panicked look Draco had when he’d said the same thing.
“Say what? Do tell,” quipped Parkinson, eyes alight with interest. Harry bristled when she took place calmly next to Draco. And then kissed him on the cheek.
“Bit late, am I?” Harry murmured. Draco chuckled genuinely, the warm, gentle sound vibrating from the Slytherin’s chest to Harry’s cheek where he rested. “You’ve always been an oblivious git, but... no time worse than never, Harry.”
It was a thorn in Harry’s pride, a reference Malfoy had made to last week. It had only been an accident… It wasn’t his fault he had mixed up anticlockwise turns with clockwise turns.
What was wrong with him? His stomach fluttered as an image of the Slytherin appeared, but this time with that soft, loose expression of concentration he had back in the Potions class before… the love potion.
He watched as Malfoy stirred the pot slowly with a copper ladle in silence, his face screwed in concentration but lacking the severe scowl it had whenever he was around Harry. It was an abnormal sight for him, Draco’s soft features laced with his hardened silver gaze, waves of silky blond hair hanging off his head onto his face. Realising he didn’t want to be caught staring, Harry quickly busied himself with preparing the next ingredients.
There was a beat where Draco would have snickered, but it was filled in by Pansy Parkinson— Hermione’s partner —as she walked up to them.
“Bloody hell,” Ron sighed, but he shared a grin with Harry. “Sore loser, that one is.” He scrambled up. “Better get changed before she hexes my nose off or something,” he joked. “See you at breakfast, Harry!”
Harry tried to stumble into the parting crowd but Snape wasn’t finished. “Potter. I noticed you were the one who prepared your ingredients. Perhaps
Harry tried to bite back a retort, but to no avail, he had to retaliate. “I’m actually not worried at all,” he replied, returning the smile blandly, “just concerned that if you’re so obsessed with me, you’d actually let a
“I see you have finished your potion, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter.” Snape appeared beside them, peering into the cauldron — Harry had let out a sigh of release as he was cut off from Draco’s nonplussed expression.
“...I do not tolerate students blowing up their concoctions and wasting the school’s potion supplies.” There was a delicate pause. “Am I clear, Mr. Finnigan?”
It annoyed him greatly, a grand, bristling sensation that made Harry’s hair stand on end at the thought of Malfoy’s perfect, pale lips curled in contempt.
Harry opened his mouth to protest but was silenced at the metallic pang of Draco’s tapping on his Prefect badge.
Maybe Ginny didn’t like him. Immediately, something in the back of his mind gently reminded him of when Hermione had come up to him earlier after dinner, telling him to, “Be honest about it, Harry.”
“I will begin by reminding the Gryffindor students that potion instructions must be read correctly, and followed carefully,” droned Snape as he began the class. Harry yawned, resting his head on the desk as Snape proceeded to list all the rules, one by one.
Harry drummed his fingers on his goblet of pumpkin juice, thinking about what Ginny had asked earlier. As hard as he tried, he couldn’t think of anything she’d possibly need to ask him in private like that. He bit back a yawn, tired from his early wake. He stole a glance at Ginny, chatting loudly with her friends. What had caused her to squirm around him?
“Honestly Ron,” Hermione sighed exasperatedly, rolling her eyes. She looked at Harry with a carefulness that looked almost prepared. “Isn’t it obvious? She
“History of Magic,” she started carefully, ignoring Ron’s groan. “Charms, Herbology, Transfiguration. We have a double Potions class with Snape at the end of the day.”
Draco’s lip curled distastefully, and Harry forced down the rising anger— he couldn’t bring himself to name what it probably had always been. Ginny threw a hand to her mouth, the blood draining from her face.
“Oh, hello Harry,” Hermione acknowledged as she looked up — albeit a little sulkily. She quickly noticed his attire and gasped.
Harry reached for his assignment, ducking to avoid Snape’s intense glare as his work was snatched from him.
“That’s so crazy,” he heard Ron exclaim to Hermione. “Totally weird. She’s my sister! Did you know?”
“I’m a prefect. Do you know what that is?” He cocked his head slightly and spotted Ginny. His eyes hardened.
, that had leaned in and kissed Draco. His eyes widened in horror at the impulse, his senses going overdrive, craving the touch. He felt Draco’s cool hand rest around his cheek, eyes fluttering shut and for once, relaxing. It was everything to Harry. He smiled and let himself get lost in the kiss, feeling alive.
Harry bit back a groan of annoyance — he could recognise that snarky, posh voice from anywhere. He ignored it, unable to hold back rolling his eyes.
Harry froze with shock, mouth agape. Was it true? He hadn’t ever thought of her that way. Did she really like him like
Then in an instant Harry realised what had come out of his sound had sounded horribly wrong. Nothing worse could come out of noting Draco smelt more in a room full of love potions. Then it was his turn for his eyes to widen, as ironic as it was.
still hasn’t learnt from their first-year ingredient preparation.” He continued before Harry could speak, “I wonder what this potion smells like to you. Probably that... mudblood, Granger.”
Suddenly there was a shriek as Ginny had been seized and shoved away from Harry. It was Draco, who had pushed her from Harry and taken her place, his face dangerously close with Harry’s. Draco’s silver eyes flickered up to meet his, a question burning in his eyes.
He looked swiftly back at Draco only to see his features settled and once again cool, if not for the wild glint in his eye. He watched the Slytherin smooth down his robe as if he had been unruffled the entire time. A silence lapsed over them again, but Harry was too bewildered to care.
He ran a hand through his tangled, black hair distractedly as he approached Malfoy, avoiding his gaze.
Harry braced himself to lunge forward and tackle him if it weren’t for Draco’s sudden, panicked look. He held back, suddenly very confused. Had Snape come up to them? He glanced around, not spotting Snape but catching Hermiome’s intense, startled gaze at him from the desk beside him.
“Erm, yeah,” Harry muttered, busying himself with his pancakes and bacon. What was wrong with him today? He tried to change the subject as unobviously as possible. “What have we got on today, Hermione?”
“Of course, whatever you need,” he replied, “How about you meet me at the Astronomy tower after curfew? We can sneak past Filch with the cloak.”
“Why aren’t you at your station?” His gaze flickered to Malfoy. “Draco. Don’t make me regret partnering you with Mr. Potter.”
As Malfoy sat back to watch the potion turn a sickly shade of pink, Harry had to cut the unfamiliar, silent tension — this felt different to the aura that had hung around them whenever they argued. It was delicate, wary. Harry wanted to tear it to shreds.
“Not as incompetent as you thought then, Malfoy,” Harry growled. Draco met his gaze with aloof amusement, making Harry ball his hands into fists.
Ginny let out a laugh of astonishment at the vivid sky and Draco whipped around at once. This was the last person Harry wanted to see, but
There was no denying now that the smell from Harry’s potion definitely smelt like Draco. As he stalked back to the towers, deep in thought, he realised two things.
“Oh my, what do we have here?” gasped Pansy mockingly as she glided up the stairs, her prefect’s badge catching in the light. “Harry Potter!” She noted Ginny with surprise. “And a little
“Oh, c’mon Hermione,” Ron groaned, elbowing Harry as he sat down beside him — Hermione was still scanning, ignoring the protests of her pieces as she insisted they sit still. She gave up with a huff as they eventually ignored her and moved off the board.
Draco’s eyes widened, sending a glare towards Harry. Any previous warmth was obviously now nonexistent. “Sorry, sir,” Draco apologised. “I’ll make sure Potter learns how to
“To reinforce my earlier statement, I will be pairing up one Slytherin and one Gryffindor each for today’s tasks—” Snape continued, and Harry’s heart dropped. “—to create the love potion that we studied in our previous session.” There were always tens of other Slytherins to be paired with, but Snape had always made sure Harry was to be with Malfoy.
“Watch where you’re going, Potter,” Draco sneered unpleasantly, shoving him lightly. Harry tensed up, his cheeks flaring. He could smell Draco’s sharp, minty intoxicant lingering in the air gingerly as he paused for a response, but Harry moved to his desk in silence. It wasn’t the tiredness, but the recurring thought of Draco throughout the day that had caused him to weird out around him.
Snape’s eyes twitched in response to Pansy, but his steel gaze remained trained on Harry. He tutted. “Has Mr. Potter lost his voice? Remember what I said. You are dismissed.”
He’d distracted himself from that peculiar thought of Malfoy in classes with a strange focus he didn’t realise he had. He remembered the astonishment on Hermione’s face beside him when he managed to transfigure his pumpkin into a rabbit before she could.
a love potion. Then again, that must still be difficult for you.” Harry was trying his best to keep quiet until Draco continued.
Hating the silence but more particularly detaching the focus of Malfoy’s oddly obvious smell, he commented as bitterly as possible, “I could say the same for you,
Harry couldn’t get out of the dungeon fast enough, inhaling deep breaths of air as he released himself from the heavy fumes.
The nagging, angered sensation in his gut came to life and seized his sides as though he was being bound with tight ribbon. Harry suddenly felt alarmed at the flare of adrenaline, even though it was a common feeling he had around Malfoy, but it had suddenly become unfamiliar. What he recognised as anger had drastically morphed into a newfound emotion, something much stronger and dangerous, but still something he hadn’t felt since…
“Erm.. are you going to say something?” Harry continued. He was beginning to worry. Was something wrong?
He listened in dread as the Potions professor began to list the pairings, watching students from both parties scowl or glare as they made their way toward each other. Harry avoided Draco until Snape had listed every pair except… surprise, him and Malfoy. Brilliant.
Doubt surged into his thoughts. Would he give her a chance? Harry pushed down the rising doubt, but — with a certain Slytherin in mind — found with dread that he wished it wasn’t the case.
“Fine,” Harry coughed, straightening. He joined them and walked off toward the Gryffindor towers. There was a collective, silent groan as Malfoy and Pansy whisked past them, snickering.
Harry smiled and buried his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck as Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Then how can you say you didn’t deserve to live when you wanted no one to die?”
Harry remembered the way he saw Malfoy yesterday, full of blood, hatred, and fear. He wanted nothing then but to stop and kill his nightmares just to make him feel better. If only he could kill someone who’s already dead, he'd kill Voldemort again for making this boy in front of him suffer. Now, upon seeing him at such a vulnerable and weakened state, Harry wanted to do nothing more but to wrap his arms around the other boy’s body and cradle him in his arms, sheltering him from the entire world and never letting him out of his hold again.
“No, it’s not!” Draco’s voice was hoarse from all the screaming. “How can you say it’s fine when it’s not?!” He was wailing, and Harry didn’t know what to do but to hold him and to listen. “If I had just made the right choices! If I wasn’t blind to my father’s prejudiced thinking! If I had acted from the start, everything might turn out differently! If-If I didn’t agree to kill Dumbledore, if I had warned him, if I had told him, if I have sided with him!! If only I did, then no one would have to die! Everyday, inside my head they scream at me telling me it’s all my fault that they died. That I didn’t do anything. That I was too much of a coward to act… Harry, I should have died with them! How can I be living like this if I was supposed to die?!”
“Oh,” was the only word Draco could say. He was speechless He can’t come out of anything to say. He didn’t know that
Draco gasped upon remembering his mother. He squeezed his eyes shut as he held on. “Harry…” He let his tears fall again, it never really stopped.
“It is nice to see you two finally getting along. But I will still be taking 50 points from each of you as a consequence for your actions.”
He bet on Draco but the conversation he had eavesdropped on right now clearly affirmed that it was Harry.
Hurrying up to his feet, he felt relieved to find his roommates sound asleep. He made sure to bring his invisibility cloak to prevent inquiries as to where he was going.
“I miss you every single time.” Harry buried his nose on Draco’s pale neck to inhale his addicting scent once more. “When we go out of that door, I’ll miss this moment already. If only they knew then we won’t have to hide.”
Minerva was able to snap out from her stupor when the footsteps of her students had faded. She sighed deeply while shaking her head. “I can never understand young love.”
“Shh, it’s all right. I’m here now. I’ll protect you,” Harry managed to say. His hand went from caressing Malfoy’s hair to cupping his cheek, wiping the tears away. Green eyes met blue ones and Harry can’t help but to press a loving kiss on his forehead.
Having felt the action, Malfoy clutched onto Harry’s sides as he crushed his face onto the Gryffindor’s chest. He allowed himself to sob harder.
“Malfoy!” Harry recognized that it was Crabbe who yelled that. He looked sideways to where the remaining Slytherins were, his emerald green eyes dark and malignant, and made it clear that he wanted the two of them out of his sight.
Ron, upon seeing his friend distracted again, gritted his teeth. No, he can’t lose another bet. He shouldn’t have defended Harry and declared that he won’t get distracted during class. He shouldn’t have!
When Harry’s lips bumped on Malfoy’s, Malfoy’s breath hitched and his blush grew darker. When Malfoy decided to keep his lips shut, Harry parted his own lips and locked both of Malfoy’s lips between his, and licked.
But then he wasn't that Malfoy anymore so maybe– just maybe– he might receive a much calmer reaction. He could also just tell him that this lavatory was the nearest from the Gryffindor tower. That would give him a way out.
Upon seeing Harry’s discernible expression written clearly on his face, the two boys quickly ran away. The other nearly tripping against the other, and actually tripping down, as they both carelessly scurried away.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. His hands clenched into fists and his body involuntarily shivered again just like before.
Harry then remembered what Draco last told him, to search for him even when he can’t be searched. What did he really mean by that?
Draco let out a small laugh that almost sounded like a huff. “Yeah, right.” He didn’t want to be with Harry today so he abruptly stood up but his vision threatened to turn black. He would have fallen over if it weren’t for Harry’s strong arms that were suddenly around him. One around his waist and the other around his shoulders.
Draco didn’t look at Harry’s eyes when Harry turned hm around. His pair of gray eyes was affixed on the floor. Even when Harry’s free hand went up to caress his pale cheek with his thumb, Draco didn’t look at him.
Draco initially played with Harry’s hair but he went to grip Harry’s shoulder when the kiss deepened. Eventually, his arms rested around Harry’s neck. Draco wasn’t even doing anything. His tongue is not even answering to Harry’s insistent one because he didn’t have the power to. Harry feasted on his mouth, tasting him, sucking him greedily, and didn’t even give him the chance to move. He felt completely helpless under Harry’s sheer dominance.
"What happened? What happened to my sweet sœur?" I said quickly, wanting an answer as quickly as possible.
"I... I was just wondering why you were all getting drunk off your arses today, instead of last night?"
He finally found it, tried to push his sleeve up as quickly as possible, and sunk his blade straight into the skin. He tore quickly, trying to work out his pain. The blood had soaked through his clothes, was dripping on the floor, and he somehow got it in his hair. (He actually pushed it back with his bloody hand.) No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get his Dark Mark to disfigure. No matter how many times he cut, he just
"You're not fucking welcome to sit next to me." Draco was quite surprised, honestly, the shock of Hermione talking to him still not having wore off. (That might have something to do with the fact that he was wasted.) He was even more shocked by her use of swear words. She
"We should go... the train is leaving soon." I jutted out my lower lip and pouted shamelessly, and Harry smirked. He detached himself from me, and I crossed my arms. His smirk widened, and he leaned in and gave me what was meant to be a short kiss. My hands immediately went to his hair, rooting him to the spot. I pushed my tongue into his mouth, and pulled his body onto mine. Harry lost himself in the kiss, but eventually had the sense to pull away. "Come on, Draco. We have to go. You'll miss the train."
“Okay, Harry. I thought that we’d start with some simple spells at first, and then slowly work on harder ones. I have a list of spells we worked on in our first year, and I’d thought we’d start there, if that’s okay with you?”
"You're- you're not yelling. Was it, 'Okay, it's fine and I'm supportive of you', or was it, 'Okay, I'm leaving this room as soon as I regain full use of my limbs and don't ever talk to me again'?
Snape went to the front of the room, turned around, and then his eyes scanned us. He went from left to right, and his eyes stopped when he saw Ron.
that Dray was in his right mind when he got off the train. I knew that spending time with his father was always a bit rough, but to ditch his friends when he needs us most? And to
No name. Figures. Blaise isn't one for details. When I open it, it's a small model of a Firebolt, and it's pretty cool, actually. It reminds me of Harry's amazing broom.
Draco nodded slowly, and then replied, "If you don't want to be here... go. But, if you want to know, I didn't have a choice. So... yeah."
It's satisfying, cutting. I watch the blood drip down my arm and onto the black sheets. No one will notice the stain. I feel the pain, and I enjoy, almost. I feel like I got what I deserve. I do it again. And again. And again, again, again, again.
Harry was actually interested this time. He’d always liked to date people with lots of personality, (Hence dating Ginny and Cho before he presented) and this sounded like they had exactly that. Angelina had said to come right away… He really should get going.
I had a black bra on. It was plain and simple, but it gave you a good sense of what I looked like underneath it. That’s why I like it. I was wearing a black, see-through, long-sleeve, mesh top, and a orangish-pink skirt that stopped mid-thigh. My black combat boots were well loved, but they looked brand new. (I cast spells on them after every wear.)
Draco started talking quickly. "-I didn't have a choice Pansy! I was forced. He was at my house and so were a ton of other Death Eaters and would have died if I hadn't done this but I should have died instead of this- and, wait. Pansy? What did you say?"
She rolls her eyes again. I think she should trade mark that, due to the fact that she does it so often.
We met up with Pansy and Blaise on our way out of the Great Hall, and they both looked the same as Ron. Speaking of Ron, he had yet to talk this morning, and was moaning miserably every few seconds.
He turned on his heel, dragging Harry along with him, pulling the raging boy away from the haze of his angry, furious, violet thoughts, as well as away from the blonde bitch.
FOR ALL PURPOSES DRACO IS STILL ON THE QUIDDITCH TEAM. ALSO, DRACO WAS NEVER ASSIGNED THE TASK OF KILLING DUMBLEDORE. OKAY? Okay.
Her dark hair was curled, hanging around her face, and her dark blue robes looked lovely on her. Her face- her face... was pale. Not the normal, beautiful face that I love, but a pale, shallow face with heavy bags under her eyes. This was very, very, concerning. My Mother always took pride in her appearance, and never went anywhere without looking perfect. So this was a sign in itself.
Angelina stopped at a door, and then said, “Well, I’m going to blindfold you, because I’ve noticed that Alphas tend to judge more by appearance than scent.” Harry said, “Yeah, okay.” Angelina flicked her wand, and he suddenly couldn’t see anymore. He heard a door click open, (Harry’s hearing was enhanced when he became an Alpha) and then Angelina (He assumed) grabbed his hand and led him through the doorway. He hit his hand on the side of the doorframe, and Angelina said, “Sorry!” and then cast a pain-relieving spell. (Which was expected, she was a Healer and all) Harry said, “S’okay,” then walked through the door. He sucked in a sharp breath, overwhelmed by the
must not die. I won't allow it. My mother's expression is so full of pain. I want to free her of that.
Oh, fuck. Stop it, Draco. You really should stop thinking about all of those great times with Harry. If I kept this up, I would be lost in memories all of the time. And that can't happen.
“So, how is it?” Angelina asked, and Harry realized that he had completely forgotten that she was there. He had forgotten everything other than the
A small part of my brain looked at what she was wearing. Her combat boots, hoop earrings, a jean skirt, and her sweater made her look spectacular.
The Slytherin Beaters seemed to have noticed him diving, and one of them sent a Bludger at him with astounding force. Thankfully, Jimmy happened to notice, and knocked it right out of the way, straight at a Slytherin Chaser. Harry sped forward, closer, closer,
“Good, Harry! How long have you been able to do this? Imagine the possibilities if you could cast non-verbal spells
I was snapped out of it by Harry grabbing my leg and slinging in over his hip. It took all of my self-control to not start humping him.
I'm laying in my gigantic bed, in my cold, empty, room, that is dark and dank and damp and most of all cold.
Blaise laughed. "Okay, I suppose that those are all valid points... and seriously, where else are we going to get more Weasley sweaters?"
Anyway, please keep reading? It’s gonna get better, and the last few chapters have been quite boring to write. So, please? I appreciate all u guys being like ‘WHERE THE FUCK IS DRACO’ and I’m like ‘DAMN GUYS YOU’RE RIGHT THIS STORY HAS BEEN SHIT... SO I’M GONNA FIX IT!’
I don’t have much more time to consult with the voice in my head that sounds strangely like Hermione, as I make it into the bathroom.
do a good job. Everything is mostly back to how it was pre-war. Except for the fact that Second genders were back. Those had been gone for at least a century, and when the first teenager presented, they started sending out warnings for people who were twenty-six and under, because twenty-six is the latest someone has ever presented. Unspeakables are still trying to figure out why, but Hermione thinks that it has something to do with the major drop in population, and ancient magic kicked in and is trying to get us to start making more children. (If that’s the case, then it’s
every once in a while? I was waiting for you to notice the fact that I've been off my game, and you didn't!"
Ron had his face on the table and wasn’t touching his food,  and Hermione wasn’t reading. Which says a lot.
Ron and I pulled Harry out of the Hall quickly, dragging him through the halls and up and down staircases. Ron was supporting almost all of Harry's weight. He was pale, and his face was contorted into one of his famous expressions.
I snap back out of it, and I wonder what the fuck could have made Dray change his mind. I give the password quickly, and then storm through the common room. A few first years jump out of my way.
We all sat in silence, which was quite unusual. I munched on some bacon, trying to will my headache away.
No, I’m sure they’re fine. They’ll be fine. Granger has to be there for Pansy, if I die. Which I’m going to. Nothing can save me now. I’m bleeding onto the floor.
none of your damn business. But I guess I'm going to tell you any way. One of them, not sure who, made a bet with me that Harry Potter could cast a Patronus Charm while he was drunk. And, mind you, Harry's so drunk right now that it's not even possible that he's coherent. So I we made a deal. All of their drinks'll be on the house if he can produce a one, and if he doesn't the kid'll pay me 50 Galleons. So, he goes over to Harry and whispers something, and Harry nods, pulls out his wand, and then casts the strongest Patronus Charm I've ever saw. I fell over from the power of it. So, long story short, I'm going to be completely broke by the end of the day."
I practically apparate over there, and I pull him into my lap, holding up his head and his shoulders.
Harry shook his head, trying to clear it. The lift doors opened, presenting the white hallway. Harry walked straight forward, then turned to the right, and then to the left, and then he was at Angelina's office. He knocked, and was immediately answered by, "Come in!" Harry opened the door, and walked into Ang's small office. It was basically all white, with various scrolls scattered about the room, and it had a desk, where Angelina was sat. "Hello, Harry," she said, smoothing her light green Healer's robes. Her dark hair was pulled back into a neat bun, and she looked very professional, from her shiny dragon-hide flats to her perfect makeup. She looked exactly how a Healer should. Neat and precise.
in a way that it never had been with Ginny.  Harry felt a sense of intense relief, that he had figured this out, even though it had taken a while. For the first time, he considered that maybe getting divorced had been the right thing to do. That maybe his children would be better off seeing him and Ginny happy, even though that meant Ginny and Harry couldn’t be together anymore.
be there after Saturday night. It’s not going anywhere. It makes me feel like she doesn’t give a shit, you know?”
At eight-fifteen, Draco found a reference to a book in the footnotes of the text he was looking through. “I’m going to run to the library,” he said to Hermione, who jumped a little at the sound of his voice (she tended to do that, as she got so immersed in study that she seemed to forget about the outside world). “I’ll be right back.”
She looked up at him in shock. “I – I was. I’m not anymore.” She bit down on her lips again. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.
Yet his handsome face, his sweeping cheekbones and high, proud forehead, his soft, full mouth – those were all devastatingly familiar. As far as what was going on inside that pretty head of his, she couldn’t even begin to guess. “What are you doing here? It’s one o’clock in the morning.”
. His skin was tingling and he was reeling in sensation of the mouth pressed against his own, the hands that snaked up into his hair, the breath against his lips. “
“Good,” Pansy said, her hand moving lower. Sarah sucked in a breath and scooted closer as Pansy slid a finger inside of her. She fingered her for a moment until she was nice and wet, and then drew it up and out, circling Sarah’s nub, thrilling in the little gasps coming from her.
of Hermione – what made her who she was -- was identical. In every iteration, she was steadfast and true, forgiving and kind, gentle, and endlessly wise. As he looked at her, he saw them all, together: the Hermione of the first timeline, crying over leaving Pansy and Harry and Draco at Christmas break, and then, years later, sitting with Draco at the lake as he confided in her about the Time-Turner; the Hermione of the second timeline, who’d turned to Draco for help with Alchemy and encouraged him to get along with Ron; and, finally, the Hermione of his own timeline, who had put her feet up on his ottoman and doled out dating advice, and laughed at Draco and Ginny’s antics until she was red in the face.
Draco could’ve come just from the voice he used, so authoritative and sure. Feeling like a wanton slag and loving every second of it, Draco bent all the way over the desk, his arse in the air, and spread his legs. He heard Potter’s breath hitch, and his cock jumped a bit against the desk.
After the war, everyone had decided they’d had enough of Lucius Malfoy’s shite, regardless of how much money he had, and he’d been effectively sidelined. He’d burnt down the west wing of the Manor in a fit of rage after he lost a race for the Assembly seat that Draco now occupied. And when Draco wrested the seat away from the witch who’d beaten Lucius, Lucius had been ridiculously proud over it, as though it had been his own victory. Perhaps he'd thought it was.
“Oh, sweetheart!’ cried his mother, rushing over to him and wrapping him up in her arms. “Oh no! When?”
You realize, then, that you didn’t really have a question, that you’re just talking and talking without thinking, like usual. But maybe you can make one up.
“Okay,” Harry said, not liking this one bit. He thought back to when Pansy said she found Ron fit, and decided he would definitely not be sharing that tidbit with Ron.
When they finally settled into bed and Harry pushed into Draco, they weren’t talking dirty or using restraints or banishing clothes. It was just the two of them, just warm skin touching warm skin, just green eyes meeting gray, just hands and bodies joined together. And it was a thousand times more thrilling than anything they’d shared before.
“The wireless in the bedroom – the one we bought together? D’you mind if I take it? You can keep the one in the kitchen.”
Draco continued to tease his way along Harry’s cock, and Harry began sighing and shivering. Draco took the opportunity to kiss along his jaw, then lower, to his chest, pausing at a pink nipple to lick across its surface. Harry groaned roughly, gripping Draco hard.
They wound their way through a maze of rooms, finally slowing when they reached an impossibly long dining room table with chairs upholstered in sage and cream stripes. Three places were set, and the spread on the table was mad, given that there were, in fact, only three of them. From Harry’s cursory glance, he noted that there were scones and teacakes, macarons and luscious-looking berry parfaits, and dainty little cucumber and smoked salmon sandwiches cut into circles and stars. There were one-bite quiches and miniature chicken salad croissant sandwiches. There was also an entire tiered serving platter containing a million types of biscuits. Harry’s mouth was watering.
Harry laughed, and just then the door to the hallway opened. “Oh, hello!” said the woman who came in.
Harry began thrusting his hips. Draco could tell he was trying not to, but he was half-gone, lost to his pleasure, his eyes slitted open, his mouth parted, his hands scratching trails along Draco’s scalp and shoulders. Draco encouraged him, using one hand to cup Harry’s arse, pulling it towards him before letting it sink back down onto the bed.
Potter’s mouth was back on his skin, his other hand gentle as it slipped up Draco’s shirt along his spine. Draco closed his eyes and fucked back into Potter’s fingers. He hoisted up his shirt in the back, giving Potter a better view of his arse, letting him take a good look at his fingers fucking into it. “Oh, fuck,” Potter groaned.
“What I personally knew about courting...could comfortably fit into a thimble without taking it off your finger first.”
“He is,” Draco agreed, hating the catch in his voice. “Unfortunately, he’s not interested. Because he’s still really hung up on you.”
When Draco came tiptoeing into his room clutching a pillow later that night, Harry felt an enormous sense of relief. He kept himself, somehow, from jumping on top of Draco and snogging him silly, and instead, asked him if he wanted to be the little spoon or the big spoon that evening.
Laurel frowned and looked over at Harry. “Your friend is a Senweir, too? He doesn’t look to be of the blood.”
, but what, Draco could only guess. “I like him, too. And I agree, he seems like he could help us. And he’s not into the whole slave thing, which is nice.”
He grabbed his wand, which was on the coffee table, just in case it was some crazy person at the door instead of Hermione. The post-war hecklers had mostly gone away, but still, every once in a while someone would show up wanting to give Draco a piece of their mind and maybe a swift kick to the bollocks. Halfway to the door, he realized that he was still in his suit trousers and button-down, except that now they were a wrinkled mess. He hit them with a quick smoothing charm and opened the door.
He made his way up to the library on the third floor. The Malfoy library was massive, full of centuries-old texts and borderline-dark material. All the legitimately dark stuff had been seized in the aftermath of the war, but the Aurors left plenty that probably shouldn’t have been left. Draco enjoyed looking through some of the mysterious tomes in here when he had time, just to sate his curiosity.
They made camp that evening in a copse of normal-sized trees. In fact, all the trees Harry and Draco had seen since leaving Evenwood Forest had been rather unimpressive. Edwin and some of the other men went out hunting and brought back what looked like groundhogs to roast over the fire. They looked disgusting, and Draco wasn’t hungry enough to ignore that fact.
“I just wish you had told me, so I knew," said Charlie. "I would’ve steered clear of him if I knew you had feelings for him. And I probably wouldn’t have shagged you.”
“And three,” Scorpius continued, “the Potters are our neighbors. Well, close enough. And Lily and Albus Potter are my friends.” He finished his explanation of this third new thing by pointing up the stairs to where Harry and Lily and Al and Pansy were standing.  Harry felt his cheeks heat up as Al and Lily waved cheerfully.
Tony was freaking out, now that whatever potion he’d been given was wearing off and he was beginning to realize what he’d done. He was pacing and cursing and seemed precariously close to tears in several instances, which Pansy simply could not bear. Tony Goldstein was not a crier. If he cried, all was lost.
When they were done, Blaise rolled over and they looked at each other and laughed, and then Blaise kissed him and spelled them clean. Draco spelled his own curtains closed, then closed Blaise’s, and then passed the fuck out and slept until 4 a.m. when Blaise’s alarm went off.
The half-hour flew by, and they spent the next half hour back in the club proper, watching other dancers who were nowhere near as talented as Draco. After a few minutes of this, Harry felt eyes on him. He turned around and saw a guy that looked vaguely familiar, staring. Harry offered a little wave and the guy grinned and made his way over. He spoke, leaning into Harry to be heard. “You were at Draco’s the other night, weren’t you?” He had a fine Irish brogue and smiled in a friendly way.
Draco found that he couldn’t look at Potter, so he looked at his hands again. “Mm,” he said eloquently.
Well, that was odd. Harry thought, suddenly, of the watch. Had Robards found out about that? But it had been more than a month since then. Why would he have found out about it now?
Harry let his hand drift down over Draco’s smooth arse, reveling in the feel of it. Draco really did have the most perfect arse, perfectly smooth and pale, his hole a rosy pink. Harry let a finger slide against it now, and Draco moaned. “Maybe you want me to touch you here?” Harry asked.
She nodded a little. “I can believe that.” She began to fiddle with a stone for a moment, and then picked it up and threw it into the lake. The sun was going down fast, the lake lighting up pink. “Dragon, you only like men, yes?”
“I’m bisexual,” Harry said. It felt easier each time he said it, and the word was starting to feel like it belonged to him, somehow.
“Well, you are far from Septerra, I suppose. She’s managed to create an army of the things to protect the capital city. If you go close enough, you will hear the people speak of them. William knows about them, no doubt. But he keeps news of her victories quiet from his men, in case you haven’t noticed.”
“Harry!” called Euri from downstairs. Harry was upstairs, his clothes strewn all over his room, searching for some acceptable outfit that probably didn’t exist.
He startled and turned around, accidentally dropping an egg onto the floor where it cracked open. “Oh, shit, sorry,” he said, looking down at it. “I’ll get that.” He wandlessly vanished the mess and then looked over at Draco, a bit shyly now. “Good morning. I hope you don’t mind that I’ve invaded your kitchen again.”
Reluctantly, Harry rose and collected his clothes, pulling them on. His body was so relaxed that he really had to force himself to move at all. There was also an unfamiliar soreness that was making him hold himself more carefully than usual, and it didn’t help matters any that Malfoy was watching him shamelessly, his gray eyes flickering over Harry’s body. “Stop,” Harry said, laughing and feeling his cheeks heat.
Euri’s mouth quirked up in a ghost of a smile, only one dimple appearing. “No, it’s alright. That’s nice of you, to have even considered it. I don’t blame you for being angry at me, honestly. I was rather angry at myself. It was all sort of my fault, wasn’t it?”
“Don’t talk about it like that!” Nott cried. “That’s not what it was! It wasn’t like that at all!” The wand was back at his throat.
Lia laughed, sounding overwhelmed. “I suppose I would, if you manage that.” She shook her head. “Goddess, this sounds like complete nonsense. You realize that, don’t you?”
“I did,” said Malfoy, smirking. Harry liked how Malfoy’s mouth looked when he was smirking, which was often.
He bolted up suddenly, feeling like he might erupt. “Loo,” he said, and hurried to the back of the pub. Was Ron fucking with him? Doing this just because he knew Harry would let him and wouldn’t push him away or say anything about it? Or was Ron not aware that he was doing it at all?
Potter suddenly let out a little chuckle and shook his head, breaking the spell, and moved towards the kitchen. Draco tried to collect himself for a moment, feeling a bit shell-shocked, and then followed, and saw that one of Bibby’s Cornish hen dinners was spread out on the counter, piping hot. They took plates to the dining room and chatted about nothing of import, though Potter kept looking at him oddly. “What?” Draco finally asked.
“Imagine you’re a fish, swimming in a pond. You can move forward and back, side to side, but never up out of the water...To you, that little pond is an entire universe. Now imagine that someone reaches down and lifts you out of the pond. You see that what you thought was the entire world is only a small pool. You see other ponds. Trees. The sky above. You realize you’re a part of a much larger and more mysterious reality than you had ever dreamed of.”
Potter kissed a trail along it, and then covered Draco’s mouth with his own, possessing it entirely, leaving no room for breath or thought. It was a messy kiss, full of clacking teeth and the burn of stubble against stubble, open-mouthed and hot. It made Draco so dizzy he thought he might fall if Potter wasn’t anchoring him in place.
She made a muscle. He whistled. “Woo, Merlin. I’m going to have to watch out for you. Pretty soon you’ll be able to bench press me.”
Harry. He’d gotten so used to him in the other timeline, so used to constantly touching him and being with him, that it seemed strange to hold himself at a distance.
Harry snickered and, without quite meaning to, tightened his grip on Malfoy’s waist. Draco stepped a little closer and put his head next to Harry’s. He was singing again, low and soft, near Harry’s ear. Harry leaned in closer, and suddenly they were chest to chest and barely moving and Harry could feel the warmth of Draco’s body through their clothes. It felt warm and firm and perfect. “You’ve gone and mucked it up, Harry,” said Draco, pulling back slightly. “You big galoot, I almost tripped over your feet –”
, it was making Harry so hard just listening to them. Just watching Malfoy’s face as he jerked himself. He was so bloody gorgeous. Always, but like this…oh god. It was almost too much.
“Potter,” Draco murmured darkly, ready to give him a two-fingered salute. It was how they said hello to one another. It was mostly friendly between them these days, but their friendliness had a decidedly antagonistic tinge to it.
Harry nodded and released him. “Oh. Well. That’s – that’s good,” he said, leaving Draco feeling hollow and aching.
Harry thought of how they’d threatened to give Malfoy a hard time. “Is that a good idea?” Harry asked.
Draco opened his eyes – he had eyes again – and found himself staring down the bustling row of shops on Diagon Alley.
Monday mornings were never dull. Every arsehole with a wand decided to lose their fucking minds over the weekend, and got up to the most awful shit imaginable. Monday morning always brought with it a couple of domestics that needed to be looked into, some burglaries, some duels, a few possible curses. But the Monday after Harry went to Malfoy’s was a particularly hectic one. Before they could even sit down and have a morning cup of tea, Harry and Lavender were being called into Robards' office. A surge of dark magic had been traced to somehwere near Leeds, to a spot that happened to be right where Marcus Flint lived. Flint was one of those whose families had not been heavily involved with Death Eaters, but had undoubtedly been assisting at the periphery. So Flint was on their watch list.
He unbuckled his belt and slid his hand into his trousers, palming his hard cock, and rested his head against the back of the chair, his eyes still on picture-Draco. He inhaled the scent of Draco’s cologne, mixed with ink and parchment, a very Draco-ish smell altogether, and began to stroke up and down. He watched picture-Draco’s mouth move as he uttered the words of the oath, and imagined those gray eyes getting hot, imagined that he was speaking to Harry. He’d tell Harry he loved him and then drop to his knees right here in the office, and take Harry’s cock into his soft, hot mouth, those perfectly asymmetrical lips dragging up and down his shaft, those serious gray eyes locked on his.
Yeah, it’s probably nothing. No one’s probably watching him. Why would they? The other students should be busy with their works and not be distracted. Unless… Unless Potter is staring at him. Maybe Potter was thinking of his actions yesterday, how he’d teased Draco and make him feel flustered. How he’d licked the delicate skin on his neck up all the way to his ear–
For a moment, Malfoy was silent. He then rolled his eyes and huffed. Looking back at Harry, he said, "You and your heroic self. I can just see it in the headline of the Daily Prophet.
Draco realized they were still holding hands so he quickly pulled his hand away, almost tugging Harry off balance.
Malfoy had returned to retake his 7th year just like the many of them. Although he wasn't really that Malfoy-prat everyone knew anymore. He was mostly silent in classes, trying to finish whatever task the professor ordered them to do. He kept a low profile to everyone and didn't dare to meet other students' gazes, even his Slytherin friends.
Harry’s eyes widened as he reached to a realization. His hands started to tremble aggressively that he had to put the map down to prevent himself from tearing it. Harry looked over at Ron, sleeping peacefully, and his roommates, probably dreaming about not-so-good memories but at least they were
Harry stopped trying to reach out. Maybe he was pushing too much. Maybe he should just leave and let Draco be.
Draco forced himself to believe even though his mind is not with it. He doesn’t know why he is receiving this kind of treatment if he didn’t deserve it. A pathetic death eater like him should rot in Azkaban as the other students kept on saying. He didn’t expect to receive this kind of attention; and he never expected for it to come from Harry, the boy who received nothing from him but mocks and insults. He also didn’t expect it when he felt lips on his own.
The three of them, Hermione not included, pressed their ears on the closed door silently. They were a bit annoyed at how the pair seemed to quiet down this time.
“If you really want to…” Harry was lost. He didn’t want to leave Draco like that. He wanted to take him and place him into his care but he didn’t force on it any longer. “I’ll go…”
Slowly, he released Draco and took a step back. Draco had to mask his expression due to the feeling of fear when those strong and protective arms are now gone. He looked up at Harry. “Same time tomorrow?”
Harry stopped on his tracks when he's finally out of sight. He lets out a breath he didn't remember holding. Why did it feel like they lost even though Voldemort is long gone?
“What’s wrong, Draco?” Pansy asked him, staring at his paper. Her eyebrows furrowed in bewilderment. “It’s been half an hour. Why are you still on your first draft? You usually finish before everyone else. Has something been bothering you?”
A door opened then closed again, indicating that someone had went out. Footsteps resonated within the hallway. “Fancy being a regular in detention?” Draco said right when Harry was about to round the corner.
Hermione’s eyes widened by just hearing the first words that was followed by a moan and a beastly growl. “That’s horrible!” She gasped.
Ron looked sideways at his brothers who gave him matching sly smiles. They were here because the professor allowed them to stay, knowing they will be using the classroom next.
Harry pulled back but his lips remained pressed to Draco’s and he said, “Thank you,” He kissed him. “For not being able to do it.” He kissed him again. “Thank you for not leaving.” And again. “Thank you for staying with me.” And again.
I didn't really plan on this to be continuous and related with the other chapters but... blame my fingers and my mind again! XD
Harry’s eyes opened wide when he realized something. His thoughts suddenly flashed back to Malfoy seated at the very corner of the room during classes with no one daring to come near him, when he had to shut everyone off even though the whispers were very deafening, when he tried to talk to one of the Slytherins in their first day to ask something but got yells and insults thrown at him instead of answers…. Then finally, Harry’s thoughts went back once more to the blood slowly dropping down from an injured arm and at the site of Malfoy’s face in despair as he said,
Draco is indeed right when he felt someone watching him. Just across the table, a bit further from the Slytherin table, Harry was intently looking at him. His quill on his hand and, probably, forgotten.
Harry quickly looked at Draco upon hearing his words. Draco had never actually spoke to him first and willingly like this. “Here?”
Draco suddenly screeched as he flailed his feet but threw his arms around Harry’s neck as he held onto him desperately. New trails of tears doused his cheeks, as he pushed himself further into Harry, wanting to be closer to him.
Malfoy, with his usual haughty demeanor, pushed on. He started to walk toward Harry menacingly. “Better go back to that filthy mudblood and pathetic Weasel who continue to be a disgrace to the wizarding world. I’d say hurry up and prevent them from doing stupid things again but then I realized–“
Harry did speak this time, “Oh, I don’t know. I probably liked it when you started waiting for me after detention.”
Harry and Ron both looked at their professor, their mouths open wide. “But professor–“ It was only Harry who Snape interrupted.
“How dare you let her touch you?? With those filthy Ravenclaw hands!” Draco had Harry on the wall this time as he ferally kissed him. The snake finally coming out to feed on his prey.
Draco finally leapt into action and pulled Harry’s hand away from Cho by claiming a possessive hand on Harry’s wrist. Cho was startled at the reaction and flinched back.
Harry pulled Draco closer with their joined hands and kissed him on the lips again. When Draco gasped in astonishment, Harry’s tongue gently pushed in.
Most students enjoyed the celebration but Harry definitely didn't. Especially when his friends are not even here celebrating. Hermione was beside him though, trying to get his attention that she finally got when she lightly shook him by the shoulder. "Harry."
Who would have thought? That the arrogant, conceited, and cruel school bully was actually a spineless, craven, and pathetic coward? Who couldn’t even take his own wand and fight back? Who’s just willingly resigned to his fate to whatever might happen to him without even standing his ground?
Harry didn’t want to see Draco suffer any longer. He tried to move toward him, to touch him, to hold him, to protect him but Draco backed out when he saw him coming.
Ron didn’t realize he had been meandering all this time. He didn’t know where his feet took him but then he suddenly heard voices from afar. He slowed down his pace and approached the door from where he heard the voices.
The next day, Harry stayed at the Great Hall to eat lunch. Draco was on the other table just right behind him. Harry didn’t see him going to their usual place so he just decided to eat with his friends. They didn’t even meet last night and that made the brunette really sad and worried.
Draco’s eyes widened and he felt his heart miss a beat. He willed himself to stay inside the strong and protective embrace for a moment. He let himself feel and experience this proximity with Harry for a longer moment before finally speaking up, “I’m tired. Can I go back to my room?”
Ron and Ginny settled down on the couches near them. “Mum’s invited us over during the break next week. Will you join us, Harry?” It was Ginny who spoke.
Ron hesitantly turned to look at his brothers before handling them his compensation for losing the bet.
Draco saw shock, guilt, and sadness on Harry’s eyes when it opened. They had parted abruptly from the kiss but Harry’s arms remained around his waist, although a bit slack now compared to before.
“Really? Harry did that? And Malfoy too?” It was Neville, who looked flabbergasted upon hearing the news.
Harry just smiled sheepishly and looked away. “You know… there’s this girl who keeps looking at me.”
Chang, then go to her. I don’t need to waste my time with the likes of you!” He turned around to leave but Harry caught his wrist and pulled him back down.
I didn't mean for this chapter to be this long... I was actually worried it might only be 500 words or something... sometimes my hands just can't stop writing and adding things that aren't originally in the plan. XD
“But that’s not–“ Ron tried to look at Harry but he realized he wasn’t with them today. “If Harry was here, he’d disagree!”
Harry sat beside him with cross legs. The last three days seemed to have consumed every topic he could bring out so he eagerly scrambled his head to think of a new one.
Both Harry and Ginny laughed with Hermione but Ron, upon seeing his girlfriend look so happy, so lovely, and so delicate like this made his heart flutter. Instead of a laugh, he let out an awkward smile.
"That doesn't mean anything anymore, Malfoy. I'm just... Worried. You have to stop doing that." Harry looked at him in the eye with a little scowl.
Draco growled and covered his eyes with his hands. He really needs to stay focused before their professor catches him and take him to detention due to negligence.
Draco’s glare at his rival didn’t falter. He remained resilient even as Harry leaned his head forward and pressed their foreheads together, their noses touching.
It took a few minutes for both boys to recover from the recent incident. When Harry suddenly laughed, Draco roughly pushed him away.
Harry sighed and frowned at Ron for a moment, not understanding why his friend was acting that way. He tried to write on his paper but his thoughts are empty right now… Except for one thing. He looked back at Malfoy, who seemed distressed. He found it funny how usually, it was Malfoy and Hermione who finished first and leave the classroom, but Hermione was the only one who finished early this time and she had left long ago.
Draco felt warm being embraced like this. He didn’t want this to end. He didn’t want to go back to the terrifying world always waiting to torment him and leave him dead. That’s why he almost whimpered when Harry moved, afraid he might go away, but he found himself being pushed against the wall.
, aggravating him every time they meet and never leaving him alone. It was only a matter of time until the golden boy snapped. When he did, Draco would humiliate him, that their golden boy wasn’t who they think they were.
On second thought, it was also Ron’s fault for agreeing to the bet(s). If only he could take back the bets he had made then he wouldn’t have to suffer… Well, there were only two bets left and who knows, Merlin might give finally let him win.
Ron glanced sideways without turning his face. He was curious as to how a certain blonde Slytherin would react. Hermione, across the table and beside the place Cho sat on, was busy doing something and was completely oblivious to the whole world.
“You always go back here at around 2 in the morning. Tell me, does the headmaster need something from you again?” Ron leaned in and intently looked at Harry.
Harry decided to just take a small peek and try to know what's going on. For all he knows, maybe Malfoy really just wanted to piss here peacefully.
“He most certainly will, Ginny. He has to. He’s bound to the Weasleys for the rest of his life just like I am.” Hermione declared then let out a small laugh.
It was lunch time and they decided to meet under a tree where no other students usually pass by. After finishing his lunch, Draco unconsciously immersed himself with his own thoughts.
“My mother and I made this. I hope you’ll like it.” Cho’s smile never disappeared as she handed over a small box wrapped in a red ribbon.
Ron grimaced and looked defeated. He looked back at his brothers as he pouted, wanting to withdraw from the bet. But because he knows he won’t be getting out of his situation no matter what he does, he quickly calculated the galleons that he had just lost again.
All his despair was forgotten when he felt the wall change. He looked at the wall as it made crushing-like sounds. Lines and carves suddenly appeared and the once light wall turned into a dark door.
Also, I needed a reason for Draco to be jealous so I used Cho. I hope you don't get mad at me for using her :'( In all honestly, I love Cho too! But drarry is lifeeee.
Harry cleared his throat silently. “Stop doing that. I’m… worried.” He doesn’t really know why he keeps telling the other that he was worried. He doesn’t even have any idea why he was doing this and that made it harder for him to express himself in words.
Pansy, who looked absolutely hysteric, turned around to where Draco was already heading. “Th-the glass! Your hand!!”
Having deafened by the chatters and not being able to concentrate on his thoughts, Harry stood up and left the dining hall. The headmaster eyed him with worry but said nothing.
Unknown to Harry, Ron had turned his head to look at Draco and saw that he had cracked a glass with his hand. Ron cringed at the trail of blood from the Slytherin’s hand that was slowly pouring down.
Malfoy tried so hard to bring his nails to the mark again but failed to do so with Harry's strong grip. "He... He... I… I can't let him out of my head..." He whimpered and drew in a shaky breath.
On the other hand, Harry was internally enjoying at how flustered and disoriented his captee looked like with their current situation. As he has a firm grip on the blond’s head, he decided to reach for his ear to tickle and caress it to distract his attention elsewhere. To Harry’s disappointment, Malfoy decided to keep his gaze glued at Harry’s lips. The little blush that manifested on Malfoy’s face felt satisfying though so he decided to stop teasing and start doing.
For a moment, Malfoy felt safe, contented, and loved. But those feelings were all gone when he mustered up enough force to shove the Gryffindor off of him. “Get off of me, Potter!” He screamed and tried to sound angry but his voice sounded rasp and desperate for more attention.
Draco looked at the other brunette for a second before pulling Harry and dragging him away. Harry let out a few unintelligible expressions before stumbling and hurrying to catch up with the enraged blonde who was dragging him out of the Great Hall mercilessly.
Fred and George, who happened to be beside them, looked at the scene occurring before them. Both unable to blink at the intensity of the scenario.
Hermione looked at Draco for a moment until he passed by and was already out of sight. “Harry???” She called out again but received no response. She was wrong then. Harry wasn’t here. She just sighed and decided to leave and go back at the Great Hall.
Harry smiled managing to find back his confidence as he closed his eyes and pressed his forehead against Draco’s. “Well, you caught me. I love you then.”
Ron slowly shook his head in absolute condemnation when he realized through Draco’s reactions what Harry was doing. The Slytherin’s eyes were closed tightly and he was wincing every time Harry sucked on the same spot on his neck over and over again.
Draco’s scowl at him was venomous, like a snake ready to bite and leave his prey dead. His face was twitching in ire, and his hands closing and opening, unsure of what to do to the man before him. His mind racing and thinking where he’d leave Harry’s body after he’s done with him. Oh, he’d probably search for the girl too.
It was these moments that made him live on with a smile without fully succumbing to the sufferings that tortured him in his head. He had friends from the start, friends who are willing to be there for him anytime he needed them. In return, he’ll be there for them if they needed him. These moments were probably their only weapon to defeating the demons tainting their supposed-to-be-peaceful thoughts, whispering to their ears relentlessly
Draco’s gray orbs widened and the blush on his face returned. He forced himself to stare at Harry and dared not to look at his professor’s bewildered look.
Draco clenched his hand into a fist as, once again, he had to get his mind back to the current task on hand. Their professor had asked them to make an essay regarding the different types of potions they have learned so far. He was still on his first draft, with more scribbles than actual thoughts. He wasn’t even done yet with the first paragraph.
Fuck off, Potter.” He made his way to leave and just as he was about to go past Harry, his arm, where his mark wasn’t, was suddenly pulled back abruptly and he was facing Harry again. “What now, Potter?!” He snarled but he found himself wincing when Harry tightened his hand on his arm. There weren’t any injuries there, really, his skin was just skinny that he was afraid Harry might crush his bones.
I think it's the third time I'll say this but in case it's not clear, Ron bet that none of them (Harry and Draco) would have the guts to flirt out into the open but the twins bet that at least one of them has the guts to do it.
that he felt something for him, but also knew that it was likely the thrill of his own discovery, the dizzying speed at which they’d formed this friendship, and again, the fact that Draco was literally the only queer boy around, at least as far as Potter knew. It made sense that this combination would be enough to convince someone they had feelings that they didn’t truly have.
“Didn’t see the rash before…this might be an allergic reaction of some sort. Do me a favor and go into the bathroom and get the med kit,” said Charlie.
It was strangely quiet inside the gate, with only a few soldiers milling about near the stables and barracks. “Where is everyone?” Draco asked William.
“Come on,” said Harry, nodding towards a doorway in the rear of the room. They walked up a spiral staircase and into a dorm room that looked much like its Slytherin counterpart, except without the armchairs by the stove or the sink in the corner. Draco tried not to be pleased by the knowledge that his room was just a tiny bit better, but he was. Old habits die hard.
“Meh,” said Harry. “Pretty sure they liked it.” He pulled Draco’s mouth back to his, and Draco, much to Harry’s surprise, didn’t protest.
“Excellent,” Berold said, looking pleased. “This is the right spot.” Everyone else looked duly impressed, and Draco couldn’t help but feel a little proud of himself.
Draco and Blaise spent the day pretending to study and acting like the last twenty-four hours hadn’t ever happened, but then about a half hour ago, Blaise began hinting that they needed to talk. This was not their typical method of handling problems; usually, Blaise and Draco tip-toed around one another until things normalized. Talking with Blaise – seriously talking – seemed unnatural.
The door swung open right then, and it was the waitress returning with two mugs full of mulled wine. They smelled like oranges and cloves, and the steam felt good on Draco’s face. It was rather chilly now that the sun was down.
“I’m guessing he doesn’t know what to do with this. I mean, he’s wanted to screw around with you for a while, in my opinion. And now he has, and so he’s probably asking himself what happens now. Dating someone is very different than…well, you know. And you two have all that messy business with Ginevra and Hermione. It’s a lot.”
Draco shoved him again. “Well, don’t. I’m getting stupider just listening to you talk about it. I can feel the brain cells leaking out of my ears.”
“Yes, it's excellent news,” said William. “Though rather sad for those of us who have grown used to your company.”
It was common knowledge that Harry had died in the Forbidden Forest. He told the truth to anyone who asked, and eventually, word of it got around. Harry’d even confirmed it when the witch who was writing his authorized biography (as opposed to the dozen or so unauthorized versions, which were all complete dreck) questioned him about it. It wasn’t something he loved to discuss, but he’d been honest, about the over-saturated version of King's Cross, his talk with Dumbledore, and choosing to go back.
By four, Harry was starting to get tired, but the party showed no signs of slowing. Malfoy dragged Harry and Ron up to a rooftop patio surrounded by hedges. There were little lights strung up between the greenery, adding to the bright lights of the city all around them. Malfoy’d brought out cigars, which Harry never smoked but figured why not, and they were all smoking and talking about nothing of import. Harry felt dozy and strangely relaxed. “I think I’ve got to go, Harry,” said Ron at some point. “I can hardly keep my eyes open. Can I apparate from here, Malfoy?”
“No. No bad memories here,” Draco agreed. “Would you want to live somewhere like this, though? You seem to like things a bit simpler.”
Broomstick’s vibe was not artsy and edgy like the club in London had been, but Harry thought that was probably a good thing. This place was playing popular muggle dance songs, and the crowd was very young, with no one appearing to be much older than twenty-five. Everyone seemed half-pissed and rowdy.
He’d been so wrapped up in his thoughts that he’d nearly tripped over Malfoy, who was sitting against the wall in one of the far-flung, vacant corridors, crying.
“I’d planned to, but they got up rather abruptly. And besides…what if the waitress was right? What if we should be avoiding them? I’d rather not end up dead or in a prison here -- I have a feeling it wouldn’t be nice.”
“Me too.” Draco stood, looking every inch a lord, with his impeccable posture and his studied grace. “Come on. Let’s go out. We can look for bookstores, and maybe get dinner somewhere else.”
But despite the jellied feeling in his legs, he needed to get out. Needed to get out right the fuck now.
What are you looking at me like that for?) Harry fucking him into a wall and snogging him senseless at the same time. The others were all truly, horribly, sad, and he was focusing on those more. His face was, there's no other way to describe it, thoroughly melancholy. His left hand was clenched around the bottle, and he was slumped forward against the table, his right hand holding his face up. Eventually, he finished off the bottle, and he got up to go get more. He walked over to the bar, started to pull out a chair, and then someone hissed at him.
I look her over taking in her appearance. She’s wearing a simple tee shirt, that’s a soft, light, brown. Her light wash jeans have a S.P.E.W. patch sewed into them, under her pocket on her right leg. Her curly hair is parted over her left eye, and it falls to her shoulder blades. Her lips are a nice, dull, natural pink, her eyelids are a soft, shiny, whitish-pink, and her tan skin is so pretty. She has a book clutched in her right hand, and I absentmindedly wonder what she’s reading now.
Hermione had given Harry a truly scary look when he got up after Malfoy left, claiming that he was going to go back to the castle. Harry hadn’t expected Hermione to swallow the lie, and was relieved when she let him go.
Harry turned away from her, and got in the separate lift that took you to the seventh floor, which wasn't listed on the sign. That was where they dealt with damaged Alphas, Omegas, and Betas. Harry had a hard time going to this floor. Seeing all those hurt people...
She cuts him off, and I want to flip the bird at her. “No, Harry, you don’t understand. You need to heal him

going to get drunk off his arse. He ordered a bottle of Ice Vodka, (A whole fucking bottle, because that's what you could do when you were richer than the devil himself) which had a distinctly peppermint taste, and was icy cold. He sat in the corner, drinking straight out of the bottle.

I shake my head softly. “You’re having a panic attack, sweetheart. Do you remember that First Year in the Common Room, a few days after term started? He was having a panic attack, too.”
So sorry for the short chapter! I have places to be, and I will talk more tomorrow. REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW!
Ron ran over, looped his arm through Harry's, and said "He's not worth it, mate" coldly. Harry was shaking, the rage in his eyes clear. Hermione was on his other side now, holding him back. The dark-haired boy's hands were clenched so tightly that it was painful. His expression was terrifying, no one had seen him this mad in awhile. Ron and Hermione were scared, the last time that he was this mad it was not good.
Hey guys, I really just wanted to apologize for how sad the last chapter was, and if I did something to fuck you up I’m really sorry. So, on that note, this chapter is much happier. I specially want to apologize to aexthetic_luv, please feel better soon! Hope this chapter cheers you up, cuz this chapter made me go ‘I REALLY NEED THE FUCKING SUNSHINE IN THIS FIC’, so, enjoy!
“She’s right, mate.” I say quickly, because having Ron mad at me is a lot easier than ‘Mione being mad at me.
Samantha was my beautiful, sweet, adorable little sister. She followed me around, and did anything to catch my attention or hang out with me. She tried to copy the way I looked and dressed, (My Mother wouldn't let her cut off her butt-length hair, though) and she talked to me about the newest
tugs off his tie and shoes, unbuttons his shirt, tosses them on the floor, and climbs into bed with without another word.
time. You are special, Draco. I believe you are ready. Or, of course, if you refuse, I will kill you. So, I suppose it's this or death... Or I suppose your parents would satisfy my need to kill, too. Your choice, Draco."
I lay back down on my bed, sighing. I really don't want to open the gift from Harry, but at the same time I want to. It just makes it
I swear on my life I would die to be a normal kid who gets normal things and has a normal family that doesn't roll around in gold and they aren't worried about table manners and parties, but playing Quidditch in the backyard and doing housework.
Draco was pale, his face gray, and his eyes were dull and red-rimmed. His cheekbones were prominent, much more noticeable than the last time Harry had seen him. The skin was hanging off him, and the shadows under his eyes were dark. Harry had the strangest urge (
I still haven't changed my pajamas. Did I mention that they're Harry's? Well, I suppose I've been too suicidal to think about my pajamas.
*Cough* 394 *Cough*) he said, picking up a big pile of textbooks. He then proceeded to drop them loudly, and Ron groaned almost as loudly.
“Well, the whole point of this conversation was to A. Tell you about my wedding, B. Ask if you’d be a my Maid of Honor, and-”
Of course, the first thing I noticed was the cold bed, hopeless fuck that I am. I panic a bit, drawing in a breath, and then slowly the memory of last night came back to me.
I groan, and then start to say "This is so damn frustrat-" when Snape sweeps into the Common Room. I'm surprised, he tries to avoid coming in here if he can.
Dray nodded, and then hugged me. "Pans, you don't know how much this means to me. You understand why I can't be with Harry, right? I'm not good enough for him anymore. He's the one who's supposed to rid the world of the Dark Lord. He's supposed to be the Chosen One. And I'm one of the Dark Lord's fucking cronies. I- I- I can't. He'd kill me if he knew." Draco started sobbing towards the end. Blaise cleared his throat. Huh. I'd forgotten that he was here. "Uh, Draco, you didn't exactly have a choice here... so I suppose I can stay. But if you did this by your own accord, I'm going to leave. Sorry. I- I don't support
The mirror was steaming up, and the air was nice and warm. I striped slowly, put my clothes on the counter, and then eased myself into the warm water.
Harry lifted his arm up and shoved his face into his elbow, inhaling the scent of the fabric, trying to clear his mind. When he put his arm down, he was relieved to find that it was easier not to get drunk on that
I'm singing a chourus in my head that consists of "Fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck-" and so on. Really sorry about this chapter. It hurt to write it but, for the story to go on, this has to happen. I apologize. I also apologize for the last two chapters. They weren't very good. Also, PLEASE REVIEW! I've only had TWO reviews, from the lovely TweetArya and Goblet_of_fire4. THANK YOU GUYS, SO, SO, MUCH! (If you're reading this. I will put all reviewers names up here! So, just REVIEW! IT KEEPS THIS STORY GOING! A minute of your time and make someone's day! Please! Also, thank you to the people who left kudos! Bless your heart! Anyway, enjoy this shitty, rip my eyes out, stab me in the fucking heart chapter!
I know how much Dray needs Harry. Dray's more helpless than he seems. He has issues, and Harry made him a lot better than he used to be. The depression used to get to him, and the need to please his father. Harry fixed that. Harry made him better. I'm thankful for that. Dray needs a constant in his life. And, according to Hermione, Harry was a fucking
I'm sitting on the ledge of the Astronomy Tower, thinking about jumping off, and cutting, and how I can't see through my tears, and about my parents, and being a fucking Death Eater, and about that fucking boy who I love, with his stupid green eyes and his stupid scar and his stupid broomstick and stupid savior complex. And his stupid ability to fuck me senseless.
I said, and then a burst of white light shot out of my hand. The door shot open, and I fell over. When I looked at Hermione, she was on her butt, staring at me, her mouth wide open.
I lay Draco’s head down on his pillows, and then move to stand up. I start pacing, trying to think of what to do. I punch a hand through my hair, and then groan. What the hell are we going to do? My eyes flicker over to Blaise, and then I cast a quick
Angelina poured some creamer into another cup, and mixed it together with a small silver spoon. “Well, anyways, Harry, you’re here to meet the Omega. The weird part is that I
nice of you to show up!" my aunt said quickly, in her high-pitched, girly, over-excited manner. I nodded at her, still unsure of what I was seeing. I pushed my face into a cold mask. My father turned and faced me, as did my mother. When I looked at my mother's face I gave a small gasp. It wasn't audible, but I did it anyway. There were dark circles under my mother's eyes, and her face was creased with a worried and pained expression. "Draco." my father drawled in his cold manner, his eyes blank. I nodded, walking closer. "We have a very esteemed guest here, today." I nodded again. The tension was so thick in the air you could feel it. Everyone was tense, except for my Aunt Bella. She was smiling, seemingly excited. I wondered again who was in the chair, but I kept silent. I was polite, like I was taught to be. Then, a high, cold, voice broke the silence. "Draco." I felt dread wash over me in a wave.
can get out of class with cramps. All of the male teachers just nod, look a bit sick, and then point to the door. It even works with Snape, for some reason. Actually, I know that there’s a potion to get rid of the pain, but for some reason the male teachers don’t seem to remember that. McGonagall does, though. She keeps it on a shelf behind her desk, and hands it to any girl who uses the excuse. If you watch, some girls gulp it down, and you know that they actually have bad cramps, and some just set it aside.
I sigh inwardly, resigning myself to the fact that I’m going to have to talk about this with her. I look up at her.
Neville, Dean, and Seamus are talking about how Quidditch is going to start soon. Harry misses Quidditch, it’s the off season, and he can’t wait to get back to it. He can’t wait to get back to his team, the Magpies. He’s the #1 seeker in Britain right now. That’s nice, and all, but he’s getting sick of all the awards. Ever since he presented as an Alpha, the Daily Prophet has proclaimed him ‘Sexiest Alpha Alive’, three years running. It’s a lot, having girls throw themselves at you, hoping that their scent will be the one. Harry was just sick of it.
Harry’s pouring himself into Draco, more than I thought was possible. I keep waiting for him to pass out, but he doesn’t. The wounds are closing up slowly, more slowly than I’d like.
Ooooooh! Cliffhanger, folks. Also, almost everyone is gay in this story, so, uh, yeah. I love gay energy. Also, can you guys guess what house I’m in? I’m almost 100% sure that- well, never mind. Love you all!
on it in silver. Slytherin colors. I love it immediately, and pull it on over my pajamas. (My pajamas? Harry's pajamas?) It's warm and soft and exactly what I need. There's a tin in the package, too, and I open it. It's homemade fudge. Oh, god. I love fudge.
I’m trying, Dray. I really am. I’m pouring as much of my magic into you as I can, but the wounds are closing too slowly. Much too slowly. I’m going to pass out soon. This is too much.
Hey guys! I’m so sorry, I don’t have much time to talk right now. I’m going into the fucking wilderness to camp in an hour, so I’m kinda busy rn. I’ll be back Monday, so don’t worry. Also, sorry for the cliffhanger.
She tuts, and then grabs a vile, not saying anything. I suppose she wouldn't have to, she's already figured out what's all wrong with me, I suppose. She pushes it to my lips, and I gulp down the icey liquid quickly, the taste horrible, but I know what this is. It's a pain-relieving potion, and I couldn't want one more at the moment.
What I really want is for Harry to come in and wrap his arms around me, smooth back my hair, and for him to tell me it's all going to be ok, that he loves me, that he'll never leave me.
he was solely looking at Harry because he could, and no one would notice. He could stare at him all he wanted, and no one would care.
I still haven't changed my pajamas. Did I mention that they're Harry's? Well, I suppose I've been too suicidal to think about my pajamas. Fuckity fuck fuck. Sometimes, if I close my eyes, I can almost smell the warm smell that is Harry. It's hard to explain, it's just warm. I want to wrap myself in a blanket of it. My pajamas don't smell like him, though, no matter how hard I try to imagine it. I stole this weeks ago. I don't honestly know why my Mother grabbed these certain ones. They're the red and gold of Gryffindor. But I don't give a fuck as to
He wanted his Draco back. The one that was all cuddly and smart and had this irrational fear of Harry leaving him. (Which would never happen, well... unless he though it was for his well-being.) (He might do that... but he's quite selfish when it comes to Draco.) Harry didn't want some fucked-up prejudiced bitch. That wasn't his Draco.
I mean, I know that the world doesn't revolve around me. (I may forget it at times, though...) But really. Come on. I just got added to the biggest group of fucking bullies. Against my fucking will.
AND, a HUGE thank you to aexthetic_luv (I EVEN SPELLED IT RIGHT), nightlykudos, Drxrry_fxnfiction, prongslet612, and Obsessed_with_drarry! THANK YOU THANK YO7 THANK YOU!
Ginny and Luna were a very unique couple, and they didn’t get jealous easily. Again, Gin was very much a physical person, and so was Luna, so they had gotten over the whole ‘You’re touching someone else? You’re
“Draco,” he whispered in his ear. “What do you want? I want to do whatever you want.” Of all them, he was most worried about Draco, about how he would feel, about the impression this would make on him. He wanted him to feel so good, and not to have any regrets.
The world seemed, for an instant, good and right again, and he was convinced that everything would be fine, that he was here for a reason, because fate had willed it so, and he was on a path from which he could not stray, even if he tried. Everything would unfold the way it had to. It would unfold the way it had been unfolding from the very first sunrise in this world – the first sunrise in any world, really – and even further back, from the moment the Goddess had breathed her magic into the dark, endless void. He felt small, and negligible, but in the best way, and wholly at peace.
Harry smirked and suppressed a laughter. Malfoy did look so embarrassed yesterday so he won’t be forgetting that memory soon.
Ron, Fred, and George looked at each other for a moment before making their move to follow the pair. Hermione looked confused and lost so she decided to follow the three siblings.
Snape raised an eyebrow and promptly took Harry’s paper. He creased his eyebrows first before looking amused. “I suggest that before getting distracted, you finish your task first.”
Malfoy slid down the floor, his cheeks still flushed, and his heart beating wildly. He placed a hand on his chest willing it to calm down but it didn’t comply. “Damn you, Potter.” It took him several minutes before being able to stand up with his head held high but a blush apparent on his cheeks. He then went back to the Slytherin Common Room and decided to act like nothing happened.
It wasn’t the fact of the weirdness that surprised Draco, but the specifics of it. It was a bit like the Weasleys place, in that it was a tower-type structure out in the middle of nowhere. But it was black and oddly smooth, sort of militaristic in appearance. It looked, Draco realized, like a rook.
Madness, Draco thought. If William was wrong, it might make Potter angry. Although Draco was much less afraid of Potter now that he’d lost his wildfire magic. And really, Draco doubted Potter would get angry. Maybe embarrassed, if William was wrong, and Draco could just apologize for the intrusion and leave. Potter wouldn’t know that Draco knew he was down there after all.
He was at a muggle coffee shop on Monday, mid-afternoon, having slipped away from the Department of Mysteries to meet with one of his candidates. This one was called John, and looked to be around Draco’s age, maybe a little older. He was a bit more chiseled than most of the men Draco’d picked, but undeniably attractive. He had short blond hair and dark eyes and a few tattoos, and a body that rivaled the statue of David.
really fucking cold. His teeth were chattering. “Can we still sleep together? Or are you going to be all weird, now?”
Draco couldn’t stop touching Harry’s face. He drew a thumb over Harry’s jaw with its hint of downy stubble. He ran fingers over Harry’s cheekbones and along the line of his ear, trailed them down the side of his neck. His heart beat with a single note: Harry, Harry,
“Oh, Draco,” said Ernie, pulling him close for a hug. Draco let himself be pulled, let Ernie run a hand over his back, let Ernie press a kiss to his cheek. “I do miss you,” he whispered. And then, much to his delight, Draco felt it: Ernie was getting hard. Oh,
None of them besides Pansy knew anything about Blaise and Draco, or so he thought. He looked at Theo, who was laughing, and didn’t look like he was up to anything particularly evil. No, he was pretty sure Theo didn’t know.
Draco nodded. Suddenly, he found he was exhausted. Still a bit cold, but so tired he was ready to pass out. “Yes, that’s fine,” he said. “My skin hurts, by the way. Where it touched me. Can you take a look?”
But at night, Draco used his time to experiment. He ventured, for the first time in his life, into muggle London. Pansy’d gone with him. And they’d visited pubs and clubs and Draco found that men liked him, especially when he wore the tight things Pansy picked out for him and began to grow his hair a little longer, to his chin.
Nott laughed at that, loudly, and it made Draco jump. “You’re funny, though. I’ve always appreciated that about you.” Suddenly, Nott’s hand was on his hair, stroking it. “I don’t want to kill you, Draco,” he said softly. “I really don’t.”
That night, they set up a fire at the mouth of a cave and settled in, trying to ignore their hunger. Draco told Potter about the unicorn, and Potter was not impressed. “We have unicorns at home. Big deal.”
Besides, even if he could somehow get them to the general vicinity of the capitol city, they were all afraid of emerging in a public area, of traipsing through a Door that had appeared in the middle of a crowded street or something. They were going for stealth; that kind of entrance would be the exact opposite of stealthy.
“You saw him – yesterday – but then –” suddenly she slammed her fist down on the table. “What in the actual fuck!” she cried.
He went to bed that night in low spirits. He tried to think of positive things. He had a divine new muggle suit to wear to Gringott’s tomorrow; that was a good thing. He was having lunch with Luna, which was, bizarrely, also a good thing. She was a bit mad, but he liked her company. And, of course, he would see Potter at work tomorrow. Seeing Potter would remind him that he had a plan in place. It would also remind him that Harry Potter thought Draco was good enough to fuck. That surely meant there was
Frankie grimaced. “Not for the Molpaedians. One of their own now rules over the Kingdom of March. In her daughter’s stead supposedly, until she comes of age – Princess Lysandra is a genuine heir to the throne, as the daughter of Godwin, who was cousin to Prince Henry. But we all know the False Queen won’t ever give up her crown if she can help it.”
Harry looked up at the ceiling and thought about this. If Draco was alone, how could he have set off the bracelet? If he was alone, he couldn’t have accidentally brushed up against anybody, even, much less had someone kissing him or wanking him or –
Despite the knowledge he’d gained, though, Draco had been having no success at wandless magic. Laurel explained the technique to him and had him run through exercises, but they were going nowhere and it was frustrating. Thankfully, his body was so tired and sore every evening that he had little time in which to dwell on his magical failures.
They’d have gone through the years together, celebrating one anniversary and then another and another, maybe living in Grimmauld Place (but only if Harry had let Draco fix it up to an acceptable degree) or maybe finding a nice cottage somewhere on the coast. Draco’s always wanted to live on the coast. Somewhere like this, where you could hear waves knocking at your doorstep.
Harry was quiet for a while. Draco peeked over at him and saw that he was staring intently at Draco, green eyes bright in the dim of the room. “Tell me,” he said.
A terrible fury seemed to be crackling inside of Lia as she watched William leading Edwin through the door, a sword at his back. And then, suddenly, her shoulders dropped. “I’ll need help burying the dead,” she said, her voice a dull monotone.
Of course, Ron and George had gotten wind of the impromptu gathering, and they invited themselves along with Angelina and Lee Jordon and few others from that class. Ron also invited Neville and Ginny (“Harry, you’ve got to make peace with them, mate. They’ve moved in together, for Merlin’s sake. He’s not going anywhere any time soon and you can’t avoid my sister forever.”) and Seamus and Dean and Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott and Justin Finch-Fletchley and a few other people. Harry invited Hermione, thinking maybe this would be a good way for the Ron-Hermione reunion to occur, and Hermione showed up with Luna and Katie Bell.
