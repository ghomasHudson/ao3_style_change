Albus’ broom is leaned against the post.  The boy nowhere in sight.
Those are the noises he keeps an ear out for.
“She always -
“What qualified it as a level three?”  Granger persists.  She is smart Draco thinks.  Harry would be wise to listen to her now.  She is already planning how this will play politically.  Draco is too out of it to try to do the same at the moment.
“Wait.”  Harry cuts in.  Feeling surprised by his boyfriend’s answer.  Draco never mentioned anyone specific before.  “Who?”
“Neither do I, Harry.  I was referring to your squad’s reaction to being summoned by you.”
“I totally agree.”  Pansy concurs with a nod.  “The very thought of being separated from my children for most of the year while they’re at Hogwarts is horrendous.  I'm so glad to hear that McGonagall’s adapted Beaubaton’s more relaxed break schedule.”
“I have to figure it out.”
“Indeed.”  An elderly wizard in equally antiquated garb concurs though he does not leave his seat.  “Ablution should commence at the soonest opportunity.”
there anyways.  But Dad and Kreacher seem happier.
“Do you want to get out of here?”  Harry asks, yelling over the music.  He needs to cool down and pump the brakes here otherwise he and Draco are going to end up shagging on the floor.
missing their childhoods!  Why is it always this same old, tired argument, Mum?  This is a non-issue.”
“The manor represents what has come before us – before you.  It represents important moments in British wizarding history.”
He barks out a laugh at the idea.  How absurd.  “Are you sure it wasn’t the other way around?”  He retorts.
It was the first time he ever interacted with a muggle.  Doctor - although he had no idea that was a title and not a name.  One who listened to his chest with a cold metal device and inserted a needle briefly into his arm.  Apparently, there was some medicine muggles had that Father had refused to allow administered to him.  Of course, Draco did not comprehend this until years later.  All the healers had recommended it Mother later admitted to him.  Father had refused again and again.
“We should name her.”  Jamie suggests.  They’ll have to let them keep her then.  “What d’you reckon?  How ‘bout Daisy?  Or Clover?”
“This isn’t saying that.”  Harry replies just as quickly, tone firmer.  “And having a learning disability doesn't mean someone is stupid.  The school thinks you might have dyslexia.”
“Details, details.”
“Of course, I do.”  Draco answers somewhat indignantly.  “I don’t really know the when or the how that happened, but it seems I am devoted to them – as I am to you.”
There is a deliberate couple knocks on the door.
“Stop frowning.”  Draco chides lightly beside him as he finishes Lily’s plait.
“I want you too.”  Draco whispers.
It is enough to put him over the edge.
Oddly enough, that is comforting despite the sadness and hurt he feels regarding James.  He never anticipated any outright approval from Mrs. Weasley.  There again, he never anticipated that from Ginevra either.
“That death trap,” Harry defends immediately.  Regretting very much that he told his boyfriend how the bike came to be broken.  “Has three wheels – at least it will once I re-attach the sidecar.  Also, I'm rather sentimental toward it since it belonged to my godfather.”
in a pretty good mood when he collects them at pick up.  He usually is on his day off.  They go to the Burrow of course after Freddie gets out of detention for putting blow up gum on somebody’s jumper.  His uncle was a predictable guy.  Once they are at nan’s, Uncle Ron goes to have a drink with Grandad, sitting on the back porch.
Everything goes smoothly afterward.  Or so he thinks.  He would have thought nothing more on the matter had he not ducked back inside the Burrow to use the loo.  He finishes his business and steps out into the hallway and a doxy nest.
Astoria takes her hand in his.  The warmth of it briefly shocking him.  People rarely touched him anymore.  “Draco, don’t take this badly, but are you even attracted to women?”
Once he starts following Maud, he quickens his pace until he is jogging after her.  The crup tearing ahead as she realizes he is finally going to follow.
“You don’t say that to me!”  Uncle Ron thunders, making Jamie break out in goosebumps, “Not when you were the biggest bully at Hogwarts for years!  Not with all the shit things you did.”
too.”
“Mum took us to Uncle Fred’s grave.”  Al adds conversationally, swinging himself slightly around the post by his gloved hand.  “We gave him lots of wheezes Uncle George made.  There were no ghosts their either.”
laugh like my godfather.  You laugh like Sirius.”
.  It wasn’t my intention.  I know I don’t deserve it!”  The man exclaims, expression fierce and miserable.  “I was just so scared someone would try to kill me or put me back in Azkaban.  I wanted to be something small.  I was
“He’s trying to help, Ron.”  Dad responds exasperatedly.  Jamie never liked to hear that tone.  It usually meant more chores.  “They both are because you’ve been a right arse all night.”
“As my own godson would say, ‘I am shook’.”  Harry tells him.  Thinking fondly of Teddy, who was already a third year Hufflepuff at Hogwarts.
Harry watches Ron arrive, stomping his feet on the rug and rubbing his hands together to warm them.  Cheeks red from the cold.  It's a cold day.  Harry, himself, is sporting the cane Ron had made him today.  Leg aching in protest at the chill.  Ron spots him and comes over, shrugging out of his coat and sitting down across from him.
Draco moves out of Harry’s hold, drawing himself up to his full height.  Affecting more poise.  All posh.  “Now take me home, Potter.  I’m not going to blow you in here.”
“Which is precisely why I came here, Father.  I thought you would want me to restore the manor.  Am I wrong?”
He and Al cheer loudly and high five.  Maud barks and Lily claps.
“What?”  He questions, nonplussed.
“It could have been worse.”
Ginevra is hosting Lily’s party at the Burrow.  Lily practically vibrates with excitement as their household, including the children’s beloved crup, step through the main fireplace at Grimmauld to floo to their destination.  Mrs. Weasley is there to greet them as they step out.  Ready to embrace the birthday girl.
“Am not!”  Al refutes.  Miffed for being the only one reprimanded.
“Don’t touch me!”  His boyfriend hisses, ripping his arm away and taking a step back until they are staring at each other.  Hurt and anger all directed toward him.
“How’d you like dinner, sprog?”  Dad asks cheerily, in an especially good mood tonight.  Probably because of the pizza.
“Draco is my favorite.”  Lily informs her grandparents seriously.  “He does my hair better than Daddy.”
“So?”
Moira Whitacre and Oumar Sy, his fellow deputy heads, and Robards are there when he arrives.  Heavy door closing automatically behind him.  It was not unusual for them to gather early in the morning like this when the day shift was starting.
“No.”
“You could do that.”  Astoria encourages, leaning into his space.  “We do
“More like who.”  Ron mumbles under his breath.  Everyone hears him anyway, considering they all turn as one to face Harry except Hermione who gawks at her husband.
He is in a sling and his cuts are largely healed by the time he sets foot back home.  Harry at his side, lightly supporting him.  The children have been told he was in an accident working on the manor, but the severity of it was underscored.  Draco feels this is the correct choice as Lily and Albus spend the next week offering him pillows and candies to ‘make him feel better’.  James even brings him tea in Draco’s favorite mug as if they did not have house elves to help with such things.
.”  Astoria answers immediately, sounding desperate.  “We could leave here.  Live overseas like the others.  Date who we want.  Work where we want.
“I should mention, Draco,” Mrs. Malfoy drawls at the end of breakfast as she dabs daintily at the corner of her mouth with her cloth napkin.  “Bixby tells me there’s something digging holes on that quidditch pitch of yours at night.  He fixes one and two more pop up in its place the next morning.  He suspects some creature is coming in from the forest mucking about.”
The half-harpy gives him a discerning look.  “Excuse me?”
Lucius stares, saying nothing for a long moment.  “I am certain the curse breakers did admirable work weaseling out anything
Lily is bouncing up and down on her toes by the time Harry unlatches the gate and enters.  She grabs Draco excitedly by the hand, dragging him forward.  “Nan, Granddad, my Draco is here!  Do you see?  He’s here!”
“I want you to be happy.”  Molly tells him earnestly, eyes bright with unshed tears.  “I’ve always wanted that for you.  I know that my children have to choose what that means for themselves – even if I don’t quite understand it.”
“Mr. Potter here will likely be head auror one day, then who knows?”  Narcissa remarks shrewdly, gesturing to Harry.  Her expression sharp and expectant like Draco should be following along.  “Maybe even minister of magic?  One day?  Shouldn’t you – as his partner – be able to grandly regale his visitors?”
“Don’t pull a muscle, mate.”  Harry half-jokes.
“Fine.”  Draco responds, putting his hands in his pockets.  It was mostly true especially now Potter was here.  “Better than I ought to be perhaps.  I should have come sooner.  Mother has been pestering me for updates.”
That statement hits something painfully vulnerable within him.  Something heartbreaking.
“Cissy.”  Andromeda answers, getting to her feet.  She reaches out an expectant hand to Narcissa.  Who glides forward to take it.  They stare at each other with such concentration that even the sprogs pay attention.
“What does it matter?”  He argues back, keeping his voice even as the others were trying to enjoy their meal.  “We’re the same distance away.”
“What whim is that?”
None of that worked in the end though.
“Never thought I’d have anything like you, love.  How could I?"  Draco utters, cracking an eye open for a moment, face flushing even harder as they stare at one another.  He wants to lick the skin there.  Feel the warmth of it.  Draco audibly gulps.
Although, tensions between him and the Weasleys have eased since they initially became aware of his relationship with Harry, they were far from fast friends.  Oddly enough, he is likely closest with Ronald and Ginevra.  The two he anticipated disliking him most.  Justifiably so.
That makes them laugh, but Jamie doesn’t know what’s so funny.
“I haven’t restored everything yet.”  Draco tells them, expression considering.  “My mother might come to live here later – at least for part of the year – and I need to hire house elves to help maintain the place.  I suppose there will be times I stay here too.”
Hermione looks apologetically at Harry and then back at Draco.  “I-I apologize for my husband’s behavior.”  Hermione begins, sounding stricken.  “He has no reasonable proof something criminal is occurring between you and Harry.”
“Bold of you to assume we’re going to leave the hotel room.”  Harry states with a ridiculous waggle of his eyebrows.
Lily looks around herself then back at her doll.  “Narcissa.”
“Please, that is not the only reason you’re staying, and you know it.”  Astoria replies, smile wicked.  “I don't care how happy work is making you.  I've seen you content in your research before this, you know.  If it were down to job satisfaction and cloistering yourself away in a potions lab you would have stayed in France.”
“Whatever it is we’ll handle it together.”  Hermione assures taking his hand.
“Let him go.”  Draco breaks in.  Perhaps they all needed time to cool off.  James appeared ready to have a burst of accidental magic from the way he was trembling.
They are in the lunchroom at school.  He's sitting with his mates: Yuri, Ian, and Hogarth.  It was normal for kids to trade their food for things they wanted during the meal time.  Jamie traded his veg for crackers often enough.  He hated all the green stuff Draco asked Olta to make them.
Jamie listens as Draco tries to answer each one.  He’s not sure Draco expected so many questions.  He’s kind of blinking a lot.  It's sort of obvious when adults weren’t used to kids especially little ones like Al and Lily.  Jamie almost feels bad for him.  Dad laughs at them and pats Draco on the shoulder, leaving his hand there.
“Pansy.”  Anthony intones, reprimanding.
“And your marriage?”
“Seriously, Malfoy?”
“True, but it was my intention to give you control of the manor since you relocated to Britain.  You are obviously well suited to life here in London, but perhaps you might want to retire to the countryside occasionally.  There is certainly ample room for the children to run about and more space to entertain.”
Draco ignores him.  It is their lovely little nightly routine.  Everyone hollering at each other until someone cracks and starts howling in hysterics.  Apparently, it is the height of entertainment.
“Is it really that big of a deal?”  Ron questions in a contemplative tone.  “I don’t think Harry was asking for too much.  I mean, Draco trusts him.  They’re living together.  They've
sweet.”
The fire is what wakes him first.  Sparks catching around him.  Indicating to him that he has succeeded in this first step.  The odor of burning debris and hair burns his nostrils.  He hates fire.  Hated it ever since being nearly consumed by Fiendfyre when he was seventeen.  Still has nightmares about it.  Waking in fright thinking that a wave of intense heat is about to overtake him.
Draco sighs.  He has hurt so many people.  How can he possibly risk more?  “No, thank you.  I’d rather not involve any more ministry employees.”
Harry takes a breath, feeling nervous.  “I need to tell you both something.”  He admits, not sure how to say it.  Feeling silly for being hesitant around the two people he trusts most.
Their mornings are spent together.  Much of their free time really and he enjoys it.  He keeps waiting for when he grows tired of Harry or the children.  He has lived with people before.  It is normal to be irritated with them from time to time.  This happens with the Potters – sort of.  Draco is given free reign of Grimmauld’s library.  The desk Harry keeps in there is converted to Draco’s personal use.  He goes there if he wants to work or have some time apart but not wanting to go back to his flat.  Various Potters popping in and out.  The children have been cautioned that when Draco is at his desk, they are to treat the space like Harry’s study: a work space.
The portkey out is an old muggle plane ticket stub funnily enough.  Their luggage is packed and both he and Harry are weighed down by their carry-ons as they wait in Harry’s office at the ministry for their departure.  Harry arranged it for their convenience.  Sometimes it was nice to have an
“Yeah, they got married.”  He confirms nodding.  “They’re busy too of course.  I don’t see them much.  The last couple of years have been, er . . . not too good between us.”
“French people can't play quidditch!” Al complains loudly causing Lily to giggle madly.  Shaking her head repeating, “No, no, no,” like Nan.
“How did they hurt your mother?”
“Now that everyone is present, we will proceed with the oversight hearing.  Guards, if you will please?”
Harry shrugs.  “Maybe.”  He hedges, not especially willing to pursue that line of thought.  He never wanted to buy into his own legend.  He had done a great deal of hard work.  There was no denying that much.  But people forgot how much of his success hinged on sheer luck and the friendships he had.  The people he had lost.  It made him feel very tired at times.
“I try.”  Hermione retorts, eyes scanning the crowd around them.  “Ooh.  Here’s a good one.  Ron, the woman in the teal dress.”  Harry searches to see who Hermione suggested.
“Gu - what?”  Hobbs questions, nonplussed.
“How often have you discussed your work with Mr. Malfoy?”
“Freddie?”  George Weasley prompts his son.
“It's rude to stare.”  Draco says after taking a sip of his drink.
“I’ll ask Draco.”
It occurs to him he has never seen Malfoy in clothing that wasn’t black or a Slytherin emerald green.  It's striking.  More than it should be probably.  Malfoy's hair was no longer severely sleeked back either.  Instead now loose and slightly wavy, combed back out of his way.  The length an inch or so longer than how Harry remembered it when they were in school.  The man seemed more approachable this way.  Less severe.  Harry is left thinking how good Malfoy looks, and forces himself to survey the room instead.
Hermione lifts the silencing spell.  Draco waits, facing the inquisitors expectantly.  Harry can see how upset Draco is right now by the way he holds himself, but he doubts very much the council can tell the degree to which Draco is affected.  They may guess at some embarrassment given the receding flush on the man’s face.  However, Draco continues to project polite indifference despite that hurdle.
“Who’s who?” Harry prompts Hermione as they head to the open bar.  It was a game the three of them had invented when they began work at the ministry years ago.  They had been meeting so many people back then it felt like a never-ending onslaught.  The basic premise of the game was that each pointed someone out to the other until they could not name them.  It made Hermione furious when she lost.
“I told them a bit of what Gran told me about Draco and the war – about death eaters.”  Teddy recounts, expression abashed and hair shifting to its embarrassed maroon.

Lily nods her head.  “I love you, Daddy.”  She proclaims earnestly.  Jamie is impressed.  It's a good opener on her part.  But she’s too green to know Dad sees right through her.
.  Rosier was ruthless – more so than the rest of them.  A year older than him, Ethan Rosier was a graduate of Durmstrang and his aunt’s star pupil.
in case you’ve forgotten, I have children who rather enjoy destroying everything.  Or have you forgotten the crystal decanter incident at your flat?”
“Death would have been better.”  He argues back.
“That is a . . . grey area.”  Draco replies averting his gaze.
Draco’s investigation of the photos is interrupted when Potter returns, scotch in hand and another glass being floated over to Draco.  An ancient looking house elf is trailing behind him muttering under his breath, hunched over.  Draco cannot quite make out what he is saying.  This is very possibly the oldest elf Draco has ever laid eyes on based on the grey of his skin and length of his ears.
“Er - yeah.”  He responds, slightly surprised.  It had been some time since that had been brought up.  “It’s because of the scar tissue – that’s what the healers said anyways.”
“I am really not enjoying how much Viktor Krum played into a lot of our first kisses.”  Harry remarks, scratching at the back of his neck.  “He's a nice bloke and a talented quidditch player - don’t get me wrong - but really?  Him?”
“I’ve work.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco is decidedly okay with that plan at least going by the way his own heart speeds up at the touch.  The way his stomach swoops in anticipation.  He removes his shirt letting it fall to the ground around their ankles and reaches up, placing his palm on Potter’s cheek.
Pansy turns on him, hands on her hips.  Acrylic nails a bright red today.  “What in Circe's name do you mean by that?”
“My mother died from dragon pox when I was five and, in this country, magical children with no family are taken in by the ministry and placed in an orphanage specific to their needs.”  Simone delineates.  “House elves ran the orphanage, and they were very loving.  I am fortunate that they care little about sex and gender.  I could be myself there, whatever that looked like, but I was not allowed to fully transition until I came of age.”
Rocking against Draco is simultaneously maddening and wonderful.  Keeping things slow.  Enjoying being close.  He kisses and nips at Draco’s exposed collarbone.  Sucking a mark into the hollow of his boyfriend’s neck as his hands hold Draco’s hips so he can grind their erections together.  Draco has an arm wrapped around him and his other hand at the nape of Harry’s neck.  Tugging at the hair there.  Meeting Harry in messy, prolonged kisses as they writhe together.
my parent.  I don’t care what Lily calls you.  You aren’t anyone special to me!  You’re not even a good person!”
“I was asking what they thought about Draco over breakfast.  They told me they liked him.  But then I said something I shouldn’t have.  I upset Lily then.”
“You could say that.”  Harry admits.  It was true enough.  He had been dragging his feet all day trying to avoid thinking about coming here.  Let alone actually being here.  Seeing Draco buzzing, engrossed in his element.
Draco exits the room after a long moment. His steps filling the silence and echoing behind him.
The boys are unfazed and call for Kreacher.
Ron shifts in his seat again.  Glancing around the pub as if someone might be trying to overhear.  In fairness, that was always a distinct possibility, although Harry’s instincts were telling him that wasn't the case now.  The other patrons, scattered as they were, seemed occupied with their own tables.
The diagnostic charm he casts absolutely shimmers from a decades long curse.  An ugly one with some variant of a possession spell.  It was never good when a witch or wizard connected part of themselves to an object outside of them.  Those spells typically festered as most curses imitating immortality did.  This portrait no longer allowed the impression to leave the frame any longer.  Someone must have tried to nullify the spell at one point.  It was often the first line of defense with malfunctioning portraits.  They were meant to be benign reflections of their counterpart after all.
Astoria digs her nails in.  “He might let himself love you and that is scary for him, Harry.”  She whispers gravely to him.  “For anyone really, but for Draco it's different.  Once Draco loves someone it never goes away.  Whatever happens.  No matter how much he wishes he would not.  He is built that way.  Everything else about him he can adapt and learn from for the better but not when it comes to love.”
Potter is generally affable and engages easily with his children.  Quick to meet them on their level.  Play on the floor and run around with them.  It is completely foreign to Draco.  He has never seen a father behave in this way.  His father and the fathers he knew growing up were very formal and demanding with their children.  Removed although clear in their high expectations.  Authoritarian in everything they did.  Potter seems content to spend time with his kids and support them in their interests – banal as they are sometimes.  Giving them consequences to any wrongdoing as they arise.
Eventually, those excuses feel flimsier and flimsier.  The visits become most of the weekends he doesn’t have the kids.  Arriving at the man’s doorstep and letting himself in with his copy of the house key.  He usually finds Draco in the kitchen pouring over yet another recipe and partway through the process.  Kitchenware everywhere and flour across the countertop.
Lately, they have taken to walking around for Malfoy to observe any changes in his stride.  It doesn't hurt that Harry likes Malfoy watching him, can pretend a handsome bloke is checking him out.  He will not deny that, and he
Lily, who clearly enjoyed the late morning drama, goes from each doorway of her brothers’ rooms poking at their wounds until Draco calls her away.
“He still built the system,” The head auror counters.  “It may be of benefit to bring Draco Malfoy in to review his . . . experiences.”
Harry turns back to his son.  “Fine.  You go straight to your mum’s.  We
“You really don’t know me?”  Hollingsworth repeats aghast.
“I was planning to visit your father tomorrow.  I hoped you might join me.”  Narcissa comments lightly as if she were going to tea and not into one of the heaviest guarded wizarding prisons in the world to see a man who well-earned the tightest security restrictions the institution offered.
side.”  Ron quibbles back.
Her expression turns baffled but no less intent.  “Why is that, Harry?”  She questions using the tone usually reserved for the kids.  Patient, gathering more information.
“Yeah.”  Jamie agrees morosely.  “We should go back.  Maybe the pitch will be ready to use now?”  He gets to his feet, brushing off the dirt on his clothes.  Al tries to stand too but stumbles forward, catching himself by his hands as the strap holding his tri-scopes rips and the lenses skitter forward under a large shrub.
He was afraid Malfoy would choose impractical items and is pleasantly surprised when it is the exact opposite.  Allowing Harry to aid him in purchasing clothes that will let him fit in with muggles when he does have to venture into the village and buying little more than the necessities for each room.  In fact, the only things the man really splurges on are books.  Loads of them.  Instructional.  Historical.  Fiction.  Nearly every wall in the house is shored up with new bookcases and shelves containing volumes by day three.
Harry puts an arm around Draco’s waist as they talk.  Keeping an ear in on the conversation and taking in the place.  The tall ceilings.  People milling about.  The golden lights and partitions separating groups off to the side getting bottle service.  He could even see a good bit of the stage above the dance floor from their position by the bar.
“No.”  He acknowledges beginning to feel foolish.
.  He was lucky to not get in too much trouble for eavesdropping, but Dad had been dealing with Al being naughty and Lily being upset.  “Maybe it will help if I tell you a story.”  Dad says smiling tiredly at him.  “Once upon a time, there was a boy who was told by his parents all his life that he was the most special person in the world.”
The last time was probably after his injury when Lily was an infant.  He was on crutches then and poked around the shed with Lily strapped to his chest in a baby bjorn.  In hindsight, it was not one of his better ideas to take his infant daughter into a tool shed filled with sharp objects when he wasn't so steady on his feet.
“Yes!”  His boyfriend agrees enthusiastically, eyes widening that much more, and grin growing wicked.  The heat of his gaze makes Draco shiver.
“I didn’t do anything.  Jamie’s a liar!”  Al flails.  Which is completely unfair.  Al doesn’t know anything.  Jamie would know if he knew.  Besides, out of the three of them, Al got in trouble the least even
“That’s not true.”  Harry disagrees.
“No, are you hurt?”  Draco inquires, fingers kneading at his arms.  Face concerned.  “Sore?  You want water?”
Jamie groans and Al puts his head in his hands.
“No.  Do you know what death eater means?”
“I have a note from the headmistress.  Don’t freak out.”  James says all in one rushed breath.
“Why not just keep the album at home and summon it?”  Draco had wondered honestly confused, observing the children rough house and yell over each other.  Intrigued that a sound recording was also a feature of the device.  Muggles really could be so clever.  A fact that would frequently re-astonish him.  Potter chuckled, resting his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“Am I supposed to remember every little thing?”  Mrs. Malfoy replies airily, expression entirely unconcerned as she directs her teaspoon to stir the contents of her teacup.  “That dreadful addition is hardly at the top of my priority list.  Thank Circe, it’s at the back of the estate.  Perhaps your visitors will not have time to see it?”  She tacks on in a hopeful tone.
He loved that motorbike.
The girl shrugs nonplussed.
is news to Harry.  “Fake boyfriend?”  He repeats.  He had been under the impression the two had seriously dated.  Albeit with Draco closeted as he was.  Then, of course, there was that rumor in sixth year that they had ended their relationship because Lucius thought Pansy wasn't good enough for his son.
“I wanted to ask you . . .”  Greg starts, hesitant and fidgeting with the ear of his cup.  “You’re smarter than me.  Always have been.  You know all about potions and things.  Is there a way to make
Olta stays with them here too which is nice.  If he’s ever unsure where to go to meet up with everyone else, he can call her, and she’ll help him straight away.  Appearing next to him with the familiar snap of her apparating.  All the other house elves live at the manor and take care of it.  He’s not around them much.  Bixby and Dort mostly, but he isn’t supposed to ask them for anything like he would Kreacher or Olta.  Dad was very clear on that.
“Humor me.”
“Yeah.”  Potter says smile slow and glasses slightly crooked from their position.  Draco wishes he found that less hot.  “I never date anyone either.  Well, er, at least not properly – not with talking and stuff like with you.  Not with – well - you know.”  Potter gestures to Draco with a nod.  As if Draco lying with him on the couch were some sort of statement he is meant to plainly interpret.
Draco’s face remains placid.  “Hello to you too, Weasley.  Granger.”  Draco greets nodding politely to Hermione.  Harry looks from Draco to his two best friends.  He and Hermione share a long look.  Hermione’s eyes questioning and concerned until she breaks eye contact to gaze at Draco.
“I’m sorry, Harry.”  Draco apologizes with a smirk, entering his space and leaning in to kiss him reassuringly.  “A little too much?”
Other children have gathered around to watch and go back and forth to their tables from there.  The place is busy.  Jamie knows the other kids are muggles.  He can tell by the way they dress and the cell phones some of them have.  Most wizarding kids he knows don’t have those.  In fact, the only adults he knows that do are his dad and Aunt Hermione.
“Oh, well, it was the third week of my trainee days and we had this perp –
you obsessed with me?”  Malfoy drawls, dragging a finger up the middle of Harry’s chest.  Making him twitch.
“If you refuse to take it, they may move to charge you and go to trial.  My instinct is that they would.  If we go to trial, there is no guarantee you would not have to take it anyways.  If you do take it, they are only allowed to question you about the facts pertaining to this case.  Taking the potion can only help your cause if you have nothing to hide, even though the potion itself is not a 100% guarantee of truthfulness.”  She delineates, frowning.  “Draco, it is your decision.  I will support you regardless.”
“I’m very proud.”
Jamie’s no auror, but even he knows an overturned potted plant in the family sitting room isn’t a good sign.  Particularly since dirt has been scattered all around and there are paw prints leading directly to their bedroom.  In fact, the main problem Jamie discovers is the open door to his and Al’s bedroom.  The secondary problem is that the door to the loo is also wide open.  Dirty paw prints intersect over the carpet with no distinct destination.
He heads directly to Draco.
Draco shakes his head, but he is smiling.  He grabs Harry by the hand, leading them to the edge of the crowd.  Slowly making their way out.
“Use your words.”  Harry prompts teasingly.
A strained moment passes.
“Ah.”  Granddad comments, frowning.  “Ron, I don’t know if we ought to say anything here.  Harry may want to talk to him about this.”
“This is all very interesting, Potter.”  Malfoy replies, face displaying the opposite.  “But our research requires frequent check ins especially early on.  Unfortunately –
She was better now – he supposed.  The last few times he had been around her outside of school pickup had been . . . tolerable?  It was difficult to say.  Draco typically fielded the majority of the interactions which was fine by him.
“You know why not.”  Draco intones significantly.
“Mad for you.”  His boyfriend retorts, leaning upward to kiss him on the nose.  Draco despairs at how much he enjoys the affection.
It does not feel strange or awkward.  It feels like the sun came out.  It makes him glad.
The minister nods gravely.  “Perhaps.”  He responds, stroking his chin.  “Of course, the majority of death eaters responsible for sowing doubt and chaos in those initial days of each war are dead now or incarcerated.  It
Thanks for reading!  This one was peak domestic.  I appreciate all your thoughtful comments and kudos.  As always, I own nothing but plots.
“It was you who caused the core to turn on us.”
When he walks into the kitchen to find Draco frying eggs for them, dressed in joggers and a forest green tee something in him wants to walk over there and hug him.  Instead, he sits at the counter and opens the village’s weekly bulletin that Draco gets delivered.  It is full of advertisements for the local shops, villagers’ announcements, and upcoming events.
Jamie despairs when he hears Hugo and Lily going down the stairs to the main floor.  He can hear their footsteps as they run past the entrance to the sitting room.  This was maybe not the hiding spot he had hoped it would be.  He buries himself back into his hidey hole.  Hoping no one will notice him.
“He wasn’t even around then.”  James cuts in sharply with a wave of his fork to punctuate his point.  “He’s not our dad.”
.”  The man gasps in his ear.
“We – Harry and I – it's serious.”  He states.  Reflective.  “I think we are going to be together for a long time.  I-I love him.”
It is a small home.  Not at all different or notable from the other cottages dotting the outlying area of the village.  Two bedrooms, bath, kitchen, sitting room, and a small fenced-in garden out back.  There is an unattached garage, but he doubts they will need it.  He casts the Fidelius Charm so that only muggles can see it and remember it.  Anyone magical would see an unoccupied lot filled with mulberry bushes and an oak tree.
“Ginny, I’m dating Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s not the same.”  Draco denies with a jerky shake of his head, looking away.
“That is not the worst point you have ever made,” Draco admits.  Reflecting on the earlier interaction at the pub.  Perhaps Harry was right.  He missed romantic social cues on occasion.  Astoria has teased him about that forever.
“Potter,” Malfoy drawls, leveling Harry with a put-upon expression, “As you’ve managed to be here today, there are surely some times you can come in.”
“Oh?” Granddad bites, prompting him to continue.
“Are we good?”  Ronald asks, approaching with his hands in his pockets.  Breaking from the rest of their group nearby.  Casting fruitive looks between the lot of them.
It is a beautifully wrought silver ring with a Celtic knot pattern engraved onto its outer surface.  The inside of it has an etching of a roaring lion and a serpent posed to strike.  He can detect some of the charm work inlaid on it, but he is not entirely certain the extent of it.  The whole thing is incredibly thoughtful, and he will cherish it forever.
He drank heavily in those first few years whenever he was not due at work or had some other responsibility.  Trying to feel relaxed and keep bad memories at bay.
?"  Hermione argues.  "Draco’s been stressed getting the manor finished and probably thinking a lot about the war.”
Hermione rolls her eyes, but her expression is embarrassed.  Draco feels the same, briefly shielding his eyes with his hand.  Although, privately, he cannot deny that a part of him wants to spend the whole trip sequestered away with Harry in their hotel suite.
“Have the children met him yet?”  Hermione questions, glancing over at said sprogs playing on the swing set.  Jamie's climbed on top of the play set.  He was the risk taker of Harry’s lot although he had a feeling Lily would not be too far behind.
“Draco.  Malfoy.”  Ron states loudly, dragging out each syllable.
“Really?!”  Hermione comments sarcastically.  “That’s your excuse?  I was in that meeting.  Kingsley cleared you to read him in.”
“Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, most of his family, or Draco himself.”
He really likes snogging.  Loves it really.  The only other activities that fully distract him are quidditch and sex.  Lucky for him, Ginny has similar interests.  She is the best girlfriend a bloke could have.  She smells great no matter what they're doing.  Ginny is soft and firm as she holds herself against him.  Her fingers pressing and rubbing along his body in ways that have him writhing.  When they separate, panting for breath, Harry wills his erection down.  Ginny is
Lily is snuggled in her quilt on his lap, little socked feet sticking out and Albus between them tucked into Harry’s side.  James is the only one content to lay his head on his mother’s lap and watch the animated movie Harry is playing on the televisior machine.  The three little Potters fall asleep not even halfway through the film.  Draco has seen this film several times now.  It is about a muggle warrior woman in China.  There are few ‘princess’ movies the boys are willing to watch with Lily and this is one of them.
Harry raises an inquisitive eyebrow at that, chuckling a bit.  “His intentions?”  He repeats incredulously.  Not quite sure he heard that right.
“Hardly a ringing endorsement of his teaching ability.”  His lab partner comments disparagingly.  Draco elects to ignore that.  It was hardly the first critical comment that came his way and far from the cruelest.
“But we don’t have to only ‘do fine’.”  Draco reasons, turning fully in his seat to face Harry.  “It was perfectly acceptable that I move in the rest of my wardrobe, but Merlin forbid I try to bring
“Blaise Zabini.”  Pansy names airily, then elbows Draco who appears reluctant.  “Come on, Malfoy.”  She cajoles.
“Very well, afternoon then.” Malfoy suggests easily.
“No.  Can you imagine with my history?”  Malfoy responds evenly without glancing up, finger tracing the small print located underneath a picture of Harry’s leg following his second transplant procedure.  The failed one.  Harry grimaces seeing it.  “I am only a researcher as Healer Hargreeves said.  I have earned my mastery certifications in potions and dark archaeology and antiquities, but researcher is much more succinct.  Don’t you agree?”
“How are you?”  Potter inquires, gesturing to the decrepit manor before them.
Hermione hums her acknowledgement, focusing on him.  Harry didn't want to hurt her, but he wants to live honestly as well.  “There's a decent chance you won’t approve of him.”
handsome.”  Lily asserts, stamping her foot.  Hands on her hips in a manner reminiscent of her grandmother and glaring up at her father.  “I put makeup on him!”
“We are not discussing this further.”  Draco deflects, moving to stand behind his chair.
“I am here all the time anyway.  I suppose it was bound to happen.”  Draco muses.  It has been several months since they renewed their acquaintance and began dating.  He has no idea what is proper in their case.  None of his friends dated anyone with children before that he knows of.  None seriously at any rate.  When he used to contemplate dating, he imagined a single man.  One not too dissimilar from himself.  No children and likely no previous marriage with which to contend.  Some manner of professional, involved in their own career.  Harry is one of the three.
Hermione raises a critical eyebrow at him.  “So you can make the connection between what pajamas he wears and sexual receptivity, but you couldn’t take it the step further that perhaps Draco wasn’t in the mood to discuss the war?”  Hermione remarks giving him a disappointment look.
“Two months.”  Draco replies.  He had been counting down the days.  Waiting for the other shoe to drop and for them to drag him back to Azkaban.  Mother and Mrs. Greengrass were planning the wedding for right after.  He did not entirely dread the wedding, but Astoria was correct, he did not want to be married to her.  It would not be a true marriage.
Potter cocks his head at him, expression confused.  “I’m not following.”
“Do you think you’re funny?  Ron demands, taking a threatening step forward.
“Well, besides me, right?”  Potter cracks.
Potter shrugs.  “Whatever we want, like we were doing before.”
It isn’t only Mrs. Malfoy though.  Thankfully, it’s people he knows.  Neville Longbottom and his wife, Hannah, are on plush chairs next to each other with teacups in hand as Mrs. Malfoy’s small house elf serves them.  Mrs. Tonks, Teddy’s nan, is there too sitting beside her sister on the fancy, old couch.  Dark hair done up and dressed for the dinner thing.  All the adults looking perplexed at the crup pacing between Jamie and his siblings.
“They help so much already with pickups, and dinner, and looking after them when I’m late at work.”  Harry admits with a bashful smile.  “I’ve primary custody and Gin’s so busy with her own work.  She only gets to see them so much, you know.”
“Darling.” Mother said pointedly, carefully placing her cup on its saucer with a clink.  “Whether you like it or not – and I am well aware not – you will be the twelfth generation Malfoy to hold that land.  The last too as you say.  Whatever remains of it will represent you and what you have done for our family.  You will have the last word so to speak.”
“Who fed him beans?”  Harry asks somewhat aghast.  Running a hand through his hair and grimacing.
overstepping.”  Harry reassures, switching to the logical one now in the conversation.  “And, Lily’s
Draco is still firmly against him when his boyfriend ends their kiss.  Staring at him with his pupils blown.  Grey eyes reflecting all the colorful light around them and a solid silver all the same.  Draco’s expression fascinates him.  Entertained, happy, aroused; Harry loves it all.  He wants him.
“You’ve been distracted.”  Hermione observes from her spot on the patio bench next to Harry.  The children are playing on the playset in the Granger-Weasley’s backyard as they sip wine and watch – like good parents.
“We don’t have to do this.  We’d have plenty fun doing something else.”  He offers.  It wouldn’t be the first time they decided to do something different during prep.  He was okay with that and he knew his boyfriend was assertive enough to tell him so.
“I don’t know.  I don’t make the rules, ‘Mione.”  Ron replies in a dour tone.
His boyfriend starts pressing incrementally forward while leaning down to kiss Draco soothingly.  Only breaking the kiss to nibble at Draco’s neck, licking the mark he left there.
Late is apparently half past midnight according to Draco.
“There’s only us now.”  Luna promises serenely as she and her friend enter the room.  “How lovely, more Potter children.”  The woman notes pleasantly as she sees Jamie’s siblings.
"Maybe."  Greg allows, mouth twisting.
The shed is not all that big.  They never even magically expanded it.  There are some shelves on the wall that used to contain tools he had for taking care of the house.  These days, Ginny has odds and ends in here.  Broken bits of pottery and gardening tools.  His motorbike is covered by a tarp and does admittedly take up a significant amount of available space.  He hesitates for a second before removing the tarp.  He has not had a proper look at the bike in years.
“Yes, thank you.”  Harry really means to be more appreciative and less sullen.  The salve did help him quite a lot.  He had even been able to tolerate a bath or two which helped reduce achiness.  It had been nice to use the master bath’s tub for once instead of just storing his dirty boots in it.
Draco as matter of fact as can be, adding, “Astoria was quite keen to leave too considering her greatest motivation in life was to work at a burlesque club with muggles – Mother did not care for that bit of news,” provoking Harry to roar more.  Draco – for he was Draco to Harry at that point – looking on patiently, trying and failing to suppress a pleased grin.
“Do I bother you?”  He finally asks one summer night where they are sat in the back garden on the patio chairs.  The small wooden table between them holding Draco’s glass of wine while Harry fidgets with the nearly empty bottle of ale.  The glass warm in his hand and feeling oddly uncertain.
Harry sighs.  All he wants is to go home and talk with Draco.  “We kinda guessed.  Thank you for saying something.”
for the rest of the day.
“This is going well.”  Draco comments, picking an invisible piece of lint off his jumper.  “If you’ll allow me?”
“This
“Just nevermind, Harry.”  Draco responds despondently covering his face with his hands.  Body tense.  “I apologize for bringing it up.”
The clinic is nearly empty when he arrives that evening after work for his last appointment with Draco.  It is one of the nights the children stay over at the Burrow during the week.  Harry has not seen Draco’s office in over a month, and it is the same as ever except for more lamps being turned on to light the room.
“Thanks.”  His boyfriend says as they lean in automatically to kiss hello.
Alternatively titled: Ron Says Sorry.  Another fluffy chapter before some more serious plot.  I hope you enjoy.  Again, I own nothing but plots.
“No.  I’ve done all I can there.”  He responds.  The case was being tried now.  It had been a headache from the start, but that was not the issue on Harry’s mind now.
“Why?”
“You are only staying a couple days, dear heart.”  Ginny reminds her patiently, tone even and kind.
“Not just him.”  Robards responds, shifting his gaze significantly to Harry.
Ginevra is white as a sheet where she kneels next to her son.  Holding his hand as Albus sputters and coughs.  Harry is loud as he encourages the boy to keep coughing – to breathe.  Audrey’s wand is a blur as she siphons water out of Albus’ mouth and runs through diagnostics.  He is dimly aware of recognizing some he uses in his own work.
“Hello, children.”  Mrs. Tonks welcomes them with a small nod.
“You know me.”  Harry responds sincerely with a shrug.  “You know the worst bits of me that people don’t like to acknowledge.  They like the hero.  They want the hero.  You want the person.  At least, I believe you do.  And,” He pauses here, taking Draco’s left arm carefully in his hand, turning it so the faded silver-grey dark mark can be seen.  Tracing his fingertips over it.  Draco is cool to the touch.  Harry’s hand feels hot in comparison.
“Is that what we’re calling it?”  Draco responds waspily, expression torn between amazement and disbelief.
“Oh!”  Ron voices loudly getting their attention, face transforming with an obvious idea as quickly as it falls.  “Oh.”  He repeats more quietly.
“We need to talk.”  He announces.
It had been maybe a year or two after the war while he was a trainee auror that’d he first heard mention of Malfoy’s apprenticeship.  Several spouses and teenaged children of death eaters, who’d had varying amounts of involvement in the war, had been on probation and/or house arrest at the time.  It wasn't so unusual to hear rumors here and there about them.
“Oh, yes.”  Pansy responds.  “He seemed quite keen on speaking with Blaise about a possible business expansion to Ireland.”
He’s always struggled at keeping a regular diet.  The last few years have been especially bad as his marriage ended.  Now he gets sent back to his flat with tins full of meals for the week.
“That sounds . . . homey.”  Harry decides on saying.  Honestly, the thought of spending twelve straight days with Lucius and Narcissa seemed anything but festive.  More like a punishment really.
He does not want to be a prude.  It irritates him that he reacts like this.  Sex was never discussed growing up and when it was it was couched in terms of marriage and having perfect, pure blood children.  He considers himself much more open to talking about sexuality now, but it has rarely been in the context of his relationships.  He was much better at talking about sex when it involved other people.  When his friends needed advice or a friendly ear.
He wakes some time later to giggling and the sensation of being poked in the face.  When he cracks an eye open, Lily is sitting on the pillow beside him and has her markers out spread across the bed.
He would be less thrilled by their frankness with Harry if he were not so full of excellent wine and food.  Merlin, he missed this place.  There was no better food any where else in the world so far as he was concerned.  Everything here was absolute magic.
Not unpleasant by any means.  Draco certainly is a fan of this act when he tops, but he always wondered what Harry liked so much about it.  Bottoming always seemed much more vulnerable to him.  He was afraid of it and any possible pain.  His hesitance greatly diminishes with his boyfriend’s careful movements and the reassuring hand stroking his side.
“I don’t want to be your friend.”  Harry bursts out.
“More or less.”  Severus states raising an eyebrow at him.  “I am not apprised of everything of course.  Not even the dead are
“Al.”  Jamie returns in equal measure.
“What can I do?”  He asks, desperation coloring his voice.
Harry gives him a small smile and nods, reaching out for him to pull him in by the belt loops of his trousers.  “Al told everyone at brunch the other day that he ‘has to knock on the door before going into Dad and Draco’s bedroom.’”
He knows it's not weird to find Draco looking so open and vulnerable attractive.  His skin not as perfect close up.  Draco had a small mole under the side of his chin and a thin scar at his hair line.  Harry loved each of them.  It made Draco look real.  The man was usually so put together and careful, but of all his boyfriend's physical traits, Draco’s eyes were his favorite.  Grey with flecks of silver streaked through, yellow in a thin line around the pupil.  He loved seeing Draco’s eyes as he was attentive at work especially now with his pupils blown.
Harry waggles his eyebrows in his most enticing manner, leaning upward.  Draco is laughing when their lips connect again.  Harry traces his tongue along the seam of Draco’s lips in supplication.  He is pleased when the man lets him in and the kiss is toe curling a second later.  He caresses Draco’s side, fingers headed for hem of his boyfriend’s jumper.  Skimming his fingers underneath.  Draco shifts and works at Harry’s belt.
There’s a silence.
“Why not?  I think we already are.”  He replies with a tilt of his head.  Harry selfishly hopes they are anyway.  People only wanted things from him now.  Sometimes it seemed like the only true friends he has are the ones he made at Hogwarts.  Everyone after that had at best become an ally.  Harry has grown used to the politics of the ministry where everything is give and take.  Being with Draco, spending time with him, feels new and old in the best ways.
He took the week off work for this.
“The ministry, your best friend, all that and more to come, yet you still want me.”
“What?  The park?”  Harry wonders aloud, tone confused.  Strands of his dark hair falling out of his hair tie as he cocks his head back, considering.  “I know we usually go to the other one.”
Always well dressed for any occasion.
James freezes.
Waiting.
“Well since you ask so nicely.”  Draco replies, finally removing his fingers and wiping them on the duvet.  Harry is so hard it is almost painful for Draco to look at, but the blissed-out expression on Harry’s face motivates him to keep things slow.  As much as Harry liked things fast and rough, he liked them slow too.
in the kitchen.”
“After I finished school and was earning more.  She’s been with me for the last three years or so.  I am lucky she chose to come here with me.”
to wait to give this to you, I might as well right now.”  He says, digging a hand into his coat pocket.  Harry pulls out a sleek-looking ring box, passing it over to Draco.
Afterward, they stood on the raised dais together.  Father and him.  Aurors surrounding them and unlocking his shackles just as they reattached the secondary chains to his father’s.  Mother crying softly off to the side.  Seventy-five years they gave Father.  A life sentence.  Draco stared at him.  Feeling no twinge of guilt.  His own testimony had hurt his father.  He knew that.  It was not meant to be cruel – only truthful.
His friend glares at Draco.  Harry is impressed that Draco holds his ground and keeps his hand in Harry’s.  He knows it is not easy to face all of Ron’s ire.  Ron could be imposing when he wanted.  “What did you
Harry Potter?!”
“He’s right.”  Harry cuts in once more.  Wanting to be clear and support his boyfriend.  “I don’t want to be minister of magic.  I might be head auror one day, that’s true, but I also may not.”  He probably would be though.  He knows this.  Based on what he has accomplished as an auror thus far, he is on the right track to be – and that is not even adding in defeating Riddle.
“You're welcome.”  Draco returns, shoving down the swooping feeling in his chest that Harry’s words give him.
“Fucking, Circe.”  Draco swears when Potter swirls his tongue.  Raw nerves lighting up.  It is not fair.  It is wonderful.  It is terrible.  Potter is holding him roughly.  One hand holding down his hips hard and mouth going at him to take in more, Draco would swear this man has no gag reflex.  He feels himself getting close.  Balls drawing up.  He wants to hold off.
“I will offer council!”  Hermione declares, standing again.
Lily shrugs her shoulders.  “I don’t know.”  She answers.  It’s honest.  Jamie will give her that and more importantly Dad seems to accept that excuse.  Lily wasn’t a very good liar yet and not good at keeping secrets.  She usually told the truth at some point when she tried.
There’s a quiet after that.  Jamie thinks he feels the same about Draco.  He knows more now.  It was usually better to know more.
Ginevra claps her hands once.  “That should work fine.”
It is actually quite nice.  Harry can even admit that after the first thirty minutes of the adults getting past the initial awkward mingling.  He is particularly proud of Hermione who is doing her best to engage Pansy politely.  He suspects Olta serving alcoholic beverages before dinner helps smooth things along.
“She’s a good mum.  My mother.”  Ginevra says mouth crooking slightly.  “But she doesn't understand me very well.  I think she believes the only way to be a good mother is to be there every day, taking care of your children – like she did.”
“Was it nice?”  Malfoy questions.
Jamie sighs.  Draco fixed it up so there’s no more stains on the walls and the furniture all matches with no scratches.  Draco is even making them eat dinner in there today too because
“Before becoming your test subject?”  He checks.
An hour later their potion sample is bottled and set aside to be judged by their professor.  Draco fills a second draft as back up.  It never hurt to be too careful.  His submissions had been tossed or accidentally spilled before.  He observes his lab partner do the same.  Obviously, he was not the only one here who planned ahead.
The peeling wallpaper remained in most of the rooms.  Faded birds and flowers weaving through the interwoven vines that papered the main corridors and foyer.  Lily’s little crayon drawings on the wallpaper, stubbornly too still for the birds flitting around them.  Kreacher maintained cleanliness, especially on the main floor, but bemoaned “Master Harry is
“And you didn’t think I would want to know that?”  Ron replies, staring over his wife’s head at Draco, giving him a dirty look.
“Children,” Mrs. Malfoy crisply begins refocusing Jamie’s attention on her as she stands, gliding forward and clasping her hands.  “My eyes may be failing me, but have you brought some manner of dog into my sitting room?”
“She’s pregnant.”
They share a look for a moment, openly studying the other.  Grey eyes impassively meeting green.  Malfoy’s brow slightly furrowing.  Harry, again, has the sense he is being assessed and realizes he doesn't know Malfoy all that well anymore.  It is discomfiting, if Harry’s honest.  An irascible, bigoted, arrogant Malfoy he understands.  But that version of him may not exist to the same degree any longer.  Harry’s last few experiences with Malfoy, years ago now, were heavily laced with the man’s despair and fear.  Harry’s instinct is the person who sits before him now is a significantly transformed man – and he has come to trust his instincts.
in London.
“I just haven’t gotten around to it.”  Harry argues, feeling his excuse is weaker than he would like.
“I am.”  Angelina challenges firmly.  “What was the point of the war if people can’t change and grow?  If we can’t make something good and new from all that pain?  Yes, Malfoy did awful things.  I don’t think anyone is denying that.  He was punished, right?  Arthur makes some good points.”
There was one dream he had hoped to be allowed.
“Oh, Ron.”  Harry responds, taken aback.  He thought it was rather obvious, but he supposes Ron has not been around them enough.  “Draco’s still shocked we’re together half the time.  He didn’t even believe me initially when I told him the kids thought we were already living together.”
The reaction of the room is varied.  Harry notes.  A handful of council members appear to startle, brows raising.  As if waking up to a sudden alarm buzzing.  Professional demeanors cracking for a moment.  It confirms to Harry that not all of them have read
“Is it enough?”  Harry questions, moving to his side and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Why all the secrecy?”  Luna questions them.  “This crup seems friendly enough.”
Everything is fine the rest of the day.  Better even because he and Al play catch with Maud in their room.  Throwing an old, stuffed quaffle back and forth from where they stand on their beds as the crup runs madly between them nabbing it occasionally.  It’s good fun for a long while, but then him and Al want to go outside.  It is sunny out and Jamie is itching to take his broom out and fly around like he was prevented from doing yesterday.
An attractive hostess approaches them and guides them up a curving staircase and past velvet ropes to the second level.  The VIP section he is informed.  There are obvious signs of magic here compared to below.  People with more obvious wizarding clothing apparent.  Swirling creatures in bottles of hard liquor behind the bar.  A woman sitting on a stool who is clearly a Veela and small groups of vampires here and there.  Sallow skin obvious even in the dimmer light.
It all boils down to this:
Draco feels himself crumble at Harry’s keen expression.  “I wouldn't say no to another token of your affection, but I always wear the watch you gave me.  It has quite a few protective charms on it already.  That’s not even including the cuff links I wear at formal events.”
It was long past due for me to write another Jamie chapter.  This is a quick one, but I was pleased to get Teddy in.  I've been wanting to work him in for a while now.  Thanks for reading!
There are black spots in his peripheral vision when he blinks his eyes.
Maybe.
“Well, Auror Potter,” Malfoy drawls, turning away and striding over to the desk.  Gesturing to one of the comfortable-looking chairs.  “Please sit, let us see if you are indeed appropriate for our experimental trial.”
Ron brings out the chess set and invites Draco to play as they settle in for conversation and drinks.  Harry and Hermione share a look of cautious optimism as the two men set the board and begin a game.  They enjoy comfortable conversation for some time.  Harry had hoped it could be like this.  He had no illusions that Ron and Draco would be best mates, but he appreciates that they are both trying.
“When is it?”  Ginevra asks, looking over the calendars on the desk.  “Is it the May tourney?”
Hermione gives him a sad smile and hands him a conciliatory slice of cake he takes two bites of before pushing away.
“She is absolutely to our taste.  Crups are delightful creatures with many wonderful traits.”  Luna returns sweetly.
“Where did you get this?”  He voices, trying it on.  Admiring how it looks on his finger.  The comfortable fit of it.  He was not really a ring person, but for this he will make an exception.
“You’re such an arse.”  Draco complains, attempting to push Harry off of him in his faux outrage.  Harry sees right through him.  Smirking.
A council is indeed present once they arrive.  Sitting behind a long, curved table before them.  Harry has seen some of them before.  None of which he knows personally.  Robards is here along with members of his own squad, sitting on the benches.  Expression irate and mouth in a thin line.  It is relieving to see Hermione standing before the council.  Composed and professional.
“I know some Unspeakables who might be interested.  Unless you have another idea?”
“What are you reading?”  James asks curiously, trying to look over Draco’s shoulder where he sits.
“They do.  Hopefully, all in one piece.”  Harry remarks.  Thinking of the beginning of the week.  His three sprogs all set with their little backpacks for a week-long stay with their mum.  He hugged and kissed them all goodbye as Ginny waited to take them into the cottage.  Directing them sternly to behave and listen to Mummy.  “Have you given any more thought about what I asked you the other day?”  He prompts his boyfriend.
Draco grabs his wand casting a protection spell and a lube spell, which he uses on his own erection.  It is truly a phenomenal sensation to sink into Harry.  Draco has topped maybe a dozen times at this point.  Harry coaxing him along and helping him get comfortable.  The first time they did this Draco was half terrified he would hurt his boyfriend.  Harry had only chuckled and reminded him of how slow they had gone.  Enjoying all the steps along the way touching each other.
“I am
“I did not sleep with Draco and then ask him about his experience during the war.  He was in his comfy pants.”
He does acquiesce to Harry’s request he no longer go to the manor alone.  It is silly but if it alleviates his boyfriend’s concern for now it is worth it.  The original spell in the foundation of the manor and the core itself is changed.  Draco’s magic is not his ancestors’.  It is more intentional and kind.  Lacking the heavy insistence on familial purity and preserving their line.  Instead, the purpose he left behind in the foundation is dedicated to protecting people and defending against dark magics.  Besides, there will be no more Malfoys after him.
“Thank you for telling us, Harry.”  Ron breaks the silence, leaning forward on his elbows.  The last time Harry heard such a genuine, sober tone from him was during those first few weeks when Harry was not sure if he was going to hack it as a single parent.  “I don’t really know what to tell you, mate, other than we support you.  Hermione?”
Unlike him, Harry does not hesitate, stepping purposely forward.  “James Sirius Potter!  You
It is Harry’s turn to question his friend then.  “What?”
Mrs. Malfoy furrows her brow at that.  “Well, wake him up.  It’s the middle of the day for Circe’s sake.  What is he doing napping?  He ought to be receiving his guests.”
“C’mon, sweetheart.”  Harry groans out, releasing Draco’s arse cheek with his other hand and tangling it in the man’s pale locks.  Bringing their mouths together.
“Uh-huh.”  Anthony responds intelligently.  Blearily opening his eyes and running a hand through his dirty blond hair.
“Please.”  Ginny draws the word out, giving him a hard look.  “I know you.  The year we got together you were stalking him all around Hogwarts.  You spent more time following him around than me.”
He sprints down the embankment to the creek.  Heart pounding in fear.  Focused on the little body partly covered by the rocks, water rushing over him.  There is a flash of silver in his periphery as Harry’s stag Patronus tears ahead of him.  Hooves loud on the ground.
“Am I not a Malfoy heir?”
The same holds true for a dozen or more of the children’s books in the library.  The ones Harry read aloud at bedtime hundreds of times.  It makes
“But what about Papa?”  Lily presses.
“That’s a thought.”  The man acknowledges.
“Yes, thank you.”  Draco answers voice polite and assured.  Surprising Harry, considering how Draco had reacted earlier.
Pansy titters.  “That is no way to speak to your first and only girlfriend, sir.”  She teases.
choose your animagus form.  No one gets to.  Not my father, Sirius, or Pettigrew.  No one.  This
“Ah, right.  There was this blinding light and like an earthquake, then we were able to get in.  One of the curse breakers got Mr. Malfoy out but he was in birdie form still.  He did
“So your story doesn’t count?”  He challenges, crossing his arms.  They have never addressed it directly like this but he finds himself unable to stop himself.  “You weren’t a victim too?  You were barely sixteen when they inducted you.  All other known death eaters were at least of age.  I know the pressure your father put on you in those days.  How much of a choice did you really have?”
“Lily!”  Harry reprimands, giving his daughter a sharp displeased look.  Lily appears unperturbed, shrugging.  It was a high compliment from his daughter to be like Princess Elsa.  She clearly felt she didn't do wrong.
"Due to the discrepancy between Weasley’s statement and the Potter and Granger statements and Mr. Malfoy’s criminal background, it was recommended by our auditor that Mr. Malfoy make his statement with an oversight hearing present to determine if there has been any subterfuge or unlawful access to Auror Potter’s case work.  We recommend Veritaserum to ensure total honesty and conclude the matter expediently.”
Moving to stand to his full height from his seat behind the desk, perhaps an inch or so taller than Harry, is Draco Malfoy.
Merlin, he loves Draco messy.  “I love you.”  Harry croons, leaning in once more to kiss him and resting his forehead against Draco’s.  Stroking at the man's back with his other hand.  “You make me feel so amazing, sweetheart.  Let me make you feel good.”
Harry scratches the back of his neck.  “Alright, when do you need me to take it by?”  If he has some time he can figure out where to store it.
“You want me tied up, sweetheart?”  Harry offers in a raspy voice.  Moving off Draco’s nipple with a hard kiss, after sucking it in by his teeth for a moment.  “I’ve got some nice rope just for you.”
“Are you close?”  Draco asks voice low.
“Thanks mum and dad.”  Harry comments sarcastically.  As much as their bantering entertains him, he really doesn't want to say more right now.
It does help.  Bless her.
“I’m wearing your shirt.”  Harry blurts out.
“Professor Dumbledore would have wanted me to.”
James runs off and Draco turns to Harry.  Concerned.  “Are you quite all right?”
“You two are a cute couple.”  Pansy interrupts him, starting to yawn as she moves to stand.  Anthony gets to his feet as well.  Patting down his sides, checking that his wallet and wand are still on him.  “Even if it is
“Shall we show your father?”
He considers flying to get an aerial view of the property.  He suspects he will see the damage done to the dungeons better from up high.  It is likely he will not repair those.  A loud crack from apparation occurs then, alerting him to the presence of another.
Brow furrowing and asking questions like he is going to be quizzed.  Harry even teaches him how to use muggle money – which is a whole endeavor in itself.  Thankfully, money isn’t an issue.  He probably would have just used his own, but Narcissa made certain he had private access to her vault.
“Sirius for sure.  My godfather.  I had him for so little, but definitely him.”
“That’s not what I meant.”  Mrs. Weasley denies exasperatedly.
“Daddy!  Draco!”  Lily yells, waving her arms at them like a windmill.
hid the remains of the dark mark on his forearm.  Now Draco has on a plain, light blue cotton tee and dark jogger sweatpants.  A bare foot tapping absently on the hardwood floor.  Drops of ink on the side of his boyfriend’s hand from where he was making notes in the margins.
“Yeah.”
“Oh.”  Draco utters, feeling embarrassed.  He had no idea.  “That is kind of her to say.”
“How was school for you today, James?”  Draco inquires as they queue up for the floo behind the other families.  Girding himself for the reaction.  It was important to him that he try initiating conversation with James.  Otherwise, Draco feared James would avoid him.  Even all these months later, the boy still seemed to keep Draco at arm’s length.
“She’s more attached to her father’s boyfriend than her own mother.  A man she met scarcely more than a year ago.”
“I don’t like being apart.”  Draco murmurs into his ear.  He can feel where the man’s fingers are pressed as if Harry might try to pry them away.
Ron stares uncomprehendingly at him.  Hermione’s mouth is pursed in the way that she does to suppress a frown.  He and Ron call it the Minerva McGonagall behind her back.  Draco gulps audibly beside him but maintains his composure.  Harry doubts the other two even heard.  Harry reaches out and takes Draco’s hand loosely in his own.  Giving him the option of breaking away if he wants.
“Well . . .”  He considers with a sigh, scratching at the back of his neck.  “I was trying to avoid that – for his sake.”
“I usually tell him if work was stressful or not that day.  Maybe a few broad descriptions of cases like if it is new or old or ongoing.  If I'm on call.  I don't get into specifics of cases otherwise.”
Harry sighs, picking up his cup of tea.  “A potential break in an investigation we're conducting up north.”  Harry responds after taking a drink.  But he shakes his head, as if to dislodge the thought of work and puts down his cup.  “I’m sorry about leaving.  We’ve never discussed you watching them alone before.”
When he is there, Harry keeps the other two occupied when they try to pop their heads in if they go over time.  Otherwise Olta generously keeps a watchful eye on them.  Lily is very concerned she is missing out on something fun whenever she sees the sand tray left out on his desk.
Draco pretends to be asleep.
“Professor McGonagall and I were in a conversation, boys.”  He calmly reprimands.  “Please apologize for interrupting.”
“I only wish I was there sooner.”  He replies.  It was nearly too late.  The thought of it will haunt him for some time.  Maud the crup had a lot of treats and toys in her immediate future.  He would make sure of it.
“No, you’re not.”  She bandies back.  Humor a little less sure this time, more defensive.
“In the matter of Mr. Malfoy compromising Auror Potter’s ability to maintain effectiveness and confidentiality as an auror, we find the case unfounded.  We appreciate everyone’s cooperation in this emergency oversight hearing.  The -
He feels the gentle kisses Potter is leaving intermittently on Draco’s hip first.  Draco realizes he is still fisting the man's hair.  He relaxes his hand immediately, and Potter glances up at him.  Smile slowly spreading as Draco prompts him up by the chin and Potter goes willingly to meet him.  Mouth wet from blowing him.  Their kiss is messy and goes on.  Draco’s never tasted himself before.  He eventually realizes Potter is jacking himself and reaches a hand down half-blindly to help his boyfriend.  Potter moans into the kiss when his hand joins in.  Draco feels more coordinated as they work together to pull him off.  Wondering at the feeling of Potter hard in his hand.  The differences between them.  His boyfriend tensing and coming a few moments later.  Spilling himself on both of them.  Draco watches Potter for a while where they lay next to each other.  Potter spread nakedly out before him breathing in deeply, eyes closed, and expression satisfied.
“It’s a hide-a-way room.”  Draco replies, face completely flushed now, eyes shifting away.  “VIP members have access.”
certain what my legal obligation is here.  I’ve looked into it a little since I returned, but I didn’t know if I would stay in Britain long and, then, well – you happened, so.”  Draco ends gesturing to Harry, face flushing.
Harry tries to be gentle.  Crawling forward once more on the bed as he kneels before the man observing his slow approach.  Framing Draco’s face in his hands.  His palms at the hinge of his boyfriend’s jaw.
Once, Draco used to sleep in and not be awakened by a child at the crack of dawn.  It does not happen every day, but often enough now that he half expects the sound of bare feet running over carpet floor.  Lily never really remembered to knock like the boys did.  Most of the time she fell asleep a moment or two after flopping onto the bed.  Happy to be with them and harder to wake by the time they actually got up.  This morning, Lily squirms in between him and Harry.  Throwing her little arms around his neck and kicking her father until he adjusts his hold.  Arms around them both to accommodate her.
It is fair play, Draco thinks, to work Harry open slowly.  The opposite of how it was earlier.  Besides, they are celebrating and torturing Harry this way is always pleasant.
“I wasn’t in that class after fifth year.”  Draco reminds, then looks at the rest of them.  “I was never very good at defense.”
It is a firework when he does come.  Spilling over on to Draco.  Cum splattering over the man’s torso.  His body still moving in response to Draco.  It is exhilarating.  The lamp beside him is flickering.  He realizes off-hand.  He did that sometimes.  Accidental magic.  Draco spasms and follows, adding to the mess.
It has been a long time since he was in Belgium.  Frankly, he never stayed long, usually it was a stop in between destinations.  One of the nice things about being outside of Britain is that if people do know him, it is primarily for his work.  Normally, only government officials glance at him twice once they hear his surname.  Whether that is because of his past or his family’s own degree of infamy he is never quite certain.
“I’m not sure.”  Draco returns quietly.  “Indulging a whim maybe?”
“Why not?”  Al inquires, tilting his head up at his father.
“I see that.”  Harry says, bending down in front of the baby.  “Hello, Aaron.”  His boyfriend singsongs to the baby, wiggling his fingers at him and pulling a face.  Draco pulls his own.  Thank goodness, none of Harry’s children are infants.  He doubts he would have the patience for them.
“We can.”  Draco agrees readily, turning his head.  He watches Harry run a shaky hand over his face.  Chest rising and falling until he evens out.  Circe, he loves this man.
He was only one human man.
He watches Draco walk away.  Enjoying the view as his boyfriend saunters over to his friends.
“Auror Potter.”  Narcissa acknowledges offering her hand again.  “Thank you for the invitation.  I hope you are well.”
More than likely Spinner or Hollingsworth were going to be part of a catch and release in order to smoke out other members in this criminal network.  Spinner was half pissed and irate, but this Hollingsworth bloke was deeply offended that no one seemed to know who he was.  Harry had a feeling they could use that to their advantage.
It works.  Draco tightens his hold, leaning forward further into Harry’s back.  “This was a good idea.”  His boyfriend shouts.
His mother still owned the cottage and her letters were typically addressed or forwarded there, but Jamie knew she didn't often stay in it because of her job.  He knew this because the only times his mum was there, he and his little brother and sister were usually with her.
The children’s primary school is its own special hell.  All the parents try not to stare and look amongst each other when he passes.  Draco ignores the snippets of whispers he overhears.  He can tell it bothers Harry from the way the man's eyes narrow slightly as if his boyfriend might glare them all into submission.  Draco imagines Harry attracted a fair amount of attention before just from being who he is, but now they stop people mid-conversation.
He feels Draco’s fingers tugging lightly at the hair at the base of his head.  Harry watches as a small smile tugs at Draco’s mouth.  It is a little forlorn but endearing.
He watches Draco take a long drink of wine, Adam’s apple bobbing, as he drains his glass.  Then running a distracted hand through his hair before setting his glass down on the counter and turning his back to Harry.  Mirror letting Harry observe his boyfriend’s face.  Expression composed despite his ruffled hair.  Messy the way Harry loves best.  His shoulders moving minutely under his shirt as Harry’s eyes wander down the man’s back.   Following the lines of the waistcoat tapered to compliment Draco’s slim hips.  He permits himself to begin soaking in the moment.  The heavy sensation that is creeping into his bound limbs.  How keen that makes other parts of him.
“Parkinson.”  Harry greets tersely.  He has not spoken to her in several years.  He had been hoping for a few more.  The last time was in court during a hearing where she represented the Prophet.  He was not a fan.  Parkinson’s heavy lipstick and darkly shadowed eyes made her look older in his opinion.  Her face was still a bit puggish but even he had to admit her hair bob framed her face in a flattering way.
His friend raises a questioning eyebrow at him.  “Okay?”  She repeats.
They furnish the whole place during the course of the week.  Harry does actually end up renting a truck then and helping Malfoy purchase furniture.
“Thank you.”  She tells Draco earnestly.  “Telling us in person was the best way.”
“Rope burns?”  He finally manages to ask, voice raspy.  Body still throbbing in a very pleasant way.  Merlin, he wishes he could bottle this feeling.  The afterglow.  He should suggest that to Draco.  He could do it if anyone.  Draco prods at him, checking to see if he’s okay while Harry replays his boyfriend’s sex voice in his head.
“High maintenance.”  Harry accuses, but it is teasing.  His boyfriend connects their lips again, slipping his tongue inside.  Draco's toes curl in his shoes, shutting his eyes at the same time.  Harry is a good kisser.  A fact his boyfriend never failed to use against him – many times.
Ron shakes his head, baffled.  “And what are those?”
“I should really get you something too.”  Draco voices.  His gifts to Harry tended to be pragmatic, but perhaps it is time he gets him something more sentimental.  “You’ve given me all this – what did James call that necklace of Pansy’s the other week?”
“In an official capacity?”  Harry questions, feeling his stomach sink.  The ministry made Draco uncomfortable.  More than that, really.  If he was summoned again Harry was afraid of the outcome.  The oversight hearing had already done a number on his boyfriend.
“Well, I saw a pod of them once while I was on the coast of Egypt.  The merpeople I was working with kept tame ones but these roamed free.  Beautiful, strong creatures.  You’d love them, Albus.  They’re herbivores.  Eating all the seaweed and kelp one could ever want.”
missed the side effect of nausea from traveling by portkey.
“And what evidence is that, councilwoman?”  Hermione asks in clipped tone.
“I am sorry if it's caused you any trouble.”  Draco apologizes.  He feels badly her name has been drawn in again.  She has only met Harry the once after all.
“Why?”  Lily questions, expression confused, and brow furrowing.  Dad sighs defeatedly.
He had promised her to introduce his boyfriend to them tonight.
“You see, Harry?”  Draco murmurs as if he just read Harry’s thoughts on the matter.  “How could I put you and the children through that?  What right do I have?”
The sky is grey when he is levitated from the wreckage.  Feathers sticky with blood.  He may have healed some in this form, but the severity of his injuries would persist.  If there was one thing he was certain of, being able to transform into a phoenix did
Malfoy sleeps in for a long while that first morning.
“I don’t really know how to say it so I just will.”  Harry says steeling himself.  “I’ve started seeing someone the last few weeks.”
Indeed, Harry is irascible the rest of the day.  The children even take note and give their father a wide berth.  Taking care to behave and not try his patience.  Toward the end of their night, once they are alone in the master suite, Harry begins starting several sentences and not finishing them.
Astoria turns to his boyfriend, looking up at him, and grinning.  “Harry, thank you for allowing us to intrude on your holiday.  It's so good to see the two of you.”
That was all before Draco Malfoy.  The man that made Harry want to re-structure his entire life to include a partner.
“This is an engagement ring, right?  Protective rings usually are.”
Jamie frowns, thinking that over.  “I want a wand real bad.”
“How was your date yesterday?”  Hermione inquires slyly while dipping a roll in her container of soy sauce.  “Ron said you were awfully cheery when you showed up at the Burrow to pick up the children.”
“It was good.”  Jamie responds, swatting at his dad’s hand in his hair.  “Dad, why did Draco come eat with us?”
Things are confusing for some time after that.  He has the vague notion of going in and out of consciousness.  The impression that Harry is nearby each time he wakes stays with him keeping him calm.  Albeit, he is only awake for a few seconds each time.  The paneled ceiling of wherever he is has water stains.  The smell of cleaning solution filling the air.
Her mad, dark eyes are boring into him.  Dilated from the darkness.  An intense aura of hatred and revulsion directed entirely at him.  Her dark, curly hair twisted into all directions.  The wisps of it touching his face.  Skin a greyish pale, reminding him of a corpse.
(See the end of the chapter for
The woman takes his hand.  Shaking it as her face lights up.  “Oh, of course, you are.  I am supposed to meet you then.  I am Simone Pelatier.  I’m the co-owner of this club.”  She introduces herself earnestly.
“But it’s a façade, isn’t it?”  The man rumbles making him shiver.  Already
The screaming ceases immediately and the energy changes.  He tiredly watches as the purple and orange sparks he saw earlier swirl around the case – silver he sees now – regaining balance as the sickly green fades away.  The booms continue above him and the smell of smoke begins to seep in to where he is laid down here.
In retrospect, tapping Malfoy on the shoulder and waking him out of a deep sleep without attempting to call his name first was not the most tactful move.  He is thrown back with a solid smack to his nose and sternum, catching himself on his heel, and pivoting as Malfoy gets to his feet in a flash.  Automatically striking out as Harry dodges to the side.
Besides, Anthony gets along well with everyone and watching little Aaron toddle determinedly around the back patio until he hits the magical barrier his parents erected for him is amusing.  Babies were usually perturbed by such restrictions and Aaron is no exception.  Expression betrayed each time he falls to his rump and flaps his hand at the open seeming space that let everyone else out into the backyard.  Causing the area to glow different colors forming the little baby-gate that it was.
Harry sighs.  That is the question he's wrestled with more than any other for some time.  “It is.”  He agrees.  Regardless of what happens, he liked having Draco just to himself, even if it is unrealistic.  “Hermione?”
to know about potions before they enter their first year of secondary magical education?”
Or maybe Malfoy hasn't changed all that much.
“You’ll be okay.”  He tries to soothe.  Whether for him or James or both, he does not know.  He finally pockets his wand.  Realizing he is soaked and pats the boy’s head.  “Albus is safe now.  You are safe.”  He comforts, voice raspy.
Draco takes a steadying breath.  “Weasley, for the life of me I do not know if this would have gone any better some other way, but I do apologize for the distress I have caused you here tonight.”
He is glad to be an attendee and not a presenter though he has prepared questions for the Q&A portion at the end of a few lectures.  He has been to many potion conferences over the years.  All have been educational and at times provided useful networking opportunities.
to help.  Al’s brought his canvas bag out for their adventuring.  His brother was the sort to try and plan ahead which could be useful at times.  Al’s got his tri-scopes out peering through them searching the ground around the pitch.  Lenses rearranging to adjust the zoom.  The scopes were meant for fans trying to find the snitch at quidditch games, but Jamie figured it would work for their purposes today.
“But?”  Harry prods.  Re-establishing their eye contact.
“I am.”  Draco responds immediately.  It is their stupid inside joke.  Draco loves it.  “How did you sleep?”
His children were his priority first along with his responsibility to make a safer more just world for them.  The idea of adding someone else into that mix – exposing them to the intense scrutiny of his friends or the media was daunting.  And he had no idea how his children would react to him bringing round another person to take his attention away from them.
“And what is the nature of your relationship?”
It does bother Jamie though.  He thinks about it during maths when he's supposed to be doing his algebra.  He likes algebra.  It is the only thing he’s good at besides gym and free period.  He doesn’t have to read for it if he doesn’t want.
“Nothing that you need to know about now, Jamie.”  Dad intervenes putting a hand up and stopping Draco.  “Do you remember the story I told you about the boy who changed by making choices to help people?”
“I’m not frowning.”  He objects though he does adjust his expression.  It was just that Pansy could be so irritating.
Draco sighs, “It has been sealed for over a decade.  The Purgo charm they placed would have cleansed anything actively pestiferous -
“Not my tri-scopes.”  Al grouses, trying to right himself.  “Mum said to take care of them.”
Potter’s hands are hot where they slide Draco's robes off and begin work on the buttons of his shirt.  Pulling Draco gently to his bed.  How is it possible he can have this?  To be allowed to touch?  Potter breaks away, yanking off his shirt and unbuttoning his trousers.  Draco watches him amused, a smirk growing on his face at Potter’s exuberance.  It is contagious and before he can think on it further, he is down to his own tented pants and unbuttoned shirt.  Potter is just naked.
James will hate it.
“But what about Ginevra?”
It is cold, he can feel that through his gloves as the wind whips past them, but he is not cold.  His back, for one, is pleasantly warm.  All of him pressed against Draco is.  Harry has yet to see the entirety of the estate.  They fly in a circuitous route over the acreage, past the creek abutting the grounds to the main house.  It is beautiful even he can grant that.  When he first came here months ago the place was little more than neglected ruins.  Draco has done wonders to it.  Hard work evident in manicured lawns and landscaping.
He waits as the line moves quickly.  He gets checked by security and walks into the wide-open marble foyer, staircases descending at its focal point.  Heading to the tall arched doorway to the ballroom space he is most familiar with occupying in the past.  He notes exits and points of entry as he goes.  It's habit anymore.  Nodding and offering hellos as wizards and witches he knows from the ministry greet him.  Glad the press is limited here tonight.  There have been three journalists he has seen so far.
“Did you have something you wanted to tell me?”  Draco redirects, bemused.  James was a frank boy.  He was like his father that way.
perform his check up on the days they were scheduled to meet.
If he had to guess why his insomnia was worse at his home, it would be the fact he is usually alone there.  He has always slept better knowing other people are around.  It never made much sense to him.  He supposes it's from the war.  Keeping watch or something like that.
“That man is gorgeous.”  Pansy tells the group, expression agog.  “Does Astoria know?  Weren’t they an
“Is that all you have to say for yourself, Mr. Malfoy?”  Kingsley asks in his deep voice, causing Malfoy to look up.  Startled.
“You ladies’ man, you.”  He jokes.
Harry liked her too.  Olta was off today, but when she was here with them, she enjoyed watching Harry work in the kitchen.  Thought it funny.  The house elf had confided in him she had never seen a wizard cook – let alone want to do it.  He seasons the chicken and sets the cast iron skillet on the stove to heat before he sears it.
"Je ne peux pas m’en empêcher. Il est canon. Je suis contente pour vous.” - I cannot help myself. He's hot. I am happy for you.
Draco sniffs audibly, holding himself stiffly.  “I . . . I think you should find somewhere else to sleep tonight.”
“That seems wise.”  Ron says.  “When are we gonna meet him?”
Thing is he’s lonely.
“Boss!”  Doge shouts for him as Harry makes his way through bull pen in the auror department.  “Robards wants to see you.”
“Professor Snape would have a decidedly different opinion I’d venture.”
Draco bites his lip, disappointed in himself for losing his temper. He makes a fist at his side but then releases it. Father is as unmoved as he was when he was first brought in. Grey eyes once again observing Draco.  No emotion in them.
“That’s what we named her.”  Al shares glancing bashfully around at the adults.
Fucking, Merlin.
He stops snoring, cracking open an eye.  “Happy birthday.”  He congratulates.  Earning himself a cheeky grin from the girl.  The one that reminds him of Harry.
The Golden Trio goes to a charity event.
“I suppose it depends on when you start counting.”  Luna begins thoughtfully, tilting her head in consideration.  “Rolf and I have been friends for years.  Of course, we’re colleagues too.  We’ve travelled around the world together meeting and learning about so many creatures.  It’s been marvelous really, better than I could have dreamed – and I’ve dreamt a lot.  I have a great deal of affection for him, but I’ve only very recently realized there is romantic love between us.”
“But you chose not to amputate anything at all to remove the shards?”
This feels sorta like Dad talking to him or one of his uncles.  Maybe he's getting used to Draco?  Either way he's glad Draco answered his question.  It sounded like the most honest thing the man has ever told him.
“Classic blood curse from artefact transmodification - a likely candidate for your research - I believe.”  Hargreeves pauses, raising his hand to his chin again ponderingly, looking ponderously at Harry with a hint of one just remembering something.  “Oh, Potter, this is Draco Malfoy.  He's one of our new researchers here – a great addition to our team.  Draco, this is Auror Potter.”
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand.  His boyfriend looks over to him.  Harry knows how hard he is trying.  For both of them.  They knew it would be some version of this.  He just hopes Draco can withstand it.
more into Spinner’s side-dealings than we originally thought.”  Shepard reports.  He had spent the last three months as lead on this case, going undercover to infiltrate Spinner’s crew, and was eager to shut them down.
Harry catches Draco’s questioning expression, suddenly feeling much better than he had.  “No,” He replies slowly, “I haven’t.”
Potter sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose.  “Leave us, now, Kreacher.”  He orders.
Despite his initial protests, Draco agrees to join.  Bundled in his winter coat, gloves, and scarf.  Prepared for the elements.  Harry thinks he looks attractive.  Pink splotches high on his cheekbones from the cold.  Harry would be lying if he denied getting Draco on the bike with him was not a fantasy of his.  It was maybe the second thing he thought of when he brought it to the manor.
“Really?”  His boyfriend responds in a strange tone.  Body tensing.  Harry imagines in astonishment.
It goes on like that the rest of the day.  Asking a series of questions as they come to Malfoy’s mind then nothing.  No commentary.  No conversation.  Silent staring then.  Guarded.  Malfoy thoroughly investigates the place.  Going through everything over and over.  Opening and closing doors.  Poking at the few items already here and watching over Harry’s shoulder as he makes them a quick dinner of bacon sandwiches.  Picking up the spatula and tongs and looking them over as if they were the most fantastic things.  They eat their dinner in mostly silence with the ceiling light flickering above them.  He promises Malfoy to work on that tomorrow.
“Like me?”  Draco echoes with a sinking feeling.
“How’d you know that?”  Al asks as Maud finally manages to escape his arms.  Running excitedly over to Luna and Rolf.   Front paws coming to rest on Luna’s dress and tail wagging.
“Oh yes, the last three days have been incredibly sexually invigorating since Rolf confessed his feelings.”  Luna states simply.
is interesting.”  She says, tone wondering and her expression thoughtful.  “What did she ask for in return?”
“Smart wizard like you, seems to me you’d find a way around that.”  Harry teases, causing Malfoy’s slight smile, little more than the corner of his mouth lifting.
“No.”  Harry draws the word out teasingly, pulling Draco in closer from where his arm is wrapped around his boyfriend's shoulders.  They’re lying in bed at his boyfriend’s flat.  Naked and tangled together still which makes Harry ache from the intimacy of it.  “How could I ever tease you?”  He jokes pressing a light kiss to the bridge of his boyfriend’s nose.
“I was absolutely going to tell you next.”  Draco tells her.  It is even true.  She was next on his list.  “I swear to you not even Greg knew.  Only our crowd in France were aware and that was mostly because they were far away.  Out of sight, and somewhat out of mind.”
“Al?”  Dad says accusingly, switching gears.  Turning on the heat.  Jamie thinks Al doesn’t have to worry.  Al puts up a good front but –
“None of us are who we were back then.”  Angelina remarks, melodic voice soothing.  Ebony-colored face serious as she pauses, looking at her husband.  “If Audrey and Harry like him, that’s enough for me to give Malfoy another chance.  I trust them both.”
“Am too!”  Lily argues pouting her lower lip out and looking affronted.  “Daddy takes me on secret ice cream trips and I never tell!”
Harry sighs, breathing hard through his nose.  Frowning.  This was the one question he was dreading, and he had to answer it.  No matter his personal feelings.  “We are dating.”  He states.
“She knows about us
“Apparently a birthday party for our daughter
It’s still strange for him to wake up at the manor.  He’s briefly confused about where he is until the smell of freshly baked bread wafts over him.  They eat each meal in a different room.  Don’t ask him why.  Mrs. Malfoy said once, but he wasn’t really listening.  The morning meal is in the family common space which is easy enough to find since it’s outside where their bedrooms are.
Jamie and Al have their hair combed.  Draco got it into his head this morning that the boys needed to be well groomed today.  A bottle of Sleakeazy’s was produced from thin air and the boys corralled into the loo.  Jamie even tucked in his button up under his jumper.  Harry suspects bribery.  A lot of bribery.  Both boys politely greet Narcissa before being excused to go play, Lily bouncing after them.
“I don’t care what the papers say, Hermione.”  Harry grouses stubbornly.  Draco can almost picture him with his surly expression and crossed arms.
“Can I work on that in physio?” He asks thinking of the additional exercises he put his right half through to even out the distribution of his strength and flexibility in both legs.  As he had been promoted through the ranks to more sedentary work, managing this old injury along with aging were becoming re-occurring obstacles.  He had a field exam to pass in a month and was not ready for the aurors under his command see him put out to pasture quite yet.  He wanted to at least reach fifty first.
“Focus, people.”  The sergeant interjects.  “We’ve got hit wizards waiting for us.
A lot of our family has been called that too.  Most of the Weasleys.”
It is a mad dash through the manor then.  Quickly scouring the family quarters and expanding past them to the rest of the second floor before descending in horrible defeat to the main one.  Keeping an ear out all the while for adults, house elves, and portraits who might be shouting in astonished dismay at the sight of a crup running loose in the manor.  Thankfully, most of the portraits they pass are asleep, but a few utter greetings and question their hurried behavior.
“Molly said he talked late.”  Harry quietly informs him one night in the comfortable silence while they are relaxing on their bed.  Quilt pooling around their legs and propped upright by the overstuffed pillows Draco preferred.  Fireplace lit in the room over, chasing away the cold in the master suite.  It was the beginning of December after all.
He is too.  He would much rather have his leg be sore from a night of fun or a successful mission than to wake up and it just be hurting.  Besides, if he plays his cards right Draco will give him a nice rub down with the fire salamander salve that completely eases his tense muscles.  The ointment was finally on the market now and part of his pain management routine.
“Oh.”  Audrey squeaks surprised to have the attention suddenly on her, blushing bright red.  She tended to be shy by nature.  Harry occasionally felt pity for her as the Weasley family was full of strong personalities and that could be overwhelming.
Draco goes to sit beside him.  “I won’t – this time.”  He teases.
Healer Hargreeves, a half-blood wizard with eyebrows very nearly as bushy as his mustache and always wearing disheveled robes and button up, was somewhat renowned for his work with curse related injuries.  The older man had prior experience heading a department at St. Mungos with expertise in splinching.  The second war had led him to go underground for some time.  Secretly treating muggles, muggleborns, and half-bloods alike as well as creature folk.  Since founding his clinic after the war, the Mercury Medical Clinic & Research Center was operating in tandem with a private muggle pharmacy located in London.
“I can leave?”
“My hero.”  Draco states blandly.
No one had ever asked him that directly.  He had worked diligently to bury that part of himself once he realized.  Hoping to keep
“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”  Draco sputters as he washes his face in the sink.  Harry is in his robe, hands in his pockets.  Openly laughing now.
“Harsh.”  Harry says, then lowers his voice.  “You look stunning tonight.  That would only help your cause I think.”  Draco’s ears go pink.  He is already a bit red in the face from drinking, but Harry can tell he is flustered by the compliment.  It will never stop astonishing him how Draco reacts to praise these days.
“Potter, your face.”  Draco comments, smile growing as his laughter gentles into a chuckle.  “Don’t make that face, you bloody fool.”  The man remarks raising his hands to smooth out Harry’s tense expression.   His eyelids fluttering at the feeling of Draco’s cool fingertips brushing over, leaving warmth behind them.
“You never asked.”  Draco tells him with a slight shrug of a shoulder.  “I have depths.”
There are people moving around quickly.  He is dimly aware that he is not in the way.  Audrey is moving quickly.  Time stutters around him in a manner he has not experienced in ages.  Distant and all too painfully present at once making him feel as if he is dizzily spinning.
“You’ve the prettiest cock.”
“You two need to shag.”  Ron says in a rush with a put-upon expression.  His face going bright red to match his hair.
And speaking of Potter’s body.  Draco knows Potter is fit – Circe, he has eyes for goodness sake.  However, it is quite another thing to have it pressing into him.  The reassuring weight and strength of it.  Draco is suddenly very appreciative of the auror training regime.  He can feel his own body flushing in response.  It is a bit overwhelming.  His hands wander down to Potter’s shoulder and a bicep.  Enjoying the firmness he finds there.
“How serious is it?”  She asks after a while, breaking the quiet.
“Did you ever meet my mum?”  Teddy asks hopefully.  Jamie feels bad for Teddy sometimes.  He doesn’t remember his parents.  Teddy was a baby when they died.  He just had his godfather and grandmother.
“The flutter-what?”  He tries repeating, baffled.
“You overwhelm me.”  Draco whispers, resting his cool hand over Harry’s heart.  “I never thought I’d like that so much.”  He states sounding sad.
“In a way, yeah, the tours are part of why I’m curious.”  He allows, thankful for the segue.  “But we were talking today at a meeting about how the death eaters operated at the beginning of each war.  How they initially got their start.  What we – the ministry – learned about how they organized themselves and any other people who may have learned from them too.  The connections that knowledge has to current dark magic users.”
The other man presses a kiss into Draco’s temple.  Smiling like a loon.  “That’s right, sweetheart.”  His boyfriend croons in a rough voice.  “This is why it’s good.  You just tell me how fast you want it.”
Hopefully, he can salvage what progress he has made with James.
who applies to their mastery programs.  Then promptly tearing those students apart with the most grueling coursework and research standards.  Maybe ten student apprentices graduated each mastery course from that great institution in a year.  Each with the certain knowledge that they had a world-class education and would most likely join the upper echelons of celebrated magical practitioners and academics.  The most hopeful – the most prodigious talents applied their efforts there.  Arriving in Paris from all over the world.  The Académie depended upon its onerous reputation to initially weed out would-be applicants.
“Oh right, this is Ephraim Doge.”  Harry introduces, gesturing to each of them for his boyfriend. “And Amanda Clearwater and Cleo Talbot.  They're aurors in my squad.  You might have heard the sprogs talking about Clearwater.  She’s babysat for me before.  You lot seem to know Draco.”
Miss Periwinkle was Al’s teacher, and this was not the first time Harry had been asked.  He rather thought Al asked him at odd times to try to startle a yes out of him.  Al’s primary motivation for proposing the marriage was to have more access to his teacher’s collection of video games that she kept on hand for their class.  His son had become particularly interested in the game that taught beginners charms while practicing with a toy wand.  Al had also asked his Uncle Charlie and their neighbor to marry his teacher with no success.
Ron nods, seeming solemn.  Draco returns to their group.  Steps light.  When Harry takes his hand, it is clammy feeling in his own.  At least, Draco does not pull away from him this time.
Draco guffaws.  “They are all fairly self-sufficient . . . and potty trained - thank Circe.”  His boyfriend replies.
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.”  Harry assures as he stands, zipping up his trousers, and leaning over to kiss Draco before striding out the door at a brisk pace.
Malfoy hums, considering.  “High risk of splinching in the limb, then.  Sensitivity to temperature change.  Five bone and tendon transfiguration implants, causing more damage to the joint sites reaching up to the right side of the pelvis.”  Malfoy notes to himself as he reads the small scroll emitting from the measuring tape.  “Any impotency?”
“Yes, thanks.”  Draco responds huskily, trying to keep his hips still.  “Keep going.”  He orders.
“Respectfully,” Hermione interrupts, standing with her palms flat on the table surface, in full Wizengamot mode.  “Mr. Malfoy has been a private, law-abiding citizen since the successful completion of his probation in 1999.  I wonder if he has been made aware of his rights vis a vis answering the questions of this inquisitorial committee or given the option of accepting any possible charges and moving this to a formal court of law.”
“Well, Slytherin was not the hub of sexual discovery that Gryffindor and Ravenclaw obviously were.”  Pansy states with a smirk.  “
“I know you planned on being here a week, but aren’t people wondering where you are?”  Malfoy begins partway through their quiet dinner.  “Your family maybe?”  The man suggests with a slight shrug of one shoulder.
McGonagall considers them both.  “I imagine not.”  She speaks expression not unlike the Draco himself garnered earlier.
“Oi, Potter!”
“I hoped you would.”  Draco whispers back.  Smile small evident on his face.  Clearly pleased.  “I wasn’t sure.”
He's nothing in the looks department tonight compared to Draco though.  His boyfriend is hot like fire.  White, blond hair tousled back.  Lean frame dressed in tight, dark denims and a deep forest green, silk button up and open jacket that shows off his long neck.  The watch inlaid with protection charms Harry gave him at his wrist.
“Do you really think I would let the Notts know about my dating Harry Potter before you?”
“No.”  He answers.  Unfortunately, it made sense that he hadn’t seen them.  If the memory didn’t pertain to a crime, then it was discarded as evidence.
Easy peasy.
Draco's hard work does not stop Harry from squirreling away some beloved items his boyfriend thought he evicted.  Several Gryffindor relics from his time at Hogwarts survive the purge.  He stores them safely in the steamer trunk he keeps in the attic.  The one he knows Draco will leave be along with another storage container that holds some of his few remaining items from childhood.
Harry sighs, shoulders sagging.  Sensing a headache beginning to build.
He isn’t very good at it.  Malfoy will definitely need a proper cut at some point, but he is able to take several inches off so that it rests, curling slightly at the man’s shoulders.  He feels odd doing this for him.  Vulnerable in a weird way.  Especially when Malfoy’s lips thin and the man closes his eyes when Harry takes his wand out to make the cuts.  He cannot deny though, the shorter hair looks much healthier.  Softer and clean from the shower as he takes the comb from Malfoy and tries to make the ends even-ish.
“Keep yours over on that side.”  Draco demands, pushing his own sliced vegetables neatly off the cutting board.  They land in an orderly fashion on the other side of the chicken.
“We didn’t exactly get the Daily Prophet.”  Malfoy rejoins with a small smile.  “But you’re
Thanks for reading.  I appreciate all comments and kudos.  They encourage me and remind me this story doesn't just exist in my saved docs.  As always, I own nothing but plots.
He really does not know how to respond to her pronouncement.  Fun?  He was alive despite everything.  Despite all his sins.  Does he get to have fun?
“You wouldn’t be with one then.  Cause they’re bad.”  Al ventures looking and sounding unsure.  “Draco can’t be a death eater then.”
Astoria shakes her head, where it is glowing in the fireplace.  “Don't worry about me.  I will be fine.  This is far from my first foray into the spotlight after all.  If anything, it should be good for business.”
“Ooh, that Hermione Granger.”  Pansy says testily.  “I may not be working as a lawyer at present, but I am always available to my friends.”
He watches as the milk and sugar waddle over offering themselves up to his service.  It is the first magic he has seen since arriving.  Greg was living mostly muggle these days.  His letters over the years painted a picture of a man who was grateful to find acceptance somewhere.  Most of Greg’s relations were dead now and the reparations had nearly bankrupted the Goyle family.  An older brother had control of the family estate, but Greg had not returned to the fold.  Instead finding his place kneading bread of all things.
“What about them?”  Astoria challenges, giving him a droll expression.  “I promise you they have their own lives to focus on.”
Draco has a besotted expression when Harry looks up.  All messy pale blonde hair and sweet smile.  “I love you too.”  The man returns softly, lifting a hand to cradle the hinge of Harry’s jaw, prompting him to turn slightly and kiss Draco’s palm.
Pansy is the lone parent there he voluntarily speaks to on any given day.  Not that the others are clamoring to converse.  Today, Pansy has the pram with baby Aaron, sat inside, looking doubtfully out at the world with his dark eyes.  Cheeks chubby and shaking his balled-up fist at passerby.  He rather reminds Draco of Pansy’s father in that way.
Bloody fuck.
does not just happen.”
“You, Potter.”  Robards replies blandly as he leans against his desk, cup of coffee in hand.  “I haven’t been informed who filed it yet or the evidence – the DMLE got the original complaint.  But they claim you’ve been compromised by Draco Malfoy.  I’m guessing the news in the Prophet the other day of your family’s association with Malfoy led to it.”
“Lest the bloodlines fail.”  Draco intones, donning a mock condescending tone that reminds Harry eerily of Lucius.  Hell, it probably was something Lucius had told Draco.
“I know.”  Luna replies softly, smile kind.  “We don’t always get what we want, James Potter, but it is better to be straightforward when we ask.  Hiding a crup in a tearoom will not help your cause.”
"Does that sound mad?”  Draco questions, coming back and shooting him a look.
chose!”  His boyfriend yells, hand suddenly fisting his own hair as if to contain himself.  Knuckles white as his entire body twists forward as if trying to suppress a great weight that’s fallen.  Face aggrieved and pale.  “Not you!”  He cries.
For one, he has updated the buildings with taller arched doors and more serviceable spaces for storing the tools needed to maintain whatever animals he accumulates.  The construction materials are the same stone debris, transfigured and molded together.  Formed anew.  He does not leave them the foreboding slate grey.  Instead he added the pale granite and limestone from the rubble of the ancient, stone outer walls in fortifying the outer courtyard and buildings.
“You’re important to me.”
Jamie grimaces but marches forward.  Draco steps to the side and goes to sit on the big chair Dad usually favored.  Leaning back to rock them.  Lily’s red, sweaty face peeks over Draco’s shoulder.  She wipes her nose on Draco’s shirt and begins to hiccup.  Draco
“Maybe we should.”  Harry presses.  “Talk about it more I mean.”
“No,” Albus argues, yawn overtaking him despite his best efforts.  Obviously fading fast. “I’m wide awake.  You haven’t even told me a bedtime story.”
come to me.”  Ginevra answers testily.
Lunch today consisted of sushi.  A favorite of theirs.  Ron wasn't a fan so they ate it when they could.  Usually in one of their offices for their weekly lunch meeting to catch each other up on any immediate concerns within the ministry.
Harry imagines that Draco has enjoyed many spectacular views flying about, but it is special to have his boyfriend to himself like this, driving along the road.  The large main gates opening like they should.  Draco has adjusted the outer wards for them.  Harry has full access.  It is utterly bizarre if he reflects on it.  Who could have thought the two of them would end up like this?
Lucius squints at him.  “You have a question.”  Father remarks with surety, reminding Draco uncomfortably of his own approach in a recent conversation with James when the boy misbehaved.  “Do you need advice?  I’m afraid my knowledge of current events is rather limited but perhaps something else?”
“I was in Paris once, but I’ve never been to Seoul.”  Harry adds conversationally.  There was a list of places he wanted to visit.  He'd been able to cross a few off while joining Ginny on international tournaments.  They usually did not have much time to sight see though.
Thank Merlin.  That is a relief.  “This isn't too casual.  We do not need to do anything formal.  I am very casual.”  He assures quickly.  He hopes Potter knows that he enjoys their meetups in places like the park or pubs.  There is something so real about it.  This is nothing like what he imagined dating was like when he was young.  It is so much better.
Harry chuckles, feeling entirely himself here with Draco.  It's nice, lovely even.
Harry face palms so quickly he feels the smack to his forehead before he remembers moving.  Draco is chuckling beside him and when he lowers his hand, he enjoys the up-close view of his boyfriend’s delight.  Expression open and grey eyes pleased making Harry’s heart flutter.  He chances a glance at Narcissa who luckily also seems amused based on the quirk of her mouth and raised eyebrow.  Andromeda is laughing outright next to her.
It's been two days since he's seen his daughter.  Harry waves eagerly back at her as they continue the gradual walk down.  There was something so nice about being greeted enthusiastically by a child.  Their love unrestrained.
The boys knew every speck of ground between the cottage and the Burrow.  Albus was probably already at his mother’s home.  Safe and sound.
“Are you okay?”  Draco asks, beginning to get concerned.
“Least our cocks weren’t out.”  He cracks with a grin.
“I think I heard him.”  Harry’s voice carries.
“Oh, hello, James Potter.”  Luna greets blithely once she spots him.  Her lime green dress flounces as she draws closer.  A gentle smile blooms on her face as she ducks to speak to him through the ajar door.  “I was just remembering you and your siblings might be about.  Have you been enjoying the flutterflips here?  There appears to be a small colony outside.”  She asks him conversationally, expression inquisitive.
four weeks out of the year, Gin.  The weekends you get them don’t count toward that.  You have to figure another week out.”  He prods.
“I really hoped we’d find a creature or treasure at this point.”  Al laments with a sigh, plopping down beside him.  “Maybe the not-gnome-niffler got sad it didn’t find any treasure either?”
“Until dad gets back, I guess.”  He replies.  It’s something he thought a lot about last night before he fell asleep.  She can’t dig holes
their parent.  James is very clear on that point and . . . I know Lily gets confused.”
“He better be treating you right.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry watches Draco’s expression close off slightly.  He is aware there was a lot of pressure on Draco at one point to consent to an arranged marriage and have a child.
Now, though -
He had been around gay men occasionally throughout his life, but never exposed to their relationships and lifestyle in such an open manner.  Charlie hadn't even brought home a boyfriend at that point.  Harry remembers lying wide-awake one of the nights they were there.  Jamie swaddled and fast asleep in a dresser drawer they transfigured into a bassinet and them on a futon bed.  Staring at the ceiling and feeling very confused.  Unsure about saying anything to his wife.  Bisexuality wasn't even a word in his vocabulary then.
“Make yourself at home then, Potter.”  Draco comments drolly, rolling up the parchment with a tap of his wand and directing them to arrange themselves in an orderly fashion on the available table beside his desk.
“Is this okay?”  Potter checks breaking their kiss to ask before moving to kiss Draco behind his ear.  Hands grasping him more tightly before relaxing their grip in a soothing motion.  Leaving him shuddering in their wake.
Bill Weasley advised the charm might help take control of the place.  He told Harry he had seen it work wonders on wizarding homes where the family was feuding over ownership and they had cursed the other out of the property.  But the manor was much larger and older than in those cases.  Also, Draco did not want Bill involved.  Harry was trying to honor that but figured it didn't hurt to ask Bill and forget to mention his source of information.
“Malfoy.”  Ron states, glancing suspiciously between Harry and Draco.  “Long time no see.  I thought you had skulked off for good.  Why didn’t you stay away?”
Draco raises a questioning eyebrow at that.  “We do have some if you need it.”
He has the distinct sense Harry is trying to be alluring.
He catches himself in the mirror one morning as he's shaving, Jamie and Al at his side brushing their teeth, and realizes it has been nearly three months.  The experiment will be over soon, and he will no longer be seeing Draco.  All their lunches, their walks, their talks.  Joking and laughing with Draco and his small, barely there smiles.
“Oh?”  Draco acknowledges, abandoning the report he was reading.
had a row.
“I guess I shouldn’t assume.”  Harry says tone neutral.  “Do you love them?”
Harry extends his hand and Jamie produces a crumpled note from under his jumper.  Draco wonders if the boy had been trying to figure a way to keep it from his father.  It would be impossible based on the charm placed on it.  The envelop flutters like a small bird until Harry opens it.  It would have gotten more and more rambunctious the longer James took to deliver it to Harry.  His boyfriend’s mouth quirks while reading it.  Lines forming on his forehead.  He hands it over wordlessly to Draco when finished.  Expression impassive.
Harry is aghast.  “Absolutely not.”  He denies automatically.
Ron was right – partly.
“Am I in trouble?”  James asks once Draco finishes reading the letter, sounding worried.  Hands fidgeting with the hem of his jumper.
Harry goes over to the stove and turns the meat over, returning with the cast-iron skillet to place on the island.  “Put them all in.”  He instructs, dropping his in to cover the side closest to him and the chicken.
“So . . . for you – bisexual?”
“You may not be accepted, Draco.”  Father warns suddenly serious.
“That’s true.  An impressive feat indeed for students.”
Draco does his shoulder twitch that Harry believes is the closest thing Draco gets to doing something as uncouth as a shrug.  “Mother mostly.”  His boyfriend shares.
“I’m sure you’re wondering why I gathered you here today.”  Dad begins with an air of authority.  Jamie imagines this is how he is at work, but probably in trousers then and not the sweatpants he likes to wear at home.
The room is silent for a heavy moment.  Jamie frowns.
“What can it hurt?  Malfoy’s been deemed
“Intentions, you know,” Ron gestures vaguely.  “What’s his plan, uh, with you?”
It is a learning experience for both of them.  Draco can readily admit that he was not half so patient as he once believed he was.  Potion ingredients did not argue back.  But James acquiesces more and more over time.  Getting straight to his work.  They practice separating words into smaller bits for him to read aloud together and physically spelling them in the sand.  Every day they do this for a minimum of an hour after school.
“That’s okay.”  Anthony says easily, going over to sit by his wife, and bounce the baby on his knee.  “He’s a pretty easy-going little chap.  We brought some toys in the nappy bag anyways.  Pansy always has the bag packed for anything he needs.”
“No, what happened next at the manor?”
He sleeps well at the cottage.
A stark contrast to how he was raised.  All his childhood and adolescence were spent rigidly removed from muggles.  When he visited France as a boy he was relegated to the family’s villa where his parents controlled who came and went.  It was not until he arrived in Paris with Astoria years ago, that he began to interact with muggles on a daily basis.
“You have something to tell me.”  Draco voices quietly.  It’s a statement.
“Muggles can’t see them.”
“No.”
“Why are you so obsessed with him?!”  Ginny accuses hotly.  “You can’t stop thinking about him even now?!”
“James!”
“Besides, Audrey likes him too, don’t you dear?”  The older man adds.  “You mentioned once when the Malfoys came up in conversation.”
“I don’t get jealous when people fall all over you.”  He reasons.  Harry could be very jealous.  At first, Draco found it charming, but it has worn its appeal over time.  Particularly after the incident at Eeylops Owl Emporium with the clerk who was just trying to sell him some organic food pellets.
“She didn’t.”  Harry denies raising an innocent hand.  It’s been months since he’s seen Luna.  The last he saw her she was setting out on a trip to Malaysia with a team of magizoologists.  “It was a guess on my part – truly.  So, how long?”
“No, James.”  Draco vetoes easily.  “You heard your father.”
“I didn’t expect this, you know.”  Draco starts, not quite sure how to say what is on his mind.
“Here?!”
The moment is electric.  A spark of magic between two separate forces filling him with energy.  Harry knows what it is to love someone.  What he didn't understand is how different it is to love someone both so new and known to him.  Draco met him in a way he never thought possible.
“I know.  I’ve been through them.”  He admits, suddenly feeling abashed.  He's never admitted that to him.  Although, in fairness, he’d gone through that stuff years ago.  Long before his romantic relationship with Draco.  “But they don’t show anything about what your daily life was like or your own personal relationships with other death eaters or their families.”
“Very well.”  Narcissa concedes, clasping her hands in front of her.
Jamie hangs back then.  Watching.
“I want to ascertain our defense now, before we get caught unawares by another oversight hearing.  Do you really think Draco being an unregistered animagus will go undetected?  That is illegal last I checked.”
“That’s not the point.”
Draco turns back to the scene before him, stepping forward to examine everything.  It is simple enough to determine that she has been successfully locked away.  The woman in the portrait must be Walburga Black.  The great-aunt he met as an infant.  He erred in his initial judgement that this portrait was not a dark object.
“Okay, but your furniture is
“Yes, professor.”  Harry concedes, subdued.  He shares a dubious glance with Ron and pretends to begin taking notes again.  His head is just not in it today and Hermione will let him copy her notes later anyways.
“Which is?”  Harry prompts, unable to help himself.  He is curious too.  Astoria’s opinion carries a lot of weight with Draco.
“How long have you been in a relationship with Auror Potter?”.
“Truly?”  He cannot help but ask.  He doubts that very much, but he must take her word for it.  Certainly, Professor McGonagall would know better than him.  She usually did.
“Are you going to continue to stare or are you going to finish dicing?”
, Potter.”
Ron’s eyes shift between them.  Face suddenly apprehensive and sighing deeply.  “Don’t make me say it.”
“Has he forgotten about you?  All alone down here?  I thought all your relatives went to the Spires.  Auntie haunted that place for
Draco sighs.  “Jurgen was just being attentive, Harry.  It’s his job.”
when he was young.  Merlin knows Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory had been proof enough of that.  He elects to suppress that line of thinking before it goes further.
awareness of the house.
The majority of Weasley adults, George Weasley’s son, and James.
Draco huffs, blowing the strands from his own hair out of the way.  But he does listen.  Focusing on breathing through his nose down to his diaphragm.  It is not like he can retort.  Harry is the expert here.
McGonagall looks at him discerningly then.  He supposes all old hands at teaching must have a similar expression.  His pride vanishes in an instant leaving him on tenterhooks.  While he has never felt the press of her mind, he has occasionally wondered if she was trained in some legilimency.
“You're not real.”  He chokes out, struggling for air, and mustering his courage.  Ripping himself away from her grip and heaving as he attempts to right himself.  Staggering.  Tendrils from her black robes wrapping themselves around him.  Bellatrix shifts and twists grotesquely, body rippling to become a dark mass that rapidly encompasses the room.  Oppressing his movement in a never-ending darkness thick as fog that presses heavy on his chest.
Harry shifts awkwardly in his seat.  Smile polite and forced.  Trying to think of another topic of conversation.  Anything.  “Draco tells me you’re thinking of selling your place in Edinburgh?”  He throws out.  Which seems to work as both Malfoys pause to consider him.
“Here we go.”  Harry barbs back.  Going for the dramatic.
Draco shudders.  It is Rosier.  One of the young death eaters Bellatrix trained along with him during the last year.  Teaching them how to be
When he eventually returns to the manor – days later than he’d like – on the day of the big dinner, he enters the manor undetected.  There is a stone archway built into the east side of the manor he makes a quiet entrance through with the help of his invisibility cloak.  Built for the inhabitants more surreptitious comings and goings.  Draco said the place used to be full of them.  His boyfriend restored a few and made a couple of his own.  It is nice to avoid the main entrance.  He spied a group of people exiting when he arrived and was glad to miss interacting with them.
Teddy nods.  Hair turning from its natural brown to a vibrant green indicating he was thinking.  “He did bad things a long time ago – Draco did.”
,” He presses through rolling his eyes.  “Do I bother you with how often I visit?”
When he turns the corner, he finds the boys tugging at a heavy looking wall hanging that is frayed at the edges.  James seems to have ripped the corner nearly in two and is doing further damage if the sound of tearing fabric holds true.
to want.  Not work or
“I don’t know, Harry.  Percy is on my side of the table.  I think he would prefer me to hand it over.  Given we are on
Ginny gives him an awkward grin, lifting her shoulders.  “Now?”  She says, drawing out the word.
Harry snorts, amused.  “Sure.  But you know, you could use a credit or debit card?  Then you wouldn’t have to mess about with any of that.” He suggests, half-joking.  If you'd asked him ten years ago if he would happily spend his lunch break bantering with Malfoy on the finer points of financial transactions in Europe, Harry would have laughed his arse off and told them they had gone mad.
“Malfoy . . . kind?”  George states skeptically.  Expression incredulous.  “Never mind all he’s done to this family, then.”
– when you very nearly killed me once!  I wonder if you’ve ever apologized to my brother Bill for scaring him for life?  Or my other relatives?  You do know your people killed one of my brothers – do my parents get an apology?!  Apparently, you’ve apologized to my wife, but one never came my way.  I’m not good enough for that am I?  Are blood traitors worse than muggleborns?  I can’t remember now how your twisted mind works.  So you will excuse me if I don’t roll out the welcome mat.”
“That was the only occasion.”
After the movie finishes, Harry leaves to make them some lunch.  Leaving the two of them alone with three sleeping children.  Draco has already exhausted topics of conversation between them.  The three topics being James, Albus, and Lily.  He is contemplating asking after her work when she clears her throat.  Getting his attention.
Harry laughs.  Oh, well.  "Never mind that, tell me more about our trip."
“Which is not a bad thing.”  Draco reminds quietly.  “I imagine you are a big part of the ideals they have.”
“So bloody tight.  Fuck.”  Harry moans.  His fingers tightening where they touch.
Hello and thanks for reading!  All your comments and kudos are very appreciated.  This one ended up being a smidgen more angsty than originally intended, but there's loads of fluff too.  If you're not interested in the smutty bit, skip the third part.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall greets with a slight nod of her head.  He had dallied rather more than he ought to before approaching her this evening.  The last he had seen her in person was the day of the battle.  She was very inch the bulwark of a headmistress Hogwarts needed.  He has every confidence she continues to be.
It is not a shock to listen to Lucius spin a tale painting himself as a victim at worst and an unwitting accomplice at best, but it is a shock to hear Malfoy refuse to go along with his father’s version of events during the course of his statement.  Instead, admitting his guilt.  Eyes flitting up once or twice to glance at his judges before falling back to the floor.  Voice halting and clearly unused to speaking anymore.
“Simone?”  He hears Draco’s voice.  He watches his boyfriend approach, squeezing through the crowd.  Simone and Draco embrace.  Kissing each other’s cheeks.  “You met Harry.  Did he put his foot in his mouth?  I apologize if he did.  He is really quite nice.”
Draco gives Teddy a small, sad smile.  “No, I wish I did.  I’ve heard lovely things about her.  I did know your father though.”
“I do.”  Draco allows, biting at the bottom corner of his lip like he did when he was scared to admit something that made him nervous.  “If I ought to have said it earlier, I am sorry for that.  I love you – much more than I know how to say.”
There have been several times in his life that he has felt like a rotten partner.  This is the first time it’s happened with Draco.  It hurts in a different way.  Now, he hurts because he failed to protect Draco from himself – his worst impulses.  The curious, digging instinct to solve every mystery, every problem, without fully considering how he is impacting his loved ones.
He can’t help but chuckle at that.  “Yeah.”
The trainee looks guiltily up at him.  “It was in the break room.”
“Photo clippings?”  Draco echoes uncertainly, turning again to Harry with a question in his eyes.
Twysley looks over to Harry.  That's his cue.  Harry steps to the podium.  “We have reason to believe Spinner is only one branch in a criminal enterprise.  If we can get him today, he may be able to lead us to the person pulling the strings.”
“We wondered – your father and I – if you had broken it purposefully because of our relationship.”
He knows Draco appreciates the exercise.  That the man jogs a couple times during the week to stay in shape.   Harry mostly likes it because it allows him to surveil the perimeter of the village without any fuss.  Some people’s faces are beginning to become familiar to him.  A few older women even wave in greeting at Draco as they pass with his jogging partner nodding in return.
Dad huffs a light laugh at that, waving a hand to turn off the bedside lamp.  “I do.  I like him very much.”
Harry forces himself to remain relaxed, taking a deep breath.  He has not the faintest clue about the supposed compromising photo.  That will have to wait for now.  But, he and Ron had yet to reconcile.  It had been nearly two months since the argument at the Burrow.  They had attempted a dinner, mediated by Hermione, but that had fallen apart at the end as well.  It was the longest they had ever been in a row.  Harry missed his friend and felt guilty about the position they had put Hermione in once again.  As if they were boys bickering back at Hogwarts.  But he wants to be with Draco.  Feels surer about that every day.
“Oh.  I – well – I suppose I can stay.”  Draco agrees hesitantly.  He has never been left solely in charge of a child or even children before, but he thinks he can handle it.  He knows these children and their routine fairly well.  They seem used to him at any rate.
a possibility.”  Hermione hedges beside them, brow furrowing.  “But that also sounds like a lot of guesswork.  There is no real indication Draco has that information or that speaking with him will be helpful to this investigation.  I know we’re frustrated, but are we pulling at loose straws?”
No.  No.  No.
“You didn't do anything wrong.”  Draco consoles taking Harry’s hand in a loose grip.  He had wondered if something was on Harry’s mind.  It was not uncommon for his boyfriend to share his most personal concerns when they were alone at the end of the day.
“Daddy, don’t bother Papa.  Now is not the time.”  Lily advises, hands clasped primly in front of her where she sits on the carpet in front of Draco.
Jamie rolls his eyes.  Lily will just set her milk near the edge again.  She always did.  Draco should just use a charm to keep it from spilling like Dad does.
Draco stares at him aghast.
“On your side for now.”  Draco directs, getting out the lube in the side table.  He wants Harry comfortable.  His boyfriend complies, lying sideways with his hands behind him.
They were allowed to say goodbye.  Mother kissing Father on his cheek.  Hallowed in and pallid.  Wildly different from the handsome face of his youth.  Draco knew he fared little better.  Father gave him a hard look.  Grey eyes so like his own flinty and relentless.
“It’s kinda like that, but with pureblood wizards and witches thinking they’re better than muggles or muggleborns or even halfbloods.”
The whole household’s schedule changes due to this.  Draco becomes the primary pickup person at school when the bell rings.  Lily already in hand as they wait with Pansy.  The children still stay at their grandparents’ home at least once a week after school on Ron Weasley’s day off, but Draco usually gathers them from the Burrow earlier now too.  He maintains more consistent work hours than Harry after all.  It seems practical to collect the children himself.  One less trip for Harry to make before coming home.
He doubts Mother wrote Father describing the way Draco had suddenly exploded in their small sitting room as she made wedding plans without a thought to his wants.  Antique vase on the mantle shattering as the result of his unchecked anger.  Yelling that he would
“What?”  Harry and Ron say at the same time.  Confused.
He took it for a test flight earlier.  He is reasonably certain that the bike is going to take flight again.  It is fortunate when they manage to clear the grove of trees on part of the estate, flying past the Malfoy cemetery tucked inside them.
“So he changed.”  Jamie states.  Beginning to feel a little more positively toward the boy.
“That was a very different circumstance.”  He defends.  A situation he was right about too he might add, but now was not the time to point that out.
been missing being close to his boyfriend.  Getting more agitated and bent out of shape.
“Draco used to be a death eater.”  Teddy whispers.  “That’s the name of the group of dark wizards who killed my parents and your grandparents.  Gran told me about Draco when she heard he lives with Harry now.  She said he turned sides at the end, but he was one before.  A death eater.  He was there during the final battle.”
He at least has confidence in her.  Weasley was good with the children too if he is honest.
Draco is almost comically wide-eyed by the time Harry enters their suite.  Half-dressed in his pajamas, haphazardly attempting to put his arm through the sleeve of his shirt as he reads from a sheaf of paper in his hand.  Normally neat hair disheveled like he’s been running his hands through it.  The whole scene makes Harry grin.  He loved messy Draco.
“You broke it.”  Ginny cuts in precisely.
Draco frowns.  “You’re what?”
Malfoy is usually quick to rein his expression back.  It took a few times for Harry to notice.  The small smile doesn't stay for more than it takes to blink.  There is still a level of uncertainty in the camaraderie between them.  For his part, Harry has the sense that Malfoy is a bit lonely and willing to put up with Harry’s needling.
are the one who is sweet.”  He responds.  Especially considering the hand job.  But Harry doesn’t say that out loud.  It's not the time.
Harry’s definitely feeling relaxed.  Posture open and smile genuine.  On anyone else it would seem contrived, but on Harry it is the most natural thing.  If their eyes catch more than once during their soiree and Draco gets a bit distracted . . . well, he supposes he can blame that on the wine and congratulations that leave him buoyant and not at all because of their recent reconciliation.  Still, he must shake his head at himself.  He is a grown man for Circe’s sake.
“This is a date, yes?”  Draco checks abruptly.  He wants to be certain here.  Their last evening together at the pub was emotionally charged and they spent most of it looking shyly at each other still holding hands under their table.  Potter fiddling with the base of his glass.  Stupid grin on his face.
Harry wants to put hands on him.
that.”  The half-harpy man responds, expression incredulous.  “I am as capable as you, yet me and my fellow creature folk are spurned by much of wizarding society simply because of our parentage.  Our magical abilities considered lesser.  I do not apologize for my presence - for my mother being a valkyrie.  Not to
“Oi, mate.  Well done.”  Draco imitates in turn, trying to recall what Potter said about the last quidditch game they discussed.  “Got right in there, you did.”
“I – thank you.”  He stutters.  He was used to defending his relationship with Harry.  Only a few of his friends – Astoria and Simone – were consistently supportive of them.  “I love him.”  He adds without thought and flushes.  He was such a sop.  It was awful.
“You said there was someone once, but she died.”  He answers, shaking his head and immediately regretting that choice.
Jamie hangs his head morosely.  Waiting for Dad to give him his punishment.  He isn’t allowed to use a wand until he gets his own.  He knows that, but wands
They smile at each other for a moment.  It is pleasant.  Unexpectedly so.  He did not anticipate them getting on this well.
A councilwoman near the center of the table and answers.  “We were formed at the recommendation of our auditor due to the statements and evidence gathered.”
He and Harry walk the sidewalk perimeter around the playground, stopping here and there to watch the children.  Muggles are interspersed throughout in their own couples and families.  Young people sitting on the public benches with their cellular phones out.  It occurs to him how peaceful all this is.  A perfect autumn day.  Fountains gently trickling in the background and children playing in front of them.  Harry’s warm hand in his own.  This could be some version of the rest of his life if he permits himself to continue to walk this path.
“He asked me the same thing.”
“I suppose.”  His boyfriend concedes taking Harry’s hand in his own.  Slotting their fingers together.  Harry wiggles his own in response.  Bringing their hands up to kiss Draco’s knuckles.  Enjoying the spots of pink that bloom even now on his boyfriend’s face at the action.
“I don’t know.”  Harry replies, scratching at the back of his neck.  His PR person would probably thank him if he did, but public statements invited public interest in his personal life.  He and Draco were lucky to be flying under the radar as it was.  “What do you think I should do?”
The curse breakers had done it.  It was even reported in the Prophet during his trial like that would somehow be a slap in the face.  They were helping them really.  The dark lord and his followers – not to mention his own father – had left numerous unpleasant artefacts and dark magics behind.  Elements for future weaponry.  Sealing it would significantly reduce the strength if not the purpose of those spells.
“Your son has dyslexia.”
Draco frowns, following the craggy path down toward the river that separates the estate from their acres of barren farmland and forest.  Where the voice emanated.  There had been a bridge at the end of the path when he was a boy.  He and Greg used to play on it as boys pretending to hunt for trolls.  It is swept away now.  A natural end to this portion of the property and where he senses the present weakened ward line.
“That is what you asked me next.”  He tells Draco patiently like he did all those years ago.  Resignedly.  “What was her name?”
“Thank you.  I had an excellent teacher.”  He acknowledges feeling proud as he catches Pansy rolling her eyes at him behind their old professor’s shoulder as she trots by.  He can practically hear her sarcastic tone mocking him for his delight in the praise.  The cow.
“It’s a good thing you’re with Harry then.”  Teddy says.  “He’s the best at defense.”
Harry gets the motorbike to run the first day there is a light snow beginning to stick to the ground.  Half the snowflakes disappear the second they touch pavement.  He rides it through the courtyard and works his way toward the front of the manor.  Listening to the pleasant rumble of the engine.  It's not ideal weather for a ride but the sense of satisfaction that he was able to repair the bike is worth every moment.
Draco sighs, throwing this morning’s edition of the Prophet on his coffee table.  It had not been his day – yesterday.  It is foolish to be upset really.  He is not angry with Astoria of course.  He does not even care about the photo of her and Harry.  Arm and arm, each dressed immaculately for the charity gala.  They
His own pictures as a child were more dignified and respectful in their frames.  A favorite of his mother’s was one of the two of them sat, holding hands when he was little more than a toddler.
The two men glare at each other.
The day is not a total wash.  He and Harry take the children to the park after dinner to burn off some steam.  They do not often get out publicly and the children run straight for the playground equipment.  Typically, they are either at his flat or Grimmauld with or without the children.  He and Harry are still somewhat private about their relationship.  By the sounds of things, when Harry does take the children out and about on his own, it is his preference to go to muggle locales to avoid curious wizarding eyes.
He is not quite certain what exactly to say to help James, but he can guarantee they need to discuss this based on the child’s reaction.  Unfortunately, James’ outburst has caught the attention of most people in the backyard interrupting the party.  He catches a glimpse of Harry making his way to them.
“Did Bixby discover what was digging on the grounds?”  Mrs. Malfoy questions suddenly partway through breakfast.  Jamie forces himself to act natural, but Al freezes for a second beside him.  He hopes neither adult notices.
Harry does as asked and sits in the chair provided as Malfoy opens his chart and begins to read it.  Taking advantage of the time to observe further the man before him.  Malfoy is dressed neatly in the silver trimmed white robes the medical staff at the clinic wore.  Looking more orderly than Hargreeves.  A well-made dark blue waistcoat covering a paler blue button-up underneath.
Everything is aglow from the cobbled streets of this part of London to the shops around them open late into the evening.  Burlesque it's called.  The club.
Mrs. Malfoy is obviously not thrilled when they walk into the big posh sitting room with a crup closely following him.  Jamie can tell right away.  He probably could’ve guessed.  She didn’t seem like the sort of lady who would like that.
Jamie and Al shenanigans.
Hermione gives him a reassuring smile and nod.
“Under who’s purview?"  Granger demands.  "Because he certainly isn't listed on the public one.”
A blown-up photograph flies over to their table.  Floating in front of Draco for him to examine.
“This is a different story.”  Dad corrects, scooching himself on the bed so he is resting against the headboard by Jamie.  “This one is about a wizarding boy.  He was told he was perfect every day.  That all the other people in the world who were different from him and his family were terrible.  He believed it too, for a long, long time.  And because he believed that, the boy was cruel to everyone he thought was imperfect.  He didn't care about their feelings even when they told him it was hurting them.”
He has no problem with this.  If anything, he gets on swimmingly with Hermione.  He and Weasley have also come a long way and maintain a standing friendly chess rivalry.  However, there is a special quality to being around one’s best friends.  It is akin to coming home after a being away for a while.
It was little more than a perfunctory business transaction by the time the papers were actually signed.  They had been living apart for nearly a year.  Lily was a toddler by then.  The boys were already in nursery school.  He's not sure the boys even noticed much of a change for a long while.  Ginny was gone most of the time anyway.  It felt like he did most of his co-parenting with Molly if he was honest.  Sometimes it still did.
“Well,” Al draws out the words, twiddling his fingers on his backpack straps like he did when he got nervous and scuffing his shoe on the floor.  “Gabby said her grandmother called Draco a ‘blood traitor’ at dinner and her mummy got real upset.  But neither of us knows what that means.  I mean that old portrait yelled that at Draco once.”
It was something father had never even done.
“I-I thought you’d be angry.”  Draco says appearing taken aback, shoulders hunching slightly.  “Furious because it’s
Uncle Ron and Granddad share a look.  Granddad shrugs and goes back to sipping his drink.  His uncle considers Jamie further.  “During the last two wizarding wars any pureblood wizard – like most of the Weasleys were – got called blood traitor for making friends with muggles and muggleborns.”
Albus and James are down to their skivvies by the time Draco returns to the master bath from putting Lily down to sleep after she passed out from her allotment of potion.  He finds the boys literally scratching each other’s backs while Harry is filling the large tub with an oatmeal concoction similarly down to his pants.  Draco is fairly certain Harry has gone quite mad, but he is also aware that oats can be soothing to the skin.  It never occurred to him to bathe in them.
“I want to be partners.”  Draco decides.  “But I also want it to be permanent too - whatever happens.  I'm not certain if those two ideals can work together?  Or if I should even say that considering this is our first official date.”
Harry tenses.  “He is.  It’s – we're just starting that.”
Ginevra smiles kindly.  “It's obvious Harry feels the same way.  My children love you too, you know.  I don’t want to freak you out too much, but I think we’re going to be in each other’s lives for a long time.  I’m looking forward to it.”
“Don’t care.”  Draco growls, righting himself by straddling Harry and unbuttoning the fronts of his clothes.  Expression intent.  Nimble fingers making quick work of it as he moves to Harry’s own.
“More people should.”  Astoria remarks, watching him and relaxing her hold.  “It is an admirable trait: adaptation.  Changing for the better.  I am going to sound terribly sexist, but I have not known many men who can – change that is.  At least not to the degree he has.”
“Greg,” Draco states slowly, unsure.  “If you don’t want children you need to tell her.”
He always liked Krum, but he will never think of him the same again.  Instead he will always get flashes of Draco and Pansy at fourteen playing make believe.  Wishing they were kissing someone else.  It is an unpleasant image.
“Thank you one and all for coming this year.”  Hargreeves opens, pleasantly gruff as usual.  The grand room and balcony fill with applause for a minute.  It is a good crowd, Harry thinks.  They are well sloshed.  “As many of you know this is our eighth year hosting this event.  Every year we at the Mercury Medical Clinic & Research Center focus on a specific research aim to raise money for.  This year we have the pleasure of partnering with the Magical Trans Alliance in this effort.”
“The famous Astoria Greengrass.”  Harry remarks.  Draco’s best friend and former fiancé.  She owned a restaurant and two clubs in France.  Harry knew she was rather a socialite over there – and he imagined here to some extent.  Astoria worked hard to get where she is as an entrepreneur.  Every time Draco talked of her Harry was reminded more than a bit of Sirius.  Another pureblood who rejected their parents’ values and lived life on their own terms.  Typically by partying.  Harry had known of her vaguely at Hogwarts as a mousy, petite brunette in the year behind them.  Her sister, Daphne, was in their year in Slytherin.
“His children and myself.”
They’re allowed to go as far as the bridge that leads to the fields and the forest beyond the manor.  Everything else is mostly fenced in or cut off by tall, dense hedges that lead to craggy rock.  Now that it’s warmer, he and Al have hiked over most of it, but they haven’t seen everything.  The pitch is a way out by foot.  Bixby is already there of course, in his snappy uniform, synchronizing shovels to pat down the sod from the small mound of dirt brought in by wheelbarrow.  It looks like something has pockmarked the earth, clods of dirt everywhere.
” Potter says mischievously.  “I’d like you to call me Harry.”
Al nods sagely like this is expected.  “Our Uncle Charlie has a boyfriend.  His name’s Laszlo.  He can breathe fire.  Can you breathe fire?”
The silence that fills the chamber is eerie.  Malfoy spoke for so long.  The man’s voice creaking every few words.  Horrible in all its truth.  It was as if a large-scale spell was cast upon them.  No one speaks for a full two minutes.  The energy in the room held together by a thread of tension.
“I’m sorry, Molly."  He starts, a bit abashed.  "I shouldn’t have come today.  Ron and I are still in a row and I hoped we could get past it.”  He takes a deep breath, pushing in his chair.  Gripping the back of it.  Making his decision to comment on Ron’s earlier insinuation.
“Do you miss your old friends?”
He regrets not saying anything before.  It never seemed like the right time.  When the three of them were together over the last few months most of their conversations revolved around schedules, kids, or the ministry.
“’Course not.  You know wizards and witches are no better or worse than muggles.”  His uncle advises him.  “Some stuffy pureblood wizards thought they were too good for them.  It all came down to bigotry.  They call other purebloods blood traitors when they treat muggles and muggleborns equal to them.  You remember when we talked about racism?”
Pansy seems a bit mollified at that.  “She helped you though - from what you’re telling me.”
“Severus, why are you here?”  He adds.  This figure is coherent, not the wretched attempt at his aunt earlier.  He may be able to get answers from him.  “I'm trapped in the manor.  Father warned me the manor's foundational magic was malfunctioning, but I was unable to disrupt the curse long enough after I entered.  I need to access the core.”
Draco frowns.  “Silly things really.  You must understand how much of my life was planned out for me by my parents.  Father didn’t want me doing anything that wasn’t educational or strictly masculine.  Mother . . . permitted me more.  For instance, when I was small, she let me play with her scarves and jewelry.  Or joined me for tea parties I hosted in the garden with my toy brooms I trussed up as guests.”
Draco is shaking, his hands fumbling at Harry’s shirt with a look of concentration on his face.  Biting at his lower lip.  Harry helps him.  Undoing his belt and opening the front of his trousers, sitting on the square lounge.  Draco goes to his knees between the vee of Harry’s legs, pulling out Harry’s cock.  Hands sure.  Gorgeous and eager to please.
“Of what?”  He voices, confused, tilting his head toward her where they sit on the stone bench tucked into the corner of the Greengrass’ sprawling garden.  A perfect miniature of what used to be on the Malfoy estate.
The two men share a look.  It is one of their silent conversations.  Draco knows his expression is exasperated but Harry gives him such an abused face in return.  Lower lip slightly pouted in a near perfect impression of Albus’ wounded crup eyes.
The last lecture he attends is his ‘for fun’ choice.  He tries to allocate time for one at every conference.  Astoria and Harry would poke fun if they knew.  This one is particularly stimulating as it is the first talk he has attended that focuses on teaching potions.  Ever since he became more involved in the children’s education – particularly James’ – he has pondered how to begin introducing the building blocks of potion theory.  It seems to him that other magical subjects are given ample attention in their curriculum in comparison.  He can understand why – in a way.  The combination of mathematics and multitude ingredient interactions is perhaps more than most teachers want to tackle with their primary school pupils, but he will persist.  It is best practice to start early with potions.
?!  About my
Draco is restless following the conversation with his mother.  Fidgety in a way that is not typical of him as he changes into his pajamas.  Harry figures it is the stress of the holiday.  Ginny used to get weird about family time together during the holidays too.  Harry is ready to settle in for the night when his boyfriend moves to straddle him after he lays down in bed.  Fingers moving questioningly along the waistband of Harry’s pants, arse grinding suggestively on Harry’s groin.
Draco’s wand is out in a flash as automatic as breathing.  James and Albus bolt behind him.  Expressions frightened.  The woman narrows her gaze on him, face contorting further if possible.  “BLOOD TRAITOR!  YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE YOUR FATE!  WORSE THAN MY BLASTED GET.  NOT WORTHY OF YOUR NAME.  NO MORE.  NO MORE OF MY HOUSE.  WHOR-”
At least twice a week, Nan or Uncle Ron would pick them up from school.  Gathering them up to go to the Burrow, where they stayed the night and left to school from there.  Jamie liked Nan’s breakfasts better anyway.  And on the days Dad got them when the final school bell rang, they went to the park or home.  Dad would work a while in his office or sit in the garden, drink in hand.  At some point, Dad would go to the kitchen to make dinner and the rest of the night was focused on them.  Dad smiling and laughing with them.  The way he should be.
Dad pinches the bridge of his nose where his glasses meet looking unhappy.  Maybe he's getting sick too.  Jamie hopes he won’t get ill.  It'll be okay though; he tries to reassure himself.  Draco’s here and he gives them potions for colds and headaches.  Draco even puts plasters on Lily’s knee when she's not hurt.  Plus, Aunt Audrey will come help if they fire-called her.  She's a healer.
He wakes to Potter wrapped around him like Devil’s Snare.  Snoring lightly.  A comforting, heavy weight on him.  It occurs to Draco that he is happy.  Sleepy and relaxed in this bed with his boyfriend.  Pleased to have someone close.  He was not certain he would enjoy this part.  Staying the night was new enough for him, but it is nice – lovely even.  Morning light streaming in, warming his face and highlighting the earthy colors of the bedroom.
“No.”
Jamie moves Lily in front of him so she can see better.  It’s one of his jobs.  He used to do it for Al, but then Al kept breaking his bubbling bizbee he’d got special from Uncle George.  Not even a Reparo could save it after the fifteenth time it broke.  It doesn’t matter having Lily in front though because he's taller.  Al fends for himself at his side to watch but leaves after a while satisfied with the show.  Jamie stays until Lily is ready to go back to the table.  Dad'll be angry if they leave her behind because she’s the baby even though she’s four now.
“Can’t you shrink it?”  Ginny suggests.
“We don’t have to do anything you’re uncomfortable with, Draco.”  His boyfriend assures him.
No one can move in a straight line with how many people are in the ballroom now.  The anterooms off the sides appear mostly full as well from what he can see.  People are bidding for items in there.  Harry weaves his way toward the stage set up at the back of the room.  Large banners hanging down like curtains elegantly framing the stage.  He had seen glimpses of clinic workers back there.
installed them with the hammer and nails he bought just to show Draco how muggles do it.  They start a lot of projects that way.  Him completing a menial task and the other man watching raptly like he is doing something extraordinary – sometimes taking literal notes.
“Fucking hell.”  Harry gasps out.  Feeling close, balls drawing up.  Draco is panting into his neck.  Harry can feel him making stilted motions against his thigh.  He moves to tweak one of Draco’s nipples and feels Draco bite down on his collarbone in response.  They move together like that for a while.  Harry gripping Draco’s hair and scratching his hand over Draco’s chest as the man licks his way across Harry’s sternum, biting and blowing as he goes.  Back and forth.
“If you like.”  He responds.  Personally, his hope was that Malfoy could live here without issue the remainder of his days.  He had placed people before in witness protection, but there was usually a team of people from the DMLE helping in those circumstances.
Draco presses a kiss to Harry’s exposed collar bone as the tips of his fingers trail upward, scratching lightly at Harry’s chest.
“Yes.  Yes, of course.”  Hermione agrees sounding weepy.  She puts her glass down on the brickwork and hugs him tightly.  “We love you, Harry.”  She tells him.  Harry pats her arm and looks at Ron bewildered but relieved.  Ron shrugs, expression suggesting this is what Harry gets when he says something so personal.
“What happens when you refuse an arranged marriage?"  He inquired, bemused by the whole idea.  "Do you lose your membership to the Sacred Twenty-eight or something?”
They aren’t together all the time when he is here, but it is nice to be able to hear the man moving around somewhere in the cottage from time to time.  He believes the same is true for Draco based on the corners of his mouth lifting whenever he sees Harry.
“I’ll let you know if we decide to release a statement.  I don’t want to blindside you.”
Harry has Albus crouched over the toilet now and it seems there is more left in him.  Unfortunately.  His boyfriend rubs Albus’ back as the boy pukes.  Draco thouroughly scrubs his own arms and neck before going to take Albus’ temperature with a wave of his wand.  Sure enough, the boy has a fever.
“Ron.”  Granger reprimands.  “They’re good friends and you said yourself she seems like a good parent.  She can’t be all that bad . . . anymore.  Besides, we have more important issues to discuss.”
“No, you’re not.”  Al criticizes while trying to keep the excitable crup in his arms.  Maud squirms and energetically wags her forked tail, clearly trying to escape Al’s grip as she paws at the boy.
Father seems unmoved by that, grey eyes merely roving slowly over Draco’s face.  They are in the same visitation room as before.  Bare and cold with a high-ceiling.  Lucius chained to the chair in front of Draco.
the probability of producing magical children, but he has not one hint of a guess how to prevent a child from being inherently magical.
“We can.”  Draco answers, hands on his hips as he considers the manor ahead of them from where they stand on the drive past the main gates.  Harry has the sealed portrait of Walburga Black under his arm.  The wooden seal maintaining a blessed peace for now.  “It will be my gift to you.”
Fuck.
Harry scowls, “And maybe you shouldn’t only stick with food on your side of the table, Ron.  If you did, you wouldn’t have any waffles since they are on
answer stuff.  He has to go through
“Okay.”  Jamie says, taking in this new information.  Being a blood traitor wasn’t all that bad then.  Maybe being a death eater was the same?  “But Uncle Ron, what’s a death eater, then?”
“Nooo.”  He groans despondently sagging forward in his chair.  Bixby won’t let them on the pitch if he’s fixing it.  He didn’t like him and Al on the pitch anyways.  Said they were messy even when he and Al tried to clean up after themselves.  And worst of all, except for the pitch the manor was gruesomely, mind-numbingly
Harry smiles.  “He does – at least, I believe so.”  Hermione had a way of making things simple but no less truthful for him.
Harry combs his hand through Draco’s silky hair, slightly longer now, but still shorter than his own tied back, mid-length hair.  When they separate, he admires how red Draco’s lips are just from kissing.  Draco has his hands on the inside of Harry’s coat, fingers playing with the buttons there.  Smiling shyly.
Today is a special day though.  Blustery as it is outside and about to snow.  Today he has brought a family heirloom to test out a theory.  Harry is on hand.  He is extremely helpful that way.  They have not brought the children here yet.  Draco would rather they stay off the property until he can be reasonably certain of their safety and vice versa.  The experience of having the children at his flat taught him that important lesson.
“What?”  Harry yells back at him.  Trying to get Draco to come closer.
Dad squints at her.  “What did you do, Lily bean?”
“I wish I had your optimism – or any optimism.”  He replies.  It is an intoxicating madness.  Whatever this is.  He never experienced anything like it.  Swinging from sureness to uncertainty in the span of minutes.  Back and forth.  It made him dizzy.
Harry rolls his eyes so hard it feels like he just put a crick in his neck.  “So,
“Agree to disagree.”  He retorts.  It's what he would tell his children.  Draco moves upward and kisses his cheek.  Harry turns his head to return it.  Chasing his lips.  When Harry opens his eyes, it is to see Draco’s content expression.  It fills him with warmth.  Checking his watch does not dull it too much.  He has a little less than twenty minutes remaining.
As far as Harry knows, the manor was still sealed under orders from the Ministry.
She smiles at him, but her eyes are guarded.  “Is that enough, I wonder?  Given your histories?”
He has to consider that question.  “You crossed my mind.  Wondered where you were mostly.  I knew you were overseas, but not where.  I always hoped you were doing okay.  Hoped you found something good for yourself.”  Harry answers truthfully, observing Draco’s curious expression.  “Did you think of me?”
statement.  He can hear one of Robards’ squad whisper ‘did you know about this?’.
at the core of this place.  We are currently in part of it - astral dimensionally speaking.  Your body is taking quite a bit of physical damage.”  Severus remarks, gesturing for him to follow and they walk to another large windowpane.
The second and last time she calls on him is nearly fourteen years later.  Out of the blue on a cool, crisp spring day.  An eagle owl tapping at the window of his office.  He is a deputy head auror by then and answers her request to visit him in his office with a counteroffer that he can meet her at the manor.  Andromeda had kept him apprised of Narcissa in the years since the sisters’ reunion.  Harry knew she was dying by then and in no state to traipse through the ministry and its many obstacles it would produce for a woman married to one death eater and the mother of another.
Her brow furrows, glowering.  “Then, I recommend you give your statement today.”
“Hello, Pansy.”  Harry greets cordially, joining them.  He had been flagged down earlier by a couple Draco does not know.  Something about a field trip?  Draco can see some of the other parents still gawking at them.  Eyes shifting guiltily away when they spot Draco looking back.  He hopes they will get used to his presence as time goes on.  Then he can be just another person in the crowd.
“What is a PTA?”  He asks suspiciously.  Whatever it was, it sounded daunting the way Pansy said it.
“I will not.”  Draco declares defensively inciting Astoria to howl.
“Yes.”  Clearwater assures her underling with a nod, caught up in her own story.  “I’ve never seen him so upset.  It was way worse than the time I accidentally filled that interrogation room with fish.”
“I think we should talk.”  He tries, palms raised, and walking slowly toward the boy.  “You’re upset.”
His other cousins are around playing, Al and Lily along with them.  Well, everyone except Freddie who is with Nan writing an apology letter to the person he pranked.  Jamie decides it’s a good time to pop out on the porch and rub elbows with the old men.
questions.  And I certainly cannot imagine me relieving any stress of yours.  As I recall, I have only ever been quite vexing for you.”  It should sound more mocking and haughtier than it comes out.  Certainly less fond.  Draco’s voice has been doing that lately when this man is involved.  Potter only grins at him, expression assured.  Much too handsome for his own good.
“It is your duty to preserve our good name, Draco.”
“I wouldn’t say that.”  Draco reproaches with a slight frown.  Considering their overall behavior since he met the children.  “Although, today your sons did break into the one part of the house they were barred from entering the first moment an opportunity arose.  They take after
Harry grins, wagging his brows.  Certain in the knowledge he’s already won.  “C’mon.”  He prods, pulling Draco in tighter.  “For me?”
His friends are tucked to the side of the room behind one of the larger, complex sculptures made by an Aberfa daughter of Llacheu depicting the peaceful resolution between magical Welsh clans.
“All right, squad, listen up.  First item, Hobbs and Ming, you two are following up on the goblin case.  The rest of us will be focused on a raid this afternoon.  As some of you are aware, Shepard discovered the location of Spinner’s hideout last night.  Shepard, update.”
.”  Jamie mimics loudly, mocking his brother.  Jamie often tried to provoke his brother by pointing out such babyish behavior.  Al shoots his brother a glare but does not strike out as Jamie stows his toothbrush and passes by to exit the bathroom.
Draco had had a lot of free time on his hands once he began working as a potion maker after he earned his mastery certifications.  Relegated to an entry position far beneath his academic and practical experience.  Nevertheless, it was a job and it was work he enjoyed.  Even so, he was used to studying or lab work when left to his own devices.  Becoming an animagus seemed an impossible challenge.  One that would keep him occupied in the meantime.
“Why would you do that?”  Al asks, face scrunched up and looking hard at Draco.
“Hi.”  He says dumbly when he realizes Draco is silently returning his gaze.  Staring.  Grey eyes going over him and making him feel warm despite the uncertain welcome.
“That doesn’t make you queer.”
“Sorry.”  Albus offers appearing contrite.
“I don’t wanna bother Dad.”  Jamie puts off immediately.  Dad always seemed sad or upset when him or Al had questions about the war.  He tried not to ask about it too much.
“I am.”  He confirms, taking the man into custody.  Wishing this exact interaction occurred less when he was arresting someone.  It was the most awkward way to meet someone who seemed genuinely pleased to meet him.
“You did
“I’m making you match.”  She informs him as if she is bestowing a great gift.
“Is that a jinx?”
An arm twitches once under the blanket covered lump that is his boyfriend then raises obligingly.  Offering an opening.  Harry sighs, crawling over to join him and feeling a tad ridiculous.  He pulls the remainder of it over him, so they are both covered.  It reminds him a bit of the blanket forts he’s made with his children – although those were much roomier and brighter.  There isn’t much space between him and Draco.  The dim light from the lamp and the streetlights outside Draco’s open curtains doesn’t do much for Harry’s vision.
“Why?”

Curiosity.  Disgust.  Awe.
have to get married.  Neither of us obviously wants that . . .”  She trails off, sitting back before giving him a stern look, still holding on to his hand.  “Your probation is almost over, right?”
Jamie stifles his laugh as he climbs out of bed.  He gives the crup a few good pets before Al wakes and tries to sit up.  Causing the crup to bark excitedly.  Jamie grabs her as he and Al hold still.  Tensely waiting to see if someone overheard their secret pet.
“You’re Draco Malfoy.”  Doge says all in one burst, practically vibrating and thrusting his hand forward in an open invitation to shake Draco’s.  “You invented Serene Sunrise.  My gran had dementia and she did loads better after her healer prescribed her that potion.  She was able to sleep all through the night without getting confused and upset.”
“I love it.”  Draco responds sincerely.  “How many charms are in it?”
“You first.”  He prompts.
“Bugger off, Liam.”  Yuri pipes up.  They didn't like Liam.  Not a lot of people in their year did.  He could be a bully.  “If you’re not here to trade go back to your mates.”
Draco looks despairing for a second before he drags the blanket over his head.  “You’ll hate me.”  He bemoans tucking his legs underneath and curling in on himself.
There is something subvocal emanating from her slightly parted lips, eyes darting wildly over his face like she cannot believe it is him.  The noise she emits grows louder.  Growing so loud the place shakes with the vibrations of it causing his ear drums to hurt.  It is not any language he has ever heard.  Definitely not one he was aware she could speak.  It reminds him of the underground tunnels leading to the dungeons, echoing and ghostly.
“I’m fine, Tony.”  Pansy responds, turning to face them, leaving a steadying hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “Honestly, I wasn’t going to drink any more tonight anyway.  I'm definitely
“I want to start bringing Draco around the kids.”  He tells her.  “That’s why I’m bringing this all up now.”
The boys look like Potter.  Draco knew that from photos, but it is different to experience it in person.  Strangely endearing.  The reality of this grown man he cares so much about having two near copies of him running about.  Both boys have the same ochre skin and messes of thick, black hair.  The younger son comes over first – Albus.  Rectangle-framed glasses and bright green eyes.  He is adorably chubby.  Draco suspects Astoria would love to pinch his cheeks.
The current Goyle household was a far stretch from the rocky estate Greg had been raised on.  This abode was a simple, warm-colored flat situated above the delightful bakery that Greg’s muggle wife, Khady, and his sister-in-law owned.  Draco had rarely visited Britain in the years after his probation.  This trip was in large part brought on by his old childhood friend.  Greg had recently married and invited Draco to visit the next time he was in the country.  Draco had been surprised but pleased by the invitation.  His old friend had not invited him to visit before, and while Draco never pushed, he had missed him.  Now, he could offer congratulations for the marriage in person.
