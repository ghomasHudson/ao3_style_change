Harry returned with his potions book pressed between his elbow and ribs, carrying two mugs of steaming tea. When he placed one in front of Draco, the blond looked up, startled. Harry saw confusion hush over the face and offered the obvious explanation, “I made tea: no milk, one and a half sugars.”
Harry could hear his blood pumping in his ears, subconsciously holding his own breath. When Malfoy breathed out it was with a controlled “woosh” and accompanied by his hand falling to his side. With a perfectly polite, almost friendly tone he said, “I am sorry for my outburst, it was unfitting of me. Please continue. You were saying something about my memory not being enough?”
The sudden restriction of his blood flow in combination with his already overly sensitive neck and the slight burn of Draco entering him, makes Harry see stars. His vision goes hazy around the edges and Harry feels like he is floating through a sea of pure lust. Reality slams back into him as Draco bottoms out and loosens the grip on his neck, letting the blood flow freely again.
He bumped his knee against Pansy’s, glanced at Blaise and raised an eyebrow. Pansy only shook her head.
“I might have a proposition for you, if the rumours prove to be true.” Malfoy says cryptically, leaving Harry to inquire what rumours the blond meant.
Some of the nervous energy left Draco. This was only another one of those ‘are you behaving’ talks he had to endure. At least McGonagall wouldn’t insult him the whole time through. Eyes downcast, he informed the Headmistress that he was faring rather well and that he was keeping up with all his coursework.
Harry rushed to explain, that neither of them had done it consciously and that he hadn’t said anything because he never knew how to broach the subject. “I mean it’s not that bad anyway, I… kinda like it,” he admitted and thinking back to the day before added, “Which is why I was so quiet yesterday. I … kind of woke up to it and just decided to continue sleeping because it felt… well nice. I’m super sorry about that by the way.”
Harry got up and asked for the bathroom, following where Draco pointed. When Harry came back into the bedroom Draco was finally fully awake.
Exchanging a questioning glance with Harry, Draco answered, “Only that you look lovely in that shade of blue. It brings out the golden undertones in your hair.” Flattery was always an option and he wasn’t even lying, the blouse did look great on Hermione.
It was inexplicable to him, but he wanted to talk to McGonagall about it. He had never actually said what kept him from the Hall, having let Pansy think that it was because of the other students, which was only half true.
“Fucking finally,” groaned Harry “I’ve looked into six other compartments. One would think the younger years had somewhat gotten used to me over the pa-” he broke off, having spotted Draco. Pansy sniggered at his open mouth, completely ignoring her own previous shock at the transformation.
Draco was glad that they didn’t want to use their common room, that way he had somewhere to flee to that wasn’t his dorm.
Am I posting this in the wee hours of the morning, because TECHNICALLY it is monday and therefore posting day? Hell yes I am. I am super excited to put this out there.
“In general?? Uhm. Nothing?” Potter admitted cautiously. He released a breath when Draco didn’t comment on it and simply went onto the next question.
After 15 minutes of rolling around in the empty feeling bed Harry sighed, reluctantly sat up and settled into sitting cross legged on the covers with his back leaning against the headboard. He closed his eyes and focussed on his breathing.
Even though she hadn’t cleared her suggestion with Pansy beforehand, there was no objection. On the contrary, Pansy mouthed a silent “thank you” at her.
They end the training and he goes over to join Chris , asking how he feels. Chris only shrugs it off before commenting. “So… Never got along, huh?” and he nods towards Malfoy and Malcolm talking. “You sure you don’t wanna raise a claim on him? You two seem to have some wicked chemistry going on.”
“Merlin, I want you.” Harry murmured hoarsely into his ear, the sound going straight to Draco’s cock.
Shaking hands reached for another biscuit. Draco took his time eating, hoping to sort his head. “Mother is nothing like him. I hate that he pulled her into this mess. I hate that she still loves him, even though he pulled us into this.”
Potter scanned his face for a moment but didn’t seem to trust what he saw. “Do you promise to not rip your hair out if I do?”
The mixture of hope, happiness and relief in combination with the still red face would have looked ridiculous on anyone else, but Draco thought it suited Harry rather well. Draco nodded and Harry smiled widely.
“If we’re talking about you choking and fucking me: derogation, choking me out, any version of ‘saviour nicknames’, skipping prep, permanent marks.”
An involuntary whimper escapes him when Draco sits up straight, chuckling at Harry’s distress and looking him over intensely. “Merlin you are beautiful.” Draco says a few moments later and reaches for his own shirt. He starts to slowly unbutton it and Harry struggles against his restraints after the second button, desperately wanting to touch.
In the morning he felt guilty. It was one thing to not tell Draco about him cuddling Harry while asleep, but to consciously enjoy it felt like using Draco. They still spent the day studying next to each other but Harry found that he couldn’t as freely join into the easy flow of conversation they had grown used to in the past week. If Draco noticed his odd behaviour he didn’t comment on it.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know yet. I’ll probably take a bit of time off to take care of Grimmauld Place properly and do some soul searching.”
His cheeks grew hot and Draco found himself staring at his own shoes. They needed to be polished again, the worn leather was dull.
“I know,” mumbled Draco, “but most of that isn’t from school. Courtesy of you-know-who and his followers.”
He wouldn't be allowed to leave England and he would have to meet with his parole officer once a month, (once per 3 months while at Hogwarts) but who cared? All of that would be over in two years. And he had endured worse. He could manage two years.
Malcolm nods approvingly and tells her to go to the other half of the padded area with Lucy. “For the first few
Harry feels himself growing red and mumbles, “Getting choked apparently does, yeah.” and swiftly drains his glass. He’s far too sober for this type of conversation. A hum can be heard from the other side of the sofa.
His voice sounded steadier than he felt, although a slight breathlessness was audible in his words. The moment he finished talking, his eyes dropped to his books on the table. There was a slight ringing in his ears.
“Come on! You look perfect, and if we don’t leave now we’re going to be late.” Harry whined  from the door leading to their bathroom. Draco still checked his hair over for the third time — it was almost his natural platinum blond that day although it still carried a hint of pink — and only then did he decide that he looked presentable enough.
“She is a lot better now. It was just a flu, but at her age I didn’t want to risk leaving her alone with Teddy. He is a lovely child but Andy wouldn’t have found a moment of rest watching him.”
Panting, Harry broke their kiss, his eyes screwed shut and his head thrown back. Draco let him get used to the intrusion and only moved his finger, angling to find the other man's prostate. A smirk crossed Draco’s face when he found it, forcing Harry’s eyes to fly open and a moan to escape his lips. Harry’s hips bucked into his and swiftly back onto the finger still inside of him
The Gryffindor moaned in appreciation and took in the sight of Draco shirtless on top of him, a hand reaching up to touch the faint criss crossing scars on his chest. Draco could see the guilt building inside Harry, but was unwilling to let his scars ruin the mood.
His bisexuality hadn’t been the reason they had broken up; they had simply fallen out of love. The year spent apart had changed them both, and they each grew into different people and Harry liking men too had only been a contributing factor in that. Ginny hadn’t seen that at first, not understanding how they could have fallen out of love. She clung so desperately to the idea of them together that she had grasped onto every argument, and later every threat she could find, as a way to get him to stay. But when she had nearly outed him — that was the final straw. She had apologized, later on, but Harry still couldn’t really forgive her.
Pansy came to his room like she did after almost every meal. Draco was still incredibly grateful for her and the meals she brought up for him. With the steady supply of food his body had finally been able to recover somewhat from the malnourishment of the past months. He was still too skinny, but he at least couldn’t count all of his ribs anymore, not without consciously trying to. Between the regular meals and actually sleeping at night (at least most nights) Draco looked healthier than he had in a long time. His body was still mangled and he still radiated fear when he walked the Halls, but in the security of his dorms or even the 8th year common room, he actually looked something close to happy at times.
“I asked whether choking turns you on. You never answered in the dojo.” Malfoy repeats himself, steadily looking Harry in the eyes.
November turned into December and while Draco wouldn’t necessarily consider himself friends with Harry, he was friendly with him; the bond was behaving and overall Draco was happier than he had expected to be. However, he had forgotten about Christmas break. Harry had let it slip in their last tutoring session, how he was nervous about being back at the Weasley’s this Christmas. Excited, but nervous. And Draco realised with a shock that that would mean Harry leaving his general proximity for almost two weeks.
He got hard, thinking about the way Blaise had ground against him on the couch and he gave in and reached inside his boxers, closing his hand around his cock.
Harry lay his hand on top of Draco’s, “I like you, you fool” the dark haired man said softly, and Draco felt his heart skip a beat.
He even got used to Potter, who seemed to take the group’s approach of leaving him alone for most of the game. Or so Draco had thought until Potter called upon him. Trusting neither choice, Draco simply picked Truth and awaited his question anxiously.
“Times of war, Mr. Malfoy. And as far as I am aware you never had the actual intentions to kill someone, and especially never wished to be in a position where you had to.” Her gaze was stern and the posture as rigid as always, her hands clasped behind her back.
Harry raised an eyebrow at that, “I saw the recognition on your face. I would know you anywhere and you know me anywhere too. And please, I know what you’re like in an actual fight. You put on a show to protect yourself, not to stop me. Regardless, you saved me, so thank you.”
Muscles pleasantly sore from shoveling the walkway, Harry spent the rest of the afternoon reading up in his room, slowly defrosting from the outdoor chill under a pile of blankets, the reason only partially being that he was hiding from Malfoy after the awkward incident with the hat and gloves. Well, maybe more than partially.
“We never really did stuff like that in my common room,” Malfoy said thoughtfully. “Slytherins aren’t exactly the paling around house. Besides, can you imagine how competitive we’d all get?”
“Oh. That’s . . . smart,” Harry said lamely. “You’ll have to teach me that one along with the tie trick.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t do that,” Harry said quickly, not wanting the elf to get in trouble for his own foolishness. “I’m sure he’ll move on to some other Christmas thing soon and he doesn’t mean any harm.”
Blushing slightly at being caught, Harry made his way down the stairs, sitting on a sofa by the dying embers in the fire place. “I didn’t know you played piano,” he said quietly. He had always felt as though he had Draco Malfoy figured out. He knew exactly who he was, heart, mind, and soul. But after watching Malfoy play, he wasn’t sure he did anymore. Maybe he never had.
“Hello? Is someone there?” A quivering voice suddenly called out from another room and footsteps sounded against the floorboards.
“So glad you were able to come!” She said cheerily. “I’m so sorry I didn’t get your invitation to you sooner, but Harry never mentioned—”
Harry stepped up to the counter, determined to be as friendly as possible to make up for the snooty bastard before him. “Hi there, I would like a—”
The lake had finally frozen over, and upon hearing that Malfoy had never gone skating, Harry promptly dragged them all out onto the ice, charmed skates on their feet as they swirled across the frozen surface. Malfoy had taken loads of falls at first, although, granted, in the most dignified manner that Harry had ever seen, but by the end of the day, even he was doing short laps across the ice with an unironic grin on his face.
“What?” Harry shouted back, shoved farther away from Malfoy as several Hufflepuffs pushed their way between them.
“Excuse me?” Draco half sat up, brow furrowed. “What are you on about, Potter? Surely someone did? The Prophet said you lived with your aunt and uncle, surely they . . . ?”
Malfoy quirked an amused eyebrow. “I was thinking that the weather outside is looking quite lovely and that I might go skating and that perhaps you might like to come along?”
So that’s what this was about. The fucking favour Harry had promised him at the beginning of it all. He should have known Draco wouldn’t have let it go. He was a Slytherin, for fuck’s sake. What more did he expect?
Malfoy quickly filled the whole sheet of dough with stars, carefully arranging all their edges so he could use the most amount of dough.
The three Gryffindors started at the endearment. Even Granger looked up from her book. Draco kicked them sharply under the table and coughed pointedly.
Harry looked down to see that his boyfriend’s eyes were shut and his breaths had smoothed out with only a hint of congestion still audible as he slept. Smiling, Harry carefully took off his glasses and leaned back against the pillows, warm and comfortable curled up with Draco. Safe. And so filled up with happiness, that Harry realized it had been worth all the struggles to get there. At last, hand in hand.
“It’s just, Malfoy’s quite sick. Can I take him out of class so he can rest?” Harry asked quickly, pointing back to where Draco was collapsed over a desk. “We both hate to miss one of your fascinating lessons, but as you can see, he really is not doing well.”
But it was impossible to ignore Malfoy. Harry kept stealing glances at the blond young man from behind his book, noting the small furrow on his brow as he squinted at the pages and the unconscious tapping of his feet against the arm of the sofa. He was tall enough that he had to bend his knees to stretch out across the furniture, pillow propped behind his back, and the sight was so novel that Harry couldn’t quite stop himself from continuing to snatch looks. There was something strangely endearing about watching his former nemesis curled up in a jumper reading a book. It was so non-threatening. Domestic even.
Harry followed his friends into the dank classroom, inwardly marveling at how odd it was to hear himself and Malfoy paired together in conversation without their names directly being followed by something like: ‘tried to kill each other’.
“It’s not nothing,” Malfoy insisted, frowning at the faint ridges that formed the words across the back of Harry’s hand. “It says ‘I must not tell lies’ on your hand. That doesn’t just happen.”
The small child turned to look up at him as well. “Uncle Harry!” The child cried delightedly, a big grin coming across his face.
“What are you doing?” Harry demanded, wincing at every creak his boots made as he trod across the old floorboards towards Malfoy.
“We could go sit somewhere,” Draco offered, gesturing towards the various pieces of common room furniture, which had all been pushed back against the walls to make room for some sort of dance floor.
“Thank you, O’Leary!” Harry called after him as the elf disappeared. He slumped back against the headboard of the bed. Dinner with Draco Malfoy.
Harry leaned out from the other side, trying to throw one over Malfoy’s wall, but was unable to get enough momentum behind it, as it broke into pellets in the middle of the battle ground.
A red heat flooded through Draco’s insides, banishing any cold he might have felt. And then he pounced, quickly scoping up his own handful of snow and lobing it at Potter’s head as he scrambled away across the Quidditch field in fear of retaliation.
Harry watched as Malfoy’s face went blank with surprise, grey eyes flitting across his features as if counting to be sure it was him. Scar, check, unruly hair, check, lack of eloquence, check. He still looked hesitant, as if Harry Potter couldn’t possibly have just knocked him to the ground. And yet here they were.
“Harry James Potter, I know that I’m slightly sloshed right now,” a corner of Draco’s mouth went up in a grin. “But sloshed or not, I will always know one thing: I am completely in love with you and I want to spend the rest of my life at your side. Whether it’s at these stupid events or on our couch watching those weird Muggle moving pictures that you love so much or, or anywhere! I just know that I want to be there. With you. Always. So,” Draco summed up a final breath, gray eyes fixed solemnly on Harry’s face. “Would you do the greatest honour in the world and marry me?”
Finally Draco spoke up, “Tell you what, I was on the way to a restaurant in the neighbourhood, how about you join me and we start talking. That is if you haven’t eaten yet.”
“Where did you pull the soulmate from? Does everyone have one?” The whole topic was new to Harry. He was intrigued enough to forget that he was supposed to be hating the man in front of him.
Snapping out of it, Harry continues to the mat, and  quickly finds his spot in the lineup — in the past months the course had grown to ten regular participants —  across from Malcolm and Malfoy and kneels. All through the customary greeting ceremony Harry wonders why the hell Malfoy is kneeling on the instructors side and why he was even in this dojo at all.
They all knew Draco would talk to them once he was ready and that he just wanted to be held until then. So they held him and waited.
Fun little fact for you though: in all of my stories so far I included "running fingers through another persons hair" as a way to show intimacy, trust, comfort and as a way to calm someone down. Guess what I love my s/o doing to me?
And one day Draco had explained to Harry that he originally had started baking out of boredom and promptly realized how similar it was to potions — just without the magic—  and he fell completely in love with the manual task. He loved that the worst thing one could mess up while baking was to have it taste bad. It wasn’t lethal, it wasn’t dangerous, it wasn’t dark. The repetitiveness and the simultaneous creativity had helped him quite a lot after the war. Not that he had told Harry that, they strictly evaded talking about the war, in fear of making their newfound friendship awkward.
“A mother has her ways.” was her response. Narcissa once again reached out to him, offering her hand in support. “I’ve suspected it for years, but after Blaise I knew for certain. I don’t think any different of you for it, you’re still my little dragon. That will never change.”
Before he could wonder about the friendliness displayed in the single sentence, Morris was talking to him again, “This isn’t over, I’ll get you next time.”
. So they had teamed up on him. There was blood rushing through Draco’s ears and he was vaguely aware of his grip tightening on his quill. ‘New’ and ‘normalcy’ in one sentence just didn’t sound promising. His eyes flickered in between the two witches before finally settling onto his parchment. Taking a deep breath, he steadied himself and forced the question out, “What were you planning on forcing me to do then?”
A giggle went across the group and Draco smirked, Pansy had always liked her drinking games dirty. Looking around the circle, he noticed a few of them drinking and blushing.
Overwhelmed with the sweet gesture, Draco hugged Harry a bit more tightly. “Thank you Harry. Really. This is exactly what I needed right now.”
When he looked back to Harry, he saw him smoothing his hands over the fabric of his jeans, the vacant and shocked expression had disappeared.
Harry was still fidgeting with his wand and suddenly Draco realized that he was not only nervous but apologetic. Vanishing the muffin paper and crumbs with a flick of his wrist, Draco sat up and cupped Harry’s face, forcing him to look him in the eyes.
“No, we’re not,” Hermione finally said, obviously seeing that Ron wasn’t going to be able to form a coherent response any time soon.
“Are you sure?” Potter goaded, leaning in closer, which was not helping with Draco’s ability to concentrate. “I give great advice!”
“Sorry, can I help you with something?” He asked distractedly, peering over her shoulder to see if Ron and Hermione had come out with the latest trickle of students. No such luck.
“God, Potter, you really are incapable of remaining standing,” he groaned. “That’s the third time you’ve tripped on top of me.”
Still grinning, Harry turned back to walk out of the kitchen, just in time to see Draco slip out of the back door, coat slung over his arm.
Harry wound down the staircase into the common room, which was only habited by some first and second years studying and an uncharacteristically unsteady looking Hermione Granger. She appeared to be mumbling to herself and staring fixatedly at the fireplace, swinging her legs in mismatched beats.
“It’s alright, Potter, it’s not that actually,” Malfoy admitted. “I just prefer to make my gifts. I always have.”
Harry faltered. The thought felt jarring. This was different. Harry had wanted to kiss Malfoy before, sure, but it had always come from a place of burning and desire, not . . . whatever this was. This strange fluttering warmth in his stomach that made him want to curl up against Malfoy’s shoulder and whisper sweet-nothings into his ear, like the first snow.
Harry tipped his head back, staring up at the dark clouds as more snowflakes began to drift down softly, landing on his glasses, dotting his coat, and catching in his hair. The first snow of the year. A magic that Harry looked forward to every year that couldn’t be captured by any spell. Something that had always given him hope, even when he had just come out of his cupboard and glimpsed it through the window above the stove where he was making the Dursleys’ breakfast.
“Honestly, Ron, try to be a little more careful,” Hermione said sharply, inching her open book further away from the potential zone of damage. “You know Madam Pince gives you detention if you bring back a book in worse condition than when you took it out and I’ve had three close calls this past month already, all because of your clumsy table habits.”
“So,” Pansy said, the calmness leeching through her tone more frightening than if she had shouted. “Seems like your ‘secret’ was about Potter after all. I just thought you were going to be screwing
“That was marvelous,” Andromeda said, getting to her feet and going over to her grandson and nephew. “What do you say to Uncle Draco, Teddy?”
“You’re only saying that because she doesn’t send you a maroon sweater every year,” Ron said darkly, nudging a familiar lumpy package with his foot.
“Well,” Malfoy began to wander across the room with faux nonchalance. “It seems like a wasted opportunity not to take advantage of all this snow. I propose that we have a snowball fight. No magic, just pure athletic ability.”
“Excuse me?” Draco turned to stare at him, noting his kiss-swollen lips with more interest than he would like to admit.
“It doesn’t matter what the school thinks,” Pansy said firmly. “Only what Potter thinks, and he knows the truth.”
“Merlin, you’re at the bit about the Statute already? I’m still on Fudge’s five times great-aunt,” Potter groaned, dropping his quill onto the table dramatically and splattering ink across Weasley’s still mostly blank parchment.
Startled, Harry turned to look at him, gaze momentarily filled with confusion, then flickering to . . . pain? before hardening into emerald shards. Granger and Weasley looked at each other nervously, aware of the plan, but still apprehensive about what was about to go down.
“It’s not that bad,” Malfoy said comfortingly. “It’s one of the more flattering pictures I’ve had featured in the paper. The ones of me from the Trials are just terrible. My hair would not cooperate.”
Draco’s cold seemed to get progressively worse with each class. At first it was only infrequent sniffing and small bouts of coughing, but eventually Draco couldn’t speak without sounding as though he was hacking his lunges up and he was shivering so hard that Harry had forced him to wear his cloak on top of his own.
“Thank you all for coming to Christmas,” he said, smiling widely at the people seated around him. “I would just like to announce that there is something I’ve been keeping from you all these years. I’m really Father Christmas.”
Draco swallowed hard, his head spinning before all the pieces clicked smartly into place. Potter was challenging him! Using that flirtatious voice and absurdly flowery language to put on a show and practically daring Draco to do better. How foolish of him to forget that he was dealing with a Slytherin. Poor Gryffindor had no chance in hell.
Ron had clapped him on the shoulder, saying in a satisfied tone, “Well, glad that’s all overwith and we can get back to some kind of normal.”
Harry was mercifully cut off as Ron appeared beside them, shifting from foot to foot, but managing to look Hermione in the face with minimal blushing. She pinked, but stood, smiling as she took in his tidied hair and freshly laundered sweater.
“Don’t worry, it won’t be that high,” Harry assured him. “Please? I swear, I might go insane if you don’t come.”
“Did Tavish and Mattias get together in the end?” Harry asked casually, fighting to hold back the smile that so desperately wanted to slip over his face.
“Right! Yeah, actually, there was something . . .” Colin trailed off, fidgeting with the long sleeves of his robe, before seeming to make up his mind about something. “Iwaswonderingifyouwouldliketogooutwithme.”
“Same here. This is my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy,” Harry said pointedly, nudging Malfoy again, who elbowed him back as he reached his hand forward.
Harry watched as Malfoy whispered something to Teddy, who nodded, eyes wide as Malfoy positioned his fingers on the keys, before beginning to play the lower half of ‘Heart and Soul’. Malfoy played a few bars, before nodding at Teddy, who slowly began playing the higher part, poking at the keys with one finger. The song was far from melodious, but the grins the two of them were sharing as they came to the end of the song was sweeter than any tune.
“Hey, mate, where were you?” Ron asked, his gaze finally tugged away from Hermione by Harry’s sudden reappearance.
A fresh breeze gusted across the stands and Harry shivered, the cold reminiscent of the Slytherin dungeon. His hands were slowly reddening to match his tie.
Draco nestled the bottle back inside of the box. “They must have changed the packaging,” he commented idly to nobody in particular, noting that the bottle's glass was green now instead of the navy that toned the empty bottle still up in his room.
Draco nodded, getting the awful picture. “You may sit down, thank you.” He sighed. How was he supposed to even try to fix this? It feels like nothing had changed, just reversed sides. He wonders if McGonagall had tried to stop the school-wide bullying of Slytherin, he’ll have to talk to her.
“And the glasses. These are fake. I didn’t think the students or parents would like a formerly known death eater on staff, especially with my name. It’s Albert Anderson right now.”
Most shook their head no, a few spoke mumbled “no” Draco nodded. “Good. And the same is said for the sweeter you take coffee, the more creamer you put in it, the more agreeable you are. Coffee is like Slytherin; it’s not evil. It’s what people do to it that does. I hope you all take this to heart.”
He’ll save that for the end of the month. One thing he never quite agreed with Snapes teaching; he had a throw them to the wolves sort of style, where only the best could succeed. He lost count how many times he had to help out fellow Slytherins in potions because they couldn’t keep up with it or we’re plain bad at it.
Once there McGonagall was already there and worry stricken as she came over. “What is happening Professor? Is she alright?” Draco glared. “If you call a broken nose and black eye alright.” He gently took the tie away, blood stained as Emily was still crying quietly.
Dracos wyes widened. “Why? He should know that you-know-who, when he was following him, would have killed him should he successfully killed you.”
“Well June and Benjamin, it’s nice to meet you. You can sit down. Now, this might be a heavy question, what has Slytherin house been like the past two years?”
He was quiet for a moment before he spoke, thinking of what he wanted to say. Guess he should start with the basics. “I am Professor Albert Anderson. I’ll be your new potions Professor and in charge of Slytherin. Now, have they decided who are the prefects for the house?”
Draco glared. “And I’m serious, I have to get to my classroom. If you want to talk about my well-being then find someone who cares about it.” Draco pushed past and felt a wave of exhaustion hit him. He groaned, ignoring it and drinking his mug of coffee.
Draco hopes they got a few new Slytherins. The numbers are scarily low. While the other houses have at least 250 to 300 per house. Slytherin barely has 100. Between drop outs and people who refuse to be in the house or even attend the school. The war made sure Slytherin had a tarnished named.
She introduced Hagrid, Trelawney and others before she got to Harry. “Now, unfortunately this is too often but we have a new and hopefully permanent, Defense against the dark arts teacher. I think you all already know him. But please give a big, Hogwarts welcome to Harry Potter.”
Draco was suddenly heavier. Harry looked and saw he had passed out in his arms. Harry sighed. “Really wish our lives turned out differently.”
He sat up, grabbing his wand shakily. “Luminos Maximus.” He said wobbly as the wand lit up brightly. All visions of Voldemort gone. There was nothing in his room except for his suitcase and few belongings he managed to keep.
Harry smiled. “I get it. I wonder how some will react when their defense against the dark arts teacher is me.”
Harry smiled softly. “It’s alright. I always suspected he was a bit of a shit parent from how he acted. You know he tried to kill me once?”
Draco nodded. “I will give you that, I did have room to stretch, so to speak. But…father. I don’t think he ever actually cared about me. I think all he wanted was an heir to carry on the family name. Most of the time he ignored me and when he did pay attention to me he was strict as you could get. Always telling me everything I was doing wrong, even the way I wore my hair, any pound of weight I gained he spoke against.”
Draco was exhausted the next morning. When it was time for breakfast he accidentally ran into  Neville Longbottom, another he had been trying to avoid due to their history.
Draco looked over, feeling a little more relaxed now that introductions are out of the way with other Professors. “Better now.”
But he wasn’t as stealthy as he thought when there was a knock on the door. He swallowed down his food and sighed. “Come in.” Prayed it wasn’t one of the kids.
Draco glared softly. “Rules and guidelines? Do you have any idea how severe the bullying is? What some of them are being told daily? Micheal came to me because 8
There was no way he was sleeping and he didn’t want to go wandering the castle. It would be a long night with no sleep.
“Muggles. They  didn’t know about magic until I got the letter for Hogwarts. My dad is a police officer and my mum is a therapist.”
McGongall cleared her throat.  Harry got the point, he quickly walked past Draco and handed her his papers. She smiled. “Thank you Potter. Now you two are more than welcome to catch up, outside my office.”
Once everything was set and class was about to start any minute, he heard a small scuffle and yelling “let us though! This is stupid!”
Draco sat at his desk, adjusting his colored hair. Once at his desk he didn’t feel the need to lecture the boy more, he could see clearly he was reading the shrinking solution.
He held up his mug of coffee. “I have here a black coffee. It’s been proven that the darker you drink your coffee, the more likely you are to be psychopathic. in muggle terms that means the darker it is, the more likely you are to be evil. But is the coffee itself evil?”
He sighed, walking to the heavy wooden door, opening it to see third years blocking the entrance to his class. He crossed his arms and spoke loud enough to scare them. “What exactly is going on here?”
“You too, Professor.” Draco said as he stood. Harry gave a smile before jogging away to start his classes.
He got his food and coffee and took it to his classroom. At least he can prepare for the next classes.
When they got there Harry opened the door for him and Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not some maiden for you to woo Potter.”
and turn it into something funny. No one has ever seen their true form, they live in dark, secluded spots.”
Most of the class stayed quiet, Draco occasionally correcting a student before class was over.  He heard a few of the kids talk as they exited. “He’s a lot like Snape was isn’t he?”
“I was a death eater.” Draco said, voice cracking.  “I hated on Hermione because of her parents. I called her mud blood and filthy. I’m sure her parents were great too.”
“Well, it’s hard to explain. I know I have Ron and Hermione to go to but sometimes that’s not enough, so I write.”
He never knew how much he would miss the days where the worst thing that happened was his bullying. The doors suddenly opened, startling him. It was McGonagall. She gave a warm smile. “Hello Professor-“
Harry only watched as Draco walked away, leaving a crumpled piece of paper. Why was Draco so upset? He grabbed the paper and read it over.
She nodded and left. He sighed. The room was dusty and grimy from disuse. He got to work, deciding to use his hands and not his wand, to clean some of it.
years getting shoved by older kids. The Ravenclaws avoid us and Hufflepuff is…weary. They’re civil with us but we can tell the connection isn’t there.”
“Gee I wonder why.” Draco said coldly. He knows the reasons. It made guilty nausea roll in his stomach.
Harry just smiled softly though it as he got to Dracos quarters. “It’s alright, it’s all in the past. We were kids.”
Over the next few weeks he managed to create a class schedule and plan, handing it in to the headmaster. Professor McGonagall took the papers with a smile. Draco cleared his throat. “One more thing. If there are any new kids that are scared of being put into Slytherin, can you send them to me? I want to talk to them, let them know it’s not a house full of villains and dark wizards.”
Harry spoke quietly. “No but I can guess. I’m sorry, honestly. I hate that my house has become known for bullies.”
Draco nodded. She sighed. “I suppose that isn’t as much a problem as a listening charm. It’s just a small issue of logistics and ethics. I know Professors are allowed to hand over memories for it.”
And that’s what led him back to Hogwarts to begin with. They’ve always been know for giving second chances and he was right to do so, because of his skills with potions, he became the new potions master and new head of Slytherin, under the condition they don’t release his name, having a plan on going by another name and attempting to change his appearance even little bit.
Draco stood, waving to the students and studying his table of students. All the kids  gave applause but the Slytherin table seemed hesitant. They clapped, a bit weakly.  Finally they were all able to eat.
Harry stopped him with a weak smile. “Its fine, professor Anderson just isn’t very social, nothing personal.”
Soon they were all sitting. Harry sitting next to him. Harry smiled over to him. “How are you settling in, Professor Anderson?”
Harry brought a hand to his cheek, wiping the tears away with his thumb. “It’s all in the past. You grew, you’re a better person. All you can do is continue that. You should get some sleep.”
“Even to me and I lived with the bastard.” He took a swig of fire whiskey, emptying the glass. “I’d like another.”
“We’ll do what you can, I promise, you’re student is safe here. She’ll be just fine.”  Draco just nodded, worrying coiling inside of him as he walked away .
Two hands shot up. Draco motioned for them to stand. They did. A boy, in the back row, and a girl in the middle row. Draco remembered when he was made Prefect, bought by his father and not earned. He was a brat with a badge and he fully admits it. “Girl, in the middle row, what’s your name?”
Micheal frowned, looking away. “Yeah but the most she’s been able to do is give them detention. Without hard proof of the bullying, there’s not much more she can do. All the bullying is verbal for the most part and there’s no proof when when they do do stuff like burn my books.”
He saw a few Griffendors looking guilty, looking at their desks. He spoke again. “Let me try this again; why do you think Slytherin should be bullied and beaten?”
“I don’t care if you have a World Cup to go to, Mr. Turner, morning detention, with me, tomorrow morning. Everyone else, Carey on.”
Draco pointed to a first year girl from Ravenclaw in front. “You, I want you to start us off, please read the first paragraph.”
She was hiccuping with sobs as he looked her over. The Hufflepuff behind him gasped. “Blimey, that’s a shiner.” Poor Emily had a clearly broken nose, bruise and blood coming from her nostrils, her left eye bruised.
After that they went back to Dracos room, falling back asleep as if it was the most normal thing, Harry holding Draco close and protected.
Draco felt his eyes water, looking away. Harry came over but Draco gently kept him at arms length. “You have class soon.” Harry frowned. “But will you be ok?”  Draco huffed. “I’ll be fine, thanks for your concern.”
“That sounds like a wonderful idea. There was actually a bit more parents worried than students about the stigma regarding Slytherin. Would you care to write a letter to the parents to let them know what your plans are?”
Draco blinked, standing. “There might be. Let me talk to the headmaster about it and hopefully we can get this sorted.” Micheal just nodded. Draco spoke as he unlocked the door with his wand. “Until then, do your best to ignore them and keep your head held high.”
“I don’t mean that in a bad way. It’s…it’s nice to see you actually. I was worried what happened to you after the war.”
“No. He didn’t. Even though he favored his house, he rarely showed any kind of affection or much pride.”
“Oh, sorry sir-wait, you look familiar, what’s your name?” Neville asked innocently. Draco cleared his throat, adjusting his large glasses. “It’s Albert Anderson.”
Thankfully McGonagall saved Draco by coming over. “Professor Trelawney, this is our new potions Professor and head of Slytherin, Albert Anderson. “ Professor Trelawney smiled dreamily. “So nice to meet a fellow Professor.”
Betty frowned, feeling confused. “I have to ask Professor, why are we learning a patronus spell if we’re facing a bogart? A patronus spell is only used on dementors.”
Harry nodded. “Of course.” He took his shoes off, glasses and jacket before getting under the covers and holding Draco close, feeling how thin he’s gotten.
They woke together and got ready for the day. When they walked out of the same room, one of the Slytherin 4
McGonagall glared softly back. “And if it backfires? If we get evidence but the parents and ministry wonder how we got it? Slytherin house already has a bad reputation, I don’t want to make it worse by breaking the rules. You will not use any listening charm without my strict permission, is that clear, Professor?”
Harry took that information and stored it away, that was not the normal conversation he got from students when they arrive from potions. He turned. “Alright, I trust everyone thought long and hard on the happy memory you want to use?”
But when they we’re starting the sorting hat, many of the kids became scared. Many of them mummering they don’t want Slytherin.
He sighed as he got to his desk. “Does anyone know what happened today?”  One of his own answered. “Is this about Emily?”
She shrugged. “I’m honestly not sure, it’s never been asked before. I’ll look into it and will let you know. For now, please, continue class. I believe potions started ten minutes ago.”
A child in the front row spoke before raising their hand. “You won’t kill them will you?” There were a lot of chuckles. Even Draco chcukled weakly. “No. Of course not.” Draco came close and kneeled down to the 1at year. “What’s your name?”
At the start of potions many of the kids were already sat in their seats. Many of them mummering, wondering where their Professor is.
Draco crossed his arms. “Not a surprise, Griffendor has always been passionate, it’s where that passion goes is the problem.”
Draco stopped himself, feeling his eyes water. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to dump that on you.” He took a big gulp of his drink, letting the burn distract and ground him.
year. And…it hasn’t been kind. Immediately after the war when school started again, most of Slytherin house was bullied in some form or another. Mostly shunned, thinking we’re all evil. The ministry even wanted to get rid of the house all together but too many people opposed it, stating too many kids would be put in ill-placed houses and wouldn’t benefit being forced to a house that wasn’t for them.” The bullying has slowed but it’s still not great. Gryffindor bullying us the most, at least more actively.”
He didn’t have an appetite, leaving the table quickly, along with the crunched up letter and confused and worried Harry Potter.
“Because it would have done Dumbledore a great disservice. He made this school known for second chances. Now do you need any help getting the classroom set up to your liking?”
The mug, After the sugar was put in, floated over to him. He held it. She sipped her tea before speaking. “Yes. I am aware but right now all we have is someone’s word against another. I don’t have actual proof how serious it is to suspend or expel anyone. I’ve given out detentions but they don’t seem to do much.”
“I did. But I started dreading going to work. I started dreading having to get into a fight with another bad guy. I realized I was tired of being the so called
He then smelled blood. Started to see it seep through the cracks in her small fingers. He gently but forcibly brought her hands back from her face.
The boy smiled. “Thank you sir-“ he was cut off as the door to potions opened and closed loudly. Draco looked up, seeing one of his first years, a girl, he remembers her name is Emily. She was sobbing and hiding her face. Draco rushed over in worry. “Miss. Emily, is everything alright?”
After he cut ties with his family and whatever death eaters might be looking for him, it was hard to live on his own. Without his father's money and name tarnished, he was nearly homeless, no one willing to give a former death eater a job.
The young girl raised her hand. “Uh Professor, you should know, I’m not very good at reading. I have a disability, muggles call it Dyslexia.” She said, adjusting her glasses. Draco glared at her, his irritation was sharp as fangs at his insides. “I didn’t ask you for your life story; I asked you to read. Now start on page 294.”
Harry came back, Draco finishing another fire whiskey, Harry’s own butter beer half gone before he’s getting Draco another drink.
The Hufflepuff boy stood, closing his book and walking over. Draco sighed. “I apologize for my behavior toward you yesterday. I was in a bad place  and I shouldn’t have taken it out on you. You’re essay was wonderful, I’m awarding 30 points to Hufflepuff for it.”
Draco just nodded, his nerves get shocked from today. Getting used to having to deal with so many people and children was so new to him and on top of it the bullying problem is a huge issue that he will have to worry about.
Draco quickly got his tie off and gently pressed it to her nose. “Here sweetie, hold that there, alright?” Once she got it held in place, he stood, gently escorting her to Madam Pomfrey.
She used her wand and brought the tea kettle and mugs over to her desk, the tea kettle starting to whistle as it landed gently on her desk. She started pouring the tea. “How many sugars?”
Draco gave a polite nod to his head. “Likewise.” He said, going along with it. No need to stoke any fires, he just had to get past today.
Draco gave a nod as he took it. “I’ll look it over while you read over the shrinking solution. Get inside.” The 3
“So you think keeping these kids from my class would be fun? Have you told the headmaster about it, I’m sure she’d get a laugh.”
Draco gave a nod. “A logical answer. How very Ravenclaw. Can a slytherin please come up here?”  He saw how scared they all seemed. “I promise, nothing bad. Just an example.” A boy walked up, looking scared. It was Wilber, Draco remembers from the first day of school, talking with his house.
McGonagall continued once Harry sat back down. “And I have great news for Slytherin. Not only do we have a new potions teacher but a new head for Slytherin. I know since the war, the house of Slytherin has had less and less in its walls. And because of the war is why it’s reputation began. But we are aiming to fix that. Please, welcome,  the new head of Slytherin and potions Professor, Albert Anderson.”
As soon as classes for the day were over, he went right to McGongalls office. She saw him. “Hello Professor, how was your first day of classes?” She said with a warm smile.
“I guess that’s true. Why don’t you join me for a drink down at the pub? You look like you could use it.”
The boy sniffled, wiping more tears away. “This!” He grabbed his green tie tightly. “This house! These colors! They’ll never think that Slytherin isn’t anything but evil.”
“She will be. A broken nose and black eye but nothing Madam Pomfrey can’t fix. Does anyone know what happened?”
Madam Pomfrey came over, gently bringing the girl with her. Draco glared at McGonagall. “Still won’t let me use a listening charm? Or is her broken nose not enough proof for you?”
After a bit of shaking Draco woke, startled and with a cry. “No!” He cried out, before looking around, seeing Harry Potter next to him, in his bed but that wasn’t what was on his mind as he gripped Harry’s shirt. “Where’s Hermione?! Is she ok?! Please, please tell me she’s ok!”
He got to the great hall and saw other teachers there, standing about. He saw a few familiar faces but mostly stayed to himself.
Draco walked out of the office quickly, feeling like he can’t get away fast enough. But apparently Harry was faster. “Draco, hey!” Draco stopped and turned as Harry caught up to him in the hall.
“This is true, five points for Ravenclaw. That’s because I managed to talk this bogart into helping me today. He’s not going to turn into your fears, he’s going to turn into a Dementor.”
Draco blushed, deeply before sputtering. “Out of my way Potter!” He said as he charged into the pub.
A ravenclaw boy raised his hand. Draco pointed to him. “Yes. You.”  The boy let out a breath. “The Slytherin house creates the most dark wizards. All of the worst wizards came from slytherin. It’s logical they would end up the same. It’s a corrupt.”
Harry frowned but walked out, unknowing of what to do. When he left Dracos quarters he saw a student go by, looking at the door that opened before looking away, realizing it was him. Harry chuckled to himself, wondering how many rumors thwre would be about him and Draco.
The night staff house elves came over immediately, Harry putting in an order for Chamomile tea to the Professors private study.
The class stayed silent. He motioned for the girl to continue. She nodded and continued her difficult read.
“No! No, not at all, I was worried because I couldn’t help but over hear how your potion students talked about you after class.”
He watched the kids be lead in by a new teacher Draco wasn’t familiar with. Their small faces looking in awe of the great hall and it’s floating candles and starlit ceiling.
“And what happens while we wait for an answer? Wait until another one of my children is hurt and bleeding from this bullying or does one of them need to die before a difference is made?!”
Draco nodded, the last thing he wanted was to be found out. He grabbed his fake glasses and made sure his hair was the color he changed it to, making sure the spell hasn’t faded yet. Harry went back to holding his hand and leading the way to the kitchens.
He frowned, seeing Draco was having a nightmare, mumbling in his sleep, clutching his blankets tight enough to cause holes. “No…no…please…I won’t…”
Draco gave her a look. “Nothing you need to know, go on to breakfast.”  She just gave a knowing smile and jogged away.
Harry frowned. “I just want to talk. Of all the people I thought I’d see back here, I didn’t expect you.”
A knock on his quarters door made him jump. “Come in.” He said, turning away from his vanity and dresser. Harry walked in.  “You ok? McGonagall sent me to check on you. All teachers are supposed to be in the great hall now.”
Harry frowned. “I’ll see you in the great hall, since you can take care of yourself, Albert.” Harry said before he walked away, closing the door.
The students frowned, looking worried..well, at least the Slytherin students looked worried.  The others just sighed, knowing this wouldn’t be an easy class today.
“Well as your new head of Slytherin I promise to at least lessen the bullying. I’m not sure anything can make it go away entirely but heed me if anyone here is pushed to the ground, shoved, called names, or made to feel worthless because of the house you didn’t have a choice in, come to me and I will personally help you.”
Everyone went to their bags and got out the books Draco required for first year’s. He nodded. “Good. Everyone turn to chapter one.”
Harry frowned, holding his hands. “Yeah, yeah, she’s fine. Draco, it’s ok, it was just a nightmare. You’re safe in Hogwarts.”  Draco swallowed the lump in his throat down, his hands shaking. Harry wrapped his arms around him, holding him tightly, protectively. “It’s alright, I got you. No ones gonna hurt you.”
Apparently taking it as a challenge, Draco answers, “Oh trust me. I know what I’m doing.” and grinds against Harry for a moment. Draco pulls back again and resumes his questioning.
Harry cast a muffliato around them and they chatted away. Hermione nagged them about the potions essay until she was satisfied that both Ron and Harry had actually done the work behind it and then pulled her arithmancy book from her bag and began reading. So Ron pulled his playing cards from his bag and Harry and him played a few rounds of wizarding poker.
In his haste, he managed to bump his nose into Harry’s and he froze, momentarily horrified, before trying to laugh it off. “Sorry. Please let me try that again.”
Hannah's turn passed and she didn’t call on Draco, but on Terry Boot instead, who chose dare. One rather bad rendition of the latest Weird Sisters hit later and Draco felt his heartbeat quicken again, but once again he wasn’t chosen.
Draco had taken his chance in Potions only three days after his black-out. He had been sitting behind Harry for the whole term now and it finally paid off. Only 20 minutes into them brewing a topical anaesthetic for minor cuts and bruises (apparently the eighth years were trusted enough to replenish the hospital wing), Draco overheard him complain to Weasley how their potion was supposed to be blue by now. A quick glance into their cauldron and Draco had known what they had done wrong.
“yeah… she’s a great listener and I needed someone to help me make sense of my feelings without judging me for it...” Harry kept his eyes on his nearly empty plate while he said this, fidgeting with his mug.
Harry felt guilty. Even though Draco had never complained about keeping their relationship secret, Harry knew that it stressed him. Knowing that Draco was likely to wait in one of the alcoves for an answer, Harry reached into his bag once more to pull out the map and cloak. After checking that the hallway was clear and Draco was indeed waiting two corridors down, he excited the bathroom.
And Granger was a worthy discussion partner. Her arguments were solid and passionately presented, her understanding of magical theory was quite impressive, especially considering she had had 11 years less than him to learn it.
“I don’t know Pans. I know I was horrible to them so how am I supposed to just act as though nothing ever happened? As if I am one of them?” he asked. Why couldn't she understand? They were right to hate him.
“Mr. Malfoy, I am by no means a professional when it comes to this but I would like to offer my help to you, not as your Headmistress or teacher but as a… confidante perhaps.  You are of course under no obligation to use my help should you not want to.”
Harry had spent some time with Dean in their makeshift common room, watching the other sketch away in his notebook, then trying to hold still after Dean asked if he could sketch his hair to try and get the texture onto paper, “As a challenge,” he had said.
Professor Flitwick finally ended the lesson and Draco nearly missed it. He and Harry had decided to move their practical potions session forward a few hours so that they could finish before dinner. The implication that they could use the evening for some more quality time went unsaid by both.
“You and Potter, eh?” Pansy said, nudging Draco while they were walking towards his dorm. Draco rolled his eyes and then remembered his silent promise.
Claiming that she could not let the students stay a night longer when they were sure to need a winter coat in their dorms, she cancelled classes and let all students leave on an early winter break. The students were given assignments to read up on during that time and that had been it.
When Draco slips out of Harry a few moments later, Harry is still coming down from his high and Draco simply pulls him into his arms, ignoring the pain across his back.
The thin padding in the room vibrates with the impact of their instructor hitting the floor. Harry had seen him fall multiple times by now, demonstrating the correct way of hitting the mat. It’s supposed to be painless and judging from the instructor's face,— when he happily hit the floor again and again — it really was, but the sound... there’s no way that doesn’t hurt.
“Uhm. How about we ask for a place to talk?” Potter asked, voice full of uncertainty, when they finally stood in front of the empty wall.
Draco was almost certain that he was stuck with a botched Magnis Nexum bond. He had found the spell (or as he considered it: curse)  in one of the darker books in the Malfoy library and, from what he gathered, it was supposed to ensure the success of arranged marriages. If cast correctly, it created a desire for physical contact in both bond-mates and the touch of the bonded would even give each person a sense of peace, connection and belonging.
“Merlin, please warn me the next time you decide to simply drink my creations. I nearly had a heart attack watching you drink that.”
Pansy draped her skirt over her knees as she sat cross-legged across from him. She resolutely didn’t meet his eyes. “I kind of have a… date? Or something?”
“I blacked out. I couldn’t get to him in time.” He admitted in a low voice, there was no point in keeping secrets from her. Draco could practically see the moment Pansy’s anger melted away only to be replaced with worry.
Harry leaned forward, hands reaching to cup Draco’s face, and Draco nearly stopped breathing. His heart was threatening to jump out of his chest and heat radiated from the simple contact of Harry’s rough hands to his cheeks. Without properly realising what was happening, Draco felt himself short-circuit when Harry’s lips touched his, sinking his hands into the dark locks and pulling the other even closer.
They would need to tell Granger and Weasel before the prophet had a field day with their relationship, but somehow he wasn’t worried. It meant everything to him, that Harry had finally felt safe enough to go public, and he would do anything to make sure that he didn’t regret it.
They had agreed to meet in the common room after dinner, as Draco had opted out of eating in the Great Hall. That evening would be taxing enough, and after the Morris-incident the bustling hall was exhausting to even think about. So Draco ate in the kitchens and settled into his favourite armchair once he was back in the common room, waiting anxiously for Potter to finish eating.
Another curse escaped Hermione and she blushed a deep scarlet red even though Pansy cackled. “Do tell darling. I’m sure Ginny wants to hear all about it.”
Another spin of the wand and Neville had picked truth before Pansy could even ask him. "Rumour has it that you have a pet devils snare?" She asked and Neville smiled at her.
They walked to the centre of town after breakfast, safely clad in layers of clothing. Their footsteps crunched in the snow and Draco chatted away about some news he had read in the Daily Prophet that day. Harry could only listen with half an ear, his thoughts kept drifting back to the morning and the feel of Draco in his arms. He itched to reach out and take the others hand.
“Actually I don’t. I own everything up to the cottage. This used to be the house of one of the manors gardeners, years ago. The path is the edge of the property.” The calm and nonchalant way he said it drew Harry back to reality. Malfoy still stood rooted to the ground in midst of an anti-apparition ward on his own land and he had the nerve to be calm about it.
“I… I didn’t realise…” Harry drifted off, staring blankly at the empty glass he was still clutching tightly. “I guess it explains a lot,” he murmured.
“They’re archetypes. Jupiter stands for leader, Mars for warrior. The upper and lower differentiate between physical and emotional war.” Malfoy explained absentmindedly, eyes focussed on Harry’s hand. A moment later he caught himself, “Do keep up Potter. Trelawney talked about it last lesson.”
Even though her announcing her actions made Draco feel stupid, he was glad because despite the warning he felt his heart speed up, when she took out the wand.
Draco merely nodded and watched Potter pace a few times until the door appeared. The apprehension in the Gryffindor’s shoulders was obvious even to him, as if Potter expected the handle to be hot. When he didn’t flinch away when he actually touched the door handle, Draco suspected it wasn’t.
Harry shrugged. “I mean I spent some time renovating No. 12 but I only did one of the bathrooms and the second sitting room, so not really much to talk about.”
On the weekends however, he had to carefully craft scenarios where he could touch Potter without the boy-wonder growing suspicious of him. Thank Merlin that Potter was oblivious.
Potter had apparently pulled himself out of his own shock and raised an eyebrow at the friendly greeting. He chuckled slightly and nodded towards his companion, “This little man here”, he answered, bringing the boys attention to them.
The third floor in the west tower had an abandoned classroom which hadn’t been used for at least a few decades, judging by the layer of dust and grime. Draco had cleaned the room and transfigured two of the chairs into a couch. There he lay, desperately trying to calm his breathing.
“But… I used to be such a piece o— such a hateful person. I bullied so many students, and spread so much hatred.” Draco felt his eyes prickle with unshed tears but he didn’t allow himself to cry. Not in front of McGonagall.
including levers and choke holds. “And remember, if anyone chokes their partner out, they’ll have to bring cake to our next training as well as a whole page on the principles of this sport.”
Without taking the cloak off, Harry leaned against him, his head resting on Draco’s shoulder. “I know.”
The same panic reared up in him again and Draco made a mental note to look into wandless shield charms. Still he didn’t so much as flinch as Morris carelessly tossed his wand onto his desk.
2. Anything admitted during the game stays within the game. And I mean that, there will be a modified lip-lock jinx cast before we start, stopping you from ever talking to someone outside of this circle about anything that happened in it.
“Relax love. The students just arrived at the train station and they still need to ride up to the castle.”
Draco lost focus the moment he heard the hissing sounds of someone speaking parseltongue. Blindly he leapt up, whipping his wand out in the same movement. His feet hit the floor and he barely had the time to realize that he was in the eighth year common room and not Malfoy Manor before he took off running. Within seconds he reached his dorm, sprinting inside and locking the door. He curled up on his bed, head in his hands pulling at his hair.
It was most definitely the alcohols fault that Harry mumbled, “Not the one I’d like to ride” before taking his shot. He didn’t even know where that had come from. Grey eyes meet green ones, shock written in both of them. A blush crept its way up Harry’s neck and Draco raised an eyebrow but thankfully remained silent, until…
Draco held a quick introduction —  “Harry, David; David, Harry” —  and sat down. He ordered himself a tea, some bread and scrambled eggs, Harry following suit but exchanging the tea for a pot of coffee.
“Draco! You’re here!” Harry jumped up and ran to gather Draco in a tight hug. “How was your mind healing session?”
Harry pairs up with Jonathan and pins him to the mat within seconds after bowing. He releases him and the dance begins anew. After five minutes Harry had Jonathan pinned twelve times. They’re in the midst of fight number thirteen when Malcolm orders them to stop. When Harry looks up from his bow to Jonathan, he sees Malfoy escort a bleeding Chris from the mat.
“Not yet darling. You are doing so well but I don’t want you to come just yet. Can you do that for me? Will you be good for me?” he whispers into Harry’s ear, letting his hand rest on the other man's neck without applying any pressure.
And he had disappointed Pansy — yet again. No matter how often he promised himself – promised her – that he wouldn’t let her down again, he always did.
When Potter made no move to reach for the wand, Pansy took it upon herself and spun. It once again landed on Draco. He looked at her and the years of friendship paid off as he understood when she flicked her eyes to Potter, brows furrowed, only to moments later watch questioningly between Draco and Blaise. Draco gave a minute shrug at her plan, if it would stop everyone from looking at Potter like a kicked puppy he would do it.
That seems to get Draco going again. He clears his throat and says “I can work with that. Even though your arse would probably look lovely glowing all red…” he drifts off.
The blond shut his book with a small ‘thump’. “Have you finally stopped running then?” Harry felt his cheeks get warm and opened his mouth, but he couldn’t decide if he should apologize for intruding on the others personal space or if he should deflect by reminding the git who had held who last night. He said neither, “We all get nightmares okay? Don’t act so bloody weird about it. I couldn’t understand your screaming anyway, so calm your tits.”
Draco could only shake his head, silent sobs shaking him and making the pain flare up all over again.
“Why did you do it then? Save me I mean. Why risk yourself?” As if Draco didn’t know that Potter had saved him out of compulsion. As if Potter had had a choice in that.
Evening came faster than Harry wanted it to and so he reluctantly made his way to his and Malfoy’s room. He was dead tired.
They met yet again on Tuesday after dinner, Malfoy had said he needed to work on letting his memories become present and had left shortly after Harry cast his own Patronus on Friday. Harry didn’t interrupt the others' concentration upon entering this time. He simply sat down and started working on his transfiguration assignment.
But naturally no one believed him. Hell, he wouldn’t believe him if he was in their position. He didn't deserve the benefit of the doubt, let alone compassion. It was his fault so many had lost their parents and siblings, friends and lovers. It was his fault Edward Lupin (his own cousin) would grow up as an orphan. His fault that the Weasley’s would forever miss half of their iconic duo, and his fault that Harry Potter had lost the last connections to his parents.
“But,” Draco said again, “If we’re going to do this, I think it’s time we talk about some things; unpleasant things”
“For one, we are from all the houses and choosing one would be weird. Plus we can’t guarantee that there won’t be any minors present and I would rather not have alcohol around the younger years.”
In his room Draco threw himself down on his bed. Curled into a ball on top of his satin-covered duvet, the tears finally broke out of him, accompanied by the sobs that managed to find gaps in his erratic breathing.
To the surprise of many, Harry Potter, instead of accepting one of the numerous job offers in the Wizarding World, has decided to study at a muggle University this fall. Despite his recent successes in the defeat of dark wizards and the offer of an accelerated introduction to the Auror corps, our Saviour has enrolled into multiple courses dealing in topics such as counseling, teaching and pedagogy.
It took Draco a moment to understand that Harry was talking about the bathroom incident in sixth year. Draco gently put his hands on Harry’s arms to push him back so he could see his face, “I threw an unforgivable your way that day. I deserve worse than just a handful of scars for that.”
He could pinpoint the moment Pansy realised that he really wouldn’t explain the man in his lap, as her eyebrows went from questioning to angry. Nonetheless, she talked.
And what a fantasy it was, or rather, fantasies. Harry pulling him into a passionate kiss. Harry roaming his hands over Draco’s torso. Harry kissing his way down Draco as he sinks to his knees, bringing Draco’s pants down as he goes. Harry on his bed, spread open and begging Draco to fuck him. Harry gently preparing Draco, slowly filling him with one finger, then two. Harry grabbing a handful of blonde hair, pulling Draco's head back while roughly thrusting into him...
The smell of flour, chocolate and fresh fruit engulfed him and Draco felt at home. He had worked hard to build his own little shop and now, 5 years after opening, his bakery was a set fixture in the neighbourhood.
Near the end of his dinner, Harry’s constant stream of info came to a stuttering halt and he began fidgeting with his wand again. Grabbing another one of the chocolate muffins and putting everything else away, Draco turned to face him. “Come on. Spit it out. What’s left to tell me that makes you so nervous?”
“I forgave you long ago Draco,” Draco’s head snapped up at this, “That’s why I spoke at your trial; you never had a choice about this, and we were all just children — forced into a war that was never ours to begin with. And if you need to thank me for saving you, well I need to thank you for saving me too; for not identifying me at the manor, and for letting me steal your wand.”
Finally Harry looked up. “That’s fair I guess.” He studied Draco’s face for a moment. “How did you know that you were gay?”
An hour later, Draco sat with Hannah and Blaise, both of them pretty drunk and too close to snogging in front of him for his liking. There had been some Truth or Dare proposed shortly before but Draco had had enough forced socialising for one evening and had opted to stay where he was. Apparently the other two felt somewhat similarly. Draco leaned his head back against the cushioned couch and sighed, considering just getting up and leaving but deciding against it.
“Never have I ever fucked a guy” Draco said and swiftly downed another shot, raising the eyebrow again when Harry didn’t move to take his. “Well, well, well. Never have I ever been fucked then?” And despite it not being his turn and despite there being nothing wrong with his inexperience, Harry blushed at the question and shook his head. Draco reached across the table, took the shot out of Harry’s hand. “And yet, you want to ride a dragon. Interesting...” slurred Draco, throwing the shot back.
He sat and still it took him a moment to sort his thoughts, but once he had done so he shook his head ever so slightly. “Okay, Potions. I noticed that you seemed to be struggling with the unusual reaction of the ashwinder eggs.”
“I-.. no, ma’am.” Draco didn’t know what to say, ‘I have been eating’? No. The fingers that were still playing with his sleeves were clammy and his breathing had sped up.
Memories of the previous evening flooded into his mind. After his initial shock wore off he relaxed his tense muscles and continued with his original plan; cuddling closer to Harry he let his eyes fall shut again for a few more minutes.
“What about the Room of Requirement? That way we don’t have to ask Armado for permission and could use it whenever we want.”
When he emerged 5 minutes later Draco was awake too and he greeted him with a joyful “Good morning!”
And Draco did remember sitting in the common room during their first potions tutoring session, and Potter hesitantly asking,
“I know it isn’t any of my business, and you can absolutely tell me to fuck off, but… I need to know.”
The darker man chuckled, “No. Mother wasn’t keen on pronouncing happy news as her husband had just died in a tragic accident.”
Without really thinking it through, he rushed through the door, startling the woman behind the counter.
Draco shrugged and simply slid one hand up to Harry’s head to play with his hair. It was one of the most effective ways to calm him and Draco had the feeling that Harry needed some calming right then. He just hoped that Harry had thought about what his little stunt would mean for the both of them.
Fair warning: there is a mention of past Hermione/???, that is small enough that I decided not to tag the ship, so that this fic doesn't end up on the ship's listing. Check the end notes if you want to know which character she was with before reading or for any possible trigger warnings.
The walk to the seventh floor was spent in anxious silence. Neither knew where to start and Draco’s mind didn’t have the capacity to think on it either.
There it was again, the cussing. It still boggled Harry and left him at a loss for words. Instead of answering verbally he reached for the mead, poured some into a mug and offered it to Draco. The blonde sniffed at it and pulled a face, “Didn’t you mention Firewhiskey?” he asked, after a sip of the mead. Harry nodded and held up the bottle of golden liquid. With a sigh, Malfoy conjured two shot glasses out of thin air.
