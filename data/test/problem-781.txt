Even though Malfoy was flushed an angry red with his arousal and the only thing that Harry could have focused on was said arousal, Harry got the point.
Malfoy’s head was thrown back. His long neck exposed. One hand travel up and down his own torso while the other pumped furiously at his own cock.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione sighed and Ron's attention snapped to her instead.
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice Harry’s efforts and began to strip, making it into a show, and Harry couldn’t believe how lucky he was to be enjoying Malfoy’s body. The blond was all long, lanky limbs, and lean muscles. Malfoy’s belly was taut, his arse perfectly pert, and his cock thick and long. He was everything their society thought a man should look like to be attractive, and he was to Harry. He was fucking beautiful to Harry.
Harry went straight to pinching the pebbles between his finger tips and Malfoy squeezed hard around Harry's cock every time he did it. Malfoy's head was soon thrown back and his lips bitten red. Harry found himself relenting. If only to rid Malfoy of his skirt.
“Come in already then!” hissed Draco, once he was righted on the bed with his legs neatly crossed.
“Oh Gods, Narcissa, this is serious, isn’t?” Snape muttered, pinching his brow. "You're serious, aren't you?"
"Potter saw my cock," Draco burst and fell back into his chair. "He--he made me moan in front of him, I suppose."
“Sometimes,” Jamie shrugged. “Only—“
She said it with the most innocent wide eyes and adoring smile, too. The thing about Luna, she was akin to Severus Snape in back-handed compliments, and Draco admired her for it.
Granger nodded, and Draco stood, gesturing toward the barre.
"I do not know what to say, father," Draco took another drink. “Did you not see something like this coming?”
“When are you going to tell them?” Harry asked.
Granger surprised Draco by laughing. “Lotion,” she said, and Draco made a face. “Sorry. I’ve had problems with other dancers before,” she went on to share, and copied Draco as he added in a few pliés to their routine.
nervous his mother would discover their secret.
“More than,” Potter dove in and crashed lips against Draco’s own. The kiss was not their first, but it felt like it for how little of times they’d actually locked in such an embrace. Their tongues' slid hesitantly together, just breaching each other’s mouths enough to feel the smooth bite of teeth. The slack drained from Draco’s cock as he was once again buried under the heavy rutting of Potter’s persistent hardness.
"I'm lying of course, Theo," Draco replied evenly. "Well, no, I'm not. I did find it a bit interesting until the first crucio but that was really a turn off, I'd learned. The bastard really hadn't been creative enough for me."
Draco’s first plan had been to mimic the potion. He’d looked up all potions that glowed green during brewing which he could find. Then Draco narrowed the results down by eliminating those which lost luminescence or potential after left sitting for too long. His potion was still loud and bright months later.
"Merlin, no!!"
Draco only nodded. Madam Pomfrey sighed. “Here,” she said after a moment of tense silence; she sounded rather soft compared to her normal tone. “I’m going to lay out your options and we are going to sit here until you decide what you’re going to do.”
Draco was huddled with Linky and Dobby under the invisibility cloak when a noise was heard. Two seconds later the frozen trio was revealed to the dark hallway and Draco saw his father standing with the cloak in his grasp, eyebrows raised.
Potter chuckled. “Soft Draco, stop trying to get me in trouble with pointy Draco!”
His mother sighed, and, to Draco’s surprise, she looked grave at the prospect of what she said next. “You intend to give it to the little witch then,” she drawled. “Ginevra.”
“Kay,” Harry whispered back and let him go.
“Well, I say you’ve found yourself!” Malfoy smiled, then quickly frowned. “You know, my--well, now--ex-boyfriend, Patrick, had always been heavier. He had a hard time accepting my affection, and I tried so hard to put up with the constant reassurance, but it’s hard when he gets so angry at me for no reason. Are you like that, Potter?”
"Good. I was trying to give you a compliment."
“No,” Snape snarled, unheard.
Admittedly, dinner was delicious, and Draco was free from any thumping. However, as soon as everybody had their fill, the talking began again. Draco was insulted, laughed at, and asked invasive questions. Anytime Draco responded, Harry always looked at Draco as if he was sad, confused, or disappointed. At least Patrick had thought Draco’s cleverness was hilarious.
Harry sucked in a big breath and decided to just go for it. He stood and kicked his boxers all the way off; his cock bobbing in front of Malfoy’s face with the movement. Harry gently stood Malfoy up and dragged their bodies together, relishing in the feel of Malfoy’s tiny body and sharp angles against his own pliant flesh. Harry brought their mouths together and Draco moaned so brokenly as their tongues touched.
“Yes . . .” his father prompted.
Potter hissed, and effectively cut Draco off as he grabbed Draco by the hair and threw him to the desk. “Good, you won’t mind if I teach you some more then.”
“Certainly, dears.” She beamed at them, causing them both to flinch at the oddity. “Oh, don’t give me that. I am just so proud to see both of you taking this so seriously. Your behavior is certainly a welcomed surprise.”
“Potter!” Malfoy startled him from his thoughts. “You absolute tosser! How dare you sneak up on me.”
"Speak then," said Luna in a tone that reminded him too much of Pansy, only the blonde smiled.
“Off playing in his little potions lab, I’m sure,” his mother replied, eyes narrowed.
“I used a potion the first time and you didn’t even . . . well, yeah, I nicked it from Pansy. I was unprepared the second time.” Draco’s face was on fire as he admitted this.
it, he supposed.
The Slytherin frowned.
“Draco!” the dark-haired man shouted in shock, then quickly took Draco’s offered hand, and brought it to his lips for a short kiss. “It’s been ages. How are you?”
"I'll take your word for it." Ron didn't dare pick up the letter again.
“Not in the slightest.”
Harry had been avoiding the fit blond tosser ever since he’d quit Auror training to become a woodworker. Now that Harry had gained so much weight, he practically ran from the vicinity any time he heard Malfoy’s voice. However, Harry couldn’t keep his interest of the other at bay, despite his own cowardly avoidance. Any time Draco was in the paper Harry read the articles. Harry had been surprised to find out that Malfoy was gay and open about it. The press had gotten many photos of him and his lover, who looked to be bigger than Harry, which was hard when Harry weighed 20 stone these days. Perhaps this knowledge was what allowed Harry to approach Malfoy tonight. Harry felt the need to know if Malfoy had somehow been taking the piss with his lover or if he truly liked the large man.
"I am going to miss knowing what you are truly thinking," his father commented, ice and milk for himself. Draco sneered slightly at the combination, as it was horrid. "You are not the easiest child to please, let alone understand, Draco. I had figured you'd grow up at some point though, and I suppose in a way you have."
Granger eyed the door Jean had left through. “Shouldn’t we wait--”
“You may,” Draco said politely. “But I’m here with my boyfriend.”
Draco could only blink at her for a moment as he pondered her sudden lack of foresight. He opened his mouth, closed it, and finally spoke something that he totally hadn’t meant to say out loud, “how do you keep people out of your home?”
"So, you also knew this thing was in my home, did you, Severus?" his mother asked, snapping Draco back to their conversation.
“Amalgamating the integrals,” Narcissa answered--at the same time Snape replied--
"Draco." His father’s quiet voice sounded broken for some reason.
Nothing too flashy, Draco was sure. Although, for Potter, he wanted to look his best. There lie Draco’s dilemma. In a blur of martinis, movement, and mirrors, Draco soon had a pile of rumpled clothes stacked to his hips and still hadn’t decided on an outfit. Quite tipsy by now, and running out of time, Draco huffed and donned a pair of acid washed jeans and plain cotton v-neck. If he was slumming with Weasleys, muggle attire was sure to be okay. Besides, the tight, stretchy jeans made his bum look great and the black color of the T-shirt made his pale skin stand out.
Huffing, the man stomped off. Draco laughed at his retreating form.
“Insecure. Little. Boys,” Malfoy hissed, pointing accusingly at Harry’s face. “I’m not a cheat, Potter. I might cheat a little when it comes to Quidditch, but I don’t fuck around on my men!”
“Forward?” Draco supplied.
Once secure in a stall, Draco pulled out his wand and tapped it against the device. A minute later, it turned warm again. Meet me at Lindy’s, was Luna’s reply.
Although somewhat expected, no one could have predicted his weapon of choice, as Ronald Weasley had tried to run Draco through with a garden spade. Granger had spent every second since Draco’s advent suspiciously scrutinizing him. Arthur Weasley attempted to lure Draco into a dingy old shed for lock up. Ha! As if Draco could ever be tempted by something stupid and muggle. George Weasley had mocked Draco’s artful bun and in return received a nasty hex. Charlie Weasley tricked Draco into a false sense of security with his kind words, and then thumped Draco on the back so hard he nearly split in two. Bill Weasley ignored Draco completely, in favor of chasing around his ill-mannered child. Fleur Weasley turned up her nose as she daintily shook Draco’s hand. Clearly, the witch was jealous. Even with Veela allure on her side, Draco was much more attractive.
She snorted. “I’m sure you don’t,” she said, fell out of position, and came to a rest with one foot held delicately on top of the other. “Either way. I like my body and I am more than capable of being a partner to someone. You are not.”
"Er . . ." said Harry as he blinked down at his blank notes. He looked back up to Snape and guessed. "Platinum . . ."
“If you’re serious,” Harry repeated.
“Fuck!” Draco shouted. Draco's knees were pressed to the bed on either side of his own shoulders; they were close enough for Draco’s trapped arms to find purchase on Potter’s hips. The boy had faint stretch marks in a few areas, Draco remembered, and was suddenly acutely aware of their silky existence under his gripping digits. Potter angled Draco’s arse further from the mattress and began to pound his prostate increasingly harder upon each new thrust. Draco clawed at Potter’s bony sides as his orgasm began to swarm through his gut. With tears finally escaping his closed eyes, Draco let out a great cry as he came. One, two, three times his body viciously pulsed around Potter’s rock hard cock.
"You think he wears knickers?"
“Oh, Gin—“
Draco remained quiet.
“Your place,” Malfoy said, and giggled.
“Were you talking to Patrick, then?” Harry said, his voice was flat but Draco could see the anger in his green eyes.
“I do not!” Harry said.
Draco poured another martini, but, at the last moment, forwent drinking it. The last thing he needed was to act a drunken fool in front of Ron Weasley. Draco bid Linky goodbye, and sent a handful of powder into his floo. Not two seconds later, Potter’s head flickered among green flames.
“Love bottoming, Potter,” Draco hissed. “Love getting stretched open.”
Draco hissed and had Linky burn the note to the land of the dead (he’d had his fill of forbidden books, thanks). Draco then placed the lockbox under his bed and the book in Linky's keeper, too angry that he'd wasted so much of his precious summertime slaving for a bloody book to even think about reading it. Instead he returned to his potions lab to check on the leaves, hoping there would be something interesting in Bear’s reading this time.
A few days later Draco still felt perplexed by his unorthodox meeting with Granger, but he also felt a little better in general, thinking he and his father were going to get away once more with their lie. Of course, this was when everything went to dragon dung.
“Er, on?”
“You wear pointe?” she eyed the slippers in Draco’s hand and he nodded. “I just got my first pair about a week ago. It is why I decided to look for a wizarding instructor. When I’d read that dancers can start en pointe as early as ten with the right healing spells,” she elaborated.
"Nothing, dear." His father smiled, and Draco copied him. “If Draco wanted to talk to you about it, he would have.”
They found themselves in the dungeons because Malfoy claimed he wasn’t walking up a billion bloody steps in those heels just to be disappointed by Harry Potter. Though when Malfoy had said that, Harry noticed Malfoy hadn’t let go of Harry’s hand or slowed to sneer at him even. In a lesser than great moment, the statement had resulted in Harry pointing a quick swish and flick Malfoy’s way, swooping him up, and carrying him all the way to the Slytherin portrait hole kicking and screaming.
Potter’s mouth slipped off Draco’s cock with an obscene pop and he seemed content to just stare at Draco’s rim swallowing his fingers up. Draco was fine with this, really, as he’d been much too close to losing himself all down the Boy Who Lived’s throat.
Oh . . . Draco thought about that for about two seconds. “Deal,” he said, arms going akimbo.
Well, screw Patrick, Draco thought, Potter is a much better lay anyway.
Footsteps had Draco perking. Expecting Harry, Draco was startled when thin, bare legs stopped next to him.
“Yes, sir,” she said, resuming her descent. “Right away.”
The kettle went off and Draco poured hot water in all three cups, carefully placing the saucer on top of his and Bear's tea for safe steeping; he was confident that Linky could handle her own at this point. A few minutes later he replaced them under the cups and gave both of their teas a dash of sugar, swirling with his spoon just once in each while thinking about the glowing green potion and the lockbox.
. She'd been meaning to ask the headmaster why they didn't study this sort of magical philosophy there at Hogwarts. It was quite interesting. Though, today, it looked like she would have other matters to deal with instead.
"You clearly do, mate," Ron grimaced. "If Malfoy is getting you hard, you are having some serious sexual frustration."
“That’s where you’re wrong, Potter,” Malfoy drawled. “Who said I wanted you to loom over me like some crazed Hippogriff, watching as I toss off? Besides the fact that I haven’t ended things with Blaise what-so-ever, standing there like so you have literally nothing to offer me.”
“Draco.”
“You could—I mean, that is—I could just wait . . . here?”
Draco groaned and used his hands to bury his own face. “Are you really that daft, Potter?”
“I knew a girl could never be so . . .”
“And?”
Even though he never finished, Draco had a potions lab in his flat and still practiced from time to time (mainly brewing Hangover Droughts). However, the potion he and Ginny were relying on for the dash was beyond Draco’s skill set. The creator was a mudblood who had somehow managed to magically enhance the effects of a muggle drug called MDMA.
Twenty minutes later, they landed in a dirty alley. Since it was still early in the evening, Draco started their dash at a pub. Harry wore a scowl as they walked into the dim establishment and selected a table. Draco easily ignored said scowl because Harry also wore fitted black jeans, an untucked green button-down with a neatly pressed collar, and lace-up leather boots. They ordered some cheesy bread for substance and started on shots instead of mixed drinks. Except for Harry, who nursed a pint of lager.
Even after Malfoy slid into the seat next to Pansy and poured himself a glass of water, the rest of the hall was completely silent and motionless. It wasn't until Snape groaned out loud did the entire hall blink as one unit and process what the fuck they just saw.
“He didn't get naked around you?”
“There was an accident at practice. Broke my spine. They could heal me completely, but the breaking point will be vulnerable for quite a while. I’m not allowed on a broom for at least six months.”
"Not a chance in hell," Malfoy spat with even more venom. Harry sighed and listened as he began to shuffle about and rant. "You think I fancy walking around in those things after sleeping in them for hours?" he asked as he pulled up his sock and stomped over to the door. Then, "why? Because you want me to, Potter?" as he slammed the door shut. "Well, I refuse to suffer on your account," he added as came back over and ripped his skirt from Harry's grasp.
They drank in companionable silence for a while. On their third glass, they started gossiping about the others inside. This quickly led to gossiping about the whole Wizarding World. Draco was pleased to find out she’d somewhat shed her fiery temper and gained some serious wit.
“We’ll see.” Draco met Potter’s eyes as he took a bite of toast. Potter sure did look furious.
Draco and Ginny cackled and gave a high five. Latching one hand to Harry’s limp leg and the other around Ginny’s arm, Draco sucked them all back to his place.
Snape smirked widely at Draco and then turned and left the room.
Draco enjoyed two glasses of coffee and whiskey, and a salad with poppy seeds and strawberries. He spent over four hours lounging and picking at it as he read his book and wrote a letter to Pansy. At three in the afternoon, Draco sighed and tucked his things away. Before Draco left, he stopped his waitress and asked her a question.
However, Draco could not practice flying
Ron scoffed at the very idea of it. "Why would you need to torture either of us, mate?"
“Did I say that?”
“What are you doing sneaking about this late, Draco?” his father asked, face blank.
“Fuck,” Draco said. Draco really liked Harry, but Draco would not get himself into another relationship where he had to change to make his partner happy.
Harry blinked at her for a moment while Ron wildly protested the idea.
“Of course not,” Draco snorted out a laugh, perhaps a bit more drunk than he’d realized. “The one thing you should be prideful about you seem embarrassed about.”
Malfoy hurried to straddle the bike and sat as close to Harry as possible, wrapping his thin arms around Harry’s large tummy.
Potter was just as rough as always, while Draco was much more accommodating now, only snapping back if Potter hit uneasy territory - which he hardly did anymore, and Draco was truly very petty about everything anyway. Soon, Potter had worked himself into his next most desired position, between Draco’s spread thighs with fingers up his slick and slackening arse. Draco took all the digits well; he knew so because Potter told him. With one hand wrapped around Draco’s fragile neck and the other working him open, Potter always bestowed the information in harsh whispers; the words let Draco know how fucking perfect, beautiful, and loved he could be when he welcomed Potter inside.
"I don't know!" Harry shouted.
Ginny got up and began to dance even though there wasn’t music playing. Draco watched, enraptured by her weird movements.
"That's what I want to do," said Potter, panting, as he pulled off. "Fuck you, Malfoy. So bad, but I don't even know what I'm doing. I’ve never done anything like this. Is this all right?"
However, in Snape's eyes, being compared to Sirius Black wasn't much better.
Harry did his usual maneuver, dropped Malfoy’s legs, and quickly rolled them so Harry was on his back and Malfoy could collapse on Harry’s large chest if he wanted. Malfoy did, he bent his legs up and squeezed them tightly around Harry’s waist then promptly fell asleep. Harry let Malfoy drift into a proper slumber before he gently rearranged the small body against his side instead.
her clients younger than I. Well, obviously not when I was at school, but--”
With those thoughts, Harry growled, slipped the knickers down Malfoy’s legs, past the heels, and threw them across the room.
“Jeans, and a nice, low-cut blouse?” she replied, and strolled away with his empty tableware.
Draco furrowed his brow and followed the witch into his kitchen.
Draco was more like his mother, in that his father had no problem taking risks. He even found the betting pools the house elves had going to be humorous, when Draco's mother swore they only encouraged stealing and therefore beating. His mother was always thinking before she acted and not saying much, which was why the scene before Draco baffled him to such a high extent.
“Is that – you have a mobile?” Harry said, seemingly in disbelief.
Ginny must have noticed how Draco eyed the tray filled with an assortment of shot glasses, because she said, “he’s scared of the bartender. Didn’t want to make the trip twice.”
Ten minutes later, Draco was in the green study. He didn’t bother with anything fancy this time, just gated in every one of his thoughts. His father thrust a glass of water into his hand and Draco took a sip. He couldn't speak first, he knew that would be silly, but he wanted to say he loved his father then. He couldn't say that though. His father would only think he was groveling or something. Draco would sound so idiotic. Plus, his father might figure out he’d sort of been lying.
Apparently, the boy had seemed to take an 'interest' in Draco at lunch, and then the two disappeared together. Snape had a feeling Potter was up to no good. It didn't seem like Harry Potter to take such a trick too far, Snape knew Potter would never go there, but Snape didn't doubt that he could still very well go far enough to hurt Draco, today of all days.
horcrux--”
“No,” Harry said, taking a step forward and pressing their erections together.
“You heard me,” Draco replied easily. “And it was only a warning to brace yourself, Granger. If I wanted to insult you I would ask how you managed to get all your hair in that bun.”
Granger’s eyes briefly flickered to Draco and back before she nodded.
"Severus, please, sit.” His mother’s voice was sickly sweet. “We could use your help. Honestly."
“I'm not like that,” Harry said firmly. “I don't hide who I am. Just wish more people could accept it. Even Ron and Hermione try to push me to change. Claim its for my health though.”
"Not important, Harry."
“What would I get, Malfoy,” Potter wanted to know, “if I gave you this? If I gave up, for you?”
Draco saw Harry Potter approaching the Slytherin table from miles away, but Draco acted like he hadn't noticed the other until Potter had cleared his throat right behind him.
"I . . . don't know what to say back," Harry murmured and Ron just stared at him, sure he had missed part of Harry's story which wasn't very unusual with his best mate's narration skills. "Y'know, to Malfoy. I haven't written back."
“My chromosomes . . .”
“Yeah, I saw that. Thought it might be an elaborate prank,” Harry admitted.
“You might not get it, Granger,” Zabini started, ignoring the glare his tone earned him. “But everyone in Slytherin knows about Draco. Potter certainly wasn’t the first boy to notice him because of his style, but . . . well, let’s just say none of his previous attempts at hooking up have gone this far, and not for Draco’s lack of trying either.”
"Mr. Potter," drawled Snape, and Harry's eyes swiveled to the front where Snape stood sneering at him. "Would you please inform us as to what color this potion is supposed to be?"
Fucking Potter, Draco mentally despaired. His throat was suddenly wet, wet, wet and he fought to swallow. “Rape—“
Slowly, Draco smirked. “That makes me happy.”
"Draco, do you remember that time you knocked your two front teeth out and we had to . . . lie to your mother about what had happened?"
Instead, Draco said, “yes,” hoping it was what Potter wanted to hear.
“You ready for my cock?”
“Enough, master Draco, sir.” The elf nodded. “Dobby be knowing enough.”
Dobby nodded.
"Potter!" Snape boomed, his tone utterly disgusted. "The potion is supposed to end up a deep midnight purple! Twenty points from Gryffindor for blatantly ignoring my every word!"
“Master Malfoy wanted me to find you, young master Draco,” the elf announced. “Ms. Jean is again requesting the young master.”
Blaise seemed to find his own words amusing and Hermione found herself holding off a wry grin of her own. “Affection?” she repeated. “I’d say it’s more a bit of curiosity.”
“Are you insane!?” Draco shrieked quietly. “And just what will you do after that, Dobby? You will have nowhere to go, I hope you realize . . .”
“You pig,” he spat, and Potter chuckled and vanished the ropes holding Draco in place at the wall. At once Draco pounced, trying and failing to injure the boy who lived. Potter manipulated Draco’s protesting body easily, and soon they were right where Potter wanted: pressed against a flat surface, naked, Draco on his back underneath Potter.
Malfoy was smiling a lot even though he'd spent most of the morning getting teased. Harry was watching Malfoy smile a lot, and neither Hermione or Ron had gotten Harry to respond to a single question since Malfoy stepped into the Great Hall for lunch. Of course, Harry hadn't even realized his friends were speaking.
Draco didn’t know what to say. “I also wouldn’t pick something that I, too, am failing at,” Draco further explained even though he didn’t have to.
“Oh, you wound me, dear,” his father drawled. “Can you not have a bit of faith in your husband?”
“Er,” Harry said.
“Freedom!” Draco quickly caught on to the idea. “I know what you mean! Do you know tonight was the first night I’ve gone clubbing in sixth months! And  I need clubbing! I’m not good at a lot, but I’m great at clubbing!”
Potter murmured his agreement into Draco’s skin, and his hot breath on Draco’s neck somehow chilled the rest of Draco’s body into frozen compliance. Draco waited for the other shoe to drop, though Potter hadn’t stopped his movements. He was still messily making his way down Draco’s throat and chest, doing things beyond kissing that made Draco flushed red and left him writhing. Harry finally paused and sucked in a surprised breath as his lips met with something other than Malfoy’s soft skin. He pulled back, first seeing a blur of black and white and soon understanding it was a black silk bra. The material so thin, but so very dark against Malfoy’s so very pale skin.
“No,” Draco explained, then left Harry stewing as he read Luna’s message. Still need? It said, and Draco smirked. “It looks like one, though. Excuse me, I need to use the loo.”
Draco quickly used the last of his sense to undo his fly and push his trousers around his knees, baring himself to Harry’s probing fingers as much as he could. Hot breath and a wet mouth assaulted Draco’s neck, and Draco swore he felt the lavish touch of Harry’s tongue along every nerve in his body. Panting like a crup in heat, Draco had never felt more submissive as he did then, humping the dirty metal in front of him as he felt his insides magically slick with lube.
“Look,” Draco sighed. “I have no desire to pas de deux with you if that is what you are getting at.”
“You would see Draco--” his mother started only to have Snape cut her off.
Potter found Draco before Advanced Charms, and Draco was ashamed to feel his panties flood with heat at the feel of Potter manhandling him into a nearby classroom. Draco stumbled against the desk as Potter let him go.
Draco slithered his way next to her and pressed the bottle to her lips. “Drink,” he said, and she did. The effect was almost instantaneous and it made Draco remember his first time trying the potion.
“I gave you a choice,” Draco’s voice sounded husky and not at all cold as he wished.
“Mmm, Potter,” Malfoy wriggled, impatient, as he smacked Harry’s hand away from himself, placed said hand back on his own nipple, and then reached to run elegant fingers down the length of Harry’s straining hardness. Harry very nearly died for a moment but got the point.
. Before Snape could have arched a proper eyebrow, Potter had lubed fingers running along Draco's arse and Draco's eyes were wide as they shot back and forth between where Snape stood and where Potter's mouth was wrapping around his cock once more. Though Draco’s body still betrayed his excitement by writhing quite violently with what could have only been pleasure. Potter didn't seem to have any technique as he swallowed Draco down and slipped one finger inside, but for what it was worth, Snape could admit that Draco, at least, was quite taken with it.
“Is that what you're trying to do now, Potter?” Draco said slyly. “Because you don't have to buy me drinks to get me into bed with you. I would go sober and live between your sheets if you would let me.”
“About what?” Harry said dully.
Draco frowned. Surely, they wouldn’t have fired one of the regular bartenders and hired a female. Perhaps they’d needed more bartenders and couldn’t find a hunky gay man and had to settle?
“Draco’s Dash?” Harry repeated, looking skeptically at not only Draco, but Ginny as well.
“No,” Draco said firmly. “Not pathetic. I just always thought you were so confident, even after you’d gained the weight. You never let what people say bother you.”
"Well . . ." Hermione sighed again. "Harry doesn't have much experience in having his own things. Not presents, clothing, or . . . friends, really. Certainly not lovers. He doesn't open up easily and once he does it can sometimes be a little . . . intense. I can only imagine how Harry would act toward his first . . . pretty much everything."
Draco raised an eyebrow at the super articulate Golden Boy. "Well, spit it out then, Potter . . ." he drawled.
“She couldn’t . . .
Although, to Draco’s knowledge, he had no new items. Em had probably stolen them, Draco had figured. Or ate all of it. The bastard was turning out like a younger version of Snape or something. Draco had not liked this revelation one bit.
“No such thing,” Draco chuckled, then bent down to unlace Harry’s boots and pull them off. “Fuck, Potter!” Harry registered the outrage in Malfoy’s voice and opened his eyes in horror. “Warn a guy next time! Shit, your feet reek.”
, Draco thought and then heard a beautiful sound of savior.
“My father will not have this,” Draco spat, rushing off to find his bag and boots and floo his mother.
She was sitting in the library when suddenly a tall, dark Slytherin slid into the seat across from her. She looked up from her homework to find Blaise Zabini sitting there.
“You're delusional,” Draco was suddenly angry. “You think I want what you have to offer me? You’re never here. You can’t give me an heir. All you’d ever do is leave if you were here.”
"Malfoy," Potter started. "I—um—I just wanted to say that you look amazing today."
“Why?” he rasped. “You didn’t have to explain . . . I never even thought about . . .”
"Come now," Draco chuckled at the irate wizard. "Luna's made tea."
Draco didn’t have any warning before he came, he just cried out, his cum shooting across Potter’s belly. Every single one of Draco’s muscles were involuntarily stiff again, but this time it was with pleasure. There was only a glowing high and Potter’s hard cock that was still somehow slamming into him.
Potter swiftly took his place pressed up against Draco’s chest. His steady heartbeat made Draco seem like a frightened rabbit. One callused hand settled its way around Draco’s throat, blended together like warm putty, Draco’s long neck stretched out for Potter’s thick fingers to squeeze. Their cocks brushed, and Draco fought down a vivid mental image - the tawny colored flesh of Potter’s velvety cock sliding against his own.
During the day when he wasn’t at Jean’s studio, Draco found time to draw, work on his casting, and practice divination. Ever since he used tea leaves to help him solve Snape’s riddle, Draco was reminded of his talent in the area. He might not be the best at hair charms, but his Black blood ensured he was excellent in all areas of divination.
Draco had to think quickly. “Listen,” he said, the words coming to him as he thought of them. "I think I could make you a deal, Dobby, that will keep everyone safe. Including you. I just need some time to work it out."
“I trust you,” Draco leaned in close so he could whisper in Harry’s ear. “Anything but lager.”
“Dunno. Haven’t been in a real relationship since Ginny and I spilt,” Harry said. “I don’t get possessive over one-night stands. Mostly they just go home with me because I’m famous, and I still have to get them pretty tipsy for even that much to happen. I don’t expect anything from them besides what they’re willing to give, which doesn’t go beyond a hole. Not going to lie and say some assurance and affection wouldn’t be nice sometimes though.”
Another week passed before something knocked Draco out of his routine. Unfortunately, it wasn't the answer he'd been searching for.
“I know,” Draco agreed. “Don’t I know it.”
“Let’s do a shot,” Draco said as he picked up one of the small glasses. “Then I want to go investigate. Stay here with the table for a minute.”
Harry froze, but didn’t push Malfoy away. Surely Malfoy wouldn’t fuck Harry twice as some kind of joke? Once maybe . . . but twice?
“Okay!” Ginny grinned. Draco made to leave but was stopped by a hand around his wrist.
“False memories are an impressive feat, Draco, but yours need some work,” his father informed.
Free this time, Draco tried to find purchase on the surface beneath him as Potter slid his panties aside and used his swollen head to play with the juicy hole between Draco’s welcoming lips. Draco reveled in the roughness in which Potter was able to take him without preparation. Draco whined as Potter began to thrust urgently.
Dobby blinked.
“But . . . Malfoy,” she said and furrowed her brow. “You are a boy. I don’t think -- I mean, you can’t help having a penis.”
“So, if I may be so bold,” Draco said. “Do you plan to go all the way?”
A few hours later, Draco admitted the night to be mostly fruitless. However, they had found a new room, it had just been empty. Draco added it to his map and went back to bed.
Draco fell pliant between the metal door and Harry’s big body. Instantly, his pores began to fill with sweat again and he could feel his face blushing hot from arousal. The moment Harry touched him, Draco’s blood had began to fill his trapped cock. Now, as their hips banged together in a drunken dance, Draco felt like a steel bat ready to swing.
His mother’s eyes widened, the words seeming to strike her bloodless on the spot. “Without me . . ?” she murmured softly and Draco’s father flinched.
“Yes, master Draco, sir, of course!” Dobby nodded solemnly, and Draco sighed.
"Morning, princess," she drawled as Draco sat up and glared at her. Then, "Potter," she added as she noticed Potter turning beet red, flailing some more to cover himself with Draco's tiny skirt, and shove on his glasses.
Draco continued to nod, his cries growing as quick and rough as Potter’s jabs.
“Don't get your man tits in a twist, Potter. I'm nice these days,” Malfoy said, and nudged Harry with his bony shoulder.
“It was lovely,” he’d replied with a soft smile in her direction, completely dishonest and hating it. “Delightful truly.”
“You yourself just said the spell binds magic, not heart, Narcissa,” Snape said, his tone rather patronizing.
Draco buckled under the scrutiny and crashed his mouth against Potter’s parted one. Potter moaned and deepened it, their tongues meeting and dancing and going home with each other for a fuck. Potter’s hands were on Draco’s neck bringing them closer. Suddenly Potter yelped and broke away.
“I was going to tell you,” Malfoy said. “But I thought you might stay more relaxed if you thought I was still drunk.”
"I think he might have . . . might have been warning me, too. If he was even serious about any of it, that is. Not that I would ever use an unforgivable on him or anything."
Draco vialed the potion and had Linky bring him the box. He poured the potion in the key hole and waited. Moments passed and then there was a silent puff of smoke and the box sprang open. Once the smoke cleared, Draco was disappointed to see that there was only a single book inside. It didn't even look too ancient or powerful, just plain, clean black leather bound. Draco read the note attached.
"I will never let her find out," Draco promised.
“You don’t like the fact I’m becoming an auror,” Potter said at last.
“No, he probably does,” Ginny shook her head. “It’s just . . . Harry thinks my family is perfect. He honestly doesn’t understand how they can seem to outsiders.”
“Er, yeah.”
Draco shrugged and made grabby hands at his satchel that was slung across Harry’s chest. Harry didn’t seem to understand, and brought his whole self to slot between Draco’s parted legs.
Draco was over the moon. He’d just stepped into his flat, having whooshed through Harry Potter’s floo. The smile fled Draco’s face as he registered the state of his living quarters and remembered the fight that had driven him to the pub last night.
Soon Harry and Ginny were back at the table with a tray of drinks. It seemed as if Harry had gotten enough drinks to last them for the rest of the night.
It felt so odd for some reason, and Draco was soon distracted trying to remember the last time he'd hugged his father. He knew he had before yet couldn't remember the last time. Before he'd even noticed that time had passed his father had pulled away and studied Draco's face with serious eyes.
Upon waking up together, with sweat-stained clothes the only barrier between their aching bodies, Ginny and Draco didn’t say a word about their drunken agreement. They just honored it.
"Are you angry with Blaise?" Luna seemed genuinely concerned.
of his parent’s secret rooms. His mother had secret cabinets in the west wing and his father had two hidden galleries in the north wing and some smaller chambers scattered throughout.
“I’m great, my friend,” Draco said. “Anything special going on tonight?”
Draco scowled at him. “You tried to mess up my hair.”
The lithe body under him writhed as Malfoy’s untouched cock jumped and pearly liquid slicked the space between their bodies. Malfoy had a powerful come shot and Harry watched in awe as some of the white substance landed in Malfoy’s open mouth. Malfoy didn’t seem to notice; he was busy screaming as Harry rammed his own come as far as he could get it into Malfoy’s passage.
Potter eyed Draco up and down. Harry took in coal-covered eyelids, long dark eyelashes, and brushed pinked cheekbones. He took in Malfoy's completely obscene version of the girls' Hogwarts uniform. The way the crisp white button down and grey sweater stretched tightly across Malfoy’s broad chest and pointy shoulders. Malfoy’s pleated skirt was all black and fit him perfectly. Though, Harry thought that Malfoy's skirt was shorter than most of the other girls’ plaid ones. Especially as he was sitting, and showed off about four inches of smooth pale skin dusted in cloud white hairs. The rest of his legs were lost to long black socks. Harry swallowed as he eyed the dark, velvety heels on Malfoy's feet. Instead of thin and strappy like the muggle high heels Harry had seen, these were clunky looking, laced up the front with a silk ribbon, and stopped right at Malfoy's ankle.
Draco returned them to his flat, and, as they stumbled into the recently cleaned place, Draco stopped Harry to plant a huge, smacking kiss on his lips.
“I guess I’ll have to tomorrow.”
"You do know," Luna pointed out and Draco scowled at her.
“And now that you are home,” his father had added. “We can begin to plan your
“No,” Malfoy said. “It’s different than what I usually go for, but I think I like it. I bet you can fuck harder than all hell.”
"You do realize," Theo drawled once the creature was out of sight, "that you have just written twelve inches and failed apologize one time."
Malfoy eyed him curiously again, but moved to comply. Once he was fully dressed in his slacks and button-up, Malfoy offered to walk Harry to the door. Harry rolled his eyes and left without another word.
“Malfoy, if you wanted to fuck me, I’d let you strip me down and slather me in chocolate if it would make you happy enough to do it again.”
His father fell still but glared all the harder. “This is all your fault. I’m going to end you if I have one mark, Severus.”
“But--” Snape started only to have his mother cut him off.
Draco fought for his standing position, but it was useless. Potter just grabbed Draco’s wrist and held them harder each time one managed to slip free from his grip. Pressed against the hard wood of the desk, Draco writhed against Potter’s body, and was suddenly aware of just how much their cocks had been touching. Potter took advantage of Draco’s pause, and captured both of his slim wrists in one hand so another could find its way back around Draco's throat. Still Draco fought, but Potter pressed back; he held down even after a violent orgasm left Draco twitching into his odd embrace. Draco was not sure how women behaved while climaxing, actually. He had given it thought, and decided no situation could have been more embarrassing than his own experiences; therefore he still favored his powerful woman persona.
“No, I’ve hexed my hair to hex anyone who tries to mess it up.”
“But he does have a nice cock,” Draco supplied, and then scowled. “Not that that means I’ll let you treat me like shit, Potter.”
“Coffee, black,” Draco announced as he pulled out his novel. The waitress that had barely made it to his table started to back away again. “Wait,” Draco said and she froze. “I want an Irish whiskey, too. The best you’ve got.”
“We can be going now, Master Draco,” Linky whispered and Draco gulped. The three of them had taken several late-night strolls around the manor already and Draco was sure they were bound to be caught (if they weren’t eaten by something (or dismembered by a cursed object). First, they’d searched the library and discovered very little about “Horcruxes.” Draco had then decided to search through the secret rooms, as some of the ones he had found before housed special-looking books (evil spirits not included). Now they were looking for new rooms because none of the ones he knew about ended up having anything of importance that Draco could tell.
“Try again . . .”
“I could see it,” Draco said.
Draco laughed, pleased at the way she stated Draco’s attraction to bigger men.
"--knickers?" Harry finished, a hopeful sparkle in his green eyes as he looked away from Ron and focused on Malfoy again.
"But first," his father began, and his mother gave a resigned sigh, "explain yourself, Severus," he demanded as he turned toward the wizard in question.
Malfoy sighed and whispered so softly in Harry’s ear that Harry had to ask him to repeat it.
Dobby was quiet for a minute before he opened his mouth wide and let out a long spiel. “Dobby be thinking Harry Potter is wanting to escape his home. Harry Potter is being a very sad, sad boy, master Draco, sir. Dobby be seeing him the once when Dobby be letting a letter get too close. Harry Potter is a sad, sad little wizard, Dobby be seeing it!”
“No.”
“Bribed, obliviated,
"And you think Malfoy is your solution?" Ron was still flabbergasted but he wasn't about to try and change Harry's mind this late in the game. Slowly Harry shook his head. "Well, fine," Ron sighed and turned back toward pieces. "Here's Malfoy and here's you--" he paused to place a black queen and a white knight on opposite sides of the board "--first obstacle: responding to the letter." Ron added a few pieces between to represent each problem they may face, including a black knight for Pansy. "Now, here's what I think you should do . . ."
A sloppy pop and, “you sleep like the dead,” Malfoy said, and then startled Harry by crawling up his body until Malfoy’s arse rested against Harry’s cock.
"Potter," Draco drawled without turning. He couldn't have been too sure what the scarhead actually wanted from him. Unlike most of the idiot Gryffindors, Potter was yet to comment on Draco's choice of wardrobe. It was a bit . . . completely frightening waiting for the other shoe to drop. "
“Huh?”
After that, they were a blur of movement as they fell onto the futon grinding against each other. Harry whined like a puppy when Malfoy put his slender fingers on Harry’s arse cheeks and squeezed. He tried to flip Malfoy over to start opening him up, but the other wouldn’t have it. Instead he guided Harry’s hand between his legs and they stayed in missionary position as Harry fucked lube inside of him with two, then three, then four fingers.
“You wouldn’t though.” Potter’s hand tightened. Draco growled. “Don’t try and tease me, Potter! I’m not up for fucking mind games.”
Draco found his smirk as his hands reached behind him and gripped onto Potter’s thighs.
“One with old spells, you know, the
He found the old witch lying on her chaise, eyes closed. “Jean?” he asked quietly, and she opened them. “Granger needs healing spells.”
Silence descended upon the trio again, until Draco cleared his throat and spoke.
“Merlin, Malfoy, how am I not breaking you?” Harry hissed, eyes flicking between the blissful expression on Draco’s face and his thin waist.
Dobby began to breathe.
Harry adjusted Draco’s legs so they were on his shoulders and lined himself up. He took a big breath before sliding balls deep in Draco’s wanton arse. Draco didn’t seem to be in pain, but he also didn’t seem capable of forming words. Harry just went for it like he normally did, and fucked Draco as hard and deep as he could. Draco’s moans steadily turned into screams, and when Harry grabbed onto his thin hips to keep him from sliding away, Draco’s climax startled Harry into his own.
“Draco!” Luna greeted. “You’ve brought friends. How lovely!”
"But how can be sure what Pansy said to Harry? How will you know what to write?" Luna questioned, brow furrowed in wonder.
"Ah," started Theo knowingly, "so you've stuck Pansy on him."
“Do not move, Lucius,” Snape snapped. “She hasn’t gone very deep it seems, but there still might be a chance of scarring if we do not do this correctly.”
Unfortunately for Snape, this was not likewise.
Malfoy’s hands were everywhere, undoing Harry far quicker than the feel of Malfoy’s tight passage. First Malfoy stroked Harry’s shoulders and neck. Then Malfoy flicked Harry’s nipples before taking a hand full of each peck and squeezing. Last he seemed content to put Harry to death by massaging long fingers into the fat and muscle of Harry’s belly. Malfoy finally relented, and Harry found he could open his eyes again. Although the sight that greeted him was so erotic he had to bite his own tongue to avoid both screaming and orgasming.
Draco had only blinked. He had been unconscious for his birthday, he’d realized this on the train when Pansy asked him if he’d truly enjoyed her present.
Draco fought to make his mind as clear as possible for everything except blind panic as he had already met his father’s eyes long enough to be invaded.
"No, actually." Draco cringed. "Son, I just
“How did I treat you badly, Draco?” Harry growled. “You’re the one who snuck out here and got completely plastered with Ginny!”
“Draco hasn’t actually ever gotten another boy in his bed,” Zabini elaborated. "Every time he manages to catch one they figure out that he’s still Draco Malfoy before things can get that far.”
They were both standing. His mother had the journal under a spell, floating in the air between them. "Do you really not have anything else to say for yourself?" his mother was hissing.
Then Draco came harder than he ever had in his life. Harry instantly stilled and throbbed inside Draco, who, in his drunken state could have used a few more minutes to thoroughly sate him. Oh whatever, Draco thought, we will just have to work on Harry’s stamina.
“Ah . . .”
His mother nodded sharply. “I can live with that. However, Severus will continue to house the thing. Do I make myself clear, Lucius? You will not be making friends with this part of the Dark Lord.”
Yes . . . Draco needed to figure out what was going on as soon as possible. When he was finally able to step into his room, Draco paced for a moment before steeling himself.
Ginny and Draco were much too wired to think about bed. Back in the living room, sprawled across the couch with their legs entwined, Draco pulled out his last bottle. They shared it.
“Do not even speak to me, you bloody filthy fucking bird!” his father hissed, and Draco’s eyes widened, having only heard his father use such language one other time. “This is all
"Yeah," replied Harry. "That makes sense."
She hooted as Draco attached the scroll and the three watched her fly up the chimney.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry hissed, just as Ron whispered
“Crucio!” his mother shouted, her fury had suddenly clogged the room again, and his father fell under the strong curse, tense on the floor. He stood as soon as she relented.
“You heard me, Potty!” Malfoy said. “You handsome manly men, you think you can push me around. Well, I won’t have it!”
“Hoarding the treasure.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry chuckled. “Most people would say I've let myself go.”
Malfoy smirked at him as Harry paid Malfoy’s outrageous bar tab. Harry rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around Malfoy’s waist to guide him outside.
“Oh, fun!” Luna exclaimed. “I thought you just wanted to stop wallowing in self-pity over Patrick, but I see you’ve found another suitable distraction.”
"That was the floo," Draco replied and stood to go see who was ringing.
“Hah,” Potter said, trying to control his breathing. “What have you been drinking? It tastes funny.”
“Sectemsempra!” his mother swiftly hissed out the curse, and Draco watched as his father fell, blood squirting from his chest. Draco stood, horrified, as his mother walked to the floo, called Snape and just . . . left the room. Draco couldn't move a muscle as the shape of the slashes flashed and flashed through his mind - a sideways
what you said before."
Still unsure, but captured by his lover and former lover’s wide, hopeful eyes, Harry returned in the house to give news of their departure. Draco already had his portkey ready. He had a portkey into his favorite London strip of bars, and one that would return him home. After accidently splinching his ear last year while trying to drunkenly apparate, Draco had taken a few days to learn how to make portkeys.
Potter seemed to take this into consideration, unmoving as he hovered along Draco’s backside.
“I don't know, Potter,” Malfoy sighed. “I thought I'd found something real, you know? Something that worked for me, but it turned out to be huge mistake.”
Potter nodded slightly. “Tell me you want me,” he requested.
“Just cause you can grow hair on your chest and gain a little weight doesn’t give you the right to rule my life!”
“What’s so funny?” Harry asked he set their drinks down and reclaimed his seat. Harry’s arm slid slyly along the back of Draco’s chair and Draco had to use the small amount of sober he had left to keep from purring at the handsome man.
“Come on, Harry,” Draco said breathily. “You’re not one of those guys who can’t take no for answer, are you?”
Ron just stared at him for a moment. "Fine . . . if what you say is true, that means it's just Malfoy? A wizard who claimed to letting You Know Who bugger him!"
“Okay, maybe,” Harry admitted sheepishly. “But not like you think . . . not about Voldemort and shit.”
“I can do this all night!” his father shouted, standing tall once more.
“What?” Harry eventually whispered.
When Draco woke in the morning he was still a girl. He took a bit longer on his morning routine when he paused to apply makeup, therefore he strode into the Great Hall late. Pansy rolled her eyes at him. She had wanted Draco to go to Madam Pomfrey last night. Draco scowled at her, but made to join her side at the breakfast table. He had a plan for Potter, and he wouldn’t let Pansy’s attitude ruin it.
“She,” Harry emphasized. “Wore a tiny little golden bikini and was awfully . . . touchy.”
Harry waved their mess away, and then Draco stumbled out of the tiny stall with a huge grin eating his face. Draco hopped up on the sink, world spinning as he came down from the sweet high Harry had induced.
Linky and Dobby were both helping prepare the manor for Draco’s birthday party or he would have made one of them occupy him.
a certain member of the Wizengamot into accepting that Gods awful Muggle Protection Act.”
Despite the awkward situation, Draco beamed at him. “Thank you, father.”
“I never said you did,” Malfoy spat. “He did though. Told me I was a slut. Nobody calls me a slut!”
“You’re a whore aren’t you, Malfoy?” Potter growled. “You did this just because you love cock.”
“Sleep time, you mean,” Draco slurred, feeling quite tired suddenly.
? No,” Draco answered, pouting. “Harry
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled, blushing. “Sometimes too hard.”
Malfoy paused, seemed to contemplate, then all at once began to move. Harry took in the compromising position with escalating shock. Feet tucked under his arse, Malfoy used one hand hold his cheeks apart and the other to lift his sack out of the way. Hairless and pinked, Harry couldn’t quite believe what he was staring at.
Harry let him take the clothing but quickly snatched up Malfoy instead and pulled him back on the bed. "Shut up," Harry grumbled as Malfoy wriggled around and huffed but just managed to get himself more tangled up with Harry's limbs. "I don't care about the heels, you stupid git," Harry sort of lied. "Just your skin," he continued, which was much truer somehow. "I liked seeing it."
“Definitely.”
"Yes, the hum was quite loud," Luna nodded in agreement. "I figured you were most upset."
“I’m sorry to pull you away from your other duties, but I’m sure Mistress Narcissa will understand. You are my house elf.”
“No!” Draco shouted and then quickly checked himself. “I just . . . I don’t know.”
“Yes,” Draco said. “I require your services.”
, or . . . a perfect
Draco looked away from her serious face and instantly thought of Harry’s heart-shaped one. He could not kill Harry’s baby. Harry’s baby could be Draco’s only chance to keep Harry around for longer. Maybe a baby would even keep Potter from joining the Auror department.
“We are not going back to that same, old argument,” his mother hissed, drawing her wand.
“Oh, yes,” Draco’s father chuckled the same instant.
"Seriously," his father hissed. "Just had to mark me, you Gods awful sadist."
“I never stopped you physically,” Draco went on. “I didn’t even ride you, Potter.”
Draco felt . . .
“Hi,” Draco greeted.
Potter stared at him for a moment before he began to chuckle gleefully. “You’re alright, Malfoy,” he announced, then turned to Pomfrey. “Do you think we could do the test now and decide from there?”
Draco called for Linky, his house elf. Normally, Draco had her stay at the manor with the other Malfoy elves, to help his parents keep up the giant place, but these were extreme circumstances.
“My leg line, Granger!” Draco spat and pulled her closer to the mirror, so he could point. “One gap has all but disappeared!”
"Draco," Luna was scowling at him, serious like all of the sudden. "You
"My feet still hurt," Malfoy said with a halfhearted sneer . . . and to Draco's surprise Harry Potter happily rubbed them until they didn't.
Draco slumped into a chair and suddenly wanted to cry.
Harry heard a nasty snicker from behind and his eyes instantly flicked back to Malfoy's face . . . then Malfoy’s thighs. Snape was completely forgotten to Harry for the rest of the day.
One night his mother hadn't come for supper and his father had sent him to bed straight after finishing his own. Curious, Draco grabbed his invisibility cloak and went to spy on his parents. He found them in the black cabinets, his mother’s secret room. The wall passageway was locked, though he could still hear raised voices within. Draco bit his lip, looked to his own bare toes then quietly shuffled away and called Linky to bring him his boots. He stepped with them on and finally he was inside.
Patrick had accused Draco of many indecencies during their time together, but last night Draco had finally had enough. Apparently, Draco was a cheater because he hadn’t fallen in love with Patrick yet. Draco was a freak because of the things that made him throbbing hard. Draco was a slut because he enjoyed the occasional trip into muggle London to lose himself in a mass of writhing homosexual bodies.
Draco, though not officially, was a potions master. He had had all the training, and was set to start his apprenticeship, when the one who taught Draco all he knew had died in the war.
"Yes, father?"
“Granger?” Draco snapped out.
“Oh yes,” Draco assured. “I reconnected with an old friend named Jamie. He—she’s the one who scared Harry.”
. “Why don’t we all sit and I will do the explaining, hm?”
“Well, good.” Malfoy turned up his cute, pointy nose. Malfoy then retired to the restroom and asked Harry to save his seat. Upon returning, Malfoy received his drink and decided to sip it slower this time, for which Harry was glad.
“We have reason to believe,” his father quickly took over, “that Draco was somehow involved with the Potter-Destroying-the-Dark-Lord-Once-Again incident.”
Draco had finally had a breakthrough with the potion from Snape’s game the day prior - he’d narrowed the key down to three potions. They all glowed green before the last ingredient was added then turned blood red, and none of them had any kind of fish or insect ingredients, though all were made with many natural ingredients that would give the potion an earthy taste.
Ron channeled his inner-Hermione and silently counted backward from ten. In that time, Harry opened his mouth, closed it and opened it again.
“But the
"Are you insane?!" The scroll suddenly shot from his hand and landed in Harry's outstretched one. "I can't just let him know I'm squirming over here, Ron! Come on, I thought you would understand better than Hermione!"
“I mean,” Harry started, clearly embarrassed. “I don’t dance.”
She did so, and it was beautiful. This did not change the fact that the line of her legs was still lacking.
Harry could have only swallowed around the thick air, let Malfoy drag him from the Great Hall, and watched how that stupid little swagger Harry had always hated so much made Malfoy's backside sway in a truly unforgivable way.
The second they stepped into the boy dormitories, Harry had been all over Draco – touching, kissing, and feeling everywhere. Harry wasn’t quite sure what had come over himself, but something about Malfoy made it so easy to just . . . want and take it. Ten minutes before, Harry had been worried about sating his curiosity. Five minutes after that, Harry had been worried about kissing Malfoy. In this moment, Harry found himself worried about doing
“I’ll decide when he needs to stop,” Harry said. “After all, I’m gonna be the one responsible for him tonight. Bring him one more.”
“What works?” Harry growled, which caused Malfoy to frown at him.
channels you could go through in which to get permission, I’m sure, but it would be easiest to do all your healing at the studio. Jean obviously has the proper wards up as I have never had trouble using magic here before.”
“Do you feel better now?” his father bit out.
“So, if we did fuck, you would get naked? And let me touch you wherever I wanted without asking for permission?”
it, Lucius? What would have happened had you been foolish enough to let your own son keep this thing for any longer?"
"No. His help is what got us into this mess!" Draco’s father protested at once.
"Shut up, Malfoy."
“What?
“As you should be!” Malfoy spat. “Men like you are all dicks! Think you can walk all over guys like me!”
“What have you done this time, Lucius?” Snape asked once the bleeding had stopped. Draco gaped, not believing Snape could be blaming his father for any of this.
being into anything less than vanilla in the bedroom was completely disconcerting - let alone Harry being the one in charge of it all. "Somehow I have a feeling Malfoy is not going to just let you walk into his life and start spanking him despite the raunchy letter, but . . ." Ron paused and looked his best mate in the eye. "I suppose, if we play our pieces right, I can get you in Malfoy's knickers."
“Oh,” was all Harry could manage.
“Thank you,” Draco said anyway, and reached into his bag to search for one of the potions Luna had given him. With a triumphant trill, Draco’s hand emerged with the sparkly pink bottle and he uncapped it and took a big swig. The rest he held up to Harry’s lips.
"Ma--Mal--Malfoy," Harry stuttered. "Has thighs."
His father blinked, face returning to a calm mask, but his father was never too good at guarding his eyes . . . or so Draco’s mother had always said, and Draco was starting to understand what she meant. Snapping out his wand, Draco’s father banished the journal to somewhere else before taking a deep breath and pulling Draco into a tight hug. Draco was speechless and tense with confusion and didn't hug back, but his father didn't seem to care. When Draco finally worked out that he wasn't about to get his arse stung for the next three weeks straight, he weakly returned his father's embrace.
“Alright,” Harry sighed, waving the bartender over. “I think you’ve had enough. Time to get you home.”
"Like what?"
Harry blinked at her, astonished. Like a cat hunting a feather, Draco’s eyes flicked from Ginny’s angry expression to Potter’s blank one.
“I don’t know,” Ginny cut in. “Harry can be pretty prideful when he’s drunk. Better hope no one picks a fight with him.”
After using the loo, Draco turned around and ran into Harry’s broad form.
“Oh, and Draco,” his father said. “You must have put that cloak to good use these past three weeks. The charms are already beginning to wear. On Sunday I will show you how to fix it. Perhaps you will even be allowed to bring it with you to Hogwarts this year.”/
Harry blinked again.
in his ear.
“No,” he laughed. “But the night has just begun. You looked to need a pick-me-up. Come on. We’re moving on after one last drink.”
Thanks for reading.
“Whatever, Granger. Keep telling yourself that.”
"I do not have time for your nonsense right now, Luna!" Draco pointed out and turned back toward Theo. "I will have to apologize a little."
“Of course it does,” Harry said.
"I don't think you understand, Ron."
In case there is any confusion, this series is strictly drarry. Ginny and Draco don't hook up.
"Yes, I did," Harry agreed. "He still has a scar."
Somehow, Draco knew that his own cock was still hard thanks to Potter stroking it, but Draco barely felt that because he was too busy feeling Potter inside him. It still burned, but it was never really the pain that had Draco wound tight and now Draco kind of liked the sting. The feeling of Potter inside him was still so foreign and strange, because Potter was harder than anything Draco had ever felt, and Draco swore that he could hear Potter’s heartbeat in his own arse. It was strange but good, very good, and all Draco could do for a moment was give Potter’s cock an exploratory squeeze.
"I don't know . . ." Draco started.
This time it was Harry who barked out, “rules, Malfoy?” Harry paused to calm himself and used some of his radiating energy to conjure a chair which he pulled to the tub side and sat in, leaning over Malfoy as far as he could. “This isn’t about those things you like. I’m not touching you. I won’t. This is just about something you and I want. Something we both want to do. Now . . .” Harry flicked his wand and the water in Malfoy’s tub disappeared. “Do it.”
Draco sputtered, but then seemed to realize agreeing would be the only way to acquire more liquor.
“Everything?” the house elf squeaked.
"A snake," Draco said, his mouth suddenly dry. He knew that snakes could be good signs sometimes; mostly when they were stretched across the edge of a cup though, circular in shape. This snake was coiled many times yet stretched across the center. Its head was at the very bottom of the cup, the largest chunk of mugwort, sticking up and basically hissing at him.
"Mmm, black," Potter murmured along Draco’s cock. "So, so much black."
Beside him, Pansy giggled and ignored Potter completely when Draco knew she rather would have been hexing his balls off and done with it already. Draco also knew he was forever indebted to her for being such a support. On the other side of him, Draco sensed the exact moment when Crabbe and Goyle swallowed their last bites of chicken and swelled themselves up to full size. All the other Slytherins looked as if they'd hex Potter if he said one wrong word, which, though the thought was nice, didn't actually make anything better. It seemed Potter was planning to ignore their hostility anyway. From straight across from him, Zabini, Draco noticed, ignored both Potter and everyone else in favor of glaring daggers at Draco instead.
“Owen!” Draco shouted, and the man woke with a violent jerk that nearly pushed him into a neighboring frame. “How are you?” Draco asked, all innocence.
Maybe too great of a time, after all the dash was not about forgetting your woes in a bed full of cock.
Draco was avoiding his mother as well, but that was easy as his mother generally kept to herself.
“Where?” Harry was honestly so dense sometimes.
“When really,” Malfoy paused as he realized he still had an untouched shot in his hand. After downing the liquor in one swig, he continued. “When really you’re just insecure little boys who can’t handle someone like me! Well, I won’t have it, I tell you. You don’t put your sausage fingers on me unless it’s to stretch out my tight bum!”
“Why were you?” Malfoy’s thoughtful, little frown was cute. “I haven't said a mean thing to you since the war, Potter.”
“Linky sees that, sir,” she said, nodding as her huge eyes scrutinized the small space. Well, small compared to the manor, that was. Large in comparison to Potter’s dinky studio flat.
“What?” Snape snapped as he looked back and forth between Draco’s parents with narrowed eyes. “We discussed why Percy and the twins were out, but I assumed from there you would have chosen the most obvious answer: Ron Weasley.”
Soon Harry was snuggled in Draco’s bed fast asleep.
“No,” Ginny sighed out sadly. “I’ll always believe that deep down Harry’s one of the best men the world has to offer, but he doesn’t show it these days.” She suddenly smirked. “Besides, I like Quidditch players. I think watching Harry play turned me on more than snogging him.”
Draco only had a second to realize he’d failed and came before Potter had, then Potter was crying out, leaving Draco’s used passage slick with his cum.
Smiling, Draco opened the door, stepped out, and ran straight into Harry’s large chest.
Jean eyed her speculatively for a long moment before speaking. “You will not cut your hair above your shoulders and you will manage a decent leg line within the next three months. These will be deciding factors in whether or not you can make it here, understand?”
“Surely you know a spell?” Harry hadn’t, until he’d stood in Malfoy’s bedroom and watched him wank two days ago. He said nothing however, and pointed his wand toward the precious furl.
It was time to consult the leaves, Draco told himself again, and tried to ignore the pull in his gut when he thought of his mother. He grimaced but began to ready his mind, still absently wondering if his new skills in Occlumency would aid or hinder his Divination talent. Draco knew that he couldn't be thinking about failure though. He had to be positive that this cup of disgusting leaves was about to grant him the knowledge he needed. Draco could deem them revolting, but he couldn't opine them vacuous; that had been his mother's first ever Divination lesson.
