His doubts seemed to be confirmed as to the perfume he had breathed and the few blond strands he had saw flying when the door closed.
“Then, everything was done naturally and it became obvious over time. I won’t hide the fact that our respective friends didn’t get along right away, as you can imagine, or even approve of our relationship, but we didn’t care what they thought, because we had finally learned to breathe… We were… alive…” Draco blew, his thumb delicately caressing the photograph.
“I honestly thought that you would continue even if I told you not to... This is always what you do..." he insisted, anchoring his green eyes again into Malfoy’s.
"You definitely don't do anything like the others, it's a real problem with you, you know?" he heard him answer, without really wanting to.
Draco sighed while crushing the dried flesh of octopus in his terracotta bowl, hoping everything was going well.
Harry swallowed up the power to lock it back into his being and gradually make disappear the blue glow in his palm by closing his fingers on it. He breathed softly, to recover and walked towards the table to contemplate his success.
With his other hand, he grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning spell before gently loosening his grip on his sex, still hard of pleasure. He could not believe that he had come with the pictures that had crossed his mind.
"Rest now" he replied, concluding the conversation before closing the drawer and starting to walk to the door to escape the irresistible urge to hold him.
Harry didn’t seem to hear him because his magic power was increasing. The various elements present on the table were shaken by tremors and moved quickly over it, the cutlery hitting the plates in small metal noises.
Harry moved his hand forward, taking the cup to turn it between his fingers and make the light reflect on the crystals that surrounded it.
“Aren’t you supposed to find your fiancée, Potter?” he asked, always contemplating the flames that danced in the hearth of the fireplace.
He turned his eyes to the crowd of students staring at him, noticing the different frozen faces that were visibly expecting him to hit Malfoy. Exactly what he should have done if the evil that trampled his heart let him breathe properly.
“I’ve rarely seen someone as unpleasant as you, Potter..., you’re wasting your time, he’s not here,” Zabini replied.
Harry swallowed hardly under Ron’s words but could not stop the flow of hatred, which had been with him for too long now, from crossing the barriers of his lips.
He never would have thought that Malfoy might be interested in this kind of field, but okay, he had come to talk to him so he was going to do it.
This is the moment that Harry’s mind chooses to reconnect and bring him back to full consciousness and regained all the mobility of his body.
He had to clear all this up or he would have a horribly painful headache. He’d hold that fucking ferret and his best friends to account once the meeting was over.
Yet, the last one Harry touched was totally different from Ginny. Because it was that of a man, who therefore didn’t have the same forms, nor the same peculiarities and also because it was
“Oh, shut up!” Harry winced, who knew perfectly well that he took a malicious pleasure in teasing him.
There was only one solution left and he didn’t like it... He turned his heels and headed for the end of the campus. To the last buildings, the opposite of his, where he knew that Malfoy and his friends were studying. He didn’t know which pavilion, though...
Everything had always been driven by desire, the desire to devour the other to punish him for making him feel so much pleasure, to have a moment captured his attention to drag him into his bed, to do all those shameful things he dreamed of at night at Ginny’s expense.
Harry who seemed to be doing better when he had left him last night, had shown himself to be hurtful and distant in his way of being in barely a morning. And even though he seemed troubled by Draco, by regularly squinting on his lips, it was obvious that Potter found it repulsive to be associated with him. Just the way he gauged Draco’s hand, the muscles of his body become tense whenever Draco had the misfortune of simply
Harry stared at him curiously as he moved his eyes across his entire face. He remembered that Malfoy had always had the fine features, but some angles came out sharper when he was a teenager. Despite the cold look he regularly wore, his facial features had softened and made him less inaccessible than when they were children.
"It may be laughable indeed, but it is nevertheless the truth, whether you like it or not, it is what I feel! Now if you're done trampling on what's left of my dignity, I'm gonna let you get drunk on your side and do the same with mine, good night!" he concluded by sketching a gesture in the opposite direction.
Harry felt much less confident now that Malfoy was watching him. Was he really going to do what he was planning?
He could have washed away that feeling of being dirty, of being contaminated, but he didn’t want to use her that way. So he kindly refused and hugged her in one last kiss before leaving her.
“That’s no excuse, you didn’t have to go that far, and by the way, you’ll do me the pleasure of not trashing the living room anymore, Potter, or I promise you’ll deal with me!” Draco replied, glaring at him.
Mrs. Weasley was bringing dessert, a large cream cake, which she had specially invented for the occasion. Harry used a generous portion of it and enjoyed it.
“You didn’t want to fight anymore. Too much blood was spilled in the final battle, many of our friends did not survive, and others were seriously wounded and still bear scars today. You just wanted to change your life…” Draco calmly explained, still standing in the middle of the living room.
Harry loved to find him so he could share their moments with each other, where time stopped. The past was a mere formality and no longer a bulwark between their lives.
Draco could not suppress a smile, observing a slight redness taking place on Harry’s cheeks at this contact.
He only woke up a few hours later, just in time to take his treatment before Pomfrey told him he could return to the Gryffindor common room if he wished.
Harry’s breath became shorter, the air barely passing through his lungs which he felt being compressed under the weight of this information.
He then began looking for the Golden Snitch and blinked his eyes when he realized that even the sky seemed cloudy. He looked around and noticed that his teammates were becoming more and more difficult to distinguish.
He clenched his fists along his flanks before turning to close the door, locking it to make sure he had all his privacy.
Harry couldn’t help but think that on this point they were alike. He was also the centre of his group of friends, although he had always been uncomfortable occupying that position which he clearly didn’t think he deserved.
He paused and reread the last sentence he had just written and passed his hand between his glasses to rub his tired eyes. He then raised his head and beating his eyelids to focus on his view.
“Then you begged me to leave you alone and that’s what I did. Now, I have the distinct impression that you've cruelly missed me...” Malfoy whispered.
Harry was staring at him, frowning, with the look of someone trying to untangle what he has just assimilated.
He first looked for him on campus, hoping to run right into him. This would avoid having to, once again, knock on his door. Malfoy might think he had some sort of hold on him, forcing him to go to his dorm.
that they had to cast nonverbally. Or at least, were supposed to study but, their books were abandoned while they took the sun and breathed the fresh air of the morning.
She then invited them to return to their studies the next year for those who wished and although Draco wasn't part of the group, his parents insisted that he do the same. Because studies were for them, something very important and to which Draco absolutely had to pay attention to his future.
He had turned his back several times, repeating that it was decidedly not a good idea, but something in him, forced him to stay.
“I imagine you’re dying to ask me all the questions that go through your head, but I would like, if you don’t mind, to ask you something else before you do it.” Dumbledore added.
"I would have thought, on the contrary, that you would be the first to throw yourself at the opportunity to mess with me… I'm almost disappointed…" Potter added, pouting his lips, leaning his head to the side.
Harry had a deep grudge against Malfoy, knowing all that he had learned in his sixth year that he had likely left prematurely without time to discover more.
He closed his eyes, breathing deeply to regain a capacity, swallowing his saliva with difficulty, and then slowly exited the room before closing the door behind him.
“It doesn’t change the fact that I’m always attracted to you...” Harry assumed, standing in front of him.
“See you later, Harry, I hope you’ll be well enough to get back into practice.” she added, in a final wink.
So he came up to the pay phone, sighing. He took the handset and composed the famous code. The female voice was immediately heard.
This had made him upset and he ran until he lost his breath towards Malfoy’s dormitory, without really knowing what he was doing or why he was going there.
“I would be tempted to answer, but I would be remiss if I were to harm your fiancée, so I’ll just say it’s original.”
“Like you say, his new hobby is obviously to disgust anyone who sees him snogging to these guys…” Ron winced.
Harry was thinking about the warmth he felt in his heart every time he looked at Malfoy, every time he smiled at him, and it scared him terribly.
Malfoy uttered a hoarse groan and his back bowed as his hands grabbed his shoulders, his head thrown back. He followed every wrist move Harry gave him, openly shouting his pleasure.
“What if it doesn’t happen? If it doesn’t work and I stay the way I am?” he challenged him to answer.
He could not hold a sigh of relief from this crucial information sent directly to him by his heart. Everything would surely come back to normal as he had hoped, even though he was not sure that she felt the same way about him. Knowing that what he was feeling was still present was a small victory that brought him back to the reality he knew.
“Ron, go tell your mother we’re going to be late for the ceremony, tell her we’re going to Draco and Harry and we’re going as fast as we can,” Hermione said seriously.
Theodore Nott, Malfoy’s roommate stood in the doorway and watched the scene, surprised. He looked at his friend then Harry, trembling with rage, fist in the air just above Malfoy who was laughing under him.
A deep hatred seized him and he had to resist the urge to hit that fucking prick who smiled at him with that particular look he could not decipher.
He then remembered the one that was still unresolved and from which they had recovered very little to move forward.
When he laid his hand on it, two sumptuous cabinets appeared instantly, on each side of the container.
“Uh… a little tired but Mrs Pomfrey said it was perfectly normal and I wasn’t doing too badly given the situation.” he replied, didn’t really know what else to say.
Harry even found himself wondering where Malfoy could be, mortifying himself to want to look for him to make sure he didn’t leave.
She kissed his bust while gradually removing his belt and buttons from his pants. When this one was at his feet, she put her tongue on his cock and started licking it. Harry had a startle and let his head go back with a whimper of pleasure.
His eyelids pounding frantically, Harry bit his cheek to avoid screaming, even though the music around them obscured his sounds. It seemed to him that words were coming out of his mouth, he thought he had asked Malfoy to stop, unless he told him to continue… He didn’t know, he couldn’t think, he couldn’t control himself. He was entirely at Malfoy’s mercy and for once he didn’t fucking care.
The old death eaters were all dead or languishing in the dungeons of Azkaban and only a few repeat offenders who wanted to use black magic showed up from time to time.
He set his eyes on Malfoy, who played with the handle of his cup while quietly watching the coffee pot clean itself. He seemed lost in thought and seemed to have completely forgotten Harry’s presence at his side.
Harry searched in the darkness, a “Lumos” at the end of his wand, which he pointed at the various doors of the corridor that stood in front of him.
“I have to go to work today, at the hospital,” he said before raising his metallic irises on Harry. “I’ll drop you off for your first appointment with the wizard therapist”.
Malfoy had already taken out his package of witch cigarettes and began to fry one in front of jaded students who knew that their meal would be ruined. He had put his legs on the table and had slurred in his chair.
Harry’s fury could be felt from miles away, as his magic spread between the walls, sending tingling tickles to Draco’s skin.
Harry had then returned to his office to complete the report he was finalizing before going on a mission and began writing the new one regarding the case that had just taken place.
“I’m not a sexual object, Potter. I’m not here to please you at your will» Malfoy hissed, wrinkling his eyes.
He looked up at the wizard network that was running commercials on the last of the most commercially available brooms. A Quidditch player from the Chudley Cannons team roamed the sky at high speed on a 3.0 Firebolt, streaking the clouds separating under the power of thrust. The following image revealed the prices of the real estate and the most quoted houses currently on sale.
So, they resumed their position, Harry’s legs not totally on the bed, Malfoy above him and their bodies rubbed against each other, making them moan together with so much shared pleasure.
Harry felt he could open his eyes. He had finally done it. He had succeeded in eradicating the evil dreams of his mind. The small spots escaped from his retina as he lifted his eyelids.
Draco had done everything possible to shorten his working day in order to save Harry from being alone too long.
Once he had caught his breath, the urge to throw up consumed inside his stomach, he detached himself from Malfoy and get closer to the building.
Malfoy stopped his movements and turned his head in his direction. He planted his translucent grey eyes in his eyes and laughed bitterly while raising his chin.
If she really knew, she would have already yelled at him and lowered him to the ground without bothering to ask him questions. She must have had something in mind, perhaps had suspicions about his relationship with Malfoy, but should not have grasped the conclusion. So he had no alternative but to deny everything to protect his privacy and to try as hard as he could to cover his tracks.
He took the time to find his breathing, which had become erratic as a result of the efforts to devastate the living room before locking himself in the bedroom and resting on the bed.
Harry frowned and looked through the room. To his astonishment the different students had all gathered to take refuge in a corner in the company of their teacher.
Once fully dressed, he closed the cuff links of his shirt, detailing his reflection in every detail, looking for what he could further perfect to complete his appearance.
There had been a few scathing remarks, but these were strangely reminiscent of humour or concealed compliments.
But how could he hate Malfoy so much and wanted him at the same time? Two diametrically opposed feelings which, however, were complementary and united to form a too full of emotions that Harry tried to keep to himself.
He never thought he’d see him again after everything they’ve been through in the last few years. Especially not because of a story of misplaced feelings and the ebb of hatred against a little prick that they had never been able to bear.
Harry could feel the anger taking over his senses as Ron yelled at him that they had tried to warn him but that he was too absorbed by his magic and by Malfoy to hear them.
"Because I can't decently think that you're telling the truth! So kiss me or admit that you're kidding me!" Draco pronounced, bringing his face closer to Potter until he grazed his nose.
He kept his hands pinned to his face for a moment and enjoyed the rest they brought to his eyes too tired of going through the endless paperwork piling up on his desk. If Harry had known that Auror’s job was so much to fill out reports, he might have thought twice before embarking on this career…
Harry was often in his thoughts, and they were all turned to Malfoy, but whatever he did to keep him away, Malfoy always ended up haunting him.
“Not necessarily, Harry. Ron has already warned his colleagues, he’s with them now, and they’re tracing yesterday to understand how it could have happened” She was quick to explain, full of good will.
Harry rolled his eyes as he sighed and hardly hid the little smile that stretched his lips as he continued to move slowly towards the end of the corridor.
He contracted his lower belly, his face just above that of Malfoy, anchoring his eyes in his own, waiting for his agreement before intruding in him. Malfoy nodded imperceptibly as he tightened his legs around him.
He even allowed himself to sigh, briefly closing his eyes, opening them quickly to avoid the flood of tears that were rising dangerously, feeling all the tension of his body relaxing.
Draco felt his legs flutter under the weight of the Survivor's kiss, tasting the texture of his tongue, foraging into Potter's soft lips as if his life depended on it as if it was what he had always sought.
Harry had squeezed his teeth by sticking his fingers where the spell had struck and cast a powerful “Expelliarmus” who had made his executioner’s wand fly. He then cast him a "Stupefy" that lifted him into the air before landing hard on the wall of one of the surrounding buildings.
Harry stared at him for a few more moments before he felt the suspicious glance of Parkinson so he turned away to focus on his drink.
He closed his eyes, clenching his fists to this painful memory, before reopening them to sting them on the object that he was to completely freeze before the end of the course.
Harry didn’t know how it happened, or exactly when it started, but he had developed feelings for Malfoy. Love feelings that he never thought he’d feel for anyone but Ginny.
"Who talked of killing each other, our friend Potter just seems to want to chat," Malfoy said, without leaving Harry’s eyes.
Malfoy’s face crossed his eyelids and his heart missed a beat, imagining that the last time he saw him was surely only a dream and that his subconscious had completely derailed.
Here, it was no different. When the teams entered the field, everyone cheered them wholeheartedly, clapping their hands and feet.
And he wasn't wrong, Potter and his gang were the first to stop making disparaging remarks to him as soon as they had the misfortune to meet.
“Wha- what?” Did he strangle himself, wavering on the bed where he ends up sitting, bringing back a trembling hand in his hair, releasing the pressure on his wand, lowering it a little.
Draco felt his whole body tense with apprehension. His face was just a few inches from the one of Potter who was staring at him, his hand moving slowly to his to interlace their fingers. He lowered his eyes to their folded hands and fixed them for a moment before lifting them up to Potter’s face, puzzled.
Harry finally blinked several times before turning away his head and narrowly pinching his lips to leave only a thin, almost invisible line.
"Come on, Potter... don’t be a fucking virgin, I know you want to..." Malfoy whispered, approaching him.
Draco then raised his head, satisfied with the result. He was about to take his glass back to finish it, turning his body in his direction, when he crossed two blue eyes a few inches from his face and a mysterious mouth stole a new kiss from him.
The smell of the nightclub and the sweat of the people around him were also not a pleasure and he already regretted having said yes...
As for Hermione, she had abandoned her teenage body for that of a beautiful, blossoming young woman.
“I don’t see how, making me lose my temper and pissed me off, are something to do with your work Nott” he hissed.
“Yeah, he’s the lead of Unspeakable. He’s the one who runs the operation once our team has passed through a crime scene.”
"Here, here, Potter ... What does a person of your kind come to throw his feet in this place of degenerates?" he squeaked, amused.
Harry wrinkled his eyes, desperately seeking in his memories someone who could closely or remotely match him.
Malfoy’s hand on the fence twitched slightly as he stood up slowly, while keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the landscape in front of him.
Harry nodded, pursing his lips and was about to return to his bed when a knock came at the door. He froze and turned his head towards Ron who did the same, with frowning eyebrows.
His last hobbies were like tasting the different cakes to determine the wedding cake where the dishes and delicacies that would be served during the meal. Boredom was an integral part of his day-to-day life, as the current cases were not as crisp as they were and were much more like paperwork piling up on his desk than the physical work he had hoped for.
His heart accelerated in his chest at the thought that Malfoy was beneficial to him during his training, since he had agreed to go further with him. To think, fucking with Malfoy made him more adept at magic and amplified his ability to master his power.
Harry, always grabbed his shirt, felt Malfoy’s hands grab his wrists and pull him until he let go. He felt his arms go down the length of his body before Malfoy took his hands off and backed away again.
Harry had trouble swallowing while his heart was beating in his chest, thinking about what might have happened. To the undeniable desire that had invaded him to have Malfoy so close to him, his lips barely a few inches from his own whom he had wanted to kiss.
“I guess you’re referring to Hogwarts, but I still don’t see who you are” Harry hissed, starting to lose patience watching him beat around the bush.
’ve changed and you don’t even know who you are anymore…” he whistled between his teeth, his fists always closed along his body.
He felt exhausted although he obviously slept for some time, he did not feel at all rested. On the contrary, it seemed to him that his body was drained of all its energy and that tiredness was taking hold of him.
Harry was still in shock from his vision of Malfoy in the middle of an endorphin demonstration with a man. He was even more confused when he realized it had turned him on a little. Probably because he had an idea earlier to bring Ginny back to his room tonight, hoping to do the same to her.
"Oh Harry, Draco are you ready soon?" she asked before wrinkling her eyes, the corners of her lips lowering.
Harry uttered a raucous moan when he was fully inside, allowing himself to breathe for a moment before moving back a little. He began a new movement, his eyes still anchored in those of Malfoy who also stared at him with his dark gaze.
That was entirely true, they had courses to study and that was why they had invested part of the refectory to be able to read and eat as they wanted.
Yes. Lying was his only way out if he wanted to make sure she didn’t look any further until she found out the truth. The terrible truth he’s been hiding for months now.
All these sensations that had stimulated him, when Malfoy had laid his hand on his, the warmth of his palm sending tingling against his skin. If he hadn’t taken it off, he was convinced it would have been burned.
“Honestly, don’t you think he could do that somewhere else?” Ron exclaimed, in disgust as he reached their height.
With his eyelids tightly closed, he took a moment to calm down and breathe softly, his hands resting on his knees bent against his chest. His fingers tightened on his trousers while his body trembled slightly as he tried in vain not to cry.
But now that Harry had experimented, more than reason, he had to admit that the idea of being below was particularly tempting.
Harry smiled at him before taking a Cauldron Cake from the box already opened on his bedside table. He chewed it, letting it melt on his tongue to savour its taste before finally swallowing it.
Dancing among a group of young people, Draco Malfoy exuded sensuality and desire. Harry stood there for a moment and watched him move outrageously, as if nothing existed around him. For a moment, he was the only person visible to Harry.
When they Apparated to the hospital, Potter wouldn’t let him go right away. His arm was firmly wrapped around his waist during the ride. Draco could feel Harry’s chest rising with difficulty, his breathing becoming heavier, while the frenzied beats of his heart were echoed against his bust. He himself could not control his own to feel Harry so close, his woody scent filling his nostrils.
Harry frowned when he did not immediately understand the reason for their scaring and then bowed his head to his hand, noticing the wet spot around it.
Harry froze, completely afraid to go further with her when his desire went straight to Malfoy, even when it was Ginny who touched him. He was stunned to realize that he still wanted her but that it was totally increased when he was with Malfoy.
Harry was forced to put his hand on his mouth to stifle the laughter he had failed to control and bit the inside of his cheek so as not to make more noise and draw attention to himself. Ron had a pronounced startle at his side and immediately raised his head in a light snore. He blinked several times before squinting them and looking at the stage as if he had never dozed off.
Image then changed to indicate upcoming marriages in the renowned witch community. Unknown faces then defiled throughout the announcements until one of them caught his attention.
Draco still held his breath when the kiss intensified, Potter’s mouth pressed more firmly against his, while their fingers tightened more strongly between them. He could see the black lashes trembling slightly behind the glasses, while Harry’s free arm surrounded his waist to bring him a little closer.
“In any case, it is out of the question that this will happen again. I’m with Ginny and it suits me just fine as it is,” Harry cut, without giving him time to add more.
A young man appeared behind Malfoy and sat at their table as if he had been invited. Harry tensed up on the bench and lifted his face off his hand to look at the scene with apprehension. Noah tried to attract Malfoy’s attention by waving his hands, but Malfoy was obviously not inclined to consider him.
“Oh yeah? Then why did you made a scene at their table this morning? “Don’t lie, Harry! If it isn’t him, he’s directly related and I know it!”
There too, he wanted to strike to express his frustration at being set aside for something that concerned him.
He turned off the lights in the open space and headed for the corridor that would take him to the nearest elevator. Once inside, he pressed the level of the “Department of Mysteries” and held on to the railing.
A few stars began to appear, slowly illuminating the clear sky, making the show even more beautiful before their eyes.
"See, nothing left," he said, showing his immaculate hand, a little reassuring smile in the corner of his lips.
When he had arrived in front of the hospital, Malfoy had escorted him to the secretary’s office where he had announced and abandoned him to go to work.
No, he was doing a lot more than that. He was going way beyond anything Harry had ever imagined. And he just couldn’t stand it.
"I thought I’d never be reduced to this with you again, after all these years..." he noticed, sadly.
He had a thought for Lockhart, and Neville’s unfortunate parents, while Malfoy was talking with the hostess, before turning to point him.
His heart missed a beat while Nott’s words were whistling in his ears, with light chills running through his body.
Harry stared at them once again, letting his gaze through the room, falling on a degree of Master of Potions framed on the wall, dated 2002.
Harry frowned and stared at him with incomprehension, visibly seeking to know the reason why they stopped kissing.
, if the guy I’m interested in didn’t have someone else in mind right now, it would probably already be
"But what the hell is it going to do for you to know that it is, huh? What the hell do you care if I'm actually in love with you?" thundered Potter with a loud voice by making large gestures of his arms.
So Harry closed the door behind him and went to sit on the bed. He glanced vaguely at Malfoy leaning in front of his leaf, looking totally focused on his task before lowering his eyes on his fingers, which he shredded nervously.
He took care of washing himself generously with his shower gel, rubbing his hair to massage his scalp, giving a feeling of comfort that he had not felt for two days.
Closing his eyes, his chest contracted to this thought. Everything was so much simpler when it still was. Harry could still hate him, curse him like he had always did.
Harry’s heart missed a beat, he brought his hand holding his erection to lay it flat on the other side of Malfoy’s face, extending his second arm and without letting go of his eyes, sank completely inside him.
In fact, it was mostly Harry looking at him, one of the many things he couldn’t stop himself from doing... It was impossible for him to get Malfoy out of his fucking head! It had become an obsession... He thought he was done with this bullshit since the sixth year he had this obsession with Malfoy.
Harry prepared to receive the same sentence and began to sheath all his muscles to protect himself when a blue bolt shook between them and hit Ron.
The walls of the room were decorated with several wizard paintings, including beautiful landscapes, moving quietly in their frame.
“You speak of a change, if it’s to go from an asshole to an addict, he could have abstained! I had almost forgotten their existence and I would have done without them for this evening… Are we going to eat? I’m starving!” he exclaimed, following in his footsteps.
"So what? Do you decide to get up, or do you prefer to talk about it with them?" Harry asked, pointing to Malfoy’s friends with a wave of his hand.
Just imagining that he was in a relationship with Malfoy in his future life, his present now, his reaction would have been quite normal. But he could not bring himself to feel such a longing for his enemy, for he had never experienced such feelings towards him.
- and remembered the smell it smelled for him. Hermione talked about how it was different for everyone.
“I … I’m not sure I’m doing it right … this is the first time I’ve done this…” he explained, biting his lower lip.
He contemplated the letters "P. S", which had become almost unreadable, for a few seconds and then placed the note on his side.
Harry only held for a few seconds before unveiling his teeth slightly and emitting a little puffed laugh. Malfoy ended up loosening his lips a bit until he displayed a thin smile before turning his head towards the stage.
"Well, then, we’ll stop there, Potter, either you take it and you cross the line, or you leave" Malfoy replied, in a deep tone.
Harry blinked, only now noticing that Malfoy had not taken the time to change, having simply removed the jacket from his suit.
“What are you going to do, Potter? Killing me? Hexing me? Or...” Malfoy blew, his eyes down slowly on Harry’s mouth and then bit his lower lip.
He then unbuttoned his pants, under the gaze of Malfoy who loosened his arms around him, hypnotized by Harry’s moves.
Harry wanted to get back on his way but froze again when Malfoy slowly opened eyes darkened by the desire of his lover and placed them on him. Harry swallowed before the picture that Malfoy sent back to him. He didn’t know if he was looking in his direction without seeing him or if he was deliberately staring at him.
Harry shoved his hands into the pockets of his pants, embarrassed, rolling the pebbles in the driveway under one of his shoes.
He was missing something in Ginny’s movements, something that would make him lose his mind. This feeling of exploding inwardly into a thousand pieces to reshape all at once.
"By Merlin's beard, Potter, you wouldn't be..." he began, lost, before interrupting, dared not go further in his gait.
He found bitterly that Harry was still immersed in the Pensieve, destroying a little more his chances of keeping a healthy mind, forcing on the barriers of his thoughts.
the dream you invented and the most fascinating thing about it, Harry, is that it makes it a full-fledged reality in a universe parallel to ours.””
However, now that the subject had been put on the table, he knew that he could never sleep without the certainty that Voldemort had died during the war. Whatever Malfoy and his friends say.
‘Cause it was the eyes of the one he loved, because it was Potter and nothing had animated him as he had done. As he continued to do… And even then, despite the lack of memories that might remind him of how much he loved him too…
It was cold and the wind blew gently when he arrived in this area in central London where he had often been when his father worked there. He was still hesitating, blowing in his hands to warm them up.
“George and Lee really did an amazing job at the shop! It’s crazy how many customers were scrambling in the aisles to see what was new.” Ron announced, full of enthusiasm.
Harry could distinguish the light blue that covered part of his nostril where his fist had hit. He slowly lowered his eyes, ashamed of having lost his composure so much while he was the only one responsible.
Without really paying attention, his hands, which he was squeezing around his cutlery, began to tremble nervously as he painfully contracted the muscles of his jaw, without detaching his gaze from Malfoy who clearly did not seem to see him.
Harry could not prevent a smile from appearing on his lips seeing the confident look of his best friend.
He took a towel resting on the side of the sink and pressed it on his face to wipe it off. He quickly abandoned it to put his gaze on his clothes, which he hastened to put on.
He saw the muscles of Potter’s arms tighten as he washed the plate, frantically rubbing more than reason on the container, as if he was trying to erase this discussion by removing the remains of his meal.
In a chill, he turned his head again, holding his breath. Malfoy frowned as he listened to Parkinson’s talk. Harry saw him respond in a bad way before turning his eyes at him.
Malfoy accentuated the kiss, embracing his tongue around his own, searching for it more and more, passing it on his teeth, while he moaned in return for having it in his mouth.
It was different from when he was with Ron and Hermione. It had nothing to do with how he felt when he was laughing with Ginny. It reminded him of the first time he got on a broom. When Hagrid told him, he was a wizard. The first time he had done magic intentionally.
Harry froze in the center of the room, slowly revealing the man to whom this strange office belonged.
"Sorry, I didn’t really think about the exact spot where I would wank you, on the way here" Harry added, ironically.
He had to calm down too… He shouldn’t have been so weak in front of Harry. Out of respect for him, for everything he stood for, he had to stay strong. Although he was never very brave, working with Harry, he had learned to make some effort.
Harry was leaning against a tree, his scarf covering the top of his chin, his head leaning slightly forward as he read the Standard Book of Spells, Grade 8.
“Will you have some more roast, Harry dear?” asked Mrs. Weasley, holding a well-filled ladle in his direction.
“But who gave me such an asshole…You’re really crazy! You fucking obsessed!” Harry shouted, pacing the room while pulling his hair. He was clearly on the verge of an explosion.
The edges of his eyelids seemed to shrink, bringing back the last memories to the centre of his pupils.
“Bloody hell, Malfoy, go harder!” he replied, bringing his pelvis closer to his in a sudden movement.
The living room was incredibly empty, not the shadow of a breakfast as the day before had been laid on the coffee table, waiting wisely to be tasted.
He winced to the taste acre of the alcohol which burned his throat and chest where a sweet heat enveloped him. Draco dug himself into the back of the sofa by placing his glass against his thigh and laid his eyes on the extinguished fireplace that he lit by waving his hand.
Harry measured his friends for a moment before loosening his grip on Malfoy, pushing him and tipping him forward.
Because he was thinking about it all the time, he’d been obsessed with it for a while… Having him inside him and feeling him moving inside him.
Harry growled, his eyes half closed and grabbed Malfoy’s shoulders, lifting him up forcefully to bring his face back to his. He barely breathed in front of Malfoy’s blushed and swollen lips for sucking his dick. Harry drew him closer to kiss him fiercely.
He had to admit that sometimes they looked for each other for no particular reason and that at the slightest mistake of one, the other was pissing him off as fast as he could.
“No, frankly, I’d rather be calm, that’s fine!” assured Harry, hardly rising, using the edges of his seat.
Harry ate a bite of his sorbet and stared at Malfoy, who seemed lost in his own thoughts. A question had been burning his lips since he had landed at that time, not knowing how to ask it without lifting a painful veil that he himself was not fully prepared to face.
“If I were being mean, I would say that your hateful gaze is on our former classmates and in particular a blond guy that you have not let go of since they arrived...” Hermione said, in front of him.
Harry took what she offered him, encouraging her to continue, touching her too so that she could feel his desire even if it were not the same...
Potter’s back contracted abruptly, his sentence remaining suspended while a light pink tint gradually covered the top of his cheeks.
“You summed up perfectly what I expected of you. Now, are you going to answer my request or are you going to be stuck in your perfect little therapist suit that doesn’t break any rules, not even for those who share the Survivor’s life?” he had dared, although using Potter’s notoriety had never been in his attention.
Draco grumbled, turning his head to the table to his left where a fountain of Fire-Whiskey was sitting, arousing his keen attention.
Harry turned the handle and Malfoy took his arm and stuck to his back. His lips grazed his ear and Harry froze in the doorway.
Furious, but tired of having to find a new table, he shifted so as to no longer stand under it and finished his glass in a sip before using a new one.
Harry stopped coming and going and stood there for a moment, panting, his hand soiled by Malfoy’s sperm. This one breathed hard against him, his teeth still in the flesh of his neck. Harry didn’t dare move, waiting for the rest, because his brain hadn’t realized yet.
Harry didn’t blink, suddenly breathing hard without really knowing why. The beats of his heart echoed in his ears, not remembering when they had redoubled in intensity and for what reason.
However, a unanimous exclamation brought them back to reality, putting an end to the kiss, stopping their burning spirit from touching each other.
Harry frowned at the lack of respect shown by this individual who, in addition to being bloody late, was no more interested in him than if he had been part of the set that covered the room.
Malfoy stretched a smile on his pink lips for having been bitten and kissed too long while Harry was fucking him.
Draco, panicked, desperately looking for a way to hold Potter. He knew he was lying, it couldn't have been otherwise, they were doomed to hate each other, and even if they weren't, they had to resent each other and not that kind of feeling, right?
Then Harry would put the picture back against the table, wincing against the heartbeat of his heart that instantly filled with the vision of Malfoy’s lips to delight his own, to the warmth down to his lower belly to this simple idea.
She pointed him to a chair to sit on and sat down in the armchair in front of him, joining her hands on her desk.
In the evening, he claimed he needed to rest, his stomach ache worsening painfully. Actually, it was his head that was wrong. He hadn’t stopped thinking about Malfoy all day and his nausea got worse when he felt his fucking cock contract.
Malfoy suddenly took off his hand and Harry heard himself growling to lose this pleasant sensation against his skin. Malfoy then took his shirt between his fingers and pulled him closer to him. Just enough to make their noses practically stick.
“It kills me to admit it, but he has actually helped our department several times in the advancement of several investigations.” he sighed, resting his head on his hand.
Further on, they ended up walking into an apothecary shop that Harry did not remember having seen before and Malfoy went immediately in front of the register, abandoning him in the middle of the room.
"Oh, yeah? Well that’s not what came out of it, you’ll excuse me for being afraid for my ass and everyone else’s at the expense of your fucking face.”
Ron had some information to bring to them, hoping that what he was saying would later prove to be true.
As soon as he wanted to put his hand on the handle, a magical field pushed his arm back, preventing him from accessing it.
He sighed and a little laugh escaped from his lips under the effect of well-being that he felt at that moment.
However, he was not surprised. She had always been particularly studious and even though Ron was her boyfriend, he came second well after his studies. Although Ron understood, he maintained that weekends were meant for us to rest from the course week and not to work more.
“Just so you know, that’s exactly what I’m trying to do!” Malfoy replied, scowling at him before focusing on the book exposed in front of him.
Draco blasphemed by throwing them a bad gaze while they apologized flat while returning to the dance floor.
And like his glass a few moments earlier, all the hint of hatred that Harry had worked, had let it mature for a long time while striving so hard to contain it, ended up inevitably reaching the edge of his lips and leaving without him being able to hold it.
Harry glanced at him before shaking his head with resigned look and passing a trembling hand through his dark hair.
“I'll let you get dressed, I’ll go to the bathroom.” He said, before leaving the room under the ever-frightened Potter's gaze.
It seemed vaguely to him that he had come to scold Malfoy for having given him so little importance in a month, whereas he had pissed him off since Harry had wrongfully kissed him in a nightclub...
Malfoy threw his head back, closing his eyes and biting his lip when Harry encircled his sex and began to move back and forth on it.
Harry licked his lips before pushing on the door behind him to close it. He then went to his side of the room to sit on his bed and tied his hands nervously. He stared at them for a moment and looked up at his best friend who was totally ignoring him.
It was very complicated to think only of her while he kissed her and touched her, whereas just a few days earlier, he had let Malfoy do similar things to him and, to his great dismay, he had liked it.
The breathing jerked, his eyes moving from left to right, unable to calm the frenzied heartbeat of his heart beating heavily in his chest.
Malfoy was going into the room for a reason, Harry didn’t know what yet, but he was going to do everything he could to find out...
Did Malfoy not feel how sick Harry was of having to admit that he was the one who started the thing and how bitterly he regretted it?
He had had some echoes of Hermione concerning his rather developed intelligence, he could see it in front of the stature and superior look that he displayed.
Dumbledore stared at him for a moment, his piercing eyes seemed to pass through his thoughts as if he were trying to guess if he was telling the truth.
Draco never explicitly said so at any point, but he had always admired Harry. There wasn't even one specific thing he admired, simply Harry's whole being. Even when he thought he hated the stupid prick, Draco admired him. Harry just had that personality that forced you to like him, and you could either fight it like Draco had, and hate yourself for it, or accept it and become one of his greatest friends, as everyone else had. Right now was one of those times where Draco was glad he decided to flip his mindset. His only wish was that he could have done it sooner.
He held out his hand for the second time in just as many hours. This time, Draco didn't hesitate in taking it.
He tried to convince himself that that was the only reason for wanting to see Potter, but truth be told, they hadn't really spoken since the first day back at Hogwarts, and Draco's guilt was eating him alive. He wanted to properly apologise for the torment he'd put Potter and his friends through over the past seven years, show Potter that he was remorseful and had changed. Draco hoped that if he could cure Potter of his sleeping issues, maybe, just maybe, they could be acquaintances, or maybe even friends.
Harry kisses him, hard and fast. It catches Draco off guard. He nearly falls backwards from the pure force of it. There's too much teeth and biting and - oh, there's some tongue - but it's their first kiss and it's amazing. Draco grips desperately onto Harry's waist and tries to bring them as close together as physically possible. The action makes Harry groan, and isn't that the most beautiful sound in the whole entire world?
Draco feels himself shake. He knows what's coming, and he could stop it. He could refuse, say no, put a stop it this before it can get out of hand. But he trusts Harry, as Harry had entrusted him, and Draco lets Harry take hold of his left arm after he rolls up his shirt sleeve.
Draco scrambled to resume his reading position before they passed by him. He cracked open his book once more and stretched the spine out until he heard it crackle, then kicked a leg up to rest it over his knee.
Potter was shaking his head before Draco could even finish his sentence. "We broke up a while ago. Realised we were better off as friends. That, and she's too gay to function, and I couldn't keep my eyes off of you - I mean, I'm Bi. We love each other a lot, just not in the way we thought we did. We're still good friends."
Harry recovered with a loud cough. He shook the device in his hand to grab Draco's attention. "We'll do so with this. It's a portable DVD player - just came out recently, too. Arthur Weasley helped me sneak it in."
Draco opened and closed his mouth a few times before he could find the right words to say. He looked back at the pictures, then turned back to Potter with blinking eyes. "You and the female Weasley...there aren't any pictures of you together."
"Perfect," Potter said once he had regained his composure. "I couldn't be bothered getting changed, anyway. Want to come in? We can eat in here."
How the tables have turned, and how Draco loves it. He's whimpering and calling out Harry's name with a desperation for something he can't place. Harry just keeps going, sucking and biting and kissing and marking. Despite the dark colour, despite the nighttime darkness that envelops them, Draco can clearly see the bruises and love bites forming on and around the Mark. He can't help but to let out another gasp.
He got into his bed, pushing back the covers so Draco could climb in beside him. Draco felt his feet freeze to the floor. It was one thing to have lunch with Potter, another to watch a muggle film with him, but to do the latter in his bed? Surely that was blurring the lines between friendly acquaintances and friends, right?
Granger cut him off with a sad-sounding laugh. "You're hungry? So am I. Harry isn't going to be any worse off if we go and get some lunch." She stood up from the sofa and held out a hand to help Weasley up. He took it with a grateful smile, then followed Granger as she nodded towards the portrait hole. "Let's go."
Harry snorts, an ugly sound that sets them off into childish giggles. They cover their mouths and lean into each other for support. It's stupid. They're laughing at things that aren't even funny - they're laughing at their names, for the love of Merlin- but it breaks the tension and fills the air with a bubbly feeling that's much too addictive to try and stop. The cigarette that was in between Harry's fingers drops into the damp grass, essentially putting it out. He doesn't notice, too distracted by the way Draco's eyes crinkle in delight as he laughs. Something about this image makes his heart crack a little, which immediately halts his laughter.
Harry sat up properly. He reached over and paused the film, despite it not having started yet, and looked Draco in the eye. Draco felt uncomfortable and wanted to look away, but he also felt like he couldn't. Or he shouldn't, really. Draco knew better than anyone that Harry's actions were calculated, if not irrational. He knew what he was doing, even if he didn't realise it. Draco wasn't about to let him down. He'd done enough of that for a life time.
"Wonders never cease to exist, huh?" Harry said with a laugh. More sounds of bells filled the room. "I guess I just thought, you wouldn't have asked me to lunch if you didn't want to be friends. And I do this with my friends - yes, even Neville, don't give me that look, Draco."
"What we're yo expecting, Harry? A full love confession? A proposal? Take me to dinner first, geez."
He wasn't given any time to recover; as soon as the film had been set up, Harry was placing the DVD player on Draco's waist and making himself comfortable Draco's chest. Draco stared down at Harry with wild eyes, completely breathless but not daring to try and fill his lungs with air lest he disturb the current occupant of his chest. The lines between friendly acquaintances and friends had definitely been blurred now.
"That would be really nice, actually. I'm absolutely famished." Potter laughed, a sweet sound that reminded Draco of the bells his mother used to hang up around the Manor during the Christmas holidays. "Shall we go down to the Great Hall or...?"
Draco notices Harry's lack of banter. He stops short of him, a few steps shy of Harry's outstretched legs, and frowns. It's the cute type of frown he does, all pouty and confused and stuck-up in an endearing sort of way. It causes a flicker of a smile to flash across Harry's face. That's enough for Draco, and he closes the distance between them and sits beside him agains the headstone.
It only seemed to get worse when he came to Hogwarts. People followed Harry around like lost puppies. That's half the reason why they set up a system for whenever they meet up. You never know who's around the corner. People were obsessed with Harry - or, more specifically, the idea of Harry Potter. Malfoy had fallen into that trap at one point, and eleven-year-old Draco had been humiliated when Harry didn't take his hand and become his friend. He'd never understand the full extent of the day-to-day pressures Harry faced, but he saw how it weighed on him; like now.
Harry seemed to contemplate this for a second before he got up and raced towards his chest of drawers. He fumbled around inside for a bit before he pulled out some device Draco had never seen before.
Potter stepped back and opened the door wider, and open invitation for Draco to step inside. He hesitated for a moment before he threw courage to the wind and crossed over into Potter's room. He could feel Potter's magic as soon as he stepped inside - strong and powerful. Mixed with Draco's magic, the room began to buzz with an insistent hum. Draco looked to Potter and realised he could feel it, too.
"That was disgusting!" Potter said with a laugh, flinching away from Draco when he tried to flick a crumb his way.
The library is their 'secret' spot now, nice and open and totally assuming so everybody is forced to entertain that that's where two of the most powerful wizards go to hide. They arrive together, practically joined at the hip, but far
Draco decided then and there that he was going to be the one to cure Potter of his insomnia. After all, he was a master at potions, everyone knew he was the best, and there was no point in being humble about it now if it meant he could save Potter from himself. There had to have been a potion Madame Pomfrey and Granger missed. If not, Draco would concoct it himself.
Harry noticed Draco's hesitation and let out a sigh. Draco couldn't place the emotion behind it, but he quickly gathered it had something to do with frustration when Harry quite literally dragged him into his bed. They fell on top of each other in an awkward tangle of limbs that they quickly tried to reacted from each other, only to get more tangled. Before he knew it, Draco was playfully wrestling Harry on his bed, rolling on top of each other in a vain attempt to be the one who maintained dominance.
"One second!" Potter called, sounding rather awake for someone who hand't slept in a good week or so.
Draco took the opportunity to snog Harry whilst Hermione was still flustered. The reaction was priceless, although Harry was rather displeased when he received
Harry snorts. "Thought she'd keep her mouth shut about us. I mean, who names their kid 'Mary Kelly?'"
Harry's lips are on it immediately. Draco gasps, not expecting that, and watches with wonder in his eyes as Harry sucks and kisses at the mark. He pours love and soul and acceptance into it. There's no hesitation, no disgust, just pure love. He kisses the area around the Mark, then gently bites at it. Draco closes his eyes and tilts his head back, trying desperately to control his breathing.
Draco found himself in slight awe of Potter. The Chosen One, the Golden Boy, wasn't just bisexual, but he was open about it. At least, he was open about it with Draco, which should have been a surprise in itself. He found himself completely speechless, looking at Potter in a different light. His tongue was completely caught in his throat and he couldn't figure out how to work his mouth to respond.
Draco was sure the muggle film was good. He picked up on bits and pieces and was more than impressed. After years of hating muggle things, of shunning it and cursing it out, he found himself gravitating towards it more often than not nowadays. However, he couldn't concentrate on this piece when Harry Potter was laying on his chest, his head moving with every breath Draco took. He'd let out breathy laughter when he found something funny, and fidgeted when there was yelling or arguing. Draco tried, he really did, to watch the film, but he couldn't take his eyes off of Harry.
"You're right," he said. "It's easy because we've complicated it enough. I'm sorry for everything, Harry, I hope you know that."
Draco slowly makes his way down Harry's face and onto his neck, but nothing without first pulling at his bottom lip with his teeth. Harry is keening and whimpering, and it's all too much but not enough. Draco pours out his desperation as his sucks hickeys onto Harry's neck, listening out for what Harry likes best. He lets out the most guttural moan when Draco gently sucks on the junction between his neck and jaw, which in turn makes Draco moan.
Draco ignored the racing of his heart as he poked his head out of his room. The common room was completely empty, everyone else either in the Great Hall eating lunch for down at Hogsmeade. Pansy and Blaise had tried to convince him to go along, but he'd waved them off with he excuse of being exhausted and needing to rest. Good thing he did, too, or he would've missed such an opportune time. With a final check to his left and right, Draco slipped out of his room.
"Thank Merlin, I am in no mood to get all mushy - wait! What I mean to say, is that I'm thankful for the pass for tonight and I promise to answer any questions you may have tomorrow."
. He so badly wants to be able to hold Harry's hand as they walk into the Great Hall. Draco wants to snog him in front of the first years and hear them all gag in disgust. He wants to leave become his best friend and his partner. He wouldn't even mind making friends with Granger and Weasley. Anything to see Harry smiling.
He walked around for a minute, admiring all the pictures, both still and moving, that lined the walls. There was an absurd amount of Potter and Granger and Weasley, with almost just as many of Potter with the Weasley family. There were a few of Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Potter's parents; some of when they attended Hogwarts, others of the four of them with Baby Potter, and more recent photos of Black and Lupin before they died. Before Draco got them killed.
"I never told you to stuff that tart in your mouth." Potter took Draco's glass and refilled it with the tap of his wand. "Here. As I was saying, you chose to do that all on your own. Never thought you'd have it in you."
"No, no no no, it's...it's okay," Draco found himself saying. "I was just surprised, was all. I knocked on your door expecting a punch to the nose and now we're cuddling on your bed."
"I've had a long day," Harry says into Draco's neck. He remains silent to let Harry talk. "Ron and I got into an argument...over you. I forgot to hand in an essay. The first years won't stop following me around and treating me like I'm some deity. I'm so tired of being the Chosen One. I'm so tired of hiding and pretending."
Granger and Weasley passed where he was sitting and spared him tired smiles, which he reciprocated, hoping they couldn't see his guilt lying between his thinly stretched lips over having overheard their conversation. Neither of them said anything, and Granger even dared to squeeze Draco's shoulder as she passed, so he could only presume he was in the clear. He watched as they slipped out the portrait hole and began walking towards the Great Hall before the portrait swung shut.
Harry stuck out his tongue, successfully rolling Draco onto his back. He slammed his arse onto Draco's hips and pinned him there. Draco couldn't deny that Harry looked quite the vision sitting on top of him, panting and flushed. This afternoon was going a lot differently than he was expecting. Wasn't he supposed to be trying to create a sleeping potion for Harry by now?
Draco freezes - not because he's angry or scared, but because he's surprised. Harry has never expressed his desire to come out before. They agreed when this first started that they would cross that bridge when they (see: Harry) were ready. Harry hadn't bought it up again, and neither had Draco - not because he was against the idea, but because he was scared. Harry Potter was everyone's Golden Boy. Draco Malfoy was an ex Death Eater (still unknown to the Dark Lord, but what he didn't know wouldn't kill him). Everyone expected Harry to date Granger, or some big name Witch who would fawn and adore him. Nobody was expecting their Chosen One to be gay, let alone into a
They do this every time, to try and ward off unwanted guests, and usually Harry rises to the (nonexistent) bait, but he's not in the right mood tonight. His mind has been reeling ever since he got into an argument with Ron, and he's been a strop ever since. Well, Ron's been in a strop, Harry's just felt...depressed. He tries to hide it now; tries his hardest to curl his lip in (fake) disgust, but it feels wrong on his face and he drops it as quickly as he tried it. They're just going to have to deal with the possibility of someone watching them at a later date.
"I...could get some house elves to bring up some food for us, if you'd like?" Draco suggested. He was talking straight out of his arse, but somehow it was working so he continued to roll with it. "You look exhausted and I wouldn't want you fainting on me trying to get to the Great Hall. Can't have everyone thinking I'm trying to kill the Saviour of the Wizarding World..."
enough away as to keep anyone who dares to tell them off for indecent behaviour on their toes. Tonight, Harry and Draco first, they sit in the corner of the library as they wait for Granger - er, Hermione, Ron, Pansy and Blaise to join them.
"I'm sorry," Draco said suddenly. He retracted his hand from Harry's and placed both his hands in his lap. Harry looked at him with confusion, a running theme between them, but Draco couldn't look at him.
Ideas began swimming through his head, so he abandoned his book on the table in front of him and raced upstairs into his room. Bless Professor McGonagall and her insisting on the Eighth Year's having their own rooms; Merlin knew Draco didn't want anybody prying into his work or interrupting him.
"More than okay." Draco runs a hand through Harry's hair, sighs contentedly when Harry nuzzles his hand.
Draco is quick to sober up, caught off guard by Harry's sudden mood change. He leans back a bit to get a better look at Potter, to do what Harry likes to call a 'Malfoy Scan.' Unfortunate name but rather to the point. Harry squirms under Draco's stare and tries to hide behind his arms. He even goes as far as to tuck his chin into his neck. This makes Draco chuckle in his loving sort of way.
The rest Draco understands. Not fully, but he can sympathise with Harry. Being the poster child for the Wizarding World was no small feat. His fate had be chosen for him the second Voldemort killed his parents but failed to leave nothing but a scar on him. He became a household name before he could even speak properly. Parents told their children stories of Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived at bedtime. Even Draco's own mother had told him stories of Harry when he was a child. Everyone grew up and grew old with the hope that Harry would save them all.
He turned away Malfoy’s eyes, leaning on his thighs, joining his hands. Harry lowered his head, staring at the ground, sighing and then closing his eyes.
“I’m not looking at him, at least not consciously, you’re getting your head up for nothing, because there’s clearly nothing to say about it.”
Draco then stopped the fire under the cauldron and grabbed an empty vial and a ladle to fill it with the potion he had just finished. He carefully closed the bottle, taking care to mark, with his most beautiful calligraphy, the name “
Harry remained motionless for a moment, observing the name of his ex-enemy, enlightened in front of him, before taking great inspiration and knocking on the door.
Draco leaned over the pan, lifting the lid to check that everything was cooking properly, and stirring for a few moments before closing to simmer.
When Mrs Rosmerta finished serving the customers to her left, she turned to them to take their order and Malfoy spoke even before Harry had time to tell her what he wanted.
“An exchange of good ways. You want me, I want you and we help each other satisfy the other’s desire” Harry explained, casting a cleaning spell with his wand, before buttoning up his pants.
Malfoy seemed to have grown, he had lost his adolescent features, and the muscles of his jaw were contracted, giving him a rather attractive young adult look.
His elementary spell class went pretty well, and he and Ron managed to come up with something that wasn’t too bad, even Neville had vaguely moved a notebook on the table when he had striven to exercise the magic of the wind.
There was fury in that kiss, desire, and fear on Harry’s side... Yeah, he was afraid of his own actions, but obviously not enough to stop them. Because Malfoy made him lose his sense of right and wrong. Because he smelled good, because it was good to kiss Malfoy and it was hot and fucking sexy too.
Harry had never had the desire to pay attention to this kind of detail about his own person, although very strongly aware that his physical appearance left something to be desired.
Harry stared at the way Malfoy grabbed one of his hips, pointing his sex in front of his ass by biting his lower lip as if to prevent himself from coming at the moment so excited he seemed at the sight of the little pleasure pearl that was shining on the top of his cock.
Harry grabbed his coat, which he quickly put on before taking out his wand to turn off the lights in his office. Small nightlights activated to light the open space slightly even after it was completely empty.
He should have felt relieved of this new hypothesis but strangely, his heart compressed into his chest and a bitter taste dyed his saliva.
He honestly never thought he’d leave Ginny. However, when he went home tonight and joined her in the living room, he was convinced it was the right thing to do. And even now, with his glass still intact in his hand, he did not regret.
It wouldn’t last long, they knew it, but Harry was sure he wanted it, still feeling Malfoy’s hand on him, jerking him off like he knew how to do it so well and Harry would touch him too because he wanted it so badly.
Harry sighed shaking his head from left to right, without preventing a thin smile from adorning his lips.
The noise of the conversations was pleasant and enveloped him in an introspective bubble. The new wizarding television network passed a few meters above the bar and he raised his head slightly to watch the news.
Later that evening, he made love to Ginny. And even if it had been good, he had been horrified to have thought about Malfoy at one point. And that in that short moment, he had groaned louder, before shifting his attention to his girlfriend.
He opened wide his eyes when he felt the familiar smell filling his nostrils reminding him of the scent that he could not determine a few hours earlier.
However, he could not help but think that these improvements were directly related to his feelings and emotions.
Ron had struggled to hold his position and Harry had almost forced him back to the attack site because it was unbearable for him to see him agitating around him as he tried to contain the excruciating pain that was spreading throughout his body.
“It’s okay Harry, you’ve been in a coma for two months and who knows how you got into this state…” Hermione replied, frowning as she pondered to find the answer to her mute question.
Harry was bubbling, had a furious urge to strangle Malfoy, at this very moment and all his body was tending with rage that he had held for too long.
Harry took a deep breath. He couldn’t see how to get out of this situation without Ron asking questions. He saw Malfoy raise an eyebrow waiting for his answer and Ron displaying a skeptical look at his side.
To believe that they were inseparable as at Hogwarts. They still work together and yet each one led his own life.
Ron looked at him and wrinkled his eyes but didn’t linger any longer. Ron was right, Malfoy had become weird with him. He smiled too much since they were studying here.
It was a long time, not without problems, but they had held out, they had resisted and now Harry was sharing his life, an integral part of his family.
"Stop acting like an asshole! It’s the two of us okay? It’s my sister we’re talking about, I know her and I know when something’s wrong"
“Everything is fine, thank you very much.” he hissed, pressing his fork firmly in his hand, the knuckles of his phalanges immediately whitening.
He was terribly aware of his feelings now that he had managed to put words on it. He had tried to put them out of his mind and shut them, but it was like covering the truth with a veil, knowing full well that it remained exposed.
Harry listened with only one ear, with his elbow on the table, his head resting lazily in the palm of his hand as he grinded the food into his plate without consuming it.
Evening at dinner, he got better, he smiled at the jokes his friends told him to make him react. And it worked. So, Harry loosened his hand a little off Ginny’s. And when the group got up to go to bed, she made him understand that she wanted him.
Harry took great inspiration to give himself the courage to speak but only a slight murmur passed the barriers of his lips.
“That’s just my point of view, but from what I could see from reading his mind, no, he won’t have any after-effects” Theo had nodded, a thin smile adorning his lips.
He could have stayed like that forever. Potter in his arms, his breath reaching the hollow of his neck. If he’d allowed himself, he would have tightened his grip against his hip, turned his head slightly to stick his nose on his cheek and dropped a slight kiss from the tip of his lips against his skin.
He let Malfoy approach, and when he leaned slowly to kiss him, Harry turned his head to the side. Then he looked at the ground, suddenly passionate about the lights reflected in it. He felt Malfoy’s fingers lift his chin and looked at him with a bad gaze.
Harry had never had any special desire for Malfoy, nor any attraction to his looks. Much less about his personality.
Inexplicably blocking on this too white skin, whose texture seemed to be so soft to the touch, he blinked his eyes to lift them up on those of his owner who stared at him through the mirror reflecting his fine face and his denatured grey orbs.
Even after all that, he still seemed suspicious. But Harry didn’t want to stop there, he wanted to prove to him how conscious he was of wanting him. He stared his eyes on those of Malfoy, getting his face closer to his, until he brushed his lips.
Especially since by rehashing his erotic dreams, his cock began to harden in his pants and caused a feeling of discomfort.
“This is where you’re wrong, my dear Potter, getting to know the reactions of my patients is primarily part of why I’m employed, as is assessing how you feel and deal with the issues around you” he argued, moving closer to a shelf on one of the walls to contemplate the various trinkets on display.
Ron straightened up on his bed, obviously intending to get up, but Harry stopped him with a wave of his hand.
“What do you want from me?” Harry insisted, getting a little closer to force Malfoy to look him in the eye.
His heart was beating very hard, while he counted the different steps that separated him from the seconds when he would open the door. Where he thought about what he was about to do.
“Get the fucking out!” Malfoy shouted, brutally repelling him before rising in his turn to recover his clothes scattered on the ground.
“Nevertheless, you must continue to see him, it’s important that you keep in mind that although his way of doing things displeases you, it really acts on your mind” Draco added, in a serious tone.
Draco grinned, rotating the wine in the balloon, tilting his face to sniff the scent and then lifted it up to enjoy the taste. He rolled his tongue inside his mouth to awaken his taste buds and laid his eyes on Harry again. He stared at him curiously, seeming to be looking for something that he couldn’t find, or that he never thought he would find in Draco, he didn’t know too much.
When he reached his dormitory, he opened the door of the building in a small squeak and let it close behind him as he climbed the stairs to his floor. When he arrived at the door of his room, he rubbed his hands, which had become clammy with apprehension, on his trousers and held his breath when he turned the handle.
A smirking smile stretched Malfoy’s lips after blowing on the strands of hair that seemed to obstruct his sight.
Draco had repressed an annoyed smile, clenching his teeth in front of his cynical colleague, perfectly aware that he had wanted to make him spit words rather than simply answer him.
“So, you’re gonna fuck with me, aren’t you?” he shouted, clenching his fists, arms still crossed on his chest.
"As your friend just told you, I came to have an explanation with you," Harry replied, putting his hand down and stuffing it in his trouser pocket.
“Well, I guess the placement of the guests will wait.” He replied, stretching an accomplice grin that made Harry’s heartbeat louder without he understood why. “I’ll meet you there?” he then asked, because of his lack of reaction.
"Relax Potter, I’m not going to jump on you, I have better things to do than to suffer the company of a depressed sod" the ex-Slytherin replied, warms up.
His gaze had seemed harsh, but a glimmer of worry had also shone inside, discouraging Harry from further discussion.
“Of course I know. You’re Harry Potter, saviour of the wizard world, and I’m Draco Malfoy, ex-Slytherin, pure-blooded wizard and…” he began.
“But he’s dead, isn’t he? He’s definitely dead?” Harry asked, whose breathing suddenly became more difficult to control as a dreadful doubt seized him.
He had hit Nott when arriving in front of the building, half-snorting him to go and knock on the door of the room he shared with Malfoy, wanting at all costs to talk to him. Malfoy had opened it to him and there again he was not sure what had happened.
He was not sure of what he was about to do, yet, as regularly in moments like this, words seemed to take precedence over his reason and already passed the barrier of his lips.
"It's up to you. If you stop being an asshole and have some control over your temper, there's no reason for me to be one".
Harry blinked, to make the point as his view had become terribly disturbed since he had started drinking and then because he was not sure if he had understood what he had just heard.
“It’s not clear enough for you? You want a user manual maybe? It seems to me that you’re no longer in your first time.” he grinned.
Harry hated him again, that was true. The memories of the teenage Harry had taken possession of his mind at the expense of his current adult body. He had had a more than obvious reaction against Draco’s thigh. A gesture he never thought possible, given the situation.
Harry thanked her graciously, taking back his plate, in front of Ron’s sneer, who tried not to burst out laughing.
Harry frowned before sticking them back to his nose and opening wide his eyes to the decoration of the room around him.
His reflexes were much better today and the teacher congratulated him repeatedly for his exploits. Ron was also not bad, he managed to cast a spell at the end of the third attempt when Harry got there the first time. He had always had a gift for Defense Against the Dark Arts. And he loved it, thinking that he was defending good and killing evil with his own hands.
He was about to let himself go again when one of Malfoy’s hands went down quickly to grab the edges of his underwear.
Hermione stared at him for a few moments before giving him a little smile and nodding his chin and then focused again on his book.
“But then… It would be someone from Gryffindor? How else could he pass the portrait? ” he breathed, his eyes anchored in the Cauldrons Cakes that were now floating a few inches from the office.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows slightly and then very slowly stretched a smirk which he struggled to master.
It was obvious that he too wanted to kiss them. The simple idea that it was reciprocal made his cock bounce inside his pants and he squeezed his teeth while all his muscles were tightening. He kept a moan of pain when his leg hurt him without warning and bit his lower lip when he felt his dick harden without his consent.
Harry nodded his head. His eyes had never left Malfoy, who ended up feeling observed because he raised his head and turned his eyes in his direction, in a look that was both piercing and then burning with desire. Harry swallowed, feeling his sex harden in his pants, before clearing his throat and looking down on his work too, trying to calm his nascent erection while Ron was by his side.
He passed his fingers on the fine writing, tracing the letters before blinking and putting it aside to resume his report where he had left it.
It was absolutely out of the question that Harry would stand there patiently waiting for his “lover” to come home from work while the asshole who had taken away his memories wandered quietly into the wild.
“At the risk of disappointing you, I’ve never had the vocation of following the path of the Dark Lord, nor that which you have otherwise taken. I never could bear to have someone standing over me to dictate to me what to do. If I had to choose, I would have done so on my own, but neither of the two possibilities caught my attention enough for me to concede a real interest”
He felt him slowly relaxing against his mouth. One of his hands climbed up into his hair to grab them and pull him back, freeing his lips.
"I have no idea what you're talking about! Would you have abused of the drink served during the evening, Potter? You should think about slowing down before you lose the use of your mind forever." he scoffed with his trailing voice, but he didn't say that the effects of Whisky were gently nibbling on his.
"Potter ... To what do I owe the displeasure of seeing you at my door this evening?" he sneered, maliciously.
No, none of that had happened. Oh, some students were looking at him wrong obviously, but he didn't receive any inappropriate comments and he had to admit that he was deeply reassured, although paradoxically troubled…
Potter nodded almost imperceptibly before turning his eyes on their folded hands. He stared at them with a certain intensity, seeming to see nothing else but them.
He blinked his eyes at the impressive flood of emotions that overwhelmed him. He was almost dizzy and nauseous.
“It only took you several months to realize it, it’s impressive! I could have bet you’d be at the same point at the end of the year” he replied, looking down on his book again.
Ginny had really become strong at this sport, Harry could only see it, seeing her start Quidditch moves to impress him. He smiled at her and lay completely on his broomstick to lose her in a sudden acceleration, taking him very far.
Christmas holidays had begun and the whole family had found themselves at “the Burrow” for Christmas Eve.
"No Malfoy, I never joke when it comes to feelings, especially when it comes to mine," he added in a serious tone.
So Ginny delicately put her hand away, tightening her fingers on a fold of his t-shirt that she pressed hard, as if to calm her intention to go further, to swallow her desire to sleep with him.
He could not help thinking that he and Malfoy also had nothing in common and that absolutely everything opposed them, and yet…
He advanced a few steps before finding himself in front of the ugly stone gargoyle that guarded the director’s office.
"I don't intend to prove anything to you, I've already told you how I feel, and I don't have to stoop to fulfill your desires to satisfy your unhealthy curiosity! And for your information, I did it earlier," he hissed, in a loud voice.
Harry would never have imagined it possible to simply discuss with Malfoy, without aggression, only with words devoid of animosity.
Draco had abandoned the rest of his family at the end of the war, denied his father’s evil inclinations, abandoned his mother to regret but she was not ready to leave his father, so he could only keep her in his heart.
The black of his pupils now covered almost all the usual grey, leaving only a thin curve on the edges. Harry could feel Malfoy’s cravings tingling his skin through his uniform. He could feel his lips burning under Malfoy’s intense gaze.
The small group had met in Hogsmeade to discuss and drink the delicious Madam Rosmerta’s ButterBeers.
Harry followed him with his eyes until he saw him disappear and lowered his head again on the scroll, he had just given him.
“Oh! And who said that?” Malfoy added, raising higher his eyebrow which disappeared behind a blonde strand on his forehead.
He was all the more certain, since Malfoy had half confessed it to Snape, when he had followed them, leaving Slughorn's party to listen to their conversation.
Harry took them out without flinching, applying himself to smoothing the tablecloth already in place before arranging the service on it for their dinner.
He also had a terrible desire to cry with rage, because he did not understand how he felt. Worse still, he was visibly the only one to be under the influence of this strange emotion since Malfoy seemed perfectly calm and serene before him, chatting with enthusiasm, as a fire burned inside Harry, burning his entire body, pulling to the tip of his hair.
Harry, who was in full execution of his spell, had a slight startle and turned the piece of his puzzle a little too quickly, which rotated another quarter turn.
Harry undertook long back and forth while lowering his mouth on Malfoy’s chin, biting the muscles of his jaw, then on the thin skin of his neck which he licked avidly, putting kisses on his collarbone, and accelerating his hand on Malfoy’s sex who no longer restrained his moaning.
Harry, of course, never intended to repeat what he had done with Malfoy. They had parted in the middle of one of their many -
Malfoy continued his exploration until he grazed his nipples and there again Harry hardly moved. Just a little under the effect of surprise, but he remained almost stuck to Malfoy as if he were asking for more. He felt his eyelids close slowly and he blinked several times to stay focused on Malfoy moves.
He still couldn’t get over the twist of his pleasure. What possessed him to drift so far on Malfoy when he had never wanted him or any other person of the same sex!
“Why Malfoy? Are we ashamed of having succumbed? Shame of having folded before Voldemort?” Harry jeered, who felt his anger rising in spite of him.
"Yeah, if you want, can we do that in the yard over there if it’s okay with you?" Harry said, pointing at the field.
If Malfoy had also shared the same emotions, he could claim that it was not an illusion but something real that had happened between them and then Harry would feel a little better.
Of course, he already had a vague idea of what happened there, but he wanted to know Harry’s version and especially what he thought of his old roommate.
Harry was no fool, he had never been able to lie and have Hermione as his best friend for more than seven years now had never helped to keep any secrets from him.
And as if Malfoy had guessed, he slowly opened his eyes and anchored his veiled gaze in Harry’s. This was enough for Harry who came in a final jolt, without having had time to warn him.
Then it came time to leave the table, Potter devoted himself to clearing out while Draco took advantage of it to go and freshen up in the bathroom. He opened the sink’s cold water tap, bending his hands underneath to collect enough before plunging his face into his palms to enjoy the freshness.
“For your information, this horrible costume as you call it, was one of my creations! You have no idea how many hours it took me to sew enough fabric so that Crabbe and Goyle could be completely covered.” Malfoy retorted, raising a disdainful eyebrow.
Harry focused his attention on the armrest, pulling on the quilted fabric under his fingers. He glanced at the clock, following the hypnotic movement of the slowly moving needle.
It was powerful and horribly violent, crushing the depths of his bowels with lightning intensity, gnawing at all his organs, beginning with his heart, which he felt crumbling as he continued to stare at Malfoy.
He rose slowly, taking care not to rush too much so as not to fall. It had been two months since he had walked long distances.
Harry no longer listened, his mind seemed clouded, obstructed by the many thoughts that seemed to want to make his brain their home.
Harry allowed himself to be disturbed by Malfoy’s gentle gestures as he turned his palm to examine it. He could not help deflecting his gaze at his roommate’s face, concentrating on his task.
Harry felt his conscience give up, his body sink under the weight of realities, the weight of the fucking truth.
Draco took the time to stare at him, happy with the small advance they had gained in only one late evening. He had not expected so much from the Harry of his past, but Potter was unquestionably unpredictable and would never cease to surprise him as he lived with him.
A powerful tremor then moved the elevator and Harry was so confused that he did not immediately notice that he had loosened his grip from the railing. There was a second tremor, stronger this one and he stumbled, letting go completely the metal bar.
Feeling his knees sagging, Harry clung to the night table, wailing under the back-and-forth of Malfoy’s mouth against his sex, which made him lose his mind. He had to go back to his dorm, to make sure Ron would find him tomorrow morning when he came back, but Malfoy’s torture on his cock made him forget his obligations.
Because deep down, he had felt the warmth that had spread into his heart every time he laid his eyes on him.
When he opened the door, he expected to find him lying in bed, perhaps even completely asleep. He already imagined himself watching him sleep, his eyes running through the features of his face as his ears filled with his calm and slow breathing.
Fred was dead during this one but George had decided to keep open “Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes” and the store was holding up well. It was like a breath of fresh air after past events. People needed to laugh, to joke, to live...
His breathing accelerated as he leaned his head to the side to delight his tempting lips, which he knew were soft. He breathed deeply, revelling in Malfoy’s perfume, while his mouth moved on Malfoy's own in a voluptuous kiss.
Draco wasn’t too thrilled about it because he knew that, through this new profession, he was going to have to deal with Potter.
"If you really feel, if only one ounce of feeling towards me, then prove it and kiss me!" Draco intimated in a sure voice, his blood pulsating in his ears.
Draco Malfoy faced him, straight as a pike, his eyes betraying surprise as he stared at him as if he didn’t seem to believe it.
Another disappearance in one of the remote corners of London. Another case he’d probably be assigned in the next few hours. He had always appreciated his work, for having duly chosen him since he was barely 15 years old, and he would need a distraction to make him forget the pain that made him come here tonight.
Harry’s spirit was freeing up, and if he hadn’t been forced to go home, because Mrs. Weasley was starting to scold them, he would have stayed a long time, maybe all afternoon, just to stop thinking, keep forgetting…
Looking at his reflection, he wondered if like his physical appearance, his state of mind, had also evolved… About Malfoy, about the people around him, about politics, about sports and everything that made him what he was in his day.
Everything became clear in a few seconds in his mind, he was dreaming and someone was watching him sleep.
All was well for a few weeks, he had stopped thinking about Malfoy and had resumed the course of his life.
“As you please, Potter, it’s your boss the Auror, not mine.” He is pointing out, stretching out a small smirk.
His footsteps moved away as he finally opened his eyes and frantically pounded his eyelids to accustom his eyes to darkness.
Draco then undertook to look for Harry, starting with the kitchen, imagining that he might have had a little hunger but here, nothing had been disturbed.
Harry didn’t know what he was doing there. He didn’t know how his friends had dragged him here, but he was still there, lost, in the midst of a crowd of students from his school dancing, drinking and laughing.
“Cause you honestly believe that I’m going to sit here and do nothing while you go and smash some Death Eaters?” Harry spit out, obviously out of him.
Alcohol spread along his chest in a comforting warmth but still far too weak to distinguish the pain from the rest of his body.
As if his subconscious had needed his blessing, the colour scheme that surrounded him slowly faded away to make room only for the dark, like a night without stars where he felt suffocated.
Hands held on his arms to prevent him from going further and a slight pressure brought him back to his bed where his head fell heavily against the pillow he felt encompassing him. This had the merit of taking off a little more his eyelids that he blinked several times without ever succeeding in opening them completely for that reason.
Harry had always been able to shatter the impassive mask that he constantly tried to tackle on his face. Erasing the effort and the hours spent practicing alone in front of his mirror to get at a result that he considered almost perfect.
“Hermione says he’s brilliant at what he does and works smart.” added Ron, before sipping his FireWhisky.
“Yeah, but I feel like I’m spending my fucking time, typing this damn report that’s going on forever...”
A huge stone column hung in a corner of the room, a container of the same material was deposited there, volutes of fumes floated over a strange, thick silver liquid.
Potter abruptly opened his eyes and stared at him strangely, burning desire still shining in the back of his green eyes. He took a step forward, seeming to want to resume where they had stopped but Draco interrupted him once again by forcing on his wrists.
Potter’s fingers shyly parted to let appear his beautiful green eyes, too bright, and lay on Draco's palm exposed to the sky, patiently waiting for him to cover it with his own.
“It doesn’t change anything, I’m dangerous and you know I’m right,” he hissed, mechanically flushing the dish under the water.
Harry didn’t listening to him anymore, his eyes staring down at the ground looking for a solution that didn’t seem to come.
Malfoy blinked his eyes before positioning himself in front of the desk and stretched out his arm, focused.
His fingers tightened on the blanket which he had not even remembered to hold until then and it was increasingly evident who was there before he finally woke up.
Draco’s fingers gently grazed Harry’s cheek, delicately putting some hair behind his ear, before reluctantly moving away to rest on his knee.
After making sure he was clear enough in his gestures, he released the pressure of his arms on Malfoy, making him lower and return to his original position, keeping his mouth against his own.
He and Ron had carelessly settled down on an outside table despite the cold of the incipient winter, the fresh air of the wind had cooled their much-used brains in recent hours.
He noticed that several tables had been partially frozen in places and that some crystals were emerging from the objects on display on some shelves.
A whirlwind of emotions invaded Harry when he began to stare at him. The whiteness of his skin seemed to have captured all the lights lighting up the hallway and it was as if he were shining, dazzling enough for Harry to be forced to squint his eyes. His hair was so blond that they turned white, each wick carefully plated back with wax. His pointed nose and prominent cheekbones accentuated the cold and contemptuous look that he endeavoured to display despite the fear that one could clearly read in his grey eyes.
“I’m not really surprised, we were, strictly speaking, two individuals studying in the same school, nothing more.” he added, leaning a little forward to take the majestic feather resting on its base.
Christmas holidays were over and the classes had resumed nicely, for the greatest pain of Harry who had to bear again the presence of Malfoy in front of him.
The holidays had given rise to a deep lack for Malfoy, and the first day of school had brought him out of jealousy.
“Voldemort only marked those he considered to be in his ranks. I have never been more than a pawn in his eyes. That’s why I never received the mark” he explained, in a perfectly calm tone.
“For fuck’s sake Ron, do you realize what you’re saying?! How can you believe for a moment that I’m going to wait for you to find the assholes who made me forget everything without helping you find them?” He shouted, against his friend.
Harry wrinkled his eyes, weighing the pros and cons before turning his heels in the direction shown by the Healer without an answer for Malfoy.
“Well then, thanks again for your work. To the pleasure of seeing you, soon” he replied, extending his hand again, with a slight smile.
Harry frowned. Malfoy seemed very affected by his gesture, as if he was disappointed to see him threaten him.
Once in the bathroom, he took off his pants and took off his still sticky boxers from his flings with Malfoy.
Harry tried to ignore the beating of his heart which accelerated at the sight of Malfoy, silencing the heat that was spreading in the hollow of his belly.
… the way I did. I never intended to kill you! I was only defending myself and I am convinced that if you could, you would have done it without hesitation!” he hissed, annoyed to be held solely responsible.
The more days passed, the sadder Harry’s mood became. Even more than the last time, when he indulged in his personal pleasure, unconsciously thinking of Malfoy. He had resigned himself, he wanted him, and it was something he couldn’t control. He was trying to understand when his hatred for him had so turned to cravings that he was trying so hard to suppress.
It was so hot to see Malfoy lose his mind. His eyes darkening with pleasure, his small noises making his always more. Harry was biting the inside of his cheek at the sight of Malfoy who was amazing, so
Draco held his breath, already imagining Harry refusing to take it. But Potter’s hand slipped slowly from his face to pick up his and squeeze it tightly. Draco then sharply pulled Harry towards him who pushed a gasp of surprise. Draco then released his hand to wrap his arms around Potter's waist and hugged him.
Ginny’s team had just scored its third goal when he saw below, Malfoy and his crew pushing people to move to let them settle in. He sighed. It was not yet tonight that he could avoid him. He noticed that a new head had been added to the band. A bloke was sitting next to Malfoy and laughing with him, gently pushing him with one hand on his shoulder.
He waited patiently for the water to warm up, leaning on a cupboard in the kitchen, his fingers on the edge of the work surface.
Draco let his hands wander under Potter’s T-shirt, redrawing his fall of kidney, climbing up to his shoulder blades, then passed his shoulders to stop on his chest, tickling the small pieces of flesh that he felt hardened under his fingers.
He placed his glass on the table and looked for his wand in the pocket of his dress to cast a cleaning spell.
"Bloody hell, Malfoy, you're really starting to piss me off, you know that?" he said, standing a few inches away from Draco.
“But finally I think you’re right, the treacherous being that I was must surely pay the price today, because now, even that aspect, I no longer have the right.” He ends up, sighing.
Draco could see Harry boiling with anger and frustration at staying here while individuals still wanted his life.
Harry smiled. It was a fresh start after living hell last year. They were finally going to be able to continue their lives peacefully.
Of course, Ginny, too tired, had not followed and apologized all day by kissing him and taking him in her arms not to go dancing. Finally, like last time, he found himself with Ron and Hermione who had dropped him again to go and shake on the dance floor. So, he had gone to the furthest room to be alone to ponder.
“Two Firewhiskey, please” he announced with his dragging voice, before taking a look at Harry by raising an eyebrow, challenging him to contest.
Malfoy uttered a pronounced exclamation, scowling at him while Harry hardly rose from the bed to stand.
“Well, Mr Potter, you can go home. As agreed, we will be expecting you tomorrow for your appointment with your wizard therapist. Maybe he’ll be able to fix some damage…”
Harry slowly raised his head to see that he was looking at him from the corner of his eye with a deeply annoyed look, as if the mere fact of asking this question was already a huge torment that he was trying to do.
A dreadful pain pierced his heart, a picture of Harry smiling at him, unsettling little by little under his eyelids, his soft and loving gaze became more blurred as he sought him…
He would have wanted to explain why he behaved like an idiot at lunch, but he was incapable of it. Not without revealing the truth about what had been obsessing him for a few months. Not without ruining his friendship with his best friend by telling him he was cheating on Ginny.
was the future Auror after all and it wasn’t a fucking asshole like Malfoy who was going to fail him.
That’s why, that night again, Harry was lying in bed, browsing the Marauder’s map widely unfolded, looking for Draco Malfoy who had not stopped obstructing his thoughts since the beginning of the year.
Passing through the kitchen, he noticed that Potter had washed everything, plates and cutlery resting on the edge of the sink draining.
“I’m following you too, I’m tired of hearing your fucking bullshit” Ginny added, glaring to them before catching up Hermione.
“What if I don’t want to anymore?” Malfoy asked, lying on his back, leaning on his elbows, raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
Ginny got closer quickly before fiercely putting her lips on his, in a feverish kiss that was not really one for him. Ginny’s tongue made its way into his mouth, wrapping hers to accentuate the kiss, promising that the sequel would be particularly wild.
"But he is right Hermione, he does not seem to want a truce. Even if his way of doing things has indeed changed and the insults do not turn out like Hogwarts anymore, now he is bullying and it’s not really better!" Harry insisted.
The flask always floated in front of him, the golden reflections reflected through the room while the Cauldrons Cakes, still in suspension, shone with this faint yellowish glow.
He looked away at Potter’s hand, resting on the table next to his plate. He moved his hand towards it with some apprehension, his heart beating hardly in his chest at the thought of being able to touch him.
He was about to put his hand on Malfoy’s dick and he didn’t feel ready to do it. Harry tried to remove his fingers, but this one tightened his wrist to keep him from moving.
“Dumbledore told us that you were the only one who could do it, but you know Hermione, always wanting to prove that the answers are necessarily in her books.” Ron sighed, and Harry was convinced that he had just rolling his eyes.
Harry’s gestures were becoming more and more precise, though utterly desperate to touch as much as they could, tasting his skin wherever he had access. Draco’s body trembled every time his cock wanked against Potter’s, Harry’s moaning accentuating his burning desire to free himself.
In a very calculated move, Malfoy extended a hand towards his waist which he surrounded, pressing his fingers on his hip, his shoulder touching Harry’s, his face dangerously close to his own.
“You think if I wasn’t serious I’d touch you like that?” he added, putting his hand on Malfoy’s crotch and pressing it.
Harry’s heartbeat slowed down to the relief of hearing Ron’s voice and encouraged, he opened his mouth again.
“Eating my neck like that is not going to make me want to leave!” Harry hissed, annoyed, leaning his head a little more to the side to give better access to Malfoy.
And even though Harry shouldn’t have been so concerned, even rejoicing that he finally decided to let him go, it didn’t stop him from wanting to understand why Malfoy had so quickly stopped pissing him off...
Once completely clean and dressed, he went out into the small hallway and frowned when noises in the living room caught his attention.
Almost no longer holding on, and because he was more confident now, he took out his fingers delicately, pushing back Malfoy’s hand and put it on the bed and straightened himself up to stand in front of him.
Draco spread his eyes, feeling all the muscles in his body contracting. His mind seemed disconnected as none of his members were willing to listen. Potter had been so fast, that their teeth had bumped in shock.
“Let Ron take care of it, he and the Aurors will take care of capturing this asshole and bringing back your memories” he said.
"Apparently, the last time wasn’t enough for you... Potter" Malfoy replied behind him, in a smooth voice.
“Well, you’re going to have to do it, because that’s exactly what’s going to happen... NOTHING! Absolutely more NOTHING!” Harry thundered, mimicking with his arms.
"Draco, are you coming? Let’s have a drink with the others," Pansy Parkinson suddenly asked, Malfoy’s closest friend Harry knew.
Harry and Ron began the exercise seriously, each succeeding in moving and turning the pieces, the difficulty being to concentrate well on the direction and degree of inclination.
In a move a little too abrupt, he shifted his hand to escape the disconcerting sweetness of Malfoy’s attention, shooking his head, the strong urge to let him go to the end.
Harry, who had grown accustomed to seeing him look at him, felt a lack pass through him, for a brief moment, before concentrating on his dish, listening to Ron sigh again.
Harry became tense at the mention of his girlfriend. The muscles of his jaw were contracting while he kept his eyes glued to his trinket.
He performed a quick cleaning spell while she was putting on a bathrobe, then she caressed his cheek before leaving the room towards the showers.
“Yes… But only if we find the asshole who cast it at me…Might as well say it’s a losing battle…” he blew, of spite.
Harry gauged for a moment the opening of the door which had been activated after he had touched the bottle, his wand stretched in front of him as protection.
The doors opened and Harry melted head first between them, walking quickly until the exit, Draco following him.
And it was true, his erection which had somewhat fallen off during their exchange hardened again facing Malfoy.
Malfoy always had his strange smile stuck to his face. He was wearing a white shirt whose neck was wide open, revealing the top of his pale bust. His light grey eyes caught Harry, blocking his breathing.
“Hermione told me that it was rather ingenious despite the message that was written there and that the spell to create them was particularly difficult to achieve.”
Their fingers grazed, making Potter shudder, who brought his glass to him a little too abruptly, almost spilling it. A slight pink tint colored his cheekbones as he rushed to mask his discomfort by dipping his lips in the beverage.
“No, this is my day off” Malfoy explained, putting a sling around his neck. “Hurry up, I think we’ve earned some fresh air.” He added, turning his face slightly, revealing a little smirk.
Harry’s heart beat faster in his chest as he stepped further into the room and cleared his throat to signal his presence.
“Don’t worry about school, Harry, I already copied you and summed up everything we learned while you were asleep.” Hermione declared.
“You understood very well so don’t make me repeat it and answer me!” Harry hissed, who was no longer in control of his nerves while his blood was beating against his temples.
Malfoy ran over him and caught him before he reached the ground, holding him tight. Harry realized that he had closed his eyes in shock and opened them, gasping. He could feel Malfoy’s breath in his back while his arm hugged his ribs.
He remembered being dragged by Harry into a shop far too silly to his liking, pink and white all over the shelves, frames and hearts swirling on the ceiling.
Reviving his past was unquestionably entertaining, but many wizards became addicted to it. To being absorbed by these remnants of memories, some too addictive, too
Harry climbed the steps until the massive oak door where he knocked with the griffon-shaped knocker. It opened itself and Dumbledore’s distant voice invited him in.
Harry turned his head in his direction by raising his eyebrows. He opened his mouth as he was about to ask who the future Mrs Malfoy was, but was overtaken by George.
Harry was staring at the couple whose wedding date was displayed just below before the image was replaced by another newsfeed. He swallowed with difficulty and looked down on his glass, feeling his heart sorely squeeze.
Harry thought. He took the time to stare at him before putting a strand of rebellious blonde hair behind Malfoy’s ear. “Is that reason enough for you to properly learn to master the bloody nonverbal spell?” he added.
Harry sighed, imagining that he would have to find a new home in the days to come, knowing that the news would spread very quickly through the various means of communication.
"I come to see your friend Malfoy if you really want to know everything," Harry replied in a mournful voice.
“Anyway, Mom won’t give you any more time.” Ron sneered, elbowing his brother with an accomplice smile.
“Just because you told me and in talking to you, I realized that I had the same resentment towards you,” he explained.
She seemed to be thinking for a while. Harry had no trouble imagining the connectors of her brain assembling ideas, scrolling them in front of her, looking for the one that would make the most sense to her. Then saw her go back to reading her book on the table, without any glance for him.
Harry frowned, acknowledging without difficulty the object which was presented to him but did not really see what he was getting at.
The cogs set in place, operating at full speed, while an incongruous idea was born in his perilous mind.
This sod didn't realize, of course, that he was standing just below the mistletoe branch from which Draco had shifted.
He gazed at it for a moment, noticing the fine lines carved all around representing small leaves and what seemed to him to be a kind of bay.
Harry also moved in a more vigorous rhythm, his moaning becoming more and more raucous, less and less spaced as his hands grabbed both the skin of his back and his blond hair, which he pulled between his fingers.
He remained still for a moment, frowning while the flames of Malfoy’s fireplace regained their original appearance and danced joyfully.
A heavy silence settled between them, while Harry assimilated the words that Malfoy had formulated. He blinked several times, trying to understand where he was going and why this story was coming up again.
His features relaxed and he raised a taunting eyebrow before grin. Harry swallowed, turning his eyes to the wall, and putting them back on him. Malfoy always looked at him, but his smile was sweeter. Harry’s heart missed a beat without him really knowing why, and he blinked before shaking his head, shifting his focus to the discussion of his friends.
He looked into Malfoy’s metallic eyes, always focused on the coffee machine, and felt his heart racing for no reason. For him, Malfoy had always had bland eyes and no expression. He had to admit that he had made a big mistake when he stared at the bright reflections reflected in it and marked the different shades of grey that he had never noticed before. He lost himself in the gentle look of multiple hues while his lips slowly spread.
He finally agreed to sit down and turned his attention to the young man who was a few meters away, his hands in his pants pockets, leaning against his desk.
He had a bitter smile when thinking of Ron, although he could imagine it, it was obvious that such thoughts would never cross his mind.
Potter let out an appalled scoff, although the smirk on his face never dimmed. "Says the one who ate most of the treacle tarts,
So it's no surprise when that sends Harry over the edge. Tears build in his eyes, and he shakes his head in defeat. The sight makes Draco's heart break. This wasn't how this was supposed to go. He wishes he could take the past thirty seconds back and start over.
"Since you're being so honest, I think you're quiet...charming when you're not trying to save the world, Potter."
Draco choked on his spit, much to the delight of Harry, who burst into his cheerful laughter that sounded like bells. Draco didn't feel so embarrassed anymore when he made Harry laugh like that.
"Hello, Potter," Draco said. He quickly realised he hadn't planned this far ahead, and he racked his brain for something else to say; something that wasn't suspicious or condescending. "I came to, uh, check up on you and see if you were okay. Everyone's gone for lunch and I noticed you hadn't joined them, so I was wondering if you wanted to join me for lunch instead?"
They're rocking their hips, the friction too weak to make much of a difference, but it's a delicious fire that makes Draco want more more more. He pulls at Harry's hair and lifts his head to reconnect their lips. Harry whimpers and whines and tugs at whatever clothing of Draco's he can get his hands on.
Granger and Weasley were down having lunch. And hadn't Granger taken Potter up to his room just minutes before she began discussing his state with Weasley? As much as Draco had vowed not to sneak around anymore, now was his only real chance of catching Potter by himself without anybody else staring them down the whole time. He had - what? Fifteen minutes, if that, to speak to Potter, try his best to condense the long apology speech he had created, and see what state he was in so he could make a potion. Easy, right?
Potter seemed rather unfazed by Draco's stutter. He shrugged. "I made the wall just after we broke up. It was still a little bit too raw back then. I could probably try now, but..." He waved around the room, to all the sections that were taken up by photos. "It's a bit too late, now. I don't have the energy for it."
Draco knows he's fucked up as soon as he says it. Potter is not how he refers to Harry - not when they're like this, tightly knitted together in their own bubble. Potter is what he calls him when he's bullying him, when he's teasing and taunting him to get a rise of him. They agreed that the only time Draco is to refer to Harry as Potter is when they first 'find' each other here at the cemetery. After that, it's only Harry and Draco for the rest of their time together.
"Not even with the sleeping potion. Madame Pomfrey became so desperate, she even tried Muggle medication."
Draco thought he'd crossed the line as soon as the words slipped out of his mouth and winced in preparation to be hexed, only for Potter to reply with a quiet, shy-sounding laugh. The sound of bells continued to fill the room, making Draco smile. It had been such a long time since anybody had laughed so openly. It was nice to hear it again.
"We should have done this years ago, instead of fighting and hexing each other," Harry panted as he tried to roll on top of Draco.
Weasley swallowed so hard his Adam's apple bobbed a few times in his throat. "There has to be something we can do, 'Mione. Something we're not trying."
"Harry, wait," he says, and gently pries Harry away when he tries to kiss his neck. "Stop. Are you sure this is okay?"
He sounds so desperate, so broken and so unlike the brave man Draco is used to, and it makes him completely break. He dives for Harry and pulls him in close, not caring if his coat or shirt or anything becomes soaked. He needs to let Harry know that he is safe and protected in Draco's arms. Clothes can be replaced. Harry Potter is irreplaceable.
"Really?" Harry says. There's a newfound hope in his voice and it brings joy to Draco's cold heart. "You'd be willing to come out. For me?"
Those thoughts resurfaced now, but Draco waved them away with the shake of his head. Asking questions like those came too little too late, now. What's done was done, all Draco could do now was try and fix his mistakes. Potter, Granger and Weasley had all been kind enough to vouch for him and his mother during their trials last spring; the least he could do was repay the favour.
But now they all sit in the library, Pansy and Blaise included, and study together. It’s not only beneficial to their grades, but to their house points as well; they all received fifty point each for house unity. Harry loves these moments, watching the six of them - six complete individuals whom he never thought would ever get along in a million years - argue and laugh and banter together. Draco loves seeing Harry smile at these moments. He loves the fling in his eyes and the way he becomes soft yet strong, giving yet assertive. It 8: rather sexy.
Harry gave up the boneless vegetable on his plate to raise his head to his friend, feeling the annoyance over his reason. As expected, she had the look of someone who was worried, as she had always had and continued to have when she felt that something was wrong. And even if that were the case at the moment, he had no desire for her to interfere in his private life that did not concern her.
He then shifted his focus to the door and began to turn the handle when Malfoy’s dragging voice behind him startled him.
The pain was immeasurable and Harry squeezing his teeth tightly while his hands grabbed the sheets. Malfoy’s face faded when he closed his eyes, unable to resist the violent sensation that was passing through his body. He groaned with pain between his teeth when Malfoy’s sex slowly retreated to withdraw entirely.
He had seen himself initiate the kiss, the burning desire to touch Malfoy, shining in his dark eyes as he move towards him to be able to kiss him.
Potter closed his eyes for a moment while sighing, keeping the door handle in his hand that he squeezed hard enough to whiten his knuckles. He opened them slowly before abruptly raising his head in his direction, nervously blushing as if he had been caught at fault.
They were only a few metres apart and Harry could clearly see the reflection of the torch in the background of his light grey eyes.
It was Thursday, and the next night Ron wanted to go back to the nightclub to celebrate the weekend duly deserved after the complicated week they had just spent.
The winter was already well under way and their warm breath was becoming foggy as they moved through the frozen-looking grass, crackling in places beneath their steps.
Harry thought about the pleasure of flying. He didn’t have the strength to buy a new broom, but watching the players flying in front of him, he couldn’t help but envy them too.
Yeah, he should never have given in to the whims of those best friends by shamefully participating in that Christmas Eve crap organized by that stupid school that was Hogwarts.
Harry did not blink and squint his eyes dangerously towards him. He swallowed nervously under the intensity of his cold gaze, feeling his hairs bristle along his arms so much the exchange was striking, the excitement rising up along his dorsal spine to finally have his attention.
It wasn’t the first time his heart was beating so hard when he met Malfoy. He had always had more trouble breathing when he met him at work, or even at the turn of a corridor when they were still at Hogwarts. Malfoy had always electrified him since they knew each other, even though at the time it was their common hatred that was responsible. He wouldn’t know how long it had changed, but it had diminished over the course of the weeks, the months they had spent together, and Harry didn’t even notice.
Malfoy’s back bowed, and in a final jolt he came into his hand, a hoarse groan escaping from his lips. His head then settled on Harry’s shoulder where he slowly resumed his breath before anchoring his retinas in Harry’s dark green eyes.
Harry’s stomach twisted, taking his breath away from Malfoy’s figure taking pleasure, sinking into him. He swallowed hardly when he felt his heart frantically panic at the sight of Malfoy letting himself totally go between his thighs, striking inexorably against his pelvis, touching a place in him that ripped out to him a raucous moan and rolled his eyes back a second before starting again.
He was convinced that at the very moment he would have bought his new house, the witch press would take care of revealing in the open that he had separated from Ginny and that he was on the market.
Harry was way too close to Malfoy, he could feel his breath crashing on his face. He saw his grey eyes glowing with desire for him. His smile always on his lips... This one, too close to his own.
Harry looked for them, patting with his hand on his nightstand. Once found, he put them on his nose, noticing that they had a different shape.
Sighing in spite, he winced at the far too pasty aspect of his potion before pointing his wand at the cauldron.
He awoke in a mood to make pale anyone who crossed his path in the vast corridors of the university.
There was nothing around them anymore, it seemed to them that no one could see them, as time seems to have stopped when their lips touched.
Malfoy shook his head slightly as his body leaned backwards with the obvious goal of putting as much distance as he could.
“As you will surely have noticed, the object before your eyes was voluntarily assembled in a rough way, the goal being, you will have understood, to make it look different by moving the parts to your liking.” he added, walking in front of his desk.
Seriously? After everything they’ve done in the past few weeks, there was no one left for Malfoy? Harry had let himself be touched by him, had cheated on Ginny for him, certainly, because his desire was too strong, but from there to no longer exist in Malfoy’s eyes, it was fucking bullshit!
Draco closed his eyes by feeling Potter’s hand fondling his neck and raised his arms to encircle his back again in a possessive embrace.
Of course, it ended pretty badly. Malfoy, having failed to move the book by the sheer force of his mind, had grabbed his wand and sent it to crash against a wall under anger. Harry had to calm him down and explain to him that it took time to get there the first time, and that after that, everything would go by itself without really needing to concentrate.
Harry wondered how people saw him today. He had always been famous for his notoriety and the actions he had taken during his childhood and now had to be supplemented by others of which he currently had no memory. He could not know the opinion of the various wizards who looked at him now and somewhere was intrigued, all the more with Malfoy at his side.
! You put everyone in danger and you don’t even care?" Ron added, going a little further until he practically sticks his forehead against his own.
"Always on edge from what I see... I would like to tell you that I don’t fucking care what you’re here for, but I admit that it intrigues me" Zabini smiled, crossing his arms on his bust.
“I didn’t wait for you, Potter. Find someone else to regulate your cravings” Malfoy replied, in a smirk.
Harry stopped kissing him as Malfoy’s face stretched towards his own as if to prolong the kiss. Harry then stood up and moved his hands on the back of the chair. He grabbed it firmly and brutally turned it over to force Malfoy to face him. He then sat immediately on his thighs before Malfoy had time to protest.
He, who complained that he only had missions that consisted in filling out reports, did not expect to be injured from the first time his presence on the ground was requested. He must have been a little rusty from sitting his ass down on his chair reading and proofreading documents and then filing them in bloody files.
“Bloody hell, I answered you! What more do you need?” Malfoy whined, making large movements of his arms while retreating again.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, then nodded before he pulled back gently to position himself between his thighs. He then placed his hands on Harry’s knees and gently spread his legs to reveal his entire pelvis.
He thought he’d come back to a normal life after kindly recalling Malfoy and his explicit need to go further. He had foolishly allowed himself to be consumed by jealousy, seeing Malfoy so coveted by the various young men circling him.
Harry remained silent, his eyes fixed on those of his ex-enemy who still smiling. Malfoy had this strange and unspeakable look that made Harry almost uncomfortable.
A few strands of his hair fell before his eyes and Harry raised his hand to remove them, leaving him all the leisure to admire the grey pearls with silvery reflections.
“I was so convinced that you were one of them…” he blew, his head down, seeming almost ashamed to have imagined for a moment what he was.
“All right, in that case I’ll ask Ron or Hermione to come with me outside” he said, standing in front of the fireplace with the firm care of calling them.
“It could have been much worse…” he whispered before closing his eyes, firmly grabbing several dark strands between his fingers.
Harry, who until then had never thought of going beyond the stage of touching him, was surprised by this twist.
“Calm down, Zabini, because the only memory I have of you is your smug and disdainful side that even with the years apparently has no intention of leaving your dirty, little motherfucking face!” he shouted, wincing.
The potion slowly took on a beautiful orange color, leading him to lower the heat slightly to let it simmer quietly.
“Ron and Hermione went to visit Molly and Arthur for the weekend and Ginny followed them,” Harry explained.
But Potter was there, holding him against him as his tongue pushed against his mouth, begging to be able to enter. Draco’s lips opened, leaving Harry free to play with his tongue, intertwining it, sucking it, making him moan with pleasure.
“Okay, I’m taking you to St Mungo’s” he had replied, supporting him more to encourage him to move forward.
He walked down the small hallway to return to the switchboard where Malfoy was already waiting for him, sitting on one of the chairs in the waiting room. He rose immediately when he saw him.
“We’ll see, but if I want to succeed, I don’t have time to waste!” Ron said, nodding. He then cracked the fingers of his hand, before returning to his table and resuming his training, more determined than ever.
He turned his head to Malfoy, who was already gripping the floo powder in the terracotta pot when a crazy idea crossed his mind.
“Relax Potter, I’m no longer the pretentious little prick you knew at Hogwarts. For my own good and that of others, I changed,” he laughed, his eyes anchored in Harry’s.
In a resigned sigh, he pushed back the blankets and headed for the small crystal bottle on one of the shelves of the room. Fixing the scrolls of smoke dancing inside, he opened the bottle and turned his head in the direction of the door which materialized at that moment.
Harry had a brief startle and felt pale to find that Hermione was far too far-sighted for his own good and for his too.
Harry stood still for a few seconds, then sighed, closing his eyes before opening the door and going through it.
Harry could almost feel his fucking smile when this one sneered, sending a new breath, caressing the skin of his neck that made him shiver.
Ron and Hermione had already gone on the dance floor, in a small place, separated from the main room. He made his way through the dance floor, looking for known faces. And for the first time in several weeks, he saw him…
"No Malfoy, I'm not kidding you, far be it from me to joke about it!" Potter answered simply, his eyes not letting go of his own.
Malfoy kept staring at him without saying a word, as if he expected him to explain his question. He ended up making a light puff laugh and stretching a grin.
The beats of his heart became distraught, before the importance of this move, showing there a kind of possessiveness, as if Harry were his. Like Malfoy wanted to keep him.
Exhausted, he no longer had the strength to move. He left his head in the pillow and let go. The tears were still running down his cheeks and he had no way of controlling them. Harry couldn’t even think anymore. He was like emptied and there was no point in fighting.
Facing the door, he fixed it for a few moments before resigning himself to opening it. The risk that he would run into Malfoy at the very moment he was leaving his…
These are things that happen naturally, he was Harry Potter, the most famous wizard after Dumbledore and Voldemort. And after the last two died, he was at the top of the list.
“Theo is an excellent wizard therapist, he is the most gifted of his generation” Draco claimed, staring at Harry.
Once the healer left, he remained for a few moments to watch her return to her office before turning to Draco.
Malfoy had made him discover every part of his body with the help of his hand before making him touch his cock. Harry tightened his hands on the book, thinking about the texture of Malfoy’s sex between his fingers. He risked a look at him and was happy to see that he was no longer staring at him. His attention had focused on Zabini with whom he was chatting.
Harry then lifted his glass to his lips and let the bitter taste of mead invade his mouth before feeling the sweet touch of honey soften the whole. It took him only two sips to drink it all and he rested it in a small tinkle on the bar.
He had struggled to fall asleep, and was not entirely sure that he had really succeeded. Harry remembered turning several times in his half-sleep, seeking to free his mind from incongruous feelings that seemed to want to slip into his thoughts.
He had been staying late several times to dodge his questions that he did not have any answers. She had already sent him several owls to ask him to choose between purple or blueberry red and he had not yet decided.
Because he couldn’t stand to feel Harry go against him, the scent of his skin filled his nostrils and put his mouth against his shoulder to delight in the spicy taste of Potter’s skin.
“If I follow your reasoning, the fact that we have a common past justifies me being able to betray the code of professional secrecy? Just because we shared the same bathroom at another time?” he had asked, with a sarcastic tone, raising an eyebrow.
Malfoy’s pupils dilated slightly in the dark and he moved just a little so as to take off from the desk and move slightly closer to him. His breath was now falling on the bottom of Harry’s face, who suppressed a chill by lowering his eyes on his lips.
“Oh, it’s one of his specialties, always present when you least expect it! One could almost consider it a talent!” he sneered, cutting his meat.
The haemoglobin escaped in fine red lines and traced the hollows between his fingers, dyeing the white, almost translucent features of his skin. He frowned detailing the red liquid rolling over the cracks in his hand and bent it slightly to let the blood flow to the side before shaking it to drain it over the table. He then removed the small pieces of glass and placed them on his plate, now stained with broken pieces, before taking his towel to sponge off his hand.
He finally reached the door, stealthily and turned the handle carefully before finally breathing when he closed it behind his back. A strange sense of emptiness invaded him as soon as he left the building to find his own, as if he missed Malfoy’s presence.
“I would ask you now to let Mr. Potter rest, he’s going to need a lot of quiet to get his voice back.”
Harry went down to his chest, then down to his torso. Malfoy contracted his lower belly by biting his lower lip, his hands squeezing the sheets of his bed when he circled his navel with his tongue.
Malfoy let loose a slight sigh under his caresses, but nevertheless remained focused on his eyes, visibly seeking answers to his daring behaviour.
“It’s no use forcing Mr. Potter, it’s normal that not using your voice takes her a while to come back. But don’t worry, you should have some of it back in a few hours.” Pomfrey explained.
He spread the cloth and eventually found Malfoy’s belly warm. The skin was soft and velvety, and he still groaned at the irresistible urge to lick it. He raised his hands higher until he touched one of Malfoy’s nipples, who gasped against his mouth. He retraced the ribs under his fingers and went down again until he went around his navel before putting his hand on the edge of his pants.
Harry closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and oxygenated his brain to give himself the courage to recover his mind.
Draco froze and slowly turned his head towards him, becoming more tensed up when he saw that he was staring at him without blinking.
Moving up his eyes to the grey orbs that stared at him, Harry concentrated on his fine features, his well-drawn fleshy mouth, redded by their last exchanged kiss.
Harry began to breathe louder as Malfoy began to smile slowly, understanding that he was at his mercy.
Harry knew he was obsessed with this hatred, but it had calmed down after the war and he had stopped thinking about it when he arrived here.
Over the years, he had learned to control more or less this kind of phenomena, but the teenager who was in him today still had all the verve that he could not bear in the time of Hogwarts.
Harry was climbing the stairs that he was beginning to know by heart now, until the little crack in the middle of the course that he felt under his fingers grabbing the railing.
"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" Harry yelled, pinning Malfoy on the wall with his arm under his chin, his other hand pointing his wand at his throat.
Harry had tried to resist, to the end, he had tried to swallow his impulses for Malfoy, but his desire for him was far too deep...
“I heard him wake up and as soon as he saw me he started threatening me,” Malfoy said in his dragging voice.
"If the answer you're looking for is you, then yes, you get it, you're the person I have a crush on," Potter interrupted, defying him with his green eyes.
“Harry… You live here and Draco will do nothing to you I have already told you…” made Hermione’s bruised voice, glaring at him with sorrow.
“Poppy is right, Harry, you’re lucky to have very little physical damage, but what I want to know is how does your mind feel?”
When the sun went lower, thus decreasing their visibility, they decided to stop. They had worked hard enough for today.
But his boss kicked his ass by flattering his aristocratic ego that he remained despite his current situation.
Harry had at first hesitated, still a little on the reserve when it came to getting back on a broom, then nodded and grabbed the broomstick, which he had placed between his legs, his heart beating with apprehension.
The candlestick was almost completely covered in ice now. The blue light was losing intensity, its grip would no longer be enough to keep its arm in place for a long time.
"Merlin, how do you explain that your misguided mind had the wonderful idea of snogging ME at the expense of a girl?" he asked, and rightly so.
Hermione and Ginny joined them, and they left in a lively discussion about new inventions they had proposed.
Years they had swept everything away, years they were just Harry and Draco, and now everything was going up in flames…
Harry sighed, exasperated by the attitude that Malfoy took a clever pleasure in displaying. He was probably guessing how much it cost him to come see him and he was having fun.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, his eyes turning blue in the light of the torch reflected there. He then slowly lowered his shoulders and breathed a long sigh that felt down Harry’s face.
Harry watched her, unable to detach his eyes from the complicated symbols that were floating before him. He imagined that some of them had to be his vital signs and with apprehension, tensed his hands a little more against the glass he was holding.
“I used one of my mother’s manuals.” he said, in a proud tone. He then leaned his head slightly to the side, looking a little higher. “I admit I had no idea how complex sewing spells were before I cast them.” he added, distorting his smile which now looked like a wince.
“It’d have been a great pleasure, but I think I’ve bothered you enough. Now that I’ve fulfilled my duty, I’ll let you end the evening in
He closed his eyes and realized that Malfoy had not left his thoughts while touching her. Harry contracted his jaws to the done deal. He had sought Malfoy in the young woman, he had wanted her to be…
Each time Harry had shown him an idea, Draco had mimicked with his fingers the immediate urge to throw up all of his guts on the floor, because the objects and decoration were so disgusting.
His blood bubbled in his veins as Malfoy seemed closer than ever to a young man sitting beside him. Young man whom he identified as Noah the other night, his hand casually resting on Malfoy’s thigh which seemed to listen to him without much interest.
But there again he received a violent blow to his back which almost made him lose his balance. He turn insane, grabbing that bloody wanker and pushing him in a straight line until he violently tackled him against the back wall.
It was not very reasonable given his state of tiredness, but he ordered a drink from the bar to make his desire to leave this nightclub go away immediately. He had gave in too soon, he knew it… But on the other hand, he needed to change his mind and get out a little couldn’t hurt him even if he was short of air because of the heat of the projectors which gave him the impression of suffocating.
He seemed almost frozen and stared at him strangely as if he expected Draco to jump on him to kiss him. Which was not entirely false, but Draco would never try anything in such circumstances.
Harry had always found that Malfoy had too sharp angles on his face that brought out his cheekbones too prominent and his nose too sharp but everything seemed harmonious at that moment and all the faults he had long hated shouted to him that Malfoy was beautiful now.
Harry had never been more than kissing a girl and his one and only experience had not been the most convincing.
When he heard his first name, Harry opened big, confused eyes before feeling his back bow and come in a silent cry, his sperm squirting in Malfoy’s hand.
Potter lowered his head and Draco guessed his smile adorning his lips before he stretched the arm in his direction by giving him a finger that he accentuated with the wrist.
As usual, he had spewed the words without really thinking about how they would turn out, without necessarily seeing the impact. Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t a murderer for watching him lower his wand in front of Dumbledore. He knew that Malfoy would never have gone so far as to kill him in spite of all the hatred he felt towards him, a feeling he too shared at that time.
Losing patience, he snapped his tongue on the roof of his mouth, turning completely to Malfoy, who did not give him the slightest attention.
He took off from the couch to grab the bottle with a trembling hand and pour another drink. The bottle neck hit the edge of the glass, spilling a little of the liquid that flowed between his fingers and left a few drops on the coffee table. Draco swore out loud, resting the whiskey and shaking his hand to drop the rest of the viscous alcohol.
Harry blinked his eyes as he released the pressure around his throat. It may have been a considerable advantage, but it was still very uncomfortable not to see them completely clear.
Harry blinked, seeming to come to his senses and turned his green gaze completely frightened at him.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the seriousness of the young woman rather than go with Ron on the only days their schedules allowed them to spend time together.
“But come on!” He said, “It could be fun, we would do a little like everyone else to change… And then it would blow us away, I feel like I’m spending my life in class or in the books studying my lessons…” he complained, his head resting on the table with his arms crossed.
He wanted to leave, even more than he had wanted when he arrived here. To see Malfoy had awakened in him a certain uneasiness. And he was even more surprised to feel a strong desire for him.
Harry was no longer able to fight when Malfoy touched him. He nevertheless had to force himself to leave him, so as not to arouse further suspicion.
"Of course, you know that I can’t hide anything from you" Harry said, feeling ashamed to lie to his best friend.
He looked up at the clock on the wall and saw that it was past 8:00 p.m. He sighed while passing a hand on his face which caused his glasses to rise a little on his nose and recoiled his office chair to stand up.
But Harry was far too aware of what was going on. He was far too present in his exchange with Ginny. Nothing seemed to want to disconnect him until that made him come, to have so much pain it was good, to be afraid of it.
Harry’s anger was renewed, burning his whole body and then contracting his muscles painfully as he stared at Malfoy who looked at him with contempt.
“The degree of Master of potions…” he blew for himself, remembering the scroll framed on the wall of the living room.
Draco moves to go back to kissing Harry's neck, but he stops right before his lips touch skin. He remembers they're outside, and as much as he's having fun just lavishing Harry, he doesn't want to continue any further until they're inside. Nothing more than kissing and making out is going to happen tonight - they don't need to speak verbally to agree on that - but who wants to say their first proper make out session with their first proper boyfriend was in a cemetery? Certainly not Draco.
"Stay. Merlin knows I won't be sleeping anytime soon, and, well, admittedly, Malfoy, I rather enjoy your company when you're not being a cheeky shit."
Draco's ears perked up at the mention of Potter. He discreetly lifted his eyes from his book and watched as Granger took a seat beside Weasley. She'd just come down from tucking Potter back into bed after a night in the infirmary, if he wasn't mistaken.
Draco was left on his back, panting and wondering what the hell had just happened. Was he dreaming? He must have been dreaming. It was the only plausible explanation for the mind fuckery he was currently experiencing.
"Nothing." Harry cringes. He replied way too quickly. "I mean, why would anything be wrong? I'm fine."
Harry leaned back in his chair and pat his stomach, groaning in the delight of feeling full. Draco would have done the same if he felt brave enough. He, too, felt stuffed, his stomach heavy with rich foods that the house elves had been kind enough to deliver.
Yet now, as he thinks about it, it makes sense that Harry remaining in the closet would become a (bigger) issue. Draco had wanted to protect him, keep him safe, but maybe what Harry needs is to break the mould he has been forced into. The Boy Who Lived may have been the Chosen One, but he is also human. He has needs and desires like anyone else. And nobody should ever deny him that, least of all Draco himself.
He hadn't meant to eavesdrop, but he couldn't just ignore the latest news about Potter's state, whether or not it was intended to be heard by his ears. Everyone knew that Potter hadn't slept properly since their return to Hogwarts to complete their studies - hell, he probably hadn't slept properly since the start of the war - and concern for the wellbeing of the Saviour of the Wizarding World was growing. Draco hated to admit that he was worried about stupid Scarhead, and he hoped he could ease his guilt and the guilt of Pansy and Blaise by getting some information from Granger and Weasley. Unfortunately, all they did was confirm what everyone already knew and feared: Potter was struggling and nobody knew what to do.
That much was true. If you had told fifth year Draco that one day after the war he would be dining with Potter and would inevitably shove a whole treacle tart in his mouth, he never would have believed you, and you'd most likely end up in the infirmary for talking such rubbish. Now, it seemed almost natural for Draco to do something so absurd. It felt like he could be a kid again, instead of a mentally disturbed young man who fought in a war. Potter was good for things like that.
"What now?" Harry says. He sound a lot less...turned on; his voice is steadier, his eyes clearer, and Draco realises he must sense his hesitation.
"I should get going, then," Draco said. He made to stand, but Potter's hand shot out and grabbed at Draco's hand that still remained on the table. They both froze, unsure of the next move.
Harry looks up at him through his eyelashes, keeps his lips on the Dark Mark as he says, "This okay?"
And right on time, as the wind picks up and rustles the leaves on the trees, Malfoy appears out of thin air. His loafers make a dull thud on the grass as he walks over. He's wearing a heavy trench coat and a smart pair of slacks that Harry is sure costs more than he can think of. It makes him cringe when he sees Malfoy step into a damp patch of grass. Harry is sure his shoes will be dirty, but they're as spotless as  ever. Trust Malfoy to magic his fucking loafers.
"You weren't the one who shoved a whole treacle tart in his mouth all at once," Draco grumbled once he swallowed the damned thing. He screwed up his face at the taste, then reached for his glass of water and gulped down what was left until he was sucking down droplets.
It was Harry's turn to choke on his spit. Draco tried not to laugh too loudly, but it was hard to when Harry looked so flustered. A thought crossed Draco's mind without much warning - Harry rather suited deep reds. No wonder he looked so good in his robes -
Draco gave Potter a small smile. He wasn't sure what for, exactly, but it felt fitting. Potter looked confused for only a second before he was returning the smile - except, it was overtaken by a loud yawn that only seemed to make him look even more exhausted than before.
He knew better than to presume that this was the cure for Harry's sleeping problems. It wasn't sustainable in the long run, and they'd only been friends for a few hours - official friends for half an hour if you wanted to get specific. Draco couldn't always stay in Harry's room, and no doubt Harry didn't always want him in here. Hell, it probably wasn't even Draco that had helped Harry fall asleep. If he wanted to think realistically, it was probably the safety of a warm body and physical contact that finally got him to sleep.
Draco tsked at Harry in a rather affectionate way. "Bit sneaky of you, isn't it, Potter? Well, I suppose not, given your history. Actually, I'm oddly pleased."

I cuddle my friends, and we're friends, so that's what we're doing. It's easy because we don't have to complicate it. We've done enough of that."

He began to pace across the floor of his room, wondering how he was ever going to get Potter alone when his best friends were around him all the time. They flanked him like guards on patrol, kept him safe and never left him. Draco couldn't blame them - after everything that had happened, even Draco was afraid to be alone. He tried to stay by Pansy and Blaise's side as much as possible, and he wrote to his mother most days, just to make sure she was alive, if not completely sane. Granger and Weasley had every right to stay by Potter's side. The only time they dared leave him was during meal times, but they were far and few between -
