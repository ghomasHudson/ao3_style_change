“Put this on the hob, and then add a few pinches of salt.” He handed the now heavy pot to Malfoy, allowing his fingers to linger against the other boy’s a few seconds longer than strictly necessary to transfer the cookware.
“Yes! They’re my favorite biscuits!” Lily squealed, finally sliding out of her father’s arms and taking the empty chair next to Draco. “Can I have one, dad? Instead of a sticker on my chart?” She turned to Draco and said proudly, “I didn’t have any wee accidents all week!”
“I’m not letting you in! I’m using the bloody bathroom!” comes Harry’s response.
“Harold Amelia Bedelia Buckingham Potter the third,” Jonathan says seriously. “You’ve known Draco for most of your life. You’ve been raising a child together for over six years! You’re in love with the man. I think you know him very well. Even if, for some unknown reason, he didn’t return your feelings - which, if he doesn’t, then Meryl Streep didn’t deserve an Oscar for her portrayal of Miranda Priestly and
“Can this game be over, please?” Harry asked the crowd at large. He was mortified by the attention.
“Fuck! Oh, gods, Draco! Your arse is so fucking
When he’d informed his mother of his impending divorce and relocation, she’d merely raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow and commented, “How thoroughly modern,” before returning to her needlepoint.
!” Draco looks outraged and stomps out of the room after Harry.
“Oh, for the love of -” Granger grabbed Draco’s right wrist and looked down at her watch. “Have you ever had a panic attack, Malfoy?” Granger asked, her voice seeming to come from very far away. “Your pulse is skyrocketing.”
Draco is wearing soft-looking gray joggers, a dark green vest, and a knit cardigan. The joggers leave little to the imagination.
“You really give yourself too much credit, Draco,” Hermione had teased him one day in his lab in Paris, her hair in a frizzy halo that reminded him so much of her at fourteen that he had taken to calling her ‘Granger’ all day.
The two boys looked at each other then, and broke down in laughter. Tears were streaming from Malfoy’s eyes and Harry was bent double, clutching his stomach. He hadn’t laughed that hard in ages. When they’d recovered sufficiently, they grinned at each other and continued to wash the pile of ceramics in front of them.
It is neither gentle nor kind. It absolutely does boast (me), and envy (him), and insist on its own way (both of us). I have to assume that Saint Paul was coming from a place of woeful inexperience when he expressed those sentiments to the Corinthians.
Draco took her hand in his, surprised at the strength of her grip. “Draco Malfoy. Former Death Eater. Wizard. Gemini,” Hermione - she was Hermione now, he supposed - made an inelegant noise and he smiled at her. “Yes, Gemini. Currently unemployed, aspiring Potions Master. Son to a father with visions of grandeur who has gone mad in Azkaban, and to a mother who was just yesterday wearing an orange jumpsuit for collecting refuse that she’s altered to look like a classical A-line gown. And that’s using the muggle method, mind you. Sewing machine and all.”
________________
On the other side of the room, Ron sat at the table with a plate laden high with latkes.
“Oh, you’d like that, wouldn’t you Potter? You know I can’t be in the direct sunlight for that long! My skin can’t handle it, as you are well aware.”
“I can’t wait to plan their wedding!” Tan says excitedly. “Do you think we could do a special episode? How long before one of them proposes?”
[Scene cuts to show Harry and Draco standing close together, talking to Pansy Parkinson. Draco’s arm is slung around Harry’s hip, and he’s gesturing somewhat wildly with his free hand, Harry’s head thrown back while he laughs.]
When he returned to the fire empty-handed and silent, Malfoy took one look at him and burst into laughter. “Oh gods, Potter, did you just walk into your cabin without knocking? Did you seriously not notice all three of them leave fifteen minutes ago? That’s priceless!”
?” Harry asks, his cheeks turning a dark red.
“I do not have antiquated views of sexual relationships! I have no problem with polyamory, I just don’t spend much time thinking about Ron and Hermione’s sex life... “ Harry trailed off, not sure he wanted to get into this conversation with Malfoy.
“To make it up to me, I want you to accio the lube over here. Wordlessly. Wandlessly.” Draco was now sitting up on Harry’s hips, smirking with his arms crossed over his chest.
“Well, yeah, I think so!” Harry answers. “To Teddy, I mean. I told him I loved him this morning when he suggested we have some wake-up cuddles.”
[Harry interview/confessional: Of course, I mean, Draco is an adult! He can wear whatever he wants! I just wasn’t expecting to see … those.
oOoOoOoOoOo
Just then, Lily came running into the room, still wearing only her underpants. “Hi! I’m Superman and I’m here to save the day!” She crashed into Draco’s legs and stumbled backwards, laughing.
“For that kiss… you told me last week … please, forgive me.” Harry hung his head, feeling like a complete arse.
Saul and Sophia never tried to get Harry to talk more than he wanted to or was able, and they were sensitive to him when he couldn’t finish a story. A plate of rugelach and a kerchief were always pushed towards him when he needed it; a warm hand placed on his arm to let him know they were there. They gently encouraged him to write back to his friends and family, and they wrapped Hermione and Ron in tight hugs when he finally brought them ‘round to the deli.
“Hey! Don’t go. We can talk about something else. How ‘bout United’s chances for the league title this year?”
“Auntie Luna said she seemed to be growing another baby in her belly because all the wrackspurts kept clear away from her but the butterflies in Neville’s greenhouse were hovering by her head.” Lily continued to spin around the kitchen, using her slippers to propel herself across the polished wood. “I’m going to wake up Jamie. Don’t have sex in here while I’m gone!”
“My mistake,” Draco replied, looking at her seriously. “Why don’t you show me what a superhero would wear to a nice dinner? Perhaps trousers and a bowtie?”
“She’s my ex wife! I could ask.”
want to re-learn what it’s like to try and sleep without his heavy arm thrown over my waist or without his snores interrupting my REM cycle.
.” Harry throws the robes on the small sofa and takes several steps forward before stopping suddenly. “Is this—did I forget a holiday? Or an anniversary?” He asks, looking concerned.
Hermione looked up to stare at her boyfriend, who was holding the pieces of a broken quill in his clenched fists. “Ronald…” she began.
Hermione sipped her coffee calmly. “Get your stories straight, you two, or I swear I’ll floo Narcissa straight away and tell her you eloped.”
strange and said the
“Hi! Hello! I’m Hermione Granger! It’s so nice to see all of you! I’m such a big fan!” Hermione gestures to the man next to her. “This is my partner, Ron Weasley. We’re Harry’s best friends.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Right, yeah, OK. What about me, then?”
“I think you should put us all out of our misery and just fuck Malfoy already. K?” She slurred her speech a bit, but was smiling serenely at Harry. “Maybe your big dick would finally make him shut up and give us all some peace.” She laughed at her own joke and Harry heard Ron groan.
“Harry, Draco. Let me ask you two a question. Were your families affectionate when you were younger? Did your parents tell you they loved you very often?” Karamo asks.
“Let the boy alone, bubbala,” Saul said, winking at Harry and pushing the plate of rugelach towards him.
“Oh, Draco.” Said Harry sadly, catching on to his train of thought and shaking his head. “She is, though. She
Harry and Draco look at each other sadly. “Oh Teddy,” Draco begins. “We absolutely love you!”
[Draco interview/confessional: Am I happy about this? Absolutely not. Would I do anything to make my son happy? Obviously. If it takes five gay men picking apart my wardrobe, well, I suppose that parenting takes sacrifices. And it’s completely worth it to watch Harry squirm.]
“Of course it’s not a no! I’m not the one who’s absolutely mental.” He grabbed the box out of Harry’s hand and with his own hands shaking, took the gold band out.
“Papa,” Scorpius began, looking gravely at Draco. “Albus and I prepared a list of reasons why we should be allowed to have a sleepover, but we can’t really write yet so we just have to tell the reasons to you.”
[Scene shows Draco carrying a giant cake in the shape of several frolicking dolphins, aglow with candles, towards Teddy, who is seated at a large table with Troggy on his lap, party hat still in place.The crowd sings “Happy Birthday” enthusiastically.
When the last wave of his orgasm had rolled over him, Draco sighed and went slightly limp. Harry hefted him onto his back and he straddled him, furiously pulling himself off.
“Draco,” Harry began, taking a seat in the matching armchair opposite him.
Teddy sighs dramatically. “Well, if you’re sure.” He bumps his small fist against Karamo’s. He turns to Harry and Draco. “Dads, you have to behave for them! Draco, no hexing anyone. Even if they insult your robes! And Harry, you have to fess up about your holey pants, OK?”
Draco winked and sat up, grabbing the lube from his bedside table. He opened the cap and spread some onto his fingers, rising up onto his knees so that he could reach back for his hole before squeezing a bit more out and looking at Harry expectantly. “You ready?”
Harry laughed. “He looks exactly like you do when you make that face. It’s adorable.”
“Yes! Yes, perfectly fine,” Draco said and cleared his throat, hoping that his emotions weren’t writ all over his face. He’d become increasingly terrible at masking his feelings as he’d gotten older; Astoria used to tell him that he’d used up all his Occlumency skills the year the Dark Lord had lived at the Manor. With the way that Harry was looking at him right now, smiling softly with his green eyes sparkling, Draco knew that he probably looked about as smitten as he felt.
“Oooh, Potter. What exciting new information! How big is it? Can I see?” Pansy looked like Christmas had come early.
“What’s wrong, Lils?” he asked, opening his arms and letting her jump onto his lap.
“Hey! You twat! That’s not what happened!” Harry said laughing despite himself. “It’s true that we had a small row but we cleared it up and I realised that I couldn’t bear him thinking that I would some day up and leave. So I proposed. And he called me insane but he accepted.”
Draco shrugs. “I’m sure they’ve seen worse than the saviour of the wizarding world snogging his boyfriend.”
“If you hurt him, though, you know I’ll fucking kill you. I’ve done things for that bloke that most people wouldn’t dream of. And I have a whole arsenal of others ready to hide your ferrety body if you step out of line.” Ron smiled. “So. Yeah. Don’t fuck this up.”
“Oi! I am not getting a gut!” Harry shouted over the laughter of his guests.
The house-elf mutters something unintelligible and retreats from the kitchen with a loud pop.
Draco felt himself blush, but he tried to cover his embarrassment with his trademark snark. “Yes? Keep going, by all means. I never tire of others extolling my virtues.”
“You are wearing my clothes, Draco.”
Harry exchanges relieved looks with Ron, and at that moment a white blur comes racing into the sitting room and crashes into Antoni’s legs.
Draco’s cheeks darken and he clears his throat. “Well, that’s…”
“Papa, that was a terrible hug! You are usually very good at hugging.” Scorpius was standing next to Al and smiling. “Try again! Mr. Harry, I promise you my papa can give the best hugs.”
Harry choked. “For the love of Merlin, Draco!”
“Oh, right. Harry.” Draco smiled. “And please call me Draco.”
“Ok DD.” Lily said distractedly, still rifling through her papers determinedly.
“What? No!” Harry said quickly. I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed and he worried at the skin around his left thumb nail, one of his more obvious tells that he’s lying.
“Yes, thank you.” Draco removed his scarf and placed it on a rack with Scorpius’ coat.
Harry suddenly realised that he had neither wallet nor wand on him. He felt a blush rise to his cheeks and he stuttered out, “I...err... I haven’t got my wallet. I don’t have any muggle money on me. But I can run back home and maybe apparate back? Do you have a Floo? I’m so sorry. I can’t believe this. I promise I’ll return straight away!”
They sat in the empty classroom for hours, discussing the past two years of their lives and sometimes even delving into their Hogwarts years. When they finally stood up, backs cracking and arses numb from the wooden floor, they made plans to meet again in Hermione’s lab. She had won a fellowship from St Mungo’s to continue her own research into memory studies, and was quite interested in Draco’s ideas.
“Yes, well. OK.” Draco couldn’t help the words that spilled from his mouth. “Thank you?” It came out as a question.
“What?” Draco said, finally opening his eyes and looking at Harry. “Sorry?”
[Scene cuts to Teddy’s newly redecorated room, which now sports a reading nook, a bunk bed, and a ceiling charmed to show a partly cloudy yet pleasantly sunny sky.]
“Right, he came back! Five minutes later he came into the kitchen and set a big bowl of matzo ball soup in front of me. He told me I was having a ‘matzo ball soup emergency’ and to eat and to listen to him. He told me that he had fallen in love with my Dad when he was fifteen. That he had been completely and totally certain that he was truly, madly in love with Harry Potter. But that he hadn’t dared to say anything to him for another fifteen years, and even then it was only because Dad had made the first move. DD told me in no uncertain terms not to give up hope. He explained that I needed to give Teddy space, to recognise that at the moment the age difference really was a ‘bit inappropriate,’ and to go have my own experiences. To go out and do all the things he hadn’t done as a teenager - go on dates, go to parties, make new friends, figure out what I was passionate about in life. And it’s the best advice that I’ve ever gotten.” Jamie smiled at Draco and felt a tear run down his cheek. “I don’t think that Teddy and I would have ever ended up here without you, DD. You reminded me that I had to actually be me, to figure out who that was, before I could focus on finding someone who would complement that. I remember feeling so incredulous, so skeptical! But then I started to watch you and Dad. You complement each other in a way that I’ve never seen in any other couple, and I realised that I wanted that. I wanted a relationship like yours. To have the person that made me whole. And you, Edward Remus Lupin, you make me whole.” Teddy stood up and put his arm around Jamie’s waist. “So thank you, DD. For showing me what I could aspire to have. And for recognising a matzo ball soup emergency when you saw one. I love you.” Jamie raised his champagne. “To my parents, who show me every day what it means to love and be loved. Cheers!”
“I really want to continue this, but we’re both sorta drunk and if we’re going to do anything more than kiss then we should do a sobering charm. Or we don’t have to do more than kiss! Or wait until tomorrow. Whatever you want.” Harry stroked Malfoy’s cheekbones with his thumbs, waiting to hear Malfoy’s decision.
Draco laughed. “That I can relate to. I’ve a fantastic Mind Healer.”
Harry turns, bemused. “Err, no? I think it’s a habit...I call him Draco usually, but sometimes I forget and revert back to what we called each other when we were young.”
“Of course I love Draco,” Harry says immediately, then freezes, his hands still in a bowl of fenugreek seeds.
Harry chuckled and pinched one cheek before diving back in, lapping at Draco and reaching forward to cup his balls.
“No, Hermione, it’s ridiculous! They can’t just pretend that’s acceptable behavior in a common area! I should never be subjected to that much of Harry’s arse!” He gestured over towards the bay window, where Harry and Draco had at one time been practicing yoga together, but had apparently devolved into fevered snogging on their mats in the past five minutes.
Draco rolls his eyes.
“You know, if you continue to use that tone with me then you’ll be sleeping alone tonight!”
“Well, we were thinking that it would be really informal and -“ Harry cut off abruptly when Draco elbowed him and hissed at him to acquiesce. “I mean of course! Hermione, come on, anything for you.” Harry amended.
Dudley nodded his head. “You’ve been in coming in for months. It’s nice to put a name to the face. I usually just call you, ‘blond bloke who smells like flowers.’”
“Kreacher would punish himself severely, but his new masters have forbidden it,” Kreacher responds, looking disappointed and disapproving at the same time.
“Call us when you’re ready,” Karamo interrupts, smiling widely. “At ‘some point in the future.’ Until then, we’re going to enjoy some much deserved rest at the Fab Five’s London Loft, where we can watch you three prepare to host your family for Teddy’s birthday celebration.”
Then Hermione Granger came to give a seminar on her research in adapting muggle treatments to aid Healers - she was making great strides in the field of remedying memory loss and dementia in older witches and wizards. She strode into the makeshift classroom that they’d been afforded in the bowels of the Ministry, her head held high with the sleeves of her research robes pushed up past her elbows. Her hair was as bushy as ever, but she had cultivated it to ring her head in an afro (Draco recognised the style from their unit on the cultural movements of the 1960’s and 70’s) that suited her well. She presented her research in a straightforward fashion; the passion she had for her research was evident. Draco’s attention never wavered, although his gaze often flicked to the thin white scars he could make out on her dark forearm. His stomach rolled as he clenched his first over his own left forearm, thumb stroking the scar tissue that lingered there.
Draco dropped his head back and Harry groaned loudly, letting the hot, wet heat swallow him. He usually gave Draco a few moments to adjust, but Draco pushed all the way back immediately and began fucking himself on Harry’s dick.

“Early Gray is perfect, thank you.”
“I deserve all the credit that’s ever been given to any mortal, Granger. But to what are you referring in this instance?” Draco drawled from his prone position, carefully studying the reaction happening in the cauldron below him.
I nod and Harry’s smile turns into something almost feral. I can see the outline of his thickening cock through the material of his trousers and I smirk.
“I don’t know about you, Potter, but I certainly expected more out of this experience than taking notes on soil composition. Orion Malfoy’s journals are full of daring adventures. Did you know that the wizards in Pompeii actually caused Mount Vesuvius to erupt? They were attempting to enact an experimental ritual involving blood and fire that would allow them to increase their sexual prowess, and, according to the memoirs of Pliny the Middle Child, it had simply ‘got completely out of hand.’”
The next afternoon, Harry and Malfoy sat in the shade near the cabins washing the pottery they had unearthed that day. Harry had to admit that when he heard he’d be going on an archaeological excavation he’d assumed it’d be somehow….sexier? He imagined that he’d be digging up all manner of treasures, maybe even battling complicated curses that ancient wizards had placed on their tombs. After Ron went to Egypt before second year and told him all about the complex muggle-repelling hexes and Dark Objects that were now housed in museums, he’d gotten his hopes up. Instead, it seemed like archaeology was a lot more about sorting through fragments of broken clay vessels while keeping meticulous notes and a lot less about battling unspeakable ancient evils.
“Oh you absolute angels! I love you all. I’m so excited to keep watching you grow as a family.”  Tan says, wrapping Harry up in a hug before moving on to Draco.
with this family!”
“Alright, Harry? I’ve come for the monsters! Are they ready?” she called.
Harry fell onto his back and they both lay boneless and trying to catch their breath.
So of course I, ever the prat, had told him that if he was trying to convince me that his prowess in magic was simply the result of positive thinking, I’d deck him.)
Harry got up, flicking off his friends and turning to go to back to his cabin and away from these horrible, horrible people.
“Who’s staring at who’s arse?” asked Lily, running into the kitchen with her homework folder clutched in her hands. Draco thought that she looked like some sort of Dickensian orphan: the long plait that he had so carefully woven her red hair into this morning was fighting a losing battle to keep her unruly curls off of her face, her jumper was falling off of one shoulder and was covered in what he assumed (hoped) was paint splatter, and her leggings had a hole in one knee that definitely hadn’t been there before school.
She dropped her forehead onto the wooden table in front of her, completely done with the men in her life.
“No,” Harry admits. “Absolutely not. We’ve had moments where I thought, ‘sod it all, I’m going to tell him how I feel,’ but I have Teddy to think about, yeah? What if Draco’s disgusted and wants nothing to do with me romantically, and then it’s horribly awkward at home, and he decides to move out or something? I couldn’t do that to our family.”
Bobby makes a sound of agreement. “Ok everyone, let’s get ready to get down and dirty with the United Kingdom’s brightest wizarding hero and his one true love!”
Gathering himself, Harry looked down at his own dusty work boots, baggy cargo pants caked with mud, and plain white shirt that stuck to his shoulders from sweat. Malfoy’s outfit, of course, was as pristine as it was on the first day of the excavation. Harry grabbed the hem of his filthy shirt and brought it up to his forehead, wiping the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked up and saw Malfoy staring at him with his mouth hanging open before his features quickly shifted into his trademark sneer.
Harry cocked his head. “So, you’ve never…? I mean, you weren’t in love?”
“What’s it called when you only love one person your whole life? Like Jamie loves Teddy? And Zayde loved Bubbe? Is that, like, onesexual?” Asked Al, a serious expression on his face.
“Bobby, this is fantastic,” Harry says, clapping him on the shoulder. “I don’t know how to thank you.”
“Yes, but you’re the Chosen One. Call and remind them that you broke into the Ministry once before and you’ll do it again if they don't acquiesce to your demands.”
[Jonathan, Bobby, Karamo, Antoni, and Tan are all standing awkwardly, watching the back and forth between Harry and Draco play out. Troggy yips from where he’s sitting in Antoni’s arms.]
Harry gives Draco a quick once over as they approach the storefront. “You can change back into robes as soon as we’re done in the Muggle shop! And you look fine. I’m sorry that between the two of us our tailoring charms are shit, but I did the best I could. If you hadn’t told off Kreacher this morning I bet he would’ve fixed those trousers.”
“Yeah, yeah. I know I’m an ‘uncoordinated git,’ get it out now.” He gestured for Malfoy to continue laughing.
But Harry didn’t move to stop Draco; he looked down at him reverently and simply watched as Draco unbuttoned his denims and unzipped his flies. Draco’s heart was racing as he pushed Harry’s pants down to his thighs and allowed his hard cock to spring free. Draco grinned; he’d imagined Harry’s dick thousands of times, but his fantasies had nothing on reality: Harry was long and thick, more than a mouthful but not intimidatingly large. Draco leaned in, maintaining eye contact with Harry, and licked a long strip from base to tip before taking the head into his mouth and sucking lightly. Harry bucked forward and swore, clenching his fists at his sides.
Teddy looks distressed. Antoni turns the burner on the stove off and shares a look with Karamo.
Teddy nods, beaming, and claps his hands. “Did you have a kiss, then?”
“Huh,” Harry said. He sat back in his chair. “Why didn’t you find a man to marry and adopt? You could always use a surrogate if you’re concerned about blood.”
Ron claps his hands, calling the group to attention. “Right! Yeah, thanks, Hermione. I know it sounds like a lot, but honestly, there’s no family more deserving of happiness than this lot.”
A few minutes later, Padma and Blaise decided that they should begin another game that involved a deck of cards, so Harry got up to go to his cabin, where he was sure Ron had a pack somewhere.
Harry sighs dramatically. “I might as well, seeing as how I’ve already admitted it to you while cameras are rolling! Maybe this is the push I needed?”
“No, let me speak. I’ve wanted to kiss you since we were ‘fifteen bloody years old,’ “ Draco said, using scare quotes to parrot Harry’s words back to him. “I can’t imagine what my face must’ve looked like after you’d kissed me, but I certainly wasn’t in pain. I was confused, and nervous, and still am. I don’t know precisely why you kissed me in your kitchen last night, but I’d quite like it if you kissed me again. And again. Really, you have permission to kiss me whenever you’d like.”
I invested in a black ensemble, as I figured that it would present the most stark contrast with my pale skin. The silk, thigh-high stockings are topped with lace and have a seam running up the back of the legs, which the woman at the shop assured me would make my legs look longer and leaner than they already are. I have to admit that the stilettos that I’ve managed to jam my feet into accentuate my calf muscles nicely (although I’ll be lucky if my toes aren’t currently bleeding). I chose the garter belt that sits around my hips because of the small bows on the clips that hold up the stockings—they seemed to add something almost demure to the otherwise completely wanton display. And after careful consideration, I decided to wear the lace panties that Pansy had gifted me, as they seemed to have quite the effect on Harry.
“Don’t change the subject, Mister Vanquisher of All Evil! Are you going to tell Draco you love him in a ‘I want to have your babies and hyphenate our last names and buy a summer home on Fire Island type of way’?”
Dudley, the genial, bearded man who’d always been behind the counter appeared from behind a swinging silver door and approached the register to take their order.
Draco was completely caught off guard, so he didn’t react when Harry pushed past him and walked into the lab.
“We love you too, Teddy,” Draco and Harry say in unison.
“Oh, no dear. I left a long, long time ago. After the Ministry forbade witches and wizards from interfering in the Muggle Second World War. My parents and I joined the Magical Resistance, where we worked alongside muggles on the continent. We didn’t want to live in a world that told us not to use our magic to save our own families! And besides, that’s how I found my Saul.” She beamed at her husband.
“Aunt Hermione! IT WORKED! IT WORKED! THEY’RE HERE!” Teddy screams and runs to hug his aunt.
[The scene cuts to show Jonathan raking his fingers through Harry’s shorter, tousled curls. His usually unruly hair looks stylish and clean. Harry is turned away from the mirror, and Jonathan is looking at his work delightedly.]
Dr Song cleared her throat. “Gentleman, part of this exercise is to promote unity and teamwork. I’m quite disappointed that after an entire week, not to mention an entire school year spent paired with one another, you’ve not managed to put aside your schoolyard squabbles and come together for the benefit of the historical record.”
“Is that a troll leg?!” Bobby gasps.
“No. Try again. You need to take yourself seriously before anyone else will!”
“Oh please, you haven’t grown since sixth year,” Draco scoffs, looking distinctly uncomfortable.
Moments later the three missing boys thundered down the stairs and stumbled one after another into the kitchen.
“If this is moving too quickly for you, I’m sure Bobby has kept your atrocious furnishings somewhere,” Draco snaps, turning to inspect the photographs arranged along the mantle.
Harry corrected himself,
“Oh, you’re no fun!” complained Pansy. “I can promise that Draco would be absolutely delighted to see your massive cock. He’s the biggest size queen in the greater London area! And I think we all know he’d be perfectly happy to have you -” Pansy was cut off by Blaise’s hand coming to cover her mouth.
[Scene fades out, theme music plays. Credits roll.]
“Hello! Hi! Come in!” Harry gestured with his free hand to the foyer. Draco and Scorpius stepped inside. The front hall was littered with shoes and coats in various colours and sizes. Draco thought it looked exactly like a well-lived home should.
“Oh, Teds! We don’t have to do this now. I’m so sorry. We can talk about this later! Let’s open more presents, yeah?” Harry says quickly, putting his arms around Teddy in an effort to comfort him.
“You’ve been torturing me for weeks, you prat. My turn.” Harry walked backwards a few steps and pulled his old Chudley Cannons shirt over his head and removed his glasses, tossing both carelessly on his bed. Malfoy stood still against the door, his erection tenting his cotton joggers obscenely as he took in the tanned skin and light dusting of black hair on Harry’s chest. “Turn around, Malfoy.” Harry undid the button and zip of his denims, lowering them along with his boxers and stepping out of both so he was left naked. Malfoy gasped a bit as he took in the long line of Harry’s cock, standing to full attention and leaking slightly at the tip. Harry took himself in his fist and gave himself a few rough strokes, his eyes glinting dangerously. “I said turn.”
“And you, Mr Auror, will be introducing well-fitting clothing to your wardrobe,” Tan says to Harry, holding up an Oxford shirt in pale green against Harry’s chest. “I can tell you’re the sort to avoid fitting rooms at all costs. But I’m sorry my dear, you’re going to grin and bear it for the sake of your son and for the sake of your bum. It’s my mission to find you something that actually accentuates what the founders gave you, not hide it.”
“Granger. Ah, that is… Ms Granger,” he took a steadying breath, “that was a remarkable presentation. Thank you for taking the time to come talk to us about your research. I’d wondered if you’d looked into the use of antidepressant potions in patients with severe memory charm damage? I’ve been doing my own research into their properties and from what you’ve just said, Healers aren’t concerned enough with maintaining the mental health of the permanent residents of the Janus Thickey Ward. Perhaps you might be interested in discussing this further?” Draco finished in a rush, hoping that he’d managed to get his point out. He was also hoping that he’d not be punched in the face. Again.
“I’m glad you approve!”
Draco waited, unsure if he was meant to follow Harry into the closet or stay seated. After two and a half years, though, he was used to Harry’s rash style of decision making.
I straighten up and spin around, pushing at his chest so that he backs up towards the sofa. “Sit,” I command, straddling his lap when he acquiesces. I reach behind me and hold his cock steady at the base while I sink down onto him slowly.
“It sounds like you have a great life here, Teddy,” Karamo says. “What made you write us a letter?”
Harry sighed. “You’re a human being, Lils. Not a peanut. It’s just an expression.”
Draco pulled back, his eyes shining. “Bloody hell, Harry. How am I supposed to follow that? I’m the dramatic one in this relationship.” He took a deep breath and looked out at his friends and family. “Thank you, everyone” he began, “for giving me a chance. For allowing the past to be the past. I love Harry with all my heart, and it seems that he’s pretty fond of me, too. I’ll save the real heart-wrenching lines for the wedding. You’ve all been warned, so bring your tissues.”
Potter had the audacity to laugh with the children. He opened his arms again. “What do you say, Malfoy? Give it another try?”
He was not disappointed in his decision to brave the cold and the crowd to get his meal. The sandwich was delicious, and the potato salad was pleasantly spicy. Two days later he returned to again buy his lunch, this time ordering “The Deamus,” a grilled sandwich made with sharp Irish cheddar and chutney. By the time that winter was giving way to spring, Draco had made his way through most of the menu and hadn’t found anything he didn’t enjoy (although some of the Indian-inspired sandwiches and dishes were a bit too spicy for his admittedly delicate palate).
“I believe Ron mentioned locking you in a cupboard,” Tan says. “He seemed quite serious, actually.”
“Well, that was the most painfully awkward thing I’ve witnessed in ages! Thanks for the entertainment, Harry.” Draco looked around and saw the man at the register smiling broadly. “I’m Dudley, Harry’s cousin.” He held a meaty hand out to Draco, who took a few steps forward to meet him.
“Now you have to say it to each other. Don’t forget. Communication is key.”
“Never have I ever...gotten a handjob from an anonymous Scottish bloke at that one pub in Chelsea!” It was Ron’s turn, and the game had gone from vague proclamations to specific, personal attacks.
Draco nods and his hands go to his hair before he stops and grimaces. “I keep forgetting that I’ve chopped off all my hair,” he laments. His hair falls midway between his chin and his shoulders, and half of it is currently clipped back into a loose ponytail.
Harry laughs and pulls Draco towards him by the hips. “Thank Circe! Draco Malfoy approves!” He presses a kiss to Draco’s lips and takes a step back. “Shall we go see what Teds has decided to wear?”
I suppose that every now and then love can be fulfilling, compassionate, and remarkable (and kinky). And it can still be completely
“Draco, I think, maybe…” Karamo beings.
“Get back to me when he starts asking questions about sex,” Harry sighed, thinking of Jamie’s progressively more difficult-to-answer queries.
“I’m obviously no stranger to long, luxurious style!” Jonathan flicks a chunk of his long, brown hair behind his shoulder. “But it seems like maybe you’re ready for a bit of a change. What do you think about taking some of the length off? Nothing too dramatic, but I think this ‘do you’re working could use an update.”
, Harry thought. Draco reached down and brought Harry’s hands to his head; Harry quickly wound his fingers through the silky locks.
Harry laughs and Draco rolls his eyes. “And I’m the dramatic one?”
“Err, sorry about the silencing spell, but we needed some privacy,” Harry explains, blushing slightly.
[The camera pans from Hermione to the Fab Five, who are rendered speechless. Karamo has his mouth hanging open and Antoni looks impressed and a little turned on.]
Harry had a fleeting thought that he might die like this, buried inside Draco and overcome with pleasure and love. “Although,” he reasoned in his head, “this is a much better way to go than last time.”
“If you’re good helpers, then yes. We can have popcorn,” Harry replied as they made their way through to the Underground station. He hated taking all the kids on the Underground during rush hour, but it was the quickest way to get back to Shoreditch before the movers arrived. He had wanted to see Teddy off this morning before he left for his first year at Hogwarts, and Jamie had thrown an epic tantrum when Harry hinted that he might want to stay home instead of coming with. And where Jamie went, so went Al. And Lily. It had made sense at the time that he and Ginny made the plan, but now that the was shuttling his three children through the throngs of commuters, he wondered at his own stupidity. He had wanted a clean break, a way to say goodbye to living in the Wizarding World and to his marriage, and he felt like doing it at Platform 9 ¾ was a meaningful and fitting place to bid farewell. Ginny had rolled her eyes and called him a drama queen, but she’d had tears in her eyes and had pulled him into a crushing hug.
My name is Edward Remus Lupin but you can call me Teddy and I am seven years old. My dad and my mum died in the war when I was a tiny baby, so I’m being raised by my godfather who’s called Harry and my cousin who’s called Draco. I love them a lot and they’re my dads. We all live together in a big old house in London and also we have a West Highland Terrier called Troglobite and a house elf called Kreacher who is very grumpy. My Aunt Hermione lets me watch your show when I stay with her and Uncle Ron and you help people look prettier and also make their lives way better. My Harry and my Draco need someone to make their lives prettier and better by a lot. Harry wears a lot of clothes that are too big for him and sometimes have rips and Draco says that it drives him spare. And Draco only wears wizarding robes even when we have family time and I get to wear my jimjams. But what’s the most important thing for you to fix is that Harry and Draco are in love with each other but they pretend that they
“Godric help me,” Potter barely spoke above a whisper as he slowly lifted his hands to cup Malfoy’s arse. He kneaded his fingers into the supple flesh, admiring the way his olive-toned skin complimented the pale expanse of Malfoy. Harry leaned in and pressed a kiss to one of his cheeks, then grew bolder when nothing except a muffled groan came in response. He licked and bit at a fleshy spot and Malfoy pushed his arse back, meeting Harry’s mouth and silently demanding more. Harry had never done this before, but he’d read about it in
Harry stood up and faced Malfoy, placing his hands on his hips. Their trench was half a meter below the surface of the field, so he was forced to look up at Malfoy. The blond looked like he was ready for a jungle safari: he wore fitted khaki trousers, a long-sleeved button-down shirt with a many-pocketed canvas vest over it, and a bucket hat with its drawstring cinched to just below his chin. Harry refused to think he looked adorable.
Ginny waved and followed her children out of the room, winking at Harry before shouting, “see you soon, Malfoy!”
[The cameras follow as Harry leads the way up a grand, but old, staircase. At the first landing, he gestures down a well-lit hallway lined with several closed doors.]
“It means he’s their grandfather. Err, well...adopted grandfather. Do you know what that means?” Potter responded.
I can feel the hair on his chest against my back as his fingers flex and stretch inside of me.
“And then there’s the biggest reason, but it’s the Secret Reason that Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron told me to keep my lips sealed about so we can’t talk about it here.” Teddy mimes zipping his lips.
“Excellent! Yeah, just follow me. Kitchen’s through here.”
[The camera shakes as it attempts to follow Draco out of the kitchen. It stops abruptly behind him as he pounds on the door to the bathroom on the ground floor of the house.]
“Hmm?” Malfoy was leaning back on his hands, gazing up at the stars. “You mean other than the fact that they’re clearly gagging to shag each other?”
“What about physical touch, Harry?” Karamo asks again.
“At least I didn’t dress up like a dementor to try and throw a quidditch match,” Harry shot back.
“Good,” Harry said. “Also, will you tell Astoria that I fixed this thing between us? She can be right terrifying.”
Saul grinned and slid his glasses on. “Not in the slightest. Ms Goldblum asked after you, and seemed quite disappointed at the news that you had gone and shacked up with Draco.”
And I have spent every day of the past two and a half years thanking the universe for shoving us back together. Because you are my piece, Draco. You are that little bit of me that wasn’t complete and I was always looking for you, for my b’shert. And I’ve got you. And I’ll spend every day of the rest of our lives being thankful for your presence. For putting up with my temper and my hair and my impulsive method of decision making. For packing the kids’ lunches and making sure I don’t burn down the house when I try to use the toaster. For loving this crazy family and agreeing to become part of it. I’ll never let you go, Draco.” Harry leaned in and kissed him then, sighing into the familiar feel of Draco’s soft lips.
Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and tried to still him - or at least slow him down - but Draco just grinned at him in the mirror and kept his pace.
, for Merlin’s sake!”
“We promise to behave, Teddy. Now go have fun!” Harry says, grinning.
“Harry’s an Auror teacher so he shows all the new Aurors how to be good at dueling because he’s really good at it and also he loves to teach and he doesn’t want to be in the field like Uncle Ron because it’s very dangerous and he needs to be safe so that he can come home every night to me and Draco.”
After quickly tying her white hair into a bun at the nape of her neck, she turned to face Harry and gasped, “Oh my! It’s Harry Potter!” Her hand immediately flew to clap over her mouth and she grimaced. “Oy, what a thing for me to say! I’m sorry dear, I’m just surprised to see you! And in a muggle neighborhood! And here in our store! Saul, look! It’s Harry Potter!” The old man - Saul, apparently - nodded, looking faintly amused.
“It’s no problem, you know that. And Ron told me to remind you that he’s bringing the apple sauce so not to bother with that store bought stuff. He’s made at least four variations this year, so make sure to compliment all of them - he didn’t come to bed until two this morning because he kept tinkering with the cinnamon ratios.” Hermione leaned a hip against the island. “I wouldn’t say no to a cup of coffee, actually, boys. I know I’m supposed to be off caffeine but I just need a quick fix.”
__________________
Combining two households the month prior had been an enormous task, particularly since they had decided to move into the Potter/Weinberg townhouse in Shoreditch rather than into the much larger Malfoy home. Harry and Draco agreed that it would be for the best not to ask Saul to leave the home he had spent almost sixty years in, and the proximity to the Deli that Harry and Saul ran and to Draco’s potions laboratory made the decision an easy one. Fitting two more people into the already cramped space, however, was another story. The chaos of having four children under ten, one octogenarian, two owls, four goldfish, and one prickly pureblood under a single roof made Harry... blissfully happy. His home was rarely quiet before the addition of Draco and Scorpius, but their presence had added a joy to his days that he hadn’t known was possible. He wouldn’t call his marriage to Ginny unhappy - they had enjoyed a contented relationship and their children were absolutely the best part of his life - but they had never achieved anything resembling the spark that existed between himself and Draco. Every morning that he woke up next to Draco was a gift.
“Then. Don’t. Look. Up.” Draco pointed his finger at Harry’s chest and continued to shout at him. “Where else am I supposed to do this? In the dormitory? Where there is approximately three bloody feet between each bed? Or would you rather me do this in the Great Hall? How about I jump up on the table for my sun salutations? Hmm? Is that what you want, Potter?”
“Well, yeah, I mean, I shouldn’t have…”
“OK, so, I spent all night thinking about this. And I know that you think that you’ll only ever fall in love once, but that’s bollocks! You have no idea what you want when you’re fifteen bloody years old.” He looked into Draco’s eyes, suddenly looking determined and passionate. His green eyes sparkled in the low light of the lab. “So I’m throwing my hat in the ring. I like you. I like you… a lot. Perhaps more than I should, considering that I’ve only spent a few hours with you in the past decade. And I think that we could have something truly special, if you’d just consider a future with me.” He took a deep breath, seemingly to steady himself. “Would you consider going on a date with me?”
“He doesn’t like pet names,” Harry says, smiling. “Believe me. I’ve tried many. I think Mal-Mal was my favourite, although the strength of the stinging hex he sent me after I used that one definitely wasn’t warranted.”
“That’s our cue to leave you be for the night!” Tan says, standing up from where he’s sitting at the table. “Thanks for your hospitality. I can’t wait to continue this journey with you two!”
Draco huffed indignantly. “What’s so unbelievable about that?”
When they reached their destination, Malfoy waved his wand and the door opened to reveal what Harry could only assume had once been a cabin that looked exactly like his and Ron’s. “Do some redecorating, Malfoy?” Harry asked, looking at the lush green carpet, two full-sized beds with luxurious looking duvets, and mahogany furniture.
Draco meets Jonathan’s gaze in the mirror. “I …” he begins.
Case. In. Point.
“That means it’s time to spill the beans, boys! Where are your bedrooms?” Jonathan claps his hands in glee.
“No, Harry, I don’t think you’d ever say ‘ciao’ to anyone.” Draco answered.
“Draco, can you rinse these lentils?” Antoni asks, pushing the bowl of unwashed lentils towards the blond.
“I love you Harry, but I promise you I’ve never had any thoughts about you or your ‘giant dick.’” Ron called over, laughing and using scare quotes.
“Of course. Right. Well, I’d best be going. I’ll collect Scorpius in the morning. Goodnight, Potter.” Draco swept out of the room and walked briskly to the front hall. Harry hurried behind him.
Harry is close enough to me that he could reach out and touch me, but he doesn’t. Instead, he undoes his belt and shoves his pants and trousers down just enough to get his cock out, and starts to stroke himself using the knickers.
“Scorpius, come back here and lets order our lunch, please.” Scorpius walked back over to his father, frowning.
“You can’t use a charm on a muggle kitchen instrument. Just turn that knob,” Harry reached across Malfoy’s body, letting his arm brush against the taut line of his stomach, and flicked the knob. Harry was sure he imagined that Malfoy had leaned in slightly to his touch.
“So that’s a ‘no,’ then?”
“Dads! You’re being complete nutters. Karamo just told us how to communicate with each other!” Teddy stomps into the room, standing between Draco and Harry. “You’re in love and you want to kiss all the time so you should have the same bedroom. That way you can do that gross staring at each other thing and it’s easier if I have a bad dream ‘cause I can just come to one room to get cuddles.”
“You’re welcome, Scorpius, You’re welcome any time. And thanks for spending the day, Draco. It was really nice to have you here.” Harry smiled broadly held out his hand. Draco shook it, looking into his bright green eyes one last time before descending the cement steps that led to the street.
“Is the party over?” He asks sleepily, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Love is
Al nodded.
___________
Draco stood in the deli feeling like he had just been hit with the full body-bind curse. He hadn’t laid eyes on Harry Potter since his trial had taken place in the month following the war, but he’d thought of him nearly every day. Draco knew that he was in love with Harry - he’d accepted this fact in the middle of their fifth year at Hogwarts - but it had taken him several years to stop hating himself for it. Realising he was gay was one thing, but realising that he wanted to push his self-proclaimed arch nemesis into the nearest alcove and snog him senseless was something else entirely. He had a recurring nightmare in which, after being rescued from the burning Room of Requirement, he tried to embrace Potter and was immediately thrown back into the flames by his disgusted saviour.
Draco snorts. “I’ll submit to whatever ridiculous, non-permanent changes you want to make for the sake of my son. And besides,” Draco cranes his neck to lift an eyebrow at Harry and level him with a smirk. “You love my hair, Potter. You’d mourn its loss.”
Draco draws in a sharp breath and his head whips around to face Harry. “What?”
Harry snorted. “Don’t pretend you thought about your future with me in it back then!”
I am aware that I am completely addicted to this man, and it is
Draco scowls.
Draco stares at Harry, his cheeks pink. “You look quite … put together.”
“That’s very good, Lily,” Draco said politely. He was incredibly grateful that he hadn’t had to go through toilet training with more than one child.
“Harry, I’m not going to profess my undying love for you in this moment. It’s not the time.”
,” Draco responded, smiling despite his disgust at Harry’s atrocious pronunciation.
“You look like someone Teddy would be proud of, Harry,” Draco says.
“James, you know your father isn’t gay,” replied Draco before Harry had the chance to respond.
[Karamo confessional/interview: it’s clear that Harry and Draco are incredibly doting and loving fathers. Teddy is a bright and fun child, and it’s heartwarming to hear him talk about his life with his dads. What we need to get to the bottom of is why Teddy feels the responsibility to make them happy.]
?” Malfoy spat the word out as if it pained him.
“It was, as you can imagine, an absolute shitshow. Blaise lit the Parkinson tapestry on fire, Millicent fire-called her ex, and Luna was dancing starkers under the light of the moon, all before ten. The night only went downhill from there.”
Before Draco could think of a response, Harry continued. “What I mean to say is, we were played against each other in a war that neither of us were old enough to make any real decisions about, yeah? You were taught one thing growing up, and then threatened with the murder of your parents should you fail in what was obviously meant to be a suicide mission.”
When Harry opened the door to his and Draco’s bedroom a few hours later, he had mentally prepared his apology for not including Draco in the Charlie Vance situation and was ready to grovel.
“I simply inquired after some specific articles of Draco’s wardrobe that I wanted to ensure are safe and sound.”
Harry gripped Draco’s thighs with his fingers and leaned his torso into his legs, trying to connect their bodies as much as possible in their current positions. “This isn’t some fairy tale - although the obvious joke about being The Chosen Fairy isn’t lost on me. This is our reality. We lived pretty fucked up lives for the first eighteen years we were on this planet, and we deserve happiness. I’m gobsmacked every day that you’ve somehow found that happiness with me, and that is no mistake. I might not have known that I loved you since we were fifteen like you did with me, but you have to know that I’m there with you now. I want to spend every single day of the rest of my life with you next to me, reminding me that I can be a bit thick but that you love me despite it. That you see my chosen family and you also choose to be a part of it. I’m never going to realise that I’ve made a mistake being with you, because it’s
“Daaaaad.” Harry instantly recognised the beginning of a tantrum coming from his youngest. He opened his eyes and saw her running down the hallway, her pigtails coming undone and her chubby cheeks bright red.
“Oh, God, you look so gorgeous like this, Draco. Turn around, let me see all of you.”
“Either you do or you don’t,” Karamo interjects. “Be confident in your power and don’t waver in your statements! Make it clear that you know who you are and walk tall!”
He’d sent Astoria to gather Scorpius this morning at the Potter residence. He knew it was taking the coward’s way out, but he didn’t think that he could manage to actually look the man in the eye yet.
“Of course not. But I’ll always have Mimsy. She’s been with me since I was in the nursery.”
Draco reached out, aware that his hand was shaking but unable to do anything to stop it.
“Tell me about the potions that you make for your hair and skin,” Jonathan demands as he works his fingers through Draco’s wet hair. “They smell divine! Do you sell them?”
“No. Of course not. It’s not… it’s just not possible, Potter.” Draco finally looked up, scowling.
[Scene cuts to the Loft, where all five of the guys are in various levels of distress, crying and mopping at their tears.]
“That’s the second time in about one minute that you’ve mentioned my arse, Potter. Maybe the problem here isn’t my yoga practice. Maybe it’s that you want my perfectly sculpted and not at all scrawny arse!”
Draco just gaped at him, unable to formulate a coherent response.
“Quite,” Draco says shortly. “If you’ll get on with the insults regarding my wardrobe choices? I dare say we might be finished here before afternoon tea.”
“Mate, you literally stalked him for our entire sixth year. Everyone with eyes was on to your obsession!” Ron called out.
Harry pulled Ginny into as best a hug as he could manage with an 11 month old child strapped to his chest. “Bye, Gin.” Al and Jamie grabbed a hand on either side of their father, and together the four of them walked back through the barrier and out into King’s Cross.
“Your father is a crass beast!” Draco declares, throwing his arms up in exasperation. “This is going to be broadcast
[Antoni confessional/interview: Harry looks at Draco like he’s hung the moon, and Draco is no better. I can see why Hermione has no doubts about their feelings for each other. How we’re going to get two powerful, stubborn wizards to admit their feelings is another story. I’ve always had luck adhering to the old adage that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach!]
“Obviously. I can’t be expected to spend two weeks roughing it out here in the wilderness without at least having goosedown to comfort me at night.”
“It’s fine, really,” said Draco as he helped his son into his coat. “Scorpius loves the Underground. And if I’m honest, Floo-travel always makes me queasy.”
“Oh come on, love,” Harry stepped in, “you don’t need her to swear an Unbreakable vow.”
December 2013
“I’m glad you came. Both of you.”
Draco pulls Teddy to him in a hug. “Yes, Teddy. We are fine. Our family is intact, as it will always be.”
Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders, pulling him in again. “Just a moment, hmm?” He tugs Harry closer and kisses him again, letting his fingers sink into Harry’s artfully-tousled hair.
“Mum!” Lily cried, launching herself into her mother’s arms. “Guess what? Scorpius taught me how to roll my whole body over my head! Wanna see?” She wiggled down to the ground, and crouched down. Very slowly she set her head down between her legs and threw her legs over. “TA-DA!” She yelled.
“She is an icon! How can you call yourself a gay man and not worship at the altar of our queen Celestina?”
“When they tell you that they love you, do you believe them?”
“Oh, you have no idea, Harry,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes. “I have fifteen years worth of fantasies.” A trickle of sweat ran down Harry’s neck. Draco leaned over and licked it, eliciting another groan from him. “Would you like to see what else my mouth can do?”
Saul pushed back his chair to stand as Draco hurried over to him to shake his hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir. Your establishment is extraordinary. I think I’ve tried most of the menu and I’ve enjoyed it all.”
I could kiss Harry for hours. Days. Months. He kisses like his life depends on it; like if he doesn’t kiss me passionately and deeply then he’ll lose the privilege.
“Blimey, Draco…” Harry says breathlessly.
“Yeah, you’re right, Hermione. This is just too bloody much for anyone to take.” Harry stood up and marched over to the large bay windows that overlooked the lake. Draco Malfoy was currently bent over double on top of a large purple mat, his arms outstretched so that he formed an inverted V-shape. His blond hair was gathered into a knot at the top of his head, and he was clad in thin black joggers and a tight long-sleeved shirt. His eyes were closed, and he appeared to be concentrating deeply.
Malfoy turned to face Harry fully, and whatever snide remark he was surely about to make never made it out of his mouth. Malfoy’s eyes raked up and down Harry’s body, and he seemed utterly at a loss.
“We try to always have dinner together, but sometimes Harry has to work late or Draco is trying to finish a potion so we don’t get to every night.  But mostly we eat as a family. Kreacher cooks but also Harry and Draco help because sometimes Kreacher forgets ingredients because he is very old.”
. And I’m very wise. Did you know I have a Potions mastery?”
“Now’s as good a time as ever, you know.” Granger rubbed the thin white scars on her forearm. Draco wondered idly if it was as much a subconscious habit for her as it was for him.
Draco shrugs nonchalantly. “Well, he certainly looks less like he’s just rolled out of bed.” He clears his throat. “I suppose it’s a much more...distinguished look for him.”
[Montage of Tan walking Harry and Draco through the store and loading their arms with various pieces of clothing. Harry looks overwhelmed and Draco looks progressively more annoyed.]
“Can you imagine what you’d have said to me 15 years ago if I’d told you that one day you’d be raising your sons to be best friends?” Ron said, observing the scene with a raised eyebrow.
“Organic, good-for-you and good-for-the-earth type brands are super pops right now! I bet you could market them to Gen Z-ers and make an absolute killing. Send them gratis to some ‘gram influencers and you’ll be featured on a Buzzfeed listicle in no time.”
Teddy takes a deep breath and looks first at Draco, and then at Harry. “You want me to be your son forever?”
“Why are you crying? Is it that bad? Oh, Merlin. Please, Draco, don’t let this ruin our family! I’ll get over it. I prmmmph…” Harry’s voice breaks off, and the sound of fabric being pushed into the microphones that both men are wearing on their shirts is heard, along with the distinct sound of lips smacking against each other.
“I’m going to give you some direction, and then I’m going to show you how to recreate the style by yourself in the comfort of your own home. I think we’ll leave your stubble for now - it reads as ‘sexy and a little bit dangerous,’ right? Ready, chipmunk?”
Harry points his wand at Draco’s armoire. “Your turn, you posh git.” The door swings open and a drawer empties its contents onto the bed. “Let’s see what embarrassing pants you have!”
Following his instincts, Harry began to lean into Draco’s space. He came close enough so that his arms were bracketing Draco’s, his hands clutching the edge of the sink. He stopped and looked between the other man’s eyes, giving him time to signal that his advance was unwelcome. Draco’s eyebrows shot up, but he didn’t move out of the way - instead he took half a step forward. Harry closed the distance between them and pressed his mouth to Draco’s, his stomach fluttering as he felt soft lips press back against his own. He inhaled and the smell of dish soap and something faintly floral filled Harry’s nose. He drew back just enough to tilt his head and deepen the kiss, which stopped abruptly when Harry felt Draco’s hand press against his chest.
“That’s right, Kreacher. Why don’t you take a seat and join us for some tea?” Harry says pleasantly.
“Wonderful! Devastating! Sickening!” Jonathan says, and presents the salon chair to Draco, indicating with his arm that he should sit.
Harry moaned and felt his own orgasm build in him until it hit him full force, causing him to fall forward onto his left hand and watch as his spunk striped over Draco’s chin, lips, and cheeks.
Malfoy looked up, his lips red and his hair mussed. “First, I want you to keep calling me Draco. Second, I want you to fuck me. Can we do that?”
I smirk and turn around, throwing my arms around his neck. “Have at me,” I tell him before I lean in and kiss him.
Saul chuckled but bend to whisper something in Lily’s ear. The little girl giggled and said, “Sorry everyone!”
“I have the utmost respect for people who can master those devices, but I certainly don’t see a future for myself in such things.” Draco smiles. “Besides, I have Harry to navigate it all for me.”
Harry grins and leans in to whisper something in Draco’s ear, who turns bright red and swats at Harry’s arm. “Potter! Honestly!”
“Fuck, yes, Harry. I want your cum all over my face.”
The seminars were taught by visiting lecturers from various backgrounds and institutions. They first tackled basic muggle history and then moved on to more nuanced topics like art, technology, and entertainment. They went on trips to the British Museum, the War Rooms, and to the Tate Modern; they were tasked with cooking and cleaning without their wands; they visited hospitals and laboratories to see how muggles had not only survived in a world without magic, but had thrived as well. Draco quickly found out that almost all of what he’d been taught as a child were nothing but lies and stereotypes. He was embarrassed and angry, but glad that he had the opportunity to change.

So here I am, on an otherwise inconsequential and boring Tuesday night at the end of March, standing in front of my husband dressed to the nines in lacy lingerie.
_______________________
“Oi! Hush, all of you. I had a completely normal interaction with Malfoy today.” Harry set the lasagna in front of his family and sat down. “No more comments from the peanut gallery!”
“Hermione, would you please stop referencing the size of Harry’s dick all the time?” Ron pleaded with his girlfriend, leaning over Pansy to take her hand. “It’s enough to give a bloke a complex!”
[The bedroom now has white walls, and the floor is back to the original hardwood. Just as in the sitting room, the moulding at the ceilings has been restored, and the space is dominated by a huge wooden-framed bed piled with fluffy blankets and pillows in shades of ivory and white. There is a green velvet chaise lounge near the window with a deep maroon coloured throw on one end. On either side of the bed is a small nightstand, one piled with the books from Harry’s room and the other with Draco’s reading glasses sitting on top. There are two matching armoires along one wall, and the framed pieces of Teddy’s art that once decorated Harry’s bedroom are now hanging above them.]
,” I mimic, tsking. I flail around behind me, patting the desk until my hand makes contact with the bottle, which I shove into his hands. “What do you take me for? A virgin?”
“Teddy seems like a delightful kid,” Karamo adds. “Tomorrow, you two will meet Tanny for some shopping, and then you’ll both meet up with me and Teddy for an afternoon adventure. We’ll bring Sir Bites A Lot along with us, so it’ll be a full family outing!”
Harry immediately kissed Malfoy back, bringing his hands up to cradle Malfoy’s head in his hands. He opened his mouth and sighed into the embrace, feeling Draco’s soft arms wrap around his waist.
“Bobby, did you move all of our clothes and everything in here already?” Harry asks, looking towards the armoires.
Harry steps forward and puts his hand on Draco’s shoulder in an effort to reassure him. “Hermione told me a few weeks ago that Teddy had written a letter for us. He thinks that my clothes are in need of an overhaul, and apparently you’re too stuffy in your formal robes all the time. He thinks that maybe it can make us a bit
“I sleep in only Chanel no. 5 and a strand of pearls, so I had to slip into something to avoid scandalising Potter.”
in the manor. Do you know how disgusting it was to clean up after his fucking snake? And you should see what he did to the master bedroom. There are still stains that we’ve never been able to get fully out of the medieval tapestries. The house elves won’t even speak about the en suite bathroom. We’ve actually just closed all of those rooms permanently.”
Harry coughs behind the two of them. “Err, I don’t know if I put this all on right?”
“Err….” Harry begins, looking around the room. “This looks fantastic, but why are some of my things in here?”
___________________________
They were both breathing hard, and Harry moved his hands up to trace patterns lightly on Draco’s back with his nails.
For the first time in a week, Harry slept through the night.
Harry cut him off before he went on a long tangent, probably giving the kids way more information than would be helpful. “The point is that when two wizards want to have children, they can either find a surrogate - someone to carry their child for them - or they can adopt.”
“Can I ask about how you two came to have this arrangement? With both of you as guardians of Teddy?” Bobby questions, helping himself to another Jaffa cake.
Potter nodded. “Yes, those are all my children, actually. The tall one with red hair is James, the one with dark hair like mine is Albus, and the little girl is Lily. And that’s their Zayde, the man with the newspaper. His name is Saul.”
“Gay.” Finished Jamie.
“Huh? Yeah?”
“Well I came back, obviously, Harry! Honestly.” Draco waved his hand, gesturing for Jamie to continue.
“Boys! HOLD. THE. PHONE! I am dying! The Chosen One! We are making over The Saviour!” Tan screeches and hits the steering wheel with his hands.
“This is barbaric, Potter. I’m touching raw meat. I could get some sort of disease doing this.” Malfoy had his lip curled as he rolled a pinch of meat between his palms. “I mean, seriously. How can muggles do this three times a day, every single day? It boggles the mind, considering the things they have to do to stay alive without magic.”
“It’s barely half eight on a Saturday and you’re already in Gucci?” Draco called.
Harry sighed. “He’s probably in the backyard. Make sure you give him a treat before he goes!” He flicked his wand in the direction of the back of the house as Jamie ran to the back door and wrenched it open. Draco cocked his head, silently asking what he was casting.
“We’ve lived together for the better part of a decade, Potter.”
Harry’s wearing a dark blue suit with a white, lightly checked Oxford shirt and a tie with a subtle floral pattern. He tugs on the neck of the shirt. “I had to use a spell to tie the tie,” he admits.
“Are you convinced you’re not dreaming?”
, Harold!” Jonathan says, holding up a pair of green boxer shorts adorned with flickering golden snitches. “These are too much, and yet not nearly enough, all at the same time!”
Draco inspects his reflection. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen my hair look this good. I am truly impressed with your handiwork.”
“Thank you for having me, Mr. Harry. I had a really fun time!” Scorpius said while he tried to zip his coat himself.
“It’s purely a game of chance, Pans,” Blaise said from his perch on the couch. “There’s no way to be ‘good’ or ‘bad’ at something that requires no skill.”
“Harry, why don’t you just switch seats? This is ridiculous! That’s your fourth quill in as many days.”
James had entered the fray taking place in the kitchen, yawning and shuffling over to get his favorite cereal. “Morning Aunt Hermione, morning Pan - err, Aunt Pansy.”
“On your way, Potter. Never mind this cow.”
“Thank you, Ron - “ Draco began, ready to accept the kind words but he was cut off.
“It’s moments like these that I really regret opening up our floo” Harry sighed, patting Draco on the bum and reaching to fetch another mug from the cabinet.
Teddy was already inspecting the bins that contained his various toys and craft supplies. “Wow, Draco, Harry, look! All of my Legos are sorted by colour!”
Tan claps his hands to get Harry’s attention. “So? What do you wear under your robes?”
“This is quite a moment in Queer Eye history,” Karamo passes around a box of tissues. “Love confessions and an adoption!”
Draco’s face softens as he looks at his son. He walks over and crouches down to be at his eye level. “Oh, Teddy. You are the kindest, most thoughtful child. Harry and I are certainly not unhappy with our lives! But if it will make you feel better to see me wearing Muggle trousers, then I suppose I will have to suffer through the indignity.”
All at once Draco’s mouth opened in a silent scream and he clenched around Harry’s cock, shooting semen onto his stomach and Harry’s hand.
“She’ll probably forget in a few minutes, Dad.” Al had walked completely into the sitting room and was using his toe to move a plastic car back and forth across the carpet. “Are you mad at me?”
“It uses fresh tamarind, which is a great weapon in any chef’s arsenal, and it’s especially popular in South Indian dishes. The tamarind is both a fruit and a legume, and it’s incredibly potent. A little goes a long way!” Antoni explains, picking up the pods and showing them to the assembled group.
Harry burst out laughing. “Yeah, right, what a great moment for me!”
Draco choked on his coffee. “Excuse me?”
“Right,” Harry said before inclining his head and once again pressing his mouth to Draco’s. This time Draco immediately opened his mouth to the kiss, running his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip before nipping lightly at it.
“Have your dads ever told you that they would send you away?” Karamo asks Teddy gently.
“Malfoys do not do menial labour, Potter.”
“I’m perfectly suited to taking notes and recording, Potter. I’m only advising you on what I know to be the most effective excavation techniques. My great great great grandfather Orion Malfoy was a gentleman archaeologist, embarking on one of the first wizarding Grand Tours. It’s in my blood - “
“Je sais, mon chouchou.” Draco responded, placing a hand on his son’s small shoulder. “Mais, en anglais s’il vous plaît. Perhaps we can speak to the young man again when we’re done eating.” Scorpius’ expression brightened and he nodded at his father.
Antoni is whispering to Troglobite when Teddy suddenly bursts into tears.
“Oh, right! Of course. Hermione told me you’d moved back to England.” Potter had stepped forward and was now leaning against the wooden counter, his right foot crossed over his left and looking as casual as ever. Draco felt like his world had just been taken by the shoulders and given a rough shake.
“You,” continued Scorpius, apparently not believing his father’s answer, “used an actual computer?”
“Perhaps,” Draco said, considering. “Although poisoning is more her style.”
“Potter, I’ve never successfully cast a nonverbal hex, but so help me Salazar I will if you don’t continue eating my arse right this moment.” Harry smirked and added another finger, beginning to slowly fuck his tight entrance. Malfoy dropped his head down, groaning loudly; he reached blindly behind him and found Harry’s head, pulling it back towards him. Harry was almost painfully hard and it sent shivers down his spine to have Malfoy demanding his ministrations. Since both of his hands were occupied, he lifted his head and told Malfoy to touch himself while Harry continued to finger and lick his hole. Malfoy complied and grabbed his leaking cock with his free hand.
Silence, and then a loud sigh. “Yes. I love you.”
He steps further into the room and pushes the door shut with his foot. His Auror robes are off and in his arms, so he’s down to a pair of dark trousers and a white oxford shirt. His tie is askew, his hair is (obviously) an absolute mess, he needs a shave, and he looks absolutely

I roll my eyes. “You’ve dressed up in your Gryffindor quidditch gear for me on several occasions. How is that different?”
“That was very kind of you,” said Draco. “I think you two have earned a sleepover.”

loving you.”
[Draco interview/confessional: Well, I suppose the Niffler’s out of the pouch. I have very specific tastes when it comes to my pants. And it’s no one’s business but my own. If Harry can’t deal with it, then that’s his problem. Why?
“Look away! I’m an ugly crier!” Antoni shouts, trying to cover his face with his hands.
(And if Harry’s dreams had begun to feature blond, lithe men with ridiculously expressive eyebrows and soft grey eyes, then that was his business. And his right hand’s.)
“Have you ever told this person that you love them?” asked Harry.
“Yeah Gin, I’m sure,” Harry replied, shouting a bit to be heard over the din of the Hogwarts Express pulling out of the station. He adjusted Lily carefully from where she was tied to his chest - she had somehow managed to fall asleep in her carrier despite the noise, and her knee was digging into Harry’s rib.
“Yes, Harry?” I respond, looking around for my wand to clean ourselves up with.
“Blimey Hermione, you’re right!” Ron said loudly, startling Harry out of his reverie. Harry looked across the table to where his two best friends sat and noticed that Ron was staring at him and looked slightly ill.
PA: I think Harry cast a silencing charm?
“Circe’s perky left … Malfoy?!” Potter looked just as shocked to see Draco was to see him. And he, bastard that he was, looked incredible. His black, wavy hair had been given some sort of direction so it looked more ‘tousled’ than ‘rat’s nest’, and his tan skin seemed to glow in the afternoon light. He’d upgraded his spectacles since Hogwarts and was now sporting plastic black lenses that suited his angular jaw line, which was darkened by at least a day’s worth of stubble. The blue apron that he wore over a fitted shirt and plain denims did nothing to hide the fact that he’d filled out from a malnourished, exhausted teenager to a grown man. His shoulders were broad and he looked as if he’d even grown taller.
Draco glanced at his watch. It was Sunday afternoon, exactly fifteen hours and twenty six minutes since Harry Potter had kissed him.
Draco scoffs, but puts his arms around Harry. “I am
“No, no, not at all. Thank you for the invitation to your home, Potter,” Draco said, smiling.
[More hugs go around. The scene cuts to show Draco, Harry, and Teddy waving goodbye from their front door. The Fab Five pile into their SUV and drive off.]
“Anyway, as I was saying,” Harry continued, chuckling. “Draco and I are getting married. And I wanted to tell him, and tell all of you, how incredible I think he is and how insanely lucky I am to have him. Draco,” Harry faced his fiance, taking his hands in his own. “I remember the first time I saw you, when we were eleven years old. We were in Madame Malkin’s and I had just been told I was a wizard. I was still in shock, I think, and there you were, confident as can be, nattering on about Hogwarts houses and Slytherin and how you’d off yourself if you were sorted Hufflepuff.”
“Mm, don’t care. They could use some childhood trauma. Fodder for a Mind Healer in their twenties.” Draco replied, nosing his way down Harry’s stubble-covered neck. He rolled his hips gently against Harry’s, sighing when he felt the other man’s erection pressing against his own. “I want your cock in my mouth, Potter,” Draco muttered the words against Harry’s ear and then nipped at his earlobe gently.
“Yes, yes, love, just like that! Oh Merlin you feel amazing. And look at you, fucking yourself on me while you’re wearing that.
Harry laughed and threw his arms around Draco’s midsection, burying his face in his stomach. “You’ll not regret marrying me, love. I promise I’ll work on not being such an insufferable git.”
“Harry,” I say again, letting my voice drop a bit lower. “You can touch, you know.”
There are a few gasps heard around the room, and Molly Weasley bursts into tears.
“It did take Saul about two hours to teach you how to use the word processing program…” Harry began, smiling at Draco who scowled in return.
“All the same,” Draco replied.
Sophia leaned over and patted his hand. “Thank you, Harry, for everything you did. Look at you, not even a man and setting the world back to rights? Ess! Eat some more soup. You’re skin and bones, kemfer.”
“Make me,” Harry shoots back.
“I’ve heard of Harry Potter, I think? Didn’t he foil some terrorist plot?” Karamo says, looking pensive. “But I don’t know who Draco Malfoy is. What a
Draco snorted. “Yes, Harry, I’m OK.”
of new experiences.” Malfoy waggled his eyebrows suggestively at Harry.
“Lily is not my child,” Draco responded simply.
“Hullo. I’m Scorpius. I’m five and a half. Are you five? We look like we’re the same age. What are you drawing?”
Draco makes a strangled noise and grips the coat in his hands tightly. Tan claps his hands delightedly. “Yes, Mr Potter! Yes!”
Draco stopped clearing the table. He looked at Harry and sighed. “I’d say we’d have a shot if not for your ex-wife’s team cleaning the floor with us last week.” He sat back down, unsure if he was happy to spend more time with Harry or if he was being masochistic. Pansy would probably say the latter, and she was an infuriatingly good judge of Draco’s habits.
“Erm, Malfoy? You OK?” Harry asked, wrinkling his brow in concern. “Are you going to be sick? I can grab the bin if you need…”
“You can have sex with more than one person at the same time?” Albus sounded alarmed.
“Mmm,” Draco said noncommittally and glancing around the room for Harry. Somehow, in a house teeming with people, Draco had found himself alone with Ron. He clicked his engagement ring on the stem of his wine glass absently, hoping he would be saved by someone else joining the table.
At that moment the front door of their townhouse was banged open and the voices of their children drifted from the foyer. Draco jumped back from Harry at the sound of the commotion, and he quickly lowered himself onto the stool next to the butcher-block island, crossing his legs and taking a deep breath in an effort to will his erection away. Harry grabbed a tea towel and held it awkwardly in front his crotch while he looked around a bit wildly for the electric kettle.
Draco didn’t have a response, so he looked down at his teacup. He wasn’t sure how to talk about the war with Harry; wasn’t sure that he had the right to be lighthearted in the same way that he was with Hermione.
. I love the show, and I’ve always wanted to try a French tuck... Plus, watching Draco experience this is priceless.]
“Right. Of course. I apologise for the presumption.” Draco put a shaking hand on the back of a chair to steady himself, but he felt his knees buckle.
Albus jumped in first, though, and told his sister, “boys can’t have babies, Lily! They don’t have the right bits. Babies need to come out of the … vangina.”
Harry thought it would be a miracle - not a ‘miracle’ like the oil lasting for eight nights - but whatever category came before a God-induced miracle, if a single person showed up to the party who didn’t already know that they were engaged.

“You know what the worst part of having the Dark Lord staying at the manor was?” Malfoy asked suddenly.
Saul nodded. “I was born in Frankfurt, and was deported to a camp in Poland in 1942.”
[Back at the loft: the Fab Five are cheering and clapping, watching Harry and Draco’s embrace. “Do you think they forgot the cameras are rolling?” Karamo asks the room at large, taking a sip of his cocktail with raised eyebrows.]
“Harry, you look like a real adult. Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.”
“OK?” Harry pulled back and asked, feeling spit dripping down his chin. His arse was beautiful and tasted perfect: slightly musky and clean and it drove Harry mad.
Teddy grins happily. “I can’t wait to tell my cousins about this. None of them have a real sky on their ceiling!”
“He said that you and Zayde weren’t my real family and he called Daddy ‘The Chosen Fairy’ but Mr Bowers heard him and he got a timeout and a note pinned to the back of his shirt and then his mum had to come talk to the teachers.” Lily shrugged and took a bite of a Hobnob. “I don’t know why he called Daddy a fairy though, because he’s actually sort of tall and his ears aren’t pointed like in my book of fairies and the only time I’ve seen him fly is on a broom.”
[A decrepit house elf wearing a stained tea towel shuffles around the kitchen getting a breakfast of toast and fruit together. Draco, grasping a large mug of coffee, and Teddy dance in the kitchen to Golden Years by David Bowie. Harry enters yawning, looking sleep-mussed but smiling fondly at the scene. He picks up Teddy and spins him around.]
“You are the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen,” Harry whispers, draping himself over me. “Spread out for me, looking so pretty in your lace.”
Harry looked appropriately disgruntled, but he was too overcome with happiness at the way the evening had turned out to be truly upset. Everyone had shown up with smiles on their faces, and no one had batted an eye at Draco and Scorpius’ presence. Draco had managed to coax Lily into a pair of spangly blue tights and a bright red dress - “Superman’s dress robes, Dad!” Lily had exclaimed when she came to show him her outfit - the boys had all behaved themselves, and no heirlooms had (yet) been broken. It was a Passover miracle.
Jonathan rolls his eyes. “OK mama, I see how it is! Let me be blunt: have you told Harry that you’re in love with him?”
. I shouldn’t let that kid spend so much time at The Burrow.]
“Erm, well, I wear my Auror robes. So, not too many choices there.”
Draco and Harry look at each other for a moment, mouths open as if to respond although neither says anything.
Lily nodded and stuck her thumb in her mouth before lying her head on Harry’s shoulder. A moment later he heard thundering footsteps coming down the stairs and into the sitting room. Al stopped in the doorway looking sheepish. “Yeah Dad?”
“I shouldn’t have to, Hermione! This is… well, it’s
Harry was silent for a few minutes, thinking about this. “Did you ever see Voldemort exiting his rooms with loo paper stuck to his shoe? Come to think of it, did he wear shoes? Or pajamas? I imagine him wearing some sort of old-timey nightgown and sleeping cap. You know, like in that portrait of Archduke Flanbert the Fatigued near the Arithmancy classroom.”
“Can I sleep over at Al’s mum’s house?” Scorpius asked Draco at the same time.
“Oh, he did tell me. I just didn’t realise that you’d have stayed … but, hey! Here you are. And please, call me Ginny.” She held a freckled hand out to Draco and smiled, if a bit tightly.
“And once he got the basics down, he was a pro!” Saul said jovially, patting Draco on the arm. “We’re going to set him up with an email account next week.”
“Don’t worry, my man! We can handle these two. And we will definitely have time together later.” Karamo kneels down and holds out his fist for Teddy to bump.
Hermione shakes her head. “We’re in year three of our ten-year plan. No babies until year seven.”
He takes some deep breaths and then looks straight into my eyes. “OK, I’m good. Ride me, Draco.”
Harry must have liked what he saw, because he suddenly walked forward and onto the bed, settling himself behind Draco and grabbing one fleshy arse cheek in each hand. Harry spread Draco open and bent his head to lick at his furled pink hole. Draco moaned and bucked backwards, shoving his arse further onto Harry’s face.
“I died for you lot, and this is what I get?” Harry roared back.
! Salazar, Potter.” Malfoy groaned and got to his feet, shuffling over to the sink where Harry stood filling a large pot with water. Harry suppressed a grin at his victory.
? And what if she’s not? I didn’t know that wrackspurts and butterflies’ hovering habits were pregnancy tests.” Draco set his mug down on the kitchen island and fiddled with his engagement ring. “And I thought that tonight was going to be about our announcement,” he said quietly.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. “Oh please. I bet you’re a right kinky sod in the sack. The Saviour of the Wizarding World: sexual deviant.
Tan smiles and winks. “My work will never be used for evil! Although if I’d known it was to sabotage that vindictive harpy I’d have willingly helped. I’m a muggle-born, you know, so…” Tan shrugs. “On to happier things! We are so, so excited to work with you!”
I roll my eyes at him. “No, you berk.”
The sounds of kissing once again take over the audio, before Harry’s voice is heard and abruptly all sound is cut off and replaced with an odd, faint humming sound.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “We’re meant to be teaching Teddy proper manners, you ridiculous oaf.” He sits down gingerly.
“But, it seems like you make Harry happy,” he continued. “I mean, I know you make Harry happy. I haven’t ever seen him like this… he just seems so light and free with you. Merlin knows why, but there it is. And so, yeah, I’m glad for you two. You both deserve happiness. Congratulations, I suppose.” Ron picked up another latke and shrugged, apparently finished with his little speech.
“Before I school you in everything about the Divine Mrs Warbeck, I just want to leave you with this question: if Teddy came to you, extolling the virtues of someone he’d fallen madly in love with, but was afraid to confess his feelings, what advice would you give him? I find it very hard to believe that you’d tell your son to lock his love away.”
Harry choked on his wine.
“Ok, so you’re not going to have babies even though you’re getting married? But you will be having sex.” Albus summed up the situation with a scrunched, pinched look on his face and Scorpius’ already pallid complexion paled a bit more.
“My point, bubbelahs,” interrupted Saul, “is that you can use your words to stand up for yourself and for those you love. Silence has taken the lives of too many.”
[Harry interview/confessional: I mean, who would want a group of strangers and a camera crew going through their underwear drawer? But, hey, I’m game.
“No! No, I’m just s - s - so ha-appy!” Teddy wails, clutching at Harry’s shirt and burying his head into his neck. “Of course, I want you to adopt me!”
“What do you think of Harry’s new ‘do, Draco?” Antoni asks, looking at him from out of the corner of his eyes.
“Then we have bathtime and someone reads me some stories even though I’m really good at reading by myself! But my dads do the reading at nighttime because they do good voices with the characters. And then I go to sleep.”
“Thanks, yeah. Teddy’s a great kid. He’ll be home next week, although I’m sure you already know about that.” Harry looked up at Draco suddenly, as if just realising something. “Actually, you and Scorpius should come over for seder next week! Passover falls right over Easter this year, so we’re hosting a big family seder. We’d love you to come.”
Draco felt sweat beading at his neck. The tingling sensation had now moved from his fingertips to the bridge of his nose; he knew, rationally, that an anxiety attack was building and that he wasn’t getting enough oxygen. The rational part of his brain and the reactive part of his brain were not working in tandem, however, and he found himself unable to take a deep breath.
“God you’re gorgeous when you come,” he says, breathing heavily.
“Don’t worry, Teddy, I’m sure you’ll get used to it. My husband and I are very affectionate at home, and my boys don’t mind. It’s good to have parents who show their love for each other and not just for you.”
“Yes!” yelled Draco. “You’re off your fucking rocker, Potter.”
“When we get to Zayde Saul’s house we have to work on unpacking, OK Jamie? We talked about this already. But maybe we can watch a movie tonight, after dinner.”
Harry glances at Draco with a soft smile. “I quite like your new look, actually. You can still be all overly dramatic and swish your hair about, but you can see more of your face now.”
[Scene cuts to the newly renovated living room, which has been decorated with an under-the sea theme, complete with undulating papier mâché giant squid, balloons, and fairy lights. A small crowd has been assembled: Hermione, Ron, other assorted Weasleys and their children are scattered about. Narcissa Malfoy stands speaking quietly in one corner with Luna Lovegood.]
“I’m going to taste your arse, Malfoy. I’ve been left staring at it for long enough.” Harry pressed his body flush against Malfoy’s and leaned in to whisper into his ear, “If I do anything that makes you uncomfortable, just say so and I’ll back off immediately, yeah?” Malfoy nodded and shivered. Harry pulled Malfoy’s shirt off, trailing a finger down his spine while he peppered kisses on the back of his neck. He then knelt, taking Draco’s joggers and pants down with him.
The Eighth Years and their two graduate student supervisors, Matt and Sarah, were currently lounging around a campfire. Matt was regaling the group with the story of his first excavation - “and then I completely forgot to map in the findspot of the arrowhead before removing it from the soil, and believe you me Dr Song did not let me forget about that one…” - and Harry was feeling warm and content, sitting between Hermione and Malfoy.
“Forgive you?” Draco had his head tilted to side, regarding Harry with narrowed eyes. “You’re sorry for kissing me?” He straightened up and crossed his arms.
“Just a tick! I know I haven’t been in ages but I didn’t think it would be so hard to find this...Ha! Got it.”
“No, no. I missed all the action.”
write me hate mail would say if they knew the sorts of things their Saviour says in the throes of passion.
“Oh, hello Potter!” Pansy had whipped her head around when Harry stepped fully into the room. Hermione yelped as Ron tried to detach himself from the two women but got his hand stuck in Hermione’s hair. Pansy smiled calmly at Harry, leaving her hand where it was.
All three kids were quiet, digesting the information their parents had given them.
Draco inclined his head towards Harry in recognition of what the other man had said, and took a drink of wine. Harry stared at the long line of his throat, wondering what it might taste like were he to lick it.
“You are so fucking perfect for me, love. Every time I think you can’t possibly know me any better than you do, you come up with some new way of surprising me. You know me better than I know myself.”
Draco nodded. “Teddy has always been a kind child, though. Aunt Andromeda has done a wonderful job bringing him up. And you as well, of course.” Draco’s mother had reached out to her estranged sister immediately following the war. Although it had taken a few years, the sisters were now thick as thieves. Scorpius loved spending time with his cousin, and Draco was quite taken with the young man as well.
“Draco! Wait! I... I won’t try to kiss you again!” Harry came to a halt and watched as Draco knotted his scarf tightly around his neck.
“You mean your Gryffindor den,” Draco says from where he’s leaning against the wall.
But no, here was Potter, closing the space between them with his arms outstretched. They were almost the same height now, and he wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and squeezed weakly. Potter smelled like cooking oil. It was quite pleasant. Draco belatedly realised that he should return the gesture, but Potter was already pulling away when he’d begun to raise his own arms.
“Can I stay here tonight if they’re all having a sleepover?” Jamie asked Harry.
Draco smoothed a nonexistent wrinkle from his pale pink cashmere sweater, took a fortifying breath, and rang the doorbell to the Potter’s home in Shoreditch. Scorpius was practically vibrating with excitement. Draco was vibrating with nerves. Where his son had talked non-stop about his upcoming playdate for the past week, Draco had thought non-stop about seeing Potter again.
a morning person.)
“Potter! You absolute brute! Put me down this instant!” Draco screeched, banging his fists against Harry’s back.
Draco rolls his eyes, but smiles.
“Dad, can we watch a show when we get to Zayde Saul’s house?” Jamie asked, craning his neck to look up at his dad. His red hair and lightly tanned skin seemed to glow as they walked through a patch of sunlight streaming into the train station. “And I want corned beef for lunch, but no mustard it’s too spicy and I hate it!”
[Moments later the camera shows Harry being escorted back to the chair, his hair now wet and a towel draped over his shoulders.]
“I tend to call him Potter when he’s being especially obtuse.” Draco rejoins.
About twenty minutes later, Harry and Malfoy were stood side by side, forming meatballs with their bare hands.
, thank you very much.”
Draco’s confused musings were interrupted when Harry continued: “Draco. I’m arse over tits for you. I have been for at least half a decade, even if we didn’t start shagging until you started coming into the deli. I want you to be mine forever, and I want to announce it in front of all four of our children and the rest of our family and friends.”
“Close the door, Harry,” I say to him, trying to keep my voice low.
“Al said that when Scorpius comes to play I’m not allowed to play with them because I’m too little and I always get hurt! But it’s not true! I don’t always get hurt, he just always pushes me!” She scrunched up her nose and tried to wipe the lone tear that had fallen.
Draco opens the door, looking at the ground. He raises his arms. “Well?”
Teddy giggles, and Karamo pulls out a large bundle of colorful fabric from behind the picnic basket. “OK, enough serious talk! Who wants to fly a kite?”
Hermione takes a deep breath and swats some errant curls from her forehead. “Jonathan, you have to reassure Harry that he’s doing the right thing in letting you all perform your magic. He’s under the impression that it’s simply a makeover for him and is not surprised, as everyone in his life makes disparaging remarks about his clothing. He’s doing this for Teddy, so simply remind him about Teddy’s letter and how much Teddy wants to see his dads happy. Bobby, you need to make sure Jonathan doesn’t go overboard with the compliments for Harry. Or for Draco, for that matter. These two have their heads so far up their own arses regarding their mutual affection that it’ll be a miracle if you five can get them to acknowledge their feelings for each other. Merlin knows we’ve been trying for the better part of a decade. But they’re skittish, so you have to tread carefully. Both are incredibly jealous, so if Harry thinks Jonathan is flirting with Draco he’ll either go off in a strop or, worse, he’ll pretend to be supportive of your flirtation in a continuation of his self-sacrificing bullshit. And vice-versa.”
[The scene cuts to Harry walking into a chic-looking salon in central London and greets Jonathan, who’s waving wildly at him.]
The timer Harry had set on the oven started to beep. “Go tell your siblings that dinner’s ready, please.” Al ran up the stairs shouting for Jamie and Lily, and Harry carefully slid the pan of lasagna out of the oven. He caught his reflection in the kitchen window and grimaced. He had bags under his eyes and a thick layer of stubble. He was certain he’d seen a gray hair on his head that morning. He was the complete opposite of Malfoy, with his perfectly pressed muggle trousers and stylish haircut. Harry would wager a thousand galleons that Malfoy’s hair would probably never turn gray; it would just gracefully shift from his trademark blond to a very elegant white. He’d look classic instead of haggard, as he was sure his own hair would look in another thirty years.
“I...I just….on the show, people who are really nice and do lots of good stuff get nominated by people who love them and then they get new clothes and new hair and Bobby makes them a whole new house and at the end of the show the people are always so happy! And you two are really nice and do lots of good stuff and I want you to be happy like that.” Teddy looks nervous, and his hair shimmers between dark brown and turquoise.
. How do you fit your…” He looks up suddenly. “I mean! It’s your life! You can put your - err, wear whatever you want!”
“Yes, but it’s important to make sure that you’re ready to have such an intimate connection with the other person. Or people.” Draco responded.
“Did you tell your sister that she’s not allowed to play with you and Scorpius when he comes to play next week?” Harry asked.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” Harry yelped as he was pushed up against the door to his and Ron’s room. Despite having filled out a bit over the summer, Malfoy was still slightly taller than Harry, and he used his advantage to bracket the other boy’s head with his palms pressed up against the door.
“I certainly know what profession I won’t be going into.” Malfoy looked thoughtful. “What are your plans for the future? Auror Academy, marriage to the Weaslette, three red-headed children named after dead people?”
“I think it’s time to explore your queendom now, your majesty!” Jonathan says quickly, pulling Draco out of the bathroom with him.
Harry groaned and threw his arm over his eyes. He had sounded like an absolute tosser this afternoon, and he couldn’t stop replaying the scene over and over in his head. Of course the first time he’d seen Malfoy in over a decade and he’d forgotten to actually make his order, his three year old daughter had sworn several times, and Dudley’s ribbing had gotten increasingly more suggestive as the afternoon wore on.
“I’ve never worked in a kitchen with a house-elf,” Antoni says, looking uncomfortable. “I feel like I’m invading his space.”
“OK everyone, let’s take a look at how our beloved family is faring as they get ready to host Teddy’s birthday party!” Bobby says, settling into the sofa with a large bowl of popcorn. “Antoni, what’s the hold up with our cocktails?”
forget anything. I remember every insult he threw at me from our Hogwarts days, and can recite with “horrifying accuracy” every single time that he’s forgotten to banish the trash or water the flowers or has made up some inane excuse to get out of tea with my mother.
, Draco.”
“Oh, whatever. This is going to be broadcast across the wizarding world, and I look like … well, I look like I’m wearing your clothes.”
“Yes, well done you,” I reply as he gently maneuvers me so I’m yet again leaning onto his desk on my forearms, arse in the air.
Sophia made a sound of disbelief. “Being a prisoner in a camp doesn’t count against you, love.”
“I’m, fuck, I’m really close, Draco,” Harry warned, fisting Draco’s hair tighter. He felt Harry grow harder moments before he began to come in warm spurts in Draco’s mouth. “Ah, shit!” Harry yelled. Draco spluttered a bit, causing semen to hit him in the chin and cheek.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand and grimaced. “Erm, well, Ginny’s actually dating Luna Lovegood now - we decided we’re much better off as friends. Without the threat of imminent death hanging over our heads, we realised that we’re not all that well suited to be in a romantic relationship. Plus, did you notice she looks quite a bit like my mum? When Hermione pointed it out I couldn’t get it out of my head. I’m surprised you didn’t know about Gin and Luna, though, given your love of salacious gossip.”
“Good morning James,” the two women said in unison.
That night, the Eighth Years were yet again gathered around the fire. Padma had suggested that they play a drinking game, and an hour later they were all properly sloshed and armed with much more information about each other from playing several rounds of “never have I ever,” a muggle game that Blaise had learned from his American cousins.
“Try me, Malfoy!”
“Oi! Hush, you!” Sophia said indignantly, before turning to Harry. She took one of his hands into both of hers - she had cool, wrinkled hands - and looked into his eyes. “Harry,” she began, “come back, have soup. Sit for a while. Don’t forget to be kind to yourself.” Harry nodded and thanked them again for their hospitality. Sophia pressed another container of soup and a ten pound note into his hand - “for the taxi!” - and she and Saul walked Harry towards the exit. To the right of the door, just above Harry’s eye level, a crinkled, yellowing piece of paper was framed. “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. - Viktor Frankl.”
Draco hooked his thumbs in Harry’s pants and pulled them down, freeing Harry’s dick from the confines of his briefs. Draco groaned as he looked down at Harry’s cock, which was laying hard against his hip. “Are you fucking kidding me? Of
“I…I don’t hate you, Malfoy.” Harry’s breath was coming quickly and he could feel all his blood rushing straight to his cock. “I, erm, I… I don’t want to, you know, stare at you…all the time… I just…” Harry’s train of thought slid off the rails as Malfoy leered at him and ground his hips against his captive’s.
Harry laughs. “OK, OK. You’re right.”
“As I was saying,” Saul went on, “the past is the past, eh? And from what Hermione’s said, you’re quite the Potions savant! It’s wonderful to finally meet you after all the these years.” Saul sat back down but he held Draco’s gaze, his eyes twinkling. “And the menu is mostly Harry! All compliments should go to him. Since Sophia’s been gone - my wife, fershtay - Harry’s taken over. And his innovations in the kitchen are a delight!”
And so, six months after Sophia died, Harry, James, Albus, and Lily Potter walked into the townhouse next to Weinberg’s deli and began a new chapter of their life.
[Karamo interview/confession: kids just say the
Draco cupped his balls and pulled them up as he bounced so he could watch Harry’s cock slide in and out of him. Slapping away his hand, Harry spit into his palm and wrapped it around Draco’s rigid dick and began pumping, his other hand coming up to gently caress his throat. Draco lifted his left hand to cover the one Harry held over his neck and a bit of sunlight caught the gold band on his ring finger, causing golden rays to shoot out across the room.
Lily beamed. Harry reached out to rub Draco’s shoulder, but he shrugged away from him. “We’ll speak later,” he hissed.
“Yeah, mate. Don’t rush to grow up, ok?” Harry adds, smiling at his son.
Just then Lily ran into the kitchen.
Little by little, Harry began to tell his own stories. He told Saul about his parents, and about Dumbledore while he helped Sophia to peel potatoes for latkes. He talked about living in the forest, about hunting horcruxes, and he talked about watching Sirius die. The grief, dejection, and anger that felt all-consuming gently abated over time.
Harry beat him to it, casting a gentle cleaning spell over both of them. “No, Draco, I’m not just saying that because you let me fuck your mouth. I mean, that was bloody amazing, but you are. You’re beautiful. And sexy. And so insanely smart. And funny, which is honestly quite the surprise.”
Draco screeches and lunges across the bed. “Unhand my pants, Potter!”
“But you don’t tell each other ‘I love you,’” Teddy points out. “Don’t you two love each other? Aren’t we a family that loves each other?” Teddy’s little eyebrows rise on his forehead, demanding an answer.
“Bobby and I met at Ilvermorny,” Karamo explains. “Thunderbird pride!” He and Bobby high five. “My sons are both there now. Do you two have kids?”
“We’re not.” Antoni replies. “I’m a no-maj, but my ex was a wizard. He got permission to tell me after we’d been together for five years. We broke up eventually, but by then I’d already been grouped with these madmen.”
“Potter, if you come out of that bathroom wearing the Rolling Stones shirt with the rip in it that you were cooking in, I swear to Merlin I will set it on fire.” Draco stands in front of a large mirror, considering his reflection. He’s in fitted tan trousers and a soft black turtleneck with the sleeves pushed up to his forearms.
“I promise you, it’s not,” Pansy said, eyes flashing as she prepared to spin. “Some of us are just naturally talented.”
I sigh, letting my head drop between my arms. “What do you want, Harry? Do you want to fuck me? Do you want me to suck your cock until you come all over this pretty lace?”
Draco gawped at Harry. “So, what do you suggest, then? We just agree to disagree that I was a prat, and now we’re friends?”
Before he and Ginny had split up, Harry had only let himself think about Malfoy in very vague terms. He knew that he was bisexual - and so did his family and friends; his and Ginny’s sex life had taken a turn for the best when he’d admitted that he’d love a nice cock in his arse - but he thought he was content with his love life. It was only very late at night, after he’d read some tragic love story or watched some idiotic romantic comedy that he’d let himself wonder what his life would be like if Snape had never heard the first half of that prophecy. The hatred he’d felt as a child for Draco Malfoy had morphed into obsession and something less easily defined around sixth year. Harry had been so sure of his own role in the war, and so sure of the black and white nature of good and evil. He never let himself question why he would have to school his thoughts away from images of white blond hair and long, pale fingers when he’d have a wank. Fifteen years later he had a pretty good idea why.
Malfoy looked thoroughly confused. “What problem do you have that you need my help with?”
It had been two and a half years, and he felt that he’d been entirely patient enough. He was hoping that Saturday night would not only be a celebration of Hannukah, but also of their engagement.
Not long after finishing the meatballs, Harry lifted a wooden spoon full of hot marinara sauce to Malfoy’s lips in invitation for him to try it. Malfoy lifted an eyebrow but opened his mouth and took some of the sauce. He closed his eyes and made a sound of pleasure, causing Harry’s cheeks to pink at the erotic noise that filled the small kitchen.
______________________________
Harry shoots a nervous glance at Draco and then hurries into the small bathroom that he and Teddy share. Jonathan is inspecting the labels of the few bottles and tubes in the cabinet.
“And you’re one sugar with too much milk,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose.
“Potter,” he greeted, grasping the other man’s hand and nodding, hoping his voice remained steady. Potter’s hand was warm and slightly damp, but his grap was firm. “It’s been... years.”
“You remember every time I’ve told you I love you?” Harry asks softly.
“Draco?” Harry asks quietly.
They lapsed into silence. Harry wasn’t sure how to respond to Malfoy’s last statement - he had no idea what it was like to live the weight of such heavy family obligations. But if the war had taught him anything, it was that life was precious and altogether too short, and people should take every chance at happiness that was presented to them. When he told Malfoy as much, Malfoy snorted and told him he sounded like one of those wizarding self-help books that take up an entire section at Flourish and Blotts. Harry had responded by flicking muddy water at Malfoy’s still pristine button-down shirt, and a small water fight ensued. When Dr Song came upon the two of them covered in brown water but laughing, she took their bucket of cleaned pottery with a wink and an approving smile.
“No one is pointing a wand to your head, Harry. I certainly don’t want to cohabitate with someone who is unwilling.”
“I love you too, Harry,” Draco whispers. “I’ve loved you for so long I don’t know how to exist
There was a knock at the door of his lab, and Draco grumbled in annoyance. He didn’t want to deal with what was certain to be Granger, probably demanding to know why Harry Potter had checked himself into St Mungo’s after spending an evening in his company.
Harry’s mouth opened and closed several times. He folded his arms across his chest again, and glowered at Malfoy, muttering something about “completely missing the point.”
“Thanks Uncle Harry!” Hugo called before launching himself off of Hermione’s lap and running out of the dining room.
“You think you know me so well?”
“It’s not … it’s not just that, Harry.” Ginny wiped the back of her hand roughly across her cheeks to clear the tears that had gathered there. “I want this,” she held out the paper to him, gazing into his eyes with the blazing look he knew so well. He’d gone on to read the love letter written to Saul from Sophia: two pages of declarations and promises written with such passion and emotion that Harry was both pink-cheeked and weeping by the time he reached the end. He met his wife’s eyes and realised that he, too, wanted this. He wanted the type of love that elicited letters like this one. They’d sat on the sofa and held each other while they cried, mourning the life they’d built together but each knowing that they craved something more.
He ordered for Scorpius and then himself, hastily choosing the day’s special without much thought. “I’ll have The Sophia, please.” “The Sophia,” the specials sign read, “classic egg salad on grilled rye, served with a bowl of matzo ball soup and a warm hug!” He’d never had matzo ball soup before, but the sandwich was served with it and he’d not tasted anything he’d not liked at Weinberg’s before.
“So, Harry. What do you wear on a usual work day?” Tan asks, ruffling through a drawer of mostly white undershirts.
Al nodded. “OK, dad. I won’t exclude her, I know it’s not allowed.”
Draco rose to his feet. “Hello, Ms Weasley. My son Scorpius is here playing with your children. I would’ve thought Harry’d told you?” He glanced at Harry who was grabbing several toys off of the floor and throwing them into a bag.
“Yes, I did papa. I think Al is my best friend. I’ve never had a best friend, so I’m not sure but I think this is it!” Draco smiled down at his son, glad that at least one Malfoy and one Potter were on even footing.
“Well, I’ve been thinking about what it would be like to kiss you for at least the past two days, if not the past two years,”
Another hour later, a chime sounded from the living room and Ginny Weasley stepped out of the Floo.
“You and Astoria weren’t...err…” Harry trailed off, looking unsure how to continue his question.
But that also means that I remember all of the experiences and gestures and gifts that we’ve shared. The first time that Harry smiled at me, our first kiss; how many different pet-names he’s bestowed upon me.
A chorus of high-pitched giggling broke out behind him. Draco turned to see Scorpius and the Potter children watching them and laughing. The old man had put down his newspaper and was watching the scene from behind a pair of half-moon glasses. He looked highly amused, but was apparently able to keep his mirth contained.
Harry put up his hands, not wanting Malfoy to continue in his description. “I honestly don’t want to know.”
!” Harry craned his neck to glare at the man standing over him. He was crouched in their trench, trying to even out the balk with his trowel, and for the past ten minutes Malfoy had stood at the edge of the scarp and criticised every single stroke Harry had made.
“I suppose,” he replies.
“Oh, because the holey boxers from sixth year that you still wear are so scandalous.”
“Giraffes you saw at the zoo, Albus.” The old man spoke without looking up from his newspaper.
Malfoy let out a melodramatic groan, but acquiesced to Harry’s command. They continued to cook in silence, save for Harry’s occasional direction.
“Can we do presents now?” Teddy asks, his face smeared with the remnants of his cake.
“Draco!” Harry scolded from where he was cutting a cucumber into bite-sized discs. “Language! And don’t talk about Ms Goldblum wanting my ar - err, - my backside.”
. Harry has never touched himself like this in front of me. I mean to say that yes, he’ll stroke himself off while I’m fucking him, but he’s never just whipped it out and starting wanking. I go from half-hard to fully erect so quickly that I’m surprised I don’t faint from the blood rushing south.
[Jonathan confessional/interview: OK, so, Draco and Harry’s love is like a sweet angel baby chipmunk. We need to take it into our hands and pet it and snuggle it and whisper to it that it's beautiful and wonderful and nurture it and try not to scare it away. And sometimes, we need to put that chipmunk up to a mirror to examine its life decisions because BONJOUR MON AMOUR those two are heating up this tiny bathroom!]
“I’m incredibly sorry, Granger. I… I didn’t mean to do that.”
“So, I want to talk about communication today, team,” Karamo says, raising his eyebrows meaningfully at the two men. “Clear, open communication is incredibly important to every relationship, particularly when it comes to families. I want to ask Teddy to communicate with us why he feels like he’s in charge of making his dads happy.”
“Yeah, yeah, can it, kid! This is my day!” Jamie shouted back, laughing. “As I was saying, DD and I didn’t start off the best of friends. But he was always, always there for me when I needed him. I’m going to tell you all a story that I haven’t told anyone, not even Teddy.” Draco raised his eyebrows, looking nervous.
“Yes, Merlin, please! Touch me. I’m close, please…” I know I’m whimpering but I can’t help it. My orgasm is building and I just need a little friction to push me over the edge.
“You’re utterly hopeless, Potter. But it works for you, in a sort of, ‘devil may care’ kind of way. It’s actually somewhat adorable.” Malfoy looked slightly surprised at himself and muttered something about needing to perform a sobering charm.
“First of all, no, it is not possible to transfigure reproductive organs to carry a pregnancy to full term,” Draco began. “Although, researchers in America have made some interesting discoveries regarding the possibility of magically-induced gender reassignment surgery-”
“I really don’t know. My family was in talks with the Greengrasses before the war, but now… it remains to be seen. I have half a mind to fuck off to the Continent and take a lover in every major capital just to prove to my father that I won’t be conforming to his every whim anymore. But, I’m the last Malfoy and it would break my mother’s heart if I failed to provide her with a grandchild.”
“You’re gorgeous,” Harry said, sliding to the floor next to Draco.
Five minutes and many promises of thorough cleanings of said beds later, Jamie waved his hand dismissively and muttered, “nothing new to report. Dad it’s your turn.”
Harry smiled at his friends, enjoying how easily they included Draco into their conversation. He sighed and relaxed into his chair, pressing his thigh more closely to Draco’s. The table was crowded enough to pass the gesture off as accidental, but Harry’s stomach fluttered when he felt Draco return the pressure.
“My cousin Shlomo never lost a game of dreidel!” Saul claimed. “I’d never seen anything like it until you, Ms Parkinson. You’ve a gift for the game.”
“It can be, but the beauty of Indian cooking is that you can usually adjust the spice level to suit the tastes of the eaters.” Antoni answers. He takes several tomatoes and onions and places them on the kitchen table, next to a chopping block. “Karamo, will you help Teddy cut these while I show Harry and Draco how to make their own sambar powder?”
Draco looked offended. “Moi? A gossip? Bite your tongue, Potter. Although I can’t wait to see what Pansy gets up to with two thirds of the Golden Trio.”
“Ok, ok. I see Harry Potter, but a Harry Potter who looks quite, err, professional.” He pulls at his cuff.  “Perhaps a Harry Potter who could be up for Lead Instructor.”
I clutch harder at his broad shoulders and let out a loud moan when he grabs me and starts thrusting up to meet my downstrokes, gritting his teeth.
Harry sighed. “Look, Draco. I want to explain about last night.”
“Thank you for the soup. It’s delicious.” Harry wasn’t sure if it was due to the fact that he’d not had a full night’s sleep in over a week or if Sophia really was peppering her sentences with non-English words.
Draco scoffs and Harry throws his back and laughs.
“English, Scorpius. And yes, they will be upset. How about we make a plan for a sleepover another night?” Draco responded.
“Oi!” Harry says, turning. “Just wait until they enter your Slytherin lair, you hypocrite!”
To stave off his impending organsm, he concentrated on watching the expressions that crossed Draco’s face, wanting to catalogue every groan and brow furrow. Harry pulled Draco up and into his lap so that they were both sitting straight up, Draco’s legs wrapped around the outsides of Harry’s thighs.
“I may not have been faced with the same types of choices you were, and yes, OK, yes!” Harry threw up his arms. “You made some truly horrible decisions. But I was still a stubborn arsehole when I was fifteen.”
“Yes yes yes!” Teddy screeches.
“I swear to Godric if you bring up your colonialist grandfather’s half-arsed attempts at archaeology
[Dash-cam shows Tan driving on the right with Jonathan riding shotgun, and Karamo, Bobby, and Antoni squeezed into the back seat.]
Pansy narrowed her eyes and said, “Never have I ever had impure thoughts about Harry James Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World. Golden Boy. The Chosen One.”
“Well, I was watching your show with my Aunt Hermione, the girl right over there.” Teddy points to where Hermione is now sitting in one of the old leather chairs near the fireplace. “And you are all really good at making peoples’ dads and moms and even grandmas seem so much happier than they used to be. And sometimes I think my dads work too hard. Also, they need to wear different clothes because they are handsome but they hide it. Both of them.”
Harry had turned to Hermione, hoping that she might commiserate with his experience with Malfoy. “Don’t look at me, Harry. Pansy doesn’t mind doing all the excavating; in fact she’s quite adept with a trowel. And she always compliments my recording techniques. Have you ever noticed how nice her hands are?” Harry didn’t have an answer to that, so he looked around at the rest of the table. All of his classmates appeared to be enjoying themselves on this project. He and Malfoy were apparently the only ones who couldn’t find a rhythm.
“Do you want to be their other father, Draco? I mean, Lily and Al already call you their Draco Dad and Jamie is just being a pretween twit and calls me ‘Harry’ half the time simply to be contrary.”
“Let’s do this thing!” Jonathan yells after a moment, jumping into the air. “We have our orders, boys! Ooooh, I never thought I’d be in the army but she can work some camo! Trust!” He begins stomping down the street in an imitation march.
Malfoy made an inelegant noise to express his disbelief. “You’re the bloody Chosen One. People will be falling all over themselves to give you a job in any field you set your sights on. I bet you could even become Minister for Magic next year without mounting a campaign if you so desired. I, on the other hand, am a former Death Eater from a disgraced family. Do you know how many Potions Mastery programs I’ve applied to? Six. And six rejections, Potter. I’m destined to marry whatever Pureblood witch my parents are able to negotiate for me, produce an heir - which includes heterosexual copulation, perish the thought - and then quietly recede into the pages of the next edition of
He shrugs.
pouting,” He grumbles, his face tucked into Harry’s neck.
If Harry wanted to provoke Draco’s derision, he might be tempted to say something along the lines of, “this project may not have yielded much in terms of exciting archaeological finds, but I’m certainly glad that I found my way to you.”
“Potter, are you serious right now? We’re supposed to be closing the trench, not opening a new deposit!” Malfoy was stood at the edge of the scarp, shouting down at Harry. It was the last day of excavation, and Harry couldn’t be happier that they were returning to Hogwarts that evening. He was completely done with Draco’s back-seat excavating.
“Harry you are daft as a bush. They obviously mean for us to share.” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “And I have to say, Bobby, your taste is fantastic. The aesthetic echoes the Malfoy pied a terre in Paris.”
“Rose always finds it and it’s no fun to watch her win everything,” Hugo whinged to his mother.
Harry threw his hands up in exasperation. “I don’t care where you do your ‘prescribed therapy,’ Malfoy, just do it somewhere that I don’t have to see your scrawny arse on display!”
He unzipped the bag and dug his hand around inside of it until he produced a small box that he clutched in his palm. “Draco,” Harry said, opening the box to reveal a gold band nestled in black velvet, “will you marry me?”
“Because your father has the social skills of a feral cat and I needed to stop him before he embarrassed himself,” Hermione explained to her son.
“I had some help from Mrs Narcissa Malfoy née Black herself,” he responds.
[Scene cuts to the group back in the living room.]
“You sound like my grandmother!” Jonathan laughs. “But I taught her how to use her iPhone last year, and honey, she is on all the dating apps. That woman has a boyfriend for every day of the week.”
Draco turned his attention back to Harry’s dick and began to suck at the head, pushing his foreskin up and down with his lips and tongue. He took as much of Harry into his mouth as he could, and Harry felt Draco’s throat relax and he attempted to take more and more. He’d gotten a few blowjobs in his life, but when Draco looked up at Harry, his lips stretched around Harry’s cock, cheeks flushed with exertion, Harry thought desperately that this was the most erotic, most pleasurable thing he’d ever experienced in his life.
“Hello, you gorgeous angel!” Jonathan leaps at Hermione and wraps her up in a hug. “You are radiant! A goddess!” Jonathan twirls her around. “And hello to you too, handsome!” Jonathan moves to hug Ron, who looks a bit shocked but pats his back awkwardly.
Draco nodded.
“Hey! You did the same thing to me!”
He looks slightly sheepish, so I cup his jaw in my hands. “Harry Potter. There is very little you could say right now that I wouldn’t do for you.”
Harry looks around, scratching at the back of his neck. “Err, yes? I don’t think I’ve actually been shopping for myself since I last grew, so maybe seven or eight years ago?”
And then, of course, I want to recall him from said mythical Harry Potter-filled island so that he can wrap his surprisingly muscular thighs around my waist and mutter filthy encouragement in my ear as I fuck him into the mattress. I
“I generally have you bent over a lab table taking my cock,” Draco answered honestly.
“He’s mostly blind,” Harry explains, “so he runs into things a lot. And it’s also how he got his name, Troglobite.”
“But, I went after him. Because it’s completely uncouth to profess love and then retreat like that” Draco continues. “And we talked. And I told Harry that I love him, too. We love each other in a
Draco climbed onto the bed and over Harry’s legs so that he straddled him. Draco leaned over Harry and licked a strip from his nipple up to his neck, and began kissing him again. Harry was more than happy to let Draco take the lead, as it was clear that he had specific plans in mind. Harry brought his hands up to caress Draco’s arse, kneading the soft flesh as they continued to rock against each other.
“Oh, no. I make them for myself, and Harry kept pilfering them from my bathroom so I started creating some especially for him.”
Draco and Harry smiled dopily at each other. “I’m sorry we didn’t tell you, Hermione,” Draco explained, “but we didn’t even tell the kids until last night. We just needed a few days to let it all settle.”
“It’s one thing to get drunk and fuck while you still happen to be wearing a dress, and quite another to ask you to wear very specific things so that I can get off.”
“It was the best birthday in my whole entire life.” He yawns again. “I love you, dads.”
“Well, yes, all that,” Malfoy waved a had, flinging muddy water pellets at Harry. “But there was also the completely surreal experience of having the Dark Lord actually
“O-o-k,” I replied, stretching out the word to imply that I didn’t believe him. I decided not to push it, though, as I was still hungover and was honestly more interested in Harry making me a full English than trying to unravel whatever neurosis he had around lingerie. “How about you make yourself useful then, and hurry down to the kitchen to make your horribly hungover husband some brekkie, hm?”
“Thank you.” Harry took a biscuit and examined it without taking a bite. “And, err, yes. I’m a wizard. I’m, well, that wizard. Are you?”
“Yes, I do. Where’s Skops?” Jamie asked, narrowing his eyes and looking very much like Ginevra Weasley.
“You’re really pretty, you know?” Hermione said to Pansy, whom she was leaning awkwardly against.
“Yes I did. And it took me bloody forever so you’d best appreciate the effort.”
“Tomorrow is Sunday, Draco.”
“I want to say a few words. And then I’ll let Saul have the floor to light the menorah. But first,” Harry pulled Draco to his side and wrapped his arm possessively around his hips. “Despite the fact that we wanted to make a grand announcement, I know you’re all aware that Draco and I are getting married.”
“Don’t say that, Teddy!” Draco calls over his shoulder. “I don't want you to leave for Hogwarts a day earlier than you absolutely have to. I can hardly believe you’re going to be eight years old.”
Draco looks down for a few moments, then up again to meet Jonathan’s gaze. “I apologize for my reaction. I don’t … respond well to being challenged.” He looks at the camera again, nervous. “I suppose that I’m hesitant to further embarrass myself. Karamo has already coerced more emotional statements from me in the past 24 hours than I’ve admitted to in the past 24 years.”
“Shh!” Harry admonishes playfully. “Let Teddy explain.”
Draco groans. “Tell me Celestina Warbeck isn’t popular in The States?”
“Poor Trogs,” Harry says, leaning down to scratch behind his ears.
Harry took a big gulp of his drink and heard Draco splutter, seeming to have choked on his wine. Harry glared at Ron and gave him the finger while weathering the catcalls and whistles of his cohort. He supposed he deserved that after his previous turn had called out Ron and Hermione for having sex in the bathroom of the Burrow last Christmas.
Draco nodded and responded, explaining his relocation to London as if having a civil conversation with Harry Potter was an everyday occurrence. “Yes, we moved in January. Scorpius’ mother and her new wife wanted a change and we didn’t want our son to have to travel back and forth, going to school in one country and sleeping in another.” Draco looked behind him and saw that Scorpius was now deep in conversation with Al and Lily. Jamie was still reading his comic book, seemingly unaffected by the scene in front of him.
“I told you, I’ve brought you lunch.” Harry said, looking around at the various cauldrons and potion ingredients scattered about.
Harry walked Draco and Scorpius to the front door, apologising for his lack of Floo connection.
“I...erm...I...fuck…” Harry tried to close his eyes and back out of the room, but banged his hip on the open door. “OW fuck! I’m sorry I was just looking for a deck of cards and I’ll just go should I sleep somewhere else tonight? Don’t answer that I’ll just sleep somewhere else tonight Merlin’s saggy ballsack where the fuck is the door?” Harry was yelling incoherently, still trying to find the doorknob without opening his eyes.
Draco once again gawped at Harry. “You want me to come to a family gathering? Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
Saul entered the kitchen first and raised his eyebrows as he looked between the two men. “Ah, young love,” he said, chuckling. “I remember it well.” Harry tried to pat down his hair, wondering how Saul had known immediately what they’d been up to.
“We’re going to open this space up a bit, make it more inviting for our little family to spend time in here!” Bobby says loudly, trying to be heard over the din of tools. “I’m going to reorganize the wall opposite the fireplace to house Teddy’s toys and books, and we’re getting a whole new color scheme and furniture that’s going to brighten up the place. I’ll start on the upstairs tomorrow!” Bobby laughs, gesturing with his wand in his hand. “And I have to say, is it heavenly to be able to use magic in the open! Our magi-crew is used to working under all sorts of disillusionment charms and we’ve had to Obliviate more no-majes than I’m willing to admit in the past few years on this show. Now you can all see how I manage to get everything done in less than a week: with literal magic!”
“Not only is it beneficial for mental health and aids in relaxation, but it also improves one’s flexibility. Immensely. I, for instance, can hook my leg behind my neck. Wanna see?” Draco lifted his head and waggled his eyebrows at Harry, who laughed and rolled on top of him. “Show me,” he whispered into Draco’s ear.
“Well, I don’t have much cause to interact with that part of society.” Draco sighs. “I swear I have no issue with Muggles any longer. I’ve learned the egregious error of my ways and also learned a lot about muggles and their culture in the past decade. And to be perfectly honest with you any hesitation I have in immersing myself in their world is that I’m simply overwhelmed by it all. Did you know that an electrical current can kill you?! And the internet!” Draco shudders. “Hermione and Harry have both tried to give me tutorials on using electronic mail, but with little success.”
“Scorpius is certainly taken with Albus. He hasn’t stopped talking about him since we first met you at the deli.”
Draco chose his next words carefully. “I fell in love quite early on in life. I knew then, as I do now, that that particular relationship would never happen. So, I chose another path. I’ve contented myself with my son and my work,” Draco looked down at his long-empty teacup. “For me, and of course this doesn’t go for everyone, but for me, I truly believe that I was destined to only fall in love only once.”
“OK, Harry. I’m ready. Fuck me.” Draco met Harry’s gaze and smiled, fully and genuinely. “I mean it! Let’s get on with the fucking.” Draco laughed and squeezed Harry’s arse. With a loud moan, Harry pulled out halfway and slammed back in, causing Draco’s eyes to roll up and his head to fall back against the pillows. “Yes, like that, Potter. Yes!” Harry tried to establish a steady rhythm, but Draco was moaning and writhing beneath him and every so often his muscles would shift and clench, causing Harry’s hips to stutter. He was so close already, and it had barely been more than a minute or two of thrusting into Draco. He began to recite the starting lineup of the Chudley Cannons, desperately trying to stave off his orgasm.
Draco appears at the doorway. He snorts and says: “What routine?”
“Holy fucking Founders.” Malfoy was leaning against the door, his arse red where Harry’s hands had gripped his cheeks. He turned his head and look at where Potter was still kneeling, staring at Malfoy’s arse reverently.
“I appreciate you opening up to me about your life. I truly do. But you just have no idea what you’re talking about in this situation.” Draco moved to clean up the tea service.
“Thank you all for coming! Chag Sameach, as we say in Hebrew. I’d like to extend a special welcome to our newest guests, the Malfoys!” Saul said to the assembled mass of people now seated at the magically-enlarged dining room table. “Once again, our Harry has outdone himself. He’s spent the past three days cooking this feast, and it is absolutely delicious.” There was a murmuring of agreement around the table. They’d prayed, they’d sang, they’d told the story of Passover; it was almost time for dessert and for the children to find the afikomen, but Saul had taken the opportunity to make his annual speech. “When I first met Harry, he was nothing but skin and bones. And now look at him! He’s getting a gut!”
“Stop navel gazing, boychick.” Harry started and turned to see Saul entering the kitchen. “You’re a good looking young man so stop searching for flaws.” Saul winked and took his usual seat at the kitchen table. “I saw how that Draco Malfoy was looking at you today. I know he’d agree with me.” His eyes twinkled and Harry scoffed.
(I may not remember much of the evening, but I was assured by her house elf that I conducted myself in a manner befitting a Malfoy. Which, looking back, is perhaps not what one wants to hear after an evening of debauchery.)
“Lies! Lies and hearsay!” Shouted Blaise, laughing.
His arms were shaking, but Harry controlled his movements so that he didn’t shove into Draco all at once. Little by little he pushed in, his dick enveloped slowly by the tight heat. Finally, he was fully seated in Draco, the curls of his dark pubic hair resting against Draco’s entrance. Malfoy’s erection had wilted, and so he grasped Draco’s shaft and gently pulled, glad that his hands were still covered in lube. He leaned down to press kisses to Draco’s chest and neck, biting at his collarbone and sucking on his earlobe, waiting for Draco to adjust to the sensation of being filled.
“Yes and no. We actually do have a working Floo, but it’s only connected to Ginny’s flat, the Granger-Weasley’s, and The Burrow.” Harry ran a hand through his messy hair as he talked; Draco tracked the movements and idly wondered if his hair was as soft as it looked. He’d quite like to run his own hands through the inky black strands, perhaps pulling a bit and scratching his nails along Harry’s scalp…
Draco smiled into Harry’s neck and bent his head down to press a kiss to his stubbly jaw. “You need a shave, oh fiancé mine.”
“You OK?” Harry asked, noticing the sharp movement.
“Now, help me get these fucking shoes off. I think they might be welded to my feet at this point.”
“We need to evaluate what we’re working with here, obvs!” Jonathan replies.
Jonathan claps his hands and does a little jump. “Watch out or I’ll get the impression you actually like me, sweetness!”
[Scene cuts to Jonathan standing back, appraising the cut he’s given Draco. Draco’s hair is significantly shorter, and has more volume and texture than before.]
“Give me those knickers,” Harry demands, his voice gruff.
“Hello, sweeties. How are things progressing this morning?” Dr Song, their new Muggle Studies professor, gazed serenely down at the Malfoy/Potter trench. She was holding her omnipresent notebook open in her hands, pen poised and ready to record their findings.
Harry had no idea how long he’d been walking, but he noticed that dusk had settled over London when his stomach grumbled. He glanced down at the battered watch on his wrist without actually noting the time, and looked around while trying to remember the last time he’d eaten. Harry had left Grimmauld Place in a daze, feeling overwhelmed and stir crazy. The insomnia that plagued him since he’d run out of his supply of Dreamless Sleep a week prior was making it difficult for him to keep the door shut to the grief that constantly threatened to overtake him. When he’d had gotten out of bed that morning - pointedly ignoring the stack of unanswered letters from his friends and adopted family “just checking in... we haven’t heard from you, Harry, and we’re worried…” - Harry was seized with the need to leave the stiflingly stale air of the old Black home. He’d dressed and stepped out of his house for the first time since he’d locked his doors, closed his Floo connection, and put up as many wards as he could come up with almost a month ago.
________________
“Wow! You look great!” Teddy yells, jumping up. “Draco, you look like a movie star with those sunglasses on!”
“I … you... wow, yes, thank you!” Harry said, so grateful he almost launched himself at Draco to hug him. He held off, but ended up shuffling forward awkwardly as he went to take the wine and ran into the side of the counter. Jamie laughed, still lounging on the sofa.
Draco approached the table and opened the tub, realising how hungry he was the moment the salty scent of the soup hit his nose. “Fine. I’ll eat, you can tell me whatever it is you want to say. Was Scorpius a problem last night? I assume you’d have called or Floo’d if there had been an emergency.”
“Depends,” Harry said. “Would your mother have threatened me at wand-point to fix whatever I’d bollocksed up between us?”
Just then, Neville came and plopped down on Harry’s other side. He drew him into a conversation about the pros and cons of asking his girlfriend Hannah to move in with him in the fall. It was for the best, Harry reasoned, as he had no idea what he would say to Malfoy anyway. “Hey Malfoy, I know we’ve set aside our differences and have managed to have some civil conversations, and you’ve just admitted to having some sort of sexual desire for me, and I’ve recently started to think that I fancy you quite a bit, so I think we should have a shag and see how that goes?” He reasoned that it wasn’t the worst way to proposition someone, but it probably wasn’t the best. “Want to go somewhere more private?” had worked for him in the past, but that line was usually shouted into someone’s ear while they were dancing at a club.
“You can handle the Howlers yourself, then.” Harry opens the door to their bedroom to reveal Teddy and Troglobite, both dressed up for the party: Troggy is wearing a small bowtie and is trying desperately to get the cone-shaped party hat off of his shaggy head. Teddy looks like a combination of his dads, donning khaki trousers and a short-sleeved button down shirt with a bow tie that matches the dog’s.
“Right. Of course,” Draco cleared his throat. “Hermione Granger. I am sorry, from the bottom of my heart for the wrongs I committed against you. Beginning in first year, when I implied that you were less than I simply because of your birth…” He continued for nearly half an hour, listing in chronological order every time that he’d said or done anything to harm or hurt her, either physically or mentally. When he made it to sixth year, he was crying but determined to get through his speech. Granger remained silent, conjuring a handkerchief when he needed it and otherwise allowing him to speak without interruption.
“Yes, oh gods...touch yourself. I want to watch you come.”
Harry chuckles. “I love you, Draco.”
Draco leaned over the cauldron, keeping careful count of the number of widdershins stirs he was making with his wand. He straightened up and removed his goggles, writing several lines in his notes. He sighed and brushed his hair out of his eyes, pausing to wipe the sweat from his brow. He had adjusted the climate charms in his laboratory to keep the tropical plants he was working with happy, and he was currently in his shirtsleeves but was seriously considering stripping down to his pants.
Bobby nods. “She also supplied my team with a large selection of photographs. I’m telling you, that woman is a force of nature. I’ve never seen posture like that in my life.”
Harry thought about the engagement ring he had hidden in his gym bag, bought when he and Draco had been together for three days. It was simple and gold with a tiny emerald and ruby on either side of the word
Granger nodded. “Yes, well, I always thought that if I saw you again I’d hex your bollocks off. But here we are, you with testicles intact.”
Several people clapped and it was Harry’s turn to blush.
“Yeah, but not…
Harry had laughed, shifting around on the bed a bit. I imagined that his erection was causing him some discomfort, so I made my way towards him and picked up the discarded panties from where Harry’d dropped them.
Never let it be said that Draco Malfoy was one to stand in the way of true love. He himself had been in unrequited love with the same person since he was fifteen years old, and had long since accepted that he’d never know the thrill of one’s beloved loving them back.
“We married each other for our bits, actually. She wanted an heir as much as I did, but we’re both gayer than Christmas. So we appeased our families and married. And Scorpius is the single best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Much to his relief, the game seemed to dissolve as people began having conversations amongst themselves. Harry sneaked a glance to his left where Draco was sitting, and saw that he was gazing into the fire, his blonde hair hanging over his cheek and shining in the light.
“You better not. Never change, Harry. Never.”
“Read it,” Draco prompts. “Start down here.”
“Hey. Hey! Harry!” Hermione was poking him in the thigh.
“Bite me, Scar Head,” Draco says, a small smile playing at his lips.
Harry looked around the small kitchen. Next to the hob were an assortment of vegetables; he found dry pasta in a cupboard and milk, ground beef, eggs, and butter in the refrigerator. “OK, Malfoy, what do you think? Spaghetti and meatballs?”
“But there’s no hitting in the Granger-Weasley family!” Hugo said, looking distressed. “Is Rose allowed to hit me now?”
Harry went back to the deli every day that first week that he’d discovered it. The Weinberg’s welcomed him happily every evening except for Friday: when he reached the door to the deli he found the lights off and a small package of matzo ball soup under a disillusionment charm with a note explaining that they were attending Shabbat services.
Hermione stood stiffly with her arms crossed over her chest, regarding the two men in front of her. “I suppose that I forgive you. But only if I’m allowed to give a speech at your wedding.”
“No, Lily,” Answered Draco, a small smile playing at his lips. “No matter how much you may feel someone deserves to be kicked in the penis, violence is only acceptable in three situations.”
“I call this Wotfoy Session to order!” Saul said, reaching for his usual mug (a gift from Ron that was bright green with the slogan ‘Slaggy for Slytherin’ in looping cursive. And hadn’t
“Look at me, Harry,” I try to put some authority into my voice. “There is nothing I wouldn’t do to make you happy, you daft arse. I also enjoyed this exploration of your kink... I think we’re past the stage where I’d judge you for something you wanted to do in the bedroom, don’t you?”
“Oh please honey child, you don’t hate me! Just you wait until you see your man over here glistening in the morning light, his hair tousled instead of ... Whatever it is he has going on now.”
“Is this what you want, Potter?” Malfoy took another step forwards and inserted his right leg between Harry’s. “Do you want to fuck me? Is that why you’ve been so bothered by me this year? Or is it just because you hate Death Eater scum and want to hex me into oblivion?”
He chuckles and adds a second finger almost immediately. I let out a sound somewhere between a whimper and a groan and fuck back onto Harry’s hand.
“Thanks so much, Draco,” Harry said, taking a wet plate from him and toweling it dry. “Cleaning up is much more enjoyable with you here.”
At least, that’s what Hermione had said. For the past ten years, Harry had heard stories about ‘Draco’ and how wonderfully he’d matured; how smart and funny he was; how handsome he looked in his laboratory robes (that last one was purely conjecture, but Harry was confident he’d cut quite a figure in those ivory research robes). Harry had read every single paper that he’d published, never mind that he’d only understood about half of what he was talking about. He’d fallen in love with his witty prose style and thirsted for the anecdotes that Hermione would share about this conference or that presentation.
“Hello, Albus,” Draco said, putting a hand on his son’s shoulder to stop him from running off. “Scorpius and I came early to help you prepare for all your guests. Why don’t we ask your father what we can do to help?”
[The scene cuts to the guys, plus Ron and Hermione, standing in a darkened entrance hall. Hermione conjures her Patronus and sends it away with a message for Harry.]
“And now we need to speak to Teddy. He looked quite alarmed by your exit, you great pillock. Come along, Potter!” Draco is already halfway down the hallway.
, Harry thought, “and I was hoping that you could help me solve that mystery.” He shrugged his shoulders, waiting anxiously for Malfoy to respond.
“These are iconic!” Jonathan screeches, twirling around. “My cousin had a poster of you wearing one of these! I think it must’ve been during your Hogwarts years because you hadn’t grown into your shoulders yet. And boy have you filled out, you gorgeous hunk!” Jonathan winks.
“Well, he’s five. Don’t look so smug.”
Harry glanced at Draco, who was sat with his arms crossed tightly and his back rigid. “Ok then,” he thought, “still pissed.” He sighed and turned to face the rest of his family.
“Get over here, Teds,” Harry extends an arm out to where Teddy is scowling at his parents. He rolls his eyes but allows himself to be pulled into the embrace.
Harry picks his head up and meets Draco’s gaze, a question in his eyes.
Jonathan winks and blows a kiss at Harry.
Last winter Sophia had fallen ill and died quite suddenly. Harry and Ginny had spent the weekend following sitting shiva and helping Saul sort through her belongings. They passed long hours going through albums full of photos documenting vacations and adventures, making piles of clothes to give away and filling boxes with tchotchkes to give to the Potter children. After the final load had been donated and Saul had shut himself in his room, Harry had found Ginny crying on the sofa in the sitting room, holding a paper yellowed with age in her freckled hands.
“Remus and Tonks were your dad and mum, and will be forever,” Draco continues. “But Harry and I want you to know that we never, ever, for a single moment, would consider a life without you here. You are our son, even if you don’t want us to file these papers.”
They went back to preparing the meal in a comfortable silence, occasionally bumping shoulders and hands as they worked.
“Right about what?” Harry asked.
[Draco interview/confessional: I had no idea that my mother was involved in this. Draco sniffles slightly, clears his throat, and sits up straighter. I must admit that I’d rather she hadn’t provided quite so many photos of me during my clothing-optional years, but I’m certainly grateful that she wanted to add some familiar touches to Bobby’s design. I have wonderful memories of countless hours spent sprawled out on that rug, my nose buried in various books.]
“You asked. I answered.” Draco grinned, enjoying seeing how easily he could wind Harry up. This opened up a whole world of possibilities. “Would you like that, Harry? Would you like me to put you over this table and fuck you until you forget your own name? Perhaps spank you a few times for being such an arse last night?” Draco stopped, thrilled to feel Harry’s dick growing hard against his hip.
and groans. Draco crosses his arms over his chest and raises an eyebrow. “Explain further, Teddy.”
I cocked my head, trying to suss out what was causing him to act like a 12-year old who’d been caught wanking. It wasn’t like Harry to be prudish about sex—at least, not since I’d blasted away those walls a decade ago with my refusal to accept his nervous stammers when discussing our sex life—but it seemed that this particular lingerie-related kink was something that made Harry uncomfortable.
Bobby and Jonathan run inside, emerging moments later both wearing old, faded knit sweaters in different colors emblazoned with large “H”s across the chest.
Harry was distracted by the way the firelight highlighted Malfoy’s sharp cheekbones, and it took him a moment to process the response. “Wait, what?”
(Harry had said as much to Draco as his alarm went off that very morning and was met with a groan of “coffee first, then sentiment!” and pillow to the face instead of the kiss he had expected. His beloved was
“You think it’s adorable when Draco scowls?” Ginny asked, grinning wickedly.
Harry seems to realise this, however, and he takes his wand from its holster and performs a complicated series of swishes and flicks. And I suddenly find myself without the panties, but with everything else intact.
“Of course we are! But, well, officially, we are your ‘guardians’. Draco and I decided that we wanted to make everything formal and adopt you.” Harry explains.
“That’s nothing compared to you and Malfoy!” Ron said, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands behind his head. “The other day I asked, ‘where’s the beef?’ and you started laughing for ten minutes and then Floo’d Malfoy so you could both cry with laughter,” Ron shook his head.
“Untwist, Harry! For the love of Merlin.” Draco emerged from the bathroom in a puff of steam, the late afternoon sunlight that shone through the bay windows causing the combination of heat and dust motes in the air to create an ethereal, other worldly setting.
He groans loudly and stills, shooting stripes of white onto the black garments.
“Is there a question in that statement?” Draco says, raising an eyebrow.
Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco, who still had his eyes closed. His cheeks were slightly pink and his brow was furrowed as if he were in pain. The realisation hit Harry like a freight train: Draco was in love with someone else. He had only just told him last week that his heart had belonged to the same person since he was fifteen, and here was Harry, getting in the middle of a relationship that he himself had encouraged Draco to pursue.
“And yes, you could say that we didn’t get on very well for the first, oh seven odd years of knowing each other?” More laughter, and a few comments rang out across the room. “Ok fine, yes, we absolutely hated each other. But I think deep down I was still that eleven year old - even when we were hexing the living daylights out of each other - jealous of the confident wizard with the pointy chin.” Harry looked down at the floor, trying to gather his thoughts. He shook his head as if to clear it, and looked up to meet Draco’s grey eyes. “When you wrote me that letter a few years after the war, I knew you had grown up. And I had, as well. You told me all about your community service, and learning about Muggles, and apologised for everything that happened during the war in that roundabout way of yours. I didn’t respond to the letter, because I wasn’t sure what to say. I was tempted to write you back, of course, to tell you all about my own experiences, but I was afraid. And it was easier for me to just put things in drawers and not think about them, back then.
“Oh fuck, Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry began, taking several steps backward.
Draco allowed his scowl to deepen. He was a champion scowler.
“No arguments here, Potter,” Draco muttered.
Harry waved his hand dismissively. “Hermione’s already cleared your way. She’s been warning us that she’d convince you one of these days to accept one of her invitations to this or that event, so we’ve all been expecting it to happen eventually. Ron calls you the ‘silent spouse’ in his marriage, by the way. He’s half certain she’s going to leave him for you.”
“What sorts of things do you like to cook? Are there any family recipes that you grew up with?” Antoni asks Harry and Draco, who are seated at the large wooden dining table.
“Erm, the constant threat of death? The forced torture? The murder?” Harry responded, not looking up from the large handle sherd he was scrubbing free of dirt with a toothbrush.
Harry groaned and moved his hands to the fly of his denims. Who was he to deny Draco something when he’d asked so nicely?
Harry nodded and allowed Draco to slick up his cock. “Face the other way,” Harry said, positioning Draco so that they were looking out towards the fireplace. He sat up behind him and waved his hand, opening the door to their armoire and revealing a large mirror.
“No. I’m afraid that if I open my eyes I’ll realise that I’m dreaming. That I’m in my bed and this is just a very vivid, very sexy dream. It’s happened before.”
I lean over and kiss him. “You’re welcome. And, you know, that was
“Give me an am/pm rundown. What’s your skincare routine?”
This time Harry pulled back. “Get on the bed, Draco. All fours. Arse in the air for me. Now.” Draco shivered. He couldn’t get enough of Harry taking control like this. He complied and looked over his shoulder, waiting to see what would come next. In the past three or so years, Harry had become completely attuned to what Draco wanted and needed in bed. Gone were the days of Harry waiting for Draco to ask to be spanked or bent over the nearest flat surface and fucked.
Teddy looks over at Draco and Harry. He shakes his head. “But I know that we love each other because I feel it in my heart.”
Harry looked down at his empty soup bowl before speaking. He wasn’t sure what to do with this information, but he found that he felt a sense of comfort in in the small deli, talking to these kind people without anything being asked of him in return. “I’m sorry if this is rude, but are you sometimes speaking a different language?” Harry finally asked. “Only, I’ve not been sleeping much and my brain feels a bit fuzzy…”
“Hi-ya!” Ron calls and waves a bit sheepishly.
“I’m not sure about ‘trademark’ look, but I suppose I started growing my hair out during my last few years at Hogwarts. I just lost interest in the upkeep of my shorter style...” Draco trails off, meeting Jonathan’s gaze in the mirror. He lifts one shoulder in a shrug. “It’s easy enough to manage at this length, and I can tie it back when I’m brewing potions.”
“I’d give it another few days. Pansy likes to play with her food before she eats it.”
“Are you fucking kidding me? You just cast wordlessly and wandlessly, you complete wanker. Do you have any inkling how hot that is?” Malfoy strode back over to Harry and grabbed his biceps, bringing their mouths together again. Harry groaned and guided his hands to Malfoy’s hips, bringing them flush together. Malfoy was a few centimeters taller than Harry, but the  difference was negligible, especially when they were pressed together head to toe. Malfoy broke the kiss to focus his attention on Harry’s neck, alternating between sucking and licking the tan skin. Harry took the opportunity to run his hands through Malfoy’s hair again, letting his nails scrape lightly against his scalp. Malfoy moaned, pressing his groin into Harry’s again.
Harry loved his children. He honestly, truly, completely loved them with all his heart. But right now, he wanted to lock them in the garden and never let them back in the house. Guests were due to begin arriving at the Potter/Weinberg household in less than an hour and Lily was currently running through the house wearing only her underpants and a tea towel wrapped around her neck like a cape, Al was refusing to come out of his room until Jamie apologised for whatever it was that Jamie had done, and Jamie was sat in the living room reading the newest Spiderman comic, casual as you like.
