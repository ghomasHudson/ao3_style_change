wand. It didn’t thrum in his grip like his own wand, but Draco could already tell it would work for him just as well as his mother’s. For a moment, the mad desire seized him to apparate straight out of there. But where would he go? The best thing he had going for him these days was currently sitting right in front of him, looking sorry for himself.
are the Lord, they will have a harder time justifying that. Even if you can find no way to get a more lenient sentence, they still have less to convict you with and so cannot take as much.”
“So. Right, first step is to make ourselves comfortable. I recommend we get the blankets off the bunk-beds and make nests over by that poor excuse of a fireplace. One doesn’t want to have to move anywhere once one is halfway through a firewhiskey bottle, and it’s best to pass out in a place that you wouldn’t mind sleeping in.”
She placed the stool by the sofa and hopped onto it, which gave her just enough height to be able to reach out her hands and hold them above Draco’s body. She closed her eyes and concentrated, a small frown-line forming between her brows. Draco noticed that her hands were shaking with a very slight, constant tremor.
The Elder wand wasn’t a myth. The Dark Lord was holding it, which surely meant that it was all over, that they were going to die right then in that hall. But Potter hadn’t even flinched, he had looked so focused and confident, and for the first time Draco thought that he might succeed.
The seconds ticked by, the pings of the warming kettle and the crackle of the fire the only sounds. Draco clutched the piece of bark and wished he had his wand - he couldn’t stop imagining the kitchen doors flying open, the Aurors pouring in, and he felt so unbelievably vulnerable with nothing but his cane, barely able to stand on this blasted leg. He could feel his breath starting to come shorter and faster.
, for 2pm. Apparently that was way earlier than necessary, but Draco didn’t want to take any chances. He sighed and turned back to his book.
Madam Pomfrey’s shoulders slumped a bit. “Essentially, yes. There’s no way to remove him from the castle, I’m afraid. Believe me, a few people have tried in the last thousand years and it never ends well for them.”
can either relax and get all skinny, or they can bunch up and get all fat, which then tugs on your bones and causes movement. There’s almost always an opposing pair of muscle groups, like the biceps and triceps in your arm here, so when one is contracting the other is extending. So you can see that if there was some scar tissue binding all these little ropes together, none of them would be able to move across each other freely. There’s a lot more going on in terms of how these cells are triggered, but that’s the basics. Any questions?”
“You’re comparing me to the sodding Dark Lord now, Potter? I’ll say it again: I haven’t killed anyone.”
No sooner had Draco done this when he heard the kitchen door bang into the wall again. With a wrenching sense of
“Malfoy!” Potter’s voice cut through the rest, surprisingly close (hadn’t he left him all the way up at the top of the Hollow?). Draco tried to turn to see him, but his vision was already swimming, and he lost his balance and fell backwards, landing with a splash in the shallow pool of memories gathered in the basin.
“Three life-debts I owe you, Potter. One for the fire, one for that Death Eater in the corridor during the battle and one for stopping Peeves from crushing me. It really pisses me off.”
Where could he go? The Manor was also too dangerous - there could still be Death Eaters out there like his uncle who would risk the chance of popping in for a spot of looting. Besides, the Manor held too many memories. He would visit it at the new moon for the ritual, of course, but until then he really didn’t want to go anywhere near it.
Potter looked over at Shacklebolt for a moment before mumbling, “Thanks, Professor, I’ll think about it.”
He dared a glance at Potter’s face, hoping not to find a question there that would compel him to admit even more. It was almost worse that Potter clearly understood.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You don’t have to do anything until she asks. I expect she’ll want your help when it comes time for her trial.” He wondered whether Potter would ever actually ask
Of course, he would have to go out again soon and continue his search for Potter, but he couldn’t go any further without some kind of crutch. He turned right and hopped down the passage to the boys’ dormitories, barely noticing the way his breaths sounded more like sobs at this point. He collapsed gratefully through the door to the seventh years’ room, sinking onto his bed and allowing himself to lie back against the pillows for a moment.
, he had to get out of here! With an effort of will, he restricted his movements to his eyes, which darted everywhere. His gaze caught on the pearly, nearly-invisible sheen of a ghost floating above his bed, up near the ceiling, and his breath froze in his chest.
Draco nodded again, in lieu of a proper bow, which he couldn’t quite manage with the crutches. He thought of offering his hand to shake, but she probably didn’t want to touch a Death Eater any more than necessary.
Patronus. An otter patronus was pacing back and forth through the air above Potter’s sprawled form, looking highly agitated. Potter was dead to the world, his jaw slack and his limbs tangled in the blankets.
Eventually the kettle started whistling, an unbearably loud sound in the silence, and Prudy reached quickly to move it off the heat. She levitated a mug to the kitchen table and came back over to Draco.
Draco kept his posture straight even as he wanted to shrink back against the wall. Every sensation felt raw and his heart pounded and he felt a bit nauseous.
Potter caught sight of the clean white bandage around his left forearm and frowned. “Are you hurt? I thought Madam Pomfrey had fixed your wrist - ”
Prudy peered at him from over the clutched pillow-case. She waited for him to continue, but Draco’s throat had closed up on him.
“Ha ha. I suppose you think you’re very amusing. Actually, and please do bear in mind I’m being forced to tell you this and I don’t want to and I don’t want you to make anything of it, right now I am both jealous of your ability to use sarcasm and rather glad you’re being a bit of a prat, because it’s familiar and I find it comforting, and I’m getting quite uneasy thinking about how many muggles there are within a mile radius of me. Also, I feel disgusting having to tell you all this.”
“Prudy, I’m so sorry.” Potter had to clear his throat to continue speaking. “I - he - it was a few weeks ago. And - it was my fault. He died saving me and my friends from - ” his eyes flickered up to Draco’s face, and Draco held his breath - “from great danger. We would all have died without him.”
It seemed that the more still and silent he held his body, the less he could hold his mind in check. His thoughts whirred, and nearly all of them made him feel uneasy. He jumped from wondering what it would be like to live in Grimmauld Place, to whether he wanted to return to Hogwarts next year, to Peeves, to his uncle, no - he’d rather imagine his parents being shut up into their cells in Azkaban than think of
Frona stared at him for several long seconds, and Draco didn’t dare to look away. Eventually, she nodded, apparently satisfied with whatever she saw on his face.
He swung his legs out of the bed and heaved himself to a sitting position, ducking his head to avoid the slats of the bunk-bed above him. He groaned as the movement reignited that stabbing sensation in his head. Ugh. He had forgotten he no longer had a wand; he couldn’t use his normal barrage of spells to get past the hangover. How did muggles manage? Perhaps Potter would take pity and cast them on him.
He could just close his eyes and let himself sleep for a bit, couldn’t he? But no, he wasn’t truly safe here. That Auror had sent a message and very soon, they’d be in here determined to find a way to capture him. Before that happened, he wanted a crutch, and he’d rather not use his new powers in front of anyone else.
“Hey!” The female Auror who had come to the Manor to re-arrest him was sitting on a chair a little way down the corridor. She sprang to her feet as Draco emerged. He almost laughed when he realised that he was only around the corner from the Slytherin quarters.
Her ears drooped; her tone of voice was resigned, almost wise. Draco wondered how he could possibly ever have inspired her loyalty. Why had she wanted to come back to him, even when she could have stayed free?
Draco had a moment’s blurred insight into how much Potter’s parents could have added to his life, and how much was missing. But Potter looked more excited than wistful. He was busy levitating the table to the centre of the tent and bringing out a couple of plates and cheap cutlery.
Draco noted that he was becoming very slightly inured to the wash of exposure every time he had to explain himself to Potter. His lungs felt raw and his heart was beating fast, but so far in this conversation Potter was yet to make him feel actively
Draco limped quickly to the table, held Prudy higher with one hand to protect his face, grabbed the mug and drained it, all in under three seconds. The liquid was still scorching hot and left his throat feeling even more scoured than before.
Draco’s smile faded. “I don’t know. I still did my best to get in your way last Saturday. Only a prat tries to stop someone who’s busy saving the world.”
Draco was momentarily stunned that they were talking openly about that. He had locked that secret down behind his Occlumency, lied and lied so desperately… but of course his father knew. He shook his head. “He has repaid it tonight. Twice over. I would have burned to death but he - he came back for me. And then he stunned a Death Eater who had me cornered.”
“Oh.” For a moment, his throat felt choked up and his eyes burned. Then the spell kicked in and his annoyance managed to chase away the threat of tears. “And now I have to tell you that I’m
Potter looked awkward. “Oh, well - I, er, couldn’t find it this morning. I think it’s still in Hermione’s bag.”
After a couple more failed attempts to reach Draco through the deceptively solid air, Potter shook his head slightly and first the female Auror and then Potter stepped away. Draco felt a surge of satisfaction that they were walking backwards, too wary to let him out of their sight.
The water, both the blob in front of his face and the small model in front of Potter’s, fell and splashed on the surface of the table.
“If you are quite done attempting to assault me, I’m going to the common room. And provided you get rid of the Aurors, I
Potter ran his hand through his hair. “Well, you know, Malfoy, you’ve always been a nasty git, but that doesn’t mean you deserved what Tom did to you. And Dumbledore. You were in an impossible position, and I don’t know if I’d have done any better in your place.”
The stone melted away and he all but fell through, whipping his right arm inside and turning in time to see the stone close again on the outraged Auror.
At least it was wizarding space. He wouldn’t have put it past Potter to have gone on the run from a genocidal dictatorship with only a muggle tent for shelter. It was a sub-par Undetectable Extension Charm, as the interior was still extraordinarily pokey - all three rooms added up to about half the size of his bedroom at the Manor. The whole place smelt strongly of cats, and he had never seen decor quite like it. He supposed this kind of fusty, mismatched tweeness would perhaps pass for style if one was poor enough, or a muggle, or perhaps both and also elderly.
“You are most welcome, Mr Malfoy. And if you are really able to help with the healing potion situation, I will be most appreciative.”
“Please take a seat, Mr Malfoy,” said Anne Liston, and Draco noticed that she was already sitting down in that rolling chair. He took a look at her, sitting with her hands clasped in front of her red cardigan, and even with his heart-rate heightened he couldn’t persuade himself that she meant him any harm. There was no need for breaking the Statute of Secrecy just yet.
At the bottom of the stairs, he ignored the door to his left that led to the wine cellar, or rather, the dungeon below the dining room where Lovegood and Ollivander and so many others had been held - even Potter, for all of ten minutes. Instead, he stopped in front of the stone wall directly in front of him.
Potter nodded, looking balefully into his glass, and tentatively took another sip. This time he swallowed with no difficulties.
Potter looked stricken. He clearly hadn’t thought through the likely reactions from his pseudo-family when offering Draco help. “Um… sorry?”
Winky’s watery eyes peered through her fingers at him, and Draco took a deep breath and kept talking. “I heard his last words, I think. I remember he said, ‘Dobby is a free elf.’ He was - he was so proud of being free.”
All right. He’d - he’d make a list. A list would sort things out. It would be awful seeing it all written down, but at least like that he could impose some order. Maybe it would feel less overwhelming than the images that were currently swirling round his head.
“Nice try, Malfoy. You won’t, as it happens. You just need to do your little Death Eater salute and then you can walk through the door easy as platform nine and three-quarters.”
“And you have already received a command from Harry to, what was it, ‘explain yourself’? Which has resulted in you being unable to lie to Harry?”
Potter checked his watch. “Let’s go. Bill’s going to be meeting us there in half an hour.” He swirled his wand and levitated Draco’s trunk in front of him. “We just need to get down to the gates and then I’ll apparate us there.”
“Not for… probably not for a few years, at least. It will be better to give the appearance that you no longer wish to be associated with me.”
Now then. The door in front of him was one huge slab of thick, heavy wood, and Draco felt the old magic stirring as he laid a hand against it. He was pretty sure he could transform it as he had the cane, but if the Path of the Penitent worked in the way that Frona said it would, he wouldn’t even need to do that.
That wasn’t the most important thing to focus on, though. Draco needed to decide what to do with Potter’s offer. He expected it would be fewer than ten seconds before Potter withdrew it, and Draco needed to consider the possible advantages before he lost the opportunity. He didn’t have time to think it through thoroughly, though - Potter was already opening his mouth.
Draco leant one crutch up against the side of the kitchenette so he could open the cupboard, and bring out two plates. It was awkward with one hand but he tried not to look like it was difficult. He didn’t want Potter to notice and then just levitate them over to the table. He wanted to do this. He turned and hopped back towards the table on one crutch, with the plates propped on his hip.
“I’m aware this may be a bit of a culture shock for you, Mr Malfoy, but when you don’t have magic, there is no instant fix.”
Draco pressed his lips together. His whole torso flared with shame and anger. It was hard to look at this man’s maimed face, harder still not to snap back as a desperate deflection, but he knew it was the very, very least he could do. It didn’t feel possible to do anything more, though.
Draco had to plant his crutches more firmly against the grass to prevent himself swaying where he stood. He felt ill.
had come back to themselves; Kingsley Shacklebolt was the temporary Minister for Magic; some of their fellow Death Eaters were dead, some captured, some fled. None of it seemed truly important.
No-one cast a spell, but the opening words of the ceremony were enough. Starting from the innermost circle, golden beams of light shot upwards, hitting an invisible dome. The dome reminded Draco of the Hogwarts wards, and it perfectly mirrored the shape of the Hollow below. As more and more beams of light poured into it, the blue of the sky faded away until they were encased inside a dome of magic. The grass and the people and the granite changed colour as they were bathed in gold.
Draco understood immediately. “Do you know when the new moon - ?” He stopped. He already knew. The knowledge arose instantly, and Draco’s stomach lurched as he realised this was an effect of the old magic. “Three weeks.” Three weeks and a day, to be precise. And the full moon started a week from now.
“In that case, Potter, please could you tell me how to get to - ” he checked the address, “Harley Street?”
He swung his crutches and ventured forth through the shimmer of the wards, imagining he could feel a slight comforting tingle as he passed through them. He fixed his eyes on the sad-looking beech tree at the corner of the grass square and made his way over to it, breathing a sigh of relief when he was safely underneath. Then he remembered that Potter had erected a Notice-Me-Not charm here, and reluctantly left its shade to linger on the ugly pavement instead. Why muggles insisted on building all their roads and pavements from this awful tarmac stuff, he would never understand. Give him some paving slabs or cobble stones any day, at least they had personality…
Draco’s left fore-arm itched. He couldn’t keep it hidden under the covers forever. He wished he had his wand to cast a glamour over the Mark. He really didn’t want to draw Madam Pomfrey’s attention to it, but he had to do something about it before the bloody Minister of Magic got here. He withdrew his arm from the covers, wrapping his right hand over as much of the Mark as he could.
“Potter, I wish I could tell you you are an uncivilised barbarian, but unfortunately, the Path spell won’t allow it. I thought you said you’d had firewhiskey before? You don’t just down it!”
That sounded like his cue to get moving. He turned his back on the Auror and started off down the corridor, keeping his left hand against the stone to help him as he hopped along. He couldn’t go fast and he knew this hopping looked ridiculous, but at this point, he was grateful for any cooperation his body could give him.
Her eyebrows rose. “Oh, is that so? That is excellent news. You would think Poppy would have mentioned it in her letter. But I suppose she is very busy with casualties at the moment.”
“I see.” Like the Manor gate. He straightened his back as much as he could while using the crutches to balance on the top step. “Then if you each put a hand on one of my shoulders, I should be able to take you in with me.”
Draco came to with a huge gasp. He was lying shirtless on his back on a hard stone floor, although someone had bundled some fabric behind his head as a makeshift pillow. He opened his eyes and stared at the stone ceiling, surprised to find it quite familiar.
Draco blinked at him. There was a light sheen of sweat across Potter’s forehead. Once again - just like that note yesterday - this was Potter being
“Right, so when your muscle is getting overloaded, the spasming is caused by the triggering mechanism for the contracting and relaxing going haywire. The bundle of fibres isn’t acting in concert any more; different strands of muscle cells are firing all at different times.”
Draco straightened his leg out a bit so she could see. The chunk taken out of the back of his calf was in an awkward place, since even while lifting it up it still faced the floor, but Anne Liston did not reach out and take hold of his leg, nor did she suggest that they move to the bed for a proper examination.
The rest of the food turned out to be just as unfamiliar and delicious, but far more sensibly spiced. There were triangular packages of pea and potato called samosas, a large and rather shapeless type of doughy flat-bread, called naan, and another curry called a chicken tikka masala. Draco regarded this one with utmost suspicion, but after watching Potter eat a few mouthfuls with evident enjoyment and without reaching for his water, he had a taste and found it just on the right side of bearable.
He watched out of the corner of his eye, and a few seconds later he saw Weasley and Granger get up and walk out of the hall.
Potter chuckled and stood up, going to the bedroom to collect the blankets from all four bunks. He threw them over towards the fireplace. “You take this pretty seriously, don’t you?”
that day, even when my - when Bellatrix was torturing Granger. So if anyone is to blame out of the two of us, it is definitely not you.”
himself without hesitation. He tried to get himself to turn round, to walk back up the spiral path and out of the Hollow, but his legs absolutely refused to take him further away from Hagrid. The best he could do was to hold himself still, and not even that for much longer.
Draco blinked, and was taken off guard by a brief, vivid sense-memory of wood under his hands, heat all around him and smoke in his lungs. His breath caught as if the smoke was real and he descended into a coughing fit.
Draco squared his shoulders, planted his crutches, and swung at a dignified pace towards the door. He half-expected another attempt to try and stop him, but neither Potter nor the Aurors moved from beside his bed. He thought he heard the start of a hissed discussion as the door fell closed behind him.
Potter refilled his glass and took another large swallow. They drank steadily for another twenty minutes before Potter spoke again, the words slightly slurred together.
Draco felt something quite like smugness. Perhaps he would try surprising people like this again sometime. “Does the Black house have a potions lab, Potter?”
They both stared at each other. After a moment, Potter took a deep breath. “Do you get what I’m trying to say?”
That didn’t seem likely somehow; Potter had always been more direct than that. A strange thought occurred to him. Could Potter’s intention be to
Draco recoiled slightly. “What? Potter, you can’t be serious - they’d tear me limb from limb.” And that wasn’t even sarcasm.
Draco kept staring, and blinking, and breathing, and half-listened as Potter started working his way around all three rooms of the tent, methodically casting
The drawing room barely resembled the elegant room Draco had grown up with. The Death Eaters had found many ways to entertain themselves during their residence here and one involved destroying and defacing the Malfoys’ property with impunity. Deep gouges scarred the surface of the long table, there was rubble in the fireplace, and the mirror above the mantelpiece was cracked clear from one edge to the other. The portraits here had all been abandoned by their occupants months ago; they were still hiding in the relative safety of the upper floors.
“Prudy!” At first, Draco just felt a rush of relief at hearing another friendly voice, but then a wave of dread pinned him to the mattress as he remembered what he now had to do. “Prudy, how about - how about you come up onto the bed? There’s room.”
“Yes. I can’t put any pressure on my leg. If I use the muscle then it seizes up and starts cramping.”
be my ally. Just the tacit approval of hosting me would go a long way towards counteracting the hatred I will receive as a Death Eater walking free. It should help to prevent another vigilante assassination attempt at least.”
Potter blanched, then pressed his lips together. Draco wondered if Potter was now, technically, a murderer - although the Dark Lord had fallen from his own spell… Did
“This Path thing doesn’t seem easy to me, Malfoy. It sounds a lot more risky than Azkaban, especially since they’re not going to be putting the Dementors back. You could die if it goes wrong! And you haven’t had it easy until now, either. You’ve suffered just as much as the rest of us, even if it was on the wrong side.”
Lestrange was grunting with each downward thrust of his hips. Draco gagged as he felt his uncle stiffening through their robes. Lestrange moved his wand arm across Draco’s throat, leaning his weight on his forearm so that Draco couldn’t breathe. This left Lestrange’s other arm free to release Draco’s hair and reach down between them, fumbling to push aside the folds of Draco’s robes, and with a sick lurch of fear Draco felt rough fingers find the top button of his trousers…
He passed it to her, realising for the first time that apparently the bark was real for her too. She hurried back to the table, climbing a short wooden step ladder to be level to it, and broke the bark into several pieces with her long fingers before dropping it into the mug. Then she levitated the kettle over and poured the boiling water over the bark.
“But.” His voice came out wrong, too strangled. He swallowed and tried again. “But how can I do that? I’m a Death Eater, too.”
Draco stuffed all the muggle money back into his pouch, not even bothering to try and count his change.
He gripped his crutches tighter. Was he or was he not a Malfoy? Did he or did he not own Malfoy Manor? And he thought
Draco blinked. “I’m not a student. I’m a Death Eater.” He suddenly realised that his hospital gown had short sleeves, and his Dark Mark was visible where his left arm rested on top of the covers. He shoved it under the covers instead, ignoring the increase in throbbing from his shoulder.
Neither of them spoke as they took this in. This was much more serious than Draco had realised at first. He’d been so smug that he’d tricked Potter into giving him a task, and a non-life-threatening one at that. Now Draco wanted to curl up into himself, hug his knees to his chest so he could keep some sort of barrier between them. He had never been at someone’s mercy quite like this before - even with the Dark Lord he’d had Occlumency. Potter could ask him anything, and then do whatever he wanted with the knowledge. And what was a Malfoy without his secrets?
He drew in gasp after gasp of the cold, clammy air, feeling as if he hadn’t drawn breath during his entire vision. He had known he was going to see his ancestors, of course, but it felt different than he had always expected. More bittersweet.
, and lifted her wand straight up, her posture rigid with defiance and pain. Across the Hollow, every single person lifted their wand too, and Draco clenched his fingers tighter around his crutches, wishing he could do the same.
Draco felt his mother’s hand on his lower back, and it was comforting. His mother and father gazed at each other for a moment, and Draco could tell they were saying goodbye. He wished it was possible to give them a minute alone together, but it was too late now.
Potter shrugged, faux-nonchalant. “Oh, you know, saw him in the afterlife. Had a bit of a chat before I came back, straightened it all out.” His eyes flicked over to Draco, and he grinned at his gormless expression.
“It is pointless, Draco. We have no wand between the three of us. And I will only harm your prospects even more as a fugitive than if I come willingly.”
Draco stared. It felt like every part of himself was being pulled towards that length of hawthorn. He had to fight to hold himself still. Gods. His
He absently massaged the dip in his leg with one hand while he looked around the room. The windows were just openings into blackness, and shadows flickered across the armchairs and tables. He spotted a tray of food on Potter’s armchair. He suddenly realised how hollow he felt. He hadn’t eaten in days.
Weasley gave him a relieved nod. “Good. Okay. Sorry, I know you wouldn’t, but I was starting to get a bit worried. Mum and dad - they need all of us, all their remaining children with them for that, you know?”
“You know I haven’t. Potter, are you sure this is edible? How have the muggles made it that colour?”
“Malfoy! Can you hear me? You’ve got to let me in, the branches are still growing, I can’t get through!”
Why was this elf so afraid of him? He was not her master, and without a wand, she was in fact much more powerful than him. Of course, house-elves as a rule had a healthy wariness of wizards, but most wizarding families had a much better relationship with their elves than the Malfoys. Could Winky know that somehow? Wait - yes, she could.
“Hmmm.” Myrtle glared directly into Potter’s face for a few more moments, before finally relenting. “Are you
“Harry, it is the least I can do. I am sure you could do with a place where you are guaranteed some privacy nowadays.”
The tree rustled contentedly, then lifted all its branches up again, allowing Draco to leave. He struggled to his feet and started the painful journey back to the main part of the house.
His father had deliberately misled him; he had softened the likely consequences when he explained the plan. Azkaban hadn’t had dementors since their defection two years ago, but now that the Dark Lord was gone the Ministry would get them back under control. Fucking hell, Draco couldn’t do it. He couldn’t risk that happening. If his father was Kissed - Merlin, no, no - then his soul would be gone. He’d never join his ancestors in the grove, even when his husk of a body eventually died. Draco would truly never see his father again.
Draco stood watching the spot where he’d lost track of the taxi as it got absorbed back into the other traffic, just breathing. So. His first muggle. His first car-ride. Not so bad.
Potter came to with a start and a snort, eyes widening in instant panic. In two seconds, he was on his feet with his wand drawn and pointed at Draco. Merlin, Draco was an idiot - what had he been thinking, waking Potter like that a week after a war?
Potter squirmed. “Well. That’s understandable.” He rubbed his nose for a moment. “Sorry. I have to remember not to ask so many questions…”
The sudden movement jarred his bones, and he gritted his teeth and laid back down as his whole left side throbbed. He took a careful deep breath and probed the pain. His bones seemed to be whole again, but fragile and tender. A dull ache had settled deep in his lungs.
“Harry! Where are you? The ceremony starts in half an hour, and Andromeda said you were meant to meet her and Teddy first, and Ron said you never came back to the castle last night. Please come soon, Harry, we’re really worried about you. I’ve got to go. Get here quickly, please!”
“Ah - no - but I haven’t asked yet.” The leaves rustled around him, and he almost felt like laughing at its obvious impatience. “Please, er, sir - could I have a piece of your bark?”
“No, the door’s fine. I… I’m scared, Potter, all right? Of going through the Hall, having people see me. I don’t want to be attacked. By them or by Peeves.”
Madam Pomfrey came over to join them, and summoned three extra chairs. She and Potter sat on the bed’s left side, the headmistress and minister on the right, far enough down the bed that Draco could just about keep them all in view.
Draco almost wanted to smile at her. “I’m glad you were here.” Then he felt awkward. This was getting far too Hufflepuff. “So. What you’re saying is that the only punishment Peeves will be receiving is a strict telling-off.”
The simple acts of showering and dressing himself took a long time, but even so, he knew he still had hours to kill before his afternoon appointment with this muggle healer.
Potter was watching his fingers as he picked at the fabric of the armchair like the barbarian he was. A strange thought flitted across Draco’s mind - could Potter be giving him space? He dismissed the idea instantly. Potter was a tactless oaf, there was
He turned back to look further into the wood. He had been told that he would see this, of course, but knowing the wood was here and being inside it were two different things. No wonder his father had loved coming down here. Above him, through the thick leaves, he could see hints of a darkening blue sky, lighter over towards the west. Looking as far as he could through the trunks, he could see no sign of the walls. The ground was mossy, springy earth, but as he limped forwards to the nearest tree, a tall half-grown sapling, he could still see the mosaic of his own face framed in its tiled circle on the ground in front of it.
He opened his trunk and brought out his familiar peacock quill, green ink and parchment. It felt good to see them again; they were a welcome piece of normality, and almost as comforting as the tea had been.
“You fucker, Dumbledore.” His words lacked bite, though. The only reason he could tell how much guilt he’d been repressing was the strange, airy gap it had left in his mid-section.
Draco tried to keep his breathing as quiet as possible as he grabbed Madam Pomfrey’s wand arm by the wrist. He stared at her, willing her to understand.
He had to get dressed from a sitting position on his bed, which was tricky. His left sock proved particularly difficult, as he couldn’t push his foot down into it without his leg protesting. But as each element of his school uniform went on, he felt more like himself, more collected and capable. He wished for his wand
“ - the only thing that would have worked is fresh phoenix tears, while the wound was new. How incapacitating is the wound? How much pain are you in?”
“It wasn’t - it wasn’t - ” Potter had to break off and take a deep breath. “It wasn’t supposed to be this way.”
He looked around the tent carefully twice before concluding there was nothing else he needed to take, and then ducked out under the tent-flap. He blinked in the strong sunlight and adjusted his grip nervously on his crutches, looking around the whole square for any sign of muggles. No-one was walking around, or looking out of the windows, as far as Draco could see. Despite that, he could feel his breath suddenly coming faster, and his heart had already been pounding, and despite not having any lunch, he was beginning to feel sick…
Draco was caught off guard. Potter was deliberately trying to not take advantage of the spell. It went so against how Draco himself would have acted that he wanted to cringe. His gratitude mingled with a hot rush of shame and he fought to stop it turning into desperate, defensive anger. All this time he’d been so sure that Potter was a dickhead, but here he was, proving himself to be a genuinely decent person over and over again.
Madam Pomfrey. Draco reluctantly stopped groping under the bed for the slats below the bed-frame and lay down again - his body
Draco could feel himself wanting to hide. He was far too exposed while lying in a bed. He didn’t want to talk about which people he had hurt the worst. He had some fairly good ideas, but he didn’t fancy rehashing all the bad things he’d done with the Minister and the Headmistress and the Saviour of the Wizarding World. And what if he forgot someone obvious? How bad would that look?
Lucius cleared his throat. “It is time for you to come into your inheritance.” Draco snapped his gaze back to his father’s face. “If I am Lord of the Manor when they sentence me, they will take our whole estate in reparations, and the house of Malfoy will be lost. If
Potter looked just the same as he ever had, and yet different. He was taller, skinnier, and obviously exhausted. But he still had that same
“It was in the forest. After I - after Tom hit me with the Killing Curse. He made her come over to check on me. She could feel my pulse, but she bent over me and whispered - well - she asked if you were alive, and in the castle.”
too close to the parked cars beside them - and then the car turned the corner of the square and picked up speed, heading straight towards a road with lots and lots of
Potter wasn’t going to just hand it over. Draco was a war criminal with a Dark Mark and a mysterious ability to leave his cell whenever he wanted.
The place had been thoroughly ransacked. The very idea of cleaning it up without a wand was a joke. The floor of the tiny kitchenette was ankle-deep in smashed crockery and several of the cabinet doors had been torn off. Two of the four bunk-beds in the bedroom were lying on their side on the floor, blocking access to the other end of the room, and one of the thin mattresses had been gutted with swipes of a knife. Back in the main room, a wireless lay smashed on its side on the tiny dining table. The contents of pretty much every drawer and shelf in the whole place had been dumped on the ground and stamped on.
Draco looked round nervously but they were alone. Turning left, they went through the door to the cellars, along the short passageway. Draco found the descent of the rough stone stairs nearly impossible, but he refused to shuffle down the steps on his bum or let Prudy levitate him. Eventually he managed it through placing his cane on the step below, bracing his hand on the wall on the other side, and hopping down on his good leg.
Prudy sniffed and nodded, bringing up a corner of her pillow-case to wipe her eyes. “Prudy is just wishing Prudy is being there to protect Master Draco.”
“Well, no-one told them to me.” Potter curled up in the armchair, head clutched in his hands, his wand sticking out from his fingers at an odd angle.
He lurched out of her reach, panicking outright, and scrambled the last few metres, half-falling down the hill. He crossed channel after channel full with precious silver, smearing it on his clothes and hands as he passed, sullying, besmirching -
“It was - rushed. But I am of-age.” He forced himself to meet Shacklebolt’s eyes with proper Malfoy imperiousness. It felt a little forced from his prone position in a hospital bed.
He laboriously rolled up his socks so he could get them on more easily; he winced as he tried to manoeuvre his left foot into his school shoe without pressuring his calf muscle. Finally, he considered the issue of outerwear. Weasley had left a ratty Chudley Cannons’ sweater behind, but Draco could not bring himself to wear it. If he’d had his wand, then
Draco appreciated his effort, but unfortunately it didn’t make a difference. The spell seemed to interpret Potter’s facial expression as being a question. He sighed. “It pisses me off because it puts me in a very weak position. Malfoys aren’t supposed to be indebted, we’re supposed to be the ones who are owed. But actually it makes little difference right now, since I’m in pretty much the most vulnerable position possible in any case. You can take any information you want from me, and tell anyone, and use it all against me.”
Prudy’s eyes suddenly filled with tears. “Oh - well - Prudy was hoping… b-but Prudy understands if - ”
Potter was frowning, and was about to say something, but just then the door opened and the other two visitors arrived. Potter hastily stood up from where he’d been sitting on the mattress.
, you snivelling little worm. You never loved him, never served him willingly. Just like your father, only in it for what you could get out of it. You make me
“Yes, they did. And very powerful. We couldn’t do much against them, actually, and we didn’t have much reason to trust them. When we first encountered each other, there were atrocities committed on both sides. It came to the brink of all-out war. Frona said that the Path of the Penitent came out of the negotiations to avoid that war. It’s a way for an elf to take personal responsibility for their wrongs, and atone for them directly. In the meantime, that elf cannot be held against their will, and afterwards, if they’ve walked the Path successfully, then they are allowed a fresh start. It’s an older way of settling things than the Wizengamot. It both predates and supersedes our wizarding laws. It only works if the elf has never committed murder, though.” Draco stopped, suddenly realising how close he had come to ruining his own chances by nearly killing Lestrange. Would that have counted, since it was self-defence?
Draco grudgingly opened his eyes. His eyeballs felt gritty and his back was stiff from this horrible mattress. And his leg ached. The sunshine poured in through the cloth of the tent, hot and bright. It seemed to stab into his brain. Fuck. He was out of practice with this alcohol thing. Had it really only been a week since he had last blacked out in his bed in the Slytherin dorms? Had it really only been a week since the end of the war? It felt like six months.
Potter untucked a hideous pouch from under his t-shirt where it hung around his neck, and reached inside it. He pulled out Draco’s wand.
After an hour or two he fell into a light doze. He jolted awake when something icy passed through his hand, and he almost screamed at the translucent figure looming over him.
He dozed, then woke up fully as the lake beyond the windows went from inky black to a light grey. He felt significantly better now that he had eaten and slept and knew with certainty that no-one could take him away to Azkaban. His head still ached, though, and his leg cramped just from the act of sitting up on the sofa; apparently it was stiff after lying still for so long.
Okay. What about the way they’d handled this back when his father had been imprisoned? He remembered the monthly visits to Azkaban over that miserable year. His mother had smuggled in the silver knife, and his father’s dripping blood always seemed far too loud as he slowly filled a glass phial. Prudy could be Draco’s visitor, and hide the knife… But Prudy wouldn’t be able to use the blood afterwards. It had only worked because Draco was a Malfoy.
Draco looked down at Potter’s wand; his grip tightened around it reflexively for a moment. Then he took one more deep breath and handed it back.
Two hours later, Draco and Prudy landed in the entrance hall of the Manor. Draco had to let go of Prudy’s hand and lean heavily on the cane Frona had conjured for him to avoid falling to the floor as his left calf spasmed. He pressed the back of his hand to his mouth to prevent any sound of pain escaping and waited for the half-minute it took for his leg muscle to settle again. Prudy watched him carefully, eyes wide and worried.
“Draco, my darling, your father is right. It is over for us. We will submit to however the new regime sees fit to treat us. You have by far the harder role to fill. You must keep the house of Malfoy from falling into the hands of the blood traitors. All they see is our wealth and our estates. They do not know the old magic. You are the only one who can uphold it. You must fight for your freedom.”
the castle. That was the only way Draco could truly be safe, he realised - he had to leave Hogwarts. It was only now that he was facing the prospect of permanent exile that he realised how much he would miss it.
Draco got up and gathered the pillows from the bunk beds too, going over to the fireplace with them jammed under his arms and using a crutch to poke the tangle of blankets into two even piles. He then added two pillows to each pile and eased himself down to the floor, hard to do with one leg held out awkwardly. It was embarrassing to have Potter watch him struggle with such simple actions, so he busied himself getting all the blankets and pillows around and under him rather than meet his eyes.
.” His leg crumpled beneath him, and he landed in an awkward heap on his left side. One of the damn crutches whacked him on the shin on the way down.
Madam Pomfrey turned to look at him. “Yes. It was a near thing too, Mr Malfoy. Your injuries were catastrophic. But I have not lost my touch yet.”
Potter nodded, and squirmed a little in his chair. Draco supposed it should be better that Potter felt uncomfortable too, but instead it just seemed to double the amount of awkwardness. Draco was certain his face was pink.
“Maybe it would have helped a bit on some of the nights we spent in this tent this year. God, it was grim.”
“Anyway, Malfoy, we’re getting side-tracked. I want to know about this Path of the Penitent, how it works, why we can’t hex you, everything.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “How did you explain the murder tree, then? And the shield I made when Peeves was after me?”
better than what you have now. You will have most of the function of your leg. You will not suffer from debilitating and painful muscle seizures. You will be able to live a much less restricted life.”
“No. My psychotic aunt did. In my house. I wouldn’t blame you for blaming me, Potter, at least a little. But, well, I doubt it’ll help, but I am - ” He had to swallow as his voice thickened. “I am exceedingly sorry that he’s dead.”
For a moment they both stayed still and looked at each other. Then Potter stepped forward, his movements slightly jerky, and put the bag of takeaway down on the small table.
Draco took the piece of muggle parchment that she held out, holding it awkwardly in front of his face without moving his head. It was too smooth and the letters on it were unnaturally even, not hand-written. It informed him that this muggle Healer was called Dr. Anne Liston and worked in a place called Harley Street, in London.
“No! Well - technically, I suppose. I just don’t think there’s anyone around who you’d attack right now, except for Peeves.”
No house-elf had ever looked at Draco the way Frona was doing now: direct, calm, and cooly appraising. His instinct was to reprimand her for her forwardness, but he stifled it. She was free, ancient and powerful, and Draco couldn’t force her to do anything. It wasn’t the first time that his only hope depended on a house-elf, and no matter how demeaning it might be, he would willingly beg her to help him if necessary.
“Oh. I guess maybe it is a bit strange to come here. I just couldn’t - ” Potter’s voice broke, and he stopped, clenching his jaw.
“In the Manor - I have a stash of healing potions, and sleeping draughts. A large stash, over a hundred bottles.” Draco could see Pomfrey light up in his peripheral vision. “There’s nothing fancy, but there’s an array of basic pain-relief and blood-renewing potions, as well as a lot of Dreamless Sleep. I brewed them myself. I’m no Sn - no Potions Master, but Potter can attest that I’m a competent brewer. They’re hidden under the floor in my private study on the second floor of the East Wing.”
Draco was once again grateful for the Dreamless Sleep when he woke up the next day. Without night terrors or visions for a couple of nights, and with Madam Pomfrey carefully making sure he ate enough, he had some energy again. He was not strong, and not whole, since his leg still cramped occasionally and most of the bones in his torso and arm still ached, but he would take this over the way he’d felt for the last two years.
Potter came back to where Draco could see him, waiting for him to continue. Draco quailed, but now the Path spell had kicked in, and he could almost let it do the talking for him. “What you said. About it being your fault. You know that was bullshit, right? You didn’t get yourself imprisoned on purpose, and it was Dobby’s choice to rescue you. I was - I was the one who stood by and did
” she spat, and for a fleeting instant Draco was bound hand and foot with his uncle over him, but in reality the ropes had fallen at his feet and vanished.
Draco snorted. “Yes. My mother was a Black, Potter. As the last remaining male of the Black line, if my cousin had died without a will,
Draco stopped struggling. He was only making himself look more pathetic. He settled for sitting up and using one hand to try and persuade his rigid calf muscle to relax. He glared at the wet grass between his knees, steadfastly ignoring Potter standing over him, and blinking several times to clear his eyes of the tears that the pain had forced to the surface.
It’s completely fair. I owe you, Potter, and not just for the life-debts. I’ve been shitty to you since the first time we met and this is the way I’m atoning. This is my punishment, don’t you get it? I’m not going to Azkaban. This is what I’m doing instead. So if it sucks sometimes, then good. That’s how it should be. That’s fair.”
The marble continued inside, on both the walls and floor. Directly in front of him a corridor continued deeper into the building, and to the side a muggle woman sat behind a long, high reception desk. She wore a bright pink blouse which matched her bright pink lipstick, and seemed to be only a few years older than Draco. For a second, they both looked at each other without saying anything. The woman seemed a bit surprised at his appearance, and was not nearly as good as the taxi driver at hiding it. Draco shifted uneasily - he knew wearing the cloak had been a mistake.
He swallowed, remembering his latest magical vision. He’d never thought - it would never have occurred to him that he had succeeded in doing what he’d been trying to do all those years: make Potter feel small. But apparently he had managed that without even trying, from the moment he had started talking in Madam Malkin’s. He hadn’t realised it was Potter at the time of course, and if pressed, he wouldn’t have been able to recall anything he’d said. He had been making polite conversation; that was all it took. Just naturally obnoxious, he supposed.
He concentrated on each movement, dividing the task of standing into parts that were small enough to face. Getting up off the floor had never felt so complicated, and it probably took him a full five minutes, but by heavily relying on his hands and right leg, he managed it. He didn’t bother trying his left leg, he knew full well that it couldn’t support his weight. He used it as little as possible and half-hopped over the stone to the door.
Some of the habitual hardness returned to McGonagall’s face. Good. “Believe me, Malfoy, if we could evict Peeves it would have been done about eight hundred years ago. After Potter and I had our little chat with him, though, I think he does understand that he’s crossed a line. Still, we cannot rely on it. I’m afraid you must leave the school for a while for your own safety, Malfoy. In a few months Peeves will have forgotten his crusade, especially when the school gets back to normal. He is the kind of creature who lives in the moment. So, I am confident that you will be able to return and complete your NEWTs.”
Potter goggled at him. To his credit, it was only for one second, before he blinked, stuffed his hands in his pockets, sat down on Draco’s trunk, and clearly put effort into biting back several replies.
The elf looked at him, her big brown eyes hooded by sagging eyelids. Her tanned skin was as wrinkly as a walnut, and her remaining hair was just wisps of white sticking straight up from her head. She wore a tiny version of what was unmistakably simple black wizarding robes; she was a free elf.
your apology. After everything you’ve done for me, it’ll just make me feel worse.” Potter glowered. “Look, Potter, she’s just disappointed that I didn’t end up haunting her bathroom with her forever, don’t worry about it.”
So what if Severus had lied to him his whole life? Draco didn’t care. Snape was dead now, in any case, so it didn’t matter, did it? It didn’t.
He nodded to her when the pain had passed, and they made towards the large wooden door leading to the drawing room, Draco limping as quietly as he could behind Prudy. He found that if he barely pressed the sole of his left foot to the floor while putting most of his weight on the cane and moving his right foot as quickly as possible, he could manage to avoid triggering a full cramp in his leg. It still throbbed with every step though, and the carpet did little to muffle the clunk of his cane hitting the stone floor in the stillness.
I couldn’t haunt him a little bit? Like I did with the Hornby bitch? You know I would do it for you, Draco…”
I’d have reached out to Dumbledore and asked for his protection instead of trying to kill him. But your parents influenced you on those things too. The bullying and prejudice
His father lifted his chin, and for a moment looked as regal as he once had. “You have already made me proud, Draco. And I am sorry for - for all the ways I have failed you. I know you will be a better man than me.”
Winky popped in to leave his packed trunk at the foot of his bed. Draco was surprised when she took a second to hop up onto the bed and tell him, in her squeaky voice, that she was sorry he had been hurt and happy that he had survived. McGonagall visited briefly after breakfast to say thank you for his offer of making more healing potions, and add a package of ingredients to his trunk. At midday, he was finally allowed to move, and Madam Pomfrey helped him get changed out of his hospital gown and into his own clothes. He wore a dark blue casual robe, no school uniform for him any more. Potter arrived around mid-afternoon to take him away.
Draco shut his mouth and drew one deep breath. There had to be fewer than five minutes left before the start of the ceremony. For a moment, he could see Pansy in front of him in the Slytherin common room, only minutes to go before their first class of the day, asking him to cast the spells for her because she was too lazy and hungover to do them herself. The wand movements suddenly felt easy and familiar under his hand.
“Yes, I’m fine,” Draco said, acting on pure social reflex, before he even registered that these would be the first words he had ever spoken to a muggle.
“Oh - of course, dear.” Her tone was much warmer than he expected. He glanced at her and she smiled at him, and he thought it was just possible that she hated him a little bit less than before.
He lifted his head and pushed the parchment onwards to his father. His mother had seen what he had written, and gave him a look full of quiet concern and sympathy. She reached back under the table and squeezed his hand.
“Yes, I said elf magic,” Draco snapped. He was caught off-guard by a flare of panic, but stayed aloof thanks to long practice. “I’ll answer your questions. But not until you get rid of
For a second, Draco wondered how Prudy could possibly already know that he was now Lord Malfoy, but there was no accounting for the way house-elf magic worked.
At least it took less time to convince himself of that than it did during one of his normal attacks. Maybe that was because the flashback dream had shown him such an explicit threat, and so all he had to do was get his brain to remember that that threat wasn’t actually real right now. In his normal attacks, there was nothing specific to point to, just an overwhelming sense of doom. Still, it was a full ten minutes before he felt sure that his body and mind were back under his own control.
He tested himself by lifting his head from his knees and looking at the fire. It was just the familiar common room fire, friendly and warming. He breathed a sigh of relief. At least he didn’t have a phobia to deal with on top of everything else.
Draco managed to draw level with them, but before he could register more than that his estranged aunt looked unnervingly like his dead one, they both turned and walked through the gap between the two granite boulders. The path was dusty but quite level, and easier to navigate than the grass. Draco managed to keep up, making an invisible third in line as the path narrowed.
“Merlin, Harry, I don’t care about that. I’m just not sure why you’d prefer wandering around some godforsaken forest all morning looking for this old thing, all for the benefit of a pasty Death Eater, mind you, instead of popping over to the Burrow and asking your friends for help.”
Draco laughed. “That explains a lot, honestly. I’ve never seen a person more motivated to get good grades than Granger, but apparently she just had different priorities than the rest of us.”
His eyes were immediately drawn to something shifting in the darkness at the far end of the corridor - the dust coiling upwards, forming a shape, a man’s shape -
“You didn’t kill Dumbledore. Technically, Snape did, but it was at Dumbledore’s request. Merlin, that night
The Gryffindor Lavender Brown. Draco remembered her inane giggle, could see her defiant, pretty face.
” wand held sideways with a smooth pull downwards, and Potter’s robes no longer looked rumpled and slept-in.
This time, Draco found himself looking into an oak wood, dusky sunlight falling softly onto the summer leaves. The ancestral grove.
He finally got himself settled at the tiny dining table. The whole process had taken him much longer than it should - even bending over his truck had been difficult on one leg, with the crutches balanced against its side and then sliding to the floor with a clatter. He was breathing fast from the effort and frustration, and he had to try quite hard not to let his breathing get even faster.
“I’ll send Bill Weasley over, I know he’d be happy to help. Tell me as soon as he’s finished and I’ll arrange the ceremony to set up the new Fidelius. In the meantime, stay alert - I doubt it would occur to the remaining Death Eaters to risk turning up there, but you never know. Some of them may be specifically hoping to get their revenge on you, or to claim the Elder Wand.”
He broke out of his reverie slightly when the receptionist abruptly got up and walked down the corridor. He hadn’t realised his breathing had gotten so loud. Oh Merlin, she had watched him coming apart at the seams, he hadn’t hid it at all, and now she was going to warn Anne Liston about what a mess he was. He had to get out of here, quickly, before she came back -
Potter laughed. “A bit of both, probably. She’s come a long way, but I’m pretty sure Hermione still believes deep down that it’s worse to get expelled than killed.”
The rest of the appointment went as smoothly as could be reasonably hoped for. There was a dicey moment when Draco was lying face down on that narrow bed and Anne Liston touched his calf for the first time. Draco tensed up, expecting the cramps to start, but it was clear this healer knew what she was doing. The massage hurt - quite a lot, when she dug her fingers into the missing flesh - but not nearly as badly as the cramps did. And afterwards, Draco could tell that the muscle felt slightly looser somehow.
At half one, Draco couldn’t take it any more. He heaved himself up off the bed, gripped his crutches with clammy palms, and began to get ready to leave. He counted the muggle money that Potter had left him (of course, Draco had paid him back in galleons, and had even erred on the generous side as neither of them had been sure about the exchange rate). He carefully transferred the strange coins and flimsy scraps to his money pouch. He tied the money pouch to one of the denim belt loops, wishing he could wear a robe like normal, because the pouch did look a little ridiculous bouncing against his hip.
He hopped to the centre of the stretch of wall, leant up closer against it and whispered, “Destiny.”
must not. I put us all on the losing side of this war, and I will not have you paying for my mistakes. You are the future of the house of Malfoy. We all must do whatever it takes to reduce your punishment and have you reestablished into society. You must find a way for the family to recover from this disgrace.”
With an effort Draco released his death-grip on the crutch. The Old Magic stopped making his body vibrate.
“Thank Merlin,” Draco said, draining it. The water helped, but not enough - the heat still prickled his tongue.
Draco had just finished an awkward meal (lying flat on one’s back while eating a sandwich was not very comfortable or dignified) when the first of his visitors arrived. It was Potter. He was panting as if he’d run all the way there.
Dressing himself brought yet another first: a muggle T-shirt and jeans. Weasley had left them in the drawer under one of the bunk beds, and they fit relatively well. Draco felt quite strange wearing the outfit, but he couldn’t decide if it was weirder to be wearing muggle clothing or to be wearing something of Weasley’s. Ah well, at least the clothes were comfortable, and Potter assured him that they would be more appropriate than wearing the shirt and trousers from his school uniform. Naturally, Potter had also ruled out any of the robes packed in his trunk, even the casual ones.
“Oh, right, of course. Well, there are loads of empty rooms, you can just pick one, and I’m sure they’ll let you take the ingredients you need from the school supplies.”
Potter smiled at him. Draco stared. It was definitely the first time Potter had looked at him like that - like he could almost be glad to see him.
Draco felt the air leave his lungs in a rush, as if he’d been winded. Potter looked a bit surprised himself, in fact. Draco automatically grasped for some sort of scathing comeback, but he couldn’t actually speak. He supposed that he shouldn’t feel
He was sure he was about to get hexed, but then the patronus spoke, in Granger’s voice, and Potter wheeled around to face that instead.
Potter reached for his right arm as the female Auror reached for his left. And once again, their hands couldn’t get within a foot of him.
Draco swallowed forcefully. She was sitting so close. He wanted to shut his eyes to avoid her earnest look, but that would be cowardly. Shit, he really didn’t want to do this.
Draco reared back as a multitude of thick ropes flew towards him, but just as before, the ropes hit an invisible barrier a foot from his face, and fell to the floor between the beds. Draco stared down at the tangle for a moment until the ropes faded out of existence, then raised his head slowly, expression as hard as he could make it.
Potter sat with his head bowed for several moments, before heaving himself upright. He started walking towards the door, moving as if his feet suddenly weighed more than usual. Draco could just let him go, he didn’t
Draco could no longer see. His vision was clouded with red splotches, fading to black, and he felt himself fall off the bench. The last thing he was aware of was the weight of the old magic settling into his bones.
Potter started tugging at a string around his neck, extracting a pouch from under his robes - the pouch that held Draco’s wand. For one wild moment Draco thought that Potter might be about to give it back, but instead Potter started pulling what seemed like acres of silvery material from out of the small pouch.
“The Ministry are nearly finished with rounding up the others. They will remember us soon. We must prepare for our arrests.”
he had lots of time, but he couldn’t stop himself glancing at his Malfoy pocket watch every twenty seconds. He was glad he had had such a plain breakfast: he felt nauseous with nerves.
Potter frowned as he read, his lips pressed tight together. Draco felt himself deflate a bit as he waited, and he fidgeted with his shirt cuff. He hadn’t meant to show that list to anyone, least of all Potter, and he fought the impulse to snatch it back.
Faces were transformed by the light, becoming softer and more sympathetic. Even the looming hugeness of Hagrid away on the left seemed less rough -
He told himself to stop wallowing in self-pity. For Gods’ sake - if it hadn’t been for the old magic, he would have been in a far worse state than this. He had never known the woodcraft could be so powerful. Or so vicious.
His breath hitched. He wrapped his arms round his chest, feeling cold, and was not altogether surprised to find he was shaking. He held tight as his breath sped up and his heart raced and the walls of his cell closed in, and he waited as patiently as he could through the endless minutes of terror until he didn’t feel so certain that he was about to die.
Potter grimaced. Draco was beginning to have second thoughts about putting himself so close to the line of fire, but he wasn’t going to back out now.
This woman truly did have a natural air of authority. For a strange moment, Draco felt as if he was in the presence of his mother. To his surprise, he discovered that he would rather lie down on the bed than humiliate himself with a silly tantrum. So, with a heave and a hop that was becoming more practised every time, he got up onto his crutches and followed her across the room.
His chest seemed much the same, nothing new amongst the mess of old Sectumsempra scars. He drew his knees up, and suddenly hissed in pain as the muscles of his left calf spasmed.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco said, playing up his accent for old times’ sake. He was pleased to note that speaking was significantly less painful now that he’d slept a little. “What do you want?”
After a couple of minutes, she looked up again. “Right, well, the diagnosis is very simple, as I’m sure you’ve figured out: the muscle remaining in your leg isn’t strong enough to take your weight. I also suspect that the muscle underneath the regrown skin has formed its own scar tissue, which is preventing the remaining muscle fibres from contracting and moving over each other as freely as they should. How much do you know about the way muscles work?”
“Well, fear not, Potter, I’m an expert. I have constructed quite a routine in the last year. Although only at school, of course, and a bit less on week-nights.”
understands that the battle is finished and that we don’t need him to defend the castle anymore. And thirdly, he knows not to mess with my hospital wing.” Madam Pomfrey crossed her arms with a glower and for a moment Draco could almost see her magic crackling around her.
Prudy gaped at her grandmother. Then she started twisting her right ear painfully in her hand, her eyes darting to Draco, clearly torn between disappointing him and defying Frona.
So much for retaining the element of surprise. “I want to brew more healing potions for Pomfrey. I imagine it will take a while before the professional apothecaries will be able to catch up with the demand for healing potions from St. Mungo’s, and it would be good to get the Hospital Wing’s stash fully restocked as soon as possible.”
It was difficult, though, to force himself to press hard enough into his skin with the metal. It took him a few moments longer than it had for his father, and when he managed it, he couldn’t suppress a small hiss of pain. He felt the blood start to pool, wet and hot, along his hand and down onto the floor.
Draco looked away and met Potter’s eyes, and Draco was surprised to see his own powerless anguish so perfectly matched. Potter stood up and brought his chair round to the right side of the bed, where he reached forward to rest his hand on Prudy’s shoulder. His fingers brushed Draco’s, but Draco wasn’t going to stop rubbing her back.
Draco blinked. The scratchy handwriting was unrefined, but perfectly legible. Still, Draco doubted that he read that third sentence correctly. Why would Potter tell him what the questions were going to be about? He felt pretty sure that a fundamental principle of interrogation was to
Draco winced. At least his memory of the aftermath of the attack involved a general impression of shattered agony, rather than anything specific.
Potter looked down at the firewhiskey in his hand as if a bit surprised to see it there. “I guess that kind of is my intention. I’ve never actually done it before, though.”
Potter followed his lead, placing the tumblers down on the hearth and tucking his blankets around him in a much more haphazard fashion than Draco.
Prudy still wore the faded pillow-case that she had worn as the Malfoy house-elf, but over that, in an odd contrast, she wore Draco’s own dark purple satin waistcoat. It was big enough on her to look like a tunic-dress, and Draco thought that it must have been tied up somehow at the back to prevent it from slipping off her frail shoulders.
He looked over to his left, past Potter, and watched as his aunt (still peculiar to think that was who she was) closed her eyes for a moment, grief clearly etched in the tight press of her lips. Then she lifted her wand to her throat, cast a
“Mr Malfoy will be well enough to be moved by this time tomorrow,” said Madam Pomfrey, “and in the meantime the Baron will continue to stand guard.” She nodded up at where the ghost still floated, bobbing ever so slightly up and down. He returned Pomfrey’s nod, impassive.
“Excellent. I am glad that is sorted out. Now, I have some questions regarding this spell you are currently under, Lord Malfoy. Harry tells me that it is called the Path of the Penitent? I confess, I had never even heard of it, and my assistants have been unable to find mention of it.”
Draco jerked his head round, ignoring Madam Pomfrey’s admonition at the movement. Potter’s light brown cheeks were flushing darker. McGonagall was also looking at him with raised eyebrows.
Draco pressed his lips together, hard, to stop his eyes from prickling. He fixed his father with a blazing look. “I will make you proud, father. I will not forget you. I will follow the old ways.”
A very bare, high, narrow bed, with some kind of thin blue mattress and only parchment for a covering, sat in the middle of the room, and Draco immediately wanted to leave - he didn’t want to lie on that thing while this muggle stood over him, touching him. He came to a halt only a step or two past the door and held his crutches tightly. That’s right; she couldn’t do anything to him. If she tried to, then he could grow a murder tree right out of her floorboards, see if he wouldn’t.
Her stern expression was back. “Yes, Mr Malfoy, I do. I know a very good muggle practitioner to whom I have referred you.”
By the time they finished, Draco’s lungs ached fiercely, but he refused to show his discomfort. He was quietly grateful when Madam Pomfrey set a small phial of pain-relief potion on his bedside table.
don’t even know what I was thinking wearing my cloak, apart from being constitutionally unable to stand the thought of wearing that Cannons sweater.”
“We have to stop meeting like this,” he muttered at the ceiling, then winced. His throat felt like it was coated in sand. The back of his head throbbed and his left leg ached. This time there were no house-elves around to heal him, and somehow it seemed as though he had been bruised everywhere.
Draco finally got a chance to look around. They were on a scrappy, litter-strewn square of grass, surrounded on all sides by a muggle road lined with more cars than Draco had ever really seen gathered in one place before, and a ring of dingy-looking tall town-houses beyond that. Potter had apparated them into the shade of an anaemic beech tree. Draco could spot at least two broken windows just in the houses nearest to them. He wrinkled his nose.
And then Potter had said that someone had taken the Elder Wand from Dumbledore before he died, and the shock of realisation had hit him like a fist to the gut moments before Potter said it:
Although apparently there was still plenty of guilt left to go round. Unbidden, an image of William Weasley’s scarred face came to mind. If maiming someone for life wasn’t bad enough to merit a spot on his top-seven list of people he’d wronged, what the hell was? What had he done that was
She blinked her large, frightened eyes at him and wrung her hands in a familiar gesture of distress.
The strike, the spells, the Dark Lord crumpling: in those final moments, for the first time in forever, Draco felt no fear. Potter’s hand snatching the Elder Wand from the air felt perfect and inevitable. Even the final tearing stab of agony from his Dark Mark couldn’t dim his elation.
. As promised, the questioning never strayed towards Draco’s parents, and Shacklebolt seemed to trust that Draco was answering honestly.
What the hell had Potter been doing with those Aurors, anyway? It had been all of a day since the battle, and they had already dragged Potter out again to start rounding up the left over Death Eaters? He remembered how exhausted Potter had looked sitting on that bench in the Great Hall. Surely the merciful Muggle-lovers could give their hero a proper chance to rest?
He finished the ‘Y’ with a tasteful flourish and sat back, considering what format was most logical. He decided on a table, and wrote two column headings:
on Carrow. That one wasn’t even life-or-death. He spat in Professor McGonagall’s face, and I was angry. And I don’t feel anywhere near as guilty for that as I do about cutting you open that time, and
“As I thought. Okay.” She span around in her chair and indicated a poster up on the wall behind her, showing various grisly medical diagrams of what parts of a person might look like without any skin. “So, muscles are formed from thousands of these long, rope-like bundles of muscle cells, and
At that, Potter tipped his head back and lost himself in proper laughter. The sound was too infectious to withstand. Draco felt an unwilling grin creep onto his face.
The only thing he could think of was Potter - if Potter demanded an explanation from him, he suspected that would override the compulsion towards Hagrid. But he was invisible, with every muscle locked against the pull to move. Potter had no reason right now to give him a second thought.
“She’s - she was your cousin, Draco. Family. You should get the chance to say goodbye. And you did say you’d come.”
Potter was now bringing out little flat boxes from the bag with a rustle. Draco struggled out from his nest and hopped over to a seat, cracking the lid off one of the boxes curiously.
Draco couldn’t really understand what the man was talking about. He was too busy staring through the glass in front of them. They seemed to be
Madam Pomfrey’s affront melted into a frown at his obvious terror, and she turned, being far too obvious as she did so, to see what he was looking at.
, in front of my aunt, all of them… Fuck, she could have been caught out so easily. One stray twitch from you… I - look, I know my parents love me, but they’re not exactly demonstrative about it, and lately they’ve not done the best job of keeping me safe. Knowing she did this - well, it feels amazing, frankly. My father - he admitted he put us in harm’s way, he even
Draco felt himself being lowered gently onto some kind of surface - an upturned part of the branch lattice.
Potter stood up and collected their empty mugs, casting a lazy cleaning charm over them and putting them back in the cabinet. “Anyway. I should be getting back to help Bill. I’ll come back later and fix this place up a bit more, I know it’s a dump. Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer a hotel?”
“Grimmauld Place does have some security issues,” said Shacklebolt. “I’m afraid that the Death Eaters gained access to the house at some point during the last year.”
He only realised that he had distracted himself quite nicely with his internal ranting when the taxi drew up right in front of him. It was large and shiny-black and conveniently had ‘taxi’ written in a small glowing orange sign at the front of the roof. He had never been so close to a moving car and he nearly lost his balance as he jumped backwards, triggering a spasm in his leg when he landed awkwardly. He hissed and squeezed his eyes shut as he waited for the pain to pass.
Which was a good thing, because he needed to stay objective for this. Perhaps if he treated it as if it was a piece of homework… He smirked slightly at the thought. Well, why not?
“Yep. This is only the British takeaway version of Indian food, though; I expect it’s a bit different in India itself. One thing I do know is that it’s supposed to be really spicy…”
“Yes, sir.” Draco flushed, and didn’t look at Potter. He felt a ridiculous flicker of guilt for not making Potter aware of his opportunity to choose a task to ask of him. Which was stupid. It had been a sound tactical decision at the time. The way that it had back-fired on him so badly was his comeuppance for tricking him, he supposed.
Draco looked from his father to his mother, hoping to find her ready to help him talk some sense into Lucius. Instead she was nodding, her face grave.
She nodded and her whole face crumpled, her nose going even redder, the tears pouring down her cheeks. “Y-yes, Master M-Malfoy, but W-Winky is n-not knowing it until t-two days ago, sir!”
Potter held up the cloak in triumph and then threw it at Draco without ceremony. As Draco grabbed the elegant ripples of fabric out of the air, he suddenly knew what it was, and he was more dumbfounded than if Potter had decided to give him his wand back. Potter had said he would let him use it last night, but it was also clear that Potter had been so drunk at the time that he didn’t even remember that conversation.
“Oh, right, of course not. Sorry.” This whole conversation was bordering on ludicrous. “Potter, why are you being so - why did you tell me all that?”
Draco stared at her, feeling whatever hope he had had fold up into nothing in his chest. He knew his parents were right, but for an instant he allowed himself to wish, fiercely, that things were different. Then he forced himself to put that wish aside.
“I was there. I was under my invisibility cloak. We had just landed, and when we heard you coming up the stairs Dumbledore immobilised me. That’s how you could disarm him, there was only a second and he didn’t have time to deal with both me and you.”
, like he stood out more from the background than other people did. Draco could hardly be bothered to notice the Aurors behind him.
“He… he…” As an experiment, Draco tried pressing his lips together to stop himself from talking. It wasn’t going to work - it was like physically resisting someone much stronger pushing against his mind. “He tried to rape me.”
Draco kept his eyes closed and managed to gradually calm his breathing. He could still feel the terror swilling around inside him, but it was muted for now. He opened his eyes again as Madam Pomfrey resumed talking.
Draco frowned at his father. Lucius looked back at him, his puffy face almost kind. Draco swallowed past a lump in his throat. “I’m never going to see you again, am I?”
Draco choked on a cry and stumbled back, slamming himself into the bodies behind him. He had to get out, get away, but Dumbledore was far too powerful, he would kill Draco, he was nearly upon him -
