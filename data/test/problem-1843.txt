“I would have agreed with you just yesterday, Professor Malfoy,” said Pomfrey. “Adrenaline and fear, however, can do wondrous things with magic.”
“I plan to,” Harry bit out.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?”
“We need to find a way to get in front of the Muggles again,” said Millicent. “We need visibility.”
Hermione smirked. “I doubt I’ll live to see that.”
The progression of pleasure curling inside him is so subtle that he isn’t aware of anything more than Draco’s mouth on his until he’s about to come. He cries out, scrunching his eyes together and Draco trails his lips up his jaw, nips at his ear. “You’re close.”
Determinedly, he pulled his eyes back up to Draco’s face. One would think they would have realised they could turn their faces enough to lay their chins on one another’s shoulders instead of staring right at one another, but Draco hadn’t, and Harry wasn’t stupid enough to give up this position, so he didn’t.
“I know,” Harry whispered back.
Harry’s eyes narrowed, but he refused to give Draco the satisfaction of commenting. “How do you suggest I even do that?”
Harry’s life continued. It didn’t continue in any manner that he’d previously anticipated, but it did continue. Really, that was more than he would’ve expected at one point, and so while he dearly missed his life in Gryffindor, he accepted Hufflepuff as a fate better than eternity in a train station with Dumbledore.
“That would be lovely, wouldn’t it?” said Luna.
“My theory is that the—love—could be… redistributed. Towards people you actually want to be in love with.”
Draco caught his hand on one angry pass, and for a moment, Harry’s heart sped up with hope, but no. Draco was just handing him the Portkey.
And Malfoy was wrong. Harry didn’t want
Draco wished the earth would open up to swallow him whole. It would be a fitting end for this travesty of childhood dreams coming true. At this point, he daren’t open his mouth and risk being lumped together with the rest of the British idiots. From a remove, he watched his chances of studying this culture firsthand disappear into a void, as if Banished.
Harry nodded. “What did you think?”
“Oh, right,” Hermione said, frowning.
‘just fucked’ look. Maybe he should ask all of his models to go out and have a shag after Rehearsal…
, Harry says.
It was just that Draco’s crooked smirk undid him completely.
“Draco, darling,” Mum said, sweeping over to him and giving him the same two kisses.
Muggles had the internet, after all, and Draco had spent enough time in Muggleland to know the internet never forgot.
“Taking Teddy to the train!” Harry said, furious. “You knew I was doing this. I put in for the time off last month!”
Which Harry thought was uncalled for. He’d had an earful of the ‘Christ-figure’ pet theories from Hermione after the war, when she’d had a few months to digest his death and resurrection, plus, he supposed, all the years of suffering. Merlin, he was already going delirious. Was their oxygen depleting faster than the charm could filter fresh air in? Were they back in the dead zone where it couldn’t?
Draco says.
She laughed fully this time. “You are truly dead then? I had thought you merely projected your eyesight to attend this meeting. Yes, Severus Snape. Our entire collection is painted into a framed mural in the library, and you can find it if you have a frame hanging on one of the library walls.”
“You look good in my clothes.”
Harry doesn’t know why. He thinks maybe it’s because neither of them wanted to admit it was over, and so they never let it be, and so they’ve been stuck like this ever since. Unable to move on. Unable to want to.
Harry’s head echoed with a wordless sound of excitement. “The
He took a deep breath. There would only be two eliminations tonight, but it still wasn’t easy. “The first one goes to Titus.” Because he’d so enjoyed their flirty conversation over gyros. He handed Snitches out to Socorro, Dune, Zeph, Michael, and Ruby. When there was just three people left—Hermione, Finian, and Harry Henry—Harry knew that everything Luna’d said, all her whacko wisdom was about to go right out of the window.
“You little slut,” Harry whispered, grinning.
Whatever the reason, it’s getting late, and he should probably pack some things. Maybe lots of things. He doesn’t know how long he’ll be there. His travel visa allows for six months. Will it take six months to convince Malfoy he needs Harry like Harry needs him? Malfoy’s stubborn sometimes. Maybe he should pack up his whole house.
Why hadn’t she woken him up? Eyes narrowed, Harry took the stairs two at a time to the bottom and hopped off.
“Even normal cats are good at that sort of thing,” said Harry, dubiously.
“Severus said to let him out,” said Malfoy. There was a muffled yell from Harry’s satchel.
“Fuck, Malfoy it’s always about the prize money with you, isn’t it?” Harry said. He picked up Malfoy’s shirt, the same shirt that, coming off, had completely undone Harry. He threw it at him.
“Obviously,” Malfoy drawled.
In the eighth year common room, Hermione was reading another letter from Ron with a distracted frown on her face. She looked up when he entered, and her expression changed to exasperated. “How does one handle post-relationship friendship with a Weasley?” she asked. “I’m sure I’ve no idea how it’s done.”
“Fuck, I wish we could’ve finished our press conference,” Harry said. “Asked for volunteers then and waited to see if any of those reporters’ viewers had information on abductions.”
He turned to Minerva, as if she must surely have known the answer, being a witch in charge.
file.
. He’s
, the words fade as his wand trails off, sinking downward with Harry’s indecision. Harry presses his lips together and writes,
No one disagreed. Professor Sprout smiled tiredly. “Alright then. Everyone take a sample and run a full diagnostic. We got a list of chemicals from my colleagues at Oxbridge, but we need a magical analysis, too.”
Harry nodded. He knew. “We can’t tell anyone.”
, Harry thought, smirking.
“So we can count on your support then,” called the assistant to the Mugwump, lingering by the door. “When can we expect Atlantis to raise the wards again?”
She was being distant and bossy. She always did that when she was upset. It was Day Four of her divorce.
“No, I feel…exposed,” Harry said. “Really antsy. I just want to grab Al and go hide in a bunker somewhere most days.”
Their Portkey landed with such force that his feet sank into the wet sand. This was not modern magic—it achieved the same result as modern magic did, but worked in a fundamentally different way. Somehow more primal and closer to the earth than the magic they used in Portkeys these days. He wished he had time to study it more.
But it was just Draco, leaning back against a disused pylon. The last point was at an airport in North Bend. Draco unfolded and came towards him.
Justin and Wayne hurriedly moved the power line poles back where they’d come from, and everyone took up their port-keys. Flashing lights came around the bend, the Muggles’ sirens wailing in the silence.
know him better than he knew himself. And her note was so long that he didn’t bother to finish reading it, but he did save it so he could show it to Ron later and smirk.
Draco scowled. “Don’t get testy with me, Potter. That I had to do it at all was your fault. If you hadn’t got me all worked up by being a prick to the goblins yet again then we wouldn’t have found ourselves in such a revealing position. Also, you didn’t lock the door.”
It still smelled like him, Draco thought as they entered. That same herbal mix that had always reminded Draco of the digestive bitters his parents served after dinner parties. As if Draco’s godfather had just been here, breathed in, and breathed himself out into the room.
Hermione sighed and tapped her finger against his teacup to warm it up again. She had never bothered to learn wandless defense or offense spells, but put a cold cup of tea in front of her and the indignation alone could inspire her magic to fix it.
“Aunt Wally,” Draco whispered, “There are some lovely portraits here. Potter and I want to look, too.”
Draco was thoughtful. He took Harry’s hand again, their gloves distorting the feeling of Draco’s long fingers entwined with Harry’s own, but enough of a comfort nonetheless. Harry wondered what would happen after school – if this nightmare would be over by then, if Draco’s parents would pitch a fit if they found out he and Harry were kind of sort of dating. They walked some distance further without speaking, and then Draco said, “I hate this."
. All that silvery-blond hair and those sharp features. Harry already has inspiration for his next winter line and it’s Draco Malfoy’s sodding cheekbones. He sketches up a new breed of geometric parkas in his head, mentally putting Malfoy in all of them, watching him strut towards him with that aloof-middle-distance gaze, pause, pivot, walk away.
Draco looks like magic. Like the epitome of it, whatever that means. He looks like electricity could go out all over the world, and Draco would bring in enough light to see him from space. Draco is so vibrant and alive that surely even Muggles could see the aura he gives off, but are so overwhelmed by it that they give it names like St Elmo’s Fire and Aurora Borealis. From great distances, Draco’s felt even there.
“Are you sure it’s…real?” asked Harry, uncomfortably. “I mean, not a hoax?”
“When you return, do remember that you will begin the second phase of your apprenticeships, and the rigour of your studies will increase significantly. You will begin teaching the first year classes of your chosen subject, under supervision. You will be evaluated at the end of the Eostre term on your knowledge of the subject and the students’ success in your class. This is on top of your requirements for meeting your Master’s prescribed curriculum and satisfactorily completing your inter-subject project. This is, I will be frank, the time when most apprentices decide that they are unsuited to a lifetime of academia. If you make it through next term, I have every confidence that you can achieve your Mastery. But do not take this holiday as a chance to slack off. Use it to get as far ahead on your studies as you feasibly can. You will sorely regret it if you don’t.”
He’s tired and hungry and tonight he’s got to watch Malfoy fly in on a Thestral in a dressing gown and little else. He can hardly function as it is when Malfoy's around, and for some reason he’s decided to make it worse by putting him in his sexiest designs of the season. Why does he do this to himself? It’s not the first time, and, if Harry's honest with himself, it won’t be the last. There’s always been something about Malfoy that makes Harry’s common sense fly out the window.
Draco followed him into Lucius’s study, took a seat on the warm leather couch, sighing a bit at how happily full he was. His father stopped at the sideboard and poured them both a finger of scotch. Draco lifted an eyebrow. A bit early for all that.
Harry gave him a pointed look.
“Well, you better be prepared to have a very frank discussion with Ron if you pick Hermione,” said Dennis.
“And sulphur?” asked Snape.
“No, I’m fine,” said Millicent. “I punched it, and it was fine.”
“Yes,” she said after a long moment. “My nephew.”
Malfoy grimaced, took another drink from his Firewhisky. “But I will go back. I won’t give them the satisfaction of taking my property or my family magic.”
Harry tends to agree. “For the blonds,” he says. “But I liked the steel liner on that new brunet—Marco? You already did everyone else? I want to see them.”
She gave him a look like she was about to burst into tears and he wasn’t sure if he’d upset her or if maybe her hormones were still a little off-centre from having Rosie, or if she was happy crying—the latter, as it turned out, for she jumped up, wrapping her arms around his neck, and hugging him so tightly he gasped.
But its face. Draco couldn’t stop staring at it, looking for similarities, for differences, for the one feature that would make him understand how humans had come from these beings.
Astoria laughed. “Oh, I bet she did. Minerva’s forthright if she’s anything.” She sipped, apparently deciding to suffer through rather than return the tea for something less imaginative and risk being seen as impolite. “What was it like, Atlantis? Was it like the stories?”
A strange exception to the pure-blood rule: Malfoy took care to
Daphne Greengrass, now a Gryffindor, held up a photograph from last month’s
Harry cleared his throat. “Have you got any…erm, I don’t know. Fancy patterns? Or yarn? Or…something?”
“Of course,” said Ron. “She really just wanted the Aurors to know that there was something underhanded going on.”
Harry rolled back over, flat on his back. He had spent the first eleven years of his life without magic, the next nineteen years ensconced in it. He didn’t want to go back to that life before, what little of it could be called ‘life’.
It was, Draco thought, a singular representation of Atlantis itself: a beautiful piece of forgotten magic, trapped in time and space. The mechanics of the spell were formed around a metaphorical shield, but the shield itself was just that—a metaphor. It wasn’t a true ward in that it created a barrier between Atlantis and what was outside Atlantis. The barrier was time itself, woven in a net.
Draco sighed. “Fine. I... love you, too.” He cleared his throat quickly, glancing around to make sure no one else had heard, which was ridiculous because they were a ways out of town on top of a hill. “Now let me be a Slytherin. It’s been so long since I got to indulge.”
,” Harry burst out. “And I want you to want me in return...either because I turn you on, or because I...turn your
“Nevertheless, things happen when people who are attracted to one another are left alone in a room with a bed.”
Harry’s eyes snapped to Draco. They were still so big and grey and sparkly like that time they’d been underwater and Draco was going to drown. No! Harry didn’t want that to happen at all.
. “No, thanks.”
"Boys, I hate to interrupt..."
Draco’s head turned to him so quickly Harry winced in sympathy. “What do you mean?” said Draco.
“Hermione Granger,” Hermione said, offering her hand. “Magical Beings and Creatures expert.”
“Fuck, no,” Harry says before he can think better of it. He hears Draco choke next to him and panic rises in his chest before he can comprehend that he’s just swallowed his water wrong. Harry quickly pats him on the back and thinks, ‘Come on Potter, don’t accidentally kill your child, you moronic mouthpiece.’ Draco glares up at him, eyes watering as he gets his breathing back under control.
Potter’s mouth crumpled, and he shook his head. His eyes began to shine with wetness. “I don’t know. I have a plan, but it only helps us going forward. I don’t
Potter cracked one sleepy, green eye open and Draco immediately regretted his whole life. Why had he done that? He should’ve just let Potter sleep instead of forcing him to wake up and look at Draco with those unnatural eyes when Draco was really quite close to imploding like a poorly done Vanish.
There was a heavy silence.
Then his last model flies in. His best model. Malfoy circles the air on his black Thestral, descends, and dismounts gracefully, even as the Thestral maintains a murky-looking trot. He presses a hand to the beast’s shoulder and they walk together with the same sultry, watery stride. The Thestral lifts its wings and beats once—the wind doesn’t touch Malfoy’s hair, but the loose silk trousers flutter and he ignores it completely, a perfect model. He walks on, his feet disappearing into the foggy carpet of Amortentia. It flutters out as he walks through it and it looks like he’s walking on water. Harry would probably believe it at this point because he’s not entirely sure what Veelas are capable of.
Another round of laughter comes, and Harry freezes. He knows that laugh. Harry twitches his wand and nothing happens. Sighing, he refocuses and tries again. This time, the non-verbal Notice-Me-Not spreads over him and only then does he turn around.
been, and Ron
“Loser does the talking,” Harry says.
“No idea,” said Malfoy.
“No.” Harry clenched his fist beneath the table. “You’re my friend, you git. If we go back to—that—then of course I’m going to fall for you again. That’s what love is, stupid. Friends plus sex plus love.”
to upend it over his posh blond head, but the glass stayed where it was, didn’t even bother to give a shiver. He looked back at Draco, victorious, and then frowned again because there wasn’t really any victory in not being able to do wandless magic.
She frowned at the window, where a row of tiny specks on the sea’s horizon reminded all of them of the constant scrutiny of several Muggle militaries.
Harry flopped down beside him. He ached to throw an arm around his chest, pull him close, and fall asleep, but he was terrified, so he didn’t. He kept four inches between them, and tried not to look like a creeper by watching Draco’s face as he came down.
Harry tried not to make a face. For a moment, he’d worried about a Slytherin being around to get all his humiliation on camera, and then he remembered that it didn’t matter who was filming it, everyone was going to watch it on one of those damned magicboxes anyway. “Hullo,” he said.
“God, so bitchy,” Demelza says.
Draco moaned and arched into the touch, his mouth pulling away from Harry’s to gasp for more breath.
Harry flushed hard. “Malfoy,” he admitted. His face was burning, and not from the sun.
“Since when are you anti-veg, Dudley?” Ginny, who was joining them as the official Ministry correspondent for the
The translators burst into speech, their voices soft and echoing.
Dudley nodded. “Good idea. If I can get her to accept it, anyway. She might think it was something only hippies use.”
“Potter!” McGonagall snapped, and as if under Imperio, Harry scurried up to the head table. McGonagall always was able to compel him to act right, he thought sourly.
“He touches me, and he murmurs, ‘There’s no one but you. There’s never been—’”
“Your mother’s sacrifice?” Ron asks. Harry nods. Ron exhales heavily. “That’s important, too. Just in a different way.”
“Draco, can we—”
Malfoy made quick work of a lubricating spell, and then his fingers were sliding deep inside Harry, making him arch with need. His cock was leaking all over his belly and though he yearned to touch it, he held back, knowing it was going to be so much better when Malfoy was finally inside him. He prepared Harry quickly, three slippery fingers working his tight hole open like he knew Harry’s body completely. Maybe one day he would, Harry thought dazedly. He let himself be rocked back and forth as Malfoy finger-fucked him open, and whined with need when the fingers disappeared.
“Do you think Malfoy’s Airbnb is nicer?” Lee asked, as they waited for someone to answer the door.
He wondered if maybe Hermione could do one of her botched memory charms on him, so that he could forget everything he loved about Draco Malfoy, and go back to just being his indifferent study and project partner. It wouldn’t change Draco, though, and inevitably, Harry’s luck being what it was, he would fall right back in love with the stupid git again. Then he’d ask Hermione for a memory charm. Then he’d fall in love. It would last the rest of his life.
Harry jumped, upsetting Severia’s nap. “Luna.”
The clock on the mantle said he had an hour and a half until he had to be back down in the common room in his best cloak... whatever the fuck that was for. But Harry was a Hufflepuff, and as a Hufflepuff, he was willing to go with the flow so long as it didn’t interfere with his social life or mores. Given he had no social life to speak of, and given that he could find no ethical dilemma in changing that up with another cocktail hour with his new housemates, this one apparently outside, he obliged.
“Already did,” Harry said. “And yeah, it’s true.”
Draco sat down at the big wooden worktable in the middle of the lab where Harry did all of his work that didn’t need special sterilization. It was, actually, the old kitchen table from Grimmauld, just cleaned up, and Harry liked having it in his lab because it toned down the stainless steel and made it feel a bit more lived-in. Harry bent and rummaged through his small (efficient) liquor cabinet for the half-finished bottle of Ogden’s Firewhisky.
“You may look afterwards, Draco,” she said. “Mr Potter, keep moving.”
“Interesting fact,” said Justin casually. “Lockhart was a Slytherin.”
“Never a better time to fix your liver than right after you’ve destroyed it,” Draco agreed. “And off we go. Drink up, Potter. And don’t fuck up this potion, because I’ll be wanting some as well.”
“It’s
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
-stressing.”
She quirked an eyebrow. “Malfoy.” Then, “Well—which potion was it?”
Dudley pulled out a bag of jerky and started eating.
“Yep,” says Harry, pleasant. He comes further in, not sure which side of the barrier he should choose, and in the end, goes for Hermione’s. It feels safer. Less hostile. He lays the book open on her desk, the pages already opened to the one he has in mind. Draco stands from his desk and approaches the shield, but doesn’t bother coming around.
“Kreacher will set this here,” he says, putting the scotch as far away from his master as servantly-possible. The crystal clinks against the silver tray atop the sideboard. “Would Master like for Kreacher to answer the Floo or is Master not—equal to receiving visitors at this time?”
“Mr Redfellow called this afternoon to tell me my application for a house-elf was approved,” Narcissa said. “Kaylen’s arriving tomorrow morning. I’ll have her make us a few batches of biscuits and finger sandwiches first thing.”
. It was
“I know!” Hermione wails, and hugs Harry even harder before launching herself off him and bending over the bed to—carefully—hug Draco as well. Draco stares at Harry in horror over her head, awkwardly patting her on the back and trying to keep Twin One from getting a face full of hair in the meantime.
“I’ve not even done so much as write an op ed,” Harry said, tiredly. He really should’ve kept his mouth shut. Now he was going to have to deal with both countries distrusting him. “I’ll say this: My best guess is that the current administration doesn't trust anyone with my magical power level who could defeat a dark lord, no matter how little such a person might care about their oliga—I’m sorry, I mean their republic. You know how it is.”
“I am not shy!” Draco said. He allowed the sheet to loosen, though he made sure it still maintained his decency.
Harry pushed back from the wooden worktable, tapped some flakes into Seabiscuit’s tank. Sometimes, he reckoned Seabiscuit would’ve been better off if he’d left him in the sea, tangled in all that kelp and practically buried under—
Harry scowled. “I’m not
The more he understood Malfoy, the more he understood Potions.
Just then, Scorpius sneaked out of his bedroom with a book in his hand. He popped up next to Draco on the oversized chair and, very importantly, handed him the book.
They relaxed slightly. “We got MACUSA approval for that,” said Padma.
Millicent thought this over. “When?”
Malfoy understood what he meant right away. “I’ve got Portkeys,” he said. “Illegal ones, but they’re untraceable. We’ll give them out to our friends and family before we do anything. Make sure they have a way to escape if things go…awry.”
And then, of course, the not-so dark things. Things like this. He’d known it was possible to make this ward permanent. But most wizards would never take on the burden.
“Ron?” he said, aghast.
on your trousers.”
This time, he really did leave.
it a problem now,” said Draco. “That shouldn’t be too hard.”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Funny.”
,” he said. “It’s an animal.”
Harry turned and gave her an annoyed look. She missed it because she was busy telling on him to an Auror. Her fingers flew across the screen of her mobile, no doubt being as verbose in text as she favoured in real life. Then, Harry’s mobile vibrated.
Draco made a tiny, vulnerable sound.
Where each Struggle prior to this had been lighthearted and even a little ridiculous, both of them looked entirely serious this time. The words they spoke this time were for only the two of them, inaudible to everyone else. Magic flared up suddenly behind them and Theo visibly tensed, but continued murmuring whatever words he was saying to Padma. She stared at him wide-eyed and silent as more and more flares of magic erupted around them.
Malfoy hmmed in a decidedly disbelieving manner. “Perhaps it’s a good thing you only took a bit of it.”
Narcissa’s hands were shaking. She was good at directing attention away from them, but Harry had known to look. He saw the tiny shivers she masked in straightening her hair, the larger tremble she hid by putting her hands on her hips when Draco said something opportunely controversial.
“It was in the sky,” said Dudley. There was an odd note in his voice.
to contend with. He might as well be under a love potion. If he just accepts it and moves on with his life he’ll be happier in the long run.
And yet:
Ron comes home. He always does. He’s got a special sort of domestic magic, made for warm hearths and big families, and a keen intuition when someone he loves needs him.
“Same,” said Hermione.
. He was making a point. We’re protecting our world. There’s a difference.”
Harry turns, gives Dennis a rare smile. He’s one of the only ones Harry will give a quote to. “Alright, Dennis?”
Harry eyed Hermione suspiciously. She was hardly ever that exuberant about anything these days.
Mitchell pulls two dolls from his robes and sets them on the floor by the door. Fields aims his wand and all three Unspeakables step back from the golems. He casts one spell and the area glows white for a moment. A wave of magic follows a microsecond later, resettling around their bodies like a Demiguise. Fields’ protective spells have a smell of fir and Harry’s stomach does a little twist, thinking of Malta and Draco and Christmas. Just a few more weeks.
“Good luck,” Harry says, smiling into his coffee cup.
“Ready.” Draco took his own Gillyweed and shoved it in his mouth, grimacing around the thick, sludgy feeling. The taste was so salty that it always made Harry want to sick up, but it was better than a Bubble-head Charm, and much more reliable.
Harry nuzzles his nose into Draco’s neck, inhaling the delicious masculine scent of him. “Yeah, babe. Anything you want. Just come down to the kitchen with me.”
Malfoy’s fingers curl around his sides, drawing him impossibly closer. Harry makes a low sound in his throat, a result of a decade of longing and desire and the realization that they could’ve had this ages ago and he doesn’t know why Malfoy never claimed him before. Harry
“Because overcharging you was a good way to pad my student storeroom budget.”
Their food arrived, and he busied himself cutting his steak and eating some. Draco did not look as though he’d let himself be distracted, as was in line with Harry’s luck. “Just didn’t want to bother. Queen Elizabeth would probably think I was a quail and shoot me.”
“Of course,” said Draco. “We paid both your ways into sex-ed summer camp next year. You’ll both be thirteen then, and that’s plenty old enough to start learning about the Auguries and the Bees. It’ll be a valuable learning experience.”
“That’s…remarkably shortsighted,” Harry said. Malfoy’s explanation was unsettling. There was something about it that just didn’t sit well with Harry, but he supposed that their worldviews had always been rather volatile when combined.
They obeyed. Emily went on to explain their different roles. Justin and Wayne were using a handy bit of magic moving the path of a nearby power line directly over the landfill. They would not be able to encircle it because it was far too large, and it was dangerous to get too close to the magic trap and the electrical lines anyway, so they would all line up along the southern edge, as it was the cardinal direction most auspicious for this particular ritual.
She was his favourite Slytherin, being the lead DADA instructor. On a base level, Harry felt they were very compatible. If only she weren’t shagging Dudley (gag) and Harry weren’t shagging…well, actually he didn’t have much of a preference, but he hadn’t shagged anyone since Justin Finch-Fletchley had broken it off with him. ‘Too dramatic,’ Justin had said. Fucking Hufflepuffs.
“Dumbledore never would’ve allowed this,” Ron said irritably. He stabbed his fork into a steak and kidney pie, splattering gravy across the table and barely missing Dean’s hand. “It’s outrageous!”
“You noticed that your balance has changed,” Snape observed.
“Give me a moment,” he says, perhaps to himself, but Draco hears it anyway.
Ron nods sagely. “He’s got the look of it.”
Apparently, not bad enough morning breath. At that point the door opened again, and Mill, Ginny, and Luna came in, all three eyeing Harry’s bed with thinly-disguised interest. Great.
“You’re not taking me with you, Potter,” said Blaise.
They’re so close to the shore, so very fucking close, but Harry’s vision is tunneling and his limbs are weak and he just…can’t. He shakes his head hard, trying to clear it. He kicks feebly, but they don’t advance any closer to the shore. He’s going to drop Draco if he doesn’t get him to land. Harry’s always thought he could do anything because he’s such a stubborn motherfucker. Mind over matter. Mind over magic. But right now, his mind isn’t clear enough to be over anything.
He ruffled Harry’s hair as he passed, and stopped short at by Draco, who’d only recently begun to untense. “What’s this, a new face! Happy Christmas—good heavens, you must be the Malfoy boy.”
Harry had not thought it would ever be so easy to relax with Draco Malfoy’s arm around him. Now that he knew it was, he didn't want it to ever stop.
“I’m not sure I have any,” Harry admitted.
Harry meets his eyes again, feeling his skin tighten with the uncomfortable crawl of dread. He’s an Auror, for fuck’s sake; it’s not like Lucius or Narcissa could do anything to him if he told them he’d knocked their son up...but the thing is, when the Malfoys find out, that means that the Weasleys will be shortly following. And what if they don’t like it? What if they can’t get past Draco’s past? What if they make him choose between them and Draco and his baby?
“What is it?” Draco asked when Potter had settled down, his face slowly returning to its normal colour.
“It’s good, isn’t it?” he said, grinning. It was possible he was still a little—rather a lot—drunk. And the kissing certainly hadn’t helped his mental faculties. “Perfect.”
“Since at least your trial,” Harry added, after a moment of warring with himself.
first names. She’d taught him just last year. And now he had to call her by her first name. Weird.
Harry and Hermione grimace at one another behind his back.
, Harry says.
Harry sighed, glanced back at Ron who was now sat next to Zabini and seemed to be gesturing wildly at the pitch. Zabini was nodding, unconcerned. “Why?” Harry finally asked. “Why Hufflepuff? Why not Ravenclaw? Why not Gryffindor?”
Coddler left them to grab Harry’s cloak and ring up the transaction, and then it was just the two of them again. Harry caught Draco’s eye in the mirror and held it. “I don’t regret that,” Harry said. “I bury my head in the sand. Or in a cauldron,” he added, remembering Draco’s version.
She gave him a tiny smile. Perhaps the only genuine one she’d ever directed at him. “I’ll help you. However I can.”
But he’d also grown used to carrying Snape; it was almost like Snape had become the parent checking for monsters under beds. In actuality, having Snape’s portrait around had no tangible benefit, but Harry felt, somehow, safer with him there after the explosion at Festival Fringe.
“Look how magnificent I am,” said Harry. “I defeated a dark wizard
“Shall we get this over with?” asked Potter, sliding one leg into yesterday’s trousers.
The invisible lump grumbled again.
She narrowed her eyes. “I did, in fact. It was last month when you and Ron were listening to the Arrows game on the wireless and you asked me why I was swabbing her cheek with a cotton bud.”
Ron considers. “I think that’s what you do to seal the bond, isn’t it? The Veela-Mate bond? That’s what Bill said, maybe. I’m not entirely sure and I usually ignore him anyway when he’s talking about sex. Give it a shot. Can’t hurt anything, right?”
He closed the lid, passed it back to his father, and they moved onto lighter subjects, but Draco couldn’t help wondering what else Lucius had heard at the Ministry during his community service hours. Stealing Ministry property was a very large risk to take for a man so close to the end of his sentence.
them instead of against them. He was used to feeling shitty things or feeling wonderful things in the moment they happened, and then returning to a pretty balanced baseline.
Hermione’s offered to remove them a dozen times but Marietta's learned that she can Charm them to say something different—even if she can’t Charm them away entirely—and she really doesn’t like to admit to Hermione that she can’t figure it out.
, he finished in his head. “You’re a good friend, Ron. Thanks for not booking me. How’ve you been, anyway?”
“I apologise, Neville,” he said right away, and they all relaxed.
“You didn’t even do anything,” Harry said, feeling wretched and abysmal, and that he should’ve done something to stop this travesty after the war, but Ginny’s pregnancy had come on so quickly—she’d been due nine months to the day after the end of the war. And then the...complications, and Harry had just not had the emotional stability to do more than show up for one day of trials, give his testimony for Draco and Narcissa, and return to Grimmauld Place, and Ginny. Ginny, who had taken to spending all her days stuffed up in the dreary library, staring out the window at London’s gloom and refusing to talk about anything. He’d never been so grateful to the Harpies for coming straight to the Burrow and asking after her directly.
godfather,” Harry says.
“It’s a different sort of decaying,” Harry said. “There’s different types of radioactive decay, but you could think of that kind like this—suppose you had a pureblood family—an element. It’s a pretty stable family. Christmas dinners with relatively no fighting, everyone’s got little heirs, no one’s causing a scandal. But then, one of the heirs, a proton, goes off and marries a muggleborn, and the heir is disinherited. The pureblood family tries to be a new element, an element that never needed that heir, but it did have that heir once, and it knows that someone’s missing.
“How many do you need?”
Suddenly, Malfoy twitched and was nearly out of his chair before his eyes even opened. He saw Harry and froze like a deer, slowly lowered himself back down.
Harry stares at him, and says (gasps, really), “Hello, boss.”
“What’s going on with…that?”
Lucius and Narcissa were waiting for them. Their postures changed at once upon spotting Harry. Narcissa took the first step forward, holding out her hand, and Lucius followed.
“Sorry!” Harry said.
Mrs Black pursed her lips and turned away.
There is a pause, silent, thoughtful. Apex’s head tilts. “You have spent weeks in your own misery, Unspeakable Potter. Has the—loss of my son truly become tangible in your magic now?”
Harry waved his hand at him, though it came out more like flopping. “You can see New York anytime. I want to see you now.”
Fleur took one look at him and made a face reminiscent of Narcissa Malfoy.
Still, the alien ignored her. She cast something red and sharp looking that left the alien shrieking and straining against its bonds.
“It’s grand,” Marietta murmurs as Rashad is dismounting.
“I hope McGonagall didn’t see me,” Draco murmured.
“I dunno,” Harry said. “But it’s weird.”
“Any nudity?” Hermione asked.
. He was turning into a Slytherin for sure. And just in time for Christmas.
And where was Malfoy this morning, anyway? He’d already been gone by the time Harry rolled out of bed on the third snooze of his wand alarm. He wasn’t at breakfast, either.
“You’re sitting on one, we think,” said Michael. “Move that arse.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Poor Potter,” he said. “You know so much and yet you know so little.” Deflecting again.
“I want, too,” Harry said, leaning in. He wanted desperately to kiss Malfoy, to feel his warm mouth and get drunk on him like he was on alcohol. He thought if he were with Malfoy, he’d never be sober again. He’d be drunk forever because Malfoy was so intoxicating, so addicting, everything about him was arousing and sensual and infuriating and—
Now, Harry bought his litmus strips off Amazon. He suspected Malfoy did the same. Harry was
They filed out of the greenhouse, and Professor Sprout still had her head down.
“Think so,” Harry says. “Stomach feels weird.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Please, I would’ve Stunned Scorpius two hours ago. You do use the child-approved version, right?”
It had lasted
was, and he explained it happily, and in detail, without blushing, even as Hermione’s eyes became progressively wider. He didn’t even falter when she took out quill and diary to make notes.
“That’s great, Harry. How did it make you feel to do something nice for someone else?”
“Powerful magical artefacts aren’t exactly cheap,” Hannah said.
“And it’ll help him?” Draco said suspiciously.
They all unwrapped their whiz-bangs and carefully set them within their neatly-arranged soil samples. Harry took a dozen steps back and the others followed. He checked his whiz-bang wrappers; his code words were ‘goldfish’ and ‘telephone’.
, and Harry
Draco glanced at the cover. It had lovely oil-pastel artwork of a little girl on a broom, zooming over Hogwarts while a Welsh Green chased her, done in vibrant colours. The title read:
what you saw?” Malfoy asked, and Harry tried to ignore how his voice broke mid-word.
, that he found himself thinking it scared him more than if London Muggles had straight up reported how to get into Diagon Alley.
“Yeah, we did,” Ruby said.
“Draco!”
Jackie nodded firmly in response to this, her mouth pressed tight, but made no comment as she continued typing.
“I’m in Barcelona,” said Dudley. “Just got here about twenty minutes ago—landed at some ruins.”
Harry and Draco let out collective breaths of relief. Thank Merlin that crisis was averted.
“Not a seminar,” Harry says.
Malfoy smirked. Harry hated him because eight years had done nothing but make him more attractive than ever. His hair was longer than Harry’d ever seen him let it get—down to his shoulders and wispy. His chin was still pointy enough to cause questions at the airport, and his eyes still looked permanently narrowed, but Merlin, those shoulders—that scrawny waist, those slim hips. Harry was not a man with a type, but he hated that Malfoy was fit and attractive anyway.
“Did you know Lavender applied for the Auror program?”
Harry knows all about love. Just not his own. He knows hearts. Just not his own. And not Draco’s. Not anymore.
“Thank you,” Potter said to the Queen.
“Get me a thousand healthy ones and I can get you one million freshly hatched invisible oysters in a month,” Quincy said. “They’ll have to do the rest themselves, especially if I’ll need to start again with crawfish and lobsters. And we’ll want to go with native oysters for both the Bay and the Pacific coast—there are different types on each side.”
Draco snorted again. “Come on, Harry,” he said softly. “We have to clean up.”
Any more weeks being not fit for the force and Harry won’t be fit for
“Don’t worry,” he told her, sotto voce. “You’ve got this.”
Draco lifted one of his hands from the bed and held his palm out, shaking only a bit. “Give me some,” he panted. Harry poured oil into his hands and watched, engrossed, as he slicked up all his long fingers. “Come here.”
Harry cackled. Hermione kicked him, and it made Draco move his legs back, which was the opposite of what Harry wanted. Suddenly bereft and feeling sort of cold about the leg area, he thought now would be a good time to pay Hermione back for that time when he’d been enjoying the feel of Draco’s leg against his own, and she’d ruined it. Which was just now. Harry had never been one to sit on an opportunity for revenge.
“Hello, twat. Hasn’t anyone told you that it’s gauche to wear hats indoors?”
“No shit, Lee, what is it?” asked Harry.
Hermione typed quickly. “18 trillion gallons, so… 68,137 megalitres. Close, Malfoy.”
They burst through the door at the same time, and the threshold to Harry’s office flares golden.
“I am fearful that it is required,” the Ministry man continued, practically oozing false apologies.
Draco said, not unkindly, “Can’t you guess?”
Here in the Brussels Airport, even hidden behind the wards that separated magical from Muggle travel, Harry felt exposed. Snape could always be counted on to keep Harry rooted to reality. Even if that reality, frankly, sucked.
: Outstanding
Harry shrugged, his face reddening. “Um, I don’t know. I dated Ginny for a long time, and then I dated a couple of men, but they wanted me to fuck them, and I did, but I could just…never come. Ever. It’s why no one ever wanted to stay with me.”
when she dies, just as Draco deserves him to feel it when Harry binds his own heart to him, however willingly or unwillingly. Just as Harry deserves to feel that moment when his real love is sucked away to be consumed into a construct, a golem, a tangible misery built up into a sacrifice for the man he loves.
and you can’t kill hope, or so he’s told.
“Wow,” he said when she left, unable to think of anything else.
Which meant that Harry was either too
“Oh, god,” Ron whispers, and then he’s gone, pulled into his own head, mania overtaking him. His blue eyes go sybil-pale and the Unspeakable in Harry watches it, detached, curious, while inside, he is screaming. He has never been the one to push Ron into an episode before. He hates himself for doing it, knowing it would happen. He can’t examine this yet. He’s afraid to. He’s afraid of what he’ll see, what he’ll
“So we have to both stop the riots and counter the fear. We can’t simply give the Mers what they want and be done with it. To do so will only prove to our cowardly government that we’re too powerful to be allowed home. We have to make the Mers happy while also evidencing that Potter and I are powerless to do much of anything useful.”
Harry shrugged, and the movement caused his elbow to brush against Draco’s. He could think of a thousand things. “The Killing Curse.” Draco tensed. “Fire. Decay. Disease.”
“What do we do now?” Draco asked under his breath.
“It’s a
, and things were better, and Harry was basically happy—mostly, the sort of happy that consisted of the happiness of being around someone minus the happiness one could gain if they were
“Look,” said Harry, setting his stirring rod aside. Malfoy didn’t look away from his Transfigurations text, but did appear to be listening. “I know I said I could—that I could stop feeling particularly about you, and I know, we both know, that it was…a lie. Maybe not really a lie, but I didn’t know, at the time, how to deal with having those sorts of feelings. It’d never happened before, you know?”
“Good,” he said. Then, “Heard from Ron much?”
Harry trembled. Draco breathed against him, making little hairs all over his body stand on end. A sound he’d not recognise escaped Harry and he bent again to kiss Draco, this time roughly, putting all his want and longing and
At ten ‘til, Anthony put his book down and grabbed his cloak from the end of the bed. It signalled the end of their bickering and without delay, Harry followed suit. In his standard school cloak, he was perhaps the least well-dressed among them, but still respectable enough. The cloak was black, charmed to fit him, and in good repair. There really wasn’t much else needed, he thought, although Anthony did wear his indigo cloak well, and Neville and Malfoy had their family colours in theirs, so they looked quite sharp and Man of the House-ish.
“Wouldn’t know,” Harry said.
The translator relayed this, and Mr Koetsu shook his head rapidly, but it was more in denial than in negation.
“Same thing,” Draco says. “You really want us all to live here when they’re born?”
Harry gasps, but of course it’s unheard. She’s asking London for help? There’s another muffled reply, and then Fievel makes this long, high-pitched, angry growl that pretty much sums up Harry’s feelings about life. The mirror disconnects with an echoing crack and then he hears what sounds like every single thing on Fievel’s desk hit the floor.
“Then Merkids choke on it, right?” said Lee, coming up behind them.
Harry gamely gave him a tight smile. “Exciting day ahead of us. Those are nice robes.”
Hermione laughs. “I’m sure they had something to do with that.” Then, “Why don’t you just put a bracelet on them that says Baby Malfoy and Baby Potter?”
over his spectacles down the other end. Despite also being an early riser, Flitwick did not gain his full personality until at least eight or nine. Harry took another piece of toast from the basket and loaded it up with butter, crunching desultorily at it.
And suddenly, Harry knew. Magic sought balance, always. The spirits were attracted to his life; but Harry wasn’t truly alive in the way that other people were, and he was boring to them. When the beetle crawled over the rock, it took in all of the elements of death into itself, making the rock wholly life-oriented, and leaving itself still deathly. It didn’t want to
Draco smirked. “Think so, maybe.”
They managed to collect their entire households with only a few hours of paperwork and bureaucracy. They had to go back to the three-tailed Starbucks for Venti Mocha Lattes (extra shot, for Hermione) before they could stomach the thought of currency exchange.
Minerva’s lips twitched. “Perhaps.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, it’s just a bit of rubbish,” Harry said. “It needed to be cleaned up anyway.”
Harry’s balls tightened and he knew he was close. He kissed Draco fiercely. Draco whined against his mouth and the vibration when his other senses were damped was so hot that pleasure shot through his body and he came, hard, clenching around Draco’s cock and accidentally jerking his tether free from the rock.
hanging over their heads…this fear that it could all come crashing down in a matter of seconds. But that, under all that, there was a strange, almost vulgar curiosity for what this could mean…for how the world could change from it.
Harry nods and returns his attention to Draco.
Draco scrunched his nose as Harry scraped off a bit off moss, not quite as carefully as he could’ve. “I just find it really hard to believe that
“And speaking of,” said Dudley, grabbing one of the flyers in the stack. “I’ve got a brilliant idea for this summer. It’s a bit risqué, but I think wizarding children will feel more…at home.”
Ron nods, his eyes a bit wider than normal but the pupils aren’t yet blown.
Draco gave Astoria a Look. This shit came from the Greengrass side,
“Alright, Harry?” he says, a mockery of their youth.
They both take a moment to frown, thinking of Ron, and they both pointedly say nothing.
“What happened?” he whispers again, just as helpless as before. The rest of her family are all healthy, bright white and sparkling as healthy Wolpertingers do. Her babies are snuggled close and warm and—
“You knew!” Anthony said, as if it were an accusation.
Harry smirked at Draco. “Now it’s not sounding so bad if I come in second. I like little crème brûlées.”
Harry wanted to throw up.
“Oh but surely not! A squib kneazle for the Boy-Who-Lived? We have some beautiful snowy owls in—much better suited to a wizard of your—”
Then another rushing surge and Malfoy said, clearly: “What does it mean, loyal spirit?” and the magic soared out of them, a fountain of gold streaming lights straight up that the Muggles could see.
Why couldn’t the Ministry see that he had no interest in their politics and games? He didn’t want to take over the Ministry. He wanted to
Harry laughed, which was totally the wrong response in a time like this but he couldn’t help it. Absurdity led to absurdity.
“Give it over,” said Ron.
They trooped into the dining room, where Teddy and Rosie, mouths darkened by what looked suspiciously like chocolate cake, were setting the table under Narcissa’s exacting tutelage.
“I am
“Love you,” Harry corrects. “Even when you’re weird.”
“So if it was just sex,” Draco said, “then you’d be happy.”
“What do you mean?”
“As our Order’s founder revealed, the golden cup signifies the world that we must all inhabit together. In the cup, all materials mix together, as we do in our communities. The mead inside it is for you to sip. By sharing one mead, we tell our fellow badgers that we trust them, that we respect them, and that we are one family.”
And then he thought of the way that even if Malfoy really did want him in return, his foremost concern was winning the one million galleon prize. Harry’s mouth hardened. He was worth more than that.
Luna went to Hufflepuff, too, as did, unfortunately Malfoy, who sat as far from them as possible. Theodore Nott to Ravenclaw, no surprise there; he always did look like a swot, Harry thought. But Bulstrode? To Ravenclaw? Was the Hat mad?
“This doesn’t look like an airplane,” Malfoy said, after a moment. His fingers were white where they gripped the other half of the paper.
“Hey, mate,” said Harry. The words were light, but underneath them, Harry was still kind of annoyed from an incident the month before. Ron was his best friend, and always would be, and he tamped it down as best he could. “You look rough.”
That was unfair. Shacklebolt was restrained by international laws; he had to do things by the book or risk trial before the entire world, which would certainly slow down the process. Harry had heard from various Weasleys that Shacklebolt had put good people on the task, including the Department of Mysteries, but that’s all he’d heard. No results yet. Maybe none ever.
“Fine,” Draco said, sighing.
When he’d taken as long as he feasibly could and had brought the tea things into the living room, he found Draco casually sat in the same chair he’d favoured every time he came to Harry’s before their… parting.
Harry whines. Malfoy’s prick is dragging so, so slowly over his prostate. “You only wear
,” said the Prime Minister, retrieving a wand from her pantsuit and giving a little shower of sparks, to the audience’s great delight. Everyone cheered, and the guests on the stage gave appropriately happy claps, though Snape was still as ornery as he’d been in his first life. Living in Atlantis had changed little beyond his skin tone.
Draco found a reading chair in the far corner of the Restricted Section, well away from the possibility of upper-year students with questionable passes, and unfolded the letter.
In his tank, Seabiscuit was giving Draco a pleading look. Harry was going to miss the little bastard, but he rather thought Seabiscuit would be glad to see the back of him.
The fourth year shrugged, shifting on her feet. “I never claimed to be a poet.” She shifted again, and poked Eloise in the arm. “Eloise, do you think it’ll work?”
He extracted himself as carefully as possible, but Potter whined again, his fingers sleepily clutching at Draco’s t-shirt.
extra assignments for the holiday,” he said. “I suppose I should be grateful that I won’t have an excuse to fuck around, but really—”
“What is it?” he whispers quickly. “What’s wrong?”
Draco grimaced.
This morning it occurred in Potter’s rooms, with their keen-eyed sons giving them curious looks over their identical plates of eggs and bacon while Draco and Potter sipped coffee, read the newspaper, and pretended everything was totally normal.
“We have our own magic for that,” said one of the Mermaidens in a high, watery voice.
The first landfill they’d chosen was outside of Glasgow, and was licensed for the disposal of hazardous waste. It was a large one that continued to receive more waste every day. It was also right next to a river and a very large patch of erstwhile heather. The landfill was just beyond a nearby fence, but the stench was overpowering.
Now that sounded good. Harry had his inheritance to live on in the meantime, and Hermione had two years’ living expenses saved before quitting (she always planned ahead), but those funds wouldn’t last forever. And also, Harry got bored easily. They needed more work than the Patil-Nott wedding.
“Fortunately, I do,” Draco says, advancing into the room. He—finally—takes an obvious glance around, his lips pursing. “Honestly, Potter, the state of you. One could be forgiven for thinking you’d just watched someone die.”
Peterson looked around, reminding Harry distinctly of Zacharias Smith at his douchiest. “Do you see any Muggles here? They
For the first time, Addolgar looked pleased with him. “I think so!” he said. “Magical energy’s super similar to electrical energy, just on a different frequency. But I bet, because of the nature of plastics, that instead of becoming a conductor of electricity and magic, the heat and the hydrocarbons turn the plastic into
“Fuck, I love you,” Draco suddenly said, as if the words were too much to hold in.
It wasn’t like Draco
But something was.
“Hermione’s nice-looking,” Dennis observed.
“Ready?” Sostrate asked. The single remaining Cane Corso followed her until she put a hand out. It stopped and sat, whining.
“Oh, that,” says Draco. “Well, I’m sure she’ll figure out something. I ‘accidentally’ left a brochure for Muggle sperm donation on my bedside table a few years ago and she hasn’t said a word to me since. I think she’s enchanted with the idea of not having to deal with a daughter-in-law, so she’s willing to bide her time and see what I do.”
“Mascara?” asks Harry, gathering up his knapsack, water bottle, and hat.
. Bodies everywhere, most of them dressed in fashionable European thigh- and knee-length robes, some of them, to Draco’s utter horror, in play robes. Cities all over the world flashed by on the screen, most of them wizarding, but many Muggle, too.
, here. Not defined by his surname. And who is Harry to ask him to give that up?
After that, the conversation turned from what to do with the alien to prepping Millicent for an interview on Muggle telly. The Muggleborns and half-bloods had a lot of insight on things to say and not say, which Draco found helpful, too.
This was nonsense.
“Now what?” asked Millicent.
“Harry!” Hermione said, dropping her bags and rushing to him. “You made it! It’s been weeks! I thought you were going back to one of your anti-magic phases when I didn’t see you at the Burrow last weekend.”
But it wasn’t really normal, was it? Somewhere in the Atlantic, there was a huge fucking island that Muggles would not be able to pretend had always been there.
“Planets from other solar systems.”
Nott shrugged. “Oh, fine, I’m sure. You know Draco. Complains about everything.” Nott hesitated, but then added, “They put him with a junior Auror. He’s back on the kiddie investigations.”
“Transfigurations is a very worthy field to pursue,” she said to Malfoy. “Very like Potions. Perhaps that says something of you, that you excel in both.”
Mrs Black was propped on his dresser, and she didn’t look impressed by his state. Dry or not, he still stunk of fish and he had bits of kelp in his hair.
Draco frowned at him, then sighed and stood up. “Step back, Harry. I’ll come through.”
Harry swallowed. “Call…call Malfoy, too.” Ginny raised an eyebrow at him and he shrugged. “We’ve been looking into aliens and UFOs together, trying to see if we can figure out why they’re here.”
Harry smirked. “Whoever said Slytherins were cowards, I wonder? You lot’ll do anything for your name in a book.”
He sipped from the cup, and passed it to Justin. Draco was kneeling next to him. Their knees and hands were inches apart. Draco’s cloak fanned out around him, and one edge touched Harry’s own. Seeing Draco’s pale face illuminated by the light of a nearly full moon, seeing him swallow as Justin drank from the cup, he felt a connection between them he’d never felt before. They were here, doing this, together.
He closes his eyes as his mother’s voice washes over him. He presses his lips together, shakes it away, pulls his hand back. “I believe you are not my mother’s magic,” Harry tells the cat. “I believe you’re a new soul, free of attachments and baggage, and you will not sacrifice yourself for me. Ever. You’ll live your own life.”
“It’s like you were raised by wolves…” Draco said, seemingly to himself. “Except there aren’t any in Britain, so it must have been muggles instead.”
. He heard an agonised keening sound and distantly understood that it came from him. Draco was his love, and he’d sort of said he loved Harry, too, and there would never be anyone—
“Perfectly, I’m sorry to say.”
Hermione sighed and gave Harry a deeply exasperated look. “Well I guess you’ll just not have any surprises this Christmas.”
They tried to eat, but they were full of nervous energy. Su, Mandy, and Anthony looked even more nervous, but they’d promised the House the night before that they were ready. They’d (secretly) consulted with the Ravenclaws, getting just enough advice and second opinions to work out the complete diagram and ritual type the ancient druids had most likely used without giving their intentions away. And all three of them were whizzes at Arithmancy and had needed no extra help to formulate the inverse formula.
“Potter,” Millicent said, flatly. “We need to talk to the Headmistress, tell her we’re going on the run so she can take care of our students and classes, and then get the fuck out of here. Stop asking stupid questions and
Harry rubs her behind her little baby feelers. She rolls over in his lap to offer her belly for rubbing instead. “I named her after the incompetent Auror who failed to stitch up my slicing spell properly and left me mute for almost four months. Did you know Manticore venom will destroy the dark magic in a curse scar? Wish I’d known that during the war…”
Draco slowly closed his eyes, pulled his reading glasses from his face, and stared up at the painting above his fireplace. The specially painted library and lab combination he’d had made for Severus was finally occupied.
“Fine,” she said, suspiciously quickly.
Harry cleared his throat. “Yes, thank you. You know how Portkey-lag is.”
Or the stark look on his face, returning from the school trip with his students. The way his whole body had been tense, strung tight, as he waited for each of them to be seen to. The way he’d spoken to Pansy as a colleague, an equal, when she’d come to check on her students. How his fingers had gripped so tightly to his wand it was a wonder it didn’t sink right into his skin.
Harry ignored him, and Draco didn’t seem to mind, as when Harry unhooked the last button and let his Auror robes fall open, exposing his tight leather work trousers and the heavy erection underneath, Harry bent down and nuzzled it, and Draco moaned loudly. His fingers tangled in Harry’s hair and tugged, forcing Harry to look up at him.
“Good morning, Dudley,” Malfoy said. He gave Harry a pointed look, swept past him into the Great Hall.
“Draco,” Harry said.
“So, cheers, I guess,” said Harry.
The door beside him creaked open, and Draco peered in. His eyes fell on Harry, took in his disgruntled expression. He stepped inside and shut the door behind him. “There you are.”
“Really, Harry,” Hermione agreed.
Then finally Draco’s hand slid up, teasing the skin all around, touching everywhere but
This went on entirely too long. Harry was also in love with the tenth arrival, a big, sturdy man who flew a broom like it was an afterthought and made Harry feel absolutely scrawny when they shook hands. “Reuben Smythe,” he said in a baritone that had Harry half-hard already. “Call me Ruby.”
“If you live through this, girl, I will give you anything you want.”
“Potter? What do you want?”
Now if only he could figure out how to replicate it in the lab.
“Plus, you’re both single dads, sons the same age. Luna says Scorpius and Albus are making friends, you know. Weird names all around—I don’t even bother telling my mum what Harry named his—but to each his own, and all that.”
Torches flickered to life. A stairwell curved down and it took Harry a moment to recognize the corridor leading to the kitchens. He hadn’t seen this place in so long he’d almost forgotten about it.
“Chickened out,” Draco supplies.
They grabbed two glasses of wine and Draco caught a goblin standing attendance by the door, and bent to whisper something to her. The goblin nodded and Draco jerked his head, gesturing for Harry to follow.
… what the fuck.” Harry leans over to see her drawing an arrow pointing straight down before moving on to the next question.
Hermione looked exhausted, and Bulstrode not much better. She was glaring down at her eggs, even as Hermione passed her a fresh coffee. They’d both been running themselves ragged working on their apprenticeships, their inter-subject project that would come due in four weeks, and this new side project of fixing the Wilkins-Grangers.
“Shine bright like a diamond,” he muttered to her retreating back. “I’ll pick him up from Molly’s after lunch!” he added.
“A hoax?” asked Lucius. “What do you mean?”
Kyle lifted an eyebrow. “How’re you gonna do that, cuz? It’s not like pollution is hidden. They see it. They just don’t care.”
“I was thinking I might stay here,” Harry said in a rush. Somehow, all of his confused thoughts had focused into this one thing. Maybe England was bad for them both.
“People not of this earth,” Lucius said.
McGonagall nodded. “All right then.” She picked up her quill and returned to her work. “You’d better leave now so I have time to create a false replacement memory. Make sure you order the elf you work with to never reveal anything it sees or does tonight. They are bound to senior staff as well as to the Headmistress.”
“It’s a newer concept. But it’s a way to get many people to agree to support a single idea that they find valuable. Usually, it’s with money, but you just need pledges, right?”
good it was better than Mrs Weasley’s. Ron caught Harry’s eye, smirking—smugly.
Harry chewed his lip. It had been two weeks since he’d seen Draco at Padma and Nott’s vow ceremony, and stood with Draco in his vault, and he couldn’t sit still any longer. He knew they were supposed to be taking it slow, that he and Draco were really supposed to be limiting their ‘dates’ to the Struggles ceremonies so that they could both adjust to their new status.
it. Or blood magic.”
“I don’t know,” said Severus. “But I’d very much like to listen in at the meeting tomorrow. Will you remind Potter to take my portrait out? He often forgets.”
The shopkeeper’s mouth hung open for a moment, and then he snapped it shut. “I know the captain this year,” he said. “I’ll write him, and see what I can do.”
Why had Draco changed his mind about him? He’d been so keen that first night. Were Harry’s emotions really that off-putting? It wasn’t like he did it on purpose, for Merlin’s sake.
He kicked off, staring down at the city and the blanket of fog that hid Malfoy from his view. Harry thought of the heady, rushed intimacies between them, the way his heart skipped over beats when Malfoy grinned at him, the way he made him laugh and smile and
“Mm?”
He sighs. It’s silent again. There are no witnesses besides Draco to his being able to sometimes speak. Fucking curse scars. Maybe this is all a dream and he hasn’t actually spoken since the day his throat was slit open. Maybe he’s in a coma. Maybe he’s dead. Well, those don’t actually sound too horrible. He looks around, half-expecting Dumbledore to ride up on a train and finally take him away from all of this bullshit. There’s no Dumbledore. Surely he hasn’t accumulated enough bad deeds in the years since the war that he’s in purgatory now? Or hell?
Harry gnaws his lip.
them in danger from those…things. The Creators.”
, idiot!” Harry says. “
Malfoy’s gone for a long time. Harry can hear voices coming from the other room and one of them is Narcissa Malfoy’s. It’s raised. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever heard Narcissa Malfoy yell before, but it definitely sounds like she might be now. Harry doesn’t blame her. He’d like a good yell these days, but he has to resort to smashing plates against walls.
Snape chuckled nastily. “We shall see about that.”
“I left it just in here,” Millicent said, still sniffling but making a valiant rally.
Then he had one Snitch left and as he stared at the men still waiting empty-handed, he realized he didn’t know any of their names. He couldn’t give the Snitch to one of them even if he wanted to. Harry began to panic. And that’s when he saw Malfoy’s scowling face in the back row. Relieved to have even one person he could call up, Harry said, “Draco Malfoy.”
Draco thought it inhumane, but at least they were free of Azkaban. And free of Azkaban, he could work to save his family's reputation, to ease Scorpius's way in the world.
“I’d do it all again to be here with you,” Harry said.
He bet Malfoy’s feet were warm this morning.
Draco laid his head in his hands. “Potter…”
He looks precisely as he would if Harry were fucking him against the wall and Malfoy were reaching back to hold him there, right as he turns his face to kiss Harry fiercely.
Draco finally turned to Harry. “You’re wanted for public endangerment, and since it’s national-scale, they’re calling it an act of terrorism.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” Draco panted, barely audible. His chest arched up. Harry bent to drag his tongue over it. He circled his tongue around a nipple, then took it in his mouth and sucked. Draco made a sound that Harry would now hear in his head every time he wanked, forever.
“The Mers and the cruise ship technically aren’t our fault,” Harry said, “but we’re going to get slammed regardless, just because we knew about it.”
There’s this weird, uncomfortable moment when he thinks her hair looks an awful lot like his, that her lean, muscular back is a lot like his, that the dimples above her arse look remarkably similar to those above his own. It’s like he’s fucking himself, and for a moment, Harry is so grossed out that he thinks he might lose his erection, but then, just as he has that thought, another comes. He thinks, what if it
, you imbecile?”
Hermione made a disgusted face. “I am so glad I wasn’t at that tragic representation of human error. I honestly have second-hand embarrassment for all of you who went.” She caught Harry’s look and sighed. “All right, I was deflecting a little bit. I’ve…been contracted by the ICW. To develop a global
“Ah—Yeah,” Harry said. “Rather.”
Harry would tomorrow picture Draco thinking. Maybe it would work, and if it doesn’t—oh well, there’s always the bond. They’re both cunts, really. Dumb ones.
“So you said, but…what’s the point if I can’t depend on it?”
“Because I have to,” she said. “My visions. I have to stand up first so others can feel safe enough to do it, too. I have to find a way to get my son home.”
“The Fates don’t let me in on that much,” Ron says, shrugging. “I am but a lowly oracle.”
“What look?” asked Harry.
“So dramatic,” Harry said.
But it wasn’t normal because Potter followed Draco and Scorpius to the door and—very obviously—kissed Draco on the mouth before he left.
Hermione went on: “It says that the Clean Water Act was supposed to curb this, but that Muggles are violating it regularly without reprimand. The water’s full of ammonia, cyanide, and chlorine! No wonder everything’s dying!”
They were in a copse of trees that had lost most of their annual leaves already. The ground was crunchy-cold and the wind was ghostly, but at least it wasn’t snowing. He pulled the tent out and set about erecting it with half a mind, while he rummaged in his sack for his laptop. He could easily jump on someone else’s WiFi from here—it was a very useful spell Hermione’d come up with when she and Ron lived at the Burrow—and they would be able to have a basecamp here away from Muggles and wizards alike.
At this, there was a loud, tinny crash from the portrait. Harry smirked at his knife set, pretended to take his time choosing between the #4 and the #5.
God, if he’d known that Veelas could make you come twice in the span of ten minutes, Harry would have Mated with one years ago. Would’ve Mated with Malfoy years ago at least. What was the point of a refractory period, anyway?
. We just need to find some magical conduits!”
“Just every class,” said Harry. “Given Malfoy.”
Harry shrugged. “Sort of looked like it. It’s all computer animated, though, and the details seemed to be missing. Like a Barbie.”
Harry took it anyway, glaring. “What the fuck are you doing here, Malfoy? Seriously?”
comes a very familiar voice, and Harry immediately sits up straighter.
He began to speak the words he’d memorised whilst lying in bed next to Potter in their tent, Millicent breathing deeply in the bunk above them. He closed his eyes, letting his mind focus on this one task, the Occlumency slipping naturally into place.
“You will work with Unspeakable Malfoy on the nature of the love inflicted by the bond,” Apex decides. “We may open some avenues of pursuit with that information alone. Unspeakable Weasley will partner with Unspeakables Mitchell and Fields to unravel the bond triggers. Perhaps we’ll get lucky and a simple time-travel to deactivate the trigger will work; it’s nearly Christmas after all. I suppose I’m due some holiday spirit.”
when Harry was prone to putting off the paperwork.
Rosie’s face fell.
Harry’s mouth dropped open. He closed it with a snap. Damn him. “Fine,” he said. He was
When they were finally alone, Harry stepped up to Draco again and ran his finger down Draco’s chest. Draco leaned back against the counter, a beer in his hand, his eyes sparkling. It was just just what Harry had imagined all those years ago. The drink was different, but the emotion was the same—no, it was better. And here they were hosting New Year’s for the first time, about to start both a new year and a new chapter in their life together.
Beside him, Potter slept on, his breath slow and warm against Draco’s cheek. He was curled around Draco like a drowning thing, and somehow that made it easier for Draco to calm himself down and pull himself up from the bed.
They stopped to show Teddy off to the receptionist, Sephora, who cooed appropriately over him. They detoured by the break room where they found Nancy, Aloe, and Sergeant Boden chatting over a cuppa. He was to be shown off there, as well.
She flicked her ears, flicking Severia off in the process. Malfoy’s eyebrows went up. “And did you panic? Forget what it felt like to be a human?” She huffed.
Oh, fuck it all.
Ron went red. “Oh yeah? And if I don’t?”
“I love this collection,” Dean says, coming up behind with Lavender and Pansy. “It’s thrilling. Your best yet, Harry.”
“I never really wanted to do it. I just wanted to be Draco’s partner. I just never realised it until Draco wasn’t my partner anymore. I can’t do it if he’s not my partner and I can’t stand the thought of him being in danger. I don’t want to see it every day, and I would if I worked with him again.”
“Answer it, please.”
Muggles
Draco gave him a bitter smirk. “You’ve been breathing too many potions, Potter.”
Harry swallows. “I know. Ron’s brother’s married to one.”
Harry feels a little swept away for a moment. This has to be the nicest request for friendship he’s ever received; actually it’s the
“Thanks, Professor.”
“Not that different,” Harry said, scrunching his nose. “Just opposite. One part creates value, another destroys it. The link is already there.”
that form. Even when human, they are still their animal; it never leaves them. Once transformed once, they are always
,” Malfoy whispered to him.
Harry was still struggling to slow his breathing down. He felt like he’d been trampled by an Erumpent.
In that moment, Harry felt for the first time in the Wizarding world proper, the novel and unexpected experience of meeting someone who had no shitting idea who he was. He smiled genuinely, if tiredly.
“I suppose it couldn’t hurt to try,” Draco finally allows.
The scenery never changed. He just kept walking, and walking. It was a familiar scene. A scene he’d walked before, in real life, only months after he’d started using it as a meditation device. Had his subconscious known he would walk the forest to his death? Had it known how quiet it would be when he did?
He’d never noticed the feeling until he left Draco’s flat last night. There is a physical weight in him Draco caused, but it isn’t new. It hasn’t formed since the bond snapped into place. The truth is that Harry has felt this misery—this knowledge of potential futures, all fearsome and lonely—for years. Because he has always loved Draco, and he has always feared losing him, and six weeks together didn’t make that any better. Because Draco is like sunlight in the Forbidden Forest—he can shine light on a terrible path or filter through the trees in warm brushes against Harry’s skin, a gentle reminder of safety and desire.
Can he break these wards? He retrieves the sunglasses hanging from the neck of his uniform shirt and slips them on. He eyes the criss-crossing lines of wards around the flat, prodding at a couple to confirm that they do what his training tells him they should do. Yeah, he could get through these wards. Not easily, but he can.
“Night, Mill,” Malfoy said. “Tomorrow we’ll figure this out.”
“I admit,” Malfoy said at one point during the first half, “I have no idea how this game is played, but those fellows in blue come off rather arsehole-ish.”
Padma, pursed her lips and finished for her. “Chieftess Kaybree, and Chieftess Mother Brynlee, along with all twelve of Chieftess Kaybree’s husbands—”
When they finally set off for Hogwarts again, bursting from the Broomsticks in a warm, drunken arrangement, the snow and cold hit Harry’s face, and stung his heated cheeks. Draco smiled at him, absently, the sort of way a mate would smile at him if they were both drunk and pleased with themselves.
Abruptly, Lucius stood. He walked around to his desk, bent down and retrieved a small wooden box. He brought the box back, sat down and passed it to Draco.
He heard footsteps behind him and turned to find Draco standing in the doorway of his lab.
“Really?” Harry said, surprised. Because he could think of plenty worse. Did he even need to say ‘Voldemort’?
“The elves have prepared a buffet,” said Lucius. “Shall we adjourn to the breakfast room?”
The water made his thrusts smoother and deeper than Harry was used to. Each rocking pump of his hips rubbed Draco’s cock against Harry’s prostate, sliding over it as slickly as the water moved around them. Harry felt another delicate touch against his ankles and shuddered. The sea anemones were reaching for his ankles again, brushing their soft tendrils against the arches of his feet, along his shins, a few tall enough to brush against his fingers. He pushed back against Draco, now shamelessly trying to take as much of Draco’s cock as he could.
“I don’t follow.”
Malfoy hesitated for so long that Harry knew he’d lost him. He began to pull away, but Malfoy made a strangled sound in his throat and dove forward, pressing his mouth against Harry’s. Harry kissed him back, pouring everything he had into it. Somehow he managed to walk them backwards until Malfoy was lying back on his desk and Harry was kissing his mouth and jaw and the delicate space behind his ear.
“Don’t worry, she’s fine,” Ron said. “We go down twice a week and feed her the leftover haggis from dinner. She’s got a beau and everything – really flash looking rainbow fish that always comes to the surface with her. Think she’s happier down there, actually. Made friends with the merpeople, Ernie says, and doesn’t have to put up with Filch every day.”
. And it was really, really great because Malfoy was really, really great, and fun and smart and didn’t support a Quidditch team whose colours kept Harry awake at night. Their increasing closeness made him confident in their friendship, and it also made him want to be the only person Malfoy was this close to.
Lee looked at him, eyebrows raised. “No.”
Draco stood. “Yes, of course. I should spend some time with Aunt Wally while I can.”
He took Draco in his mouth and felt himself harden even more, if possible, at the moan that followed. He wanted Draco liked he’d never wanted anyone or anything before, and suddenly, it was too much to bear not to be able to see Draco’s face as he fell apart. Reluctantly, he removed his mouth from Draco’s prick and slid up his body, feeling Draco’s legs fall around him—it was such an intimate position that Harry began trembling and couldn’t stop.
“I’ve figured it out,” Harry says. “You’re going to hate it.”
He peeled himself off the couch, disrobing as he went. “I’m going to bed,” he called over his shoulder. “I’ve got a full day and an international Portkey with Potter to look forward to. I need to call my parents, have a wank, and somehow attain eight hours of sleep in the meantime.”
This cheered Harry more than was healthy, he reckoned. “Well, right then. So, we’re unattached, healthy, strapping, young men. There are certain, ah, needs…”
sorted.
Draco didn't even scold him. He just stood from his desk, and said, “I’ll let you read it over while I get some tea. We can talk about it after.”
Narcissa laughed. “Perhaps Epona is smiling down on our family once more.”
“What did you say? What did it say?” Millicent demanded.
“Thank you, Your Majesty,” he said.
Hermione bit her lip, grinning around the gesture. She opened her handbag and stuck her hand in. It disappeared up to her shoulder.
“A very controlled one,” Hermione agreed.
Malfoy snorted. “Please. I’m doing this because it’s all I’ve been able to think about, much to my own annoyance,” he added under his breath, but Harry still heard it. And even quieter: “Because I figured out that I want what you want.”
And the Cold Cure had come out useable last night. People were starting to look and he spelled up a
He just hoped that Draco could tell what he meant to him. He hoped Draco saw everything he felt, even though he was afraid of saying it.
Harry Side-Alonged them to the loo at King’s Cross. They received a few raised eyebrows upon exiting the cubicle together, but Malfoy ignored it entirely and Harry was blushing too hard to do much else.
Hermione pursed her lips. Firmly, she said, “They will. We just have to show them that they need us. Ooh! Padma at work just got engaged to Theodore Nott. We can offer to do theirs gratis, to build our portfolio. It’ll be a big society wedding, so we’ll get lot’s of exposure.”
Potter took a deep breath. “You’re right.” He sat taller. “You’re right.”
“Right, of course,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Hermione levers herself up from the stool and drains the last of her coffee. “Obviously I’ll need it.”
Malfoy.
Harry’s stomach tightened further. Draco felt him stiffen and pushed his shoulder lightly against Harry’s. Harry met his eyes, relaxing a little.
“Can I burn it instead?” he asks, sniffling.

. Harry didn’t know if the global
“I can’t ever stop thinking about your cock and your arse and your mouth and, fuck, just
The door shut behind Malfoy, and Harry let out a heavy breath. When had he held it?
So why did Harry feel so trapped? Why did he feel constantly watched?
Harry laughed, shrugged. “I dunno. Without the Scottish burr in her rant?”
Albus grinned at his green Nundu, said nothing.
“Helga’s family crest was of a badger, which became our mascot. A badger’s often underestimated, because it lives quietly and doesn’t mess with anyone else... but when it’s provoked, it can fight off animals much larger than itself, even wolves. We’re like that,” Eloise said, dipping an apple slice in caramel. She scraped the extra off before it could drip and popped it into her mouth. “The other houses underestimate us, but we don’t lose when one of our own is attacked. It doesn’t matter how big the enemy is; we are bigger.”
Petunia smiled tightly. “It does seem an insurmountable task.”
When all were served, Hermione disentangled herself from him, and patted at her face with the handkerchief thoughtfully provided by the house-elves alongside her teacup from her rooms. The cup was black and had, in looping gold calligraphy, the words
again?” he asked.
By the time they exited the airport and were staring in some confusion at the signs stating that the Metro was under repairs for severe safety concerns at present and trains would not be running between Reagan National and L’Enfant Plaza, whatever that meant, and that there was a shuttle available outside, Harry had had nearly enough.
Harry swallowed heavily. It made him think of Draco, suddenly, and then his body began to hurt all over, as if emotion were a physical thing. He’d quit the Aurors on September first, and here it was nearly Christmas. That was almost four months he’d gone without even seeing Draco’s face, save for at the increasingly awkward (now that Teddy was at Hogwarts) monthly family dinners Andromeda hosted.
Harry rolls his eyes.

Harry just stared at him. “And you never told me because you liked having me come around. I

Harry jumped. “Hey, kid,” he said to Albus, and held his arms out for him. Al took a running jump into Harry’s lap beamed up at him with sleep-rumpled hair.
“Not that I know of,” Harry said quickly. He was perhaps not awake enough for the spirit of this conversation. Maybe he should’ve kept his mouth shut. “The British Ministry just worries I might try to take over. I honestly have no idea why.”
“I can
“I found the most amazing caterpillar,” Hermione said, plopping down across from them with her own plate. Her hair was plastered to her forehead and her cheeks were blotchy and pink but when Dennis came up behind Harry to film her, Harry knew Ron would think she was gorgeous on the magicbox. “Do you want to see it?”
“Millicent,” Potter said, softly. “Surely this is a human rights violation. Er, an alien rights violation. Somewhere. An intergalactic one?”
“Draco,” Harry murmured. He leaned down and kissed him again, slower this time. “Pick me.”
was like saying Crookshanks and merpeople got on
Nothing.
The next morning, they’d fought spectacularly, and Draco’d stormed out, and when Harry’d come home from work that night, Draco’s things were gone. He doesn’t have to remember the gutted feeling he had in the moment he realised it; he still feels it.
“Splendid idea,” Draco said. They all gave him a look. “I’m not apologising again. Longbottom knows my sarcasm is a defence mechanism.”
Teddy nodded sagely. “That’s not how you get babies,” he said thoughtfully. Suddenly, he turned to face them. “Do you need me to tell you how to get them? Because you’re doing it wrong.”
Then the door opened one final time, and Harry’s Muggle Immersion co-teacher came in. Dudley was often later than even the Slytherins. He had farther to travel—in a physical sense, if not a quantum one.
She didn’t have an answer for that.
“Of course you do,” Luna says. “Everyone has priorities. Before Draco moved to Beirut, your priority was first to live in England. Is it still that?”
Afterwards, Harry dragged Malfoy back to Hogwarts. Even two feet of snow didn’t cool Harry’s unyielding desire for Malfoy. He practically sprinted up to the castle, pulling Malfoy along behind him, stopping every few feet to kiss him desperately, delighting in the way Malfoy laughed at his antics.
“Is what Malfoy?”
“My god,” Padma whispered.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Sprout, eyes twinkling. “We had the most outstanding thunderstorm last night. I’ve never seen anything of the like."
“And now?” said Queen Sostrate.
“Well?”
“The free Snitch went to Draco Malfoy. I’ve got five Snitches left to give out. Those of you who receive one will be continuing on with us to Brazil. Those who don’t will be returning home tonight. The first Snitch I’ll give out tonight is going to Dune.”
Draco frowned. “My son’s, as well. I think I made that clear.”
“No,” Harry said. “I don’t want to watch people die.”
Draco gave his best withering glare over his shoulder. “Be serious.”
Harry grinned at him. “Those are still pretty good. ‘Specially after a long night.”
Draco smirked. “I suppose,” he said.
“I don’t dwell on impossibilities,” Malfoy said. Then, “Who do you like for seeker?”
“Why?” asked Draco.
“It was,” she said. “The most we’ve had in living memory. Certainly a dozen times over more than I’ve ever experienced as Director of Non-Magical Perceptions.”
“I guess we’re back to the Google, then,” said Lee, finally. “And I, for one, am appalled and astounded by how much accurate information on magic is available in it.”
“Potter,” Draco said. Harry flicked his eyes to him. “They’ll burn you alive for that. It’s
“It’s got to be corrupted,” Draco said. “The tethering spell the druids used is broken. It can’t renew. The magic’s just going to float around until it just wanders off into outer space, never to be seen again.”
Granger chuckled darkly. “Of course you didn’t.” She narrowed her eyes. “Participate in the press conference?”
The barista glanced at Harry with a little quirked smile and said, “You get the feeling you’re a complete idiot for believing her and a complete idiot if you don’t?”
“My nephew watches that programme,” said Blaise, grimacing at the telly.
Although, when he peeked up at Draco, Harry saw the same downtrodden look on the other man’s face that greeted him in the mirror each morning. His heart lurched, and he wondered—could Draco also be less-than-happy about their distant relationship? It was looks like that that made Harry take leave of his senses.

Javier continued following him. “Attraction doesn’t always make sense.”
His mouth flattened. “This is
Apex considers firing Draco and Hermione. No workplace romances, even non-consensual fake ones. There is no law higher than this in the Department.
Desperate, Harry casts one last diagnostic—and there it is. A broken heart.
Potter was the definition of Gryffindor. What on Merlin’s earth could’ve scared him that badly?
“Prince of what?” Draco said. “Britain hasn’t been a monarchy since Merlin’s time. Did you even go to History of Magic class?”
. He shuts his eyes tightly, shivering all over.
This was to be Harry’s life, he supposed. A job he finally enjoyed (after that disastrous six months in Auror training) ruined by generalised, chronic discomfort because of Draco Malfoy. Who was much more tan than he’d been last time Harry ran into him.
“Hermione,” Harry said, at last. She blinked, startled. And then hastily walked up to accept the Snitch from him.
“One more thing…” he said.
“Repeatedly,” said Lucius.
ring box, fuckers.” They waited, Harry still gaping. A velvet ring box soared into the kitchen and landed in Draco’s hand. Draco curled his fingers around it, then cleared his throat several times.
Their food arrived. Ever pleasant to everyone who hadn’t pissed her off, Hermione smiled and thanked the waitress, leaving Harry to nod distractedly when she set his plate down.
If Potter was sure, then Draco was sure.
Harry hesitated. “I’ve really no idea.”
“How did you do that?”
“Yeah,” says Malfoy. “My grandmother’s right. You aren’t good for me. I thought you were, but…”
After dinner, they grabbed some groceries (i.e., beer and crisps) from the Whole Foods and walked back to their terrace. Lee had indeed left with Madison’s phone number—and her agreement to go out to dinner with him on the weekend. Then Hermione had remembered that they were supposed to tip in the US, and Lee ran back to give her more cash than was probably customary.
“Then why aren’t they doing it now?”
Harry loved chases.
Harry purses his lips. Fuck. “So did I.” Fucking Gryffindors.
“I…” Draco turned, looking all around. “I felt something unusual.”
the wrong reason—and when she came in, and started telling you off, I watched you. You weren’t bothered at all. You
Draco sneered, and turned away. “Only if it’s a good book.”
Once, Snape had revealed that he’d been Malfoy’s godfather; Harry had no clue why Malfoy couldn’t carry his frame around, then.
Malfoy sighed. “At least we’re of age now. And Hufflepuffs do seem to know how to keep the wine flowing…”
“Sorry,” Harry says. What else is there to say? The past has gone, along with all his wasted chances. He just isn’t sure if he’s apologizing for fucking up or for loving Draco to begin with. “I should’ve studied my own love. Maybe it would’ve saved us from this.”
hard.
“You had daughters?” Harry asked, shocked.
To Harry’s infinite surprise, the Chieftess swirled her webbed hands around her head and a simulacrum of a Bubblehead Charm formed over her face and gills. She slid into the water and they followed her down.
“I see,” Malfoy said, though it was obvious he didn’t.
“I think it would kill us,” Harry said. “I don’t think our bodies would survive it.”
“Daddy!” she exclaimed, in a voice much like Hermione’s at that age. “You aren’t supposed to tattle!”
Men with calloused fingers trailing over Draco’s body, hot skin pressing against his own. Draco moaned, his left hand moving Snitch-fast over his shaft as his other reached further back and toyed with his opening. He was so keyed up, so energised he felt he’d explode with magic if he didn’t come soon.
“I’ll help,” Harry said immediately. “We’re going to try to save the Statute of Secrecy, right? Dudley and I should be on the task force, as Muggle experts.”
nearly been abducted in that room, after all.
Draco snorts. “No, you don’t.”
It was while he was steaming his chicory roots that he caught the movement from the corner of his eye. The painting was of a darkened transmutation lab, so he blended in well. Snape watched Harry’s brewing with a curious focus. Their eyes met once, but Harry quickly looked away, back to his potion, before the examiner could see him. This was one NEWT he definitely didn’t want to get accused of cheating on, and soon the feeling of eyes on him faded away entirely, and he lost himself to the meditative effect brewing brought him.
She rolled her eyes. “What about the Temple?”
“Oh, lovely,” Sprout said, nodding. “Kneazles are superb for ward-setting.”
“Is Veela the theme you want to portray? I thought we were going for something more…” She waves her hand vaguely, searching. “Swampy chic.”
She paused, swallowing. Then, sharply, she added: “And you, Hugo Black! You left me to that fate!”
“Harry! And Draco! What an absolutely outstanding bit of luck,” Slughorn said as he came upon them. He slapped them both heartily on the shoulder and then stepped back to do the same to the companion he’d brought along.
Harry grimaced. “I was hoping I was reading into things.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “It was…adequate.”
“We can use disguises,” said Harry. “Can either of you do a decent Glamour?”
“Please say he is,” Rosie added.
Luna blinks three times in quick succession. “Do what, Harry?”
“Yes?”
Zach said, “Portus!” and they disappeared.
So that’s why he thinks it’s a perfectly reasonable idea to jump from behind the table, flinging curses in every direction, watching wizards and goblins alike fall on impact, and only putting up a cursory Protego when he sees the slicing spell coming at him.
Potter scowled. “I
Harry thought of the ones from the Yule Ball; maybe the one showing Ron dropping to the floor when Mrs Granger came out to the St Mungo’s waiting room to let them know Rosie had been born; those of Ron drooling as he slept on the Weasleys’ new recliner with his mouth open. “I’m sure I can find something.”
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. Had Draco tried really hard, too? He supposes he must have, to allow Harry—
Terry clapped him on the back. “Bad luck, mate. Now you’ve got to have a free dinner with Malfoy. Could be worse—could play for the Cannons. Then you’d have to wear orange
Harry couldn’t agree more. She and Albus were thick as thieves, and sometimes, actual thieves. More than once, Harry’d come back from teaching to find his rooms had been broken into and something silly, like his favourite mug, would be missing.
Draco looked pained. “I can’t move to MUS, Harry,” he said. “At least, not now. I like my life. I like teaching. I like being near my mother and a quick Portkey from Pansy and Blaise. If that’s the only place you want me, then…”
“Get rid of it,” he says.
“Well, the burr was present, as I said,” said Malfoy. He shrugged, faux-unconcerned. Harry could tell the difference in Malfoy though; he’d always been able to. “She assured me it wasn’t legal, that the Minister was bluffing, that how dare he, and what nerve, and
“Brewing time is logarithmically inverse to length of effect; you know that, Potter,” Snape said upon returning his latest essay. “Stop pretending to be a moron.”
Harry’s hidden skills, particularly with the science of magic, had yet to manifest. They returned to the school that day in silence for the first time ever. Hermione ran off to the library to meet her new Ravenclaw friends as soon as they entered the school. Harry almost invited Ron back to the Sett, but then remembered the curse. He wasn’t convinced it was real, but he’d rather test that on Goyle than Ron. And then he remembered that Hufflepuff was the only house not to allow students from other houses in.
“Are you quite sure you really want to do this?” Petunia asked, her eyes flicking among the three of them. “You don’t have to.”
“Oh, Harry,” said Ernie Macmillan. “You’ve adapted to Hufflepuff so well, and yet sometimes your Gryffindor shows through in the most obnoxiously bright shades of red and gold. No one gives a fuck who you kiss. Love all you like and anyone you like.”
“But––” said Harry.
“You think she’s got a creeper?” Harry asked, unwillingly concerned.
He bit his lip, feeling like his guts had been ripped out again, just like they had the day she and Ron first told him they were going to seek a divorce and then the reason why.
“Just wait until you find the Magic forums,” Padma said.
. She had to know she’d be labeled a nutter doing this interview, and that was the exact opposite of what Petunia Dursley wanted. He was half afraid the
“Hruudra, Harry! Hruudra, Draco!” Teddy yelled. “U Hogwarts gukk jagik druv! Frig a druv!”
He could close his eyes and hear Hermione giggle and it would be first year all over again. Or he could close them and see Malfoy’s wide, frightened eyes, and feel his knees digging into the outsides of Harry’s thighs as if he were the one controlling the broom, not Harry.
Draco frowned some more. Finally, he sighed, and reached into his pocket, pulling out a small package, which he sat in front of Harry on the floor. “You first.”
Teddy looked up. “Can I finish this first?”
Malfoy paused. His eyes lifted, met Harry’s. They were cold, mercurial, mutable—like cinnabar. “Fine. Friday. In the spare dungeon classroom. But I warn you—I won’t be your Pocket Potioneer. I’ll give you advice, but you have to do the work.”
“Into?” Snape asked. Harry could practically hear the raised eyebrow.
“No,” Draco says, panting. “Only—I—fuck you.”
“I admit this has been the most

to do good things with it. That’s why the Ministry can’t have it. It has to be his. Every last bitching painting.”
? Where is your Muggle friend?”
“Boys!” Mr Weasley knocked on the door. They dropped their hands; Harry sighed. The knob turned and Mr Weasley peeked in. “Happy Christmas,” he whispered. “Ready for breakfast?”
Draco nodded, took a deep breath. “All right.”
“None,” said Snape. “Pure will. You must destroy it utterly. It will take everything you have.”
It didn’t feel anything like when Snape or Voldemort did it. It felt—soft, unsure. Draco’s presence in his mind was warm and incredibly uncomfortable for reasons he refused to consider while he was, in fact, in Harry’s mind.
Malfoy’s got in his blood. Harry squeezes around Malfoy’s cock even as he lifts his hips, trying to work him in deeper.
“Did you really wear Draco out, Uncle Harry?” Rosie asked.
knows that, the bureaucratic jackass.”
He considered this. “Maybe. Probably. I just know that I don’t want to be an Auror because everyone expects me to, and I want to know what it’s like to really love magic like you do. I think maybe I could learn to love Potions. My boggart says I’m afraid of being like I am, so maybe what I’d really love is something I never would’ve guessed before. I have to know. I can’t stay the same.”
Dennis passed it over, already folded back to the correct page.
“In case he gets homesick,” Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes.
“It’s just… hovering there?” Harry asked.
Harry laughed. “Hey, kiddo. I bet you are,” he said, piecing together only a few of the Gobbledegook words. Teddy’s enthusiasm over the years had forced him to learn some basic phrases, but the best he could do in this situation was infer Teddy’s excitement at finally going off to school.
“I was much too old for you, my love!” Hugo insisted. “You were a flower barely blooming, and I was thirty-nine years your senior with one wife in the ground… You deserved better.”
They rushed to hug first the prefects, and then, one by one, each of the fourth, fifth, and sixth year Hufflepuffs. Then Justin turned to Draco, who was closest to him.
“I love everyone!” Harry said.
He looked down at the bed. Draco was looking back at him. His eyes were tired, but they were grey and alive and mercurial and that was all that Harry needed. “Hey,” said Draco.
“Well they can’t fucking adapt
The wizard came around and Harry reached into the hat for a piece of parchment. The examiner was already moving on. Harry unfolded it and read, and wanted to laugh.
“Genius waits for no man,” Harry muttered. “Besides, Professor Snape was there the whole time.”
“This is the best part, though,” Ron continued, and somehow, he’d procured a travel-size tin of biscuits and was now eating one. “The best part is that while you, Malfoy, and Mrs Malfoy have been gone, you’ve missed three votes. One passed. The other two were close. Andromeda’s been sitting the Black seat, though, and that helps.”
Harry, too, was unimpressed. There was something about killing a dark lord and then having to return for A-Levels that really turned a man about. Add losing his very identity, the one thing that he’d always been happy to identify himself as – not the “Boy Who Lived,” not the “Defeater of Voldemort,” not even “Harry,” but just “Gryffindor” – and he was, roughly, a doxy’s arsehole from going off the deep end.
It seemed to Harry that he gave him and Malfoy a particularly knowing look.
"Yeah, it did,” said Draco.
“Mr Konya Koetsu of
“Well,” he said, hesitantly. “I’ve picked up a pretty good eye for design, from working with Draco. He’s always commenting on the colour schemes of people’s homes when we investigate, and telling me everything he’d do differently. I’ve got good enough that I can almost always predict what he’d change and how he’d change it before he even opens his mouth.”
He was
For a moment, Harry couldn’t breathe. He stopped, his fingers hovering over the knobs of his microscope, hands shaking. It was only now that he grasped the enormousness of what was happening to him. He was here, in another country. He’d never left the UK before, not even to go to Ireland. He’d never been
?” Harry said, leaning away from her in shock. He nearly upset his ale, only managing to save it at the last minute.
“I really wasn’t expecting it to be that low for saltwater,” Harry finished for him. “That’s like… impossibly low.”
“No!” Harry screamed.
“Where, then?” Malfoy asked.
“You can be my Mate,” he says. “If you’re up for it, anyway.”
His muscles spasmed around Harry’s prick, and Harry lost it, spilling everything he had into Draco’s body. They stood there, panting, letting the high of orgasm wash over them. When it subsided, Harry’s hand slid from Draco’s hipbone to wrap around his stomach. He pulled out slowly, and leaned his head forward on Draco’s shoulder, hugging him close.
“Where would we find that? Surely the recipe’s been lost or destroyed by now.”
“It’s like being Aurors, except fun,” Harry explained.
“Must you?”
For a moment, he thought he smelled eucalyptus in the air, but no…that was just a memory from long ago. Their magic had once sloshed together between them, but now it was no longer theirs.
asked the Hat, casually.
By the time Draco realised he was currently wanking, he’d already given up on the pretence of his having any control over where his mind drifted. But he refused to think of Potter.
“Of course you did,” Draco sighed.
Harry looked around. Hufflepuffs and former ones were moving to other cloaked figures. Fourth years, huddled in the middle of their group, looked excited and nervous, relieved when they were selected. Justin Finch-Fletchley went and shook Draco’s hand, and Hannah went straight to Neville. Luna was chosen by a Parkinson. Tracey Davis, Mandy Brocklehurst, Su Li, and Sally were all quickly picked. It seemed that no one was coming for him, that he’d been forgotten.
came a special edition copy of the local Muggle paper, the
. Draco blinked quickly, and seemed to become slightly more coherent.
Harry swallowed, but kept his chin lifted stoically. He would not go down like this. “What do I want?”
“Roger that. Everyone put your seatbelts on, I’m starting the descent now.”
“Harry, I know you wanted to try transfiguring the Felix Felicis into bad luck, but I think we should wait because—hello, Mill.”
He decided to enjoy the fire and Draco’s warm expression instead.
, Harry says right way. Then,
And then he rushes after Malfoy—because how could he not?
“Potter? What the fuck are you doing here? It’s past two in the morning.”
The Seahorse was quivering in excitement—so much so that he was creating little ripples in the water.
Harry stepped off the gargoyle staircase and straight into Malfoy. His chest was warm and solid. Their mouths had nearly touched for a moment. Was it weird that he was sort of attracted to Malfoy simply because Malfoy hadn’t turned him in to Voldemort when the Snatchers got them?
Harry sinks to his knees, neatly pushing aside Draco’s robes to finger the laces of his trousers. Draco’s breathing speeds up as Harry looks up at him over the curve of his belly. It should be weird, and Harry admits he’s still getting used to the idea, but it’s so fucking hot to think that part of him and part of Draco are making something brand new, that their magic is so sodding compatible that they created life without even the need for potions.
Harry pulls his eyes away from the cat. A kitten really. White fur and blue eyes looking back at him. He’s never taken himself for a cat person, precisely, but he’d just been waiting for Draco to sort out a damaged vanishing cabinet for work and he’d seen her.
“Yes,” Luna agreed. “A gay one. Obviously. Look at all the penises.” Three cameras dutifully panned around the sauna’s interior, zooming in on the phallic decor and the other men lounging throughout, some with clothes on, some without. Harry hoped, sincerely, that they would be censoring those bits.
“We’re about out of time,” said Orkney, reluctantly. “Let’s all dig a little deeper into Neville’s article. For homework, I want everyone to study up on the United Magical Nations – what resolutions has Britain brought forward in the last twenty years? How did the UMN respond? Give me six inches on what you find.”
And bugger it all, he shouldn’t have thought of Malfoy while he was wanking.
“I did,” said the Hat. “This one is a Gryffindor.”
“I won’t,” Malfoy said. “I know.”
Slowly, Harry continued, “... The rubbish ward.” Murdoch grimaced. “We got MACUSA approval for that,” Harry felt compelled to say.
Everyone crowded around the paper. Gasps sprang up all around.
It was still kind of hard to process.
Both Harry and Teddy rolled their eyes at this. “No, nothing about my dating life, which is private, thanks. This is about Gringotts.”
“Come in, Draco,” Hermione added.

“Yeah, still a bit of tinnitus, but it’s fading.”
They’d tried. They’d both tried for
“On a small scale, maybe,” said Draco, frowning. “I could develop a potion that would neutralise the chemicals Potter tells me to neutralise, but I could only concentrate it enough to treat a single megalitre. There must be at least 60,000 megalitres in the bay.”
“Studied,” he said. “Haven’t you seen me?” It’d been all he did for days now.
“Just look at it,” Dudley said, gesturing towards the mobile Pansy still held in her hand. “It was in the sky, just hovering there. As big as the Quidditch Pitch, just sitting there, no more than a thousand or so feet up. Black as night—so black, I’d swear it actually devoured the light around it. And it was so utterly silent. Not a hum. It wasn’t natural, nothing any human—magical or Muggle—made. I’d swear on my life.”
“Hmm.” Harry focused on Draco’s glass, and thought of

“I can’t,” Draco bit out.

Harry glanced at Malfoy and Millicent. “We’re going to lose our magic,” Harry said. He hesitated.

“I don’t think it’s MACUSA,” Draco said. “Harry.
“This is bollocks,” Draco said. “Why do I have to play the foxy woman? I want to be Reverend Green.”
“Well—yes,” says Hermione, chewing her lip. “It might help. Shouldn’t we try everything?”
Harry pursed his lips, frowning as he did as directed. The clues were straight-forward, on par with the maths Teddy was already doing with ease.
in your life at all.”
“It is real, though,” Harry says, meeting his eyes even though he’d not moved from his position lying next to Nigella. “It’s always been real. At least for me.”
“You should go talk to him,” Hermione continued, turning another page.
“Teddy,” Draco began awkwardly. He looked to Harry for help, but Harry shrugged. How the fuck was he supposed to know what to say? He was a wands man, not a words man.
,” Harry added. “At first. Afterwards, you’ll realise we were right all along, though you may still be disappointed.”
Draco pursed his lips as he took the sandwich. “The eternal optimist in me really hopes for better.”
Harry thinks, panicking. He can’t bring his daughters into a place full of lead paint, and they’re probably going to have to move there eventually because Draco’s flat’s just a studio. There’s no way four of them can live there together. Grimmauld’s got six bedrooms and a garden. It’s definitely the better idea but if there’s
It took some small-word explaining to convey the idea of electricity and fuses to many in the group, but by the end of it, Harry felt confident they had a working plan. He was practically snuggled into Draco by this point, and no one even looked twice. It felt both taboo and absolutely normal.
What was he

Ron is the first to speak. He looks to Harry, eyes narrowed in thought, and says, “Is he vegan?”
Everything was amazing. Draco made amazing sounds, moved in amazing ways, said amazing things like, ‘
Finally, Snape said: “If Mr Potter is, by the grace of Merlin and perhaps God, able to secure an O on his NEWT, then I shall accept him for apprenticeship, if for nothing else, than the entertainment value. After all, as you say, Mr Potter, I have quite a lot of time on my hands.”
“What’s the situation?” she barked.
“What—? No,” Weasley said. “That’s not the point. I mean, we might have problems if they figure out how to breach wards, but until then, most of us are just staying in the magical world. The point is Hermione and I have been literally

Harry, Petunia, and Millicent’s mouths gaped.
Lucius’s ten years of house arrest had been increased to fifteen, broken up by his forty hours per week of community service for the Ministry. The same sentence length as Narcissa’s, but Lucius got to walk through London every week. He got to stop at Gringotts during his break, or even have lunch at one of the cafés in Diagon.

“Hmm,” said Malfoy, unimpressed.
His hand clenched around the glass, and he added, as if forcing the words out through cement, “We fucked this thing up long ago. We should’ve taken a step back before we got married… let things from the war settle, before we jumped into married life. We weren’t ready for it, and it brought out the worst in both of us. But it doesn’t mean Hermione’s not the love of my life. It just means that sometimes, it’s better if you don’t stay with the love of your life, so that they can
“Where the fuck do you get a name like Seabiscuit when you could have given him a respectable, regal name, like Draco? He does look like a little dragon, doesn’t he?”
“You missed breakfast.”
Everyone frowned, considering this.
Harry turned, took hold of Draco’s hands. His eyes scanned Draco’s face, looking for what, he had no idea. “You’ll ruin me,” he murmured.
Harry looked to Luna, who was pawing through his luggage, looking at his pants and shaking her head. “None of these are swim trunks, Harry,” she said, disappointed.
“Harry?” he murmurs into his pillow and then breaks off into another moan as Harry’s tongue swirls around his hole.
“But Amortentia's illegal. And Ron will be there. And

“Okay…” said Hermione, writing ‘VOLCANOES’ on her notebook in large block letters. “Volcanoes are hot, like love,” she said to herself, then nodded decisively. “We can make volcanoes romantic. And if you don’t want to have to prepare the Patil home for a wedding, or enlist all your family into cooking, then we can also find you a venue to have the ceremony and reception and people to cook for it.”
Draco shrugged. “Oh, about eight years ago.”
Kennedy Jones sat back down at her desk and then gestured vaguely. Three dated, government-issue chairs popped into being. It was a lovely piece of wandless, wordless magic and even Harry was impressed by it. “Please sit.”
She took a few steps forward, called Galene’s name. Galene appeared with a lovely embroidered chair, which the Queen sat upon, before popping away again. She popped in thrice more with chairs—not quite as lovely—for Harry, Millicent, and Malfoy. Harry, still feeling the dizzying aftereffects of their ancient Chinese communication ritual, sat gratefully.
“These things—they’re called crop circles by Muggles—they’ve shown up all over England for years. Sometimes they turn out to be fakes, made by bored Muggle teenagers with some rope and a couple two-by-four planks.”
“Yes.”
He hesitated for only a moment before nodding. “Yeah,” he said at last. “I do like it here.”
“Apex asked me to look into the nature of the love your bond’s founded upon. Knowing that it was triggered by your—dislike—I was able to cross-reference the unsolved cases we have over in Love. There’s another bond like this. It was used in the twelfth century when villages were falling apart because everyone was dying of Plague, but they needed everyone to pull together.”
He knows she
“The sacrifice of our secrecy?” Draco asked archly.
, “You did. Frequently. I was embarrassed for you.”
“Draco, we simply don’t have the political capital to withstand the firestorm that would result if we killed Muggles—” Lucius said.
“You can keep saying it,” Harry offered.
If things had been different, Harry thought, if Ron had never had first call on Hermione, he could’ve fallen for her too, maybe. Things would’ve been simpler that way. But things
the Muggles, after all—and Mother had figured it out. And because Mother had a mind like a Basilisk, she’d also figured out it wouldn’t work.
Draco, Hannah, and Neville stared aghast.
Harry frowned. “Why would Malfoy want a connection with me?”
“I know,” Malfoy said, turning to him. His eyes were sparkling and he looked flushed and happy. “But I have a thing for watching someone come on a cock, and you do it so well.”
“Ah, no. We were…friends for a little while. I…actually joined the league with him.”
a breach of Statute, correct? And you, Professor Bulstrode—I thought we were just showing Muggles the extraterrestrial? Not magic!”
Luna Apparated in with the scuba instructor, and they had to sit through an entire hour of Bubble-head safety instructions. Any erection Harry might’ve had from Ruby’s hairy legs was long gone by the time they actually got to fall back into the water. They all swam around, taking in the corals. Harry was enthralled, and found himself tracking a school of little red fish, then a huge turtle, and nearly pissing himself when he saw a shark swimming towards them.
children,” Anthony said, picking up the thought, “then the magic would be just as free flowing as it is anywhere else in the world, and relatively safer from the effects of the magical traps than environmental magic.”
Harry pops it open and pours them both a glass. He divvies up the noodles and tosses all the lime wedges onto Draco’s plate without comment. If he doesn’t let himself look beyond his blinders, it almost feels like it used to. It almost feels

They were back to Harry’s original plan. He patted his jeans pocket. “Come here. Let me Side-Along us all.”
Harry glanced at Malfoy, lifting his eyebrows in question.

Ah, fuck, he was
“Could be worse,” he said. “You saw how they lived.”
Harry could see the very moment that the waitress decided she’d be giving Lee her phone number. Her hip jutted out just a bit more as she shifted her weight and rattled off the draft list. None of them were familiar to Harry until the end, when she said,
Harry quickly changed the subject, filing the idea of a de-frizzing spell away to tell Ron about, so that he would be the one to suggest it to Hermione and face her wrath (and not Harry). “What was that about the Ravenclaws, though?”
“No idea!” Harry said, happily. “Look, this one sells Thai hot dogs. Let’s eat here.”
Severus shook his head. “The ICW has been crawling the island looking for you three. They can’t touch the Queen or any Atlanteans without it being an act of war, since Atlantis never signed the Statute agreement, but they are certainly making life annoying for her…and keeping civilian contact from reaching her, though Muggle diplomats have been dispatched from most countries—the city is teeming with them. Some have brought sightings of ships with them—strange things as well. Crop circles and livestock mutilations. A number of Muggles have lost hours of time, as if
“Let’s not get arrested then,” said Neville.
Having a mutt to sleep with at night helped keep the empty-bed syndrome at bay, but it wasn’t as good as sleeping with another person. Those years with Ginny, even after things had fallen apart, at least gave him someone to spoon against. Ms Danger’s fur was incredibly soft, but she also wasn’t visible most of the time, and only weighed a stone and a half besides. Hardly a substantial presence.
Draco flopped back down on the table. Harry moved closer, thinking of all the ways he could occupy himself while his water began to boil.
Uneasily, Draco replied, “Thanks.”
The truth was, blood made him squeamish.
There was a moment of thoughtful silence. Yet, Harry couldn’t not ask the question: “But which one is our enemy? The Mers… or the Ministry?”
“And I’ve felt it, too,” Potter continued, his voice low.
At the end of the tour, they wandered into the shop, which had items more to Harry’s tastes. Dildos, specifically. Large ones, vibrating ones…a new kind that pulsed, even. He wondered if it would be as good as when Malfoy had fucked him, if it would feel as good as his cock thrusting in and out.
The door slams shut to Draco’s bedroom.
“Ronald!” Mrs Weasley exclaimed, as she disentangled from a hug with Hermione. They ignored her, and she bustled off to find Ginny, who’d decided to ride home in Luna’s compartment with the other ‘real’ seventh years.
,” Draco begged.
They had to pass through the living area to get to the kitchen, and the carefully repaired tapestry hanging above the settee. It was framed now and the line had been expanded. Dorea Black now properly showed her marriage to Charlus Potter, and Charlus Potter’s son, James, was now connected to Lily Evans, and perhaps it had been a little narcissistic of him, but the tapestry also now showed a single child thereof: Harry. He’d had a Master Spell-weaver fix and finish the tapestry for him some years ago, and it now hung proudly on his wall. This was his family, and the heritage he’d adopted, and it was how he felt grounded to the world.
Harry stared at the back of his head for several long moments, feeling his insides rush with blood, and wondering what, exactly, Malfoy had meant by that. He didn’t get any more reading done in

managed to keep his cool around Draco. It’s not like he’s Mister Suave or anything. He’s just… relatively happy with himself on most days, and brave or stupid enough to put himself out, lay himself bare, for a chance at something he wants.
, and he felt a moment’s pride at Millicent’s skill with defence. She’d have to be skilled to be the lead professor, of course, but he’d never seen her use it in real self-defence before. Clearly, she worked well under pressure, but then, all Slytherins learnt to do that to survive.
“And the Pacific oysters will be ready then, too,” Quincy continued. “They were just as easy as this Bay variety, but we’ll need three million to make any difference.”
“Malfoy,” says Harry, clearing his throat. Malfoy looks down at him with that same flat, aristocratic expression—if Malfoy doesn’t react like anything’s wrong, then nothing’s wrong. It’s how posh people work. Harry knows; he sells them clothes.
He grabs his wand and coats his fingers with conjured lube. It drips between them and onto their cocks. Harry slicks Draco’s up, feels him trembling with each stroke, and then reaches behind himself to do himself. He doesn’t hesitate, but he’ll admit that he has no idea what he’s doing. One finger slides in and he tentatively moves it in and out, to no particular effect or sensation.

He wished he’d brought Snape’s portrait, that it wasn’t still down in Atlantis, probably waiting to be nuked. He had a hysterical moment where he hoped Snape got to his frame in Hogwarts before that happened. But his eyes were glued to the field and the relief of shadows and light barely visible in the fading gloaming light.
“It’s mostly sorted,” Ron said. “The Ministry dropped the charges this morning.”
Draco peered at the woman there. She wasn’t particularly attractive, but she wasn’t unattractive, either. Tall, thin, blonde, plain. She did have a rather nice set of blue-green eyes, but Draco could see how those would easily be forgotten by the frown lines arcing around her mouth. She was standing on the doorstep of a white house with a very nicely manicured front garden, apparently caught mid-word, so that her mouth was open and she looked stern. Muggle photography was so strange—and rude! To leave a woman’s mouth open like that for all eternity!
Harry scowled. He bent to retrieve his clothes and hurried to put them on, belatedly remembering to spell away the trail of come running down his thighs. “You should go.”

of you to sacrifice yourself for me.”
Sunday morning he finally got around to writing that letter to Ron, though what to fill it with was still a mystery. He worked on it all through breakfast, adding thoughts here, anecdotes there, but an hour after, it was barely a page long. Hermione took pity on him and suggested he include the Gryffindor Quidditch team line-up, as it would take up space.
“Except that time you accidentally Obliviated—”
“There are a number of different spells they could learn to light a room,” said Anthony. “If they’d but look it up.”
She scowled. “I am
That night, Harry couldn’t sleep.
In his head, Harry was cackling.
“Murdoch would,” said Yaxley. “And perhaps he might. What’s more interesting is the two motions he tried to pass, but failed. The first was to remove a hereditary seat if a family could no longer provide someone from the main line of the family to fill it, and let the seat go to an elected official instead. That nearly passed. The second was to add term limits to Wizengamot members. That one would’ve passed, save for the hereditary seats. They came together on it.”
“Oh my god,” said Padma. “Draco! Your charm!”
,” he said, moving their hands together.
“What’s wrong?” asked Hermione, following his gaze.
“And dump it all on the beaches?” Harry asked.
Draco and Potter wasted no time going for seats—although Draco maintained a more dignified approach, carefully orchestrating it to look like chance that he’d made it to a good chair first.
“I didn’t think you’d pick me,” Malfoy said. Harry looked up to find Malfoy still smiling at him.
Hagrid brought the first years in. Flitwick stood to sort them, and even that passed in the same drowsy blur as the rest of the day. When all the new first years were sorted, Minerva stood to welcome in the year. She introduced Malfoy and the new subject he’d be teaching, and how relevant it was to recent events and therefore everyone with space in their schedule should avail themselves of this opportunity, and so on. Harry didn’t know why she bothered; Malfoy’s class was bound to be a hit anyway, just for sheer coolness factor.
“I will see it done,” McGonagall said. “That is, if Mr Malfoy agrees—?”
“Sorry mate,” Ron says, as if he has anything to apologise for. “I wish it’d worked out with Charlie.”
, yes, Harry,” Draco said patiently. “Only I’ve been forced to resign.”
“I’m just saying,” said Harry, before Draco could get started, “that if you—if you ever wanted to, then go for it. I’ll welcome it. And I’ll never try to…cage you.”

you as a professor. There was no scandal around you, no one vying for your position. I just don’t get it. Any of it.”
thinks Harry. Maybe even some actual just-fucked to go along with it. Preferably by Harry.
“And I want to show off my godson!”
Harry inhaled sharply. “It worked,” he said.
“With Dudley’s mother?” Millicent asked, uncommonly interested. “Can we watch it on your lap calculator?”
“Yeah, duh, he’s into all sorts,” said Dudley who then paused to consider Draco’s other comment. “You don’t think he’s fit, though? I mean,
Draco smiled a little, and they were back on safer ground. “White, grey speckles. Very sleek and classy.”
“Yet,” said Luna. She gave them a pointed look, which they responded to with mute confusion. Harry was gay. Hermione was married. To Harry’s best friend. “Your last date in Australia, Harry—it’s now. Are you ready? Everyone will be coming.”
“Cold Cure?” he asked.
Draco chokes and Harry gives him an imperious look. Harry snatches the black deck from him and lays down the top card: ‘What will I bring back in time to convince people I am a powerful wizard?’
Harry tensed. He didn’t move them; they stayed like that—warm and connected with Harry’s body, and he imagined a different situation when their legs might be tangled, only without the woollen trousers between them. He shifted, suddenly uncomfortable. Draco’s legs remained, the toe of his shoe pressed against the back of Harry’s calf. Tingles ran up his skin, and he allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and
“I went for tea with Hermione,” he protested.
“You’re late,” he said.
“Introductions are in order, I think,” McGonagall continued. She held an arm out, indicating the woman to her right, and with a start, Harry realised that he’d met her before. The night he first met this woman, he and Draco had spent

recognition for it. Almost against his own will, he looked back at the lights coming from the town of Hogsmeade.
It was just Draco’s luck that after narrowly escaping prison, and both his parents somehow also escaping prison, his life would turn around so spectacularly—seven years of travel with his son, studying everything he could find on the only subject that had ever held his interest for more than a month, landing a job that was practically made for him and getting to prove all those bitter do-gooders wrong—only for someone to decide it was a great time for Atlantis to resurface in one stupid explosion. And apparently half of all magical people now preferred Muggles over their own culture, too.
Ron grimaced into his pumpkin juice, but, on the whole, was faring rather better than Harry had expected. It was either Christmas spirit, Auror training, or the fact that he’d invited Lavender, and he didn’t want to open himself up to return fire.
“What?” she said. “I used a mnemonic.”
The reporter’s eyebrows furrowed slightly, but she nodded. “You believe the aliens have malicious intent, is that correct?”

The meeting was scheduled just outside Annapolis in Cedarwood Cove at seven that evening, because Merpeople were, apparently, crepuscular. The six of them drove up in a Range Rover loaned to them by the Department of Non-Magical Perceptions. Padma was driving and Hermione navigating, and Blaise and Lee seemed to go back further than Harry had anticipated, which left him sitting next to Malfoy in the back row. It could’ve been worse.
Dudley sat on the chair by the fire, and looked up at him with the same sort of annoyed expression Daphne used to give Draco when she was about to start washing her hands thirty times or list out an array of stock prices around the world from an edition of the
Harry grabbed the teacup. But when the Portkey landed, they weren’t standing out front of Grimmauld Place. They were in a room Harry’d never seen before, but he could immediately tell was in Hogwarts. There was light streaming in from windows overlooking the Forbidden Forest, a tidy walnut writing desk, and a couple of cosy chairs around the hearth. A door beside the fireplace led to a polished white loo, and another began a hallway Harry was sure would end in a bedroom.
Harry grabs his hand again and refuses to let go. He falls asleep just like that, with his head on Draco’s stomach and Draco’s tired fingers in his hair. Draco’s alive, and nothing else matters.
left in your sentences. What are you planning?”
“Give us a moment, would you, Haagresha?” asked Draco.
“Does he even know what that was?” asked Draco. “Has Andromeda explained sex to him yet? Maybe we can convince him you were helping me with a tailoring spell on my trousers.”
“I hate fucking steaming baskets,” he muttered, scrounging around in his kit for the little copper sieve.
“Hellooo!” called Narcissa from the Apparition Foyer.
“I didn’t tell him to, I swear,” says Hermione, nursing a cup of long-cold tea. She hasn’t even bothered to cast a warming charm on it, and that’s how Harry knows she’s truly upset. “We were making lists of things we remembered liking about our previous partners—”
It wasn’t easy keeping up this facade for Andromeda and Teddy’s sakes. It wasn’t easy working with Draco day by day, missing him night by night, and having to fake something that should’ve been real once a month. They used to be so good together. They used to have the highest solve rate in the Auror Department.
The guests started arriving shortly before five, and Hermione rushed in to grab Harry. “They’re about to start,” she whispered. “We’ve got to get out.”
It was at this point that Draco returned with his winnings and his smirk. He eyed them for a moment, taking in Terry’s red face and choking gasps, and Harry’s more restrained, but still ridiculous, delighted laughing.
“I remember,” Harry said, giving Justin a wry smile. “In second year, when everyone thought I tried to make that snake attack you.”
be wonderful,” Hermione said. “Or, at least, it can be. Think of how great it would be for us if we got some good press from this. It might bring in business before we even finish with Padma and Theo’s wedding!”
“What the hell is that?” Michael asked. Malfoy held out his hand, in which there was a clay bowl with a containing spell over the top.
of money and it’d be great for public relations! People would be so excited if they got to see the inside of the bank, you know, the
Draco’s eyes searched him out desperately. His hands were clawing at his own throat. Harry grabbed hold of him beneath his arms and pulled, hard, as hard as he could, away from the infected air. He barely noticed the agony of his own dislocated shoulder.
He finds he’s not as immediately copacetic with the legs from grown insects, but the flavour’s stronger in them and he likes that. Kind of like saffrony walnuts, in fact. The next stick is a scorpion and he doesn’t care for their bitterness, so he bins those and pulls out the last one: a skewer of four fat beetles. It turns out these are his favourite.
“I have believed in magic since I was ten,” Petunia said. “When my sister first changed a flower into a butterfly.”
“That sucks,” said Goyle, quietly. Harry nearly turned around in his seat to look. He’d never heard Goyle offer a single comment in class before.
Harry gave him a flat stare. “You are such a git.”
“Well,” Harry says, pulling out and unshrinking several more packages, “I really don’t know what the fuck an aromatic white wine is, so I also got something called a harslevelu, a dry reisling—that one I recognized—and a pack of lager because I’ve seen how you can clear a bottle of wine and I knew we’d need backups.”
There was a great deal of meaning behind that declaration, and Harry knew he wouldn’t get out of telling her where he’d disappeared to during the feast and what it meant. He never could get anything by her—so he decided to just go for it, fuck what Malfoy thought. They needed her help.
He barely breathed. It’d been so long.
“Well whatever the case, I’ve got to start at the beginning,” he said. “Remedial Potions. I feel like I’ve come full-circle.”
“Crowdsourcing, of course,” said Petunia.
They pondered this for several minutes, but neither of them could come up with anything to add, so Harry just sighed, and said, “I don’t like this. It’s 2013. We should’ve become at least as logical as Muggles, by now.”
Draco had forgotten his figs, his hydromeli, and his own name. His blood was ice cold. This could not be truth. And yet, Sostrate continued:
“So, Mr Potter,” Narcissa says. “Draco tells me that you often work together. Do you think a career in politics is in your future?”
“You said I don’t know anything!” Harry said in defence.
“What if,” Harry said carefully, “you watched me do it?”
If they continue this way, one of them is going to have to quit. Both of them are desperate not to.
They’d never counteracted the diseased part of the stone, to make it Panacea. And they were breathing instant death. Draco’s face was turning purple, and he was gasping in the most horrifying way, as if his lungs were closed off and his throat was full of water. God, he was asphyxiating. Right in front of Harry’s eyes.
The sound stopped. Every single Hufflepuff collapsed. The last thing Harry saw before the world went black was the unnaturally pale irises of Draco’s grey eyes.
“And by ‘right’ you mean…”
No one would ever expect that. And then he’d show Snape, and
Harry uncrossed his legs and crossed them again the other direction. “It’s just—and if I may—he’s such a
“Harry, you didn’t,” Hermione said, sighing. “What do we need with that prize money?”
people.”
. And…and I’m afraid that…that Dudley’s one of
“It’s another,” Harry said, senselessly. “What’s it doing here?”
“I thought we might save a portion for the shoreline. It would be child’s play to fashion up a ward that pulls all the rubbish in and holds it in the shallows.”
Malfoy frowned. “Tricky’s not the word I’d use.”
“It has no name…”
“It’s something,” Draco agrees, voice muffled. Finally, he pulls his hands away from his face and stares at Harry with raw eyes. “I would rather live a lie with you than with Hermione. I don’t know if it was true before, but it will be. I will love you back.”
He lives with Ron again, just like he did right after Hogwarts. They’ve had ten years to fall back into bad habits from their early years. Without Hermione to keep them in line, they subsist predominantly on beer and take-away and loneliness.
“Anything else?”
“We’ll take him together,” Draco agreed, reluctantly.
Dudley laughed, opened the door wider. “Come in, come in. Millicent’s pulling some ribs off the grill—sugar-free BBQ, hope you don’t mind—and I’ve got wings coming out of the oven in just a sec. I’ve got a green salad and some broccoli with dip. Made some nachos for the kids. Beer? Vodka’s zero-carb if you’d rather a cocktail.”
Hermione blinked rapidly. She stuck another piece of sticky bun in her mouth and chewed on it while she stared at him with large eyes. “Are you kidding?” she finally said.
“But it was not fast enough. Generations went by and while humans on the island were growing stronger, smarter, lither, their own forms were growing thinner, weaker, their senses dulling. So they began to change us, making small adjustments to us that would hasten the process, and when they reached the form and mind they desired, they duplicated that person, so that they might be more available for making children like them.”
“Yes,” said Draco. “Magic is with everyone, even those who don’t have the ability to use it. Your body knows your history, even if you don’t.”
“The morning coat or the scenery?” Harry asks.
They all watched her for moment, but it didn’t seem to be doing the trick. He sighed, resumed his seat in the chair next to Millicent. He closed his eyes, tipped his head back as if life were too exhausting to mess about with. He swallowed and Harry watched the movement of his throat, hypnotised.
Immediately, he regretted it, but it was too late. Malfoy’s face had already transformed from open and genial to the closed off façade he’d worn all through the war. It was a face Harry hadn’t realised he never wanted to see again until he did, in fact, see it again.
He did. After chugging it down, he felt much relieved, but that freed his brain up to think more clearly, and a new thought entered his mind: Draco hadn’t stayed over last night. Draco had been staying over in Grimmauld with Harry almost every night. And, sure, it hadn’t been every
“No, save it for tonight and our headboard,” Harry says. He tosses Draco a pair of jeans and a t-shirt that says
Harry scowled. She turned another page. When he realized that Hermione had no intention whatsoever of talking to him again until he did so, he swam over to the other side of the pool where Ruby was lounging with a glass of barrel-aged whiskey.
Harry nodded to Malfoy and the elf turned his beady eyes upon Malfoy then. “Kreacher, I need some books from my rooms in the History Wing. Can you get them for me?”
Draco finally looked at him, and his eyes were so grey and solid that Harry would’ve sworn he didn’t reflect light at all. There was no hint of the green wall sconces in them, no hint of anything save for decisiveness. “Love. A boyfriend.”
Dudley inhaled deeply, letting it all out in a big sigh. “Smells so much different than the rest of London. Really fresh, you know? Amazing what a couple of trees can do for the air.”
Harry had a feeling he could guess where this was going, but when Ron pulled him to the side, into the mouth of an alley, and fished into his pocket, Harry realised he hadn’t really been prepared at all. Ron snapped open the little box, displaying it carefully close to his body, Auror instincts making him wary of unscrupulous people who might try to mug them for it. The ring was sparkly, and big, and…
Draco exhaled in a rush, and suddenly, he looked furious. “
Harry’s good mood at the sight of Draco in a prissy necktie (his favourite thing, basically) quickly evaporates like a Weasleys’ Portable Oasis. “Damn it, really?”
He took Draco’s hand and they Apparated to a secluded segment of Marine Park, at the edge of Brooklyn. Harry inconspicuously conjured some wellies and waded in. He was looking for a particular rock formation that Quincy had told him about. Normally, seahorses preferred warmer coasts, but this was a magical herd who’d, supposedly, relocated to New York to start anew. They lived in the salt marshes now, and didn’t seem to mind the cold.
His heart was tired. It had been thirteen years since Voldemort. Harry was thirty years old, and he’d spent the last nine years of his life living, pretty much, like a Muggle. He’d gone to University, read Chemistry, taken a Muggle job in a Muggle lab, and devoted himself to a fascination with the chemical of life.
His week of hazing is over, but maybe it will endear him to Yelling French Auror Proulx, who, Harry learned last week, is also Draco’s new partner. He has a deep and instinctive hatred of Auror Proulx, so the endearing will only be going one way, but Proulx seems to respect Draco’s talents a lot, and that…well that means something to Harry. Even if being replaced feels like his lungs have been replaced, too. With rusted spikes.
“I don’t know!” Harry said. “I’m a simple bloke. I want to do my job and have people I love to come home to. I want to take a holiday every now and then. I want someone to f—” he stopped abruptly, but Luna didn’t seem at all moved. He continued, slowly, cautiously, “I want someone to fuck me. Like they mean it.”
Sostrate hummed, shook her head. “I found much of it hard to believe. Please join me in my meeting room.”
“Good job, Potter,” Draco murmured.
“That was the other one, Lyndon! That one’s just going to
The conversation slowed after that. The day was a resounding success, but they all still felt drained. Even Petunia looked as if the weeks she’d spent under stress would take more than Dudley’s safe return to completely dissolve.
Harry nodded. “And I’ve been reading about chemicals and what could be affecting the flowers–”
“That was
“Maybe,” she said. “We can pop over again tomorrow and find out.”
McGonagall considered. “Animagus transformations can override potions and human transfigurations,” she said. “This isn’t unusual.”
“That’s true,” said Zach. “I don’t like them either.”
“Say something,” Harry said, tiredly. He looked over her shoulder and then over his, checking to make sure they were still alone. Somehow they’d managed to sneak away from the camera crew, but no doubt they would find him shortly.
“You seem very well versed in blood spells,” Harry observed.
“Should I wear a tie?” Draco asks.
It was an endurance test not to sigh with relief in front of them. He was so relieved to be done with the lesson, to have a few minutes to collect himself while they practiced, before the next class came in.
He doesn’t know that he can deal with seeing Malfoy so soon after Dean’s comment. He feels distinctly unsettled—and, weirdly, aroused, although that’s probably a relic of how he normally feels around Malfoy. So he turns away from the door and Malfoy on the other side of it. He’ll deal with hair approvals after lunch and so sends his Patronus off to Ron.
“We figured as much,” Neville said. “I asked Draco if he thought his family in Massachusetts had any connections, and he’s going to look into it.”
“This is amazing,” said Lee, peering through the crate slats. “I can’t see anything!”
“Will you share the spell you used with us, Ma’am?” asked Potter, gently.
This is pretty reasonable, but Harry likes to bring it up every chance he can anyway. Because it pisses Draco off. Harry grins, leans in to kiss him. He’s half a mind to undo the cravat so he can watch Draco do it again, but then he feels something hard pressing against his thigh and decides on another course of action. Not at all intended to be a diversion.
Draco was just pissed off.
the endorphins zooming through his veins as he takes in the sight of Malfoy. Malfoy is...utterly perfect. An utterly perfect Veela. Why hasn’t Malfoy made a move on him yet? Is he playing coy? That’s just like a Veela. And Malfoy.
“I hate Ravenclaws,” Harry sighed.
“I know,” he said.
“The World Cup,” he said.
“Like…” Harry trailed off. “What does that mean?”
Draco regards him as one might a Potions experiment that’s gone unexpectedly sentient. Strange, interesting, and possibly worth a Paracelsus Prize.
“He’s got an Adult Convo spell on,” Ginny said.
Hermione nodded as if this made perfect sense to her. “Good point. Design for a short period of time, then…” she said, trailing off. Then, suddenly: “I’ve got it! Do you know what I really wish I’d had eleven years ago? A wedding planner.”
He took a seat near the head, but not so near that she’d have to strain her neck to speak to him. He was overflowing with excitement at the prospect of speaking to the actual Queen of Atlantis—much like a young Bichon Frisé after a toy—and was not going to get sidelined in the conversation due to awkward seating arrangement or having to stand.
. Intelligently designed, but not by any human hand, magical or Muggle. It was so black it sucked in light like a black hole, and it was full of sharp, teeth-like points going straight forward, with a colossal wingspan. There were no windows, no landing gear that he could see—and he looked,
Harry scowls.
“Yes.”
“Be careful, Padma!” Blaise said, swimming down to them.
Harry turned to Draco. “Bring your swim trunks?” he asked casually.
things sort of person.”
“What?!”
. So he flapped his wings and pulled, with his claws still digging into Draco’s barely-there flesh. Draco resisted at first, but Harry was a collector of the dead, and he’d be damned if Draco sodding Malfoy escaped him. He cawed furiously, and Draco scrunched his nose, but did stumble along a few steps when Harry tried to take off again with him still attached.
“Well, many people score points for the team, but only one person decides when the game is over.”
Harry lifted his brows. Even he knew that. “Distilled wine, really.”
“Weasley brought him by the other day. Said he was being pert.”
, Ron asks, and Harry nods, still focusing somewhere in the middle distance, both visually and mentally. Why has it never occurred to him that he could go, too?
That was the problem. None of them did.
It turned out that Hufflepuffs were excellent event hosts. Someone in the house (or maybe just the house itself) had a hook-up with the kitchens; the butterbeer flowed like water and after enough of them, they were all giggly and wobbly.
“Brilliant?” Harry suggested, still undone by Draco’s smile. “Cool? Great? Sexy?” He added the last one because he’d finally perfected Snape’s swirly robe manoeuver and one of these days, Draco was bound to notice. Luna had. Though, perhaps Luna noticing wasn’t necessarily reflective of its obviousness.
Malfoy withdrew his finger, and Harry keened at the loss. Malfoy spread more lubricant on his own shaft, taking care to slick it up from root to tip.
“We’re strange foreigners walking through a capital city that hasn’t seen visitors in millennia. Of course we’re being watched,” said Draco. He did manage to avoid rolling his eyes.
“We’d never work,” Harry said, swallowing. He looked north again, wishing Hermione was here with him for this, or, even better, that he could just go home without having to say it. “You needed the prize money more than she did, but I can’t trust you. I guess I never could.”
Harry doesn’t know where the time goes. He eats mechanically, only half paying attention to the taste of his food or the happy conversation going on around him. By the time everyone’s heading for the Floo and Draco’s eyes are drooping from exhaustion, Harry still hasn’t said anything about his new membership into the Dad Club.
That sort of stubbornness was all that was, currently, keeping him from losing his shit in the middle of a Hogwarts corridor. He was, understandably, quite disturbed by the possibility that the Statute of Secrecy could’ve been damaged in such a startling fashion. All thoughts kept returning to Scorpius, tucked up safely in Astoria’s over-decorated suite. What would happen if Muggles found him? Would they hurt him? Experiment on him? Draco couldn’t stomach the thought.
“By giving up my wand into your protection,” Theo said, “I am giving up my life, heart, and soul also. I trust that you will take care of it as your own, and that it will serve you as it has served me.”
It took Harry a moment to find his voice. And not because the ring was red and gold and purple, but because he’d just realised that his best mate was planning on getting married, and Harry had only got off with another person for the first time a few weeks ago.
“You don’t keep up with me enough, though,” Malfoy continued. “My father paid Astoria Greengrass to have my heir. She divorced me as soon as she was recovered from labour.”
Harry moved off the bed, feeling the need to put distance between them. “You don’t…actually like me then. You aren’t attracted to me.”
“Three Broomsticks this Sunday, yes? Still coming?”
She nodded quickly. “And the caterers?”
. It’s not as if you’ve bound my eternal soul, or whatever this piece of me is, to an eternity at the beck-and-call of Hogwarts itself, is it? Except that is exactly what it is. Let me live, for Merlin’s sake. Without the whinging living to whinge at me.”
“Yeah, do it, Malfoy,” Harry panted. “Do it. Come for me.”
Harry looked up at her, smiling from the cat’s reluctant purrs. His fringe fell aside, and he knew the moment when she spotted his scar.
“Yes,” agreed Draco.
The Obliviators could be seen in many of them, standing back, unable to act. They’d reached Britain’s limit of Obliviations for the year last month; they were forbidden to do their jobs and with the Obliviator Prius O’Dell still on trial for illegal Obliviation, they weren’t attempting their own in full view of photographers. Despite this, they were required to get out of bed and respond to the emergency... even if responding just meant showing up and watching all the Muggles staring dumbfounded at the destruction, or crying helplessly, or desperately trying to rescue people.
“It’s shrunken,” Draco said. Harry glanced at him to find that his blond eyebrows were lifted in a manner which suggested Harry to be an idiot. Harry tapped it with his wand, and the cauldron grew until it was a standard #2, made completely of the pinkish-grey gneiss they’d become so intimate with. He beamed. It was brilliant.
Harry chewed his lip. Snape was stuck to the back of the shed with a Sticking Spell, but had already turned to rummage around in his bookshelves for another reference.
Harry perked up. “Oh, maybe I can give him the one she gave me. Two is always better than one, right? I was going to chuck it in the fire, but I always felt guilty every time I was about to do it.”
“Hey, Professor. You brewing anything today?” asked Albus.
,” Harry said, spinning around and grabbing at his hair with both hands. He paced over to the door and then back, too restless to stand still, to stand next to Malfoy. “I know,” he said again. “But I didn’t see it. Not until—not until I watched. It’s like a Pensieve, these magicboxes. Have you realised? It gives you distance, lets you see things you don’t want to let yourself see when you’re there. Things you’re afraid of seeing.”
Harry shook his head. “Fucking awful.”
He and Lucius are starting to develop this mutual loathing thing that’s really working for Harry. Harry still hasn’t salted any of the food he’s served at the Malfoys’, but he suspects that one day it’ll only be coated in a strong emetic and not professional grade arsenic. They’re getting somewhere comfortable, like they could spend a week-long holiday in the same country and probably both make it home alive afterwards.
There numbers
and it made him want to throw up.
The Chieftess looked back at them over her shoulder as she led them further into the bay. “The cove is bad water,” she said, in a voice that sounded much lovelier underwater. It had a very recognizable Scottish burr, too. “There is no air here.”
Justin nudged Harry with his shoulder, passed him another apple slice, and said, “And how about you, Harry? That sort of thing is often found in Gryffindors, too.”
“Oh, put them anywhere!” Andromeda called, bustling in to give them both a hug.
“And because Malfoy was your partner,” Hermione added, a slight question in her voice.
“You’re ruining the line of my trousers,” Harry says. “Take care of it.”
“Yes, exactly. That’s why I told Potter and his merry band to come over,” Draco said, rolling his own eyes. “Granger, pop those beers open and Potter, I will smother you in your sleep if you don’t put food on this table right now. We had a hell of a Portkey. It’s hurricane season in the Atlantic, apparently.”
“God, you’re awake,” Harry says.
Finally, he spotted it. He waded in further, careful not to step on anyone, and peered in. There were a dozen or so multicolored seahorses swimming about. Harry carefully lowered the tank so that Seabiscuit could see through the glass.
In that moment, Harry’d never felt a more profound guilt than he did for not writing his condolences over the summer. Broken-up (is that what they were?) or not, he should have
Harry’d always wanted to see the Caribbean Sea. He was, at heart, a sea and sun sort of bloke. Draco was not, but he could get over it because they’d just spent a winter in Massachusetts, United States and Harry was well over the virtue of compromise.
“A side branch of the family, I assure you,” said Yaxley, waving his hand dismissively.
Now that surprised Harry. “Maybe I should be a paranoid pure-blood,” he said with a wry laugh. “I’ve gotta admit, I’ve been feeling kinda jumpy. Which is ridiculous, I
“Ron,” Harry said, shaking himself out of these shitty thoughts. He reached out and patted Ron’s hand in a very manly and supportive way. “I love you both. You’re both going to get through this. You’re both always going to be my best friends. And I’m here for you always, anytime. You know that.”
There was a hiss from the painting, and Draco couldn’t help being darkly amused that even in death, Severus couldn’t stand to hear the Dark Lord’s name. The amusement saved him from the mind-bending trepidation Queen Sostrate’s story instilled in him.
He stared up at Draco from much further away than he’d started, and felt elation and cockiness and fucking
His hair floated around his face in lovely, undulating waves, and Harry had to swallow before he could answer. He’d never known Malfoy could look so… so beautiful. He mentally grimaced at his own thoughts.
to change…
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Potter, you have no idea what that word means, do you?” He stretches, yawning, and then turns to throw one leg over Harry’s own. He closes his eyes. Harry is mesmerized.
“I don’t want you,” Harry murmured. “I can’t.”
“There’s just one more thing,” Granger added, and Draco could have jinxed her for not letting them just get this horrid thing over with. “This spell was designed for four casters. We only have three: Harry, Draco, and Millicent. A triad is powerful, but a quad is balanced and represents the four elements, which are important when casting a spell affecting the earth itself. I’ll act as the fourth.”
“It was a precaution,” said Harry. He was so confused by this entire ordeal. Was he going to Azkaban for a couple months or wasn’t he?
Harry exhaled in a rush. He really wasn’t even sure he wanted to live forever, but—there was a certain draw to it, if Draco would be there, too. Downstairs, the Weasleys started counting down to midnight.
which was nice news, although Harry doubted Snape would let him out of his sight for long enough to attend. And frankly, he’d had enough of camping for a while. Draco would probably be interested though, Harry suspected, upon reading on. The English National Team had made it to the playoffs last year, before the war interrupted everything, and Draco’s favourite Chaser, Hermes Kilgore, was on that team.
’ came floating back anyway.
year as DADA professor—Professor Finlay Hound.”
“But there are tribes that still work magic this way,” Draco continued. “Ancient tribes that only master a few dozen spells over their whole lives. They use magic differently. We could visit them, learn how they do it.”
Harry turned away, scowling. Hermione touched his arm, whispered quickly, “Harry maybe you should see if one of the other men could do the same? You need someone to compare him to before you get too worked up.”
Harry tapped his wand to the WiFi search on his screen, waited for the spinner to stop. A list of available networks popped up and he sighed in relief. They’d moved further into the forest after talking to Snape, and he wasn’t sure how far Hermione’s magic-to-WiFi spell could range. Harry chose the network at the top (“Cornish-Chicks”) and tapped again to sneak in without a password.
“I knew it,” he muttered, in Miguela’s pretty voice. “It’s rather harder to concentrate on an assignment when you’re panicking about your
gone,” Draco says, face blank.
Harry nodded. “Definitely.” Malfoy was his challenge. “I mean, surface level, he’s hardworking and loyal, if you look at his marks in school and his devotion to his family. But that can’t be all there is to it. Is his work ethic and his loyalty enough to override how incredibly stupid and reckless he is sometimes? Is it more defining than his love of puzzles?”
“Nope,” said Harry. “You’ll find out when I bid. I won’t give away my strategy just yet.”
in those.
, I’m attracted to you!” Malfoy said, finally meeting his eyes. “God, Potter. I’ve been attracted to you since we were fourteen.”
Magic pulled into him and out of him like Atlantean waves. He could feel Potter’s magic mingling with his own again—and Granger’s and Millicent’s too. He knew their magic intimately and completely in a way he’d never even known his own before. And he knew they felt his, too. It felt freeing and vulnerable at the same time.
“But—patrolling for what?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Draco muttered.
Mr Granger perked up at this. “I bet they segment their research staff. If they’ve really been trying to reintegrate themselves on our planet, they’ll have wanted to understand how we’ve evolved without their influence, and they’ll have people studying all the major cultures.”
When their light became so bright that Harry could see it behind his closed eyelids, they stopped. It didn’t take any verbal or visual cue – they just knew. By now, they’d done so many rituals together that their magic knew, and if their magic knew, they knew it, too. The magic hung heavy in the air, a weight pressing down on them from all sides. The ancient druids’ tethering ritual was on the verge of being torn asunder, freed from the chains of dying flowers.
“How do you feel, Harry?” Luna yelled at him. He spun away from Malfoy, eyes wide. Miles was with Luna, filming them both. How much had they seen? How much had they filmed?
, wouldn’t you, champ? I’ll show you all the fun things Aurors do and then when you’re all grown up, maybe you can be an Auror, too.”
It had a faint hint of fish. Padma turned green again, but Blaise saved them all with a spectacular bit of air-freshening charmwork. They were just getting on the road for DC when Harry’s mobile rang. He saw Lee’s face on the screen and answered it warily.
But mostly—Malfoy.
“The brandy.”
“Who is your nephew?”
“We want them to associate your spring/summer line with something they love, obviously.”
“Of course I made it, you twat,” said Millicent Bulstrode. “I said I’d come and I’ve come.”
sacrifice.”
Harry stops rambling. “Yeah?”
“And you, Malfoy,” Harry said, staring at him. “I’m surprised you didn’t kick up more of a fuss over this assignment.”
Madam Pince appeared aggrieved when he asked where the Potions section was. She pointed wordlessly, and Harry followed the gesture to the north corner of the library where the wall sconces seemed to be struggling against the shadows.
“And of course, this year’s batch of apprentices—Hermione Granger and Millicent Bulstrode, both of whom Professor Vector has agreed to take on; Harry Potter, fulfilling a rather unconventional apprenticeship under Professor Snape; Luna Lovegood, whose remarkable proposal convinced Professor Flitwick to take her on without a gap year; Neville Longbottom, under Professor Sprout, Emrys Cadwallader, now entering his second year under Professor Hagrid, and Draco Malfoy, who will be continuing the most beautiful and majestic magic of Transfigurations, under myself.”
Brows scrunched all around. Harry took the opportunity to slide closer to Draco until their hips and shoulders were touching. Draco smirked at him. He grabbed Harry’s hand and rubbed his fingers slowly back and forth over Harry’s knuckles as they listened to Justin talk.
Draco smirked. “I must admit I’m looking forward to watching Theo jump from a broom.”
Hermione clears her throat quickly. “Pêche au vin, please.”
“You people do like to rescue everything even when it’s unnecessary,” Draco commented. Then, to the fireplace: “Kitchens! Send up whatever the staff had today, for two please. Yes, thanks.”
“You,” Draco pants against his mouth, but he doesn’t finish the sentence.
“Of course there’s a curse,” said Anthony, who didn’t appear to have a problem with where his window faced. Harry doubted he’d be looking out it much anyway. “There’s a book of expanded Hogwarts history in Ravenclaw Tower that talks about it. Dated to no later than 600 A.M., that’s
On this particular gloriously hangover-free Saturday, Harry chose the middle stall as usual, as he liked being equidistant from all escape routes. He was basking in the perfectly heated and scented water when the door from the boys’ side opened and the shower next to him turned on. Lavender, citrus, and frankincense. There was only one Hufflepuff with such a particular shower combination. Harry would like to pretend that he hadn’t noticed Malfoy’s distinctive scent, but being so close to the other man all day now made that a lie. Last night, with Malfoy so close to him, touching him, it had been all Harry could smell. With all the butterbeer and food in the Sett, he'd inhaled nothing but Malfoy, and surely there was something wrong with that.
“How are you feeling?” Dennis asked him, camera only feet from Harry’s face. The glare from the light never really seemed to fade.
Malfoy turned back to Harry, smirking.
, Mr Potter?” said McGonagall tersely. “You
“Don’t worry, kidlet,” Harry said. “I got you a present, too, and you won’t get a chance to shake it before you open it.”
. Things are progressing quite fast.”
Harry walked forward, feeling brush and leaves crunch beneath his shoes.
a secret from him.
“I want all of you in here at three today for a briefing. I’ve only got 30 minutes so make sure you’re on time this time. The Blue and Orange lines are single-tracking again. Take an Uber.”
They had to recombine the sulphur-infused quartz, the Poison, and the calcined ash. The question was how. Harry wanted to use fire, but he had no idea what ingredients composed Poison, and that was just asking for death.
Draco sneered, habitual and forced. “How could that be freedom when I’d just be controlled by whatever pathetic emotions developed from it?”
Harry grimaced. “Yeah. Wasn’t flattering.”
On Bring Your Child to Work Day, there was a struggle over the rightful ownership of one Edward Remus Lupin, a child of seven years. Though he was the recognised godson of Harry Potter, he was also the recognised heir of his cousin, Draco Malfoy. As Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were partnered together as Junior Aurors in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and would therefore be, in theory, taking Teddy to the same place, the true owner of the child was unimpressed by the squabbling.
“Hmm.”
“I see,” said Narcissa, her hand back over her mouth.
…what in the world?” She peered into it, and then took an involuntary step back, eyes wide. Her mouth trembled, and then she forced herself to look away.
“It’s
“Potter, what’s your good side?” asked Miles.
Her kits cuddle into her, little bright white blotches against laboured-grey breathing, sharing their warmth even as they drink from her. Harry stands in the doorway, stunned, thoughtful.
“I like this dude,” Kyle said to Draco, hooking his thumb in Harry’s direction. “He goes with the flow. You’d do great here in the MUS, Harry. Way less stuffy than England.”
And Harry knows he knows. His breath shudders again and he grits his teeth but the answer comes out anyway. “Yes.” He swallows. “I’m so fucking angry.”
She smiled at him again. “I know, Harry. Thank you. I may just do that.” She sipped her cappuccino again and said briskly, “So, tell me what’s wrong with you. I saw you watching Malfoy.”
They’ve only known about this pregnancy for three weeks, and it’s really fucking weird and there’ve been like four cases of male pregnancy without taking a strict fertility potions regimen in the history of the world
“You are restless,” she said. “You desire change, maybe chaos…for your lives to be more than living, for finding some higher magic to life itself. You will not be disappointed in your chosen paths. They are good for those of us who look for something higher than money in our vocations.”
“Upstairs with Sigourney and Scorpius,” said Petunia, as she poured him a cup of tea with three sugars, neatly ignoring Dudley’s and Millicent’s twin looks of disapproval. Petunia flicked her wand and sent everyone’s cup floating to them.

be taking advantage of me.”
“Hermione and I have been looking up the locations of all the major tribes,” said Padma. “We think it would be a good idea to visit each of them, to make sure we have a full understanding of their concerns so we can create a comprehensive plan of action.”
Draco frowned at him. “Taking Teddy to the train. What are you doing here?”
Winter Solstice arrived, and with it, the morning of Padma and Theo’s wedding. Harry woke up with a tremble that had nothing at all to do with the shitty warming charms in Grimmauld Place. Draco was still sleeping, which was unusual in itself. He was normally the first to wake.
“I need help. From you.”
“Where do they go?” Draco asked, careful not to touch a single one now, though he was sure his father had set them all up with an activation word by now.
“I think he’s more concerned with being in the same house as Neville, actually,” Harry said, thinking the evening over. Malfoy had wondered (read: complained) aloud several times where Neville was last night. “Although Neville doesn’t seem to give many fucks. Anyway – Malfoy’s been tolerable, but it’s only been twelve hours, so just give it until lunch. I’m still stunned that he’s in Hufflepuff.”
“Shaadhon always knows when you’re coming,” says a now very familiar voice at the same time that Harry is almost knocked over by the force of an excited juvenile Manticore jumping up his legs. “He likes your magic, I think.”
Quickly recovered, Boot moved onto his next topic: “By the way, did anyone see that pair of knickers on the goal posts? Hooch was up there this morning trying to get them down, but they were stuck pretty good.”
on Draco’s cock?
Draco didn’t respond at all, but it seemed to Harry that his shoulders stiffened some. Which part provoked it, Harry couldn’t say. It couldn’t have been the last bit;
“Didn’t like the crowd,” said Draco. “Not really my thing.”
Lee shrugged and bit into it, chewing thoughtfully. Harry took the opportunity to test his water with a quick, inconspicuous charm. The results didn’t shock him, but he did curl his lip a bit. Always so much chlorine!
