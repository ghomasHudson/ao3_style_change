“Yeah, it was good. I’m good. Great actually.” his words are forced, but he knows the boys won't notice it. Hermione and Ron, sure, but not them. “So you two? You’re…”
In a puff of dust that caught in the golden sunlight, Ron fell onto his own bed, holding the letter high above his head. Harry just stared at him, eyes narrowed behind his glasses. Ron was going back, no question. He would do anything Hermione told him to, he was so stupidly in love with the girl. They had only been official for a few months, but their love for each other had run so deep and for so long that it was like they had been together for their whole lives.
The platform was crowded, and people kept bumping into his trolley, nearly upsetting his luggage a few times and upsetting the small snake curled up in its cage. His ability to speak parseltongue had mostly vanished with the removal of Voldemort’s soul, but some remained and he chose to teach himself what he couldn't naturally remember. When he had found the small sunbeam snake in Diagon Alley, he fell in love with it. After one harsh bump, he opened the cage and Abacus curled around his arm. Hermione shot him a small smile as she noticed.
“Well, someone’s in a good mood today.” she said with a laugh, kissing his cheek once he set her down.
hey all! sorry for taking forever to update this, my laptop broke and i only recently got a new one. i hope you enjoy this chapter, and hopefully i'll be updating regularly from now on. let me know what you think!!
The letter was on aged parchment, the same as every Hogwarts letter he had ever received. Green ink, spiky letters, the Y in his name looping around on itself. There was nothing different about this letter. So why was he so surprised to be holding it? Harry shook his head, a little bewildered by the paper in his hand. A formal invitation to return to Hogwarts for an eighth year, to finish up the schooling Voldemort had taken from him. He sat down heavily on his bed, wondering what to do. The question was very nearly answered for him when a tall redhead burst into the room they shared.
“Are they going to be okay by themselves?” He asked, curious about how the three would do when left alone with their grief and no one else.
Dean presses a kiss to Seamus’s temple. “Hey, what can I say? Near-death makes you realize things.” Seamus’s laugh was bright and beautiful, and his response kiss to Dean’s cheek was sweet.
“And why am I not surprised to see you two together? You’ve been inseparable since the War ended.” Ron laughs, and Hermione chimes in too. Harry just stares at them blankly, unsure of what to say. He had not known the two were inseparable. What else had he missed while he was locked in the house?
But when the carriage he shared with Ginny, Neville, and Luna swung around the corner and he saw Hogwarts for the first time since the war, his heart stopped momentarily. His throat closed up, and all he could think of was the death that had filled that old castle, the screams that had rang through the night. Screams of pain, of grief, of horrible raging anger.
Harry nodded, his head heavy. He felt guilty for everything this wonderful family had endured for him, and he realized with a small pang of pain that him leaving the house would mean he wasn't a burden. Turning to look at Ginny, he smiled softly. “I guess I’ll come back then. I’ll tag along with everyone to King’s Cross, get myself back into the swing of normal life.” His smile was little more than a ghost when Ginny threw her arms around him, and he was glad she couldn't see it fade.
Draco Malfoy stares at them for a moment before shooting straight up and running out of the compartment. After a quick exchange of looks, the three shrug and take their seats. Ron and Hermione quickly start talking, but Harry can’t stop thinking about the fear that had flashed across Malfoy’s face when he saw them. Sure, they were not friends, but Harry had testified for him at the trial that had taken place over the summer. Had testified for both him and Narcissa. She had saved his life, after all. He had owed her a debt. He had thought that would at least earn him a simple “Hello” from the boy.
“Here we are indeed.” she takes his hand in hers, and he sighs happily. Maybe all of his worries were unfounded. He should never have been stressed to come back, scared of dredging up old, awful memories. It was all going to be fine, he knew that now.
“No, of course not. I just never saw it coming.” he smiles, then looks at the time. “Ack, we should get on the train, it’s ten to.”
“I don't know mate, I’ll have to think it over.” Hogwarts had been the place of so many sorrows for Harry, and he knew it had been for Ron too. But the thought of stepping back in the stone halls of the place that had turned from home to tomb was a thought Harry wasn't quite ready to accept. “I’m gonna go for a walk, I’ll be back for supper. Tell your mum to not wait up for me.”
“Harry, Ron, Hermione!” a shout comes from off to the side, and when all three of their heads turn, they spot Dean running towards them, dragging a breathless Seamus behind him. “Why am I not surprised to see you three together?”
He was about to crumple the letter in his fist when a familiar flowery scent washed over him and Ginny settled onto the ground next to him. Her head soon became a soft weight on his shoulder, one that was not unwelcome but felt strange nonetheless. Their relationship was unsure, nothing confirmed or denied. His mind wasn't in the place for a relationship, but he enjoyed spending his time with her when they could sneak away from Molly’s watching eyes.
The group scrambles to get their things loaded onto the train, trying to find an empty compartment for the five of them. When none are to be found, Seamus and Dean split off and go sit with some eighth year Ravenclaws and the trio find themselves standing at the entrance to a mostly empty compartment. Inside, there is a hunched figure curled up under the window, quill darting across a piece of parchment spread across their lap. Not knowing who it is, Ron knocks on the glass to get their attention. When the head snaps up, everyone in the trio stiffens.
Oh. That’s something he missed. His cheeks heated. He had been so lost in himself that he had missed the lives of his friends progressing. Casting his gaze down, he stares at the rainbow shimmer in Abacus’ scales. Rainbow seems appropriate for the moment, he thinks with a small laugh. When he looks up again, he sees that all eyes are trained on him
“You got one too mate? We’re going back, yeah?” Ron’s tall form stood in the doorway, his blue eyes wide and a smile on his lips. “Hermione will be so pleased, she’s been hoping that we’d get a chance to go back, she’s so school obsessed. I wouldn't be surprised if she flooed over here later to talk about it. At the very least, she’ll write to us telling us we have no choice but to go back. You know how she is.”
“Are you going to come back in September?” Her voice was soft, as familiar as Ron’s. “I know Ron is, and I’ll be going. If you don't come, you’ll be left here with mum, dad, and George. I know you would never have a problem with that, but being alone with them seems like a lot of sadness in one house.” Her voice lilted up in a sort of half laugh, and Harry grinned a little despite himself.
And then he was screaming, screaming, screaming, and there were hands on his face, his hair, his arms, holding him, trying to calm him, trying to stop the blood curdling screams that were spilling out of his mouth, but it wasn't until a soft, barely familiar voice muttered a spell that sent a wave of calm over him did he finally stop, did he snap out of it. As someone pressed a cool glass bottle to his lips and a sleeping potion was forced down his throat, he caught a glimpse of cool silver eyes locked on his.
Ginny thought for a moment, “Yeah, I think Bill and Fleur are going to move back for a few months, just to make sure everything is going smoothly without us. They’re leery about leaving them alone too. Without Freddie, George isn’t doing well, hell none of us are, but George most of all. Mum doesn’t know what to do. I almost think having all of use out of the house might help. She could devote her time to George instead of all of us.”
The swirling steam of the Hogwarts Express was as familiar to Harry as the back of his own hand, but he found it taking his breath away nonetheless. He had never thought he would be back there, yet here he was. Hand gripped tightly by Hermione, Ron grinning brightly on the other side of her as he looked all over for their friends. They had received letters over the summer, talking about who was coming back and who wasn't. Out of the Gryffindor kids, there was Seamus, Dean, Neville returning. Parvati had never said for sure, and Lavender had been in St. Mungo’s since the war ended. He had no idea about any of the other houses, as he was never really friends with any of them.
And as she kissed him and they fell back into the long grass, he was glad that she could not see into his head, which was repeating the words
I slammed the heavy door behind me, slipped out of my shoes. With a relieved sigh, I headed to the living room, where I had a fireplace.
But I was in for a surprise. Standing on my porch, more mature than in my memories but still quite recognizable, was Harry Potter. I was so stunned I forgot to take my burnt finger out of my mouth.
“I’ll stand by probation,” I replied readily. To be honest, after two hours of back and forth I felt nothing but a new-found respect for Potter’s calm and professional arguments. Perhaps, working with him wouldn’t be so bad after all.
He kissed Harry hastily on the corner of his lips and ran off. Harry sat on the bed for a bit, playing with the torn corner of his birth certificate. The cat leapt on his knees with a soft purr, and Harry scratched its ears, wondering if the corner was already torn when he got there, or if he should be blaming the fluffy one. He stroked the cat for a bit, then finally got up and went to ask Iris for the address.
The first and most important inconvenience was the fact that I had to settle down in a Muggle neighbourhood. I would never have thought that I would one day learn a minimum of household charms and handle simple cooking and cleaning. Nevertheless, here I am.
“Chickened out, Potter?” I enquired snarkily. For some reason, I wanted this interaction to last a little longer. Arguments with Potter reminded me of carefree times, which was strangely soothing.
“This is the queer safe space,” Finn said. “We’ve been going here since Steph opened the bar five years ago.”
After work, I decided to have a pint in one of my favourite bars. It seemed like Potter’s got himself a girl – or at least it was definitely going to happen soon – which reminded me that I hadn’t had sex in quite a long time, what with all the finals and the job interviews. Fortunately, I was always attractive enough to find a girl to dance with for the evening, and often more than dance, if I got lucky. I’d been doing so for the last couple of years and was never disappointed. The same happened tonight – I spotted a pretty brunette, and within several hours I was already at her place. While pulling off her dress, I thought to myself that I was pretty damn lucky to be attractive.
I glanced at him, thinking that referring to Umbridge would be enough to contain Malfoy’s urge to bicker. But instead, I heard him chuckle.
By three o’clock I was so fed up with reports and series of questions, that Harper’s suggestion to go speak to Alan Mann felt like a liberation. I hadn’t thought of the paperwork when I applied for the job at the investigation department. I hope I’ll get used to it.
The kitchen was a busy mess: Tony was baking something, so all of the surfaces were covered with either ingredients or bowls full of batter.
“Tinky,” I heard Malfoy say, and a crack of Apparition followed – he must have summoned a house elf. “Bring me dinner, please. Oh, and make it a big dish, I’m hungry.”
On my way back home, I saw Melissa chatting with some colleagues in a café. I smiled at her and she smiled back, but I didn’t stop to say hello: groups of girls still scared the shit out of me. I will never forget the day when I accidentally overheard Hermione, Ginny and Luna discussing some guy who was hitting on Hannah Abbot. With all due respect, girls can be mean, so I decided that I could always talk to Melissa later.
“Some old-fashioned Gryffindor hypocrisy. It reminds me of the good old days,” he gave me yet another condescending look.
Harry thought of the ministry workers and their tired faces, the Auror raids, the reports and the awkwardness with Ginny.
“I guess I never really thought about it. I always had more pressing issues to deal with, and then there was Ginny.”
I keep the Floo powder in the cupboard - another one of the consequences of living among Muggles. Last time a neighbour came in – she was out of salt – and asked me what it was. Of course, I got away with it. I guess I told her it was powdered quartz. But then I had to come up with an explanation of why I needed powdered quartz… If it wasn’t for my skill of winning people over when necessary, she and her incessant questions might have stuck around all afternoon. Since that day I lock everything up. Just in case.
Several hours passed by. Finally, I put my notes aside. My stomach was empty, and I figured it was time for dinner.
“Fuck this, I’m out. But if you,” Tony pointed at Harry, “dare call me a ‘he’, you are never coming back here again.”
Arguments then became inevitable at least twice a day: during breakfast and supper, the two meals father never missed and forced me to attend. Of course, I’m not one of those who stand by the truth at all costs, but even I couldn’t take this any longer. That’s when Mum decided that it would be better for me to live elsewhere.
I arrived at the office and was immediately buried under the paperwork necessary to prepare for the hearing. Mann’s trial was planned for tomorrow, as well as the other “easy” cases, as Harper called them.
“Only complete idiots don’t like the loaded national hero. But when it comes to an ordinary public defender…”
“Technically it’s a friend’s house. But they have a bar there,” Draco answered, slipping into his sneakers. “I’m really sorry, I’m awfully late. Iris can give you the address.”
Draco closed his eyes for a long second, and Harry wondered in what specific words he was cursing his employer in his head. Finally, Draco sighed and sat up.
“Draco told me you were usually here on Sundays. I came to give you this,” Harry explained and handed her the certificate. “Take your time, I don’t need it right now.”
If someone asked Harry what he was doing here, he would struggle with an answer, although his memory was perfectly fine. It’s just that he wouldn’t be able to explain his actions with the usual pragmatic reasons. He wasn’t on a mission, he wasn’t working undercover, he wasn’t meeting a friend. Damn, he couldn’t even blame it on Dennis – his colleague – who usually tried to get him into some weird-looking places with the basic excuse of all time: “I’m curious.”
She waved her wand, and a parchment appeared out of thin air. Harry ran his eyes down the long roll – she was right. The bar was perfectly legal. Harry turned back to Emmet.
“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll kill you. I am a former Death Eater,” I smirked and noted to myself that he really hadn’t changed a lot, at least as far as I was concerned.
I only managed to collect myself in the evening. That’s when I realised: I had to move out of the dorm tomorrow, and still hadn’t found a new place to live. The mere image of Grimmauld place gave me a strong desire to sleep outside or to invite myself to Ron and Hermione’s, who were about to move in together. Surely, I had to show up on Grimmauld place, 12 - otherwise that old rascal Kreacher was absolutely capable of thinking I’m dead and inviting some purebloods to the house to take my place – but I was determined to waste no more than ten minutes there. I promised myself to find a quick solution to my housing problem and got in the shower.
“You shouldn’t speak with your mouth full, Potter. Even if it’s full of toothpaste,” he couldn’t help smiling. I caught my reflexion in the mirror and snorted: there was toothpaste all over my chin. Point taken.
“Bennet won’t accept it, apparently. I found out a few days ago that he told the staff I was taking a week off.”
Harry didn’t answer. It was Malfoy – there was no way Harry would not recognise him – but it wasn’t the Malfoy he was used to at Hogwarts. The expensive suit was gone; instead, he was wearing baggy clothes and a pair of sneakers, his nose was pierced, and a magic tattoo shimmered on his neck. Wow, those were unexpected changes.
“By the way, Harry, what did you decide about the house?” asked Hermione. “You’ll definitely have to live there now.”
I started enjoying Potter’s presence. The self-assured boy I used to be came to the surface, and I started speaking just as I used to in Hogwarts. To be honest, it was easier this way: as soon as I put on the old mask, everything went back to normal.
“Then you probably should let him know,” Malfoy leaned on the wall and took another sip, looking at Harry, who was surprised to discover that the genuine interest in Malfoy’s eyes didn’t shock him anymore.
Home was soothing in Potter’s absence. I drank a cup of coffee, picked up the book on ordinary crimes that I once found very useful and settled down on the couch. That was when Potter arrived with the “wonderful” news. Technically, first he just arrived and annoyed me with his chattiness, and only then announced that “we will have to learn how to tolerate each other”. Thankfully, after this revelation he went upstairs and left me alone.
“See you, Harry,” Annalise waved before stepping in the fireplace with Finn. Harry waved back, and they disappeared in the flames.
“I wasn’t really expecting an answer,” chuckled Potter. In a swift movement that made me think that he was used to cooking he put the eggs and the bacon on a plate and sat down in front of me. He looked amusing: even more dishevelled than usual, with red marks of the pillow all over his cheek. He began to eat, paying zero attention to my interested gaze. The smell of freshly fried eggs went up my nostrils; if it was Theo or Greg, I would have demanded a bite by now, but there was no way I’d ask Potter to share. So I had no choice but to get up and take care of myself.
They sat in silence for a minute or so, and this time it felt natural. Harry wanted to ask Malfoy how he managed to convince his family that the life he had chosen for himself was worth it, but it seemed to be an intimate topic, so Harry kept the question to himself.
The silence was a bit awkward. Annalise sipped from her bottle and glanced at Finn. Harry started putting the figures back into the box.
And if I managed to control myself that evening, the next day – Sunday – we ended up having a real fight. It started off with me saying something deprecating of Potter’s sacred friends. I didn’t even notice that I’d crossed the line until I ended up with Potter’s wand within an inch of my nose.
“Hello,” she smiled at Potter. “Mr. Potter, I work in the archive. I came by to tell you that you should submit copies of your reports to me or my colleague.”
“You’re getting more and more impudent,” he grunted, when I turned the tap on and started washing my face. I turned to look at him: he stood in the doorway, rubbing his neck.
Mr. Harper used to teach at the Auror office during my third year of studies, and we got along pretty well. So when the time came for me to look for a job, he offered to hire me as his assistant, the position being conveniently vacant.
Draco’s eyes were watery, the edges of his nostrils red, but he was smiling. Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, leaned over and kissed him. Malfoy moved closer and ran his hands down Harry’s back, which sent a shiver down Harry's spine. The kiss became more and more impatient, Harry could feel his heart racing, and Draco was clearly out of breath.
“Oh,” Harry realised he didn’t even think of them as a couple. “I didn’t know they were together. Anyway, it sucks that they can’t get married.”
Several hours later he left the crowd, soaking wet after dancing so long, and headed to the pavilion to get himself a drink. As he approached the entrance, a skinny guy with purple hair drew his attention: he was standing with his back to Harry, smoking. The sight of the cigarette and the casual way the guy flicked the ashes reminded Harry of how he used to smoke about once a week – that was before Hermione had lectured him on the outcomes. Suddenly, Harry realised that right now he didn’t give a fuck about the odds of developing lung cancer, and went over to the guy.
“Never mind, Potter, you’re welcome here,” he said. “This is my flatmate Tony, they’re also the drummer in our band.”
I took my time to walk home. Over the last six months I had gotten used to this apartment, even though it was in the heart of Muggle London. Living next to Muggles has not proven itself contagious, contrary to my grandparents’ beliefs. I also found out one could use magic as usual on the condition of not forgetting to lock the door, charm the windows, and avoid getting friendly with the neighbours. These simple rules were a direct result of mistakes I made during my first week here - I even had to correct the memories of several a tad too nosy people.
The cat started purring and rubbed its head against Malfoy’s chin. Harry couldn’t help smiling, looking at the expression of pure delight on Draco’s face.
It was hardly a half an hour walk to Eaton Mews, but it took me an hour, the reality of living with Malfoy still being somewhat uncomfortable.
The elf Disapparated, and I went back into the kitchen. A large round tray full of food was waiting on the table.
I put my robes around my shoulders and rushed through the corridor and down the stairs of the investigation department, trying to catch up with Harper’s quick pace.
As much as I hated to admit it, Potter’s words about acting childish had hit the target. I decided I’d not lower myself to that level any more. My Slytherin nature quickly found a way out: our deal said nothing about insulting Potter. Yes, it’ll definitely be fun having him here.
I was half convinced that my large amount of conditions wouldn’t do for Potter and that he’d start arguing, but, to my surprise     , none of that happened.
“Modest, of course,” I nodded. “If a girl likes a modest public defender, then it’s definitely about him, not the corpse of the Dark Lord.”
“No, I’m going to his place,” Tony replied, now adding something to one of the bowls. “Wish me luck.”
“Um,” Harry hesitated a bit and turned around just in time to see a black guy wearing high heels hit the stage. “Can I chip in for the singer instead?”
“Are you kidding me, the last day’s the best!” the barman retorted. “It’s not even 10 pm, the main set’s about to start, it’s perfect timing.”
“Yes and no,” Finn pulled out some tobacco and a filter and started to roll a cigarette. “There’s a series of spells which basically lets you know stuff about your heredity, but you’re right, only Muggles call that a DNA test.”
Harry took a drag on his cigarette, not really knowing what to say. He never asked himself what he wanted. He was so busy thinking of responsibilities and duty, he’d never had the time to think of himself.
Harry left Malfoy’s flat at the same time as Annalise and Finn and promised to drop by with the birth certificate. The next day he woke up at noon, back at Grimmauld place. He got up, showered, wrote a letter to Bennet, then to Ron and Hermione, asking if they were free – he couldn’t wait to tell them about the party, Annalise, and, of course, Draco. Hermione owled back almost at once, apologising and saying they were still out of town. Disappointed, Harry tried to read, but couldn’t stay concentrated: his thoughts slipped, and he found himself thinking of the party again and again. Finally, he decided to go back to Malfoy’s with the birth certificate – he did promise to bring it soon, so it seemed to be the perfect excuse to see each other again.
wine!” Harry waved his wand, hoping there was another bottle in the cupboard. A loud noise down the hall indicated that the spell worked. Hermione let out a muffled “Yes!” when she saw a bottle of red fly into Harry’s hand.
Harry found it a bit difficult to concentrate, as Draco’s shoulder was touching his own, and, once again, he had a perfect view of the tattoo on Draco’s neck. In the daylight it looked even better: the dotted work went perfectly well with the pale, freckled skin. Harry forced himself not to stare.
“That sucks. Well, I’m sure you could find something on the black market,” Harry suggested, which made Tony, who came back with the plates, laugh out loud.
A last loud bang – Harry recognized Bombarda – and the gate flew open. A group of Aurors marched into the yard, wands out, and started casting spells at whoever was still within reach; people started running, and Harry got a weird sense that the situation wasn’t new to anyone: the Aurors were too calm, the people at the bar dodged the spells too well. This was definitely not something Harry’d expected to happen. He felt his blood rush up to his cheeks. He couldn’t think of an excuse of what was going on: even if the bar wasn’t paying its taxes, the people on the dance floor had nothing to do with it. But the Aurors continued to shoot
“I don’t really like other bars. I suppose we could all go to our place, but we have nothing to eat, I guess…”
“Hi,” he replied automatically. I loosened my tie and sat down in the armchair, stretching my legs. First, Malfoy didn’t react to my presence, but after about two minutes let out an irritated sigh.
“Making eggs and bacon. I don’t know about you, but I can’t get through the morning with only a glass of milk,” he answered without turning around. “Did you sleep well? Or is that none of my business?”
To say I was surprised to see Malfoy on that doorstep would have been an understatement. I couldn’t figure out why the hell I was staring at that once-hated face. The only bright thing about the situation was that the former Slytherin didn’t look too happy either. He spent some time trying to find out what I wanted from him. What could I possibly want from him?! Oh yeah – a room.
“People drink milk from a glass, not from the bottle,” he explained, turning to look at me with an expression on his face that clearly meant I was stupid. I sighed, but decided not to argue.
“Ron, stop it!” Hermione interrupted him. “Is this really the part you’re focusing on? Harry, did you say the Aurors raided the queer bar?”
“If you make me some coffee, I’ll make enough eggs for both of us. Will that do?” I inquired sarcastically.
It’s kind of phenomenal how the bastard always finds a way to get it out of me. In the last years, I had dealt with many people who were far from agreeable, and I never had to pull my wand – words were always enough. I guess the remains of childhood hatred must have made it to the surface.
“I have to go. See you later,” I muttered as I went out of the elevator. I couldn’t stand imposing myself.
“Did you get Alan Mann’s case? Don’t answer: I know you did. Malfoy, this is fate. We will definitely have to learn how to tolerate each other.”
I must have completely lost my mind due to solitude if I got this crazy idea in the first place. I placed an ad in a newspaper saying that I was renting a room. I only had two visitors during the week: a bossy lady and some forty year old man. As I was searching for company rather than money, so I didn’t accept either one.
Harry still didn’t understand, but he didn’t want to push Malfoy, who was already stressed out because of his father. Finally, Draco started speaking.
“I’m sorry,” he said, taking Draco’s hand. “On the bright side, you get to do whatever you want with your hair.”
“Yeah, we’ll have to wait till there’s a trans potioneer for that,” Annalise concluded. “In the meantime, I’m stuck with the Muggles. By the way, anyone knows what a birth certificate is supposed to look like?”
“I know – I figured maybe it’s your grandparents’ house. Since it obviously is an old pureblood house,” Annalise explained.
“How come you don’t want your family heritage?” Harry asked. “I mean, I understand it perfectly, it’s just that you were so… sure about it before.”
Harry hadn’t heard this particular annoyed voice before. He looked up to see a tall girl who was passive aggressively rolling her wand between her fingers. She had long brown hair with an undercut; the cat-eye make-up only emphasized the suspicious look she gave Harry.
I had no choice but to sigh resignedly: if Ron decided we were going to have fun, nothing could possibly stop him.
A Monday morning wasn’t an appropriate time to dwell on the situation, especially because today was my first day at work. So I pushed away my thoughts on yesterday’s incident in the kitchen that almost led to a duel, stood up, put my pants on and dragged myself to the bathroom which next to my room.
An Apparition crack in the living room cut Harry short. He was about to ask if Draco was expecting somebody, but there was no need.
“Shut up, Tony, this is not going to happen. It’s my place too, okay?” Draco hissed as he entered the living room right in time to see Harry’s embarrassed expression. Showing up at Malfoy’s was awkward enough even without witnessing a scene.
She looked at me, waiting for an answer. I winced: a year ago or so she forced me to rearrange things at Grimmauld place. We got rid of the elf heads, changed the wallpaper and the upholstery and so on, but to me the house remained one of the most unpleasant places on Earth. I felt better in the cupboard under the stairs, if you ask me. Hermione was driven by the thought that it was my only house, and that I would end up living there one day, but I was in no hurry. Sirius died six years ago, and I was constantly stumbling upon things that reminded me of him - not to mention the headquarters of the Order, where every single object used to belong to him.
“Sorry, it’s really not about you,” Draco said. “Tony’s just pissed that I didn’t let them know I invited you to the party. It’s going to be fine, trust me. Oh, but you really should use the “they” pronoun with Tony. You can’t imagine the number of people who get this wrong, that’s where all of this is coming from.”
The chill air made him shiver. He sat down on the ground and dragged Draco with him, hugging him with one arm. Malfoy closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“DRACO!” Iris yelled, paying no attention whatsoever to Harry’s attempts of being polite. “Sorry, you were saying?”
Harry touched the glowing Apparition coordinates and tried to figure out why the idea of going to a concert was so tempting. He had never been to a festival before: Ron and Hermione weren’t outdoor people – which was totally understandable, keeping in mind the number of journalists chasing them around – and Ginny was always at some sports event. Well, and even when she was there, something felt wrong. Either way, going to a concert didn’t seem like a good idea – Harry still had to finish the report on the last mission, and sleeping before work wasn’t generally a bad thing…
“Yes, you are. That apartment belongs to me. I will show you the place and change the protection charms, so that Lucius won’t be able to find you there.”
Potter shook his head in disbelief, then took the watch and answered, “Well, better you get the venom out of your system now than at work.”
For a brief second Malfoy looked at me with such undisguised astonishment that I almost felt bad for him.
It was uncomfortable to realise that Malfoy was right. Since Umbridge and her evil quill, telling the truth no matter what has been one of my principles, so Malfoy pointing out an obvious lie was unsettling.
I shrugged and went upstairs: I still had to prepare my speech for the hearing. I changed into my old but comfortable jeans and t-shirt and sat down on the bed with the rolls of parchment. But the bed was too soft, and within five minutes I understood that I was unable to concentrate. I hesitated for some time, then grabbed my notes and went downstairs. Malfoy eyed me as I sat down in the armchair, but didn’t say anything.
“Sold,” Annalise jumped to her feet and headed to the gate, dragging Finn with her. Harry chuckled and followed.
“If you’re into this kind of stuff, you should go here,” the guy picked up a flyer on the bar and handed it to Harry. “Today’s the last day of the festival, you shouldn’t miss it.”
“Okay, people,” he announced, “this is Harry, he’s having a bit of a rough time these days, so I invited him over. Harry, these are my friends, Annalise and Finn.”
“I’d bet anything the House-elves tracked me down,” Draco said in an irritated voice. “I hate it when he takes me by surprise. It always gets to me.”
“It’s a Muggle neighbourhood,” he reminded, but I still didn’t understand, so he added: “We only use magic if necessary. Besides, if we never leave the house, it’ll be suspicious. And the neighbours here are nosy, believe me.”
“I get it. I used to hate this house so much. Sirius hated it, too. Frankly, maybe that’s why I still haven’t done anything to make it feel like home. I just got rid of the creepy stuff when the old elf died.”
The piece of paper glowed in Harry’s hands. He hadn’t heard of the bands listed on it. It seemed like music has took several steps forward since Harry had last listened to the radio at the Burrow.
“We didn’t know each other back then, we actually met here,” Annalise added and squeezed Finn in a brief hug.
The day went by calmly. Harper continued periodically sending me weird looks – I still couldn’t understand why. At six o’clock I finished work, went out of the Ministry and headed towards Eaton Mews. I didn’t want to call it home, but it was surely more cosy than the house on Grimmauld place. Just the sight of Malfoy in his stretched out pants this morning was worth it – I chuckled at the memory. I couldn’t have imagined that the usually neat Malfoy actually owned such clothes.
I left the lady to Harper and strode away through the crowd, and as luck would have it, barely three streets away from Fortescue’s café, I spotted him: a clumsy-looking, skinny guy was trying to find something in a trembling bag. I approached, clutching my wand in the pocket of my robes.
Finn grinned and was about to start speaking, when the flames in the fireplace cracked and went green. Before Harry had the time to react, Ron and Hermione stepped out of the fireplace.
“My parents chose home schooling,” she answered simply. “Can’t say I was upset to miss that authoritarian school of yours.”
The flames flickered and showed Mum’s tired face. Merlin, I still cannot help but feel guilty each time I see her, although she wasn’t mad at me in the first place.
“And I am sure, it is awful.” He smiled and leaned back on his chair, looking at me with interest. “He isn’t a robber, if you ask me – if you know what I mean.”
The memory of the month when father returned after two years of Azkaban filled me with horror. I used to think that aunt Bella had always been crazy, but after observing Lucius I’m not so sure any more.
“No, I’m covering up from the sun,” he replied sarcastically. “Merlin, Potter! I’m a public defender, remember? I have to go through the basics from time to time.”
Inside, it was quite crowded; Harry made his way to the bar and looked at the menu. It said as follows:
“No,” he answered simply. It was the first time in several years that he allowed himself to be honest about this.
“I guess I’ve heard more Muggle music in ten days then in the ten previous years,” Harry said and took a sip from his glass.
This was quite stressful, but Harry was kind of proud that he was able to stand up for himself. So when two days later he found out that Ron was convinced Harry was going to come back after a good rest, because, obviously, that’s what Bennet had told the staff, Harry was furious. Besides, he still hadn’t figured out how to drop out of the Ministry events without being too rude, which made him feel childish and weak. By Saturday he got tired of being stuck and scribbled a quick letter to Malfoy, hoping that he would help.
Potter ran up the stairs and pushed the door. I, however, started to doubt the sanity of the idea. Why the hell do I need Potter here? I’d better invite Theo or Greg. They would agree to keep me company for some time. Nothing exotic like Potter who can be unpredictable.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked as Annalise grabbed her purse. Another bang followed. The music stopped, and Harry noticed that people started to move towards the back of the garage.
Harry looked at the wallpaper: some corners started to stick out, and a thick layer of dust seemed to have become part of the once greenish pattern.
I came back home, opened to heavy door with my key and went into the living room. Malfoy was already there, lying on the sofa, reading something.
Annalise was thrilled, but Harry barely noticed it, because Draco’s hand was stroking his knee under the table. A faint memory of a Ministry dinner he was supposed to attend tonight crossed Harry’s mind, only to leave him truly satisfied with the fact that he missed it. He was far more comfortable here, sitting on the floor, talking of things he barely heard of before, feeling the tips of Malfoy’s fingers on his knee. It all felt right.
“Well, you could try and kick me out,” I interjected, diving under Malfoy’s arm as he tried to block the way, and managed to get inside. The bathroom was nice: a new shiny sink, yellow tile. It would have been perfect to have two, though. Meanwhile, Malfoy entered the bathroom as well – I could tell he was dissatisfied and perplexed at the same time.
“Or with a public defender. I’ll get your ass in court in one minute for violence,” I responded. There’s no way I’ll let him threaten me.
We went upstairs to change. I hesitated for a second before asking, “Are you walking to the Ministry?”
“I did. We yelled at each other in front of the whole damn department. I guess he’s just hoping I’ll cave in.”
“I have to get all the proper Muggle papers,” she answered. “Draco, do you have a beer or something? I am about to lose my mind, and I’m not doing it sober.”
“I haven’t used a computer since I was fourteen, I guess,” Harry said. “Well, then I’ll search for the non-binary thing. Unless you want to explain that as well.”
Harry looked at the board, unable to understand how she could have won again. When Harry had Apparated them straight to the living room of the house on Grimmauld place – in order to avoid an awkward encounter with Mrs. Black’s portrait – Finn sat down on the couch and announced that for the sake of their relationship he never played chess with Annalise, and now Harry understood why. Nobody likes losing all the time.
“Fine,” he shrugged indifferently and pulled out his wallet. He counted out thirty golden coins and piled them up on the decorative table in the hallway. “I’ll move in in an hour.”
Had I had more time, I would have looked for another place, but I didn’t seem to have a choice. So I agreed to all the stupid conditions that obviously satisfied Malfoy’s ego, and then went to Grimmauld place real quick to give Kreacher the necessary orders and pack some clothes. Obviously, I wouldn’t be staying at Malfoy’s very long, so I only grabbed a few sets of clothes and hygiene items. I could always pass by the Black’s house if I needed more.
“I should have asked for forty galleons. It feels like I rented out the whole place,” Malfoy muttered.
Harry heard someone approach from behind; he was getting ready to cast a spell, but this was just the barmaid.
Harry chuckled at the lyrics and caught himself thinking that despite the suspicious attitude of the barmaid he liked this place. The people around looked chill and happy, the beer was good, the guy on stage was dancing his ass off – Harry made a mental note to add another sickle to the “artist fund” or whatever it was called.
Mum smiled funnily. I wonder: how does she find this will power in herself? That’s father she is talking of. “We”. As though he was a child, unable to control himself. But kids are never this combative…
“Really? This is wonderful!” Narcissa seemed genuinely happy and her contagious smile caused me to grin in reply. “Everything’s calm over here. It’s been a week since we had a rough night.”
Malfoy had dropped the snobby attitude that used to piss me off so much. I came to the conclusion that he didn’t hate me anymore either, and the bickering was more of a habit than the reflection of what he really thought. Well, and I didn’t mind the bickering – it was fun, if you ask me.
I have already cursed myself multiple times for placing the ad. Got fed up with solitude, huh! Now I’ll have to tolerate Potter whom for some reason I still haven’t kicked out… Well, I did know the reason, but now the whole thing seemed foolish: his presence offered almost no advantages but will get on my nerves. However, Potter wasn’t about to leave. Does he really have no place to live? Anyway, that’s none of my business.
“Give him a chance, I’m sure he’ll…” Malfoy retorted in a low voice. The person he was speaking to didn’t sound convinced.
Harry laughed and kissed him again. He had never seen Malfoy so close and was surprised to find out that he had freckles. It was nice and a little strange at the same time to note a detail like this.
I came back to Eaton Mews and regretted my compliancy almost at once. Turns out, Malfoy hadn’t grown up a bit: he kept saying nonsense and tried to piss me off, as if we were still at school. Fortunately, three years in the Auror office had toughened me up, and pissing me off wasn’t as easy as it used to be.
And even if Harry was determined to start a new life, he was in no way ready to disappoint people, so he rushed to start the conversation whenever he felt confident enough. Bennet, the Head Auror, was so surprised that he forgot the golden rule he used in all unclear situations – scare the shit out of your employees until they agree with you – and instead tried to convince Harry to take a week off before quitting the job altogether. This might have worked a week before, but Harry had reached the point where even a faint possibility of returning to the Auror office sounded like a nightmare. Harry and Bennet’s heated argument still resonated in Harry’s head when he got back home.
“It’s my pack, I’ll throw it around if I want to,” suggested Potter, casually swaying it in my direction. Okay, I figure I pissed him off. I’d tell him to leave, but he’d already payed for the first month, and I would look stupid giving him the money back. So I just stood up, snorted dismissively, and headed to the kitchen to make some more coffee.
I sighed and went back to the living room, where I saw Potter running around in ironed pants (he knows how to iron?) and an unbuttoned shirt.
As he spoke, Draco put on a black t-shirt and a pair of jeans, grabbed the birth certificate from the desk and handed it to Harry.
She smiled and put her hand in Ron’s. I went back to the table with the drinks and ran into Seamus, who’d studied in the Auror Office with us.
Harry was pretty impressed by the clarity of the answer; he wouldn’t have ever thought that Malfoy would end up explaining Muggle stuff to him. It was a curious feeling: thinking you know someone so well, and yet not knowing them at all.
“I still don’t get it,” Ron admitted. “I mean they are nice and all, but why exactly are you hanging out with Malfoy and his friends?”
“It’s funny how some people are pushed into marriage, while others can’t marry even if they want to,” Draco said bitterly, rolling a flat pebble in his hand.
“I am saying,” Malfoy explained, “that if you don’t lie, you must have told them by now where you’re staying. And not mentioning me in the story would be… well, maybe not an outright lie, but not the truth either.”
A week was enough to realise all the stupidity of the idea. I could have given the ad one more week, but I decided to cut the crap and ask an old friend to live here, hoping that someone would be wanting to deal with me.
“I swear, wine glasses will be your Christmas present this year, Harry,” she said. “Transfigured beer bottles are just gross.”
His eyes met Harry’s and he stopped talking in surprise. Finally, he tossed his purple hair off his forehead.
“The one Annalise mentioned yesterday,” Harry said. “He could convince the Wizengamot to hear the trans committee out.”
“Potter, your key,” Malfoy pointed at the small round table just inside the apartment’s open door. I looked around and grabbed the key I had almost forgotten.
“You know better,” he glanced at me suspiciously. He probably got it, but, thankfully, said nothing, because otherwise Hermione would have bombarded me with psychological advice for hours. I do love Hermione, but sometimes she’s too helpful.
“It’s the last one for strangers,” Malfoy replied and took two cigarettes out of his pocket. “Here.”
Harry looked around. The music was playing again, but the atmosphere wasn’t the same anymore: nobody seemed to want to dance; instead, people were standing here and there in small groups, speaking in a low voice. Harry caught himself thinking that he too would rather leave.
Finn chuckled. Hermione looked intrigued. Ron took the chess box from the floor and put it on the table.
“Auror Potter. Could you please introduce yourself, mister…?” I demanded in an official tone. The young man flinched and tried to run away, but he didn’t go far – I was prepared for this and shot him with Incarcerous. Ropes swung out of my wand and tied the guy’s hands and feet together. He stumbled and fell face forward – I barely had the time to do a cushioning charm so that his nose could remain intact.
I rolled my eyes and leaned on the opposite wall, waiting for the possibility to wash up. About five minutes later the door opened, and Malfoy came out of the bathroom, looking a bit too chipper.
I finally got up from the rug in front of the fireplace and headed to the kitchen in order to make some coffee - the one remaining joy in my life.
“It’s not what I thought it was,” Harry answered. “It’s all about being rough and following orders. I’m not good at following orders.”
“What about Alan Mann?” I changed the subject. “You said the other day that he was having a difficult time, but how do you know that, since you haven’t seen him yet?”
“All right. See you around,” she seemed to have calmed down a little and went back to slicing the cheese.
“I don’t think so. Anyway, is it really necessary to close the door?” I didn’t understand what on earth could happen to me if I saw Malfoy brushing his teeth.
“Um,” I drawled, trying to figure out a way to prove him wrong, “They know I’ve rented a place in Muggle London.”
Malfoy headed to the living room, yelled, “TONY, THEY’RE HERE!” and gave a hug to each of the guests. Harry nodded awkwardly, clutching his beer, trying not to stare too much as Malfoy introduced him to the others.
“First: don’t leave your stuff all over the place,” I eyed the pack of the floor, “second: mind your own business.”
“No problem,” I replied. Harper gave me a weird look and was off before I had the time to figure out what it meant. I frowned, but decided not to give it too much thought: I had to write a detailed report on the case of Alan Mann, our freshly arrested thief.
“You did break up with Weasley, though.” Malfoy said as he got up, took the pans off the fire and cleaned the stove with a spell. He didn’t ask anything, but Harry could tell he was curious.
“It’s not!” Draco pressed his hands to his eyes and rubbed them really hard. “I have to find out, I have to…”
I watched him leave, thinking that Potter seemed far too calm. He didn’t actually enjoy my presence, did he?
Draco was as real as he could be, this time wearing a washed-out t-shirt tucked in his cropped blue jeans.
“So I assume what is happening here is abuse of authority,” Harry crossed his arms just like Emmet did. “Get out, all of you.”
“Nope,” Malfoy chuckled. “Even I don’t kiss people just to piss my father off. It’s more of a pleasant side-effect.”
“I bet. Well, in this case I’ll go to my room. I’ll have all day tomorrow to contemplate your face.”
“It doesn’t have to be all day,” Potter replied, buttoning his shirt. “We can agree on a strategy for Mann’s hearing much faster than that.”
“Of course.” Draco looked up at Harry and smiled slightly. Harry noted to himself that he never smiled that often during their years at Hogwarts.
“Oh no, I’m no Google,” he smiled back and sat at the kitchen table next to Harry. “I’d rather you told me how come you couldn’t resign.”
“A layer cake,” Tony answered, opening the oven and poking the contents of a baking circle with a long match.
“Oh,” she calmed down, nodded understandingly and settled down on the couch. “All right then. I’m Iris.”
“Yes, since last year. In the border control department,” she obviously didn’t know what else to say. I get it; we haven’t been in contact since school, so we didn’t really have a lot to say to each other.
“Harry, are you going to run off your own graduation party? I don’t think so,” Ron shook his head sceptically. “Besides, I have nothing to say against a bender.”
Harry heard muffled swearing followed by a crack of Disapparition and hurried into the living room. Draco was panting and clutching his head between his hands; Iris got up from the couch and tried to touch Draco’s shoulder, but he leapt away from her.
“They’ve been together for four years, and I know they’d love to get married, but they can’t, because of Annalise’s papers.”
“I really don’t want to talk about my father,” Draco leaned back on his arms. “So, what are you going to do about Bennet?”
Hermione blinked. Ron burst into laughter, and Hermione gave him an irritated nudge. Ron managed to calm down a bit.
We glared at each other for several seconds. Then Potter checked the plate above the door and asked:
At eight o’clock Harry stepped out of the fireplace and found himself in what looked like a living room of a regular, not too tidy flat. Clothes and books were lying all around the place: on the big shabby sofa, piled up on the rectangular coffee table next to a glass half-full of ashes and cigarette buds. A colourful tapestry was nailed to the wall above the sofa, and next to the window there were several goblet shaped drums with potted plants on top of them.
“Ron!” Hermione exclaimed, but gave up almost instantly. She of all people knew that it was useless to argue with Ron on this one.
Hermione gave Harry a quick hug, and they Disapparated. Harry went upstairs to the bedroom and found an owl waiting for the window to be opened. He let the bird in, it dropped a note, made an angry noise and flew away. Harry recognized Draco’s handwriting.
I shook my head. There’s no reason to lie to myself: my school friends were part of my past, as well as the careless years when my main preoccupation was the fact that Potter had a better broom and that Granger’s grades were higher.
Confused, I tugged on the handle of the closed door. Locked? Why? I must admit, I was truly surprised to hear Malfoy’s voice from the other side:
For the first time in the evening, Harry was glad to know what they were talking about, so he tried to answer Annalise’s question. Tony, as a Muggle-born, also had a couple of things to say, and Harry was pleased to see that they were getting along pretty well. Draco sipped his beer and smiled with the corner of his lips while he listened, and this discreet attention finally made Harry feel like he was welcome here.
“Besides, you haven’t been five minutes here and already managed to break two rules,” I decided to change the subject. Potter stared at me, confused.
“Who’s the singer?” Harry asked the guy behind the bar, whose short hair and athletic body for some reason contrasted with the low cut t-shirt, tucked in his skinny jeans. The guy turned around, and Harry blinked as he noticed eyeliner on his eyes.
Harry took a deep breath and told them everything: about the music, the casual and strange encounter with Draco; he also told them about the party at the flat, the Barrel and the Auror raid.
I had to admit that Potter had a point. But, personally speaking, I had no urge whatsoever to spend my energy on getting along with him.
“Why would you invite the goddamn saviour, Draco?” Harry heard an irritated voice say. “He won’t understand…”
My thoughts wandered as I continued walking. I think one way or another I always imagined myself working in the Ministry, though maybe in a higher position. As father used to say: this is just a matter of time.
I stuck my head in a Muggle newspaper that I picked up in order to find a flat to rent, while Ron and Hermione went on discussing Ron’s future job. What do we have here… A house in the suburbs – no, that’s not what I want… A three bedroom – that’s too much… There. The ad that captured my attention was for an available room in a flat in the centre of London. Maybe a room wasn’t enough - but the flat was just a few miles away from the café, and I needed a place to stay as soon as possible. I decided I could always find something else later, but for now, a room would be fine. I said my goodbyes hastily, folded the paper and was on my way.
“I hope you remember about your shift,” Harry recognized Iris’s voice. “I’m not paying your part of the rent if you get fired again.”
“Why should I?” Malfoy lifted and eyebrow and gave me a highly ironic look, which made me feel stupid.
Harry felt relieved and at the same time confused about what was going on between them. There definitely was a thing, but it was too soon to know what exactly. So when the fireplace cracked several times, announcing the arrival of the others, Harry was more than happy to change the subject.
“Not that it’s any of my business,” he started carefully, handing Draco one of the bottles and sitting on the bed next to him, “but there’s a Howler on your desk.”
After the formalities had been honoured, the lady left with her retrieved purse. I almost felt sorry for the unskilled thief: he was definitely not used to stealing things. But I still wasn’t going to let him go: the lack of experience was no excuse.
I couldn’t help laughing. The outlook was brilliant: we will have to work together, as if living under one roof wasn’t enough of a challenge! Harper did always have a sense of humour.
“This bar is perfectly legal,” she said. “I have told you this at least four times this year. Stop terrorizing my clients, or I will file another complaint.”
I was on the “enemy territory” – at least, that’s how Mr. Green jokingly called the investigation department. The office was small, with only two desks and a great amount of stuff lying around: books, parchments, two maps of London - a Muggle one and one of the wizarding city. Mr. Green and I came here this morning, so that Potter and I could discuss the strategy for the hearing. Potter’s desk was as much of a mess as the rest of the place, which made me uncomfortable. Mr. Green, however, didn’t seem surprised or bothered: he sat down in front of Potter’s boss, with whom he had some other business to sort out.
He let the cat go; it jumped on the desk and rolled in the bits of parchment, threatening to push the bottles off. Harry reacted quickly enough: he grabbed the beer and stroked the cat again, but it was already too busy tearing up a red envelope. Harry frowned: the envelope was clearly a Howler.
Potter seemed determined. He didn’t even enter the room: only glanced at it, standing in the doorway.
“By the way,” Draco added, “You might want to give your birth certificate directly to Annalise. I’m not sure if I’ll see her until next Saturday.”
Draco let go of his face and nodded. Harry took his hand and Apparated to the first place he could think of – the edge of the lake they had ended in with Ron and Hermione after escaping Gringotts on a dragon.
I headed to the kitchen, ignoring Potter’s protest. There was simply no other place his goddamn watch could be. And I was right: there it was, waiting for him on top of the flat’s small, 4 foot fridge.
The next day I let Ron talk me into going to the mall with him and Hermione, because “she wanted to buy some stuff”. I tried replying that if Hermione wanted to buy stuff, it was probably for their future flat, but Ron insisted:
“I guess you’ll have to share.” I took out a bottle of milk and was about to take a sip when Malfoy – without even looking at me! – said:
The high-pitched noise of the alarm clock forced me out of my sleep, and I found myself in a completely unfamiliar place. A double bed, a bedside table with a lamp on it, grey curtains… My sleepy brain tried to remember how I had ended up here. I reached out for my glasses and sat up. Shit… Malfoy.
I decided to test him and deliberately gave a price higher than the real one, but Potter nodded. I wanted to make sure he won’t forget who’s the boss here. I didn’t care if he’s a national hero – if he’s going to live here, he’ll just be a tenant.
The only disadvantage of the situation was that I felt lonely. After Hogwarts, I had parted ways with my old friends, and hadn’t yet made any new ones. About a month ago I began thinking of renting a part of the flat, but no wizard would accept living in a Muggle place. So I decided a Muggle flatmate would do fine. I’ve been enough around Muggles these few months and was no longer scared of them, and I was pretty sure all the magic could be hidden quite easily. Okay, maybe I will have to be a bit more careful.
“I hope you’re right,” Tony mumbled, mixing the batter. “Now leave me alone, please, I need this cake to be perfect.”
I tucked my shirt in my pants, put my watch on, tried to comb my hair and went downstairs. Malfoy arrived in a minute or so.
Harry felt even more helpless. He could tell that the conversation was pissing Tony off, but he had no clue of what was going on.
Yes! It happened! I finally got a public defender’s licence and, starting Monday, I work in the Ministry of magic. I wasn’t sure this was what I dreamt of as a kid, but I was overall happy with how things were going.
“Okay, Malfoy, can we please decide something,” Potter jumped on the opportunity to drop formalities. “You can practise your phrase-mongering in court.”
Harry forced himself to smile and tried to ignore the sinking feeling that Bennet was going to be pissed as hell, which meant that this was just the beginning of their problems.
? A Malfoy?” he snapped, and Harry nodded. “If only you knew how tired I was of being a Malfoy! I’m not playing by anyone’s rules anymore. At least, now I’m free.”
“Oh, fuck off!” I snapped, but ended up letting out a laugh. The bastard did understand me a little too well.
As soon as I left the Ministry, I took off my robe and put it in my briefcase. I only put it on to give myself a more formal look – normally Ministry employees leave their robes in their office. That’s what I’m going to from Monday on.
Melissa lit up, twittered something about being happy to help if necessary and disappeared behind the door. It hasn’t escaped my notice that Potter’s eyes casually slipped down her figure.
“We’ll be back in a bit – we have to go through an old case in the archive,” Mr. Green explained, and they left.
“Ron, Harry, I’m so happy for you!” Hermione finally made it through the crowd of our drunken classmates and hugged us, just like when we were eleven.
“Tell me honestly, Hermione, are you upset because you put so much effort in that house, and I still don’t live there?” I asked, deciding to call the big guns. Ron chuckled and glanced at Hermione: she backed down immediately.
“I didn’t say he was having a difficult time,” Malfoy said cautiously. “I said he had his reasons to steal.”
We talked for a bit longer. I told her that I’d run into Pansy, and then Mum went back to her errands. That’s how she calls Dad now – he can’t be left on his own.
From where I was sitting I could hear some bits of Mr. Green’s conversation with Mr. Harper. These middle-aged arses were betting. And on what, one might wonder?! On me and Potter! Who will give in first! Wow, when I was passing the job interview, I would have never thought that Mr. Green is capable of such a thing. This must be the influence of chatting with an Auror on a regular basis. I was pretty sure that Potter’s boss had graduated from Gryffindor – otherwise, why on earth would a grown man find this amusing?
“Malfoy, here’s the deal: I comply to all your idiotic rules, and you don’t insult my friends. It’s not that difficult. Don’t act childish, will you?”
“It’s just that I don’t get it. You were always… You’re…” Harry stumbled on his words. He didn’t know how to phrase the feeling.
“Hi,” Hermione said without looking up – she was searching for something in her bottomless purse. She finally gave up with an exasperated sigh and added, “Harry, we brought you some souvenirs, but I honestly can’t handle looking for them right now. You mind?”
We sat down and started eating, and I couldn’t help but think that living with Malfoy wasn’t too bad after all.
Harry followed Draco through the dark corridor. The room turned out to be small, with only a bed, a desk and a closet. Malfoy put the bottles on the desk, stepped on the bed to get to the window and opened it; the smell of rain filled the room, and a fluffy but a little damp cat leapt on the windowsill from the outside.
“I don’t care if it’s a dress for her or shower curtains for our flat, Harry. I’m not doing this alone.”
I nodded, and she left me sitting on my bed, trying to wrap my brain around what had just happened. Things I’ve always considered inviolable shattered to pieces because of my father’s insanity. The same evening, Narcissa took me to Eaton Mews South. I took almost nothing with me – I guess I was hoping I’d come back soon. However, after two weeks of independent life I was not that eager to return to the manor. And now, six months later, there was no way I’d accept to live in the manor again.
“I’d have to hire a professional to do so. I work at a bar, you know. None of us have this kind of money.”
Mum asked to let her know if the job interview went well. I could have “forgotten” it, but I knew she would never disturb me herself. I sighed again as I realised that talking to her is my duty. Especially considering what’s been going on in the manor lately.
A few hours later Harry stepped out of the fireplace of Draco’s flat and instantly tripped over a pile of books.
Harry ignored the guess, even though it hit close to home. The weirdness of the situation was bothering him more and more. Who was this Malfoy, sitting next to him? Why were they having a calm conversation? What’s with the ring in his nose, goddamn it?!
We were approaching the Ministry stairs when Malfoy noticed Parkinson down the street. She was reading the morning
“We’ve got a case, Harry. Let’s go,” Mr. Harper, my boss, said as he got up and put his ministry robes on.
“C’mon, you didn’t even believe we could do it,” Ron teased her – he had endured a whole month of Hermione’s lectures on how he was lazy and disorganised. Obviously, it wasn’t true; it’s just that he and I were both so ready for the finals and could’ve not even opened our textbooks, but who on earth was able to explain such a thing to Hermione?
“I know what I said. I mean, you agree with me that he doesn’t have it in him to be a thief, don’t you?”
I chuckled as I watched the door close. There was one thing that hasn’t changed about Malfoy: he didn’t let anybody know what he really thought. I could plainly see that he liked my company. It was quite obvious, actually: to start with, he rented me a room instead of brushing me off, and yesterday he spent almost two hours talking to me, and I could swear that he’d enjoyed our semi-official altercations as much as I had.
Ron was right: the party was a success. Even I – the guy who usually stays on the sidelines – had a lot of fun. We drank a lot, danced a lot and laughed a lot. However, in the morning my head felt like it was going to explode, and I had a hard time finding the hangover potion, but I couldn’t deny that it was a great graduation party. Despite my concerns, yesterday’s blondie didn’t ask for a way to contact me again. I felt incredibly lucky: usually girls tend to get their hopes high, and the fact that I’m a national hero doesn’t really help. But again, yesterday, everything was perfect: the music, the drinks, the cute girl by my side…
In about ten minutes we were already standing near one of the cafés in Diagon Alley, listening to the lady who had reported the theft. She was confused and a little scared; I understood from her fragmentary story that someone had stolen her bag while she was drinking her tea at Fortescue’s.
Harry tried hard not to laugh. Fortunately for him, somebody knocked on the door. Draco immediately pulled a sheet on the two of them.
“I have never seen you here before. Besides, you are wearing your uniform,” Malfoy eyed his Auror pants and boots. “Therefore I conclude that you didn’t plan on coming here.”
“Yeah, thanks. It feels good to be outside.” Draco opened his eyes and looked around. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Mr. Malfoy,” he countered with an ironic smile, “you are asking for too much. Do not forget that your client was caught in the act.”
“HEY!” Harry yelled at the Auror in charge, stepping out of the garage and feeling his wand under his sleeve. “Emmet, what’s going on here?!”
“I was, but that was a long time ago,” Harry said, as Malfoy covered his face with his hands and let out a muffled laugh.
I've been having a hard time lately, so I've decided I have to finish this fic before posting it online. So the next time you see an update it's going to be the whole fic :) thanks for reading and see you in a bit!
We washed up in silence, glancing at each other from time to time. Yesterday I understood several things. Firstly, I was surprised to discover that there was nothing left of the school hatred I used to have for Malfoy. One fight was more than enough to blow off the steam and stop the useless picking on each other. Secondly, Malfoy has changed a lot in the three years that we spent apart, and it wasn’t just about the looks. The important thing was that he seemed to have grown up: the impeccably respectful, even though a bit ironic tone at work was a perfect illustration of it. The fact that he was good at his job was another thing I was surprised to discover.
“Hello, buddy,” Draco took the cat in his arms and scratched it behind the ears. “Got caught in the rain, huh?”
My first day at work went well. Before noon I was doing Mr. Green’s paperwork – an integral part of the court. At about 3 pm, an Auror came by and left us a new case – a theft. Generally speaking, the thief was screwed: the Aurors caught him red-handed. But it was my job as a public defender to see if I could find any mitigating circumstances, so I spent to rest of the day working on Alan Mann’s case.
“Illegal lucrative activity is under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, not the Auror office,” he stated.
Embarrassed, I smiled and squinted as the fireworks exploded above my head. I’ve never been a fan of attention, even though today I’m not the only one celebrating. The party was organized by some of Ron’s friends to mark the end of our studies. Yes, that’s right – from now on we are officially Aurors! The dream has come true, I guess.
Harry spotted Annalise standing next to Finn on the other side of the dance floor and made his way through the crowd towards them, as the guy on stage started singing a new song:
Harry nodded, trying his best to look relaxed. The ironic look Draco gave him hinted to the fact that he didn’t really succeed.
“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY!” the visitor bellowed, and Harry recognized the voice at once. It was Lucius Malfoy.
“Sorry mate, didn’t know you had company,” Ron shrugged apologetically. “We arrived early and thought we’d stop by.”
We continued walking in silence for some time. I spent several minutes thinking about why Malfoy had chosen to become a public defender. Law was never one of his concerns, as far as I knew; maybe he thought that he could use these skills one day to defend himself? I glanced at him – he was walking by my side, hands in his pockets, and looked calm and satisfied. It didn’t seem like he had to defend himself. Nah, I must be missing something.
“How did he find me?! Fuck, fuck!” Draco sat down on the edge of the couch, but couldn’t stay calm and stood up again, clutched his shoulders and started pacing. “I have to find out how…”
“Ugh,” Annalise sighed and sat on the couch. “It’s more difficult than I expected. Turns out the Confundus…”
Malfoy’s hand was still on Harry’s forearm, and Harry knew exactly what was it that he wanted to do in this precise moment. He hesitated for a bit, then covered Malfoy’s cold fingers with his hand; Malfoy didn’t move away. Harry leaned over and kissed him a little too abruptly, and when Malfoy kissed back, running his fingers through Harry’s hair and breathing heavily, Harry felt completely sure that he was doing the right thing.
“I’ve been offered a job at the law enforcement department and at the underage magic control department. I haven’t decided yet,” Hermione told us. “Harry, when do you start?”
As I was pouring the hot drink in a cup, someone knocked loudly on the door. I jumped in surprise, spilling some on the table. I tried to reach for a rag, but the coffee pot slipped out of my hand and burnt my finger. I swore loudly, dropped everything, and went to open the door. If that’s that neighbour again, I decided I would say that I have no more salt: I’m on a new Japanese diet. And I will definitely not explain the details.
Harry hesitated for a second, then took the hand rolled cigarette and sat down on a concrete block nearby. Malfoy joined him, settling down cross-legged.
Several minutes later I had already brushed my teeth and come downstairs, hoping to find something to eat. Quite predictably, Malfoy was already in the kitchen making coffee. I made my way past him to the fridge and opened it.
Harry couldn’t take this anymore. Draco was breathing heavily and seemed to not be able to control himself; Harry knew what this felt like. He stepped close to Draco, stopping the pacing around.
Malfoy threw his head back and exhaled slowly, letting the smoke out of his mouth. The tattoo on his neck – a wonderfully drawn sea landscape – moved with a gust of wind, and Harry was so impressed he almost stopped breathing. Malfoy noticed this and smiled.
“I do,” Draco tossed his hair off his forehead and sat up straight. “But the price of being part of it is too high.”
“I heard what you said!” Draco yelled – for the first time since the beginning of the conversation. “I have told you a hundred times, I’ve got a life! I am
And if he didn’t grasp it at once, I did: both of us were working in the Ministry, so we would end up walking to work the same way. Of course, he would eventually find out that walking is easier than looking for a place to Apparate in the middle of London, but I had no intention of making his thought process faster – I’ve had enough of him at home. And why in the world did he come into the kitchen and eat breakfast with me? Is he trying to cozy up and be friendly or something?
Now that the pressing issues, such as getting along with my new flatmate, were gone, for the first time since I settled down here I asked myself what I was going to tell Ron and Hermione. I was surely not going to tell them I was living with Malfoy – this would require a lot of explanations which would all end up sounding fake. Ron and I usually had a beer every weekend; I guess I could simply tell him that I rented a place in Muggle London, without going into the details. I doubted I would stay here for another month, so I wouldn’t need to stick to this half-truth for too long.
Draco let out a muffled laugh and looked at Harry in a way he never did before. It wasn’t curiosity, it wasn’t lust; it was… affection. It felt weird and comforting at the same time.
“Well, then,” she hesitated for a second before continuing, “I was saying: Confundus doesn’t work, because apparently different doctors look at your file when you’re not there, so obviously they can see it’s fake. I can’t follow them around for a week just to hex them when the time comes.”
We were standing in front of the bathroom, arguing about who should go first. And even though I was there a step before Malfoy, he wasn’t ready to back off.
Anyhow, trying to figure out Potter’s motives was a thankless task. Besides, as long as he complies to my rules, I won’t be complaining.
“I’m not really tired, the finals were easy,” I said. In reality, I had no idea what to do during the so-called “break”.
“This is a standard operation, Mr. Potter,” Emmet responded as he made a gesture to the other Aurors to back off. “These people are troublemakers…”
I ignored the sarcastic tone and ran up the stairs. It looked like tomorrow wouldn't just be a boring day of paperwork after all.
“Not every opinion is a riot, Potter. But I suppose you can't explain this to my father,” Malfoy calmed down a bit and took another smoke. “What about you? Are you happy with your life?”
“Um, what if I brought you mine?” Harry asked, realising that his explanation was vague at best. “I’m sure I still have it. It’s a bit old, but we are about the same age anyway, right? We could make a copy and then just alter it a bit.”
“I should ask you the same question!” Mr. Malfoy hissed. “What are you doing in this gutter? This is not a suitable place for you. I have told you multiple times that you should come back to the Manor!”
“Ah, isn’t it Henry’s birthday?” Draco asked as he opened the fridge to get the beer. “Is he coming over?”
“Go ahead, Mr. Potter. This case is perfect for beginners,” Mr. Harper patted me on the shoulder with a fatherly look.
I laughed out loud. Too proud to ask directly, huh? Malfoy added some water in the coffee pot, trying to ignore the fact that I was openly making fun of him, but failed – I could perfectly see that the skin on the back of his neck turned pink.
Harry snorted. With his love of electronic music, Malfoy had really nothing in common with the pop-rock Weird Sisters.
Walking back to the office, I wondered if it was weird to be so surprised by the fact that Malfoy turned out to be a decent public defender. I suppose I was used to him being an arse to everyone who was weaker than himself, and seeing him from a different perspective wasn’t something I was prepared for.
“Merlin, look at these famous guests, this flat has just gained in price,” Finn said to Draco. At this point, Tony entered the living room, and the edgy girl Draco called Annalise rushed to hug him.
Harry’s week was full of hasty decisions and unpleasant conversations. In any circumstances would it have been joyful to break up with Ginny, knowing her explosive character, but this was the one thing that actually went well. Ginny was upset, but not surprised, as if she had seen it coming, which led Harry to believe that she understood him remarkably well.
“Close the door,” my new flatmate added as he ran down the stairs and strode away without even checking if I would actually lock up. I was already running late, so I swore to myself as the key refused to turn in the lock. I finally succeeded, dropped the key in my pocket and went to search for a place where I could Apparate unnoticed.
Harry caught the bottles that flew into the living room from the kitchen and handed one to Annalise.
Ron sat down on the couch next to Finn, while Harry took some of the empty beer bottles and put them in front of Hermione.
“Ask your friends in the Ministry why they won’t approve the potion. The research has been done years ago, but these bastards won’t allow it on the market,” Annalise said grumpily. “The wizarding trans committee writes letters every year, but the Wizengamot won’t even hear us out.”
Thinking of responsibilities felt almost physically suffocating. Harry only managed to cope with the pace of Auror duties because Ron was there to cheer him up, plus, Dennis’ stupid ideas kept him from feeling trapped in the routine. On top of the difficult job, Kingsley somehow talked Harry into attending one official event after another, where he was forced to smile, keep a straight face and politely answer tactless questions. By the way, wasn’t there another dinner planned this weekend?..
If someone had asked me several years ago how to find a stolen purse, I would have suggested buying a new one, but now I knew that the chances of catching the thief weren’t completely inexistent. I questioned the lady about the contents of her bag. She mentioned a couple of galleons, lipstick, tissues and other stuff people usually have in their bag, and – fortunately for me – a Sneakoscope. Any Sneakoscope would vibrate and glow if the bag it was in was getting stolen, reacting to the presence of the thief. But a decently manufactured one would continue to glow and vibrate even when the owner wasn’t near anymore, if the person had had it long enough. According to the lady, it’s been several years since she first put the device in her purse and she never took it out.
I shrugged and stepped back, letting Potter enter the flat. He hesitated for a brief moment, but gathered himself almost instantly and asked:
then, would it?” Malfoy answered. Harry was still puzzled, so Draco rolled his eyes and added, “I’m not dating anyone, gosh.”
“Can I have a beer, please?” he asked the barmaid, who was busy cutting cheese for the sandwiches. She was about forty years old, as far as Harry could tell, tall and plump.
No, this time Harry had to admit that he got here due to his own choices. First, while heading home from the Auror office, Harry thought that it would be nice to have a pint or two. But it was Monday, and his favourite pub was closed, so Harry decided that any place was good enough to have a beer. Even this bar with a neon sign and several tattooed girls smoking outside. Of course, he stood out in the crowd because of his Auror uniform, but who cares, right? Besides, he did get himself a beer, and the light electropop music was surprisingly soothing.
“I agree. You always were a bad loser,” Hermione noted, getting up as well. “I am not passing all my free time playing chess with you just so you could win the next time.”
Hermione shrugged. “It’s easier to buy everything at once. I don’t want to come back here twice a week.”
And then it struck me: I wanted a flatmate, didn’t I? Potter could be a decent choice. First of all, he’s a wizard, so I wouldn’t have to hide a simple Lumos, and I could continue using the Floo network as usual. Secondly, after our time at school, I knew him as the back of my hand. The prospect of making fun of him as in the good old days was honestly pretty tempting. The hatred was long gone, and now I only felt a bit annoyed when I looked at Potter. But the most important thing was that I doubted I could find another wizard willing to live here. So I decided to seize the opportunity.
“Sure,” she put down her knife, wiped her hands on her trousers and started pouring the beer when she saw the sickle on the counter. “Oh, I’m sorry, do you have any knuts? I’m almost out of change.”
It was important to me to stay formal with Potter, at least when Mr. Green was around, so as soon as we entered the office, I greeted him with a “Good morning, Mr. Potter”. I could see his lip curl in amusement, but he accepted the rules. It has been some time now since we started the discussion.
“That’s what I’ve been telling you for over an hour and a half,” I would have been annoyed, if I wasn’t so tired of the bickering.
“Ugh, portraits. You can threaten to put her of fire, it tends to shut them up for a while,” Annalise suggested and smiled in the most innocent way possible before taking a sip from her bottle.
“Draco, dear, I hope you don’t think that I’m evicting you,” Mum spoke in such a tender tone that disagreeing with her felt almost like being rude. “But you have seen yourself what Azkaban has done to Lucius. He will never let you be.”
I finished cooking, and we started eating. Malfoy was sitting in front of me, sipping coffee from his cup, and I once again noticed the Dark Mark on his left forearm. I have seen it multiple times in the past few days and finally got used to it being an integral part of his image.
“I’m not in the mood to stay any longer,” said Annalise. Finn put his arm around her, as she was methodically squashing what was left of her cigarette against the stone fountain - they were sitting there since the Aurors were gone.
“He is sweet, isn’t he?” Finn chuckled, flicking the ashes into the glass. “He thinks there is a potioneer who would care enough for trans people to break the law.”
This was the final straw. Harry strongly felt that if he didn’t go out and unwind right now, he wouldn’t be able to make it until the end of the week. He thanked the barman, grabbed the flyer and went out the back door to Disapparate, without letting himself think it through.
“I hope you didn’t get yourself cursed in the process,” Annalise said. It seemed like she was feeling better again.
Hermione gave me a reproachful look. She was convinced that I was acting childish, trying to avoid things. I was ready to compromise on many things, but not on the place where I was going to live.
“Yep,” Harry reacted instantly, and they Disapparated, leaving the edge of the lake as deserted as it was before their arrival.
Harry knew Tau faced constant alienation and enmity for his past, whatever that past may entail, and he couldn’t help but feel like Tau was comparing himself to Elliot. If he was right, he wondered how much Tau related to the character. It had occurred to Harry a few times, that it was too much of a coincidence that Tau should recommend ‘Faults of Alliance’ for him to read. It was the first book Tau had recommended, and he did say himself that he was more than curious of his opinion.
Draco: "Fucking brilliant. *He moaned.* I don't see why we need counselling, it should be optional at least."
"Mm hmm," Harry agreed through the last of his coffee. "If you see something else that you think is good then grab that too … you sure this is okay though Draco? I'm sure that–"
Luckily, Draco made no more illicit sounds, and it seems no one but himself had noticed the first one, but he did notice when Draco took a second large helping of the yule log, and soon enough … he went to take a third…
Blaise. "You know the first one is only mandatory right. Please whatever old hag is assessing you, and she won't write you up for more sessions. Pansy wasn't asked to go back, but I hear Long bottom cried!"
Harry had ignored him when he knocked on his door a while ago. He generally wanted to make sure he was okay, which was very un-Malfoy like, but they also needed to speak to McGonagall.
Draco: "You going to tell me why my boyfriend isn't his usual chipper self. You should be glowing after my excellent kissing."
“What happened Reece?” Asked Harry, his hand returning to Reece’s shoulder in what he hoped was a comforting gesture.
Draco used a charm to send no less than ten large snowballs speeding towards Harry’s face, and while Harry deflected them with a shield, Draco used the distraction to free his feet.
“Then what are you trying to say Miss Payne? The state you were in, that doesn’t happen just because one is afraid of disappointing a professor, or making a mistake with a potion. Your reaction was one of pure fear and panic.” Harry let that sink in before continued, noticing that Neville was now frowning. “I’d like you to tell us what really happen, Miss Payne, the truth. I can assure you that you will not be in any trouble.”
In the sweet shop, Harry had hand fed Draco a piece of chocolate from the free sample trays. Draco had returned the favor, after teasing him with the first piece he offered to Harry before eating it himself instead. Harry then managed to get the chocolate over the side of his lips as he ate it, which Draco tenderly wipe of - sucking his finger clean of it. Both boys where craving each others lips agian by then, so after paying for his every flavored beans and chocolate, they apparated to Harry house - 12 Grimmauld Place.
“Confiscated it.” Harry corrected smoothly. “A teacher is allowed to confiscate a students wand if he or she deems in necessary for the safety of the other students.”
Harry took a deep breath, readying his nerves for part two of his plan. Hopefully his question would keep Tau distracted long enough.
"Yes Draco, there are now twenty-three members of my adoptive family." Harry chuckled, "remind me not to try and do all the Weasley's in one day next year."
Draco: "For being made privy to your life that way. No one should have the right to your memories unless you want them to. We don't have to talk about them, I just ... how can the entire world be so oblivious?"
Silence feel between them, the Christmas music quietly resumed playing in the background of the book shop as they exited the elevator. They made their way to the queue so Harry could pay for Arthur's gift, and the customers talked as they proceeded to brows the thousands of books on sale, but Harry couldn't help but remember the way his Aunt had sent him to his cupboard when they got home…
It was just Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Molly for lunch. Arthur was still at work, George wasn't hungry, and the other Weasleys wouldn't be coming until Christmas eve. They were mid conversation, Molly asking them about 8th year so far, what they had done this year, and so on. Then she asked Ginny why she wasn't sitting with Harry.
“I knew he was a difficult student, his file was shockingly heavy, but I must admit I didn’t really read it all. I wondered if it was exaggerated due to his placement in Slytherin, and that his father’s been in Azkaban since the battle of Hogwarts. I decided to judge his character based on my own observations. It doesn’t look good for him I must say: always in detention, constantly losing house points, fighting with other students including those in his own house, and I’m always receiving complaints from teachers and students alike.”
“Hey Draco.” Harry greeted him with a nod, filling his mug with coffee. Caffeine had certainly become a necessity if he had any hope of getting through all the students’ homework, along with lesson plans and such.
“Draco is correct Harry! You can barely talk about the war as it is, watching the war will be worse.” Minerva’s expression was less stern and more concerned.
“What are you up to?” Harry blurted out before he could arrange his thoughts. He didn’t mean to sound accusing, but Malfoy had befuddled his brain. Before he could rephrase his question - or take it back and just accept his apology like he should have done in the first place - Malfoy had opened his mouth.
Poor Minerva was practically run off her feet: contacting and dealing with Camellia’s parents, trying to update the teachers as the evening progressed, speaking with Madam Pomfrey over the floo regarding Camellia’s health status, having to deal with one intimidating and forceful Mr Graves – who actually didn’t seem to intimidate her all - rather infuriate and annoyed her instead. She also found time to look over her glasses at Draco, who almost squirmed at the stern reproachful look she gave him as he slipped out of the hospital wing like a naughty first year caught out of bed past curfew.
“I don’t think this is such a good idea.” Said Draco, and he quickly slid past Harry to leave. Harry however grabbed Draco’s arm no more than three steps away from the pub.
Harry could hear the bitterness in Draco’s voice, and he could already guess the attitude that Graves held towards Draco. When they reached the headmistresses office – behind the gargoyle and up the spiral stairs, he got to witness that very hostility.
Draco: "Are you mad? They will dig up our past, ask difficult question, and then manufacture some complete cock-and-bull story because it increases their profits. It will be complete fabrication with no truth to it at all - painting us once agian as bad guy corrupts the chosen one."
Draco eventually went back to Hogwarts. His arm had stopped bleeding, and it was sore, but he didn't give a shit as he climbed into bed that night.
close. But is was ridiculous - wasn't it? Draco sodding Malfoy would never mean anything to him - could never mean anything to him, at least not in the way he was imagining ... but as impossible as it seemed, there was apart of Draco - the real Draco, that could mean everything to him.
"What age range would you be happy with in a partner?" Malaise smiled affably, her wide blue eyes peering up at him over her purple spectacles as she leaned over the parchment.
Harry did eventually leave him sitting alone by his crackling fire, a hot coffee in his hands and a blanket over his legs. He wanted to write to Padfoot, but he felt such guilt. Why was it okay for him to corrupt Padfoot’s life and not Harry’s? Well, that was rather simple, Padfoot wasn’t the chosen one!
It was on his way back to his own chambers, feeling rather guilty for leaving Draco in the infirmary like that, that he realised his care for the man ran a lot deeper than he had thought possible.
At least Draco hadn’t cancelled their coffee meeting tomorrow, but Harry couldn’t see the man ever giving him a chance at a relationship.
-Everyone is preparing to leave Herbology, Draco still won't look at him as he shoves his things away quickly.
“It’s my old school uniform Potter.” Draco informed him, but that much was very obvious – right down to the ugly pointed hat they used to wear during the starting feasts and such. The green underside of his black cloak looked brighter somehow – as did the green in his stripped tie, and
Harry sighed in resignation and ran his fingers through his messy black hair. He knew he shouldn’t be so quick to think the worst but … it was Malfoy! Then again, it was ‘Draco’ now, and the blond hadn’t done anything so erroneous yet to make him act so defensive and cagey towards him. How was he to get to know Draco if he always reacted in the negative to him, if he was always so on guard and defensive? He forced himself back to a calm posture and decided that he’d have to trust him. If Harry wanted an amicable work relationship with him, trust had to go both ways.
He was giving himself a headache; that kind of thinking was far to complex for his mind and he wasn’t ashamed to admit it either, but there was the other thought Tau had given him.
“My – My…” Harry tried to speak, pointing up at the bathroom cabinet. The visions where fading, but his breathing was so erratic that vertigo was settling in dangerously. The pain threatened to undo years of therapy, and he was humiliated to be caught in this state by anyone let alone Draco Malfoy.
“Well it’s not! I don’t need you trying to cause issues where there aren’t any.” Harry snapped, slamming his hands down on the table as he stood up, and he glared at the blond. Draco had no right to question his ability to teach. How dare he! “My teaching ability has nothing to do with you!”
“It left because you scared it away.” Harry said, cursing himself – he felt like he was just fucking this up and making it worse... he sounded like bloody imbecile!
Harry walked out of the bathroom and into his bedroom, a dark green towel wrapped around his waist. He’d decided to wash away the stress of the day, to let the cool water relax his muscles and give him time to think about what had happened with Malfoy. He still wasn’t sure what to make of him, but he’d decided that it was his turn to apologise. That in itself was just weird, but his last two encounters with Malfoy had been a disaster.
Harry knocked on Draco’s office door … but there was no answer. If Draco wasn’t in his office, then he was most likely in his private room seeing as there was no reason for him to be in the potions’ classroom today. They walked in silence to Draco’s private chambers, but again, when he knocked, there was no answer ... until Harry swore that he heard a muffled groan. He knocked louder, listening closer to the door … a sudden wave of concern washed over him when he only heard a loud thump.
Professor McGonagall: "Even though no one else in the school has any recollection of such events, and your work is above average with no missing homework or classes?"
Madam Pomfrey nodded before swiftly leaving with her medical bag. Harry turned to face Samuel, who was sitting on one of the beds waiting for him – luckily, the boy had gained back his voice as they had reached the infirmary a couple of minutes ago.
Draco went into his mind agian, thinking it over. Then he looked into Harry's green eyes, he trusted him.
“Just brilliant.” Harry sarcastically muttered, but at least Kreacher’s magic had made the bed feel like a greenhouse in the peak of summer.
It was probably some elaborate trick and spell Draco had cast to fuck with him. He was just about to enter the Great Hall, when someone grabbed his arm. Draco, pulled him into the storage room to the left of the Great Hall, and shut the door behind him.
Harry was back to staring at the magical parchment, but this time he was in his private chambers, sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by essays and homework he had yet to grade.
He was alone this year, but it was something of a comfort to know that Harry would be staying at Hogwarts likewise. He would have company, and he had Padfoot to talk with. He still hadn’t asked Padfoot to meet with him, and although he wanted to, he was still afraid. Would Padfoot even agree to the meeting?
“Congratulations Mr Avery, you are at the apogee of my patience.” Draco drawled, keeping his voice calm, but Harry could almost feel his rage heating the room. “You have no right to address another teacher with such blatant disrespect. I don’t care who you are. You may not like everyone of your teachers, I may not like all of my students, but respect is fundamental if you wish to achieve anything in your life. This is your last warning Mr Avery: If your behaviour and attitude does not improve, if you anger me again, or if you so much as cough wrong… I will see to it that you are expelled. Do I make myself clear?”
Thankfully, Poppy had returned not long after Kreacher had left, with a case of Warmendall potions ready to go.
love with Potter! He refused to believe that his swirling stomach, sweating palms, and raised heart rate meant anything more than simply too much chocolate… and Harry had rudely taken away his yule log for crying out loud! Okay, that was a lame excuse, he’d admit it… and he’d even go as far to admit that he was grateful Potter hadn’t let him embarrass himself further… but… he just could not be with Potter! It wasn’t possible. It wasn’t logical…
"Right, come through Mr Potter! Don't be nervous now. You're probably feeling a little out of sorts due to the Crelamotia flowers. Terrible this time of year, absolutely terrible! Yes, August comes and they fill everyone's heads with fluff. I blame the latona - invisible little spores with a mind of their own, but the flowers are ones of love and everyone reacts differently."
Harry: "The truth. They didn't like me leaving - being the Christmas holidays, but Molly understood."
“It might, a tad … but you’re a Gryffindor through and through Potter … Harry.” Draco frowned, curious to where this was leading.
Tau’s family could have been followers, leading Tau to follow just as blindly. That would explain his strong opinion of Elliot blindly following Azorren, but it could also just be a matter of opinion. Tau could also feel that way simply because that’s what he believes, but again ... it just felt like a deeper reason.
“Charms?” Draco inquired; it was all he could say right now. This gift was so suited to himself, so shocking and appreciated, that he just lost his thoughts to surprise.
“Sure, why not.” Harry’s smile grew slightly when he saw Draco’s shoulders relax. Draco was relieved that he had accepted his invite, and it made Harry wonder why. What had changed?
“I won’t be long.” He shouted, hoping that once he was done and back to his room, that Harry would allow him some solitude.
Harry answered many questions after that, and they were a lot easier: height, hair colour, eye colour, physique, and then some stranger questions like: One sentence that your closest friends might use to explain you? What are you passionate about? What is your ultimate goal in life?
Harry was out of his chair and out the door like a shot, a hastily thrown, “Thanks Cloval,” over his shoulder as he ran.
Draco certainly wasn’t going to admit that Har-Potter, was simply the first person he'd though to call for assistance. “You've already expressed the desire to deal with Mr Avery yourself, so I thought you’d want to know. If you wish to tell her head of house, or Minerva, then by all means, but I’m serious Potter, the girl was in a right state and may even need to visit the hospital wing.”
“I’m touched by your solicitude Potter. If your idea of friendship is kidnapping, then I think you need your head examined.” Draco practically screamed.
The sadness in his words, the hidden, desperate need to be seen for himself and not what others wanted to see - Harry could relate.
-Blaise goes back to Harry, like he is explaining the situation while singing. Gesticulating with his words.
Harry put out his hand for Draco to shake, but he just sneered at it. Draco wanted Harry's friendship at the start of first year - and yes he'd gone about the wrong way as usual, but Harry had rejected him. It was probably a good thing too seeing how things had transpired once the Dark Lord returned, but he believed Harry would be better of away from him - even now. If Harry Potter - the savior of the wizarding world was caught making pleasantries with a Death Eater, well ... shit would certainly fly.
Harry tried to think about what he knew of Slytherin hidden messages… what would be the correct response to a homesick Slytherin?
Harry looked down at his parchment and frowned. It had the instructions and details of the spell written upon it in his handwriting, yet he vaguely remembered learning about this charm last Monday. Picking up his wand, he tried to master the complex spell.
“Oof!” Harry had managed to steady the boy by grabbing his shoulders, but Harry still managed to be to be subjected to a speeding face colliding into his stomach. “Mr Bartlett! Running, is not permitted in the corridors. I’m afraid I must deduct ten-” Harry suddenly realised that the small, dark-brown haired boy in front of him, was trying valiantly not to cry and had forced his posture to look contrite. “What’s the matter Mr Bartlett?” Harry asked, kneeling down on one knee to be closer to the boy’s eye level.
He wrinkled his face at the disgusting, burning taste as the potion went down the hatch. The sensation it caused was not unlike Firewhisky, but the heat radiated outwards from his stomach until it had pervaded his entire body. He felt so hot, yet his hands, his feet and his other extremities were still painfully cold. He’d heard of the Snowflu, but wasn’t it a virus that children caught from diminutive pixies? He went to make his inquiries, but Poppy was handing him yet another potion.
Draco decided to drop the subject for now, Harry obviously didn't want to talk about it, but something was troubling the man. It was another thing to file away in his mind.
Harry was between his leg on the floor, Ron to his right and Hermione next to Ron - in a sort of circle - the cards on the floor. Ron went next, reveling the  'Epoximise' charm-  transformation spell that bonds two objects together.  Ron failed again, maybe being put on the spot wasn't doing him any favors - but Hermione was right, the N.E.W.T.s would be like that. Ron had to suffer the 'Langlock' jinx, which was an improvement seeing as the jinx affixes tongue to the roof of the mouth. It was nice to see Harry laughing.
Harry caught Duncan Gibson, passing a note to Monica Reid. He held out his hand and used wandless non-verbal magic to summon the note to himself. He looked at the note –
"Erm, yeah." Harry frowned in though of how best to explain. "They hold a certain amount of power… like energy. Once it runs out, the battery is useless. Well some batteries can actually be re-charged, which means that… you can fill them with energy again."
Harry looked pointedly at Draco, willing the man to understand that he deserved forgiveness and freedom, but Draco just stared at his mug. Harry could see him discreetly biting at the inside of his cheek, his breathing increased ever so slightly, and his glossy grey eyes closed for that moment too long. Harry couldn’t help but rub his thumb over the back of Draco’s hand, but he stayed silent – waiting for Draco to find his voice.
“What do you need?” Draco asked, his coin-grey eyes still alight with humour and warmth. Harry thought the look suited Draco, made him look attractive and friendly.
-Draco picks up the wand first and teases him, they end up chest to chest and stare at each other with a sort of longing.
Draco watched as Harry removed his glasses and rubbed the space between his eyes. What was going through that mind of his?
Harry blinked in shock, taken aback; the fact that Draco had noticed so many of his idiosyncrasies was both endearing and alarming… disturbing in fact. He hadn’t thought about his habits as a whole before, never thought about what they would look like to people around him.
“Fifty point will be taken from Slytherin…” Draco glared at the boy. “And you will remain behind. The rest off you may be dismissed!” Draco was obviously angry.
“If it’s a childhood virus, then why is it affecting him now?” Harry asked, there would always be parts of the wizarding world that eluded him, parts that he had yet to learn about.
He watched the fire dance, burning and consuming that which feed it, and he wondered… would he be like that. Would the flames only burn until he no longer had anything to give, leaving Padfoot extinguished and cold. No, he certainly couldn’t do that a man that was kind, accepting, and wanted only to be love wholeheartedly.
He had planned to make a quick, but elegant, rush to his bedroom, but he’d almost tripped as he caught Draco standing there in his living-room, taking in the sight and gawping at him. He smiled shyly, “I’ll just… Give me five minutes,” he stuttered, and ducked his head as he disappeared into his bedroom.
Harry shoves past Draco, and Draco grabs his arm - quickly letting it go with his hands up to show he isn't being confrontational or anything.
me he targets – despite that being the most obvious outcome.” Harry explained. He glanced at Draco, wondering when the blond started to care for his safety.
he thought, pulling one out of the draws to join the black jeans now laid out on his bed … it was Christmas after all, and Molly would have sent him another knitted jumper.
“You haven’t opened yours yet.” Draco raised his eyebrow, looking at the gift still unopened in Harry’s hands.
Draco found himself watching the skin on Harry's neck flush in embarrassment, and his lips tingled with a sudden desire to press into it, to taste and mould into that neck. He wanted it, wanted to do it, but it would be a
“Draco, ask yourself this,” Harry whispered, leaning over the table and trying not to laugh, “do you really want to interrupt Poppy’s Christmas because you foolishly got sick? She looks really happy right now, don’t you think?” He turned his head to surreptitiously look toward the healer before continuing. “Enjoying her food and taking a well-earned break – no one in her infirmary. And Minerva,” he flicked his eyes over to the headmistress, “do you really want to deal with her ire, today of all days…”
normal and nonchalant, even if he was desperately trying to chase away his growing feeling for the raven-haired Gryffindor – feelings that were still like weeds, weeds that refused to die no matter how much herbicide he used.
Seamus: "'ey 'arry! 'ave you seen the daily prophet? Sickening ... really. I thought you'd be better then dat - snogging a death eater. You as welcome 'er as he is."
He took Harry’s black tie, throwing over his own neck for the moment, and then undid the buttons on Harry’s light grey shirt. He was amazed that Harry was letting him do this, but he worked quickly and was soon fastening the buttons the correct way … before he could admire Harry’s chest or think any further about removing Harry’s shirt entirely. It was a fantasy he couldn’t afford, but as he fixed Harry’s tie into place, he couldn’t help but become increasingly aware of Harry’s breathing, of their proximity, of his own hands slowing in their work. He finished the perfect tie knot, and was about to remove his hands, when Harry caught his wrist.
Harry glanced around the room, spotting the knitted sacramento-green throw that rested over the back of the other leather sofa. He grabbed it, and as he was it laying over Draco, he heard the man mumble – “The klapities won’t go away! Make them to go away!” Draco then started crying …
-Harry and Draco standing next to each other outside the Burrow - in the Christmas snow, Harry's Barn owl landing on his shoulder - and nipping his ear affectionately.
“Wait! Walburga?” Draco turned to face Harry. “As in Auntie Walburga?” When Harry nodded, he asked - “Why do you have her portrait here?”
“Do you always have a strong proclivity for meat?” Draco asked, going for his own plate. Harry had to think what that word meant for a moment and frowned, but it seems he took to long. “Prefer Potter. I’ve noticed you always chose to fill your plate with meat.” Draco explained, adding some salad, a few stuffed vol-au-vents, and devilled eggs to his own plate.
It was time to let go of his childish fantasies, of love and acceptance, and it was time to let Padfoot go… no matter how hard it would be. He was a cold hearted Slytherin, he could do what needed to be done.
Harry placed his hand over Draco’s then, grey eyes snapping to meet his own before returning to his cup.
“You can change your mind you know; you don’t have to do this.” Draco was still concerned that Harry would have flash backs. He’d come to care a great deal about Harry.
-Draco's heads spinning with all the new information. Sitting at a cafe - Hermione's showing him a book about muggles, he catches Harry's eyes instead.
"Harry calm down!" Draco told him. They had just got back to the Harry's private rooms at Hogwarts with all the shopping. "It's only the 22nd, we can go and get something tomorrow."
Harry righted himself and saw that Draco was eyeing him with a strange expression. The Stoick mask of stubborn indifference was there, along with a look of indignation, but there was also something else … something that Harry didn’t ponder over because his mouth was already asking – “Why are you ignoring me? We need to talk about our plans for Silas.”
Draco didn’t know why, but that strange feeling of betrayal and dishonesty pulsed through his veins once again. He looked over Harry and blinked. He had been spending an awful amount of time in Harry’s company lately, and he enjoyed every minute of it. Could he be developing feelings for the golden boy?
“I know a place. It will be deserted anyway at this time of day, but I can ward the area as well to be safe. I’ll take a calming draught with me - I always do anyway if I’m not at work or at home. I haven’t needed it in ages though, so, I doubt I’ll need it again. I’m sure today was just a one off.” Harry smiled, raising to his feet and stretching.
Everything he'd been taught was apparently wrong. Everything his family did he was starting to question, and now he had no money, and no one to go home to. Hogwarts had been his last hope, and now that everyone wanted him gone - for the things he was
“Good!” Harry nodded. He would be a nervous wreck waiting for Tau to ask Padfoot that very question, and even more nervous about revealing his identity to him, but he had to take the risk too. Harry downed the last of his whisky and then stood up. “I best be going. I have to get some sleep so I can grade all them bloody essays I assigned this week. Why do we do it to ourselves huh?”
“Why do I feel like there is history between the two of you?” Draco suddenly asked. Harry was impressed with his observational skills.
When Harry glanced at the magical parchment the next morning, he expected it to be blank. His heart whooped childishly however, when he saw a new message upon the parchment, a smile instantly taking over his lips as he started to read.
Harry was sitting by the Great Lake, holding Ginny Weasley's hand, and facing out across the water. Draco Malfoy wasn't far, with his two best friends Blaise Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. Draco had been climbing the giant apple tree, and he couldn't help but turn to watch him yet again.
“Did she say why?” Harry asked, rushing from his room as he threw on his robe. Apparently, he was ready to go.
It was a bloody mess! He needed time to come to terms with this revelation before he could answer his own questions. He also needed a little more proof that Draco was the one writing to him – not his beautiful illusion of Tau, before he fully gave into this new fact and let his illusion crumble completely.
alternative option – but he was assuming that Draco would never talk to him again after it did, and because of that belief, he wanted to wait until he’d shown his memories to Mr Silas Avery; until they had dealt with that boy to the best of their abilities, they couldn’t risk being at odds with one another.
Draco continued to cry, not saying anything, and not even when Poppy came over to treat the scratches and broken skin did Draco utter another word. He just let her treat him in silence, his tears drying on his cheeks. Poppy had asked what had happened, but Draco had gone so deathly silent, just staring down at his own lap, that they were worried about him.
“Ah yes. Miss Payne has been taking extra potions lessons with me. I know she has the ability; she did manage to get exceeds expectations in her OWLs, but with the difficultly level increase of her potions class this year she just needs the extra practice and study time. I believe it was her nerves that have been causing her disastrous start of term, at least where her potions were concerned.”
“And you’re not the only good person to do so.” Harry sighed, hoping that Draco finally understood. “Draco, we’ve all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on in the end. You chose not to commit murder, you chose to protect your family – your mother, you chose to stay brave in the darkest of places, and you chose give me time to flee when you didn’t disclose my identity. Your situation was impossible, the choices you made were for good reasons, and you were a teenager!”
Madam Pomfrey: "You two boys are lucky you didn't do serious harm to each other. You will both need plenty of sleep tonight if you want those bones to heal."
Harry stared at his coffee mug, remembering the bright white nine-and three-quarters, where he’d spoken with Dumbledore and seen that horrible form of Tom, where he’d assumed death had come for him. The most vivid part of that memory however, was that of Tom’s tiny, shrivelled, emaciated body.
Draco sat up slowly - still deep in thought, but he was about to try and explain his past thirty minutes ramblings to Harry, when that poxy radio popped into existence.
“Madam Pomfrey will be able to help Camellia better if she’s able to work alone. Trust me, Pomfrey only gets stressed when there are other people around. I’m sure you understand that when your stress you don’t do so well on things.” Harry explained. When Reece nodded begrudgingly, Harry continued. “Good lad. Now wait here a moment.”
“Oh, do be quiet Potter!” Draco said. “I’m not going to listen to you put doubt into my mind any longer. Padfoot is a kind, generous, and wonderful wizard!”
-Wednesday 18th November: Draco getting annoyed that she won't release him from counseling sessions.
Harry scratched his neck. “Yeah. I was just…” Harry removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. “…Just wondering if you fancied an evening picnic? It’s nearly five – we have to get back to Hogwarts soon, but I need the fresh air to be honest. I also want to finish explaining the horcruxes to you before I lose my nerve and never tell you.”
“What do I get for sharing private details of my life with you?” Harry asked, slowly placing his coffee down on the table and folding his arms.
When the lesson ended - and they were in the corridors alone. Harry pinned Draco against the wall, tongue deep in his mouth and as hard as a boulder. He could feel Draco against his thighs.
Harry looked at Draco, he was sitting there pouting angrily with his arms crossed in defiance. He noticed the bowl of runny hot porridge, the berries on top of it, and the rather dry toast that sat on a plate next to the bowl. It certainly wasn’t pancakes and ice-cream.
-Sunday 14th March. Harry slips into Draco's room, smiles at his lover, then joins him for a very heated but loving kiss. His hands working at Draco's shirt buttons slowly, while Draco tugs at Harry's hair to kiss him deeper.
The winter solstice – the longest night, which was a few days ago, would now give way to light as the days grew longer once again. Draco was blessing him, expressing his desire for him, Padfoot, to be wrapped in light, in his arms, and have a fruitful year. He alluded to the new year, using the French word for love, and implying that with the coming year Padfoot would only grow more beautiful.
Harry pulled Draco to his chest, allowing himself to be used as support so the man didn’t fall to the ground in a sobbing mess. He knew that this was point of shame for Draco - to allow himself to be seen this way, but he also knew that it was necessary.
Screaming, kicking, and blazing with an inferno of obvious, were the words that neither dared speak. The troll in the room, the lump in their throats, the heart beats almost loud enough to hear…
Harry sighed and shook his head; he hated having to discipline his students - it really did stir up guilty emotions for him, but once again, he knew it was necessary. Give the student to much leeway and you’ll end up down the road to chaos. He wrote a quick note excusing their tardiness to charms, and handed it to them.
“This doesn’t leave the house!” Harry stressed, taking a sip of liquid courage. “What I have to say is classified –
Draco: "Then what? Come on, you're the famous, brilliant Harry fucking Potter. The chosen one. I guess no one is good enough for you unless their fucking perfect! Considering you couldn't save everyone, you're not so fucking perfect yourself."
“Thank you, sir.” Samuel nodded. They walked until they were about to go separate ways – Samuel to catch desert in the Great Hall, and Harry to the dungeons. “Sir?”
Malfoy heir’. Harry also knew, that Draco felt like his father was never proud of him growing up – nothing every satisfied Malfoy senior, and there was always more that Draco had to learn.
“Of course not,” said Draco firmly, before his eyes softened. “I can only guess at how they treat you, Harry, but from what I’ve seen, and from how determined Mother is to get you out of there, I can imagine.”
Harry’s heart was jackhammering in his chest. He hadn’t realised he’d been that transparent; a single week at Hogwarts and already he was flaunting his weaknesses on his face, just like he’d spent his whole childhood teaching himself not to do. Disgust twisted his stomach again.
Harry wandered past the enclosures, peering through the glass of each one, but he didn’t stay at any for long. For some reason he felt like there was something he needed to see, and though he wasn’t quite sure what it was, Harry wasn’t in the habit of ignoring his instincts.
Harry thought, recalling his desperate escape the previous summer. The sight of the bars outside his window, twisted and warped from where the force of Harry’s magic had crashed into them from within, was still lodged in the back of his mind. The idea that he had done that – that he was capable of such impact – was both thrilling and a little terrifying. His embarrassing explosion in his first year dredged up similar feelings, particularly in that the latter ended with him in the hospital wing. Two years at Hogwarts and Harry was quite sick of the amount of time he had already spent under Madam Pomfrey’s care.
“You can follow us,” said Harry, “Or you can try whatever your plan was before we got here. Actually, did you even have a plan?”
By the time class was over, Harry was so tense he thought he might explode. Snape had a habit of leaning over the shoulders of his students threateningly, and if that wasn’t enough, an anxious looking Gryffindor named Longbottom blew up his cauldron towards the end of class. All in all, Harry had rather hated his first Potions lesson – though he and Blaise had brewed a perfect potion due to Harry’s snapshot memory and Blaise’s previous experience from tutoring – and he doubted his following ones would be any different.
Eventually they could postpone no longer. Harry and Draco made their way down to the Manor’s floo room, hands clasped together tightly. Draco would let go once they entered the Ministry, Harry knew, and he held no judgement for it – the carefully cultivated image of the Malfoy heir left no room for public weakness, especially not at his father’s trial. Still, Harry found himself dreading letting go; he found the thought of withdrawing any level of comfort from his best friend to be entirely upsetting.
Aragog clicked in response, fangs the size of tree trunks catching the lantern light. “Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.”
“So, anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s marked him down as his next victim, it’s best he keep a low profile for a week.”
Behind her, George opened his mouth – no doubt to point out the pun – but the sixth sense of a medi-witch seemed to inform Madam Pomfrey of imminent tomfoolery, and a flick of her wand caused the white curtain around the twins’ conjoined beds to promptly shut before a single letter could be said.
The stranger didn’t look like he believed him, but he said nothing. He turned away to a wall of keys behind him and selected one for Harry.
It HAS been a year, whoops, so I'm not sure how good this chapter is. But I'm feeling a hell of a lot better than I have in ages, so I'm just happy the passion to write is back. Hope you guys like it!
Dumbledore smiled back, just as kindly. Harry thought it looked like defeat. “Of course,” the old wizard said, and excused himself back to his school.
“Merlin, it all makes sense,” Blaise shook his head and leaned back in his chair where they had settled in the quiet of Hermione’s sanctuary – the library. “It’s Salazar Slytherin,
She was. Neither of the two spoke for several hours after that, and in fact the next time either of them looked up from their books it was to be ushered out of the library by Madam Pince, only thirty minutes before curfew.
Harry turned just quickly enough – which was still rather slowly – to get a mouthful of wild brown hair and a
Harry looked from one twin to the other, as one introduced himself as Fred, and the other as George.
Harry thought he saw Draco’s face twist in annoyance for a second, but he was too busy grinning to analyse it. “Seriously? So it’s us three then, yeah?”
Harry jerked his head up at Hermione’s cry, squinting through the dark just to see Blaise drop through the ceiling and land with a ‘thud’ next to him.
But Narcissa just tilted her head, raising her eyebrows in an innocently quizzical expression. “Why, it appears there
Blaise ruffled his hair with an exasperated look, and Pansy latched onto his other side just as dramatically as Daphne had. Theodore watched him for a very long time, before placing a steadying hand on his shoulder. It was a far more reserved approach than the other Slytherins had, but from Theodore it was a lot, and Harry appreciated the silent support nonetheless.
At the same time, Dudley Dursley was complaining (rather loudly) about his lack of an adequate amount of gifts in front of a pile of thirty-six neatly wrapped presents. This was not
“I could ask the same of you, Parkinson,” Weasley replied, though the scorn in his voice was notably weaker than usual.
. He went through everything he had read about that charm in his head, trying to keep his attention away from the nightmare surrounding him while also focussing on keeping his fingers tight in Blaise’s jacket in front of him. The only thing worse than being in a crowd was being lost and alone in a crowd.
The door opened mere seconds later to the giant of a man Harry remembered from his first day at Hogwarts – the one who had directed him and the other first years into the boats that would carry them to their new home.
The torch flared, momentarily brushing back the shadows of the castle, and Harry stepped back with a sharp inhale.
Harry almost couldn’t get the words out as he looked around and realised that in the time Hermione had been attempting to strangle him to death – though it was very welcome – he had been entirely encircled by his friends. Theo stood scant inches from Hermione, with one hand, Harry noticed, poised ready to catch her should she fall from her rather precarious spot on Harry’s bed; then Daphne, her arm linked with Pansy’s, whose other hand was gripping tightly to Millicent; then Neville and a tearful Tracey; then Blaise, who shockingly enough was standing in front of a very awkward looking Ron Weasley; and then Draco. Draco, who stood as close to Harry’s bedside as he could manage with Hermione still half on top of him. Draco, whose eyes were just a little red around the waterline. Draco, who grasped Harry’s free hand from his side and held so tightly that it was both comfort and slightly painful. Draco, who leaned in very close once Hermione had collected herself enough to remove herself from Harry and was busy embarrassedly brushing her robes free of lint, and said with a voice thick with quiet fear, “You have to stop leaving me behind.”
They dived together into the trench surrounding the pitch, Harry following the Snitch, and Teakel and the Bludger following Harry. The sound of the rogue ball smashing wooden beams behind them startled Teakel into a scream, but she kept her spot. Harry didn’t dare look back as he spun between two beams, and he heard Teakel finally lift up out of the danger zone. She kept close above him, but Harry could already feel the excitement building in his chest as the Snitch buzzed out of the trench towards the centre of the pitch, extending one arm towards it-
they were friends, all of them, and yet here he was, alone in his brand new bedroom at Number 4, Privet Drive, twelve years old, and he had not a single letter from any of the wonderful people he remembered.
had not once been acknowledged in the Dursley household in all the ten years Harry had been living there. Each night after his birthday had been and gone, Harry told himself that he did not care about this injustice. This was the only time he permitted lying to himself, and he had made it almost a game to see how convincing he could be. This, because of its regularity, was normal.)
Draco gave the ghost a filthy glare and pulled Harry’s arm until they were standing together at the top of the stairs into the Chamber. “We’re going, now.”
“Headmaster Dumbledore,” she said, as the old wizard came into view from behind Petunia. “I’m afraid Harry and I were merely stopping by for a moment. My son is still in Diagon Alley, you see, and Harry has books to buy.”
“Try looking at the snake,” said Blaise. His eyes were just slightly squinted in that way Harry was learning meant he was deep in thought. “Imagine it’s real.”
“It’s not uncommon for a traditional pureblood home to be frightening,” said Theo. His eyes seemed even more solemn than usual. “Those of us who are lucky find ways to cope.”
In the end, it was Harry’s own respect for the Lady Malfoy that led him to not open the letter. She had asked him not to, after all, and he couldn’t bear to imagine having the depths of Narcissa’s disappointment directed his way. Still, something told him it was best to get the letter delivered quickly. A glance outside revealed the sun had risen into the sky. Petunia would almost certainly be awake, making breakfast for her family – Harry, of course, not included.
Hermione beamed at him, and tucked a lock of bushy brown hair behind one ear. It bounced back to frame her face only a second later, but she didn’t seem to mind.
. I just thought I should read ahead seeing as I’ve already finished this year’s books, and-” she went quiet, biting her lip uncertainly.
“Yeah, I meant to ask,” Harry frowned, recalling the author from his own list of books. “Who is Gilderoy Lockhart?”
“Well, Harry certainly won’t be picking the other side, will he?” Blaise replied dryly. “Besides, that’s not the point. The point is I think everyone in this room has at least some idea of the decisions we’re going to have to make in the future, and Tracey’s right. We have to decide how far we’re willing to go.”
Harry Potter did not consider himself particularly adept at giving comfort, yet everything in him felt, at this moment, desperate to try. Perched carefully atop an expensive chaise within Draco’s bedroom (the luxury of the Manor still uncomfortably foreign to him, despite several weeks within its walls), Harry watched as his best friend rearranged his robes for the hundredth time that morning.
Harry eyed the enchanted harp in the corner of the room. The melody it played was soft and unfamiliar, but Fluffy seemed to like it, as he was snoring in time with the gentle music.
Narcissa raise one perfect brow. She had close to a foot on the ex-prefect and was capable of the most intimidating glance Harry had ever seen, but Gemma wasn’t cowed. His respect for Gemma kicked up an extra notch.
Harry ate little at the Welcoming Feast. This was partially because it was quite uncomfortable, eating under the stares of every person in the Great Hall, and partially because he had never had opportunity to eat so freely before – but Harry tried not to think about the latter reason.
“It’s a remembrall,” Tracey said, coming up alongside. “It turns red when you’ve forgotten something.”
Harry moved his gaze from the hundreds of fluttering winged keys above their heads to look at her. “How so?”
“Just telling the truth, Potter,” she said, flicking her hair, before storming away with Pansy still grumbling at her side.
“The monster is a basilisk?” Ron furrowed his brow at them while the twins moved forward to investigate the sinks. “How do you know?”
The Dursleys had sent him a fifty pence coin taped to a piece of paper, which he cast aside without another thought. Hagrid, startlingly enough, had sent him a carved wooden flute. Harry hadn’t thought to send him anything – after all, they weren’t exactly friends – but decided it was Hagrid’s choice to send him things if he wanted to. Hermione had given him a large book on the alphabet of rare magical creatures – Harry laughed when he read out ‘c’ for Cerberus on the third page, and again when he thought of his own gift to her (an equally large book on the history of several important wizarding figures). They knew each other well. He had sent Neville a self-expanding Herbologist’s notebook, and received a book on the best brooms of the 20
“Ah, that may be so,” the Headmaster smiled again, “But nothing is stronger than the bonds of family, don’t you agree? You are, after all, not Harry’s mother – I’m sure the comfort of his aunt and uncle will be quite strong enough.”
was not charmed to be self-updating and rather came out in volumes. The earliest of the two Narcissa had sent dated ten years before Harry was born. There were no portraits in this book – just layers upon layers of tiny, cursive script. Harry squinted at the page until his eyes watered. He found Narcissa’s name first, though even that took close to an hour. She was bookended by her siblings, the woman named Bellatrix on one side and-
The two eventually made their way back to Number 4, much to Harry’s displeasure, but Minerva reassured him with a few simple words.
Neville went bright red. “I- uh, it’s used for transfigurations, P-Professor. To reverse transfigurations.”
Harry hadn’t brought anything. He didn’t know what to bring – there was nothing he could give them that would be enough aside from solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry looked up. Adrian Pucey jumped the remaining five stairs to the Common Room and fixed Gemma with a judgemental stare.
Professor McGonagall’s eyes narrowed a fraction, before she simply nodded. “Then perhaps we should go for a walk?”
Narcissa’s expression perfectly mimicked surprise. “Oh my,” she said. “That’s perfectly awful! I can assure you, however, the wards of Malfoy Manor are far more advanced than the protection of any muggle residence.” She avoided putting any inflection on the word ‘muggle’, but Harry thought Dumbledore could taste the disdain anyway.
Harry jumped back at the word – he and Draco had found that spell together, so he was ready for the large black snake slithering forth from his friend’s wand. Draco was grinning, cocky, but Harry simply smirked right back. He had a secret weapon after all.
Hermione was obviously still fuming, but she stopped arguing. Whether this was because of Harry’s placation or Madam Pince’s admonishment, Harry didn’t know.
The screaming lessened immediately. Professor Sprout gestured for them to remove their earmuffs, and beamed.
“They won’t tell anyone,” Neville said hurriedly. “At least, I don’t think so. They get in trouble lots, anyway. They’re not like Ron.”
Harry thought that over for a moment, before tilting his head to one side and meeting Blaise’s black eyes. “And your parents?”
Harry didn’t look back as he followed suit, and tried awfully hard not to think about how every time he left his friends, it felt more and more like a final goodbye.
Draco froze. Wide, frightened blue eyes locked on Harry, but Harry wasn’t looking. He was too busy trying to focus on the hulking shape moving towards them, accompanied by a sick, wet, clicking. He could hear the exact moment Draco turned enough to see the thing, however, because a sound came from the youngest Malfoy’s throat he was sure he had never heard before, halfway between choking terror and a cut-off shout.
Eventually they pulled back, and Pansy once again broke the silence, wiping her face with one sleeve.
“But who’s to say it’s the same creature now as it was back then?” Draco pointed out. “An Acromantula is perfectly capable of killing someone; maybe that’s what it did fifty years ago, and now it’s something different.”
Millicent laughed in delight, and even Harry couldn’t resist a small smile as Lockhart crumpled to the ground.
Harry’s heart was beating faster than it ever had before. He forced his fingers to keep still, and instead clenched the muscles of his thigh – and felt the sharp lines of the Stone in his pocket press onto his leg. The Philosopher’s Stone was in his pocket. The Elixir of Life was in his pocket. Oh
made him jump. Hedwig, his snowy white owl, was glaring at him through the bars of her cage. She pecked pointedly at the large lock on the cage door, the key for which was sitting comfortably on Harry’s Uncle Vernon’s belt.
Tracey was already shaking her head. “It’ll be like this all day. We just need to get it over with.”
“That’s reason enough for dislike, maybe even hatred, but you tense up whenever he comes near,” Blaise spoke like they were discussing the weather, and somehow he made his perch upon the desk look like a lazy sprawl. “It’s painfully obvious, you know. So what I want to know is
Harry smiled, a genuine smile of carefree happiness. “I’ll be your best friend too, Draco,” he replied.
The twins disappeared in a flash of red hair, and Harry found himself sitting alone in a compartment. Thankfully, Harry didn’t mind being alone, and with a small smile he settled himself down to read through his first year Transfiguration text (Professor McGonagall had recommended it, stating that Transfiguration was the most complex subject of the year and he may enjoy it – it had been his father’s best subject, after all).
twins a favour, for Merlin’s sake. They’ll get you to do something horrible. We should tell Professor Snape.”
Harry looked up from his Potions homework that evening to see Draco and Blaise standing in front of him. Blaise was impassive, though Harry thought he saw a slight smile twitch at his lips, and Draco was beaming.
Harry felt as if he had been the one Petrified, but something in him was stirring. He couldn’t let this pass. Whatever the beast in the Chamber was, whoever had set it free – they wouldn’t stand a chance. He was young and inexperienced but he had learned his power since coming to Hogwarts. He was strong enough – angry enough – to do this.
Harry looked at his friends with new eyes, distracted for a moment from his own anxiety. He thought of Blaise’s quiet understanding at every turn; Theo’s silence and solemnity; the way Daphne and Astoria clutched at each other like lifelines. He noted Millicent’s clenched fists; Tracey’s averted eyes; the way Pansy was gnawing at her lip so fiercely he thought it might bleed. He saw Draco, staring out the window with damp cheeks.
Harry took a deep breath himself before grabbing a small fistful of floo powder. He was looking forward to the travel about as much as he was looking forward to the trial itself – despite Narcissa and Draco’s best efforts, Harry was unsuccessful in making the landing from floo transport as seamless and graceful as the Malfoys made it appear. On one memorable occasion, while practicing flooing from the Manor to the Malfoy summer chateau in France, he had stumbled out of the fireplace and fallen flat on his face. Narcissa had had to use
“He is not!” Pansy protested with horror on her face. “He’s amazing! And brave, and clever, and…” She trailed off dreamily.
Lockhart paused. “An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Let’s have a volunteer pair. Potter, Malfoy, how about you?”
Harry opened his eyes tentatively, breath coming in quick pants. There was a breeze on his face and a lamp above his head – he was outside. When did he get onto the street?
“No, no, it’s okay!” Neville said quickly, snapping his eyes open. “Just, keep still, you’ll fall right through. It’s like, uh, playing dead, you know?”
Harry has been through a lot, in canon and in the additions of this story, so he's really not in a great place right now. But his friends are helping him!
“You’ll be coming with us today,” Uncle Vernon growled, in such a way that Harry thought for a moment he was in physical pain. “So no
Harry asked himself, and all of a sudden was hit with an onslaught of memories in which he had done unexplainable things. One memory in particular stood out: during a game of Harry Hunting, Harry had disappeared from the ground and reappeared on the roof of his school. At the time, Harry had supposed he must have blacked out, as that was what the school nurse told him after the incident, but now he wasn’t so sure.
Macmillan snorted. “That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn’t want another Dark Lord competing with him.”
Harry woke in a white room. It was the sterile scent piercing his nose rather than anything he saw that let him recognise Hogwarts’ Hospital Wing. There was a large selection of chocolates and sweets by his bedside and, most strangely, the smiling form of Albus Dumbledore.
Harry’s frown deepened. Hagrid seemed likeable enough, but his size still made Harry uncomfortable, reminding him far too much of his whale of an uncle.
Filch escorted them down to Hagrid’s hut, telling them delightedly about what it was like back in his day, when students were hung from the ceiling by their thumbs, and were penalised with all sorts of other terrifying punishments.
“Oh, Merlin, oh no oh no oh no.” Draco was beginning to hyperventilate, struggling against the plant as it tightened and tightened.
The sound of the room’s concrete door sliding open drew everyone’s attention, and silence had fallen over the entire Common Room before Severus Snape had even walked in the door. He fixed his students with a hard stare, focussing particularly on the first years, who quivered under his gaze. That is, except for Draco Malfoy, Professor Snape’s godson; and Hadrian Potter, who had lived through scarier things than a man’s glare.
They chatted all the way back into the castle, forgetting, perhaps, that it was far after curfew. That is, until a loud meow disrupted their conversation.
Harry pushed himself onto the opposite desk as elegantly as he could (considering his below-average height), and waited. He was not kept waiting long.
“Just the man we need,” drawled Professor Snape. “A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.”
be guarded by a Cerberus. There have to be other defences – tricks and enchantments. Which means there is a small group of people, most likely teachers here at Hogwarts, who know exactly how to get to the Stone. The Dark Lord wouldn’t leave anything to chance, either – he’d want to know what he’s up against in getting the Stone. Which means he has a teacher on his side.”
“Of course I believe you, Draco, come here.” Harry pulled him into a hug, clutching tight as Draco took deep, jolting breaths against his shoulder.
Tracey blinked at him, her step faltering a moment. “You don’t- Oh.” She flushed. “Sorry. The Peverells are – or, were – a great wizarding family, and the three earliest known wizards are believed to be those in
“Someone broke into Gringotts,” Harry told them, running over the image in his mind. “But didn’t steal anything – because the vault that they had been trying to rob was emptied that very same morning.”
.” Draco put his hand over Harry’s mouth, flushed red, and took it away again. “Just, shut up and listen to me Hadrian James Potter. From now on, because I know it’s too difficult for you to simply avoid danger like the everybody bloody else, before you go off to get yourself killed you are going to come to me, and to Blaise, and to – to bloody Granger if you must, and if we say it’s too dangerous then for Merlin’s sake, you are going to
The diversion worked; Draco gave a loud scoff and instantly began to defend himself. “Of course I’m not scared,
Hagrid did, in fact, have an owl, a grouchy looking thing with a fiercely sharp beak and beady eyes, tucked into a ceiling beam. Harry wondered if it was another one of his “pets”. Draco scrawled a note and dropped it at the owl’s feet so as to avoid the talons. The creature shook itself, looking murderous, and grabbed the letter as soon as Draco opened the door for it.
Harry tuned the two girls out. He was starting to think Myrtle’s wailing might be the more attractive option, and that plus his curiosity encouraged him to push open the door and step inside the flooded bathroom.
“If we get killed, my ghost is going to kill your ghost all over again,” said Draco, and followed Harry into the dark.
Down below, Miles Bletchley (the current Keeper) called the game with a whistle and a strong throw of the Quaffle, and Harry’s thoughts retreated in the way of rapid fire instinct.
I don't like this chapter - but after rewriting it three times, I think this is the most satisfied I'm going to get. I hope you all like it more than I do.
“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he? Awfully brave chap.” He offered his hand. “Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.”
Harry wasn’t listening. Instead, he beamed at Draco, but the blond boy still looked sombre. Harry’s smile softened into something gentler. Draco, finally, smiled back.
doing, I think is a better question,” said Draco, grimacing at a pile of hair products beginning to spill sticky liquid onto the floor. “And what happened to your office?”
Harry dropped to his knees, scrambling through the books and scraps of paper, but it was too late. Tom Riddle’s diary was gone.
Harry stepped forward, past Neville’s frozen, choking form, and reached out a hand. Hermione was cold. Theo was colder. They lay on beds side by side, still and pale. Lifeless.
Narcissa didn’t seem convinced, but she nodded nonetheless. “Very well. If that is all, Miss Farley, Hadrian, Draco, and I will be returning to the Manor.”
Harry was stuck somewhere between passing out from shock and bursting from the flood of warm happiness in his chest. He had friends that cared about him. He’d never had that before – but now here they were. He knew he wouldn’t trade them for the world.
Millicent glared at her for that comment, although her grip on Sabre tightened at the thought of spiders until he scrambled out of her arms with a grumpy ‘meow’, trotting off to sit closer to the dwindling fire.
. There was little doubt in his mind that the rumours surrounding Adrienna Zabini were true; her long list of mysteriously deceased husbands had given her the nickname the Black Widow, and Harry thought it suited her perfectly.
Harry dropped his quill in frustration. He was so close! He almost missed the new words oozing from the page.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Have you lot been following us?” He asked sharply, cutting of Harry’s half-formed question.
The quote from Dumbledore is taken straight from the first movie. Oh, and I know canonically the encounter with Fluffy happens a bit later on, but honestly - fuck it.
They ran a fair way, up and down several staircases in attempts to evade Filch, his cat, and any prefects on patrol.
Harry gave him a questioning look, but Blaise just shook his head. Daphne returned moments later while her sister climbed the stairs to her dormitory. Astoria, Harry noted, looked markedly unrepentant.
“No need to apologise, Miss Farley,” Dumbledore held up a hand. “This mirror has ensnared many a witch and wizard, and you were simply looking out for your House member.”
“Fine,” Harry said. It wasn’t quite a lie – he was aching all over and incredibly tired, but he could move, and his mind felt remarkably sharp for having been asleep for a presumably long time. “How long have I been out, sir, if you don’t mind me asking?”
I'm sorry about the lack of updates guys! My formal external exams have just started, and I'm a bit of a mess of stress :( Unfortunately, these slow updates will be continuing (or perhaps even zero updates) for the next two and a half weeks or so as my exams continue. However! My last exam is on the afternoon of November 18th, so after that we should be back to regular upload time! I hope you can forgive me for now :( Thank you all for sticking with me! <3
Quirrell smirked. “Of course. Next to someone like, say, Severus Snape, who would suspect ‘p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell’?”
And then there was Draco. Draco hadn’t let go of Harry’s hand since they left the bathroom, and from the way he was clinging to Harry’s side it seemed he had no intentions of letting go any time soon. Harry got the feeling he would remain that way for the next few days – and, surprising himself, found that he didn’t quite mind that thought.
Harry glanced nervously over one shoulder. “Guys, we can explain everything to each other later, right now we need to
The basilisk had slowed down to follow but it reached the alcove soon enough. Its massive head peered mere feet from Harry’s face, the mess the twins had made of its eyes dripping onto the floor. The scales gleamed under the dim light. Harry held his breath and prayed to every muggle god he’d ever heard of. The snake inhaled once, nostrils the size of Harry’s head flaring. Slowly, it moved closer, closer, closer – and exhaled. The beast retreated with a high pitched slither of scales on stone.
“At least I have you with me this time,” Harry smiled at him. Draco went an odd shade of pink in the lantern light.
Harry knew this. Of course he did. But he couldn’t bear the thought of Narcissa and Draco at the Dursleys’. Who knew what Uncle Vernon would say to them? Or Dudley? He didn’t think Aunt Petunia would say anything, but that was the thing with Aunt Petunia – she always turned a blind eye.
Okay, so I'm going to be writing a side story as I go along with the main stories, which will be essentially giving a little look into the side characters we don't see in the canon books - Millicent, Theodore, etc. I'm thinking it will be a chapter for each character, and in the chapter we'll see a bit of their home life, their way of thinking - just a snippet of their life, really, and who they are as a person, because it's harder to really elaborate in the main story without incorporating so much that it starts getting off topic and unnecessary. So! Look forward to that some time soon - I hope you'll be as excited about it as I am :) See you in book two!
They were heading towards the bored looking cashier (who had little to do while everyone else was fawning over the celebrity) when it all had to go wrong. Because this was Harry’s life, and since when had it been an easy ride?
The rest of the Slytherins exchanged similar goodbyes, and Neville and Hermione even gathered their courage to walk over and face the several glares they were greeted with so they too could say goodbye to Harry.
Harry didn’t know how he’d managed to get roped into spending the night with Gilderoy Lockhart of all people, and yet there he was. He had a sneaking suspicion it was Blaise and Daphne’s idea of a joke – a joke he did
Finally, they reached the entrance to the dungeons where they would have to split – Hermione to Ravenclaw Tower, and Harry down beneath the Black Lake.
Harry let out a breathy, hysterical laugh. He could talk to him. He could find out about the Chamber!
Pansy, of course, was the one who jumped to the rescue. “Oh come on guys, it’s an adventure! Kill the monster, save the damsel in distress, yada yada – ever heard of it?”
He was so caught up thinking about all the ways he’d rather die than by basilisk that he didn’t notice that the twins had stopped until they caught him by each shoulder, seconds before he knocked his face into-
They parted ways, Professor Dumbledore following the path of the stretcher while Tom strode off towards the dungeons. Harry trailed behind the other student, pushed along by whatever force had allowed him into the diary – into this memory.
, Harry’s frantic brain provided suddenly, but it was drowned out by an awful cry coming from above. Harry risked a look upwards and saw bloody tears streaming down the basilisk’s face as it shrieked in pain.
There was a spark of fear in Weasley’s eyes. Harry let the triumph that spark made him feel curl his lips into a cold smile.
Harry immediately went to say yes – after all, he had never forgotten a thing in his life – but found his usually perfect recollection oddly fuzzy.
But that’s not where it ended. Behind them were his friends, everyone from his life that he considered even remotely close to him. They crowded together, so many that it seemed there was no way they could all fit in the reflection, but still they did. Amongst the familiar faces were people with blurred masks covering their features. Harry wondered who they were supposed to be, but only absently. He was too busy staring at his mother’s gently smiling face.
Harry shook his head. “Hermione’s in trouble. Listen, just get Snape and send him to the girls’ bathroom in the dungeons, okay?”
Harry resisted the urge to smile. Perhaps it made him a bad person, but he had spent so long feeling terrified of Aunt Petunia, of Uncle Vernon and Dudley and that awful, awful house. He was still afraid – but it was satisfying, to some dark part of himself, to see them afraid, too.
“I’m here to return something of yours,” Harry said, choosing to bypass any pleasantries and simply retrieving the clear ball from his pocket. He didn’t want to stay here longer than he had to – he was missing breakfast, after all, and he still had a long explanation to give Hermione about a certain Cerberus.
I know it's really short, I'm sorry :( I've been having a little trouble creatively speaking, and I just wanted to get SOMETHING up, y'know? So, just a filler chapter really, I'm sorry, but I hope it's better than nothing! Also, side note: I am fully in love with Astoria as a character (at least the way she is in my head for this universe, lol) so expect a fair involvement of her in upcoming chapters/stories. Ok! Hopefully you enjoy this (incredibly short) chapter! <3
, and decided to ignore it. He moved his Potions work onto the side table and stood up to face his fellow Slytherins.
“Hi, Longbottom,” Harry gave a slight smile, and took in a deep breath. “I just wanted to say thank you, for helping with Hermione and the troll, and- I think I was wrong about you. I haven’t been exactly kind, and honestly I didn’t think very much of you, but you weren’t just brave last night, you were loyal. And that’s something impressive, to me.”
witnessed the violent murder of his parents at the tender age of one, and that sort of thing does not often give a child an inclination to laughter – but it was unsettling nonetheless.
“I knew yer parents, ‘adrian!” Hagrid was saying. Harry shook off his memories. This wasn’t the time, after all. “Great people, Lily and James Potter. Great people.” Hagrid pulled a grimy pink handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his eyes with it roughly. “Yers too, Neville. Lost a lo’ of great people back then. Bu’ anyway! Wha’ can I do for you three?”
“Hadrian Potter,” the centaur greeted him, tilting his head in acknowledgement. “You must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time – especially for you.”
“Miss Farley, Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini,” Snape paused, a slight sneer taking over his features. “Mr Potter. I believe I explained the consequence for any Gryffindor foolishness.”
“Shouldn’t Harry be here for this?” Hermione asked. “It seems unfair to be making plans like this behind his back.”
He turned, and there was Draco, holding the door open and gesturing wildly. Harry made one last loop before pushing all of his speed towards the open door. Draco slammed it shut behind him, and the sound of hundreds of keys slamming into tough wood echoed in the air.
Gemma lowered her head respectfully once more. “Hadrian’s a good kid, Lady Malfoy. Call it fraternity between housemates.”
“Bough’ ‘im last year, off an Irish feller down the pub. Then I lent ‘im t’ Dumbledore t’ guard the-” Hagrid stopped himself. “I shouldn’ta told ye tha’. I should no’ ‘ave told ye tha’.”
“I knew you’d be in Slytherin,” Daphne stated, flicking her hair just a touch too forcefully to seem casual. “Just like me. It’s the best house, after all.”
“I doubt it,” Harry replied, deadpan. “I couldn’t bear to take that title from whatever poor Gryffindor holds it.”
Harry wasn’t certain what he had done to give her any idea otherwise, but perhaps it was just a girl thing.
“If you are all ready,” Professor McGonagall said, sneaking up on them and causing several of the children to jump.
It didn’t take Harry long to draw the connection between the instances and his emotions – he had been scared during the Harry Hunting before he disappeared, and he had been angry at the zoo before the glass vanished.
Harry breathed deep. He cleared the clatter of ‘what-ifs’ from his mind to the best of his ability and locked eyes with the small metal snake. He focussed on it, on every groove of its scales and the tiny jewel of its eye, until it almost seemed to be moving, slithering over the tap metal towards him.
Draco bit his lip for a moment, before apparently making up his mind on something and sitting up straighter on his seat. “Do you want to be friends?”
Harry bit his cheek again to refrain from pestering the professor about what exactly he had missed, but Dumbledore must have read it on his face anyway, and chuckled.
voice was surprising enough to call Harry’s attention. Headmaster Dumbledore seemed to materialise out of nowhere into the room, his eyes twinkling.
Disappointingly, it was not Harry’s friends allowed in first, but the Headmaster. Harry rather gloomily wondered if he would ever be allowed to see them, or if he should have to suffer a death-by-lecture after going to all the trouble of surviving a damned basilisk bite.
I know it's been a little longer than usual since my last update, so here is a little longer than usual chapter for you. I know the story is moving a little slowly at the moment, but it's starting to pick up. We'll be skipping forward through the year a bit more now that the first two weeks are out of the way. Hope you enjoy nonetheless!
The carriages were a new experience, however. First years were taken across the Black Lake via magical rowboats, but second years and above were taken around in carriages drawn by sets of peculiar creatures. Harry started when he saw them, and for once did not berate himself for it. The beasts were hideous, horse-like in form but with all the flesh seemingly stripped from blackened bones. He noted Blaise and Theo staring too, but Daphne cut him off before he could ask what they were. She was furious the whole ride there – Astoria, as a first year, was unable to accompany them beyond the train, and so was forced to be separated from her elder sister until they reached Hogwarts. Harry couldn’t really empathise with Daphne’s anger, but he thought maybe he could understand a little. If he had a younger sibling as small and quiet as Astoria, he doubted he’d want to leave them on their own either.
“If you ever dare to speak about my parents again,” he said, calmly, quietly. “I will make sure that it is the last thing you ever say.”
Harry stood up from the table as calmly as he could. They wouldn’t let the Slytherins walk into danger, right? The troll had to be on the other side of the dungeons. The troll. That was in the school. That Harry was about to walk towards.
“Well,” Hermione huffed. “At least that’s one problem dealt with. Now we just need to find out about-”
Tom’s lips thinned. “Voldemort is my past, my present, and my future.” With a flick of his wrist, a wand – Ginny’s, surely, since it looked more solid than the rest of him – was revealed from the mirage’s robes. In fiery red lettering upon the air, Tom wrote:
“What about the Mirror, sir?” Harry asked eventually, after a long moment of silence. “Why did it let me have the Stone and not Quirrell?”
That seemed to do the trick. When Harry met the Headmaster’s eyes again, Dumbledore was smiling warmly at him, and the twinkle was back in full force.
Madam Pomfrey could not have looked any more aghast than watching no less than seven young students tramp into her Hospital Wing at lunch the next day.
Harry shook his head. “But then, if Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets, you must not be the monster.”
Marcus Flint sneered at the Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood as they faced off. Their compulsory handshake seemed to be more of a show of strength between the two captains, and Harry noted Wood’s wince.
Madam Pomfrey was not at all pleased when she returned from her office to see so many people crowded around Harry’s bed – though the thought of there being so many people who cared about Harry as to constitute a ‘crowd’ still made him giddy. She promptly and without sympathy escorted all but Draco, Blaise, and curiously enough Ronald Weasley from the Hospital Wing, leaving Ronald only because she assumed that he was there for one of his siblings.
Regardless of the why, time passed quickly for Harry those few weeks, and before he knew it he was waking up on October 31
Harry wanted to ask what exactly it was Blaise had to tend to so vaguely, but Draco turned to look at him and the wide eyed stare he received made it all to easy to let Blaise go without comment.
He didn’t have time to think any longer as he squinted into the dark because Draco was tugging him down, ducking his head with a hand on his neck and pulling both them and Fang to the ground as the unmistakeable sound of hooves on forest floor surrounded them, deafening, even frightening if it wasn’t accompanied by the sickening squish of spiders being crushed and the screech of those who weren’t scurrying away through the underbrush. The bombardment seemed to go on forever, endless stamping and rushes of air past his face as Harry squeezed his eyes shut against the frighteningly close sensations and booming sounds. Fang’s slobber wet his clothes and the ground stunk of moss, but Draco’s hand was warm on his neck and it was that that kept him breathing. When the movement did finally end, the sudden silence was more piercing than the noise, and it took a long time until Harry could gather the strength to lift his head and view their saviour.
“Lucky idiots,” she muttered, while dragging him into her own warm hug. Harry let his eyes drift close. He thought he quite liked hugs, now that he’d experienced them.
“I’m not a runaway,” Harry said absently, retrieving the letters from an impatient Hedwig and sorting through them. Every one of his friends had replied, much to his pleasure.
Dumbledore’s mask wasn’t quite so strong as the Lady Malfoy’s, apparently. The twinkle dropped from his eyes. “I’m afraid I must insist, Narcissa. We may ask Cornelius, if you’d like to be certain, but I rather think he’s had quite enough dealing with Lucius’ unfortunate arrest, don’t you?”
made friends with him on the train,” Draco told their audience proudly. “We’re the best of friends.”
(Perhaps, it was just a little bit to hear the indignant sound Ron Weasley made behind him – but only a little bit.)
“Yes, I’m afraid so. But then, she’s been in so much pain, poor Ginny,” Tom cocked his head to one side, perfect features mimicking sympathy while his eyes remained dead. “She’s been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes. Ginny poured her soul out to me. I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets of my own, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her.” The sympathy dropped away like a discarded cloak. A cruel grin remained. “Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.”
The future headmaster peered down at Tom through his glasses. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would have said Dumbledore looked suspicious of Tom Riddle – but what reason did he have to be that suspicious of a student?
“I’m not sure how long that will last,” Blaise interrupted. “Considering we haven’t reached the Stone just yet.”
Harry didn’t like crowds. He didn’t like the loudness, or the heat, or the claustrophobic atmosphere. Flourish and Blotts was all of that, and Harry hated it.
Even if Harry hadn’t taken to watching the door as the minutes ticked away, it would be impossible not to notice when the man of the hour arrived. The heavy wooden doors of the courtroom opened with a thud, and Lucius Malfoy stalked forth with curses in his eyes. He was escorted by a sombre looking auror on either side, and a soft golden light encircled his wrists. The light was no metal chain, but Harry thought it looked just as confining.
Harry turned around to see the bushy haired girl from the train standing behind him, looking curious.
Draco huffed and drew the cloak off, quickly stepping away from Harry. “It’s us. Can you stop pointing that?”
, and for the second time in two years had to sit by his damned bedside and do nothing but just hope to bloody Morgana that he’d be alright while I am completely useless, so
Harry took a deep breath, and turned around. He was met with grey legs the width of tree trunks, and tilting his head back as far as it could go gave him a clear view of flared nostrils the size of Harry’s head and above them, a pair of dull, yellow eyes.
Blaise was calm as he always was, and his slow, methodical way of speaking drew Harry to obey. When he saw he had Harry’s attention, Blaise continued.
“Everyone remain calm. Prefects, take your Houses back to your Common Rooms immediately,” he ordered.
Fred – Harry was fairly certain this one had called the other George, so he decided to just roll with it – shook his head.
That was a little bit of a lie – Harry silently believed that Narcissa Malfoy would burn the world down for her son, and it was that fierce, unquestionable love that above anything else, even her saving Harry from the Dursleys, made her the most trusted adult in his life.
Harry nodded. “I promise. But I need to explain that to my friends so they don’t worry about me, so I need the letters, and I need Hedwig’s cage unlocked.”
Quirrell turned and started forward, hands outstretched. Harry shoved the Mirror, knocking it into the parasite. It teetered dangerously, nearly falling, but Harry wasn’t watching because it hadn’t slowed Quirrell for long, in fact, in just seconds Quirrell’s hands were up to him, were on his throat, and he was falling to the ground and he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t
, that Tracey had used when searching for a link between Harry’s family line and the line of Slytherin; and two hefty tomes entitled
“Plus,” said Pansy Parkinson, far quieter than she had ever been while in the – relative – safety of Hogwarts’ walls, “Adventures and battles and the like don’t seem quite so fun, these days.”
Harry zoned out from their conversation as he took his seat next to Draco. He was more interested in subtly watching Draco’s face in between keeping an eye on the many high society witches and wizards surrounding him. Draco’s expression remained clear and motionless, replying politely to his mother or Lady Zabini when spoken to but otherwise silent. His grey eyes, however, were flecked with well-hidden fear. Harry glanced down at the distance between their palms and wished, desperately, to reach out and take Draco’s hand within his own – to offer some comfort, any comfort, anything at all. He clenched his fingers to avoid the impulse, and looked away.
“I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me,” Aragog said. The creaking of the forest got louder, only it sounded more like scratching now, on all sides, above Harry and Draco’s heads. “The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.”
With that, the two boys drifted off to sleep, minds blissfully free from worry of what the future could bring.
So could Narcissa, it seemed. She conceded defeat with a slight incline of her head, yet when she looked at Harry there was a vicious promise in her eyes. She dropped gracefully to her knees in front of Harry, just as she had that morning.
Petunia glanced at him again. A strangled noise escaped her throat once she seemed to realise that Harry had no intention of making a retreat just yet. With careful fingertips, she opened the letter.
“Of course, my boy. I was simply concerned you would be upset about the ordeal, or guilty about the creature’s demise, but it’s understandable that Ginny was your first priority.”
“Draco came to find us when he couldn’t find Professor Snape,” Gemma told her. “He said Longbottom had collected Harry from the Great Hall, something to do with you being in danger with the- well, with the troll.”
broken curfew, after all, and he had better things to worry about – namely, their upcoming detention. Professor McGonagall had not told them with whom their detention would be served, and Harry could already feel the imposing presence of Snape at his back while he scrubbed at a line of disgusting cauldrons.
– was a familiar black diary, and above it a form was shimmering into view. When it finally became distinctive, he wasn’t entirely surprised by the face staring dispassionately down at the three Weasleys.
“Draco?” he whispered, though he doubted the other boy was still awake. He was proven wrong a mere moment later.
The rattling of a windowpane in the wind startled Harry out of his thoughts, and he glanced up with a jump. Up ahead, a lone torch was flickering. Where was he? He must have wandered pretty far to not recognise the area. Harry approached the window, feeling abruptly nervous.
’ thought Harry, slightly in shock at himself for forgetting that the twins had dismantled the privacy charm on their curtains, and therefore could hear everything the boys had been saying.
-Harry holding Draco's hand as they walk to Herbology. Harry doesn't say anything when his boyfriend sneers at anyone that seems to be staring at them.
It wasn't until the next morning, when everyone was at breakfast, that he went to see if Harry was in his bedroom. He knocked firmly on the door.
Smiling as he washed his hair, he imagined what Tau was like to look at. Rinsing his black locks, he wondered what Tau’s hair felt like. What would it feel like to be touched by the man, and were his hands soft like he’d imagined? And Kissing?
"Come on!" Harry laughed. "I'll show you. Just transfigure your robe into a coat, your trousers and shirt are fine in the muggle world."
It was a short reply, but Harry wondered if was too obvious. No! He decided, Tau had admitted his weakness for chocolate many times, so that was something he would normally reply… right?
Draco: "You feel like briefing me on the cause of your spectacular eruption, so I know what to expect should it happen agian. I like to be prepared."
"Thank Salazar,"Draco sighed, looking up at the blue top section with red letters forming the word 'Argos'.
-Friday 12th march: 3rd floor corridor. Making out when stops and smirks dangerously. He turns Draco around forcefully - back facing him and hidden only by a large statue. Harry cups him through his trousers - pressing him hard against the wall.
Harry eventually slumped into one of the armchairs. "You'd do that for me? You'd go into Diagon Alley and buy a
Madam Pomfrey excused herself, quite happy to leave Harry dealing with the unstable Malfoy. Harry nodded, and returned his attention to the man. Draco responded better in Harry presence, and Harry didn’t quite know how he felt about that. Radiant, that Draco trusted and preferred his company? Bittersweet, that Draco only clang to him because he wasn’t mentally unstable? Perhaps he should feel more aggrieved that Draco only wanted him when he was ill.
"Bloody hell Potter, how do you keep up?" Draco shook his head, sipped at his coffee and handed the list back to Harry. "Never mind. What do you wish me to pick up for Kaison tomorrow?"
Harry: "That's not what-. *Sighs.* Are you really going to deny that whatever this curse is, what it's making us do, isn't ... without truth."
When the Vault was opened, Draco was in total shock. The Vault was bigger than the Malfoy's was. Harry went inside and filled his magical money pouch with Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts, while Draco glanced around. There was the money of course, pilled high one side. As he looked at the shiny mound enviously, a few coins fell out of nowhere adding to the pile. There was also hundreds of items: Photo's and Portraits, jewelry, clothes, boxes of unknown items, and  books    to name a few things.
“It’s not typical for adult wizards to have bursts of accidental magic. Must have been some anger!” Said Draco.
Neither of them knew that sleep wouldn't happen agian for while - if at all, so they went to sit on the new couch, with one of the new throws over them. The throw was magically enchanted to warm up when necessary, so they were snug into each other, Draco's head on Harry's shoulder, as Harry played with his hair.
Harry froze when he walked into the Great Hall, it was deadly silent and everyone was crowded around something in the middle. Any thoughts he’d previously been having, rapidly vanished from his mind to be replaced by an ominous feeling.
