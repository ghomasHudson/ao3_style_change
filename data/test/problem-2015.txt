The other boy only nodded and followed him outside the Hall. He looked upset which didn’t do anything to calm Draco’s nerves.
“N-no, it’s not!”
“5 points from Slytherin, each!” Draco could only yell after them.
“Right, wouldn’t do good to endanger your beauty sleep…” Harry nodded slightly pouting.
“What with the new look, Wolfe?!” Pansy exclaimed. “Is there a message you want to send?”
Wait… What did he mean
Harry smiled tiredly.
Harry looked away. “I have my ways… as for why he’s down there… I don’t know but Snape is with him and Teddy likes the man, so I guess he’s okay…”
“Already thinking long term, Potter?” Draco smirked.
He immediately received a deadly glare from his guardian but was saved by his other foster parent.
And with that simple question, he knew the girl would speak for at least fifteen minutes without interruption, so he just had to follow her into an empty compartment. He tried not to think about Harry or the way he seemed to be burning holes in the back of his head. He wanted to be discrete after all and Pansy was Hogwarts’ queen of gossips.
“Why? Tired already, Potter?” Draco smirked.
“And he’s not in a good place right now. I can’t force that onto him…” Harry said, shaking his head again.
“Aunt Marge – my Uncle’s sister – loves dogs but her dogs rarely love me… I was eight and stayed on that tree for hours waiting for her to call the mutt back inside.”
Draco decided to ignore him.
“Call me if you need anything or if something happens, okay? I won’t be sleeping…”
“I’ve told you, not until I talk to Teddy…” Harry sighed.
He looked up and Draco noticed that he had stopped crying even if his face was still puffy. They kissed but it wasn’t as eager or needy as two weeks before. It was just soft and reassuring.
“You couldn’t afford to lose him either…” Draco corrected but Harry didn’t even acknowledge it. “What about a mind-healer? I know Black is seeing one.”
“Promise. See you later.”
“I don’t know… It’s not something I see myself doing in any near future. I’m very content with my current relationship after all…”
“I kissed you? In my memories, it was the other way around…”
With the two of them, they managed to convince Teddy to get up and to walk along. But as soon as they entered the Castle, the Hufflepuff stopped.
Harry looked at him and seemed sad for some reason. Had he found someone else during those two weeks? Did he want to break up? Did they grow apart so easily??? Was it Weasley?!
“She’s right,” Blaise sneered. “When I agreed to help you make your
Harry just shook his head. His arms were around Teddy who seemed unresponsive. He was muttering some nonsense.
Potter pinched his lips, but he still hadn’t tried to move away.
So... I guess I must tell you that I haven't actually worked on this fic in months... Chapter 12 to 14 are already written but I kind of lost my motivation after that... Maybe it will be back at some point, who knows?
“What?! No!” Harry exclaimed.
Draco turned his head to face him and smirked. “Yes, you are… but I don’t mind…”
And he had hung off before Draco had time to analyse that sentence.
“Not necessarily…” Harry mumbled. “I mean, everyone is different.”
“It’s okay, she’ll accept it… eventually…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good! I wasn’t sure you would answer!” the Gryffindor smiled shyly.
“No nasty business…” he sighed still half-asleep. “There’s a child in the bed.”
And the menace disappeared as quickly as it came since Pansy suddenly needed to go to the bathroom to find a mirror.
“What? You have to put the right words on the things you want to talk about. There’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Harry explained with a similar smirk on his face.
Draco couldn’t have been as impressive as the deadly glare Harry sent his friend even if he tried.
Harry grimaced slightly and for a second, Draco feared that Teddy was lost alone somewhere in the Castle – although Harry seemed to always know where everyone was at all time. But then, a heavy mass with rainbow hair crashed on Harry’s shoulder.
Granger seemed focused on Teddy’s new pierced ears and, clearly, Draco didn’t want to take part in that debate. He shivered when Harry’s finger brushed against his hand. Draco raised an eyebrow but couldn’t stop looking at his best friend. This was so… flamboyant!
See you~
“No.” Harry over-articulated the simple word and Draco sighed. “They said they won’t stand it quietly anymore, you know… They won’t do anything drastic, of course, but Remus said it’s important that Teddy realises that he isn’t alone… Sirius’s therapist thinks the same apparently. She said that Diggory’s death might have triggered something in him… you know how he never talked about his godfather’s death, right?”
Sorry for neglecting this fic... to be honest, I stuck with chapter 15 so I hesitated whereas I should wait to manage to write more before releasing this chapter or not...
“Mistress is asking if Master Harry Potter will stay for dinner,” Dobby announced loudly making Harry jolted out of Draco’s arms.
Harry looked at him dubiously. Draco wasn’t worried. His mother probably wouldn’t care much about the Malfoy line’s disappearance anyway.
“But you stayed in the same room for almost 10 days at Christmas! And I know you put the Muffliato Charm on, Sirius’s bragged about it for weeks!”
“Yeah… right. Anyway… Did you talk to Teddy? Can you maybe help him with his stuff or something?”
“Teddy, we…” Draco started then turned to Harry. “Do you think we could take him to one of our Common Room?”
“Please, Draco…” Harry begged. “I… I’m so scared he might get himself sick at this rate. He’s having nightmares you know… Remus said that he hears him crying at night… but he just closes off when we try to talk to him about it… I don’t know what to do…”
“What do you suggest?”
Diggory was dead!
Draco smiled tenderly as he read the letter again. The boy clearly was excited.
“Depends on the curse used, I guess…” Draco mused after some time.
Harry stepped back.
“I… I talked to Blaise and… Davis…” Draco explained in a low voice. “She’s trying to make him jealous because he refused to sleep with her…”
“Not good?” Harry answered looking up again. “He’s barely spoken more than two words to me since we came back… He doesn’t eat with us anymore. Kreacher is making him sandwiches and he just eats them in the library or his room while working…”
“Too bad I heard a confession just now…”
“What?!!”
“Thanks! ‘night! Wait for Hedwig tomorrow!”
“Like… Quidditch, friends… Teddy… liking to look at each other ass…” Potter blushed at that. “Liking to look at each other’s body while undressing…” Draco took one step ahead. “Liking to look at each other’s lips while speaking…”
Potter shook his head. “I don’t know how… just that… Teddy said it’s an accident… and that… he feels responsible,” he sighed. He was clearly trying his best to stay calm. “Sirius… Sirius said that Teddy was the Black Heir and that… that he could adopt him or something like that if Teddy had nowhere to go…”
“Really…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is Pansy being difficult again?” Harry asked worriedly.
He parted his legs a bit more. Draco would have complimented his flexibility if wasn’t suddenly overly conscious of the proximity of their lower parts. Harry secured his head on his arms and kissed him deeper than he ever did. Draco’s hands went to the Gryffindor’s back. Harry shivered when they met his bare skin under his Quidditch uniform. He traced that scar he could feel but had only glimpsed a few times while Harry had been changing the year before. He had never asked him about it… maybe he should… but it wasn’t his business, was it?
“Now, care to explain why there’s another you in the bed?” Draco asked.
Anyways, reviews are greatly appreciated! Thank you all for leaving kudos !!
Something very cold settled in Draco’s gut.
Harry woke up early. Really early. He loved to look at Draco who needed his 8-hour-long beauty sleep. On the other hand, Draco slept late, and Harry tended to fall asleep comfortably settled against his chest while Draco was reading his book on muggle or wizarding medicine.
“Well, it’s not funny! And you’re not nice either! I’m telling it right now if you’re using our relationship to tease Teddy constantly I will…”
Draco was so shocked he couldn’t even react until a flash of a camera merely blinded him.
“Ok… Harry?” Draco called worriedly.
“Like, right now?”
“Well, it’s not as if you ever win anyway…” Harry smirked.
But Teddy didn’t know… Well, probably. Draco never clearly stated it, but Teddy was a seer, certainly, he would have
Harry’s present for him was a silver bracelet carved with the Potter family crest.
“Just… I thought about it… during the summer, I mean…”
The talk with his mother went without any incident. She wasn’t even surprised when he told her he was
“Why?!! Why did you want me to go there?!!! Did you just want to prove that he does hate me now?!! Was that your idea of a joke?!!!!”
“Fine…” he sighed. “But only until the game!”
“You’re insufferable!” Harry pouted. “Anyway, Remus said that my dad had always been supportive of them and that, when they told him, he was just happy to know that they would just never do it on
“What?!!!” Pansy exclaimed.
Teddy and Draco stopped the discussion they were having about the effect of Salamander Blood in healing salves to look at Harry. The three boys had just spent the day together shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and then had retreated to Malfoy Manor because Lord Black was still working on Grimmauld Place’s wards or something. Teddy and Harry were supposed to go back home by dinner time though…
Harry and Draco had a silent exchange until Granger cast a privacy charm over Teddy who didn’t even seem to notice.
“You know what I mean!” Harry scoffed. “You might want to tell her though… before Sirius goes to her to brag or something…”
Draco had just come down to the pitch. The Gryffindor training session had ended a few minutes before.
“Hum… I’m not sure it’s for me anyway but thanks for the support ‘Mione… It goes directly to my heart…” Harry sighed.
“What the meaning of this?!!” he exploded just after entering Slytherin Common Room.
“Are you doing a strip-tease?” Draco tried to joke.
“Have sex!” Harry exclaimed.
“Did you?” Draco said teasingly.
“Yes! Yes, I have! He took me to St Mungo’s and all. I’ve had to take Skele-gro and nutritive potions for two months after that! And I also have him promised that he won’t kill the Dursleys because he had just been out of Azkaban and Teddy couldn’t afford to lose him…”
Just to make sure, Draco marched to his best friend, barely apologizing to the people who had to move to let him pass through.
There was something else in Draco’s mind too… Potter.
“You’re clearly way more advance in that subject that I would ever be…”
Draco smiled and then his mind went wondering who the other prefects would be. Teddy had told him, as one of his stupid predictions, that Weasley would be Gryffindor’s… which didn’t make any sense if anyone was asking. Of course, he came to tolerate the redhaired because he was friend with Teddy and Teddy didn’t always have time to see all his friends separately… but still… Weasley’s and Granger’s constant bickering was insufferable and Draco really didn’t want to spend every Prefect meeting listening to it for 3 years…
Harry nodded slowly again. Draco wondered if he wasn’t going to fall asleep at this rate.
“Yeah… Good night.”
“Did you wish that I was stuck here with you?” he teased Harry.
“Yes… It’s barely if he reckons the man is dead sometimes…” Draco sighed. “Do they think that he might have died in a similar fashion as Diggory?”
“Are you asking me out then?”
“Yes, I think you should… but no one can force you to do so…”
“With Sirius… They needed to go to the Ministry of Magic. His godfather died.”
In the end, people seemed to accept his ‘
Teddy’s head appeared at the door. “Hey guys, just to tell you that the prefect meeting is about to begin…” he informed them before leaving again.
Draco groaned even louder.
“You have a very bad influence on him, you know?” he said.
Black seemed really proud of his wards… unlike Lupin who was sending disapproving looks not only to the two teenagers but also to his partner.
“A bet. The winner can ask whatever he wants to the loser… The prize is due to the night after our match, in the Prefect Bathroom…”
Of course, Harry won because Harry always won!
“That was two days ago…” Draco growled.
Draco and Harry were sending a quizzingly look at their best friend while the door opened slowly, revealing Blaise with none other than Tracey Davis. All eyes turned to Teddy who refused to meet them back.
’, end-quote.”
Harry opened the small package at the other end of the Great Hall. He read the note attached to it. Granger asked him something and he shook his head slowly without looking up from the small piece of papers.
Draco nodded but grabbed Harry’s wrist before he could step away. “I’ll need another kiss now as I won’t be allowed to do it when I see you on Friday…”
“Yeah?”
“It’s Teddy…” Harry sighed next to him. “He said he was missing me…”
Teddy had asked him a few times if he was really ready during the past two weeks. Harry had told him about the bet, apparently, and Teddy wanted to make sure neither of his friends would force themselves to do something they weren’t ready for.
“I’m sorry…” Harry kept muttering against his ear. “I’m really sorry…”
“Like what?”
“Let’s go see Daphne! I want to see her face when she sees you!” she said grabbing Teddy’s arm and driving him away.
They were now one week away from the end of the school year. Potter and he had been surprised by the rain during one of their evening practices and ended up completely drenched in the Hufflepuff changing room. Draco had been very conscious of Potter’s eyes on his naked back when he had put his uniform over his head.
“Draco, is something going on between you and Potter?” Blaise asked as it was Theo’s turn to play in their Exploding Snap game.
Draco had had to work with that knowledge for the next few weeks of school. What was even worse was that he had received a letter from Sirius Lord Black himself, explaining that Teddy was under some sort of Fidelius Charm and that asking him too much about his godfather’s death could permanently turn him into a vegetable… Who would ever put a child under the Fidelius Charm?!!! How do they expect Draco to tame his killing morbid curiosity????
Harry shrugged. “How common death by acromantula bites at the end of a centuries-old tournament is?” he asked evenly.
Draco smirked at the way Teddy was messing with Harry. The Gryffindor’s reaction didn’t wait.
Blaise and Davis had just arrived too. At least, they had the decency to not pursuing their interrupting business on their way back.
“No, you don’t,” Harry answered softly before kissing him one last time. “He’s your best friend and you love him.”
“What? You’ve nothing to be ashamed of! You’re a good fuck! Not the best in school but probably the best in our year!” Blaise said as if he didn’t understand what was wrong in what he said.
At least, Teddy seemed happy too in the pictures. Still a bit tired and sun-deprived, of course, but better…
Harry did call him that night through the two-way mirror anyway.
Harry bent over and kissed him again.
The days after Harry’s confession were a bit fuzzy in Draco’s head.
“That way, I can be straight and still love your boyfriend!” Teddy said, even his voice had changed, and Draco, Harry and Ron grimaced.
Anyway, Harry had barged in too less than 30 minutes later and Dobby had embarrassed Draco in a way only his mother could have equalled…
Draco smirked and kneeled before him. Harry hadn’t noticed, of course. Draco let his hands gently stroke Harry’s tights. Harry opened his emerald eyes to his and accepted the unexpected kiss.
They were now only a few centimetres from each other. Draco was a bit taller than the Gryffindor and he was looking down at his emerald eyes which seemed hypnotized by the Slytherin’s lips.
“No! No. I told you can call me!” Draco said. “Is everything ok?”
And Harry smiled sheepishly forcing Draco to chastely kiss the corner of his lips one last time.
Please, tell me what you think!!!! Coms keep me motivating! ^^
“And… I don’t know… I got cold feet? I don’t… I don’t think I’m ready for that yet… I mean, I like her and all and I’m more comfortable around her than when I was with the others…”
Draco discovered that he and Harry didn’t have the same rhythm at all.
Draco leaned a little more and put his lips on his neck, sending shivers in Harry’s body. Draco let go of his wrist and wrapped his hands around the boy’s body without breaking the contact between his lips and Harry’s skin.
Harry looked at him thoughtfully and eventually nodded.
“What?! Sirius is here too???” Harry exclaimed.
“No!” Harry exclaimed. “I… I didn’t say that to get rid of you Ted’! I just…”
Black barked a laugh at that. “Rem’… I think they’re still drunk. We surely can’t let them go like that! Can’t I just give them some sober-up potion?”
He went to the nearest loo and splashed some water on his face. He looked at his reflection in the mirror. It was going to be okay. Teddy was still his best friend and he was going through something… That’s why he was so mean… nothing to do with finally realizing that Draco was a selfish prick and wanting to cut ties with him…
“Piss off, Draco!” came Blaise’s voice from the other side of the door.
Harry’s hand moved and started stroking slightly the back of his head, brushing the base of his neck under the collar of his shirt. And suddenly, that embrace was nothing like anything he might have shared with Teddy.
Teddy was back and sitting at the Hufflepuff table. Draco was only half listening while the headmaster was explaining that a special psychological support unit had been created in the Hospital Wing for students that might need it. He was watching at his friend from a distance. Clearly, Teddy wasn’t listening to any of what was going on. He had his nose on some old book, reading while everyone was mourning and keeping a minute of silence in the memory of Diggory. And that act of insensitiveness was so unlike him that Draco’s heart ached.
Draco nodded and was suddenly attacked by the tightest hug Teddy had given him in a long time.
His mother sighed dramatically and then opened her arm largely. “Come here. An old woman has the right to hug her son when she is so very proud of him…”
After long minutes of snogging, Harry pushed him gently again. They were both short of breath.
“Potter…” he sighed, making the boy jolted. “You’re staring…”
Teddy sat with Harry during the Final Task. Draco was sitting a few rows behind them and every time Harry would glance his way – because for as much he was avoiding him, he also tended to do that often – Draco glared back at Teddy’s head, hoping that the stupid Gryffindor would take the hint. And that he did! Or at least, Teddy did for him because clearly, he asked Harry something about Draco. It was kind of cute how obvious the Gryffindor was… he wouldn’t have last two minutes in the snakes' den…
“Any news from Teddy?” Draco asked, serious again.
On the 31st of July, Harry didn’t answer his first call but called back at around 1 a.m. The boy had seemed ecstatic as he told Draco about his day in Paris. The whole thing sounded very muggle, but Draco didn’t care because there was something on Harry’s smile which was just preventing him from teasing and instead forced him to smile back. The boy was also clearly tired.
“No.”
“Hey,” he said.
“I…” Potter started talking but abruptly, turning red again. “Fuck off, Malfoy.”
“I knew you weren’t kidding…”
Draco and Harry rolled their eyes while Theo just scoffed. Pansy seemed ecstatic.
“What for?”
“No… Well, at first, she asked if there was something wrong with her and when I said no, she said it’s okay but… well, it’s been awkward between us ever since…”
“How is he doing?” He asked in a detached voice, pretending to be unconcerned.
And with that, he was just… gone.
“I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good…” he muttered, and Draco raised an eyebrow. That was new… Harry then sighed profusely. “You can’t,” he said. “Snape is currently patrolling the dungeons… Doesn’t he have better things to do at 1 a.m.?!”
Draco shrugged. “Are we that obvious?”
He turned and climbed the few steps leading to his dorm room. He grabbed his two-way mirror and cast a privacy charm around his bed.
“Good.”
Davis sneered but still refused to face him.
He left. Harry could deal with his teammates on his own. He did go to his own changing room and pondered to really change or not… After all, he could use a good flight before snogging his boyfriend!
The kiss was… not like whatever Draco had ever experienced. He did try to kiss Pansy a few times and even Blaise once or twice… It had been casual, didn’t mean anything. But having P-Harry against his skin was just… another level? If that even made sense.
“Meet me in front of the portrait of the gigantic silver fruit bowl, on the left-hand side of the Marble Staircase in ten then…” Harry said before grabbing his bag and joining Weasley and Granger, certainly to tell them that he wouldn’t eat with them.
“He didn’t mean it,” the Gryffindor said.
As weeks passed by, Draco’s wariness about this newly found friendship lessened down and when he saw his friend crashing into tears next to his hospital bed because he had been so worried Draco could have died eaten by a giant three-head dog… Draco just quitted doubting him.
“It’s nothing… it’s just… stupid…” he sighed.
“Draco! Wait!” Harry yelled while grabbing his wrist and forcing him to turn back.
“So…” he started. “I know you have been wondering so I’ll tell you, but only today. And we won’t talk about that subject ever again, ok?”
“Sirius told us that it was your father’s dream too,” Teddy nodded. “Before the war and all…”
“Why?!”
He had to make some bullshit excuses about growing closer to Harry Gryffindor Potter during their common Quidditch practices the previous year and deciding to continue to train together on top of their respective House Team Training and that Gryffindors clearly couldn’t father the idea of there were decent people without second thoughts outside their House…
Draco cast a drying charm on himself before getting out. Harry was waiting on the other side of the door.
“I guess you were just better.”
“Could you come over?” Harry asked softly.
“Maybe it’s not that simple… He lived abroad before, didn’t he? And his godfather was an Unspeakable… Maybe his family doesn’t even know he’s dead or that Teddy’s alone… We still don’t know what happened. He didn’t talk about that, did he?” Harry shook his head. “So, you can’t draw conclusions based on your own childhood. You don’t know the situation.” Draco sighed. “Last summer, when he came to me after the howler, he talked to me about changing the future and stuff… I think his godfather’s death is linked to one of his visions and that the man died while trying to change what is bounded to happen… He had a meltdown when I asked him if I was right…”
It was unsettling… To realise that despite everything Teddy seemed to have told Draco about himself, he still had kept so much for himself.
Draco frowned at her words. It was a bit too patronizing for his taste. And Harry was, by far, the best seeker Hogwarts had seen in at least 10 years. Even with considering the fact that they didn’t know much about the level of international players right now, that was already putting him as one of the best seekers in the UK and Ireland. In his opinion, Harry even got a chance to get picked for the English National Team in a few years, Blythe Parkin wasn’t so young anymore… Of course, Draco couldn’t state publicly that he agreed with Weasley, but he would make sure to support Harry if he ever chose that path.
’ or ‘
Hello~~
Draco’s other hand was on Harry’s tight and he moaned softly into Draco’s mouth and Draco thought that there was no way they could stop there…
He sighed, putting Pansy’s hand out of his body, and looked up at Blaise. Even if they weren’t that close, they were still friends and Blaise wasn’t the kind to boast around.
Harry nodded slowly. “Yeah… he fell asleep around half an hour ago.”
And then they both started laughing. It was awfully wrong, but it also felt so good.
Teddy groaned and morphed into what looked like a 5-year-old a child with turquoise blue hair. He sat up and climbed above Harry’s body to squeeze himself back between Harry and Draco.
“He doesn’t have to say it! I know! He never touches me! As if I’m going to break! I’m not made of glass for God’s sake! We’re 16! Who cares if it’s my first time?! I don’t understand why he put so much importance in this! It’s not as if I’m asking him to marry me! It’s just sex! The whole school knows that he would just do it with anyone so why not me?!”
“Shut up, you tosser. Are you planning to stay like that for the whole year?”
“As long as you do something you like…” she had said.
Draco groaned. He had better things to do than studying this year. But Harry was right. He needed an O in Potions, Herbology and Charms if he wanted to enter the internship program in St Mungo’s. Maybe he could ask Teddy for help…
(See the end of the chapter for
“Erm… I think we should go…” Blaise said slowly, grabbing Davis’s arm.
“It’s not like that… He’s my brother, just like you said… I want to talk to him first… And I said it could wait until we’re home anyway.”
“I’m sorry.”
At 10:30, he met with Hermione Granger. The girl was okay, he guessed. He didn’t know if he could consider her a friend. She was more Teddy’s friend and a good study partner but otherwise… he guessed he tolerated her. But now, it was a bit different because Granger was one of Harry’s best friends and he definitely didn’t know for sure what he told her about them.
“How can I tell that you’re the real Harry then?”
Apparently, Harry hadn’t even talked to Teddy yet because the Hufflepuff acted as if nothing happened during lunch. And it had already been three days!
Draco thanked him silently. He then eyed Blaise, wondering if the boy might be a menace to his relationship with Harry.
Now it was Christmas and Teddy had promised his guardians that he would go back home so Harry was leaving too. After some bargaining with his mother and Lord Black, Draco got the permission to stay at Grimmauld Place for part of the holidays.
went. Draco only had to tell him that Harry told him about the Dursleys and the Hufflepuff immediately quitted asking questions – just like Harry had told him he would.
“You’re just not as good as Teddy, but no one is. Doesn’t mean you’re shit…”
“Hey!” Harry outrageously yelled.
“I’m sure Blaise would be open to that…”
“She’s a bitch…” Harry growled.
“I know, it was stupid and insensitive on my part!” he defended himself. “The point is, that would explain why he felt so responsible for the man’s disappearance… and also how he reacted to Diggory’s death. Maybe his godfather’s mission was linked to Teddy’s gift and maybe Teddy is trying to pursue the man’s job and that’s why he has never contacted his family to tell them what happened. Anyway, you shouldn’t project your own experience on him, you know what the mindhealer says…”
Draco smirked. “Oh, is that one of your wet dreams?” he teased.
His tongue went to brush Harry’s lips on its own, and the Gryffindor let him do, responding even.
were sometimes forcing their children to play with him only to get the opportunity to talk to his own father. Lucius Malfoy had also taught his son to take advantage of this situation. That’s how Draco had formed an alliance with Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle before he even started Hogwarts. The two boys were taller, larger and stronger than him, they could protect him from older students if they ever decided to pick on him.
“Don’t remind me…” Teddy groaned. “I know it’s my fault! I told you I was sorry, okay?”
The black-haired boy was smiling easily at the student who was exposing his issue.
“As I said, Tracey is a free woman. Who am I to refuse her if she wants to cheat on her boyfriend?”
Draco raised an eyebrow to his friend. He was the only one of their group not to know. Draco wasn’t that close to him after all and Blaise usually didn’t care much about anything except himself.
Draco remembered having been thinking about the same things for years. But there was nothing they could do…
Now, Draco was having the most boring year at Hogwarts. They had started working for their O.W.L.s which was due for the end of the following year, so most of their lessons were reviewing what they did during the first three years of school. He didn’t have Quidditch practise because the House Tournament had been cancelled. And he was still unable to work at the Hospital Wing to support his eventual summer internship application to St Mungo’s because he was too young! What was he supposed to do with his time???
Reference to chapter 23 of Teddy's version
Davis held her cheek, as shocked as Draco was.
“For going out with a Slytherin?”
Harry shrugged without turning his head. Oh… so now he was pretending to be pouting for real?
“Move along, to your Common Rooms, all of you!” some prefect ordered behind them, forcing them to move and to lose Teddy in the crowd.
But that sentence seemed to break the spell. First, Potter froze, then he frowned and finally pushed Draco away.
And Draco did as told. He sat on the bench and kept looking at his boyfriend who was really scaring him right now. Harry started to unbutton his shirt.
“It’s noted,” Draco nodded. “I’m going to change in the Slytherin changing room. See you on the pitch in 5, Harry.”
His fingers were just finding their way under Harry’s shirt when a small pop resonated in the room.
Draco looked down. He was shaking uncontrollably. He just wanted to go home before Harry realized how weak he was for crying over something like that. But Harry wouldn’t let go of his wrist and before he knew it, he found himself in a tight hug. Teddy had been the only one to ever give him this kind of embrace until now… And Draco just couldn’t resist. He rested his head against Harry’s shoulder and let the tears run freely.
“What a wrackspurt?” Harry asked.
Draco and Harry shared a look behind Teddy’s back. Neither of them knew Tracey Davis that well to reassure their friend.
“Harry?” he said back.
“You, your father is a muggleborn, isn’t he?” Theo asked coldly.
“Harry, you talked to him, right?!”
Keeping it quiet from the rest of his House seemed a little bit harder…
Blaise held innocent hands to the air.
“It’s not
“Okay. Thank you for letting me know,” Draco said.
Teddy raised an eyebrow and suddenly, a girl version of their best friend was with them in the compartment. She was pretty but also had really big boobs.
Potter’s face turned bright red at that statement.
“Oh… so we are in a relationship now?” Draco interrupted him.
Anyway, please tell me what you think!!!
“Then, why did you tell me?” Draco asked.
“What?? How??? When????”
Draco rolled his eyes while Harry chuckled softly. The fake-child hide his face against the Gryffindor’s chest. Harry hugged him back and Draco just watched them with a loving smile on his face, wondering if this could be their future in a few years.
And Draco smiled without commenting. However, he could tell there was something else in the Gryffindor’s mind.
“What?!!” the three others exclaimed.
“I reckon we should leave him alone for a bit…” Weasley added before starting a new game.
“You can’t be serious Harry!” Granger exclaimed outraged.
Draco looked at his boyfriend’s back until he disappeared into a side corridor. He wouldn’t let it slide. He couldn’t let it slide! He decided, taking the direction of the dungeons.
“See you tomorrow then… I’ll be there around 2 pm, I think…”
Draco didn’t think that it was a very sensible thing to say to shocked students who just might have lost a friend, but he had better things to do with his life than arguing with a senile old man.
The next morning, Teddy seemed not to be remembering much of his evening. Draco told them that Davis was a homophobic bitch and they decided not to talk about all that anymore. This incident seemed to have calmed down Teddy’s quest of looking for the girl of his dreams. Their O.W.L.s exams were only two months away after all, so they had better things to do.
Harry shook his head slowly. “It’s not that… It’s just… Could you please back down with the teasing? I… I’ve never been in a relationship before so, I’m sorry if I’m naïve or… or I don’t know what to do but… you acting like that is not helping, okay?”
“Well, apparently, my dad had known for years as Sirius always went to him after having a wet dream about Remus…” Harry smirked.
“I… I don’t think it’s a good idea. I’m serious about wanting to tell Teddy first, you know? Anyway, I think Sirius and Remus are planning something for me tomorrow… they talked about necessary education if I want to engage in a…” Harry stopped abruptly and blushed.
Draco smirked himself to sleep that night.
“It would have happened not long before his godfather’s death. I mean, we don’t even know how sudden it was, but it must have been sudden! He wouldn’t have left his godson alone like that otherwise. Do you think that’s why his aunt didn’t take him in after her husband’s death? Because she was starting over with her lover and wanted nothing to do with her late husband’s godson?”
Draco stayed quiet. Harry was ashamed of him. That’s what it was. He should have known it… He was indeed the son of a Death Eater… No matter what his mother did to save their image, he will always be a pariah in their society.
“Right,” Harry sighed deeply. “Remember, it’s in the past and you can’t do anything about it, okay?”
“To happy Christmas memories and the newlyweds!” Black declared.
“Come on, my Little Dragon, you’ve been in love with the boy before even meeting him!” she teased.
“It’s Harry, you bloody git,” Potter-Harry breathed before closing the last remaining distance between their lips.
“You don’t mean that,” Harry chuckled.
“Draco, calm down…” Theo tried to stop him.
However, the sudden burst of cheer of the pitch ruined his effect. He looked around and then down at the ground. Diggory was holding the cup in one hand at the entrance of the maze. Draco realized that he had paid no attention to the Third Task at all. But then, the Hufflepuff Golden Boy collapsed, and people started screaming around. The rumour took only a few seconds to spread.
Draco froze under the glare on his best friend’s face. And the worst part was that Teddy didn’t even seem remotely sorry when he just went back to his book a few seconds later.
“Potter… May I speak to you?” he asked, standing nervously next to the Gryffindor table.
“I’m sorry Harry, I didn’t mean to…”
“Good one, Creevey! You will have to give me a copy of that shot!” Teddy exclaimed.
“I love you too, you idiot…” Harry whispered before kissing him again under a full standing ovation from the rest of their friends, dispatching in every House.
“I…” Harry started but stopped when he realised that what Draco was saying was the truth. Of course, they talked every day, but they never clearly labelled what they were. “I started going out with you when you kissed me in those changing rooms…”
Draco stayed in shock for a few seconds before storming out of the Black Library. Harry managed to stop him just before he threw the floopowder down the fireplace.
“Did you tell Granger and Weasley?” he asked.
Draco froze. He hadn’t expected that. That was big. Could he do that? What if Harry needed to talk about something that he wasn’t supposed to hear?! Yet, Harry asked him.
“What?! Wait, Sirius! It’s only 11 a.m.!” Lupin protested but a trail of the finest flutes had already appeared on the coffee table. “They can’t drink, they’re underage!!” the wolf protested them after counting the number of glasses on the tray.
Double-sorry!
“Whose fault is that?! Snape was furious!”
“It’s not good…” the second one followed in the same tone. Draco really didn’t know how Teddy could tell them apart.
“I told Hermione when she came over last week but I’m not sure she heard me…” Harry admitted sulking a little. “As for Ron… I’ll tell him tonight. He might need a bit of time…”
“I don’t know what you’re playing at, but I don’t do booty calls!” he snapped.
“He… he wasn’t spying!” the Gryffindor seeker exclaimed before anyone could suggest a humiliating punishment. “I asked him to come!”
“I get it…” Teddy sighed. “You two are going out and I don’t want to be around when things will get naughty!”
The holidays were ok. Draco did sleep in Harry’s bedroom but since Harry wasn’t ready yet, they had agreed to wait. It didn’t stop them from snogging for hours at night. And yes, sometimes their hands went down each other pyjama pants, and no, they didn’t forget to put the Muffliato charm on. It was nobody’s business anyway and they were very happy to keep it that way.
“Guys,” Angelina Johnson said as she entered the boys’ changing room. “I caught this Slytherin spying on us. It’s getting worse every year…” She sighed. “What do you suggest we do to him?”
Harry shrugged and Draco couldn’t just accept that.
“And how did Black react?”
Draco hesitated for a second. Did he go too far? But Harry’s wrist was still in his hand and the boy hadn’t moved the slightest away from him.
The mirror blurred and only his own reflect appeared in it. Draco sighed and crashed on his mattress. Why couldn’t Blaise just shut his mouth?!
“Well, if it’s what you need to overcome your best Harry, I won’t oppose it…” Johnson said after a long time. “Please, tell Flint too. I don’t want him to curse my seeker if he caught him in a similar situation… And next time, come after we finish. You can train with Harry, but I won’t let you snitch our chasers’ tactics to your House…”
Harry was crying again while laughing disgustingly at himself, and Draco didn’t know what to do to make him stop thinking so badly about himself. He sat back on the bench, pulling Harry with him. The Gryffindor was shivering. He was only wearing his underwear after all. Draco quickly detached his robe and hung it around Harry’s shoulder.
“I didn’t know what they were…” he mumbled. “If that made you uncomfortable, I…”
They were gone but Teddy had yet to move. Harry was next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah… but it was a good game. You flew well…”
,’ Draco mouthed silently.
“Right.”
They went at it for long minutes until Harry straightened up a bit. He wouldn’t let the matter go then.
TW: reference to past child abuse, homophobia, internalized homophobia... you've been warned!
“Let’s go,” he said to Harry. “I’ll carry him.”
Harry grimaced. “I don’t want
Draco nodded. He knew that Harry had some insecurities, but he didn’t expect him to voice them aloud like that…
Harry simply smirked and hugged his two guardians goodbye before brushing Draco’s hand once more.
“It’s probably just his way of mourning…” she said.
“Asshole…” he mumbled against his lips.
Harry was smiling mischievously at this point and Draco couldn’t stop himself from smirking too.
Draco smirked again. He was so cute. He couldn’t resist him.
“Yes…” Harry breathed.
But it was unnerving… Seeing him pretending to dance with that Patil girl… It was also funny to realise that the boy seemed to be looking Draco’s way more often than not too… But he wasn’t sure whether the other boy might feel something for him too, or he just had noticed that Draco was looking at him and thus, was looking back. That later explanation wasn’t funny at all.
“Shagging me so I lose the match?” Harry inquired.
“We can’t do that…”
They hung up and Draco almost immediately regretted accepting to go. His reluctance was confirmed the very next day when Teddy just shouted at him to leave him alone.
Draco joined him and they kissed softly. As Draco was inspecting the new magical room, he heard Harry gasped slightly. He turned and saw that the door he had just come by had disappeared.
“Shut up! I don’t even know how I managed to survive the evening already. When Remus came back home, he asked if we had switched clothes because he could smell your odour all over me! Sirius, literally, rolled on the floor laughing!”
Harry jolted a few meters away and Draco felt colder than he ever did in his entire life. He was ready to glare at the intruder but falter slightly when he noticed that it was none other than Lord Black himself, with a smug face on while leaning with cross arms against the open door.
’ with Harry pretty easily. Harry was right when he said Teddy would be the hot topic anyway. It seemed that the Wolfe had switched to predatory mode this year and it was funny to watch.
“I wish I was with you too…”
Relief flew through Draco’s body, but he could tell from Harry’s face that something else was going on.
“What happened?!” Draco asked as a greeting while looking at Teddy’s head.
“I’m fine and… no…” Harry answered, looking down.
And then, as quickly as it started, it ended.
Draco nodded without really knowing what he was agreeing to.
But Draco had worried for nothing. Teddy seemed to have become sick of them both and decided to act on their extensive free time. Frankly speaking, Draco wasn’t even sure that Teddy realised the value of the gift he gave them. Who could say that they had trained under an almost world champion seeker’s very own routine???? At least, Potter seemed to be on the same page as he was on that part. Neither of them would waste on that opportunity.
Draco just smiled pleasantly. “And last but not least… may I present you Slytherin Prefect Badge?” he finished, finally revealing the shiny green and silver badge.
’,” he added, hoping his best friend would get the message. Harry certainly got it. “See you later.”
“How is champagne not alcoholic?!!”
“Urgh… Promise me to put soundproof charms on your door…” Teddy sighed exasperatedly in the train that was bringing them home.
Suddenly, Harry jolted up and looked at something Draco couldn’t see.
“What about Teddy?”
“Draco!” Harry exclaimed when his face appeared.
“Fuck Teddy…” Draco sighed against his lips.
“Malfoy…”
“You did what?!” Harry asked with a blank face. Draco could tell that he was getting angry with him.
“That was…” Harry started.
The team’s eyes were on him now, but he didn’t care.
“Hey,” Draco said back. “What’s wrong?”
Harry turned red, as he always did.
“So? What is it?” Narcissa asked evenly, back at pretending to sip in her teacup.
“Honestly… Sirius told me that between my parents’ heritage and his, I could probably live the rest of my life without having to work a single day,” he said.
“Yeah… you should give me a goodbye gift, or I’ll never survive…” Draco growled.
“I see… Do you want me to join? Are you two okay? Where are you?”
Harry turned to face him. He had taken out his robe and was now only wearing a shirt and a muggle jean.
“I… I need to talk to Teddy first…” he muttered.
“We’re not getting married!!!” Harry complained loudly.
Draco stayed shocked. He barely knew the guy but… but could that even be possible?!! This Triwizard Tournament had been put back in place on the only condition that safety measures were improved and yet, it was the second accident of this kind! The first time, the merpeople of the Black Lake apparently misunderstood their ‘
Draco looked down at his best friend, wondering if he could walk in that state.
Draco couldn’t stop smirking. It was only the first week of classes and they were already planning a secret date in the kitchen at lunch… Harry clearly had a different meaning of discrete than what he had expected… At this rate, they would definitely get caught… But he wouldn’t complain, it was Harry’s idea after all. Gryffindor boldness had its perks sometimes…
“Promise!” Harry smiled. He kissed him softly and straightened up, frowning. “Will you hate me if I beat you again?”
Draco stayed silent. He had never been engaged enough in a game to just jump by a window to win… It was a classical Gryffindor move, he guessed.
“I reckon that was good enough to make us official,” Harry declared.
“I love you too…” he said sheepishly.
“Draco?”
“So, I reckon you and Teddy had quite a party last night?” Draco asked casually as they were walking to the train.
When Harry told Draco to meet him in the Quidditch Pitch after Gryffindor team’s training session, he clearly hadn’t expected his boyfriend to make an entrance at the end of his captain’s wand.
Teddy and Harry had then realised that they had only three weeks left to finish all their summer assignments and that they hadn’t even started yet. Draco agreed with them when they said they were doomed. It wasn’t his case in any way as his summer assignments were all almost done.
Anyway, what do you think?
“What is he doing there?! How do you know?”
He then shut up, refusing to look up to meet Draco’s eyes.
“He hasn’t talked to you then…” he guessed.
Draco and Teddy had spent some time together during those two weeks which hadn’t really happened since the end of the previous year. Draco wouldn’t admit it, but he hadn’t noticed how much he had missed that until now. Sure, Harry had been a good distraction and snogging had its perks, but it wasn’t the same as talking with your best friend for hours.
It wasn’t a problem though. Draco woke up a few times to Harry soft humming as the boy was sketching something on an old notebook. It gave him some ideas for his Christmas present, and he was in desperately needs for some. Thankfully, Diagon Alley had all the magical drawing supplies one could dream of.
“We weren’t sure about how our respective Captains would take it; you see?” Draco said in a smooth voice. “We didn’t want House rivalry to go in between our Quidditch performance…”
He grabbed his school robe and went to one of the booths to change. He was out less than a minute later. Draco tried to imitate Teddy’s puppy look to stop him from leaving but he only got a pitying smile in return.
.His imperfections were what made him attractive. Like his stupid glasses that put far too much emphasis on the emerald green of his eyes…
“Harry…” Draco pleaded. He wasn’t equipped to deal with that situation at all. “Who else knows? Does Teddy know?”
“Oh, don’t worry about me… I just need to get used to it but I’m alright…” the other boy said sheepishly.
“No,” Lupin said. “They’ll learn the consequences of their actions and suffer their hangover until the Sorting Feast tonight. Period. Now, off you go before I decide I’m being too soft on you!”
“I thought you were straight?” Harry questioned Teddy.
Harry blushed as he always did at these words.
“It’s okay,” Harry whispered. “I missed you.”
“Draco?”
“What?! But that was my plan from the very beginning!” Draco pretended to whine.
“On the matter of our respective captains… I think we should back down a bit… at least until the match. I can’t think straight when I’m with you and I don’t want Gryffindor to lose the cup because of me…”
“Harry said what?” Draco repeated glaring at his boyfriend.
“Last time they drank, they nearly killed each other!” Lupin pointed out.
“Draco?”
“What?”
“Well, potions and salves are way more effective than spells…”
Potter groaned when he noticed his mistake and Draco laughed again. His hopelessness was so cute…
“How do you feel?” Draco asked softly.
“I don’t know…” the Gryffindor admitted. “I can’t imagine McGonagall’s face if I tell her that I want to become a Professional Quidditch Player… She would probably be… doubtful.”
“Are you now?” Draco teased and the ghost of a smile appeared in Harry’s face before fading away again.
“When did he ever say that?!!”
Draco followed the owls, pretending not to care, but carefully waiting for Hedwig to land in front of her owner.
Draco looked down at the way Harry’s hand was still holding his sleeve. Was that kind of proximity okay when someone could barge in at any moment? Would they ever be certain that no one was looking at them when they’d be at Hogwarts? Was holding hands okay or too much in the end?
“So, tell me, what’s going on?” Draco asked again.
During his first dinner home, Narcissa told Draco that she had made special arrangements for him and, even though he was still too young to be elected for a full internship at St Mungo's, he would be able to have theoretical lessons with their private healer twice a week during the summer. Draco had been thrilled.
Okay… so maybe Harry wasn’t in the teasing mood at all today.
“…that’s Slytherin Common Room…” Draco answered Harry’s unspoken question in awe. “Wait here.”
“I’m ok… I’m just worried about him.” Harry sighed. “He asked me if he should try it with a guy and to suggest him a few names…”
“Perfect…” Draco finished.
“Oh… Our little wolf is stuck in a storm of wrackspurts right now… There is nothing we can do except waiting for them to go… They are really aggressive wrackspurts you see…”
Harry must have realized what he had just done because he let Draco’s arm go and looked away uncomfortably.
Harry shook his head. “I’m not sure it’s the right time for that… Obviously, he has other things on his mind.”
“It’s okay, it’s not real alcohol, it’s champagne!” Black told him while putting a soft kiss on his lips.
“Shut up, Draco!” Teddy snapped. “I told you I didn’t want to play your stupid game so now piss off, okay?!”
“What?!”
Something cold settled into Draco’s stomach at that statement. Well, of course, he had asked Pansy to keep it quiet and it was probably just a lie to cover it up. But it still hurt.
The surface of the mirror blurred, and his boyfriend’s face appeared.
“What makes you think that?” he asked innocently as if everything was normal.
“You don’t have to justify yourself, Draco…” Harry sighed. “It’s ok, I trust you. I need to go; Teddy just made the room provide tequila…”
Even during their ride home, Teddy wouldn’t talk or look up from his books. It was unnerving. Even more when Draco could see how worried Harry was by all this…
The biggest blow had been on Teddy’s parents’ death anniversary though…
Draco froze and something sour immediately grew in his throat.
“No. I haven’t seen them since the day I first board the Hogwarts Express,” Harry said. “But, even now… when… when I dream about you and… and we take it a step further… he always finds us and… and those scars aren’t only on my body anymore and… I know you said that wizarding folks aren’t like that. Teddy, Sirius, and Remus told me that too but… One day, when I was there, they said in the news that a couple had been beaten to death because they’ve been holding hands in the street and they were both boys and my Uncle said that… that they deserved it and that I should just end up like them because I was a freak, just like those fags and that… that I’ll probably be the same because freaks like me would never do anything normal and… and… I proved him right, didn’t I?”
“Not since the Hogwarts Express, no,” Draco confirmed bitterly. “How are you? Did you talk to Teddy yet?”
“Teddy too?” Draco inquired hopefully.
“Oh! Don’t pretend! I know you feel the same! I saw the way you always look at my ass!”
Granger then asked him a few questions about the prefect position in the different houses, which was a good distraction to avoid bringing Harry in the discussion.
Everyone in the compartment stared wide-eyed. Never ever had Teddy talked like that to anyone! – well, except maybe to Ginevra Weasley, but he hated the girl for some reason. Harry’s hand gripped Draco’s knee before the Slytherin could verbally fight back and tell his friend where he could put his attitude.
“I don’t talk about your ass with Teddy!” Harry exclaimed. “Not in details, at least…”
Harry hesitated before taking something from his pocket. Draco couldn’t see what it was as Harry displayed it off-screen.
However, when Teddy didn’t show up at dinner despite Potter being here, Draco felt like something very wrong happened.
“Nothing… Just that it doesn’t matter anyway. He’s probably gay so who cares… being raised by two fags, there’s no way he turned up normal… Maybe that’s why he doesn’t want to do it. Because he’s scared, he can’t raise it… I mean, you just have to see you and Potter to know that Ted will follow your steps sooner or later… He worships you so much… it’s disgusting.”
Davis sneered again.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked cryptically while looking at them. The younger student was gone.
“So, you love me now?” Draco smirked back.
“That door wasn’t here before…”
“Should I give you an incentive to surpass yourself?” Harry whispered softly in his ear.
“You have nothing to be ashamed of, you know?” the Slytherin continued while resuming dressing in dry robes. “Teddy is just a bit taller, but he isn’t that fit.”
A few days later, Harry called again at night to tell him that Teddy had a break down the previous night but that he was doing a bit better now. Apparently, Remus, Sirius and Harry were now taking turns to be sure someone was always there to keep Teddy company while he was researching who knew what. It was a good idea, albeit a bit boring in Harry’s point of view.
Potter snorted. “Life is just so unfair…” he sighed. “How come him and you have skin as smooth as babies and people like me just have to fight against acne attacks every other morning?!”
Draco nodded. It wasn’t like him, but, regarding the circumstances, this could be understandable.
Harry brushed his cheek, worried.
“Shut up and play, Pans’…” Theo sighed.
“Good night Harry… and Happy Birthday again…”
He called through the two-way mirror every other day and talked to him as if they were still spending their days together. He also came to the Malfoy Manor regularly during the second half of the summer. Once, Draco and his mother had been invited to Lord Black’s residence. And everything went great! Draco’s mother came to peace with her older sister and her younger cousin. Potter had been decent. And Draco had met a new cousin and enjoyed the show while Dora and Teddy competed to know who the better metamorphmagus was.
“Oh… so Gryffindors could get the subtext when they really want to…”
Harry chuckled softly. “I guess that’s my prize then,” he said. “I don’t want to let you go either.”
“Harry might have mentioned that to you, Edward…”
Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco was suddenly prisoner of Teddy’s arm.
Draco grimaced at the idea. “You’re right, I’ll tell her tomorrow.”
The next morning, the whole school seemed to be hangovering. Dumbledore told them that nothing could have been done to save Diggory and that, as unfortunate that loss was, it should remind them all that life was short and that no one was invincible.
“I know… In theory…” Harry sighed. “But it’s not true. They hate magic and I kept doing it around them… They’ve never asked to be my guardians, someone just dropped me on their doorstep after my parents died…”
Teddy and Harry had been pretty busy ever since. However, Harry kept on calling Draco through the two-way mirror almost every day.
“I’ll look after him, I promise,” Harry said taking Draco’s wrist into his hand.
Draco would never admit it aloud, but he was afraid. Afraid of what Potter could say about him. Afraid about what Black could say about him or his mother! Let alone his father… What if spending two whole months with those two changed the way Teddy was looking at him?? What if Teddy didn’t want to be his friend anymore after that???
family. But so relieving. The mind-healer didn’t judge. Didn’t even talk about what his father was. What was on his vein. It was great and after some time, he started seeing changes in Harry too.
“Good.”
Harry nodded but didn’t look any better.
bed…”
“I’ll call you on the mirror tonight…” he whispered before leaving.
Thus, this year, Draco’s summer would be divided between Quidditch training, piano lesson and healing practice! It would be great, and he was eager to tell his best friend, so he called him on the two-way mirror that night. But Teddy didn’t answer, neither did he answer the next day or the one after that… After a week, Draco just stopped trying.
Draco accepted. At first, it was primarily to share Harry’s experience. He hadn’t expected to have so much about himself to talk about – his father’s expectation and what losing him had meant to him, his childhood, his fear to disappoint his mother, Teddy, not being able to help him as he’d always helped him, his relationship with Harry, what people thought about him, about them… the fact that he was deeply afraid of not being good enough and that Harry deserved better… afraid that he could make a mistake that could cost him not only Harry but Teddy as well… then he would have nothing left.
“Blaise, dear, you should put your trousers back on, I’m opening the door~,” Draco said loudly, imitating Pansy.
“I don’t want you to be a booty call either!” he said honestly.
“Nothing!”
“Will you?” Harry asked, sliding his fingers in the platinum blond hair. He was probably the only person in the world allowed to do that… Even his mother lost that privilege long ago.
“Do you want to know my secret?” Draco asked in the same kind of tone. He felt Teddy nodding next to him. “He’s been seeing a mind-healer for two months already…” he whispered into his friend’s ear.
“So… your punishment…” he said. “Well, it’s probably not what you’re expecting… I’m not sure I’m ready to… well… go all the way… but we’ll see later… Remus said there’re other ways to… well… it’s not the subject right here… maybe as a prize if… well… If you’re still in the mood and don’t hate me and…”
“You’re like your mother. I’m proud of you, Draco Malfoy.”
“There’re other ways to warm up to each other,” Draco shrugged. “Maybe you could just, take it slow with Davis and see at what point you started feeling uncomfortable…”
“Well… you see… we trained together last year and… well, we thought we could keep it up this year. And, no offence Angelina, your training is great, but I’m a Seeker, I’ll do better if I train with competition…”
Now, he was making his way to the Prefect bathroom, slightly nervous.
And the mirror blurred before even waiting for Draco’s answer.
“Hey, you,” Draco smiled at her while taking the letter she was holding.
They were both crying, and Draco thought they must have looked stupid.
“Why didn’t you say so, Malfoy?” the Quidditch captain finally sighed.
Draco grimaced for another reason.
Of course, the Weasley twins had teased Harry a bit when he went back to Gryffindor Tower in Slytherin robes, but even them admitted that green was looking good on him. Teddy asked Draco how the
He smiled and Harry smirked back sitting back next to him and resting his head against his shoulder before taking out a book on psychology.
She smiled pleasantly but refused to take part in that argument.
Draco chuckled. “No way. Teddy will definitely be Head Boy. I have my eyes on the Slytherin Quidditch Captain position though…”
“Lucky you, I’ve just discovered that wonderful muggle invention called earplugs!” Draco smirked.
Maybe Potter had noticed his feelings and asked Teddy to set him off to beat the shit out of him. But Potter seemed as surprised as he was to see him there. So maybe he didn’t know… Maybe Teddy noticed Draco’s feelings for Potter and had set them up! But that would be… so much like his best friend… What if Teddy knew something thanks to his seer abilities?
“Why? I’ve got it and I survived!” Harry pointed out.
“I’ll help you,” Harry confirmed.
“You’re sure?” he asked.
“So…” Draco cleared his throat. “You won…”
Draco lifted his eyes from the book he was reading and looked at the two-way mirror laying on his nightstand. He took it in his hand and made sure he was presentable before answering.
Draco stared at the raven-haired boy. They hadn’t been that far yet. Was he really suggesting what he thought he was suggesting?
“I love you, okay? And nothing that had happened to you in the past will change that! Don’t think so little of me, please…” he added, trying to sidestep the fact that it was the first time that he told him those three words so clearly.
“Should I get going now? Or…”
“Should I suggest to Sirius and Remus to give you
Draco’s thoughts were whirling in his head. That was big. Was he ready? It was two weeks away though… It was going to be a long time…
Draco was ready to scold him, but Harry was still in his arms. A solitary tear rolled down his cheek, but he was smiling the most beautiful smile Draco had ever seen him.
“Really?!” Teddy exclaimed, letting him go to look at him straight in the eyes.
“Harry?” Draco leaned against the other boy’s ear. “Can I kiss you again?”
“It wasn’t easy. He refused Ron, Fred, George or any Weasley… and you met Charlie, he’s hot…” Draco pinched Harry’s ass at that comment – even if he agreed with him. “Then, I proposed Seamus or Dean… Maybe McLaggen – our new keeper, Teddy actually threw up at that point…”
